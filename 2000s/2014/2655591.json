REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12–138.      Argued December 2, 2013—Decided March 5, 2014\nAn investment treaty (Treaty) between the United Kingdom and Ar-\n gentina authorizes a party to submit a dispute “to the decision of the\n competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the\n investment was made,” i.e., a local court, Art. 8(1); and permits arbi-\n tration, as relevant here, “where, after a period of eighteen months\n has elapsed from the moment when the dispute was submitted to\n [that] tribunal . . . , the said tribunal has not given its final decision,”\n Art. 8(2)(a)(i).\n    Petitioner BG Group plc, a British firm, belonged to a consortium\n with a majority interest in MetroGAS, an Argentine entity awarded\n an exclusive license to distribute natural gas in Buenos Aires. At the\n time of BG Group’s investment, Argentine law provided that gas “tar-\n iffs” would be calculated in U. S. dollars and would be set at levels\n sufficient to assure gas distribution firms a reasonable return. But\n Argentina later amended the law, changing (among other things) the\n calculation basis to pesos. MetroGAS’ profits soon became losses.\n Invoking Article 8, BG Group sought arbitration, which the parties\n sited in Washington, D. C. BG Group claimed that Argentina’s new\n laws and practices violated the Treaty, which forbids the “expropria-\n tion” of investments and requires each nation to give “fair and equi-\n table treatment” to investors from the other. Argentina denied those\n claims, but also argued that the arbitrators lacked “jurisdiction” to\n hear the dispute because, as relevant here, BG Group had not com-\n plied with Article 8’s local litigation requirement. The arbitration\n panel concluded that it had jurisdiction, finding, among other things,\n that Argentina’s conduct (such as also enacting new laws that hin-\n dered recourse to its judiciary by firms in BG Group’s situation) had\n excused BG Group’s failure to comply with Article 8’s requirement.\n2            BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    On the merits, the panel found that Argentina had not expropriated\n    BG Group’s investment but had denied BG Group “fair and equitable\n    treatment.” It awarded damages to BG Group. Both sides sought re-\n    view in federal district court: BG Group to confirm the award under\n    the New York Convention and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),\n    and Argentina to vacate the award, in part on the ground that the\n    arbitrators lacked jurisdiction under the FAA. The District Court\n    confirmed the award, but the Court of Appeals for the District of Co-\n    lumbia Circuit vacated. It found that the interpretation and applica-\n    tion of Article 8’s requirement were matters for courts to decide de\n    novo, i.e., without deference to the arbitrators’ views; that the cir-\n    cumstances did not excuse BG Group’s failure to comply with the re-\n    quirement; and that BG Group had to commence a lawsuit in Argen-\n    tina’s courts and wait 18 months before seeking arbitration. Thus,\n    the court held, the arbitrators lacked authority to decide the dispute.\nHeld:\n    1. A court of the United States, in reviewing an arbitration award\n made under the Treaty, should interpret and apply “threshold” provi-\n sions concerning arbitration using the framework developed for in-\n terpreting similar provisions in ordinary contracts. Under that\n framework, the local litigation requirement is a matter for arbitra-\n tors primarily to interpret and apply. Courts should review their in-\n terpretation with deference. Pp. 6–17.\n       (a) Were the Treaty an ordinary contract, it would call for arbi-\n trators primarily to interpret and to apply the local litigation provi-\n sion. In an ordinary contract, the parties determine whether a par-\n ticular matter is primarily for arbitrators or for courts to decide. See,\n e.g., Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 582. If\n the contract is silent on the matter of who is to decide a “threshold”\n question about arbitration, courts determine the parties’ intent using\n presumptions. That is, courts presume that the parties intended\n courts to decide disputes about “arbitrability,” e.g., Howsam v. Dean\n Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 84, and arbitrators to decide dis-\n putes about the meaning and application of procedural preconditions\n for the use of arbitration, see id., at 86, including, e.g., claims of\n “waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability,” Moses H. Cone Me-\n morial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, and the\n satisfaction of, e.g., “ ‘time limits, notice, laches, [or] estoppel,’ ” How-\n sam, 537 U. S., at 85. The provision at issue is of the procedural va-\n riety. As its text and structure make clear, it determines when the\n contractual duty to arbitrate arises, not whether there is a contractu-\n al duty to arbitrate at all. Neither its language nor other language in\n Article 8 gives substantive weight to the local court’s determinations\n on the matters at issue between the parties. The litigation provision\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  is thus a claims-processing rule. It is analogous to other procedural\n  provisions found to be for arbitrators primarily to interpret and ap-\n  ply, see, e.g., ibid., and there is nothing in Article 8 or the Treaty to\n  overcome the ordinary assumption. Pp. 7–9.\n        (b) The fact that the document at issue is a treaty does not make\n  a critical difference to this analysis. A treaty is a contract between\n  nations, and its interpretation normally is a matter of determining\n  the parties’ intent. Air France v. Saks, 470 U. S. 392, 399. Where, as\n  here, a federal court is asked to interpret that intent pursuant to a\n  motion to vacate or confirm an award made under the Federal Arbi-\n  tration Act, it should normally apply the presumptions supplied by\n  American law. The presence of a condition of “consent” to arbitration\n  in a treaty likely does not warrant abandoning, or increasing the\n  complexity of, the ordinary intent-determining framework. See, e.g.,\n  Howsam, supra, at 83–85. But because this Treaty does not state\n  that the local litigation requirement is a condition of consent, the\n  Court need not resolve what the effect of any such language would be.\n  The Court need not go beyond holding that in the absence of lan-\n  guage in a treaty demonstrating that the parties intended a different\n  delegation of authority, the ordinary interpretive framework applies.\n  Pp. 10–13.\n        (c) The Treaty contains no evidence showing that the parties had\n  an intent contrary to the ordinary presumptions about who should\n  decide threshold arbitration issues. The text and structure of Article\n  8’s litigation requirement make clear that it is a procedural condition\n  precedent to arbitration. Because the ordinary presumption applies\n  and is not overcome, the interpretation and application of the provi-\n  sion are primarily for the arbitrators, and courts must review their\n  decision with considerable deference. Pp. 13–17.\n     2. While Argentina is entitled to court review (under a properly\n  deferential standard) of the arbitrators’ decision to excuse BG\n  Group’s noncompliance with the litigation requirement, that review\n  shows that the arbitrators’ determinations were lawful. Their con-\n  clusion that the litigation provision cannot be construed as an abso-\n  lute impediment to arbitration, in all cases, lies well within their in-\n  terpretative authority. Their factual findings that Argentina passed\n  laws hindering recourse to the local judiciary by firms similar to BG\n  Group are undisputed by Argentina and are accepted as valid. And\n  their conclusion that Argentina’s actions made it “absurd and unrea-\n  sonable” to read Article 8 to require an investor in BG Group’s posi-\n  tion to bring its grievance in a domestic court, before arbitrating, is\n  not barred by the Treaty.

See Agreement\nfor the Promotion and Protection of Investments, Art. 8(2),\nDec. 11, 1990, 1765 U. N. T. S. 38 (hereinafter Treaty).\nThe provision authorizes either party to submit a dispute\n“to the decision of the competent tribunal of the Contract­\ning Party in whose territory the investment was made,”\ni.e., a local court. Art. 8(1). And it provides for arbitration\n      “(i) where, after a period of eighteen months has\n      elapsed from the moment when the dispute was sub­\n      mitted to the competent tribunal . . . , the said tribu­\n      nal has not given its final decision; [or]\n      “(ii) where the final decision of the aforementioned\n      tribunal has been made but the Parties are still in\n      dispute.” Art. 8(2)(a).\nThe Treaty also entitles the parties to agree to proceed\ndirectly to arbitration. Art. 8(2)(b).\n   This case concerns the Treaty’s arbitration clause, and\n2        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspecifically the local court litigation requirement set forth\nin Article 8(2)(a). The question before us is whether a\ncourt of the United States, in reviewing an arbitration\naward made under the Treaty, should interpret and apply\nthe local litigation requirement de novo, or with the defer­\nence that courts ordinarily owe arbitration decisions. That\nis to say, who—court or arbitrator—bears primary respon­\nsibility for interpreting and applying the local litigation\nrequirement to an underlying controversy? In our view,\nthe matter is for the arbitrators, and courts must review\ntheir determinations with deference.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  In the early 1990’s, the petitioner, BG Group plc, a\nBritish firm, belonged to a consortium that bought a ma­\njority interest in an Argentine entity called MetroGAS.\nMetroGAS was a gas distribution company created by\nArgentine law in 1992, as a result of the government’s\nprivatization of its state-owned gas utility. Argentina\ndistributed the utility’s assets to new, private companies,\none of which was MetroGAS. It awarded MetroGAS a 35­\nyear exclusive license to distribute natural gas in Buenos\nAires, and it submitted a controlling interest in the com­\npany to international public tender. BG Group’s consor­\ntium was the successful bidder.\n  At about the same time, Argentina enacted statutes\nproviding that its regulators would calculate gas “tariffs”\nin U. S. dollars, and that those tariffs would be set at\nlevels sufficient to assure gas distribution firms, such as\nMetroGAS, a reasonable return.\n  In 2001 and 2002, Argentina, faced with an economic\ncrisis, enacted new laws. Those laws changed the basis for\ncalculating gas tariffs from dollars to pesos, at a rate of\none peso per dollar. The exchange rate at the time was\nroughly three pesos to the dollar. The result was that\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMetroGAS’ profits were quickly transformed into losses.\nBG Group believed that these changes (and several others)\nviolated the Treaty; Argentina believed the contrary.\n                             B\n   In 2003, BG Group, invoking Article 8 of the Treaty,\nsought arbitration. The parties appointed arbitrators;\nthey agreed to site the arbitration in Washington, D. C.;\nand between 2004 and 2006, the arbitrators decided mo­\ntions, received evidence, and conducted hearings. BG\nGroup essentially claimed that Argentina’s new laws and\nregulatory practices violated provisions in the Treaty\nforbidding the “expropriation” of investments and requir­\ning that each nation give “fair and equitable treatment” to\ninvestors from the other. Argentina denied these claims,\nwhile also arguing that the arbitration tribunal lacked\n“jurisdiction” to hear the dispute. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n143a–144a, 214a–218a, 224a–232a. According to Argen­\ntina, the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction because: (1) BG\nGroup was not a Treaty-protected “investor”; (2) BG\nGroup’s interest in MetroGAS was not a Treaty-protected\n“investment”; and (3) BG Group initiated arbitration\nwithout first litigating its claims in Argentina’s courts,\ndespite Article 8’s requirement. Id., at 143a–171a. In\nArgentina’s view, “failure by BG to bring its grievance to\nArgentine courts for 18 months renders its claims in this\narbitration inadmissible.” Id., at 162a.\n   In late December 2007, the arbitration panel reached a\nfinal decision. It began by determining that it had “juris­\ndiction” to consider the merits of the dispute. In support\nof that determination, the tribunal concluded that BG\nGroup was an “investor,” that its interest in MetroGAS\namounted to a Treaty-protected “investment,” and that\nArgentina’s own conduct had waived, or excused, BG\nGroup’s failure to comply with Article 8’s local litigation\nrequirement. Id., at 99a, 145a, 161a, 171a. The panel\n4        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npointed out that in 2002, the President of Argentina had\nissued a decree staying for 180 days the execution of its\ncourts’ final judgments (and injunctions) in suits claiming\nharm as a result of the new economic measures. Id., at\n166a–167a. In addition, Argentina had established a\n“renegotiation process” for public service contracts, such\nas its contract with MetroGAS, to alleviate the negative\nimpact of the new economic measures. Id., at 129a, 131a.\nBut Argentina had simultaneously barred from participa­\ntion in that “process” firms that were litigating against\nArgentina in court or in arbitration. Id., at 168a–171a.\nThese measures, while not making litigation in Argenti­\nna’s courts literally impossible, nonetheless “hindered”\nrecourse “to the domestic judiciary” to the point where the\nTreaty implicitly excused compliance with the local litiga­\ntion requirement. Id., at 165. Requiring a private party\nin such circumstances to seek relief in Argentina’s courts\nfor 18 months, the panel concluded, would lead to “absurd\nand unreasonable result[s].” Id., at 166a.\n   On the merits, the arbitration panel agreed with Argen­\ntina that it had not “expropriate[d]” BG Group’s invest­\nment, but also found that Argentina had denied BG Group\n“fair and equitable treatment.” Id., at 222a–223a, 240a–\n242a. It awarded BG Group $185 million in damages. Id.,\nat 297a.\n                             C\n   In March 2008, both sides filed petitions for review in\nthe District Court for the District of Columbia. BG Group\nsought to confirm the award under the New York Conven­\ntion and the Federal Arbitration Act. See Convention on\nthe Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral\nAwards, Art. IV, June 10, 1958, 21 U. S. T. 2519, T. I. A. S.\nNo. 6997 (New York Convention) (providing that a party\nmay apply “for recognition and enforcement” of an arbitral\naward subject to the Convention); 9 U. S.

Argentina sought to\nvacate the award in part on the ground that the arbitra­\ntors lacked jurisdiction. See §10(a)(4) (a federal court may\nvacate an arbitral award “where the arbitrators exceeded\ntheir powers”).\n   The District Court denied Argentina’s claims and con­\nfirmed the award. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2469412\"><a href=\"/dcd/dE55/republic-of-argentina-v-bg-group-plc/\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (DC 2011); 715 F.\nSupp. 2d 108 (DC 2010). But the Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit reversed. 665 F. 3d 1363\n(2012). In the appeals court’s view, the interpretation and\napplication of Article 8’s local litigation requirement was a\nmatter for courts to decide de novo, i.e., without deference\nto the views of the arbitrators. The Court of Appeals then\nwent on to hold that the circumstances did not excuse BG\nGroup’s failure to comply with the requirement. Rather,\nBG Group must “commence a lawsuit in Argentina’s\ncourts and wait eighteen months before filing for arbitra­\ntion.” Id., at 1373. Because BG Group had not done so,\nthe arbitrators lacked authority to decide the dispute.\nAnd the appeals court ordered the award vacated. Ibid.\n   BG Group filed a petition for certiorari. Given the\nimportance of the matter for international commercial ar­\nbitration, we granted the petition. See, e.g., K. Van­\ndevelde, Bilateral Investment Treaties: History, Policy\n& Interpretation 430–432 (2010) (explaining that dispute­\nresolution mechanisms allowing for arbitration are a\n“critical element” of modern day bilateral investment\ntreaties); C.

REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                             II\n   As we have said, the question before us is who—court or\narbitrator—bears primary responsibility for interpreting\nand applying Article 8’s local court litigation provision.\nPut in terms of standards of judicial review, should a\nUnited States court review the arbitrators’ interpretation\nand application of the provision de novo, or with the defer­\nence that courts ordinarily show arbitral decisions on\nmatters the parties have committed to arbitration? Com­\npare, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514\nU. S. 938, 942 (1995) (example where a “court makes up\nits mind about [an issue] independently” because the\nparties did not agree it should be arbitrated), with Oxford\nHealth Plans LLC v. Sutter, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip\nop., at 4) (example where a court defers to arbitrators\nbecause the parties “ ‘bargained for’ ” arbitral resolution of\nthe question (quoting Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.\nMine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000))). See also Hall\nStreet Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576,\n588 (2008) (on matters committed to arbitration, the Fed­\neral Arbitration Act provides for “just the limited review\nneeded to maintain arbitration’s essential virtue of resolv­\ning disputes straightaway” and to prevent it from be­\ncoming “merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and\ntime-consuming judicial review process” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); Eastern Associated Coal Corp., supra, at\n62 (where parties send a matter to arbitration, a court will\nset aside the “arbitrator’s interpretation of what their\nagreement means only in rare instances”).\n   In answering the question, we shall initially treat the\ndocument before us as if it were an ordinary contract\nbetween private parties. Were that so, we conclude, the\nmatter would be for the arbitrators. We then ask whether\nthe fact that the document in question is a treaty makes a\ncritical difference. We conclude that it does not.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n   Where ordinary contracts are at issue, it is up to the\nparties to determine whether a particular matter is pri­\nmarily for arbitrators or for courts to decide. See, e.g.,\nSteelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574,\n582 (1960) (“[A]rbitration is a matter of contract and a\nparty cannot be required to submit to arbitration any\ndispute which he has not agreed so to submit”). If\nthe contract is silent on the matter of who primarily\nis to decide “threshold” questions about arbitration,\ncourts determine the parties’ intent with the help of\npresumptions.\n   On the one hand, courts presume that the parties intend\ncourts, not arbitrators, to decide what we have called\ndisputes about “arbitrability.” These include questions\nsuch as “whether the parties are bound by a given arbitra­\ntion clause,” or “whether an arbitration clause in a con­\ncededly binding contract applies to a particular type of\ncontroversy.” Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537\nU. S. 79, 84 (2002); accord, Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters,\n561 U. S. 287, 299–300 (2010) (disputes over “formation of\nthe parties’ arbitration agreement” and “its enforceability\nor applicability to the dispute” at issue are “matters . . .\nthe court must resolve” (internal quotation marks omit­\nted)). See First Options, supra, at 941, 943–947 (court\nshould decide whether an arbitration clause applied to a\nparty who “had not personally signed” the document con­\ntaining it); AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications\nWorkers, 475 U. S. 643, 651 (1986) (court should decide\nwhether a particular labor-management layoff dispute fell\nwithin the arbitration clause of a collective-bargaining\ncontract); John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U. S.\n543, 546–548 (1964) (court should decide whether an\narbitration provision survived a corporate merger). See\ngenerally AT&T Technologies, supra, at 649 (“Unless the\nparties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise, the\n8        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be\ndecided by the court, not the arbitrator”).\n   On the other hand, courts presume that the parties\nintend arbitrators, not courts, to decide disputes about the\nmeaning and application of particular procedural precon­\nditions for the use of arbitration. See Howsam, supra, at\n86 (courts assume parties “normally expect a forum-based\ndecisionmaker to decide forum-specific procedural gateway\nmatters” (emphasis added)). These procedural matters\ninclude claims of “waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbi­\ntrability.” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury\nConstr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25 (1983). And they include the\nsatisfaction of “ ‘prerequisites such as time limits, notice,\nlaches, estoppel, and other conditions precedent to an\nobligation to arbitrate.’ ” Howsam, supra, at 85 (quoting\nthe Revised Uniform Arbitration Act of 2000 §6, Comment\n2, 7 U. L. A. 13 (Supp. 2002); emphasis deleted). See also\n§6(c) (“An arbitrator shall decide whether a condition\nprecedent to arbitrability has been fulfilled”); §6, Com­\nment 2 (explaining that this rule reflects “the holdings of\nthe vast majority of state courts” and collecting cases).\n   The provision before us is of the latter, procedural,\nvariety. The text and structure of the provision make\nclear that it operates as a procedural condition precedent\nto arbitration. It says that a dispute “shall be submitted\nto international arbitration” if “one of the Parties so re­\nquests,” as long as “a period of eighteen months has\nelapsed” since the dispute was “submitted” to a local tri­\nbunal and the tribunal “has not given its final decision.”\nArt. 8(2). It determines when the contractual duty to\narbitrate arises, not whether there is a contractual duty to\narbitrate at all. Cf. 13 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts\n§38:7, pp. 435, 437; §38:4, p. 422 (4th ed. 2013) (a “condi­\ntion precedent” determines what must happen before “a\ncontractual duty arises” but does not “make the validity of\nthe contract depend on its happening” (emphasis added)).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNeither does this language or other language in Article 8\ngive substantive weight to the local court’s determinations\non the matters at issue between the parties. To the con­\ntrary, Article 8 provides that only the “arbitration decision\nshall be final and binding on both Parties.” Art. 8(4). The\nlitigation provision is consequently a purely procedural\nrequirement—a claims-processing rule that governs when\nthe arbitration may begin, but not whether it may occur or\nwhat its substantive outcome will be on the issues in\ndispute.\n   Moreover, the local litigation requirement is highly\nanalogous to procedural provisions that both this Court\nand others have found are for arbitrators, not courts,\nprimarily to interpret and to apply. See Howsam, supra,\nat 85 (whether a party filed a notice of arbitration within\nthe time limit provided by the rules of the chosen arbitral\nforum “is a matter presumptively for the arbitrator, not\nfor the judge”); John Wiley, supra, at 555–557 (same, in\nrespect to a mandatory prearbitration grievance procedure\nthat involved holding two conferences). See also Dialysis\nAccess Center, LLC v. RMS Lifeline, Inc., 638 F. 3d 367,\n383 (CA1 2011) (same, in respect to a prearbitration “good\nfaith negotiations” requirement); Lumbermens Mut. Cas.\nCo. v. Broadspire Management Servs., Inc., 623 F. 3d 476,\n481 (CA7 2010) (same, in respect to a prearbitration filing\nof a “Disagreement Notice”).\n   Finally, as we later discuss in more detail, see infra,\nat 13–14, we can find nothing in Article 8 or elsewhere in\nthe Treaty that might overcome the ordinary assumption.\nIt nowhere demonstrates a contrary intent as to the dele­\ngation of decisional authority between judges and arbitra­\ntors. Thus, were the document an ordinary contract, it\nwould call for arbitrators primarily to interpret and to\napply the local litigation provision.\n10       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                            IV \n\n                             A\n\n   We now relax our ordinary contract assumption and ask\nwhether the fact that the document before us is a treaty\nmakes a critical difference to our analysis. The Solicitor\nGeneral argues that it should. He says that the local\nlitigation provision may be “a condition on the State’s\nconsent to enter into an arbitration agreement.” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 25. He adds that courts\nshould “review de novo the arbitral tribunal’s resolution of\nobjections based on an investor’s non-compliance” with\nsuch a condition. Ibid. And he recommends that we\nremand this case to the Court of Appeals to determine\nwhether the court-exhaustion provision is such a condi­\ntion. Id., at 31–33.\n                              1\n   We do not accept the Solicitor General’s view as applied\nto the treaty before us. As a general matter, a treaty is\na contract, though between nations. Its interpretation\nnormally is, like a contract’s interpretation, a matter of\ndetermining the parties’ intent. Air France v. Saks, 470\nU. S. 392, 399 (1985) (courts must give “the specific words\nof the treaty a meaning consistent with the shared expec­\ntations of the contracting parties”); Sullivan v. Kidd, 254\nU. S. 433, 439 (1921) (“[T]reaties are to be interpreted\nupon the principles which govern the interpretation of\ncontracts in writing between individuals, and are to be\nexecuted in the utmost good faith, with a view to making\neffective the purposes of the high contracting parties”);\nWright v. Henkel, 190 U. S. 40, 57 (1903) (“Treaties must\nreceive a fair interpretation, according to the intention of\nthe contracting parties”). And where, as here, a federal\ncourt is asked to interpret that intent pursuant to a mo­\ntion to vacate or confirm an award made in the United\nStates under the Federal Arbitration Act, it should nor­\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmally apply the presumptions supplied by American law.\nSee New York Convention, Art. V(1)(e) (award may be “set\naside or suspended by a competent authority of the coun­\ntry in which, or under the law of which, that award was\nmade”); Vandevelde, Bilateral Investment Treaties, at 446\n(arbitral awards pursuant to treaties are “subject to re­\nview under the arbitration law of the state where the\narbitration takes place”); Dugan, Investor-State Arbitra­\ntion, at 636 (“[T]he national courts and the law of the legal\nsitus of arbitration control a losing party’s attempt to set\naside [an] award”).\n   The Solicitor General does not deny that the presump­\ntion discussed in Part III, supra (namely, the presumption\nthat parties intend procedural preconditions to arbitration\nto be resolved primarily by arbitrators), applies both to\nordinary contracts and to similar provisions in treaties\nwhen those provisions are not also “conditions of consent.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25–27. And,\nwhile we respect the Government’s views about the proper\ninterpretation of treaties, e.g., Abbott v. Abbott, 560 U. S.\n1, 15 (2010), we have been unable to find any other au­\nthority or precedent suggesting that the use of the “con­\nsent” label in a treaty should make a critical difference\nin discerning the parties’ intent about whether courts\nor arbitrators should interpret and apply the relevant\nprovision.\n   We are willing to assume with the Solicitor General that\nthe appearance of this label in a treaty can show that the\nparties, or one of them, thought the designated matter\nquite important. But that is unlikely to be conclusive. For\nparties often submit important matters to arbitration.\nAnd the word “consent” could be attached to a highly\nprocedural precondition to arbitration, such as a waiting\nperiod of several months, which the parties are unlikely to\nhave intended that courts apply without saying so. See,\ne.g., Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protec­\n12       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of Investments, Art. 9, Netherlands-Slovenia, Sept.\n24, 1996, Netherlands T. S. No. 296 (“Each Contracting\nParty hereby consents to submit any dispute . . . which\nthey can not [sic] solve amicably within three months . . .\nto the International Center for Settlement of Disputes\nfor settlement by conciliation or arbitration”), online at\nwww.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/besluiten/\n2006/10/17/slovenia.html (all Internet materials as visited\non Feb. 28, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case\nfile); Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of\nInvestments, Art. 8(1), United Kingdom-Egypt, June 11,\n1975, 14 I. L. M. 1472 (“Each Contracting Party hereby\nconsents to submit” a dispute to arbitration if “agreement\ncannot be reached within three months between the par­\nties”). While we leave the matter open for future argu­\nment, we do not now see why the presence of the term\n“consent” in a treaty warrants abandoning, or increasing\nthe complexity of, our ordinary intent-determining frame­\nwork. See Howsam, 537 U. S., at 83–85; First Options,\n514 U. S., at 942–945; John Wiley, 376 U. S., at 546–549,\n555–559.\n                              2\n   In any event, the treaty before us does not state that the\nlocal litigation requirement is a “condition of consent” to\narbitration. Thus, we need not, and do not, go beyond\nholding that, in the absence of explicit language in a\ntreaty demonstrating that the parties intended a different\ndelegation of authority, our ordinary interpretive frame­\nwork applies. We leave for another day the question of\ninterpreting treaties that refer to “conditions of consent”\nexplicitly. See, e.g., United States-Korea Free Trade\nAgreement, Art. 11.18, Feb. 10, 2011 (provision entitled\n“Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party”\nand providing that “[n]o claim may be submitted to\narbitration under this Section” unless the claimant\nwaives in writing “any right” to press his claim before\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

L. M. 643–644 (pro-\nviding that each party’s “[c]onsent to [a]rbitration” is\nconditioned on fulfillment of certain “procedures,” one of\nwhich is a waiver by an investor of his right to litigate the\nclaim being arbitrated). See also 2012 U. S. Model Bilat­\neral Investment Treaty, Art. 26 (entitled “Conditions and\nlimitations on Consent of Each Party”), online at\nwww.ustr.gov / sites / default / files / BIT % 20text%20for%\n20ACIEP%20Meeting.pdf. And we apply our ordinary\npresumption that the interpretation and application of\nprocedural provisions such as the provision before us are\nprimarily for the arbitrators.\n                              B\n  A treaty may contain evidence that shows the parties\nhad an intent contrary to our ordinary presumptions\nabout who should decide threshold issues related to arbi­\ntration. But the treaty before us does not sho w any such\ncontrary intention. We concede that the local litigation\nrequirement appears in ¶(1) of Article 8, while the Article\ndoes not mention arbitration until the subsequent para­\ngraph, ¶(2). Moreover, a requirement that a party ex­\nhaust its remedies in a country’s domestic courts before\nseeking to arbitrate may seem particularly important to a\ncountry offering protections to foreign investors. And the\nplacing of an important matter prior to any mention of\narbitration at least arguably suggests an intent by Argen­\ntina, the United Kingdom, or both, to have courts rather\nthan arbitrators apply the litigation requirement.\n  These considerations, however, are outweighed by oth­\ners. As discussed supra, at 8–9, the text and structure of\nthe litigation requirement set forth in Article 8 make clear\nthat it is a procedural condition precedent to arbitration—\n14       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na sequential step that a party must follow before giving\nnotice of arbitration. The Treaty nowhere says that the\nprovision is to operate as a substantive condition on the\nformation of the arbitration contract, or that it is a matter\nof such elevated importance that it is to be decided by\ncourts. International arbitrators are likely more familiar\nthan are judges with the expectations of foreign investors\nand recipient nations regarding the operation of the provi­\nsion. See Howsam, supra, at 85 (comparative institutional\nexpertise a factor in determining parties’ likely intent).\nAnd the Treaty itself authorizes the use of international\narbitration associations, the rules of which provide that\narbitrators shall have the authority to interpret provisions\nof this kind. Art. 8(3) (providing that the parties may\nrefer a dispute to the International Centre for the Settle­\nment of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or to arbitrators\nappointed pursuant to the arbitration rules of the United\nNations Commission on International Trade Law\n(UNCITRAL)); accord, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Art.\n23(1) (rev. 2010 ed.) (“[A]rbitral tribunal shall have the\npower to rule on its own jurisdiction”); ICSID Convention,\nRegulations and Rules, Art. 41(1) (2006 ed.) (“Tribunal\nshall be the judge of its own competence”). Cf. Howsam,\nsupra, at 85 (giving weight to the parties’ incorporation of\nthe National Association of Securities Dealers’ Code of\nArbitration into their contract, which provided for similar\narbitral authority, as evidence that they intended arbitra­\ntors to “interpret and apply the NASD time limit rule”).\n  The upshot is that our ordinary presumption applies\nand it is not overcome. The interpretation and application\nof the local litigation provision is primarily for the arbi­\ntrators. Reviewing courts cannot review their decision\nde novo. Rather, they must do so with considerable\ndeference.\n                              C\n  The dissent interprets Article 8’s local litigation provi­\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion differently. In its view, the provision sets forth not a\ncondition precedent to arbitration in an already-binding\narbitration contract (normally a matter for arbitrators to\ninterpret), but a substantive condition on Argentina’s con­\nsent to arbitration and thus on the contract’s formation\nin the first place (normally something for courts to inter­\npret). It reads the whole of Article 8 as a “unilateral\nstanding offer” to arbitrate that Argentina and the United\nKingdom each extends to investors of the other country.\nPost, at 9 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). And it says that the\nlocal litigation requirement is one of the essential “ ‘terms\nin which the offer was made.’ ” Post, at 6 (quoting Eliason\nv. Henshaw, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 228 (1819); emphasis deleted).\n   While it is possible to read the provision in this way,\ndoing so is not consistent with our case law interpreting\nsimilar provisions appearing in ordinary arbitration con­\ntracts. See Part III, supra. Consequently, interpreting\nthe provision in such a manner would require us to treat\ntreaties as warranting a different kind of analysis. And\nthe dissent does so without supplying any different set of\ngeneral principles that might guide that analysis. That is\na matter of some concern in a world where foreign invest­\nment and related arbitration treaties increasingly matter.\n   Even were we to ignore our ordinary contract princi­\nples, however, we would not take the dissent’s view. As\nwe have explained, the local litigation provision on its face\nconcerns arbitration’s timing, not the Treaty’s effective\ndate; or whom its arbitration clause binds; or whether that\narbitration clause covers a certain kind of dispute. Cf.\nGranite Rock, 561 U. S., at 296–303 (ratification date);\nFirst Options, 514 U. S., at 941, 943–947 (parties); AT&T\nTechnologies, 475 U. S., at 651 (kind of dispute). The\ndissent points out that Article 8(2)(a) “does not simply\nrequire the parties to wait for 18 months before proceeding\nto arbitration,” but instructs them to do something—to\n“submit their claims for adjudication.” Post, at 8. That is\n16       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncorrect. But the something they must do has no direct\nimpact on the resolution of their dispute, for as we previ­\nously pointed out, Article 8 provides that only the decision\nof the arbitrators (who need not give weight to the local\ncourt’s decision) will be “final and binding.” Art. 8(4). The\nprovision, at base, is a claims-processing rule. And the\ndissent’s efforts to imbue it with greater significance fall\nshort.\n  The treatises to which the dissent refers also fail to\nsupport its position. Post, at 3, 6. Those authorities pri­\nmarily describe how an offer to arbitrate in an investment\ntreaty can be accepted, such as through an investor’s filing\nof a notice of arbitration. See J. Salacuse, The Law of\nInvestment Treaties 381 (2010); Schreuer, Consent to\nArbitration, in The Oxford Handbook of International\nInvestment Law 830, 836–837 (P. Muchlinski, F. Ortino, &\nC. Schreuer eds. 2008); Dugan, Investor-State Arbitration,\nat 221–222. They do not endorse the dissent’s reading of\nthe local litigation provision or of provisions like it.\n  To the contrary, the bulk of international authority\nsupports our view that the provision functions as a purely\nprocedural precondition to arbitrate. See 1 G. Born, In­\nternational Commercial Arbitration 842 (2009) (“A sub­\nstantial body of arbitral authority from investor-state\ndisputes concludes that compliance with procedural mecha­\nnisms in an arbitration agreement (or bilateral investment\ntreaty) is not ordinarily a jurisdictional prerequisite”);\nBrief for Professors and Practitioners of Arbitration Law\nas Amici Curiae 12–16 (to assume the parties intended\nde novo review of the provision by a court “is likely to\nset United States courts on a collision course with the\ninternational regime embodied in thousands of [bilateral\ninvestment treaties]”). See also Schreuer, Consent to\nArbitration, supra, at 846–848 (“clauses of this kind . . .\ncreat[e] a considerable burden to the party seeking arbi­\ntration with little chance of advancing the settlement of\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe dispute,” and “the most likely effect of a clause of this\nkind is delay and additional cost”).\n  In sum, we agree with the dissent that a sovereign’s\nconsent to arbitration is important. We also agree that\nsovereigns can condition their consent to arbitrate by\nwriting various terms into their bilateral investment\ntreaties. Post, at 9–10. But that is not the issue. The\nquestion is whether the parties intended to give courts or\narbitrators primary authority to interpret and apply a\nthreshold provision in an arbitration contract—when the\ncontract is silent as to the delegation of authority. We\nhave already explained why we believe that where, as\nhere, the provision resembles a claims-processing re­\nquirement and is not a requirement that affects the arbi­\ntration contract’s validity or scope, we presume that the\nparties (even if they are sovereigns) intended to give that\nauthority to the arbitrators. See Parts III, IV–A and\nIV–B, supra.\n                              V\n   Argentina correctly argues that it is nonetheless en­\ntitled to court review of the arbitrators’ decision to excuse\nBG Group’s noncompliance with the litigation require­\nment, and to take jurisdiction over the dispute. It asks us\nto provide that review, and it argues that even if the proper\nstandard is “a [h]ighly [d]eferential” one, it should still\nprevail. Brief for Respondent 50. Having the relevant\nmaterials before us, we shall provide that review. But we\ncannot agree with Argentina that the arbitrators “ ‘exceed­\ned their powers’ ” in concluding they had jurisdiction. Ibid.\n(quoting 9 U. S. C. §10(a)(4)).\n   The arbitration panel made three relevant determinations:\n   (1) “As a matter of treaty interpretation,” the local\nlitigation provision “cannot be construed as an absolute\nimpediment to arbitration,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 165a;\n18        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   (2) Argentina enacted laws that “hindered” “recourse to\nthe domestic judiciary” by those “whose rights were alleg­\nedly affected by the emergency measures,” id., at 165a–\n166a; that sought “to prevent any judicial interference\nwith the emergency legislation,” id., at 169a; and that\n“excluded from the renegotiation process” for public ser­\nvice contracts “any licensee seeking judicial redress,” ibid.;\n   (3) under these circumstances, it would be “absurd and\nunreasonable” to read Article 8 as requiring an investor to\nbring its grievance to a domestic court before arbitrating.\nId., at 166a.\n   The first determination lies well within the arbitrators’\ninterpretive authority. Construing the local litigation\nprovision as an “absolute” requirement would mean Ar­\ngentina could avoid arbitration by, say, passing a law that\nclosed down its court system indefinitely or that prohibit­\ned investors from using its courts. Such an interpretation\nruns contrary to a basic objective of the investment treaty.\nNor does Argentina argue for an absolute interpretation.\n   As to the second determination, Argentina does not\nargue that the facts set forth by the arbitrators are incor­\nrect. Thus, we accept them as valid.\n   The third determination is more controversial. Argen­\ntina argues that neither the 180-day suspension of courts’\nissuances of final judgments nor its refusal to allow liti­\ngants (and those in arbitration) to use its contract renego­\ntiation process, taken separately or together, warrants\nsuspending or waiving the local litigation requirement.\nWe would not necessarily characterize these actions as\nrendering a domestic court-exhaustion requirement “ab­\nsurd and unreasonable,” but at the same time we cannot\nsay that the arbitrators’ conclusions are barred by the\nTreaty. The arbitrators did not “ ‘stra[y] from interpreta­\ntion and application of the agreement’ ” or otherwise “ ‘ef­\nfectively “dispens[e]” ’ ” their “ ‘own brand of . . . justice.’ ”\nStolt-Nielsen S.

Ante, at 8, 14. Importantly,\nin reaching this conclusion, the Court acknowledges that\n“the treaty before us does not state that the local litiga-\ntion requirement is a ‘condition of consent’ to arbitration.”\nAnte, at 12. The Court thus wisely “leave[s] for another\nday the question of interpreting treaties that refer to\n‘conditions of consent’ explicitly.” Ibid. I join the Court’s\nopinion on the understanding that it does not, in fact, de-\ncide this issue.\n   I write separately because, in the absence of this express\nreservation, the opinion might be construed otherwise.\nThe Court appears to suggest in dictum that a decision by\ntreaty parties to describe a condition as one on their con-\nsent to arbitrate “is unlikely to be conclusive” in deciding\nwhether the parties intended for the condition to be re-\nsolved by a court. Ante, at 11.

REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nsary; it may also be incorrect. It is far from clear that a\ntreaty’s express use of the term “consent” to describe a\nprecondition to arbitration should not be conclusive in the\nanalysis. We have held, for instance, that “a gateway\ndispute about whether the parties are bound by a given\narbitration clause raises a ‘question of arbitrability’ for a\ncourt to decide.” Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,\n537 U. S. 79, 84 (2002). And a party plainly cannot be\nbound by an arbitration clause to which it does not con-\nsent. See Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S. 287,\n299 (2010) (“Arbitration is strictly ‘a matter of consent’ ”\n(quoting Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trust-\nees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479\n(1989)).\n    Consent is especially salient in the context of a bilateral\ninvestment treaty, where the treaty is not an already\nagreed-upon arbitration provision between known parties,\nbut rather a nation state’s standing offer to arbitrate with\nan amorphous class of private investors. In this setting, a\nnation-state might reasonably wish to condition its con-\nsent to arbitrate with a previously unspecified investor\ncounterparty on the investor’s compliance with a require-\nment that might be deemed “purely procedural” in the\nordinary commercial context, ante, at 9. Moreover, as THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE notes, “[i]t is no trifling matter” for a sov-\nereign nation to “subject itself to international arbitration”\nproceedings, so we should “not presume that any country\n. . . takes that step lightly.” Post, at 9 (dissenting opinion).\n    Consider, for example, the United States-Korea Free\nTrade Agreement, which as the Court recognizes, ante, at\n12–13, includes a provision explicitly entitled “Conditions\nand Limitations on Consent of Each Party.” Art. 11.18,\nFeb. 10, 2011. That provision declares that “[n]o claim\nmay be submitted to arbitration” unless a claimant first\nwaives its “right to initiate or continue before any admin-\nistrative tribunal or court . . . any proceeding with respect\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

If this waiver con-\ndition were to appear without the “consent” label in a\nbinding arbitration agreement between two commercial\nparties, one might characterize it as the kind of procedural\n“ ‘condition precedent to arbitrability’ ” that we presume\nparties intend for arbitrators to decide. Howsam, 537\nU. S., at 85. But where the waiver requirement is ex-\npressly denominated a “condition on consent” in an interna-\ntional investment treaty, the label could well be critical in\ndetermining whether the states party to the treaty in-\ntended the condition to be reviewed by a court. After all, a\ndispute as to consent is “the starkest form of the question\nwhether the parties have agreed to arbitrate.” Post, at 13.\nAnd we ordinarily presume that parties intend for courts\nto decide such questions because otherwise arbitrators\nmight “force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they\nreasonably would have thought a judge . . . would decide.”\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938,\n945 (1995).\n    Accordingly, if the local litigation requirement at issue\nhere were labeled a condition on the treaty parties’ “con-\nsent” to arbitrate, that would in my view change the anal-\nysis as to whether the parties intended the requirement to\nbe interpreted by a court or an arbitrator. As it is, how-\never, all parties agree that the local litigation requirement\nis not so denominated. See Agreement for the Promotion\nand Protection of Investments, Art. 8(2), Dec. 11, 1990,\n1765 U. N. T. S. 38. Nor is there compelling reason to\nsuppose the parties silently intended to make it a condi-\ntion on their consent to arbitrate, given that a local court’s\ndecision is of no legal significance under the treaty, ante,\nat 8–9, and given that the entire purpose of bilateral\ninvestment agreements is to “reliev[e] investors of any\nconcern that the courts of host countries will be unable or\nunwilling to provide justice in a dispute between a for-\n4          BG GROUP PLC v.

See\nEastern Airlines, Inc. v. Floyd, 499 U. S. 530, 546 (1991)\n(treaty interpretation can be informed by parties’ posten-\nactment conduct).*\n   In light of these many indicators that Argentina and the\nUnited Kingdom did not intend the local litigation re-\nquirement to be a condition on their consent to arbitrate,\nand on the understanding that the Court does not pass on\n——————\n   *The dissent discounts the significance of Argentina’s conduct on the\nground that Argentina “object[ed] to the [arbitral] tribunal’s jurisdic-\ntion to hear the dispute.” Post, at 16, n. 2. But there is a difference\nbetween arguing that a party has failed to comply with a procedural\ncondition in a binding arbitration agreement and arguing that noncom-\npliance with the condition negates the existence of consent to arbitrate\nin the first place. Argentina points to no evidence that its objection was\nof the consent variety. This omission is notable because Argentina\nknew how to phrase its arguments before the arbitrators in terms of\nconsent; it argued separately that it had not consented to arbitration\nwith BG Group on the ground that BG was not a party to the license\nunderlying the dispute. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a–186a. First\nOptions of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938 (1995), is not to the\ncontrary, as that case held that “arguing the arbitrability issue to an\narbitrator” did not constitute “clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]” evidence\nsufficient to override an indisputably applicable presumption that a\ncourt was to decide whether the parties had agreed to arbitration. Id.,\nat 944, 946. The question here, by contrast, is whether that presump-\ntion attaches to begin with—that is, whether the local litigation re-\nquirement was a condition on Argentina’s consent to arbitrate (which\nwould trigger the presumption) or a procedural condition in an already\nbinding arbitration agreement (which would not). That Argentina ap-\nparently took the latter position in arbitration is surely relevant evi-\ndence that the condition was, in fact, not one on its consent.\n                Cite as: 572 U.

The “docu­\nment before us,” of course, is nothing of the sort. It is\ninstead a treaty between two sovereign nations: the United\nKingdom and Argentina. No investor is a party to the\nagreement. Having elided this rather important fact for\nmuch of its analysis, the majority finally “relax[es] [its]\nordinary contract assumption and ask[s] whether the fact\nthat the document before us is a treaty makes a critical\ndifference to [its] analysis.” Ante, at 10. It should come as\nno surprise that, after starting down the wrong road, the\nmajority ends up at the wrong place.\n   I would start with the document that is before us and\ntake it on its own terms. That document is a bilateral\ninvestment treaty between the United Kingdom and Ar­\ngentina, in which Argentina agreed to take steps to en­\ncourage U. K. investors to invest within its borders (and\nthe United Kingdom agreed to do the same with respect to\nArgentine investors).

The Treaty does indeed contain a completed\nagreement for arbitration—between the signatory coun­\n2        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntries. Art. 9. The Treaty also includes, in Article 8, cer­\ntain provisions for resolving any disputes that might arise\nbetween a signatory country and an investor, who is not a\nparty to the agreement.\n   One such provision—completely ignored by the Court in\nits analysis—specifies that disputes may be resolved by\narbitration when the host country and an investor “have\nso agreed.” Art. 8(2)(b), 1765 U. N. T. S. 38. No one\ndoubts that, as is the normal rule, whether there was such\nan agreement is for a court, not an arbitrator, to decide.\nSee First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938,\n943–945 (1995).\n   When there is no express agreement between the host\ncountry and an investor, they must form an agreement in\nanother way, before an obligation to arbitrate arises. The\nTreaty by itself cannot constitute an agreement to arbi­\ntrate with an investor. How could it? No investor is a\nparty to that Treaty. Something else must happen to\ncreate an agreement where there was none before. Article\n8(2)(a) makes clear what that something is: An investor\nmust submit his dispute to the courts of the host country.\nAfter 18 months, or an unsatisfactory decision, the inves­\ntor may then request arbitration.\n   Submitting the dispute to the courts is thus a condition\nto the formation of an agreement, not simply a matter of\nperforming an existing agreement. Article 8(2)(a) consti­\ntutes in effect a unilateral offer to arbitrate, which an\ninvestor may accept by complying with its terms. To be\nsure, the local litigation requirement might not be abso­\nlute. In particular, an investor might argue that it was an\nimplicit aspect of the unilateral offer that he be afforded a\nreasonable opportunity to submit his dispute to the local\ncourts. Even then, however, the question would remain\nwhether the investor has managed to form an arbitration\nagreement with the host country pursuant to Article\n8(2)(a). That question under Article 8(2)(a) is—like the\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

I respectfully dissent from the\nCourt’s contrary conclusion.\n                               I\n   The majority acknowledges—but fails to heed—“the first\nprinciple that underscores all of our arbitration decisions:\nArbitration is strictly ‘a matter of consent.’ ” Granite Rock\nCo. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S. 287, 299 (2010) (quoting Volt\nInformation Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland\nStanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989)); see\nante, at 7. We have accordingly held that arbitration “is a\nway to resolve those disputes—but only those disputes—\nthat the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.”\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc., supra, at 943. The same\n“first principle” underlies arbitration pursuant to bilateral\ninvestment treaties. See C. Dugan, D. Wallace, N. Rubins,\n& B. Sabahi, Investor-State Arbitration 219 (2008)\n(Dugan); J. Salacuse, The Law of Investment Treaties 385\n(2010); K. Vandevelde, Bilateral Investment Treaties:\nHistory, Policy, and Interpretation 433 (2010). So only if\nArgentina agreed with BG Group to have an arbitrator\nresolve their dispute did the arbitrator in this case have\nany authority over the parties.\n   The majority opinion nowhere explains when and how\nArgentina agreed with BG Group to submit to arbitration.\nInstead, the majority seems to assume that, in agreeing\nwith the United Kingdom to adopt Article 8 along with the\nrest of the Treaty, Argentina thereby formed an agree­\nment with all potential U. K. investors (including BG\nGroup) to submit all investment-related disputes to arbi­\ntration. That misunderstands Article 8 and trivializes the\nsignificance to a sovereign nation of subjecting itself to\narbitration anywhere in the world, solely at the option of\nprivate parties.\n4         BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n                                A\n   The majority focuses throughout its opinion on what it\ncalls the Treaty’s “arbitration clause,” ante, at 1, but that\nprovision does not stand alone. Rather, it is only part—\nand a subordinate part at that—of a broader dispute\nresolution provision. Article 8 is thus entitled “Settlement\nof Disputes Between an Investor and the Host State,” and\nit opens without so much as mentioning arbitration. 1765\nU. N. T. S. 37. Instead it initially directs any disputing\ninvestor and signatory country (what the Treaty calls a\n“Contracting Party”) to court. When “an investor of one\nContracting Party and the other Contracting Party” have\nan investment-related dispute that has “not been amicably\nsettled,” the Treaty commands that the dispute “shall be\nsubmitted, at the request of one of the Parties to the dis­\npute, to the decision of the competent tribunal of the\nContracting Party in whose territory the investment was\nmade.” Art. 8(1), id., at 37–38. (emphasis added). This\nprovision could not be clearer: Before taking any other\nsteps, an aggrieved investor must submit its dispute with\na Contracting Party to that Contracting Party’s own\ncourts.\n   There are two routes to arbitration in Article 8(2)(a),\nand each passes through a Contracting Party’s domestic\ncourts. That is, the Treaty’s arbitration provisions in\nArticle 8(2)(a) presuppose that the parties have complied\nwith the local litigation provision in Article 8(1). Specifi­\ncally, a party may request arbitration only (1) “after a\nperiod of eighteen months has elapsed from the moment\nwhen the dispute was submitted to the competent tribunal\nof the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment\nwas made” and “the said tribunal has not given its final\ndecision,” Art. 8(2)(a)(i), id., at 38, or (2) “where the final\ndecision of the aforementioned tribunal has been made but\nthe Parties are still in dispute,” Art. 8(2)(a)(ii), ibid. Ei­\nther way, the obligation to arbitrate does not arise until\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe Contracting Party’s courts have had a first crack at\nthe dispute.\n   Article 8 provides a third route to arbitration in para­\ngraph 8(2)(b)—namely, “where the Contracting Party and\nthe investor of the other Contracting Party have so\nagreed.” Ibid. In contrast to the two routes in Article\n8(2)(a), this one does not refer to the local litigation provi­\nsion. That omission is significant. It makes clear that an\ninvestor can bypass local litigation only by obtaining the\nContracting Party’s explicit agreement to proceed directly\nto arbitration. Short of that, an investor has no choice but\nto litigate in the Contracting Party’s courts for at least\nsome period.\n   The structure of Article 8 confirms that the routes to\narbitration in paragraph (2)(a) are just as much about\neliciting a Contracting Party’s consent to arbitrate as the\nroute in paragraph 8(2)(b). Under Article 8(2)(b), the\nrequisite consent is demonstrated by a specific agreement.\nUnder Article 8(2)(a), the requisite consent is demonstrated\nby compliance with the requirement to resort to a coun­\ntry’s local courts.\n   Whereas Article 8(2)(a) is part of a completed agreement\nbetween Argentina and the United Kingdom, it constitutes\nonly a unilateral standing offer by Argentina with respect\nto U. K. investors—an offer to submit to arbitration where\ncertain conditions are met. That is how scholars under­\nstand arbitration provisions in bilateral investment trea­\nties in general. See Dugan 221; Salacuse 381; Brief for\nPractitioners and Professors of International Arbitration\nLaw as Amici Curiae 4. And it is how BG Group itself\ndescribes this investment treaty in particular. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 43 (the Treaty is a “standing offer” by Ar­\ngentina “to arbitrate”); Reply Brief 9 (same).\n   An offer must be accepted for a legally binding contract\nto be formed. And it is an “undeniable principle of the law\nof contracts, that an offer . . . by one person to another,\n6          BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nimposes no obligation upon the former, until it is accepted\nby the latter, according to the terms in which the offer\nwas made. Any qualification of, or departure from, those\nterms, invalidates the offer.” Eliason v. Henshaw, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 228 (1819) (emphasis added). This principle\napplies to international arbitration agreements just as it\ndoes to domestic commercial contracts. See Dugan 221–\n222; Salacuse 381; Schreuer, Consent to Arbitration, in\nThe Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law\n830, 836–837 (P. Muchlinski, F. Ortino, & C. Schreuer eds.\n2008).\n   By incorporating the local litigation provision in Article\n8(1), paragraph 8(2)(a) establishes that provision as a\nterm of Argentina’s unilateral offer to arbitrate. To accept\nArgentina’s offer, an investor must therefore first litigate\nits dispute in Argentina’s courts—either to a “final deci­\nsion” or for 18 months, whichever comes first. Unless the\ninvestor does so (or, perhaps, establishes a valid excuse for\nfailing to do so, as discussed below, see infra, at 17), it has\nnot accepted the terms of Argentina’s offer to arbitrate,\nand thus has not formed an arbitration agreement with\nArgentina.1\n   Although the majority suggests that the local litigation\nrequirement would not be a “condition of consent” even if\nthe Treaty explicitly called it one, the Court’s holding is\nlimited to treaties that contain no such clear statement.\nSee ante, at 11–13. But there is no reason to think that\nsuch a clear statement should be required, for we generally\ndo not require “talismanic words” in treaties. Medellín\nv. Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 521 (2008). Indeed, another arbi-\ntral tribunal concluded that the local litigation require­\n\n——————\n    1 To\n       be clear, the only question is whether BG Group formed an arbi­\ntration agreement with Argentina.

J., dissenting\n\nment was a condition on Argentina’s consent to arbitrate\ndespite the absence of the sort of clear statement appar­\nently contemplated by the majority. See ICS Inspection &\nControl Servs. Ltd. v. Argentine Republic, PCA Case No.\n2010–9, Award on Jurisdiction, ¶262 (Feb. 10, 2012). Still\nother tribunals have reached the same conclusion with\nregard to similar litigation requirements in other Argen­\ntine bilateral investment treaties. See Daimler Financial\nServs. AG v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/\n05/1, Award, ¶¶193, 194 (Aug. 22, 2012); Wintershall\nAktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No.\nARB/04/14, Award, ¶116 (Dec. 8, 2008).\n   In the face of this authority, the majority quotes a trea­\ntise for the proposition that “ ‘[a] substantial body of arbi­\ntral authority from investor-state disputes concludes that\ncompliance with procedural mechanisms in an arbitration\nagreement (or bilateral investment treaty) is not ordinarily\na jurisdictional prerequisite.’ ” Ante, at 16 (quoting 1 G.\nBorn, International Commercial Arbitration 842 (2009)).\nBut that simply restates the question. The whole issue is\nwhether the local litigation requirement is a mere “proce­\ndural mechanism” or instead a condition on Argentina’s\nconsent to arbitrate.\n   BG Group concedes that other terms of Article 8(1)\nconstitute conditions on Argentina’s consent to arbitrate,\neven though they are not expressly labeled as such. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 57 (“You have to be a U. K. investor, you\nhave to have a treaty claim, you have to be suing another\nparty to the treaty. And if those aren’t true, then there is\nno arbitration agreement” (emphasis added)). The Court\ndoes not explain why the only other term—the litigation\nrequirement—should be viewed differently.\n   Nor does the majority’s reading accord with ordinary\ncontract law, which treats language such as the word\n“after” in Article 8(2)(a)(i) as creating conditions, even\nthough such language may not constitute a “clear state­\n8        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nment.” See 13 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §38:16 (4th\ned. 2013). The majority seems to regard the local litiga­\ntion requirement as a condition precedent to performance\nof the contract, rather than a condition precedent to for­\nmation of the contract. Ante, at 8–9; see 13 Lord §§38:4,\n38:7. But that cannot be. Prior to the fulfillment of\nthe local litigation requirement, there was no contract be­\ntween Argentina and BG Group to be performed. The\nTreaty is not such an agreement, since BG Group is of\ncourse not a party to the Treaty. Neither the majority nor\nBG Group contends that the agreement is under Article\n8(2)(b), the provision that applies “where the Contracting\nParty and the investor of the other Contracting Party have\nso agreed.” An arbitration agreement must be formed, and\nArticle 8(2)(a) spells out how an investor may do that: by\nsubmitting the dispute to local courts for 18 months or\nuntil a decision is rendered.\n   Moreover, the Treaty’s local litigation requirement\ncertainly does not resemble “time limits, notice, laches,\nestoppel,” or the other kinds of provisions that are typically\ntreated as conditions on the performance of an arbitra-\ntion agreement, rather than prerequisites to formation.\nRevised Uniform Arbitration Act of 2000 §6(c), Comment\n2, 7 U. L. A. 26 (2009). Unlike a time limit for submitting\na claim to arbitration, see Howsam v. Dean Witter Rey­\nnolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 85 (2002), the litigation require­\nment does not simply regulate the timing of arbitration.\nAs the majority recognizes, ante, at 15–16, the provision\ndoes not simply require the parties to wait for 18 months\nbefore proceeding to arbitration, but instead requires them\nto submit their claims for adjudication during that period.\nAnd unlike a mandatory pre-arbitration grievance proce­\ndure, see John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U. S.\n543, 556–559 (1964), the litigation requirement sends the\nparties to court—and not just any court, but a court of the\nhost country.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   The law of international arbitration and domestic con­\ntract law lead to the same conclusion: Because paragraph\n(2)(a) of Article 8 constitutes only a unilateral standing\noffer by the Contracting Parties to each other’s investors\nto submit to arbitration under certain conditions, an in­\nvestor cannot form an arbitration agreement with a Con­\ntracting Party under the Treaty until the investor accepts\nthe actual terms of the Contracting Party’s offer. Absent a\nvalid excuse, that means litigating its dispute in the Con­\ntracting Party’s courts to a “final decision” or, barring\nthat, for at least 18 months.\n                                B\n   The nature of the obligations a sovereign incurs in\nagreeing to arbitrate with a private party confirms that\nthe local litigation requirement is a condition on a signatory\ncountry’s consent to arbitrate, and not merely a condi-\ntion on performance of a pre-existing arbitration agree­\nment. There are good reasons for any sovereign to condi­\ntion its consent to arbitrate disputes on investors’ first\nlitigating their claims in the country’s own courts for a\nspecified period. It is no trifling matter for a sovereign\nnation to subject itself to suit by private parties; we do not\npresume that any country—including our own—takes that\nstep lightly. Cf. United States v. Bormes, 568 U. S. ___,\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 4) (Congress must “unequivocally\nexpress[ ]” its intent to waive the sovereign immunity of\nthe United States (quoting United States v. Nordic Village,\nInc., 503 U. S. 30, 33 (1992); internal quotation marks\nomitted)). But even where a sovereign nation has subjected\nitself to suit in its own courts, it is quite another thing\nfor it to subject itself to international arbitration. Indeed,\n“[g]ranting a private party the right to bring an action\nagainst a sovereign state in an international tribunal\nregarding an investment dispute is a revolutionary inno­\nvation” whose “uniqueness and power should not be over­\n10       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nlooked.” Salacuse 137. That is so because of both the\nprocedure and substance of investor-state arbitration.\n   Procedurally, paragraph (3) of Article 8 designates the\nArbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on\nInternational Trade Law (UNCITRAL) as the default rules\ngoverning the arbitration. Those rules authorize the\nSecretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration\nat The Hague to designate an “appointing authority”\nwho—absent agreement by the parties—can select the sole\narbitrator (or, in the case of a three-member tribunal, the\npresiding arbitrator, where the arbitrators nominated by\neach of the parties cannot agree on a presiding arbitrator).\nUNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Arts. 6, 8–9 (rev. 2010 ed.).\nThe arbitrators, in turn, select the site of the arbitration\n(again, absent an agreement by the parties) and enjoy\nbroad discretion in conducting the proceedings. Arts. 18,\n17(1).\n   Substantively, by acquiescing to arbitration, a state\npermits private adjudicators to review its public policies\nand effectively annul the authoritative acts of its legisla­\nture, executive, and judiciary. See Salacuse 355; G. Van\nHarten, Investment Treaty Arbitration and Public Law\n65–67 (2007). Consider the dispute that gave rise to this\ncase: Before the arbitral tribunal, BG Group challenged\nmultiple sovereign acts of the Argentine Government\ntaken after the Argentine economy collapsed in 2001—in\nparticular, Emergency Law 25,561, which converted dollar­\ndenominated tariffs into peso-denominated tariffs at a\nrate of one Argentine peso to one U.

Under\nArticle 8, a Contracting Party grants to private adjudica­\ntors not necessarily of its own choosing, who can meet\nliterally anywhere in the world, a power it typically re­\nserves to its own courts, if it grants it at all: the power to\nsit in judgment on its sovereign acts. Given these stakes,\none would expect the United Kingdom and Argentina to\nhave taken particular care in specifying the limited cir­\ncumstances in which foreign investors can trigger the\nTreaty’s arbitration process. And that is precisely what\nthey did in Article 8(2)(a), requiring investors to afford a\ncountry’s own courts an initial opportunity to review the\ncountry’s enactments and assess the country’s compliance\nwith its international obligations. Contrast this with\nArticle 9, which provides for arbitration between the\nsignatory countries of disputes under the Treaty without\nany preconditions. Argentina and the United Kingdom\nconsidered arbitration with particular foreign investors to\nbe different in kind and to require special limitations on\nits use.\n   The majority regards the local litigation requirement as\ntoothless simply because the Treaty does not require an\narbitrator to “give substantive weight to the local court’s\ndeterminations on the matters at issue between the par­\nties,” ante, at 9; see also ante, at 15–16, but instead pro­\nvides that “[t]he arbitration decision shall be final and\nbinding on both Parties,” Art. 8(4), 1765 U. N. T. S. 38.\nWhile it is true that an arbitrator need not defer to an\nArgentine court’s judgment in an investor dispute, that\ndoes not deprive the litigation requirement of practical\nimport. Most significant, the Treaty provides that an\n“arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance\nwith . . . the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the\ndispute.” Art. 8(4), ibid. I doubt that a tribunal would\ngive no weight to an Argentine court’s authoritative con­\n12       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nstruction of Argentine law, rendered in the same dispute,\njust because it might not be formally bound to adopt that\ninterpretation.\n   The local litigation requirement can also help to narrow\nthe range of issues that remain in controversy by the time\na dispute reaches arbitration. It might even induce the\nparties to settle along the way. And of course the investor\nmight prevail, which could likewise obviate the need for\narbitration. Cf. McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185,\n195 (1969).\n   None of this should be interpreted as defending Argen­\ntina’s history when it comes to international investment.\nThat history may prompt doubt that requiring an investor\nto resort to that country’s courts in the first instance will\nbe of any use. But that is not the question. Argentina and\nthe United Kingdom reached agreement on the term at\nissue. The question can therefore be rephrased as whether\nit makes sense for either Contracting Party to insist on\nresort to its courts before being compelled to arbitrate\nanywhere in the world before arbitrators not of its choos­\ning. The foregoing reasons may seem more compelling\nwhen viewed apart from the particular episode before us.\n                              II\n   Given that the Treaty’s local litigation requirement is a\ncondition on consent to arbitrate, it follows that whether\nan investor has complied with that requirement is a ques­\ntion a court must decide de novo, rather than an issue for\nthe arbitrator to decide subject only to the most deferen­\ntial judicial review. See, e.g., Adams v. Suozzi, 433 F. 3d\n220, 226–228 (CA2 2005) (holding that compliance with a\ncondition on formation of an arbitration agreement is for a\ncourt, rather than an arbitrator, to determine). The logic\nis simple: Because an arbitrator’s authority depends on\nthe consent of the parties, the arbitrator should not as a\nrule be able to decide for himself whether the parties have\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nin fact consented. Where the consent of the parties is in\nquestion, “reference of the gateway dispute to the court\navoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that\nthey may well not have agreed to arbitrate.” Howsam, 537\nU. S., at 83–84.\n  This principle is at the core of our arbitration prece­\ndents. See Granite Rock Co., 561 U. S., at 299 (questions\nconcerning “the formation of the parties’ arbitration\nagreement” are for a court to decide de novo). The same\nprinciple is also embedded in the law of international\ncommercial arbitration. 2 Born 2792 (“[W]here one party\ndenies ever having made an arbitration agreement or\nchallenges the validity of any such agreement, . . . the\npossibility of de novo judicial review of any jurisdictional\naward in an annulment action is logically necessary”). See\nalso Restatement (Third) of U. S. Law of International\nCommercial Arbitration §4–12(d)(1) (Tent. Draft No. 2,\nApr. 16, 2012) (“a court determines de novo . . . the exist­\nence of the arbitration agreement”).\n  Indeed, the question in this case—whether BG Group\naccepted the terms of Argentina’s offer to arbitrate—\npresents an issue of contract formation, which is the\nstarkest form of the question whether the parties have\nagreed to arbitrate. In Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds,\nInc., we gave two examples of questions going to consent,\nwhich are for courts to decide: “whether the parties are\nbound by a given arbitration clause” and “whether an\narbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies\nto a particular type of controversy.” 537 U. S., at 84. In\nboth examples, there is at least a putative arbitration\nagreement between the parties to the dispute. The only\nquestion is whether the agreement is truly binding or\nwhether it covers the specific dispute. Here, by contrast,\nthe question is whether the arbitration clause in the Treaty\nbetween the United Kingdom and Argentina gives rise\nto an arbitration agreement between Argentina and BG\n14       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nGroup at all. Cf. ante, at 2 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in\npart) (“Consent is especially salient in the context of a\nbilateral investment treaty, where the treaty is not an\nalready agreed-upon arbitration provision between known\nparties”).\n   The majority never even starts down this path. Instead,\nit preempts the whole inquiry by concluding that the local\nlitigation requirement is the kind of “procedural precondi­\ntion” that parties typically expect an arbitrator to enforce.\nAnte, at 8–9. But as explained, the local litigation re­\nquirement does not resemble the requirements we have\npreviously deemed presumptively procedural. See supra,\nat 8. It does not merely regulate the timing of arbitration.\nNor does it send the parties to non-judicial forms of dis­\npute resolution.\n   More importantly, all of the cases cited by the majority\nas examples of procedural provisions involve commercial\ncontracts between two private parties. See ante, at 9.\nNone of them—not a single one—involves an agreement\nbetween sovereigns or an agreement to which the person\nseeking to compel arbitration is not even a party. The\nTreaty, of course, is both of those things.\n   The majority suggests that I am applying “a different\nkind of analysis” from that governing private commercial\ncontracts, just because what is at issue is a treaty. Ante,\nat 15. That is not so: The key point, which the majority\nnever addresses, is that there is no completed agreement\nwhatsoever between Argentina and BG Group. An agree­\nment must be formed, and whether that has happened\nis—as it is in the private commercial contract context—an\nissue for a court to decide. See supra, at 12–13.\n   The distinction between questions concerning consent to\narbitrate and mere procedural requirements under an\nexisting arbitration agreement can at times seem elusive.\nEven the most mundane procedural requirement can be\nrecast as a condition on consent as a matter of technical\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nlogic. But it should be clear by now that the Treaty’s local\nlitigation requirement is not a mere formality—not in\nBuenos Aires, not in London. And while it is true that\n“parties often submit important matters to arbitration,”\nante, at 11, our precedents presume that parties do not\nsubmit to arbitration the most important matter of all:\nwhether they are subject to an agreement to arbitrate in\nthe first place.\n   Nor has the majority pointed to evidence that would\nrebut this presumption by showing that Argentina “ ‘clearly\nand unmistakably’ ” intended to have an arbitrator en­\nforce the litigation requirement. Howsam, supra, at 83\n(quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications\nWorkers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986)). As the majority\nnotes, ante, at 14, the Treaty incorporates certain arbitra­\ntion rules that, in turn, authorize arbitrators to determine\ntheir own jurisdiction over a dispute. See Art. 8(3). But\nthose rules do not operate until a dispute is properly\nbefore an arbitral tribunal, and of course the whole ques­\ntion in this case is whether the dispute between BG Group\nand Argentina was before the arbitrators, given BG\nGroup’s failure to comply with the 18-month local litiga­\ntion requirement. As a leading treatise has explained, “[i]f\nthe parties have not validly agreed to any arbitration\nagreement at all, then they also have necessarily not\nagreed to institutional arbitration rules.” 1 Born 870. “In\nthese circumstances, provisions in institutional rules\ncannot confer any [such] authority upon an arbitral tribu­\nnal.” Ibid.\n   I also see no reason to think that arbitrators enjoy\ncomparative expertise in construing the local litigation\nrequirement. Ante, at 14. It would be one thing if that\nprovision involved the application of the arbitrators’ own\nrules, cf. Howsam, supra, at 85, or if it were “intertwined”\nwith the merits of the underlying dispute, John Wiley &\nSons, 376 U. S., at 557. Neither is true of the litigation\n16          BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nrequirement. A court can assess compliance with the\nrequirement at least as well as an arbitrator can. Given\nthe structure of Article 8 and the important interests that\nthe litigation requirement protects, it seems clear that the\nUnited Kingdom and Argentina thought the same.2\n                              III\n    Although the Court of Appeals got there by a slightly\ndifferent route, it correctly concluded that a court must\ndecide questions concerning the interpretation and appli­\ncation of the local litigation requirement de novo. 665\nF. 3d 1363, 1371–1373 (CADC 2012). At the same time,\nhowever, the court seems to have simply taken it for\ngranted that, because BG Group did not submit its dispute\nto the local courts, the arbitral award in BG Group’s favor\nwas invalid. Indeed, the court addressed the issue in a\nperfunctory paragraph at the end of its opinion and saw\n“ ‘only one possible outcome’ ”: “that BG Group was re­\nquired to commence a lawsuit in Argentina’s courts and\n\n——————\n   2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR contends that “Argentina’s conduct confirms\n\nthat the local litigation requirement is not a condition on consent, for\nrather than objecting to arbitration on the ground that there was no\nbinding arbitration agreement to begin with, Argentina actively partic­\nipated in the constitution of the arbitral panel and in the proceedings\nthat followed.” Ante, at 4 (opinion concurring in part). But as the\narbitral tribunal itself recognized, Argentina did object to the tribunal’s\njurisdiction to hear the dispute. App. to Pet. for Cert. 99a, 134a, 143a,\n161a–163a. And we have held that “merely arguing the arbitrability\nissue to an arbitrator”—say, by “filing with the arbitrators a written\nmemorandum objecting to the arbitrators’ jurisdiction”—“does not\nindicate a clear willingness to arbitrate that issue, i.e., a willingness to\nbe effectively bound by the arbitrator’s decision on that point.” First\nOptions of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 946 (1995). The\nconcurrence contends that Argentina “apparently” argued its jurisdic­\ntional objection in terms of procedure rather than consent, ante, at 4, n.,\nbut the one piece of evidence cited—a negative inference from the\narbitrator’s characterization of Argentina’s argument on a subsidiary\nissue—hardly suffices to distinguish First Options.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

AnimalFeeds Int’l\nCorp., 559 U. S. 662, 677 (2010)).\n   That conclusion is not obvious. A leading treatise has\nindicated that “[i]t is a necessary implication from [a uni­\nlateral] offer that the offeror, in addition, makes a sub­\nsidiary offer by which he or she promises to accept a\ntender of performance.” 1 Lord §5:14, at 1005. On this\nunderstanding, an offeree’s failure to comply with an\nessential condition of the unilateral offer “will not bar an\naction, if failure to comply with the condition is due to the\nofferor’s own fault.” Id., at 1005–1006.\n   It would be open to BG Group to argue before the Court\nof Appeals that this principle was incorporated into Article\n8(2)(a) as an implicit aspect of Argentina’s unilateral offer\nto arbitrate. Such an argument would find some support\nin the background principle of customary international\nlaw that a foreign individual injured by a host country\nmust ordinarily exhaust local remedies—unless doing so\nwould be “futile.” See Dugan 347–357. In any event, the\nissue would be analyzed as one of contract formation, and\ntherefore would be for the court to decide. I would accord­\ningly vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for such an inquiry.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 2655591, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/03/05/bg_group_plc_v._republic_of_argentina.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued December 2, 2013—Decided March 5, 2014\nAn investment treaty (Treaty) between the United Kingdom and Ar-\n gentina authorizes a party to submit a dispute “to the decision of the\n competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the\n investment was made,” i.e., a local court, Art. 8(1); and permits arbi-\n tration, as relevant here, “where, after a period of eighteen months\n has elapsed from the moment when the dispute was submitted to\n [that] tribunal . . . , the said tribunal has not given its final decision,”\n Art. 8(2)(a)(i).\n    Petitioner BG Group plc, a British firm, belonged to a consortium\n with a majority interest in MetroGAS, an Argentine entity awarded\n an exclusive license to distribute natural gas in Buenos Aires. At the\n time of BG Group’s investment, Argentine law provided that gas “tar-\n iffs” would be calculated in U. S. dollars and would be set at levels\n sufficient to assure gas distribution firms a reasonable return. But\n Argentina later amended the law, changing (among other things) the\n calculation basis to pesos. MetroGAS’ profits soon became losses.\n Invoking Article 8, BG Group sought arbitration, which the parties\n sited in Washington, D. C. BG Group claimed that Argentina’s new\n laws and practices violated the Treaty, which forbids the “expropria-\n tion” of investments and requires each nation to give “fair and equi-\n table treatment” to investors from the other. Argentina denied those\n claims, but also argued that the arbitrators lacked “jurisdiction” to\n hear the dispute because, as relevant here, BG Group had not com-\n plied with Article 8’s local litigation requirement. The arbitration\n panel concluded that it had jurisdiction, finding, among other things,\n that Argentina’s conduct (such as also enacting new laws that hin-\n dered recourse to its judiciary by firms in BG Group’s situation) had\n excused BG Group’s failure to comply with Article 8’s requirement.\n2            BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    On the merits, the panel found that Argentina had not expropriated\n    BG Group’s investment but had denied BG Group “fair and equitable\n    treatment.” It awarded damages to BG Group. Both sides sought re-\n    view in federal district court: BG Group to confirm the award under\n    the New York Convention and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),\n    and Argentina to vacate the award, in part on the ground that the\n    arbitrators lacked jurisdiction under the FAA. The District Court\n    confirmed the award, but the Court of Appeals for the District of Co-\n    lumbia Circuit vacated. It found that the interpretation and applica-\n    tion of Article 8’s requirement were matters for courts to decide de\n    novo, i.e., without deference to the arbitrators’ views; that the cir-\n    cumstances did not excuse BG Group’s failure to comply with the re-\n    quirement; and that BG Group had to commence a lawsuit in Argen-\n    tina’s courts and wait 18 months before seeking arbitration. Thus,\n    the court held, the arbitrators lacked authority to decide the dispute.\nHeld:\n    1. A court of the United States, in reviewing an arbitration award\n made under the Treaty, should interpret and apply “threshold” provi-\n sions concerning arbitration using the framework developed for in-\n terpreting similar provisions in ordinary contracts. Under that\n framework, the local litigation requirement is a matter for arbitra-\n tors primarily to interpret and apply. Courts should review their in-\n terpretation with deference. Pp. 6–17.\n       (a) Were the Treaty an ordinary contract, it would call for arbi-\n trators primarily to interpret and to apply the local litigation provi-\n sion. In an ordinary contract, the parties determine whether a par-\n ticular matter is primarily for arbitrators or for courts to decide. See,\n e.g., Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 582. If\n the contract is silent on the matter of who is to decide a “threshold”\n question about arbitration, courts determine the parties’ intent using\n presumptions. That is, courts presume that the parties intended\n courts to decide disputes about “arbitrability,” e.g., Howsam v. Dean\n Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 84, and arbitrators to decide dis-\n putes about the meaning and application of procedural preconditions\n for the use of arbitration, see id., at 86, including, e.g., claims of\n “waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability,” Moses H. Cone Me-\n morial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, and the\n satisfaction of, e.g., “ ‘time limits, notice, laches, [or] estoppel,’ ” How-\n sam, 537 U. S., at 85. The provision at issue is of the procedural va-\n riety. As its text and structure make clear, it determines when the\n contractual duty to arbitrate arises, not whether there is a contractu-\n al duty to arbitrate at all. Neither its language nor other language in\n Article 8 gives substantive weight to the local court’s determinations\n on the matters at issue between the parties. The litigation provision\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  is thus a claims-processing rule. It is analogous to other procedural\n  provisions found to be for arbitrators primarily to interpret and ap-\n  ply, see, e.g., ibid., and there is nothing in Article 8 or the Treaty to\n  overcome the ordinary assumption. Pp. 7–9.\n        (b) The fact that the document at issue is a treaty does not make\n  a critical difference to this analysis. A treaty is a contract between\n  nations, and its interpretation normally is a matter of determining\n  the parties’ intent. Air France v. Saks, 470 U. S. 392, 399. Where, as\n  here, a federal court is asked to interpret that intent pursuant to a\n  motion to vacate or confirm an award made under the Federal Arbi-\n  tration Act, it should normally apply the presumptions supplied by\n  American law. The presence of a condition of “consent” to arbitration\n  in a treaty likely does not warrant abandoning, or increasing the\n  complexity of, the ordinary intent-determining framework. See, e.g.,\n  Howsam, supra, at 83–85. But because this Treaty does not state\n  that the local litigation requirement is a condition of consent, the\n  Court need not resolve what the effect of any such language would be.\n  The Court need not go beyond holding that in the absence of lan-\n  guage in a treaty demonstrating that the parties intended a different\n  delegation of authority, the ordinary interpretive framework applies.\n  Pp. 10–13.\n        (c) The Treaty contains no evidence showing that the parties had\n  an intent contrary to the ordinary presumptions about who should\n  decide threshold arbitration issues. The text and structure of Article\n  8’s litigation requirement make clear that it is a procedural condition\n  precedent to arbitration. Because the ordinary presumption applies\n  and is not overcome, the interpretation and application of the provi-\n  sion are primarily for the arbitrators, and courts must review their\n  decision with considerable deference. Pp. 13–17.\n     2. While Argentina is entitled to court review (under a properly\n  deferential standard) of the arbitrators’ decision to excuse BG\n  Group’s noncompliance with the litigation requirement, that review\n  shows that the arbitrators’ determinations were lawful. Their con-\n  clusion that the litigation provision cannot be construed as an abso-\n  lute impediment to arbitration, in all cases, lies well within their in-\n  terpretative authority. Their factual findings that Argentina passed\n  laws hindering recourse to the local judiciary by firms similar to BG\n  Group are undisputed by Argentina and are accepted as valid. And\n  their conclusion that Argentina’s actions made it “absurd and unrea-\n  sonable” to read Article 8 to require an investor in BG Group’s posi-\n  tion to bring its grievance in a domestic court, before arbitrating, is\n  not barred by the Treaty.

See Agreement\nfor the Promotion and Protection of Investments, Art. 8(2),\nDec. 11, 1990, 1765 U. N. T. S. 38 (hereinafter Treaty).\nThe provision authorizes either party to submit a dispute\n“to the decision of the competent tribunal of the Contract­\ning Party in whose territory the investment was made,”\ni.e., a local court. Art. 8(1). And it provides for arbitration\n      “(i) where, after a period of eighteen months has\n      elapsed from the moment when the dispute was sub­\n      mitted to the competent tribunal . . . , the said tribu­\n      nal has not given its final decision; [or]\n      “(ii) where the final decision of the aforementioned\n      tribunal has been made but the Parties are still in\n      dispute.” Art. 8(2)(a).\nThe Treaty also entitles the parties to agree to proceed\ndirectly to arbitration.

REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspecifically the local court litigation requirement set forth\nin Article 8(2)(a). The question before us is whether a\ncourt of the United States, in reviewing an arbitration\naward made under the Treaty, should interpret and apply\nthe local litigation requirement de novo, or with the defer­\nence that courts ordinarily owe arbitration decisions. That\nis to say, who—court or arbitrator—bears primary respon­\nsibility for interpreting and applying the local litigation\nrequirement to an underlying controversy? In our view,\nthe matter is for the arbitrators, and courts must review\ntheir determinations with deference.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  In the early 1990’s, the petitioner, BG Group plc, a\nBritish firm, belonged to a consortium that bought a ma­\njority interest in an Argentine entity called MetroGAS.\nMetroGAS was a gas distribution company created by\nArgentine law in 1992, as a result of the government’s\nprivatization of its state-owned gas utility. Argentina\ndistributed the utility’s assets to new, private companies,\none of which was MetroGAS. It awarded MetroGAS a 35­\nyear exclusive license to distribute natural gas in Buenos\nAires, and it submitted a controlling interest in the com­\npany to international public tender. BG Group’s consor­\ntium was the successful bidder.\n  At about the same time, Argentina enacted statutes\nproviding that its regulators would calculate gas “tariffs”\nin U. S. dollars, and that those tariffs would be set at\nlevels sufficient to assure gas distribution firms, such as\nMetroGAS, a reasonable return.\n  In 2001 and 2002, Argentina, faced with an economic\ncrisis, enacted new laws. Those laws changed the basis for\ncalculating gas tariffs from dollars to pesos, at a rate of\none peso per dollar. The exchange rate at the time was\nroughly three pesos to the dollar. The result was that\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMetroGAS’ profits were quickly transformed into losses.\nBG Group believed that these changes (and several others)\nviolated the Treaty; Argentina believed the contrary.\n                             B\n   In 2003, BG Group, invoking Article 8 of the Treaty,\nsought arbitration. The parties appointed arbitrators;\nthey agreed to site the arbitration in Washington, D. C.;\nand between 2004 and 2006, the arbitrators decided mo­\ntions, received evidence, and conducted hearings. BG\nGroup essentially claimed that Argentina’s new laws and\nregulatory practices violated provisions in the Treaty\nforbidding the “expropriation” of investments and requir­\ning that each nation give “fair and equitable treatment” to\ninvestors from the other. Argentina denied these claims,\nwhile also arguing that the arbitration tribunal lacked\n“jurisdiction” to hear the dispute. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n143a–144a, 214a–218a, 224a–232a. According to Argen­\ntina, the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction because: (1) BG\nGroup was not a Treaty-protected “investor”; (2) BG\nGroup’s interest in MetroGAS was not a Treaty-protected\n“investment”; and (3) BG Group initiated arbitration\nwithout first litigating its claims in Argentina’s courts,\ndespite Article 8’s requirement. Id., at 143a–171a. In\nArgentina’s view, “failure by BG to bring its grievance to\nArgentine courts for 18 months renders its claims in this\narbitration inadmissible.” Id., at 162a.\n   In late December 2007, the arbitration panel reached a\nfinal decision. It began by determining that it had “juris­\ndiction” to consider the merits of the dispute. In support\nof that determination, the tribunal concluded that BG\nGroup was an “investor,” that its interest in MetroGAS\namounted to a Treaty-protected “investment,” and that\nArgentina’s own conduct had waived, or excused, BG\nGroup’s failure to comply with Article 8’s local litigation\nrequirement. Id., at 99a, 145a, 161a, 171a. The panel\n4        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npointed out that in 2002, the President of Argentina had\nissued a decree staying for 180 days the execution of its\ncourts’ final judgments (and injunctions) in suits claiming\nharm as a result of the new economic measures. Id., at\n166a–167a. In addition, Argentina had established a\n“renegotiation process” for public service contracts, such\nas its contract with MetroGAS, to alleviate the negative\nimpact of the new economic measures. Id., at 129a, 131a.\nBut Argentina had simultaneously barred from participa­\ntion in that “process” firms that were litigating against\nArgentina in court or in arbitration. Id., at 168a–171a.\nThese measures, while not making litigation in Argenti­\nna’s courts literally impossible, nonetheless “hindered”\nrecourse “to the domestic judiciary” to the point where the\nTreaty implicitly excused compliance with the local litiga­\ntion requirement. Id., at 165. Requiring a private party\nin such circumstances to seek relief in Argentina’s courts\nfor 18 months, the panel concluded, would lead to “absurd\nand unreasonable result[s].” Id., at 166a.\n   On the merits, the arbitration panel agreed with Argen­\ntina that it had not “expropriate[d]” BG Group’s invest­\nment, but also found that Argentina had denied BG Group\n“fair and equitable treatment.” Id., at 222a–223a, 240a–\n242a. It awarded BG Group $185 million in damages. Id.,\nat 297a.\n                             C\n   In March 2008, both sides filed petitions for review in\nthe District Court for the District of Columbia. BG Group\nsought to confirm the award under the New York Conven­\ntion and the Federal Arbitration Act. See Convention on\nthe Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral\nAwards, Art. IV, June 10, 1958, 21 U. S. T. 2519, T. I. A. S.\nNo. 6997 (New York Convention) (providing that a party\nmay apply “for recognition and enforcement” of an arbitral\naward subject to the Convention); 9 U. S. C. §§204, 207\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(providing that a party may move “for an order confirming\n[an arbitral] award” in a federal court of the “place desig­\nnated in the agreement as the place of arbitration if such\nplace is within the United States”). Argentina sought to\nvacate the award in part on the ground that the arbitra­\ntors lacked jurisdiction. See §10(a)(4) (a federal court may\nvacate an arbitral award “where the arbitrators exceeded\ntheir powers”).\n   The District Court denied Argentina’s claims and con­\nfirmed the award. 764 F. Supp. 2d 21 (DC 2011); 715 F.\nSupp. 2d 108 (DC 2010). But the Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit reversed. 665 F. 3d 1363\n(2012). In the appeals court’s view, the interpretation and\napplication of Article 8’s local litigation requirement was a\nmatter for courts to decide de novo, i.e., without deference\nto the views of the arbitrators. The Court of Appeals then\nwent on to hold that the circumstances did not excuse BG\nGroup’s failure to comply with the requirement. Rather,\nBG Group must “commence a lawsuit in Argentina’s\ncourts and wait eighteen months before filing for arbitra­\ntion.” Id., at 1373. Because BG Group had not done so,\nthe arbitrators lacked authority to decide the dispute.\nAnd the appeals court ordered the award vacated. Ibid.\n   BG Group filed a petition for certiorari. Given the\nimportance of the matter for international commercial ar­\nbitration, we granted the petition. See, e.g., K. Van­\ndevelde, Bilateral Investment Treaties: History, Policy\n& Interpretation 430–432 (2010) (explaining that dispute­\nresolution mechanisms allowing for arbitration are a\n“critical element” of modern day bilateral investment\ntreaties); C. Dugan, D. Wallace, N. Rubins, & B. Sabahi,\nInvestor-State Arbitration 51–52, 117–120 (2008) (refer­\nring to the large number of investment treaties that pro­\nvide for arbitration, and explaining that some also impose\nprearbitration requirements such as waiting periods,\namicable negotiations, or exhaustion of local remedies).\n6        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                             II\n   As we have said, the question before us is who—court or\narbitrator—bears primary responsibility for interpreting\nand applying Article 8’s local court litigation provision.\nPut in terms of standards of judicial review, should a\nUnited States court review the arbitrators’ interpretation\nand application of the provision de novo, or with the defer­\nence that courts ordinarily show arbitral decisions on\nmatters the parties have committed to arbitration? Com­\npare, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514\nU. S. 938, 942 (1995) (example where a “court makes up\nits mind about [an issue] independently” because the\nparties did not agree it should be arbitrated), with Oxford\nHealth Plans LLC v. Sutter, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip\nop., at 4) (example where a court defers to arbitrators\nbecause the parties “ ‘bargained for’ ” arbitral resolution of\nthe question (quoting Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.\nMine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000))). See also Hall\nStreet Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576,\n588 (2008) (on matters committed to arbitration, the Fed­\neral Arbitration Act provides for “just the limited review\nneeded to maintain arbitration’s essential virtue of resolv­\ning disputes straightaway” and to prevent it from be­\ncoming “merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and\ntime-consuming judicial review process” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); Eastern Associated Coal Corp., supra, at\n62 (where parties send a matter to arbitration, a court will\nset aside the “arbitrator’s interpretation of what their\nagreement means only in rare instances”).\n   In answering the question, we shall initially treat the\ndocument before us as if it were an ordinary contract\nbetween private parties. Were that so, we conclude, the\nmatter would be for the arbitrators. We then ask whether\nthe fact that the document in question is a treaty makes a\ncritical difference. We conclude that it does not.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n   Where ordinary contracts are at issue, it is up to the\nparties to determine whether a particular matter is pri­\nmarily for arbitrators or for courts to decide. See, e.g.,\nSteelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574,\n582 (1960) (“[A]rbitration is a matter of contract and a\nparty cannot be required to submit to arbitration any\ndispute which he has not agreed so to submit”). If\nthe contract is silent on the matter of who primarily\nis to decide “threshold” questions about arbitration,\ncourts determine the parties’ intent with the help of\npresumptions.\n   On the one hand, courts presume that the parties intend\ncourts, not arbitrators, to decide what we have called\ndisputes about “arbitrability.” These include questions\nsuch as “whether the parties are bound by a given arbitra­\ntion clause,” or “whether an arbitration clause in a con­\ncededly binding contract applies to a particular type of\ncontroversy.” Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537\nU. S. 79, 84 (2002); accord, Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters,\n561 U. S. 287, 299–300 (2010) (disputes over “formation of\nthe parties’ arbitration agreement” and “its enforceability\nor applicability to the dispute” at issue are “matters . . .\nthe court must resolve” (internal quotation marks omit­\nted)). See First Options, supra, at 941, 943–947 (court\nshould decide whether an arbitration clause applied to a\nparty who “had not personally signed” the document con­\ntaining it); AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications\nWorkers, 475 U. S. 643, 651 (1986) (court should decide\nwhether a particular labor-management layoff dispute fell\nwithin the arbitration clause of a collective-bargaining\ncontract); John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U. S.\n543, 546–548 (1964) (court should decide whether an\narbitration provision survived a corporate merger). See\ngenerally AT&T Technologies, supra, at 649 (“Unless the\nparties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise, the\n8        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be\ndecided by the court, not the arbitrator”).\n   On the other hand, courts presume that the parties\nintend arbitrators, not courts, to decide disputes about the\nmeaning and application of particular procedural precon­\nditions for the use of arbitration. See Howsam, supra, at\n86 (courts assume parties “normally expect a forum-based\ndecisionmaker to decide forum-specific procedural gateway\nmatters” (emphasis added)). These procedural matters\ninclude claims of “waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbi­\ntrability.” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury\nConstr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25 (1983). And they include the\nsatisfaction of “ ‘prerequisites such as time limits, notice,\nlaches, estoppel, and other conditions precedent to an\nobligation to arbitrate.’ ” Howsam, supra, at 85 (quoting\nthe Revised Uniform Arbitration Act of 2000 §6, Comment\n2, 7 U. L. A. 13 (Supp. 2002); emphasis deleted). See also\n§6(c) (“An arbitrator shall decide whether a condition\nprecedent to arbitrability has been fulfilled”); §6, Com­\nment 2 (explaining that this rule reflects “the holdings of\nthe vast majority of state courts” and collecting cases).\n   The provision before us is of the latter, procedural,\nvariety. The text and structure of the provision make\nclear that it operates as a procedural condition precedent\nto arbitration. It says that a dispute “shall be submitted\nto international arbitration” if “one of the Parties so re­\nquests,” as long as “a period of eighteen months has\nelapsed” since the dispute was “submitted” to a local tri­\nbunal and the tribunal “has not given its final decision.”\nArt. 8(2). It determines when the contractual duty to\narbitrate arises, not whether there is a contractual duty to\narbitrate at all. Cf. 13 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts\n§38:7, pp. 435, 437; §38:4, p. 422 (4th ed. 2013) (a “condi­\ntion precedent” determines what must happen before “a\ncontractual duty arises” but does not “make the validity of\nthe contract depend on its happening” (emphasis added)).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNeither does this language or other language in Article 8\ngive substantive weight to the local court’s determinations\non the matters at issue between the parties. To the con­\ntrary, Article 8 provides that only the “arbitration decision\nshall be final and binding on both Parties.” Art. 8(4). The\nlitigation provision is consequently a purely procedural\nrequirement—a claims-processing rule that governs when\nthe arbitration may begin, but not whether it may occur or\nwhat its substantive outcome will be on the issues in\ndispute.\n   Moreover, the local litigation requirement is highly\nanalogous to procedural provisions that both this Court\nand others have found are for arbitrators, not courts,\nprimarily to interpret and to apply. See Howsam, supra,\nat 85 (whether a party filed a notice of arbitration within\nthe time limit provided by the rules of the chosen arbitral\nforum “is a matter presumptively for the arbitrator, not\nfor the judge”); John Wiley, supra, at 555–557 (same, in\nrespect to a mandatory prearbitration grievance procedure\nthat involved holding two conferences). See also Dialysis\nAccess Center, LLC v. RMS Lifeline, Inc., 638 F. 3d 367,\n383 (CA1 2011) (same, in respect to a prearbitration “good\nfaith negotiations” requirement); Lumbermens Mut. Cas.\nCo. v. Broadspire Management Servs., Inc., 623 F. 3d 476,\n481 (CA7 2010) (same, in respect to a prearbitration filing\nof a “Disagreement Notice”).\n   Finally, as we later discuss in more detail, see infra,\nat 13–14, we can find nothing in Article 8 or elsewhere in\nthe Treaty that might overcome the ordinary assumption.\nIt nowhere demonstrates a contrary intent as to the dele­\ngation of decisional authority between judges and arbitra­\ntors. Thus, were the document an ordinary contract, it\nwould call for arbitrators primarily to interpret and to\napply the local litigation provision.\n10       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                            IV \n\n                             A\n\n   We now relax our ordinary contract assumption and ask\nwhether the fact that the document before us is a treaty\nmakes a critical difference to our analysis. The Solicitor\nGeneral argues that it should. He says that the local\nlitigation provision may be “a condition on the State’s\nconsent to enter into an arbitration agreement.” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 25. He adds that courts\nshould “review de novo the arbitral tribunal’s resolution of\nobjections based on an investor’s non-compliance” with\nsuch a condition. Ibid. And he recommends that we\nremand this case to the Court of Appeals to determine\nwhether the court-exhaustion provision is such a condi­\ntion. Id., at 31–33.\n                              1\n   We do not accept the Solicitor General’s view as applied\nto the treaty before us. As a general matter, a treaty is\na contract, though between nations. Its interpretation\nnormally is, like a contract’s interpretation, a matter of\ndetermining the parties’ intent. Air France v. Saks, 470\nU. S. 392, 399 (1985) (courts must give “the specific words\nof the treaty a meaning consistent with the shared expec­\ntations of the contracting parties”); Sullivan v. Kidd, 254\nU. S. 433, 439 (1921) (“[T]reaties are to be interpreted\nupon the principles which govern the interpretation of\ncontracts in writing between individuals, and are to be\nexecuted in the utmost good faith, with a view to making\neffective the purposes of the high contracting parties”);\nWright v. Henkel, 190 U. S. 40, 57 (1903) (“Treaties must\nreceive a fair interpretation, according to the intention of\nthe contracting parties”). And where, as here, a federal\ncourt is asked to interpret that intent pursuant to a mo­\ntion to vacate or confirm an award made in the United\nStates under the Federal Arbitration Act, it should nor­\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmally apply the presumptions supplied by American law.\nSee New York Convention, Art. V(1)(e) (award may be “set\naside or suspended by a competent authority of the coun­\ntry in which, or under the law of which, that award was\nmade”); Vandevelde, Bilateral Investment Treaties, at 446\n(arbitral awards pursuant to treaties are “subject to re­\nview under the arbitration law of the state where the\narbitration takes place”); Dugan, Investor-State Arbitra­\ntion, at 636 (“[T]he national courts and the law of the legal\nsitus of arbitration control a losing party’s attempt to set\naside [an] award”).\n   The Solicitor General does not deny that the presump­\ntion discussed in Part III, supra (namely, the presumption\nthat parties intend procedural preconditions to arbitration\nto be resolved primarily by arbitrators), applies both to\nordinary contracts and to similar provisions in treaties\nwhen those provisions are not also “conditions of consent.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25–27. And,\nwhile we respect the Government’s views about the proper\ninterpretation of treaties, e.g., Abbott v. Abbott, 560 U. S.\n1, 15 (2010), we have been unable to find any other au­\nthority or precedent suggesting that the use of the “con­\nsent” label in a treaty should make a critical difference\nin discerning the parties’ intent about whether courts\nor arbitrators should interpret and apply the relevant\nprovision.\n   We are willing to assume with the Solicitor General that\nthe appearance of this label in a treaty can show that the\nparties, or one of them, thought the designated matter\nquite important. But that is unlikely to be conclusive. For\nparties often submit important matters to arbitration.\nAnd the word “consent” could be attached to a highly\nprocedural precondition to arbitration, such as a waiting\nperiod of several months, which the parties are unlikely to\nhave intended that courts apply without saying so. See,\ne.g., Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protec­\n12       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of Investments, Art. 9, Netherlands-Slovenia, Sept.\n24, 1996, Netherlands T. S. No. 296 (“Each Contracting\nParty hereby consents to submit any dispute . . . which\nthey can not [sic] solve amicably within three months . . .\nto the International Center for Settlement of Disputes\nfor settlement by conciliation or arbitration”), online at\nwww.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/besluiten/\n2006/10/17/slovenia.html (all Internet materials as visited\non Feb. 28, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case\nfile); Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of\nInvestments, Art. 8(1), United Kingdom-Egypt, June 11,\n1975, 14 I. L. M. 1472 (“Each Contracting Party hereby\nconsents to submit” a dispute to arbitration if “agreement\ncannot be reached within three months between the par­\nties”). While we leave the matter open for future argu­\nment, we do not now see why the presence of the term\n“consent” in a treaty warrants abandoning, or increasing\nthe complexity of, our ordinary intent-determining frame­\nwork. See Howsam, 537 U. S., at 83–85; First Options,\n514 U. S., at 942–945; John Wiley, 376 U. S., at 546–549,\n555–559.\n                              2\n   In any event, the treaty before us does not state that the\nlocal litigation requirement is a “condition of consent” to\narbitration. Thus, we need not, and do not, go beyond\nholding that, in the absence of explicit language in a\ntreaty demonstrating that the parties intended a different\ndelegation of authority, our ordinary interpretive frame­\nwork applies. We leave for another day the question of\ninterpreting treaties that refer to “conditions of consent”\nexplicitly. See, e.g., United States-Korea Free Trade\nAgreement, Art. 11.18, Feb. 10, 2011 (provision entitled\n“Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party”\nand providing that “[n]o claim may be submitted to\narbitration under this Section” unless the claimant\nwaives in writing “any right” to press his claim before\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

L. M. 643–644 (pro-\nviding that each party’s “[c]onsent to [a]rbitration” is\nconditioned on fulfillment of certain “procedures,” one of\nwhich is a waiver by an investor of his right to litigate the\nclaim being arbitrated). See also 2012 U. S. Model Bilat­\neral Investment Treaty, Art. 26 (entitled “Conditions and\nlimitations on Consent of Each Party”), online at\nwww.ustr.gov / sites / default / files / BIT % 20text%20for%\n20ACIEP%20Meeting.pdf. And we apply our ordinary\npresumption that the interpretation and application of\nprocedural provisions such as the provision before us are\nprimarily for the arbitrators.\n                              B\n  A treaty may contain evidence that shows the parties\nhad an intent contrary to our ordinary presumptions\nabout who should decide threshold issues related to arbi­\ntration. But the treaty before us does not sho w any such\ncontrary intention. We concede that the local litigation\nrequirement appears in ¶(1) of Article 8, while the Article\ndoes not mention arbitration until the subsequent para­\ngraph, ¶(2). Moreover, a requirement that a party ex­\nhaust its remedies in a country’s domestic courts before\nseeking to arbitrate may seem particularly important to a\ncountry offering protections to foreign investors. And the\nplacing of an important matter prior to any mention of\narbitration at least arguably suggests an intent by Argen­\ntina, the United Kingdom, or both, to have courts rather\nthan arbitrators apply the litigation requirement.\n  These considerations, however, are outweighed by oth­\ners. As discussed supra, at 8–9, the text and structure of\nthe litigation requirement set forth in Article 8 make clear\nthat it is a procedural condition precedent to arbitration—\n14       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na sequential step that a party must follow before giving\nnotice of arbitration. The Treaty nowhere says that the\nprovision is to operate as a substantive condition on the\nformation of the arbitration contract, or that it is a matter\nof such elevated importance that it is to be decided by\ncourts. International arbitrators are likely more familiar\nthan are judges with the expectations of foreign investors\nand recipient nations regarding the operation of the provi­\nsion. See Howsam, supra, at 85 (comparative institutional\nexpertise a factor in determining parties’ likely intent).\nAnd the Treaty itself authorizes the use of international\narbitration associations, the rules of which provide that\narbitrators shall have the authority to interpret provisions\nof this kind. Art. 8(3) (providing that the parties may\nrefer a dispute to the International Centre for the Settle­\nment of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or to arbitrators\nappointed pursuant to the arbitration rules of the United\nNations Commission on International Trade Law\n(UNCITRAL)); accord, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Art.\n23(1) (rev. 2010 ed.) (“[A]rbitral tribunal shall have the\npower to rule on its own jurisdiction”); ICSID Convention,\nRegulations and Rules, Art. 41(1) (2006 ed.) (“Tribunal\nshall be the judge of its own competence”). Cf. Howsam,\nsupra, at 85 (giving weight to the parties’ incorporation of\nthe National Association of Securities Dealers’ Code of\nArbitration into their contract, which provided for similar\narbitral authority, as evidence that they intended arbitra­\ntors to “interpret and apply the NASD time limit rule”).\n  The upshot is that our ordinary presumption applies\nand it is not overcome. The interpretation and application\nof the local litigation provision is primarily for the arbi­\ntrators. Reviewing courts cannot review their decision\nde novo. Rather, they must do so with considerable\ndeference.\n                              C\n  The dissent interprets Article 8’s local litigation provi­\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion differently. In its view, the provision sets forth not a\ncondition precedent to arbitration in an already-binding\narbitration contract (normally a matter for arbitrators to\ninterpret), but a substantive condition on Argentina’s con­\nsent to arbitration and thus on the contract’s formation\nin the first place (normally something for courts to inter­\npret). It reads the whole of Article 8 as a “unilateral\nstanding offer” to arbitrate that Argentina and the United\nKingdom each extends to investors of the other country.\nPost, at 9 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). And it says that the\nlocal litigation requirement is one of the essential “ ‘terms\nin which the offer was made.’ ” Post, at 6 (quoting Eliason\nv. Henshaw, 4 Wheat. 225, 228 (1819); emphasis deleted).\n   While it is possible to read the provision in this way,\ndoing so is not consistent with our case law interpreting\nsimilar provisions appearing in ordinary arbitration con­\ntracts. See Part III, supra. Consequently, interpreting\nthe provision in such a manner would require us to treat\ntreaties as warranting a different kind of analysis. And\nthe dissent does so without supplying any different set of\ngeneral principles that might guide that analysis. That is\na matter of some concern in a world where foreign invest­\nment and related arbitration treaties increasingly matter.\n   Even were we to ignore our ordinary contract princi­\nples, however, we would not take the dissent’s view. As\nwe have explained, the local litigation provision on its face\nconcerns arbitration’s timing, not the Treaty’s effective\ndate; or whom its arbitration clause binds; or whether that\narbitration clause covers a certain kind of dispute. Cf.\nGranite Rock, 561 U. S., at 296–303 (ratification date);\nFirst Options, 514 U. S., at 941, 943–947 (parties); AT&T\nTechnologies, 475 U. S., at 651 (kind of dispute). The\ndissent points out that Article 8(2)(a) “does not simply\nrequire the parties to wait for 18 months before proceeding\nto arbitration,” but instructs them to do something—to\n“submit their claims for adjudication.” Post, at 8. That is\n16       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncorrect. But the something they must do has no direct\nimpact on the resolution of their dispute, for as we previ­\nously pointed out, Article 8 provides that only the decision\nof the arbitrators (who need not give weight to the local\ncourt’s decision) will be “final and binding.” Art. 8(4). The\nprovision, at base, is a claims-processing rule. And the\ndissent’s efforts to imbue it with greater significance fall\nshort.\n  The treatises to which the dissent refers also fail to\nsupport its position. Post, at 3, 6. Those authorities pri­\nmarily describe how an offer to arbitrate in an investment\ntreaty can be accepted, such as through an investor’s filing\nof a notice of arbitration. See J. Salacuse, The Law of\nInvestment Treaties 381 (2010); Schreuer, Consent to\nArbitration, in The Oxford Handbook of International\nInvestment Law 830, 836–837 (P. Muchlinski, F. Ortino, &\nC. Schreuer eds. 2008); Dugan, Investor-State Arbitration,\nat 221–222. They do not endorse the dissent’s reading of\nthe local litigation provision or of provisions like it.\n  To the contrary, the bulk of international authority\nsupports our view that the provision functions as a purely\nprocedural precondition to arbitrate. See 1 G. Born, In­\nternational Commercial Arbitration 842 (2009) (“A sub­\nstantial body of arbitral authority from investor-state\ndisputes concludes that compliance with procedural mecha­\nnisms in an arbitration agreement (or bilateral investment\ntreaty) is not ordinarily a jurisdictional prerequisite”);\nBrief for Professors and Practitioners of Arbitration Law\nas Amici Curiae 12–16 (to assume the parties intended\nde novo review of the provision by a court “is likely to\nset United States courts on a collision course with the\ninternational regime embodied in thousands of [bilateral\ninvestment treaties]”). See also Schreuer, Consent to\nArbitration, supra, at 846–848 (“clauses of this kind . . .\ncreat[e] a considerable burden to the party seeking arbi­\ntration with little chance of advancing the settlement of\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

We also agree that\nsovereigns can condition their consent to arbitrate by\nwriting various terms into their bilateral investment\ntreaties. Post, at 9–10. But that is not the issue. The\nquestion is whether the parties intended to give courts or\narbitrators primary authority to interpret and apply a\nthreshold provision in an arbitration contract—when the\ncontract is silent as to the delegation of authority. We\nhave already explained why we believe that where, as\nhere, the provision resembles a claims-processing re­\nquirement and is not a requirement that affects the arbi­\ntration contract’s validity or scope, we presume that the\nparties (even if they are sovereigns) intended to give that\nauthority to the arbitrators. See Parts III, IV–A and\nIV–B, supra.\n                              V\n   Argentina correctly argues that it is nonetheless en­\ntitled to court review of the arbitrators’ decision to excuse\nBG Group’s noncompliance with the litigation require­\nment, and to take jurisdiction over the dispute. It asks us\nto provide that review, and it argues that even if the proper\nstandard is “a [h]ighly [d]eferential” one, it should still\nprevail. Brief for Respondent 50. Having the relevant\nmaterials before us, we shall provide that review. But we\ncannot agree with Argentina that the arbitrators “ ‘exceed­\ned their powers’ ” in concluding they had jurisdiction. Ibid.\n(quoting 9 U. S. C. §10(a)(4)).\n   The arbitration panel made three relevant determinations:\n   (1) “As a matter of treaty interpretation,” the local\nlitigation provision “cannot be construed as an absolute\nimpediment to arbitration,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 165a;\n18        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   (2) Argentina enacted laws that “hindered” “recourse to\nthe domestic judiciary” by those “whose rights were alleg­\nedly affected by the emergency measures,” id., at 165a–\n166a; that sought “to prevent any judicial interference\nwith the emergency legislation,” id., at 169a; and that\n“excluded from the renegotiation process” for public ser­\nvice contracts “any licensee seeking judicial redress,” ibid.;\n   (3) under these circumstances, it would be “absurd and\nunreasonable” to read Article 8 as requiring an investor to\nbring its grievance to a domestic court before arbitrating.\nId., at 166a.\n   The first determination lies well within the arbitrators’\ninterpretive authority. Construing the local litigation\nprovision as an “absolute” requirement would mean Ar­\ngentina could avoid arbitration by, say, passing a law that\nclosed down its court system indefinitely or that prohibit­\ned investors from using its courts. Such an interpretation\nruns contrary to a basic objective of the investment treaty.\nNor does Argentina argue for an absolute interpretation.\n   As to the second determination, Argentina does not\nargue that the facts set forth by the arbitrators are incor­\nrect. Thus, we accept them as valid.\n   The third determination is more controversial. Argen­\ntina argues that neither the 180-day suspension of courts’\nissuances of final judgments nor its refusal to allow liti­\ngants (and those in arbitration) to use its contract renego­\ntiation process, taken separately or together, warrants\nsuspending or waiving the local litigation requirement.\nWe would not necessarily characterize these actions as\nrendering a domestic court-exhaustion requirement “ab­\nsurd and unreasonable,” but at the same time we cannot\nsay that the arbitrators’ conclusions are barred by the\nTreaty. The arbitrators did not “ ‘stra[y] from interpreta­\ntion and application of the agreement’ ” or otherwise “ ‘ef­\nfectively “dispens[e]” ’ ” their “ ‘own brand of . . . justice.’ ”\nStolt-Nielsen S.

Ante, at 8, 14. Importantly,\nin reaching this conclusion, the Court acknowledges that\n“the treaty before us does not state that the local litiga-\ntion requirement is a ‘condition of consent’ to arbitration.”\nAnte, at 12. The Court thus wisely “leave[s] for another\nday the question of interpreting treaties that refer to\n‘conditions of consent’ explicitly.” Ibid. I join the Court’s\nopinion on the understanding that it does not, in fact, de-\ncide this issue.\n   I write separately because, in the absence of this express\nreservation, the opinion might be construed otherwise.\nThe Court appears to suggest in dictum that a decision by\ntreaty parties to describe a condition as one on their con-\nsent to arbitrate “is unlikely to be conclusive” in deciding\nwhether the parties intended for the condition to be re-\nsolved by a court. Ante, at 11. Because this suggestion is\nunnecessary to decide the case and is in tension with the\nCourt’s explicit reservation of the issue, I join the opinion\nof the Court with the exception of Part IV–A–1.\n   The Court’s dictum on this point is not only unneces-\n2         BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nsary; it may also be incorrect. It is far from clear that a\ntreaty’s express use of the term “consent” to describe a\nprecondition to arbitration should not be conclusive in the\nanalysis. We have held, for instance, that “a gateway\ndispute about whether the parties are bound by a given\narbitration clause raises a ‘question of arbitrability’ for a\ncourt to decide.” Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,\n537 U. S. 79, 84 (2002). And a party plainly cannot be\nbound by an arbitration clause to which it does not con-\nsent. See Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S. 287,\n299 (2010) (“Arbitration is strictly ‘a matter of consent’ ”\n(quoting Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trust-\nees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479\n(1989)).\n    Consent is especially salient in the context of a bilateral\ninvestment treaty, where the treaty is not an already\nagreed-upon arbitration provision between known parties,\nbut rather a nation state’s standing offer to arbitrate with\nan amorphous class of private investors. In this setting, a\nnation-state might reasonably wish to condition its con-\nsent to arbitrate with a previously unspecified investor\ncounterparty on the investor’s compliance with a require-\nment that might be deemed “purely procedural” in the\nordinary commercial context, ante, at 9. Moreover, as THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE notes, “[i]t is no trifling matter” for a sov-\nereign nation to “subject itself to international arbitration”\nproceedings, so we should “not presume that any country\n. . . takes that step lightly.” Post, at 9 (dissenting opinion).\n    Consider, for example, the United States-Korea Free\nTrade Agreement, which as the Court recognizes, ante, at\n12–13, includes a provision explicitly entitled “Conditions\nand Limitations on Consent of Each Party.” Art. 11.18,\nFeb. 10, 2011. That provision declares that “[n]o claim\nmay be submitted to arbitration” unless a claimant first\nwaives its “right to initiate or continue before any admin-\nistrative tribunal or court . . . any proceeding with respect\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nto any measure alleged to constitute a breach” under\nanother provision of the treaty. Ibid. If this waiver con-\ndition were to appear without the “consent” label in a\nbinding arbitration agreement between two commercial\nparties, one might characterize it as the kind of procedural\n“ ‘condition precedent to arbitrability’ ” that we presume\nparties intend for arbitrators to decide. Howsam, 537\nU. S., at 85. But where the waiver requirement is ex-\npressly denominated a “condition on consent” in an interna-\ntional investment treaty, the label could well be critical in\ndetermining whether the states party to the treaty in-\ntended the condition to be reviewed by a court. After all, a\ndispute as to consent is “the starkest form of the question\nwhether the parties have agreed to arbitrate.” Post, at 13.\nAnd we ordinarily presume that parties intend for courts\nto decide such questions because otherwise arbitrators\nmight “force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they\nreasonably would have thought a judge . . . would decide.”\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938,\n945 (1995).\n    Accordingly, if the local litigation requirement at issue\nhere were labeled a condition on the treaty parties’ “con-\nsent” to arbitrate, that would in my view change the anal-\nysis as to whether the parties intended the requirement to\nbe interpreted by a court or an arbitrator. As it is, how-\never, all parties agree that the local litigation requirement\nis not so denominated. See Agreement for the Promotion\nand Protection of Investments, Art. 8(2), Dec. 11, 1990,\n1765 U. N. T. S. 38. Nor is there compelling reason to\nsuppose the parties silently intended to make it a condi-\ntion on their consent to arbitrate, given that a local court’s\ndecision is of no legal significance under the treaty, ante,\nat 8–9, and given that the entire purpose of bilateral\ninvestment agreements is to “reliev[e] investors of any\nconcern that the courts of host countries will be unable or\nunwilling to provide justice in a dispute between a for-\n4          BG GROUP PLC v.

See\nEastern Airlines, Inc. v. Floyd, 499 U. S. 530, 546 (1991)\n(treaty interpretation can be informed by parties’ posten-\nactment conduct).*\n   In light of these many indicators that Argentina and the\nUnited Kingdom did not intend the local litigation re-\nquirement to be a condition on their consent to arbitrate,\nand on the understanding that the Court does not pass on\n——————\n   *The dissent discounts the significance of Argentina’s conduct on the\nground that Argentina “object[ed] to the [arbitral] tribunal’s jurisdic-\ntion to hear the dispute.” Post, at 16, n. 2. But there is a difference\nbetween arguing that a party has failed to comply with a procedural\ncondition in a binding arbitration agreement and arguing that noncom-\npliance with the condition negates the existence of consent to arbitrate\nin the first place. Argentina points to no evidence that its objection was\nof the consent variety. This omission is notable because Argentina\nknew how to phrase its arguments before the arbitrators in terms of\nconsent; it argued separately that it had not consented to arbitration\nwith BG Group on the ground that BG was not a party to the license\nunderlying the dispute. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a–186a. First\nOptions of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938 (1995), is not to the\ncontrary, as that case held that “arguing the arbitrability issue to an\narbitrator” did not constitute “clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]” evidence\nsufficient to override an indisputably applicable presumption that a\ncourt was to decide whether the parties had agreed to arbitration. Id.,\nat 944, 946. The question here, by contrast, is whether that presump-\ntion attaches to begin with—that is, whether the local litigation re-\nquirement was a condition on Argentina’s consent to arbitrate (which\nwould trigger the presumption) or a procedural condition in an already\nbinding arbitration agreement (which would not). That Argentina ap-\nparently took the latter position in arbitration is surely relevant evi-\ndence that the condition was, in fact, not one on its consent.\n                Cite as: 572 U.

The “docu­\nment before us,” of course, is nothing of the sort. It is\ninstead a treaty between two sovereign nations: the United\nKingdom and Argentina. No investor is a party to the\nagreement. Having elided this rather important fact for\nmuch of its analysis, the majority finally “relax[es] [its]\nordinary contract assumption and ask[s] whether the fact\nthat the document before us is a treaty makes a critical\ndifference to [its] analysis.” Ante, at 10. It should come as\nno surprise that, after starting down the wrong road, the\nmajority ends up at the wrong place.\n   I would start with the document that is before us and\ntake it on its own terms. That document is a bilateral\ninvestment treaty between the United Kingdom and Ar­\ngentina, in which Argentina agreed to take steps to en­\ncourage U. K. investors to invest within its borders (and\nthe United Kingdom agreed to do the same with respect to\nArgentine investors). Agreement for the Promotion and\nProtection of Investments, Dec. 11, 1990, 1765 U. N. T. S.\n33 (Treaty). The Treaty does indeed contain a completed\nagreement for arbitration—between the signatory coun­\n2        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntries. Art. 9. The Treaty also includes, in Article 8, cer­\ntain provisions for resolving any disputes that might arise\nbetween a signatory country and an investor, who is not a\nparty to the agreement.\n   One such provision—completely ignored by the Court in\nits analysis—specifies that disputes may be resolved by\narbitration when the host country and an investor “have\nso agreed.” Art. 8(2)(b), 1765 U. N. T. S. 38. No one\ndoubts that, as is the normal rule, whether there was such\nan agreement is for a court, not an arbitrator, to decide.\nSee First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938,\n943–945 (1995).\n   When there is no express agreement between the host\ncountry and an investor, they must form an agreement in\nanother way, before an obligation to arbitrate arises. The\nTreaty by itself cannot constitute an agreement to arbi­\ntrate with an investor. How could it? No investor is a\nparty to that Treaty. Something else must happen to\ncreate an agreement where there was none before. Article\n8(2)(a) makes clear what that something is: An investor\nmust submit his dispute to the courts of the host country.\nAfter 18 months, or an unsatisfactory decision, the inves­\ntor may then request arbitration.\n   Submitting the dispute to the courts is thus a condition\nto the formation of an agreement, not simply a matter of\nperforming an existing agreement. Article 8(2)(a) consti­\ntutes in effect a unilateral offer to arbitrate, which an\ninvestor may accept by complying with its terms. To be\nsure, the local litigation requirement might not be abso­\nlute. In particular, an investor might argue that it was an\nimplicit aspect of the unilateral offer that he be afforded a\nreasonable opportunity to submit his dispute to the local\ncourts. Even then, however, the question would remain\nwhether the investor has managed to form an arbitration\nagreement with the host country pursuant to Article\n8(2)(a). That question under Article 8(2)(a) is—like the\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

We have accordingly held that arbitration “is a\nway to resolve those disputes—but only those disputes—\nthat the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.”\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc., supra, at 943. The same\n“first principle” underlies arbitration pursuant to bilateral\ninvestment treaties. See C. Dugan, D. Wallace, N. Rubins,\n& B. Sabahi, Investor-State Arbitration 219 (2008)\n(Dugan); J. Salacuse, The Law of Investment Treaties 385\n(2010); K. Vandevelde, Bilateral Investment Treaties:\nHistory, Policy, and Interpretation 433 (2010). So only if\nArgentina agreed with BG Group to have an arbitrator\nresolve their dispute did the arbitrator in this case have\nany authority over the parties.\n   The majority opinion nowhere explains when and how\nArgentina agreed with BG Group to submit to arbitration.\nInstead, the majority seems to assume that, in agreeing\nwith the United Kingdom to adopt Article 8 along with the\nrest of the Treaty, Argentina thereby formed an agree­\nment with all potential U. K. investors (including BG\nGroup) to submit all investment-related disputes to arbi­\ntration. That misunderstands Article 8 and trivializes the\nsignificance to a sovereign nation of subjecting itself to\narbitration anywhere in the world, solely at the option of\nprivate parties.\n4         BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n                                A\n   The majority focuses throughout its opinion on what it\ncalls the Treaty’s “arbitration clause,” ante, at 1, but that\nprovision does not stand alone. Rather, it is only part—\nand a subordinate part at that—of a broader dispute\nresolution provision. Article 8 is thus entitled “Settlement\nof Disputes Between an Investor and the Host State,” and\nit opens without so much as mentioning arbitration. 1765\nU. N. T. S. 37. Instead it initially directs any disputing\ninvestor and signatory country (what the Treaty calls a\n“Contracting Party”) to court. When “an investor of one\nContracting Party and the other Contracting Party” have\nan investment-related dispute that has “not been amicably\nsettled,” the Treaty commands that the dispute “shall be\nsubmitted, at the request of one of the Parties to the dis­\npute, to the decision of the competent tribunal of the\nContracting Party in whose territory the investment was\nmade.” Art. 8(1), id., at 37–38. (emphasis added). This\nprovision could not be clearer: Before taking any other\nsteps, an aggrieved investor must submit its dispute with\na Contracting Party to that Contracting Party’s own\ncourts.\n   There are two routes to arbitration in Article 8(2)(a),\nand each passes through a Contracting Party’s domestic\ncourts. That is, the Treaty’s arbitration provisions in\nArticle 8(2)(a) presuppose that the parties have complied\nwith the local litigation provision in Article 8(1). Specifi­\ncally, a party may request arbitration only (1) “after a\nperiod of eighteen months has elapsed from the moment\nwhen the dispute was submitted to the competent tribunal\nof the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment\nwas made” and “the said tribunal has not given its final\ndecision,” Art. 8(2)(a)(i), id., at 38, or (2) “where the final\ndecision of the aforementioned tribunal has been made but\nthe Parties are still in dispute,” Art. 8(2)(a)(ii), ibid. Ei­\nther way, the obligation to arbitrate does not arise until\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe Contracting Party’s courts have had a first crack at\nthe dispute.\n   Article 8 provides a third route to arbitration in para­\ngraph 8(2)(b)—namely, “where the Contracting Party and\nthe investor of the other Contracting Party have so\nagreed.” Ibid. In contrast to the two routes in Article\n8(2)(a), this one does not refer to the local litigation provi­\nsion. That omission is significant. It makes clear that an\ninvestor can bypass local litigation only by obtaining the\nContracting Party’s explicit agreement to proceed directly\nto arbitration. Short of that, an investor has no choice but\nto litigate in the Contracting Party’s courts for at least\nsome period.\n   The structure of Article 8 confirms that the routes to\narbitration in paragraph (2)(a) are just as much about\neliciting a Contracting Party’s consent to arbitrate as the\nroute in paragraph 8(2)(b). Under Article 8(2)(b), the\nrequisite consent is demonstrated by a specific agreement.\nUnder Article 8(2)(a), the requisite consent is demonstrated\nby compliance with the requirement to resort to a coun­\ntry’s local courts.\n   Whereas Article 8(2)(a) is part of a completed agreement\nbetween Argentina and the United Kingdom, it constitutes\nonly a unilateral standing offer by Argentina with respect\nto U. K. investors—an offer to submit to arbitration where\ncertain conditions are met. That is how scholars under­\nstand arbitration provisions in bilateral investment trea­\nties in general. See Dugan 221; Salacuse 381; Brief for\nPractitioners and Professors of International Arbitration\nLaw as Amici Curiae 4. And it is how BG Group itself\ndescribes this investment treaty in particular. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 43 (the Treaty is a “standing offer” by Ar­\ngentina “to arbitrate”); Reply Brief 9 (same).\n   An offer must be accepted for a legally binding contract\nto be formed. And it is an “undeniable principle of the law\nof contracts, that an offer . . . by one person to another,\n6          BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nimposes no obligation upon the former, until it is accepted\nby the latter, according to the terms in which the offer\nwas made. Any qualification of, or departure from, those\nterms, invalidates the offer.” Eliason v. Henshaw, 4\nWheat. 225, 228 (1819) (emphasis added). This principle\napplies to international arbitration agreements just as it\ndoes to domestic commercial contracts. See Dugan 221–\n222; Salacuse 381; Schreuer, Consent to Arbitration, in\nThe Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law\n830, 836–837 (P. Muchlinski, F. Ortino, & C. Schreuer eds.\n2008).\n   By incorporating the local litigation provision in Article\n8(1), paragraph 8(2)(a) establishes that provision as a\nterm of Argentina’s unilateral offer to arbitrate. To accept\nArgentina’s offer, an investor must therefore first litigate\nits dispute in Argentina’s courts—either to a “final deci­\nsion” or for 18 months, whichever comes first. Unless the\ninvestor does so (or, perhaps, establishes a valid excuse for\nfailing to do so, as discussed below, see infra, at 17), it has\nnot accepted the terms of Argentina’s offer to arbitrate,\nand thus has not formed an arbitration agreement with\nArgentina.1\n   Although the majority suggests that the local litigation\nrequirement would not be a “condition of consent” even if\nthe Treaty explicitly called it one, the Court’s holding is\nlimited to treaties that contain no such clear statement.\nSee ante, at 11–13. But there is no reason to think that\nsuch a clear statement should be required, for we generally\ndo not require “talismanic words” in treaties. Medellín\nv. Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 521 (2008). Indeed, another arbi-\ntral tribunal concluded that the local litigation require­\n\n——————\n    1 To\n       be clear, the only question is whether BG Group formed an arbi­\ntration agreement with Argentina. To say that BG Group never formed\nsuch an agreement is not to call into question the validity of its various\ncommercial agreements with Argentina.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nment was a condition on Argentina’s consent to arbitrate\ndespite the absence of the sort of clear statement appar­\nently contemplated by the majority. See ICS Inspection &\nControl Servs. Ltd. v. Argentine Republic, PCA Case No.\n2010–9, Award on Jurisdiction, ¶262 (Feb. 10, 2012). Still\nother tribunals have reached the same conclusion with\nregard to similar litigation requirements in other Argen­\ntine bilateral investment treaties. See Daimler Financial\nServs. AG v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/\n05/1, Award, ¶¶193, 194 (Aug. 22, 2012); Wintershall\nAktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No.\nARB/04/14, Award, ¶116 (Dec. 8, 2008).\n   In the face of this authority, the majority quotes a trea­\ntise for the proposition that “ ‘[a] substantial body of arbi­\ntral authority from investor-state disputes concludes that\ncompliance with procedural mechanisms in an arbitration\nagreement (or bilateral investment treaty) is not ordinarily\na jurisdictional prerequisite.’ ” Ante, at 16 (quoting 1 G.\nBorn, International Commercial Arbitration 842 (2009)).\nBut that simply restates the question. The whole issue is\nwhether the local litigation requirement is a mere “proce­\ndural mechanism” or instead a condition on Argentina’s\nconsent to arbitrate.\n   BG Group concedes that other terms of Article 8(1)\nconstitute conditions on Argentina’s consent to arbitrate,\neven though they are not expressly labeled as such. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 57 (“You have to be a U. K. investor, you\nhave to have a treaty claim, you have to be suing another\nparty to the treaty. And if those aren’t true, then there is\nno arbitration agreement” (emphasis added)). The Court\ndoes not explain why the only other term—the litigation\nrequirement—should be viewed differently.\n   Nor does the majority’s reading accord with ordinary\ncontract law, which treats language such as the word\n“after” in Article 8(2)(a)(i) as creating conditions, even\nthough such language may not constitute a “clear state­\n8        BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nment.” See 13 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §38:16 (4th\ned. 2013). The majority seems to regard the local litiga­\ntion requirement as a condition precedent to performance\nof the contract, rather than a condition precedent to for­\nmation of the contract. Ante, at 8–9; see 13 Lord §§38:4,\n38:7. But that cannot be. Prior to the fulfillment of\nthe local litigation requirement, there was no contract be­\ntween Argentina and BG Group to be performed. The\nTreaty is not such an agreement, since BG Group is of\ncourse not a party to the Treaty. Neither the majority nor\nBG Group contends that the agreement is under Article\n8(2)(b), the provision that applies “where the Contracting\nParty and the investor of the other Contracting Party have\nso agreed.” An arbitration agreement must be formed, and\nArticle 8(2)(a) spells out how an investor may do that: by\nsubmitting the dispute to local courts for 18 months or\nuntil a decision is rendered.\n   Moreover, the Treaty’s local litigation requirement\ncertainly does not resemble “time limits, notice, laches,\nestoppel,” or the other kinds of provisions that are typically\ntreated as conditions on the performance of an arbitra-\ntion agreement, rather than prerequisites to formation.\nRevised Uniform Arbitration Act of 2000 §6(c), Comment\n2, 7 U. L. A. 26 (2009). Unlike a time limit for submitting\na claim to arbitration, see Howsam v. Dean Witter Rey­\nnolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 85 (2002), the litigation require­\nment does not simply regulate the timing of arbitration.\nAs the majority recognizes, ante, at 15–16, the provision\ndoes not simply require the parties to wait for 18 months\nbefore proceeding to arbitration, but instead requires them\nto submit their claims for adjudication during that period.\nAnd unlike a mandatory pre-arbitration grievance proce­\ndure, see John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U. S.\n543, 556–559 (1964), the litigation requirement sends the\nparties to court—and not just any court, but a court of the\nhost country.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   The law of international arbitration and domestic con­\ntract law lead to the same conclusion: Because paragraph\n(2)(a) of Article 8 constitutes only a unilateral standing\noffer by the Contracting Parties to each other’s investors\nto submit to arbitration under certain conditions, an in­\nvestor cannot form an arbitration agreement with a Con­\ntracting Party under the Treaty until the investor accepts\nthe actual terms of the Contracting Party’s offer. Absent a\nvalid excuse, that means litigating its dispute in the Con­\ntracting Party’s courts to a “final decision” or, barring\nthat, for at least 18 months.\n                                B\n   The nature of the obligations a sovereign incurs in\nagreeing to arbitrate with a private party confirms that\nthe local litigation requirement is a condition on a signatory\ncountry’s consent to arbitrate, and not merely a condi-\ntion on performance of a pre-existing arbitration agree­\nment. There are good reasons for any sovereign to condi­\ntion its consent to arbitrate disputes on investors’ first\nlitigating their claims in the country’s own courts for a\nspecified period. It is no trifling matter for a sovereign\nnation to subject itself to suit by private parties; we do not\npresume that any country—including our own—takes that\nstep lightly. Cf. United States v. Bormes, 568 U. S. ___,\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 4) (Congress must “unequivocally\nexpress[ ]” its intent to waive the sovereign immunity of\nthe United States (quoting United States v. Nordic Village,\nInc., 503 U. S. 30, 33 (1992); internal quotation marks\nomitted)). But even where a sovereign nation has subjected\nitself to suit in its own courts, it is quite another thing\nfor it to subject itself to international arbitration. Indeed,\n“[g]ranting a private party the right to bring an action\nagainst a sovereign state in an international tribunal\nregarding an investment dispute is a revolutionary inno­\nvation” whose “uniqueness and power should not be over­\n10       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nlooked.” Salacuse 137. That is so because of both the\nprocedure and substance of investor-state arbitration.\n   Procedurally, paragraph (3) of Article 8 designates the\nArbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on\nInternational Trade Law (UNCITRAL) as the default rules\ngoverning the arbitration. Those rules authorize the\nSecretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration\nat The Hague to designate an “appointing authority”\nwho—absent agreement by the parties—can select the sole\narbitrator (or, in the case of a three-member tribunal, the\npresiding arbitrator, where the arbitrators nominated by\neach of the parties cannot agree on a presiding arbitrator).\nUNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Arts. 6, 8–9 (rev. 2010 ed.).\nThe arbitrators, in turn, select the site of the arbitration\n(again, absent an agreement by the parties) and enjoy\nbroad discretion in conducting the proceedings. Arts. 18,\n17(1).\n   Substantively, by acquiescing to arbitration, a state\npermits private adjudicators to review its public policies\nand effectively annul the authoritative acts of its legisla­\nture, executive, and judiciary. See Salacuse 355; G. Van\nHarten, Investment Treaty Arbitration and Public Law\n65–67 (2007). Consider the dispute that gave rise to this\ncase: Before the arbitral tribunal, BG Group challenged\nmultiple sovereign acts of the Argentine Government\ntaken after the Argentine economy collapsed in 2001—in\nparticular, Emergency Law 25,561, which converted dollar­\ndenominated tariffs into peso-denominated tariffs at a\nrate of one Argentine peso to one U. S. dollar; Resolution\n308/02 and Decree 1090/02, which established a renegotia­\ntion process for public service contracts; and Decree\n214/02, which stayed for 180 days injunctions and the\nexecution of final judgments in lawsuits challenging the\neffects of the Emergency Law. Indeed, in awarding dam­\nages to BG Group, the tribunal held that the first three of\nthese enactments violated Article 2 of the Treaty. See\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 241a–242a, 305a.\n   Perhaps they did, but that is not the issue. Under\nArticle 8, a Contracting Party grants to private adjudica­\ntors not necessarily of its own choosing, who can meet\nliterally anywhere in the world, a power it typically re­\nserves to its own courts, if it grants it at all: the power to\nsit in judgment on its sovereign acts. Given these stakes,\none would expect the United Kingdom and Argentina to\nhave taken particular care in specifying the limited cir­\ncumstances in which foreign investors can trigger the\nTreaty’s arbitration process. And that is precisely what\nthey did in Article 8(2)(a), requiring investors to afford a\ncountry’s own courts an initial opportunity to review the\ncountry’s enactments and assess the country’s compliance\nwith its international obligations. Contrast this with\nArticle 9, which provides for arbitration between the\nsignatory countries of disputes under the Treaty without\nany preconditions. Argentina and the United Kingdom\nconsidered arbitration with particular foreign investors to\nbe different in kind and to require special limitations on\nits use.\n   The majority regards the local litigation requirement as\ntoothless simply because the Treaty does not require an\narbitrator to “give substantive weight to the local court’s\ndeterminations on the matters at issue between the par­\nties,” ante, at 9; see also ante, at 15–16, but instead pro­\nvides that “[t]he arbitration decision shall be final and\nbinding on both Parties,” Art. 8(4), 1765 U. N. T. S. 38.\nWhile it is true that an arbitrator need not defer to an\nArgentine court’s judgment in an investor dispute, that\ndoes not deprive the litigation requirement of practical\nimport. Most significant, the Treaty provides that an\n“arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance\nwith . . . the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the\ndispute.” Art. 8(4), ibid. I doubt that a tribunal would\ngive no weight to an Argentine court’s authoritative con­\n12       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nstruction of Argentine law, rendered in the same dispute,\njust because it might not be formally bound to adopt that\ninterpretation.\n   The local litigation requirement can also help to narrow\nthe range of issues that remain in controversy by the time\na dispute reaches arbitration. It might even induce the\nparties to settle along the way. And of course the investor\nmight prevail, which could likewise obviate the need for\narbitration. Cf. McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185,\n195 (1969).\n   None of this should be interpreted as defending Argen­\ntina’s history when it comes to international investment.\nThat history may prompt doubt that requiring an investor\nto resort to that country’s courts in the first instance will\nbe of any use. But that is not the question. Argentina and\nthe United Kingdom reached agreement on the term at\nissue. The question can therefore be rephrased as whether\nit makes sense for either Contracting Party to insist on\nresort to its courts before being compelled to arbitrate\nanywhere in the world before arbitrators not of its choos­\ning. The foregoing reasons may seem more compelling\nwhen viewed apart from the particular episode before us.\n                              II\n   Given that the Treaty’s local litigation requirement is a\ncondition on consent to arbitrate, it follows that whether\nan investor has complied with that requirement is a ques­\ntion a court must decide de novo, rather than an issue for\nthe arbitrator to decide subject only to the most deferen­\ntial judicial review. See, e.g., Adams v. Suozzi, 433 F. 3d\n220, 226–228 (CA2 2005) (holding that compliance with a\ncondition on formation of an arbitration agreement is for a\ncourt, rather than an arbitrator, to determine). The logic\nis simple: Because an arbitrator’s authority depends on\nthe consent of the parties, the arbitrator should not as a\nrule be able to decide for himself whether the parties have\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nin fact consented. Where the consent of the parties is in\nquestion, “reference of the gateway dispute to the court\navoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that\nthey may well not have agreed to arbitrate.” Howsam, 537\nU. S., at 83–84.\n  This principle is at the core of our arbitration prece­\ndents. See Granite Rock Co., 561 U. S., at 299 (questions\nconcerning “the formation of the parties’ arbitration\nagreement” are for a court to decide de novo). The same\nprinciple is also embedded in the law of international\ncommercial arbitration. 2 Born 2792 (“[W]here one party\ndenies ever having made an arbitration agreement or\nchallenges the validity of any such agreement, . . . the\npossibility of de novo judicial review of any jurisdictional\naward in an annulment action is logically necessary”). See\nalso Restatement (Third) of U. S. Law of International\nCommercial Arbitration §4–12(d)(1) (Tent. Draft No. 2,\nApr. 16, 2012) (“a court determines de novo . . . the exist­\nence of the arbitration agreement”).\n  Indeed, the question in this case—whether BG Group\naccepted the terms of Argentina’s offer to arbitrate—\npresents an issue of contract formation, which is the\nstarkest form of the question whether the parties have\nagreed to arbitrate. In Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds,\nInc., we gave two examples of questions going to consent,\nwhich are for courts to decide: “whether the parties are\nbound by a given arbitration clause” and “whether an\narbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies\nto a particular type of controversy.” 537 U. S., at 84. In\nboth examples, there is at least a putative arbitration\nagreement between the parties to the dispute. The only\nquestion is whether the agreement is truly binding or\nwhether it covers the specific dispute. Here, by contrast,\nthe question is whether the arbitration clause in the Treaty\nbetween the United Kingdom and Argentina gives rise\nto an arbitration agreement between Argentina and BG\n14       BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nGroup at all. Cf. ante, at 2 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in\npart) (“Consent is especially salient in the context of a\nbilateral investment treaty, where the treaty is not an\nalready agreed-upon arbitration provision between known\nparties”).\n   The majority never even starts down this path. Instead,\nit preempts the whole inquiry by concluding that the local\nlitigation requirement is the kind of “procedural precondi­\ntion” that parties typically expect an arbitrator to enforce.\nAnte, at 8–9. But as explained, the local litigation re­\nquirement does not resemble the requirements we have\npreviously deemed presumptively procedural. See supra,\nat 8. It does not merely regulate the timing of arbitration.\nNor does it send the parties to non-judicial forms of dis­\npute resolution.\n   More importantly, all of the cases cited by the majority\nas examples of procedural provisions involve commercial\ncontracts between two private parties. See ante, at 9.\nNone of them—not a single one—involves an agreement\nbetween sovereigns or an agreement to which the person\nseeking to compel arbitration is not even a party. The\nTreaty, of course, is both of those things.\n   The majority suggests that I am applying “a different\nkind of analysis” from that governing private commercial\ncontracts, just because what is at issue is a treaty. Ante,\nat 15. That is not so: The key point, which the majority\nnever addresses, is that there is no completed agreement\nwhatsoever between Argentina and BG Group. An agree­\nment must be formed, and whether that has happened\nis—as it is in the private commercial contract context—an\nissue for a court to decide. See supra, at 12–13.\n   The distinction between questions concerning consent to\narbitrate and mere procedural requirements under an\nexisting arbitration agreement can at times seem elusive.\nEven the most mundane procedural requirement can be\nrecast as a condition on consent as a matter of technical\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nlogic. But it should be clear by now that the Treaty’s local\nlitigation requirement is not a mere formality—not in\nBuenos Aires, not in London. And while it is true that\n“parties often submit important matters to arbitration,”\nante, at 11, our precedents presume that parties do not\nsubmit to arbitration the most important matter of all:\nwhether they are subject to an agreement to arbitrate in\nthe first place.\n   Nor has the majority pointed to evidence that would\nrebut this presumption by showing that Argentina “ ‘clearly\nand unmistakably’ ” intended to have an arbitrator en­\nforce the litigation requirement. Howsam, supra, at 83\n(quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications\nWorkers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986)). As the majority\nnotes, ante, at 14, the Treaty incorporates certain arbitra­\ntion rules that, in turn, authorize arbitrators to determine\ntheir own jurisdiction over a dispute. See Art. 8(3). But\nthose rules do not operate until a dispute is properly\nbefore an arbitral tribunal, and of course the whole ques­\ntion in this case is whether the dispute between BG Group\nand Argentina was before the arbitrators, given BG\nGroup’s failure to comply with the 18-month local litiga­\ntion requirement. As a leading treatise has explained, “[i]f\nthe parties have not validly agreed to any arbitration\nagreement at all, then they also have necessarily not\nagreed to institutional arbitration rules.” 1 Born 870. “In\nthese circumstances, provisions in institutional rules\ncannot confer any [such] authority upon an arbitral tribu­\nnal.” Ibid.\n   I also see no reason to think that arbitrators enjoy\ncomparative expertise in construing the local litigation\nrequirement. Ante, at 14. It would be one thing if that\nprovision involved the application of the arbitrators’ own\nrules, cf. Howsam, supra, at 85, or if it were “intertwined”\nwith the merits of the underlying dispute, John Wiley &\nSons, 376 U. S., at 557. Neither is true of the litigation\n16          BG GROUP PLC v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nrequirement. A court can assess compliance with the\nrequirement at least as well as an arbitrator can. Given\nthe structure of Article 8 and the important interests that\nthe litigation requirement protects, it seems clear that the\nUnited Kingdom and Argentina thought the same.2\n                              III\n    Although the Court of Appeals got there by a slightly\ndifferent route, it correctly concluded that a court must\ndecide questions concerning the interpretation and appli­\ncation of the local litigation requirement de novo. 665\nF. 3d 1363, 1371–1373 (CADC 2012). At the same time,\nhowever, the court seems to have simply taken it for\ngranted that, because BG Group did not submit its dispute\nto the local courts, the arbitral award in BG Group’s favor\nwas invalid. Indeed, the court addressed the issue in a\nperfunctory paragraph at the end of its opinion and saw\n“ ‘only one possible outcome’ ”: “that BG Group was re­\nquired to commence a lawsuit in Argentina’s courts and\n\n——————\n   2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR contends that “Argentina’s conduct confirms\n\nthat the local litigation requirement is not a condition on consent, for\nrather than objecting to arbitration on the ground that there was no\nbinding arbitration agreement to begin with, Argentina actively partic­\nipated in the constitution of the arbitral panel and in the proceedings\nthat followed.” Ante, at 4 (opinion concurring in part). But as the\narbitral tribunal itself recognized, Argentina did object to the tribunal’s\njurisdiction to hear the dispute. App. to Pet. for Cert. 99a, 134a, 143a,\n161a–163a. And we have held that “merely arguing the arbitrability\nissue to an arbitrator”—say, by “filing with the arbitrators a written\nmemorandum objecting to the arbitrators’ jurisdiction”—“does not\nindicate a clear willingness to arbitrate that issue, i.e., a willingness to\nbe effectively bound by the arbitrator’s decision on that point.” First\nOptions of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 946 (1995). The\nconcurrence contends that Argentina “apparently” argued its jurisdic­\ntional objection in terms of procedure rather than consent, ante, at 4, n.,\nbut the one piece of evidence cited—a negative inference from the\narbitrator’s characterization of Argentina’s argument on a subsidiary\nissue—hardly suffices to distinguish First Options.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

AnimalFeeds Int’l\nCorp., 559 U. S. 662, 677 (2010)).\n   That conclusion is not obvious. A leading treatise has\nindicated that “[i]t is a necessary implication from [a uni­\nlateral] offer that the offeror, in addition, makes a sub­\nsidiary offer by which he or she promises to accept a\ntender of performance.” 1 Lord §5:14, at 1005. On this\nunderstanding, an offeree’s failure to comply with an\nessential condition of the unilateral offer “will not bar an\naction, if failure to comply with the condition is due to the\nofferor’s own fault.” Id., at 1005–1006.\n   It would be open to BG Group to argue before the Court\nof Appeals that this principle was incorporated into Article\n8(2)(a) as an implicit aspect of Argentina’s unilateral offer\nto arbitrate. Such an argument would find some support\nin the background principle of customary international\nlaw that a foreign individual injured by a host country\nmust ordinarily exhaust local remedies—unless doing so\nwould be “futile.” See Dugan 347–357. In any event, the\nissue would be analyzed as one of contract formation, and\ntherefore would be for the court to decide. I would accord­\ningly vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for such an inquiry.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2655591/", "sha1": "d10dab1536b3c2a6adef1ddd9b83e04b8bb87cfb", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-027", "time_retrieved": "2014-03-05T07:17:55.461388"}
