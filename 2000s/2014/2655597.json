MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12–820.      Argued December 11, 2013—Decided March 5, 2014\nWhen one parent abducts a child and flees to another country, the other\n parent may file a petition in that country for the return of the child\n pursuant to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Interna-\n tional Child Abduction (Hague Convention or Convention). If the\n parent files a petition within one year of the child’s removal, a court\n “shall order the return of the child forthwith.” But when the petition\n is filed after the 1-year period expires, the court “shall . . . order the\n return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now\n settled in its new environment.”\n    Respondent Montoya Alvarez and petitioner Lozano resided with\n their daughter in London until November 2008, when Montoya Alva-\n rez left with the child for a women’s shelter. In July 2009, Montoya\n Alvarez and the child left the United Kingdom and ultimately settled\n in New York. Lozano did not locate Montoya Alvarez and the child\n until November 2010, more than 16 months after Montoya Alvarez\n and the child had left the United Kingdom. At that point, Lozano\n filed a Petition for Return of Child pursuant to the Hague Convention\n in the Southern District of New York. Finding that the petition was\n filed more than one year after removal, the court denied the petition\n on the basis that the child was now settled in New York. It also held\n that the 1-year period could not be extended by equitable tolling. The\n Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Article 12’s 1-year period is not subject to equitable tolling.\n Pp. 7–16.\n    (a) The doctrine of equitable tolling, as applied to federal statutes\n of limitations, extends an otherwise discrete limitations period set by\n Congress. Thus, whether tolling is available is fundamentally a\n question of statutory intent. Because Congress “legislate[s] against a\n2                   LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    background of common-law adjudicatory principles,” Astoria Fed.\n    Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108, including equita-\n    ble tolling, see Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397, equitable\n    tolling is presumed to apply if the period in question is a statute of\n    limitations and if tolling is consistent with the statute, Young v.\n    United States, 535 U. S. 43, 49–50. Pp. 7–8.\n       (b) In assessing whether equitable tolling applies to treaties, which\n    are “ ‘compact[s] between independent nations,’ ” Medellín v. Texas,\n    552 U. S. 491, 505, this Court’s “duty [i]s to ascertain the intent of\n    the parties” by looking to the document’s text and context, United\n    States v. Choctaw Nation, 179 U. S. 494, 535. The parties to the\n    Hague Convention did not intend equitable tolling to apply to Article\n    12’s 1-year period. Pp. 8–16.\n         (1) There is no general presumption that equitable tolling applies\n    to treaties. Though part of the established backdrop of American\n    law, equitable tolling has no proper role in the interpretation of trea-\n    ties unless that principle is shared by the parties to the “agreement\n    among sovereign powers,” Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 516\n    U. S. 217, 226. Lozano has identified no such shared principle among\n    the Convention signatories, and the courts of several signatories have\n    explicitly rejected equitable tolling of the Convention. Thus, the\n    American presumption does not apply to this multilateral treaty.\n    The International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U. S. C.\n    §§11601–11610, which Congress enacted to implement the Conven-\n    tion, neither addresses the availability of equitable tolling nor pur-\n    ports to alter the Convention, and therefore does not affect this con-\n    clusion. Pp. 9–11.\n         (2) Even if the Convention were subject to a presumption that\n    statutes of limitations may be tolled, Article 12’s 1-year period is not\n    a statute of limitations. Statutes of limitations embody a “policy of\n    repose, designed to protect defendants,” Burnett v. New York Central\n    R. Co., 380 U. S. 424, 428, and foster the “elimination of stale claims,\n    and certainty about a plaintiff’s opportunity for recovery and a de-\n    fendant’s potential liabilities,” Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 555.\n    Here, the remedy the Convention affords the left-behind parent—\n    return of the child—continues to be available after one year, thus\n    preserving the possibility of relief for that parent and preventing re-\n    pose for the abducting parent. The period’s expiration also does not\n    establish certainty about the parties’ respective rights. Instead, it\n    opens the door to consideration of a third party’s interests, i.e., the\n    child’s interest in settlement. Because that is not the sort of interest\n    addressed by a statute of limitations, the 1-year period should not be\n    treated as a statute of limitations.

Because the drafters did not choose to delay the period’s\n  commencement until discovery of the child’s location—the obvious al-\n  ternative to the date of wrongful removal—the natural implication is\n  that they did not intend to commence the period on that later date.\n  Lozano contends that equitable tolling is nonetheless consistent with\n  the Convention’s goal of deterring child abductions, but the Conven-\n  tion does not pursue that goal at any cost, having recognized that the\n  return remedy may be overcome by, e.g., the child’s interest in set-\n  tlement. And the abducting parent does not necessarily profit by\n  running out the clock, since both American courts and other Conven-\n  tion signatories have considered concealment as a factor in determin-\n  ing whether a child is settled. Equitable tolling is therefore neither\n  required by the Convention nor the only available means to advance\n  its objectives. Pp. 13–15.\n       (4) Lozano contends that there is room for United States courts\n  to apply equitable tolling because the Convention recognizes that\n  other sources of law may permit signatory states to return abducted\n  children even when return is not available or required by the Con-\n  vention. But this contention mistakes the nature of equitable tolling,\n  which may be applied to the Hague Convention only if the treaty\n  drafters so intended. For the foregoing reason, they did not.

DIANA \n\n          LUCIA MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 5, 2014] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   When a parent abducts a child and flees to another\ncountry, the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of\nInternational Child Abduction generally requires that\ncountry to return the child immediately if the other parent\nrequests return within one year. The question in this case\nis whether that 1-year period is subject to equitable tolling\nwhen the abducting parent conceals the child’s location\nfrom the other parent. We hold that equitable tolling is\nnot available.\n                              I\n   To address “the problem of international child abduc­\ntions during domestic disputes,” Abbott v. Abbott, 560\nU. S. 1, 8 (2010), in 1980 the Hague Conference on Private\nInternational Law adopted the Convention on the Civil\nAspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Conven­\ntion or Convention), T. I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc.\nNo. 99–11 (Treaty Doc.). The Convention states two pri­\nmary objectives: “to secure the prompt return of children\nwrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting\nState,” and “to ensure that rights of custody and of access\n2              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder the law of one Contracting State are effectively\nrespected in the other Contracting States.” Art. 1, id.,\nat 7.\n   To those ends, the Convention’s “central operating\nfeature” is the return of the child. Abbott, 560 U. S., at 9.\nThat remedy, in effect, lays venue for the ultimate custody\ndetermination in the child’s country of habitual residence\nrather than the country to which the child is abducted.\nSee id., at 20 (“The Convention is based on the principle\nthat the best interests of the child are well served when de­\ncisions regarding custody rights are made in the country\nof habitual residence”).\n   The return remedy is not absolute. Article 13 excuses\nreturn where, for example, the left-behind parent was not\n“actually exercising” custody rights when the abducting\nparent removed the child, or where there is a “grave risk”\nthat return would “place the child in an intolerable situa­\ntion.” Hague Convention, Arts. 13(a)–(b), Treaty Doc., at\n10. A state may also refuse to return the child if doing\nso would contravene “fundamental principles . . . relating\nto the protection of human rights and fundamental free­\ndoms.” Art. 20, id., at 11.\n   This case concerns another exception to the return\nremedy. Article 12 of the Convention states the general\nrule that when a court receives a petition for return within\none year after the child’s wrongful removal, the court\n“shall order the return of the child forthwith.” Id., at 9.\nArticle 12 further provides that the court,\n    “where the proceedings have been commenced after\n    the expiration of the period of one year [from the date\n    of the wrongful removal], shall also order the return of\n    the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is\n    now settled in its new environment.” Ibid.\nThus, at least in some cases, failure to file a petition\nfor return within one year renders the return remedy\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nunavailable.\n   The United States ratified the Hague Convention in\n1988, and Congress implemented the Convention that\nsame year through the International Child Abduc-\ntion Remedies Act (ICARA). 102 Stat. 437, 42 U. S. C.\n§§11601–11610. That statute instructs courts to “decide\nthe case in accordance with the Convention.” §11603(d).\nEchoing the Convention, ICARA further provides that\n“[c]hildren who are wrongfully removed . . . are to be\npromptly returned unless one of the narrow exceptions set\nforth in the Convention applies.” §11601(a)(4). Finally,\nICARA requires the abducting parent to establish by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Article 12’s exception\nto return applies. §11603(e)(2)(B).\n                                II\n    Diana Lucia Montoya Alvarez and Manuel Jose Lozano\nare the parents of the girl at the center of this dispute.1\nMontoya Alvarez and Lozano met and began dating in\nLondon in early 2004. Montoya Alvarez gave birth to a\ndaughter in October 2005.\n    Montoya Alvarez and Lozano describe their relationship\nin starkly different terms. Lozano stated that they were\n“ ‘very happy together,’ ” albeit with “normal couple prob­\nlems.” In re Lozano, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 204 (SDNY\n2011). Montoya Alvarez described a pattern of physical\nand emotional abuse that included multiple incidents of\nrape and battery. The District Court found insufficient\nevidence to make specific findings about domestic violence\nbut determined that Lozano’s claim that he never mis­\ntreated Montoya Alvarez was “not credible.” Id., at 206.\n    The parties also differ as to the child’s well-being during\nthe first three years of her life. Lozano stated that he and\n——————\n  1 Except where otherwise noted, the facts are taken from the District\n\nCourt’s findings. Like the courts below, we refer to Montoya Alvarez\nand Lozano’s daughter as “the child” to protect her identity.\n4              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe child had a very good relationship, and that the child\nwas generally happy. Montoya Alvarez believed other­\nwise. In October 2008, Montoya Alvarez reported to the\nchild’s doctor that she refused to speak at the nursery she\nattended, cried often, and wet the bed. Montoya Alvarez\nalso stated that the child refused to speak when Lozano\nwas present. The child’s nursery manager wrote that the\ngirl was “ ‘very withdrawn,’ ” and noted that the home\n“ ‘environment obviously had a negative effect’ ” on her.\nId., at 207. The District Court found insufficient evidence\nthat Lozano had physically abused the child, but did con­\nclude that the child had seen and heard her parents argu­\ning at home.\n    In November 2008, when the child was just over three\nyears old, Montoya Alvarez went to New York to visit her\nsister Maria. During that time, the child remained in\nLondon with Lozano and his visiting mother. When Mon­\ntoya Alvarez returned on November 18, she became acutely\nconcerned about the child’s fearful behavior around Lo­\nzano. The next day, Montoya Alvarez left with the child\nand never returned.\n    Montoya Alvarez and the child lived at a women’s shel­\nter for the next seven months. After Montoya Alvarez was\nunable to find suitable long-term accommodations in the\nUnited Kingdom, she and the child left for France on July\n3, 2009, and then for the United States, arriving five days\nlater. Since their arrival, Montoya Alvarez and the child\nhave lived with Montoya Alvarez’ sister Maria and her\nfamily in New York.\n    When they arrived in New York, Montoya Alvarez and\nthe child began seeing a therapist at a family medical\nclinic. The therapist testified that, at first, the child was\nwithdrawn and would wet herself. The therapist diag­\nnosed her with posttraumatic stress disorder. Within six\nmonths, however, the therapist described her as “ ‘a com­\npletely different child,’ ” who had stopped wetting herself,\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwas excited to play with friends, and was able to speak\nfreely about her emotions. Id., at 212. When Montoya\nAlvarez and the child returned to the therapist after Lo­\nzano filed a petition for the child’s return, the therapist\nnoted that the child was doing well but did not wish to see\nher father.\n  In the meantime, Lozano attempted to find Montoya\nAlvarez and the child. Shortly after Montoya Alvarez left\nin November 2008, he called her sister Gloria in London,\nbut eventually received legal advice not to speak with\nMontoya Alvarez’ family. A mediation service also sent\nseveral letters to Montoya Alvarez on Lozano’s behalf\nwithout receiving a response. In July 2009, Lozano filed\nan application for a court order in the United Kingdom “ ‘to\nensure that he obtains regular contact with his [child] and\nplays an active role in [her] life.’ ” Id., at 210. He also\nsought court orders to compel Montoya Alvarez’ sisters\nand legal counsel, the child’s doctor and nursery, and\nvarious government offices in London to disclose the\nchild’s whereabouts.\n  On March 15, 2010, after determining that the child was\nnot in the United Kingdom (and suspecting that the child\nwas in New York), Lozano filed a form with the Hague\nConvention Central Authority for England and Wales\nseeking to have the child returned.2 The United States\nCentral Authority—the Office of Children’s Issues in the\nDepartment of State, see 22 CFR §94.2 (2013)—received\nthe application on March 23, 2010. After the Office of\nChildren’s Issues confirmed that Montoya Alvarez had\nentered the United States, Lozano located Montoya Alva­\nrez’ address in New York. On November 10, 2010, more\nthan 16 months after Montoya Alvarez and the child left\n——————\n  2 Article 6 of the Hague Convention requires each Contracting State\n\nto “designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are\nimposed by the Convention upon such authorities.” Treaty Doc., at 8.\n6                LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United Kingdom, Lozano filed a Petition for Return of\nChild pursuant to the Hague Convention and ICARA, 42\nU. S. C. §11603, in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York.\n   After a 2-day evidentiary hearing, the District Court\ndenied Lozano’s petition. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The Dis­\ntrict Court concluded that Lozano had stated a prima facie\ncase of wrongful removal under the Hague Convention.\nId., at 219–220. Prior to her removal, the child was a\nhabitual resident of the United Kingdom, see Hague Con­\nvention, Art. 4, and Lozano had custody rights that he\nwas actually exercising at the time of removal, see Arts.\n3(a)–(b).\n   Because the petition was filed more than one year after\nthe child’s wrongful removal, however, the District Court\ndenied the petition on the basis that the child was now\nsettled in New York. Id., at 230, 234. “Viewing the total­\nity of the circumstances,” the court found sufficient indicia\nof “stability in her family, educational, social, and most\nimportantly, home life,” id., at 233, to conclude that the\nchild was settled in her current environment and that\nrepatriation would be “extremely disruptive,” id., at 234.\nLozano argued that the child should be returned forthwith\nbecause the 1-year period in Article 12 should be equitably\ntolled during the period that Montoya Alvarez concealed\nthe child. The court rejected that argument, holding that\nthe 1-year period could not be extended by equitable toll­\ning.3 Id., at 228–229.\n——————\n    3 TheDistrict Court held in the alternative that even if equitable\ntolling could apply, it would not be warranted in this case because\nLozano had contact information for Montoya Alvarez’ sister Maria in\nNew York. Lozano’s solicitors did not attempt to contact Maria to\ndetermine if Montoya Alvarez and the child were there. 809 F. Supp.\n2d, at 229–230.\n  Consistent with Second Circuit precedent, see Blondin v. Dubois, 238\nF. 3d 153, 164 (2001), the District Court also considered “whether to\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

The Court of Appeals agreed that the 1-year per­\niod in Article 12 is not subject to equitable tolling. Accord­\ning to the court, unlike a statute of limitations that would\nprohibit the filing of a return petition after one year, the\n1-year period in Article 12 merely permits courts, after that\nperiod has run, to consider the interests of the child in\nsettlement. Id., at 52. The Second Circuit concluded that\nallowing equitable tolling to delay consideration of the\nchild’s interests would undermine the purpose of the\nHague Convention. Id., at 54.\n  We granted certiorari to decide whether Article 12’s\n1-year period is subject to equitable tolling. 570 U. S. ___\n(2013). Compare 697 F. 3d, at 50–55 (equitable tolling not\navailable); and Yaman v. Yaman, 730 F. 3d 1, 12–16 (CA1\n2013) (same), with Duarte v. Bardales, 526 F. 3d 563, 568–\n570 (CA9 2008) (equitable tolling available); and Furnes v.\nReeves, 362 F. 3d 702, 723–724 (CA11 2004) (same). We\nhold that equitable tolling is not available, and therefore\naffirm.\n                               III\n  Although this case concerns the application of equitable\ntolling to a treaty, we begin with a more familiar context:\nequitable tolling of federal statutes of limitations. As a\ngeneral matter, equitable tolling pauses the running of, or\n“tolls,” a statute of limitations when a litigant has pursued\nhis rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance\nprevents him from bringing a timely action. See, e.g., Pace\nv. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005).

Supp. 2d, at 234. The court declined to\nexercise that discretion because the “strong evidence that the child is\nquite settled in New York” outweighed Lozano’s “fairly diligent” search\nefforts and Montoya Alvarez’ conduct. Ibid.\n8              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions period set by Congress, whether equitable tolling is\navailable is fundamentally a question of statutory intent.\nSee, e.g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498\nU. S. 89, 95 (1990); Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S.\n467, 479–480 (1986); Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484, 501\n(1967).\n   As applied to federal statutes of limitations, the inquiry\nbegins with the understanding that Congress “legislate[s]\nagainst a background of common-law adjudicatory princi­\nples.” Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501\nU. S. 104, 108 (1991). Equitable tolling, a long-established\nfeature of American jurisprudence derived from “the old\nchancery rule,” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397\n(1946), is just such a principle. See Young v. United\nStates, 535 U.

S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nperiod in Article 12. Unlike federal statutes of limitations,\nthe Convention was not adopted against a shared back­\nground of equitable tolling. Even if the Convention were\nsubject to a presumption that statutes of limitations may\nbe tolled, the 1-year period in Article 12 is not a statute of\nlimitations. And absent a presumption in favor of equita­\nble tolling, nothing in the Convention warrants tolling the\n1-year period.\n                               A\n   First, there is no general presumption that equitable\ntolling applies to treaties. Congress is presumed to incor­\nporate equitable tolling into federal statutes of limitations\nbecause equitable tolling is part of the established back­\ndrop of American law. Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 560\n(2000) (“[F]ederal statutes of limitations are generally\nsubject to equitable principles of tolling”). It does not\nfollow, however, that we can export such background\nprinciples of United States law to contexts outside their\njurisprudential home.\n   It is particularly inappropriate to deploy this back­\nground principle of American law automatically when\ninterpreting a treaty. “A treaty is in its nature a contract\nbetween . . . nations, not a legislative act.” Foster v.\nNeilson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314 (1829) (Marshall, C.

They are made by\nequal parties, and each side has half of the bargain to\nmake . . . ”). That distinction has been reflected in the way\nwe interpret treaties. It is our “responsibility to read the\ntreaty in a manner ‘consistent with the shared expecta­\ntions of the contracting parties.’ ” Olympic Airways v.\nHusain, 540 U. S. 644, 650 (2004) (quoting Air France v.\nSaks, 470 U. S. 392, 399 (1985); emphasis added). Even if\na background principle is relevant to the interpretation of\n10                LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal statutes, it has no proper role in the interpretation\nof treaties unless that principle is shared by the parties to\n“an agreement among sovereign powers,” Zicherman v.\nKorean Air Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217, 226 (1996).\n   Lozano has not identified a background principle of\nequitable tolling that is shared by the signatories to the\nHague Convention. To the contrary, Lozano concedes that\nin the context of the Convention, “foreign courts have\nfailed to adopt equitable tolling . . . because they lac[k] the\npresumption that we [have].” Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–20.\nWhile no signatory state’s court of last resort has resolved\nthe question, intermediate courts of appeals in several\nstates have rejected equitable tolling. See Cannon v.\nCannon, [2004] EWCA (Civ) 1330, [2005] 1 W. L. R. 32,\n¶51 (Eng.), (rejecting the “tolling rule” as “too crude an\napproach” for the Convention); Kubera v. Kubera, 3 B. C.\nL. R.

See\nIn re H, [2000] 2 F. L. R. 51, [2000] 3 F. C. R. 404 (Eng.). It is unclear\nwhether the logic of that decision survived the decision of the Court of\nAppeals for England and Wales in Cannon.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

S. C. §§11601–11610. ICARA does not\naddress the availability of equitable tolling. Nor does it\npurport to alter the Convention. See §11601(b)(2) (“The\nprovisions of [ICARA] are in addition to and not in lieu of\nthe provisions of the Convention”). In fact, Congress\nexplicitly recognized “the need for uniform international\ninterpretation of the Convention.” §11601(b)(3)(B). Con­\ngress’ mere enactment of implementing legislation did not\nsomehow import background principles of American law\ninto the treaty interpretation process, thereby altering our\nunderstanding of the treaty itself.\n                               B\n   Even if the presumption in favor of equitable tolling had\nforce outside of domestic law, we have only applied that\npresumption to statutes of limitations. See Hallstrom v.\nTillamook County, 493 U. S. 20, 27 (1989) (no equitable\ntolling of a 60-day presuit notice requirement that does\nnot operate as a statute of limitations). The 1-year period\nin Article 12 is not a statute of limitations.\n   As a general matter, “[s]tatutes of limitations establish\nthe period of time within which a claimant must bring an\naction.” Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co.,\n571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4). They characteris­\ntically embody a “policy of repose, designed to protect\ndefendants.” Burnett v. New York Central R. Co., 380\nU. S. 424, 428 (1965). And they foster the “elimination of\nstale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff ’s opportunity\nfor recovery and a defendant’s potential liabilities.” Rotella,\nsupra, at 555.\n   In Young, 535 U. S. 43, we evaluated whether those\ncharacteristics of statutes of limitations were present in\n12                 LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe “three-year lookback period” for tax liabilities in bank­\nruptcy proceedings. The Bankruptcy Code favors tax\nclaims less than three years old in two respects: Such\nclaims cannot be discharged, and they have priority over\ncertain others in bankruptcy proceedings. See 11 U. S. C.\n§§507(a)(8)(A)(i), 523(a)(1)(A). If the Internal Revenue\nService “sleeps on its rights” by failing to prosecute those\nclaims within three years, however, then those mecha­\nnisms for enforcing claims against bankrupt taxpayers are\neliminated. Young, 535 U. S., at 47. We concluded that\nthe lookback period “serves the same ‘basic policies [fur­\nthered by] all limitations provisions,’ ” ibid. (quoting Ro­\ntella, 528 U. S., at 555), i.e., certainty and repose. We\naccordingly held that it was a limitations period\npresumptively subject to equitable tolling. 535 U. S.,\nat 47.\n   Unlike the 3-year lookback period in Young, expiration\nof the 1-year period in Article 12 does not eliminate the\nremedy the Convention affords the left-behind parent—\nnamely, the return of the child. Before one year has\nelapsed, Article 12 provides that the court “shall order the\nreturn of the child forthwith.” Treaty Doc., at 9. But even\nafter that period has expired, the court “shall also order\nthe return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the\nchild is now settled.” Ibid. The continued availability of\nthe return remedy after one year preserves the possibility\nof relief for the left-behind parent and prevents repose\nfor the abducting parent.5 Rather than establishing any\n——————\n  5 Inthe State Department’s view, the Hague Convention confers equi­\ntable discretion on courts to order the return of a child even if the court\ndetermines that the child is “settled” within the meaning of Article 12.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19–25. If accurate, that\ninterpretation would reinforce that Article 12 is not meant to provide\nrepose to the abducting parent, and it would underscore that the 1-year\nperiod is not a statute of limitations. But we do not decide whether,\nand under what circumstances, a court may exercise discretion to order\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                       13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ncertainty about the respective rights of the parties, the\nexpiration of the 1-year period opens the door to consider­\nation of a third party’s interests, i.e., the child’s interest in\nsettlement. Because that is not the sort of interest ad­\ndressed by a statute of limitations, we decline to treat the\n1-year period as a statute of limitations.6\n                              C\n   Without a presumption of equitable tolling, the Conven­\ntion does not support extending the 1-year period during\nconcealment. Article 12 explicitly provides that the 1-year\nperiod commences on “the date of the wrongful removal or\nretention,” and makes no provision for an extension of that\nperiod. Id., at 9. Further, the practical effect of the tolling\nthat Lozano requests would be to delay the commence­\nment of the 1-year period until the left-behind parent\ndiscovers the child’s location. Commencing the 1-year\nperiod upon discovery is the obvious alternative to the\ncommencement date the drafters actually adopted because\nthe subject of the Hague Convention, child abduction, is\nnaturally associated with the sort of concealment that\nmight justify equitable tolling under other circumstances.\nSee 697 F. 3d, at 51, n. 8 (“It would have been a simple\n——————\nreturn notwithstanding the child’s subsequent settlement. In the Court\nof Appeals, Lozano failed to challenge the District Court’s decision not\nto exercise its discretion to order the return of the settled child, see n. 3,\nsupra, and that issue is beyond the scope of the question presented\nbefore this Court.\n  6 Lozano argues that the United States delegation referred to the\n\n1-year period as a “statute of limitations” at various points during and\nafter the drafting process. Brief for Petitioner 27–28. Because the\ndetermination whether the 1-year period is a statute of limitations\ndepends on its functional characteristics, it is not significant that the\ndelegation used that label. In any event, we doubt that the remarks of\na single delegation are sufficient under these circumstances to establish\nthe “ ‘shared expectations of the contracting parties.’ ” Olympic Airways\nv. Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 651 (2004) (quoting Air France v. Saks, 470\nU. S. 392, 399 (1985)).\n14              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmatter, if the state parties to the Convention wished to\ntake account of the possibility that an abducting parent\nmight make it difficult for the petitioning parent to dis­\ncover the child’s whereabouts, to run the period ‘from the\ndate that the petitioning parent learned [or, could reason­\nably have learned] of the child’s whereabouts’ ” (alterations\nin original)). Given that the drafters did not adopt that\nalternative, the natural implication is that they did not\nintend the 1-year period to commence on that later date.\nCf. Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 10–11). We cannot revisit that\nchoice.\n   Lozano contends that equitable tolling is nevertheless\nconsistent with the purpose of the Hague Convention\nbecause it is necessary to deter child abductions. In his\nview, “absent equitable tolling, concealment ‘probably will’\nresult in non-return,” which will in turn encourage abduc­\ntion. Reply Brief 14–15; see also Duarte, 526 F. 3d, at 570.\n   We agree, of course, that the Convention reflects a\ndesign to discourage child abduction. But the Convention\ndoes not pursue that goal at any cost. The child’s interest\nin choosing to remain, Art. 13, or in avoiding physical or\npsychological harm, Art. 13(b), may overcome the return\nremedy. The same is true of the child’s interest in settle­\nment. See supra, at 2; see also In re M, [2008] 1 A. C.\n1288, 1310 (Eng. 2007) (opinion of Baroness Hale of Rich­\nmond) (“These children should not be made to suffer for\nthe sake of general deterrence of the evil of child abduc­\ntion world wide”). We are unwilling to apply equitable\ntolling principles that would, in practice, rewrite the treaty.\nSee Chan v. Korean Air Lines, Ltd., 490 U. S. 122, 134–\n135 (1989) (“ ‘[T]o alter, amend, or add to any treaty by\ninserting any clause, whether small or great, important\nor trivial, would be . . . to make, and not to construe a\ntreaty’ ” (quoting The Amiable Isabella, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71\n(1821) (Story, J., for the Court))).\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Equitable tolling is\ntherefore neither required by the Convention nor the only\navailable means to advance its objectives.\n                             D\n  Finally, Lozano contends that the Hague Convention\nleaves room for United States courts to apply their own\n“common law doctrine of equitable tolling” to the 1-year\nperiod in Article 12 without regard to whether the drafters\nof the Convention intended equitable tolling to apply.\nBrief for Petitioner 25. Specifically, Lozano contends that\nthe Convention recognizes additional sources of law that\npermit signatory states to return abducted children even\nwhen return is not available or required pursuant to the\nConvention. Article 34 of the Convention provides that\n16             LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“for the purpos[e] of obtaining the return of a child,” the\nConvention “shall not restrict the application of an inter­\nnational instrument in force between the State of origin\nand the State addressed” or the application of “other law\nof the State addressed.” Treaty Doc., at 13; see also Art.\n18, id., at 11 (“The provisions of this Chapter do not limit\nthe power of a judicial or administrative authority to order\nthe return of the child at any time”). In Lozano’s view,\nequitable tolling principles constitute “other law” that\nshould apply here.\n   That contention mistakes the nature of equitable tolling\nas this Court has applied it. We do not apply equitable\ntolling as a matter of some independent authority to re­\nconsider the fairness of legislative judgments balancing\nthe needs for relief and repose. See supra, at 7–8. To the\ncontrary, we may apply equitable tolling to the Hague\nConvention only if we determine that the treaty drafters\nso intended. See Choctaw Nation, 179 U. S., at 535. For\nthe foregoing reasons, we conclude that they did not.\n                             V\n  The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the 1-year\nperiod in Article 12 of the Hague Convention is not subject\nto equitable tolling.

I write sepa­\nrately to explain why courts have equitable discretion\nunder the Hague Convention to order a child’s return even\nafter the child has become settled, and how that discretion\nprevents abuses that petitioner claims will follow from\nholding that Article 12’s 1-year period may not be equita­\nbly tolled.\n  The Convention is designed to protect the interests of\nchildren and their parents. Much of the Convention can\nbe understood as an attempt to balance the various inter­\nests of children and non-abducting parents when a par-\nent abducts a child from the child’s country of habitual\nresidence.\n  When a child has been absent from the country of ha­\nbitual residence for less than a year, the Convention con­\nclusively presumes that the child’s nascent attachment to\nthe new country is outweighed by the non-abducting par­\nent’s interest in prompt return and the child’s own inter­\nest in returning to the country from which he or she was\nremoved just a few months previously. This is why Article\n12 requires return “forthwith” if the petition for return\nis brought within a year of abduction, unless one of the\nnarrow exceptions set forth in Article 13 or 20 applies.\n2              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nHague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International\nChild Abduction (Hague Convention or Convention), Oct.\n25, 1980, T. I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99–11\n(Treaty Doc.), p. 9. But, as the Convention recognizes, at\nsome point the child will become accustomed to the new\nenvironment, making Article 12’s conclusive presumption\ninappropriate. Thus, if the petition for return is brought\nafter a year has elapsed, the court must determine whether\nthe child has become “settled” in the new country; and if\nthis has occurred, the court need not order return. Ibid.\nAs the majority recognizes, this provision of the Conven­\ntion “opens the door to consideration of . . . the child’s\ninterest in settlement.” Ante, at 13.\n   But opening the door to consideration of the child’s\nattachment to the new country does not mean closing the\ndoor to evaluating all other interests of the child and\nthe non-abducting parent. The fact that, after one year,\na child’s need for stability requires a court to take into\naccount the child’s attachment to the new country does not\nmean that such attachment becomes the only factor worth\nconsidering when evaluating a petition for return.\n   Nothing in Article 12 prohibits courts from taking other\nfactors into account. To the contrary, the Convention\nexplicitly permits them to do so. Article 18 provides that\n“[t]he provisions of this Chapter [including Article 12] do\nnot limit the power of a judicial or administrative author­\nity to order the return of the child at any time.” Hague\nConvention, Treaty Doc., at 11. A court thus has power to\norder the child’s return in the exercise of its sound discre­\ntion even where Article 12’s obligation to order such re­\nturn no longer applies.\n   This provision makes eminent sense. Even after a year\nhas elapsed and the child has become settled in the new\nenvironment, a variety of factors may outweigh the child’s\ninterest in remaining in the new country, such as the\nchild’s interest in returning to his or her original country\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nof residence (with which he or she may still have close ties,\ndespite having become settled in the new country); the\nchild’s need for contact with the non-abducting parent,\nwho was exercising custody when the abduction occurred;\nthe non-abducting parent’s interest in exercising the cus­\ntody to which he or she is legally entitled; the need to\ndiscourage inequitable conduct (such as concealment) by\nabducting parents; and the need to deter international\nabductions generally.\n   Article 12 places no limit on Article 18’s grant of discre­\ntionary power to order return. Article 18 expressly states\nas much. See ibid. (Article 12 “do[es] not limit the power\nof a judicial or administrative authority to order the re­\nturn of the child”). Even without Article 18’s express\nlanguage, it would be clear that Article 12 merely tells a\ncourt when it must order return, without telling it when it\nmay do so. Article 12 states that, after the 1-year period\nhas elapsed, a court “shall . . . order the return of the\nchild, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now\nsettled in its new environment.” Id., at 9. The final clause\nindicates when the obligation imposed earlier in the sen­\ntence terminates; it does not substitute for that obligation\na prohibition on ordering return. When a mother tells her\nchild, “Come straight home from school, unless one of your\nfriends invites you to a movie,” the mother has not prohib­\nited her child from coming home immediately after school\neven if a friend proposes a film. Cf. Department of Com-\nmerce v. United States House of Representatives, 525 U. S.\n316, 339 (1999) (explaining that the meaning of a similar\nsentence structure in 13 U. S. C. §195 “depends primarily\non the broader context in which that structure appears”).\nThus, nothing in Article 12 calls into question the discre­\ntionary power of courts to order return after the 1-year\nperiod has expired and the child has become settled.\n   Reading the Convention to impose a prohibition on\nreturn would be highly anomalous, given that the “Con­\n4              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nvention is based on the principle that the best interests of\nthe child are well served when decisions regarding custody\nrights are made in the country of habitual residence.”\nAbbott v. Abbott, 560 U. S. 1, 20 (2010). Such a prohibi­\ntion would run counter to other provisions of the Conven­\ntion. For instance, Article 13(b) gives a court discretion to\nreturn or decline to return a child who has not become\nsettled if “there is a grave risk that . . . return would\nexpose the child to physical or psychological harm or\notherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.”\nHague Convention, Treaty Doc., at 10. If a court has\ndiscretion to order return even where such return poses “a\ngrave risk” of harm or threatens to place the child in an\n“intolerable situation,” surely it has discretion to order\nreturn when faced with the lesser risk attendant on re­\nmoving a child from the child’s present environment (espe­\ncially given that the child will generally be returning to a\nknown environment: her country of habitual residence).\n   The State Department has adopted the view that the\nConvention empowers a court, in its equitable discretion,\nto return a child who has become settled. In the analysis\nthat it provided to the Senate in connection with the rati­\nfication process, the Department made clear that, even\nwhen a year has elapsed and the child has become settled,\na court may still consider such factors as “evidence . . .\nconcerning the child’s contacts with and ties to his or her\nState of habitual residence,” “[t]he reason for the passage\nof time,” and any concealment by the abducting parent in\ndetermining whether to order return. Hague International\nChild Abduction Convention; Text and Legal Analysis\n(State Legal Analysis), 51 Fed. Reg. 10494, 10509 (1986).\nThe Department continues to endorse this view today. See\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19. As this\nCourt has previously explained (in the context of the\nConvention, in fact), the State Department’s interpreta­\ntion of treaties “ ‘is entitled to great weight.’ ” Abbott,\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nsupra, at 15 (quoting Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v.\nAvagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 185 (1982)).\n   So, too, is the interpretation of the courts of our sister\nsignatories. See Abbott, supra, at 16. The United King­\ndom’s House of Lords (at the time that nation’s highest\ncourt) has held that “a settled child might nevertheless be\nreturned” by a court in the exercise of its discretion—\na conclusion driven in part by acknowledgment of the in­\nequity of rewarding concealment. In re M, [2008] 1 A. C.\n1288, 1304, ¶31 (Eng. 2007) (opinion of Baroness Hale of\nRichmond). Likewise, the Supreme Court of Ireland has\nconcluded that courts have equitable discretion to order\nreturn of a child who has become settled. See P. v. B. (No.\n2), [1999] 4 I. R. 185. I am unaware of any high courts of\nstates signatory that have concluded to the contrary.\n   Given the foregoing, it is perhaps unsurprising that the\nCourts of Appeals to have considered the question have\nfound that a court possesses equitable discretion to order\nreturn of a child despite the child’s having become settled\nin the new country. See Yaman v. Yaman, 730 F. 3d 1, 21\n(CA1 2013); Blondin v. Dubois, 238 F. 3d 153, 164 (CA2\n2001). And other Courts of Appeals have found more\ngenerally that none of the Convention’s exceptions prohibit\nreturn. See, e.g., Asvesta v. Petroutsas, 580 F. 3d 1000,\n1004 (CA9 2009); Miller v. Miller, 240 F. 3d 392, 402 (CA4\n2001).\n   Equitable discretion to order return of a settled child is\nparticularly important in light of the fact that the Conven­\ntion, as the Court correctly holds today, does not provide\nfor equitable tolling of Article 12’s 1-year period. Peti­\ntioner predicts dire consequences from the Court’s holding.\nHe argues that, as a result of our decision, the United\nStates will become an abduction haven, with parents\nconcealing their children here until Article 12’s 1-year\nperiod has run and then claiming their children have\nbecome settled and hence ineligible for return. But such\n6               LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\ninequitable conduct would weigh heavily in favor of re­\nturning a child even if she has become settled. See, e.g.,\nState Legal Analysis, 51 Fed. Reg. 10509 (“If the alleged\nwrongdoer concealed the child’s whereabouts from the\ncustodian necessitating a long search for the child and\nthereby delayed the commencement of a return proceeding\nby the applicant, it is highly questionable whether the\nrespondent should be permitted to benefit from such con­\nduct absent strong countervailing considerations”); In re\nM, supra, at 1310, ¶31 (recognizing that a court may take\nconcealment into account in considering whether to return\na settled child). Given the courts’ discretion to order\nreturn in response to concealment, I do not believe the\nCourt’s decision today risks incentivizing parents to flee\nwith their children to this country and conceal them.\n   Equitable discretion is also a far better tool than equita­\nble tolling with which to address the dangers of conceal­\nment. Equitable tolling would require return every time\nthe abducting parent conceals the child and thereby pre­\nvents the non-abducting parent from filing a return peti­\ntion within a year, regardless of how settled in the new\ncountry the child has become. Thus, on petitioner’s view,\na court would be bound to return a 14-year-old child who\nwas brought to the United States shortly after birth and\nhad been concealed here ever since. By contrast, when a\ncourt exercises its equitable discretion, it may consider\nother factors in addition to concealment. While conceal­\nment is a significant factor and should weigh heavily in a\ncourt’s analysis, in appropriate cases it can be overcome by\ncircumstances such as the extended length of the child’s\nresidence in this country, any strong ties the child has\nformed here, and the child’s attenuated connections to his\nor her former country.\n   In short, I believe the power of a court, in the exercise of\nits sound discretion, to return even a settled child pre­\nvents the inapplicability of equitable tolling to Article 12’s\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

In July 2009, Montoya\n Alvarez and the child left the United Kingdom and ultimately settled\n in New York. Lozano did not locate Montoya Alvarez and the child\n until November 2010, more than 16 months after Montoya Alvarez\n and the child had left the United Kingdom. At that point, Lozano\n filed a Petition for Return of Child pursuant to the Hague Convention\n in the Southern District of New York. Finding that the petition was\n filed more than one year after removal, the court denied the petition\n on the basis that the child was now settled in New York.

The\n Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Article 12’s 1-year period is not subject to equitable tolling.\n Pp. 7–16.\n    (a) The doctrine of equitable tolling, as applied to federal statutes\n of limitations, extends an otherwise discrete limitations period set by\n Congress.

The parties to the\n    Hague Convention did not intend equitable tolling to apply to Article\n    12’s 1-year period. Pp. 8–16.\n         (1) There is no general presumption that equitable tolling applies\n    to treaties. Though part of the established backdrop of American\n    law, equitable tolling has no proper role in the interpretation of trea-\n    ties unless that principle is shared by the parties to the “agreement\n    among sovereign powers,” Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 516\n    U. S. 217, 226. Lozano has identified no such shared principle among\n    the Convention signatories, and the courts of several signatories have\n    explicitly rejected equitable tolling of the Convention. Thus, the\n    American presumption does not apply to this multilateral treaty.\n    The International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U. S. C.\n    §§11601–11610, which Congress enacted to implement the Conven-\n    tion, neither addresses the availability of equitable tolling nor pur-\n    ports to alter the Convention, and therefore does not affect this con-\n    clusion. Pp. 9–11.\n         (2) Even if the Convention were subject to a presumption that\n    statutes of limitations may be tolled, Article 12’s 1-year period is not\n    a statute of limitations. Statutes of limitations embody a “policy of\n    repose, designed to protect defendants,” Burnett v. New York Central\n    R. Co., 380 U. S. 424, 428, and foster the “elimination of stale claims,\n    and certainty about a plaintiff’s opportunity for recovery and a de-\n    fendant’s potential liabilities,” Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 555.\n    Here, the remedy the Convention affords the left-behind parent—\n    return of the child—continues to be available after one year, thus\n    preserving the possibility of relief for that parent and preventing re-\n    pose for the abducting parent. The period’s expiration also does not\n    establish certainty about the parties’ respective rights. Instead, it\n    opens the door to consideration of a third party’s interests, i.e., the\n    child’s interest in settlement. Because that is not the sort of interest\n    addressed by a statute of limitations, the 1-year period should not be\n    treated as a statute of limitations.

Because the drafters did not choose to delay the period’s\n  commencement until discovery of the child’s location—the obvious al-\n  ternative to the date of wrongful removal—the natural implication is\n  that they did not intend to commence the period on that later date.\n  Lozano contends that equitable tolling is nonetheless consistent with\n  the Convention’s goal of deterring child abductions, but the Conven-\n  tion does not pursue that goal at any cost, having recognized that the\n  return remedy may be overcome by, e.g., the child’s interest in set-\n  tlement. And the abducting parent does not necessarily profit by\n  running out the clock, since both American courts and other Conven-\n  tion signatories have considered concealment as a factor in determin-\n  ing whether a child is settled. Equitable tolling is therefore neither\n  required by the Convention nor the only available means to advance\n  its objectives. Pp. 13–15.\n       (4) Lozano contends that there is room for United States courts\n  to apply equitable tolling because the Convention recognizes that\n  other sources of law may permit signatory states to return abducted\n  children even when return is not available or required by the Con-\n  vention. But this contention mistakes the nature of equitable tolling,\n  which may be applied to the Hague Convention only if the treaty\n  drafters so intended. For the foregoing reason, they did not.

The question in this case\nis whether that 1-year period is subject to equitable tolling\nwhen the abducting parent conceals the child’s location\nfrom the other parent. We hold that equitable tolling is\nnot available.\n                              I\n   To address “the problem of international child abduc­\ntions during domestic disputes,” Abbott v. Abbott, 560\nU. S. 1, 8 (2010), in 1980 the Hague Conference on Private\nInternational Law adopted the Convention on the Civil\nAspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Conven­\ntion or Convention), T. I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc.\nNo. 99–11 (Treaty Doc.). The Convention states two pri­\nmary objectives: “to secure the prompt return of children\nwrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting\nState,” and “to ensure that rights of custody and of access\n2              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder the law of one Contracting State are effectively\nrespected in the other Contracting States.” Art. 1, id.,\nat 7.\n   To those ends, the Convention’s “central operating\nfeature” is the return of the child. Abbott, 560 U. S., at 9.\nThat remedy, in effect, lays venue for the ultimate custody\ndetermination in the child’s country of habitual residence\nrather than the country to which the child is abducted.\nSee id., at 20 (“The Convention is based on the principle\nthat the best interests of the child are well served when de­\ncisions regarding custody rights are made in the country\nof habitual residence”).\n   The return remedy is not absolute. Article 13 excuses\nreturn where, for example, the left-behind parent was not\n“actually exercising” custody rights when the abducting\nparent removed the child, or where there is a “grave risk”\nthat return would “place the child in an intolerable situa­\ntion.” Hague Convention, Arts. 13(a)–(b), Treaty Doc., at\n10. A state may also refuse to return the child if doing\nso would contravene “fundamental principles . . . relating\nto the protection of human rights and fundamental free­\ndoms.” Art. 20, id., at 11.\n   This case concerns another exception to the return\nremedy. Article 12 of the Convention states the general\nrule that when a court receives a petition for return within\none year after the child’s wrongful removal, the court\n“shall order the return of the child forthwith.” Id., at 9.\nArticle 12 further provides that the court,\n    “where the proceedings have been commenced after\n    the expiration of the period of one year [from the date\n    of the wrongful removal], shall also order the return of\n    the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is\n    now settled in its new environment.” Ibid.\nThus, at least in some cases, failure to file a petition\nfor return within one year renders the return remedy\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

That statute instructs courts to “decide\nthe case in accordance with the Convention.” §11603(d).\nEchoing the Convention, ICARA further provides that\n“[c]hildren who are wrongfully removed . . . are to be\npromptly returned unless one of the narrow exceptions set\nforth in the Convention applies.” §11601(a)(4). Finally,\nICARA requires the abducting parent to establish by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Article 12’s exception\nto return applies. §11603(e)(2)(B).\n                                II\n    Diana Lucia Montoya Alvarez and Manuel Jose Lozano\nare the parents of the girl at the center of this dispute.1\nMontoya Alvarez and Lozano met and began dating in\nLondon in early 2004. Montoya Alvarez gave birth to a\ndaughter in October 2005.\n    Montoya Alvarez and Lozano describe their relationship\nin starkly different terms. Lozano stated that they were\n“ ‘very happy together,’ ” albeit with “normal couple prob­\nlems.” In re Lozano, 809 F. Supp. 2d 197, 204 (SDNY\n2011). Montoya Alvarez described a pattern of physical\nand emotional abuse that included multiple incidents of\nrape and battery. The District Court found insufficient\nevidence to make specific findings about domestic violence\nbut determined that Lozano’s claim that he never mis­\ntreated Montoya Alvarez was “not credible.” Id., at 206.\n    The parties also differ as to the child’s well-being during\nthe first three years of her life. Lozano stated that he and\n——————\n  1 Except where otherwise noted, the facts are taken from the District\n\nCourt’s findings. Like the courts below, we refer to Montoya Alvarez\nand Lozano’s daughter as “the child” to protect her identity.\n4              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe child had a very good relationship, and that the child\nwas generally happy. Montoya Alvarez believed other­\nwise. In October 2008, Montoya Alvarez reported to the\nchild’s doctor that she refused to speak at the nursery she\nattended, cried often, and wet the bed. Montoya Alvarez\nalso stated that the child refused to speak when Lozano\nwas present. The child’s nursery manager wrote that the\ngirl was “ ‘very withdrawn,’ ” and noted that the home\n“ ‘environment obviously had a negative effect’ ” on her.\nId., at 207. The District Court found insufficient evidence\nthat Lozano had physically abused the child, but did con­\nclude that the child had seen and heard her parents argu­\ning at home.\n    In November 2008, when the child was just over three\nyears old, Montoya Alvarez went to New York to visit her\nsister Maria. During that time, the child remained in\nLondon with Lozano and his visiting mother. When Mon­\ntoya Alvarez returned on November 18, she became acutely\nconcerned about the child’s fearful behavior around Lo­\nzano. The next day, Montoya Alvarez left with the child\nand never returned.\n    Montoya Alvarez and the child lived at a women’s shel­\nter for the next seven months. After Montoya Alvarez was\nunable to find suitable long-term accommodations in the\nUnited Kingdom, she and the child left for France on July\n3, 2009, and then for the United States, arriving five days\nlater. Since their arrival, Montoya Alvarez and the child\nhave lived with Montoya Alvarez’ sister Maria and her\nfamily in New York.\n    When they arrived in New York, Montoya Alvarez and\nthe child began seeing a therapist at a family medical\nclinic. The therapist testified that, at first, the child was\nwithdrawn and would wet herself. The therapist diag­\nnosed her with posttraumatic stress disorder. Within six\nmonths, however, the therapist described her as “ ‘a com­\npletely different child,’ ” who had stopped wetting herself,\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwas excited to play with friends, and was able to speak\nfreely about her emotions. Id., at 212. When Montoya\nAlvarez and the child returned to the therapist after Lo­\nzano filed a petition for the child’s return, the therapist\nnoted that the child was doing well but did not wish to see\nher father.\n  In the meantime, Lozano attempted to find Montoya\nAlvarez and the child. Shortly after Montoya Alvarez left\nin November 2008, he called her sister Gloria in London,\nbut eventually received legal advice not to speak with\nMontoya Alvarez’ family. A mediation service also sent\nseveral letters to Montoya Alvarez on Lozano’s behalf\nwithout receiving a response. In July 2009, Lozano filed\nan application for a court order in the United Kingdom “ ‘to\nensure that he obtains regular contact with his [child] and\nplays an active role in [her] life.’ ” Id., at 210. He also\nsought court orders to compel Montoya Alvarez’ sisters\nand legal counsel, the child’s doctor and nursery, and\nvarious government offices in London to disclose the\nchild’s whereabouts.\n  On March 15, 2010, after determining that the child was\nnot in the United Kingdom (and suspecting that the child\nwas in New York), Lozano filed a form with the Hague\nConvention Central Authority for England and Wales\nseeking to have the child returned.2 The United States\nCentral Authority—the Office of Children’s Issues in the\nDepartment of State, see 22 CFR §94.2 (2013)—received\nthe application on March 23, 2010. After the Office of\nChildren’s Issues confirmed that Montoya Alvarez had\nentered the United States, Lozano located Montoya Alva­\nrez’ address in New York. On November 10, 2010, more\nthan 16 months after Montoya Alvarez and the child left\n——————\n  2 Article 6 of the Hague Convention requires each Contracting State\n\nto “designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are\nimposed by the Convention upon such authorities.” Treaty Doc., at 8.\n6                LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United Kingdom, Lozano filed a Petition for Return of\nChild pursuant to the Hague Convention and ICARA, 42\nU. S. C. §11603, in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York.\n   After a 2-day evidentiary hearing, the District Court\ndenied Lozano’s petition. 809 F. Supp. 2d 197. The Dis­\ntrict Court concluded that Lozano had stated a prima facie\ncase of wrongful removal under the Hague Convention.\nId., at 219–220. Prior to her removal, the child was a\nhabitual resident of the United Kingdom, see Hague Con­\nvention, Art. 4, and Lozano had custody rights that he\nwas actually exercising at the time of removal, see Arts.\n3(a)–(b).\n   Because the petition was filed more than one year after\nthe child’s wrongful removal, however, the District Court\ndenied the petition on the basis that the child was now\nsettled in New York. Id., at 230, 234. “Viewing the total­\nity of the circumstances,” the court found sufficient indicia\nof “stability in her family, educational, social, and most\nimportantly, home life,” id., at 233, to conclude that the\nchild was settled in her current environment and that\nrepatriation would be “extremely disruptive,” id., at 234.\nLozano argued that the child should be returned forthwith\nbecause the 1-year period in Article 12 should be equitably\ntolled during the period that Montoya Alvarez concealed\nthe child. The court rejected that argument, holding that\nthe 1-year period could not be extended by equitable toll­\ning.3 Id., at 228–229.\n——————\n    3 TheDistrict Court held in the alternative that even if equitable\ntolling could apply, it would not be warranted in this case because\nLozano had contact information for Montoya Alvarez’ sister Maria in\nNew York. Lozano’s solicitors did not attempt to contact Maria to\ndetermine if Montoya Alvarez and the child were there. 809 F. Supp.\n2d, at 229–230.\n  Consistent with Second Circuit precedent, see Blondin v. Dubois, 238\nF. 3d 153, 164 (2001), the District Court also considered “whether to\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

The Court of Appeals agreed that the 1-year per­\niod in Article 12 is not subject to equitable tolling. Accord­\ning to the court, unlike a statute of limitations that would\nprohibit the filing of a return petition after one year, the\n1-year period in Article 12 merely permits courts, after that\nperiod has run, to consider the interests of the child in\nsettlement. Id., at 52. The Second Circuit concluded that\nallowing equitable tolling to delay consideration of the\nchild’s interests would undermine the purpose of the\nHague Convention. Id., at 54.\n  We granted certiorari to decide whether Article 12’s\n1-year period is subject to equitable tolling. 570 U. S. ___\n(2013). Compare 697 F. 3d, at 50–55 (equitable tolling not\navailable); and Yaman v. Yaman, 730 F. 3d 1, 12–16 (CA1\n2013) (same), with Duarte v. Bardales, 526 F. 3d 563, 568–\n570 (CA9 2008) (equitable tolling available); and Furnes v.\nReeves, 362 F. 3d 702, 723–724 (CA11 2004) (same). We\nhold that equitable tolling is not available, and therefore\naffirm.\n                               III\n  Although this case concerns the application of equitable\ntolling to a treaty, we begin with a more familiar context:\nequitable tolling of federal statutes of limitations. As a\ngeneral matter, equitable tolling pauses the running of, or\n“tolls,” a statute of limitations when a litigant has pursued\nhis rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance\nprevents him from bringing a timely action. See, e.g., Pace\nv. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005). Because the\ndoctrine effectively extends an otherwise discrete limita­\n——————\nexercise its discretion and repatriate the child even though she is now\nsettled in New York.” 809 F. Supp. 2d, at 234. The court declined to\nexercise that discretion because the “strong evidence that the child is\nquite settled in New York” outweighed Lozano’s “fairly diligent” search\nefforts and Montoya Alvarez’ conduct. Ibid.\n8              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions period set by Congress, whether equitable tolling is\navailable is fundamentally a question of statutory intent.\nSee, e.g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498\nU. S. 89, 95 (1990); Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S.\n467, 479–480 (1986); Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484, 501\n(1967).\n   As applied to federal statutes of limitations, the inquiry\nbegins with the understanding that Congress “legislate[s]\nagainst a background of common-law adjudicatory princi­\nples.” Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501\nU. S. 104, 108 (1991). Equitable tolling, a long-established\nfeature of American jurisprudence derived from “the old\nchancery rule,” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397\n(1946), is just such a principle. See Young v. United\nStates, 535 U. S. 43, 49–50 (2002) (“Congress must be\npresumed to draft limitations periods in light of this back­\nground principle”); Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 349–350\n(1875). We therefore presume that equitable tolling ap­\nplies if the period in question is a statute of limitations\nand if tolling is consistent with the statute. Young, supra,\nat 49–50 (“It is hornbook law that limitations periods are\n‘customarily subject to “equitable tolling,” ’ unless tolling\nwould be ‘inconsistent with the text of the relevant stat­\nute’ ” (citation omitted)).\n                              IV\n   The Hague Convention, of course, is a treaty, not a\nfederal statute. For treaties, which are primarily “ ‘com­\npact[s] between independent nations,’ ” Medellín v. Texas,\n552 U. S. 491, 505 (2008), our “duty [i]s to ascertain the\nintent of the parties” by looking to the document’s text and\ncontext, United States v. Choctaw Nation, 179 U. S. 494,\n535 (1900); see also BG Group plc v. Republic of Argen­\ntina, post, at 10.\n   We conclude that the parties to the Hague Convention\ndid not intend equitable tolling to apply to the 1-year\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nperiod in Article 12. Unlike federal statutes of limitations,\nthe Convention was not adopted against a shared back­\nground of equitable tolling. Even if the Convention were\nsubject to a presumption that statutes of limitations may\nbe tolled, the 1-year period in Article 12 is not a statute of\nlimitations. And absent a presumption in favor of equita­\nble tolling, nothing in the Convention warrants tolling the\n1-year period.\n                               A\n   First, there is no general presumption that equitable\ntolling applies to treaties. Congress is presumed to incor­\nporate equitable tolling into federal statutes of limitations\nbecause equitable tolling is part of the established back­\ndrop of American law. Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 560\n(2000) (“[F]ederal statutes of limitations are generally\nsubject to equitable principles of tolling”). It does not\nfollow, however, that we can export such background\nprinciples of United States law to contexts outside their\njurisprudential home.\n   It is particularly inappropriate to deploy this back­\nground principle of American law automatically when\ninterpreting a treaty. “A treaty is in its nature a contract\nbetween . . . nations, not a legislative act.” Foster v.\nNeilson, 2 Pet. 253, 314 (1829) (Marshall, C. J., for the\nCourt); see also 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 506\n(J. Elliot 2d ed. 1863) (James Wilson) (“[I]n their nature\ntreaties originate differently from laws. They are made by\nequal parties, and each side has half of the bargain to\nmake . . . ”). That distinction has been reflected in the way\nwe interpret treaties. It is our “responsibility to read the\ntreaty in a manner ‘consistent with the shared expecta­\ntions of the contracting parties.’ ” Olympic Airways v.\nHusain, 540 U. S. 644, 650 (2004) (quoting Air France v.\nSaks, 470 U. S. 392, 399 (1985); emphasis added). Even if\na background principle is relevant to the interpretation of\n10                LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal statutes, it has no proper role in the interpretation\nof treaties unless that principle is shared by the parties to\n“an agreement among sovereign powers,” Zicherman v.\nKorean Air Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217, 226 (1996).\n   Lozano has not identified a background principle of\nequitable tolling that is shared by the signatories to the\nHague Convention. To the contrary, Lozano concedes that\nin the context of the Convention, “foreign courts have\nfailed to adopt equitable tolling . . . because they lac[k] the\npresumption that we [have].” Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–20.\nWhile no signatory state’s court of last resort has resolved\nthe question, intermediate courts of appeals in several\nstates have rejected equitable tolling. See Cannon v.\nCannon, [2004] EWCA (Civ) 1330, [2005] 1 W. L. R. 32,\n¶51 (Eng.), (rejecting the “tolling rule” as “too crude an\napproach” for the Convention); Kubera v. Kubera, 3 B. C.\nL. R. (5th) 121, ¶64, 317 D. L. R. (4th) 307, ¶64 (2010)\n(Can.) (equitable tolling “has not been adopted in other\njurisdictions, including Canada”); see also HJ v. Secretary\nfor Justice, [2006] NZFLR 1005, ¶53 (CA), appeal dism’d\non other grounds, [2007] 2 NZLR 289; A. C. v. P. C., [2005]\nHKEC 839, 2005 WL 836263, ¶55, (Hong Kong Ct. 1st\nInstance).4 The American presumption that federal stat­\nutes of limitations can be equitably tolled therefore does\nnot apply to this multilateral treaty. Cf. Eastern Airlines,\nInc. v. Floyd, 499 U. S. 530, 544–545, and n. 10 (1991)\n(declining to adopt liability for psychic injury under the\nWarsaw Convention because “the unavailability of com­\npensation for purely psychic injury in many common and\ncivil law countries at the time of the Warsaw Conference\npersuades us that the signatories had no specific intent\n——————\n  4 Lozano contends that a single-judge decision by an English family\n\ncourt adopted equitable tolling without referring to it by name. See\nIn re H, [2000] 2 F. L. R. 51, [2000] 3 F. C. R. 404 (Eng.). It is unclear\nwhether the logic of that decision survived the decision of the Court of\nAppeals for England and Wales in Cannon.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto include such a remedy in the Convention” (footnote\nomitted)).\n  It does not matter to this conclusion that Congress\nenacted a statute to implement the Hague Convention.\nSee ICARA, 42 U. S. C. §§11601–11610. ICARA does not\naddress the availability of equitable tolling. Nor does it\npurport to alter the Convention. See §11601(b)(2) (“The\nprovisions of [ICARA] are in addition to and not in lieu of\nthe provisions of the Convention”). In fact, Congress\nexplicitly recognized “the need for uniform international\ninterpretation of the Convention.” §11601(b)(3)(B). Con­\ngress’ mere enactment of implementing legislation did not\nsomehow import background principles of American law\ninto the treaty interpretation process, thereby altering our\nunderstanding of the treaty itself.\n                               B\n   Even if the presumption in favor of equitable tolling had\nforce outside of domestic law, we have only applied that\npresumption to statutes of limitations. See Hallstrom v.\nTillamook County, 493 U. S. 20, 27 (1989) (no equitable\ntolling of a 60-day presuit notice requirement that does\nnot operate as a statute of limitations). The 1-year period\nin Article 12 is not a statute of limitations.\n   As a general matter, “[s]tatutes of limitations establish\nthe period of time within which a claimant must bring an\naction.” Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co.,\n571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4). They characteris­\ntically embody a “policy of repose, designed to protect\ndefendants.” Burnett v. New York Central R. Co., 380\nU. S. 424, 428 (1965). And they foster the “elimination of\nstale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff ’s opportunity\nfor recovery and a defendant’s potential liabilities.” Rotella,\nsupra, at 555.\n   In Young, 535 U. S. 43, we evaluated whether those\ncharacteristics of statutes of limitations were present in\n12                 LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe “three-year lookback period” for tax liabilities in bank­\nruptcy proceedings. The Bankruptcy Code favors tax\nclaims less than three years old in two respects: Such\nclaims cannot be discharged, and they have priority over\ncertain others in bankruptcy proceedings. See 11 U. S. C.\n§§507(a)(8)(A)(i), 523(a)(1)(A). If the Internal Revenue\nService “sleeps on its rights” by failing to prosecute those\nclaims within three years, however, then those mecha­\nnisms for enforcing claims against bankrupt taxpayers are\neliminated. Young, 535 U. S., at 47. We concluded that\nthe lookback period “serves the same ‘basic policies [fur­\nthered by] all limitations provisions,’ ” ibid. (quoting Ro­\ntella, 528 U. S., at 555), i.e., certainty and repose. We\naccordingly held that it was a limitations period\npresumptively subject to equitable tolling. 535 U. S.,\nat 47.\n   Unlike the 3-year lookback period in Young, expiration\nof the 1-year period in Article 12 does not eliminate the\nremedy the Convention affords the left-behind parent—\nnamely, the return of the child. Before one year has\nelapsed, Article 12 provides that the court “shall order the\nreturn of the child forthwith.” Treaty Doc., at 9. But even\nafter that period has expired, the court “shall also order\nthe return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the\nchild is now settled.” Ibid. The continued availability of\nthe return remedy after one year preserves the possibility\nof relief for the left-behind parent and prevents repose\nfor the abducting parent.5 Rather than establishing any\n——————\n  5 Inthe State Department’s view, the Hague Convention confers equi­\ntable discretion on courts to order the return of a child even if the court\ndetermines that the child is “settled” within the meaning of Article 12.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19–25. If accurate, that\ninterpretation would reinforce that Article 12 is not meant to provide\nrepose to the abducting parent, and it would underscore that the 1-year\nperiod is not a statute of limitations. But we do not decide whether,\nand under what circumstances, a court may exercise discretion to order\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                       13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ncertainty about the respective rights of the parties, the\nexpiration of the 1-year period opens the door to consider­\nation of a third party’s interests, i.e., the child’s interest in\nsettlement. Because that is not the sort of interest ad­\ndressed by a statute of limitations, we decline to treat the\n1-year period as a statute of limitations.6\n                              C\n   Without a presumption of equitable tolling, the Conven­\ntion does not support extending the 1-year period during\nconcealment. Article 12 explicitly provides that the 1-year\nperiod commences on “the date of the wrongful removal or\nretention,” and makes no provision for an extension of that\nperiod. Id., at 9. Further, the practical effect of the tolling\nthat Lozano requests would be to delay the commence­\nment of the 1-year period until the left-behind parent\ndiscovers the child’s location. Commencing the 1-year\nperiod upon discovery is the obvious alternative to the\ncommencement date the drafters actually adopted because\nthe subject of the Hague Convention, child abduction, is\nnaturally associated with the sort of concealment that\nmight justify equitable tolling under other circumstances.\nSee 697 F. 3d, at 51, n. 8 (“It would have been a simple\n——————\nreturn notwithstanding the child’s subsequent settlement. In the Court\nof Appeals, Lozano failed to challenge the District Court’s decision not\nto exercise its discretion to order the return of the settled child, see n. 3,\nsupra, and that issue is beyond the scope of the question presented\nbefore this Court.\n  6 Lozano argues that the United States delegation referred to the\n\n1-year period as a “statute of limitations” at various points during and\nafter the drafting process. Brief for Petitioner 27–28. Because the\ndetermination whether the 1-year period is a statute of limitations\ndepends on its functional characteristics, it is not significant that the\ndelegation used that label. In any event, we doubt that the remarks of\na single delegation are sufficient under these circumstances to establish\nthe “ ‘shared expectations of the contracting parties.’ ” Olympic Airways\nv. Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 651 (2004) (quoting Air France v. Saks, 470\nU. S. 392, 399 (1985)).\n14              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmatter, if the state parties to the Convention wished to\ntake account of the possibility that an abducting parent\nmight make it difficult for the petitioning parent to dis­\ncover the child’s whereabouts, to run the period ‘from the\ndate that the petitioning parent learned [or, could reason­\nably have learned] of the child’s whereabouts’ ” (alterations\nin original)). Given that the drafters did not adopt that\nalternative, the natural implication is that they did not\nintend the 1-year period to commence on that later date.\nCf. Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 10–11). We cannot revisit that\nchoice.\n   Lozano contends that equitable tolling is nevertheless\nconsistent with the purpose of the Hague Convention\nbecause it is necessary to deter child abductions. In his\nview, “absent equitable tolling, concealment ‘probably will’\nresult in non-return,” which will in turn encourage abduc­\ntion. Reply Brief 14–15; see also Duarte, 526 F. 3d, at 570.\n   We agree, of course, that the Convention reflects a\ndesign to discourage child abduction. But the Convention\ndoes not pursue that goal at any cost. The child’s interest\nin choosing to remain, Art. 13, or in avoiding physical or\npsychological harm, Art. 13(b), may overcome the return\nremedy. The same is true of the child’s interest in settle­\nment. See supra, at 2; see also In re M, [2008] 1 A. C.\n1288, 1310 (Eng. 2007) (opinion of Baroness Hale of Rich­\nmond) (“These children should not be made to suffer for\nthe sake of general deterrence of the evil of child abduc­\ntion world wide”). We are unwilling to apply equitable\ntolling principles that would, in practice, rewrite the treaty.\nSee Chan v. Korean Air Lines, Ltd., 490 U. S. 122, 134–\n135 (1989) (“ ‘[T]o alter, amend, or add to any treaty by\ninserting any clause, whether small or great, important\nor trivial, would be . . . to make, and not to construe a\ntreaty’ ” (quoting The Amiable Isabella, 6 Wheat. 1, 71\n(1821) (Story, J., for the Court))).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor is it true that an abducting parent who conceals a\nchild’s whereabouts will necessarily profit by running out\nthe clock on the 1-year period. American courts have\nfound as a factual matter that steps taken to promote\nconcealment can also prevent the stable attachments that\nmake a child “settled.” See, e.g., Mendez Lynch v. Mendez\nLynch, 220 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1363–1364 (MD Fla. 2002)\n(children not settled when they “lived in seven different\nlocations” in 18 months); Wigley v. Hares, 82 So. 3d 932,\n942 (Fla. App. 2011) (“The mother purposely kept him out\nof all community activities, sports, and even church to\navoid detection by the father”); In re Coffield, 96 Ohio App.\n3d 52, 58, 644 N. E. 2d 662, 666 (1994) (child not settled\nwhen the abducting parent “was attempting to hide\n[child’s] identity” by withholding child from school and\nother organized activities). Other signatories to the\nHague Convention have likewise recognized that conceal­\nment may be taken into account in the factual determina­\ntion whether the child is settled. See, e.g., Cannon, [2005]\n1 W. L. R., ¶¶52–61. See also Kubera, 3 B. C. L. R. (5th),\n¶47, 317 D. L. R. (4th), ¶47; A. C. v. P. C., [2005] HKEC\n839, ¶39, 2005 WL 836263, ¶39. Equitable tolling is\ntherefore neither required by the Convention nor the only\navailable means to advance its objectives.\n                             D\n  Finally, Lozano contends that the Hague Convention\nleaves room for United States courts to apply their own\n“common law doctrine of equitable tolling” to the 1-year\nperiod in Article 12 without regard to whether the drafters\nof the Convention intended equitable tolling to apply.\nBrief for Petitioner 25. Specifically, Lozano contends that\nthe Convention recognizes additional sources of law that\npermit signatory states to return abducted children even\nwhen return is not available or required pursuant to the\nConvention. Article 34 of the Convention provides that\n16             LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“for the purpos[e] of obtaining the return of a child,” the\nConvention “shall not restrict the application of an inter­\nnational instrument in force between the State of origin\nand the State addressed” or the application of “other law\nof the State addressed.” Treaty Doc., at 13; see also Art.\n18, id., at 11 (“The provisions of this Chapter do not limit\nthe power of a judicial or administrative authority to order\nthe return of the child at any time”). In Lozano’s view,\nequitable tolling principles constitute “other law” that\nshould apply here.\n   That contention mistakes the nature of equitable tolling\nas this Court has applied it. We do not apply equitable\ntolling as a matter of some independent authority to re­\nconsider the fairness of legislative judgments balancing\nthe needs for relief and repose. See supra, at 7–8. To the\ncontrary, we may apply equitable tolling to the Hague\nConvention only if we determine that the treaty drafters\nso intended. See Choctaw Nation, 179 U. S., at 535. For\nthe foregoing reasons, we conclude that they did not.\n                             V\n  The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the 1-year\nperiod in Article 12 of the Hague Convention is not subject\nto equitable tolling. We therefore affirm that court’s\njudgment.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

I write sepa­\nrately to explain why courts have equitable discretion\nunder the Hague Convention to order a child’s return even\nafter the child has become settled, and how that discretion\nprevents abuses that petitioner claims will follow from\nholding that Article 12’s 1-year period may not be equita­\nbly tolled.\n  The Convention is designed to protect the interests of\nchildren and their parents. Much of the Convention can\nbe understood as an attempt to balance the various inter­\nests of children and non-abducting parents when a par-\nent abducts a child from the child’s country of habitual\nresidence.\n  When a child has been absent from the country of ha­\nbitual residence for less than a year, the Convention con­\nclusively presumes that the child’s nascent attachment to\nthe new country is outweighed by the non-abducting par­\nent’s interest in prompt return and the child’s own inter­\nest in returning to the country from which he or she was\nremoved just a few months previously. This is why Article\n12 requires return “forthwith” if the petition for return\nis brought within a year of abduction, unless one of the\nnarrow exceptions set forth in Article 13 or 20 applies.\n2              LOZANO v.

No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99–11\n(Treaty Doc.), p. 9. But, as the Convention recognizes, at\nsome point the child will become accustomed to the new\nenvironment, making Article 12’s conclusive presumption\ninappropriate. Thus, if the petition for return is brought\nafter a year has elapsed, the court must determine whether\nthe child has become “settled” in the new country; and if\nthis has occurred, the court need not order return. Ibid.\nAs the majority recognizes, this provision of the Conven­\ntion “opens the door to consideration of . . . the child’s\ninterest in settlement.” Ante, at 13.\n   But opening the door to consideration of the child’s\nattachment to the new country does not mean closing the\ndoor to evaluating all other interests of the child and\nthe non-abducting parent. The fact that, after one year,\na child’s need for stability requires a court to take into\naccount the child’s attachment to the new country does not\nmean that such attachment becomes the only factor worth\nconsidering when evaluating a petition for return.\n   Nothing in Article 12 prohibits courts from taking other\nfactors into account. To the contrary, the Convention\nexplicitly permits them to do so. Article 18 provides that\n“[t]he provisions of this Chapter [including Article 12] do\nnot limit the power of a judicial or administrative author­\nity to order the return of the child at any time.” Hague\nConvention, Treaty Doc., at 11. A court thus has power to\norder the child’s return in the exercise of its sound discre­\ntion even where Article 12’s obligation to order such re­\nturn no longer applies.\n   This provision makes eminent sense. Even after a year\nhas elapsed and the child has become settled in the new\nenvironment, a variety of factors may outweigh the child’s\ninterest in remaining in the new country, such as the\nchild’s interest in returning to his or her original country\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nof residence (with which he or she may still have close ties,\ndespite having become settled in the new country); the\nchild’s need for contact with the non-abducting parent,\nwho was exercising custody when the abduction occurred;\nthe non-abducting parent’s interest in exercising the cus­\ntody to which he or she is legally entitled; the need to\ndiscourage inequitable conduct (such as concealment) by\nabducting parents; and the need to deter international\nabductions generally.\n   Article 12 places no limit on Article 18’s grant of discre­\ntionary power to order return. Article 18 expressly states\nas much. See ibid. (Article 12 “do[es] not limit the power\nof a judicial or administrative authority to order the re­\nturn of the child”). Even without Article 18’s express\nlanguage, it would be clear that Article 12 merely tells a\ncourt when it must order return, without telling it when it\nmay do so. Article 12 states that, after the 1-year period\nhas elapsed, a court “shall . . . order the return of the\nchild, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now\nsettled in its new environment.” Id., at 9. The final clause\nindicates when the obligation imposed earlier in the sen­\ntence terminates; it does not substitute for that obligation\na prohibition on ordering return. When a mother tells her\nchild, “Come straight home from school, unless one of your\nfriends invites you to a movie,” the mother has not prohib­\nited her child from coming home immediately after school\neven if a friend proposes a film. Cf. Department of Com-\nmerce v. United States House of Representatives, 525 U. S.\n316, 339 (1999) (explaining that the meaning of a similar\nsentence structure in 13 U. S. C. §195 “depends primarily\non the broader context in which that structure appears”).\nThus, nothing in Article 12 calls into question the discre­\ntionary power of courts to order return after the 1-year\nperiod has expired and the child has become settled.\n   Reading the Convention to impose a prohibition on\nreturn would be highly anomalous, given that the “Con­\n4              LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nvention is based on the principle that the best interests of\nthe child are well served when decisions regarding custody\nrights are made in the country of habitual residence.”\nAbbott v. Abbott, 560 U. S. 1, 20 (2010). Such a prohibi­\ntion would run counter to other provisions of the Conven­\ntion. For instance, Article 13(b) gives a court discretion to\nreturn or decline to return a child who has not become\nsettled if “there is a grave risk that . . . return would\nexpose the child to physical or psychological harm or\notherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.”\nHague Convention, Treaty Doc., at 10. If a court has\ndiscretion to order return even where such return poses “a\ngrave risk” of harm or threatens to place the child in an\n“intolerable situation,” surely it has discretion to order\nreturn when faced with the lesser risk attendant on re­\nmoving a child from the child’s present environment (espe­\ncially given that the child will generally be returning to a\nknown environment: her country of habitual residence).\n   The State Department has adopted the view that the\nConvention empowers a court, in its equitable discretion,\nto return a child who has become settled. In the analysis\nthat it provided to the Senate in connection with the rati­\nfication process, the Department made clear that, even\nwhen a year has elapsed and the child has become settled,\na court may still consider such factors as “evidence . . .\nconcerning the child’s contacts with and ties to his or her\nState of habitual residence,” “[t]he reason for the passage\nof time,” and any concealment by the abducting parent in\ndetermining whether to order return. Hague International\nChild Abduction Convention; Text and Legal Analysis\n(State Legal Analysis), 51 Fed. Reg. 10494, 10509 (1986).\nThe Department continues to endorse this view today. See\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19. As this\nCourt has previously explained (in the context of the\nConvention, in fact), the State Department’s interpreta­\ntion of treaties “ ‘is entitled to great weight.’ ” Abbott,\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nsupra, at 15 (quoting Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v.\nAvagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 185 (1982)).\n   So, too, is the interpretation of the courts of our sister\nsignatories. See Abbott, supra, at 16. The United King­\ndom’s House of Lords (at the time that nation’s highest\ncourt) has held that “a settled child might nevertheless be\nreturned” by a court in the exercise of its discretion—\na conclusion driven in part by acknowledgment of the in­\nequity of rewarding concealment. In re M, [2008] 1 A. C.\n1288, 1304, ¶31 (Eng. 2007) (opinion of Baroness Hale of\nRichmond). Likewise, the Supreme Court of Ireland has\nconcluded that courts have equitable discretion to order\nreturn of a child who has become settled. See P. v. B. (No.\n2), [1999] 4 I. R. 185. I am unaware of any high courts of\nstates signatory that have concluded to the contrary.\n   Given the foregoing, it is perhaps unsurprising that the\nCourts of Appeals to have considered the question have\nfound that a court possesses equitable discretion to order\nreturn of a child despite the child’s having become settled\nin the new country. See Yaman v. Yaman, 730 F. 3d 1, 21\n(CA1 2013); Blondin v. Dubois, 238 F. 3d 153, 164 (CA2\n2001). And other Courts of Appeals have found more\ngenerally that none of the Convention’s exceptions prohibit\nreturn. See, e.g., Asvesta v. Petroutsas, 580 F. 3d 1000,\n1004 (CA9 2009); Miller v. Miller, 240 F. 3d 392, 402 (CA4\n2001).\n   Equitable discretion to order return of a settled child is\nparticularly important in light of the fact that the Conven­\ntion, as the Court correctly holds today, does not provide\nfor equitable tolling of Article 12’s 1-year period. Peti­\ntioner predicts dire consequences from the Court’s holding.\nHe argues that, as a result of our decision, the United\nStates will become an abduction haven, with parents\nconcealing their children here until Article 12’s 1-year\nperiod has run and then claiming their children have\nbecome settled and hence ineligible for return. But such\n6               LOZANO v. MONTOYA ALVAREZ\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\ninequitable conduct would weigh heavily in favor of re­\nturning a child even if she has become settled. See, e.g.,\nState Legal Analysis, 51 Fed. Reg. 10509 (“If the alleged\nwrongdoer concealed the child’s whereabouts from the\ncustodian necessitating a long search for the child and\nthereby delayed the commencement of a return proceeding\nby the applicant, it is highly questionable whether the\nrespondent should be permitted to benefit from such con­\nduct absent strong countervailing considerations”); In re\nM, supra, at 1310, ¶31 (recognizing that a court may take\nconcealment into account in considering whether to return\na settled child). Given the courts’ discretion to order\nreturn in response to concealment, I do not believe the\nCourt’s decision today risks incentivizing parents to flee\nwith their children to this country and conceal them.\n   Equitable discretion is also a far better tool than equita­\nble tolling with which to address the dangers of conceal­\nment. Equitable tolling would require return every time\nthe abducting parent conceals the child and thereby pre­\nvents the non-abducting parent from filing a return peti­\ntion within a year, regardless of how settled in the new\ncountry the child has become. Thus, on petitioner’s view,\na court would be bound to return a 14-year-old child who\nwas brought to the United States shortly after birth and\nhad been concealed here ever since. By contrast, when a\ncourt exercises its equitable discretion, it may consider\nother factors in addition to concealment. While conceal­\nment is a significant factor and should weigh heavily in a\ncourt’s analysis, in appropriate cases it can be overcome by\ncircumstances such as the extended length of the child’s\nresidence in this country, any strong ties the child has\nformed here, and the child’s attenuated connections to his\nor her former country.\n   In short, I believe the power of a court, in the exercise of\nits sound discretion, to return even a settled child pre­\nvents the inapplicability of equitable tolling to Article 12’s\n                 Cite as: 572 U.
