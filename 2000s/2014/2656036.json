Argued January 14, 2014—Decided March 10, 2014\nCongress passed the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875 to pro-\n  vide railroad companies “right[s] of way through the public lands of\n  the United States,” 43 U. S. C. §934. One such right of way, obtained\n  by a railroad in 1908, crosses land that the United States conveyed to\n  the Brandt family in a 1976 land patent. That patent stated, as rele-\n  vant here, that the land was granted subject to the railroad’s rights\n  in the 1875 Act right of way, but it did not specify what would occur if\n  the railroad later relinquished those rights. Years later, a successor\n  railroad abandoned the right of way with federal approval. The Gov-\n  ernment then sought a judicial declaration of abandonment and an\n  order quieting title in the United States to the abandoned right of\n  way, including the stretch that crossed the land conveyed in the\n  Brandt patent. Petitioners contested the claim, asserting that the\n  right of way was a mere easement that was extinguished when the\n  railroad abandoned it, so that Brandt now enjoys full title to his land\n  without the burden of the easement. The Government countered that\n  the 1875 Act granted the railroad something more than a mere ease-\n  ment, and that the United States retained a reversionary interest in\n  that land once the railroad abandoned it. The District Court granted\n  summary judgment to the Government and quieted title in the Unit-\n  ed States to the right of way. The Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The right of way was an easement that was terminated by the\n railroad’s abandonment, leaving Brandt’s land unburdened. Pp. 8–\n 17.\n    (a) The Government loses this case in large part because it won\n when it argued the opposite in Great Northern R. Co. v. United\n States, 315 U. S. 262. There, the Government contended that the\n2             MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n                         UNITED STATES                                     \n\n                            Syllabus\n\n\n    1875 Act (unlike pre-1871 statutes granting rights of way) granted\n    nothing more than an easement, and that the railroad in that case\n    therefore had no interest in the resources beneath the surface of its\n    right of way. This Court adopted the Government’s position in full.\n    It found the 1875 Act’s text “wholly inconsistent” with the grant of a\n    fee interest, id., at 271; agreed with the Government that cases de-\n    scribing the nature of rights of way granted prior to 1871 were “not\n    controlling” because of a major shift in congressional policy concern-\n    ing land grants to railroads after that year, id., at 278; and held that\n    the 1875 Act “clearly grants only an easement,” id., at 271. Under\n    well-established common law property principles, an easement dis-\n    appears when abandoned by its beneficiary, leaving the owner of the\n    underlying land to resume a full and unencumbered interest in the\n    land. See Smith v. Townsend, 148 U. S. 490, 499. Pp. 8–12.\n       (b) The Government asks this Court to limit Great Northern’s char-\n    acterization of 1875 Act rights of way as easements to the question of\n    who owns the oil and minerals beneath a right of way. But nothing\n    in the 1875 Act’s text supports that reading, and the Government’s\n    reliance on the similarity of the language in the 1875 Act and pre-\n    1871 statutes directly contravenes the very premise of Great North-\n    ern: that the 1875 Act granted a fundamentally different interest\n    than did its predecessor statutes. Nor do this Court’s decisions in\n    Stalker v. Oregon Short Line R. Co., 225 U. S. 142, and Great North-\n    ern R. Co. v. Steinke, 261 U. S. 119, support the Government’s posi-\n    tion. The dispute in each of those cases was framed in terms of com-\n    peting claims to acquire and develop a particular tract of land, and it\n    does not appear that the Court considered—much less rejected—an\n    argument that the railroad had only an easement in the contested\n    land. But to the extent that those cases could be read to imply that\n    the interest was something more, any such implication would not\n    have survived this Court’s unequivocal statement to the contrary in\n    Great Northern. Finally, later enacted statutes, see 43 U. S. C.\n    §§912, 940; 16 U. S. C. §1248(c), do not define or shed light on the na-\n    ture of the interest Congress granted to railroads in their rights of\n    way in 1875. They instead purport only to dispose of interests (if\n    any) the United States already possesses. Pp. 12–17.\n496 Fed. Appx. 822, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

The settlers and their successors remained, but\nmany of the railroads did not. This case presents the\nquestion of what happens to a railroad’s right of way\ngranted under a particular statute—the General Railroad\nRight-of-Way Act of 1875—when the railroad abandons it:\ndoes it go to the Government, or to the private party who\nacquired the land underlying the right of way?\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  In the early to mid-19th century, America looked west.\nThe period from the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 to the\nGadsden Purchase in 1853 saw the acquisition of the\nwestern lands that filled out what is now the contiguous\n2         MARVIN M.

New technol­\nogy provided the answer: the railroad. The Civil War\nspurred the effort to develop a transcontinental railroad,\nas the Federal Government saw the need to protect its\ncitizens and secure its possessions in the West. Leo Sheep\nCo. v. United States, 440 U. S. 668, 674–676 (1979). The\nconstruction of such a railroad would “furnish a cheap and\nexpeditious mode for the transportation of troops and\nsupplies,” help develop “the agricultural and mineral\nresources of this territory,” and foster settlement. United\nStates v. Union Pacific R. Co., 91 U. S. 72, 80 (1875).\n   The substantial benefits a transcontinental railroad\ncould bring were clear, but building it was no simple\nmatter. The risks were great and the costs were stagger­\ning. Popular sentiment grew for the Government to play a\nrole in supporting the massive project. Indeed, in 1860,\nPresident Lincoln’s winning platform proclaimed: “That a\nrailroad to the Pacific Ocean is imperatively demanded by\nthe interests of the whole country; that the Federal Gov­\nernment ought to render immediate and efficient aid in its\nconstruction.” J. Ely, Railroads and American Law 51\n(2001). But how to do it? Sufficient funds were not at\nhand (especially with a Civil War to fight), and there were\nserious reservations about the legal authority for direct\nfinancing. “The policy of the country, to say nothing of the\nsupposed want of constitutional power, stood in the way of\nthe United States taking the work into its own hands.”\nUnion Pacific R. Co., supra, at 81.\n   What the country did have, however, was land—lots of\nit. It could give away vast swaths of public land—which at\nthe time possessed little value without reliable transporta­\ntion—in hopes that such grants would increase the appeal\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

In the early 1860s, Congress began\ngranting to railroad companies rights of way through the\npublic domain, accompanied by outright grants of land\nalong those rights of way. P. Gates, History of Public Land\nLaw Development 362–368 (1968). The land was con-\nveyed in checkerboard blocks. For example, under the\nUnion Pacific Act of 1862, odd-numbered lots of one square\nmile apiece were granted to the railroad, while even­\nnumbered lots were retained by the United States. Leo\nSheep Co., supra, at 672–673, 686, n. 23. Railroads could\nthen either develop their lots or sell them, to finance\nconstruction of rail lines and encourage the settlement of\nfuture customers. Indeed, railroads became the largest\nsecondary dispenser of public lands, after the States.\nGates, supra, at 379.\n  But public resentment against such generous land\ngrants to railroads began to grow in the late 1860s. West­\nern settlers, initially some of the staunchest supporters of\ngovernmental railroad subsidization, complained that the\nrailroads moved too slowly in placing their lands on the\nmarket and into the hands of farmers and settlers. Citi­\nzens and Members of Congress argued that the grants\nconflicted with the goal of the Homestead Act of 1862 to\nencourage individual citizens to settle and develop the\nfrontier lands. By the 1870s, legislators across the politi­\ncal spectrum had embraced a policy of reserving public\nlands for settlers rather than granting them to railroads.\nId., at 380, 454–456.\n  A House resolution adopted in 1872 summed up the\nchange in national policy, stating:\n    “That in the judgment of this House the policy of\n    granting subsidies in public lands to railroads and\n    other corporations ought to be discontinued, and that\n    every consideration of public policy and equal justice\n4        MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n                    UNITED STATES                           \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n    to the whole people requires that the public lands\n    should be held for the purpose of securing homesteads\n    to actual settlers, and for educational purposes, as\n    may be provided by law.” Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d\n    Sess., 1585.\nCongress enacted the last checkerboard land-grant statute\nfor railroads in 1871. Gates, supra, at 380. Still wishing\nto encourage railroad construction, however, Congress\npassed at least 15 special acts between 1871 and 1875\ngranting to designated railroads “the right of way”\nthrough public lands, without any accompanying land\nsubsidy. Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 315 U. S.\n262, 274, and n. 9 (1942).\n   Rather than continue to enact special legislation for\neach such right of way, Congress passed the General\nRailroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 482, 43\nU. S. C. §§934–939. The 1875 Act provided that “[t]he\nright of way through the public lands of the United States\nis granted to any railroad company” meeting certain re­\nquirements, “to the extent of one hundred feet on each side\nof the central line of said road.” §934. A railroad company\ncould obtain a right of way by the “actual construction of\nits road” or “in advance of construction by filing a map as\nprovided in section four” of the Act. Jamestown & North-\nern R. Co. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 125, 130–131 (1900). Section\n4 in turn provided that a company could “secure” its right\nof way by filing a proposed map of its rail corridor with a\nlocal Department of the Interior office within 12 months\nafter survey or location of the road. §937. Upon approval\nby the Interior Department, the right of way would be\nnoted on the land plats held at the local office, and from\nthat day forward “all such lands over which such right of\nway shall pass shall be disposed of subject to the right\nof way.” Ibid.\n   The 1875 Act remained in effect until 1976, when its\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

This case requires us to\ndefine the nature of the interest granted by the 1875 Act,\nin order to determine what happens when a railroad\nabandons its right of way.\n                                B\n    Melvin M. Brandt began working at a sawmill in Fox\nPark, Wyoming, in 1939. He later purchased the sawmill\nand, in 1946, moved his family to Fox Park. Melvin’s son\nMarvin started working at the sawmill in 1958 and came\nto own and operate it in 1976 until it closed, 15 years\nlater.\n    In 1976, the United States patented an 83-acre parcel of\nland in Fox Park, surrounded by the Medicine Bow-Routt\nNational Forest, to Melvin and Lulu Brandt. (A land\npatent is an official document reflecting a grant by a\nsovereign that is made public, or “patent.”) The patent\nconveyed to the Brandts fee simple title to the land “with\nall the rights, privileges, immunities, and appurtenances,\nof whatsoever nature, thereunto belonging, unto said\nclaimants, their successors and assigns, forever.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 76. But the patent did include limited excep­\ntions and reservations. For example, the patent “except[s]\nand reserv[es] to the United States from the land granted\na right-of-way thereon for ditches or canals constructed\nby the authority of the United States”; “reserv[es] to the\nUnited States . . . a right-of-way for the existing Platte\nAccess Road No. 512”; and “reserv[es] to the United States\n. . . a right-of-way for the existing Dry Park Road No. 517.”\nId., at 76–77 (capitalization omitted). But if those roads\ncease to be used by the United States or its assigns for a\nperiod of five years, the patent provides that “the ease­\nment traversed thereby shall terminate.” Id., at 78.\n    Most relevant to this case, the patent concludes by\n6              MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n                          UNITED STATES                               \n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\nstating that the land was granted “subject to those rights for\nrailroad purposes as have been granted to the Lar­\namie[,] Hahn’s Peak & Pacific Railway Company, its suc­\ncessors or assigns.” Ibid. (capitalization omitted). The\npatent did not specify what would occur if the railroad\nabandoned this right of way.\n  The right of way referred to in the patent was obtained\nby the Laramie, Hahn’s Peak and Pacific Railroad\n(LHP&P) in 1908, pursuant to the 1875 Act.1 The right of\nway is 66 miles long and 200 feet wide, and it meanders\nsouth from Laramie, Wyoming, through the Medicine\nBow-Routt National Forest, to the Wyoming-Colorado\nborder. Nearly a half-mile stretch of the right of way\ncrosses Brandt’s land in Fox Park, covering ten acres of\nthat parcel.\n  In 1911, the LHP&P completed construction of its rail­\nway over the right of way, from Laramie to Coalmont,\nColorado. Its proprietors had rosy expectations, proclaim­\ning that it would become “one of the most important rail­\nroad systems in this country.” Laramie, Hahns Peak and\nPacific Railway System: The Direct Gateway to Southern\nWyoming, Northern Colorado, and Eastern Utah 24\n(1910). But the railroad ultimately fell short of that goal.\nRather than shipping coal and other valuable ores as\noriginally hoped, the LHP&P was used primarily to\ntransport timber and cattle. R. King, Trails to Rails: A\nHistory of Wyoming’s Railroads 90 (2003). Largely be­\ncause of high operating costs during Wyoming winters, the\nLHP&P never quite achieved financial stability.

King,\nsupra, at 90. That did not prove profitable either, and in\n1996 the Wyoming and Colorado notified the Surface\nTransportation Board of its intent to abandon the right of\nway. The railroad tore up the tracks and ties and, after\nreceiving Board approval, completed abandonment in\n2004. In 2006 the United States initiated this action\nseeking a judicial declaration of abandonment and an\norder quieting title in the United States to the abandoned\nright of way. In addition to the railroad, the Government\nnamed as defendants the owners of 31 parcels of land\ncrossed by the abandoned right of way.\n   The Government settled with or obtained a default\njudgment against all but one of those landowners—Marvin\nBrandt. He contested the Government’s claim and filed a\ncounterclaim on behalf of a family trust that now owns the\nFox Park parcel, and himself as trustee.2 Brandt asserted\nthat the stretch of the right of way crossing his family’s\nland was a mere easement that was extinguished upon\nabandonment by the railroad, so that, under common law\nproperty rules, he enjoyed full title to the land without the\nburden of the easement. The Government countered that\nit had all along retained a reversionary interest in the\nrailroad right of way—that is, a future estate that would\nbe restored to the United States if the railroad abandoned\n——————\n  2 The other landowners had a potential interest in much smaller\n\nacreages: No other party could claim an interest in more than three\nacres of the right of way, and only six of the 31 potential claims\namounted to more than one acre.

Brandt, 496 Fed. Appx. 822 (CA10 2012)\n(per curiam). The court acknowledged division among\nlower courts regarding the nature of the Government’s\ninterest (if any) in abandoned 1875 Act rights of way. But\nit concluded based on Circuit precedent that the United\nStates had retained an “implied reversionary interest” in\nthe right of way, which then vested in the United States\nwhen the right of way was relinquished. Id., at 824.\n   We granted certiorari. 570 U. S. __ (2013).\n                             II\n  This dispute turns on the nature of the interest the\nUnited States conveyed to the LHP&P in 1908 pursuant\nto the 1875 Act. Brandt contends that the right of way\ngranted under the 1875 Act was an easement, so that\nwhen the railroad abandoned it, the underlying land\n(Brandt’s Fox Park parcel) simply became unburdened of\nthe easement. The Government does not dispute that\neasements normally work this way, but maintains that the\n1875 Act granted the railroads something more than an\neasement, reserving an implied reversionary interest in\nthat something more to the United States. The Govern­\nment loses that argument today, in large part because it\nwon when it argued the opposite before this Court more\nthan 70 years ago, in the case of Great Northern Railway\nCo. v. United States, 315 U. S. 262 (1942).\n  In 1907, Great Northern succeeded to an 1875 Act right\n——————\n    3 TheDistrict Court dismissed without prejudice Brandt’s separate\ncounterclaim for just compensation. Brandt then filed a takings claim\nin the Court of Federal Claims. That case has been stayed pending the\ndisposition of this one.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Oil was later discovered in the area, and Great\nNorthern wanted to drill beneath its right of way. But\nthe Government sued to enjoin the railroad from doing\nso, claiming that the railroad had only an easement, so\nthat the United States retained all interests beneath the\nsurface.\n  This Court had indeed previously held that the pre-1871\nstatutes, granting rights of way accompanied by checker­\nboard land subsidies, conveyed to the railroads “a limited\nfee, made on an implied condition of reverter.” See, e.g.,\nNorthern Pacific R. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267, 271\n(1903). Great Northern relied on those cases to contend\nthat it owned a “fee” interest in the right of way, which\nincluded the right to drill for minerals beneath the\nsurface.\n  The Government disagreed. It argued that “the 1875\nAct granted an easement and nothing more,” and that the\nrailroad accordingly could claim no interest in the re­\nsources beneath the surface. Brief for United States in\nGreat Northern R. Co. v. United States, O. T. 1941, No.\n149, p. 29. “The year 1871 marks the end of one era and\nthe beginning of a new in American land-grant history,”\nthe Government contended; thus, cases construing the\npre-1871 statutes were inapplicable in construing the 1875\nAct, id., at 15, 29–30. Instead, the Government argued,\nthe text, background, and subsequent administrative and\ncongressional construction of the 1875 Act all made clear\nthat, unlike rights of way granted under pre-1871 land­\ngrant statutes, those granted under the 1875 Act were\nmere easements.\n  The Court adopted the United States’ position in full,\nholding that the 1875 Act “clearly grants only an ease­\nment, and not a fee.” Great Northern, 315 U. S., at 271.\nThe Court found Section 4 of the Act “especially persua­\nsive,” because it provided that “all such lands over which\n10        MARVIN M.

Calling this language “wholly\ninconsistent” with the grant of a fee interest, the Court\nendorsed the lower court’s statement that “[a]pter words\nto indicate the intent to convey an easement would be\ndifficult to find.” Ibid.\n   That interpretation was confirmed, the Court explained,\nby the historical background against which the 1875 Act\nwas passed and by subsequent administrative and con­\ngressional interpretation. The Court accepted the Gov­\nernment’s position that prior cases describing the nature\nof pre-1871 rights of way—including Townsend, supra, at\n271—were “not controlling,” because of the shift in con­\ngressional policy after that year. Great Northern, supra,\nat 277–278, and n. 18. The Court also specifically disa­\nvowed the characterization of an 1875 Act right of way in\nRio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44\n(1915), as “ ‘a limited fee, made on an implied condition of\nreverter.’ ” Great Northern, supra, at 278–279 (quoting\nStringham, supra, at 47). The Court noted that in String-\nham “it does not appear that Congress’ change of policy\nafter 1871 was brought to the Court’s attention,” given\nthat “[n]o brief was filed by the defendant or the United\nStates” in that case. Great Northern, supra, at 279, and\nn. 20.\n   The dissent is wrong to conclude that Great Northern\nmerely held that “the right of way did not confer one\nparticular attribute of fee title.” Post, at 3 (opinion\nof SOTOMAYOR, J.). To the contrary, the Court specifically\nrejected the notion that the right of way conferred even a\n“limited fee.” 315 U. S., at 279; see also id., at 277–278\n(declining to follow cases describing a right of way as a\n“limited,” “base,” or “qualified” fee). Instead, the Court\nconcluded, it was “clear from the language of the Act, its\nlegislative history, its early administrative interpretation\nand the construction placed upon it by Congress in subse­\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Union Pacific R.\nCo., 353 U. S. 112, 119 (1957) (noting the conclusion in\nGreat Northern that, in the period after 1871, “only an\neasement for railroad purposes was granted”); 353 U. S.,\nat 128 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (observing that the\nCourt “conclude[d] in the Great Northern case that a right\nof way granted by the 1875 Act was an easement and not a\nlimited fee”).\n   When the United States patented the Fox Park parcel to\nBrandt’s parents in 1976, it conveyed fee simple title to\nthat land, “subject to those rights for railroad purposes”\nthat had been granted to the LHP&P. The United States\ndid not reserve to itself any interest in the right of way in\nthat patent. Under Great Northern, the railroad thus had\nan easement in its right of way over land owned by the\nBrandts.\n   The essential features of easements—including, most\nimportant here, what happens when they cease to be\nused—are well settled as a matter of property law. An\neasement is a “nonpossessory right to enter and use land\nin the possession of another and obligates the possessor\nnot to interfere with the uses authorized by the easement.”\nRestatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes §1.2(1)\n(1998). “Unlike most possessory estates, easements . . .\nmay be unilaterally terminated by abandonment, leaving\nthe servient owner with a possessory estate unencum­\nbered by the servitude.” Id., §1.2, Comment d; id., §7.4,\nComments a, f. In other words, if the beneficiary of the\neasement abandons it, the easement disappears, and the\nlandowner resumes his full and unencumbered interest in\nthe land. See Smith v. Townsend, 148 U. S. 490, 499\n(1893) (“[W]hoever obtained title from the government to\nany . . . land through which ran this right of way would\nacquire a fee to the whole tract subject to the easement of\n12          MARVIN M.

Atty. Gen. 250, 254\n(1879) (“the purchasers or grantees of the United States\ntook the fee of the lands patented to them subject to the\neasement created by the act of 1824; but on a discontinu­\nance or abandonment of that right of way the entire and\nexclusive property, and right of enjoyment thereto, vested\nin the proprietors of the soil”).4\n  Those basic common law principles resolve this case.\nWhen the Wyoming and Colorado Railroad abandoned the\nright of way in 2004, the easement referred to in the\nBrandt patent terminated. Brandt’s land became unbur­\ndened of the easement, conferring on him the same full\nrights over the right of way as he enjoyed over the rest of\nthe Fox Park parcel.\n                           III\n  Contrary to that straightforward conclusion, the Gov­\nernment now tells us that Great Northern did not really\nmean what it said. Emphasizing that Great Northern\ninvolved only the question of who owned the oil and min-\n\n——————\n   4 Because granting an easement merely gives the grantee the right to\n\nenter and use the grantor’s land for a certain purpose, but does not give\nthe grantee any possessory interest in the land, it does not make sense\nunder common law property principles to speak of the grantor of an\neasement having retained a “reversionary interest.” A reversionary\ninterest is “any future interest left in a transferor or his successor in\ninterest.” Restatement (First) of Property §154(1)(1936). It arises\nwhen the grantor “transfers less than his entire interest” in a piece of\nland, and it is either certain or possible that he will retake the trans­\nferred interest at a future date. Id., Comment a. Because the grantor\nof an easement has not transferred his estate or possessory interest, he\nhas not retained a reversionary interest. He retains all his ownership\ninterest, subject to an easement. See Preseault v. United States, 100\nF. 3d 1525, 1533–1534 (CA Fed. 1996) (en banc).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nerals beneath a right of way, the Government asks the\nCourt to limit its characterization of 1875 Act rights of\nway as “easements” to that context. Even if the right of\nway has some features of an easement—such as granting\nonly a surface interest to the railroad when the Govern­\nment wants the subsurface oil and minerals—the Gov­\nernment asks us to hold that the right of way is not an\neasement for purposes of what happens when the railroad\nstops using it. But nothing in the text of the 1875 Act\nsupports such an improbable (and self-serving) reading.\n  The Government argues that the similarity in the lan­\nguage of the 1875 Act and the pre-1871 statutes shows\nthat Congress intended to reserve a reversionary interest\nin the lands granted under the 1875 Act, just as it did in\nthe pre-1871 statutes. See Brief for United States 17–18.\nBut that is directly contrary to the very premise of this\nCourt’s decision (and the Government’s argument) in\nGreat Northern: that the 1875 Act granted a fundamen-\ntally different interest in the rights of way than did the\npredecessor statutes. 315 U. S., at 277–278; see U. S.\nGreat Northern Brief 30 (“[Great Northern’s] argument . . .\nfails because it disregards the essential differences be­\ntween the 1875 Act and its predecessors.”). Contrary to\nthe Government’s position now—but consistent with the\nGovernment’s position in 1942—Great Northern stands for\nthe proposition that the pre-1871 statutes (and this\nCourt’s decisions construing them) have little relevance to\nthe question of what interest the 1875 Act conveyed to\nrailroads.\n  The Government next contends that this Court’s deci­\nsions in Stalker v. Oregon Short Line R. Co., 225 U. S. 142\n(1912), and Great Northern R. Co. v. Steinke, 261 U. S. 119\n(1923), support its position that the United States retains\nan implied reversionary interest in 1875 Act rights of way.\nBrief for United States 28–32. According to the Govern­\nment, both Stalker and Steinke demonstrate that those\n14        MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n                     UNITED STATES                          \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nrights of way cannot be bare common law easements,\nbecause those cases concluded that patents purporting to\nconvey the land underlying a right of way were “inopera­\ntive to pass title.” Brief for United States 31 (quoting\nSteinke, supra, at 131); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–30, 33,\n40–41, 44–45. If the right of way were a mere easement,\nthe argument goes, the patent would have passed title to\nthe underlying land subject to the railroad’s right of way,\nrather than failing to pass title altogether. But that is a\nsubstantial overreading of those cases.\n   In both Stalker and Steinke, a railroad that had already\nobtained an 1875 Act right of way thereafter claimed\nadjacent land for station grounds under the Act, as it was\npermitted to do because of its right of way. A homesteader\nsubsequently filed a claim to the same land, unaware of\nthe station grounds. The question in each case was\nwhether the railroad could build on the station grounds,\nnotwithstanding a subsequent patent to the homesteader.\nThe homesteader claimed priority because the railroad’s\nstation grounds map had not been recorded in the local\nland office at the time the homesteader filed his claim.\nThis Court construed the 1875 Act to give the railroad\npriority because it had submitted its proposed map to the\nDepartment of the Interior before the homesteader filed\nhis claim. See Stalker, supra, at 148–154; Steinke, supra,\nat 125–129.\n   The dispute in each case was framed in terms of compet­\ning claims to the right to acquire and develop the same\ntract of land. The Court ruled for the railroad, but did not\npurport to define the precise nature of the interest granted\nunder the 1875 Act. Indeed, it does not appear that the\nCourt in either case considered—much less rejected—an\nargument that the railroad had obtained only an easement\nin the contested land, so that the patent could still convey\ntitle to the homesteader. In any event, to the extent that\nStalker and Steinke could be read to imply that the rail­\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S., at 271.\n   Finally, the Government relies on a number of later\nenacted statutes that it says demonstrate that Congress\nbelieved the United States had retained a reversionary\ninterest in the 1875 Act rights of way. Brief for United\nStates 34–42. But each of those statutes purported only to\ndispose of interests the United States already possessed,\nnot to create or modify any such interests in the first\nplace. First, in 1906 and 1909, Congress declared forfeited\nany right of way on which a railroad had not been con­\nstructed in the five years after the location of the road. 43\nU. S. C. §940. The United States would “resume[ ] the full\ntitle to the lands covered thereby free and discharged of\nsuch easement,” but the forfeited right of way would im­\nmediately “inure to the benefit of any owner or owners of\nland conveyed by the United States prior to such date.”\nIbid.\n   Then, in 1922, Congress provided that whenever a\nrailroad forfeited or officially abandoned its right of way,\n“all right, title, interest, and estate of the United States\nin said lands” (other than land that had been converted\nto a public highway) would immediately be transferred to\neither the municipality in which it was located, or else to\nthe person who owned the underlying land. 43 U. S. C.\n§912. Finally, as part of the National Trails System Im­\nprovements Act of 1988, Congress changed course and\nsought to retain title to abandoned or forfeited railroad\nrights of way, specifying that “any and all right, title,\ninterest, and estate of the United States” in such rights of\nway “shall remain in the United States” upon abandon­\nment or forfeiture. 16 U. S. C. §1248(c).\n   The Government argues that these statutes prove that\n16        MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n                     UNITED STATES                           \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCongress intended to retain (or at least believed it had\nretained) a reversionary interest in 1875 Act rights of way.\nOtherwise, the argument goes, these later statutes provid­\ning for the disposition of the abandoned or forfeited strips\nof land would have been meaningless. That is wrong.\nThis case turns on what kind of interest Congress granted\nto railroads in their rights of way in 1875. Cf. Leo Sheep\nCo., 440 U. S., at 681 (“The pertinent inquiry in this case\nis the intent of Congress when it granted land to the Un­\nion Pacific in 1862.”). Great Northern answered that\nquestion: an easement. The statutes the Government cites\ndo not purport to define (or redefine) the nature of the\ninterest conveyed under the 1875 Act. Nor do they shed\nlight on what kind of property interest Congress intended\nto convey to railroads in 1875. See United States v. Price,\n361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960) (“the views of a subsequent\nCongress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of\nan earlier one”).\n   In other words, these statutes do not tell us whether the\nUnited States has an interest in any particular right of\nway; they simply tell us how any interest the United\nStates might have should be disposed of. For pre-1871\nrights of way in which the United States retained an\nimplied reversionary interest, or for rights of way crossing\npublic lands, these statutes might make a difference in\nwhat happens to a forfeited or abandoned right of way.\nBut if there is no “right, title, interest, [or] estate of the\nUnited States” in the right of way, 43 U. S. C. §912, then\nthe statutes simply do not apply.\n   We cannot overlook the irony in the Government’s ar­\ngument based on Sections 912 and 940. Those provisions\nplainly evince Congress’s intent to divest the United\nStates of any title or interest it had retained to railroad\nrights of way, and to vest that interest in individuals to\nwhom the underlying land had been patented—in other\nwords, people just like the Brandts. It was not until\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

That policy shift cannot operate to create\nan interest in land that the Government had already given\naway.5\n                        *    *     *\n  More than 70 years ago, the Government argued before\nthis Court that a right of way granted under the 1875 Act\nwas a simple easement. The Court was persuaded, and so\nruled. Now the Government argues that such a right of\nway is tantamount to a limited fee with an implied rever­\nsionary interest. We decline to endorse such a stark\nchange in position, especially given “the special need for\ncertainty and predictability where land titles are con­\ncerned.” Leo Sheep Co., supra, at 687.\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Tenth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                       It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  5 The  dissent invokes the principle that “any ambiguity in land grants\n‘is to be resolved favorably to a sovereign grantor,’ ” post, at 1 (quoting\nGreat Northern R. Co. v. United States, 315 U. S. 262, 272 (1942)), but\nthe Solicitor General does not—for a very good reason. The Govern­\nment’s argument here is that it gave away more in the land grant than\nan easement, so that more should revert to it now. A principle that\nambiguous grants should be construed in favor of the sovereign hurts\nrather than helps that argument. The dissent’s quotation is indeed\nfrom Great Northern, where the principle was cited in support of the\nGovernment’s argument that its 1875 Act grant conveyed “only an\neasement, and not a fee.” Id., at 271.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Co. v. United States, 315 U. S. 262, 271\n(1942), and its conclusion that the General Railroad Right-\nof-Way Act of 1875 granted “only an easement, and not a\nfee,” to a railroad possessing a right of way. The Court\nerrs, however, in two ways. First, it does not meaningfully\ngrapple with prior cases—Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Town-\nsend, 190 U. S. 267, 271 (1903), and Rio Grande Western\nR. Co. v. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44, 47 (1915)—that ex-\npressly concluded that the United States retained a rever-\nsionary interest in railroad rights of way. To the extent\nthe Court regards Great Northern as having abrogated\nthese precedents, it places on Great Northern more weight\nthan that case will bear. Second, the Court relies on\n“basic common law principles,” ante, at 12, without recog-\nnizing that courts have long treated railroad rights of way\nas sui generis property rights not governed by the ordinary\ncommon-law regime. Because Townsend and Stringham\nlargely dictate the conclusion that the Government re-\ntained a reversionary interest when it granted the right of\nway at issue, and because any ambiguity in land grants “is\nto be resolved favorably to a sovereign grantor,” Great\nNorthern, 315 U. S., at 272, I respectfully dissent.\n2         MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n\n                     UNITED STATES                          \n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\n                               I\n  Over a century ago, this Court held that a right of way\ngranted to a railroad by a pre-1871 Act of Congress in-\ncluded “an implied condition of reverter” to the Govern-\nment if the right of way ceased to be used “for the purpose\nfor which it was granted.” Northern Pacific R. Co. v.\nTownsend, 190 U. S. 267, 271 (1903). The question in\nTownsend was whether individual homesteaders could\nacquire title by adverse possession to land granted by the\nUnited States as a railroad right of way. The Court held\nthat they could not, because “the land forming the right of\nway was not granted with the intent that it might be\nabsolutely disposed of at the volition of the company.”\nIbid. “On the contrary,” the Court held, “the grant was\nexplicitly stated to be for a designated purpose, one which\nnegated the existence of the power to voluntarily alienate\nthe right of way or any portion thereof.” Ibid. Hence the\n“implied condition of reverter in the event that the com-\npany ceased to use or retain the land for the purpose for\nwhich it was granted.” Ibid. In essence, the Court held,\n“the grant was of a limited fee,” ibid.—commonly known\nas a defeasible fee, see Restatement (First) of Property §16\n(1936)—rather than fee simple. Thus, if the railroad were\nto abandon its use of the right of way, the property would\nrevert to the United States.\n  The Court later confirmed in Rio Grande Western R. Co.\nv. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44, 47 (1915), that this rule ap-\nplies not just to pre-1871 land grants to railroads, but also\nto rights of way granted under the General Railroad\nRight-of-Way Act—the Act under which the United States\ngranted the right of way at issue in this case. That case\nstated that rights of way granted under the 1875 Act are\n“made on an implied condition of reverter in the event that\nthe company ceases to use or retain the land for the pur-\nposes for which it is granted.” Ibid. Indeed, Stringham\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

If Townsend and Stringham\nremain good law on that point, then this case should be\nresolved in the Government’s favor.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   This case therefore turns on whether, as the majority\nasserts, Great Northern “disavowed” Townsend and\nStringham as to the question whether the United States\nretained a reversionary interest in the right of way. Ante,\nat 10. Great Northern did no such thing. Nor could it\nhave, for the Court did not have occasion to consider that\nquestion.\n   In Great Northern, a railroad sought to drill for oil\nbeneath the surface of a right of way granted under the\n1875 Act. We held that the railroad had no right to drill,\nbecause the United States did not convey the underlying\noil and minerals when it granted the railroad a right of\nway. In language on which the Court relies heavily, Great\nNorthern opined that the 1875 Act granted the railroad\n“only an easement, and not a fee.” 315 U. S., at 271.\n   But that language does not logically lead to the place at\nwhich the majority ultimately arrives. All that Great\nNorthern held—all, at least, that was necessary to its\nruling—was that the right of way did not confer one par-\nticular attribute of fee title. Specifically, the Court held,\nthe right of way did not confer the right to exploit subter-\nranean resources, because the 1875 Act could not have\nmade clearer that the right of way extended only to sur-\nface lands: It provided that after the recordation of a right\nof way, “all . . . lands over which such right of way shall\npass shall be disposed of subject to such right of way.”\nIbid. (second emphasis and internal quotation marks\nomitted). But the Court did not hold that the right of way\n4         MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n\n                     UNITED STATES                          \n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nfailed to confer any sticks in the proverbial bundle of\nrights generally associated with fee title. Cf. B. Cardozo,\nThe Paradoxes of Legal Science 129 (1928) (reprint 2000);\nUnited States v. Craft, 535 U. S. 274, 278 (2002). And this\ncase concerns an attribute of fee title—defeasibility—that\nno party contends was at issue in Great Northern.\n   The majority places heavy emphasis on Great Northern’s\ncharacterization of rights of way under the 1875 Act as\n“easements,” rather than “limited fees.” When an ease-\nment is abandoned, the majority reasons, it is extin-\nguished; in effect, it reverts to the owner of the underlying\nestate, rather than to its original grantor. Ante, at 11–12.\nFor that reason, the majority concludes, “basic common\nlaw principles” require us to retreat from our prior hold-\nings that railroad rights of way entail an implied possibil-\nity of reverter to the original grantor—the United States—\nshould the right of way cease to be used by a railroad for\nits intended purpose. Ante, at 12.\n   But federal and state decisions in this area have not\nhistorically depended on “basic common law principles.”\nTo the contrary, this Court and others have long recog-\nnized that in the context of railroad rights of way, tradi-\ntional property terms like “fee” and “easement” do not\nneatly track common-law definitions. In Stringham, the\nCourt articulated ways in which rights of ways bear at-\ntributes both of easements and fees, explaining that “[t]he\nright of way granted by [the 1875 Act] and similar acts is\nneither a mere easement, nor a fee simple absolute.” 239\nU. S., at 47. In New Mexico v. United States Trust Co.,\n172 U. S. 171, 182–183 (1898), the Court further observed\nthat even if a particular right of way granted by the United\nStates was an “easement,” then it was “surely more\nthan an ordinary easement” because it had “attributes of\nthe fee” like exclusive use and possession. See also West-\nern Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 195 U. S.\n540, 569–570 (1904) (reaffirming this view). Earlier, in\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

And the Iowa Supreme Court, in a late\n19th-century opinion, observed that “[t]he easement” in\nquestion “is not that spoken of in the old law books, but is\npeculiar to the use of a railroad.” Smith v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span>\n<span class=\"page\">95</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96, 72 N. W. 427, 428 (1897).\n  Today’s opinion dispenses with these teachings. Al-\nthough the majority canvasses the special role railroads\nplayed in the development of our Nation, it concludes that\nwe are bound by the common-law definitions that apply to\nmore typical property. In doing so, it ignores the sui\ngeneris nature of railroad rights of way. That Great\nNorthern referred to a right of way granted under the\n1875 Act as an “easement” does not derail the Court’s\nprevious unequivocal pronouncements that rights of way\nunder the Act are “made on an implied condition of re-\nverter.” Stringham, 239 U. S., at 47.\n                               B\n   Not only does Great Northern fail to support the major-\nity’s conclusion; significant aspects of Great Northern’s\nreasoning actually support the contrary view. In that\ncase, the Court relied heavily on Congress’ policy shift in\nthe early 1870’s away from bestowing extravagant “ ‘sub-\nsidies in public lands to railroads and other corporations.’ ”\n315 U. S., at 273–274 (quoting Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d\nSess., 1585 (1872)). That history similarly weighs in the\nGovernment’s favor here. Just as the post-1871 Congress\ndid not likely mean to confer subsurface mineral rights on\nrailroads, as held in Great Northern, it did not likely mean\nto grant railroads an indefeasible property interest in\nrights of way—a kind of interest more generous than that\n6         MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n\n                     UNITED STATES                            \n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nwhich it gave in our cases concerning pre-1871 grants.\n   As in Great Northern, moreover, the purpose of the 1875\nAct supports the Government. Congress passed the Act,\nwe noted, “to permit the construction of railroads through\npublic lands” and thus to “enhance their value and hasten\ntheir settlement.” 315 U. S., at 272. In Great Northern,\nwe held, that purpose did not require granting to the\nrailroad any right to that which lay beneath the surface.\nThe same is true here. As we recognized in Townsend and\nStringham, the United States granted rights of way to\nrailroads subject to “an implied condition of reverter in the\nevent that the” railroads “cease[d] to use or retain the land\nfor the purposes for which it is granted.” Stringham, 239\nU. S., at 47. Nothing about the purpose of the 1875 Act\nsuggests Congress ever meant to abandon that sensible\nlimitation.\n   Further, Great Northern relied on the conventional rule\nthat “a grant is to be resolved favorably to a sovereign\ngrantor,” 315 U. S., at 272, and that “ ‘nothing passes but\nwhat is conveyed in clear and explicit language,’ ” ibid.\n(quoting Caldwell v. United States, 250 U. S. 14, 20\n(1919)). “Nothing in the [1875] Act,” we observed, “may be\ncharacterized as a ‘clear and explicit’ conveyance of the . . .\noil and minerals” underlying a right of way. 315 U. S.,\nat 272. Just so here, as nothing in the 1875 Act clearly\nevinces Congress’ intent not to make the rights of way\nconveyed under the Act defeasible, in the manner de-\nscribed by Townsend and Stringham. In fact, the pre-\nsumption in favor of sovereign grantors applies doubly\nhere, where the United States was the sovereign grantor\nboth of the right of way and of the ultimate patent.\n                           III\n  The majority notes that in Great Northern, the United\nStates took the position that rights of way granted to\nrailroads are easements.

Ante, at 9.\n   Even assuming that it is an injustice for the Govern-\nment to change positions on an issue over a 70-year period,\nit is not clear that such a change in position happened\nhere. Yes, the Government argued in Great Northern that\na right of way was an “easement.” It proposed, however,\nthat the right of way may well have had “some of the\nattributes of a fee.” Brief for United States in Great\nNorthern R. Co. v. United States, O. T. 1941, No. 149,\npp. 36–37. The Government contended that it is “ ‘not\nimportant whether the interest or estate passed be consid-\nered an easement or a limited fee,’ ” observing that an\neasement “may be held in fee determinable.” Id., at 35–36\n(quoting United States v. Big Horn Land & Cattle Co., 17\nF. 2d 357, 365 (CA8 1927)). Indeed, the Government\nexpressly reserved the possibility that it retained a rever-\nsionary interest in the right of way, even if the surround-\ning land was patented to others. Brief for United States in\nGreat Northern, at 10 n. 4. The Court is right to criticize\nthe Government when it takes “self-serving” and contra-\ndictory positions, ante, at 12, but such critique is mis-\nplaced here.\n                        *    *     *\n  Since 1903, this Court has held that rights of way were\ngranted to railroads with an implied possibility of reverter\nto the United States.

Argued January 14, 2014—Decided March 10, 2014\nCongress passed the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875 to pro-\n  vide railroad companies “right[s] of way through the public lands of\n  the United States,” 43 U. S. C. §934. One such right of way, obtained\n  by a railroad in 1908, crosses land that the United States conveyed to\n  the Brandt family in a 1976 land patent. That patent stated, as rele-\n  vant here, that the land was granted subject to the railroad’s rights\n  in the 1875 Act right of way, but it did not specify what would occur if\n  the railroad later relinquished those rights. Years later, a successor\n  railroad abandoned the right of way with federal approval. The Gov-\n  ernment then sought a judicial declaration of abandonment and an\n  order quieting title in the United States to the abandoned right of\n  way, including the stretch that crossed the land conveyed in the\n  Brandt patent. Petitioners contested the claim, asserting that the\n  right of way was a mere easement that was extinguished when the\n  railroad abandoned it, so that Brandt now enjoys full title to his land\n  without the burden of the easement. The Government countered that\n  the 1875 Act granted the railroad something more than a mere ease-\n  ment, and that the United States retained a reversionary interest in\n  that land once the railroad abandoned it. The District Court granted\n  summary judgment to the Government and quieted title in the Unit-\n  ed States to the right of way. The Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The right of way was an easement that was terminated by the\n railroad’s abandonment, leaving Brandt’s land unburdened. Pp. 8–\n 17.\n    (a) The Government loses this case in large part because it won\n when it argued the opposite in Great Northern R. Co. v. United\n States, 315 U. S. 262. There, the Government contended that the\n2             MARVIN M.

This Court adopted the Government’s position in full.\n    It found the 1875 Act’s text “wholly inconsistent” with the grant of a\n    fee interest, id., at 271; agreed with the Government that cases de-\n    scribing the nature of rights of way granted prior to 1871 were “not\n    controlling” because of a major shift in congressional policy concern-\n    ing land grants to railroads after that year, id., at 278; and held that\n    the 1875 Act “clearly grants only an easement,” id., at 271. Under\n    well-established common law property principles, an easement dis-\n    appears when abandoned by its beneficiary, leaving the owner of the\n    underlying land to resume a full and unencumbered interest in the\n    land. See Smith v. Townsend, 148 U. S. 490, 499. Pp. 8–12.\n       (b) The Government asks this Court to limit Great Northern’s char-\n    acterization of 1875 Act rights of way as easements to the question of\n    who owns the oil and minerals beneath a right of way. But nothing\n    in the 1875 Act’s text supports that reading, and the Government’s\n    reliance on the similarity of the language in the 1875 Act and pre-\n    1871 statutes directly contravenes the very premise of Great North-\n    ern: that the 1875 Act granted a fundamentally different interest\n    than did its predecessor statutes. Nor do this Court’s decisions in\n    Stalker v. Oregon Short Line R. Co., 225 U. S. 142, and Great North-\n    ern R. Co. v. Steinke, 261 U. S. 119, support the Government’s posi-\n    tion. The dispute in each of those cases was framed in terms of com-\n    peting claims to acquire and develop a particular tract of land, and it\n    does not appear that the Court considered—much less rejected—an\n    argument that the railroad had only an easement in the contested\n    land. But to the extent that those cases could be read to imply that\n    the interest was something more, any such implication would not\n    have survived this Court’s unequivocal statement to the contrary in\n    Great Northern. Finally, later enacted statutes, see 43 U. S. C.\n    §§912, 940; 16 U. S. C. §1248(c), do not define or shed light on the na-\n    ture of the interest Congress granted to railroads in their rights of\n    way in 1875. They instead purport only to dispose of interests (if\n    any) the United States already possesses. Pp. 12–17.\n496 Fed. Appx. 822, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

The settlers and their successors remained, but\nmany of the railroads did not. This case presents the\nquestion of what happens to a railroad’s right of way\ngranted under a particular statute—the General Railroad\nRight-of-Way Act of 1875—when the railroad abandons it:\ndoes it go to the Government, or to the private party who\nacquired the land underlying the right of way?\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  In the early to mid-19th century, America looked west.\nThe period from the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 to the\nGadsden Purchase in 1853 saw the acquisition of the\nwestern lands that filled out what is now the contiguous\n2         MARVIN M.

New technol­\nogy provided the answer: the railroad. The Civil War\nspurred the effort to develop a transcontinental railroad,\nas the Federal Government saw the need to protect its\ncitizens and secure its possessions in the West. Leo Sheep\nCo. v. United States, 440 U. S. 668, 674–676 (1979). The\nconstruction of such a railroad would “furnish a cheap and\nexpeditious mode for the transportation of troops and\nsupplies,” help develop “the agricultural and mineral\nresources of this territory,” and foster settlement. United\nStates v. Union Pacific R. Co., 91 U. S. 72, 80 (1875).\n   The substantial benefits a transcontinental railroad\ncould bring were clear, but building it was no simple\nmatter. The risks were great and the costs were stagger­\ning. Popular sentiment grew for the Government to play a\nrole in supporting the massive project. Indeed, in 1860,\nPresident Lincoln’s winning platform proclaimed: “That a\nrailroad to the Pacific Ocean is imperatively demanded by\nthe interests of the whole country; that the Federal Gov­\nernment ought to render immediate and efficient aid in its\nconstruction.” J. Ely, Railroads and American Law 51\n(2001). But how to do it? Sufficient funds were not at\nhand (especially with a Civil War to fight), and there were\nserious reservations about the legal authority for direct\nfinancing. “The policy of the country, to say nothing of the\nsupposed want of constitutional power, stood in the way of\nthe United States taking the work into its own hands.”\nUnion Pacific R. Co., supra, at 81.\n   What the country did have, however, was land—lots of\nit. It could give away vast swaths of public land—which at\nthe time possessed little value without reliable transporta­\ntion—in hopes that such grants would increase the appeal\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

In the early 1860s, Congress began\ngranting to railroad companies rights of way through the\npublic domain, accompanied by outright grants of land\nalong those rights of way. P. Gates, History of Public Land\nLaw Development 362–368 (1968). The land was con-\nveyed in checkerboard blocks. For example, under the\nUnion Pacific Act of 1862, odd-numbered lots of one square\nmile apiece were granted to the railroad, while even­\nnumbered lots were retained by the United States. Leo\nSheep Co., supra, at 672–673, 686, n. 23. Railroads could\nthen either develop their lots or sell them, to finance\nconstruction of rail lines and encourage the settlement of\nfuture customers. Indeed, railroads became the largest\nsecondary dispenser of public lands, after the States.\nGates, supra, at 379.\n  But public resentment against such generous land\ngrants to railroads began to grow in the late 1860s. West­\nern settlers, initially some of the staunchest supporters of\ngovernmental railroad subsidization, complained that the\nrailroads moved too slowly in placing their lands on the\nmarket and into the hands of farmers and settlers. Citi­\nzens and Members of Congress argued that the grants\nconflicted with the goal of the Homestead Act of 1862 to\nencourage individual citizens to settle and develop the\nfrontier lands. By the 1870s, legislators across the politi­\ncal spectrum had embraced a policy of reserving public\nlands for settlers rather than granting them to railroads.\nId., at 380, 454–456.\n  A House resolution adopted in 1872 summed up the\nchange in national policy, stating:\n    “That in the judgment of this House the policy of\n    granting subsidies in public lands to railroads and\n    other corporations ought to be discontinued, and that\n    every consideration of public policy and equal justice\n4        MARVIN M.

Globe, 42d Cong., 2d\n    Sess., 1585.\nCongress enacted the last checkerboard land-grant statute\nfor railroads in 1871. Gates, supra, at 380. Still wishing\nto encourage railroad construction, however, Congress\npassed at least 15 special acts between 1871 and 1875\ngranting to designated railroads “the right of way”\nthrough public lands, without any accompanying land\nsubsidy. Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 315 U. S.\n262, 274, and n. 9 (1942).\n   Rather than continue to enact special legislation for\neach such right of way, Congress passed the General\nRailroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 482, 43\nU. S. C. §§934–939. The 1875 Act provided that “[t]he\nright of way through the public lands of the United States\nis granted to any railroad company” meeting certain re­\nquirements, “to the extent of one hundred feet on each side\nof the central line of said road.” §934. A railroad company\ncould obtain a right of way by the “actual construction of\nits road” or “in advance of construction by filing a map as\nprovided in section four” of the Act. Jamestown & North-\nern R. Co. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 125, 130–131 (1900). Section\n4 in turn provided that a company could “secure” its right\nof way by filing a proposed map of its rail corridor with a\nlocal Department of the Interior office within 12 months\nafter survey or location of the road. §937. Upon approval\nby the Interior Department, the right of way would be\nnoted on the land plats held at the local office, and from\nthat day forward “all such lands over which such right of\nway shall pass shall be disposed of subject to the right\nof way.” Ibid.\n   The 1875 Act remained in effect until 1976, when its\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Brandt began working at a sawmill in Fox\nPark, Wyoming, in 1939. He later purchased the sawmill\nand, in 1946, moved his family to Fox Park. Melvin’s son\nMarvin started working at the sawmill in 1958 and came\nto own and operate it in 1976 until it closed, 15 years\nlater.\n    In 1976, the United States patented an 83-acre parcel of\nland in Fox Park, surrounded by the Medicine Bow-Routt\nNational Forest, to Melvin and Lulu Brandt. (A land\npatent is an official document reflecting a grant by a\nsovereign that is made public, or “patent.”) The patent\nconveyed to the Brandts fee simple title to the land “with\nall the rights, privileges, immunities, and appurtenances,\nof whatsoever nature, thereunto belonging, unto said\nclaimants, their successors and assigns, forever.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 76. But the patent did include limited excep­\ntions and reservations. For example, the patent “except[s]\nand reserv[es] to the United States from the land granted\na right-of-way thereon for ditches or canals constructed\nby the authority of the United States”; “reserv[es] to the\nUnited States . . . a right-of-way for the existing Platte\nAccess Road No. 512”; and “reserv[es] to the United States\n. . . a right-of-way for the existing Dry Park Road No. 517.”\nId., at 76–77 (capitalization omitted).

The\npatent did not specify what would occur if the railroad\nabandoned this right of way.\n  The right of way referred to in the patent was obtained\nby the Laramie, Hahn’s Peak and Pacific Railroad\n(LHP&P) in 1908, pursuant to the 1875 Act.1 The right of\nway is 66 miles long and 200 feet wide, and it meanders\nsouth from Laramie, Wyoming, through the Medicine\nBow-Routt National Forest, to the Wyoming-Colorado\nborder. Nearly a half-mile stretch of the right of way\ncrosses Brandt’s land in Fox Park, covering ten acres of\nthat parcel.\n  In 1911, the LHP&P completed construction of its rail­\nway over the right of way, from Laramie to Coalmont,\nColorado. Its proprietors had rosy expectations, proclaim­\ning that it would become “one of the most important rail­\nroad systems in this country.” Laramie, Hahns Peak and\nPacific Railway System: The Direct Gateway to Southern\nWyoming, Northern Colorado, and Eastern Utah 24\n(1910). But the railroad ultimately fell short of that goal.\nRather than shipping coal and other valuable ores as\noriginally hoped, the LHP&P was used primarily to\ntransport timber and cattle. R.

King,\nsupra, at 90. That did not prove profitable either, and in\n1996 the Wyoming and Colorado notified the Surface\nTransportation Board of its intent to abandon the right of\nway. The railroad tore up the tracks and ties and, after\nreceiving Board approval, completed abandonment in\n2004. In 2006 the United States initiated this action\nseeking a judicial declaration of abandonment and an\norder quieting title in the United States to the abandoned\nright of way. In addition to the railroad, the Government\nnamed as defendants the owners of 31 parcels of land\ncrossed by the abandoned right of way.\n   The Government settled with or obtained a default\njudgment against all but one of those landowners—Marvin\nBrandt. He contested the Government’s claim and filed a\ncounterclaim on behalf of a family trust that now owns the\nFox Park parcel, and himself as trustee.2 Brandt asserted\nthat the stretch of the right of way crossing his family’s\nland was a mere easement that was extinguished upon\nabandonment by the railroad, so that, under common law\nproperty rules, he enjoyed full title to the land without the\nburden of the easement. The Government countered that\nit had all along retained a reversionary interest in the\nrailroad right of way—that is, a future estate that would\nbe restored to the United States if the railroad abandoned\n——————\n  2 The other landowners had a potential interest in much smaller\n\nacreages: No other party could claim an interest in more than three\nacres of the right of way, and only six of the 31 potential claims\namounted to more than one acre.

The court acknowledged division among\nlower courts regarding the nature of the Government’s\ninterest (if any) in abandoned 1875 Act rights of way.

Brandt contends that the right of way\ngranted under the 1875 Act was an easement, so that\nwhen the railroad abandoned it, the underlying land\n(Brandt’s Fox Park parcel) simply became unburdened of\nthe easement. The Government does not dispute that\neasements normally work this way, but maintains that the\n1875 Act granted the railroads something more than an\neasement, reserving an implied reversionary interest in\nthat something more to the United States. The Govern­\nment loses that argument today, in large part because it\nwon when it argued the opposite before this Court more\nthan 70 years ago, in the case of Great Northern Railway\nCo. v. United States, 315 U. S. 262 (1942).\n  In 1907, Great Northern succeeded to an 1875 Act right\n——————\n    3 TheDistrict Court dismissed without prejudice Brandt’s separate\ncounterclaim for just compensation.

Oil was later discovered in the area, and Great\nNorthern wanted to drill beneath its right of way. But\nthe Government sued to enjoin the railroad from doing\nso, claiming that the railroad had only an easement, so\nthat the United States retained all interests beneath the\nsurface.\n  This Court had indeed previously held that the pre-1871\nstatutes, granting rights of way accompanied by checker­\nboard land subsidies, conveyed to the railroads “a limited\nfee, made on an implied condition of reverter.” See, e.g.,\nNorthern Pacific R. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267, 271\n(1903). Great Northern relied on those cases to contend\nthat it owned a “fee” interest in the right of way, which\nincluded the right to drill for minerals beneath the\nsurface.\n  The Government disagreed. It argued that “the 1875\nAct granted an easement and nothing more,” and that the\nrailroad accordingly could claim no interest in the re­\nsources beneath the surface. Brief for United States in\nGreat Northern R. Co. v. United States, O. T. 1941, No.\n149, p. 29. “The year 1871 marks the end of one era and\nthe beginning of a new in American land-grant history,”\nthe Government contended; thus, cases construing the\npre-1871 statutes were inapplicable in construing the 1875\nAct, id., at 15, 29–30. Instead, the Government argued,\nthe text, background, and subsequent administrative and\ncongressional construction of the 1875 Act all made clear\nthat, unlike rights of way granted under pre-1871 land­\ngrant statutes, those granted under the 1875 Act were\nmere easements.\n  The Court adopted the United States’ position in full,\nholding that the 1875 Act “clearly grants only an ease­\nment, and not a fee.” Great Northern, 315 U. S., at 271.\nThe Court found Section 4 of the Act “especially persua­\nsive,” because it provided that “all such lands over which\n10        MARVIN M.

Calling this language “wholly\ninconsistent” with the grant of a fee interest, the Court\nendorsed the lower court’s statement that “[a]pter words\nto indicate the intent to convey an easement would be\ndifficult to find.” Ibid.\n   That interpretation was confirmed, the Court explained,\nby the historical background against which the 1875 Act\nwas passed and by subsequent administrative and con­\ngressional interpretation. The Court accepted the Gov­\nernment’s position that prior cases describing the nature\nof pre-1871 rights of way—including Townsend, supra, at\n271—were “not controlling,” because of the shift in con­\ngressional policy after that year. Great Northern, supra,\nat 277–278, and n. 18. The Court also specifically disa­\nvowed the characterization of an 1875 Act right of way in\nRio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44\n(1915), as “ ‘a limited fee, made on an implied condition of\nreverter.’ ” Great Northern, supra, at 278–279 (quoting\nStringham, supra, at 47). The Court noted that in String-\nham “it does not appear that Congress’ change of policy\nafter 1871 was brought to the Court’s attention,” given\nthat “[n]o brief was filed by the defendant or the United\nStates” in that case. Great Northern, supra, at 279, and\nn. 20.\n   The dissent is wrong to conclude that Great Northern\nmerely held that “the right of way did not confer one\nparticular attribute of fee title.” Post, at 3 (opinion\nof SOTOMAYOR, J.). To the contrary, the Court specifically\nrejected the notion that the right of way conferred even a\n“limited fee.” 315 U. S., at 279; see also id., at 277–278\n(declining to follow cases describing a right of way as a\n“limited,” “base,” or “qualified” fee). Instead, the Court\nconcluded, it was “clear from the language of the Act, its\nlegislative history, its early administrative interpretation\nand the construction placed upon it by Congress in subse­\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Union Pacific R.\nCo., 353 U. S. 112, 119 (1957) (noting the conclusion in\nGreat Northern that, in the period after 1871, “only an\neasement for railroad purposes was granted”); 353 U. S.,\nat 128 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (observing that the\nCourt “conclude[d] in the Great Northern case that a right\nof way granted by the 1875 Act was an easement and not a\nlimited fee”).\n   When the United States patented the Fox Park parcel to\nBrandt’s parents in 1976, it conveyed fee simple title to\nthat land, “subject to those rights for railroad purposes”\nthat had been granted to the LHP&P. The United States\ndid not reserve to itself any interest in the right of way in\nthat patent. Under Great Northern, the railroad thus had\nan easement in its right of way over land owned by the\nBrandts.\n   The essential features of easements—including, most\nimportant here, what happens when they cease to be\nused—are well settled as a matter of property law. An\neasement is a “nonpossessory right to enter and use land\nin the possession of another and obligates the possessor\nnot to interfere with the uses authorized by the easement.”\nRestatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes §1.2(1)\n(1998). “Unlike most possessory estates, easements . . .\nmay be unilaterally terminated by abandonment, leaving\nthe servient owner with a possessory estate unencum­\nbered by the servitude.” Id., §1.2, Comment d; id., §7.4,\nComments a, f. In other words, if the beneficiary of the\neasement abandons it, the easement disappears, and the\nlandowner resumes his full and unencumbered interest in\nthe land. See Smith v. Townsend, 148 U. S. 490, 499\n(1893) (“[W]hoever obtained title from the government to\nany . . . land through which ran this right of way would\nacquire a fee to the whole tract subject to the easement of\n12          MARVIN M.

Atty. Gen. 250, 254\n(1879) (“the purchasers or grantees of the United States\ntook the fee of the lands patented to them subject to the\neasement created by the act of 1824; but on a discontinu­\nance or abandonment of that right of way the entire and\nexclusive property, and right of enjoyment thereto, vested\nin the proprietors of the soil”).4\n  Those basic common law principles resolve this case.\nWhen the Wyoming and Colorado Railroad abandoned the\nright of way in 2004, the easement referred to in the\nBrandt patent terminated. Brandt’s land became unbur­\ndened of the easement, conferring on him the same full\nrights over the right of way as he enjoyed over the rest of\nthe Fox Park parcel.\n                           III\n  Contrary to that straightforward conclusion, the Gov­\nernment now tells us that Great Northern did not really\nmean what it said. Emphasizing that Great Northern\ninvolved only the question of who owned the oil and min-\n\n——————\n   4 Because granting an easement merely gives the grantee the right to\n\nenter and use the grantor’s land for a certain purpose, but does not give\nthe grantee any possessory interest in the land, it does not make sense\nunder common law property principles to speak of the grantor of an\neasement having retained a “reversionary interest.” A reversionary\ninterest is “any future interest left in a transferor or his successor in\ninterest.” Restatement (First) of Property §154(1)(1936). It arises\nwhen the grantor “transfers less than his entire interest” in a piece of\nland, and it is either certain or possible that he will retake the trans­\nferred interest at a future date. Id., Comment a. Because the grantor\nof an easement has not transferred his estate or possessory interest, he\nhas not retained a reversionary interest. He retains all his ownership\ninterest, subject to an easement. See Preseault v. United States, 100\nF. 3d 1525, 1533–1534 (CA Fed. 1996) (en banc).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nerals beneath a right of way, the Government asks the\nCourt to limit its characterization of 1875 Act rights of\nway as “easements” to that context. Even if the right of\nway has some features of an easement—such as granting\nonly a surface interest to the railroad when the Govern­\nment wants the subsurface oil and minerals—the Gov­\nernment asks us to hold that the right of way is not an\neasement for purposes of what happens when the railroad\nstops using it. But nothing in the text of the 1875 Act\nsupports such an improbable (and self-serving) reading.\n  The Government argues that the similarity in the lan­\nguage of the 1875 Act and the pre-1871 statutes shows\nthat Congress intended to reserve a reversionary interest\nin the lands granted under the 1875 Act, just as it did in\nthe pre-1871 statutes. See Brief for United States 17–18.\nBut that is directly contrary to the very premise of this\nCourt’s decision (and the Government’s argument) in\nGreat Northern: that the 1875 Act granted a fundamen-\ntally different interest in the rights of way than did the\npredecessor statutes. 315 U. S., at 277–278; see U. S.\nGreat Northern Brief 30 (“[Great Northern’s] argument . . .\nfails because it disregards the essential differences be­\ntween the 1875 Act and its predecessors.”). Contrary to\nthe Government’s position now—but consistent with the\nGovernment’s position in 1942—Great Northern stands for\nthe proposition that the pre-1871 statutes (and this\nCourt’s decisions construing them) have little relevance to\nthe question of what interest the 1875 Act conveyed to\nrailroads.\n  The Government next contends that this Court’s deci­\nsions in Stalker v. Oregon Short Line R. Co., 225 U. S. 142\n(1912), and Great Northern R. Co. v. Steinke, 261 U. S. 119\n(1923), support its position that the United States retains\nan implied reversionary interest in 1875 Act rights of way.\nBrief for United States 28–32. According to the Govern­\nment, both Stalker and Steinke demonstrate that those\n14        MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n                     UNITED STATES                          \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nrights of way cannot be bare common law easements,\nbecause those cases concluded that patents purporting to\nconvey the land underlying a right of way were “inopera­\ntive to pass title.” Brief for United States 31 (quoting\nSteinke, supra, at 131); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–30, 33,\n40–41, 44–45. If the right of way were a mere easement,\nthe argument goes, the patent would have passed title to\nthe underlying land subject to the railroad’s right of way,\nrather than failing to pass title altogether. But that is a\nsubstantial overreading of those cases.\n   In both Stalker and Steinke, a railroad that had already\nobtained an 1875 Act right of way thereafter claimed\nadjacent land for station grounds under the Act, as it was\npermitted to do because of its right of way. A homesteader\nsubsequently filed a claim to the same land, unaware of\nthe station grounds. The question in each case was\nwhether the railroad could build on the station grounds,\nnotwithstanding a subsequent patent to the homesteader.\nThe homesteader claimed priority because the railroad’s\nstation grounds map had not been recorded in the local\nland office at the time the homesteader filed his claim.\nThis Court construed the 1875 Act to give the railroad\npriority because it had submitted its proposed map to the\nDepartment of the Interior before the homesteader filed\nhis claim. See Stalker, supra, at 148–154; Steinke, supra,\nat 125–129.\n   The dispute in each case was framed in terms of compet­\ning claims to the right to acquire and develop the same\ntract of land. The Court ruled for the railroad, but did not\npurport to define the precise nature of the interest granted\nunder the 1875 Act. Indeed, it does not appear that the\nCourt in either case considered—much less rejected—an\nargument that the railroad had obtained only an easement\nin the contested land, so that the patent could still convey\ntitle to the homesteader. In any event, to the extent that\nStalker and Steinke could be read to imply that the rail­\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S., at 271.\n   Finally, the Government relies on a number of later\nenacted statutes that it says demonstrate that Congress\nbelieved the United States had retained a reversionary\ninterest in the 1875 Act rights of way. Brief for United\nStates 34–42. But each of those statutes purported only to\ndispose of interests the United States already possessed,\nnot to create or modify any such interests in the first\nplace. First, in 1906 and 1909, Congress declared forfeited\nany right of way on which a railroad had not been con­\nstructed in the five years after the location of the road. 43\nU. S. C. §940. The United States would “resume[ ] the full\ntitle to the lands covered thereby free and discharged of\nsuch easement,” but the forfeited right of way would im­\nmediately “inure to the benefit of any owner or owners of\nland conveyed by the United States prior to such date.”\nIbid.\n   Then, in 1922, Congress provided that whenever a\nrailroad forfeited or officially abandoned its right of way,\n“all right, title, interest, and estate of the United States\nin said lands” (other than land that had been converted\nto a public highway) would immediately be transferred to\neither the municipality in which it was located, or else to\nthe person who owned the underlying land. 43 U. S. C.\n§912. Finally, as part of the National Trails System Im­\nprovements Act of 1988, Congress changed course and\nsought to retain title to abandoned or forfeited railroad\nrights of way, specifying that “any and all right, title,\ninterest, and estate of the United States” in such rights of\nway “shall remain in the United States” upon abandon­\nment or forfeiture. 16 U. S. C. §1248(c).\n   The Government argues that these statutes prove that\n16        MARVIN M.

That is wrong.\nThis case turns on what kind of interest Congress granted\nto railroads in their rights of way in 1875. Cf. Leo Sheep\nCo., 440 U. S., at 681 (“The pertinent inquiry in this case\nis the intent of Congress when it granted land to the Un­\nion Pacific in 1862.”). Great Northern answered that\nquestion: an easement. The statutes the Government cites\ndo not purport to define (or redefine) the nature of the\ninterest conveyed under the 1875 Act. Nor do they shed\nlight on what kind of property interest Congress intended\nto convey to railroads in 1875. See United States v. Price,\n361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960) (“the views of a subsequent\nCongress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of\nan earlier one”).\n   In other words, these statutes do not tell us whether the\nUnited States has an interest in any particular right of\nway; they simply tell us how any interest the United\nStates might have should be disposed of. For pre-1871\nrights of way in which the United States retained an\nimplied reversionary interest, or for rights of way crossing\npublic lands, these statutes might make a difference in\nwhat happens to a forfeited or abandoned right of way.\nBut if there is no “right, title, interest, [or] estate of the\nUnited States” in the right of way, 43 U. S. C. §912, then\nthe statutes simply do not apply.\n   We cannot overlook the irony in the Government’s ar­\ngument based on Sections 912 and 940. Those provisions\nplainly evince Congress’s intent to divest the United\nStates of any title or interest it had retained to railroad\nrights of way, and to vest that interest in individuals to\nwhom the underlying land had been patented—in other\nwords, people just like the Brandts. It was not until\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

The Govern­\nment’s argument here is that it gave away more in the land grant than\nan easement, so that more should revert to it now. A principle that\nambiguous grants should be construed in favor of the sovereign hurts\nrather than helps that argument. The dissent’s quotation is indeed\nfrom Great Northern, where the principle was cited in support of the\nGovernment’s argument that its 1875 Act grant conveyed “only an\neasement, and not a fee.” Id., at 271.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST, ET AL. \n\n       PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                       [March 10, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, dissenting.\n  The Court bases today’s holding almost entirely on\nGreat Northern R. Co. v. United States, 315 U. S. 262, 271\n(1942), and its conclusion that the General Railroad Right-\nof-Way Act of 1875 granted “only an easement, and not a\nfee,” to a railroad possessing a right of way. The Court\nerrs, however, in two ways. First, it does not meaningfully\ngrapple with prior cases—Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Town-\nsend, 190 U. S. 267, 271 (1903), and Rio Grande Western\nR. Co. v. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44, 47 (1915)—that ex-\npressly concluded that the United States retained a rever-\nsionary interest in railroad rights of way. To the extent\nthe Court regards Great Northern as having abrogated\nthese precedents, it places on Great Northern more weight\nthan that case will bear. Second, the Court relies on\n“basic common law principles,” ante, at 12, without recog-\nnizing that courts have long treated railroad rights of way\nas sui generis property rights not governed by the ordinary\ncommon-law regime. Because Townsend and Stringham\nlargely dictate the conclusion that the Government re-\ntained a reversionary interest when it granted the right of\nway at issue, and because any ambiguity in land grants “is\nto be resolved favorably to a sovereign grantor,” Great\nNorthern, 315 U. S., at 272, I respectfully dissent.\n2         MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n\n                     UNITED STATES                          \n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\n                               I\n  Over a century ago, this Court held that a right of way\ngranted to a railroad by a pre-1871 Act of Congress in-\ncluded “an implied condition of reverter” to the Govern-\nment if the right of way ceased to be used “for the purpose\nfor which it was granted.” Northern Pacific R. Co. v.\nTownsend, 190 U. S. 267, 271 (1903). The question in\nTownsend was whether individual homesteaders could\nacquire title by adverse possession to land granted by the\nUnited States as a railroad right of way. The Court held\nthat they could not, because “the land forming the right of\nway was not granted with the intent that it might be\nabsolutely disposed of at the volition of the company.”\nIbid. “On the contrary,” the Court held, “the grant was\nexplicitly stated to be for a designated purpose, one which\nnegated the existence of the power to voluntarily alienate\nthe right of way or any portion thereof.” Ibid. Hence the\n“implied condition of reverter in the event that the com-\npany ceased to use or retain the land for the purpose for\nwhich it was granted.” Ibid. In essence, the Court held,\n“the grant was of a limited fee,” ibid.—commonly known\nas a defeasible fee, see Restatement (First) of Property §16\n(1936)—rather than fee simple. Thus, if the railroad were\nto abandon its use of the right of way, the property would\nrevert to the United States.\n  The Court later confirmed in Rio Grande Western R. Co.\nv. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44, 47 (1915), that this rule ap-\nplies not just to pre-1871 land grants to railroads, but also\nto rights of way granted under the General Railroad\nRight-of-Way Act—the Act under which the United States\ngranted the right of way at issue in this case. That case\nstated that rights of way granted under the 1875 Act are\n“made on an implied condition of reverter in the event that\nthe company ceases to use or retain the land for the pur-\nposes for which it is granted.” Ibid. Indeed, Stringham\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsustained the validity of the reverter where, as here, the\nUnited States patented the adjacent land “subject to [the]\nright of way.” Id., at 46. If Townsend and Stringham\nremain good law on that point, then this case should be\nresolved in the Government’s favor.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   This case therefore turns on whether, as the majority\nasserts, Great Northern “disavowed” Townsend and\nStringham as to the question whether the United States\nretained a reversionary interest in the right of way. Ante,\nat 10. Great Northern did no such thing. Nor could it\nhave, for the Court did not have occasion to consider that\nquestion.\n   In Great Northern, a railroad sought to drill for oil\nbeneath the surface of a right of way granted under the\n1875 Act. We held that the railroad had no right to drill,\nbecause the United States did not convey the underlying\noil and minerals when it granted the railroad a right of\nway. In language on which the Court relies heavily, Great\nNorthern opined that the 1875 Act granted the railroad\n“only an easement, and not a fee.” 315 U. S., at 271.\n   But that language does not logically lead to the place at\nwhich the majority ultimately arrives. All that Great\nNorthern held—all, at least, that was necessary to its\nruling—was that the right of way did not confer one par-\nticular attribute of fee title. Specifically, the Court held,\nthe right of way did not confer the right to exploit subter-\nranean resources, because the 1875 Act could not have\nmade clearer that the right of way extended only to sur-\nface lands: It provided that after the recordation of a right\nof way, “all . . . lands over which such right of way shall\npass shall be disposed of subject to such right of way.”\nIbid. (second emphasis and internal quotation marks\nomitted). But the Court did not hold that the right of way\n4         MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n\n                     UNITED STATES                          \n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nfailed to confer any sticks in the proverbial bundle of\nrights generally associated with fee title. Cf. B. Cardozo,\nThe Paradoxes of Legal Science 129 (1928) (reprint 2000);\nUnited States v. Craft, 535 U. S. 274, 278 (2002). And this\ncase concerns an attribute of fee title—defeasibility—that\nno party contends was at issue in Great Northern.\n   The majority places heavy emphasis on Great Northern’s\ncharacterization of rights of way under the 1875 Act as\n“easements,” rather than “limited fees.” When an ease-\nment is abandoned, the majority reasons, it is extin-\nguished; in effect, it reverts to the owner of the underlying\nestate, rather than to its original grantor. Ante, at 11–12.\nFor that reason, the majority concludes, “basic common\nlaw principles” require us to retreat from our prior hold-\nings that railroad rights of way entail an implied possibil-\nity of reverter to the original grantor—the United States—\nshould the right of way cease to be used by a railroad for\nits intended purpose. Ante, at 12.\n   But federal and state decisions in this area have not\nhistorically depended on “basic common law principles.”\nTo the contrary, this Court and others have long recog-\nnized that in the context of railroad rights of way, tradi-\ntional property terms like “fee” and “easement” do not\nneatly track common-law definitions. In Stringham, the\nCourt articulated ways in which rights of ways bear at-\ntributes both of easements and fees, explaining that “[t]he\nright of way granted by [the 1875 Act] and similar acts is\nneither a mere easement, nor a fee simple absolute.” 239\nU. S., at 47. In New Mexico v. United States Trust Co.,\n172 U. S. 171, 182–183 (1898), the Court further observed\nthat even if a particular right of way granted by the United\nStates was an “easement,” then it was “surely more\nthan an ordinary easement” because it had “attributes of\nthe fee” like exclusive use and possession. See also West-\nern Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 195 U. S.\n540, 569–570 (1904) (reaffirming this view). Earlier, in\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n1854, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court had\nexplained that although the right acquired by a railroad\nwas “technically an easement,” it “require[d] for its enjoy-\nment a use of the land permanent in its nature and practi-\ncally exclusive.” Hazen v. Boston and Me. R. Co., 68 Mass.\n574, 580 (1854). And the Iowa Supreme Court, in a late\n19th-century opinion, observed that “[t]he easement” in\nquestion “is not that spoken of in the old law books, but is\npeculiar to the use of a railroad.” Smith v. Hall, 103 Iowa\n95, 96, 72 N. W. 427, 428 (1897).\n  Today’s opinion dispenses with these teachings. Al-\nthough the majority canvasses the special role railroads\nplayed in the development of our Nation, it concludes that\nwe are bound by the common-law definitions that apply to\nmore typical property. In doing so, it ignores the sui\ngeneris nature of railroad rights of way. That Great\nNorthern referred to a right of way granted under the\n1875 Act as an “easement” does not derail the Court’s\nprevious unequivocal pronouncements that rights of way\nunder the Act are “made on an implied condition of re-\nverter.” Stringham, 239 U. S., at 47.\n                               B\n   Not only does Great Northern fail to support the major-\nity’s conclusion; significant aspects of Great Northern’s\nreasoning actually support the contrary view. In that\ncase, the Court relied heavily on Congress’ policy shift in\nthe early 1870’s away from bestowing extravagant “ ‘sub-\nsidies in public lands to railroads and other corporations.’ ”\n315 U. S., at 273–274 (quoting Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d\nSess., 1585 (1872)). That history similarly weighs in the\nGovernment’s favor here. Just as the post-1871 Congress\ndid not likely mean to confer subsurface mineral rights on\nrailroads, as held in Great Northern, it did not likely mean\nto grant railroads an indefeasible property interest in\nrights of way—a kind of interest more generous than that\n6         MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.\n\n                     UNITED STATES                            \n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nwhich it gave in our cases concerning pre-1871 grants.\n   As in Great Northern, moreover, the purpose of the 1875\nAct supports the Government. Congress passed the Act,\nwe noted, “to permit the construction of railroads through\npublic lands” and thus to “enhance their value and hasten\ntheir settlement.” 315 U. S., at 272. In Great Northern,\nwe held, that purpose did not require granting to the\nrailroad any right to that which lay beneath the surface.\nThe same is true here. As we recognized in Townsend and\nStringham, the United States granted rights of way to\nrailroads subject to “an implied condition of reverter in the\nevent that the” railroads “cease[d] to use or retain the land\nfor the purposes for which it is granted.” Stringham, 239\nU. S., at 47. Nothing about the purpose of the 1875 Act\nsuggests Congress ever meant to abandon that sensible\nlimitation.\n   Further, Great Northern relied on the conventional rule\nthat “a grant is to be resolved favorably to a sovereign\ngrantor,” 315 U. S., at 272, and that “ ‘nothing passes but\nwhat is conveyed in clear and explicit language,’ ” ibid.\n(quoting Caldwell v. United States, 250 U. S. 14, 20\n(1919)). “Nothing in the [1875] Act,” we observed, “may be\ncharacterized as a ‘clear and explicit’ conveyance of the . . .\noil and minerals” underlying a right of way. 315 U. S.,\nat 272. Just so here, as nothing in the 1875 Act clearly\nevinces Congress’ intent not to make the rights of way\nconveyed under the Act defeasible, in the manner de-\nscribed by Townsend and Stringham. In fact, the pre-\nsumption in favor of sovereign grantors applies doubly\nhere, where the United States was the sovereign grantor\nboth of the right of way and of the ultimate patent.\n                           III\n  The majority notes that in Great Northern, the United\nStates took the position that rights of way granted to\nrailroads are easements.

Ante, at 9.\n   Even assuming that it is an injustice for the Govern-\nment to change positions on an issue over a 70-year period,\nit is not clear that such a change in position happened\nhere. Yes, the Government argued in Great Northern that\na right of way was an “easement.” It proposed, however,\nthat the right of way may well have had “some of the\nattributes of a fee.” Brief for United States in Great\nNorthern R. Co. v. United States, O. T. 1941, No. 149,\npp. 36–37. The Government contended that it is “ ‘not\nimportant whether the interest or estate passed be consid-\nered an easement or a limited fee,’ ” observing that an\neasement “may be held in fee determinable.” Id., at 35–36\n(quoting United States v. Big Horn Land & Cattle Co., 17\nF. 2d 357, 365 (CA8 1927)). Indeed, the Government\nexpressly reserved the possibility that it retained a rever-\nsionary interest in the right of way, even if the surround-\ning land was patented to others. Brief for United States in\nGreat Northern, at 10 n. 4. The Court is right to criticize\nthe Government when it takes “self-serving” and contra-\ndictory positions, ante, at 12, but such critique is mis-\nplaced here.\n                        *    *     *\n  Since 1903, this Court has held that rights of way were\ngranted to railroads with an implied possibility of reverter\nto the United States. Regardless of whether these rights\nof way are labeled “easements” or “fees,” nothing in Great\nNorthern overruled that conclusion. By changing course\ntoday, the Court undermines the legality of thousands of\nmiles of former rights of way that the public now enjoys as\nmeans of transportation and recreation. And lawsuits\nchallenging the conversion of former rails to recreational\ntrails alone may well cost American taxpayers hundreds of\n8           MARVIN M.
