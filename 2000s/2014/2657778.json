QUALITY STORES, INC., ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12–1408. Argued January 14, 2014—Decided March 25, 2014\nRespondent Quality Stores, Inc., and its affiliates (collectively Quality\n  Stores) made severance payments to employees who were involuntar-\n  ily terminated as part of Quality Stores’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n  Payments—which were made pursuant to plans that did not tie pay-\n  ments to the receipt of state unemployment insurance—varied based\n  on job seniority and time served. Quality Stores paid and withheld,\n  inter alia, taxes required under the Federal Insurance Contributions\n  Act (FICA), 26 U. S. C. §3101 et seq. Later believing that the pay-\n  ments should not have been taxed as wages under FICA, Quality\n  Stores sought a refund on behalf of itself and about 1,850 former em-\n  ployees. When the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not allow or\n  deny the refund, Quality Stores initiated proceedings in the Bank-\n  ruptcy Court, which granted summary judgment in its favor. The\n  District Court and Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that severance\n  payments are not wages under FICA.\nHeld: The severance payments at issue are taxable wages for FICA\n purposes. Pp. 4–15.\n    (a) FICA defines “wages” broadly as “all remuneration for employ-\n ment.” §3121(a). As a matter of plain meaning, severance payments\n fit this definition: They are a form of remuneration made only to em-\n ployees in consideration for employment. “Employment” is “any ser-\n vice . . . performed . . . by an employee” for an employer. §3121(b).\n By varying according to a terminated employee’s function and senior-\n ity, the severance payments at issue confirm the principle that “ser-\n vice” “mea[ns] not only work actually done but the entire employer-\n employee relationship for which compensation is paid.” Social Secu-\n rity Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, 365–366. This broad definition is\n reinforced by the specificity of FICA’s lengthy list of exemptions. The\n2             UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    exemption for severance payments made “because of . . . retirement\n    for disability,” §3121(a)(13)(A), would be unnecessary were severance\n    payments generally not considered wages. FICA’s statutory history\n    sheds further light on the definition. FICA originally contained defi-\n    nitions of “wages” and “employment” identical in substance to the\n    current ones, but in 1939, Congress excepted from “wages”\n    “[d]ismissal payments” not legally required by the employer, 53 Stat.\n    1384. Since that exception was repealed in 1950, FICA has contained\n    no general exception for severance payments. Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) The Internal Revenue Code chapter governing income-tax with-\n    holding does not limit the meaning of “wages” for FICA purposes.\n    Like FICA’s definitional section, §3401(a) has a broad definition of\n    “wages” and contains a series of specific exemptions. Section 3402(o)\n    instructs that “supplemental unemployment compensation benefits”\n    or SUBs, which include severance payments, be treated “as if” they\n    were wages. Contrary to Quality Stores’ reading, this “as if” instruc-\n    tion does not mean that severance payments fall outside the defini-\n    tion of “wages” for income-tax withholding purposes and, in turn, are\n    not covered by FICA’s definition. Nor can Quality Stores rely on\n    §3402(o)’s heading, which refers to “certain payments other than\n    wages.” To the extent statutory headings are useful in resolving am-\n    biguity, see FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 388–389,\n    §3402(o)’s heading falls short of declaring that all the payments listed\n    in §3402(o) are “other than wages.” Instead, §3402(o) must be under-\n    stood in terms of the regulatory background against which it was en-\n    acted. In the 1950’s and 1960’s, because some States provided unem-\n    ployment benefits only to terminated employees not earning wages,\n    IRS Rulings took the position that severance payments tied to the re-\n    ceipt of state benefits were not wages. To address the problem that\n    severance payments were still considered taxable income, which\n    could lead to large year-end tax liability for terminated workers,\n    Congress enacted §3402(o), which treats both SUBs and severance\n    payments the IRS considered wages “as if” they were wages subject\n    to withholding. By extending this treatment to all SUBs, Congress\n    avoided the practical problems that might arise if the IRS later de-\n    termined that SUBs besides severance payments linked to state ben-\n    efits should be exempt from withholding. Considering this regulatory\n    background, the assumption that Congress meant to exclude all\n    SUBs from the definition of “wages” is unsustainable. That §3402(o)\n    does not narrow FICA’s “wages” definition is also consistent with the\n    major principle of Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U. S. 247: that\n    simplicity of administration and consistency of statutory interpreta-\n    tion instruct that the meaning of “wages” should be in general the\n    same for income-tax withholding and for FICA calculations.

QUALITY \n\n               STORES, INC., ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 25, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case presents the question whether severance pay-\nments made to employees terminated against their will\nare taxable wages under the Federal Insurance Contri-\nbutions Act (FICA), 26 U. S. C. §3101 et seq.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the\npayments are not wages taxed by FICA. To reach its\nholding, the Court of Appeals relied not on FICA’s defini-\ntion of wages but on §3402(o) of the Internal Revenue\nCode, a provision governing income-tax withholding. That\nconclusion, for the reasons to be discussed, was incorrect.\n   FICA’s broad definition of wages includes the severance\npayments made here. And §3402(o) does not alter that\ndefinition. Section 3402(o) instructs that any severance\npayment “shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages.”\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, §3402(o) suggests\nthat the definition of wages for income-tax withholding\ndoes not extend to severance payments; and so, the argu-\nment continues, severance payments also must be beyond\nthe terms of FICA’s similar definition. But §3402(o) is\nentirely compatible with the proposition that some or all\n2         UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npayments do fall within the broad definition of the term\nwages. Section 3402(o) was enacted in response to a nar-\nrow, specific problem regarding income-tax withholding.\nIn addition, were the Court to rule that the severance\npayments made here are exempt from FICA taxation but\nnot from withholding under §3402 for income-tax pur-\nposes, it would contravene the holding in Rowan Cos. v.\nUnited States, 452 U. S. 247 (1981), which held there\nshould be congruence in the rules for FICA and income-tax\nwithholding.\n                               I\n   Quality Stores, Inc., an agricultural-specialty retailer,\nentered bankruptcy proceedings in 2001. Before and\nfollowing the filing of an involuntary Chapter 11 bank-\nruptcy petition, respondents Quality Stores and affiliated\ncompanies, all referred to here as Quality Stores, termi-\nnated thousands of employees. The employees received\nseverance payments, which all parties to this case stipu-\nlate were the result of a reduction in work force or discon-\ntinuance of a plant or operation. The payments were\nmade pursuant to one of two different termination plans.\n(For reasons later to be explained, it should be noted that\nneither termination plan tied severance payments to the\nreceipt of state unemployment compensation.)\n   Under the first plan, terminated employees received\nseverance pay based on job grade and management level.\nThe president and chief executive officer received 18\nmonths of severance pay, senior managers received 12\nmonths of severance pay, and other employees received\none week of severance pay for each year of service.\n   The second plan was designed to facilitate Quality\nStores’ postbankruptcy operations and encourage employ-\nees to put off their job searches. To receive severance pay,\nemployees had to complete their last day of service as\ndetermined by the employer. Officers received between 6\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand 12 months of severance pay, and full-time employees\nand employees paid by the hour received one week of\nseverance pay for every year of service if the employees\nhad been employed for at least two years, up to a stated\nmaximum of severance pay. Workers who had been em-\nployed for less than two years received a week of sever-\nance pay.\n   Quality Stores reported the severance payments as\nwages on W–2 tax forms, paid the employer’s required\nshare of FICA taxes, and withheld employees’ share of\nFICA taxes. Then Quality Stores asked 3,100 former\nemployees to allow it to file FICA tax refund claims for\nthem. About 1,850 former employees agreed to allow Qual-\nity Stores to pursue FICA refunds. On its own behalf and\non behalf of the former employees, Quality Stores filed for\na refund of $1,000,125 in FICA taxes. The Internal Reve-\nnue Service neither allowed nor denied the claim.\n   Quality Stores initiated a proceeding in the Bankruptcy\nCourt seeking a refund of the disputed amount. The\nBankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in its\nfavor. The District Court and Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that severance pay-\nments are not “wages” under FICA. See In re Quality\nStores, Inc., 693 F. 3d 605 (2012). Other Courts of Ap-\npeals, however, have concluded that at least some sever-\nance payments do constitute wages subject to FICA tax.\nSee, e.g., CSX Corp. v. United States, 518 F. 3d 1328 (CA\nFed. 2008); University of Pittsburgh v. United States, 507\nF. 3d 165 (CA3 2007); North Dakota State Univ. v. United\nStates, 255 F. 3d 599 (CA8 2001). The United States,\nclaiming that the FICA taxes must be withheld, sought\nreview here; and certiorari was granted, 570 U. S. ___\n(2013).\n4         UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n    The first question is whether FICA’s definition of “wages”\nencompasses severance payments. The beginning point\nis the relevant statutory text. Mississippi ex rel. Hood\nv. AU Optronics Corp., 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op.,\nat 5).\n    To fund benefits provided by the Social Security Act and\nMedicare, FICA taxes “wages” paid by an employer or re-\nceived by an employee “with respect to employment.” 26\nU. S. C. §§3101(a), (b), 3111(a), (b). Congress chose to\ndefine wages under FICA “broadly.” Mayo Foundation for\nMedical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 2). FICA defines “wages” as “all\nremuneration for employment, including the cash value of\nall remuneration (including benefits) paid in any medium\nother than cash.” §3121(a). The term “employment”\nencompasses “any service, of whatever nature, performed\n. . . by an employee for the person employing him.”\n§3121(b).\n    Under this definition, and as a matter of plain meaning,\nseverance payments made to terminated employees are\n“remuneration for employment.” Severance payments are,\nof course, “remuneration,” and common sense dictates that\nemployees receive the payments “for employment.” Sever-\nance payments are made to employees only. It would\nbe contrary to common usage to describe as a severance\npayment remuneration provided to someone who has not\nworked for the employer. Severance payments are made\nin consideration for employment—for a “service . . . per-\nformed” by “an employee for the person employing him,”\nper FICA’s definition of the term “employment.” Ibid.\n    In Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358 (1946),\nthe Court interpreted the term “wages” in the Social Secu-\nrity statutory context to have substantial breadth. In that\ncase a worker, who had been wrongfully terminated,\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsought to have his backpay counted as taxable wages for\nthe purpose of obtaining credits under the Social Security\nsystem. The Court stated that the term “service,” used\nwith respect to Social Security, “means not only work\nactually done but the entire employer-employee relation-\nship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the\nemployer.” Id., at 365–366.\n  As confirmation of that principle, severance payments\noften vary, as they did here, according to the function and\nseniority of the particular employee who is terminated.\nFor example, under both termination plans, Quality\nStores employees were given severance payments based on\njob grade and management level. And under the second\ntermination plan, nonofficer employees who had served at\nleast two years with their company received more in sev-\nerance pay than nonofficer employees who had not—a\nstandard example of a company policy to reward employ-\nees for a greater length of good service and loyalty.\n  In this respect severance payments are like many other\nbenefits employers offer to employees above and beyond\nsalary payments. Like health and retirement benefits,\nstock options, or merit-based bonuses, a competitive sev-\nerance payment package can help attract talented em-\nployees. Here, the terminations leading to the severance\npayments were triggered by the employer’s involuntary\nbankruptcy proceeding, a prospect against which employ-\nees may wish to protect themselves in an economy that is\nalways subject to changing conditions.\n  Severance payments, moreover, can be desirable from\nthe perspective of the employer as an alternative or sup-\nplemental form of remuneration. In situations in which\nChapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization is necessary, an\nemployer may seek to retain goodwill by paying its termi-\nnated employees well, thus reinforcing its reputation as a\nworthy employer. Employers who downsize in a period of\nslow business may wish to retain the ability to rehire\n6         UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nemployees who have been terminated.\n   A specific exemption under FICA for certain termina-\ntion-related payments reinforces the conclusion that the\npayments in question are well within the definition of\nwages.     Section 3121(a)(13)(A) exempts from taxable\nwages any severance payments made “because of . . . retire-\nment for disability.” That exemption would be unneces-\nsary were severance payments in general not within\nFICA’s definition of “wages.” Cf. American Bank & Trust\nCo. v. Dallas County, 463 U. S. 855, 864 (1983) (declining\nto read a statute in a manner that would cause “spe-\ncific exemptions” to be “superfluous”). FICA’s definitional\nsection, moreover, provides a lengthy list of specific ex-\nemptions from the definition of wages. For example, FICA\nexempts from wages payments on account of disability\ncaused by sickness or accident, cash payments made for\ndomestic service in a private home under a certain\namount, and cash tips less than a certain amount. See\n§§3121(a)(2)(A), (7)(B), (12)(B). The specificity of these\nexemptions reinforces the broad nature of FICA’s defini-\ntion of wages.\n   FICA’s statutory history sheds further light on the text\nof §3121, which defines the term “wages.” FICA was\noriginally enacted in Title VIII of the Social Security Act,\n49 Stat. 636. (In 1939, Title VIII was transferred to the\nInternal Revenue Code and became FICA. 53 Stat. 1387.)\nTitle VIII contained, in substance, definitions of “wages”\nand “employment” identical to those FICA now provides.\nSee §811(a), 49 Stat. 639; §811(b), ibid. With respect to\nthe Social Security Act, in 1936 the Treasury Department\npromulgated a regulation stating that the statutory defini-\ntion of “wages” included “dismissal pay.” Bureau of Inter-\nnal Revenue, Employees’ Tax and the Employers’ Tax\nUnder Title VIII of the Social Security Act, 1 Fed. Reg.\n1764, 1769 (1936). Congress responded a few years later,\nin 1939, by creating an exception from “wages” for\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“[d]ismissal payments which the employer is not legally\nrequired to make.” Social Security Act Amendments of\n1939, §606, 53 Stat. 1384 (codified at 26 U. S. C.\n§1426(a)(4) (1940 ed.)).\n  In 1950, however, Congress repealed that exception.\nSocial Security Act Amendments, §203(a), 64 Stat. 525–\n527. “When Congress acts to amend a statute, we pre-\nsume it intends its amendment to have real and sub-\nstantial effect.” Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 397 (1995).\nCongress has not revisited its 1950 amendment; and since\nthat time, FICA has contained no exception for severance\npayments.\n                           B\n  The next question is whether §3402(o) of the Internal\nRevenue Code relating to income-tax withholding is a\nlimitation on the meaning of “wages” for FICA purposes.\nSection 3402 provides:\n    “(o) Extension of withholding to certain pay-\n    ments other than wages.\n       “(1) General rule\n       “For purposes of this chapter (and so much of subti-\n    tle F as relates to this chapter)—\n       “(A) any supplemental unemployment compensation\n    benefit paid to an individual,\n    .            .           .         .         .\n  “shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages by an\n  employer to an employee for a payroll period.”\n(Pursuant to stipulations by the parties, the Court of\nAppeals determined that the severance payments consti-\ntute “supplemental unemployment compensation bene-\nfits,” or SUBs. See §3402(o)(2)(A). The Court assumes, for\npurposes of this case, that this premise is correct.)\n   Quality Stores argues that §3402(o)’s instruction that\nSUBs be treated “as if ” they were wages for purposes of\n8         UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nincome-tax withholding is an indirect means of stating\nthat the definition of wages for income-tax withholding\ndoes not cover severance payments. It contends, further,\nthat if the definition of wages for purposes of income-tax\nwithholding does not encompass severance payments, then\nseverance payments are not covered by FICA’s similar\ndefinition of wages.\n   The Court disagrees that §3402(o) should be read as\nQuality Stores suggests. The chapter governing income-\ntax withholding has a broad definition of the term “wages”:\n“all remuneration . . . for services performed by an em-\nployee for his employer, including the cash value of all\nremuneration (including benefits) paid in any medium\nother than cash.” §3401(a). The definitional section for\nincome-tax withholding, like the definitional section for\nFICA, contains a series of specific exemptions that rein-\nforce the broad scope of its definition of wages. The provi-\nsion exempts from wages, for example, any remuneration\npaid for domestic service in a private home, for services\nrendered to a foreign government, and for services per-\nformed by a minister of a church in the course of his du-\nties. §§3401(a)(3), (5), (9). Severance payments are not\nexempted, and they squarely fall within the broad textual\ndefinition of wages for purposes of income-tax withholding\nunder §3401(a), for the same reasons outlined above with\nrespect to FICA’s similar definition of wages.\n   Quality Stores contends that, the broad wording of the\ndefinition in §3401(a) aside, severance payments must fall\noutside the definition of wages for income-tax withholding.\nOtherwise, it argues, §3402(o) would be superfluous. But,\nas the Government points out, §3402(o)’s command that\nall severance payments be treated “as if ” they were wages\nfor income-tax withholding is in all respects consistent\nwith the proposition that at least some severance pay-\nments are wages. As the Federal Circuit explained when\nconstruing §3402(o), the statement that “all men shall be\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntreated as if they were six feet tall does not imply that no\nmen are six feet tall.” CSX Corp., 518 F. 3d, at 1342.\n  In the last of its textual arguments, Quality Stores\ndraws attention to the boldface heading of §3402(o), which\nstates, “Extension of withholding to certain payments\nother than wages.” It contends the heading declares that\nthe payments enumerated within §3402(o) are “other than\nwages.” Captions, of course, can be “a useful aid in resolv-\ning” a statutory text’s “ambiguity.” FTC v. Mandel Broth-\ners, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 388–389 (1959). But Quality\nStores cannot rely on the statutory heading to support its\nargument that §3402(o), without ambiguity, excludes all\nseverance payments from the definition of wages. The\nheading states that withholding is extended to “certain\npayments.” This falls short of a declaration that all the\npayments listed in §3402(o) are not wages.\n  Next, the regulatory background against which §3402(o)\nwas enacted illustrates the limited nature of the problem\nthe provision was enacted to address. For this purpose, it\nis instructive to concentrate on the statutory term “sup-\nplemental unemployment benefits,” which defines the\nscope of §3402(o)’s income-tax withholding mandate.\n  The concept of SUBs originated in labor demands for a\nguaranteed annual wage. When it became clear this was\n“impractical in their industries, unions such as the Steel-\nworkers and the United Auto Workers transformed their\nguaranteed annual wage demands into proposals to sup-\nplement existing unemployment compensation programs.”\nCoffy v. Republic Steel Corp., 447 U. S. 191, 200 (1980). A\nSUB plan, as originally conceived, offered “second-level\nprotection against layoff ” by supplementing unemploy-\nment benefits offered by the States. Ibid.\n  In the 1950’s, major American employers such as Ford\nMotor Company adopted SUB plans of this type, agreeing\nto fund trusts that would provide SUBs to terminated\nemployees. For example, Ford’s contract with employees\n10        UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndefined the concept of SUBs as the receipt of “both a state\nsystem unemployment benefit and a Weekly Supplemental\nBenefit . . . without reduction of the state system unem-\nployment benefit because of the payment of the Weekly\nSupplemental Benefit.” Note, Effect of Receiving Supple-\nmental Unemployment Benefits on Eligibility for State\nBenefits, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 362, 364, n. 11 (1955); see\nJ. Becker, Guaranteed Income for the Unemployed: The\nStory of SUB (1968). Employer plans that provided SUBs\nsought “to provide economic security for regular employ-\nees” and “to assure a stable work force through periods of\nshort-term layoffs.” Coffy, supra, at 200.\n   But an obstacle arose. For these plans to work, it was\nnecessary to avoid having the SUBs defined under federal\nlaw as “wages.” That was because some States only pro-\nvided unemployment benefits if terminated employees\nwere not earning “wages” from their employers. See Brief\nfor United States 29; CSX Corp., supra, at 1334–1335;\nNote, 69 Harv. L. Rev., at 366 (“The typical state unem-\nployment compensation statute provides that ‘an individ-\nual shall be deemed unemployed in any week with respect\nto which no wages are payable to him and during which he\nperforms no services . . .’ ” (ellipsis and emphasis in origi-\nnal)); id., at 367 (“[S]tates tend to treat as ‘wages’ those\nitems which the federal government treats as ‘wages’ ”).\n   The inability of terminated employees to receive state\nunemployment benefits, of course, would render SUBs far\nless useful to them and their employers. Employers, as a\nconsequence, undertook to ensure that the Federal Gov-\nernment did not construe benefits paid out by SUB plans\nas “wages.” CSX Corp., supra, at 1334–1335.\n   In at least partial response to the prospect of differential\ntreatment of SUBs based on the vagaries of state law, the\nIRS promulgated a series of Revenue Rulings in the 1950’s\nand 1960’s that took the position that SUB payments were\nnot “wages” under FICA as well as for purposes of income-\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Rev. Rul.\n56–249, 1956–1 Cum. Bull. 488. As a result, terminated\nemployees faced significant tax liability at the end of\nthe year. The Treasury Department suggested Congress\nauthorize the agency to promulgate regulations allowing\nvoluntary withholding. Statements and Recommenda-\ntions of the Department of the Treasury: Hearings on\nH. R. 13270 before the Senate Committee on Finance, 91st\nCong., 1st Sess., 905–906 (1969).\n   In 1969, Congress chose instead to address the with-\nholding problem by enacting §3402(o). It provides that all\nseverance payments—that is, both SUBs as well as sever-\nance payments that the IRS considered wages—shall be\n“treated as if ” they were wages for purposes of income-tax\nwithholding. It is apparent that the definition Congress\nadopted in §3402(o) is not limited to the SUBs that the\nIRS had deemed exempt from wages under FICA. See\n§3402(o)(2)(A). It must be presumed that Congress was\naware that §3402(o) covered more than the severance\npayments that were excluded from income-tax withhold-\ning. Not all severance payment plans were tied to state\nunemployment benefits; and, before §3402(o)’s 1969 en-\nactment, the IRS ruled that severance payments not\nlinked to state unemployment benefits were wages for\npurposes of income-tax withholding. See Rev. Rul. 65–\n251, 1965–2 Cum. Bull. 395; see also TAM 9416003 (the\nIRS’ original 1956 exception for SUBs provided “a limited\nexception from the definition of wages for . . . federal\nincome tax withholding . . . only if the payments are de-\n12        UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsigned to supplement the receipt of state unemployment\ncompensation and are actually tied to state unemployment\nbenefits”); ibid. (“SUB-pay plans must be designed to\nsupplement unemployment benefits . . .”).\n   Once this background is understood, the Court of Ap-\npeals’ interpretation of §3402(o) as standing for some\nbroad definitional principle is shown to be incorrect.\nAlthough Congress need not have agreed with the Reve-\nnue Rulings to enact §3402(o), its purpose to eliminate\nthe withholding problem caused by the differential treat-\nment of severance payments is the necessary background\nto understand the meaning and purpose of the provision.\nThe problem Congress sought to resolve was the prospect\nthat terminated employees would owe large payments in\ntaxes at the end of the year as a result of the IRS’ exemp-\ntion of certain SUBs from withholding. It remained possi-\nble that the IRS would determine that other forms of SUB\nplans, perhaps linked differently to state unemployment\nbenefits, should be exempt from withholding. If Congress\nhad only incorporated the Revenue Rulings already in\neffect, that response may have risked the withholding\nproblem arising once again. On the other hand, by draw-\ning a withholding requirement that was broader than\nthen-current IRS exemptions, Congress avoided these\npractical problems. A requirement that a form of remu-\nneration already included as wages be treated “as if ” it\nwere wages created no administrative difficulties.\n   The Court of Appeals understood Congress’ decision to\ninclude within §3402(o) a larger set of SUBs than was\nalready exempt from withholding under IRS Revenue\nRulings to mean that all SUBs were excluded from the\ndefinition of wages. But that assumption, although in the\nabstract not necessarily an illogical inference, is unsus-\ntainable, considering the regulatory background against\nwhich §3402(o) was enacted. Congress interpreted the\nRevenue Rulings not at all as a definitive gloss on the\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmeaning of the term “wages” in §3401. The better reading\nis that Congress determined that, whatever position the\nIRS took with respect to certain categories of severance\npayments, the problem with withholding should be solved\nby treating all severance payments as wages requiring\nwithholding.\n  The necessary conclusion is that §3402(o) does not nar-\nrow the term “wages” under FICA to exempt all severance\npayments. This reasoning is consistent with Rowan, a\nprevious decision interpreting FICA. In Rowan, the Court\nheld that Treasury Regulations interpreting “wages”un-\nder FICA to include the value of meals and lodging were\ninvalid. The Government conceded, for income-tax pur-\nposes, that the taxpayer in Rowan was correct to exempt\nthe value of the meals and lodging in computing the wages\nproperly withheld under §3402. 452 U. S., at 250–251.\nBut it argued, nevertheless, that the value of the meals\nand lodging was taxable as wages under FICA, pursuant\nto Treasury Regulations. The Rowan Court observed that\nthe definition of wages under FICA was in substance the\nsame as for purposes of withholding. Id., at 255. The\nCourt read that similarity to be “strong evidence that\nCongress intended ‘wages’ to mean the same thing under\nFICA . . . and income-tax withholding.” Ibid. To support\nthat conclusion, the Court noted a “congressional concern\nfor ‘the interest of simplicity and ease of administration.’ ”\nIbid. (quoting S. Rep. No. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 165\n(1942)). Because “Congress intended . . . to coordinate the\nincome-tax withholding system with FICA” in order “to\npromote simplicity and ease of administration,” the Court\nheld that it would be “extraordinary” for Congress to\nintend the definitions of “wages” to vary between FICA\nand income-tax withholding. 452 U. S., at 257.\n  The specific holding of Rowan—that regulations govern-\ning meals and lodging were invalid—has little or no\nbearing on the issue confronting us here. What is of im-\n14        UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nportance is the major principle recognized in Rowan: that\nsimplicity of administration and consistency of statutory\ninterpretation instruct that the meaning of “wages” should\nbe in general the same for income-tax withholding and for\nFICA calculations.\n  Quality Stores contends that, under the mandate of\n§3402(o), severance payments are not subject to FICA\ntaxation but are to be deemed wages for purposes of\nincome-tax withholding. It justifies this differential treat-\nment in the name of uniformity. But that so-called uni-\nformity as to the definitions of wages (i.e., that severance\npayments are not wages) is not consistent with the broad\ntextual definitions of wages under FICA and income-tax\nwithholding. Nor is it consistent with this Court’s holding\nthat administrative reasons justify treating severance\npayments as taxable for both FICA and income-tax pur-\nposes. To read Congress’ command to withhold severance\npayments as an implicit overruling of the broad definition\nof wages in FICA would disserve the statutory text and\nthe congressional interest in administrative simplicity\ndeemed controlling in Rowan.\n  In concluding, the Court notes that the IRS still pro-\nvides that severance payments tied to the receipt of state\nunemployment benefits are exempt not only from income-\ntax withholding but also from FICA taxation. See, e.g.,\nRev. Rul. 90–72, 1990–2 Cum. Bull. 211. Those Revenue\nRulings are not at issue here. Because the severance\npayments here were not linked to state unemployment\nbenefits, the Court does not reach the question whether\nthe IRS’ current exemption is consistent with the broad\ndefinition of wages under FICA.\n                      *    *    *\n  The severance payments here were made to employees\nterminated against their will, were varied based on job\nseniority and time served, and were not linked to the\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Argued January 14, 2014—Decided March 25, 2014\nRespondent Quality Stores, Inc., and its affiliates (collectively Quality\n  Stores) made severance payments to employees who were involuntar-\n  ily terminated as part of Quality Stores’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n  Payments—which were made pursuant to plans that did not tie pay-\n  ments to the receipt of state unemployment insurance—varied based\n  on job seniority and time served. Quality Stores paid and withheld,\n  inter alia, taxes required under the Federal Insurance Contributions\n  Act (FICA), 26 U. S. C. §3101 et seq. Later believing that the pay-\n  ments should not have been taxed as wages under FICA, Quality\n  Stores sought a refund on behalf of itself and about 1,850 former em-\n  ployees. When the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not allow or\n  deny the refund, Quality Stores initiated proceedings in the Bank-\n  ruptcy Court, which granted summary judgment in its favor. The\n  District Court and Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that severance\n  payments are not wages under FICA.\nHeld: The severance payments at issue are taxable wages for FICA\n purposes. Pp. 4–15.\n    (a) FICA defines “wages” broadly as “all remuneration for employ-\n ment.” §3121(a). As a matter of plain meaning, severance payments\n fit this definition: They are a form of remuneration made only to em-\n ployees in consideration for employment. “Employment” is “any ser-\n vice . . . performed . . . by an employee” for an employer. §3121(b).\n By varying according to a terminated employee’s function and senior-\n ity, the severance payments at issue confirm the principle that “ser-\n vice” “mea[ns] not only work actually done but the entire employer-\n employee relationship for which compensation is paid.” Social Secu-\n rity Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, 365–366. This broad definition is\n reinforced by the specificity of FICA’s lengthy list of exemptions. The\n2             UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    exemption for severance payments made “because of . . . retirement\n    for disability,” §3121(a)(13)(A), would be unnecessary were severance\n    payments generally not considered wages. FICA’s statutory history\n    sheds further light on the definition. FICA originally contained defi-\n    nitions of “wages” and “employment” identical in substance to the\n    current ones, but in 1939, Congress excepted from “wages”\n    “[d]ismissal payments” not legally required by the employer, 53 Stat.\n    1384. Since that exception was repealed in 1950, FICA has contained\n    no general exception for severance payments. Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) The Internal Revenue Code chapter governing income-tax with-\n    holding does not limit the meaning of “wages” for FICA purposes.\n    Like FICA’s definitional section, §3401(a) has a broad definition of\n    “wages” and contains a series of specific exemptions. Section 3402(o)\n    instructs that “supplemental unemployment compensation benefits”\n    or SUBs, which include severance payments, be treated “as if” they\n    were wages. Contrary to Quality Stores’ reading, this “as if” instruc-\n    tion does not mean that severance payments fall outside the defini-\n    tion of “wages” for income-tax withholding purposes and, in turn, are\n    not covered by FICA’s definition. Nor can Quality Stores rely on\n    §3402(o)’s heading, which refers to “certain payments other than\n    wages.” To the extent statutory headings are useful in resolving am-\n    biguity, see FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 388–389,\n    §3402(o)’s heading falls short of declaring that all the payments listed\n    in §3402(o) are “other than wages.” Instead, §3402(o) must be under-\n    stood in terms of the regulatory background against which it was en-\n    acted. In the 1950’s and 1960’s, because some States provided unem-\n    ployment benefits only to terminated employees not earning wages,\n    IRS Rulings took the position that severance payments tied to the re-\n    ceipt of state benefits were not wages. To address the problem that\n    severance payments were still considered taxable income, which\n    could lead to large year-end tax liability for terminated workers,\n    Congress enacted §3402(o), which treats both SUBs and severance\n    payments the IRS considered wages “as if” they were wages subject\n    to withholding. By extending this treatment to all SUBs, Congress\n    avoided the practical problems that might arise if the IRS later de-\n    termined that SUBs besides severance payments linked to state ben-\n    efits should be exempt from withholding. Considering this regulatory\n    background, the assumption that Congress meant to exclude all\n    SUBs from the definition of “wages” is unsustainable. That §3402(o)\n    does not narrow FICA’s “wages” definition is also consistent with the\n    major principle of Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U. S. 247: that\n    simplicity of administration and consistency of statutory interpreta-\n    tion instruct that the meaning of “wages” should be in general the\n    same for income-tax withholding and for FICA calculations.

S. C. §3101 et seq.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the\npayments are not wages taxed by FICA. To reach its\nholding, the Court of Appeals relied not on FICA’s defini-\ntion of wages but on §3402(o) of the Internal Revenue\nCode, a provision governing income-tax withholding. That\nconclusion, for the reasons to be discussed, was incorrect.\n   FICA’s broad definition of wages includes the severance\npayments made here. And §3402(o) does not alter that\ndefinition. Section 3402(o) instructs that any severance\npayment “shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages.”\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, §3402(o) suggests\nthat the definition of wages for income-tax withholding\ndoes not extend to severance payments; and so, the argu-\nment continues, severance payments also must be beyond\nthe terms of FICA’s similar definition. But §3402(o) is\nentirely compatible with the proposition that some or all\n2         UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npayments do fall within the broad definition of the term\nwages. Section 3402(o) was enacted in response to a nar-\nrow, specific problem regarding income-tax withholding.\nIn addition, were the Court to rule that the severance\npayments made here are exempt from FICA taxation but\nnot from withholding under §3402 for income-tax pur-\nposes, it would contravene the holding in Rowan Cos. v.\nUnited States, 452 U. S. 247 (1981), which held there\nshould be congruence in the rules for FICA and income-tax\nwithholding.\n                               I\n   Quality Stores, Inc., an agricultural-specialty retailer,\nentered bankruptcy proceedings in 2001. Before and\nfollowing the filing of an involuntary Chapter 11 bank-\nruptcy petition, respondents Quality Stores and affiliated\ncompanies, all referred to here as Quality Stores, termi-\nnated thousands of employees. The employees received\nseverance payments, which all parties to this case stipu-\nlate were the result of a reduction in work force or discon-\ntinuance of a plant or operation. The payments were\nmade pursuant to one of two different termination plans.\n(For reasons later to be explained, it should be noted that\nneither termination plan tied severance payments to the\nreceipt of state unemployment compensation.)\n   Under the first plan, terminated employees received\nseverance pay based on job grade and management level.\nThe president and chief executive officer received 18\nmonths of severance pay, senior managers received 12\nmonths of severance pay, and other employees received\none week of severance pay for each year of service.\n   The second plan was designed to facilitate Quality\nStores’ postbankruptcy operations and encourage employ-\nees to put off their job searches. To receive severance pay,\nemployees had to complete their last day of service as\ndetermined by the employer. Officers received between 6\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Workers who had been em-\nployed for less than two years received a week of sever-\nance pay.\n   Quality Stores reported the severance payments as\nwages on W–2 tax forms, paid the employer’s required\nshare of FICA taxes, and withheld employees’ share of\nFICA taxes. Then Quality Stores asked 3,100 former\nemployees to allow it to file FICA tax refund claims for\nthem. About 1,850 former employees agreed to allow Qual-\nity Stores to pursue FICA refunds. On its own behalf and\non behalf of the former employees, Quality Stores filed for\na refund of $1,000,125 in FICA taxes. The Internal Reve-\nnue Service neither allowed nor denied the claim.\n   Quality Stores initiated a proceeding in the Bankruptcy\nCourt seeking a refund of the disputed amount. The\nBankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in its\nfavor. The District Court and Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that severance pay-\nments are not “wages” under FICA. See In re Quality\nStores, Inc., 693 F. 3d 605 (2012). Other Courts of Ap-\npeals, however, have concluded that at least some sever-\nance payments do constitute wages subject to FICA tax.\nSee, e.g., CSX Corp. v. United States, 518 F. 3d 1328 (CA\nFed. 2008); University of Pittsburgh v. United States, 507\nF. 3d 165 (CA3 2007); North Dakota State Univ. v. United\nStates, 255 F. 3d 599 (CA8 2001).

The beginning point\nis the relevant statutory text. Mississippi ex rel. Hood\nv. AU Optronics Corp., 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op.,\nat 5).\n    To fund benefits provided by the Social Security Act and\nMedicare, FICA taxes “wages” paid by an employer or re-\nceived by an employee “with respect to employment.” 26\nU. S. C. §§3101(a), (b), 3111(a), (b). Congress chose to\ndefine wages under FICA “broadly.” Mayo Foundation for\nMedical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 2). FICA defines “wages” as “all\nremuneration for employment, including the cash value of\nall remuneration (including benefits) paid in any medium\nother than cash.” §3121(a). The term “employment”\nencompasses “any service, of whatever nature, performed\n. . . by an employee for the person employing him.”\n§3121(b).\n    Under this definition, and as a matter of plain meaning,\nseverance payments made to terminated employees are\n“remuneration for employment.” Severance payments are,\nof course, “remuneration,” and common sense dictates that\nemployees receive the payments “for employment.” Sever-\nance payments are made to employees only. It would\nbe contrary to common usage to describe as a severance\npayment remuneration provided to someone who has not\nworked for the employer. Severance payments are made\nin consideration for employment—for a “service . . . per-\nformed” by “an employee for the person employing him,”\nper FICA’s definition of the term “employment.” Ibid.\n    In Social Security Bd. v.

S. ____ (2014)          5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsought to have his backpay counted as taxable wages for\nthe purpose of obtaining credits under the Social Security\nsystem. The Court stated that the term “service,” used\nwith respect to Social Security, “means not only work\nactually done but the entire employer-employee relation-\nship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the\nemployer.” Id., at 365–366.\n  As confirmation of that principle, severance payments\noften vary, as they did here, according to the function and\nseniority of the particular employee who is terminated.\nFor example, under both termination plans, Quality\nStores employees were given severance payments based on\njob grade and management level. And under the second\ntermination plan, nonofficer employees who had served at\nleast two years with their company received more in sev-\nerance pay than nonofficer employees who had not—a\nstandard example of a company policy to reward employ-\nees for a greater length of good service and loyalty.\n  In this respect severance payments are like many other\nbenefits employers offer to employees above and beyond\nsalary payments. Like health and retirement benefits,\nstock options, or merit-based bonuses, a competitive sev-\nerance payment package can help attract talented em-\nployees. Here, the terminations leading to the severance\npayments were triggered by the employer’s involuntary\nbankruptcy proceeding, a prospect against which employ-\nees may wish to protect themselves in an economy that is\nalways subject to changing conditions.\n  Severance payments, moreover, can be desirable from\nthe perspective of the employer as an alternative or sup-\nplemental form of remuneration. In situations in which\nChapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization is necessary, an\nemployer may seek to retain goodwill by paying its termi-\nnated employees well, thus reinforcing its reputation as a\nworthy employer. Employers who downsize in a period of\nslow business may wish to retain the ability to rehire\n6         UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nemployees who have been terminated.\n   A specific exemption under FICA for certain termina-\ntion-related payments reinforces the conclusion that the\npayments in question are well within the definition of\nwages.     Section 3121(a)(13)(A) exempts from taxable\nwages any severance payments made “because of . . . retire-\nment for disability.” That exemption would be unneces-\nsary were severance payments in general not within\nFICA’s definition of “wages.” Cf. American Bank & Trust\nCo. v. Dallas County, 463 U. S. 855, 864 (1983) (declining\nto read a statute in a manner that would cause “spe-\ncific exemptions” to be “superfluous”). FICA’s definitional\nsection, moreover, provides a lengthy list of specific ex-\nemptions from the definition of wages. For example, FICA\nexempts from wages payments on account of disability\ncaused by sickness or accident, cash payments made for\ndomestic service in a private home under a certain\namount, and cash tips less than a certain amount. See\n§§3121(a)(2)(A), (7)(B), (12)(B). The specificity of these\nexemptions reinforces the broad nature of FICA’s defini-\ntion of wages.\n   FICA’s statutory history sheds further light on the text\nof §3121, which defines the term “wages.” FICA was\noriginally enacted in Title VIII of the Social Security Act,\n49 Stat. 636. (In 1939, Title VIII was transferred to the\nInternal Revenue Code and became FICA. 53 Stat. 1387.)\nTitle VIII contained, in substance, definitions of “wages”\nand “employment” identical to those FICA now provides.\nSee §811(a), 49 Stat. 639; §811(b), ibid. With respect to\nthe Social Security Act, in 1936 the Treasury Department\npromulgated a regulation stating that the statutory defini-\ntion of “wages” included “dismissal pay.” Bureau of Inter-\nnal Revenue, Employees’ Tax and the Employers’ Tax\nUnder Title VIII of the Social Security Act, 1 Fed.

INS, 514 U. S. 386, 397 (1995).\nCongress has not revisited its 1950 amendment; and since\nthat time, FICA has contained no exception for severance\npayments.\n                           B\n  The next question is whether §3402(o) of the Internal\nRevenue Code relating to income-tax withholding is a\nlimitation on the meaning of “wages” for FICA purposes.\nSection 3402 provides:\n    “(o) Extension of withholding to certain pay-\n    ments other than wages.\n       “(1) General rule\n       “For purposes of this chapter (and so much of subti-\n    tle F as relates to this chapter)—\n       “(A) any supplemental unemployment compensation\n    benefit paid to an individual,\n    .            .           .         .         .\n  “shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages by an\n  employer to an employee for a payroll period.”\n(Pursuant to stipulations by the parties, the Court of\nAppeals determined that the severance payments consti-\ntute “supplemental unemployment compensation bene-\nfits,” or SUBs. See §3402(o)(2)(A). The Court assumes, for\npurposes of this case, that this premise is correct.)\n   Quality Stores argues that §3402(o)’s instruction that\nSUBs be treated “as if ” they were wages for purposes of\n8         UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nincome-tax withholding is an indirect means of stating\nthat the definition of wages for income-tax withholding\ndoes not cover severance payments. It contends, further,\nthat if the definition of wages for purposes of income-tax\nwithholding does not encompass severance payments, then\nseverance payments are not covered by FICA’s similar\ndefinition of wages.\n   The Court disagrees that §3402(o) should be read as\nQuality Stores suggests. The chapter governing income-\ntax withholding has a broad definition of the term “wages”:\n“all remuneration . . . for services performed by an em-\nployee for his employer, including the cash value of all\nremuneration (including benefits) paid in any medium\nother than cash.” §3401(a). The definitional section for\nincome-tax withholding, like the definitional section for\nFICA, contains a series of specific exemptions that rein-\nforce the broad scope of its definition of wages. The provi-\nsion exempts from wages, for example, any remuneration\npaid for domestic service in a private home, for services\nrendered to a foreign government, and for services per-\nformed by a minister of a church in the course of his du-\nties. §§3401(a)(3), (5), (9). Severance payments are not\nexempted, and they squarely fall within the broad textual\ndefinition of wages for purposes of income-tax withholding\nunder §3401(a), for the same reasons outlined above with\nrespect to FICA’s similar definition of wages.\n   Quality Stores contends that, the broad wording of the\ndefinition in §3401(a) aside, severance payments must fall\noutside the definition of wages for income-tax withholding.\nOtherwise, it argues, §3402(o) would be superfluous. But,\nas the Government points out, §3402(o)’s command that\nall severance payments be treated “as if ” they were wages\nfor income-tax withholding is in all respects consistent\nwith the proposition that at least some severance pay-\nments are wages. As the Federal Circuit explained when\nconstruing §3402(o), the statement that “all men shall be\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntreated as if they were six feet tall does not imply that no\nmen are six feet tall.” CSX Corp., 518 F. 3d, at 1342.\n  In the last of its textual arguments, Quality Stores\ndraws attention to the boldface heading of §3402(o), which\nstates, “Extension of withholding to certain payments\nother than wages.” It contends the heading declares that\nthe payments enumerated within §3402(o) are “other than\nwages.” Captions, of course, can be “a useful aid in resolv-\ning” a statutory text’s “ambiguity.” FTC v. Mandel Broth-\ners, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 388–389 (1959). But Quality\nStores cannot rely on the statutory heading to support its\nargument that §3402(o), without ambiguity, excludes all\nseverance payments from the definition of wages. The\nheading states that withholding is extended to “certain\npayments.” This falls short of a declaration that all the\npayments listed in §3402(o) are not wages.\n  Next, the regulatory background against which §3402(o)\nwas enacted illustrates the limited nature of the problem\nthe provision was enacted to address. For this purpose, it\nis instructive to concentrate on the statutory term “sup-\nplemental unemployment benefits,” which defines the\nscope of §3402(o)’s income-tax withholding mandate.\n  The concept of SUBs originated in labor demands for a\nguaranteed annual wage. When it became clear this was\n“impractical in their industries, unions such as the Steel-\nworkers and the United Auto Workers transformed their\nguaranteed annual wage demands into proposals to sup-\nplement existing unemployment compensation programs.”\nCoffy v. Republic Steel Corp., 447 U. S. 191, 200 (1980). A\nSUB plan, as originally conceived, offered “second-level\nprotection against layoff ” by supplementing unemploy-\nment benefits offered by the States. Ibid.\n  In the 1950’s, major American employers such as Ford\nMotor Company adopted SUB plans of this type, agreeing\nto fund trusts that would provide SUBs to terminated\nemployees. For example, Ford’s contract with employees\n10        UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndefined the concept of SUBs as the receipt of “both a state\nsystem unemployment benefit and a Weekly Supplemental\nBenefit . . . without reduction of the state system unem-\nployment benefit because of the payment of the Weekly\nSupplemental Benefit.” Note, Effect of Receiving Supple-\nmental Unemployment Benefits on Eligibility for State\nBenefits, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 362, 364, n. 11 (1955); see\nJ. Becker, Guaranteed Income for the Unemployed: The\nStory of SUB (1968). Employer plans that provided SUBs\nsought “to provide economic security for regular employ-\nees” and “to assure a stable work force through periods of\nshort-term layoffs.” Coffy, supra, at 200.\n   But an obstacle arose. For these plans to work, it was\nnecessary to avoid having the SUBs defined under federal\nlaw as “wages.” That was because some States only pro-\nvided unemployment benefits if terminated employees\nwere not earning “wages” from their employers. See Brief\nfor United States 29; CSX Corp., supra, at 1334–1335;\nNote, 69 Harv. L. Rev., at 366 (“The typical state unem-\nployment compensation statute provides that ‘an individ-\nual shall be deemed unemployed in any week with respect\nto which no wages are payable to him and during which he\nperforms no services . . .’ ” (ellipsis and emphasis in origi-\nnal)); id., at 367 (“[S]tates tend to treat as ‘wages’ those\nitems which the federal government treats as ‘wages’ ”).\n   The inability of terminated employees to receive state\nunemployment benefits, of course, would render SUBs far\nless useful to them and their employers. Employers, as a\nconsequence, undertook to ensure that the Federal Gov-\nernment did not construe benefits paid out by SUB plans\nas “wages.” CSX Corp., supra, at 1334–1335.\n   In at least partial response to the prospect of differential\ntreatment of SUBs based on the vagaries of state law, the\nIRS promulgated a series of Revenue Rulings in the 1950’s\nand 1960’s that took the position that SUB payments were\nnot “wages” under FICA as well as for purposes of income-\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

The Treasury Department suggested Congress\nauthorize the agency to promulgate regulations allowing\nvoluntary withholding. Statements and Recommenda-\ntions of the Department of the Treasury: Hearings on\nH. R. 13270 before the Senate Committee on Finance, 91st\nCong., 1st Sess., 905–906 (1969).\n   In 1969, Congress chose instead to address the with-\nholding problem by enacting §3402(o). It provides that all\nseverance payments—that is, both SUBs as well as sever-\nance payments that the IRS considered wages—shall be\n“treated as if ” they were wages for purposes of income-tax\nwithholding. It is apparent that the definition Congress\nadopted in §3402(o) is not limited to the SUBs that the\nIRS had deemed exempt from wages under FICA. See\n§3402(o)(2)(A). It must be presumed that Congress was\naware that §3402(o) covered more than the severance\npayments that were excluded from income-tax withhold-\ning. Not all severance payment plans were tied to state\nunemployment benefits; and, before §3402(o)’s 1969 en-\nactment, the IRS ruled that severance payments not\nlinked to state unemployment benefits were wages for\npurposes of income-tax withholding. See Rev. Rul. 65–\n251, 1965–2 Cum. Bull. 395; see also TAM 9416003 (the\nIRS’ original 1956 exception for SUBs provided “a limited\nexception from the definition of wages for . . . federal\nincome tax withholding . . . only if the payments are de-\n12        UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsigned to supplement the receipt of state unemployment\ncompensation and are actually tied to state unemployment\nbenefits”); ibid. (“SUB-pay plans must be designed to\nsupplement unemployment benefits . . .”).\n   Once this background is understood, the Court of Ap-\npeals’ interpretation of §3402(o) as standing for some\nbroad definitional principle is shown to be incorrect.\nAlthough Congress need not have agreed with the Reve-\nnue Rulings to enact §3402(o), its purpose to eliminate\nthe withholding problem caused by the differential treat-\nment of severance payments is the necessary background\nto understand the meaning and purpose of the provision.\nThe problem Congress sought to resolve was the prospect\nthat terminated employees would owe large payments in\ntaxes at the end of the year as a result of the IRS’ exemp-\ntion of certain SUBs from withholding. It remained possi-\nble that the IRS would determine that other forms of SUB\nplans, perhaps linked differently to state unemployment\nbenefits, should be exempt from withholding. If Congress\nhad only incorporated the Revenue Rulings already in\neffect, that response may have risked the withholding\nproblem arising once again. On the other hand, by draw-\ning a withholding requirement that was broader than\nthen-current IRS exemptions, Congress avoided these\npractical problems. A requirement that a form of remu-\nneration already included as wages be treated “as if ” it\nwere wages created no administrative difficulties.\n   The Court of Appeals understood Congress’ decision to\ninclude within §3402(o) a larger set of SUBs than was\nalready exempt from withholding under IRS Revenue\nRulings to mean that all SUBs were excluded from the\ndefinition of wages. But that assumption, although in the\nabstract not necessarily an illogical inference, is unsus-\ntainable, considering the regulatory background against\nwhich §3402(o) was enacted. Congress interpreted the\nRevenue Rulings not at all as a definitive gloss on the\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmeaning of the term “wages” in §3401. The better reading\nis that Congress determined that, whatever position the\nIRS took with respect to certain categories of severance\npayments, the problem with withholding should be solved\nby treating all severance payments as wages requiring\nwithholding.\n  The necessary conclusion is that §3402(o) does not nar-\nrow the term “wages” under FICA to exempt all severance\npayments. This reasoning is consistent with Rowan, a\nprevious decision interpreting FICA. In Rowan, the Court\nheld that Treasury Regulations interpreting “wages”un-\nder FICA to include the value of meals and lodging were\ninvalid. The Government conceded, for income-tax pur-\nposes, that the taxpayer in Rowan was correct to exempt\nthe value of the meals and lodging in computing the wages\nproperly withheld under §3402. 452 U. S., at 250–251.\nBut it argued, nevertheless, that the value of the meals\nand lodging was taxable as wages under FICA, pursuant\nto Treasury Regulations. The Rowan Court observed that\nthe definition of wages under FICA was in substance the\nsame as for purposes of withholding. Id., at 255. The\nCourt read that similarity to be “strong evidence that\nCongress intended ‘wages’ to mean the same thing under\nFICA . . . and income-tax withholding.” Ibid. To support\nthat conclusion, the Court noted a “congressional concern\nfor ‘the interest of simplicity and ease of administration.’ ”\nIbid. (quoting S. Rep. No. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 165\n(1942)). Because “Congress intended . . . to coordinate the\nincome-tax withholding system with FICA” in order “to\npromote simplicity and ease of administration,” the Court\nheld that it would be “extraordinary” for Congress to\nintend the definitions of “wages” to vary between FICA\nand income-tax withholding. 452 U. S., at 257.\n  The specific holding of Rowan—that regulations govern-\ning meals and lodging were invalid—has little or no\nbearing on the issue confronting us here. What is of im-\n14        UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nportance is the major principle recognized in Rowan: that\nsimplicity of administration and consistency of statutory\ninterpretation instruct that the meaning of “wages” should\nbe in general the same for income-tax withholding and for\nFICA calculations.\n  Quality Stores contends that, under the mandate of\n§3402(o), severance payments are not subject to FICA\ntaxation but are to be deemed wages for purposes of\nincome-tax withholding. It justifies this differential treat-\nment in the name of uniformity. But that so-called uni-\nformity as to the definitions of wages (i.e., that severance\npayments are not wages) is not consistent with the broad\ntextual definitions of wages under FICA and income-tax\nwithholding. Nor is it consistent with this Court’s holding\nthat administrative reasons justify treating severance\npayments as taxable for both FICA and income-tax pur-\nposes. To read Congress’ command to withhold severance\npayments as an implicit overruling of the broad definition\nof wages in FICA would disserve the statutory text and\nthe congressional interest in administrative simplicity\ndeemed controlling in Rowan.\n  In concluding, the Court notes that the IRS still pro-\nvides that severance payments tied to the receipt of state\nunemployment benefits are exempt not only from income-\ntax withholding but also from FICA taxation. See, e.g.,\nRev. Rul. 90–72, 1990–2 Cum. Bull. 211. Those Revenue\nRulings are not at issue here. Because the severance\npayments here were not linked to state unemployment\nbenefits, the Court does not reach the question whether\nthe IRS’ current exemption is consistent with the broad\ndefinition of wages under FICA.\n                      *    *    *\n  The severance payments here were made to employees\nterminated against their will, were varied based on job\nseniority and time served, and were not linked to the\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2657778/", "sha1": "f99d5335f112a250d464a6b4af7532a217e27604", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-031", "time_retrieved": "2014-03-25T07:21:50.004658"}
