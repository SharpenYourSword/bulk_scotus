STATIC \n\n            CONTROL COMPONENTS, INC.\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12\u2013873.      Argued December 3, 2013\u2014Decided March 25, 2014\nPetitioner Lexmark sells the only style of toner cartridges that work\n  with the company\u2019s laser printers, but \u201cremanufacturers\u201d acquire and\n  refurbish used Lexmark cartridges to sell in competition with\n  Lexmark\u2019s own new and refurbished ones. Lexmark\u2019s \u201cPrebate\u201d pro-\n  gram gives customers a discount on new cartridges if they agree to\n  return empty cartridges to the company. Each Prebate cartridge has\n  a microchip that disables the empty cartridge unless Lexmark re-\n  places the chip. Respondent Static Control, a maker and seller of\n  components for the remanufacture of Lexmark cartridges, developed\n  a microchip that mimicked Lexmark\u2019s. Lexmark sued for copyright\n  infringement, but Static Control counterclaimed, alleging that\n  Lexmark engaged in false or misleading advertising in violation of\n  \u00a743(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71125(a), and that its misrep-\n  resentations had caused Static Control lost sales and damage to its\n  business reputation. The District Court held that Static Control\n  lacked \u201cprudential standing\u201d to bring the Lanham Act claim, apply-\n  ing a multifactor balancing test the court attributed to Associated\n  Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519. In revers-\n  ing, the Sixth Circuit relied on the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201creasonable in-\n  terest\u201d test.\nHeld: Static Control has adequately pleaded the elements of a Lanham\n Act cause of action for false advertising. Pp. 6\u201322.\n    (a) The question here is whether Static Control falls within the\n class of plaintiffs that Congress authorized to sue under \u00a71125(a). To\n decide that question, this Court must determine the provision\u2019s\n meaning, using traditional principles of statutory interpretation. It\n is misleading to label this a \u201cprudential standing\u201d question. Lexmark\n2              LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL \n\n                       COMPONENTS, INC.                                     \n\n                              Syllabus\n\n\n    bases its \u201cprudential standing\u201d arguments on Associated General\n    Contractors, but that case rested on statutory considerations: The\n    Court sought to \u201cascertain,\u201d as a statutory-interpretation matter, the\n    \u201cscope of the private remedy created by\u201d Congress in \u00a74 of the Clay-\n    ton Act, and the \u201cclass of persons who [could] maintain a private\n    damages action under\u201d that legislatively conferred cause of action,\n    459 U. S., at 529, 532. And while this Court may have placed the\n    \u201czone of interests\u201d test that Static Control relies on under the \u201cpru-\n    dential\u201d rubric in the past, see, e.g., Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v.\n    Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 12, it does not belong there any more than As-\n    sociated General Contractors does. Rather, whether a plaintiff comes\n    within the zone of interests requires the Court to determine, using\n    traditional statutory-interpretation tools, whether a legislatively con-\n    ferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff \u2019s claim.\n    See, e. g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83,\n    97, and n. 2. Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (b) The \u00a71125(a) cause of action extends to plaintiffs who fall with-\n    in the zone of interests protected by that statute and whose injury\n    was proximately caused by a violation of that statute. Pp. 10\u201318.\n         (1) A statutory cause of action is presumed to extend only to\n    plaintiffs whose interests \u201cfall within the zone of interests protected\n    by the law invoked.\u201d Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751. \u201c[T]he\n    breadth of [that] zone . . . varies according to the provisions of law at\n    issue.\u201d Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 163. The Lanham Act in-\n    cludes a detailed statement of its purposes, including, as relevant\n    here, \u201cprotect[ing] persons engaged in [commerce within the control\n    of Congress] against unfair competition,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71127; and \u201cun-\n    fair competition\u201d was understood at common law to be concerned\n    with injuries to business reputation and present and future sales.\n    Thus, to come within the zone of interests in a \u00a71125(a) false-\n    advertising suit, a plaintiff must allege an injury to a commercial in-\n    terest in reputation or sales. Pp. 10\u201313.\n         (2) A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to\n    plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the\n    statute. See, e.g., Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corpora-\n    tion, 503 U. S. 258, 268\u2013270. This requirement generally bars suits\n    for alleged harm that is \u201ctoo remote\u201d from the defendant\u2019s unlawful\n    conduct, such as when the harm is purely derivative of \u201cmisfortunes\n    visited upon a third person by the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d Id., at 268\u2013269.\n    In a sense, all commercial injuries from false advertising are deriva-\n    tive of those suffered by consumers deceived by the advertising. But\n    since the Lanham Act authorizes suit only for commercial injuries,\n    the intervening consumer-deception step is not fatal to the proxi-\n    mate-cause showing the statute requires. Cf. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 656. Thus, a plaintiff suing under\n  \u00a71125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational inju-\n  ry flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant\u2019s ad-\n  vertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them\n  to withhold trade from the plaintiff. Pp. 13\u201315.\n       (3) Direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the proxi-\n  mate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue\n  under \u00a71125(a). These principles provide better guidance than the\n  multifactor balancing test urged by Lexmark, the direct-competitor\n  test, or the reasonable-interest test applied by the Sixth Circuit.\n  Pp. 15\u201318.\n    (c) Under these principles, Static Control comes within the class of\n  plaintiffs authorized to sue under \u00a71125(a). Its alleged injuries\u2014lost\n  sales and damage to its business reputation\u2014fall within the zone of\n  interests protected by the Act, and Static Control sufficiently alleged\n  that its injuries were proximately caused by Lexmark\u2019s misrepresen-\n  tations.

S. C. \u00a71125(a).\n                       I. Background\n  Lexmark manufactures and sells laser printers. It also\nsells toner cartridges for those printers (toner being the\npowdery ink that laser printers use to create images on\npaper). Lexmark designs its printers to work only with its\nown style of cartridges, and it therefore dominates the\nmarket for cartridges compatible with its printers. That\nmarket, however, is not devoid of competitors. Other\nbusinesses, called \u201cremanufacturers,\u201d acquire used Lex-\nmark toner cartridges, refurbish them, and sell them in\ncompetition with new and refurbished cartridges sold by\nLexmark.\n  Lexmark would prefer that its customers return their\nempty cartridges to it for refurbishment and resale, rather\nthan sell those cartridges to a remanufacturer.          So\nLexmark introduced what it called a \u201cPrebate\u201d program,\n2         LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL\n                  COMPONENTS, INC.                          \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwhich enabled customers to purchase new toner cartridges\nat a 20-percent discount if they would agree to return the\ncartridge to Lexmark once it was empty. Those terms\nwere communicated to consumers through notices printed\non the toner-cartridge boxes, which advised the consumer\nthat opening the box would indicate assent to the terms\u2014\na practice commonly known as \u201cshrinkwrap licensing,\u201d\nsee, e.g., ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 86 F. 3d 1447, 1449\n(CA7 1996). To enforce the Prebate terms, Lexmark in\u00ad\ncluded a microchip in each Prebate cartridge that would\ndisable the cartridge after it ran out of toner; for the car\u00ad\ntridge to be used again, the microchip would have to be\nreplaced by Lexmark.\n   Static Control is not itself a manufacturer or remanu\u00ad\nfacturer of toner cartridges. It is, rather, \u201cthe market\nleader [in] making and selling the components necessary\nto remanufacture Lexmark cartridges.\u201d 697 F. 3d 387, 396\n(CA6 2012) (case below). In addition to supplying remanu\u00ad\nfacturers with toner and various replacement parts, Static\nControl developed a microchip that could mimic the micro\u00ad\nchip in Lexmark\u2019s Prebate cartridges. By purchasing\nStatic Control\u2019s microchips and using them to replace the\nLexmark microchip, remanufacturers were able to refur\u00ad\nbish and resell used Prebate cartridges.\n   Lexmark did not take kindly to that development. In\n2002, it sued Static Control, alleging that Static Control\u2019s\nmicrochips violated both the Copyright Act of 1976, 17\nU. S. C. \u00a7101 et seq., and the Digital Millennium Copy\u00ad\nright Act, 17 U. S. C. \u00a71201 et seq. Static Control counter\u00ad\nclaimed, alleging, among other things, violations of \u00a743(a)\nof the Lanham Act, 60 Stat. 441, codified at 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71125(a). Section 1125(a) provides:\n      \u201c(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any\n    goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in\n    commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    any combination thereof, or any false designation of\n    origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false\n    or misleading representation of fact, which\u2014\n       \u201c(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake,\n    or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or asso\u00ad\n    ciation of such person with another person, or as to\n    the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her\n    goods, services, or commercial activities by another\n    person, or\n       \u201c(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, mis\u00ad\n    represents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geo\u00ad\n    graphic origin of his or her or another person\u2019s goods,\n    services, or commercial activities,\n    \u201cshall be liable in a civil action by any person who be\u00ad\n    lieves that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by\n    such act.\u201d\nSection 1125(a) thus creates two distinct bases of liability:\nfalse association, \u00a71125(a)(1)(A), and false advertising,\n\u00a71125(a)(1)(B). See Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 978 F. 2d\n1093, 1108 (CA9 1992). Static Control alleged only false\nadvertising.\n   As relevant to its Lanham Act claim, Static Control\nalleged two types of false or misleading conduct by\nLexmark. First, it alleged that through its Prebate pro\u00ad\ngram Lexmark \u201cpurposefully misleads end-users\u201d to be\u00ad\nlieve that they are legally bound by the Prebate terms and\nare thus required to return the Prebate-labeled cartridge\nto Lexmark after a single use. App. 31, \u00b639. Second, it\nalleged that upon introducing the Prebate program,\nLexmark \u201csent letters to most of the companies in the\ntoner cartridge remanufacturing business\u201d falsely advising\nthose companies that it was illegal to sell refurbished\nPrebate cartridges and, in particular, that it was illegal to\nuse Static Control\u2019s products to refurbish those cartridges.\nId., at 29, \u00b635. Static Control asserted that by those\n4           LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL\n                    COMPONENTS, INC.                                         \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nstatements, Lexmark had materially misrepresented \u201cthe\nnature, characteristics, and qualities\u201d of both its own\nproducts and Static Control\u2019s products. Id., at 43\u201344, \u00b685.\nIt further maintained that Lexmark\u2019s misrepresentations\nhad \u201cproximately caused and [we]re likely to cause injury\nto [Static Control] by diverting sales from [Static Control]\nto Lexmark,\u201d and had \u201csubstantially injured [its] business\nreputation\u201d by \u201cleading consumers and others in the trade\nto believe that [Static Control] is engaged in illegal con\u00ad\nduct.\u201d Id., at 44, \u00b688. Static Control sought treble dam\u00ad\nages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and injunctive relief.1\n  The District Court granted Lexmark\u2019s motion to dismiss\nStatic Control\u2019s Lanham Act claim. It held that Static\nControl lacked \u201cprudential standing\u201d to bring that claim,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 83, relying on a multifactor balanc\u00ad\ning test it attributed to Associated Gen. Contractors of\nCal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519 (1983). The court\nemphasized that there were \u201cmore direct plaintiffs in the\nform of remanufacturers of Lexmark\u2019s cartridges\u201d; that\nStatic Control\u2019s injury was \u201cremot[e]\u201d because it was a\nmere \u201cbyproduct of the supposed manipulation of consum\u00ad\ners\u2019 relationships with remanufacturers\u201d; and that\nLexmark\u2019s \u201calleged intent [was] to dry up spent cartridge\nsupplies at the remanufacturing level, rather than at\n[Static Control]\u2019s supply level, making remanufacturers\nLexmark\u2019s alleged intended target.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n83.\n  The Sixth Circuit reversed the dismissal of Static Con\u00ad\ntrol\u2019s Lanham Act claim. 697 F. 3d, at 423. Taking the\nlay of the land, it identified three competing approaches to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Lexmark contends that Static Control\u2019s allegations failed to describe\n\n\u201ccommercial advertising or promotion\u201d within the meaning of 15\nU. S. C. \u00a71125(a)(1)(B). That question is not before us, and we express\nno view on it. We assume without deciding that the communica\u00ad\ntions alleged by Static Control qualify as commercial advertising or\npromotion.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermining whether a plaintiff has standing to sue under\nthe Lanham Act. It observed that the Third, Fifth,\nEighth, and Eleventh Circuits all refer to \u201cantitrust stand\u00ad\ning or the [Associated General Contractors] factors in\ndeciding Lanham Act standing,\u201d as the District Court had\ndone. Id., at 410 (citing Conte Bros. Automotive, Inc. v.\nQuaker State-Slick 50, Inc., 165 F. 3d 221, 233\u2013234 (CA3\n1998); Procter & Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., 242 F. 3d\n539, 562\u2013563 (CA5 2001); Gilbert/Robinson, Inc. v. Carrie\nBeverage-Missouri, Inc., 989 F. 2d 985, 990\u2013991 (CA8\n1993); Phoenix of Broward, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., 489\nF. 3d 1156, 1162\u20131164 (CA11 2007)). By contrast, \u201c[t]he\nSeventh, Ninth, and Tenth [Circuits] use a categorical\ntest, permitting Lanham Act suits only by an actual com\u00ad\npetitor.\u201d 697 F. 3d, at 410 (citing L. S. Heath & Son, Inc.\nv. AT&T Information Systems, Inc., 9 F. 3d 561, 575 (CA7\n1993); Waits, supra, at 1108\u20131109; Stanfield v. Osborne\nIndustries, Inc., 52 F. 3d 867, 873 (CA10 1995)). And the\nSecond Circuit applies a \u201c \u2018reasonable interest\u2019 approach,\u201d\nunder which a Lanham Act plaintiff \u201chas standing if the\nclaimant can demonstrate \u2018(1) a reasonable interest to be\nprotected against the alleged false advertising and (2) a\nreasonable basis for believing that the interest is likely to\nbe damaged by the alleged false advertising.\u2019 \u201d 697 F. 3d,\nat 410 (quoting Famous Horse, Inc. v. 5th Avenue Photo\nInc., 624 F. 3d 106, 113 (CA2 2010)). The Sixth Circuit\napplied the Second Circuit\u2019s reasonable-interest test and\nconcluded that Static Control had standing because it\n\u201calleged a cognizable interest in its business reputation\nand sales to remanufacturers and sufficiently alleged that\nth[o]se interests were harmed by Lexmark\u2019s statements to\nthe remanufacturers that Static Control was engaging in\nillegal conduct.\u201d 697 F. 3d, at 411.\n   We granted certiorari to decide \u201cthe appropriate ana-\nlytical framework for determining a party\u2019s standing to\nmaintain an action for false advertising under the Lanham\n6           LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v.

Lexmark does not deny that Static Control\u2019s alle-\ngations of lost sales and damage to its business reputa-\ntion give it standing under Article III to press its false\u00ad\nadvertising claim, and we are satisfied that they do.\n   Although Static Control\u2019s claim thus presents a case or\ncontroversy that is properly within federal courts\u2019 Article\nIII jurisdiction, Lexmark urges that we should decline to\nadjudicate Static Control\u2019s claim on grounds that are\n\u201cprudential,\u201d rather than constitutional. That request is\nin some tension with our recent reaffirmation of the prin\u00ad\nciple that \u201ca federal court\u2019s \u2018obligation\u2019 to hear and decide\u201d\ncases within its jurisdiction \u201cis \u2018virtually unflagging.\u2019 \u201d\nSprint Communications, Inc. v.

Rather,\nwe sought to \u201cascertain,\u201d as a matter of statutory interpre\u00ad\ntation, the \u201cscope of the private remedy created by\u201d Con\u00ad\ngress in \u00a74 of the Clayton Act, and the \u201cclass of persons\nwho [could] maintain a private damages action under\u201d\nthat legislatively conferred cause of action. 459 U.

Later\ndecisions confirm that Associated General Contractors\nrested on statutory, not \u201cprudential,\u201d considerations. See,\ne.g., Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,\n503 U. S. 258, 265\u2013268 (1992) (relying on Associated Gen-\neral Contractors in finding a proximate-cause requirement\nin the cause of action created by the Racketeer Influenced\nand Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.

Although we admittedly have placed that\ntest under the \u201cprudential\u201d rubric in the past, see, e.g., Elk\nGrove, supra, at 12, it does not belong there any more than\nAssociated General Contractors does. Whether a plain-\ntiff comes within \u201cthe \u2018zone of interests\u2019 \u201d is an issue\nthat requires us to determine, using traditional tools of\nstatutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred\ncause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff \u2019s claim.\nSee Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S.\n83, 97, and n. 2 (1998); Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn.,\n479 U. S. 388, 394\u2013395 (1987); Holmes, supra, at 288\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). As Judge Silberman\nof the D. C. Circuit recently observed, \u201c \u2018prudential stand\u00ad\ning\u2019 is a misnomer\u201d as applied to the zone-of-interests\nanalysis, which asks whether \u201cthis particular class of\npersons ha[s] a right to sue under this substantive stat\u00ad\nute.\u201d Association of Battery Recyclers, Inc. v.

Take, for\nexample, our reluctance to entertain generalized grievances\u2014i.e., suits\n\u201cclaiming only harm to [the plaintiff \u2019s] and every citizen\u2019s interest in\nproper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that\nno more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at\nlarge.\u201d Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 573\u2013574 (1992).\nWhile we have at times grounded our reluctance to entertain such suits\nin the \u201ccounsels of prudence\u201d (albeit counsels \u201cclose[ly] relat[ed] to the\npolicies reflected in\u201d Article III), Valley Forge Christian College v.\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S.\n464, 475 (1982), we have since held that such suits do not present\nconstitutional \u201ccases\u201d or \u201ccontroversies.\u201d See, e.g., Lance v. Coffman,\n549 U.

The\nlimitations on third-party standing are harder to classify; we have\nobserved that third-party standing is \u201c \u2018closely related to the question\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

In other words, we\nask whether Static Control has a cause of action under the\nstatute.4 That question requires us to determine the\nmeaning of the congressionally enacted provision creating\na cause of action. In doing so, we apply traditional princi\u00ad\nples of statutory interpretation. We do not ask whether in\nour judgment Congress should have authorized Static\nControl\u2019s suit, but whether Congress in fact did so. Just\nas a court cannot apply its independent policy judgment to\nrecognize a cause of action that Congress has denied, see\nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286\u2013287 (2001), it\ncannot limit a cause of action that Congress has created\nmerely because \u201cprudence\u201d dictates.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwhether a person in the litigant\u2019s position will have a right of action on\nthe claim,\u2019 \u201d Department of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U. S. 715, 721, n. **\n(1990) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 500, n. 12 (1975)), but\nmost of our cases have not framed the inquiry in that way. See, e.g.,\nKowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U. S. 125, 128\u2013129 (2004) (suggesting it is an\nelement of \u201cprudential standing\u201d). This case does not present any issue\nof third-party standing, and consideration of that doctrine\u2019s proper\nplace in the standing firmament can await another day.\n  4 We have on occasion referred to this inquiry as \u201cstatutory standing\u201d\n\nand treated it as effectively jurisdictional. See, e.g., Steel Co. v. Citizens\nfor Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 97, and n. 2 (1998); cases cited\nid., at 114\u2013117 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). That label is an\nimprovement over the language of \u201cprudential standing,\u201d since it\ncorrectly places the focus on the statute. But it, too, is misleading,\nsince \u201cthe absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action\ndoes not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction, i.e., the court\u2019s statutory\nor constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\u2019 \u201d Verizon Md.

Static Control\u2019s Right To Sue Under \u00a71125(a)\n   Thus, this case presents a straightforward question of\nstatutory interpretation: Does the cause of action in\n\u00a71125(a) extend to plaintiffs like Static Control? The\nstatute authorizes suit by \u201cany person who believes that\nhe or she is likely to be damaged\u201d by a defendant\u2019s false\nadvertising. \u00a71125(a)(1). Read literally, that broad lan\u00ad\nguage might suggest that an action is available to anyone\nwho can satisfy the minimum requirements of Article III.\nNo party makes that argument, however, and the \u201cunlike\u00ad\nlihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured\nplaintiffs to recover persuades us that [\u00a71125(a)] should\nnot get such an expansive reading.\u201d Holmes, 503 U. S., at\n266 (footnote omitted). We reach that conclusion in light\nof two relevant background principles already mentioned:\nzone of interests and proximate causality.\n                     A. Zone of Interests\n   First, we presume that a statutory cause of action ex\u00ad\ntends only to plaintiffs whose interests \u201cfall within the\nzone of interests protected by the law invoked.\u201d Allen, 468\nU. S., at 751. The modern \u201czone of interests\u201d formulation\noriginated in Association of Data Processing Service Or-\nganizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150 (1970), as a limi\u00ad\ntation on the cause of action for judicial review conferred\nby the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). We have\nsince made clear, however, that it applies to all statutorily\ncreated causes of action; that it is a \u201crequirement of gen\u00ad\neral application\u201d; and that Congress is presumed to \u201clegis\u00ad\nlat[e] against the background of \u201d the zone-of-interests\nlimitation, \u201cwhich applies unless it is expressly negated.\u201d\nBennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 163 (1997); see also\nHolmes, supra, at 287\u2013288 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment). It is \u201cperhaps more accurat[e],\u201d though not\nvery different as a practical matter, to say that the limita\u00ad\ntion always applies and is never negated, but that our\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nanalysis of certain statutes will show that they protect a\nmore-than-usually \u201cexpan[sive]\u201d range of interests. Ben-\nnett, supra, at 164. The zone-of-interests test is therefore\nan appropriate tool for determining who may invoke the\ncause of action in \u00a71125(a).5\n   We have said, in the APA context, that the test is\nnot \u201c \u2018especially demanding,\u2019 \u201d Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\nBand of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U. S. ___,\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 15). In that context we have often\n\u201cconspicuously included the word \u2018arguably\u2019 in the test to\nindicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff,\u201d\nand have said that the test \u201cforecloses suit only when a\nplaintiff \u2019s \u2018interests are so marginally related to or incon\u00ad\nsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it\ncannot reasonably be assumed that\u2019 \u201d Congress authorized\nthat plaintiff to sue. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15\u201316). That\nlenient approach is an appropriate means of preserving\nthe flexibility of the APA\u2019s omnibus judicial-review provi\u00ad\nsion, which permits suit for violations of numerous stat\u00ad\nutes of varying character that do not themselves include\ncauses of action for judicial review. \u201cWe have made clear,\nhowever, that the breadth of the zone of interests varies\naccording to the provisions of law at issue, so that what\ncomes within the zone of interests of a statute for purposes\nof obtaining judicial review of administrative action under\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Although we announced the modern zone-of-interests test in 1971,\n\nits roots lie in the common-law rule that a plaintiff may not recover\nunder the law of negligence for injuries caused by violation of a statute\nunless the statute \u201cis interpreted as designed to protect the class of\npersons in which the plaintiff is included, against the risk of the type of\nharm which has in fact occurred as a result of its violation.\u201d W.

H. B. Halicki Productions v.\nUnited Artists Communications, Inc., 812 F. 2d 1213, 1214\n(CA9 1987). Section 45 of the Act, codified at 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71127, provides:\n     \u201cThe intent of this chapter is to regulate commerce\n     within the control of Congress by making actionable\n     the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such\n     commerce; to protect registered marks used in such\n     commerce from interference by State, or territorial\n     legislation; to protect persons engaged in such com\u00ad\n     merce against unfair competition; to prevent fraud\n     and deception in such commerce by the use of repro\u00ad\n     ductions, copies, counterfeits, or colorable imitations\n     of registered marks; and to provide rights and reme\u00ad\n     dies stipulated by treaties and conventions respect-\n     ing trademarks, trade names, and unfair competition\n     entered into between the United States and foreign\n     nations.\u201d\nMost of the enumerated purposes are relevant to false\u00ad\nassociation cases; a typical false-advertising case will\nimplicate only the Act\u2019s goal of \u201cprotect[ing] persons en\u00ad\ngaged in [commerce within the control of Congress]\nagainst unfair competition.\u201d Although \u201cunfair competi\u00ad\ntion\u201d was a \u201cplastic\u201d concept at common law, Ely-Norris\nSafe Co. v. Mosler Safe Co., 7 F. 2d 603, 604 (CA2 1925)\n(L. Hand, J.), it was understood to be concerned with\ninjuries to business reputation and present and future\nsales. See Rogers, Book Review, 39 Yale L.

A consumer who is hoodwinked into purchasing a\ndisappointing product may well have an injury-in-fact\ncognizable under Article III, but he cannot invoke the\nprotection of the Lanham Act\u2014a conclusion reached by\nevery Circuit to consider the question.

Even a business misled by a supplier into pur\u00ad\nchasing an inferior product is, like consumers generally,\nnot under the Act\u2019s aegis.\n                     B. Proximate Cause\n  Second, we generally presume that a statutory cause of\naction is limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proxi-\nmately caused by violations of the statute. For centuries, it\nhas been \u201ca well established principle of [the common] law,\nthat in all cases of loss, we are to attribute it to the proxi\u00ad\nmate cause, and not to any remote cause.\u201d Waters v.\nMerchants\u2019 Louisville Ins. Co., 11 Pet. 213, 223 (1837); see\nHolmes, 503 U. S., at 287 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\nment). That venerable principle reflects the reality that\n\u201cthe judicial remedy cannot encompass every conceivable\nharm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing.\u201d Associ-\nated Gen. Contractors, 459 U. S., at 536. Congress, we\nassume, is familiar with the common-law rule and does\nnot mean to displace it sub silentio. We have thus con\u00ad\nstrued federal causes of action in a variety of contexts to\n14        LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL\n                  COMPONENTS, INC.                          \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nincorporate a requirement of proximate causation. See,\ne.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336,\n346 (2005) (securities fraud); Holmes, supra, at 268\u2013270\n(RICO); Associated Gen. Contractors, supra, at 529\u2013535\n(Clayton Act). No party disputes that it is proper to read\n\u00a71125(a) as containing such a requirement, its broad\nlanguage notwithstanding.\n   The proximate-cause inquiry is not easy to define, and\nover the years it has taken various forms; but courts have\na great deal of experience applying it, and there is a\nwealth of precedent for them to draw upon in doing so.\nSee Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 838\u2013\n839 (1996); Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v. Valladolid,\n565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3). Proximate\u00ad\ncause analysis is controlled by the nature of the statutory\ncause of action. The question it presents is whether the\nharm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the\nconduct the statute prohibits.\n   Put differently, the proximate-cause requirement gener\u00ad\nally bars suits for alleged harm that is \u201ctoo remote\u201d from\nthe defendant\u2019s unlawful conduct. That is ordinarily the\ncase if the harm is purely derivative of \u201cmisfortunes visited\nupon a third person by the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d Holmes,\nsupra, at 268\u2013269; see, e.g., Hemi Group, LLC v. City of\nNew York, 559 U. S. 1, 10\u201311 (2010). In a sense, of course,\nall commercial injuries from false advertising are deriva\u00ad\ntive of those suffered by consumers who are deceived by\nthe advertising; but since the Lanham Act authorizes suit\nonly for commercial injuries, the intervening step of con\u00ad\nsumer deception is not fatal to the showing of proximate\ncausation required by the statute. See Harold H. Huggins\nRealty, Inc. v. FNC, Inc., 634 F. 3d 787, 800\u2013801 (CA5\n2011). That is consistent with our recognition that under\ncommon-law principles, a plaintiff can be directly injured\nby a misrepresentation even where \u201ca third party, and not\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe plaintiff, . . . relied on\u201d it. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &\nIndemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 656 (2008).\n   We thus hold that a plaintiff suing under \u00a71125(a)\nordinarily must show economic or reputational injury\nflowing directly from the deception wrought by the de\u00ad\nfendant\u2019s advertising; and that that occurs when deception\nof consumers causes them to withhold trade from the\nplaintiff. That showing is generally not made when the\ndeception produces injuries to a fellow commercial actor\nthat in turn affect the plaintiff. For example, while a\ncompetitor who is forced out of business by a defendant\u2019s\nfalse advertising generally will be able to sue for its losses,\nthe same is not true of the competitor\u2019s landlord, its elec\u00ad\ntric company, and other commercial parties who suffer\nmerely as a result of the competitor\u2019s \u201cinability to meet\n[its] financial obligations.\u201d Anza, 547 U. S., at 458.6\n                    C. Proposed Tests\n  At oral argument, Lexmark agreed that the zone of in-\nterests and proximate causation supply the relevant back\u00ad\nground limitations on suit under \u00a71125(a). See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 4\u20135, 11\u201312, 17\u201318. But it urges us to adopt, as\nthe optimal formulation of those principles, a multifactor\nbalancing test derived from Associated General Contrac-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Proximate causation is not a requirement of Article III standing,\n\nwhich requires only that the plaintiff \u2019s injury be fairly traceable to the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct. Like the zone-of-interests test, see supra, at 8\u20139,\nand nn. 3\u20134, it is an element of the cause of action under the statute,\nand so is subject to the rule that \u201cthe absence of a valid (as opposed to\narguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdic\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 89. But like any other element of a cause\nof action, it must be adequately alleged at the pleading stage in order\nfor the case to proceed. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 678\u2013679\n(2009). If a plaintiff \u2019s allegations, taken as true, are insufficient to\nestablish proximate causation, then the complaint must be dismissed; if\nthey are sufficient, then the plaintiff is entitled to an opportunity to\nprove them.\n16         LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL\n                   COMPONENTS, INC.                             \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntors. In the alternative, it asks that we adopt a categorical\ntest permitting only direct competitors to sue for false\nadvertising. And although neither party urges adoption of\nthe \u201creasonable interest\u201d test applied below, several amici\ndo so. While none of those tests is wholly without merit,\nwe decline to adopt any of them. We hold instead that a\ndirect application of the zone-of-interests test and the\nproximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits\non who may sue.\n  The balancing test Lexmark advocates was first articu\u00ad\nlated by the Third Circuit in Conte Bros. and later adopted\nby several other Circuits. Conte Bros. identified five rele\u00ad\nvant considerations:\n       \u201c(1) The nature of the plaintiff \u2019s alleged injury: Is\n     the injury of a type that Congress sought to redress in\n     providing a private remedy for violations of the [Lan\u00ad\n     ham Act]?\n       \u201c(2) The directness or indirectness of the asserted\n     injury.\n       \u201c(3) The proximity or remoteness of the party to the\n     alleged injurious conduct.\n       \u201c(4) The speculativeness of the damages claim.\n       \u201c(5) The risk of duplicative damages or complexity\n     in apportioning damages.\u201d 165 F. 3d, at 233 (citations\n     and internal quotation marks omitted).\nThis approach reflects a commendable effort to give con\u00ad\ntent to an otherwise nebulous inquiry, but we think it\nslightly off the mark. The first factor can be read as re\u00ad\nquiring that the plaintiff \u2019s injury be within the relevant\nzone of interests and the second and third as requiring\n(somewhat redundantly) proximate causation; but it is not\ncorrect to treat those requirements, which must be met in\nevery case, as mere factors to be weighed in a balance.\nAnd the fourth and fifth factors are themselves problem\u00ad\natic. \u201c[T]he difficulty that can arise when a court attempts\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto ascertain the damages caused by some remote action\u201d is\na \u201cmotivating principle\u201d behind the proximate-cause re\u00ad\nquirement, Anza, supra, at 457\u2013458; but potential diffi\u00ad\nculty in ascertaining and apportioning damages is not, as\nConte Bros. might suggest, an independent basis for deny\u00ad\ning standing where it is adequately alleged that a defend\u00ad\nant\u2019s conduct has proximately injured an interest of the\nplaintiff \u2019s that the statute protects. Even when a plaintiff\ncannot quantify its losses with sufficient certainty to re-\ncover damages, it may still be entitled to injunctive re-\nlief under \u00a71116(a) (assuming it can prove a likelihood of\nfuture injury) or disgorgement of the defendant\u2019s ill-gotten\nprofits under \u00a71117(a). See TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v.\nEdriver Inc., 653 F. 3d 820, 831 (CA9 2011); Johnson &\nJohnson v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 631 F. 2d 186, 190 (CA2\n1980). Finally, experience has shown that the Conte Bros.\napproach, like other open-ended balancing tests, can yield\nunpredictable and at times arbitrary results. See, e.g.,\nTushnet, Running the Gamut from A to B: Federal\nTrademark and False Advertising Law, 159 U. Pa. L. Rev.\n1305, 1376\u20131379 (2011).\n   In contrast to the multifactor balancing approach, the\ndirect-competitor test provides a bright-line rule; but it\ndoes so at the expense of distorting the statutory lan\u00ad\nguage. To be sure, a plaintiff who does not compete with\nthe defendant will often have a harder time establishing\nproximate causation. But a rule categorically prohibiting\nall suits by noncompetitors would read too much into the\nAct\u2019s reference to \u201cunfair competition\u201d in \u00a71127. By the\ntime the Lanham Act was adopted, the common-law tort of\nunfair competition was understood not to be limited to\nactions between competitors. One leading authority in the\nfield wrote that \u201cthere need be no competition in unfair\ncompetition,\u201d just as \u201c[t]here is no soda in soda water, no\ngrapes in grape fruit, no bread in bread fruit, and a clothes\nhorse is not a horse but is good enough to hang things\n18        LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL \n\n                  COMPONENTS, INC.                            \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\non.\u201d Rogers, 39 Yale L. J., at 299; accord, Vogue Co. v.\nThompson-Hudson Co., 300 F. 509, 512 (CA6 1924); 1 H.\nNims, The Law of Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks,\np. vi (4th ed. 1947); 2 id., at 1194\u20131205. It is thus a mis\u00ad\ntake to infer that because the Lanham Act treats false\nadvertising as a form of unfair competition, it can protect\nonly the false-advertiser\u2019s direct competitors.\n    Finally, there is the \u201creasonable interest\u201d test applied by\nthe Sixth Circuit in this case. As typically formulated,\nit requires a commercial plaintiff to \u201cdemonstrate \u2018(1) a\nreasonable interest to be protected against the alleged\nfalse advertising and (2) a reasonable basis for believing\nthat the interest is likely to be damaged by the alleged\nfalse advertising.\u2019 \u201d 697 F. 3d, at 410 (quoting Famous\nHorse, 624 F. 3d, at 113). A purely practical objection to\nthe test is that it lends itself to widely divergent appli-\ncation. Indeed, its vague language can be understood as\nrequiring only the bare minimum of Article III standing.\nThe popularity of the multifactor balancing test reflects its\nappeal to courts tired of \u201cgrappl[ing] with defining\u201d the\n\u201c \u2018reasonable interest\u2019 \u201d test \u201cwith greater precision.\u201d Conte\nBros., 165 F. 3d, at 231. The theoretical difficulties with\nthe test are even more substantial: The relevant question\nis not whether the plaintiff \u2019s interest is \u201creasonable,\u201d but\nwhether it is one the Lanham Act protects; and not\nwhether there is a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for the plaintiff \u2019s\nclaim of harm, but whether the harm alleged is proximately\ntied to the defendant\u2019s conduct. In short, we think the\nprinciples set forth above will provide clearer and more\naccurate guidance than the \u201creasonable interest\u201d test.\n                       IV. Application\n  Applying those principles to Static Control\u2019s false\u00ad\nadvertising claim, we conclude that Static Control comes\nwithin the class of plaintiffs whom Congress authorized to\nsue under \u00a71125(a).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   To begin, Static Control\u2019s alleged injuries\u2014lost sales\nand damage to its business reputation\u2014are injuries to\nprecisely the sorts of commercial interests the Act pro\u00ad\ntects. Static Control is suing not as a deceived consumer,\nbut as a \u201cperso[n] engaged in\u201d \u201ccommerce within the con\u00ad\ntrol of Congress\u201d whose position in the marketplace has\nbeen damaged by Lexmark\u2019s false advertising. \u00a71127.\nThere is no doubt that it is within the zone of interests\nprotected by the statute.\n   Static Control also sufficiently alleged that its injuries\nwere proximately caused by Lexmark\u2019s misrepresenta\u00ad\ntions. This case, it is true, does not present the \u201cclassic\nLanham Act false-advertising claim\u201d in which \u201c \u2018one com\u00ad\npetito[r] directly injur[es] another by making false state\u00ad\nments about his own goods [or the competitor\u2019s goods] and\nthus inducing customers to switch.\u2019 \u201d Harold H. Huggins\nRealty, 634 F. 3d, at 799, n. 24. But although diversion of\nsales to a direct competitor may be the paradigmatic direct\ninjury from false advertising, it is not the only type of\ninjury cognizable under \u00a71125(a). For at least two rea\u00ad\nsons, Static Control\u2019s allegations satisfy the requirement\nof proximate causation.\n   First, Static Control alleged that Lexmark disparaged\nits business and products by asserting that Static Con\u00ad\ntrol\u2019s business was illegal. See 697 F. 3d, at 411, n. 10\n(noting allegation that Lexmark \u201cdirectly target[ed] Static\nControl\u201d when it \u201cfalsely advertised that Static Control\ninfringed Lexmark\u2019s patents\u201d). When a defendant harms\na plaintiff \u2019s reputation by casting aspersions on its busi\u00ad\nness, the plaintiff \u2019s injury flows directly from the audi\u00ad\nence\u2019s belief in the disparaging statements. Courts have\ntherefore afforded relief under \u00a71125(a) not only where a\ndefendant denigrates a plaintiff \u2019s product by name, see,\ne.g., McNeilab, Inc. v. American Home Prods. Corp., 848\nF. 2d 34, 38 (CA2 1988), but also where the defendant\ndamages the product\u2019s reputation by, for example, equat\u00ad\n20          LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL\n                    COMPONENTS, INC.\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning it with an inferior product, see, e.g., Camel Hair and\nCashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry Goods Corp.,\n799 F. 2d 6, 7\u20138, 11\u201312 (CA1 1986); PPX Enterprises, Inc.\nv. Audiofidelity, Inc., 746 F. 2d 120, 122, 125 (CA2 1984).\nTraditional proximate-causation principles support those\nresults: As we have observed, a defendant who \u201c \u2018seeks to\npromote his own interests by telling a known falsehood to\nor about the plaintiff or his product\u2019 \u201d may be said to have\nproximately caused the plaintiff \u2019s harm. Bridge, 553\nU. S., at 657 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7870,\nComment h (1977); emphasis added in Bridge).\n   The District Court emphasized that Lexmark and Static\nControl are not direct competitors. But when a party\nclaims reputational injury from disparagement, competi\u00ad\ntion is not required for proximate cause; and that is true\neven if the defendant\u2019s aim was to harm its immediate\ncompetitors, and the plaintiff merely suffered collateral\ndamage. Consider two rival carmakers who purchase\nairbags for their cars from different third-party manufac\u00ad\nturers. If the first carmaker, hoping to divert sales from\nthe second, falsely proclaims that the airbags used by the\nsecond carmaker are defective, both the second carmaker\nand its airbag supplier may suffer reputational injury, and\ntheir sales may decline as a result. In those circumstances,\nthere is no reason to regard either party\u2019s injury as de-\nrivative of the other\u2019s; each is directly and independently\nharmed by the attack on its merchandise.\n   In addition, Static Control adequately alleged proximate\ncausation by alleging that it designed, manufactured, and\nsold microchips that both (1) were necessary for, and\n(2) had no other use than, refurbishing Lexmark toner\ncartridges. See App. 13, \u00b631; id., at 37, \u00b654.7 It follows\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 We understand this to be the thrust of both sides\u2019 allegations con\u00ad\n\ncerning Static Control\u2019s design and sale of specialized microchips for\nthe specific purpose of enabling the remanufacture of Lexmark\u2019s\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)       21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom that allegation that any false advertising that re\u00ad\nduced the remanufacturers\u2019 business necessarily injured\nStatic Control as well. Taking Static Control\u2019s assertions\nat face value, there is likely to be something very close to a\n1:1 relationship between the number of refurbished Pre\u00ad\nbate cartridges sold (or not sold) by the remanufacturers\nand the number of Prebate microchips sold (or not sold) by\nStatic Control. \u201cWhere the injury alleged is so integral an\naspect of the [violation] alleged, there can be no question\u201d\nthat proximate cause is satisfied. Blue Shield of Va. v.\nMcCready, 457 U. S. 465, 479 (1982).\n   To be sure, on this view, the causal chain linking Static\nControl\u2019s injuries to consumer confusion is not direct, but\nincludes the intervening link of injury to the remanufac\u00ad\nturers. Static Control\u2019s allegations therefore might not\nsupport standing under a strict application of the \u201c \u2018 \u201cgen\u00ad\neral tendency\u201d \u2019 \u201d not to stretch proximate causation \u201c \u2018 \u201cbe\u00ad\nyond the first step.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Holmes, 503 U. S., at 271. But the\nreason for that general tendency is that there ordinarily is\na \u201cdiscontinuity\u201d between the injury to the direct victim\nand the injury to the indirect victim, so that the latter\nis not surely attributable to the former (and thus also to\nthe defendant\u2019s conduct), but might instead have resulted\nfrom \u201cany number of [other] reasons.\u201d Anza, 547 U. S., at\n458\u2013459. That is not the case here. Static Control\u2019s alle\u00ad\ngations suggest that if the remanufacturers sold 10,000\nfewer refurbished cartridges because of Lexmark\u2019s false\nadvertising, then it would follow more or less automatically\nthat Static Control sold 10,000 fewer microchips for the\nsame reason, without the need for any \u201cspeculative . . .\nproceedings\u201d or \u201cintricate, uncertain inquiries.\u201d Id., at\n459\u2013460. In these relatively unique circumstances, the\nremanufacturers are not \u201cmore immediate victim[s]\u201d than\nStatic Control.

Argued December 3, 2013\u2014Decided March 25, 2014\nPetitioner Lexmark sells the only style of toner cartridges that work\n  with the company\u2019s laser printers, but \u201cremanufacturers\u201d acquire and\n  refurbish used Lexmark cartridges to sell in competition with\n  Lexmark\u2019s own new and refurbished ones. Lexmark\u2019s \u201cPrebate\u201d pro-\n  gram gives customers a discount on new cartridges if they agree to\n  return empty cartridges to the company. Each Prebate cartridge has\n  a microchip that disables the empty cartridge unless Lexmark re-\n  places the chip. Respondent Static Control, a maker and seller of\n  components for the remanufacture of Lexmark cartridges, developed\n  a microchip that mimicked Lexmark\u2019s. Lexmark sued for copyright\n  infringement, but Static Control counterclaimed, alleging that\n  Lexmark engaged in false or misleading advertising in violation of\n  \u00a743(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71125(a), and that its misrep-\n  resentations had caused Static Control lost sales and damage to its\n  business reputation. The District Court held that Static Control\n  lacked \u201cprudential standing\u201d to bring the Lanham Act claim, apply-\n  ing a multifactor balancing test the court attributed to Associated\n  Gen.

Pp. 6\u201322.\n    (a) The question here is whether Static Control falls within the\n class of plaintiffs that Congress authorized to sue under \u00a71125(a). To\n decide that question, this Court must determine the provision\u2019s\n meaning, using traditional principles of statutory interpretation. It\n is misleading to label this a \u201cprudential standing\u201d question. Lexmark\n2              LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL \n\n                       COMPONENTS, INC.                                     \n\n                              Syllabus\n\n\n    bases its \u201cprudential standing\u201d arguments on Associated General\n    Contractors, but that case rested on statutory considerations: The\n    Court sought to \u201cascertain,\u201d as a statutory-interpretation matter, the\n    \u201cscope of the private remedy created by\u201d Congress in \u00a74 of the Clay-\n    ton Act, and the \u201cclass of persons who [could] maintain a private\n    damages action under\u201d that legislatively conferred cause of action,\n    459 U. S., at 529, 532. And while this Court may have placed the\n    \u201czone of interests\u201d test that Static Control relies on under the \u201cpru-\n    dential\u201d rubric in the past, see, e.g., Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v.\n    Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 12, it does not belong there any more than As-\n    sociated General Contractors does. Rather, whether a plaintiff comes\n    within the zone of interests requires the Court to determine, using\n    traditional statutory-interpretation tools, whether a legislatively con-\n    ferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff \u2019s claim.\n    See, e. g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83,\n    97, and n. 2. Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (b) The \u00a71125(a) cause of action extends to plaintiffs who fall with-\n    in the zone of interests protected by that statute and whose injury\n    was proximately caused by a violation of that statute. Pp. 10\u201318.\n         (1) A statutory cause of action is presumed to extend only to\n    plaintiffs whose interests \u201cfall within the zone of interests protected\n    by the law invoked.\u201d Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751. \u201c[T]he\n    breadth of [that] zone . . . varies according to the provisions of law at\n    issue.\u201d Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 163. The Lanham Act in-\n    cludes a detailed statement of its purposes, including, as relevant\n    here, \u201cprotect[ing] persons engaged in [commerce within the control\n    of Congress] against unfair competition,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71127; and \u201cun-\n    fair competition\u201d was understood at common law to be concerned\n    with injuries to business reputation and present and future sales.\n    Thus, to come within the zone of interests in a \u00a71125(a) false-\n    advertising suit, a plaintiff must allege an injury to a commercial in-\n    terest in reputation or sales. Pp. 10\u201313.\n         (2) A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to\n    plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the\n    statute.

This requirement generally bars suits\n    for alleged harm that is \u201ctoo remote\u201d from the defendant\u2019s unlawful\n    conduct, such as when the harm is purely derivative of \u201cmisfortunes\n    visited upon a third person by the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d Id., at 268\u2013269.\n    In a sense, all commercial injuries from false advertising are deriva-\n    tive of those suffered by consumers deceived by the advertising. But\n    since the Lanham Act authorizes suit only for commercial injuries,\n    the intervening consumer-deception step is not fatal to the proxi-\n    mate-cause showing the statute requires. Cf. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 656. Thus, a plaintiff suing under\n  \u00a71125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational inju-\n  ry flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant\u2019s ad-\n  vertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them\n  to withhold trade from the plaintiff. Pp. 13\u201315.\n       (3) Direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the proxi-\n  mate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue\n  under \u00a71125(a). These principles provide better guidance than the\n  multifactor balancing test urged by Lexmark, the direct-competitor\n  test, or the reasonable-interest test applied by the Sixth Circuit.\n  Pp. 15\u201318.\n    (c) Under these principles, Static Control comes within the class of\n  plaintiffs authorized to sue under \u00a71125(a). Its alleged injuries\u2014lost\n  sales and damage to its business reputation\u2014fall within the zone of\n  interests protected by the Act, and Static Control sufficiently alleged\n  that its injuries were proximately caused by Lexmark\u2019s misrepresen-\n  tations.

S. C. \u00a71125(a).\n                       I. Background\n  Lexmark manufactures and sells laser printers. It also\nsells toner cartridges for those printers (toner being the\npowdery ink that laser printers use to create images on\npaper). Lexmark designs its printers to work only with its\nown style of cartridges, and it therefore dominates the\nmarket for cartridges compatible with its printers. That\nmarket, however, is not devoid of competitors. Other\nbusinesses, called \u201cremanufacturers,\u201d acquire used Lex-\nmark toner cartridges, refurbish them, and sell them in\ncompetition with new and refurbished cartridges sold by\nLexmark.\n  Lexmark would prefer that its customers return their\nempty cartridges to it for refurbishment and resale, rather\nthan sell those cartridges to a remanufacturer.          So\nLexmark introduced what it called a \u201cPrebate\u201d program,\n2         LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL\n                  COMPONENTS, INC.                          \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwhich enabled customers to purchase new toner cartridges\nat a 20-percent discount if they would agree to return the\ncartridge to Lexmark once it was empty. Those terms\nwere communicated to consumers through notices printed\non the toner-cartridge boxes, which advised the consumer\nthat opening the box would indicate assent to the terms\u2014\na practice commonly known as \u201cshrinkwrap licensing,\u201d\nsee, e.g., ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 86 F. 3d 1447, 1449\n(CA7 1996). To enforce the Prebate terms, Lexmark in\u00ad\ncluded a microchip in each Prebate cartridge that would\ndisable the cartridge after it ran out of toner; for the car\u00ad\ntridge to be used again, the microchip would have to be\nreplaced by Lexmark.\n   Static Control is not itself a manufacturer or remanu\u00ad\nfacturer of toner cartridges. It is, rather, \u201cthe market\nleader [in] making and selling the components necessary\nto remanufacture Lexmark cartridges.\u201d 697 F. 3d 387, 396\n(CA6 2012) (case below). In addition to supplying remanu\u00ad\nfacturers with toner and various replacement parts, Static\nControl developed a microchip that could mimic the micro\u00ad\nchip in Lexmark\u2019s Prebate cartridges. By purchasing\nStatic Control\u2019s microchips and using them to replace the\nLexmark microchip, remanufacturers were able to refur\u00ad\nbish and resell used Prebate cartridges.\n   Lexmark did not take kindly to that development. In\n2002, it sued Static Control, alleging that Static Control\u2019s\nmicrochips violated both the Copyright Act of 1976, 17\nU. S. C. \u00a7101 et seq., and the Digital Millennium Copy\u00ad\nright Act, 17 U. S. C. \u00a71201 et seq. Static Control counter\u00ad\nclaimed, alleging, among other things, violations of \u00a743(a)\nof the Lanham Act, 60 Stat. 441, codified at 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71125(a). Section 1125(a) provides:\n      \u201c(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any\n    goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in\n    commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    any combination thereof, or any false designation of\n    origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false\n    or misleading representation of fact, which\u2014\n       \u201c(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake,\n    or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or asso\u00ad\n    ciation of such person with another person, or as to\n    the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her\n    goods, services, or commercial activities by another\n    person, or\n       \u201c(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, mis\u00ad\n    represents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geo\u00ad\n    graphic origin of his or her or another person\u2019s goods,\n    services, or commercial activities,\n    \u201cshall be liable in a civil action by any person who be\u00ad\n    lieves that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by\n    such act.\u201d\nSection 1125(a) thus creates two distinct bases of liability:\nfalse association, \u00a71125(a)(1)(A), and false advertising,\n\u00a71125(a)(1)(B). See Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 978 F. 2d\n1093, 1108 (CA9 1992). Static Control alleged only false\nadvertising.\n   As relevant to its Lanham Act claim, Static Control\nalleged two types of false or misleading conduct by\nLexmark. First, it alleged that through its Prebate pro\u00ad\ngram Lexmark \u201cpurposefully misleads end-users\u201d to be\u00ad\nlieve that they are legally bound by the Prebate terms and\nare thus required to return the Prebate-labeled cartridge\nto Lexmark after a single use. App. 31, \u00b639. Second, it\nalleged that upon introducing the Prebate program,\nLexmark \u201csent letters to most of the companies in the\ntoner cartridge remanufacturing business\u201d falsely advising\nthose companies that it was illegal to sell refurbished\nPrebate cartridges and, in particular, that it was illegal to\nuse Static Control\u2019s products to refurbish those cartridges.\nId., at 29, \u00b635. Static Control asserted that by those\n4           LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v.

Id., at 43\u201344, \u00b685.\nIt further maintained that Lexmark\u2019s misrepresentations\nhad \u201cproximately caused and [we]re likely to cause injury\nto [Static Control] by diverting sales from [Static Control]\nto Lexmark,\u201d and had \u201csubstantially injured [its] business\nreputation\u201d by \u201cleading consumers and others in the trade\nto believe that [Static Control] is engaged in illegal con\u00ad\nduct.\u201d Id., at 44, \u00b688. Static Control sought treble dam\u00ad\nages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and injunctive relief.1\n  The District Court granted Lexmark\u2019s motion to dismiss\nStatic Control\u2019s Lanham Act claim. It held that Static\nControl lacked \u201cprudential standing\u201d to bring that claim,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 83, relying on a multifactor balanc\u00ad\ning test it attributed to Associated Gen. Contractors of\nCal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519 (1983). The court\nemphasized that there were \u201cmore direct plaintiffs in the\nform of remanufacturers of Lexmark\u2019s cartridges\u201d; that\nStatic Control\u2019s injury was \u201cremot[e]\u201d because it was a\nmere \u201cbyproduct of the supposed manipulation of consum\u00ad\ners\u2019 relationships with remanufacturers\u201d; and that\nLexmark\u2019s \u201calleged intent [was] to dry up spent cartridge\nsupplies at the remanufacturing level, rather than at\n[Static Control]\u2019s supply level, making remanufacturers\nLexmark\u2019s alleged intended target.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n83.\n  The Sixth Circuit reversed the dismissal of Static Con\u00ad\ntrol\u2019s Lanham Act claim. 697 F. 3d, at 423. Taking the\nlay of the land, it identified three competing approaches to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Lexmark contends that Static Control\u2019s allegations failed to describe\n\n\u201ccommercial advertising or promotion\u201d within the meaning of 15\nU. S. C. \u00a71125(a)(1)(B). That question is not before us, and we express\nno view on it. We assume without deciding that the communica\u00ad\ntions alleged by Static Control qualify as commercial advertising or\npromotion.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

It observed that the Third, Fifth,\nEighth, and Eleventh Circuits all refer to \u201cantitrust stand\u00ad\ning or the [Associated General Contractors] factors in\ndeciding Lanham Act standing,\u201d as the District Court had\ndone. Id., at 410 (citing Conte Bros. Automotive, Inc. v.\nQuaker State-Slick 50, Inc., 165 F. 3d 221, 233\u2013234 (CA3\n1998); Procter & Gamble Co. v.

McDonald\u2019s Corp., 489\nF. 3d 1156, 1162\u20131164 (CA11 2007)). By contrast, \u201c[t]he\nSeventh, Ninth, and Tenth [Circuits] use a categorical\ntest, permitting Lanham Act suits only by an actual com\u00ad\npetitor.\u201d 697 F. 3d, at 410 (citing L. S.

And the\nSecond Circuit applies a \u201c \u2018reasonable interest\u2019 approach,\u201d\nunder which a Lanham Act plaintiff \u201chas standing if the\nclaimant can demonstrate \u2018(1) a reasonable interest to be\nprotected against the alleged false advertising and (2) a\nreasonable basis for believing that the interest is likely to\nbe damaged by the alleged false advertising.\u2019 \u201d 697 F. 3d,\nat 410 (quoting Famous Horse, Inc. v. 5th Avenue Photo\nInc., 624 F. 3d 106, 113 (CA2 2010)). The Sixth Circuit\napplied the Second Circuit\u2019s reasonable-interest test and\nconcluded that Static Control had standing because it\n\u201calleged a cognizable interest in its business reputation\nand sales to remanufacturers and sufficiently alleged that\nth[o]se interests were harmed by Lexmark\u2019s statements to\nthe remanufacturers that Static Control was engaging in\nillegal conduct.\u201d 697 F. 3d, at 411.\n   We granted certiorari to decide \u201cthe appropriate ana-\nlytical framework for determining a party\u2019s standing to\nmaintain an action for false advertising under the Lanham\n6           LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v.

Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992). The\nplaintiff must have suffered or be imminently threatened\nwith a concrete and particularized \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is\nfairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant\nand likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\nIbid. Lexmark does not deny that Static Control\u2019s alle-\ngations of lost sales and damage to its business reputa-\ntion give it standing under Article III to press its false\u00ad\nadvertising claim, and we are satisfied that they do.\n   Although Static Control\u2019s claim thus presents a case or\ncontroversy that is properly within federal courts\u2019 Article\nIII jurisdiction, Lexmark urges that we should decline to\nadjudicate Static Control\u2019s claim on grounds that are\n\u201cprudential,\u201d rather than constitutional. That request is\nin some tension with our recent reaffirmation of the prin\u00ad\nciple that \u201ca federal court\u2019s \u2018obligation\u2019 to hear and decide\u201d\ncases within its jurisdiction \u201cis \u2018virtually unflagging.\u2019 \u201d\nSprint Communications, Inc. v.

Newdow,\n542 U. S. 1, 12 (2004) (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.

Rather,\nwe sought to \u201cascertain,\u201d as a matter of statutory interpre\u00ad\ntation, the \u201cscope of the private remedy created by\u201d Con\u00ad\ngress in \u00a74 of the Clayton Act, and the \u201cclass of persons\nwho [could] maintain a private damages action under\u201d\nthat legislatively conferred cause of action. 459 U. S., at\n529, 532. We held that the statute limited the class to\nplaintiffs whose injuries were proximately caused by a\ndefendant\u2019s antitrust violations. Id., at 532\u2013533. Later\ndecisions confirm that Associated General Contractors\nrested on statutory, not \u201cprudential,\u201d considerations. See,\ne.g., Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,\n503 U. S. 258, 265\u2013268 (1992) (relying on Associated Gen-\neral Contractors in finding a proximate-cause requirement\nin the cause of action created by the Racketeer Influenced\nand Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.

Although we admittedly have placed that\ntest under the \u201cprudential\u201d rubric in the past, see, e.g., Elk\nGrove, supra, at 12, it does not belong there any more than\nAssociated General Contractors does. Whether a plain-\ntiff comes within \u201cthe \u2018zone of interests\u2019 \u201d is an issue\nthat requires us to determine, using traditional tools of\nstatutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred\ncause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff \u2019s claim.\nSee Steel Co. v.

Circuit recently observed, \u201c \u2018prudential stand\u00ad\ning\u2019 is a misnomer\u201d as applied to the zone-of-interests\nanalysis, which asks whether \u201cthis particular class of\npersons ha[s] a right to sue under this substantive stat\u00ad\nute.\u201d Association of Battery Recyclers, Inc. v.

In other words, we\nask whether Static Control has a cause of action under the\nstatute.4 That question requires us to determine the\nmeaning of the congressionally enacted provision creating\na cause of action. In doing so, we apply traditional princi\u00ad\nples of statutory interpretation. We do not ask whether in\nour judgment Congress should have authorized Static\nControl\u2019s suit, but whether Congress in fact did so. Just\nas a court cannot apply its independent policy judgment to\nrecognize a cause of action that Congress has denied, see\nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286\u2013287 (2001), it\ncannot limit a cause of action that Congress has created\nmerely because \u201cprudence\u201d dictates.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwhether a person in the litigant\u2019s position will have a right of action on\nthe claim,\u2019 \u201d Department of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U. S. 715, 721, n. **\n(1990) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 500, n. 12 (1975)), but\nmost of our cases have not framed the inquiry in that way. See, e.g.,\nKowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U. S. 125, 128\u2013129 (2004) (suggesting it is an\nelement of \u201cprudential standing\u201d). This case does not present any issue\nof third-party standing, and consideration of that doctrine\u2019s proper\nplace in the standing firmament can await another day.\n  4 We have on occasion referred to this inquiry as \u201cstatutory standing\u201d\n\nand treated it as effectively jurisdictional. See, e.g., Steel Co. v. Citizens\nfor Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 97, and n. 2 (1998); cases cited\nid., at 114\u2013117 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). That label is an\nimprovement over the language of \u201cprudential standing,\u201d since it\ncorrectly places the focus on the statute. But it, too, is misleading,\nsince \u201cthe absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action\ndoes not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction, i.e., the court\u2019s statutory\nor constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\u2019 \u201d Verizon Md. Inc. v.\nPublic Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642\u2013643 (2002) (quoting\nSteel Co., supra, at 89); see also Grocery Mfrs. Assn. v.

Static Control\u2019s Right To Sue Under \u00a71125(a)\n   Thus, this case presents a straightforward question of\nstatutory interpretation: Does the cause of action in\n\u00a71125(a) extend to plaintiffs like Static Control? The\nstatute authorizes suit by \u201cany person who believes that\nhe or she is likely to be damaged\u201d by a defendant\u2019s false\nadvertising. \u00a71125(a)(1). Read literally, that broad lan\u00ad\nguage might suggest that an action is available to anyone\nwho can satisfy the minimum requirements of Article III.\nNo party makes that argument, however, and the \u201cunlike\u00ad\nlihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured\nplaintiffs to recover persuades us that [\u00a71125(a)] should\nnot get such an expansive reading.\u201d Holmes, 503 U. S., at\n266 (footnote omitted). We reach that conclusion in light\nof two relevant background principles already mentioned:\nzone of interests and proximate causality.\n                     A. Zone of Interests\n   First, we presume that a statutory cause of action ex\u00ad\ntends only to plaintiffs whose interests \u201cfall within the\nzone of interests protected by the law invoked.\u201d Allen, 468\nU. S., at 751. The modern \u201czone of interests\u201d formulation\noriginated in Association of Data Processing Service Or-\nganizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150 (1970), as a limi\u00ad\ntation on the cause of action for judicial review conferred\nby the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). We have\nsince made clear, however, that it applies to all statutorily\ncreated causes of action; that it is a \u201crequirement of gen\u00ad\neral application\u201d; and that Congress is presumed to \u201clegis\u00ad\nlat[e] against the background of \u201d the zone-of-interests\nlimitation, \u201cwhich applies unless it is expressly negated.\u201d\nBennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 163 (1997); see also\nHolmes, supra, at 287\u2013288 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment). It is \u201cperhaps more accurat[e],\u201d though not\nvery different as a practical matter, to say that the limita\u00ad\ntion always applies and is never negated, but that our\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

Ben-\nnett, supra, at 164. The zone-of-interests test is therefore\nan appropriate tool for determining who may invoke the\ncause of action in \u00a71125(a).5\n   We have said, in the APA context, that the test is\nnot \u201c \u2018especially demanding,\u2019 \u201d Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\nBand of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U. S. ___,\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 15). In that context we have often\n\u201cconspicuously included the word \u2018arguably\u2019 in the test to\nindicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff,\u201d\nand have said that the test \u201cforecloses suit only when a\nplaintiff \u2019s \u2018interests are so marginally related to or incon\u00ad\nsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it\ncannot reasonably be assumed that\u2019 \u201d Congress authorized\nthat plaintiff to sue. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15\u201316). That\nlenient approach is an appropriate means of preserving\nthe flexibility of the APA\u2019s omnibus judicial-review provi\u00ad\nsion, which permits suit for violations of numerous stat\u00ad\nutes of varying character that do not themselves include\ncauses of action for judicial review. \u201cWe have made clear,\nhowever, that the breadth of the zone of interests varies\naccording to the provisions of law at issue, so that what\ncomes within the zone of interests of a statute for purposes\nof obtaining judicial review of administrative action under\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Although we announced the modern zone-of-interests test in 1971,\n\nits roots lie in the common-law rule that a plaintiff may not recover\nunder the law of negligence for injuries caused by violation of a statute\nunless the statute \u201cis interpreted as designed to protect the class of\npersons in which the plaintiff is included, against the risk of the type of\nharm which has in fact occurred as a result of its violation.\u201d W.

S., at 400, n. 16, in turn quoting Data\nProcessing, supra, at 156).\n  Identifying the interests protected by the Lanham Act,\nhowever, requires no guesswork, since the Act includes an\n\u201cunusual, and extraordinarily helpful,\u201d detailed statement\nof the statute\u2019s purposes. H. B. Halicki Productions v.\nUnited Artists Communications, Inc., 812 F. 2d 1213, 1214\n(CA9 1987). Section 45 of the Act, codified at 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71127, provides:\n     \u201cThe intent of this chapter is to regulate commerce\n     within the control of Congress by making actionable\n     the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such\n     commerce; to protect registered marks used in such\n     commerce from interference by State, or territorial\n     legislation; to protect persons engaged in such com\u00ad\n     merce against unfair competition; to prevent fraud\n     and deception in such commerce by the use of repro\u00ad\n     ductions, copies, counterfeits, or colorable imitations\n     of registered marks; and to provide rights and reme\u00ad\n     dies stipulated by treaties and conventions respect-\n     ing trademarks, trade names, and unfair competition\n     entered into between the United States and foreign\n     nations.\u201d\nMost of the enumerated purposes are relevant to false\u00ad\nassociation cases; a typical false-advertising case will\nimplicate only the Act\u2019s goal of \u201cprotect[ing] persons en\u00ad\ngaged in [commerce within the control of Congress]\nagainst unfair competition.\u201d Although \u201cunfair competi\u00ad\ntion\u201d was a \u201cplastic\u201d concept at common law, Ely-Norris\nSafe Co. v. Mosler Safe Co., 7 F. 2d 603, 604 (CA2 1925)\n(L. Hand, J.), it was understood to be concerned with\ninjuries to business reputation and present and future\nsales. See Rogers, Book Review, 39 Yale L.

A consumer who is hoodwinked into purchasing a\ndisappointing product may well have an injury-in-fact\ncognizable under Article III, but he cannot invoke the\nprotection of the Lanham Act\u2014a conclusion reached by\nevery Circuit to consider the question.

Even a business misled by a supplier into pur\u00ad\nchasing an inferior product is, like consumers generally,\nnot under the Act\u2019s aegis.\n                     B. Proximate Cause\n  Second, we generally presume that a statutory cause of\naction is limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proxi-\nmately caused by violations of the statute. For centuries, it\nhas been \u201ca well established principle of [the common] law,\nthat in all cases of loss, we are to attribute it to the proxi\u00ad\nmate cause, and not to any remote cause.\u201d Waters v.\nMerchants\u2019 Louisville Ins.

S., at 287 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\nment). That venerable principle reflects the reality that\n\u201cthe judicial remedy cannot encompass every conceivable\nharm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing.\u201d Associ-\nated Gen. Contractors, 459 U. S., at 536. Congress, we\nassume, is familiar with the common-law rule and does\nnot mean to displace it sub silentio. We have thus con\u00ad\nstrued federal causes of action in a variety of contexts to\n14        LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL\n                  COMPONENTS, INC.                          \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nincorporate a requirement of proximate causation. See,\ne.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336,\n346 (2005) (securities fraud); Holmes, supra, at 268\u2013270\n(RICO); Associated Gen. Contractors, supra, at 529\u2013535\n(Clayton Act). No party disputes that it is proper to read\n\u00a71125(a) as containing such a requirement, its broad\nlanguage notwithstanding.\n   The proximate-cause inquiry is not easy to define, and\nover the years it has taken various forms; but courts have\na great deal of experience applying it, and there is a\nwealth of precedent for them to draw upon in doing so.\nSee Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 838\u2013\n839 (1996); Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v. Valladolid,\n565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3). Proximate\u00ad\ncause analysis is controlled by the nature of the statutory\ncause of action. The question it presents is whether the\nharm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the\nconduct the statute prohibits.\n   Put differently, the proximate-cause requirement gener\u00ad\nally bars suits for alleged harm that is \u201ctoo remote\u201d from\nthe defendant\u2019s unlawful conduct. That is ordinarily the\ncase if the harm is purely derivative of \u201cmisfortunes visited\nupon a third person by the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d Holmes,\nsupra, at 268\u2013269; see, e.g., Hemi Group, LLC v. City of\nNew York, 559 U. S. 1, 10\u201311 (2010). In a sense, of course,\nall commercial injuries from false advertising are deriva\u00ad\ntive of those suffered by consumers who are deceived by\nthe advertising; but since the Lanham Act authorizes suit\nonly for commercial injuries, the intervening step of con\u00ad\nsumer deception is not fatal to the showing of proximate\ncausation required by the statute. See Harold H. Huggins\nRealty, Inc. v. FNC, Inc., 634 F. 3d 787, 800\u2013801 (CA5\n2011). That is consistent with our recognition that under\ncommon-law principles, a plaintiff can be directly injured\nby a misrepresentation even where \u201ca third party, and not\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe plaintiff, . . . relied on\u201d it. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &\nIndemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 656 (2008).\n   We thus hold that a plaintiff suing under \u00a71125(a)\nordinarily must show economic or reputational injury\nflowing directly from the deception wrought by the de\u00ad\nfendant\u2019s advertising; and that that occurs when deception\nof consumers causes them to withhold trade from the\nplaintiff. That showing is generally not made when the\ndeception produces injuries to a fellow commercial actor\nthat in turn affect the plaintiff. For example, while a\ncompetitor who is forced out of business by a defendant\u2019s\nfalse advertising generally will be able to sue for its losses,\nthe same is not true of the competitor\u2019s landlord, its elec\u00ad\ntric company, and other commercial parties who suffer\nmerely as a result of the competitor\u2019s \u201cinability to meet\n[its] financial obligations.\u201d Anza, 547 U. S., at 458.6\n                    C. Proposed Tests\n  At oral argument, Lexmark agreed that the zone of in-\nterests and proximate causation supply the relevant back\u00ad\nground limitations on suit under \u00a71125(a). See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 4\u20135, 11\u201312, 17\u201318. But it urges us to adopt, as\nthe optimal formulation of those principles, a multifactor\nbalancing test derived from Associated General Contrac-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Proximate causation is not a requirement of Article III standing,\n\nwhich requires only that the plaintiff \u2019s injury be fairly traceable to the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct. Like the zone-of-interests test, see supra, at 8\u20139,\nand nn. 3\u20134, it is an element of the cause of action under the statute,\nand so is subject to the rule that \u201cthe absence of a valid (as opposed to\narguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdic\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 89. But like any other element of a cause\nof action, it must be adequately alleged at the pleading stage in order\nfor the case to proceed. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 678\u2013679\n(2009). If a plaintiff \u2019s allegations, taken as true, are insufficient to\nestablish proximate causation, then the complaint must be dismissed; if\nthey are sufficient, then the plaintiff is entitled to an opportunity to\nprove them.\n16         LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL\n                   COMPONENTS, INC.                             \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntors. In the alternative, it asks that we adopt a categorical\ntest permitting only direct competitors to sue for false\nadvertising. And although neither party urges adoption of\nthe \u201creasonable interest\u201d test applied below, several amici\ndo so. While none of those tests is wholly without merit,\nwe decline to adopt any of them. We hold instead that a\ndirect application of the zone-of-interests test and the\nproximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits\non who may sue.\n  The balancing test Lexmark advocates was first articu\u00ad\nlated by the Third Circuit in Conte Bros. and later adopted\nby several other Circuits. Conte Bros. identified five rele\u00ad\nvant considerations:\n       \u201c(1) The nature of the plaintiff \u2019s alleged injury: Is\n     the injury of a type that Congress sought to redress in\n     providing a private remedy for violations of the [Lan\u00ad\n     ham Act]?\n       \u201c(2) The directness or indirectness of the asserted\n     injury.\n       \u201c(3) The proximity or remoteness of the party to the\n     alleged injurious conduct.\n       \u201c(4) The speculativeness of the damages claim.\n       \u201c(5) The risk of duplicative damages or complexity\n     in apportioning damages.\u201d 165 F. 3d, at 233 (citations\n     and internal quotation marks omitted).\nThis approach reflects a commendable effort to give con\u00ad\ntent to an otherwise nebulous inquiry, but we think it\nslightly off the mark. The first factor can be read as re\u00ad\nquiring that the plaintiff \u2019s injury be within the relevant\nzone of interests and the second and third as requiring\n(somewhat redundantly) proximate causation; but it is not\ncorrect to treat those requirements, which must be met in\nevery case, as mere factors to be weighed in a balance.\nAnd the fourth and fifth factors are themselves problem\u00ad\natic. \u201c[T]he difficulty that can arise when a court attempts\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto ascertain the damages caused by some remote action\u201d is\na \u201cmotivating principle\u201d behind the proximate-cause re\u00ad\nquirement, Anza, supra, at 457\u2013458; but potential diffi\u00ad\nculty in ascertaining and apportioning damages is not, as\nConte Bros. might suggest, an independent basis for deny\u00ad\ning standing where it is adequately alleged that a defend\u00ad\nant\u2019s conduct has proximately injured an interest of the\nplaintiff \u2019s that the statute protects. Even when a plaintiff\ncannot quantify its losses with sufficient certainty to re-\ncover damages, it may still be entitled to injunctive re-\nlief under \u00a71116(a) (assuming it can prove a likelihood of\nfuture injury) or disgorgement of the defendant\u2019s ill-gotten\nprofits under \u00a71117(a). See TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v.\nEdriver Inc., 653 F. 3d 820, 831 (CA9 2011); Johnson &\nJohnson v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 631 F. 2d 186, 190 (CA2\n1980). Finally, experience has shown that the Conte Bros.\napproach, like other open-ended balancing tests, can yield\nunpredictable and at times arbitrary results. See, e.g.,\nTushnet, Running the Gamut from A to B: Federal\nTrademark and False Advertising Law, 159 U. Pa. L. Rev.\n1305, 1376\u20131379 (2011).\n   In contrast to the multifactor balancing approach, the\ndirect-competitor test provides a bright-line rule; but it\ndoes so at the expense of distorting the statutory lan\u00ad\nguage. To be sure, a plaintiff who does not compete with\nthe defendant will often have a harder time establishing\nproximate causation. But a rule categorically prohibiting\nall suits by noncompetitors would read too much into the\nAct\u2019s reference to \u201cunfair competition\u201d in \u00a71127. By the\ntime the Lanham Act was adopted, the common-law tort of\nunfair competition was understood not to be limited to\nactions between competitors. One leading authority in the\nfield wrote that \u201cthere need be no competition in unfair\ncompetition,\u201d just as \u201c[t]here is no soda in soda water, no\ngrapes in grape fruit, no bread in bread fruit, and a clothes\nhorse is not a horse but is good enough to hang things\n18        LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v.

It is thus a mis\u00ad\ntake to infer that because the Lanham Act treats false\nadvertising as a form of unfair competition, it can protect\nonly the false-advertiser\u2019s direct competitors.\n    Finally, there is the \u201creasonable interest\u201d test applied by\nthe Sixth Circuit in this case. As typically formulated,\nit requires a commercial plaintiff to \u201cdemonstrate \u2018(1) a\nreasonable interest to be protected against the alleged\nfalse advertising and (2) a reasonable basis for believing\nthat the interest is likely to be damaged by the alleged\nfalse advertising.\u2019 \u201d 697 F. 3d, at 410 (quoting Famous\nHorse, 624 F. 3d, at 113). A purely practical objection to\nthe test is that it lends itself to widely divergent appli-\ncation. Indeed, its vague language can be understood as\nrequiring only the bare minimum of Article III standing.\nThe popularity of the multifactor balancing test reflects its\nappeal to courts tired of \u201cgrappl[ing] with defining\u201d the\n\u201c \u2018reasonable interest\u2019 \u201d test \u201cwith greater precision.\u201d Conte\nBros., 165 F. 3d, at 231. The theoretical difficulties with\nthe test are even more substantial: The relevant question\nis not whether the plaintiff \u2019s interest is \u201creasonable,\u201d but\nwhether it is one the Lanham Act protects; and not\nwhether there is a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for the plaintiff \u2019s\nclaim of harm, but whether the harm alleged is proximately\ntied to the defendant\u2019s conduct. In short, we think the\nprinciples set forth above will provide clearer and more\naccurate guidance than the \u201creasonable interest\u201d test.\n                       IV. Application\n  Applying those principles to Static Control\u2019s false\u00ad\nadvertising claim, we conclude that Static Control comes\nwithin the class of plaintiffs whom Congress authorized to\nsue under \u00a71125(a).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   To begin, Static Control\u2019s alleged injuries\u2014lost sales\nand damage to its business reputation\u2014are injuries to\nprecisely the sorts of commercial interests the Act pro\u00ad\ntects. Static Control is suing not as a deceived consumer,\nbut as a \u201cperso[n] engaged in\u201d \u201ccommerce within the con\u00ad\ntrol of Congress\u201d whose position in the marketplace has\nbeen damaged by Lexmark\u2019s false advertising. \u00a71127.\nThere is no doubt that it is within the zone of interests\nprotected by the statute.\n   Static Control also sufficiently alleged that its injuries\nwere proximately caused by Lexmark\u2019s misrepresenta\u00ad\ntions. This case, it is true, does not present the \u201cclassic\nLanham Act false-advertising claim\u201d in which \u201c \u2018one com\u00ad\npetito[r] directly injur[es] another by making false state\u00ad\nments about his own goods [or the competitor\u2019s goods] and\nthus inducing customers to switch.\u2019 \u201d Harold H. Huggins\nRealty, 634 F. 3d, at 799, n. 24. But although diversion of\nsales to a direct competitor may be the paradigmatic direct\ninjury from false advertising, it is not the only type of\ninjury cognizable under \u00a71125(a). For at least two rea\u00ad\nsons, Static Control\u2019s allegations satisfy the requirement\nof proximate causation.\n   First, Static Control alleged that Lexmark disparaged\nits business and products by asserting that Static Con\u00ad\ntrol\u2019s business was illegal. See 697 F. 3d, at 411, n. 10\n(noting allegation that Lexmark \u201cdirectly target[ed] Static\nControl\u201d when it \u201cfalsely advertised that Static Control\ninfringed Lexmark\u2019s patents\u201d). When a defendant harms\na plaintiff \u2019s reputation by casting aspersions on its busi\u00ad\nness, the plaintiff \u2019s injury flows directly from the audi\u00ad\nence\u2019s belief in the disparaging statements. Courts have\ntherefore afforded relief under \u00a71125(a) not only where a\ndefendant denigrates a plaintiff \u2019s product by name, see,\ne.g., McNeilab, Inc. v. American Home Prods. Corp., 848\nF. 2d 34, 38 (CA2 1988), but also where the defendant\ndamages the product\u2019s reputation by, for example, equat\u00ad\n20          LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL\n                    COMPONENTS, INC.\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning it with an inferior product, see, e.g., Camel Hair and\nCashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry Goods Corp.,\n799 F. 2d 6, 7\u20138, 11\u201312 (CA1 1986); PPX Enterprises, Inc.\nv. Audiofidelity, Inc., 746 F. 2d 120, 122, 125 (CA2 1984).\nTraditional proximate-causation principles support those\nresults: As we have observed, a defendant who \u201c \u2018seeks to\npromote his own interests by telling a known falsehood to\nor about the plaintiff or his product\u2019 \u201d may be said to have\nproximately caused the plaintiff \u2019s harm. Bridge, 553\nU. S., at 657 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7870,\nComment h (1977); emphasis added in Bridge).\n   The District Court emphasized that Lexmark and Static\nControl are not direct competitors. But when a party\nclaims reputational injury from disparagement, competi\u00ad\ntion is not required for proximate cause; and that is true\neven if the defendant\u2019s aim was to harm its immediate\ncompetitors, and the plaintiff merely suffered collateral\ndamage. Consider two rival carmakers who purchase\nairbags for their cars from different third-party manufac\u00ad\nturers. If the first carmaker, hoping to divert sales from\nthe second, falsely proclaims that the airbags used by the\nsecond carmaker are defective, both the second carmaker\nand its airbag supplier may suffer reputational injury, and\ntheir sales may decline as a result. In those circumstances,\nthere is no reason to regard either party\u2019s injury as de-\nrivative of the other\u2019s; each is directly and independently\nharmed by the attack on its merchandise.\n   In addition, Static Control adequately alleged proximate\ncausation by alleging that it designed, manufactured, and\nsold microchips that both (1) were necessary for, and\n(2) had no other use than, refurbishing Lexmark toner\ncartridges. See App. 13, \u00b631; id., at 37, \u00b654.7 It follows\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 We understand this to be the thrust of both sides\u2019 allegations con\u00ad\n\ncerning Static Control\u2019s design and sale of specialized microchips for\nthe specific purpose of enabling the remanufacture of Lexmark\u2019s\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)       21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom that allegation that any false advertising that re\u00ad\nduced the remanufacturers\u2019 business necessarily injured\nStatic Control as well. Taking Static Control\u2019s assertions\nat face value, there is likely to be something very close to a\n1:1 relationship between the number of refurbished Pre\u00ad\nbate cartridges sold (or not sold) by the remanufacturers\nand the number of Prebate microchips sold (or not sold) by\nStatic Control. \u201cWhere the injury alleged is so integral an\naspect of the [violation] alleged, there can be no question\u201d\nthat proximate cause is satisfied. Blue Shield of Va. v.\nMcCready, 457 U. S. 465, 479 (1982).\n   To be sure, on this view, the causal chain linking Static\nControl\u2019s injuries to consumer confusion is not direct, but\nincludes the intervening link of injury to the remanufac\u00ad\nturers. Static Control\u2019s allegations therefore might not\nsupport standing under a strict application of the \u201c \u2018 \u201cgen\u00ad\neral tendency\u201d \u2019 \u201d not to stretch proximate causation \u201c \u2018 \u201cbe\u00ad\nyond the first step.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Holmes, 503 U. S., at 271. But the\nreason for that general tendency is that there ordinarily is\na \u201cdiscontinuity\u201d between the injury to the direct victim\nand the injury to the indirect victim, so that the latter\nis not surely attributable to the former (and thus also to\nthe defendant\u2019s conduct), but might instead have resulted\nfrom \u201cany number of [other] reasons.\u201d Anza, 547 U. S., at\n458\u2013459. That is not the case here. Static Control\u2019s alle\u00ad\ngations suggest that if the remanufacturers sold 10,000\nfewer refurbished cartridges because of Lexmark\u2019s false\nadvertising, then it would follow more or less automatically\nthat Static Control sold 10,000 fewer microchips for the\nsame reason, without the need for any \u201cspeculative . . .\nproceedings\u201d or \u201cintricate, uncertain inquiries.\u201d Id., at\n459\u2013460. In these relatively unique circumstances, the\nremanufacturers are not \u201cmore immediate victim[s]\u201d than\nStatic Control. Bridge, supra, at 658.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPrebate cartridges.\n22        LEXMARK INT\u2019L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL \n\n                  COMPONENTS, INC.                             \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  Although we conclude that Static Control has alleged an\nadequate basis to proceed under \u00a71125(a), it cannot obtain\nrelief without evidence of injury proximately caused by\nLexmark\u2019s alleged misrepresentations. We hold only that\nStatic Control is entitled to a chance to prove its case.\n                         *   *    *\n  To invoke the Lanham Act\u2019s cause of action for false\nadvertising, a plaintiff must plead (and ultimately prove)\nan injury to a commercial interest in sales or business\nreputation proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s mis-\nrepresentations. Static Control has adequately pleaded\nboth elements. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
