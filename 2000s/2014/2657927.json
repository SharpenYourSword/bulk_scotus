CASTLEMAN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12\u20131371. Argued January 15, 2014\u2014Decided March 26, 2014\nRespondent Castleman moved to dismiss his indictment under 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9), which forbids the possession of firearms by any-\n  one convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d He ar-\n  gued that his previous conviction for \u201cintentionally or knowingly\n  caus[ing] bodily injury to\u201d the mother of his child, App. 27, did not\n  qualify as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d because it did\n  not involve \u201cthe use or attempted use of physical force,\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The District Court agreed, reasoning that \u201cphysi-\n  cal force\u201d must entail violent contact and that one can cause bodily\n  injury without violent contact, e.g., by poisoning. The Sixth Circuit\n  affirmed on a different rationale. It held that the degree of physical\n  force required for a conviction to constitute a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\n  domestic violence\u201d is the same as that required for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d\n  under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2014\n  namely, violent force\u2014and that Castleman could have been convicted\n  for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct.\nHeld: Castleman\u2019s conviction qualifies as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of do-\n mestic violence.\u201d Pp. 4\u201316.\n    (a) Section 922(g)(9)\u2019s \u201cphysical force\u201d requirement is satisfied by\n the degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction\u2014\n namely, offensive touching. Congress presumably intends to incorpo-\n rate the common-law meaning of terms that it uses, and nothing sug-\n gests Congress intended otherwise here. The Sixth Circuit relied up-\n on Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, in which the common-law\n meaning of \u201cforce\u201d was found to be a \u201ccomical misfit,\u201d id., at 145,\n when read into ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition. But Johnson re-\n solves this case in the Government\u2019s favor: The very reasons for re-\n jecting the common-law meaning in Johnson are reasons to embrace\n2                   UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    it here. First, whereas it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that Congress meant to in-\n    corporate in ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition \u201ca phrase that the\n    common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misde-\n    meanor,\u201d id., at 141, it is likely that Congress meant to incorporate\n    the misdemeanor-specific meaning of \u201cforce\u201d in defining a \u201cmisde-\n    meanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d Second, whereas the word \u201cvio-\n    lent\u201d or \u201cviolence\u201d standing alone \u201cconnotes a substantial degree of\n    force,\u201d id., at 140, that is not true of \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d which is a\n    term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as \u201cvi-\n    olent\u201d in a nondomestic context. Third, whereas this Court has hesi-\n    tated to apply ACCA to \u201ccrimes which, though dangerous, are not\n    typically committed by those whom one normally labels \u2018armed career\n    criminals,\u2019 \u201d Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137, 146, there is no\n    anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or\n    battery offenses together with others whom \u00a7922(g) disqualifies from\n    gun ownership. In addition, a contrary reading would have made\n    \u00a7922(g)(9) inoperative in at least ten States when it was enacted.\n    Pp. 4\u201310.\n       (b) Under this definition of \u201cphysical force,\u201d Castleman\u2019s conviction\n    qualifies as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d The appli-\n    cation of the modified categorical approach\u2014consulting Castleman\u2019s\n    state indictment to determine whether his conviction entailed the el-\n    ements necessary to constitute the generic federal offense\u2014is\n    straightforward. Castleman pleaded guilty to \u201cintentionally or know-\n    ingly caus[ing] bodily injury to\u201d the mother of his child, and the\n    knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves\n    the use of physical force. First, a \u201cbodily injury\u201d must result from\n    \u201cphysical force.\u201d The common-law concept of \u201cforce\u201d encompasses\n    even its indirect application, making it impossible to cause bodily in-\n    jury without applying force in the common-law sense. Second, the\n    knowing or intentional application of force is a \u201cuse\u201d of force. Leocal\n    v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, distinguished. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (c) Castleman claims that legislative history, the rule of lenity, and\n    the canon of constitutional avoidance weigh against this Court\u2019s in-\n    terpretation of \u00a7922(g)(9), but his arguments are unpersuasive.\n    Pp. 14\u201315.\n695 F. 3d 582, reversed and remanded.\n\n  SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

Hayes,\n555 U. S. 415, 427 (2009), Congress forbade the possession\nof firearms by anyone convicted of \u201ca misdemeanor crime\nof domestic violence.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9). The re-\nspondent, James Alvin Castleman, pleaded guilty to the\nmisdemeanor offense of having \u201cintentionally or knowingly\ncause[d] bodily injury to\u201d the mother of his child. App.\n27. The question before us is whether this conviction\nqualifies as \u201ca misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d\nWe hold that it does.\n                           I\n\n                           A\n\n  This country witnesses more than a million acts of\ndomestic violence, and hundreds of deaths from domestic\nviolence, each year.1 See Georgia v.

Institute of Justice J., No. 250,\np. 16 (Nov. 2003) (\u201cWhen a gun was in the house, an\nabused woman was 6 times more likely than other abused\nwomen to be killed\u201d). \u201c[A]ll too often,\u201d as one Senator\nnoted during the debate over \u00a7922(g)(9), \u201cthe only differ-\nence between a battered woman and a dead woman is the\npresence of a gun.\u201d 142 Cong.

App. 27. He\npleaded guilty. Id., at 29.\n  In 2008, federal authorities learned that Castleman was\nselling firearms on the black market. A grand jury in the\nWestern District of Tennessee indicted him on two counts\nof violating \u00a7922(g)(9) and on other charges not relevant\nhere. Id., at 13\u201316.\n  Castleman moved to dismiss the \u00a7922(g)(9) charges,\narguing that his Tennessee conviction did not qualify as a\n\u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d because it did\nnot \u201cha[ve], as an element, the use . . . of physical force,\u201d\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The District Court agreed, on the the-\nory that \u201cthe \u2018use of physical force\u2019 for \u00a7922(g)(9) purposes\u201d\nmust entail \u201cviolent contact with the victim.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 40a. The court held that a conviction under the\nrelevant Tennessee statute cannot qualify as a \u201cmisde-\nmeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d because one can cause\nbodily injury without \u201cviolent contact\u201d\u2014for example, by\n\u201cdeceiving [the victim] into drinking a poisoned beverage.\u201d\nId., at 41a.\n  A divided panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\n4               UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nSixth Circuit affirmed, by different reasoning. 695 F. 3d\n582 (2012). The majority held that the degree of physical\nforce required by \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) is the same as required\nby \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), which defines \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Id., at\n587. Applying our decision in Johnson v. United States,\n559 U. S. 133 (2010), which held that \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) re-\nquires \u201cviolent force,\u201d id., at 140, the majority held that\nCastleman\u2019s conviction did not qualify as a \u201cmisdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence\u201d because Castleman could have\nbeen convicted for \u201ccaus[ing] a slight, nonserious physical\ninjury with conduct that cannot be described as violent.\u201d\n695 F. 3d, at 590. Judge McKeague dissented, arguing\nboth that the majority erred in extending Johnson\u2019s defini-\ntion of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d to the context of a \u201cmisdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence\u201d and that, in any event, Castle-\nman\u2019s conviction satisfied the Johnson standard. Id., at\n593\u2013597.\n   The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision deepened a split of author-\nity among the Courts of Appeals. Compare, e.g., United\nStates v. Nason, 269 F. 3d 10, 18 (CA1 2001) (\u00a7922(g)(9)\n\u201cencompass[es] crimes characterized by the application of\nany physical force\u201d), with United States v. Belless, 338\nF. 3d 1063, 1068 (CA9 2003) (\u00a7922(g)(9) covers only \u201cthe\nviolent use of force\u201d). We granted certiorari to resolve this\nsplit, 570 U.

In Johnson,\nwe considered whether a battery conviction was a \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n\u00a7924(e)(1). As here, ACCA defines such a crime as one\nthat \u201chas as an element the use . . . of physical force,\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). We began by observing that at common\nlaw, the element of force in the crime of battery was \u201csatis-\nfied by even the slightest offensive touching.\u201d 559 U. S., at\n139 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 120 (1768)).2 And we recognized the general rule\nthat \u201ca common-law term of art should be given its estab-\nlished common-law meaning,\u201d except \u201cwhere that meaning\ndoes not fit.\u201d 559 U. S., at 139. We declined to read the\ncommon-law meaning of \u201cforce\u201d into ACCA\u2019s definition of a\n\u201cviolent felony,\u201d because we found it a \u201ccomical misfit with\nthe defined term.\u201d Id., at 145; see United States v. Ste-\nvens, 559 U. S. 460, 474 (2010) (\u201c[A]n unclear definitional\nphrase may take meaning from the term to be defined\u201d).\nIn defining a \u201c \u2018violent felony,\u2019 \u201d we held, \u201cthe phrase \u2018physi-\ncal force\u2019 \u201d must \u201cmea[n] violent force.\u201d Johnson, 559 U. S.,\nat 140. But here, the common-law meaning of \u201cforce\u201d fits\nperfectly: The very reasons we gave for rejecting that\nmeaning in defining a \u201cviolent felony\u201d are reasons to em-\nbrace it in defining a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201d3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 We explained that the word \u201cphysical\u201d did not add much to the word\n\n\u201cforce,\u201d except to distinguish \u201cforce exerted by and through concrete\nbodies . . . from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force.\u201d\nJohnson, 559 U. S., at 138.\n   3 Johnson specifically reserved the question whether our definition of\n\n\u201cphysical force\u201d would extend to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9). 559 U. S., at\n143\u2013144. And these reasons for declining to extend Johnson\u2019s defini-\ntion to \u00a7922(g)(9) serve equally to rebut the \u201cpresumption of consistent\nusage\u201d on which JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence heavily relies, post, at\n1\u20132, 4.\n6                 UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n    First, because perpetrators of domestic violence are\n\u201croutinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault\nor battery laws,\u201d Hayes, 555 U. S., at 427, it makes sense\nfor Congress to have classified as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d the type of conduct that supports a\ncommon-law battery conviction. Whereas it was \u201cunlikely\u201d\nthat Congress meant to incorporate in the definition of a\n\u201c \u2018violent felony\u2019 a phrase that the common law gave pecu-\nliar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,\u201d\nJohnson, 559 U. S., at 141, it is likely that Congress\nmeant to incorporate that misdemeanor-specific meaning\nof \u201cforce\u201d in defining a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201d\n    Second, whereas the word \u201cviolent\u201d or \u201cviolence\u201d stand-\ning alone \u201cconnotes a substantial degree of force,\u201d id., at\n140,4 that is not true of \u201cdomestic violence.\u201d \u201cDomestic\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 This portion of Johnson\u2019s analysis relied heavily on Leocal v. Ash-\n\ncroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), in which we interpreted the meaning of a\n\u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U. S. C. \u00a716. As in Johnson and here, the\nstatute defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in part as one \u201cthat has as an\nelement the use . . . of physical force,\u201d \u00a716(a). In support of our holding\nin Johnson, we quoted Leocal\u2019s observation that \u201c \u2018[t]he ordinary mean-\ning of [a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d] . . . suggests a category of violent, active\ncrimes.\u2019 \u201d 559 U. S., at 140 (quoting 543 U. S., at 11).\n  The Courts of Appeals have generally held that mere offensive\ntouching cannot constitute the \u201cphysical force\u201d necessary to a \u201ccrime of\nviolence,\u201d just as we held in Johnson that it could not constitute the\n\u201cphysical force\u201d necessary to a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d See Karimi v.

See Brief for National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae\n4\u20139; DOJ, Office on Violence Against Women, Domestic\nViolence (defining physical forms of domestic violence to\ninclude \u201c[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching,\nbiting, [and] hair pulling\u201d), online at http://www.ovw.\nusdoj.gov/domviolence.htm.5 Indeed, \u201cmost physical as-\nsaults committed against women and men by intimates\nare relatively minor and consist of pushing, grabbing,\nshoving, slapping, and hitting.\u201d DOJ, P. Tjaden & N.\nThoennes, Extent, Nature and Consequences of Intimate\nPartner Violence 11 (2000).\n  Minor uses of force may not constitute \u201cviolence\u201d in the\ngeneric sense. For example, in an opinion that we cited\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nviolence\u201d under \u00a716. Matter of Velasquez, 25 I. & N. Dec. 278, 282\n(2010). Nothing in today\u2019s opinion casts doubt on these holdings,\nbecause\u2014as we explain\u2014\u201cdomestic violence\u201d encompasses a range of\nforce broader than that which constitutes \u201cviolence\u201d simpliciter.\n  We note, as does JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence, post, at 8, and n. 7,\nthat federal law elsewhere defines \u201cdomestic violence\u201d in more limited\nterms: For example, a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act\ndefines a \u201c \u2018crime of domestic violence\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany crime of violence (as\ndefined by [18 U. S. C. \u00a716])\u201d committed against a qualifying relation. 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E)(i). Our view that \u201cdomestic violence\u201d encom-\npasses acts that might not constitute \u201cviolence\u201d in a nondomestic\ncontext does not extend to a provision like this, which specifically\ndefines \u201cdomestic violence\u201d by reference to a generic \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d\n  5 See also    A.

Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d\n666, 670 (2003). But an act of this nature is easy to de-\nscribe as \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d when the accumulation of\nsuch acts over time can subject one intimate partner to the\nother\u2019s control. If a seemingly minor act like this draws\nthe attention of authorities and leads to a successful pros-\necution for a misdemeanor offense, it does not offend\ncommon sense or the English language to characterize the\nresulting conviction as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201d\n   JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence discounts our reference to\nsocial-science definitions of \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d including\nthose used by the organizations most directly engaged\nwith the problem and thus most aware of its dimensions.\nSee post, at 8\u201311. It is important to keep in mind, how-\never, that the operative phrase we are construing is not\n\u201cdomestic violence\u201d; it is \u201cphysical force.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A).\n\u201cPhysical force\u201d has a presumptive common-law meaning,\nand the question is simply whether that presumptive\nmeaning makes sense in defining a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence.\u201d6\n   A third reason for distinguishing Johnson\u2019s definition of\n\u201cphysical force\u201d is that unlike in Johnson\u2014where a deter-\nmination that the defendant\u2019s crime was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d\nwould have classified him as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d\u2014\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The concurrence\u2019s reliance on definitions of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d in\n\nother statutory provisions, see post, at 8, and n. 7, is similarly unper-\nsuasive. These other provisions show that when Congress wished to\ndefine \u201cdomestic violence\u201d as a type of \u201cviolence\u201d simpliciter, it knew\nhow to do so. That it did not do so here suggests, if anything, that it did\nnot mean to. See, e.g., Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485, 492\n(1994). This also answers the concurrence\u2019s suggestion, post, at 10,\nthat our holding will somehow make it difficult for Congress to define\n\u201cdomestic violence\u201d\u2014where it wants to\u2014as requiring violent force.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

Section 922(g) bars\ngun possession by anyone \u201caddicted to any controlled\nsubstance,\u201d \u00a7922(g)(3); by most people who have \u201cbeen\nadmitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant\nvisa,\u201d \u00a7922(g)(5)(B); by anyone who has renounced United\nStates citizenship, \u00a7922(g)(7); and by anyone subject to a\ndomestic restraining order, \u00a7922(g)(8). Whereas we have\nhesitated (as in Johnson) to apply the Armed Career\nCriminal Act to \u201ccrimes which, though dangerous, are not\ntypically committed by those whom one normally labels\n\u2018armed career criminals,\u2019 \u201d Begay v. United States, 553\nU. S. 137, 146 (2008), we see no anomaly in grouping\ndomestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery\noffenses together with the others whom \u00a7922(g) disquali-\nfies from gun ownership.\n   An additional reason to read the statute as we do is that\na contrary reading would have rendered \u00a7922(g)(9) inoper-\native in many States at the time of its enactment. The\n\u201cassault or battery laws\u201d under which \u201cdomestic abusers\nwere . . . routinely prosecuted\u201d when Congress enacted\n\u00a7922(g)(9), and under which many are still prosecuted\ntoday, Hayes, 555 U.

See Brief for United States 36\u201338. Whether or\nnot the causation of bodily injury necessarily entails vio-\nlent force\u2014a question we do not reach\u2014mere offensive\ntouching does not. See Johnson, 559 U. S., at 139\u2013140. So\nif offensive touching did not constitute \u201cforce\u201d under\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A), then \u00a7922(g)(9) would have been ineffec-\ntual in at least 10 States\u2014home to nearly thirty percent of\nthe Nation\u2019s population7\u2014at the time of its enactment.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 7 See   U.

A threat under \u00a739\u201313\u2013101(2) may\nnot necessarily involve a deadly weapon, and the merely\nreckless causation of bodily injury under \u00a739\u201313\u2013101(1)\nmay not be a \u201cuse\u201d of force.8\n   But we need not decide whether a domestic assault\nconviction in Tennessee categorically constitutes a \u201cmis-\ndemeanor crime of domestic violence,\u201d because the parties\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 We  held in Leocal that \u201c \u2018use\u2019 requires active employment,\u201d rather\n\u201cthan negligent or merely accidental conduct.\u201d 543 U.

We may accordingly apply the modified categorical\napproach, consulting the indictment to which Castleman\npleaded guilty in order to determine whether his convic-\ntion did entail the elements necessary to constitute the\ngeneric federal offense. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1\u20132); see\nShepard, 544 U. S., at 26. Here, that analysis is straight-\nforward: Castleman pleaded guilty to having \u201cintentionally\nor knowingly cause[d] bodily injury\u201d to the mother of his\nchild, App. 27, and the knowing or intentional causation of\nbodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.\n   First, a \u201cbodily injury\u201d must result from \u201cphysical force.\u201d\nUnder Tennessee law, \u201cbodily injury\u201d is a broad term: It\n\u201cincludes a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn or disfigurement;\nphysical pain or temporary illness or impairment of the\nfunction of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.\u201d\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u201311\u2013106(a)(2) (1997). JUSTICE SCA-\nLIA\u2019s concurrence suggests that these forms of injury ne-\ncessitate violent force, under Johnson\u2019s definition of that\nphrase. Post, at 3. But whether or not that is so\u2014a\nquestion we do not decide\u2014these forms of injury do neces-\nsitate force in the common-law sense.\n   The District Court thought otherwise, reasoning that\none can cause bodily injury \u201cwithout the \u2018use of physical\nforce\u2019 \u201d\u2014for example, by \u201cdeceiving [the victim] into drink-\ning a poisoned beverage, without making contact of any\nkind.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a. But as we explained in\nJohnson, \u201cphysical force\u201d is simply \u201cforce exerted by and\nthrough concrete bodies,\u201d as opposed to \u201cintellectual force\nor emotional force.\u201d 559 U. S., at 138. And the common-\nlaw concept of \u201cforce\u201d encompasses even its indirect ap-\nplication. \u201cForce\u201d in this sense \u201cdescrib[es] one of the\nelements of the common-law crime of battery,\u201d id., at 139,\nand \u201c[t]he force used\u201d in battery \u201cneed not be applied\ndirectly to the body of the victim.\u201d 2 W.

App. 463, 534\nS. E. 2d 347 (2000) (laser beam)). It is impossible to cause\nbodily injury without applying force in the common-law\nsense.\n   Second, the knowing or intentional application of force\nis a \u201cuse\u201d of force. Castleman is correct that under Leocal\nv. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), the word \u201cuse\u201d \u201cconveys the\nidea that the thing used (here, \u2018physical force\u2019) has been\nmade the user\u2019s instrument.\u201d Brief for Respondent 37.\nBut he errs in arguing that although \u201c[p]oison may have\n\u2018forceful physical properties\u2019 as a matter of organic chemis-\ntry, . . . no one would say that a poisoner \u2018employs\u2019 force or\n\u2018carries out a purpose by means of force\u2019 when he or\nshe sprinkles poison in a victim\u2019s drink,\u201d ibid. The \u201cuse\nof force\u201d in Castleman\u2019s example is not the act of\n\u201csprinkl[ing]\u201d the poison; it is the act of employing poison\nknowingly as a device to cause physical harm. That the\nharm occurs indirectly, rather than directly (as with a kick\nor punch), does not matter. Under Castleman\u2019s logic, after\nall, one could say that pulling the trigger on a gun is not a\n\u201cuse of force\u201d because it is the bullet, not the trigger, that\nactually strikes the victim. Leocal held that the \u201cuse\u201d of\nforce must entail \u201ca higher degree of intent than negligent\nor merely accidental conduct,\u201d 543 U. S., at 9; it did not\nhold that the word \u201cuse\u201d somehow alters the meaning of\n\u201cforce.\u201d\n   Because Castleman\u2019s indictment makes clear that the\nuse of physical force was an element of his conviction, that\nconviction qualifies as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201d\n14            UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                           III\n We are not persuaded by Castleman\u2019s nontextual argu-\nments against our interpretation of \u00a7922(g)(9).\n                              A\n  First, Castleman invokes \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s legislative history\nto suggest that Congress could not have intended for the\nprovision to apply to acts involving minimal force. But to\nthe extent that legislative history can aid in the inter-\npretation of this statute, Castleman\u2019s reliance on it is\nunpersuasive.\n  Castleman begins by observing that during the debate\nover \u00a7922(g)(9), several Senators argued that the provision\nwould help to prevent gun violence by perpetrators of\nsevere domestic abuse. Senator Lautenberg referred to\n\u201cserious spousal or child abuse\u201d and to \u201cviolent individu-\nals\u201d; Senator Hutchison to \u201c \u2018people who batter their\nwives\u2019 \u201d; Senator Wellstone to people who \u201cbrutalize\u201d their\nwives or children; and Senator Feinstein to \u201csevere and\nrecurring domestic violence.\u201d 142 Cong. Rec. 22985\u2013\n22986, 22988. But as we noted above, see supra, at 2, the\nimpetus of \u00a7922(g)(9) was that even perpetrators of severe\ndomestic violence are often convicted \u201cunder generally\napplicable assault or battery laws.\u201d Hayes, 555 U. S., at\n427. So nothing about these Senators\u2019 isolated references\nto severe domestic violence suggests that they would not\nhave wanted \u00a7922(g)(9) to apply to a misdemeanor assault\nconviction like Castleman\u2019s.\n  Castleman next observes that \u00a7922(g)(9) is the product\nof a legislative compromise. The provision originally\nbarred gun possession for any \u201ccrime of domestic violence,\u201d\ndefined as any \u201cfelony or misdemeanor crime of violence,\nregardless of length, term, or manner of punishment.\u201d 142\nCong. Rec. 5840. Congress rewrote the provision to re-\nquire the use of physical force in response to the concern\n\u201cthat the term crime of violence was too broad, and could\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbe interpreted to include an act such as cutting up a credit\ncard with a pair of scissors,\u201d id., at 26675. See Hayes, 555\nU. S., at 428. Castleman would have us conclude that\nCongress thus meant \u201cto narrow the scope of the statute to\nconvictions based on especially severe conduct.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 24. But all Congress meant to do was address\nthe fear that \u00a7922(g)(9) might be triggered by offenses in\nwhich no force at all was directed at a person. As Senator\nLautenberg noted, the revised text was not only \u201cmore\nprecise\u201d than the original but also \u201cprobably broader.\u201d 142\nCong. Rec. 26675.\n                            B\n   We are similarly unmoved by Castleman\u2019s invocation of\nthe rule of lenity. Castleman is correct that our \u201cconstruc-\ntion of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for\nfair warning.\u201d Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152,\n160 (1990). But \u201cthe rule of lenity only applies if, after\nconsidering text, structure, history, and purpose, there\nremains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the stat-\nute, such that the Court must simply guess as to what\nCongress intended.\u201d Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. 474, 488\n(2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nThat is not the case here.\n                              C\n  Finally, Castleman suggests\u2014in a single paragraph\u2014\nthat we should read \u00a7922(g)(9) narrowly because it impli-\ncates his constitutional right to keep and bear arms. But\nCastleman has not challenged the constitutionality of\n\u00a7922(g)(9), either on its face or as applied to him, and the\nmeaning of the statute is sufficiently clear that we need\nnot indulge Castleman\u2019s cursory nod to constitutional\navoidance concerns.\n                     *    *   *\n  Castleman\u2019s conviction for having \u201cintentionally or\n16             UNITED STATES v.

S. C.\n\u00a7 \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), and thus constitutes a \u201cmisdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence,\u201d \u00a7922(g)(9). I write separately,\nhowever, because I reach that conclusion on narrower\ngrounds.\n                               I\n  Our decision in Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133\n(2010), is the natural place to begin. Johnson is signifi-\ncant here because it concluded that \u201cthe phrase \u2018physical\nforce\u2019 means violent force\u2014that is, force capable of caus-\ning physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d Id., at\n140 (second emphasis added). This is an easy case if\nthe phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d has the same meaning in\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), the provision that defines \u201cmisdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7922(g)(9), as it\ndoes in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the provision interpreted in John-\nson, since it is impossible to cause bodily injury without\nusing force \u201ccapable of \u201d producing that result.\n  There are good reasons to give the phrase Johnson\u2019s\ninterpretation. One is the presumption of consistent\n2              UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nusage\u2014the rule of thumb that a term generally means the\nsame thing each time it is used. Although the presump-\ntion is most commonly applied to terms appearing in the\nsame enactment, e.g., IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21,\n33\u201334 (2005), it is equally relevant \u201cwhen Congress uses the\nsame language in two statutes having similar purposes,\u201d\nSmith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, 233 (2005)\n(plurality opinion); see also Northcross v. Board of Ed. of\nMemphis City Schools, 412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per\ncuriam). This case is a textbook candidate for application\nof the Smith-Northcross branch of the rule. The \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d clauses at issue here and in Johnson are worded in\nnearly identical fashion: The former defines a \u201cmisde-\nmeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d as an offense that\n\u201chas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical\nforce,\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), while the latter defines a \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d as an offense that \u201chas as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\nthe person of another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). And both statutes\nare designed to promote public safety by deterring a class\nof criminals from possessing firearms.\n   Respondent\u2019s arguments fail to overcome the presump-\ntion of consistent usage. In respondent\u2019s view, \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d cannot mean \u201cany force that produces any pain\nor bodily injury,\u201d Brief for Respondent 25, because\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) defines a violent crime and one can in-\nflict all sorts of minor injuries\u2014bruises, paper cuts,\netc.\u2014by engaging in nonviolent behavior. Respondent\ntherefore reasons that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires force capa-\nble of inflicting \u201cserious\u201d bodily injury. That requirement\nis more demanding than both of the plausible mean-\nings of \u201cphysical force\u201d we identified in Johnson: common-\nlaw offensive touching (which Johnson rejected) and force\ncapable of causing physical pain or injury, serious or\notherwise. See 559 U. S., at 138\u2013140. It would be surpas-\nsing strange to read a statute defining a \u201cmisdemeanor\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ncrime of domestic violence\u201d as requiring greater force than\nthe similarly worded statute in Johnson, which defined a\n\u201cviolent felony,\u201d and respondent does not make a convinc-\ning case for taking that extraordinary step.\n  For these reasons, I would give \u201cphysical force\u201d the same\nmeaning in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) as in Johnson. The rest of\nthe analysis is straightforward. Because \u201cintentionally or\nknowingly caus[ing] bodily injury,\u201d App. 27, categorically\ninvolves the use of \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain\nor injury to another person,\u201d 559 U. S., at 140, respond-\nent\u2019s 2001 domestic-assault conviction qualifies as a \u201cmis-\ndemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d under \u00a7922(g)(9).1\nI would reverse the judgment below on that basis and\nremand for further proceedings.\n                             II\n   Unfortunately, the Court bypasses that narrower inter-\npretation of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) in favor of a much broader\none that treats any offensive touching, no matter how\nslight, as sufficient. That expansive common-law defini-\ntion cannot be squared with relevant precedent or statu-\ntory text.\n   We have twice addressed the meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d\nin the context of provisions that define a class of violent\ncrimes. Both times, we concluded that \u201cphysical force\u201d\nmeans violent force. In Johnson, we thought it \u201cclear that\nin the context of a statutory definition of \u2018violent felony,\u2019\nthe phrase \u2018physical force\u2019 means violent force.\u201d Id., at\n140. And we held that common-law offensive touching\u2014\nthe same type of force the Court today holds does consti-\ntute \u201cphysical force\u201d\u2014is not sufficiently violent to satisfy\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Respondent argues at length that Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u201313\u2013111(b)\n\n(2013 Supp.) does not require the \u201cuse\u201d of physical force, since it is\npossible to cause bodily injury through deceit or other nonviolent\nmeans. Brief for Respondent 30\u201342. The argument fails for the rea-\nsons given by the Court. See ante, at 13.\n4                UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act\u2019s \u201cphysical force\u201d require-\nment. See id., at 140\u2013144. Our analysis in Johnson was\npremised in large part on our earlier interpretation of the\ngeneric federal \u201ccrime of violence\u201d statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a716.\nIn Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004), we observed\nthat \u00a716(a)\u2014which defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can\noffense that has as an element the use, attempted use,\nor threatened use of physical force against the person or\nproperty of another\u201d\u2014comprehends \u201ca category of vio-\nlent, active crimes.\u201d The textual similarity between\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\u2019s \u201cphysical force\u201d clause and the clauses\nat issue in Johnson and Leocal thus raises the question:\nWhy should the same meaning not apply here?\n   The Court gives four responses that merit discussion,\nnone of which withstands scrutiny. First, the Court in-\nvokes the \u201c \u2018settled principle of interpretation that, absent\nother indication, \u201cCongress intends to incorporate the\nwell-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 4 (quoting Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 3)). That principle is of limited\nrelevance, since the presumption of consistent statutory\nmeaning is precisely \u201cother indication\u201d that \u00a7921(a)(33)\n(A)(ii) does not incorporate the common-law meaning.\nAnyway, a more accurate formulation of the principle\ncited by the Court is that when \u201c \u2018a word is obviously\ntransplanted from another legal source, whether the\ncommon law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with\nit.\u2019 \u201d Sekhar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3\u20134) (quoting\nFrankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,\n47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947); emphasis added).\nSection 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) was enacted after the statutes\ninvolved in Johnson and Leocal,2 and its \u201cphysical force\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Section \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) was enacted in 1996.

But there is no\ninterpretive principle to the effect that statutes must be\ngiven their broadest possible application, and \u00a7922(g)(9)\nwithout offensive touching would have had application in\nfour-fifths of the States. Although domestic violence was\n\u201croutinely prosecuted\u201d under misdemeanor assault or bat-\ntery statutes when Congress enacted \u00a7922(g)(9), United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 427 (2009), and such stat-\nutes generally prohibited \u201cboth offensive touching and the\ncausation of bodily injury\u201d or \u201conly the latter,\u201d ante, at 9, it\ndoes not follow that interpreting \u201cphysical force\u201d to mean\nviolent force would have rendered \u00a7922(g)(9) a practical\nnullity. To the contrary, \u00a7922(g)(9) would have worked\nperfectly well in 38 of the 48 States that had misdemeanor\nassault or battery statutes at the time of \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s\nenactment. At that point, 19 States had statutes that\ncovered infliction of bodily injury but not offensive touch-\ning,3 and 19 more had statutes that prohibited both of\ntypes of conduct, but did so in a divisible manner\u2014thus\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201ccrime of violence\u201d statute discussed in Leocal was enacted in 1984, see\n\u00a71001, 98 Stat. 2136.\n  3 See Ala.

I think it far more plausible that Congress\nenacted a statute that covered domestic-violence convic-\ntions in four-fifths of the States, and left it to the handful\nof nonconforming States to change their laws (as some\nhave), than that Congress adopted a meaning of \u201cdomestic\nviolence\u201d that included the slightest unwanted touching.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See Ariz.

We properly take\naccount of the term being defined when interpreting \u201can\nunclear definitional phrase.\u201d United States v. Stevens, 559\nU. S. 460, 474 (2010); but see Babbitt v. Sweet Home\nChapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 717\u2013\n719 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But when we do so, we\nconsider the entire term being defined, not just part of it.\nHere, the term being defined is \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence.\u201d Applying the term-to-be-defined canon\nthus yields the unremarkable conclusion that \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the type of force in-\nvolved in violent misdemeanors (such as bodily-injury\noffenses) rather than nonviolent ones (such as offensive\ntouching).\n   Fourth, and finally, the Court seeks to evade Johnson\nand Leocal on the ground that \u201c \u2018domestic violence\u2019 encom-\npasses a range of force broader than that which con-\nstitutes \u2018violence\u2019 simpliciter.\u201d Ante, at 6, n. 4. That is\nto say, an act need not be violent to qualify as \u201cdomestic\nviolence.\u201d That absurdity is not only at war with the\nEnglish language, it is flatly inconsistent with defini-\ntions of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d from the period surrounding\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\u2019s enactment. At the time, dictionaries\ndefined \u201cdomestic violence\u201d as, for instance, \u201c[v]iolence\nbetween members of a household, usu. spouses; an assault\nor other violent act committed by one member of a house-\nhold against another,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1564 (7th\ned. 1999), and \u201c[v]iolence toward or physical abuse of one\u2019s\nspouse or domestic partner,\u201d American Heritage Diction-\nary 534 (4th ed. 2000).6 Those definitions, combined with\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 6 Definitions   of \u201cphysical force\u201d from the same period are also at odds\n8                 UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe absence of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d entries in earlier dic-\ntionaries, see, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 484 (6th ed.\n1990); American Heritage Dictionary 550 (3d ed. 1992),\nmake it utterly implausible that Congress adopted a \u201cterm\nof art\u201d definition \u201cencompassing acts that one might not\ncharacterize as \u2018violent\u2019 in a nondomestic context,\u201d ante,\nat 7.\n   The Court\u2019s inventive, nonviolent definition fares no\nbetter when judged against other accepted sources of\nmeaning. Current dictionaries give \u201cdomestic violence\u201d\nthe same meaning as above: ordinary violence that occurs\nin a domestic context. See, e.g., American Heritage Dic-\ntionary 533 (5th ed. 2011) (\u201c[p]hysical abuse of a house-\nhold member, especially one\u2019s spouse or domestic partner\u201d).\nThe same goes for definitions of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d\nfound in other federal statutes.7 Indeed, Congress defined\n\u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in\nanother section of the same bill that enacted \u00a7921(a)\n(33)(A)(ii). See \u00a7350(a), 110 Stat. 3009\u2013639, codified at\n8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E)(i).\n   The Court ignores these authorities and instead bases\nits definition on an amicus brief filed by the National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence and other private\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwith the Court\u2019s nonviolent interpretation of that phrase. See Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201c[f]orce consisting in a physical act,\nesp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim\u201d); id., at 1147 (6th\ned. 1990) (\u201c[f]orce applied to the body; actual violence\u201d).\n   7 See, e.g., 18 U.

For example, amici\u2019s\ndefinitions describe as \u201cdomestic violence\u201d acts that \u201chu-\nmiliate, isolate, frighten, . . . [and] blame . . . someone\u201d;\n\u201cacts of omission\u201d; \u201cexcessive monitoring of a woman\u2019s\nbehavior, repeated accusations of infidelity, and control-\nling with whom she has contact.\u201d Brief for National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae\n5\u20138, and nn. 7, 11. The offerings of the Department\nof Justice\u2019s Office on Violence Against Women are\nequally capacious and (to put it mildly) unconventional.\nIts publications define \u201cdomestic violence\u201d as \u201ca pattern\nof abusive behavior . . . used by one partner to gain\nor maintain power and control over another,\u201d including\n\u201c[u]ndermining an individual\u2019s sense of self-worth,\u201d\n\u201cname-calling,\u201d and \u201cdamaging one\u2019s relationship with\nhis or her children.\u201d See, e.g., Domestic Violence, online\nat http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/domviolence.htm (all Internet\nmaterials as visited Mar. 21, 2014, and available in the\nClerk of Court\u2019s case file).9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The  other organizations on the brief are the National Domestic\nViolence Hotline, the Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and\nAppeals Project, Legal Momentum, and innumerable state organiza-\ntions against domestic violence.\n   9 The Court refers in a footnote to two additional social-science defini-\n\ntions, neither of which aids the Court\u2019s cause. See ante, at 7, n. 5. The\nfirst is drawn from a health-care manual that provides \u201ca behavioral\ndefinition of domestic violence . . . rather than a legal definition, since a\n10                UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   Of course these private organizations and the Depart-\nment of Justice\u2019s (nonprosecuting) Office are entitled to\ndefine \u201cdomestic violence\u201d any way they want for their\nown purposes\u2014purposes that can include (quite literally)\ngiving all domestic behavior harmful to women a bad\nname. (What is more abhorrent than violence against\nwomen?) But when they (and the Court) impose their all-\nembracing definition on the rest of us, they not only\ndistort the law, they impoverish the language. When\neverything is domestic violence, nothing is. Congress will\nhave to come up with a new word (I cannot imagine what\nit would be) to denote actual domestic violence.\n   Although the Justice Department\u2019s definitions ought to\nbe deemed unreliable in toto on the basis of their extrava-\ngant extensions alone (falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus),\nthe Court chooses to focus only upon the physical actions\nthat they include, viz., \u201c[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grab-\nbing, pinching, biting, [and] hair pulling.\u201d Ibid. None of\nthose actions bears any real resemblance to mere offensive\ntouching, and all of them are capable of causing physical\npain or injury. Cf. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 143 (identifying\n\u201ca slap in the face\u201d as conduct that might rise to the level\nof violent force). And in any event, the Department of\nJustice thankfully receives no deference in our interpreta-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nbehavioral definition is more comprehensive and more relevant to the\nhealth care setting.\u201d A. Ganley, Understanding Domestic Violence, in\nImproving the Health Care Response to Domestic Violence: A Resource\nManual for Health Care Providers 18 (2d ed. 1996) (emphasis added),\nonline at http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/HealthCare/\nimproving_healthcare_manual_1.pdf. Here, of course, we are concerned\nwith the less comprehensive legal definition. The second definition\nreferred to in the footnote equates domestic violence with \u201covert vio-\nlence,\u201d which in its least serious form consists of \u201cpainful pinching or\nsqueezing.\u201d M. McCue, Domestic Violence: A Reference Handbook 6\n(1995) (emphasis added). That meaning is consistent with Johnson\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cphysical force,\u201d but it plainly does not include harmless\noffensive touching.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

The same ought to be said of advocacy organ-\nizations, such as amici, that (unlike dictionary publishers)\nhave a vested interest in expanding the definition of \u201cdo-\nmestic violence\u201d in order to broaden the base of individuals\neligible for support services.10\n                        *     *     *\n  This is a straightforward statutory-interpretation case\nthat the parties and the Court have needlessly complicated.\nPrecedent, text, and common sense all dictate that the\nterm \u201cphysical force,\u201d when used to define a \u201cmisdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence,\u201d requires force capable of caus-\ning physical pain or bodily injury.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 See, e.g., National Network to End Domestic Violence, Reauthorize\n\nThe Family Violence Prevention and Services Act 1 (Sept. 22, 2010)\n(advocating the expansion of a program assisting victims of domestic\nviolence to include victims of \u201cdating violence\u201d and thereby \u201censure that\nall victims in danger can access services\u201d), online at http://nnedv.org/\ndownloads/Policy/FVPSA_fact_sheet_9-22-10.pdf.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S. C. \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). In Johnson v. United States,\n559 U.

I disagreed and concluded that the\nphrase incorporated the well-established meaning of\n\u201cforce\u201d under the common law of battery, which did not\nrequire violent force. See id., at 146 (dissenting opinion).\n   The Court of Appeals in the present case understand-\nably followed the reasoning of Johnson, but now this Court\nholds that Johnson actually dictates that the identical\nstatutory language be interpreted in exactly the same way\nthat the Johnson majority rejected. See ante, at 5.\n   In my view, the meaning of the contested statutory\nlanguage is the same now as it was four years ago in\nJohnson, and therefore, for the reasons set out in my\nJohnson dissent, I would not extend the reasoning of\nJohnson to the question presented here, on which the\nJohnson Court specifically reserved judgment. 559 U.

CASTLEMAN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12\u20131371. Argued January 15, 2014\u2014Decided March 26, 2014\nRespondent Castleman moved to dismiss his indictment under 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9), which forbids the possession of firearms by any-\n  one convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d He ar-\n  gued that his previous conviction for \u201cintentionally or knowingly\n  caus[ing] bodily injury to\u201d the mother of his child, App. 27, did not\n  qualify as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d because it did\n  not involve \u201cthe use or attempted use of physical force,\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The District Court agreed, reasoning that \u201cphysi-\n  cal force\u201d must entail violent contact and that one can cause bodily\n  injury without violent contact, e.g., by poisoning. The Sixth Circuit\n  affirmed on a different rationale. It held that the degree of physical\n  force required for a conviction to constitute a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\n  domestic violence\u201d is the same as that required for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d\n  under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2014\n  namely, violent force\u2014and that Castleman could have been convicted\n  for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct.\nHeld: Castleman\u2019s conviction qualifies as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of do-\n mestic violence.\u201d Pp. 4\u201316.\n    (a) Section 922(g)(9)\u2019s \u201cphysical force\u201d requirement is satisfied by\n the degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction\u2014\n namely, offensive touching. Congress presumably intends to incorpo-\n rate the common-law meaning of terms that it uses, and nothing sug-\n gests Congress intended otherwise here. The Sixth Circuit relied up-\n on Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, in which the common-law\n meaning of \u201cforce\u201d was found to be a \u201ccomical misfit,\u201d id., at 145,\n when read into ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition. But Johnson re-\n solves this case in the Government\u2019s favor: The very reasons for re-\n jecting the common-law meaning in Johnson are reasons to embrace\n2                   UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    it here. First, whereas it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that Congress meant to in-\n    corporate in ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition \u201ca phrase that the\n    common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misde-\n    meanor,\u201d id., at 141, it is likely that Congress meant to incorporate\n    the misdemeanor-specific meaning of \u201cforce\u201d in defining a \u201cmisde-\n    meanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d Second, whereas the word \u201cvio-\n    lent\u201d or \u201cviolence\u201d standing alone \u201cconnotes a substantial degree of\n    force,\u201d id., at 140, that is not true of \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d which is a\n    term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as \u201cvi-\n    olent\u201d in a nondomestic context. Third, whereas this Court has hesi-\n    tated to apply ACCA to \u201ccrimes which, though dangerous, are not\n    typically committed by those whom one normally labels \u2018armed career\n    criminals,\u2019 \u201d Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137, 146, there is no\n    anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or\n    battery offenses together with others whom \u00a7922(g) disqualifies from\n    gun ownership. In addition, a contrary reading would have made\n    \u00a7922(g)(9) inoperative in at least ten States when it was enacted.\n    Pp. 4\u201310.\n       (b) Under this definition of \u201cphysical force,\u201d Castleman\u2019s conviction\n    qualifies as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d The appli-\n    cation of the modified categorical approach\u2014consulting Castleman\u2019s\n    state indictment to determine whether his conviction entailed the el-\n    ements necessary to constitute the generic federal offense\u2014is\n    straightforward. Castleman pleaded guilty to \u201cintentionally or know-\n    ingly caus[ing] bodily injury to\u201d the mother of his child, and the\n    knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves\n    the use of physical force. First, a \u201cbodily injury\u201d must result from\n    \u201cphysical force.\u201d The common-law concept of \u201cforce\u201d encompasses\n    even its indirect application, making it impossible to cause bodily in-\n    jury without applying force in the common-law sense. Second, the\n    knowing or intentional application of force is a \u201cuse\u201d of force. Leocal\n    v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, distinguished.

In Johnson,\nwe considered whether a battery conviction was a \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n\u00a7924(e)(1). As here, ACCA defines such a crime as one\nthat \u201chas as an element the use . . . of physical force,\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). We began by observing that at common\nlaw, the element of force in the crime of battery was \u201csatis-\nfied by even the slightest offensive touching.\u201d 559 U. S., at\n139 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 120 (1768)).2 And we recognized the general rule\nthat \u201ca common-law term of art should be given its estab-\nlished common-law meaning,\u201d except \u201cwhere that meaning\ndoes not fit.\u201d 559 U. S., at 139. We declined to read the\ncommon-law meaning of \u201cforce\u201d into ACCA\u2019s definition of a\n\u201cviolent felony,\u201d because we found it a \u201ccomical misfit with\nthe defined term.\u201d Id., at 145; see United States v. Ste-\nvens, 559 U. S. 460, 474 (2010) (\u201c[A]n unclear definitional\nphrase may take meaning from the term to be defined\u201d).\nIn defining a \u201c \u2018violent felony,\u2019 \u201d we held, \u201cthe phrase \u2018physi-\ncal force\u2019 \u201d must \u201cmea[n] violent force.\u201d Johnson, 559 U. S.,\nat 140. But here, the common-law meaning of \u201cforce\u201d fits\nperfectly: The very reasons we gave for rejecting that\nmeaning in defining a \u201cviolent felony\u201d are reasons to em-\nbrace it in defining a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201d3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 We explained that the word \u201cphysical\u201d did not add much to the word\n\n\u201cforce,\u201d except to distinguish \u201cforce exerted by and through concrete\nbodies . . . from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force.\u201d\nJohnson, 559 U. S., at 138.\n   3 Johnson specifically reserved the question whether our definition of\n\n\u201cphysical force\u201d would extend to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9). 559 U. S., at\n143\u2013144. And these reasons for declining to extend Johnson\u2019s defini-\ntion to \u00a7922(g)(9) serve equally to rebut the \u201cpresumption of consistent\nusage\u201d on which JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence heavily relies, post, at\n1\u20132, 4.\n6                 UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n    First, because perpetrators of domestic violence are\n\u201croutinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault\nor battery laws,\u201d Hayes, 555 U. S., at 427, it makes sense\nfor Congress to have classified as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d the type of conduct that supports a\ncommon-law battery conviction. Whereas it was \u201cunlikely\u201d\nthat Congress meant to incorporate in the definition of a\n\u201c \u2018violent felony\u2019 a phrase that the common law gave pecu-\nliar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,\u201d\nJohnson, 559 U. S., at 141, it is likely that Congress\nmeant to incorporate that misdemeanor-specific meaning\nof \u201cforce\u201d in defining a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201d\n    Second, whereas the word \u201cviolent\u201d or \u201cviolence\u201d stand-\ning alone \u201cconnotes a substantial degree of force,\u201d id., at\n140,4 that is not true of \u201cdomestic violence.\u201d \u201cDomestic\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 This portion of Johnson\u2019s analysis relied heavily on Leocal v. Ash-\n\ncroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), in which we interpreted the meaning of a\n\u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U. S. C. \u00a716. As in Johnson and here, the\nstatute defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in part as one \u201cthat has as an\nelement the use . . . of physical force,\u201d \u00a716(a). In support of our holding\nin Johnson, we quoted Leocal\u2019s observation that \u201c \u2018[t]he ordinary mean-\ning of [a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d] . . . suggests a category of violent, active\ncrimes.\u2019 \u201d 559 U. S., at 140 (quoting 543 U. S., at 11).\n  The Courts of Appeals have generally held that mere offensive\ntouching cannot constitute the \u201cphysical force\u201d necessary to a \u201ccrime of\nviolence,\u201d just as we held in Johnson that it could not constitute the\n\u201cphysical force\u201d necessary to a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d See Karimi v. Holder,\n715 F. 3d 561, 566\u2013568 (CA4 2013); Singh v. Ashcroft, 386 F. 3d 1228,\n1233 (CA9 2004); Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003);\nUnited States v.

See Brief for National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae\n4\u20139; DOJ, Office on Violence Against Women, Domestic\nViolence (defining physical forms of domestic violence to\ninclude \u201c[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching,\nbiting, [and] hair pulling\u201d), online at http://www.ovw.\nusdoj.gov/domviolence.htm.5 Indeed, \u201cmost physical as-\nsaults committed against women and men by intimates\nare relatively minor and consist of pushing, grabbing,\nshoving, slapping, and hitting.\u201d DOJ, P. Tjaden & N.\nThoennes, Extent, Nature and Consequences of Intimate\nPartner Violence 11 (2000).\n  Minor uses of force may not constitute \u201cviolence\u201d in the\ngeneric sense. For example, in an opinion that we cited\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nviolence\u201d under \u00a716. Matter of Velasquez, 25 I. & N. Dec. 278, 282\n(2010). Nothing in today\u2019s opinion casts doubt on these holdings,\nbecause\u2014as we explain\u2014\u201cdomestic violence\u201d encompasses a range of\nforce broader than that which constitutes \u201cviolence\u201d simpliciter.\n  We note, as does JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence, post, at 8, and n. 7,\nthat federal law elsewhere defines \u201cdomestic violence\u201d in more limited\nterms: For example, a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act\ndefines a \u201c \u2018crime of domestic violence\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany crime of violence (as\ndefined by [18 U. S. C. \u00a716])\u201d committed against a qualifying relation. 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E)(i). Our view that \u201cdomestic violence\u201d encom-\npasses acts that might not constitute \u201cviolence\u201d in a nondomestic\ncontext does not extend to a provision like this, which specifically\ndefines \u201cdomestic violence\u201d by reference to a generic \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d\n  5 See also    A.

Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d\n666, 670 (2003). But an act of this nature is easy to de-\nscribe as \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d when the accumulation of\nsuch acts over time can subject one intimate partner to the\nother\u2019s control. If a seemingly minor act like this draws\nthe attention of authorities and leads to a successful pros-\necution for a misdemeanor offense, it does not offend\ncommon sense or the English language to characterize the\nresulting conviction as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201d\n   JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence discounts our reference to\nsocial-science definitions of \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d including\nthose used by the organizations most directly engaged\nwith the problem and thus most aware of its dimensions.\nSee post, at 8\u201311. It is important to keep in mind, how-\never, that the operative phrase we are construing is not\n\u201cdomestic violence\u201d; it is \u201cphysical force.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A).\n\u201cPhysical force\u201d has a presumptive common-law meaning,\nand the question is simply whether that presumptive\nmeaning makes sense in defining a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence.\u201d6\n   A third reason for distinguishing Johnson\u2019s definition of\n\u201cphysical force\u201d is that unlike in Johnson\u2014where a deter-\nmination that the defendant\u2019s crime was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d\nwould have classified him as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d\u2014\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The concurrence\u2019s reliance on definitions of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d in\n\nother statutory provisions, see post, at 8, and n. 7, is similarly unper-\nsuasive. These other provisions show that when Congress wished to\ndefine \u201cdomestic violence\u201d as a type of \u201cviolence\u201d simpliciter, it knew\nhow to do so. That it did not do so here suggests, if anything, that it did\nnot mean to. See, e.g., Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485, 492\n(1994). This also answers the concurrence\u2019s suggestion, post, at 10,\nthat our holding will somehow make it difficult for Congress to define\n\u201cdomestic violence\u201d\u2014where it wants to\u2014as requiring violent force.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

Section 922(g) bars\ngun possession by anyone \u201caddicted to any controlled\nsubstance,\u201d \u00a7922(g)(3); by most people who have \u201cbeen\nadmitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant\nvisa,\u201d \u00a7922(g)(5)(B); by anyone who has renounced United\nStates citizenship, \u00a7922(g)(7); and by anyone subject to a\ndomestic restraining order, \u00a7922(g)(8). Whereas we have\nhesitated (as in Johnson) to apply the Armed Career\nCriminal Act to \u201ccrimes which, though dangerous, are not\ntypically committed by those whom one normally labels\n\u2018armed career criminals,\u2019 \u201d Begay v. United States, 553\nU. S. 137, 146 (2008), we see no anomaly in grouping\ndomestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery\noffenses together with the others whom \u00a7922(g) disquali-\nfies from gun ownership.\n   An additional reason to read the statute as we do is that\na contrary reading would have rendered \u00a7922(g)(9) inoper-\native in many States at the time of its enactment. The\n\u201cassault or battery laws\u201d under which \u201cdomestic abusers\nwere . . . routinely prosecuted\u201d when Congress enacted\n\u00a7922(g)(9), and under which many are still prosecuted\ntoday, Hayes, 555 U.

See Johnson, 559 U. S., at 139\u2013140. So\nif offensive touching did not constitute \u201cforce\u201d under\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A), then \u00a7922(g)(9) would have been ineffec-\ntual in at least 10 States\u2014home to nearly thirty percent of\nthe Nation\u2019s population7\u2014at the time of its enactment.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 7 See   U.

Hayes, 555\nU.

Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u201313\u2013\n111(b). A provision incorporated by reference, \u00a739\u201313\u2013\n101, defined three types of assault: \u201c(1) [i]ntentionally,\nknowingly or recklessly caus[ing] bodily injury to another;\n(2) [i]ntentionally or knowingly caus[ing] another to rea-\nsonably fear imminent bodily injury; or (3) [i]ntentionally\nor knowingly caus[ing] physical contact with another\u201d in a\nmanner that a \u201creasonable person would regard . . . as\nextremely offensive or provocative.\u201d \u00a739\u201313\u2013101(a).\n   It does not appear that every type of assault defined by\n\u00a739\u201313\u2013101 necessarily involves \u201cthe use or attempted use\nof physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,\u201d\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A).      A threat under \u00a739\u201313\u2013101(2) may\nnot necessarily involve a deadly weapon, and the merely\nreckless causation of bodily injury under \u00a739\u201313\u2013101(1)\nmay not be a \u201cuse\u201d of force.8\n   But we need not decide whether a domestic assault\nconviction in Tennessee categorically constitutes a \u201cmis-\ndemeanor crime of domestic violence,\u201d because the parties\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 We  held in Leocal that \u201c \u2018use\u2019 requires active employment,\u201d rather\n\u201cthan negligent or merely accidental conduct.\u201d 543 U.

Al-\nthough Leocal reserved the question whether a reckless application of\nforce could constitute a \u201cuse\u201d of force, id., at 13, the Courts of Appeals\nhave almost uniformly held that recklessness is not sufficient.

CASTLEMAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndo not contest that \u00a739\u201313\u2013101 is a \u201c \u2018divisible statute,\u2019 \u201d\nDescamps v. United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,\nat 1). We may accordingly apply the modified categorical\napproach, consulting the indictment to which Castleman\npleaded guilty in order to determine whether his convic-\ntion did entail the elements necessary to constitute the\ngeneric federal offense. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1\u20132); see\nShepard, 544 U. S., at 26. Here, that analysis is straight-\nforward: Castleman pleaded guilty to having \u201cintentionally\nor knowingly cause[d] bodily injury\u201d to the mother of his\nchild, App. 27, and the knowing or intentional causation of\nbodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.\n   First, a \u201cbodily injury\u201d must result from \u201cphysical force.\u201d\nUnder Tennessee law, \u201cbodily injury\u201d is a broad term: It\n\u201cincludes a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn or disfigurement;\nphysical pain or temporary illness or impairment of the\nfunction of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.\u201d\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u201311\u2013106(a)(2) (1997). JUSTICE SCA-\nLIA\u2019s concurrence suggests that these forms of injury ne-\ncessitate violent force, under Johnson\u2019s definition of that\nphrase. Post, at 3. But whether or not that is so\u2014a\nquestion we do not decide\u2014these forms of injury do neces-\nsitate force in the common-law sense.\n   The District Court thought otherwise, reasoning that\none can cause bodily injury \u201cwithout the \u2018use of physical\nforce\u2019 \u201d\u2014for example, by \u201cdeceiving [the victim] into drink-\ning a poisoned beverage, without making contact of any\nkind.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a. But as we explained in\nJohnson, \u201cphysical force\u201d is simply \u201cforce exerted by and\nthrough concrete bodies,\u201d as opposed to \u201cintellectual force\nor emotional force.\u201d 559 U. S., at 138. And the common-\nlaw concept of \u201cforce\u201d encompasses even its indirect ap-\nplication. \u201cForce\u201d in this sense \u201cdescrib[es] one of the\nelements of the common-law crime of battery,\u201d id., at 139,\nand \u201c[t]he force used\u201d in battery \u201cneed not be applied\ndirectly to the body of the victim.\u201d 2 W.

It is impossible to cause\nbodily injury without applying force in the common-law\nsense.\n   Second, the knowing or intentional application of force\nis a \u201cuse\u201d of force. Castleman is correct that under Leocal\nv. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), the word \u201cuse\u201d \u201cconveys the\nidea that the thing used (here, \u2018physical force\u2019) has been\nmade the user\u2019s instrument.\u201d Brief for Respondent 37.\nBut he errs in arguing that although \u201c[p]oison may have\n\u2018forceful physical properties\u2019 as a matter of organic chemis-\ntry, . . . no one would say that a poisoner \u2018employs\u2019 force or\n\u2018carries out a purpose by means of force\u2019 when he or\nshe sprinkles poison in a victim\u2019s drink,\u201d ibid. The \u201cuse\nof force\u201d in Castleman\u2019s example is not the act of\n\u201csprinkl[ing]\u201d the poison; it is the act of employing poison\nknowingly as a device to cause physical harm. That the\nharm occurs indirectly, rather than directly (as with a kick\nor punch), does not matter. Under Castleman\u2019s logic, after\nall, one could say that pulling the trigger on a gun is not a\n\u201cuse of force\u201d because it is the bullet, not the trigger, that\nactually strikes the victim. Leocal held that the \u201cuse\u201d of\nforce must entail \u201ca higher degree of intent than negligent\nor merely accidental conduct,\u201d 543 U. S., at 9; it did not\nhold that the word \u201cuse\u201d somehow alters the meaning of\n\u201cforce.\u201d\n   Because Castleman\u2019s indictment makes clear that the\nuse of physical force was an element of his conviction, that\nconviction qualifies as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201d\n14            UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                           III\n We are not persuaded by Castleman\u2019s nontextual argu-\nments against our interpretation of \u00a7922(g)(9).\n                              A\n  First, Castleman invokes \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s legislative history\nto suggest that Congress could not have intended for the\nprovision to apply to acts involving minimal force. But to\nthe extent that legislative history can aid in the inter-\npretation of this statute, Castleman\u2019s reliance on it is\nunpersuasive.\n  Castleman begins by observing that during the debate\nover \u00a7922(g)(9), several Senators argued that the provision\nwould help to prevent gun violence by perpetrators of\nsevere domestic abuse. Senator Lautenberg referred to\n\u201cserious spousal or child abuse\u201d and to \u201cviolent individu-\nals\u201d; Senator Hutchison to \u201c \u2018people who batter their\nwives\u2019 \u201d; Senator Wellstone to people who \u201cbrutalize\u201d their\nwives or children; and Senator Feinstein to \u201csevere and\nrecurring domestic violence.\u201d 142 Cong. Rec. 22985\u2013\n22986, 22988. But as we noted above, see supra, at 2, the\nimpetus of \u00a7922(g)(9) was that even perpetrators of severe\ndomestic violence are often convicted \u201cunder generally\napplicable assault or battery laws.\u201d Hayes, 555 U. S., at\n427. So nothing about these Senators\u2019 isolated references\nto severe domestic violence suggests that they would not\nhave wanted \u00a7922(g)(9) to apply to a misdemeanor assault\nconviction like Castleman\u2019s.\n  Castleman next observes that \u00a7922(g)(9) is the product\nof a legislative compromise. The provision originally\nbarred gun possession for any \u201ccrime of domestic violence,\u201d\ndefined as any \u201cfelony or misdemeanor crime of violence,\nregardless of length, term, or manner of punishment.\u201d 142\nCong. Rec. 5840. Congress rewrote the provision to re-\nquire the use of physical force in response to the concern\n\u201cthat the term crime of violence was too broad, and could\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbe interpreted to include an act such as cutting up a credit\ncard with a pair of scissors,\u201d id., at 26675. See Hayes, 555\nU. S., at 428. Castleman would have us conclude that\nCongress thus meant \u201cto narrow the scope of the statute to\nconvictions based on especially severe conduct.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 24. But all Congress meant to do was address\nthe fear that \u00a7922(g)(9) might be triggered by offenses in\nwhich no force at all was directed at a person. As Senator\nLautenberg noted, the revised text was not only \u201cmore\nprecise\u201d than the original but also \u201cprobably broader.\u201d 142\nCong. Rec. 26675.\n                            B\n   We are similarly unmoved by Castleman\u2019s invocation of\nthe rule of lenity. Castleman is correct that our \u201cconstruc-\ntion of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for\nfair warning.\u201d Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152,\n160 (1990). But \u201cthe rule of lenity only applies if, after\nconsidering text, structure, history, and purpose, there\nremains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the stat-\nute, such that the Court must simply guess as to what\nCongress intended.\u201d Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. 474, 488\n(2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nThat is not the case here.\n                              C\n  Finally, Castleman suggests\u2014in a single paragraph\u2014\nthat we should read \u00a7922(g)(9) narrowly because it impli-\ncates his constitutional right to keep and bear arms. But\nCastleman has not challenged the constitutionality of\n\u00a7922(g)(9), either on its face or as applied to him, and the\nmeaning of the statute is sufficiently clear that we need\nnot indulge Castleman\u2019s cursory nod to constitutional\navoidance concerns.\n                     *    *   *\n  Castleman\u2019s conviction for having \u201cintentionally or\n16             UNITED STATES v.

S. C.\n\u00a7 \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), and thus constitutes a \u201cmisdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence,\u201d \u00a7922(g)(9). I write separately,\nhowever, because I reach that conclusion on narrower\ngrounds.\n                               I\n  Our decision in Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133\n(2010), is the natural place to begin. Johnson is signifi-\ncant here because it concluded that \u201cthe phrase \u2018physical\nforce\u2019 means violent force\u2014that is, force capable of caus-\ning physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d Id., at\n140 (second emphasis added). This is an easy case if\nthe phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d has the same meaning in\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), the provision that defines \u201cmisdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7922(g)(9), as it\ndoes in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the provision interpreted in John-\nson, since it is impossible to cause bodily injury without\nusing force \u201ccapable of \u201d producing that result.\n  There are good reasons to give the phrase Johnson\u2019s\ninterpretation. One is the presumption of consistent\n2              UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nusage\u2014the rule of thumb that a term generally means the\nsame thing each time it is used. Although the presump-\ntion is most commonly applied to terms appearing in the\nsame enactment, e.g., IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21,\n33\u201334 (2005), it is equally relevant \u201cwhen Congress uses the\nsame language in two statutes having similar purposes,\u201d\nSmith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, 233 (2005)\n(plurality opinion); see also Northcross v. Board of Ed. of\nMemphis City Schools, 412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per\ncuriam). This case is a textbook candidate for application\nof the Smith-Northcross branch of the rule. The \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d clauses at issue here and in Johnson are worded in\nnearly identical fashion: The former defines a \u201cmisde-\nmeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d as an offense that\n\u201chas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical\nforce,\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), while the latter defines a \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d as an offense that \u201chas as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\nthe person of another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). And both statutes\nare designed to promote public safety by deterring a class\nof criminals from possessing firearms.\n   Respondent\u2019s arguments fail to overcome the presump-\ntion of consistent usage. In respondent\u2019s view, \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d cannot mean \u201cany force that produces any pain\nor bodily injury,\u201d Brief for Respondent 25, because\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) defines a violent crime and one can in-\nflict all sorts of minor injuries\u2014bruises, paper cuts,\netc.\u2014by engaging in nonviolent behavior. Respondent\ntherefore reasons that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires force capa-\nble of inflicting \u201cserious\u201d bodily injury. That requirement\nis more demanding than both of the plausible mean-\nings of \u201cphysical force\u201d we identified in Johnson: common-\nlaw offensive touching (which Johnson rejected) and force\ncapable of causing physical pain or injury, serious or\notherwise. See 559 U. S., at 138\u2013140. It would be surpas-\nsing strange to read a statute defining a \u201cmisdemeanor\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

The rest of\nthe analysis is straightforward. Because \u201cintentionally or\nknowingly caus[ing] bodily injury,\u201d App. 27, categorically\ninvolves the use of \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain\nor injury to another person,\u201d 559 U. S., at 140, respond-\nent\u2019s 2001 domestic-assault conviction qualifies as a \u201cmis-\ndemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d under \u00a7922(g)(9).1\nI would reverse the judgment below on that basis and\nremand for further proceedings.\n                             II\n   Unfortunately, the Court bypasses that narrower inter-\npretation of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) in favor of a much broader\none that treats any offensive touching, no matter how\nslight, as sufficient. That expansive common-law defini-\ntion cannot be squared with relevant precedent or statu-\ntory text.\n   We have twice addressed the meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d\nin the context of provisions that define a class of violent\ncrimes. Both times, we concluded that \u201cphysical force\u201d\nmeans violent force. In Johnson, we thought it \u201cclear that\nin the context of a statutory definition of \u2018violent felony,\u2019\nthe phrase \u2018physical force\u2019 means violent force.\u201d Id., at\n140. And we held that common-law offensive touching\u2014\nthe same type of force the Court today holds does consti-\ntute \u201cphysical force\u201d\u2014is not sufficiently violent to satisfy\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Respondent argues at length that Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u201313\u2013111(b)\n\n(2013 Supp.) does not require the \u201cuse\u201d of physical force, since it is\npossible to cause bodily injury through deceit or other nonviolent\nmeans. Brief for Respondent 30\u201342. The argument fails for the rea-\nsons given by the Court. See ante, at 13.\n4                UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act\u2019s \u201cphysical force\u201d require-\nment. See id., at 140\u2013144. Our analysis in Johnson was\npremised in large part on our earlier interpretation of the\ngeneric federal \u201ccrime of violence\u201d statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a716.\nIn Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004), we observed\nthat \u00a716(a)\u2014which defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can\noffense that has as an element the use, attempted use,\nor threatened use of physical force against the person or\nproperty of another\u201d\u2014comprehends \u201ca category of vio-\nlent, active crimes.\u201d The textual similarity between\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\u2019s \u201cphysical force\u201d clause and the clauses\nat issue in Johnson and Leocal thus raises the question:\nWhy should the same meaning not apply here?\n   The Court gives four responses that merit discussion,\nnone of which withstands scrutiny. First, the Court in-\nvokes the \u201c \u2018settled principle of interpretation that, absent\nother indication, \u201cCongress intends to incorporate the\nwell-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 4 (quoting Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 3)). That principle is of limited\nrelevance, since the presumption of consistent statutory\nmeaning is precisely \u201cother indication\u201d that \u00a7921(a)(33)\n(A)(ii) does not incorporate the common-law meaning.\nAnyway, a more accurate formulation of the principle\ncited by the Court is that when \u201c \u2018a word is obviously\ntransplanted from another legal source, whether the\ncommon law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with\nit.\u2019 \u201d Sekhar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3\u20134) (quoting\nFrankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,\n47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947); emphasis added).\nSection 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) was enacted after the statutes\ninvolved in Johnson and Leocal,2 and its \u201cphysical force\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Section \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) was enacted in 1996.

But there is no\ninterpretive principle to the effect that statutes must be\ngiven their broadest possible application, and \u00a7922(g)(9)\nwithout offensive touching would have had application in\nfour-fifths of the States. Although domestic violence was\n\u201croutinely prosecuted\u201d under misdemeanor assault or bat-\ntery statutes when Congress enacted \u00a7922(g)(9), United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 427 (2009), and such stat-\nutes generally prohibited \u201cboth offensive touching and the\ncausation of bodily injury\u201d or \u201conly the latter,\u201d ante, at 9, it\ndoes not follow that interpreting \u201cphysical force\u201d to mean\nviolent force would have rendered \u00a7922(g)(9) a practical\nnullity. To the contrary, \u00a7922(g)(9) would have worked\nperfectly well in 38 of the 48 States that had misdemeanor\nassault or battery statutes at the time of \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s\nenactment. At that point, 19 States had statutes that\ncovered infliction of bodily injury but not offensive touch-\ning,3 and 19 more had statutes that prohibited both of\ntypes of conduct, but did so in a divisible manner\u2014thus\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201ccrime of violence\u201d statute discussed in Leocal was enacted in 1984, see\n\u00a71001, 98 Stat. 2136.\n  3 See Ala.

Compare Hayes, supra, at 427\n(rejecting an interpretation that supposedly would have\nrendered \u00a7922(g)(9) \u201c \u2018a dead letter\u2019 in some two-thirds of\nthe States\u201d). I think it far more plausible that Congress\nenacted a statute that covered domestic-violence convic-\ntions in four-fifths of the States, and left it to the handful\nof nonconforming States to change their laws (as some\nhave), than that Congress adopted a meaning of \u201cdomestic\nviolence\u201d that included the slightest unwanted touching.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See Ariz.

We properly take\naccount of the term being defined when interpreting \u201can\nunclear definitional phrase.\u201d United States v. Stevens, 559\nU. S. 460, 474 (2010); but see Babbitt v. Sweet Home\nChapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 717\u2013\n719 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But when we do so, we\nconsider the entire term being defined, not just part of it.\nHere, the term being defined is \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence.\u201d Applying the term-to-be-defined canon\nthus yields the unremarkable conclusion that \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the type of force in-\nvolved in violent misdemeanors (such as bodily-injury\noffenses) rather than nonviolent ones (such as offensive\ntouching).\n   Fourth, and finally, the Court seeks to evade Johnson\nand Leocal on the ground that \u201c \u2018domestic violence\u2019 encom-\npasses a range of force broader than that which con-\nstitutes \u2018violence\u2019 simpliciter.\u201d Ante, at 6, n. 4. That is\nto say, an act need not be violent to qualify as \u201cdomestic\nviolence.\u201d That absurdity is not only at war with the\nEnglish language, it is flatly inconsistent with defini-\ntions of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d from the period surrounding\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\u2019s enactment. At the time, dictionaries\ndefined \u201cdomestic violence\u201d as, for instance, \u201c[v]iolence\nbetween members of a household, usu. spouses; an assault\nor other violent act committed by one member of a house-\nhold against another,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1564 (7th\ned. 1999), and \u201c[v]iolence toward or physical abuse of one\u2019s\nspouse or domestic partner,\u201d American Heritage Diction-\nary 534 (4th ed. 2000).6 Those definitions, combined with\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 6 Definitions   of \u201cphysical force\u201d from the same period are also at odds\n8                 UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe absence of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d entries in earlier dic-\ntionaries, see, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 484 (6th ed.\n1990); American Heritage Dictionary 550 (3d ed. 1992),\nmake it utterly implausible that Congress adopted a \u201cterm\nof art\u201d definition \u201cencompassing acts that one might not\ncharacterize as \u2018violent\u2019 in a nondomestic context,\u201d ante,\nat 7.\n   The Court\u2019s inventive, nonviolent definition fares no\nbetter when judged against other accepted sources of\nmeaning. Current dictionaries give \u201cdomestic violence\u201d\nthe same meaning as above: ordinary violence that occurs\nin a domestic context. See, e.g., American Heritage Dic-\ntionary 533 (5th ed. 2011) (\u201c[p]hysical abuse of a house-\nhold member, especially one\u2019s spouse or domestic partner\u201d).\nThe same goes for definitions of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d\nfound in other federal statutes.7 Indeed, Congress defined\n\u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in\nanother section of the same bill that enacted \u00a7921(a)\n(33)(A)(ii). See \u00a7350(a), 110 Stat. 3009\u2013639, codified at\n8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E)(i).\n   The Court ignores these authorities and instead bases\nits definition on an amicus brief filed by the National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence and other private\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwith the Court\u2019s nonviolent interpretation of that phrase. See Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201c[f]orce consisting in a physical act,\nesp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim\u201d); id., at 1147 (6th\ned. 1990) (\u201c[f]orce applied to the body; actual violence\u201d).\n   7 See, e.g., 18 U.

See ante, at 7, n. 5. The\nfirst is drawn from a health-care manual that provides \u201ca behavioral\ndefinition of domestic violence . . . rather than a legal definition, since a\n10                UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   Of course these private organizations and the Depart-\nment of Justice\u2019s (nonprosecuting) Office are entitled to\ndefine \u201cdomestic violence\u201d any way they want for their\nown purposes\u2014purposes that can include (quite literally)\ngiving all domestic behavior harmful to women a bad\nname. (What is more abhorrent than violence against\nwomen?) But when they (and the Court) impose their all-\nembracing definition on the rest of us, they not only\ndistort the law, they impoverish the language. When\neverything is domestic violence, nothing is. Congress will\nhave to come up with a new word (I cannot imagine what\nit would be) to denote actual domestic violence.\n   Although the Justice Department\u2019s definitions ought to\nbe deemed unreliable in toto on the basis of their extrava-\ngant extensions alone (falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus),\nthe Court chooses to focus only upon the physical actions\nthat they include, viz., \u201c[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grab-\nbing, pinching, biting, [and] hair pulling.\u201d Ibid. None of\nthose actions bears any real resemblance to mere offensive\ntouching, and all of them are capable of causing physical\npain or injury. Cf. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 143 (identifying\n\u201ca slap in the face\u201d as conduct that might rise to the level\nof violent force). And in any event, the Department of\nJustice thankfully receives no deference in our interpreta-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nbehavioral definition is more comprehensive and more relevant to the\nhealth care setting.\u201d A.

Here, of course, we are concerned\nwith the less comprehensive legal definition. The second definition\nreferred to in the footnote equates domestic violence with \u201covert vio-\nlence,\u201d which in its least serious form consists of \u201cpainful pinching or\nsqueezing.\u201d M. McCue, Domestic Violence: A Reference Handbook 6\n(1995) (emphasis added).

The same ought to be said of advocacy organ-\nizations, such as amici, that (unlike dictionary publishers)\nhave a vested interest in expanding the definition of \u201cdo-\nmestic violence\u201d in order to broaden the base of individuals\neligible for support services.10\n                        *     *     *\n  This is a straightforward statutory-interpretation case\nthat the parties and the Court have needlessly complicated.\nPrecedent, text, and common sense all dictate that the\nterm \u201cphysical force,\u201d when used to define a \u201cmisdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence,\u201d requires force capable of caus-\ning physical pain or bodily injury.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 See, e.g., National Network to End Domestic Violence, Reauthorize\n\nThe Family Violence Prevention and Services Act 1 (Sept. 22, 2010)\n(advocating the expansion of a program assisting victims of domestic\nviolence to include victims of \u201cdating violence\u201d and thereby \u201censure that\nall victims in danger can access services\u201d), online at http://nnedv.org/\ndownloads/Policy/FVPSA_fact_sheet_9-22-10.pdf.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

JAMES ALVIN \n\n                 CASTLEMAN\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 26, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.\n   The decision in this case turns on the meaning of the\nphrase \u201chas, as an element, the use . . . of physical force.\u201d\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). In Johnson v. United States,\n559 U. S. 133 (2010), the Court interpreted the very same\nlanguage and held that \u201cphysical force\u201d means \u201cviolent\nforce.\u201d Id., at 140. I disagreed and concluded that the\nphrase incorporated the well-established meaning of\n\u201cforce\u201d under the common law of battery, which did not\nrequire violent force. See id., at 146 (dissenting opinion).\n   The Court of Appeals in the present case understand-\nably followed the reasoning of Johnson, but now this Court\nholds that Johnson actually dictates that the identical\nstatutory language be interpreted in exactly the same way\nthat the Johnson majority rejected. See ante, at 5.\n   In my view, the meaning of the contested statutory\nlanguage is the same now as it was four years ago in\nJohnson, and therefore, for the reasons set out in my\nJohnson dissent, I would not extend the reasoning of\nJohnson to the question presented here, on which the\nJohnson Court specifically reserved judgment. 559 U. S.,\nat 143\u2013144.\n</pre>",
