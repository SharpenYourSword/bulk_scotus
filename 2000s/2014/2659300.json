GINSBERG\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 12\u2013462.      Argued December 3, 2013\u2014Decided April 2, 2014\nPetitioner Northwest, Inc., terminated respondent\u2019s membership in its\n  frequent flyer program, apparently based on a provision in the fre-\n  quent flyer agreement that gave Northwest sole discretion to deter-\n  mine whether a participant had abused the program. Respondent\n  filed suit, asserting, as relevant here, that Northwest had breached\n  its contract by revoking his membership status without valid cause\n  and had violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing because it\n  terminated his membership in a way that contravened his reasonable\n  expectations. The District Court found that the Airline Deregulation\n  Act of 1978 (ADA) pre-empted the breach of the duty of good faith\n  and fair dealing claim and dismissed the breach of contract claim\n  without prejudice. Respondent appealed only the dismissal of his\n  breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim. The Ninth\n  Circuit reversed, finding that claim \u201c \u2018too tenuously connected to air-\n  line regulation to trigger\u2019 \u201d ADA pre-emption.\nHeld:\n    1. The ADA pre-empts a state-law claim for breach of the implied\n covenant of good faith and fair dealing if it seeks to enlarge the con-\n tractual obligations that the parties voluntarily adopt. Pp. 4\u201310.\n       (a) Before the ADA was enacted, air carriers\u2019 routes, rates, and\n services were regulated under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. And\n because that Act contained a saving provision preserving pre-existing\n statutory and common-law remedies, air carriers were also regulated\n by the States. The ADA did not repeal that saving provision, but it\n did include a pre-emption provision to prohibit States from \u201cen-\n act[ing] or enforc[ing] a law, regulation, or other provision having the\n force and effect of law related to [an air carrier\u2019s] price, route, or ser-\n vice,\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a741713(b)(1), thus ensuring that \u201cStates would not\n2                   NORTHWEST, INC. v.

In Morales, the Court\n    recognized that the key phrase \u201crelated to\u201d expresses a \u201cbroad pre-\n    emptive purpose,\u201d id., at 383, and held that the ADA pre-empted the\n    use of state consumer protection laws to regulate airline advertising,\n    concluding that \u201crelat[es] to\u201d means \u201cha[s] a connection with, or ref-\n    erence to, airline \u2018rates, routes, or services,\u2019 \u201d id., at 384. And in\n    American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219, the Court found that\n    the ADA pre-empted the use of an Illinois consumer law to challenge\n    an airline\u2019s devaluation of frequent flyer earned miles. But it did not\n    pre-empt breach of contract claims because \u201cterms and conditions air-\n    lines offer and passengers accept are privately ordered obligations\u201d\n    not \u201c \u2018a State\u2019s \u201cenact[ment] or enforce[ment] [of] any law, rule, regu-\n    lation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law\u201d\n    within the [pre-emption provision\u2019s] meaning.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 228\u2013229.\n    Pp. 4\u20136.\n         (b) The phrase \u201cother provision having the force and effect of\n    law\u201d includes state common-law rules like the implied covenant at is-\n    sue. Common-law rules are routinely called \u201cprovisions,\u201d see, e.g.,\n    Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 765, n. 3, and\n    they clearly have \u201cthe force and effect of law.\u201d The pre-emption pro-\n    vision\u2019s original language confirms this understanding. As first en-\n    acted, the provision also applied to \u201crule[s]\u201d and \u201cstandard[s],\u201d a for-\n    mulation encompassing common-law rules. See CSX Transp., Inc. v.\n    Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658, 664. And Congress made clear that the\n    deletion of those terms as part of Title 49\u2019s wholesale recodification\n    effected no \u201csubstantive change.\u201d \u00a71(a), 108 Stat. 745.\n       Respondent\u2019s reliance on Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S.\n    51, is misplaced. There, the Court held that the Federal Boat Safety\n    Act of 1971 did not pre-empt a common-law tort claim, but that Act\u2019s\n    pre-emption provision is more narrowly worded than the ADA provi-\n    sion. The Boat Safety Act\u2019s saving and pre-emption provisions were\n    also enacted at the same time, while the Federal Aviation Act\u2019s gen-\n    eral remedies saving clause is \u201ca relic of the pre-ADA/no pre-emption\n    regime,\u201d Morales, 504 U. S., at 385, that \u201ccannot be allowed to super-\n    sede the specific substantive pre-emption provision,\u201d ibid.\n       Exempting common-law claims would also disserve the ADA\u2019s cen-\n    tral purpose, which was to eliminate federal regulation of rates,\n    routes, and services so they could be set by market forces. Finally, if\n    all state common-law rules fell outside the pre-emption provision\u2019s\n    ambit, Wolens would not have singled out a subcategory, for common-\n    law claims based on the parties\u2019 voluntary undertaking, as falling\n    outside that provision\u2019s coverage. Pp. 6\u20139.\n         (c) Respondent\u2019s claim \u201crelates to\u201d \u201crates, routes, or services.\u201d It\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  clearly has \u201ca connection with or reference to airline\u201d prices, routes,\n  or services, Morales, 504 U. S., at 384. As in Wolens, Northwest\u2019s\n  program connects to the airline\u2019s \u201crates\u201d by awarding mileage credits\n  redeemable for tickets and upgrades, thus eliminating or reducing\n  ticket prices. It also connects to \u201cservices,\u201d i.e., access to flights and\n  higher service categories. Respondent\u2019s counterarguments are un-\n  persuasive. His claim that he is contesting his termination, not ac-\n  cess to flights or upgrades, ignores his reason for seeking reinstate-\n  ment: to obtain reduced rates and enhanced services. Although\n  respondent and amici claim there have been fundamental changes in\n  the way that frequent flyer miles are earned since Wolens was decid-\n  ed, that does not matter here where respondent did not assert that he\n  earned miles from any activity but taking flights or that he attempt-\n  ed to redeem miles for anything but tickets and upgrades. Pp. 9\u201310.\n     2. Because respondent\u2019s implied covenant claim seeks to enlarge\n  his contractual agreement with petitioners, it is pre-empted by\n  \u00a741713(b)(1). Under Minnesota law, which controls here, the implied\n  covenant must be regarded as a state-imposed obligation. Minnesota\n  law does not permit parties to contract out of the covenant. And\n  when a State\u2019s law does not authorize parties to free themselves from\n  the covenant, a breach of covenant claim is pre-empted under Wolens.\n  As an independent basis for this conclusion, if, as Minnesota law pro-\n  vides, the implied covenant applies to \u201cevery contract\u201d except em-\n  ployment contracts for \u201cpolicy reasons,\u201d then the decision not to ex-\n  empt other types of contracts must likewise be based on a policy\n  determination, namely, that the policy reason for the employment\n  contract rule does not apply in other contexts.\n     Petitioners claim that the refusal to pre-empt all implied covenant\n  claims, regardless of state law, will lead to a patchwork of rules that\n  will frustrate the ADA\u2019s deregulatory aim. But airlines can avoid\n  such a result if they contract out of covenants where permitted by\n  state law. Nor are participants in frequent flyer programs left with-\n  out protection. They can avoid an airline with a poor reputation and\n  possibly enroll in a more favorable rival program. Moreover, the De-\n  partment of Transportation has the authority to investigate com-\n  plaints about frequent flyer programs. Finally, respondent might\n  have been able to vindicate his claim of ill treatment by Northwest\n  had he appealed his breach of contract claim.

RABBI S.\n           BINYOMIN GINSBERG\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                [April 2, 2014]\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   We must decide in this case whether the Airline Deregu\u00ad\nlation Act pre-empts a state-law claim for breach of the\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Following\nour interpretation of the Act in American Airlines, Inc. v.\nWolens, 513 U. S. 219 (1995), we hold that such a claim is\npre-empted if it seeks to enlarge the contractual obliga\u00ad\ntions that the parties voluntarily adopt. And because the\ndoctrine is invoked in the present case in an attempt to\nexpand those obligations, we reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  Like many airlines, petitioner Northwest, Inc. (North\u00ad\nwest), established a frequent flyer program, its World-\nPerks Airline Partners Program, to attract loyal cus\u00ad\ntomers. Under this program, members are able to earn\n\u201cmiles\u201d by taking flights operated by Northwest and other\n\u201cpartner\u201d airlines. Members can then redeem these miles\nfor tickets and service upgrades with Northwest or its\nairline partners.\n2              NORTHWEST, INC. v. GINSBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    Respondent became a member of Northwest\u2019s World-\nPerks program in 1999, and as a result of extensive\ntravel on Northwest flights, he achieved \u201cPlatinum Elite\u201d\nstatus (the highest level available) in 2005.\n    In 2008, however, Northwest terminated respondent\u2019s\nmembership, apparently in reliance on a provision of the\nWorldPerks agreement that provided that \u201c[a]buse of the . . .\nprogram (including . . . improper conduct as determined\n by [Northwest] in its sole judgment[ ) ] . . . may result in\ncancellation of the member\u2019s account.\u201d App. 64\u201365. Ac\u00ad\ncording to respondent, a Northwest representative tele\u00ad\nphoned him in June 2008 and informed him that his\n\u201cPlatinum Elite\u201d status was being revoked because he had\n\u201c \u2018abused\u2019 \u201d the program. Id., at 35. In a letter sent about\ntwo weeks later, Northwest wrote:\n    \u201c[Y]ou have contacted our office 24 times since De\u00ad\n    cember 3, 2007 regarding travel problems, including\n    9 incidents of your bag arriving late at the luggage\n    carousel. . . .\n         .          .          .          .         .\n    \u201c Since December 3, 2007, you have continually asked\n    for compensation over and above our guidelines. We\n    have awarded you $1,925.00 in travel credit vouchers,\n    78,500 WorldPerks bonus miles, a voucher extension\n    for your son, and $491.00 in cash reimbursements. . . .\n\n    \u201c Due to our past generosity, we must respectfully\n    advise that we will no longer be awarding you com\u00ad\n    pensation each time you contact us.\u201d Id., at 58\u201359.\nRespondent requested clarification of his status, but a\nNorthwest representative sent him an e-mail stating that\n\u201c[a]fter numerous conversations with not only the Legal\nDepartment, but with members of the WorldPerks de\u00ad\npartment, I believe your status with the program should\nbe very clear.\u201d Id., at 60.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   Alleging that Northwest had ended his membership as\na cost-cutting measure tied to Northwest\u2019s merger with\nDelta Air Lines, respondent filed a class action in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia on behalf of himself and all other similarly\nsituated WorldPerks members. Respondent\u2019s complaint\nasserted four separate claims.1 First, his complaint al\u00ad\nleged that Northwest had breached its contract by re\u00ad\nvoking his \u201cPlatinum Elite\u201d status without valid cause.\nSecond, the complaint claimed that Northwest violated the\nduty of good faith and fair dealing because it terminated\nhis membership in a way that contravened his reasonable\nexpectations with respect to the manner in which North\u00ad\nwest would exercise its discretion. Third, the complaint\nasserted a claim for negligent misrepresentation, and\nfourth, the complaint alleged intentional misrepresenta\u00ad\ntion. Respondent sought damages in excess of $5 million,\nas well as injunctive relief requiring Northwest to restore\nthe class members\u2019 WorldPerks status and prohibiting\nNorthwest from future revocations of membership.\n   The District Court held that respondent\u2019s claims for\nbreach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\nnegligent misrepresentation, and intentional misrepresen\u00ad\ntation were pre-empted by the Airline Deregulation Act of\n1978 (ADA or Act) as amended, 49 U. S. C. \u00a741713. These\nclaims, the court concluded, were \u201crelate[d] to\u201d North\u00ad\nwest\u2019s rates and services and thus fell within the ADA\u2019s\nexpress pre-emption clause. App. to Pet. for Cert. 69.\nRespondent\u2019s remaining claim\u2014for breach of contract\u2014\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Applying California choice-of-law rules, the District Court held that\n\nMinnesota law applies because respondent \u201cwas a resident of Minneap\u00ad\nolis, appears to fly in and out of Minnesota, and Northwest\u2019s principal\nplace of business is Minnesota.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 70. That deter\u00ad\nmination was not challenged on appeal.\n4              NORTHWEST, INC. v. GINSBERG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwas dismissed without prejudice under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court held that respondent\nhad failed to identify any material breach because the\nfrequent flyer agreement gave Northwest sole discretion to\ndetermine whether a participant had abused the program.\nRespondent appealed the dismissal of his breach of the\nduty of good faith and fair dealing claim but not the other\nclaims that the court had dismissed.\n    The Ninth Circuit reversed. 695 F. 3d 873 (2012).\nRelying on pre-Wolens Circuit precedent, the Ninth Cir\u00ad\ncuit first held that a breach of implied covenant claim is\n\u201c \u2018too tenuously connected to airline regulation to trigger\npreemption under the ADA.\u2019 \u201d 695 F. 3d, at 879. Such\na claim, the Ninth Circuit wrote, \u201cdoes not interfere with\nthe [Act\u2019s] deregulatory mandate\u201d and does not \u201c \u2018force\nthe Airlines to adopt or change their prices, routes or\nservices\u2014the prerequisite for . . . preemption.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 880.\nIn addition, the Court held that the covenant of good faith\nand fair dealing does not fall within the terms of the Act\u2019s\npre-emption provision because it does not have a \u201cdirect\neffect\u201d on either \u201cprices\u201d or \u201cservices.\u201d Id., at 877, 881.\n    We granted certiorari. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                               II\n\n                                A\n\n  Before the enactment of the ADA, the Federal Aviation Act\nof 1958 empowered the Civil Aeronautics Board to regulate\nthe interstate airline industry. Pursuant to this authority,\nthe Board closely regulated air carriers, controlling, among\nother things, routes, rates, and services. See, e.g., Western\nAir Lines, Inc. v. CAB, 347 U. S. 67 (1954); Federal Aviation\nAct of 1958, 72 Stat. 731. And since the Federal Aviation Act\ncontained a saving provision preserving pre-existing statu\u00ad\ntory and common-law remedies, \u00a71106, id., at 798, air carriers\nwere also regulated by the States. See Morales v. Trans\nWorld Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 378 (1992).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 1978, however, Congress enacted the ADA, which\nsought to promote \u201cefficiency, innovation, and low prices\u201d\nin the airline industry through \u201cmaximum reliance on\ncompetitive market forces and on actual and potential\ncompetition.\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a740101(a)(6), (12)(A). While the\nADA did not repeal the predecessor law\u2019s saving provision,\nit included a pre-emption provision in order to \u201censure\nthat the States would not undo federal deregulation with\nregulation of their own.\u201d Morales supra, at 378. In its\ncurrent form, this provision states that \u201ca State, political\nsubdivision of a State, or political authority of at least 2\nStates may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other\nprovision having the force and effect of law related to a\nprice, route, or service of an air carrier that may provide\nair transportation under this subpart.\u201d \u00a741713(b)(1).\n   We have had two occasions to consider the ADA\u2019s pre\u00ad\nemptive reach.      In Morales, we held that the ADA\npre-empted the use of state consumer protection laws to\nregulate airline advertising. We recognized that the key\nphrase \u201crelated to\u201d expresses a \u201cbroad pre-emptive pur\u00ad\npose.\u201d 504 U. S., at 383. Noting our interpretation of\nsimilar language in the pre-emption provision of the Em\u00ad\nployee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974, 29\nU. S. C. \u00a71144(a), we held that a claim \u201crelat[es] to rates,\nroutes, or services,\u201d within the meaning of the ADA, if the\nclaim \u201cha[s] a connection with, or reference to, airline\n\u2018rates, routes, or services.\u2019 \u201d 504 U. S., at 384. The older\nsaving provision, we concluded, did not undermine this\nconclusion. Id., at 384\u2013385.\n   Subsequently, in American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513\nU. S. 219 (1995), we considered the application of the ADA\npre-emption provision to two types of claims concerning an\nairline\u2019s frequent flyer program: first, claims under the\nIllinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices\nAct challenging an airline\u2019s devaluation of earned miles\n(chiefly as the result of the imposition of \u201cblackout dates\u201d\n6              NORTHWEST, INC. v.

We reaffirmed Morales\u2019\nbroad interpretation of the ADA pre-emption provision\nand held that this provision barred the claims based on\nthe Illinois statute but not the breach-of-contract claims.\n\u201c[T]erms and conditions airlines offer and passengers\naccept,\u201d we wrote, \u201care privately ordered obligations and\nthus do not amount to a State\u2019s \u2018enact[ment] or en\u00ad\nforce[ment] [of] any law, rule, regulation, standard, or\nother provision having the force and effect of law\u2019 within\nthe meaning of [the ADA pre-emption provision].\u201d 513\nU. S., at 228\u2013229.\n   With this background in mind, we turn to the question\nwhether the ADA pre-empts respondent\u2019s claim for breach\nof the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n                              B\n  The first question we address is whether, as respondent\nnow maintains, the ADA\u2019s pre-emption provision applies\nonly to legislation enacted by a state legislature and regu\u00ad\nlations issued by a state administrative agency but not to\na common-law rule like the implied covenant of good faith\nand fair dealing. We have little difficulty rejecting this\nargument.\n  To begin, state common-law rules fall comfortably with\u00ad\nin the language of the ADA pre-emption provision. As\nnoted above, the current version of this provision applies\nto state \u201claw[s], regulation[s], or other provision[s] having\nthe force and effect of law,\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a741713(b)(1). It is\nroutine to call common-law rules \u201cprovisions.\u201d See, e.g.,\nMadsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753,\n765, n. 3 (1994); United States v. Barnett, 376 U. S. 681,\n689\u2013700 (1964); Brown v. United Airlines, Inc., 720 F. 3d\n60, 68 (CA1 2013) (\u201c[W]hen read in context, the word\n\u2018provision\u2019 in the ADA preemption provision can most\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

And\na common-law rule clearly has \u201cthe force and effect of\nlaw.\u201d In Wolens, we noted that this phrase is most natu\u00ad\nrally read to \u201c \u2018refe[r] to binding standards of conduct that\noperate irrespective of any private agreement,\u2019 \u201d 513 U. S.,\nat 229, n. 5, and we see no basis for holding that such\nstandards must be based on a statute or regulation as\nopposed to the common law.\n  This understanding becomes even clearer when the\noriginal wording of the pre-emption provision is taken into\naccount. When first enacted in 1978, this provision also\napplied to \u201crule[s]\u201d and \u201cstandard[s],\u201d and there surely can\nbe no doubt that this formulation encompassed common\u00ad\nlaw rules. Indeed, we held in CSX Transp., Inc. v. East-\nerwood, 507 U. S. 658, 664 (1993), that virtually identical\nlanguage in the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 in\u00ad\ncludes \u201c[l]egal duties imposed . . . by the common law.\u201d\nSee also Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. 312, 324\n(2008) (holding that a State\u2019s \u201c \u2018requirements\u2019 \u201d \u201cinclud[e]\n[the state\u2019s] common-law duties\u201d).\n  While \u201crule[s]\u201d and \u201cstandard[s]\u201d are not mentioned in\nthe current version of the statute, this omission is the\nresult of a recodification that was not meant to affect the\nprovision\u2019s meaning. Those additional terms were deleted\nas part of a wholesale recodification of Title 49 in 1994,\nbut Congress made it clear that this recodification did not\neffect any \u201csubstantive change.\u201d \u00a7 1(a), 108 Stat. 745.\n  In arguing that common-law rules fall outside the scope\nof the ADA pre-emption provision, respondent relies on\nour decision in Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51\n(2002), which held that the Federal Boat Safety Act of\n1971 did not pre-empt a common-law tort claim, but there\nare critical differences between the pre-emption provisions\nin the Boat Safety Act and the ADA. The Boat Safety Act\nprovision applies only to \u201ca law or regulation,\u201d 46 U. S. C.\n\u00a74306, whereas the ADA provision, as just explained, is\n8              NORTHWEST, INC. v. GINSBERG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmuch more broadly worded.\n   In addition, the relationship between the ADA\u2019s pre\u00ad\nemption provision and the saving provision carried over\nfrom the prior law is also quite different. The Sprietsma\ndecision placed substantial weight on the Boat Safety Act\u2019s\nsaving provision, which was enacted at the same time as\nthe pre-emption provision, but we have described the\nFederal Aviation Act saving clause as \u201ca relic of the pre\u00ad\nADA/no pre-emption regime.\u201d Morales, 504 U. S., at 385.\nThat provision applies to the entire, sprawling Federal\nAviation Act, and not just to the ADA, and as we held in\nMorales, this \u201cgeneral \u2018remedies\u2019 saving clause cannot be\nallowed to supersede the specific substantive pre-emption\nprovision.\u201d     Ibid.    See also Wolens, supra, at 245\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent\u00ad\ning in part). For these reasons, respondent\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of the ADA pre-emption provision cannot be squared\nwith the provision\u2019s terms.\n   Exempting common-law claims would also disserve the\ncentral purpose of the ADA. The Act eliminated federal\nregulation of rates, routes, and services in order to allow\nthose aspects of air transportation to be set by market\nforces, and the pre-emption provision was included to pre\u00ad\nvent the States from undoing what the Act was meant to\naccomplish. Morales, supra, at 378. What is important,\ntherefore, is the effect of a state law, regulation, or provi\u00ad\nsion, not its form, and the ADA\u2019s deregulatory aim can be\nundermined just as surely by a state common-law rule as it\ncan by a state statute or regulation. See Medtronic, Inc.,\nsupra, at 325 (recognizing that state tort law that imposes\ncertain requirements would \u201cdisrup[t] the federal scheme\nno less than state regulatory law to the same effect\u201d). As\nthe First Circuit has recognized, \u201c[i]t defies logic to think\nthat Congress would disregard real-world consequences and\ngive dispositive effect to the form of a clear intrusion into a\nfederally regulated industry.\u201d Brown, 720 F. 3d, at 66\u201367.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Finally, if all state common-law rules fell outside the\nambit of the ADA\u2019s pre-emption provision, we would have\nhad no need in Wolens to single out a subcategory of common\u00ad\nlaw claims, i.e., those based on the parties\u2019 voluntary under\u00ad\ntaking, as falling outside that provision\u2019s coverage.\n  Accordingly, we conclude that the phrase \u201cother provi\u00ad\nsion having the force and effect of law\u201d includes common\u00ad\nlaw claims.\n                               C\n   We must next determine whether respondent\u2019s breach of\nimplied covenant claim \u201crelates to\u201d \u201crates, routes, or ser\u00ad\nvices.\u201d A claim satisfies this requirement if it has \u201ca con\u00ad\nnection with, or reference to, airline\u201d prices, routes, or\nservices, Morales, supra, at 384, and the claim at issue\nhere clearly has such a connection. That claim seeks\nrespondent\u2019s reinstatement in Northwest\u2019s frequent flyer\nprogram so that he can access the program\u2019s \u201cvaluable . . .\nbenefits,\u201d including \u201cflight upgrades, accumulated mile\u00ad\nage, loyalty program status or benefits on other airlines,\nand other advantages.\u201d App. 49\u201350.\n   Like the frequent flyer program in Wolens, the North\u00ad\nwest program is connected to the airline\u2019s \u201crates\u201d because\nthe program awards mileage credits that can be redeemed\nfor tickets and upgrades. See 513 U. S., at 226. When\nmiles are used in this way, the rate that a customer pays,\ni.e., the price of a particular ticket, is either eliminated or\nreduced. The program is also connected to \u201cservices,\u201d i.e.,\naccess to flights and to higher service categories. Ibid.\n   Respondent argues that his claim differs from the\nclaims in Wolens because he \u201cdoes not challenge access to\nflights and upgrades or the number of miles needed to\nobtain air tickets\u201d but instead contests \u201cthe termination of\nhis WorldPerks elite membership,\u201d Brief for Respondent\n12, but this argument ignores respondent\u2019s reason for\nseeking reinstatement of his membership, i.e., to obtain\n10             NORTHWEST, INC. v. GINSBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreduced rates and enhanced services. Respondent\u2019s prof\u00ad\nfered distinction has no substance.\n   Respondent and amici suggest that Wolens is not control\u00ad\nling because frequent flyer programs have fundamentally\nchanged since the time of that decision. We are told that\n\u201cmost miles [are now] earned without consuming airline\nservices\u201d and are \u201cspent without consuming airline ser\u00ad\nvices.\u201d Brief for State of California et al. 18 (emphasis\ndeleted). But whether or not this alleged change might\nhave some impact in a future case, it is not implicated here.\nIn this case, respondent did not assert that he earned his\nmiles from any activity other than taking flights or that he\nattempted to redeem miles for anything other than tickets\nand upgrades. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\u201348.\n                             III\n   With these preliminary issues behind us, we turn to the\ncentral issue in this case, i.e., whether respondent\u2019s im\u00ad\nplied covenant claim is based on a state-imposed obliga\u00ad\ntion or simply one that the parties voluntarily undertook.\nPetitioners urge us to hold that implied covenant claims\nare always pre-empted, and respondent suggests that such\nclaims are generally not pre-empted, but the reasoning of\nWolens neither dooms nor spares all such claims.\n   While most States recognize some form of the good faith\nand fair dealing doctrine, it does not appear that there is\nany uniform understanding of the doctrine\u2019s precise mean\u00ad\ning. \u201c[T]he concept of good faith in the performance of\ncontracts \u2018is a phrase without general meaning (or mean\u00ad\nings) of its own.\u2019 \u201d Tymshare, Inc. v.

Corbin, Corbin on Contracts\n\u00a7654A, p. 88 (L. Cunningham & A. Jacobsen eds. Supp.\n1994). When the law of a State does not authorize parties\nto free themselves from the covenant, a breach of covenant\nclaim is pre-empted under the reasoning of Wolens.\n   Another feature of Minnesota law provides an addition\u00ad\nal, independent basis for our conclusion. Minnesota law\nholds that the implied covenant applies to \u201cevery con\u00ad\ntract,\u201d In re Hennepin Cty., supra, at 502, with the notable\nexception of employment contracts. Hunt v. IBM Mid\nAmerica Employees Fed. Credit Union, 384 N. W. 2d 853,\n857\u2013858 (Minn. 1986). The exception for employment\ncontracts is based, in significant part, on \u201cpolicy reasons,\u201d\nid., at 858, and therefore the decision not to exempt other\ntypes of contracts must be based on a policy determina\u00ad\ntion, namely, that the \u201cpolicy reasons\u201d that support the\nrule for employment contracts do not apply (at least with\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   But other States permit a party to contract out of the duties imposed\nby the implied covenant.

When the application of\nthe implied covenant depends on state policy, a breach\nof implied covenant claim cannot be viewed as simply an\nattempt to vindicate the parties\u2019 implicit understanding of\nthe contract.\n   For these reasons, the breach of implied covenant claim\nin this case cannot stand, but petitioners exhort us to go\nfurther and hold that all such claims, no matter the con\u00ad\ntent of the law of the relevant jurisdiction, are pre-empted.\nIf pre-emption depends on state law, petitioners warn,\nairlines will be faced with a baffling patchwork of rules,\nand the deregulatory aim of the ADA will be frustrated.\nBut the airlines have means to avoid such a result. A\nState\u2019s implied covenant rules will escape pre-emption\nonly if the law of the relevant State permits an airline to\ncontract around those rules in its frequent flyer program\nagreement, and if an airline\u2019s agreement is governed by\nthe law of such a State, the airline can specify that the\nagreement does not incorporate the covenant. While the\ninclusion of such a provision may impose transaction costs\nand presumably would not enhance the attractiveness of\nthe program, an airline can decide whether the benefits of\nsuch a provision are worth the potential costs.\n   Our holding also does not leave participants in frequent\nflyer programs without protection. The ADA is based on\nthe view that the best interests of airline passengers are\nmost effectively promoted, in the main, by allowing the\nfree market to operate. If an airline acquires a reputation\nfor mistreating the participants in its frequent flyer pro\u00ad\ngram (who are generally the airline\u2019s most loyal and valu\u00ad\nable customers), customers can avoid that program and\nmay be able to enroll in a more favorable rival program.\n   Federal law also provides protection for frequent flyer\nprogram participants. Congress has given the Depart\u00ad\nment of Transportation (DOT) the general authority to\nprohibit and punish unfair and deceptive practices in air\n14               NORTHWEST, INC. v.

C. \u00a741712(a), and Congress has specifically author\u00ad\nized the DOT to investigate complaints relating to fre\u00ad\nquent flyer programs.       See FAA Modernization and\nReform Act of 2012, \u00a7408(6), 126 Stat. 87. Pursuant to\nthese provisions, the DOT regularly entertains and acts on\nsuch complaints.3\n  We note, finally, that respondent\u2019s claim of ill treatment\nby Northwest might have been vindicated if he had pur\u00ad\nsued his breach-of-contract claim after its dismissal by the\nDistrict Court. Respondent argues that, contrary to the\nholding of the District Court, the frequent flyer agreement\ndid not actually give Northwest unfettered discretion to\nterminate his membership in the program, see Brief for\nRespondent 20\u201321, and the United States makes a related\nargument, namely, that even if the agreement gave\nNorthwest complete discretion with respect to a determi\u00ad\nnation regarding abuse of the program, the agreement did\nnot necessarily bar a claim asserting that membership\nwas ended for an ulterior reason, such as an effort to cut\ncosts. If respondent had appealed the dismissal of his\nbreach-of-contract claim, he could have presented these\narguments to the Court of Appeals, but he chose not to\npress that claim. He voluntarily dismissed the breach-of\u00ad\ncontract claim and instead appealed only the breach of\nimplied covenant claim, which we hold to be pre-empted.\n                       *    *     *\n  Because respondent\u2019s implied covenant of good faith\nand fair dealing claim seeks to enlarge his contractual\nagreement with petitioners, we hold that 49 U.

The District Court found that the Airline Deregulation\n  Act of 1978 (ADA) pre-empted the breach of the duty of good faith\n  and fair dealing claim and dismissed the breach of contract claim\n  without prejudice. Respondent appealed only the dismissal of his\n  breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim. The Ninth\n  Circuit reversed, finding that claim \u201c \u2018too tenuously connected to air-\n  line regulation to trigger\u2019 \u201d ADA pre-emption.\nHeld:\n    1. The ADA pre-empts a state-law claim for breach of the implied\n covenant of good faith and fair dealing if it seeks to enlarge the con-\n tractual obligations that the parties voluntarily adopt. Pp. 4\u201310.\n       (a) Before the ADA was enacted, air carriers\u2019 routes, rates, and\n services were regulated under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. And\n because that Act contained a saving provision preserving pre-existing\n statutory and common-law remedies, air carriers were also regulated\n by the States. The ADA did not repeal that saving provision, but it\n did include a pre-emption provision to prohibit States from \u201cen-\n act[ing] or enforc[ing] a law, regulation, or other provision having the\n force and effect of law related to [an air carrier\u2019s] price, route, or ser-\n vice,\u201d 49 U.

In Morales, the Court\n    recognized that the key phrase \u201crelated to\u201d expresses a \u201cbroad pre-\n    emptive purpose,\u201d id., at 383, and held that the ADA pre-empted the\n    use of state consumer protection laws to regulate airline advertising,\n    concluding that \u201crelat[es] to\u201d means \u201cha[s] a connection with, or ref-\n    erence to, airline \u2018rates, routes, or services,\u2019 \u201d id., at 384. And in\n    American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219, the Court found that\n    the ADA pre-empted the use of an Illinois consumer law to challenge\n    an airline\u2019s devaluation of frequent flyer earned miles. But it did not\n    pre-empt breach of contract claims because \u201cterms and conditions air-\n    lines offer and passengers accept are privately ordered obligations\u201d\n    not \u201c \u2018a State\u2019s \u201cenact[ment] or enforce[ment] [of] any law, rule, regu-\n    lation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law\u201d\n    within the [pre-emption provision\u2019s] meaning.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 228\u2013229.\n    Pp. 4\u20136.\n         (b) The phrase \u201cother provision having the force and effect of\n    law\u201d includes state common-law rules like the implied covenant at is-\n    sue. Common-law rules are routinely called \u201cprovisions,\u201d see, e.g.,\n    Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 765, n. 3, and\n    they clearly have \u201cthe force and effect of law.\u201d The pre-emption pro-\n    vision\u2019s original language confirms this understanding. As first en-\n    acted, the provision also applied to \u201crule[s]\u201d and \u201cstandard[s],\u201d a for-\n    mulation encompassing common-law rules. See CSX Transp., Inc. v.\n    Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658, 664. And Congress made clear that the\n    deletion of those terms as part of Title 49\u2019s wholesale recodification\n    effected no \u201csubstantive change.\u201d \u00a71(a), 108 Stat. 745.\n       Respondent\u2019s reliance on Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S.\n    51, is misplaced. There, the Court held that the Federal Boat Safety\n    Act of 1971 did not pre-empt a common-law tort claim, but that Act\u2019s\n    pre-emption provision is more narrowly worded than the ADA provi-\n    sion. The Boat Safety Act\u2019s saving and pre-emption provisions were\n    also enacted at the same time, while the Federal Aviation Act\u2019s gen-\n    eral remedies saving clause is \u201ca relic of the pre-ADA/no pre-emption\n    regime,\u201d Morales, 504 U. S., at 385, that \u201ccannot be allowed to super-\n    sede the specific substantive pre-emption provision,\u201d ibid.\n       Exempting common-law claims would also disserve the ADA\u2019s cen-\n    tral purpose, which was to eliminate federal regulation of rates,\n    routes, and services so they could be set by market forces. Finally, if\n    all state common-law rules fell outside the pre-emption provision\u2019s\n    ambit, Wolens would not have singled out a subcategory, for common-\n    law claims based on the parties\u2019 voluntary undertaking, as falling\n    outside that provision\u2019s coverage. Pp. 6\u20139.\n         (c) Respondent\u2019s claim \u201crelates to\u201d \u201crates, routes, or services.\u201d It\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  clearly has \u201ca connection with or reference to airline\u201d prices, routes,\n  or services, Morales, 504 U. S., at 384. As in Wolens, Northwest\u2019s\n  program connects to the airline\u2019s \u201crates\u201d by awarding mileage credits\n  redeemable for tickets and upgrades, thus eliminating or reducing\n  ticket prices. It also connects to \u201cservices,\u201d i.e., access to flights and\n  higher service categories. Respondent\u2019s counterarguments are un-\n  persuasive. His claim that he is contesting his termination, not ac-\n  cess to flights or upgrades, ignores his reason for seeking reinstate-\n  ment: to obtain reduced rates and enhanced services. Although\n  respondent and amici claim there have been fundamental changes in\n  the way that frequent flyer miles are earned since Wolens was decid-\n  ed, that does not matter here where respondent did not assert that he\n  earned miles from any activity but taking flights or that he attempt-\n  ed to redeem miles for anything but tickets and upgrades. Pp. 9\u201310.\n     2. Because respondent\u2019s implied covenant claim seeks to enlarge\n  his contractual agreement with petitioners, it is pre-empted by\n  \u00a741713(b)(1). Under Minnesota law, which controls here, the implied\n  covenant must be regarded as a state-imposed obligation. Minnesota\n  law does not permit parties to contract out of the covenant. And\n  when a State\u2019s law does not authorize parties to free themselves from\n  the covenant, a breach of covenant claim is pre-empted under Wolens.\n  As an independent basis for this conclusion, if, as Minnesota law pro-\n  vides, the implied covenant applies to \u201cevery contract\u201d except em-\n  ployment contracts for \u201cpolicy reasons,\u201d then the decision not to ex-\n  empt other types of contracts must likewise be based on a policy\n  determination, namely, that the policy reason for the employment\n  contract rule does not apply in other contexts.\n     Petitioners claim that the refusal to pre-empt all implied covenant\n  claims, regardless of state law, will lead to a patchwork of rules that\n  will frustrate the ADA\u2019s deregulatory aim. But airlines can avoid\n  such a result if they contract out of covenants where permitted by\n  state law. Nor are participants in frequent flyer programs left with-\n  out protection. They can avoid an airline with a poor reputation and\n  possibly enroll in a more favorable rival program. Moreover, the De-\n  partment of Transportation has the authority to investigate com-\n  plaints about frequent flyer programs. Finally, respondent might\n  have been able to vindicate his claim of ill treatment by Northwest\n  had he appealed his breach of contract claim.

Following\nour interpretation of the Act in American Airlines, Inc. v.\nWolens, 513 U. S. 219 (1995), we hold that such a claim is\npre-empted if it seeks to enlarge the contractual obliga\u00ad\ntions that the parties voluntarily adopt. And because the\ndoctrine is invoked in the present case in an attempt to\nexpand those obligations, we reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  Like many airlines, petitioner Northwest, Inc. (North\u00ad\nwest), established a frequent flyer program, its World-\nPerks Airline Partners Program, to attract loyal cus\u00ad\ntomers. Under this program, members are able to earn\n\u201cmiles\u201d by taking flights operated by Northwest and other\n\u201cpartner\u201d airlines. Members can then redeem these miles\nfor tickets and service upgrades with Northwest or its\nairline partners.\n2              NORTHWEST, INC. v. GINSBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    Respondent became a member of Northwest\u2019s World-\nPerks program in 1999, and as a result of extensive\ntravel on Northwest flights, he achieved \u201cPlatinum Elite\u201d\nstatus (the highest level available) in 2005.\n    In 2008, however, Northwest terminated respondent\u2019s\nmembership, apparently in reliance on a provision of the\nWorldPerks agreement that provided that \u201c[a]buse of the . . .\nprogram (including . . . improper conduct as determined\n by [Northwest] in its sole judgment[ ) ] . . . may result in\ncancellation of the member\u2019s account.\u201d App. 64\u201365. Ac\u00ad\ncording to respondent, a Northwest representative tele\u00ad\nphoned him in June 2008 and informed him that his\n\u201cPlatinum Elite\u201d status was being revoked because he had\n\u201c \u2018abused\u2019 \u201d the program. Id., at 35. In a letter sent about\ntwo weeks later, Northwest wrote:\n    \u201c[Y]ou have contacted our office 24 times since De\u00ad\n    cember 3, 2007 regarding travel problems, including\n    9 incidents of your bag arriving late at the luggage\n    carousel. . . .\n         .          .          .          .         .\n    \u201c Since December 3, 2007, you have continually asked\n    for compensation over and above our guidelines.

Respondent\u2019s complaint\nasserted four separate claims.1 First, his complaint al\u00ad\nleged that Northwest had breached its contract by re\u00ad\nvoking his \u201cPlatinum Elite\u201d status without valid cause.\nSecond, the complaint claimed that Northwest violated the\nduty of good faith and fair dealing because it terminated\nhis membership in a way that contravened his reasonable\nexpectations with respect to the manner in which North\u00ad\nwest would exercise its discretion. Third, the complaint\nasserted a claim for negligent misrepresentation, and\nfourth, the complaint alleged intentional misrepresenta\u00ad\ntion. Respondent sought damages in excess of $5 million,\nas well as injunctive relief requiring Northwest to restore\nthe class members\u2019 WorldPerks status and prohibiting\nNorthwest from future revocations of membership.\n   The District Court held that respondent\u2019s claims for\nbreach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\nnegligent misrepresentation, and intentional misrepresen\u00ad\ntation were pre-empted by the Airline Deregulation Act of\n1978 (ADA or Act) as amended, 49 U. S. C. \u00a741713. These\nclaims, the court concluded, were \u201crelate[d] to\u201d North\u00ad\nwest\u2019s rates and services and thus fell within the ADA\u2019s\nexpress pre-emption clause.

That deter\u00ad\nmination was not challenged on appeal.\n4              NORTHWEST, INC. v. GINSBERG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwas dismissed without prejudice under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court held that respondent\nhad failed to identify any material breach because the\nfrequent flyer agreement gave Northwest sole discretion to\ndetermine whether a participant had abused the program.\nRespondent appealed the dismissal of his breach of the\nduty of good faith and fair dealing claim but not the other\nclaims that the court had dismissed.\n    The Ninth Circuit reversed. 695 F. 3d 873 (2012).\nRelying on pre-Wolens Circuit precedent, the Ninth Cir\u00ad\ncuit first held that a breach of implied covenant claim is\n\u201c \u2018too tenuously connected to airline regulation to trigger\npreemption under the ADA.\u2019 \u201d 695 F. 3d, at 879. Such\na claim, the Ninth Circuit wrote, \u201cdoes not interfere with\nthe [Act\u2019s] deregulatory mandate\u201d and does not \u201c \u2018force\nthe Airlines to adopt or change their prices, routes or\nservices\u2014the prerequisite for . . . preemption.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 880.\nIn addition, the Court held that the covenant of good faith\nand fair dealing does not fall within the terms of the Act\u2019s\npre-emption provision because it does not have a \u201cdirect\neffect\u201d on either \u201cprices\u201d or \u201cservices.\u201d Id., at 877, 881.\n    We granted certiorari. 569 U.

Pursuant to this authority,\nthe Board closely regulated air carriers, controlling, among\nother things, routes, rates, and services. See, e.g., Western\nAir Lines, Inc. v. CAB, 347 U. S. 67 (1954); Federal Aviation\nAct of 1958, 72 Stat. 731. And since the Federal Aviation Act\ncontained a saving provision preserving pre-existing statu\u00ad\ntory and common-law remedies, \u00a71106, id., at 798, air carriers\nwere also regulated by the States. See Morales v. Trans\nWorld Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 378 (1992).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 1978, however, Congress enacted the ADA, which\nsought to promote \u201cefficiency, innovation, and low prices\u201d\nin the airline industry through \u201cmaximum reliance on\ncompetitive market forces and on actual and potential\ncompetition.\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a740101(a)(6), (12)(A). While the\nADA did not repeal the predecessor law\u2019s saving provision,\nit included a pre-emption provision in order to \u201censure\nthat the States would not undo federal deregulation with\nregulation of their own.\u201d Morales supra, at 378. In its\ncurrent form, this provision states that \u201ca State, political\nsubdivision of a State, or political authority of at least 2\nStates may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other\nprovision having the force and effect of law related to a\nprice, route, or service of an air carrier that may provide\nair transportation under this subpart.\u201d \u00a741713(b)(1).\n   We have had two occasions to consider the ADA\u2019s pre\u00ad\nemptive reach.      In Morales, we held that the ADA\npre-empted the use of state consumer protection laws to\nregulate airline advertising. We recognized that the key\nphrase \u201crelated to\u201d expresses a \u201cbroad pre-emptive pur\u00ad\npose.\u201d 504 U. S., at 383. Noting our interpretation of\nsimilar language in the pre-emption provision of the Em\u00ad\nployee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974, 29\nU. S. C. \u00a71144(a), we held that a claim \u201crelat[es] to rates,\nroutes, or services,\u201d within the meaning of the ADA, if the\nclaim \u201cha[s] a connection with, or reference to, airline\n\u2018rates, routes, or services.\u2019 \u201d 504 U. S., at 384. The older\nsaving provision, we concluded, did not undermine this\nconclusion. Id., at 384\u2013385.\n   Subsequently, in American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513\nU. S. 219 (1995), we considered the application of the ADA\npre-emption provision to two types of claims concerning an\nairline\u2019s frequent flyer program: first, claims under the\nIllinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices\nAct challenging an airline\u2019s devaluation of earned miles\n(chiefly as the result of the imposition of \u201cblackout dates\u201d\n6              NORTHWEST, INC. v. GINSBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand limits on the number of seats available for customers\nwishing to obtain tickets by using those miles) and, sec\u00ad\nond, breach of contract claims. We reaffirmed Morales\u2019\nbroad interpretation of the ADA pre-emption provision\nand held that this provision barred the claims based on\nthe Illinois statute but not the breach-of-contract claims.\n\u201c[T]erms and conditions airlines offer and passengers\naccept,\u201d we wrote, \u201care privately ordered obligations and\nthus do not amount to a State\u2019s \u2018enact[ment] or en\u00ad\nforce[ment] [of] any law, rule, regulation, standard, or\nother provision having the force and effect of law\u2019 within\nthe meaning of [the ADA pre-emption provision].\u201d 513\nU. S., at 228\u2013229.\n   With this background in mind, we turn to the question\nwhether the ADA pre-empts respondent\u2019s claim for breach\nof the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n                              B\n  The first question we address is whether, as respondent\nnow maintains, the ADA\u2019s pre-emption provision applies\nonly to legislation enacted by a state legislature and regu\u00ad\nlations issued by a state administrative agency but not to\na common-law rule like the implied covenant of good faith\nand fair dealing. We have little difficulty rejecting this\nargument.\n  To begin, state common-law rules fall comfortably with\u00ad\nin the language of the ADA pre-emption provision. As\nnoted above, the current version of this provision applies\nto state \u201claw[s], regulation[s], or other provision[s] having\nthe force and effect of law,\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a741713(b)(1). It is\nroutine to call common-law rules \u201cprovisions.\u201d See, e.g.,\nMadsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753,\n765, n. 3 (1994); United States v. Barnett, 376 U. S. 681,\n689\u2013700 (1964); Brown v. United Airlines, Inc., 720 F. 3d\n60, 68 (CA1 2013) (\u201c[W]hen read in context, the word\n\u2018provision\u2019 in the ADA preemption provision can most\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

And\na common-law rule clearly has \u201cthe force and effect of\nlaw.\u201d In Wolens, we noted that this phrase is most natu\u00ad\nrally read to \u201c \u2018refe[r] to binding standards of conduct that\noperate irrespective of any private agreement,\u2019 \u201d 513 U. S.,\nat 229, n. 5, and we see no basis for holding that such\nstandards must be based on a statute or regulation as\nopposed to the common law.\n  This understanding becomes even clearer when the\noriginal wording of the pre-emption provision is taken into\naccount. When first enacted in 1978, this provision also\napplied to \u201crule[s]\u201d and \u201cstandard[s],\u201d and there surely can\nbe no doubt that this formulation encompassed common\u00ad\nlaw rules. Indeed, we held in CSX Transp., Inc. v. East-\nerwood, 507 U. S. 658, 664 (1993), that virtually identical\nlanguage in the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 in\u00ad\ncludes \u201c[l]egal duties imposed . . . by the common law.\u201d\nSee also Riegel v.

S. 312, 324\n(2008) (holding that a State\u2019s \u201c \u2018requirements\u2019 \u201d \u201cinclud[e]\n[the state\u2019s] common-law duties\u201d).\n  While \u201crule[s]\u201d and \u201cstandard[s]\u201d are not mentioned in\nthe current version of the statute, this omission is the\nresult of a recodification that was not meant to affect the\nprovision\u2019s meaning. Those additional terms were deleted\nas part of a wholesale recodification of Title 49 in 1994,\nbut Congress made it clear that this recodification did not\neffect any \u201csubstantive change.\u201d \u00a7 1(a), 108 Stat. 745.\n  In arguing that common-law rules fall outside the scope\nof the ADA pre-emption provision, respondent relies on\nour decision in Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51\n(2002), which held that the Federal Boat Safety Act of\n1971 did not pre-empt a common-law tort claim, but there\nare critical differences between the pre-emption provisions\nin the Boat Safety Act and the ADA. The Boat Safety Act\nprovision applies only to \u201ca law or regulation,\u201d 46 U. S. C.\n\u00a74306, whereas the ADA provision, as just explained, is\n8              NORTHWEST, INC. v. GINSBERG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmuch more broadly worded.\n   In addition, the relationship between the ADA\u2019s pre\u00ad\nemption provision and the saving provision carried over\nfrom the prior law is also quite different. The Sprietsma\ndecision placed substantial weight on the Boat Safety Act\u2019s\nsaving provision, which was enacted at the same time as\nthe pre-emption provision, but we have described the\nFederal Aviation Act saving clause as \u201ca relic of the pre\u00ad\nADA/no pre-emption regime.\u201d Morales, 504 U. S., at 385.\nThat provision applies to the entire, sprawling Federal\nAviation Act, and not just to the ADA, and as we held in\nMorales, this \u201cgeneral \u2018remedies\u2019 saving clause cannot be\nallowed to supersede the specific substantive pre-emption\nprovision.\u201d     Ibid.    See also Wolens, supra, at 245\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent\u00ad\ning in part). For these reasons, respondent\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of the ADA pre-emption provision cannot be squared\nwith the provision\u2019s terms.\n   Exempting common-law claims would also disserve the\ncentral purpose of the ADA. The Act eliminated federal\nregulation of rates, routes, and services in order to allow\nthose aspects of air transportation to be set by market\nforces, and the pre-emption provision was included to pre\u00ad\nvent the States from undoing what the Act was meant to\naccomplish. Morales, supra, at 378. What is important,\ntherefore, is the effect of a state law, regulation, or provi\u00ad\nsion, not its form, and the ADA\u2019s deregulatory aim can be\nundermined just as surely by a state common-law rule as it\ncan by a state statute or regulation. See Medtronic, Inc.,\nsupra, at 325 (recognizing that state tort law that imposes\ncertain requirements would \u201cdisrup[t] the federal scheme\nno less than state regulatory law to the same effect\u201d). As\nthe First Circuit has recognized, \u201c[i]t defies logic to think\nthat Congress would disregard real-world consequences and\ngive dispositive effect to the form of a clear intrusion into a\nfederally regulated industry.\u201d Brown, 720 F. 3d, at 66\u201367.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Finally, if all state common-law rules fell outside the\nambit of the ADA\u2019s pre-emption provision, we would have\nhad no need in Wolens to single out a subcategory of common\u00ad\nlaw claims, i.e., those based on the parties\u2019 voluntary under\u00ad\ntaking, as falling outside that provision\u2019s coverage.\n  Accordingly, we conclude that the phrase \u201cother provi\u00ad\nsion having the force and effect of law\u201d includes common\u00ad\nlaw claims.\n                               C\n   We must next determine whether respondent\u2019s breach of\nimplied covenant claim \u201crelates to\u201d \u201crates, routes, or ser\u00ad\nvices.\u201d A claim satisfies this requirement if it has \u201ca con\u00ad\nnection with, or reference to, airline\u201d prices, routes, or\nservices, Morales, supra, at 384, and the claim at issue\nhere clearly has such a connection. That claim seeks\nrespondent\u2019s reinstatement in Northwest\u2019s frequent flyer\nprogram so that he can access the program\u2019s \u201cvaluable . . .\nbenefits,\u201d including \u201cflight upgrades, accumulated mile\u00ad\nage, loyalty program status or benefits on other airlines,\nand other advantages.\u201d App. 49\u201350.\n   Like the frequent flyer program in Wolens, the North\u00ad\nwest program is connected to the airline\u2019s \u201crates\u201d because\nthe program awards mileage credits that can be redeemed\nfor tickets and upgrades. See 513 U. S., at 226. When\nmiles are used in this way, the rate that a customer pays,\ni.e., the price of a particular ticket, is either eliminated or\nreduced. The program is also connected to \u201cservices,\u201d i.e.,\naccess to flights and to higher service categories. Ibid.\n   Respondent argues that his claim differs from the\nclaims in Wolens because he \u201cdoes not challenge access to\nflights and upgrades or the number of miles needed to\nobtain air tickets\u201d but instead contests \u201cthe termination of\nhis WorldPerks elite membership,\u201d Brief for Respondent\n12, but this argument ignores respondent\u2019s reason for\nseeking reinstatement of his membership, i.e., to obtain\n10             NORTHWEST, INC. v. GINSBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreduced rates and enhanced services. Respondent\u2019s prof\u00ad\nfered distinction has no substance.\n   Respondent and amici suggest that Wolens is not control\u00ad\nling because frequent flyer programs have fundamentally\nchanged since the time of that decision. We are told that\n\u201cmost miles [are now] earned without consuming airline\nservices\u201d and are \u201cspent without consuming airline ser\u00ad\nvices.\u201d Brief for State of California et al. 18 (emphasis\ndeleted). But whether or not this alleged change might\nhave some impact in a future case, it is not implicated here.\nIn this case, respondent did not assert that he earned his\nmiles from any activity other than taking flights or that he\nattempted to redeem miles for anything other than tickets\nand upgrades. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\u201348.\n                             III\n   With these preliminary issues behind us, we turn to the\ncentral issue in this case, i.e., whether respondent\u2019s im\u00ad\nplied covenant claim is based on a state-imposed obliga\u00ad\ntion or simply one that the parties voluntarily undertook.\nPetitioners urge us to hold that implied covenant claims\nare always pre-empted, and respondent suggests that such\nclaims are generally not pre-empted, but the reasoning of\nWolens neither dooms nor spares all such claims.\n   While most States recognize some form of the good faith\nand fair dealing doctrine, it does not appear that there is\nany uniform understanding of the doctrine\u2019s precise mean\u00ad\ning. \u201c[T]he concept of good faith in the performance of\ncontracts \u2018is a phrase without general meaning (or mean\u00ad\nings) of its own.\u2019 \u201d Tymshare, Inc. v.

Corbin, Corbin on Contracts\n\u00a7654A, p. 88 (L. Cunningham & A. Jacobsen eds. Supp.\n1994). When the law of a State does not authorize parties\nto free themselves from the covenant, a breach of covenant\nclaim is pre-empted under the reasoning of Wolens.\n   Another feature of Minnesota law provides an addition\u00ad\nal, independent basis for our conclusion. Minnesota law\nholds that the implied covenant applies to \u201cevery con\u00ad\ntract,\u201d In re Hennepin Cty., supra, at 502, with the notable\nexception of employment contracts. Hunt v. IBM Mid\nAmerica Employees Fed. Credit Union, 384 N. W. 2d 853,\n857\u2013858 (Minn. 1986). The exception for employment\ncontracts is based, in significant part, on \u201cpolicy reasons,\u201d\nid., at 858, and therefore the decision not to exempt other\ntypes of contracts must be based on a policy determina\u00ad\ntion, namely, that the \u201cpolicy reasons\u201d that support the\nrule for employment contracts do not apply (at least with\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   But other States permit a party to contract out of the duties imposed\nby the implied covenant.

When the application of\nthe implied covenant depends on state policy, a breach\nof implied covenant claim cannot be viewed as simply an\nattempt to vindicate the parties\u2019 implicit understanding of\nthe contract.\n   For these reasons, the breach of implied covenant claim\nin this case cannot stand, but petitioners exhort us to go\nfurther and hold that all such claims, no matter the con\u00ad\ntent of the law of the relevant jurisdiction, are pre-empted.\nIf pre-emption depends on state law, petitioners warn,\nairlines will be faced with a baffling patchwork of rules,\nand the deregulatory aim of the ADA will be frustrated.\nBut the airlines have means to avoid such a result. A\nState\u2019s implied covenant rules will escape pre-emption\nonly if the law of the relevant State permits an airline to\ncontract around those rules in its frequent flyer program\nagreement, and if an airline\u2019s agreement is governed by\nthe law of such a State, the airline can specify that the\nagreement does not incorporate the covenant. While the\ninclusion of such a provision may impose transaction costs\nand presumably would not enhance the attractiveness of\nthe program, an airline can decide whether the benefits of\nsuch a provision are worth the potential costs.\n   Our holding also does not leave participants in frequent\nflyer programs without protection. The ADA is based on\nthe view that the best interests of airline passengers are\nmost effectively promoted, in the main, by allowing the\nfree market to operate. If an airline acquires a reputation\nfor mistreating the participants in its frequent flyer pro\u00ad\ngram (who are generally the airline\u2019s most loyal and valu\u00ad\nable customers), customers can avoid that program and\nmay be able to enroll in a more favorable rival program.\n   Federal law also provides protection for frequent flyer\nprogram participants. Congress has given the Depart\u00ad\nment of Transportation (DOT) the general authority to\nprohibit and punish unfair and deceptive practices in air\n14               NORTHWEST, INC. v. GINSBERG\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntransportation and in the sale of air transportation, 49\nU. S. C. \u00a741712(a), and Congress has specifically author\u00ad\nized the DOT to investigate complaints relating to fre\u00ad\nquent flyer programs.       See FAA Modernization and\nReform Act of 2012, \u00a7408(6), 126 Stat. 87. Pursuant to\nthese provisions, the DOT regularly entertains and acts on\nsuch complaints.3\n  We note, finally, that respondent\u2019s claim of ill treatment\nby Northwest might have been vindicated if he had pur\u00ad\nsued his breach-of-contract claim after its dismissal by the\nDistrict Court. Respondent argues that, contrary to the\nholding of the District Court, the frequent flyer agreement\ndid not actually give Northwest unfettered discretion to\nterminate his membership in the program, see Brief for\nRespondent 20\u201321, and the United States makes a related\nargument, namely, that even if the agreement gave\nNorthwest complete discretion with respect to a determi\u00ad\nnation regarding abuse of the program, the agreement did\nnot necessarily bar a claim asserting that membership\nwas ended for an ulterior reason, such as an effort to cut\ncosts. If respondent had appealed the dismissal of his\nbreach-of-contract claim, he could have presented these\narguments to the Court of Appeals, but he chose not to\npress that claim. He voluntarily dismissed the breach-of\u00ad\ncontract claim and instead appealed only the breach of\nimplied covenant claim, which we hold to be pre-empted.\n                       *    *     *\n  Because respondent\u2019s implied covenant of good faith\nand fair dealing claim seeks to enlarge his contractual\nagreement with petitioners, we hold that 49 U.
