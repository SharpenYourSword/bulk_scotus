Argued January 21, 2014—Decided April 22, 2014\nA California Highway Patrol officer stopped the pickup truck occupied\n  by petitioners because it matched the description of a vehicle that a\n  911 caller had recently reported as having run her off the road. As he\n  and a second officer approached the truck, they smelled marijuana.\n  They searched the truck’s bed, found 30 pounds of marijuana, and ar-\n  rested petitioners. Petitioners moved to suppress the evidence, argu-\n  ing that the traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment. Their mo-\n  tion was denied, and they pleaded guilty to transporting marijuana.\n  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, concluding that the officer\n  had reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop.\nHeld: The traffic stop complied with the Fourth Amendment because,\n under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had reasonable\n suspicion that the truck’s driver was intoxicated. Pp. 3–11.\n    (a) The Fourth Amendment permits brief investigative stops when\n an officer has “a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the\n particular person stopped of . . . criminal activity.” United States v.\n Cortez, 449 U. S. 411, 417–418. Reasonable suspicion takes into ac-\n count “the totality of the circumstances,” id., at 417, and depends\n “upon both the content of information possessed by police and its de-\n gree of reliability,” Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325, 330. An anony-\n mous tip alone seldom demonstrates sufficient reliability, White, 496\n U. S., at 329, but may do so under appropriate circumstances, id., at\n 327. Pp. 3–5.\n    (b) The 911 call in this case bore adequate indicia of reliability for\n the officer to credit the caller’s account. By reporting that she had\n been run off the road by a specific vehicle, the caller necessarily\n claimed an eyewitness basis of knowledge. The apparently short\n time between the reported incident and the 911 call suggests that the\n2                 PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    caller had little time to fabricate the report. And a reasonable officer\n    could conclude that a false tipster would think twice before using the\n    911 system, which has several technological and regulatory features\n    that safeguard against making false reports with immunity. Pp. 5–8.\n      (c) Not only was the tip here reliable, but it also created reasonable\n    suspicion of drunk driving. Running another car off the road sug-\n    gests the sort of impairment that characterizes drunk driving. While\n    that conduct might be explained by another cause such as driver dis-\n    traction, reasonable suspicion “need not rule out the possibility of in-\n    nocent conduct.” United States v. Arvizu, 534 U. S. 266, 277. Finally,\n    the officer’s failure to observe additional suspicious conduct during\n    the short period that he followed the truck did not dispel the reason-\n    able suspicion of drunk driving, and the officer was not required to\n    surveil the truck for a longer period.

CALIFORNIA \n\n   ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF \n\n        CALIFORNIA, FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n                                 [April 22, 2014]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  After a 911 caller reported that a vehicle had run her off\nthe road, a police officer located the vehicle she identified\nduring the call and executed a traffic stop. We hold that\nthe stop complied with the Fourth Amendment because,\nunder the totality of the circumstances, the officer had\nreasonable suspicion that the driver was intoxicated.\n                             I\n   On August 23, 2008, a Mendocino County 911 dispatch\nteam for the California Highway Patrol (CHP) received a\ncall from another CHP dispatcher in neighboring Hum­\nboldt County. The Humboldt County dispatcher relayed a\ntip from a 911 caller, which the Mendocino County team\nrecorded as follows: “ ‘Showing southbound Highway 1 at\nmile marker 88, Silver Ford 150 pickup. Plate of 8-David­\n94925. Ran the reporting party off the roadway and was\nlast seen approximately five [minutes] ago.’ ” App. 36a.\nThe Mendocino County team then broadcast that infor­\nmation to CHP officers at 3:47 p.m.\n   A CHP officer heading northbound toward the reported\nvehicle responded to the broadcast. At 4:00 p.m., the\n2               PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nofficer passed the truck near mile marker 69. At about\n4:05 p.m., after making a U-turn, he pulled the truck over.\nA second officer, who had separately responded to the\nbroadcast, also arrived on the scene. As the two officers\napproached the truck, they smelled marijuana. A search\nof the truck bed revealed 30 pounds of marijuana. The\nofficers arrested the driver, petitioner Lorenzo Prado\nNavarette, and the passenger, petitioner José Prado\nNavarette.\n  Petitioners moved to suppress the evidence, arguing\nthat the traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment\nbecause the officer lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal\nactivity. Both the magistrate who presided over the sup­\npression hearing and the Superior Court disagreed.1\nPetitioners pleaded guilty to transporting marijuana and\nwere sentenced to 90 days in jail plus three years of\nprobation.\n  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, concluding\nthat the officer had reasonable suspicion to conduct an\ninvestigative stop. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4842651</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Oct. 12, 2012). The\ncourt reasoned that the content of the tip indicated that it\ncame from an eyewitness victim of reckless driving, and\nthat the officer’s corroboration of the truck’s description,\nlocation, and direction established that the tip was reliable\nenough to justify a traffic stop. Id., at *7. Finally, the\ncourt concluded that the caller reported driving that was\nsufficiently dangerous to merit an investigative stop with­\nout waiting for the officer to observe additional reckless\ndriving himself. Id., at *9. The California Supreme Court\n——————\n   1 At the suppression hearing, counsel for petitioners did not dispute\n\nthat the reporting party identified herself by name in the 911 call\nrecording. Because neither the caller nor the Humboldt County dis­\npatcher who received the call was present at the hearing, however, the\nprosecution did not introduce the recording into evidence. The prosecu­\ntion proceeded to treat the tip as anonymous, and the lower courts\nfollowed suit.

S. ___\n(2013), and now affirm.\n                             II\n  The Fourth Amendment permits brief investigative\nstops—such as the traffic stop in this case—when a law\nenforcement officer has “a particularized and objective\nbasis for suspecting the particular person stopped of crim­\ninal activity.” United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411, 417–\n418 (1981); see also Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–22\n(1968). The “reasonable suspicion” necessary to justify\nsuch a stop “is dependent upon both the content of infor­\nmation possessed by police and its degree of reliability.”\nAlabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325, 330 (1990). The stand­\nard takes into account “the totality of the circumstances—\nthe whole picture.” Cortez, supra, at 417. Although a\nmere “ ‘hunch’ ” does not create reasonable suspicion,\nTerry, supra, at 27, the level of suspicion the standard\nrequires is “considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by\na preponderance of the evidence,” and “obviously less”\nthan is necessary for probable cause, United States v.\nSokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 7 (1989).\n                              A\n   These principles apply with full force to investigative\nstops based on information from anonymous tips. We\nhave firmly rejected the argument “that reasonable cause\nfor a[n investigative stop] can only be based on the officer’s\npersonal observation, rather than on information supplied\nby another person.” Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143,\n147 (1972). Of course, “an anonymous tip alone seldom\ndemonstrates the informant’s basis of knowledge or verac­\nity.” White, 496 U. S., at 329 (emphasis added). That is\nbecause “ordinary citizens generally do not provide exten­\nsive recitations of the basis of their everyday observa­\ntions,” and an anonymous tipster’s veracity is “ ‘by hypoth­\n4            PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nesis largely unknown, and unknowable.’ ” Ibid. But under\nappropriate circumstances, an anonymous tip can demon­\nstrate “sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasona­\nble suspicion to make [an] investigatory stop.” Id., at 327.\n   Our decisions in Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325 (1990),\nand Florida v. J. L., 529 U. S. 266 (2000), are useful\nguides. In White, an anonymous tipster told the police\nthat a woman would drive from a particular apartment\nbuilding to a particular motel in a brown Plymouth station\nwagon with a broken right tail light. The tipster further\nasserted that the woman would be transporting cocaine.\n496 U. S., at 327. After confirming the innocent details,\nofficers stopped the station wagon as it neared the motel\nand found cocaine in the vehicle. Id., at 331. We held that\nthe officers’ corroboration of certain details made the\nanonymous tip sufficiently reliable to create reasonable\nsuspicion of criminal activity. By accurately predicting\nfuture behavior, the tipster demonstrated “a special famil­\niarity with respondent’s affairs,” which in turn implied\nthat the tipster had “access to reliable information about\nthat individual’s illegal activities.” Id., at 332. We also\nrecognized that an informant who is proved to tell the\ntruth about some things is more likely to tell the truth\nabout other things, “including the claim that the object of\nthe tip is engaged in criminal activity.” Id., at 331 (citing\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 244 (1983)).\n   In J. L., by contrast, we determined that no reasonable\nsuspicion arose from a bare-bones tip that a young black\nmale in a plaid shirt standing at a bus stop was carrying a\ngun. 529 U. S., at 268. The tipster did not explain how he\nknew about the gun, nor did he suggest that he had any\nspecial familiarity with the young man’s affairs. Id., at\n271. As a result, police had no basis for believing “that the\ntipster ha[d] knowledge of concealed criminal activity.”\nId., at 272. Furthermore, the tip included no predictions\nof future behavior that could be corroborated to assess the\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntipster’s credibility. Id., at 271. We accordingly concluded\nthat the tip was insufficiently reliable to justify a stop and\nfrisk.\n                                B\n   The initial question in this case is whether the 911 call\nwas sufficiently reliable to credit the allegation that peti­\ntioners’ truck “ran the [caller] off the roadway.” Even\nassuming for present purposes that the 911 call was anon­\nymous, see n. 1, supra, we conclude that the call bore\nadequate indicia of reliability for the officer to credit the\ncaller’s account. The officer was therefore justified in\nproceeding from the premise that the truck had, in fact,\ncaused the caller’s car to be dangerously diverted from the\nhighway.\n   By reporting that she had been run off the road by a\nspecific vehicle—a silver Ford F-150 pickup, license plate\n8D94925—the caller necessarily claimed eyewitness\nknowledge of the alleged dangerous driving. That basis of\nknowledge lends significant support to the tip’s reliability.\nSee Gates, supra, at 234 (“[An informant’s] explicit and\ndetailed description of alleged wrongdoing, along with a\nstatement that the event was observed firsthand, entitles\nhis tip to greater weight than might otherwise be the\ncase”); Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410, 416 (1969)\n(a tip of illegal gambling is less reliable when “it is not\nalleged that the informant personally observed [the de­\nfendant] at work or that he had ever placed a bet with\nhim”). This is in contrast to J. L., where the tip provided\nno basis for concluding that the tipster had actually seen\nthe gun. 529 U. S., at 271. Even in White, where we\nupheld the stop, there was scant evidence that the tipster\nhad actually observed cocaine in the station wagon. We\ncalled White a “ ‘close case’ ” because “[k]nowledge about a\nperson’s future movements indicates some familiarity with\nthat person’s affairs, but having such knowledge does not\n6            PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessarily imply that the informant knows, in particular,\nwhether that person is carrying hidden contraband.” 529\nU. S., at 271. A driver’s claim that another vehicle ran her\noff the road, however, necessarily implies that the inform­\nant knows the other car was driven dangerously.\n   There is also reason to think that the 911 caller in this\ncase was telling the truth. Police confirmed the truck’s\nlocation near mile marker 69 (roughly 19 highway miles\nsouth of the location reported in the 911 call) at 4:00 p.m.\n(roughly 18 minutes after the 911 call). That timeline of\nevents suggests that the caller reported the incident soon\nafter she was run off the road. That sort of contemporane­\nous report has long been treated as especially reliable. In\nevidence law, we generally credit the proposition that\nstatements about an event and made soon after perceiving\nthat event are especially trustworthy because “substantial\ncontemporaneity of event and statement negate the likeli­\nhood of deliberate or conscious misrepresentation.” Advi­\nsory Committee’s Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 803(1), 28\nU. S. C. App., p. 371 (describing the rationale for the\nhearsay exception for “present sense impression[s]”). A\nsimilar rationale applies to a “statement relating to a\nstartling event”—such as getting run off the road—“made\nwhile the declarant was under the stress of excitement\nthat it caused.” Fed. Rule Evid. 803(2) (hearsay exception\nfor “excited utterances”). Unsurprisingly, 911 calls that\nwould otherwise be inadmissible hearsay have often been\nadmitted on those grounds. See D. Binder, Hearsay\nHandbook §8.1, pp. 257–259 (4th ed. 2013–2014) (citing\ncases admitting 911 calls as present sense impressions);\nid., §9.1, at 274–275 (911 calls admitted as excited utter­\nances). There was no indication that the tip in J. L. (or\neven in White) was contemporaneous with the observation\nof criminal activity or made under the stress of excitement\ncaused by a startling event, but those considerations\nweigh in favor of the caller’s veracity here.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Another indicator of veracity is the caller’s use of the\n911 emergency system. See Brief for Respondent 40–41,\n44; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16–18. A 911\ncall has some features that allow for identifying and trac­\ning callers, and thus provide some safeguards against\nmaking false reports with immunity. See J. L., supra, at\n276 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). As this case illustrates,\nsee n. 1, supra, 911 calls can be recorded, which provides\nvictims with an opportunity to identify the false tipster’s\nvoice and subject him to prosecution, see, e.g., Cal. Penal\nCode Ann. §653x (West 2010) (makes “telephon[ing] the\n911 emergency line with the intent to annoy or harass”\npunishable by imprisonment and fine); see also §148.3\n(2014 West Cum. Supp.) (prohibits falsely reporting “that\nan ‘emergency’ exists”); §148.5 (prohibits falsely reporting\n“that a felony or misdemeanor has been committed”). The\n911 system also permits law enforcement to verify im­\nportant information about the caller. In 1998, the Federal\nCommunications Commission (FCC) began to require\ncellular carriers to relay the caller’s phone number to 911\ndispatchers. 47 CFR §20.18(d)(1) (2013) (FCC’s “Phase I\nenhanced 911 services” requirements). Beginning in 2001,\ncarriers have been required to identify the caller’s geo­\ngraphic location with increasing specificity. §§20.18(e)–(h)\n(“Phase II enhanced 911 service” requirements). And\nalthough callers may ordinarily block call recipients from\nobtaining their identifying information, FCC regulations\nexempt 911 calls from that privilege.           §§64.1601(b),\n(d)(4)(ii) (“911 emergency services” exemption from rule\nthat, when a caller so requests, “a carrier may not reveal\nthat caller’s number or name”). None of this is to suggest\nthat tips in 911 calls are per se reliable. Given the forego­\ning technological and regulatory developments, however, a\nreasonable officer could conclude that a false tipster would\nthink twice before using such a system. The caller’s use of\nthe 911 system is therefore one of the relevant circum­\n8               PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstances that, taken together, justified the officer’s reliance\non the information reported in the 911 call.\n                               C\n   Even a reliable tip will justify an investigative stop only\nif it creates reasonable suspicion that “criminal activity\nmay be afoot.” Terry, 392 U. S., at 30. We must therefore\ndetermine whether the 911 caller’s report of being run off\nthe roadway created reasonable suspicion of an ongoing\ncrime such as drunk driving as opposed to an isolated\nepisode of past recklessness. See Cortez, 449 U. S., at 417\n(“An investigatory stop must be justified by some objective\nmanifestation that the person stopped is, or is about to be,\nengaged in criminal activity”). We conclude that the\nbehavior alleged by the 911 caller, “viewed from the\nstandpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer,\namount[s] to reasonable suspicion” of drunk driving.\nOrnelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696 (1996). The\nstop was therefore proper.2\n   Reasonable suspicion depends on “ ‘ “the factual and\npractical considerations of everyday life on which reason-\nable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.” ’ ” Id., at\n695. Under that commonsense approach, we can appro­\npriately recognize certain driving behaviors as sound\nindicia of drunk driving. See, e.g., People v.

W. 2d 625, 626 (Iowa 2001) (“driving in\nthe median”). Indeed, the accumulated experience of\nthousands of officers suggests that these sorts of erratic\nbehaviors are strongly correlated with drunk driving.\nSee Nat. Highway Traffic Safety Admin., The Visual\nDetection of DWI Motorists 4–5 (Mar. 2010), online at\nhttp://nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/nti/pdf/808677.pdf (as visited\nApr. 18, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\nOf course, not all traffic infractions imply intoxication.\nUnconfirmed reports of driving without a seatbelt or\nslightly over the speed limit, for example, are so tenuously\nconnected to drunk driving that a stop on those grounds\nalone would be constitutionally suspect. But a reliable tip\nalleging the dangerous behaviors discussed above gener-\nally would justify a traffic stop on suspicion of drunk\ndriving.\n   The 911 caller in this case reported more than a minor\ntraffic infraction and more than a conclusory allegation of\ndrunk or reckless driving. Instead, she alleged a specific\nand dangerous result of the driver’s conduct: running\nanother car off the highway. That conduct bears too great\na resemblance to paradigmatic manifestations of drunk\ndriving to be dismissed as an isolated example of reckless­\nness. Running another vehicle off the road suggests lane­\npositioning problems, decreased vigilance, impaired judg­\nment, or some combination of those recognized drunk\ndriving cues. See Visual Detection of DWI Motorists 4–5.\nAnd the experience of many officers suggests that a driver\nwho almost strikes a vehicle or another object—the exact\nscenario that ordinarily causes “running [another vehicle]\noff the roadway”—is likely intoxicated. See id., at 5, 8.\nAs a result, we cannot say that the officer acted unreason­\nably under these circumstances in stopping a driver\nwhose alleged conduct was a significant indicator of drunk\ndriving.\n   Petitioners’ attempts to second-guess the officer’s rea­\n10           PRADO NAVARETTE v.

It is\ntrue that the reported behavior might also be explained\nby, for example, a driver responding to “an unruly child or\nother distraction.” Brief for Petitioners 21. But we have\nconsistently recognized that reasonable suspicion “need\nnot rule out the possibility of innocent conduct.” United\nStates v. Arvizu, 534 U. S. 266, 277 (2002).\n   Nor did the absence of additional suspicious conduct,\nafter the vehicle was first spotted by an officer, dispel the\nreasonable suspicion of drunk driving. Brief for Petition­\ners 23–24. It is hardly surprising that the appearance of a\nmarked police car would inspire more careful driving for a\ntime. Cf. Arvizu, supra, at 275 (“ ‘[s]lowing down after\nspotting a law enforcement vehicle’ ” does not dispel rea­\nsonable suspicion of criminal activity). Extended observa­\ntion of an allegedly drunk driver might eventually dispel a\nreasonable suspicion of intoxication, but the 5-minute\nperiod in this case hardly sufficed in that regard. Of\ncourse, an officer who already has such a reasonable sus­\npicion need not surveil a vehicle at length in order to\npersonally observe suspicious driving. See Adams v.\nWilliams, 407 U. S., at 147 (repudiating the argument\nthat “reasonable cause for a[n investigative stop] can only\nbe based on the officer’s personal observation”). Once\nreasonable suspicion of drunk driving arises, “[t]he rea­\nsonableness of the officer’s decision to stop a suspect does\nnot turn on the availability of less intrusive investigatory\ntechniques.” Sokolow, 490 U. S., at 11. This would be a\nparticularly inappropriate context to depart from that\nsettled rule, because allowing a drunk driver a second\nchance for dangerous conduct could have disastrous\nconsequences.\n                              III\n  Like White, this is a “close case.” 496 U.

Alt­\nhough the indicia present here are different from those we\nfound sufficient in White, there is more than one way to\ndemonstrate “a particularized and objective basis for\nsuspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activ­\nity.” Cortez, 449 U. S., at 417–418. Under the totality of\nthe circumstances, we find the indicia of reliability in this\ncase sufficient to provide the officer with reasonable suspi­\ncion that the driver of the reported vehicle had run another\nvehicle off the road. That made it reasonable under the\ncircumstances for the officer to execute a traffic stop. We\naccordingly affirm.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

People v. Wells, 38\nCal. 4th l078, 1082, 136 P. 3d 810, 812, (2006). See also,\ne.g., United States v. Wheat, 278 F. 3d 722, 729–730 (CA8\n2001); State v. Walshire, 634 N. W. 2d 625, 626–627, 630\n(Iowa 2001). Today’s opinion does not explicitly adopt\nsuch a departure from our normal Fourth Amendment\nrequirement that anonymous tips must be corroborated; it\npurports to adhere to our prior cases, such as Florida v.\nJ. L., 529 U. S. 266 (2000), and Alabama v. White, 496\nU. S. 325 (1990). Be not deceived.\n   Law enforcement agencies follow closely our judgments\non matters such as this, and they will identify at once our\nnew rule: So long as the caller identifies where the car is,\nanonymous claims of a single instance of possibly careless\nor reckless driving, called in to 911, will support a traffic\nstop. This is not my concept, and I am sure would not be\nthe Framers’, of a people secure from unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. I would reverse the judgment of\n2              PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court of Appeal of California.\n                                    I\n    The California Highway Patrol in this case knew noth­\ning about the tipster on whose word—and that alone—\nthey seized Lorenzo and José Prado Navarette. They did\nnot know her name.1 They did not know her phone num­\nber or address. They did not even know where she called\nfrom (she may have dialed in from a neighboring county,\nApp. 33a–34a).\n    The tipster said the truck had “[run her] off the road­\nway,” id., at 36a, but the police had no reason to credit\nthat charge and many reasons to doubt it, beginning with\nthe peculiar fact that the accusation was anonymous.\n“[E]liminating accountability . . . is ordinarily the very\npurpose of anonymity.”              McIntyre v. Ohio Elections\nComm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 385 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nThe unnamed tipster “can lie with impunity,” J. L., supra,\nat 275 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Anonymity is especially\nsuspicious with respect to the call that is the subject of the\npresent case. When does a victim complain to the police\nabout an arguably criminal act (running the victim off the\nroad) without giving his identity, so that he can accuse\nand testify when the culprit is caught?\n    The question before us, the Court agrees, ante, at 8, is\nwhether the “content of information possessed by police\nand its degree of reliability,” White, 496 U. S., at 330, gave\nthe officers reasonable suspicion that the driver of the\ntruck (Lorenzo) was committing an ongoing crime. When\nthe only source of the government’s information is an\ninformant’s tip, we ask whether the tip bears sufficient\n“ ‘indicia of reliability,’ ” id., at 328, to establish “a particu­\nlarized and objective basis for suspecting the particular\n——————\n  1 There was some indication below that the tipster was a woman. See\n\nApp. 18a. Beyond that detail, we must, as the Court notes, ante, at 2,\nn. 1, assume that the identity of the tipster was unknown.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nperson stopped of criminal activity,” United States v.\nCortez, 449 U. S. 411, 417–418 (1981).\n   The most extreme case, before this one, in which an\nanonymous tip was found to meet this standard was\nWhite, supra. There the reliability of the tip was estab­\nlished by the fact that it predicted the target’s behavior in\nthe finest detail—a detail that could be known only by\nsomeone familiar with the target’s business: She would,\nthe tipster said, leave a particular apartment building, get\ninto a brown Plymouth station wagon with a broken right\ntail light, and drive immediately to a particular motel.\nId., at 327. Very few persons would have such intimate\nknowledge, and hence knowledge of the unobservable fact\nthat the woman was carrying unlawful drugs was plausi­\nble. Id., at 332. Here the Court makes a big deal of the\nfact that the tipster was dead right about the fact that a\nsilver Ford F-150 truck (license plate 8D94925) was trav­\neling south on Highway 1 somewhere near mile marker\n88. But everyone in the world who saw the car would have\nthat knowledge, and anyone who wanted the car stopped\nwould have to provide that information. Unlike the situa­\ntion in White, that generally available knowledge in no\nway makes it plausible that the tipster saw the car run\nsomeone off the road.\n   The Court says, ante, at 5, that “[b]y reporting that she\nhad been run off the road by a specific vehicle . . . the\ncaller necessarily claimed eyewitness knowledge.” So\nwhat? The issue is not how she claimed to know, but\nwhether what she claimed to know was true. The claim to\n“eyewitness knowledge” of being run off the road supports\nnot at all its veracity; nor does the amazing, mystifying\nprediction (so far short of what existed in White) that the\npetitioners’ truck would be heading south on Highway 1.\n   The Court finds “reason to think” that the informant\n“was telling the truth” in the fact that police observation\nconfirmed that the truck had been driving near the spot at\n4             PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwhich, and at the approximate time at which, the tipster\nalleged she had been run off the road. Ante, at 6. Accord­\ning to the Court, the statement therefore qualifies as a\n“ ‘present sense impression’ ” or “ ‘excited utterance,’ ” kinds\nof hearsay that the law deems categorically admissible\ngiven their low likelihood of reflecting “ ‘deliberate or\nconscious misrepresentation.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Advisory\nCommittee’s Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 803(1), 28 U. S. C.\nApp., p. 371). So, the Court says, we can fairly suppose\nthat the accusation was true.\n   No, we cannot. To begin with, it is questionable whether\neither the “present sense impression” or the “excited ut­\nterance” exception to the hearsay rule applies here. The\nclassic “present sense impression” is the recounting of an\nevent that is occurring before the declarant’s eyes, as the\ndeclarant is speaking (“I am watching the Hindenburg\nexplode!”). See 2 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence 362\n(7th ed. 2013) (hereinafter McCormick). And the classic\n“excited utterance” is a statement elicited, almost involun­\ntarily, by the shock of what the declarant is immediately\nwitnessing (“My God, those people will be killed!”). See\nid., at 368–369. It is the immediacy that gives the state­\nment some credibility; the declarant has not had time to\ndissemble or embellish. There is no such immediacy here.\nThe declarant had time to observe the license number of\nthe offending vehicle, 8D94925 (a difficult task if she was\nforced off the road and the vehicle was speeding away), to\nbring her car to a halt, to copy down the observed license\nnumber (presumably), and (if she was using her own cell\nphone) to dial a call to the police from the stopped car.\nPlenty of time to dissemble or embellish.\n   Moreover, even assuming that less than true immediacy\nwill suffice for these hearsay exceptions to apply, the\ntipster’s statement would run into additional barriers to\nadmissibility and acceptance. According to the very Advi­\nsory Committee’s Notes from which the Court quotes,\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncases addressing an unidentified declarant’s present sense\nimpression “indicate hesitancy in upholding the statement\nalone as sufficient” proof of the reported event. 28 U. S. C.\nApp., at 371; see also 7 M. Graham, Handbook of Federal\nEvidence 19–20 (7th ed. 2012). For excited utterances as\nwell, the “knotty theoretical” question of statement-alone\nadmissibility persists—seemingly even when the declarant\nis known. 2 McCormick 368. “Some courts . . . have taken\nthe position that an excited utterance is admissible only if\nother proof is presented which supports a finding of fact\nthat the exciting event did occur. The issue has not yet\nbeen resolved under the Federal Rules.” Id., at 367–368\n(footnote omitted). It is even unsettled whether excited\nutterances of an unknown declarant are ever admissible.\nA leading treatise reports that “the courts have been\nreluctant to admit such statements, principally because of\nuncertainty that foundational requirements, including the\nimpact of the event on the declarant, have been satisfied.”\nId., at 372. In sum, it is unlikely that the law of evidence\nwould deem the mystery caller in this case “especially\ntrustworthy,” ante, at 6.\n   Finally, and least tenably, the Court says that another\n“indicator of veracity” is the anonymous tipster’s mere\n“use of the 911 emergency system,” ante, at 7. Because,\nyou see, recent “technological and regulatory develop­\nments” suggest that the identities of unnamed 911 callers\nare increasingly less likely to remain unknown. Ibid.\nIndeed, the systems are able to identify “the caller’s geo­\ngraphic location with increasing specificity.” Ibid. Amici\ndisagree with this, see Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers et al. 8–12, and the present\ncase surely suggests that amici are right—since we know\nneither the identity of the tipster nor even the county from\nwhich the call was made. But assuming the Court is right\nabout the ease of identifying 911 callers, it proves abso­\nlutely nothing in the present case unless the anonymous\n6               PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncaller was aware of that fact. “It is the tipster’s belief in\nanonymity, not its reality, that will control his behavior.”\nId., at 10 (emphasis added). There is no reason to believe\nthat your average anonymous 911 tipster is aware that\n911 callers are readily identifiable.2\n                               II\n   All that has been said up to now assumes that the anon­\nymous caller made, at least in effect, an accusation of\ndrunken driving. But in fact she did not. She said that\nthe petitioners’ truck “ ‘[r]an [me] off the roadway.’ ” App.\n36a. That neither asserts that the driver was drunk nor\neven raises the likelihood that the driver was drunk. The\nmost it conveys is that the truck did some apparently\nnontypical thing that forced the tipster off the roadway,\nwhether partly or fully, temporarily or permanently. Who\nreally knows what (if anything) happened? The truck\nmight have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a\njaywalking pedestrian.\n   But let us assume the worst of the many possibilities:\nthat it was a careless, reckless, or even intentional ma­\nneuver that forced the tipster off the road. Lorenzo might\nhave been distracted by his use of a hands-free cell phone,\nsee Strayer, Drews, & Crouch, A Comparison of the Cell\nPhone Driver and the Drunk Driver, 48 Human Factors 381,\n388 (2006), or distracted by an intense sports argument with\nJosé, see D. Strayer et al., AAA Foundation for Traffic\nSafety, Measuring Cognitive Distraction in the Automobile\n28 (June 2013), online at https://www.aaafoundation.org/\nsites/default/files/MeasuringCognitiveDistractions.pdf as visited\nApr. 17, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n——————\n   2 The Court’s discussion of reliable 911 traceability has so little rele­\n\nvance to the present case that one must surmise it has been included\nmerely to assure officers in the future that anonymous 911 accusa­\ntions—even untraced ones—are not as suspect (and hence as unrelia­\nble) as other anonymous accusations. That is unfortunate.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    7\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nOr, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster\noff the road because of some personal animus, or hostility\nto her “Make Love, Not War” bumper sticker. I fail to see\nhow reasonable suspicion of a discrete instance of irregular\nor hazardous driving generates a reasonable suspicion of\nongoing intoxicated driving. What proportion of the hun­\ndreds of thousands—perhaps millions—of careless, reck­\nless, or intentional traffic violations committed each day is\nattributable to drunken drivers? I say 0.1 percent. I have\nno basis for that except my own guesswork. But unless\nthe Court has some basis in reality to believe that the\nproportion is many orders of magnitude above that—say 1\nin 10 or at least 1 in 20—it has no grounds for its unsup­\nported assertion that the tipster’s report in this case gave\nrise to a reasonable suspicion of drunken driving.\n   Bear in mind that that is the only basis for the stop that\nhas been asserted in this litigation.3 The stop required\nsuspicion of an ongoing crime, not merely suspicion of\nhaving run someone off the road earlier. And driving\nwhile being a careless or reckless person, unlike driving\nwhile being a drunk person, is not an ongoing crime. In\nother words, in order to stop the petitioners the officers\nhere not only had to assume without basis the accuracy of\nthe anonymous accusation but also had to posit an unlikely\nreason (drunkenness) for the accused behavior.\n   In sum, at the moment the police spotted the truck, it\nwas more than merely “possib[le]” that the petitioners\nwere not committing an ongoing traffic crime. United\nStates v. Arvizu, 534 U. S. 266, 277 (2002) (emphasis\n——————\n  3 The circumstances that may justify a stop under Terry v. Ohio, 392\n\nU. S. 1 (1968), to investigate past criminal activity are far from clear,\nsee United States v. Hensley, 469 U. S. 221, 229 (1985), and have not\nbeen discussed in this litigation. Hence, the Court says it “need not\naddress” that question. Ante, at 8, n. 2. I need not either. This case\nhas been litigated on the assumption that only suspicion of ongoing\nintoxicated or reckless driving could have supported this stop.\n8            PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nadded). It was overwhelmingly likely that they were not.\n                              III\n   It gets worse. Not only, it turns out, did the police have\nno good reason at first to believe that Lorenzo was driving\ndrunk, they had very good reason at last to know that he\nwas not. The Court concludes that the tip, plus confirma­\ntion of the truck’s location, produced reasonable suspicion\nthat the truck not only had been but still was barreling\ndangerously and drunkenly down Highway 1. Ante, at 8–\n10. In fact, alas, it was not, and the officers knew it. They\nfollowed the truck for five minutes, presumably to see if it\nwas being operated recklessly. And that was good police\nwork. While the anonymous tip was not enough to sup­\nport a stop for drunken driving under Terry v. Ohio, 392\nU. S. 1 (1968), it was surely enough to counsel observation\nof the truck to see if it was driven by a drunken driver.\nBut the pesky little detail left out of the Court’s reason-\nable-suspicion equation is that, for the five minutes that the\ntruck was being followed (five minutes is a long time),\nLorenzo’s driving was irreproachable. Had the officers\nwitnessed the petitioners violate a single traffic law, they\nwould have had cause to stop the truck, Whren v. United\nStates, 517 U. S. 806, 810 (1996), and this case would not\nbe before us. And not only was the driving irreproachable,\nbut the State offers no evidence to suggest that the peti­\ntioners even did anything suspicious, such as suddenly\nslowing down, pulling off to the side of the road, or turning\nsomewhere to see whether they were being followed. Cf.\nArvizu, supra, at 270–271, 277 (concluding that an officer’s\nsuspicion of criminality was enhanced when the driver,\nupon seeing that he was being followed, “slowed dramati­\ncally,” “appeared stiff,” and “seemed to be trying to pre­\ntend” that the patrol car was not there). Consequently,\nthe tip’s suggestion of ongoing drunken driving (if it could\nbe deemed to suggest that) not only went uncorroborated;\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nit was affirmatively undermined.\n   A hypothetical variation on the facts of this case illus­\ntrates the point. Suppose an anonymous tipster reports\nthat, while following near mile marker 88 a silver Ford\nF-150, license plate 8D949925, traveling southbound on\nHighway 1, she saw in the truck’s open cab several five­\nfoot-tall stacks of what was unmistakably baled cannabis.\nTwo minutes later, a highway patrolman spots the truck\nexactly where the tip suggested it would be, begins follow­\ning it, but sees nothing in the truck’s cab. It is not enough\nto say that the officer’s observation merely failed to cor­\nroborate the tipster’s accusation. It is more precise to say\nthat the officer’s observation discredited the informant’s\naccusation: The crime was supposedly occurring (and\nwould continue to occur) in plain view, but the police saw\nnothing. Similarly, here, the crime supposedly suggested\nby the tip was ongoing intoxicated driving, the hallmarks\nof which are many, readily identifiable, and difficult to\nconceal. That the officers witnessed nary a minor traffic\nviolation nor any other “sound indici[um] of drunk driv­\ning,” ante, at 8, strongly suggests that the suspected crime\nwas not occurring after all. The tip’s implication of con­\ntinuing criminality, already weak, grew even weaker.\n   Resisting this line of reasoning, the Court curiously\nasserts that, since drunk drivers who see marked squad\ncars in their rearview mirrors may evade detection simply\nby driving “more careful[ly],” the “absence of additional\nsuspicious conduct” is “hardly surprising” and thus largely\nirrelevant. Ante, at 10. Whether a drunk driver drives\ndrunkenly, the Court seems to think, is up to him. That is\nnot how I understand the influence of alcohol. I subscribe\nto the more traditional view that the dangers of intoxi-\ncated driving are the intoxicant’s impairing effects on the\nbody—effects that no mere act of the will can resist. See,\ne.g., A. Dasgupta, The Science of Drinking: How Alcohol\nAffects Your Body and Mind 39 (explaining that the physi­\n10           PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nological effect of a blood alcohol content between 0.08 and\n0.109, for example, is “sever[e] impair[ment]” of “[b]alance,\nspeech, hearing, and reaction time,” as well as one’s gen­\neral “ability to drive a motor vehicle”). Consistent with\nthis view, I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxi­\ncated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve\nonce can be expected to swerve again—and soon. If he\ndoes not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of\nirregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorrobo­\nrated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amend­\nment requires that he be left alone.\n                         *    *     *\n  The Court’s opinion serves up a freedom-destroying\ncocktail consisting of two parts patent falsity: (1) that\nanonymous 911 reports of traffic violations are reliable so\nlong as they correctly identify a car and its location, and\n(2) that a single instance of careless or reckless driving\nnecessarily supports a reasonable suspicion of drunken­\nness. All the malevolent 911 caller need do is assert a\ntraffic violation, and the targeted car will be stopped,\nforcibly if necessary, by the police. If the driver turns out\nnot to be drunk (which will almost always be the case), the\ncaller need fear no consequences, even if 911 knows his\nidentity. After all, he never alleged drunkenness, but\nmerely called in a traffic violation—and on that point his\nword is as good as his victim’s.\n  Drunken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of\nour freedom to come and go as we please without police\ninterference. To prevent and detect murder we do not\nallow searches without probable cause or targeted Terry\nstops without reasonable suspicion. We should not do so\nfor drunken driving either. After today’s opinion all of us\non the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of hav­\ning our freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of\ndrunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Their mo-\n  tion was denied, and they pleaded guilty to transporting marijuana.\n  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, concluding that the officer\n  had reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop.\nHeld: The traffic stop complied with the Fourth Amendment because,\n under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had reasonable\n suspicion that the truck’s driver was intoxicated. Pp. 3–11.\n    (a) The Fourth Amendment permits brief investigative stops when\n an officer has “a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the\n particular person stopped of . . . criminal activity.” United States v.\n Cortez, 449 U. S. 411, 417–418. Reasonable suspicion takes into ac-\n count “the totality of the circumstances,” id., at 417, and depends\n “upon both the content of information possessed by police and its de-\n gree of reliability,” Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325, 330. An anony-\n mous tip alone seldom demonstrates sufficient reliability, White, 496\n U. S., at 329, but may do so under appropriate circumstances, id., at\n 327. Pp. 3–5.\n    (b) The 911 call in this case bore adequate indicia of reliability for\n the officer to credit the caller’s account. By reporting that she had\n been run off the road by a specific vehicle, the caller necessarily\n claimed an eyewitness basis of knowledge. The apparently short\n time between the reported incident and the 911 call suggests that the\n2                 PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    caller had little time to fabricate the report. And a reasonable officer\n    could conclude that a false tipster would think twice before using the\n    911 system, which has several technological and regulatory features\n    that safeguard against making false reports with immunity. Pp. 5–8.\n      (c) Not only was the tip here reliable, but it also created reasonable\n    suspicion of drunk driving. Running another car off the road sug-\n    gests the sort of impairment that characterizes drunk driving. While\n    that conduct might be explained by another cause such as driver dis-\n    traction, reasonable suspicion “need not rule out the possibility of in-\n    nocent conduct.” United States v. Arvizu, 534 U. S. 266, 277. Finally,\n    the officer’s failure to observe additional suspicious conduct during\n    the short period that he followed the truck did not dispel the reason-\n    able suspicion of drunk driving, and the officer was not required to\n    surveil the truck for a longer period.

CALIFORNIA \n\n   ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF \n\n        CALIFORNIA, FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n                                 [April 22, 2014]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  After a 911 caller reported that a vehicle had run her off\nthe road, a police officer located the vehicle she identified\nduring the call and executed a traffic stop. We hold that\nthe stop complied with the Fourth Amendment because,\nunder the totality of the circumstances, the officer had\nreasonable suspicion that the driver was intoxicated.\n                             I\n   On August 23, 2008, a Mendocino County 911 dispatch\nteam for the California Highway Patrol (CHP) received a\ncall from another CHP dispatcher in neighboring Hum­\nboldt County. The Humboldt County dispatcher relayed a\ntip from a 911 caller, which the Mendocino County team\nrecorded as follows: “ ‘Showing southbound Highway 1 at\nmile marker 88, Silver Ford 150 pickup. Plate of 8-David­\n94925. Ran the reporting party off the roadway and was\nlast seen approximately five [minutes] ago.’ ” App. 36a.\nThe Mendocino County team then broadcast that infor­\nmation to CHP officers at 3:47 p.m.\n   A CHP officer heading northbound toward the reported\nvehicle responded to the broadcast. At 4:00 p.m., the\n2               PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nofficer passed the truck near mile marker 69. At about\n4:05 p.m., after making a U-turn, he pulled the truck over.\nA second officer, who had separately responded to the\nbroadcast, also arrived on the scene. As the two officers\napproached the truck, they smelled marijuana. A search\nof the truck bed revealed 30 pounds of marijuana. The\nofficers arrested the driver, petitioner Lorenzo Prado\nNavarette, and the passenger, petitioner José Prado\nNavarette.\n  Petitioners moved to suppress the evidence, arguing\nthat the traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment\nbecause the officer lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal\nactivity. Both the magistrate who presided over the sup­\npression hearing and the Superior Court disagreed.1\nPetitioners pleaded guilty to transporting marijuana and\nwere sentenced to 90 days in jail plus three years of\nprobation.\n  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, concluding\nthat the officer had reasonable suspicion to conduct an\ninvestigative stop. 2012 WL 4842651 (Oct. 12, 2012). The\ncourt reasoned that the content of the tip indicated that it\ncame from an eyewitness victim of reckless driving, and\nthat the officer’s corroboration of the truck’s description,\nlocation, and direction established that the tip was reliable\nenough to justify a traffic stop. Id., at *7. Finally, the\ncourt concluded that the caller reported driving that was\nsufficiently dangerous to merit an investigative stop with­\nout waiting for the officer to observe additional reckless\ndriving himself. Id., at *9. The California Supreme Court\n——————\n   1 At the suppression hearing, counsel for petitioners did not dispute\n\nthat the reporting party identified herself by name in the 911 call\nrecording. Because neither the caller nor the Humboldt County dis­\npatcher who received the call was present at the hearing, however, the\nprosecution did not introduce the recording into evidence. The prosecu­\ntion proceeded to treat the tip as anonymous, and the lower courts\nfollowed suit. See 2012 WL 4842651, *6 (Cal. Ct. App., Oct. 12, 2012).\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

S. ___\n(2013), and now affirm.\n                             II\n  The Fourth Amendment permits brief investigative\nstops—such as the traffic stop in this case—when a law\nenforcement officer has “a particularized and objective\nbasis for suspecting the particular person stopped of crim­\ninal activity.” United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411, 417–\n418 (1981); see also Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–22\n(1968). The “reasonable suspicion” necessary to justify\nsuch a stop “is dependent upon both the content of infor­\nmation possessed by police and its degree of reliability.”\nAlabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325, 330 (1990). The stand­\nard takes into account “the totality of the circumstances—\nthe whole picture.” Cortez, supra, at 417. Although a\nmere “ ‘hunch’ ” does not create reasonable suspicion,\nTerry, supra, at 27, the level of suspicion the standard\nrequires is “considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by\na preponderance of the evidence,” and “obviously less”\nthan is necessary for probable cause, United States v.\nSokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 7 (1989).\n                              A\n   These principles apply with full force to investigative\nstops based on information from anonymous tips. We\nhave firmly rejected the argument “that reasonable cause\nfor a[n investigative stop] can only be based on the officer’s\npersonal observation, rather than on information supplied\nby another person.” Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143,\n147 (1972). Of course, “an anonymous tip alone seldom\ndemonstrates the informant’s basis of knowledge or verac­\nity.” White, 496 U. S., at 329 (emphasis added). That is\nbecause “ordinary citizens generally do not provide exten­\nsive recitations of the basis of their everyday observa­\ntions,” and an anonymous tipster’s veracity is “ ‘by hypoth­\n4            PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nesis largely unknown, and unknowable.’ ” Ibid. But under\nappropriate circumstances, an anonymous tip can demon­\nstrate “sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasona­\nble suspicion to make [an] investigatory stop.” Id., at 327.\n   Our decisions in Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325 (1990),\nand Florida v. J. L., 529 U. S. 266 (2000), are useful\nguides. In White, an anonymous tipster told the police\nthat a woman would drive from a particular apartment\nbuilding to a particular motel in a brown Plymouth station\nwagon with a broken right tail light. The tipster further\nasserted that the woman would be transporting cocaine.\n496 U. S., at 327. After confirming the innocent details,\nofficers stopped the station wagon as it neared the motel\nand found cocaine in the vehicle. Id., at 331. We held that\nthe officers’ corroboration of certain details made the\nanonymous tip sufficiently reliable to create reasonable\nsuspicion of criminal activity. By accurately predicting\nfuture behavior, the tipster demonstrated “a special famil­\niarity with respondent’s affairs,” which in turn implied\nthat the tipster had “access to reliable information about\nthat individual’s illegal activities.” Id., at 332. We also\nrecognized that an informant who is proved to tell the\ntruth about some things is more likely to tell the truth\nabout other things, “including the claim that the object of\nthe tip is engaged in criminal activity.” Id., at 331 (citing\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 244 (1983)).\n   In J. L., by contrast, we determined that no reasonable\nsuspicion arose from a bare-bones tip that a young black\nmale in a plaid shirt standing at a bus stop was carrying a\ngun. 529 U. S., at 268. The tipster did not explain how he\nknew about the gun, nor did he suggest that he had any\nspecial familiarity with the young man’s affairs. Id., at\n271. As a result, police had no basis for believing “that the\ntipster ha[d] knowledge of concealed criminal activity.”\nId., at 272. Furthermore, the tip included no predictions\nof future behavior that could be corroborated to assess the\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntipster’s credibility. Id., at 271. We accordingly concluded\nthat the tip was insufficiently reliable to justify a stop and\nfrisk.\n                                B\n   The initial question in this case is whether the 911 call\nwas sufficiently reliable to credit the allegation that peti­\ntioners’ truck “ran the [caller] off the roadway.” Even\nassuming for present purposes that the 911 call was anon­\nymous, see n. 1, supra, we conclude that the call bore\nadequate indicia of reliability for the officer to credit the\ncaller’s account. The officer was therefore justified in\nproceeding from the premise that the truck had, in fact,\ncaused the caller’s car to be dangerously diverted from the\nhighway.\n   By reporting that she had been run off the road by a\nspecific vehicle—a silver Ford F-150 pickup, license plate\n8D94925—the caller necessarily claimed eyewitness\nknowledge of the alleged dangerous driving. That basis of\nknowledge lends significant support to the tip’s reliability.\nSee Gates, supra, at 234 (“[An informant’s] explicit and\ndetailed description of alleged wrongdoing, along with a\nstatement that the event was observed firsthand, entitles\nhis tip to greater weight than might otherwise be the\ncase”); Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410, 416 (1969)\n(a tip of illegal gambling is less reliable when “it is not\nalleged that the informant personally observed [the de­\nfendant] at work or that he had ever placed a bet with\nhim”). This is in contrast to J. L., where the tip provided\nno basis for concluding that the tipster had actually seen\nthe gun. 529 U. S., at 271. Even in White, where we\nupheld the stop, there was scant evidence that the tipster\nhad actually observed cocaine in the station wagon. We\ncalled White a “ ‘close case’ ” because “[k]nowledge about a\nperson’s future movements indicates some familiarity with\nthat person’s affairs, but having such knowledge does not\n6            PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessarily imply that the informant knows, in particular,\nwhether that person is carrying hidden contraband.” 529\nU. S., at 271. A driver’s claim that another vehicle ran her\noff the road, however, necessarily implies that the inform­\nant knows the other car was driven dangerously.\n   There is also reason to think that the 911 caller in this\ncase was telling the truth. Police confirmed the truck’s\nlocation near mile marker 69 (roughly 19 highway miles\nsouth of the location reported in the 911 call) at 4:00 p.m.\n(roughly 18 minutes after the 911 call). That timeline of\nevents suggests that the caller reported the incident soon\nafter she was run off the road. That sort of contemporane­\nous report has long been treated as especially reliable. In\nevidence law, we generally credit the proposition that\nstatements about an event and made soon after perceiving\nthat event are especially trustworthy because “substantial\ncontemporaneity of event and statement negate the likeli­\nhood of deliberate or conscious misrepresentation.” Advi­\nsory Committee’s Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 803(1), 28\nU. S. C. App., p. 371 (describing the rationale for the\nhearsay exception for “present sense impression[s]”). A\nsimilar rationale applies to a “statement relating to a\nstartling event”—such as getting run off the road—“made\nwhile the declarant was under the stress of excitement\nthat it caused.” Fed. Rule Evid. 803(2) (hearsay exception\nfor “excited utterances”). Unsurprisingly, 911 calls that\nwould otherwise be inadmissible hearsay have often been\nadmitted on those grounds. See D. Binder, Hearsay\nHandbook §8.1, pp. 257–259 (4th ed. 2013–2014) (citing\ncases admitting 911 calls as present sense impressions);\nid., §9.1, at 274–275 (911 calls admitted as excited utter­\nances). There was no indication that the tip in J. L. (or\neven in White) was contemporaneous with the observation\nof criminal activity or made under the stress of excitement\ncaused by a startling event, but those considerations\nweigh in favor of the caller’s veracity here.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Another indicator of veracity is the caller’s use of the\n911 emergency system. See Brief for Respondent 40–41,\n44; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16–18. A 911\ncall has some features that allow for identifying and trac­\ning callers, and thus provide some safeguards against\nmaking false reports with immunity. See J. L., supra, at\n276 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). As this case illustrates,\nsee n. 1, supra, 911 calls can be recorded, which provides\nvictims with an opportunity to identify the false tipster’s\nvoice and subject him to prosecution, see, e.g., Cal. Penal\nCode Ann. §653x (West 2010) (makes “telephon[ing] the\n911 emergency line with the intent to annoy or harass”\npunishable by imprisonment and fine); see also §148.3\n(2014 West Cum. Supp.) (prohibits falsely reporting “that\nan ‘emergency’ exists”); §148.5 (prohibits falsely reporting\n“that a felony or misdemeanor has been committed”). The\n911 system also permits law enforcement to verify im­\nportant information about the caller. In 1998, the Federal\nCommunications Commission (FCC) began to require\ncellular carriers to relay the caller’s phone number to 911\ndispatchers. 47 CFR §20.18(d)(1) (2013) (FCC’s “Phase I\nenhanced 911 services” requirements). Beginning in 2001,\ncarriers have been required to identify the caller’s geo­\ngraphic location with increasing specificity. §§20.18(e)–(h)\n(“Phase II enhanced 911 service” requirements). And\nalthough callers may ordinarily block call recipients from\nobtaining their identifying information, FCC regulations\nexempt 911 calls from that privilege.           §§64.1601(b),\n(d)(4)(ii) (“911 emergency services” exemption from rule\nthat, when a caller so requests, “a carrier may not reveal\nthat caller’s number or name”). None of this is to suggest\nthat tips in 911 calls are per se reliable. Given the forego­\ning technological and regulatory developments, however, a\nreasonable officer could conclude that a false tipster would\nthink twice before using such a system. The caller’s use of\nthe 911 system is therefore one of the relevant circum­\n8               PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstances that, taken together, justified the officer’s reliance\non the information reported in the 911 call.\n                               C\n   Even a reliable tip will justify an investigative stop only\nif it creates reasonable suspicion that “criminal activity\nmay be afoot.” Terry, 392 U. S., at 30. We must therefore\ndetermine whether the 911 caller’s report of being run off\nthe roadway created reasonable suspicion of an ongoing\ncrime such as drunk driving as opposed to an isolated\nepisode of past recklessness. See Cortez, 449 U. S., at 417\n(“An investigatory stop must be justified by some objective\nmanifestation that the person stopped is, or is about to be,\nengaged in criminal activity”). We conclude that the\nbehavior alleged by the 911 caller, “viewed from the\nstandpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer,\namount[s] to reasonable suspicion” of drunk driving.\nOrnelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696 (1996). The\nstop was therefore proper.2\n   Reasonable suspicion depends on “ ‘ “the factual and\npractical considerations of everyday life on which reason-\nable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.” ’ ” Id., at\n695. Under that commonsense approach, we can appro­\npriately recognize certain driving behaviors as sound\nindicia of drunk driving. See, e.g., People v. Wells,\n38 Cal. 4th 1078, 1081, 136 P. 3d 810, 811 (2006) (“ ‘weav­\ning all over the roadway’ ”); State v.

W. 2d 625, 626 (Iowa 2001) (“driving in\nthe median”). Indeed, the accumulated experience of\nthousands of officers suggests that these sorts of erratic\nbehaviors are strongly correlated with drunk driving.\nSee Nat. Highway Traffic Safety Admin., The Visual\nDetection of DWI Motorists 4–5 (Mar. 2010), online at\nhttp://nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/nti/pdf/808677.pdf (as visited\nApr. 18, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\nOf course, not all traffic infractions imply intoxication.\nUnconfirmed reports of driving without a seatbelt or\nslightly over the speed limit, for example, are so tenuously\nconnected to drunk driving that a stop on those grounds\nalone would be constitutionally suspect. But a reliable tip\nalleging the dangerous behaviors discussed above gener-\nally would justify a traffic stop on suspicion of drunk\ndriving.\n   The 911 caller in this case reported more than a minor\ntraffic infraction and more than a conclusory allegation of\ndrunk or reckless driving. Instead, she alleged a specific\nand dangerous result of the driver’s conduct: running\nanother car off the highway. That conduct bears too great\na resemblance to paradigmatic manifestations of drunk\ndriving to be dismissed as an isolated example of reckless­\nness. Running another vehicle off the road suggests lane­\npositioning problems, decreased vigilance, impaired judg­\nment, or some combination of those recognized drunk\ndriving cues. See Visual Detection of DWI Motorists 4–5.\nAnd the experience of many officers suggests that a driver\nwho almost strikes a vehicle or another object—the exact\nscenario that ordinarily causes “running [another vehicle]\noff the roadway”—is likely intoxicated. See id., at 5, 8.\nAs a result, we cannot say that the officer acted unreason­\nably under these circumstances in stopping a driver\nwhose alleged conduct was a significant indicator of drunk\ndriving.\n   Petitioners’ attempts to second-guess the officer’s rea­\n10           PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsonable suspicion of drunk driving are unavailing. It is\ntrue that the reported behavior might also be explained\nby, for example, a driver responding to “an unruly child or\nother distraction.” Brief for Petitioners 21. But we have\nconsistently recognized that reasonable suspicion “need\nnot rule out the possibility of innocent conduct.” United\nStates v. Arvizu, 534 U. S. 266, 277 (2002).\n   Nor did the absence of additional suspicious conduct,\nafter the vehicle was first spotted by an officer, dispel the\nreasonable suspicion of drunk driving. Brief for Petition­\ners 23–24. It is hardly surprising that the appearance of a\nmarked police car would inspire more careful driving for a\ntime. Cf. Arvizu, supra, at 275 (“ ‘[s]lowing down after\nspotting a law enforcement vehicle’ ” does not dispel rea­\nsonable suspicion of criminal activity). Extended observa­\ntion of an allegedly drunk driver might eventually dispel a\nreasonable suspicion of intoxication, but the 5-minute\nperiod in this case hardly sufficed in that regard. Of\ncourse, an officer who already has such a reasonable sus­\npicion need not surveil a vehicle at length in order to\npersonally observe suspicious driving. See Adams v.\nWilliams, 407 U. S., at 147 (repudiating the argument\nthat “reasonable cause for a[n investigative stop] can only\nbe based on the officer’s personal observation”). Once\nreasonable suspicion of drunk driving arises, “[t]he rea­\nsonableness of the officer’s decision to stop a suspect does\nnot turn on the availability of less intrusive investigatory\ntechniques.” Sokolow, 490 U. S., at 11. This would be a\nparticularly inappropriate context to depart from that\nsettled rule, because allowing a drunk driver a second\nchance for dangerous conduct could have disastrous\nconsequences.\n                              III\n  Like White, this is a “close case.” 496 U. S., at 332. As\nin that case, the indicia of the 911 caller’s reliability here\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Alt­\nhough the indicia present here are different from those we\nfound sufficient in White, there is more than one way to\ndemonstrate “a particularized and objective basis for\nsuspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activ­\nity.” Cortez, 449 U. S., at 417–418. Under the totality of\nthe circumstances, we find the indicia of reliability in this\ncase sufficient to provide the officer with reasonable suspi­\ncion that the driver of the reported vehicle had run another\nvehicle off the road. That made it reasonable under the\ncircumstances for the officer to execute a traffic stop.

People v. Wells, 38\nCal. 4th l078, 1082, 136 P. 3d 810, 812, (2006). See also,\ne.g., United States v. Wheat, 278 F. 3d 722, 729–730 (CA8\n2001); State v. Walshire, 634 N. W. 2d 625, 626–627, 630\n(Iowa 2001). Today’s opinion does not explicitly adopt\nsuch a departure from our normal Fourth Amendment\nrequirement that anonymous tips must be corroborated; it\npurports to adhere to our prior cases, such as Florida v.\nJ. L., 529 U. S. 266 (2000), and Alabama v. White, 496\nU. S. 325 (1990). Be not deceived.\n   Law enforcement agencies follow closely our judgments\non matters such as this, and they will identify at once our\nnew rule: So long as the caller identifies where the car is,\nanonymous claims of a single instance of possibly careless\nor reckless driving, called in to 911, will support a traffic\nstop. This is not my concept, and I am sure would not be\nthe Framers’, of a people secure from unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. I would reverse the judgment of\n2              PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court of Appeal of California.\n                                    I\n    The California Highway Patrol in this case knew noth­\ning about the tipster on whose word—and that alone—\nthey seized Lorenzo and José Prado Navarette. They did\nnot know her name.1 They did not know her phone num­\nber or address. They did not even know where she called\nfrom (she may have dialed in from a neighboring county,\nApp. 33a–34a).\n    The tipster said the truck had “[run her] off the road­\nway,” id., at 36a, but the police had no reason to credit\nthat charge and many reasons to doubt it, beginning with\nthe peculiar fact that the accusation was anonymous.\n“[E]liminating accountability . . . is ordinarily the very\npurpose of anonymity.”              McIntyre v. Ohio Elections\nComm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 385 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nThe unnamed tipster “can lie with impunity,” J. L., supra,\nat 275 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Anonymity is especially\nsuspicious with respect to the call that is the subject of the\npresent case. When does a victim complain to the police\nabout an arguably criminal act (running the victim off the\nroad) without giving his identity, so that he can accuse\nand testify when the culprit is caught?\n    The question before us, the Court agrees, ante, at 8, is\nwhether the “content of information possessed by police\nand its degree of reliability,” White, 496 U. S., at 330, gave\nthe officers reasonable suspicion that the driver of the\ntruck (Lorenzo) was committing an ongoing crime. When\nthe only source of the government’s information is an\ninformant’s tip, we ask whether the tip bears sufficient\n“ ‘indicia of reliability,’ ” id., at 328, to establish “a particu­\nlarized and objective basis for suspecting the particular\n——————\n  1 There was some indication below that the tipster was a woman. See\n\nApp. 18a. Beyond that detail, we must, as the Court notes, ante, at 2,\nn. 1, assume that the identity of the tipster was unknown.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S. 411, 417–418 (1981).\n   The most extreme case, before this one, in which an\nanonymous tip was found to meet this standard was\nWhite, supra. There the reliability of the tip was estab­\nlished by the fact that it predicted the target’s behavior in\nthe finest detail—a detail that could be known only by\nsomeone familiar with the target’s business: She would,\nthe tipster said, leave a particular apartment building, get\ninto a brown Plymouth station wagon with a broken right\ntail light, and drive immediately to a particular motel.\nId., at 327. Very few persons would have such intimate\nknowledge, and hence knowledge of the unobservable fact\nthat the woman was carrying unlawful drugs was plausi­\nble. Id., at 332. Here the Court makes a big deal of the\nfact that the tipster was dead right about the fact that a\nsilver Ford F-150 truck (license plate 8D94925) was trav­\neling south on Highway 1 somewhere near mile marker\n88. But everyone in the world who saw the car would have\nthat knowledge, and anyone who wanted the car stopped\nwould have to provide that information. Unlike the situa­\ntion in White, that generally available knowledge in no\nway makes it plausible that the tipster saw the car run\nsomeone off the road.\n   The Court says, ante, at 5, that “[b]y reporting that she\nhad been run off the road by a specific vehicle . . . the\ncaller necessarily claimed eyewitness knowledge.” So\nwhat? The issue is not how she claimed to know, but\nwhether what she claimed to know was true. The claim to\n“eyewitness knowledge” of being run off the road supports\nnot at all its veracity; nor does the amazing, mystifying\nprediction (so far short of what existed in White) that the\npetitioners’ truck would be heading south on Highway 1.\n   The Court finds “reason to think” that the informant\n“was telling the truth” in the fact that police observation\nconfirmed that the truck had been driving near the spot at\n4             PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwhich, and at the approximate time at which, the tipster\nalleged she had been run off the road. Ante, at 6. Accord­\ning to the Court, the statement therefore qualifies as a\n“ ‘present sense impression’ ” or “ ‘excited utterance,’ ” kinds\nof hearsay that the law deems categorically admissible\ngiven their low likelihood of reflecting “ ‘deliberate or\nconscious misrepresentation.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Advisory\nCommittee’s Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 803(1), 28 U. S. C.\nApp., p. 371). So, the Court says, we can fairly suppose\nthat the accusation was true.\n   No, we cannot. To begin with, it is questionable whether\neither the “present sense impression” or the “excited ut­\nterance” exception to the hearsay rule applies here. The\nclassic “present sense impression” is the recounting of an\nevent that is occurring before the declarant’s eyes, as the\ndeclarant is speaking (“I am watching the Hindenburg\nexplode!”). See 2 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence 362\n(7th ed. 2013) (hereinafter McCormick). And the classic\n“excited utterance” is a statement elicited, almost involun­\ntarily, by the shock of what the declarant is immediately\nwitnessing (“My God, those people will be killed!”). See\nid., at 368–369. It is the immediacy that gives the state­\nment some credibility; the declarant has not had time to\ndissemble or embellish. There is no such immediacy here.\nThe declarant had time to observe the license number of\nthe offending vehicle, 8D94925 (a difficult task if she was\nforced off the road and the vehicle was speeding away), to\nbring her car to a halt, to copy down the observed license\nnumber (presumably), and (if she was using her own cell\nphone) to dial a call to the police from the stopped car.\nPlenty of time to dissemble or embellish.\n   Moreover, even assuming that less than true immediacy\nwill suffice for these hearsay exceptions to apply, the\ntipster’s statement would run into additional barriers to\nadmissibility and acceptance. According to the very Advi­\nsory Committee’s Notes from which the Court quotes,\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncases addressing an unidentified declarant’s present sense\nimpression “indicate hesitancy in upholding the statement\nalone as sufficient” proof of the reported event. 28 U. S. C.\nApp., at 371; see also 7 M. Graham, Handbook of Federal\nEvidence 19–20 (7th ed. 2012). For excited utterances as\nwell, the “knotty theoretical” question of statement-alone\nadmissibility persists—seemingly even when the declarant\nis known. 2 McCormick 368. “Some courts . . . have taken\nthe position that an excited utterance is admissible only if\nother proof is presented which supports a finding of fact\nthat the exciting event did occur. The issue has not yet\nbeen resolved under the Federal Rules.” Id., at 367–368\n(footnote omitted). It is even unsettled whether excited\nutterances of an unknown declarant are ever admissible.\nA leading treatise reports that “the courts have been\nreluctant to admit such statements, principally because of\nuncertainty that foundational requirements, including the\nimpact of the event on the declarant, have been satisfied.”\nId., at 372. In sum, it is unlikely that the law of evidence\nwould deem the mystery caller in this case “especially\ntrustworthy,” ante, at 6.\n   Finally, and least tenably, the Court says that another\n“indicator of veracity” is the anonymous tipster’s mere\n“use of the 911 emergency system,” ante, at 7. Because,\nyou see, recent “technological and regulatory develop­\nments” suggest that the identities of unnamed 911 callers\nare increasingly less likely to remain unknown. Ibid.\nIndeed, the systems are able to identify “the caller’s geo­\ngraphic location with increasing specificity.” Ibid. Amici\ndisagree with this, see Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers et al. 8–12, and the present\ncase surely suggests that amici are right—since we know\nneither the identity of the tipster nor even the county from\nwhich the call was made. But assuming the Court is right\nabout the ease of identifying 911 callers, it proves abso­\nlutely nothing in the present case unless the anonymous\n6               PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncaller was aware of that fact. “It is the tipster’s belief in\nanonymity, not its reality, that will control his behavior.”\nId., at 10 (emphasis added). There is no reason to believe\nthat your average anonymous 911 tipster is aware that\n911 callers are readily identifiable.2\n                               II\n   All that has been said up to now assumes that the anon­\nymous caller made, at least in effect, an accusation of\ndrunken driving. But in fact she did not. She said that\nthe petitioners’ truck “ ‘[r]an [me] off the roadway.’ ” App.\n36a. That neither asserts that the driver was drunk nor\neven raises the likelihood that the driver was drunk. The\nmost it conveys is that the truck did some apparently\nnontypical thing that forced the tipster off the roadway,\nwhether partly or fully, temporarily or permanently. Who\nreally knows what (if anything) happened? The truck\nmight have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a\njaywalking pedestrian.\n   But let us assume the worst of the many possibilities:\nthat it was a careless, reckless, or even intentional ma­\nneuver that forced the tipster off the road. Lorenzo might\nhave been distracted by his use of a hands-free cell phone,\nsee Strayer, Drews, & Crouch, A Comparison of the Cell\nPhone Driver and the Drunk Driver, 48 Human Factors 381,\n388 (2006), or distracted by an intense sports argument with\nJosé, see D. Strayer et al., AAA Foundation for Traffic\nSafety, Measuring Cognitive Distraction in the Automobile\n28 (June 2013), online at https://www.aaafoundation.org/\nsites/default/files/MeasuringCognitiveDistractions.pdf as visited\nApr. 17, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n——————\n   2 The Court’s discussion of reliable 911 traceability has so little rele­\n\nvance to the present case that one must surmise it has been included\nmerely to assure officers in the future that anonymous 911 accusa­\ntions—even untraced ones—are not as suspect (and hence as unrelia­\nble) as other anonymous accusations. That is unfortunate.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    7\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nOr, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster\noff the road because of some personal animus, or hostility\nto her “Make Love, Not War” bumper sticker. I fail to see\nhow reasonable suspicion of a discrete instance of irregular\nor hazardous driving generates a reasonable suspicion of\nongoing intoxicated driving. What proportion of the hun­\ndreds of thousands—perhaps millions—of careless, reck­\nless, or intentional traffic violations committed each day is\nattributable to drunken drivers? I say 0.1 percent. I have\nno basis for that except my own guesswork. But unless\nthe Court has some basis in reality to believe that the\nproportion is many orders of magnitude above that—say 1\nin 10 or at least 1 in 20—it has no grounds for its unsup­\nported assertion that the tipster’s report in this case gave\nrise to a reasonable suspicion of drunken driving.\n   Bear in mind that that is the only basis for the stop that\nhas been asserted in this litigation.3 The stop required\nsuspicion of an ongoing crime, not merely suspicion of\nhaving run someone off the road earlier. And driving\nwhile being a careless or reckless person, unlike driving\nwhile being a drunk person, is not an ongoing crime. In\nother words, in order to stop the petitioners the officers\nhere not only had to assume without basis the accuracy of\nthe anonymous accusation but also had to posit an unlikely\nreason (drunkenness) for the accused behavior.\n   In sum, at the moment the police spotted the truck, it\nwas more than merely “possib[le]” that the petitioners\nwere not committing an ongoing traffic crime. United\nStates v. Arvizu, 534 U. S. 266, 277 (2002) (emphasis\n——————\n  3 The circumstances that may justify a stop under Terry v. Ohio, 392\n\nU. S. 1 (1968), to investigate past criminal activity are far from clear,\nsee United States v. Hensley, 469 U. S. 221, 229 (1985), and have not\nbeen discussed in this litigation. Hence, the Court says it “need not\naddress” that question. Ante, at 8, n. 2. I need not either. This case\nhas been litigated on the assumption that only suspicion of ongoing\nintoxicated or reckless driving could have supported this stop.\n8            PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nadded). It was overwhelmingly likely that they were not.\n                              III\n   It gets worse. Not only, it turns out, did the police have\nno good reason at first to believe that Lorenzo was driving\ndrunk, they had very good reason at last to know that he\nwas not. The Court concludes that the tip, plus confirma­\ntion of the truck’s location, produced reasonable suspicion\nthat the truck not only had been but still was barreling\ndangerously and drunkenly down Highway 1. Ante, at 8–\n10. In fact, alas, it was not, and the officers knew it. They\nfollowed the truck for five minutes, presumably to see if it\nwas being operated recklessly. And that was good police\nwork. While the anonymous tip was not enough to sup­\nport a stop for drunken driving under Terry v. Ohio, 392\nU. S. 1 (1968), it was surely enough to counsel observation\nof the truck to see if it was driven by a drunken driver.\nBut the pesky little detail left out of the Court’s reason-\nable-suspicion equation is that, for the five minutes that the\ntruck was being followed (five minutes is a long time),\nLorenzo’s driving was irreproachable. Had the officers\nwitnessed the petitioners violate a single traffic law, they\nwould have had cause to stop the truck, Whren v. United\nStates, 517 U. S. 806, 810 (1996), and this case would not\nbe before us. And not only was the driving irreproachable,\nbut the State offers no evidence to suggest that the peti­\ntioners even did anything suspicious, such as suddenly\nslowing down, pulling off to the side of the road, or turning\nsomewhere to see whether they were being followed. Cf.\nArvizu, supra, at 270–271, 277 (concluding that an officer’s\nsuspicion of criminality was enhanced when the driver,\nupon seeing that he was being followed, “slowed dramati­\ncally,” “appeared stiff,” and “seemed to be trying to pre­\ntend” that the patrol car was not there). Consequently,\nthe tip’s suggestion of ongoing drunken driving (if it could\nbe deemed to suggest that) not only went uncorroborated;\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nit was affirmatively undermined.\n   A hypothetical variation on the facts of this case illus­\ntrates the point. Suppose an anonymous tipster reports\nthat, while following near mile marker 88 a silver Ford\nF-150, license plate 8D949925, traveling southbound on\nHighway 1, she saw in the truck’s open cab several five­\nfoot-tall stacks of what was unmistakably baled cannabis.\nTwo minutes later, a highway patrolman spots the truck\nexactly where the tip suggested it would be, begins follow­\ning it, but sees nothing in the truck’s cab. It is not enough\nto say that the officer’s observation merely failed to cor­\nroborate the tipster’s accusation. It is more precise to say\nthat the officer’s observation discredited the informant’s\naccusation: The crime was supposedly occurring (and\nwould continue to occur) in plain view, but the police saw\nnothing. Similarly, here, the crime supposedly suggested\nby the tip was ongoing intoxicated driving, the hallmarks\nof which are many, readily identifiable, and difficult to\nconceal. That the officers witnessed nary a minor traffic\nviolation nor any other “sound indici[um] of drunk driv­\ning,” ante, at 8, strongly suggests that the suspected crime\nwas not occurring after all. The tip’s implication of con­\ntinuing criminality, already weak, grew even weaker.\n   Resisting this line of reasoning, the Court curiously\nasserts that, since drunk drivers who see marked squad\ncars in their rearview mirrors may evade detection simply\nby driving “more careful[ly],” the “absence of additional\nsuspicious conduct” is “hardly surprising” and thus largely\nirrelevant. Ante, at 10. Whether a drunk driver drives\ndrunkenly, the Court seems to think, is up to him. That is\nnot how I understand the influence of alcohol. I subscribe\nto the more traditional view that the dangers of intoxi-\ncated driving are the intoxicant’s impairing effects on the\nbody—effects that no mere act of the will can resist. See,\ne.g., A. Dasgupta, The Science of Drinking: How Alcohol\nAffects Your Body and Mind 39 (explaining that the physi­\n10           PRADO NAVARETTE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nological effect of a blood alcohol content between 0.08 and\n0.109, for example, is “sever[e] impair[ment]” of “[b]alance,\nspeech, hearing, and reaction time,” as well as one’s gen­\neral “ability to drive a motor vehicle”). Consistent with\nthis view, I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxi­\ncated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve\nonce can be expected to swerve again—and soon. If he\ndoes not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of\nirregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorrobo­\nrated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amend­\nment requires that he be left alone.\n                         *    *     *\n  The Court’s opinion serves up a freedom-destroying\ncocktail consisting of two parts patent falsity: (1) that\nanonymous 911 reports of traffic violations are reliable so\nlong as they correctly identify a car and its location, and\n(2) that a single instance of careless or reckless driving\nnecessarily supports a reasonable suspicion of drunken­\nness. All the malevolent 911 caller need do is assert a\ntraffic violation, and the targeted car will be stopped,\nforcibly if necessary, by the police. If the driver turns out\nnot to be drunk (which will almost always be the case), the\ncaller need fear no consequences, even if 911 knows his\nidentity. After all, he never alleged drunkenness, but\nmerely called in a traffic violation—and on that point his\nword is as good as his victim’s.\n  Drunken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of\nour freedom to come and go as we please without police\ninterference. To prevent and detect murder we do not\nallow searches without probable cause or targeted Terry\nstops without reasonable suspicion. We should not do so\nfor drunken driving either. After today’s opinion all of us\non the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of hav­\ning our freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of\ndrunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a\n                  Cite as: 572 U.
