WOODALL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12–794.      Argued December 11, 2013—Decided April 23, 2014\nRespondent pleaded guilty to capital murder, capital kidnaping, and\n  first-degree rape, the statutory aggravating circumstance for the\n  murder. He was sentenced to death after the trial court denied de-\n  fense counsel’s request to instruct the jury not to draw any adverse\n  inference from respondent’s decision not to testify at the penalty\n  phase. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed, finding that the Fifth\n  Amendment’s requirement of a no-adverse-inference instruction to\n  protect a nontestifying defendant at the guilt phase, see Carter v.\n  Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, is not required at the penalty phase. Subse-\n  quently, the Federal District Court granted respondent habeas relief,\n  holding that the trial court’s refusal to give the requested instruction\n  violated respondent’s privilege against self-incrimination. The Sixth\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the Kentucky Supreme Court’s rejection of respondent’s\n Fifth Amendment claim was not objectively unreasonable, the Sixth\n Circuit erred in granting the writ. Pp. 3–12.\n    (a) The difficult-to-meet standard of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) permits a\n court to grant federal habeas relief on a claim already “adjudicated\n on the merits in State court” only if that adjudication “resulted in a\n decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica-\n tion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this]\n Court.” “ ‘[C]learly established Federal law’ ” includes only “ ‘the\n holdings” of the Court’s decisions,’ ” Howes v. Fields, 565 U. S. ___,\n ___; and an “unreasonable application of ” those holdings must be\n “ ‘objectively unreasonable,’ ” Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 75–\n 76. The state-court ruling must rest on “an error well understood\n and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fair-\n minded disagreement.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___.\n2                          WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n      Here, the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion was not “contrary\n    to” the Court’s holdings in Carter, supra, which required a no-\n    adverse-inference instruction at the guilt phase; in Estelle v. Smith,\n    451 U. S. 454, which concerned the introduction at the penalty phase\n    of the results of an involuntary, un-Mirandized pretrial psychiatric\n    examination; or in Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314, 327–330,\n    which disapproved a trial judge’s drawing of an adverse inference\n    from the defendant’s silence at sentencing “with regard to factual de-\n    terminations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.”\n    Nor was the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion an unreasonable\n    application of the holdings in those cases. This Court need not decide\n    whether a no-adverse-inference instruction is required in these cir-\n    cumstances, for the issue before the Kentucky Supreme Court was, at\n    a minimum, not “beyond any possibility for fairminded disagree-\n    ment,” Harrington, supra, at ___. Mitchell in particular leaves open\n    the possibility that some inferences might permissibly be drawn from\n    a defendant’s penalty-phase silence. Thus, it cannot be read to re-\n    quire the type of blanket no-adverse-inference instruction requested\n    and denied here. Moreover, because respondent’s own admissions of\n    guilt had established every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the\n    burden of proof, Mitchell’s narrow holding, which implied that it was\n    limited to inferences pertaining to the facts of the crime, does not ap-\n    ply. Pp. 3–9.\n      (b) Respondent contends that the state court was unreasonable in\n    refusing to extend a governing legal principle to a context in which it\n    should have controlled, but this Court has never adopted such a rule.\n    Section 2254(d)(1) provides a remedy for instances in which a state\n    court unreasonably applies this Court’s precedent; it does not require\n    state courts to extend that precedent or license federal courts to treat\n    the failure to do so as error. The appropriate time to consider, as a\n    matter of first impression, whether Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell re-\n    quire a penalty-phase no-adverse-inference instruction would be on\n    direct review, not in a habeas case governed by §2254(d).

After\npleading guilty to murder, rape, and kidnaping, he was\nsentenced to death. The Kentucky Supreme Court af-\nfirmed the sentence, and we denied certiorari. Ten years\nlater, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted\nrespondent’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus on his\nFifth Amendment claim. In so doing, it disregarded the\nlimitations of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)—a provision of law that\nsome federal judges find too confining, but that all federal\njudges must obey. We reverse.\n                             I\n  On the evening of January 25, 1997, Sarah Hansen\ndrove to a convenience store to rent a movie. When she\nfailed to return home several hours later, her family called\nthe police. Officers eventually found the vehicle Hansen\nhad been driving a short distance from the convenience\nstore. They followed a 400- to 500-foot trail of blood from\nthe van to a nearby lake, where Hansen’s unclothed, dead\nbody was found floating in the water. Hansen’s “throat\n2                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad been slashed twice with each cut approximately 3.5 to\n4 inches long,” and “[h]er windpipe was totally severed.”\nWoodall v. Commonwealth, 63 S. W. 3d 104, 114 (Ky.\n2002).\n  Authorities questioned respondent when they learned\nthat he had been in the convenience store on the night of\nthe murder. Respondent gave conflicting statements\nregarding his whereabouts that evening. Further investi-\ngation revealed that respondent’s “fingerprints were on\nthe van the victim was driving,” “[b]lood was found on\n[respondent’s] front door,” “[b]lood on his clothing and\nsweatshirt was consistent with the blood of the victim,”\nand “DNA on . . . vaginal swabs” taken from the victim\n“was consistent with” respondent’s. Ibid.\n  Faced with overwhelming evidence of his guilt, respond-\nent pleaded guilty to capital murder. He also pleaded\nguilty to capital kidnaping and first-degree rape, the\nstatutory aggravating circumstance for the murder. See\nApp. 78; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §532.025(2)(a) (West Supp.\n2012). At the ensuing penalty-phase trial, respondent\ncalled character witnesses but declined to testify himself.\nDefense counsel asked the trial judge to instruct the jury\nthat “[a] defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact\nthat the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him\nin any way.” App. 31. The trial judge denied the request,\nand the Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed that denial.\nWoodall v. Commonwealth, supra, at 115. While recog-\nnizing that the Fifth Amendment requires a no-adverse-\ninference instruction to protect a nontestifying defendant\nat the guilt phase, see Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288\n(1981), the court held that Carter and our subsequent\ncases did not require such an instruction here. Woodall v.\nCommonwealth, supra, at 115. We denied respondent’s\npetition for a writ of certiorari from that direct appeal.\nWoodall v. Kentucky, 537 U.

S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).\n   Both the Kentucky Supreme Court and the Court of\nAppeals identified as the relevant precedents in this area\nour decisions in Carter, Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454\n(1981), and Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314 (1999).\nCarter held that a no-adverse-inference instruction is\nrequired at the guilt phase. 450 U. S., at 294–295, 300.\nEstelle concerned the introduction at the penalty phase of\nthe results of an involuntary, un-Mirandized pretrial\npsychiatric examination. 451 U. S., at 456–457, and n. 1;\nid., at 461. And Mitchell disapproved a trial judge’s draw-\ning of an adverse inference from the defendant’s silence at\nsentencing “with regard to factual determinations respect-\ning the circumstances and details of the crime.” 526 U. S.,\nat 327–330.\n   It is clear that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclu-\nsion is not “contrary to” the actual holding of any of these\ncases. 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The Court of Appeals held,\nhowever, that the “Kentucky Supreme Court’s denial of\nthis constitutional claim was an unreasonable application\nof ” those cases. 685 F. 3d, at 579. In its view, “reading\nCarter, Estelle, and Mitchell together, the only reasonable\nconclusion is that” a no-adverse-inference instruction was\nrequired at the penalty phase. Ibid.2\n——————\n  2 The Court of Appeals also based its conclusion that respondent “was\n\nentitled to receive a no adverse inference instruction” on one of its own\ncases, Finney v.

For we are\nsatisfied that the issue was, at a minimum, not “beyond\nany possibility for fairminded disagreement.” Harrington,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  We have, it is true, held that the privilege against self-\nincrimination applies to the penalty phase. See Estelle,\nsupra, at 463; Mitchell, supra, at 328–329. But it is not\nuncommon for a constitutional rule to apply somewhat\ndifferently at the penalty phase than it does at the guilt\nphase. See, e.g., Bobby v. Mitts, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 4). We have “never directly held\nthat Carter applies at a sentencing phase where the Fifth\nAmendment interests of the defendant are different.”\nUnited States v. Whitten, 623 F. 3d 125, 131–132, n. 4\n(CA2 2010) (Livingston, J., dissenting from denial of re-\nhearing en banc).\n  Indeed, Mitchell itself leaves open the possibility that\nsome inferences might permissibly be drawn from a de-\nfendant’s penalty-phase silence. In that case, the District\nJudge had actually drawn from the defendant’s silence an\nadverse inference about the drug quantity attributable to\nthe defendant. See 526 U. S., at 317–319. We held that\nthis ran afoul of the defendant’s “right to remain silent at\nsentencing.” Id., at 325, 327–328 (citing Griffin v. Cali-\nfornia, 380 U. S. 609, 614 (1965)). But we framed our\nholding narrowly, in terms implying that it was limited to\ninferences pertaining to the facts of the crime: “We decline\nto adopt an exception for the sentencing phase of a crimi-\n——————\nF. 3d, at 579 (internal quotation marks omitted). That was improper.\nAs we cautioned the Sixth Circuit two Terms ago, a lower court may not\n“consul[t] its own precedents, rather than those of this Court, in as-\nsessing” a habeas claim governed by §2254. Parker v. Matthews, 567\nU. S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12).\n6                        WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnal case with regard to factual determinations respecting\nthe circumstances and details of the crime.” Mitchell, 526\nU. S., at 328 (emphasis added). “The Government re-\ntains,” we said, “the burden of proving facts relevant to the\ncrime . . . and cannot enlist the defendant in this process\nat the expense of the self-incrimination privilege.” Id., at\n330 (emphasis added). And Mitchell included an express\nreservation of direct relevance here: “Whether silence\nbears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon\nacceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward\nadjustment provided in §3E1.1 of the United States Sen-\ntencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question. It is not\nbefore us, and we express no view on it.” Ibid.3\n\n——————\n   3 The Courts of Appeals have recognized that Mitchell left this unre-\n\nsolved; their diverging approaches to the question illustrate the possi-\nbility of fairminded disagreement. Compare United States v. Caro, 597\nF. 3d 608, 629–630 (CA4 2010) (direct appeal) (noting that Mitchell\n“reserved the question of whether silence bears upon lack of remorse,”\nbut reasoning that “Estelle and Mitchell together suggest that the Fifth\nAmendment may well prohibit considering a defendant’s silence regard-\ning the nonstatutory aggravating factor of lack of remorse”), with Burr\nv. Pollard, 546 F. 3d 828, 832 (CA7 2008) (habeas) (while the right to\nremain silent persists at sentencing, “silence can be consistent not only\nwith exercising one’s constitutional right, but also with a lack of re-\nmorse,” which “is properly considered at sentencing” (citing Mitchell,\n526 U. S., at 326–327)); Lee v. Crouse, 451 F. 3d 598, 605, n. 3 (CA10\n2006) (habeas) (“[T]he circuit courts have readily confined Mitchell to\nits stated holding, and have allowed sentencing courts to rely on, or\ndraw inferences from, a defendant’s exercise of his Fifth Amendment\nrights for purposes other than determining the facts of the offense of\nconviction”).\n   Indeed, the Sixth Circuit itself has previously recognized that Mitch-\nell “explicitly limited its holding regarding inferences drawn from a\ndefendant’s silence to facts about the substantive offense and did not\naddress other inferences that may be drawn from a defendant’s si-\nlence.” United States v. Kennedy, 499 F. 3d 547, 552 (2007) (direct\nappeal). Kennedy upheld under Mitchell a sentencing judge’s consider-\nation of the defendant’s refusal to complete a court-ordered psychosex-\nual examination. 499 F. 3d, at 551–552.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    Mitchell’s reservation is relevant here for two reasons.\nFirst, if Mitchell suggests that some actual inferences\nmight be permissible at the penalty phase, it certainly\ncannot be read to require a blanket no-adverse-inference\ninstruction at every penalty-phase trial. And it was a\nblanket instruction that was requested and denied in this\ncase; respondent’s requested instruction would have in-\nformed the jury that “[a] defendant is not compelled to\ntestify and the fact that the defendant did not testify\nshould not prejudice him in any way.” App. 31 (emphasis\nadded). Counsel for respondent conceded at oral argument\nthat remorse was at issue during the penalty-phase trial,\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Respondent 18,\nyet the proposed instruction would have precluded the\njury from considering respondent’s silence as indicative of\nhis lack of remorse. Indeed, the trial judge declined to\ngive the no-adverse-inference instruction precisely because\nhe was “aware of no case law that precludes the jury from\nconsidering the defendant’s lack of expression of remorse\n. . . in sentencing.” App. 36. This alone suffices to estab-\nlish that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion was\nnot “objectively unreasonable.” Andrade, 538 U. S., at 76.\n    Second, regardless of the scope of respondent’s proposed\ninstruction, any inferences that could have been drawn\nfrom respondent’s silence would arguably fall within the\nclass of inferences as to which Mitchell leaves the door\nopen. Respondent pleaded guilty to all of the charges he\nfaced, including the applicable aggravating circumstances.\nThus, Kentucky could not have shifted to respondent its\n“burden of proving facts relevant to the crime,” 526 U. S.,\nat 330: Respondent’s own admissions had already estab-\nlished every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the\nburden of proof. There are reasonable arguments that the\nlogic of Mitchell does not apply to such cases. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Ronquillo, 508 F. 3d 744, 749 (CA5 2007)\n(“Mitchell is inapplicable to the sentencing decision in this\n8                         WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ncase because ‘the facts of the offense’ were based entirely\non Ronquillo’s admissions, not on any adverse inference\n. . . . Ronquillo, unlike the defendant in Mitchell, admitted\nall the predicate facts of his offenses”).\n    The dissent insists that Mitchell is irrelevant because it\nmerely declined to create an exception to the “normal\nrule,” supposedly established by Estelle, “that a defendant\nis entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction”\nat sentencing. Post, at 5 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That\nargument disregards perfectly reasonable interpretations\nof Estelle and Mitchell and hence contravenes §2254(d)’s\ndeferential standard of review. Estelle did not involve an\nadverse inference based on the defendant’s silence or a\ncorresponding jury instruction. See 451 U. S., at 461–469.\nThus, whatever Estelle said about the Fifth Amendment,\nits holding4—the only aspect of the decision relevant\nhere—does not “requir[e]” the categorical rule the dissent\nascribes to it. Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 76 (2006).\nLikewise, fairminded jurists could conclude that Mitchell’s\nreservation regarding remorse and acceptance of responsi-\nbility would have served no meaningful purpose if Estelle\nhad created an across-the-board rule against adverse\n——————\n   4 The dissent says Estelle “held that ‘so far as the protection of the\n\nFifth Amendment is concerned,’ it could ‘discern no basis to distinguish\nbetween the guilt and penalty phases of a defendant’s ‘capital murder\ntrial.’ ” Post, at 2 (quoting Estelle, 451 U. S., at 462–463). Of course, it\ndid not “hold” that. Rather, it held that the defendant’s Fifth Amend-\nment “rights were abridged by the State’s introduction of ” a pretrial\npsychiatric evaluation that was administered without the preliminary\nwarning required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). 451\nU. S., at 473. In any event, even Estelle’s dictum did not assume an\nentitlement to a blanket no-adverse-inference instruction. The quoted\nlanguage is reasonably read as referring to the availability of the Fifth\nAmendment privilege at sentencing rather than the precise scope of\nthat privilege when applied in the sentencing context.

In these circum-\nstances, where the “ ‘precise contours’ ” of the right remain\n“ ‘unclear,’ ” state courts enjoy “broad discretion” in their\nadjudication of a prisoner’s claims. Lockyer, 538 U. S., at\n76 (quoting Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 998\n(1991) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and in judgment)).\n                                B\n    In arguing for a contrary result, respondent leans heavily\non the notion that a state-court “ ‘determination may be\nset aside . . . if, under clearly established federal law, the\nstate court was unreasonable in refusing to extend the\ngoverning legal principle to a context in which the princi-\nple should have controlled.’ ” Brief for Respondent 21\n(quoting Ramdass v. Angelone, 530 U. S. 156, 166 (2000)\n(plurality opinion)). The Court of Appeals and District\nCourt relied on the same proposition in sustaining re-\nspondent’s Fifth Amendment claim.

See\n529 U. S., at 407–409 (citing Green v. French, 143 F. 3d\n865, 869–870 (1998)). We described the Fourth Circuit’s\ninterpretation of §2254(d)(1)’s “unreasonable application”\nclause as “generally correct,” 529 U. S., at 407, and ap-\nproved its conclusion that “a state-court decision involves\nan unreasonable application of this Court’s precedent if\nthe state court identifies the correct governing legal rule\n. . . but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particu-\nlar state prisoner’s case,” id., at 407–408 (citing Green,\nsupra, at 869–870). But we took no position on the Fourth\nCircuit’s further conclusion that a state court commits\n10                  WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAEDPA error if it “unreasonably refuse[s] to extend a legal\nprinciple to a new context where it should apply.” 529\nU. S., at 408–409 (citing Green, supra, at 869–870). We\nchose not “to decide how such ‘extension of legal principle’\ncases should be treated under §2254(d)(1)” because the\nFourth Circuit’s proposed rule for resolving them presented\nseveral “problems of precision.” 529 U. S., at 408–409.\n   Two months later, a plurality paraphrased and applied\nthe unreasonable-refusal-to-extend concept in Ramdass.\nSee 530 U. S., at 166–170. It did not, however, grant the\nhabeas petitioner relief on that basis, finding that there\nwas no unreasonable refusal to extend. Moreover, Justice\nO’Connor, whose vote was necessary to form a majority,\ncited Williams and made no mention of the unreasonable-\nrefusal-to-extend concept in her separate opinion concur-\nring in the judgment.        See 530 U. S., at 178–181.\nRamdass therefore did not alter the interpretation of\n§2254(d)(1) set forth in Williams. Aside from one opinion\ncriticizing the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend doctrine, see\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 666 (2004), we\nhave not revisited the issue since Williams and Ramdass.\nDuring that same 14-year stretch, however, we have\nrepeatedly restated our “hold[ing]” in Williams, supra, at\n409, that a state-court decision is an unreasonable appli-\ncation of our clearly established precedent if it correctly\nidentifies the governing legal rule but applies that rule\nunreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner’s case,\nsee, e.g., Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 10); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 380\n(2005); Yarborough, supra, at 663; Penry v. Johnson, 532\nU. S. 782, 792 (2001).\n   Thus, this Court has never adopted the unreasonable-\nrefusal-to-extend rule on which respondent relies. It has\nnot been so much as endorsed in a majority opinion, let\nalone relied on as a basis for granting habeas relief. To\nthe extent the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend rule differs\n                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the one embraced in Williams and reiterated many\ntimes since, we reject it. Section 2254(d)(1) provides a\nremedy for instances in which a state court unreasonably\napplies this Court’s precedent; it does not require state\ncourts to extend that precedent or license federal courts\nto treat the failure to do so as error. See Scheidegger, Ha-\nbeas Corpus, Relitigation, and the Legislative Power, 98\nColum. L. Rev. 888, 949 (1998). Thus, “if a habeas court\nmust extend a rationale before it can apply to the facts at\nhand,” then by definition the rationale was not “clearly\nestablished at the time of the state-court decision.” Yar-\nborough, 541 U. S., at 666. AEDPA’s carefully constructed\nframework “would be undermined if habeas courts intro-\nduced rules not clearly established under the guise of\nextensions to existing law.” Ibid.\n  This is not to say that §2254(d)(1) requires an “ ‘identical\nfactual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.’ ”\nPanetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 953 (2007). To the\ncontrary, state courts must reasonably apply the rules\n“squarely established” by this Court’s holdings to the facts\nof each case. Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. 111, 122\n(2009). “[T]he difference between applying a rule and\nextending it is not always clear,” but “[c]ertain principles\nare fundamental enough that when new factual permu-\ntations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule will\nbe beyond doubt.” Yarborough, supra, at 666. The crit-\nical point is that relief is available under §2254(d)(1)’s\nunreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is so obvious\nthat a clearly established rule applies to a given set of\nfacts that there could be no “fairminded disagreement” on\nthe question, Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  Perhaps the logical next step from Carter, Estelle, and\nMitchell would be to hold that the Fifth Amendment re-\nquires a penalty-phase no-adverse-inference instruction in\na case like this one; perhaps not. Either way, we have not\nyet taken that step, and there are reasonable arguments\n12                  WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non both sides—which is all Kentucky needs to prevail in\nthis AEDPA case.

The judg-\nment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

ROBERT\n\n              KEITH WOODALL \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [April 23, 2014] \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.\n  During the penalty phase of his capital murder trial,\nrespondent Robert Woodall asked the court to instruct the\njury not to draw any adverse inferences from his failure to\ntestify. The court refused, and the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt agreed that no instruction was warranted. The\nquestion before us is whether the Kentucky courts unrea-\nsonably applied clearly established Supreme Court law in\nconcluding that the Fifth Amendment did not entitle\nWoodall to a no-adverse-inference instruction. See 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d)(1). In my view, the answer is yes.\n                               I\n  This Court’s decisions in Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S.\n288 (1981), and Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454 (1981),\nclearly establish that a criminal defendant is entitled to a\nrequested no-adverse-inference instruction in the penalty\nphase of a capital trial. First consider Carter. The Court\nheld that a trial judge “has the constitutional obligation,\nupon proper request,” to give a requested no-adverse-\ninference instruction in order “to minimize the danger that\nthe jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant’s\nfailure to testify.” 450 U. S., at 305. This is because when\n“the jury is left to roam at large with only its untutored\n2                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ninstincts to guide it,” it may “draw from the defendant’s\nsilence broad inferences of guilt.” Id., at 301. A trial\ncourt’s refusal to give a requested no-adverse-inference\ninstruction thus “exacts an impermissible toll on the full\nand free exercise of the [Fifth Amendment] privilege.” Id.,\nat 305.\n   Now consider Estelle. The Court held that “so far as the\nprotection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned,”\nit could “discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt\nand penalty phases” of a defendant’s “capital murder\ntrial.” 451 U. S., at 462–463. The State had introduced at\nthe penalty phase the defendant’s compelled statements to\na psychiatrist, in order to show the defendant’s future\ndangerousness. Defending the admission of those state-\nments, the State argued that the defendant “was not\nentitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment because\n[his statements were] used only to determine punishment\nafter conviction, not to establish guilt.” Id., at 462. This\nCourt rejected the State’s argument on the ground that\nthe Fifth Amendment applies equally to the penalty phase\nand the guilt phase of a capital trial. Id., at 462–463.\n   What is unclear about the resulting law? If the Court\nholds in Case A that the First Amendment prohibits Con-\ngress from discriminating based on viewpoint, and then\nholds in Case B that the Fourteenth Amendment incorpo-\nrates the First Amendment as to the States, then it is\nclear that the First Amendment prohibits the States from\ndiscriminating based on viewpoint. By the same logic,\nbecause the Court held in Carter that the Fifth Amend-\nment requires a trial judge to give a requested no-adverse-\ninference instruction during the guilt phase of a trial, and\nheld in Estelle that there is no basis for distinguishing\nbetween the guilt and punishment phases of a capital trial\nfor purposes of the Fifth Amendment, it is clear that the\nFifth Amendment requires a judge to provide a requested\nno-adverse-inference instruction during the penalty phase\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)       3\n\n                         BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof a capital trial.\n                             II\n   The Court avoids this logic by reading Estelle too nar-\nrowly. First, it contends that Estelle’s holding that the\nFifth Amendment applies equally to the guilt and penalty\nphases was mere dictum. Ante, at 8, and n. 4. But this\nrule was essential to the resolution of the case, so it is\nbinding precedent, not dictum.\n   Second, apparently in the alternative, the majority\nacknowledges that Estelle “held that the privilege against\nself-incrimination applies to the penalty phase,” but it\nconcludes that Estelle said nothing about the content of\nthe privilege in the penalty phase. Ante, at 5 (emphasis\nadded). This interpretation of Estelle ignores its rationale.\nThe reason that Estelle concluded that the Fifth Amend-\nment applies to the penalty phase of a capital trial is that\nthe Court saw “no basis to distinguish between the guilt\nand penalty phases of [a defendant’s] capital murder trial\nso far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege\nis concerned.” 451 U. S., at 462–463. And as there is no\nbasis to distinguish between the two contexts for Fifth\nAmendment purposes, there is no basis for varying either\nthe application or the content of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege in the two contexts.\n   The majority also reads our decision in Mitchell v. United\nStates, 526 U. S. 314 (1999), to change the legal land-\nscape where it expressly declined to do so. In Mitchell, the\nCourt considered whether to create an exception to the\n“normal rule in a criminal case . . . that no negative infer-\nence from the defendant’s failure to testify is permitted.”\nId., at 328. We refused: “We decline to adopt an exception\nfor the sentencing phase of a criminal case with regard to\nfactual determinations respecting the circumstances and\ndetails of the crime.” Ibid. Mitchell thus reiterated what\nCarter and Estelle had already established. The “normal\n4                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrule” is that Fifth Amendment protections apply during\ntrial and sentencing. Because the Court refused “to adopt\nan exception” to this default rule, ibid. (emphasis added),\nthe law before and after Mitchell remained the same.\n   The majority seizes upon the limited nature of Mitchell’s\nholding, concluding that by refusing to adopt an exception\nto the normal rule for certain “factual determinations,”\nMitchell suggested that inferences about other matters\nmight be permissible at the penalty phase. Ante, at 5–7.\nThe majority seems to believe that Mitchell somehow casts\ndoubt upon whether Estelle’s Fifth Amendment rule ap-\nplies to matters unrelated to the “circumstances and\ndetails of the crime,” such as remorse, or as to which the\nState does not bear the burden of proof.\n   As an initial matter, Mitchell would have had to over-\nrule—or at least substantially limit—Estelle to create an\nexception for matters unrelated to the circumstances and\ndetails of the crime or for matters on which the defendant\nbears the burden of proof. Sentencing proceedings, partic-\nularly capital sentencing proceedings, often focus on fac-\ntual matters that do not directly concern facts of the\ncrime. Was the defendant subject to flagrant abuse in his\ngrowing-up years? Is he suffering from a severe physical\nor mental impairment? Was he supportive of his family?\nIs he remorseful? Estelle itself involved compelled state-\nments introduced to establish the defendant’s future\ndangerousness—another fact often unrelated to the cir-\ncumstances or details of a defendant’s crime. 451 U. S., at\n456. In addition, States typically place the burden to\nprove mitigating factors at the penalty phase on the de-\nfendant. A reasonable jurist would not believe that Mitch-\nell, by refusing to create an exception to Estelle, intended\nto undermine the very case it reaffirmed.\n   Mitchell held, simply and only, that the normal rule of\nEstelle applied in the circumstances of the particular case\nbefore the Court. That holding does not destabilize settled\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlaw beyond its reach. We frequently resist reaching be-\nyond the facts of a case before us, and we often say so.\nThat does not mean that we throw cases involving all\nother factual circumstances into a shadow-land of legal\ndoubt.\n   The majority also places undue weight on dictum in\nMitchell reserving judgment as to whether to create addi-\ntional exceptions to the normal rule of Estelle and Carter.\nWe noted: “Whether silence bears upon the determination\nof a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility\nfor purposes of the downward adjustment provided in\n§3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998),\nis a separate question. It is not before us, and we express\nno view on it.” 526 U. S., at 330. This dictum, says the\nmajority, suggests that some inferences, including about\nremorse (which was at issue in Woodall’s case), may be\npermissible. Ante, at 5–7.\n   When the Court merely reserves a question that is “not\nbefore us” for a future case, we do not cast doubt on legal\nprinciples that are already clearly established. The Court\noften identifies questions that it is not answering in order\nto clarify the question it is answering. In so doing—that\nis, in “express[ing] no view” on questions that are not\nsquarely before us—we do not create a state of uncertainty\nas to those questions. And in respect to Mitchell, where\nthe Court reserved the question whether to create an\nexception to the normal rule, this is doubly true. The\nnormal rule that a defendant is entitled to a requested no-\nadverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase as well\nas the guilt phase remained clearly established after\nMitchell.\n                           III\n  In holding that the Kentucky courts did not unreasona-\nbly apply clearly established law, the majority declares\nthat if a court must “extend” the rationale of a case in\n6                    WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\norder to apply it, the rationale is not clearly established.\nAnte, at 9–11. I read this to mean simply that if there\nmay be “fairminded disagreement” about whether a ra-\ntionale applies to a certain set of facts, a state court will\nnot unreasonably apply the law by failing to apply that\nrationale, and I agree. See Harrington v. Richter, 562\nU. S. ___ (2011). I do not understand the majority to\nsuggest that reading two legal principles together would\nnecessarily “extend” the law, which would be a proposition\nentirely inconsistent with our case law. As long as fair-\nminded jurists would conclude that two (or more) legal\nrules considered together would dictate a particular out-\ncome, a state court unreasonably applies the law when it\nholds otherwise. Ibid.\n   That is the error the Kentucky Supreme Court commit-\nted here. Failing to consider together the legal principles\nestablished by Carter and Estelle, the state court confined\nthose cases to their facts. It held that Carter did not apply\nbecause Woodall had already pleaded guilty—that is,\nbecause Woodall requested a no-adverse-inference instruc-\ntion at the penalty phase rather than the guilt phase of his\ntrial. Woodall v. Commonwealth, 63 S. W. 3d 104, 115\n(Ky. 2001). And it concluded that Estelle did not apply\nbecause Estelle was not a “jury instruction case.” 63 S. W.\n3d, at 115. The Kentucky Supreme Court unreasonably\nfailed to recognize that together Carter and Estelle compel\na requested no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty\nphase of a capital trial. And reading Mitchell to rein in\nthe law in contemplation of never-before-recognized excep-\ntions to this normal rule would be an unreasonable retrac-\ntion of clearly established law, not a proper failure to\n“extend” it. Because the Sixth Circuit correctly applied\nclearly established law in granting Woodall’s habeas\npetition, I would affirm.\n   With respect I dissent from the Court’s contrary\nconclusion.\n</pre>", "id": 2670965, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/04/23/white_v._woodall.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued December 11, 2013—Decided April 23, 2014\nRespondent pleaded guilty to capital murder, capital kidnaping, and\n  first-degree rape, the statutory aggravating circumstance for the\n  murder. He was sentenced to death after the trial court denied de-\n  fense counsel’s request to instruct the jury not to draw any adverse\n  inference from respondent’s decision not to testify at the penalty\n  phase. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed, finding that the Fifth\n  Amendment’s requirement of a no-adverse-inference instruction to\n  protect a nontestifying defendant at the guilt phase, see Carter v.\n  Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, is not required at the penalty phase. Subse-\n  quently, the Federal District Court granted respondent habeas relief,\n  holding that the trial court’s refusal to give the requested instruction\n  violated respondent’s privilege against self-incrimination. The Sixth\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the Kentucky Supreme Court’s rejection of respondent’s\n Fifth Amendment claim was not objectively unreasonable, the Sixth\n Circuit erred in granting the writ. Pp. 3–12.\n    (a) The difficult-to-meet standard of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) permits a\n court to grant federal habeas relief on a claim already “adjudicated\n on the merits in State court” only if that adjudication “resulted in a\n decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica-\n tion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this]\n Court.” “ ‘[C]learly established Federal law’ ” includes only “ ‘the\n holdings” of the Court’s decisions,’ ” Howes v. Fields, 565 U. S. ___,\n ___; and an “unreasonable application of ” those holdings must be\n “ ‘objectively unreasonable,’ ” Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 75–\n 76. The state-court ruling must rest on “an error well understood\n and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fair-\n minded disagreement.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___.\n2                          WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n      Here, the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion was not “contrary\n    to” the Court’s holdings in Carter, supra, which required a no-\n    adverse-inference instruction at the guilt phase; in Estelle v. Smith,\n    451 U. S. 454, which concerned the introduction at the penalty phase\n    of the results of an involuntary, un-Mirandized pretrial psychiatric\n    examination; or in Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314, 327–330,\n    which disapproved a trial judge’s drawing of an adverse inference\n    from the defendant’s silence at sentencing “with regard to factual de-\n    terminations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.”\n    Nor was the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion an unreasonable\n    application of the holdings in those cases. This Court need not decide\n    whether a no-adverse-inference instruction is required in these cir-\n    cumstances, for the issue before the Kentucky Supreme Court was, at\n    a minimum, not “beyond any possibility for fairminded disagree-\n    ment,” Harrington, supra, at ___. Mitchell in particular leaves open\n    the possibility that some inferences might permissibly be drawn from\n    a defendant’s penalty-phase silence. Thus, it cannot be read to re-\n    quire the type of blanket no-adverse-inference instruction requested\n    and denied here. Moreover, because respondent’s own admissions of\n    guilt had established every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the\n    burden of proof, Mitchell’s narrow holding, which implied that it was\n    limited to inferences pertaining to the facts of the crime, does not ap-\n    ply.

ROBERT\n\n              KEITH WOODALL \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 23, 2014] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Respondent brutally raped, slashed with a box cutter,\nand drowned a 16-year-old high-school student. After\npleading guilty to murder, rape, and kidnaping, he was\nsentenced to death. The Kentucky Supreme Court af-\nfirmed the sentence, and we denied certiorari. Ten years\nlater, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted\nrespondent’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus on his\nFifth Amendment claim. In so doing, it disregarded the\nlimitations of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)—a provision of law that\nsome federal judges find too confining, but that all federal\njudges must obey. We reverse.\n                             I\n  On the evening of January 25, 1997, Sarah Hansen\ndrove to a convenience store to rent a movie. When she\nfailed to return home several hours later, her family called\nthe police. Officers eventually found the vehicle Hansen\nhad been driving a short distance from the convenience\nstore. They followed a 400- to 500-foot trail of blood from\nthe van to a nearby lake, where Hansen’s unclothed, dead\nbody was found floating in the water. Hansen’s “throat\n2                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad been slashed twice with each cut approximately 3.5 to\n4 inches long,” and “[h]er windpipe was totally severed.”\nWoodall v. Commonwealth, 63 S. W. 3d 104, 114 (Ky.\n2002).\n  Authorities questioned respondent when they learned\nthat he had been in the convenience store on the night of\nthe murder. Respondent gave conflicting statements\nregarding his whereabouts that evening. Further investi-\ngation revealed that respondent’s “fingerprints were on\nthe van the victim was driving,” “[b]lood was found on\n[respondent’s] front door,” “[b]lood on his clothing and\nsweatshirt was consistent with the blood of the victim,”\nand “DNA on . . . vaginal swabs” taken from the victim\n“was consistent with” respondent’s. Ibid.\n  Faced with overwhelming evidence of his guilt, respond-\nent pleaded guilty to capital murder. He also pleaded\nguilty to capital kidnaping and first-degree rape, the\nstatutory aggravating circumstance for the murder. See\nApp. 78; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §532.025(2)(a) (West Supp.\n2012). At the ensuing penalty-phase trial, respondent\ncalled character witnesses but declined to testify himself.\nDefense counsel asked the trial judge to instruct the jury\nthat “[a] defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact\nthat the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him\nin any way.” App. 31. The trial judge denied the request,\nand the Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed that denial.\nWoodall v. Commonwealth, supra, at 115. While recog-\nnizing that the Fifth Amendment requires a no-adverse-\ninference instruction to protect a nontestifying defendant\nat the guilt phase, see Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288\n(1981), the court held that Carter and our subsequent\ncases did not require such an instruction here. Woodall v.\nCommonwealth, supra, at 115. We denied respondent’s\npetition for a writ of certiorari from that direct appeal.\nWoodall v. Kentucky, 537 U. S. 835 (2002).\n  In 2006, respondent filed this petition for habeas corpus\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).\n   Both the Kentucky Supreme Court and the Court of\nAppeals identified as the relevant precedents in this area\nour decisions in Carter, Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454\n(1981), and Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314 (1999).\nCarter held that a no-adverse-inference instruction is\nrequired at the guilt phase. 450 U. S., at 294–295, 300.\nEstelle concerned the introduction at the penalty phase of\nthe results of an involuntary, un-Mirandized pretrial\npsychiatric examination. 451 U. S., at 456–457, and n. 1;\nid., at 461. And Mitchell disapproved a trial judge’s draw-\ning of an adverse inference from the defendant’s silence at\nsentencing “with regard to factual determinations respect-\ning the circumstances and details of the crime.” 526 U. S.,\nat 327–330.\n   It is clear that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclu-\nsion is not “contrary to” the actual holding of any of these\ncases. 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The Court of Appeals held,\nhowever, that the “Kentucky Supreme Court’s denial of\nthis constitutional claim was an unreasonable application\nof ” those cases. 685 F. 3d, at 579. In its view, “reading\nCarter, Estelle, and Mitchell together, the only reasonable\nconclusion is that” a no-adverse-inference instruction was\nrequired at the penalty phase. Ibid.2\n——————\n  2 The Court of Appeals also based its conclusion that respondent “was\n\nentitled to receive a no adverse inference instruction” on one of its own\ncases, Finney v. Rothgerber, 751 F. 2d 858, 863–864 (CA6 1985). 685\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

For we are\nsatisfied that the issue was, at a minimum, not “beyond\nany possibility for fairminded disagreement.” Harrington,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  We have, it is true, held that the privilege against self-\nincrimination applies to the penalty phase. See Estelle,\nsupra, at 463; Mitchell, supra, at 328–329. But it is not\nuncommon for a constitutional rule to apply somewhat\ndifferently at the penalty phase than it does at the guilt\nphase. See, e.g., Bobby v. Mitts, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 4). We have “never directly held\nthat Carter applies at a sentencing phase where the Fifth\nAmendment interests of the defendant are different.”\nUnited States v. Whitten, 623 F. 3d 125, 131–132, n. 4\n(CA2 2010) (Livingston, J., dissenting from denial of re-\nhearing en banc).\n  Indeed, Mitchell itself leaves open the possibility that\nsome inferences might permissibly be drawn from a de-\nfendant’s penalty-phase silence. In that case, the District\nJudge had actually drawn from the defendant’s silence an\nadverse inference about the drug quantity attributable to\nthe defendant. See 526 U. S., at 317–319. We held that\nthis ran afoul of the defendant’s “right to remain silent at\nsentencing.” Id., at 325, 327–328 (citing Griffin v. Cali-\nfornia, 380 U. S. 609, 614 (1965)). But we framed our\nholding narrowly, in terms implying that it was limited to\ninferences pertaining to the facts of the crime: “We decline\nto adopt an exception for the sentencing phase of a crimi-\n——————\nF. 3d, at 579 (internal quotation marks omitted). That was improper.\nAs we cautioned the Sixth Circuit two Terms ago, a lower court may not\n“consul[t] its own precedents, rather than those of this Court, in as-\nsessing” a habeas claim governed by §2254. Parker v. Matthews, 567\nU. S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12).\n6                        WHITE v.

S., at 328 (emphasis added). “The Government re-\ntains,” we said, “the burden of proving facts relevant to the\ncrime . . . and cannot enlist the defendant in this process\nat the expense of the self-incrimination privilege.” Id., at\n330 (emphasis added). And Mitchell included an express\nreservation of direct relevance here: “Whether silence\nbears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon\nacceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward\nadjustment provided in §3E1.1 of the United States Sen-\ntencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question. It is not\nbefore us, and we express no view on it.” Ibid.3\n\n——————\n   3 The Courts of Appeals have recognized that Mitchell left this unre-\n\nsolved; their diverging approaches to the question illustrate the possi-\nbility of fairminded disagreement. Compare United States v. Caro, 597\nF. 3d 608, 629–630 (CA4 2010) (direct appeal) (noting that Mitchell\n“reserved the question of whether silence bears upon lack of remorse,”\nbut reasoning that “Estelle and Mitchell together suggest that the Fifth\nAmendment may well prohibit considering a defendant’s silence regard-\ning the nonstatutory aggravating factor of lack of remorse”), with Burr\nv. Pollard, 546 F. 3d 828, 832 (CA7 2008) (habeas) (while the right to\nremain silent persists at sentencing, “silence can be consistent not only\nwith exercising one’s constitutional right, but also with a lack of re-\nmorse,” which “is properly considered at sentencing” (citing Mitchell,\n526 U. S., at 326–327)); Lee v. Crouse, 451 F. 3d 598, 605, n. 3 (CA10\n2006) (habeas) (“[T]he circuit courts have readily confined Mitchell to\nits stated holding, and have allowed sentencing courts to rely on, or\ndraw inferences from, a defendant’s exercise of his Fifth Amendment\nrights for purposes other than determining the facts of the offense of\nconviction”).\n   Indeed, the Sixth Circuit itself has previously recognized that Mitch-\nell “explicitly limited its holding regarding inferences drawn from a\ndefendant’s silence to facts about the substantive offense and did not\naddress other inferences that may be drawn from a defendant’s si-\nlence.” United States v. Kennedy, 499 F. 3d 547, 552 (2007) (direct\nappeal). Kennedy upheld under Mitchell a sentencing judge’s consider-\nation of the defendant’s refusal to complete a court-ordered psychosex-\nual examination. 499 F. 3d, at 551–552.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    Mitchell’s reservation is relevant here for two reasons.\nFirst, if Mitchell suggests that some actual inferences\nmight be permissible at the penalty phase, it certainly\ncannot be read to require a blanket no-adverse-inference\ninstruction at every penalty-phase trial. And it was a\nblanket instruction that was requested and denied in this\ncase; respondent’s requested instruction would have in-\nformed the jury that “[a] defendant is not compelled to\ntestify and the fact that the defendant did not testify\nshould not prejudice him in any way.” App. 31 (emphasis\nadded). Counsel for respondent conceded at oral argument\nthat remorse was at issue during the penalty-phase trial,\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Respondent 18,\nyet the proposed instruction would have precluded the\njury from considering respondent’s silence as indicative of\nhis lack of remorse. Indeed, the trial judge declined to\ngive the no-adverse-inference instruction precisely because\nhe was “aware of no case law that precludes the jury from\nconsidering the defendant’s lack of expression of remorse\n. . . in sentencing.” App. 36. This alone suffices to estab-\nlish that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion was\nnot “objectively unreasonable.” Andrade, 538 U. S., at 76.\n    Second, regardless of the scope of respondent’s proposed\ninstruction, any inferences that could have been drawn\nfrom respondent’s silence would arguably fall within the\nclass of inferences as to which Mitchell leaves the door\nopen. Respondent pleaded guilty to all of the charges he\nfaced, including the applicable aggravating circumstances.\nThus, Kentucky could not have shifted to respondent its\n“burden of proving facts relevant to the crime,” 526 U. S.,\nat 330: Respondent’s own admissions had already estab-\nlished every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the\nburden of proof. There are reasonable arguments that the\nlogic of Mitchell does not apply to such cases. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Ronquillo, 508 F. 3d 744, 749 (CA5 2007)\n(“Mitchell is inapplicable to the sentencing decision in this\n8                         WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ncase because ‘the facts of the offense’ were based entirely\non Ronquillo’s admissions, not on any adverse inference\n. . . . Ronquillo, unlike the defendant in Mitchell, admitted\nall the predicate facts of his offenses”).\n    The dissent insists that Mitchell is irrelevant because it\nmerely declined to create an exception to the “normal\nrule,” supposedly established by Estelle, “that a defendant\nis entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction”\nat sentencing. Post, at 5 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That\nargument disregards perfectly reasonable interpretations\nof Estelle and Mitchell and hence contravenes §2254(d)’s\ndeferential standard of review. Estelle did not involve an\nadverse inference based on the defendant’s silence or a\ncorresponding jury instruction. See 451 U. S., at 461–469.\nThus, whatever Estelle said about the Fifth Amendment,\nits holding4—the only aspect of the decision relevant\nhere—does not “requir[e]” the categorical rule the dissent\nascribes to it. Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 76 (2006).\nLikewise, fairminded jurists could conclude that Mitchell’s\nreservation regarding remorse and acceptance of responsi-\nbility would have served no meaningful purpose if Estelle\nhad created an across-the-board rule against adverse\n——————\n   4 The dissent says Estelle “held that ‘so far as the protection of the\n\nFifth Amendment is concerned,’ it could ‘discern no basis to distinguish\nbetween the guilt and penalty phases of a defendant’s ‘capital murder\ntrial.’ ” Post, at 2 (quoting Estelle, 451 U. S., at 462–463). Of course, it\ndid not “hold” that. Rather, it held that the defendant’s Fifth Amend-\nment “rights were abridged by the State’s introduction of ” a pretrial\npsychiatric evaluation that was administered without the preliminary\nwarning required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). 451\nU. S., at 473. In any event, even Estelle’s dictum did not assume an\nentitlement to a blanket no-adverse-inference instruction. The quoted\nlanguage is reasonably read as referring to the availability of the Fifth\nAmendment privilege at sentencing rather than the precise scope of\nthat privilege when applied in the sentencing context. Indeed, it\nappears in a passage responding to the State’s argument that the\ndefendant “was not entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment”\nin the first place.

S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninferences; we are, after all, hardly in the habit of reserv-\ning “separate question[s],” Mitchell, supra, at 330, that\nhave already been definitively answered. In these circum-\nstances, where the “ ‘precise contours’ ” of the right remain\n“ ‘unclear,’ ” state courts enjoy “broad discretion” in their\nadjudication of a prisoner’s claims. Lockyer, 538 U. S., at\n76 (quoting Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 998\n(1991) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and in judgment)).\n                                B\n    In arguing for a contrary result, respondent leans heavily\non the notion that a state-court “ ‘determination may be\nset aside . . . if, under clearly established federal law, the\nstate court was unreasonable in refusing to extend the\ngoverning legal principle to a context in which the princi-\nple should have controlled.’ ” Brief for Respondent 21\n(quoting Ramdass v. Angelone, 530 U. S. 156, 166 (2000)\n(plurality opinion)). The Court of Appeals and District\nCourt relied on the same proposition in sustaining re-\nspondent’s Fifth Amendment claim. See 685 F. 3d, at 579;\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 37a–39a, 2009 WL 464939, *4.\n     The unreasonable-refusal-to-extend concept originated\nin a Fourth Circuit opinion we discussed at length in\nWilliams, our first in-depth analysis of the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). See\n529 U. S., at 407–409 (citing Green v. French, 143 F. 3d\n865, 869–870 (1998)). We described the Fourth Circuit’s\ninterpretation of §2254(d)(1)’s “unreasonable application”\nclause as “generally correct,” 529 U. S., at 407, and ap-\nproved its conclusion that “a state-court decision involves\nan unreasonable application of this Court’s precedent if\nthe state court identifies the correct governing legal rule\n. . . but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particu-\nlar state prisoner’s case,” id., at 407–408 (citing Green,\nsupra, at 869–870). But we took no position on the Fourth\nCircuit’s further conclusion that a state court commits\n10                  WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAEDPA error if it “unreasonably refuse[s] to extend a legal\nprinciple to a new context where it should apply.” 529\nU. S., at 408–409 (citing Green, supra, at 869–870). We\nchose not “to decide how such ‘extension of legal principle’\ncases should be treated under §2254(d)(1)” because the\nFourth Circuit’s proposed rule for resolving them presented\nseveral “problems of precision.” 529 U. S., at 408–409.\n   Two months later, a plurality paraphrased and applied\nthe unreasonable-refusal-to-extend concept in Ramdass.\nSee 530 U. S., at 166–170. It did not, however, grant the\nhabeas petitioner relief on that basis, finding that there\nwas no unreasonable refusal to extend. Moreover, Justice\nO’Connor, whose vote was necessary to form a majority,\ncited Williams and made no mention of the unreasonable-\nrefusal-to-extend concept in her separate opinion concur-\nring in the judgment.        See 530 U. S., at 178–181.\nRamdass therefore did not alter the interpretation of\n§2254(d)(1) set forth in Williams. Aside from one opinion\ncriticizing the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend doctrine, see\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 666 (2004), we\nhave not revisited the issue since Williams and Ramdass.\nDuring that same 14-year stretch, however, we have\nrepeatedly restated our “hold[ing]” in Williams, supra, at\n409, that a state-court decision is an unreasonable appli-\ncation of our clearly established precedent if it correctly\nidentifies the governing legal rule but applies that rule\nunreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner’s case,\nsee, e.g., Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 10); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 380\n(2005); Yarborough, supra, at 663; Penry v. Johnson, 532\nU. S. 782, 792 (2001).\n   Thus, this Court has never adopted the unreasonable-\nrefusal-to-extend rule on which respondent relies. It has\nnot been so much as endorsed in a majority opinion, let\nalone relied on as a basis for granting habeas relief. To\nthe extent the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend rule differs\n                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the one embraced in Williams and reiterated many\ntimes since, we reject it. Section 2254(d)(1) provides a\nremedy for instances in which a state court unreasonably\napplies this Court’s precedent; it does not require state\ncourts to extend that precedent or license federal courts\nto treat the failure to do so as error. See Scheidegger, Ha-\nbeas Corpus, Relitigation, and the Legislative Power, 98\nColum. L. Rev. 888, 949 (1998). Thus, “if a habeas court\nmust extend a rationale before it can apply to the facts at\nhand,” then by definition the rationale was not “clearly\nestablished at the time of the state-court decision.” Yar-\nborough, 541 U. S., at 666. AEDPA’s carefully constructed\nframework “would be undermined if habeas courts intro-\nduced rules not clearly established under the guise of\nextensions to existing law.” Ibid.\n  This is not to say that §2254(d)(1) requires an “ ‘identical\nfactual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.’ ”\nPanetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 953 (2007). To the\ncontrary, state courts must reasonably apply the rules\n“squarely established” by this Court’s holdings to the facts\nof each case. Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. 111, 122\n(2009). “[T]he difference between applying a rule and\nextending it is not always clear,” but “[c]ertain principles\nare fundamental enough that when new factual permu-\ntations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule will\nbe beyond doubt.” Yarborough, supra, at 666. The crit-\nical point is that relief is available under §2254(d)(1)’s\nunreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is so obvious\nthat a clearly established rule applies to a given set of\nfacts that there could be no “fairminded disagreement” on\nthe question, Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  Perhaps the logical next step from Carter, Estelle, and\nMitchell would be to hold that the Fifth Amendment re-\nquires a penalty-phase no-adverse-inference instruction in\na case like this one; perhaps not.

ROBERT\n\n              KEITH WOODALL \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [April 23, 2014] \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.\n  During the penalty phase of his capital murder trial,\nrespondent Robert Woodall asked the court to instruct the\njury not to draw any adverse inferences from his failure to\ntestify. The court refused, and the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt agreed that no instruction was warranted. The\nquestion before us is whether the Kentucky courts unrea-\nsonably applied clearly established Supreme Court law in\nconcluding that the Fifth Amendment did not entitle\nWoodall to a no-adverse-inference instruction. See 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d)(1). In my view, the answer is yes.\n                               I\n  This Court’s decisions in Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S.\n288 (1981), and Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454 (1981),\nclearly establish that a criminal defendant is entitled to a\nrequested no-adverse-inference instruction in the penalty\nphase of a capital trial. First consider Carter. The Court\nheld that a trial judge “has the constitutional obligation,\nupon proper request,” to give a requested no-adverse-\ninference instruction in order “to minimize the danger that\nthe jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant’s\nfailure to testify.” 450 U. S., at 305. This is because when\n“the jury is left to roam at large with only its untutored\n2                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ninstincts to guide it,” it may “draw from the defendant’s\nsilence broad inferences of guilt.” Id., at 301. A trial\ncourt’s refusal to give a requested no-adverse-inference\ninstruction thus “exacts an impermissible toll on the full\nand free exercise of the [Fifth Amendment] privilege.” Id.,\nat 305.\n   Now consider Estelle. The Court held that “so far as the\nprotection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned,”\nit could “discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt\nand penalty phases” of a defendant’s “capital murder\ntrial.” 451 U. S., at 462–463. The State had introduced at\nthe penalty phase the defendant’s compelled statements to\na psychiatrist, in order to show the defendant’s future\ndangerousness. Defending the admission of those state-\nments, the State argued that the defendant “was not\nentitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment because\n[his statements were] used only to determine punishment\nafter conviction, not to establish guilt.” Id., at 462. This\nCourt rejected the State’s argument on the ground that\nthe Fifth Amendment applies equally to the penalty phase\nand the guilt phase of a capital trial. Id., at 462–463.\n   What is unclear about the resulting law? If the Court\nholds in Case A that the First Amendment prohibits Con-\ngress from discriminating based on viewpoint, and then\nholds in Case B that the Fourteenth Amendment incorpo-\nrates the First Amendment as to the States, then it is\nclear that the First Amendment prohibits the States from\ndiscriminating based on viewpoint. By the same logic,\nbecause the Court held in Carter that the Fifth Amend-\nment requires a trial judge to give a requested no-adverse-\ninference instruction during the guilt phase of a trial, and\nheld in Estelle that there is no basis for distinguishing\nbetween the guilt and punishment phases of a capital trial\nfor purposes of the Fifth Amendment, it is clear that the\nFifth Amendment requires a judge to provide a requested\nno-adverse-inference instruction during the penalty phase\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)       3\n\n                         BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof a capital trial.\n                             II\n   The Court avoids this logic by reading Estelle too nar-\nrowly. First, it contends that Estelle’s holding that the\nFifth Amendment applies equally to the guilt and penalty\nphases was mere dictum. Ante, at 8, and n. 4. But this\nrule was essential to the resolution of the case, so it is\nbinding precedent, not dictum.\n   Second, apparently in the alternative, the majority\nacknowledges that Estelle “held that the privilege against\nself-incrimination applies to the penalty phase,” but it\nconcludes that Estelle said nothing about the content of\nthe privilege in the penalty phase. Ante, at 5 (emphasis\nadded). This interpretation of Estelle ignores its rationale.\nThe reason that Estelle concluded that the Fifth Amend-\nment applies to the penalty phase of a capital trial is that\nthe Court saw “no basis to distinguish between the guilt\nand penalty phases of [a defendant’s] capital murder trial\nso far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege\nis concerned.” 451 U. S., at 462–463. And as there is no\nbasis to distinguish between the two contexts for Fifth\nAmendment purposes, there is no basis for varying either\nthe application or the content of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege in the two contexts.\n   The majority also reads our decision in Mitchell v. United\nStates, 526 U. S. 314 (1999), to change the legal land-\nscape where it expressly declined to do so. In Mitchell, the\nCourt considered whether to create an exception to the\n“normal rule in a criminal case . . . that no negative infer-\nence from the defendant’s failure to testify is permitted.”\nId., at 328. We refused: “We decline to adopt an exception\nfor the sentencing phase of a criminal case with regard to\nfactual determinations respecting the circumstances and\ndetails of the crime.” Ibid. Mitchell thus reiterated what\nCarter and Estelle had already established. The “normal\n4                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrule” is that Fifth Amendment protections apply during\ntrial and sentencing. Because the Court refused “to adopt\nan exception” to this default rule, ibid. (emphasis added),\nthe law before and after Mitchell remained the same.\n   The majority seizes upon the limited nature of Mitchell’s\nholding, concluding that by refusing to adopt an exception\nto the normal rule for certain “factual determinations,”\nMitchell suggested that inferences about other matters\nmight be permissible at the penalty phase. Ante, at 5–7.\nThe majority seems to believe that Mitchell somehow casts\ndoubt upon whether Estelle’s Fifth Amendment rule ap-\nplies to matters unrelated to the “circumstances and\ndetails of the crime,” such as remorse, or as to which the\nState does not bear the burden of proof.\n   As an initial matter, Mitchell would have had to over-\nrule—or at least substantially limit—Estelle to create an\nexception for matters unrelated to the circumstances and\ndetails of the crime or for matters on which the defendant\nbears the burden of proof. Sentencing proceedings, partic-\nularly capital sentencing proceedings, often focus on fac-\ntual matters that do not directly concern facts of the\ncrime. Was the defendant subject to flagrant abuse in his\ngrowing-up years? Is he suffering from a severe physical\nor mental impairment? Was he supportive of his family?\nIs he remorseful? Estelle itself involved compelled state-\nments introduced to establish the defendant’s future\ndangerousness—another fact often unrelated to the cir-\ncumstances or details of a defendant’s crime. 451 U. S., at\n456. In addition, States typically place the burden to\nprove mitigating factors at the penalty phase on the de-\nfendant. A reasonable jurist would not believe that Mitch-\nell, by refusing to create an exception to Estelle, intended\nto undermine the very case it reaffirmed.\n   Mitchell held, simply and only, that the normal rule of\nEstelle applied in the circumstances of the particular case\nbefore the Court. That holding does not destabilize settled\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlaw beyond its reach. We frequently resist reaching be-\nyond the facts of a case before us, and we often say so.\nThat does not mean that we throw cases involving all\nother factual circumstances into a shadow-land of legal\ndoubt.\n   The majority also places undue weight on dictum in\nMitchell reserving judgment as to whether to create addi-\ntional exceptions to the normal rule of Estelle and Carter.\nWe noted: “Whether silence bears upon the determination\nof a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility\nfor purposes of the downward adjustment provided in\n§3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998),\nis a separate question. It is not before us, and we express\nno view on it.” 526 U. S., at 330. This dictum, says the\nmajority, suggests that some inferences, including about\nremorse (which was at issue in Woodall’s case), may be\npermissible. Ante, at 5–7.\n   When the Court merely reserves a question that is “not\nbefore us” for a future case, we do not cast doubt on legal\nprinciples that are already clearly established. The Court\noften identifies questions that it is not answering in order\nto clarify the question it is answering. In so doing—that\nis, in “express[ing] no view” on questions that are not\nsquarely before us—we do not create a state of uncertainty\nas to those questions. And in respect to Mitchell, where\nthe Court reserved the question whether to create an\nexception to the normal rule, this is doubly true. The\nnormal rule that a defendant is entitled to a requested no-\nadverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase as well\nas the guilt phase remained clearly established after\nMitchell.\n                           III\n  In holding that the Kentucky courts did not unreasona-\nbly apply clearly established law, the majority declares\nthat if a court must “extend” the rationale of a case in\n6                    WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\norder to apply it, the rationale is not clearly established.\nAnte, at 9–11. I read this to mean simply that if there\nmay be “fairminded disagreement” about whether a ra-\ntionale applies to a certain set of facts, a state court will\nnot unreasonably apply the law by failing to apply that\nrationale, and I agree. See Harrington v. Richter, 562\nU. S. ___ (2011). I do not understand the majority to\nsuggest that reading two legal principles together would\nnecessarily “extend” the law, which would be a proposition\nentirely inconsistent with our case law. As long as fair-\nminded jurists would conclude that two (or more) legal\nrules considered together would dictate a particular out-\ncome, a state court unreasonably applies the law when it\nholds otherwise. Ibid.\n   That is the error the Kentucky Supreme Court commit-\nted here. Failing to consider together the legal principles\nestablished by Carter and Estelle, the state court confined\nthose cases to their facts. It held that Carter did not apply\nbecause Woodall had already pleaded guilty—that is,\nbecause Woodall requested a no-adverse-inference instruc-\ntion at the penalty phase rather than the guilt phase of his\ntrial. Woodall v. Commonwealth, 63 S. W. 3d 104, 115\n(Ky. 2001). And it concluded that Estelle did not apply\nbecause Estelle was not a “jury instruction case.” 63 S. W.\n3d, at 115. The Kentucky Supreme Court unreasonably\nfailed to recognize that together Carter and Estelle compel\na requested no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty\nphase of a capital trial. And reading Mitchell to rein in\nthe law in contemplation of never-before-recognized excep-\ntions to this normal rule would be an unreasonable retrac-\ntion of clearly established law, not a proper failure to\n“extend” it. Because the Sixth Circuit correctly applied\nclearly established law in granting Woodall’s habeas\npetition, I would affirm.\n   With respect I dissent from the Court’s contrary\nconclusion.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2670965/", "sha1": "ecc70b79835a4d1aa132156f5dc628abeba06c2d", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-037", "time_retrieved": "2014-04-23T07:31:27.419449"}
