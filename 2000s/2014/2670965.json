WOODALL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12\u2013794.      Argued December 11, 2013\u2014Decided April 23, 2014\nRespondent pleaded guilty to capital murder, capital kidnaping, and\n  first-degree rape, the statutory aggravating circumstance for the\n  murder. He was sentenced to death after the trial court denied de-\n  fense counsel\u2019s request to instruct the jury not to draw any adverse\n  inference from respondent\u2019s decision not to testify at the penalty\n  phase. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed, finding that the Fifth\n  Amendment\u2019s requirement of a no-adverse-inference instruction to\n  protect a nontestifying defendant at the guilt phase, see Carter v.\n  Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, is not required at the penalty phase. Subse-\n  quently, the Federal District Court granted respondent habeas relief,\n  holding that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction\n  violated respondent\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. The Sixth\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of respondent\u2019s\n Fifth Amendment claim was not objectively unreasonable, the Sixth\n Circuit erred in granting the writ. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) The difficult-to-meet standard of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d) permits a\n court to grant federal habeas relief on a claim already \u201cadjudicated\n on the merits in State court\u201d only if that adjudication \u201cresulted in a\n decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica-\n tion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this]\n Court.\u201d \u201c \u2018[C]learly established Federal law\u2019 \u201d includes only \u201c \u2018the\n holdings\u201d of the Court\u2019s decisions,\u2019 \u201d Howes v. Fields, 565 U. S. ___,\n ___; and an \u201cunreasonable application of \u201d those holdings must be\n \u201c \u2018objectively unreasonable,\u2019 \u201d Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 75\u2013\n 76. The state-court ruling must rest on \u201can error well understood\n and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fair-\n minded disagreement.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___.\n2                          WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n      Here, the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion was not \u201ccontrary\n    to\u201d the Court\u2019s holdings in Carter, supra, which required a no-\n    adverse-inference instruction at the guilt phase; in Estelle v. Smith,\n    451 U. S. 454, which concerned the introduction at the penalty phase\n    of the results of an involuntary, un-Mirandized pretrial psychiatric\n    examination; or in Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314, 327\u2013330,\n    which disapproved a trial judge\u2019s drawing of an adverse inference\n    from the defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing \u201cwith regard to factual de-\n    terminations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.\u201d\n    Nor was the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion an unreasonable\n    application of the holdings in those cases. This Court need not decide\n    whether a no-adverse-inference instruction is required in these cir-\n    cumstances, for the issue before the Kentucky Supreme Court was, at\n    a minimum, not \u201cbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagree-\n    ment,\u201d Harrington, supra, at ___. Mitchell in particular leaves open\n    the possibility that some inferences might permissibly be drawn from\n    a defendant\u2019s penalty-phase silence. Thus, it cannot be read to re-\n    quire the type of blanket no-adverse-inference instruction requested\n    and denied here. Moreover, because respondent\u2019s own admissions of\n    guilt had established every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the\n    burden of proof, Mitchell\u2019s narrow holding, which implied that it was\n    limited to inferences pertaining to the facts of the crime, does not ap-\n    ply. Pp. 3\u20139.\n      (b) Respondent contends that the state court was unreasonable in\n    refusing to extend a governing legal principle to a context in which it\n    should have controlled, but this Court has never adopted such a rule.\n    Section 2254(d)(1) provides a remedy for instances in which a state\n    court unreasonably applies this Court\u2019s precedent; it does not require\n    state courts to extend that precedent or license federal courts to treat\n    the failure to do so as error. The appropriate time to consider, as a\n    matter of first impression, whether Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell re-\n    quire a penalty-phase no-adverse-inference instruction would be on\n    direct review, not in a habeas case governed by \u00a72254(d).

ROBERT\n\n              KEITH WOODALL \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 23, 2014] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Respondent brutally raped, slashed with a box cutter,\nand drowned a 16-year-old high-school student. After\npleading guilty to murder, rape, and kidnaping, he was\nsentenced to death. The Kentucky Supreme Court af-\nfirmed the sentence, and we denied certiorari. Ten years\nlater, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted\nrespondent\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus on his\nFifth Amendment claim. In so doing, it disregarded the\nlimitations of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)\u2014a provision of law that\nsome federal judges find too confining, but that all federal\njudges must obey. We reverse.\n                             I\n  On the evening of January 25, 1997, Sarah Hansen\ndrove to a convenience store to rent a movie. When she\nfailed to return home several hours later, her family called\nthe police. Officers eventually found the vehicle Hansen\nhad been driving a short distance from the convenience\nstore. They followed a 400- to 500-foot trail of blood from\nthe van to a nearby lake, where Hansen\u2019s unclothed, dead\nbody was found floating in the water. Hansen\u2019s \u201cthroat\n2                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad been slashed twice with each cut approximately 3.5 to\n4 inches long,\u201d and \u201c[h]er windpipe was totally severed.\u201d\nWoodall v. Commonwealth, 63 S. W. 3d 104, 114 (Ky.\n2002).\n  Authorities questioned respondent when they learned\nthat he had been in the convenience store on the night of\nthe murder. Respondent gave conflicting statements\nregarding his whereabouts that evening. Further investi-\ngation revealed that respondent\u2019s \u201cfingerprints were on\nthe van the victim was driving,\u201d \u201c[b]lood was found on\n[respondent\u2019s] front door,\u201d \u201c[b]lood on his clothing and\nsweatshirt was consistent with the blood of the victim,\u201d\nand \u201cDNA on . . . vaginal swabs\u201d taken from the victim\n\u201cwas consistent with\u201d respondent\u2019s. Ibid.\n  Faced with overwhelming evidence of his guilt, respond-\nent pleaded guilty to capital murder. He also pleaded\nguilty to capital kidnaping and first-degree rape, the\nstatutory aggravating circumstance for the murder. See\nApp. 78; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7532.025(2)(a) (West Supp.\n2012). At the ensuing penalty-phase trial, respondent\ncalled character witnesses but declined to testify himself.\nDefense counsel asked the trial judge to instruct the jury\nthat \u201c[a] defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact\nthat the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him\nin any way.\u201d App. 31. The trial judge denied the request,\nand the Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed that denial.\nWoodall v. Commonwealth, supra, at 115. While recog-\nnizing that the Fifth Amendment requires a no-adverse-\ninference instruction to protect a nontestifying defendant\nat the guilt phase, see Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288\n(1981), the court held that Carter and our subsequent\ncases did not require such an instruction here. Woodall v.\nCommonwealth, supra, at 115. We denied respondent\u2019s\npetition for a writ of certiorari from that direct appeal.\nWoodall v. Kentucky, 537 U. S. 835 (2002).\n  In 2006, respondent filed this petition for habeas corpus\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

The District Court granted\nrelief, holding, as relevant here, that the trial court\u2019s\nrefusal to issue a no-adverse-inference instruction at the\npenalty phase violated respondent\u2019s Fifth Amendment\nprivilege against self-incrimination. Woodall v. Simpson,\nNo. 5:06CV\u2013P216\u2013R (WD Ky., Feb. 24, 2009), App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 58a\u201361a, 2009 WL 464939, *12. The Court of\nAppeals affirmed and ordered Kentucky to either resen-\ntence respondent within 180 days or release him. Woodall\nv. Simpson, 685 F. 3d 574, 581 (CA6 2012).1 Judge Cook\ndissented.\n  We granted certiorari. 570 U.

Lancaster, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at\n4\u20135). \u201c \u2018[C]learly established Federal law\u2019 \u201d for purposes of\n\u00a72254(d)(1) includes only \u201c \u2018the holdings, as opposed to the\ndicta, of this Court\u2019s decisions.\u2019 \u201d Howes v. Fields, 565\nU. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000)). And an \u201cunreasonable\napplication of \u201d those holdings must be \u201c \u2018objectively unrea-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court of Appeals did not reach the alternative ground for the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision: respondent\u2019s claim based on Batson v. Ken-\ntucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986). See 685 F. 3d, at 577\u2013578. That claim is not\nbefore us here.\n4                        WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsonable,\u2019 \u201d not merely wrong; even \u201cclear error\u201d will not\nsuffice. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 75\u201376 (2003).\nRather, \u201c[a]s a condition for obtaining habeas corpus from\na federal court, a state prisoner must show that the state\ncourt\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court\nwas so lacking in justification that there was an error well\nunderstood and comprehended in existing law beyond any\npossibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d Harrington v.\nRichter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).\n   Both the Kentucky Supreme Court and the Court of\nAppeals identified as the relevant precedents in this area\nour decisions in Carter, Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454\n(1981), and Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314 (1999).\nCarter held that a no-adverse-inference instruction is\nrequired at the guilt phase. 450 U. S., at 294\u2013295, 300.\nEstelle concerned the introduction at the penalty phase of\nthe results of an involuntary, un-Mirandized pretrial\npsychiatric examination. 451 U. S., at 456\u2013457, and n. 1;\nid., at 461. And Mitchell disapproved a trial judge\u2019s draw-\ning of an adverse inference from the defendant\u2019s silence at\nsentencing \u201cwith regard to factual determinations respect-\ning the circumstances and details of the crime.\u201d 526 U. S.,\nat 327\u2013330.\n   It is clear that the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s conclu-\nsion is not \u201ccontrary to\u201d the actual holding of any of these\ncases. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). The Court of Appeals held,\nhowever, that the \u201cKentucky Supreme Court\u2019s denial of\nthis constitutional claim was an unreasonable application\nof \u201d those cases. 685 F. 3d, at 579. In its view, \u201creading\nCarter, Estelle, and Mitchell together, the only reasonable\nconclusion is that\u201d a no-adverse-inference instruction was\nrequired at the penalty phase. Ibid.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court of Appeals also based its conclusion that respondent \u201cwas\n\nentitled to receive a no adverse inference instruction\u201d on one of its own\ncases, Finney v. Rothgerber, 751 F. 2d 858, 863\u2013864 (CA6 1985). 685\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  We need not decide here, and express no view on,\nwhether the conclusion that a no-adverse-inference in-\nstruction was required would be correct in a case not\nreviewed through the lens of \u00a72254(d)(1). For we are\nsatisfied that the issue was, at a minimum, not \u201cbeyond\nany possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d Harrington,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  We have, it is true, held that the privilege against self-\nincrimination applies to the penalty phase. See Estelle,\nsupra, at 463; Mitchell, supra, at 328\u2013329. But it is not\nuncommon for a constitutional rule to apply somewhat\ndifferently at the penalty phase than it does at the guilt\nphase. See, e.g., Bobby v. Mitts, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 4). We have \u201cnever directly held\nthat Carter applies at a sentencing phase where the Fifth\nAmendment interests of the defendant are different.\u201d\nUnited States v. Whitten, 623 F. 3d 125, 131\u2013132, n. 4\n(CA2 2010) (Livingston, J., dissenting from denial of re-\nhearing en banc).\n  Indeed, Mitchell itself leaves open the possibility that\nsome inferences might permissibly be drawn from a de-\nfendant\u2019s penalty-phase silence. In that case, the District\nJudge had actually drawn from the defendant\u2019s silence an\nadverse inference about the drug quantity attributable to\nthe defendant. See 526 U. S., at 317\u2013319. We held that\nthis ran afoul of the defendant\u2019s \u201cright to remain silent at\nsentencing.\u201d Id., at 325, 327\u2013328 (citing Griffin v. Cali-\nfornia, 380 U. S. 609, 614 (1965)). But we framed our\nholding narrowly, in terms implying that it was limited to\ninferences pertaining to the facts of the crime: \u201cWe decline\nto adopt an exception for the sentencing phase of a crimi-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nF. 3d, at 579 (internal quotation marks omitted). That was improper.\nAs we cautioned the Sixth Circuit two Terms ago, a lower court may not\n\u201cconsul[t] its own precedents, rather than those of this Court, in as-\nsessing\u201d a habeas claim governed by \u00a72254. Parker v. Matthews, 567\nU. S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12).\n6                        WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnal case with regard to factual determinations respecting\nthe circumstances and details of the crime.\u201d Mitchell, 526\nU. S., at 328 (emphasis added). \u201cThe Government re-\ntains,\u201d we said, \u201cthe burden of proving facts relevant to the\ncrime . . . and cannot enlist the defendant in this process\nat the expense of the self-incrimination privilege.\u201d Id., at\n330 (emphasis added). And Mitchell included an express\nreservation of direct relevance here: \u201cWhether silence\nbears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon\nacceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward\nadjustment provided in \u00a73E1.1 of the United States Sen-\ntencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question. It is not\nbefore us, and we express no view on it.\u201d Ibid.3\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Courts of Appeals have recognized that Mitchell left this unre-\n\nsolved; their diverging approaches to the question illustrate the possi-\nbility of fairminded disagreement. Compare United States v. Caro, 597\nF. 3d 608, 629\u2013630 (CA4 2010) (direct appeal) (noting that Mitchell\n\u201creserved the question of whether silence bears upon lack of remorse,\u201d\nbut reasoning that \u201cEstelle and Mitchell together suggest that the Fifth\nAmendment may well prohibit considering a defendant\u2019s silence regard-\ning the nonstatutory aggravating factor of lack of remorse\u201d), with Burr\nv. Pollard, 546 F. 3d 828, 832 (CA7 2008) (habeas) (while the right to\nremain silent persists at sentencing, \u201csilence can be consistent not only\nwith exercising one\u2019s constitutional right, but also with a lack of re-\nmorse,\u201d which \u201cis properly considered at sentencing\u201d (citing Mitchell,\n526 U. S., at 326\u2013327)); Lee v. Crouse, 451 F. 3d 598, 605, n. 3 (CA10\n2006) (habeas) (\u201c[T]he circuit courts have readily confined Mitchell to\nits stated holding, and have allowed sentencing courts to rely on, or\ndraw inferences from, a defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment\nrights for purposes other than determining the facts of the offense of\nconviction\u201d).\n   Indeed, the Sixth Circuit itself has previously recognized that Mitch-\nell \u201cexplicitly limited its holding regarding inferences drawn from a\ndefendant\u2019s silence to facts about the substantive offense and did not\naddress other inferences that may be drawn from a defendant\u2019s si-\nlence.\u201d United States v. Kennedy, 499 F. 3d 547, 552 (2007) (direct\nappeal). Kennedy upheld under Mitchell a sentencing judge\u2019s consider-\nation of the defendant\u2019s refusal to complete a court-ordered psychosex-\nual examination. 499 F. 3d, at 551\u2013552.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

And it was a\nblanket instruction that was requested and denied in this\ncase; respondent\u2019s requested instruction would have in-\nformed the jury that \u201c[a] defendant is not compelled to\ntestify and the fact that the defendant did not testify\nshould not prejudice him in any way.\u201d App. 31 (emphasis\nadded). Counsel for respondent conceded at oral argument\nthat remorse was at issue during the penalty-phase trial,\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Respondent 18,\nyet the proposed instruction would have precluded the\njury from considering respondent\u2019s silence as indicative of\nhis lack of remorse. Indeed, the trial judge declined to\ngive the no-adverse-inference instruction precisely because\nhe was \u201caware of no case law that precludes the jury from\nconsidering the defendant\u2019s lack of expression of remorse\n. . . in sentencing.\u201d App. 36. This alone suffices to estab-\nlish that the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion was\nnot \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d Andrade, 538 U. S., at 76.\n    Second, regardless of the scope of respondent\u2019s proposed\ninstruction, any inferences that could have been drawn\nfrom respondent\u2019s silence would arguably fall within the\nclass of inferences as to which Mitchell leaves the door\nopen. Respondent pleaded guilty to all of the charges he\nfaced, including the applicable aggravating circumstances.\nThus, Kentucky could not have shifted to respondent its\n\u201cburden of proving facts relevant to the crime,\u201d 526 U. S.,\nat 330: Respondent\u2019s own admissions had already estab-\nlished every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the\nburden of proof. There are reasonable arguments that the\nlogic of Mitchell does not apply to such cases. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Ronquillo, 508 F. 3d 744, 749 (CA5 2007)\n(\u201cMitchell is inapplicable to the sentencing decision in this\n8                         WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ncase because \u2018the facts of the offense\u2019 were based entirely\non Ronquillo\u2019s admissions, not on any adverse inference\n. . . . Ronquillo, unlike the defendant in Mitchell, admitted\nall the predicate facts of his offenses\u201d).\n    The dissent insists that Mitchell is irrelevant because it\nmerely declined to create an exception to the \u201cnormal\nrule,\u201d supposedly established by Estelle, \u201cthat a defendant\nis entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction\u201d\nat sentencing. Post, at 5 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That\nargument disregards perfectly reasonable interpretations\nof Estelle and Mitchell and hence contravenes \u00a72254(d)\u2019s\ndeferential standard of review. Estelle did not involve an\nadverse inference based on the defendant\u2019s silence or a\ncorresponding jury instruction. See 451 U. S., at 461\u2013469.\nThus, whatever Estelle said about the Fifth Amendment,\nits holding4\u2014the only aspect of the decision relevant\nhere\u2014does not \u201crequir[e]\u201d the categorical rule the dissent\nascribes to it. Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 76 (2006).\nLikewise, fairminded jurists could conclude that Mitchell\u2019s\nreservation regarding remorse and acceptance of responsi-\nbility would have served no meaningful purpose if Estelle\nhad created an across-the-board rule against adverse\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The dissent says Estelle \u201cheld that \u2018so far as the protection of the\n\nFifth Amendment is concerned,\u2019 it could \u2018discern no basis to distinguish\nbetween the guilt and penalty phases of a defendant\u2019s \u2018capital murder\ntrial.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 2 (quoting Estelle, 451 U. S., at 462\u2013463). Of course, it\ndid not \u201chold\u201d that. Rather, it held that the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amend-\nment \u201crights were abridged by the State\u2019s introduction of \u201d a pretrial\npsychiatric evaluation that was administered without the preliminary\nwarning required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). 451\nU. S., at 473. In any event, even Estelle\u2019s dictum did not assume an\nentitlement to a blanket no-adverse-inference instruction. The quoted\nlanguage is reasonably read as referring to the availability of the Fifth\nAmendment privilege at sentencing rather than the precise scope of\nthat privilege when applied in the sentencing context. Indeed, it\nappears in a passage responding to the State\u2019s argument that the\ndefendant \u201cwas not entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment\u201d\nin the first place.

In these circum-\nstances, where the \u201c \u2018precise contours\u2019 \u201d of the right remain\n\u201c \u2018unclear,\u2019 \u201d state courts enjoy \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in their\nadjudication of a prisoner\u2019s claims. Lockyer, 538 U. S., at\n76 (quoting Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 998\n(1991) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and in judgment)).\n                                B\n    In arguing for a contrary result, respondent leans heavily\non the notion that a state-court \u201c \u2018determination may be\nset aside . . . if, under clearly established federal law, the\nstate court was unreasonable in refusing to extend the\ngoverning legal principle to a context in which the princi-\nple should have controlled.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 21\n(quoting Ramdass v. Angelone, 530 U. S. 156, 166 (2000)\n(plurality opinion)). The Court of Appeals and District\nCourt relied on the same proposition in sustaining re-\nspondent\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim. See 685 F. 3d, at 579;\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 37a\u201339a, 2009 WL 464939, *4.\n     The unreasonable-refusal-to-extend concept originated\nin a Fourth Circuit opinion we discussed at length in\nWilliams, our first in-depth analysis of the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). See\n529 U. S., at 407\u2013409 (citing Green v. French, 143 F. 3d\n865, 869\u2013870 (1998)). We described the Fourth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation of \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s \u201cunreasonable application\u201d\nclause as \u201cgenerally correct,\u201d 529 U. S., at 407, and ap-\nproved its conclusion that \u201ca state-court decision involves\nan unreasonable application of this Court\u2019s precedent if\nthe state court identifies the correct governing legal rule\n. . . but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particu-\nlar state prisoner\u2019s case,\u201d id., at 407\u2013408 (citing Green,\nsupra, at 869\u2013870). But we took no position on the Fourth\nCircuit\u2019s further conclusion that a state court commits\n10                  WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAEDPA error if it \u201cunreasonably refuse[s] to extend a legal\nprinciple to a new context where it should apply.\u201d 529\nU. S., at 408\u2013409 (citing Green, supra, at 869\u2013870). We\nchose not \u201cto decide how such \u2018extension of legal principle\u2019\ncases should be treated under \u00a72254(d)(1)\u201d because the\nFourth Circuit\u2019s proposed rule for resolving them presented\nseveral \u201cproblems of precision.\u201d 529 U. S., at 408\u2013409.\n   Two months later, a plurality paraphrased and applied\nthe unreasonable-refusal-to-extend concept in Ramdass.\nSee 530 U. S., at 166\u2013170. It did not, however, grant the\nhabeas petitioner relief on that basis, finding that there\nwas no unreasonable refusal to extend. Moreover, Justice\nO\u2019Connor, whose vote was necessary to form a majority,\ncited Williams and made no mention of the unreasonable-\nrefusal-to-extend concept in her separate opinion concur-\nring in the judgment.        See 530 U. S., at 178\u2013181.\nRamdass therefore did not alter the interpretation of\n\u00a72254(d)(1) set forth in Williams. Aside from one opinion\ncriticizing the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend doctrine, see\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 666 (2004), we\nhave not revisited the issue since Williams and Ramdass.\nDuring that same 14-year stretch, however, we have\nrepeatedly restated our \u201chold[ing]\u201d in Williams, supra, at\n409, that a state-court decision is an unreasonable appli-\ncation of our clearly established precedent if it correctly\nidentifies the governing legal rule but applies that rule\nunreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner\u2019s case,\nsee, e.g., Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 10); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 380\n(2005); Yarborough, supra, at 663; Penry v. Johnson, 532\nU. S. 782, 792 (2001).\n   Thus, this Court has never adopted the unreasonable-\nrefusal-to-extend rule on which respondent relies. It has\nnot been so much as endorsed in a majority opinion, let\nalone relied on as a basis for granting habeas relief. To\nthe extent the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend rule differs\n                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the one embraced in Williams and reiterated many\ntimes since, we reject it. Section 2254(d)(1) provides a\nremedy for instances in which a state court unreasonably\napplies this Court\u2019s precedent; it does not require state\ncourts to extend that precedent or license federal courts\nto treat the failure to do so as error. See Scheidegger, Ha-\nbeas Corpus, Relitigation, and the Legislative Power, 98\nColum. L. Rev. 888, 949 (1998). Thus, \u201cif a habeas court\nmust extend a rationale before it can apply to the facts at\nhand,\u201d then by definition the rationale was not \u201cclearly\nestablished at the time of the state-court decision.\u201d Yar-\nborough, 541 U. S., at 666. AEDPA\u2019s carefully constructed\nframework \u201cwould be undermined if habeas courts intro-\nduced rules not clearly established under the guise of\nextensions to existing law.\u201d Ibid.\n  This is not to say that \u00a72254(d)(1) requires an \u201c \u2018identical\nfactual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.\u2019 \u201d\nPanetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 953 (2007). To the\ncontrary, state courts must reasonably apply the rules\n\u201csquarely established\u201d by this Court\u2019s holdings to the facts\nof each case. Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. 111, 122\n(2009). \u201c[T]he difference between applying a rule and\nextending it is not always clear,\u201d but \u201c[c]ertain principles\nare fundamental enough that when new factual permu-\ntations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule will\nbe beyond doubt.\u201d Yarborough, supra, at 666. The crit-\nical point is that relief is available under \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s\nunreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is so obvious\nthat a clearly established rule applies to a given set of\nfacts that there could be no \u201cfairminded disagreement\u201d on\nthe question, Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  Perhaps the logical next step from Carter, Estelle, and\nMitchell would be to hold that the Fifth Amendment re-\nquires a penalty-phase no-adverse-inference instruction in\na case like this one; perhaps not. Either way, we have not\nyet taken that step, and there are reasonable arguments\n12                  WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non both sides\u2014which is all Kentucky needs to prevail in\nthis AEDPA case. The appropriate time to consider the\nquestion as a matter of first impression would be on direct\nreview, not in a habeas case governed by \u00a72254(d)(1).\n                        *    *    *\n   Because the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of\nrespondent\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim was not objectively\nunreasonable, the Sixth Circuit erred in granting the writ.\nWe therefore need not reach its further holding that the\ntrial court\u2019s putative error was not harmless. The judg-\nment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

The court refused, and the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt agreed that no instruction was warranted. The\nquestion before us is whether the Kentucky courts unrea-\nsonably applied clearly established Supreme Court law in\nconcluding that the Fifth Amendment did not entitle\nWoodall to a no-adverse-inference instruction. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). In my view, the answer is yes.\n                               I\n  This Court\u2019s decisions in Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S.\n288 (1981), and Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454 (1981),\nclearly establish that a criminal defendant is entitled to a\nrequested no-adverse-inference instruction in the penalty\nphase of a capital trial. First consider Carter. The Court\nheld that a trial judge \u201chas the constitutional obligation,\nupon proper request,\u201d to give a requested no-adverse-\ninference instruction in order \u201cto minimize the danger that\nthe jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant\u2019s\nfailure to testify.\u201d 450 U. S., at 305. This is because when\n\u201cthe jury is left to roam at large with only its untutored\n2                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ninstincts to guide it,\u201d it may \u201cdraw from the defendant\u2019s\nsilence broad inferences of guilt.\u201d Id., at 301. A trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal to give a requested no-adverse-inference\ninstruction thus \u201cexacts an impermissible toll on the full\nand free exercise of the [Fifth Amendment] privilege.\u201d Id.,\nat 305.\n   Now consider Estelle. The Court held that \u201cso far as the\nprotection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned,\u201d\nit could \u201cdiscern no basis to distinguish between the guilt\nand penalty phases\u201d of a defendant\u2019s \u201ccapital murder\ntrial.\u201d 451 U. S., at 462\u2013463. The State had introduced at\nthe penalty phase the defendant\u2019s compelled statements to\na psychiatrist, in order to show the defendant\u2019s future\ndangerousness. Defending the admission of those state-\nments, the State argued that the defendant \u201cwas not\nentitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment because\n[his statements were] used only to determine punishment\nafter conviction, not to establish guilt.\u201d Id., at 462. This\nCourt rejected the State\u2019s argument on the ground that\nthe Fifth Amendment applies equally to the penalty phase\nand the guilt phase of a capital trial. Id., at 462\u2013463.\n   What is unclear about the resulting law? If the Court\nholds in Case A that the First Amendment prohibits Con-\ngress from discriminating based on viewpoint, and then\nholds in Case B that the Fourteenth Amendment incorpo-\nrates the First Amendment as to the States, then it is\nclear that the First Amendment prohibits the States from\ndiscriminating based on viewpoint. By the same logic,\nbecause the Court held in Carter that the Fifth Amend-\nment requires a trial judge to give a requested no-adverse-\ninference instruction during the guilt phase of a trial, and\nheld in Estelle that there is no basis for distinguishing\nbetween the guilt and punishment phases of a capital trial\nfor purposes of the Fifth Amendment, it is clear that the\nFifth Amendment requires a judge to provide a requested\nno-adverse-inference instruction during the penalty phase\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)       3\n\n                         BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof a capital trial.\n                             II\n   The Court avoids this logic by reading Estelle too nar-\nrowly. First, it contends that Estelle\u2019s holding that the\nFifth Amendment applies equally to the guilt and penalty\nphases was mere dictum. Ante, at 8, and n. 4. But this\nrule was essential to the resolution of the case, so it is\nbinding precedent, not dictum.\n   Second, apparently in the alternative, the majority\nacknowledges that Estelle \u201cheld that the privilege against\nself-incrimination applies to the penalty phase,\u201d but it\nconcludes that Estelle said nothing about the content of\nthe privilege in the penalty phase. Ante, at 5 (emphasis\nadded). This interpretation of Estelle ignores its rationale.\nThe reason that Estelle concluded that the Fifth Amend-\nment applies to the penalty phase of a capital trial is that\nthe Court saw \u201cno basis to distinguish between the guilt\nand penalty phases of [a defendant\u2019s] capital murder trial\nso far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege\nis concerned.\u201d 451 U. S., at 462\u2013463. And as there is no\nbasis to distinguish between the two contexts for Fifth\nAmendment purposes, there is no basis for varying either\nthe application or the content of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege in the two contexts.\n   The majority also reads our decision in Mitchell v. United\nStates, 526 U. S. 314 (1999), to change the legal land-\nscape where it expressly declined to do so. In Mitchell, the\nCourt considered whether to create an exception to the\n\u201cnormal rule in a criminal case . . . that no negative infer-\nence from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is permitted.\u201d\nId., at 328. We refused: \u201cWe decline to adopt an exception\nfor the sentencing phase of a criminal case with regard to\nfactual determinations respecting the circumstances and\ndetails of the crime.\u201d Ibid. Mitchell thus reiterated what\nCarter and Estelle had already established. The \u201cnormal\n4                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrule\u201d is that Fifth Amendment protections apply during\ntrial and sentencing. Because the Court refused \u201cto adopt\nan exception\u201d to this default rule, ibid. (emphasis added),\nthe law before and after Mitchell remained the same.\n   The majority seizes upon the limited nature of Mitchell\u2019s\nholding, concluding that by refusing to adopt an exception\nto the normal rule for certain \u201cfactual determinations,\u201d\nMitchell suggested that inferences about other matters\nmight be permissible at the penalty phase. Ante, at 5\u20137.\nThe majority seems to believe that Mitchell somehow casts\ndoubt upon whether Estelle\u2019s Fifth Amendment rule ap-\nplies to matters unrelated to the \u201ccircumstances and\ndetails of the crime,\u201d such as remorse, or as to which the\nState does not bear the burden of proof.\n   As an initial matter, Mitchell would have had to over-\nrule\u2014or at least substantially limit\u2014Estelle to create an\nexception for matters unrelated to the circumstances and\ndetails of the crime or for matters on which the defendant\nbears the burden of proof. Sentencing proceedings, partic-\nularly capital sentencing proceedings, often focus on fac-\ntual matters that do not directly concern facts of the\ncrime. Was the defendant subject to flagrant abuse in his\ngrowing-up years? Is he suffering from a severe physical\nor mental impairment? Was he supportive of his family?\nIs he remorseful? Estelle itself involved compelled state-\nments introduced to establish the defendant\u2019s future\ndangerousness\u2014another fact often unrelated to the cir-\ncumstances or details of a defendant\u2019s crime. 451 U. S., at\n456. In addition, States typically place the burden to\nprove mitigating factors at the penalty phase on the de-\nfendant. A reasonable jurist would not believe that Mitch-\nell, by refusing to create an exception to Estelle, intended\nto undermine the very case it reaffirmed.\n   Mitchell held, simply and only, that the normal rule of\nEstelle applied in the circumstances of the particular case\nbefore the Court. That holding does not destabilize settled\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlaw beyond its reach. We frequently resist reaching be-\nyond the facts of a case before us, and we often say so.\nThat does not mean that we throw cases involving all\nother factual circumstances into a shadow-land of legal\ndoubt.\n   The majority also places undue weight on dictum in\nMitchell reserving judgment as to whether to create addi-\ntional exceptions to the normal rule of Estelle and Carter.\nWe noted: \u201cWhether silence bears upon the determination\nof a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility\nfor purposes of the downward adjustment provided in\n\u00a73E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998),\nis a separate question. It is not before us, and we express\nno view on it.\u201d 526 U. S., at 330. This dictum, says the\nmajority, suggests that some inferences, including about\nremorse (which was at issue in Woodall\u2019s case), may be\npermissible. Ante, at 5\u20137.\n   When the Court merely reserves a question that is \u201cnot\nbefore us\u201d for a future case, we do not cast doubt on legal\nprinciples that are already clearly established. The Court\noften identifies questions that it is not answering in order\nto clarify the question it is answering. In so doing\u2014that\nis, in \u201cexpress[ing] no view\u201d on questions that are not\nsquarely before us\u2014we do not create a state of uncertainty\nas to those questions. And in respect to Mitchell, where\nthe Court reserved the question whether to create an\nexception to the normal rule, this is doubly true. The\nnormal rule that a defendant is entitled to a requested no-\nadverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase as well\nas the guilt phase remained clearly established after\nMitchell.\n                           III\n  In holding that the Kentucky courts did not unreasona-\nbly apply clearly established law, the majority declares\nthat if a court must \u201cextend\u201d the rationale of a case in\n6                    WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\norder to apply it, the rationale is not clearly established.\nAnte, at 9\u201311. I read this to mean simply that if there\nmay be \u201cfairminded disagreement\u201d about whether a ra-\ntionale applies to a certain set of facts, a state court will\nnot unreasonably apply the law by failing to apply that\nrationale, and I agree. See Harrington v. Richter, 562\nU. S. ___ (2011). I do not understand the majority to\nsuggest that reading two legal principles together would\nnecessarily \u201cextend\u201d the law, which would be a proposition\nentirely inconsistent with our case law. As long as fair-\nminded jurists would conclude that two (or more) legal\nrules considered together would dictate a particular out-\ncome, a state court unreasonably applies the law when it\nholds otherwise. Ibid.\n   That is the error the Kentucky Supreme Court commit-\nted here. Failing to consider together the legal principles\nestablished by Carter and Estelle, the state court confined\nthose cases to their facts. It held that Carter did not apply\nbecause Woodall had already pleaded guilty\u2014that is,\nbecause Woodall requested a no-adverse-inference instruc-\ntion at the penalty phase rather than the guilt phase of his\ntrial. Woodall v. Commonwealth, 63 S. W. 3d 104, 115\n(Ky. 2001). And it concluded that Estelle did not apply\nbecause Estelle was not a \u201cjury instruction case.\u201d 63 S. W.\n3d, at 115. The Kentucky Supreme Court unreasonably\nfailed to recognize that together Carter and Estelle compel\na requested no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty\nphase of a capital trial. And reading Mitchell to rein in\nthe law in contemplation of never-before-recognized excep-\ntions to this normal rule would be an unreasonable retrac-\ntion of clearly established law, not a proper failure to\n\u201cextend\u201d it. Because the Sixth Circuit correctly applied\nclearly established law in granting Woodall\u2019s habeas\npetition, I would affirm.\n   With respect I dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary\nconclusion.\n",

Argued December 11, 2013\u2014Decided April 23, 2014\nRespondent pleaded guilty to capital murder, capital kidnaping, and\n  first-degree rape, the statutory aggravating circumstance for the\n  murder. He was sentenced to death after the trial court denied de-\n  fense counsel\u2019s request to instruct the jury not to draw any adverse\n  inference from respondent\u2019s decision not to testify at the penalty\n  phase. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed, finding that the Fifth\n  Amendment\u2019s requirement of a no-adverse-inference instruction to\n  protect a nontestifying defendant at the guilt phase, see Carter v.\n  Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, is not required at the penalty phase. Subse-\n  quently, the Federal District Court granted respondent habeas relief,\n  holding that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction\n  violated respondent\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. The Sixth\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of respondent\u2019s\n Fifth Amendment claim was not objectively unreasonable, the Sixth\n Circuit erred in granting the writ. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) The difficult-to-meet standard of 28 U. S.

WOODALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n      Here, the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion was not \u201ccontrary\n    to\u201d the Court\u2019s holdings in Carter, supra, which required a no-\n    adverse-inference instruction at the guilt phase; in Estelle v. Smith,\n    451 U. S. 454, which concerned the introduction at the penalty phase\n    of the results of an involuntary, un-Mirandized pretrial psychiatric\n    examination; or in Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314, 327\u2013330,\n    which disapproved a trial judge\u2019s drawing of an adverse inference\n    from the defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing \u201cwith regard to factual de-\n    terminations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.\u201d\n    Nor was the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion an unreasonable\n    application of the holdings in those cases. This Court need not decide\n    whether a no-adverse-inference instruction is required in these cir-\n    cumstances, for the issue before the Kentucky Supreme Court was, at\n    a minimum, not \u201cbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagree-\n    ment,\u201d Harrington, supra, at ___. Mitchell in particular leaves open\n    the possibility that some inferences might permissibly be drawn from\n    a defendant\u2019s penalty-phase silence. Thus, it cannot be read to re-\n    quire the type of blanket no-adverse-inference instruction requested\n    and denied here. Moreover, because respondent\u2019s own admissions of\n    guilt had established every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the\n    burden of proof, Mitchell\u2019s narrow holding, which implied that it was\n    limited to inferences pertaining to the facts of the crime, does not ap-\n    ply. Pp. 3\u20139.\n      (b) Respondent contends that the state court was unreasonable in\n    refusing to extend a governing legal principle to a context in which it\n    should have controlled, but this Court has never adopted such a rule.\n    Section 2254(d)(1) provides a remedy for instances in which a state\n    court unreasonably applies this Court\u2019s precedent; it does not require\n    state courts to extend that precedent or license federal courts to treat\n    the failure to do so as error. The appropriate time to consider, as a\n    matter of first impression, whether Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell re-\n    quire a penalty-phase no-adverse-inference instruction would be on\n    direct review, not in a habeas case governed by \u00a72254(d).

After\npleading guilty to murder, rape, and kidnaping, he was\nsentenced to death. The Kentucky Supreme Court af-\nfirmed the sentence, and we denied certiorari. Ten years\nlater, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted\nrespondent\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus on his\nFifth Amendment claim. In so doing, it disregarded the\nlimitations of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)\u2014a provision of law that\nsome federal judges find too confining, but that all federal\njudges must obey. We reverse.\n                             I\n  On the evening of January 25, 1997, Sarah Hansen\ndrove to a convenience store to rent a movie. When she\nfailed to return home several hours later, her family called\nthe police. Officers eventually found the vehicle Hansen\nhad been driving a short distance from the convenience\nstore. They followed a 400- to 500-foot trail of blood from\nthe van to a nearby lake, where Hansen\u2019s unclothed, dead\nbody was found floating in the water. Hansen\u2019s \u201cthroat\n2                   WHITE v.

Commonwealth, 63 S. W. 3d 104, 114 (Ky.\n2002).\n  Authorities questioned respondent when they learned\nthat he had been in the convenience store on the night of\nthe murder. Respondent gave conflicting statements\nregarding his whereabouts that evening. Further investi-\ngation revealed that respondent\u2019s \u201cfingerprints were on\nthe van the victim was driving,\u201d \u201c[b]lood was found on\n[respondent\u2019s] front door,\u201d \u201c[b]lood on his clothing and\nsweatshirt was consistent with the blood of the victim,\u201d\nand \u201cDNA on . . . vaginal swabs\u201d taken from the victim\n\u201cwas consistent with\u201d respondent\u2019s. Ibid.\n  Faced with overwhelming evidence of his guilt, respond-\nent pleaded guilty to capital murder. He also pleaded\nguilty to capital kidnaping and first-degree rape, the\nstatutory aggravating circumstance for the murder. See\nApp. 78; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7532.025(2)(a) (West Supp.\n2012). At the ensuing penalty-phase trial, respondent\ncalled character witnesses but declined to testify himself.\nDefense counsel asked the trial judge to instruct the jury\nthat \u201c[a] defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact\nthat the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him\nin any way.\u201d App. 31. The trial judge denied the request,\nand the Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed that denial.\nWoodall v. Commonwealth, supra, at 115. While recog-\nnizing that the Fifth Amendment requires a no-adverse-\ninference instruction to protect a nontestifying defendant\nat the guilt phase, see Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288\n(1981), the court held that Carter and our subsequent\ncases did not require such an instruction here. Woodall v.\nCommonwealth, supra, at 115. We denied respondent\u2019s\npetition for a writ of certiorari from that direct appeal.\nWoodall v. Kentucky, 537 U.

S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).\n   Both the Kentucky Supreme Court and the Court of\nAppeals identified as the relevant precedents in this area\nour decisions in Carter, Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454\n(1981), and Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314 (1999).\nCarter held that a no-adverse-inference instruction is\nrequired at the guilt phase. 450 U. S., at 294\u2013295, 300.\nEstelle concerned the introduction at the penalty phase of\nthe results of an involuntary, un-Mirandized pretrial\npsychiatric examination. 451 U. S., at 456\u2013457, and n. 1;\nid., at 461. And Mitchell disapproved a trial judge\u2019s draw-\ning of an adverse inference from the defendant\u2019s silence at\nsentencing \u201cwith regard to factual determinations respect-\ning the circumstances and details of the crime.\u201d 526 U. S.,\nat 327\u2013330.\n   It is clear that the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s conclu-\nsion is not \u201ccontrary to\u201d the actual holding of any of these\ncases. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). The Court of Appeals held,\nhowever, that the \u201cKentucky Supreme Court\u2019s denial of\nthis constitutional claim was an unreasonable application\nof \u201d those cases. 685 F. 3d, at 579. In its view, \u201creading\nCarter, Estelle, and Mitchell together, the only reasonable\nconclusion is that\u201d a no-adverse-inference instruction was\nrequired at the penalty phase. Ibid.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court of Appeals also based its conclusion that respondent \u201cwas\n\nentitled to receive a no adverse inference instruction\u201d on one of its own\ncases, Finney v. Rothgerber, 751 F. 2d 858, 863\u2013864 (CA6 1985). 685\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

For we are\nsatisfied that the issue was, at a minimum, not \u201cbeyond\nany possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d Harrington,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  We have, it is true, held that the privilege against self-\nincrimination applies to the penalty phase. See Estelle,\nsupra, at 463; Mitchell, supra, at 328\u2013329. But it is not\nuncommon for a constitutional rule to apply somewhat\ndifferently at the penalty phase than it does at the guilt\nphase. See, e.g., Bobby v. Mitts, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 4). We have \u201cnever directly held\nthat Carter applies at a sentencing phase where the Fifth\nAmendment interests of the defendant are different.\u201d\nUnited States v. Whitten, 623 F. 3d 125, 131\u2013132, n. 4\n(CA2 2010) (Livingston, J., dissenting from denial of re-\nhearing en banc).\n  Indeed, Mitchell itself leaves open the possibility that\nsome inferences might permissibly be drawn from a de-\nfendant\u2019s penalty-phase silence. In that case, the District\nJudge had actually drawn from the defendant\u2019s silence an\nadverse inference about the drug quantity attributable to\nthe defendant. See 526 U. S., at 317\u2013319. We held that\nthis ran afoul of the defendant\u2019s \u201cright to remain silent at\nsentencing.\u201d Id., at 325, 327\u2013328 (citing Griffin v. Cali-\nfornia, 380 U. S. 609, 614 (1965)). But we framed our\nholding narrowly, in terms implying that it was limited to\ninferences pertaining to the facts of the crime: \u201cWe decline\nto adopt an exception for the sentencing phase of a crimi-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nF. 3d, at 579 (internal quotation marks omitted). That was improper.\nAs we cautioned the Sixth Circuit two Terms ago, a lower court may not\n\u201cconsul[t] its own precedents, rather than those of this Court, in as-\nsessing\u201d a habeas claim governed by \u00a72254. Parker v. Matthews, 567\nU. S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12).\n6                        WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnal case with regard to factual determinations respecting\nthe circumstances and details of the crime.\u201d Mitchell, 526\nU. S., at 328 (emphasis added). \u201cThe Government re-\ntains,\u201d we said, \u201cthe burden of proving facts relevant to the\ncrime . . . and cannot enlist the defendant in this process\nat the expense of the self-incrimination privilege.\u201d Id., at\n330 (emphasis added). And Mitchell included an express\nreservation of direct relevance here: \u201cWhether silence\nbears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon\nacceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward\nadjustment provided in \u00a73E1.1 of the United States Sen-\ntencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question. It is not\nbefore us, and we express no view on it.\u201d Ibid.3\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Courts of Appeals have recognized that Mitchell left this unre-\n\nsolved; their diverging approaches to the question illustrate the possi-\nbility of fairminded disagreement. Compare United States v. Caro, 597\nF. 3d 608, 629\u2013630 (CA4 2010) (direct appeal) (noting that Mitchell\n\u201creserved the question of whether silence bears upon lack of remorse,\u201d\nbut reasoning that \u201cEstelle and Mitchell together suggest that the Fifth\nAmendment may well prohibit considering a defendant\u2019s silence regard-\ning the nonstatutory aggravating factor of lack of remorse\u201d), with Burr\nv. Pollard, 546 F. 3d 828, 832 (CA7 2008) (habeas) (while the right to\nremain silent persists at sentencing, \u201csilence can be consistent not only\nwith exercising one\u2019s constitutional right, but also with a lack of re-\nmorse,\u201d which \u201cis properly considered at sentencing\u201d (citing Mitchell,\n526 U. S., at 326\u2013327)); Lee v. Crouse, 451 F. 3d 598, 605, n. 3 (CA10\n2006) (habeas) (\u201c[T]he circuit courts have readily confined Mitchell to\nits stated holding, and have allowed sentencing courts to rely on, or\ndraw inferences from, a defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment\nrights for purposes other than determining the facts of the offense of\nconviction\u201d).\n   Indeed, the Sixth Circuit itself has previously recognized that Mitch-\nell \u201cexplicitly limited its holding regarding inferences drawn from a\ndefendant\u2019s silence to facts about the substantive offense and did not\naddress other inferences that may be drawn from a defendant\u2019s si-\nlence.\u201d United States v. Kennedy, 499 F. 3d 547, 552 (2007) (direct\nappeal).

And it was a\nblanket instruction that was requested and denied in this\ncase; respondent\u2019s requested instruction would have in-\nformed the jury that \u201c[a] defendant is not compelled to\ntestify and the fact that the defendant did not testify\nshould not prejudice him in any way.\u201d App. 31 (emphasis\nadded). Counsel for respondent conceded at oral argument\nthat remorse was at issue during the penalty-phase trial,\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Respondent 18,\nyet the proposed instruction would have precluded the\njury from considering respondent\u2019s silence as indicative of\nhis lack of remorse. Indeed, the trial judge declined to\ngive the no-adverse-inference instruction precisely because\nhe was \u201caware of no case law that precludes the jury from\nconsidering the defendant\u2019s lack of expression of remorse\n. . . in sentencing.\u201d App. 36. This alone suffices to estab-\nlish that the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion was\nnot \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d Andrade, 538 U. S., at 76.\n    Second, regardless of the scope of respondent\u2019s proposed\ninstruction, any inferences that could have been drawn\nfrom respondent\u2019s silence would arguably fall within the\nclass of inferences as to which Mitchell leaves the door\nopen. Respondent pleaded guilty to all of the charges he\nfaced, including the applicable aggravating circumstances.\nThus, Kentucky could not have shifted to respondent its\n\u201cburden of proving facts relevant to the crime,\u201d 526 U. S.,\nat 330: Respondent\u2019s own admissions had already estab-\nlished every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the\nburden of proof. There are reasonable arguments that the\nlogic of Mitchell does not apply to such cases. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Ronquillo, 508 F. 3d 744, 749 (CA5 2007)\n(\u201cMitchell is inapplicable to the sentencing decision in this\n8                         WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ncase because \u2018the facts of the offense\u2019 were based entirely\non Ronquillo\u2019s admissions, not on any adverse inference\n. . . . Ronquillo, unlike the defendant in Mitchell, admitted\nall the predicate facts of his offenses\u201d).\n    The dissent insists that Mitchell is irrelevant because it\nmerely declined to create an exception to the \u201cnormal\nrule,\u201d supposedly established by Estelle, \u201cthat a defendant\nis entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction\u201d\nat sentencing. Post, at 5 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That\nargument disregards perfectly reasonable interpretations\nof Estelle and Mitchell and hence contravenes \u00a72254(d)\u2019s\ndeferential standard of review. Estelle did not involve an\nadverse inference based on the defendant\u2019s silence or a\ncorresponding jury instruction. See 451 U. S., at 461\u2013469.\nThus, whatever Estelle said about the Fifth Amendment,\nits holding4\u2014the only aspect of the decision relevant\nhere\u2014does not \u201crequir[e]\u201d the categorical rule the dissent\nascribes to it. Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 76 (2006).\nLikewise, fairminded jurists could conclude that Mitchell\u2019s\nreservation regarding remorse and acceptance of responsi-\nbility would have served no meaningful purpose if Estelle\nhad created an across-the-board rule against adverse\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The dissent says Estelle \u201cheld that \u2018so far as the protection of the\n\nFifth Amendment is concerned,\u2019 it could \u2018discern no basis to distinguish\nbetween the guilt and penalty phases of a defendant\u2019s \u2018capital murder\ntrial.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 2 (quoting Estelle, 451 U. S., at 462\u2013463). Of course, it\ndid not \u201chold\u201d that. Rather, it held that the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amend-\nment \u201crights were abridged by the State\u2019s introduction of \u201d a pretrial\npsychiatric evaluation that was administered without the preliminary\nwarning required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). 451\nU. S., at 473. In any event, even Estelle\u2019s dictum did not assume an\nentitlement to a blanket no-adverse-inference instruction. The quoted\nlanguage is reasonably read as referring to the availability of the Fifth\nAmendment privilege at sentencing rather than the precise scope of\nthat privilege when applied in the sentencing context. Indeed, it\nappears in a passage responding to the State\u2019s argument that the\ndefendant \u201cwas not entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment\u201d\nin the first place.

See\n529 U. S., at 407\u2013409 (citing Green v. French, 143 F. 3d\n865, 869\u2013870 (1998)). We described the Fourth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation of \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s \u201cunreasonable application\u201d\nclause as \u201cgenerally correct,\u201d 529 U.

But we took no position on the Fourth\nCircuit\u2019s further conclusion that a state court commits\n10                  WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAEDPA error if it \u201cunreasonably refuse[s] to extend a legal\nprinciple to a new context where it should apply.\u201d 529\nU. S., at 408\u2013409 (citing Green, supra, at 869\u2013870). We\nchose not \u201cto decide how such \u2018extension of legal principle\u2019\ncases should be treated under \u00a72254(d)(1)\u201d because the\nFourth Circuit\u2019s proposed rule for resolving them presented\nseveral \u201cproblems of precision.\u201d 529 U. S., at 408\u2013409.\n   Two months later, a plurality paraphrased and applied\nthe unreasonable-refusal-to-extend concept in Ramdass.\nSee 530 U. S., at 166\u2013170. It did not, however, grant the\nhabeas petitioner relief on that basis, finding that there\nwas no unreasonable refusal to extend. Moreover, Justice\nO\u2019Connor, whose vote was necessary to form a majority,\ncited Williams and made no mention of the unreasonable-\nrefusal-to-extend concept in her separate opinion concur-\nring in the judgment.        See 530 U. S., at 178\u2013181.\nRamdass therefore did not alter the interpretation of\n\u00a72254(d)(1) set forth in Williams. Aside from one opinion\ncriticizing the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend doctrine, see\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 666 (2004), we\nhave not revisited the issue since Williams and Ramdass.\nDuring that same 14-year stretch, however, we have\nrepeatedly restated our \u201chold[ing]\u201d in Williams, supra, at\n409, that a state-court decision is an unreasonable appli-\ncation of our clearly established precedent if it correctly\nidentifies the governing legal rule but applies that rule\nunreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner\u2019s case,\nsee, e.g., Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 10); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 380\n(2005); Yarborough, supra, at 663; Penry v. Johnson, 532\nU. S. 782, 792 (2001).\n   Thus, this Court has never adopted the unreasonable-\nrefusal-to-extend rule on which respondent relies. It has\nnot been so much as endorsed in a majority opinion, let\nalone relied on as a basis for granting habeas relief. To\nthe extent the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend rule differs\n                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the one embraced in Williams and reiterated many\ntimes since, we reject it. Section 2254(d)(1) provides a\nremedy for instances in which a state court unreasonably\napplies this Court\u2019s precedent; it does not require state\ncourts to extend that precedent or license federal courts\nto treat the failure to do so as error. See Scheidegger, Ha-\nbeas Corpus, Relitigation, and the Legislative Power, 98\nColum. L. Rev. 888, 949 (1998). Thus, \u201cif a habeas court\nmust extend a rationale before it can apply to the facts at\nhand,\u201d then by definition the rationale was not \u201cclearly\nestablished at the time of the state-court decision.\u201d Yar-\nborough, 541 U. S., at 666. AEDPA\u2019s carefully constructed\nframework \u201cwould be undermined if habeas courts intro-\nduced rules not clearly established under the guise of\nextensions to existing law.\u201d Ibid.\n  This is not to say that \u00a72254(d)(1) requires an \u201c \u2018identical\nfactual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.\u2019 \u201d\nPanetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 953 (2007). To the\ncontrary, state courts must reasonably apply the rules\n\u201csquarely established\u201d by this Court\u2019s holdings to the facts\nof each case. Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. 111, 122\n(2009). \u201c[T]he difference between applying a rule and\nextending it is not always clear,\u201d but \u201c[c]ertain principles\nare fundamental enough that when new factual permu-\ntations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule will\nbe beyond doubt.\u201d Yarborough, supra, at 666. The crit-\nical point is that relief is available under \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s\nunreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is so obvious\nthat a clearly established rule applies to a given set of\nfacts that there could be no \u201cfairminded disagreement\u201d on\nthe question, Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  Perhaps the logical next step from Carter, Estelle, and\nMitchell would be to hold that the Fifth Amendment re-\nquires a penalty-phase no-adverse-inference instruction in\na case like this one; perhaps not. Either way, we have not\nyet taken that step, and there are reasonable arguments\n12                  WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non both sides\u2014which is all Kentucky needs to prevail in\nthis AEDPA case. The appropriate time to consider the\nquestion as a matter of first impression would be on direct\nreview, not in a habeas case governed by \u00a72254(d)(1).\n                        *    *    *\n   Because the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of\nrespondent\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim was not objectively\nunreasonable, the Sixth Circuit erred in granting the writ.\nWe therefore need not reach its further holding that the\ntrial court\u2019s putative error was not harmless. The judg-\nment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

The court refused, and the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt agreed that no instruction was warranted. The\nquestion before us is whether the Kentucky courts unrea-\nsonably applied clearly established Supreme Court law in\nconcluding that the Fifth Amendment did not entitle\nWoodall to a no-adverse-inference instruction. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). In my view, the answer is yes.\n                               I\n  This Court\u2019s decisions in Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S.\n288 (1981), and Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454 (1981),\nclearly establish that a criminal defendant is entitled to a\nrequested no-adverse-inference instruction in the penalty\nphase of a capital trial. First consider Carter. The Court\nheld that a trial judge \u201chas the constitutional obligation,\nupon proper request,\u201d to give a requested no-adverse-\ninference instruction in order \u201cto minimize the danger that\nthe jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant\u2019s\nfailure to testify.\u201d 450 U. S., at 305. This is because when\n\u201cthe jury is left to roam at large with only its untutored\n2                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ninstincts to guide it,\u201d it may \u201cdraw from the defendant\u2019s\nsilence broad inferences of guilt.\u201d Id., at 301. A trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal to give a requested no-adverse-inference\ninstruction thus \u201cexacts an impermissible toll on the full\nand free exercise of the [Fifth Amendment] privilege.\u201d Id.,\nat 305.\n   Now consider Estelle. The Court held that \u201cso far as the\nprotection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned,\u201d\nit could \u201cdiscern no basis to distinguish between the guilt\nand penalty phases\u201d of a defendant\u2019s \u201ccapital murder\ntrial.\u201d 451 U. S., at 462\u2013463. The State had introduced at\nthe penalty phase the defendant\u2019s compelled statements to\na psychiatrist, in order to show the defendant\u2019s future\ndangerousness. Defending the admission of those state-\nments, the State argued that the defendant \u201cwas not\nentitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment because\n[his statements were] used only to determine punishment\nafter conviction, not to establish guilt.\u201d Id., at 462. This\nCourt rejected the State\u2019s argument on the ground that\nthe Fifth Amendment applies equally to the penalty phase\nand the guilt phase of a capital trial. Id., at 462\u2013463.\n   What is unclear about the resulting law? If the Court\nholds in Case A that the First Amendment prohibits Con-\ngress from discriminating based on viewpoint, and then\nholds in Case B that the Fourteenth Amendment incorpo-\nrates the First Amendment as to the States, then it is\nclear that the First Amendment prohibits the States from\ndiscriminating based on viewpoint. By the same logic,\nbecause the Court held in Carter that the Fifth Amend-\nment requires a trial judge to give a requested no-adverse-\ninference instruction during the guilt phase of a trial, and\nheld in Estelle that there is no basis for distinguishing\nbetween the guilt and punishment phases of a capital trial\nfor purposes of the Fifth Amendment, it is clear that the\nFifth Amendment requires a judge to provide a requested\nno-adverse-inference instruction during the penalty phase\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)       3\n\n                         BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof a capital trial.\n                             II\n   The Court avoids this logic by reading Estelle too nar-\nrowly. First, it contends that Estelle\u2019s holding that the\nFifth Amendment applies equally to the guilt and penalty\nphases was mere dictum. Ante, at 8, and n. 4. But this\nrule was essential to the resolution of the case, so it is\nbinding precedent, not dictum.\n   Second, apparently in the alternative, the majority\nacknowledges that Estelle \u201cheld that the privilege against\nself-incrimination applies to the penalty phase,\u201d but it\nconcludes that Estelle said nothing about the content of\nthe privilege in the penalty phase. Ante, at 5 (emphasis\nadded). This interpretation of Estelle ignores its rationale.\nThe reason that Estelle concluded that the Fifth Amend-\nment applies to the penalty phase of a capital trial is that\nthe Court saw \u201cno basis to distinguish between the guilt\nand penalty phases of [a defendant\u2019s] capital murder trial\nso far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege\nis concerned.\u201d 451 U. S., at 462\u2013463. And as there is no\nbasis to distinguish between the two contexts for Fifth\nAmendment purposes, there is no basis for varying either\nthe application or the content of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege in the two contexts.\n   The majority also reads our decision in Mitchell v. United\nStates, 526 U. S. 314 (1999), to change the legal land-\nscape where it expressly declined to do so. In Mitchell, the\nCourt considered whether to create an exception to the\n\u201cnormal rule in a criminal case . . . that no negative infer-\nence from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is permitted.\u201d\nId., at 328. We refused: \u201cWe decline to adopt an exception\nfor the sentencing phase of a criminal case with regard to\nfactual determinations respecting the circumstances and\ndetails of the crime.\u201d Ibid. Mitchell thus reiterated what\nCarter and Estelle had already established. The \u201cnormal\n4                   WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrule\u201d is that Fifth Amendment protections apply during\ntrial and sentencing. Because the Court refused \u201cto adopt\nan exception\u201d to this default rule, ibid. (emphasis added),\nthe law before and after Mitchell remained the same.\n   The majority seizes upon the limited nature of Mitchell\u2019s\nholding, concluding that by refusing to adopt an exception\nto the normal rule for certain \u201cfactual determinations,\u201d\nMitchell suggested that inferences about other matters\nmight be permissible at the penalty phase. Ante, at 5\u20137.\nThe majority seems to believe that Mitchell somehow casts\ndoubt upon whether Estelle\u2019s Fifth Amendment rule ap-\nplies to matters unrelated to the \u201ccircumstances and\ndetails of the crime,\u201d such as remorse, or as to which the\nState does not bear the burden of proof.\n   As an initial matter, Mitchell would have had to over-\nrule\u2014or at least substantially limit\u2014Estelle to create an\nexception for matters unrelated to the circumstances and\ndetails of the crime or for matters on which the defendant\nbears the burden of proof. Sentencing proceedings, partic-\nularly capital sentencing proceedings, often focus on fac-\ntual matters that do not directly concern facts of the\ncrime. Was the defendant subject to flagrant abuse in his\ngrowing-up years? Is he suffering from a severe physical\nor mental impairment? Was he supportive of his family?\nIs he remorseful? Estelle itself involved compelled state-\nments introduced to establish the defendant\u2019s future\ndangerousness\u2014another fact often unrelated to the cir-\ncumstances or details of a defendant\u2019s crime. 451 U. S., at\n456. In addition, States typically place the burden to\nprove mitigating factors at the penalty phase on the de-\nfendant. A reasonable jurist would not believe that Mitch-\nell, by refusing to create an exception to Estelle, intended\nto undermine the very case it reaffirmed.\n   Mitchell held, simply and only, that the normal rule of\nEstelle applied in the circumstances of the particular case\nbefore the Court. That holding does not destabilize settled\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlaw beyond its reach. We frequently resist reaching be-\nyond the facts of a case before us, and we often say so.\nThat does not mean that we throw cases involving all\nother factual circumstances into a shadow-land of legal\ndoubt.\n   The majority also places undue weight on dictum in\nMitchell reserving judgment as to whether to create addi-\ntional exceptions to the normal rule of Estelle and Carter.\nWe noted: \u201cWhether silence bears upon the determination\nof a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility\nfor purposes of the downward adjustment provided in\n\u00a73E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998),\nis a separate question. It is not before us, and we express\nno view on it.\u201d 526 U. S., at 330. This dictum, says the\nmajority, suggests that some inferences, including about\nremorse (which was at issue in Woodall\u2019s case), may be\npermissible. Ante, at 5\u20137.\n   When the Court merely reserves a question that is \u201cnot\nbefore us\u201d for a future case, we do not cast doubt on legal\nprinciples that are already clearly established. The Court\noften identifies questions that it is not answering in order\nto clarify the question it is answering. In so doing\u2014that\nis, in \u201cexpress[ing] no view\u201d on questions that are not\nsquarely before us\u2014we do not create a state of uncertainty\nas to those questions. And in respect to Mitchell, where\nthe Court reserved the question whether to create an\nexception to the normal rule, this is doubly true. The\nnormal rule that a defendant is entitled to a requested no-\nadverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase as well\nas the guilt phase remained clearly established after\nMitchell.\n                           III\n  In holding that the Kentucky courts did not unreasona-\nbly apply clearly established law, the majority declares\nthat if a court must \u201cextend\u201d the rationale of a case in\n6                    WHITE v. WOODALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\norder to apply it, the rationale is not clearly established.\nAnte, at 9\u201311. I read this to mean simply that if there\nmay be \u201cfairminded disagreement\u201d about whether a ra-\ntionale applies to a certain set of facts, a state court will\nnot unreasonably apply the law by failing to apply that\nrationale, and I agree. See Harrington v. Richter, 562\nU. S. ___ (2011). I do not understand the majority to\nsuggest that reading two legal principles together would\nnecessarily \u201cextend\u201d the law, which would be a proposition\nentirely inconsistent with our case law. As long as fair-\nminded jurists would conclude that two (or more) legal\nrules considered together would dictate a particular out-\ncome, a state court unreasonably applies the law when it\nholds otherwise. Ibid.\n   That is the error the Kentucky Supreme Court commit-\nted here. Failing to consider together the legal principles\nestablished by Carter and Estelle, the state court confined\nthose cases to their facts. It held that Carter did not apply\nbecause Woodall had already pleaded guilty\u2014that is,\nbecause Woodall requested a no-adverse-inference instruc-\ntion at the penalty phase rather than the guilt phase of his\ntrial. Woodall v. Commonwealth, 63 S. W. 3d 104, 115\n(Ky. 2001). And it concluded that Estelle did not apply\nbecause Estelle was not a \u201cjury instruction case.\u201d 63 S. W.\n3d, at 115. The Kentucky Supreme Court unreasonably\nfailed to recognize that together Carter and Estelle compel\na requested no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty\nphase of a capital trial. And reading Mitchell to rein in\nthe law in contemplation of never-before-recognized excep-\ntions to this normal rule would be an unreasonable retrac-\ntion of clearly established law, not a proper failure to\n\u201cextend\u201d it. Because the Sixth Circuit correctly applied\nclearly established law in granting Woodall\u2019s habeas\npetition, I would affirm.\n   With respect I dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary\nconclusion.\n</pre>",
