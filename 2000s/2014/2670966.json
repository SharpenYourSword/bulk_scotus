UNITED STATES ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12–8561. Argued January 22, 2014—Decided April 23, 2014\nThe respondent victim in this case was sexually abused as a young girl\n  in order to produce child pornography. When she was 17, she learned\n  that images of her abuse were being trafficked on the Internet, in ef-\n  fect repeating the original wrongs, for she knew that her humiliation\n  and hurt would be renewed well into the future as thousands of addi-\n  tional wrongdoers witnessed those crimes. Petitioner Paroline plead-\n  ed guilty in federal court to possessing images of child pornography,\n  which included two of the victim, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §2252.\n  The victim then sought restitution under §2259, requesting nearly $3\n  million in lost income and about $500,000 in future treatment and\n  counseling costs. The District Court declined to award restitution,\n  concluding that the Government had not met its burden of proving\n  what losses, if any, were proximately caused by Paroline’s offense.\n  The victim sought a writ of mandamus, asking the Fifth Circuit to di-\n  rect the District Court to order Paroline to pay restitution. Granting\n  the writ on rehearing en banc, the Fifth Circuit held, inter alia, that\n  §2259 did not limit restitution to losses proximately caused by the de-\n  fendant, and that each defendant who possessed the victim’s images\n  should be made liable for the victim’s entire losses from the trade in\n  her images.\nHeld:\n    1. Restitution is proper under §2259 only to the extent the defend-\n ant’s offense proximately caused a victim’s losses. This provision has\n a broad restitutionary purpose, stating that a district court “shall or-\n der restitution for any offense” under Chapter 110 of Title 18, such as\n Paroline’s possession offense; requiring district courts to order de-\n fendants “to pay the victim . . . the full amount of the victim’s losses\n as determined by the court,” §2259(b)(1); and expressly making “is-\n2                     PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    suance of a restitution order . . . mandatory,” §2259(b)(4)(A). The\n    Government has the “burden of demonstrating the amount of the\n    [victim’s] loss.” §3664(e).\n       To say one event proximately caused another means, first, that the\n    former event caused the latter, i.e., actual cause or cause in fact; and\n    second, that it is a proximate cause, i.e., it has a sufficient connection\n    to the result. The concept of proximate causation is applicable in\n    both criminal and tort law, and the analysis is parallel in many in-\n    stances. Section 2259(c) defines a victim as “the individual harmed\n    as a result of a commission of a crime under this chapter.” The words\n    “as a result of ” plainly suggest causation, and the referent of “a\n    crime” is the offense of conviction. The “full amount of the victim’s\n    losses,” §2259(b)(1), includes “any costs incurred by the victim” for six\n    enumerated categories of expense, §2259(b)(3). The reference to\n    “costs incurred by the victim” is most naturally understood as costs\n    arising “as a result of ” the offense of conviction, i.e., the defendant’s\n    conduct. And the last of the six enumerated categories—for “other\n    losses suffered . . . as a proximate result of the offense,”\n    §2259(b)(3)(F)—clearly states that the causal requirement is one of\n    proximate cause. This reading is supported by the canon of construc-\n    tion that, “[w]hen several words are followed by a clause which is ap-\n    plicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natu-\n    ral construction of the language demands that the clause be read as\n    applicable to all.” Porto Rico Railway, Light & Power Co. v. Mor, 253\n    U. S. 345, 348. The reading also presents a commonsense way to im-\n    pose sensible limitations on claims for attenuated costs. Pp. 5–11.\n       2. Applying the statute’s causation requirements in this case, vic-\n    tims should be compensated and defendants should be held to ac-\n    count for the impact of their conduct on those victims, but defendants\n    should only be made liable for the consequences and gravity of their\n    own conduct, not the conduct of others. Pp. 11–25.\n          (a) A somewhat atypical causal process underlies the losses here.\n    It may be simple to prove aggregate losses, i.e., “general losses,”\n    stemming from the ongoing traffic in the victim’s images, but the\n    question for §2259 purposes is how much of these general losses were\n    the “proximate result” of an individual defendant’s offense. Here, the\n    victim’s costs of treatment and lost income resulting from the trauma\n    of knowing that images of her abuse are being viewed over and over\n    are direct and foreseeable results of child-pornography crimes, pro-\n    vided the prerequisite of factual causation is satisfied. The primary\n    problem, then, is the proper standard of causation in fact. Pp. 11–12.\n          (b) A showing of but-for causation is not the proper standard\n    here, for it is not possible to prove that the victim’s losses would be\n    less but for one possessor’s individual role in the large, loosely con-\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                       3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nnected network through which her images circulate. The victim and\nthe Government urge the Court to read §2259 to require a less re-\nstrictive causation standard in child-pornography cases like this.\nThey endorse the theory of “aggregate causation,” one formulation of\nwhich finds factual causation satisfied where a wrongdoer’s conduct,\nthough alone “insufficient . . . to cause the plaintiff ’s harm,” is, “when\ncombined with conduct by other persons,” “more than sufficient to\ncause the harm.” 1 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical\nand Emotional Harm §27, Comment f. Tort law teaches that such al-\nternative causal tests, though a kind of legal fiction, may be neces-\nsary to vindicate the law’s purposes, for it would be anomalous to\nturn away a person harmed by the combined acts of many wrongdo-\ners simply because none of those wrongdoers alone caused the harm,\nand nonsensical to adopt a rule whereby individuals hurt by the com-\nbined wrongful acts of many would have no redress, while those hurt\nby the acts of one person alone would. These are sound principles.\nTaken too far, however, such alternative causal standards would\ntreat each possessor as the cause in fact of all the trauma and at-\ntendant losses incurred as a result of all the ongoing traffic in the vic-\ntim’s images. Aggregate causation logic should not be adopted in an\nincautious manner in the context of criminal restitution, which dif-\nfers from tort law in numerous respects. Paroline’s contribution to\nthe causal process underlying the victim’s losses was very minor,\nboth compared to the combined acts of all other relevant offenders\nand compared to the contributions of other individual offenders, par-\nticularly distributors and the initial producer of the child pornogra-\nphy. Congress gave no indication that it intended the statute to be\napplied in an expansive manner so starkly contrary to the principle\nthat restitution should reflect the consequences of the defendant’s\nown conduct. The victim claims that holding each possessor liable for\nher entire losses would be fair and practical in part because offenders\ncan seek contribution from one another, but there is no general fed-\neral right to contribution and no specific statutory authorization for\ncontribution here. Her severe approach could also raise questions\nunder the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Pp. 12–\n19.\n     (c) While the victim’s expansive reading must be rejected, that\ndoes not mean the broader principles underlying aggregate causation\ntheories are irrelevant to determining the proper outcome in cases\nlike this. The cause of the victim’s general losses is the trade in her\nimages, and Paroline is a part of that cause. Just as it undermines\nthe purposes of tort law to turn away plaintiffs harmed by several\nwrongdoers, it would undermine §2259’s purposes to turn away vic-\ntims in cases like this. With respect to the statute’s remedial pur-\n4                    PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    pose, there is no question that it would produce anomalous results to\n    say that no restitution is appropriate in these circumstances, for\n    harms of the kind the victim endured here are a major reason why\n    child pornography is outlawed. The unlawful conduct of everyone\n    who reproduces, distributes, or possesses images of the victim’s\n    abuse—including Paroline—plays a part in sustaining and aggravat-\n    ing this tragedy. And there is no doubt Congress wanted restitution\n    for such victims. Denying restitution would also be at odds with\n    §2259’s penological purposes, which include the need to impress upon\n    offenders that their conduct produces concrete and devastating\n    harms for real, identifiable victims. Thus, where it can be shown\n    both that a defendant possessed a victim’s images and that a victim\n    has outstanding losses caused by the continuing traffic in her images\n    but where it is impossible to trace a particular amount of those losses\n    to the individual defendant utilizing a more traditional causal in-\n    quiry, a court should order restitution in an amount that comports\n    with the defendant’s relative role in the causal process underlying\n    the victim’s general losses.\n      District courts should use discretion and sound judgment in deter-\n    mining the proper amount of restitution. A variety of factors may\n    serve as guideposts. Courts might, as a start, determine the amount\n    of the victim’s losses caused by the continuing traffic in the victim’s\n    images, and then base an award on factors bearing on the relative\n    causal significance of the defendant’s conduct in producing those\n    losses. The victim finds this approach untenable because her losses\n    are “indivisible,” but the Court is required to define a causal standard\n    that effects the statute’s purposes, not to apply tort-law concepts in a\n    mechanical way in the criminal restitution context. She also argues\n    she will be consigned to “piecemeal” restitution that may never lead\n    to full recovery, but Congress has not promised victims full and swift\n    restitution at the cost of holding a defendant liable for an amount\n    drastically out of proportion to his individual causal relation to those\n    losses. Furthermore, this approach better effects the need to impress\n    upon defendants that their acts are not irrelevant or victimless.\n    Pp. 19–25.\n         (d) Though this approach is not without difficulties, courts can\n    only do their best to apply the statute as written in a workable man-\n    ner, faithful to the competing principles at stake: that victims should\n    be compensated and that defendants should be held to account for the\n    impact of their own conduct, not the conduct of others. District\n    courts, which routinely exercise wide discretion both in sentencing\n    generally and in fashioning restitution orders, should be able to apply\n    the causal standard defined here without further detailed guidance.\n    P. 25.\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

The relevant statu-\ntory provisions are set forth at 18 U. S. C. §2259. Enacted\nas a component of the Violence Against Women Act of\n1994, §2259 requires district courts to award restitution\nfor certain federal criminal offenses, including child-\npornography possession.\n   Petitioner Doyle Randall Paroline pleaded guilty to such\nan offense. He admitted to possessing between 150 and\n300 images of child pornography, which included two that\ndepicted the sexual exploitation of a young girl, now a\nyoung woman, who goes by the pseudonym “Amy” for this\nlitigation. The question is what causal relationship must\nbe established between the defendant’s conduct and a\nvictim’s losses for purposes of determining the right to,\nand the amount of, restitution under §2259.\n                          I\n  Three decades ago, this Court observed that “the ex-\n2               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nploitive use of children in the production of pornography\nhas become a serious national problem.” New York v.\nFerber, 458 U. S. 747, 749 (1982). The demand for child\npornography harms children in part because it drives\nproduction, which involves child abuse. The harms caused\nby child pornography, however, are still more extensive\nbecause child pornography is “a permanent record” of the\ndepicted child’s abuse, and “the harm to the child is exac-\nerbated by [its] circulation.” Id., at 759. Because child\npornography is now traded with ease on the Internet, “the\nnumber of still images and videos memorializing the\nsexual assault and other sexual exploitation of children,\nmany very young in age, has grown exponentially.” United\nStates Sentencing Comm’n, P. Saris et al., Federal\nChild Pornography Offenses 3 (2012) (hereinafter Sentenc-\ning Comm’n Report).\n  One person whose story illustrates the devastating\nharm caused by child pornography is the respondent\nvictim in this case. When she was eight and nine years\nold, she was sexually abused by her uncle in order to\nproduce child pornography. Her uncle was prosecuted,\nrequired to pay about $6,000 in restitution, and sentenced\nto a lengthy prison term. The victim underwent an initial\ncourse of therapy beginning in 1998 and continuing into\n1999. By the end of this period, her therapist’s notes\nreported that she was “ ‘back to normal’ ”; her involvement\nin dance and other age-appropriate activities, and the\nsupport of her family, justified an optimistic assessment.\nApp. 70–71. Her functioning appeared to decline in her\nteenage years, however; and a major blow to her recovery\ncame when, at the age of 17, she learned that images of\nher abuse were being trafficked on the Internet. Id., at 71.\nThe digital images were available nationwide and no\ndoubt worldwide. Though the exact scale of the trade in\nher images is unknown, the possessors to date easily\nnumber in the thousands. The knowledge that her images\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwere circulated far and wide renewed the victim’s trauma\nand made it difficult for her to recover from her abuse. As\nshe explained in a victim impact statement submitted to\nthe District Court in this case:\n    “Every day of my life I live in constant fear that some-\n    one will see my pictures and recognize me and that I\n    will be humiliated all over again. It hurts me to know\n    someone is looking at them—at me—when I was just\n    a little girl being abused for the camera. I did not\n    choose to be there, but now I am there forever in pic-\n    tures that people are using to do sick things. I want it\n    all erased. I want it all stopped. But I am powerless\n    to stop it just like I was powerless to stop my un-\n    cle. . . . My life and my feelings are worse now because\n    the crime has never really stopped and will never re-\n    ally stop. . . . It’s like I am being abused over and over\n    and over again.” Id., at 60–61.\nThe victim says in her statement that her fear and trauma\nmake it difficult for her to trust others or to feel that she\nhas control over what happens to her. Id., at 63.\n  The full extent of this victim’s suffering is hard to grasp.\nHer abuser took away her childhood, her self-conception of\nher innocence, and her freedom from the kind of night-\nmares and memories that most others will never know.\nThese crimes were compounded by the distribution of\nimages of her abuser’s horrific acts, which meant the\nwrongs inflicted upon her were in effect repeated; for she\nknew her humiliation and hurt were and would be re-\nnewed into the future as an ever-increasing number of\nwrongdoers witnessed the crimes committed against her.\n  Petitioner Paroline is one of the individuals who pos-\nsessed this victim’s images. In 2009, he pleaded guilty in\nfederal court to one count of possession of material involv-\ning the sexual exploitation of children in violation of 18\nU. S. C. §2252. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2091391\"><a href=\"/txed/bHGt/united-states-v-paroline/\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nParoline admitted to knowing possession of between 150\nand 300 images of child pornography, two of which depicted\nthe respondent victim. Ibid. The victim sought restitution\nunder §2259, asking for close to $3.4 million, consisting\nof nearly $3 million in lost income and about $500,000\nin future treatment and counseling costs. App. 52, 104.\nShe also sought attorney’s fees and costs. 672 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 783. The parties submitted competing expert reports.\nThey stipulated that the victim did not know who Paroline\nwas and that none of her claimed losses flowed from any\nspecific knowledge about him or his offense conduct. Id.,\nat 792, and n. 11; App. 230.\n   After briefing and hearings, the District Court declined\nto award restitution. 672 F. Supp. 2d, at 793. The Dis-\ntrict Court observed that “everyone involved with child\npornography—from the abusers and producers to the end-\nusers and possessors—contribute[s] to [the victim’s] ongo-\ning harm.” Id., at 792. But it concluded that the Govern-\nment had the burden of proving the amount of the victim’s\nlosses “directly produced by Paroline that would not have\noccurred without his possession of her images.” Id., at\n791. The District Court found that, under this standard,\nthe Government had failed to meet its burden of proving\nwhat losses, if any, were proximately caused by Paroline’s\noffense. It thus held that “an award of restitution is not\nappropriate in this case.” Id., at 793.\n   The victim sought a writ of mandamus, asking the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to\ndirect the District Court to order Paroline to pay restitu-\ntion in the amount requested. In re Amy, 591 F. 3d 792,\n793 (2009). The Court of Appeals denied relief. Id., at\n795. The victim sought rehearing. Her rehearing request\nwas granted, as was her petition for a writ of mandamus.\nIn re Amy Unknown, 636 F. 3d 190, 201 (2011).\n   The Fifth Circuit reheard the case en banc along with\nanother case, in which the defendant, Michael Wright, had\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nraised similar issues in appealing an order of restitution\nunder §2259, see United States v. Wright, 639 F. 3d 679,\n681 (2011) (per curiam). As relevant, the Court of Appeals\nset out to determine the level of proof required to award\nrestitution to victims in cases like this. It held that §2259\ndid not limit restitution to losses proximately caused by\nthe defendant, and each defendant who possessed the\nvictim’s images should be made liable for the victim’s\nentire losses from the trade in her images, even though\nother offenders played a role in causing those losses. In re\nAmy Unknown, 701 F. 3d 749, 772–774 (2012) (en banc).\n  Paroline sought review here. Certiorari was granted to\nresolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals over the proper\ncausation inquiry for purposes of determining the entitle-\nment to and amount of restitution under §2259. 570 U. S.\n___ (2013). For the reasons set forth, the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals is vacated.\n                              II\n   Title 18 U. S. C. §2259(a) provides that a district court\n“shall order restitution for any offense” under Chapter 110\nof Title 18, which covers a number of offenses involving\nthe sexual exploitation of children and child pornography\nin particular. Paroline was convicted of knowingly pos-\nsessing child pornography under §2252, a Chapter 110\noffense.\n   Section 2259 states a broad restitutionary purpose: It\nrequires district courts to order defendants “to pay the\nvictim . . . the full amount of the victim’s losses as deter-\nmined by the court,” §2259(b)(1), and expressly states that\n“[t]he issuance of a restitution order under this section is\nmandatory,” §2259(b)(4)(A). Section 2259(b)(2) provides\nthat “[a]n order of restitution under this section shall be\nissued and enforced in accordance with section 3664,”\nwhich in turn provides in relevant part that “[t]he burden\nof demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a\n6               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nvictim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney for\nthe Government,” §3664(e).\n  The threshold question the Court faces is whether §2259\nlimits restitution to those losses proximately caused by the\ndefendant’s offense conduct. The Fifth Circuit held that it\ndoes not, contrary to the holdings of other Courts of Ap-\npeals to have addressed the question. Compare, e.g., 701\nF. 3d, at 752 (no general proximate-cause requirement\napplies under §2259), with United States v.

First, it means the former event caused the\nlatter. This is known as actual cause or cause in fact. The\nconcept of actual cause “is not a metaphysical one but an\nordinary, matter-of-fact inquiry into the existence . . . of a\ncausal relation as laypeople would view it.” 4 F. Harper,\nF. James, & O. Gray, Torts §20.2, p. 100 (3d ed. 2007).\n  Every event has many causes, however, see ibid., and\nonly some of them are proximate, as the law uses that\nterm. So to say that one event was a proximate cause of\nanother means that it was not just any cause, but one with\na sufficient connection to the result. The idea of proximate\ncause, as distinct from actual cause or cause in fact, defies\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

S. 639, 654 (2008), that\ngenerally “refers to the basic requirement that . . . there\nmust be ‘some direct relation between the injury asserted\nand the injurious conduct alleged,’ ” CSX Transp., Inc. v.\nMcBride, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (ROBERTS, C. J., dis-\nsenting) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Holmes v. Securities Inves-\ntor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992)). The\nconcept of proximate causation is applicable in both crimi-\nnal and tort law, and the analysis is parallel in many\ninstances.     1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law\n§6.4(c), p. 471 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter LaFave). Proxi-\nmate cause is often explicated in terms of foreseeability or\nthe scope of the risk created by the predicate conduct.\nSee, e.g., ibid.; 1 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for\nPhysical and Emotional Harm §29, p. 493 (2005) (herein-\nafter Restatement). A requirement of proximate cause\nthus serves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations\nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is so\nattenuated that the consequence is more aptly described\nas mere fortuity. Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517\nU. S. 830, 838–839 (1996).\n   All parties agree §2259 imposes some causation re-\nquirement. The statute defines a victim as “the individual\nharmed as a result of a commission of a crime under this\nchapter.” §2259(c). The words “as a result of ” plainly\nsuggest causation. See Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v.\nValladolid, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 13); see\nalso Burrage v. United States, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014)\n(slip op., at 5). And a straightforward reading of §2259(c)\nindicates that the term “a crime” refers to the offense of\nconviction. Cf. Hughey v. United States, 495 U. S. 411,\n416 (1990). So if the defendant’s offense conduct did not\ncause harm to an individual, that individual is by defini-\ntion not a “victim” entitled to restitution under §2259.\n   As noted above, §2259 requires a court to order restitu-\n8               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion for “the full amount of the victim’s losses,”\n§2259(b)(1), which the statute defines to include “any costs\nincurred by the victim” for six enumerated categories of\nexpense, §2259(b)(3). The reference to “costs incurred by\nthe victim” is most naturally understood as costs stem-\nming from the source that qualifies an individual as a\n“victim” in the first place—namely, ones arising “as a\nresult of ” the offense. Thus, as is typically the case with\ncriminal restitution, §2259 is intended to compensate\nvictims for losses caused by the offense of conviction. See\nid., at 416. This is an important point, for it means the\ncentral concern of the causal inquiry must be the conduct\nof the particular defendant from whom restitution is\nsought.\n   But there is a further question whether restitution\nunder §2259 is limited to losses proximately caused by the\noffense. As noted, a requirement of proximate cause is\nmore restrictive than a requirement of factual cause alone.\nEven if §2259 made no express reference to proximate\ncausation, the Court might well hold that a showing of\nproximate cause was required. Proximate cause is a\nstandard aspect of causation in criminal law and the law\nof torts. See 1 LaFave §6.4(a), at 464–466; W. Keeton, D.\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law\nof Torts §41, p. 263 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and\nKeeton). Given proximate cause’s traditional role in cau-\nsation analysis, this Court has more than once found a\nproximate-cause requirement built into a statute that did\nnot expressly impose one. See Holmes, supra, at 265–268;\nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459\nU. S. 519, 529–536 (1983); see also CSX Transp., Inc.,\nsupra, at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4)\n(“We have applied the standard requirement of proximate\ncause to actions under federal statutes where the text did\nnot expressly provide for it”); Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static\nControl Components, Inc., ante, at 13–14.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Here, however, the interpretive task is easier, for the\nrequirement of proximate cause is in the statute’s text.\nThe statute enumerates six categories of covered losses.\n§2259(b)(3).       These include certain medical services,\n§2259(b)(3)(A); physical and occupational therapy,\n§2259(b)(3)(B); transportation, temporary housing, and\nchild care, §2259(b)(3)(C); lost income, §2259(b)(3)(D);\nattorney’s fees and costs, §2259(b)(3)(E); and a final\ncatchall category for “any other losses suffered by the\nvictim as a proximate result of the offense,” §2259(b)(3)(F).\n   The victim argues that because the “proximate result”\nlanguage appears only in the final, catchall category of\nlosses set forth at §2259(b)(3)(F), the statute has no\nproximate-cause requirement for losses falling within the\nprior enumerated categories. She justifies this reading of\n§2259(b) in part on the grammatical rule of the last ante-\ncedent, “according to which a limiting clause or phrase . . .\nshould ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or\nphrase that it immediately follows.” Barnhart v. Thomas,\n540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). But that rule is “not an absolute\nand can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of mean-\ning.” Ibid. The Court has not applied it in a mechanical\nway where it would require accepting “unlikely premises.”\nUnited States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 425 (2009).\n   Other canons of statutory construction, moreover, work\nagainst the reading the victim suggests. “When several\nwords are followed by a clause which is applicable as much\nto the first and other words as to the last, the natural\nconstruction of the language demands that the clause be\nread as applicable to all.” Porto Rico Railway, Light &\nPower Co. v. Mor, 253 U. S. 345, 348 (1920). Furthermore,\n“[i]t is . . . a familiar canon of statutory construction that\n[catchall] clauses are to be read as bringing within a stat-\nute categories similar in type to those specifically enumer-\nated.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v. Seatrain Lines, Inc.,\n411 U. S. 726, 734 (1973). Here, §2259(b)(3)(F) defines a\n10              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbroad, final category of “other losses suffered . . . as a\nproximate result of the offense.” That category is most\nnaturally understood as a summary of the type of losses\ncovered—i.e., losses suffered as a proximate result of the\noffense.\n   The victim says that if Congress had wanted to limit the\nlosses recoverable under §2259 to those proximately\ncaused by the offense, it could have written the statute the\nsame way it wrote §2327, which provides for restitution to\nvictims of telemarketing fraud. Section 2327, which is\nwritten and structured much like §2259, simply defines\nthe term “full amount of the victim’s losses” as “all losses\nsuffered by the victim as a proximate result of the of-\nfense.” §2327(b)(3). In essence the victim argues that the\nfirst five categories of losses enumerated in §2259(b)(3)\nwould be superfluous if all were governed by a proximate-\ncause requirement. That, however, is unpersuasive. The\nfirst five categories provide guidance to district courts as\nto the specific types of losses Congress thought would\noften be the proximate result of a Chapter 110 offense and\ncould as a general matter be included in an award of\nrestitution.\n   Reading the statute to impose a general proximate-\ncause limitation accords with common sense. As noted\nabove, proximate cause forecloses liability in situations\nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is so\nattenuated that the so-called consequence is more akin to\nmere fortuity. For example, suppose the traumatized\nvictim of a Chapter 110 offender needed therapy and had a\ncar accident on the way to her therapist’s office. The\nresulting medical costs, in a literal sense, would be a\nfactual result of the offense. But it would be strange\nindeed to make a defendant pay restitution for these costs.\nThe victim herself concedes Congress did not intend costs\nlike these to be recoverable under §2259. Brief for Re-\nspondent Amy 45. But she claims that it is unnecessary to\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“read . . . into” §2259 a proximate-cause limitation in order\nto exclude costs of that sort. Ibid. She says the statute\n“contextually and inferentially require[s] a nexus for why”\nthe losses were sustained—i.e., a sufficient connection to\nchild pornography. Id., at 46.\n   The victim may be right that the concept of proximate\ncause is not necessary to impose sensible limitations on\nrestitution for remote consequences. But one very effec-\ntive way, and perhaps the most obvious way, of excluding\ncosts like those arising from the hypothetical car accident\ndescribed above would be to incorporate a proximate-cause\nlimitation into the statute. Congress did so, and for rea-\nsons given above the proximate-cause requirement applies\nto all the losses described in §2259. Restitution is there-\nfore proper under §2259 only to the extent the defendant’s\noffense proximately caused a victim’s losses.\n                            III\n  There remains the difficult question of how to apply the\nstatute’s causation requirements in this case. The prob-\nlem stems from the somewhat atypical causal process\nunderlying the losses the victim claims here. It is perhaps\nsimple enough for the victim to prove the aggregate losses,\nincluding the costs of psychiatric treatment and lost in-\ncome, that stem from the ongoing traffic in her images as\na whole. (Complications may arise in disaggregating\nlosses sustained as a result of the initial physical abuse,\nbut those questions may be set aside for present purposes.)\nThese losses may be called, for convenience’s sake, a vic-\ntim’s “general losses.” The difficulty is in determining the\n“full amount” of those general losses, if any, that are the\nproximate result of the offense conduct of a particular\ndefendant who is one of thousands who have possessed\nand will in the future possess the victim’s images but who\nhas no other connection to the victim.\n  In determining the amount of general losses a defendant\n12              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmust pay under §2259 the ultimate question is how much\nof these losses were the “proximate result,” §2259(b)(3)(F),\nof that individual’s offense. But the most difficult aspect\nof this inquiry concerns the threshold requirement of\ncausation in fact. To be sure, the requirement of proxi-\nmate causation, as distinct from mere causation in fact,\nwould prevent holding any possessor liable for losses\ncaused in only a remote sense. But the victim’s costs of\ntreatment and lost income resulting from the trauma of\nknowing that images of her abuse are being viewed over\nand over are direct and foreseeable results of child-\npornography crimes, including possession, assuming the\nprerequisite of factual causation is satisfied. The primary\nproblem, then, is the proper standard of causation in fact.\n                                A\n  The traditional way to prove that one event was a fac-\ntual cause of another is to show that the latter would not\nhave occurred “but for” the former. This approach is a\nfamiliar part of our legal tradition, see 1 LaFave §6.4(b),\nat 467–468; Prosser and Keeton §41, at 266, and no party\ndisputes that a showing of but-for causation would satisfy\n§2259’s factual-causation requirement. Sometimes that\nshowing could be made with little difficulty. For example,\nbut-for causation could be shown with ease in many cases\ninvolving producers of child pornography, see §2251(a);\nparents who permit their children to be used for child-\npornography production, see §2251(b); individuals who sell\nchildren for such purposes, see §2251A; or the initial\ndistributor of the pornographic images of a child, see\n§2252.\n  In this case, however, a showing of but-for causation\ncannot be made. The District Court found that the Gov-\nernment failed to prove specific losses caused by Paroline\nin a but-for sense and recognized that it would be “incred-\nibly difficult” to do so in a case like this. 672 F. Supp. 2d,\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 791–793. That finding has a solid foundation in the\nrecord, and it is all but unchallenged in this Court. See\nBrief for Respondent Amy 63; Brief for United States 19,\n25. But see Supp. Brief for United States 8–10. From the\nvictim’s perspective, Paroline was just one of thousands of\nanonymous possessors. To be sure, the victim’s precise\ndegree of trauma likely bears a relation to the total num-\nber of offenders; it would probably be less if only 10 rather\nthan thousands had seen her images. But it is not possi-\nble to prove that her losses would be less (and by how\nmuch) but for one possessor’s individual role in the large,\nloosely connected network through which her images\ncirculate. See Sentencing Comm’n Report, at ii, xx. Even\nwithout Paroline’s offense, thousands would have viewed\nand would in the future view the victim’s images, so it\ncannot be shown that her trauma and attendant losses\nwould have been any different but for Paroline’s offense.\nThat is especially so given the parties’ stipulation that the\nvictim had no knowledge of Paroline. See supra, at 4.\n   Recognizing that losses cannot be substantiated under a\nbut-for approach where the defendant is an anonymous\npossessor of images in wide circulation on the Internet,\nthe victim and the Government urge the Court to read\n§2259 to require a less restrictive causation standard, at\nleast in this and similar child-pornography cases. They\nare correct to note that courts have departed from the but-\nfor standard where circumstances warrant, especially\nwhere the combined conduct of multiple wrongdoers pro-\nduces a bad outcome. See Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10) (acknowledging “the undoubted reality that\ncourts have not always required strict but-for causality,\neven where criminal liability is at issue”).\n   The victim and the Government look to the literature on\ncriminal and tort law for alternatives to the but-for test.\nThe Court has noted that the “most common” exception to\nthe but-for causation requirement is applied where “mul-\n14              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntiple sufficient causes independently . . . produce a result,”\nibid.; see also 1 LaFave §6.4(b), at 467–469; 1 Restatement\n§27, at 376. This exception is an ill fit here, as all parties\nseem to recognize. Paroline’s possession of two images of\nthe victim was surely not sufficient to cause her entire\nlosses from the ongoing trade in her images. Nor is there\na practical way to isolate some subset of the victim’s gen-\neral losses that Paroline’s conduct alone would have been\nsufficient to cause. See Brief for United States 26, n. 11.\n   Understandably, the victim and the Government thus\nconcentrate on a handful of less demanding causation\ntests endorsed by authorities on tort law. One prominent\ntreatise suggests that “[w]hen the conduct of two or more\nactors is so related to an event that their combined con-\nduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event,\nand application of the but-for rule to them individually\nwould absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in\nfact of the event.” Prosser and Keeton §41, at 268. The\nRestatement adopts a similar exception for “[m]ultiple\nsufficient causal sets.” 1 Restatement §27, Comment f, at\n380–381. This is where a wrongdoer’s conduct, though\nalone “insufficient . . . to cause the plaintiff ’s harm,” is,\n“when combined with conduct by other persons,” “more\nthan sufficient to cause the harm.” Ibid. The Restate-\nment offers as an example a case in which three people\nindependently but simultaneously lean on a car, creating\nenough combined force to roll it off a cliff. Ibid. Even if\neach exerted too little force to move the car, and the force\nexerted by any two was sufficient to the move the car, each\nindividual is a factual cause of the car’s destruction. Ibid.\nThe Government argues that these authorities “provide\nample support for an ‘aggregate’ causation theory,” Brief\nfor United States 18, and that such a theory would best\neffectuate congressional intent in cases like this, id., at\n18–19. The victim says much the same. Brief for Re-\nspondent Amy 42–43.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  These alternative causal tests are a kind of legal fiction\nor construct. If the conduct of a wrongdoer is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient to produce an outcome, that con-\nduct cannot in a strict sense be said to have caused the\noutcome. Nonetheless, tort law teaches that alternative\nand less demanding causal standards are necessary in\ncertain circumstances to vindicate the law’s purposes. It\nwould be anomalous to turn away a person harmed by the\ncombined acts of many wrongdoers simply because none of\nthose wrongdoers alone caused the harm. And it would be\nnonsensical to adopt a rule whereby individuals hurt by\nthe combined wrongful acts of many (and thus in many\ninstances hurt more badly than otherwise) would have\nno redress, whereas individuals hurt by the acts of one\nperson alone would have a remedy. Those are the prin-\nciples that underlie the various aggregate causation tests\nthe victim and the Government cite, and they are sound\nprinciples.\n  These alternative causal standards, though salutary\nwhen applied in a judicious manner, also can be taken too\nfar. That is illustrated by the victim’s suggested approach\nto applying §2259 in cases like this. The victim says that\nunder the strict logic of these alternative causal tests,\neach possessor of her images is a part of a causal set suffi-\ncient to produce her ongoing trauma, so each possessor\nshould be treated as a cause in fact of all the trauma and\nall the attendant losses incurred as a result of the entire\nongoing traffic in her images. Id., at 43. And she argues\nthat if this premise is accepted the further requirement of\nproximate causation poses no barrier, for she seeks resti-\ntution only for those losses that are the direct and foresee-\nable result of child-pornography offenses. Because the\nstatute requires restitution for the “full amount of the\nvictim’s losses,” including “any . . . losses suffered by the\nvictim as a proximate result of the offense,” §2259(b), she\nargues that restitution is required for the entire aggre-\n16              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngately caused amount.\n   The striking outcome of this reasoning—that each pos-\nsessor of the victim’s images would bear the consequences\nof the acts of the many thousands who possessed those\nimages—illustrates why the Court has been reluctant to\nadopt aggregate causation logic in an incautious manner,\nespecially in interpreting criminal statutes where there is\nno language expressly suggesting Congress intended that\napproach. See Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11–\n12). Even if one were to refer just to the law of torts, it\nwould be a major step to say there is a sufficient causal\nlink between the injury and the wrong so that all the\nvictim’s general losses were “suffered . . . as a proximate\nresult of [Paroline’s] offense,” §2259(b)(3)(F).\n   And there is special reason not to do so in the context of\ncriminal restitution. Aside from the manifest procedural\ndifferences between criminal sentencing and civil tort\nlawsuits, restitution serves purposes that differ from\n(though they overlap with) the purposes of tort law. See,\ne.g., Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 49, n. 10 (1986) (not-\ning that restitution is, inter alia, “an effective rehabilita-\ntive penalty”). Legal fictions developed in the law of torts\ncannot be imported into criminal restitution and applied\nto their utmost limits without due consideration of these\ndifferences.\n   Contrary to the victim’s suggestion, this is not akin to a\ncase in which a “gang of ruffians” collectively beats a\nperson, or in which a woman is “gang raped by five men on\none night or by five men on five sequential nights.” Brief\nfor Respondent Amy 55. First, this case does not involve a\nset of wrongdoers acting in concert, see Prosser and Keeton\n§52, at 346 (discussing full liability for a joint enter-\nprise); for Paroline had no contact with the overwhelming\nmajority of the offenders for whose actions the victim\nwould hold him accountable. Second, adopting the victim’s\napproach would make an individual possessor liable for\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe combined consequences of the acts of not just 2, 5, or\neven 100 independently acting offenders; but instead, a\nnumber that may reach into the tens of thousands. See\nBrief for Respondent Amy 65.\n  It is unclear whether it could ever be sensible to em-\nbrace the fiction that this victim’s entire losses were the\n“proximate result,” §2259(b)(3)(F), of a single possessor’s\noffense. Paroline’s contribution to the causal process\nunderlying the victim’s losses was very minor, both com-\npared to the combined acts of all other relevant offenders,\nand in comparison to the contributions of other individual\noffenders, particularly distributors (who may have caused\nhundreds or thousands of further viewings) and the initial\nproducer of the child pornography. See 1 Restatement\n§36, and Comment a, at 597–598 (recognizing a rule ex-\ncluding from liability individuals whose contribution to a\ncausal set that factually caused the outcome “pales by\ncomparison to the other contributions to that causal set”).\nBut see id., §27, Reporters’ Note, Comment i, at 395 (“The\nconclusion that none of ” two dozen small contributions to\na sufficient causal set was a cause of the outcome “is obvi-\nously untenable”). Congress gave no indication that it\nintended its statute to be applied in the expansive manner\nthe victim suggests, a manner contrary to the bedrock\nprinciple that restitution should reflect the consequences\nof the defendant’s own conduct, see Hughey, 495 U. S., at\n416, not the conduct of thousands of geographically and\ntemporally distant offenders acting independently, and\nwith whom the defendant had no contact.\n  The victim argues that holding each possessor liable for\nher entire losses would be fair and practical, in part be-\ncause offenders may seek contribution from one another.\nBrief for Respondent Amy 58. If that were so, it might\nmitigate to some degree the concerns her approach pre-\nsents.

There is\nno general federal right to contribution. Northwest Air-\nlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U. S. 77, 96–97\n(1981). Nor does the victim point to any clear statutory\nbasis for a right to contribution in these circumstances.\nShe thus suggests that this Court should imply a cause of\naction. Brief for Respondent Amy 58. But that is a rare\nstep in any circumstance. See, e.g., Stoneridge Investment\nPartners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148,\n164–165 (2008); Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers\nIns. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 291 (1993) (noting that this\nCourt’s precedents “teach that the creation of new rights\nought to be left to legislatures, not courts”). And it would\ndo little to address the practical problems offenders would\nface in seeking contribution in any event, see Brief for\nUnited States 45–46, problems with which the victim fails\nto grapple.\n   The reality is that the victim’s suggested approach\nwould amount to holding each possessor of her images\nliable for the conduct of thousands of other independently\nacting possessors and distributors, with no legal or practi-\ncal avenue for seeking contribution. That approach is so\nsevere it might raise questions under the Excessive Fines\nClause of the Eighth Amendment. To be sure, this Court\nhas said that “the Excessive Fines Clause was intended to\nlimit only those fines directly imposed by, and payable to,\nthe government.” Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc.\nv. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 268 (1989). But\nwhile restitution under §2259 is paid to a victim, it is\nimposed by the Government “at the culmination of a crim-\ninal proceeding and requires conviction of an underlying”\ncrime, United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 328\n(1998). Thus, despite the differences between restitution\nand a traditional fine, restitution still implicates “the\nprosecutorial powers of government,” Browning-Ferris,\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Bajakajian, supra, at 329, but it also\nserves punitive purposes, see Pasquantino v. United\nStates, 544 U. S. 349, 365 (2005) (“The purpose of award-\ning restitution” under 18 U. S. C. §3663A “is . . . to mete\nout appropriate criminal punishment”); Kelly, 479 U. S., at\n49, n. 10. That may be “sufficient to bring [it] within the\npurview of the Excessive Fines Clause,” Bajakajian, su-\npra, at 329, n. 4. And there is a real question whether\nholding a single possessor liable for millions of dollars in\nlosses collectively caused by thousands of independent\nactors might be excessive and disproportionate in these\ncircumstances. These concerns offer further reason not to\ninterpret the statute the way the victim suggests.\n                              B\n  The contention that the victim’s entire losses from the\nongoing trade in her images were “suffered . . . as a proxi-\nmate result” of Paroline’s offense for purposes of §2259\nmust be rejected. But that does not mean the broader\nprinciples underlying the aggregate causation theories the\nGovernment and the victim cite are irrelevant to deter-\nmining the proper outcome in cases like this. The cause of\nthe victim’s general losses is the trade in her images. And\nParoline is a part of that cause, for he is one of those who\nviewed her images. While it is not possible to identify a\ndiscrete, readily definable incremental loss he caused, it is\nindisputable that he was a part of the overall phenomenon\nthat caused her general losses. Just as it undermines the\npurposes of tort law to turn away plaintiffs harmed by\nseveral wrongdoers, it would undermine the remedial and\npenological purposes of §2259 to turn away victims in\ncases like this.\n  With respect to the statute’s remedial purpose, there\ncan be no question that it would produce anomalous re-\nsults to say that no restitution is appropriate in these\n20             PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncircumstances. It is common ground that the victim suf-\nfers continuing and grievous harm as a result of her\nknowledge that a large, indeterminate number of individ-\nuals have viewed and will in the future view images of the\nsexual abuse she endured. Brief for Petitioner 50; Brief\nfor Respondent Wright 4; Brief for United States 23; Brief\nfor Respondent Amy 60. Harms of this sort are a major\nreason why child pornography is outlawed. See Ferber,\n458 U. S., at 759. The unlawful conduct of everyone who\nreproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of the\nvictim’s abuse—including Paroline—plays a part in sus-\ntaining and aggravating this tragedy. And there can be no\ndoubt Congress wanted victims to receive restitution for\nharms like this. The law makes restitution “mandatory,”\n§2259(b)(4), for child-pornography offenses under Chapter\n110, language that indicates Congress’ clear intent that\nvictims of child pornography be compensated by the perpe-\ntrators who contributed to their anguish. It would un-\ndermine this intent to apply the statute in a way that\nwould render it a dead letter in child-pornography prose-\ncutions of this type.\n   Denying restitution in cases like this would also be at\nodds with the penological purposes of §2259’s mandatory\nrestitution scheme. In a sense, every viewing of child\npornography is a repetition of the victim’s abuse. One\nreason to make restitution mandatory for crimes like this\nis to impress upon offenders that their conduct produces\nconcrete and devastating harms for real, identifiable\nvictims. See Kelly, supra, at 49, n. 10 (“Restitution is an\neffective rehabilitative penalty because it forces the de-\nfendant to confront, in concrete terms, the harm his ac-\ntions have caused”). It would be inconsistent with this\npurpose to apply the statute in a way that leaves offenders\nwith the mistaken impression that child-pornography\npossession (at least where the images are in wide circula-\ntion) is a victimless crime.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   If the statute by its terms required a showing of strict\nbut-for causation, these purposes would be beside the\npoint. But the text of the statute is not so limited. Al-\nthough Congress limited restitution to losses that are the\n“proximate result” of the defendant’s offense, such unelab-\norated causal language by no means requires but-for\ncausation by its terms. See Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 8) (courts need not read phrases like “results from”\nto require but-for causality where there is “textual or\ncontextual” reason to conclude otherwise). As the authori-\nties the Government and the victim cite show, the availa-\nbility of alternative causal standards where circumstances\nwarrant is, no less than the but-for test itself as a default,\npart of the background legal tradition against which Con-\ngress has legislated, cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). It\nwould be unacceptable to adopt a causal standard so strict\nthat it would undermine congressional intent where nei-\nther the plain text of the statute nor legal tradition de-\nmands such an approach.\n   In this special context, where it can be shown both that\na defendant possessed a victim’s images and that a victim\nhas outstanding losses caused by the continuing traffic in\nthose images but where it is impossible to trace a particu-\nlar amount of those losses to the individual defendant by\nrecourse to a more traditional causal inquiry, a court\napplying §2259 should order restitution in an amount that\ncomports with the defendant’s relative role in the causal\nprocess that underlies the victim’s general losses. The\namount would not be severe in a case like this, given the\nnature of the causal connection between the conduct of a\npossessor like Paroline and the entirety of the victim’s\ngeneral losses from the trade in her images, which are the\nproduct of the acts of thousands of offenders. It would not,\nhowever, be a token or nominal amount. The required\nrestitution would be a reasonable and circumscribed\naward imposed in recognition of the indisputable role of\n22              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe offender in the causal process underlying the victim’s\nlosses and suited to the relative size of that causal role.\nThis would serve the twin goals of helping the victim\nachieve eventual restitution for all her child-pornography\nlosses and impressing upon offenders the fact that child-\npornography crimes, even simple possession, affect real\nvictims.\n   There remains the question of how district courts should\ngo about determining the proper amount of restitution. At\na general level of abstraction, a court must assess as best\nit can from available evidence the significance of the indi-\nvidual defendant’s conduct in light of the broader causal\nprocess that produced the victim’s losses. This cannot be a\nprecise mathematical inquiry and involves the use of\ndiscretion and sound judgment. But that is neither unu-\nsual nor novel, either in the wider context of criminal\nsentencing or in the more specific domain of restitution. It\nis well recognized that district courts by necessity “exer-\ncise . . . discretion in fashioning a restitution order.”\n§3664(a). Indeed, a district court is expressly authorized\nto conduct a similar inquiry where multiple defendants\nwho have “contributed to the loss of a victim” appear\nbefore it. §3664(h). In that case it may “apportion liabil-\nity among the defendants to reflect the level of contribu-\ntion to the victim’s loss . . . of each defendant.” Ibid.\nAssessing an individual defendant’s role in the causal\nprocess behind a child-pornography victim’s losses does\nnot involve a substantially different or greater exercise of\ndiscretion.\n   There are a variety of factors district courts might con-\nsider in determining a proper amount of restitution, and it\nis neither necessary nor appropriate to prescribe a precise\nalgorithm for determining the proper restitution amount\nat this point in the law’s development. Doing so would\nunduly constrain the decisionmakers closest to the facts of\nany given case. But district courts might, as a starting\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npoint, determine the amount of the victim’s losses caused\nby the continuing traffic in the victim’s images (excluding,\nof course, any remote losses like the hypothetical car\naccident described above, see supra, at 10), then set an\naward of restitution in consideration of factors that bear\non the relative causal significance of the defendant’s con-\nduct in producing those losses. These could include the\nnumber of past criminal defendants found to have con-\ntributed to the victim’s general losses; reasonable predic-\ntions of the number of future offenders likely to be caught\nand convicted for crimes contributing to the victim’s gen-\neral losses; any available and reasonably reliable estimate\nof the broader number of offenders involved (most of whom\nwill, of course, never be caught or convicted); whether the\ndefendant reproduced or distributed images of the victim;\nwhether the defendant had any connection to the initial\nproduction of the images; how many images of the victim\nthe defendant possessed; and other facts relevant to the\ndefendant’s relative causal role. See Brief for United\nStates 49.\n   These factors need not be converted into a rigid formula,\nespecially if doing so would result in trivial restitution\norders. They should rather serve as rough guideposts for\ndetermining an amount that fits the offense. The result-\ning amount fixed by the court would be deemed the\namount of the victim’s general losses that were the “prox-\nimate result of the offense” for purposes of §2259, and thus\nthe “full amount” of such losses that should be awarded.\nThe court could then set an appropriate payment schedule\nin consideration of the defendant’s financial means. See\n§3664(f)(2).\n   The victim says this approach is untenable because her\nlosses are “indivisible” in the sense that term is used by\ntort law, i.e., that there is no “reasonable basis for the\nfactfinder to determine . . . the amount of damages sepa-\nrately caused by” any one offender’s conduct. Restatement\n24              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability §26, p. 320\n(1999). The premise of her argument is that because it is\nin a sense a fiction to say Paroline caused $1,000 in losses,\n$10,000 in losses, or any other lesser amount, it is neces-\nsary to embrace the much greater fiction that Paroline\ncaused all the victim’s losses from the ongoing trade in her\nimages. But that is a non sequitur. The Court is required\nto define a causal standard that effects the statute’s pur-\nposes, not to apply tort-law concepts in a mechanical way\nin the criminal restitution context. Even if the victim’s\nlosses are fully “indivisible” in this sense (which is debata-\nble), treating Paroline as a proximate cause of all the\nvictim’s losses—especially in the absence of a workable\nsystem of contribution—stretches the fiction of aggregate\ncausation to its breaking point. Treating him as a cause of\na smaller amount of the victim’s general losses, taking\naccount of his role in the overall causal process behind\nthose losses, effects the statute’s purposes; avoids the\nnonsensical result of turning away victims emptyhanded;\nand does so without sacrificing the need for proportional-\nity in sentencing.\n   The victim also argues that this approach would consign\nher to “piecemeal” restitution and leave her to face “dec-\nades of litigation that might never lead to full recovery,”\nBrief for Respondent Amy 57, which “would convert Con-\ngress’s promise to child pornography victims into an empty\ngesture,” id., at 66. But Congress has not promised\nvictims full and swift restitution at all costs. To be sure,\nthe statute states a strong restitutionary purpose; but that\npurpose cannot be twisted into a license to hold a defend-\nant liable for an amount drastically out of proportion to\nhis own individual causal relation to the victim’s losses.\n   Furthermore, an approach of this sort better effects the\nneed to impress upon defendants that their acts are not\nirrelevant or victimless. As the Government observes,\nReply Brief for United States 18, it would undermine this\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimportant purpose of criminal restitution if the victim\nsimply collected her full losses from a handful of wealthy\npossessors and left the remainder to pay nothing because\nshe had already fully collected. Of course the victim\nshould someday collect restitution for all her child-\npornography losses, but it makes sense to spread payment\namong a larger number of offenders in amounts more\nclosely in proportion to their respective causal roles and\ntheir own circumstances so that more are made aware,\nthrough the concrete mechanism of restitution, of the\nimpact of child-pornography possession on victims.\n                             C\n   This approach is not without its difficulties. Restitution\norders should represent “an application of law,” not “a\ndecisionmaker’s caprice,” Philip Morris USA v. Williams,\n549 U. S. 346, 352 (2007) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted), and the approach articulated above involves discre-\ntion and estimation. But courts can only do their best to\napply the statute as written in a workable manner, faith-\nful to the competing principles at stake: that victims\nshould be compensated and that defendants should be\nheld to account for the impact of their conduct on those\nvictims, but also that defendants should be made liable for\nthe consequences and gravity of their own conduct, not the\nconduct of others. District courts routinely exercise wide\ndiscretion both in sentencing as a general matter and\nmore specifically in fashioning restitution orders. There is\nno reason to believe they cannot apply the causal standard\ndefined above in a reasonable manner without further\ndetailed guidance at this stage in the law’s elaboration.\nBased on its experience in prior cases of this kind, the\nGovernment—which, as noted above, see supra, at 5–6,\nbears the burden of proving the amount of the victim’s\nlosses, §3664(e)—could also inform district courts of resti-\ntution sought and ordered in other cases.\n26              PAROLINE v.

Unfortunately, the restitution statute that\nCongress wrote for child pornography offenses makes it\nimpossible to award that relief to Amy in this case. In-\nstead of tailoring the statute to the unique harms caused\nby child pornography, Congress borrowed a generic resti-\ntution standard that makes restitution contingent on the\nGovernment’s ability to prove, “by the preponderance of\nthe evidence,” “the amount of the loss sustained by a\nvictim as a result of ” the defendant’s crime. 18 U. S. C.\n§3664(e). When it comes to Paroline’s crime—possession\nof two of Amy’s images—it is not possible to do anything\nmore than pick an arbitrary number for that “amount.”\nAnd arbitrary is not good enough for the criminal law.\n   The Court attempts to design a more coherent restitu-\ntion system, focusing on “the defendant’s relative role in\nthe causal process that underlies the victim’s general\nlosses.” Ante, at 21. But this inquiry, sensible as it may\nbe, is not the one Congress adopted. After undertaking\nthe inquiry that Congress did require, the District Court\nin this case concluded that the Government could not meet\n2               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nits statutory burden of proof. Before this Court, the Gov-\nernment all but concedes the point. See Brief for United\nStates 25 (“it is practically impossible to know whether\n[Amy’s] losses would have been slightly lower if one were\nto subtract one defendant, or ten, or fifty”). I must regret-\nfully dissent.\n                               I\n   Section 2259(a) of Title 18 directs that a district court\n“shall order restitution for any offense under this chapter,”\nwhich includes Paroline’s offense of knowingly possessing\nchild pornography in violation of section 2252. In case\nCongress’s purpose were not clear from its use of “shall,”\nsection 2259(b)(4) then emphasizes that “[t]he issuance of\na restitution order under this section is mandatory.”\n   Section 2259(b)(1) spells out who may receive restitu-\ntion, and for what. It provides that “[t]he order of restitu-\ntion under this section shall direct the defendant to pay\nthe victim (through the appropriate court mechanism) the\nfull amount of the victim’s losses as determined by the\ncourt pursuant to [section 2259(b)(2)].” The term “ ‘vic-\ntim’ ” is defined as “the individual harmed as a result of a\ncommission of a crime under this chapter.” §2259(c). And\nthe term “ ‘full amount of the victim’s losses’ includes any\ncosts incurred by the victim for . . . medical services relat-\ning to physical, psychiatric, or psychological care”; “lost\nincome”; and “any other losses suffered by the victim as a\nproximate result of the offense.” §§2259(b)(3)(A), (D), (F).\n   Section 2259(b)(2) then describes how the district court\nmust calculate restitution. It provides that “[a]n order of\nrestitution under this section shall be issued and enforced\nin accordance with section 3664 in the same manner as an\norder under section 3663A.” Unlike section 2259, sections\n3663A and 3664 were not designed specifically for child\npornography offenses; they are part of the Mandatory\nVictims Restitution Act of 1996 and supply general resti-\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Most relevant\nhere, section 3664(e) provides that “[a]ny dispute as to the\nproper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by\nthe court by the preponderance of the evidence. The bur-\nden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by\na victim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney\nfor the Government.”\n                              A\n  As the Court explains, the statute allows restitution\nonly for those losses that were the “proximate result” of\nParoline’s offense. See ante, at 9–11 (citing §2259(b)(3)).\nContrary to Paroline’s argument, the proximate cause re-\nquirement is easily satisfied in this case. It was readily\nforeseeable that Paroline’s crime could cause Amy to\nsuffer precisely the types of losses that she claims: future\nlost wages, costs for treatment and counseling, and attor-\nney’s fees and costs, all of which are eligible losses enu-\nmerated in section 2259(b)(3). There is a “direct relation”\nbetween those types of injuries and Paroline’s “injurious\nconduct.” Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corpo-\nration, 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992). I therefore agree with\nthe Court that if Paroline actually caused those losses, he\nalso proximately caused them. See ante, at 12.\n  The more pressing problem is the statutory requirement\nof actual causation. See Burrage v. United States, 571\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6) (the ordinary meaning\nof the term “results from” requires proof that the defend-\nant’s conduct was the “actual cause” of the injury). Here\ntoo the Court correctly holds that the statute precludes the\nrestitution award sought by Amy and preferred by\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent, which would hold Paroline\nresponsible for Amy’s entire loss. See ante, at 16–19;\ncontra, post, at 7–16. Congress has authorized restitution\nonly for “the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a\nresult of the offense.” §3664(e). We have interpreted\n4                  PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nvirtually identical language, in the predecessor statute to\nsection 3664, to require “restitution to be tied to the loss\ncaused by the offense of conviction.” Hughey v. United\nStates, 495 U. S. 411, 418 (1990) (citing 18 U. S. C.\n§3580(a) (1982 ed.); emphasis added). That is, restitution\nmay not be imposed for losses caused by any other crime\nor any other defendant.1\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent dismisses section 3664(e),\nwhich is Congress’s direct answer to the very question\npresented by this case, namely, how to resolve a “dispute\nas to the proper amount . . . of restitution.” JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR thinks the answer to that question begins and\nends with the statement in section 2259(b)(1) that the\ndefendant must pay “the full amount of the victim’s losses.”\nSee post, at 1, 2, 10, 15. But losses from what? The\nanswer is found in the rest of that sentence: “the full\namount of the victim’s losses as determined by the court\npursuant to paragraph 2.” §2259(b)(1) (emphasis added).\n“[P]aragraph 2,” of course, instructs that “[a]n order of\nrestitution under this section shall be issued and enforced\nin accordance with section 3664 in the same manner as an\norder under section 3663A.” §2259(b)(2). And it is section\n3664 that provides the statute’s burden of proof and speci-\nfies that the defendant pay for those losses sustained “as a\nresult of the offense”—that is, his offense. §3664(e).\n   The offense of conviction here was Paroline’s possession\nof two of Amy’s images. No one suggests Paroline’s crime\n\n——————\n  1 In a case “where the loss is the product of the combined conduct of\n\nmultiple offenders,” post, at 7 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting), section\n3664(h) provides that a court may “make each defendant liable for\npayment of the full amount of restitution or may apportion liability\namong the defendants to reflect the level of contribution to the victim’s\nloss and economic circumstances of each defendant.” As the Court\nnotes, however, this provision applies only when multiple defendants\nare sentenced in the same proceeding, or charged under the same\nindictment.

Determining what amount the\nstatute does allow—the amount of Amy’s losses that Paro-\nline’s offense caused—is the real difficulty of this case.\nSee ante, at 12.\n                                B\n   Regrettably, Congress provided no mechanism for an-\nswering that question. If actual causation is to be deter-\nmined using the traditional, but-for standard, then the\nCourt acknowledges that “a showing of but-for causation\ncannot be made” in this case. Ante, at 12. Amy would\nhave incurred all of her lost wages and counseling costs\neven if Paroline had not viewed her images. The Govern-\nment and Amy respond by offering an “aggregate” causa-\ntion theory borrowed from tort law. But even if we apply\nthis “legal fiction,” ante, at 15, and assume, for purposes of\nargument, that Paroline’s crime contributed something to\nAmy’s total losses, that suffices only to establish causation\nin fact. It is not sufficient to award restitution under the\nstatute, which requires a further determination of the\namount that Paroline must pay. He must pay “the full\namount of the victim’s losses,” yes, but “as determined by”\nsection 3664—that is, the full amount of the losses he\ncaused. The Government has the burden to establish that\namount, and no one has suggested a plausible means for\nthe Government to carry that burden.2\n   The problem stems from the nature of Amy’s injury. As\nexplained, section 3664 is a general statute designed to\nprovide restitution for more common crimes, such as fraud\nand assault. The section 3664(e) standard will work just\n——————\n  2 The correct amount is not the one favored by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s\ndissent, which would hold Paroline liable for losses that he certainly\ndid not cause, without any right to seek contribution from others who\nharmed Amy.\n6                  PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfine for most crime victims, because it will usually not be\ndifficult to identify the harm caused by the defendant’s\noffense. The dispute will usually just be over the amount\nof the victim’s loss—for example, the value of lost assets or\nthe cost of a night in the hospital.\n   Amy has a qualitatively different injury. Her loss, while\nundoubtedly genuine, is a result of the collective actions of\na huge number of people—beginning with her uncle who\nabused her and put her images on the Internet, to the\ndistributors who make those images more widely avail-\nable, to the possessors such as Paroline who view her im-\nages. The harm to Amy was produced over time, gradually,\nby tens of thousands of persons acting independently from\none another.3       She suffers in particular from her\nknowledge that her images are being viewed online by an\nunknown number of people, and from her fear that any\nperson she meets might recognize her from having wit-\nnessed her abuse. App. 59–66. But Amy does not know\nwho Paroline is. Id., at 295, n. 11. Nothing in the record\ncomes close to establishing that Amy would have suffered\nless if Paroline had not possessed her images, let alone\nhow much less. See Brief for United States 25. Amy’s\ninjury is indivisible, which means that Paroline’s particu-\nlar share of her losses is unknowable. And yet it is proof\nof Paroline’s particular share that the statute requires.\n   By simply importing the generic restitution statute\nwithout accounting for the diffuse harm suffered by vic-\ntims of child pornography, Congress set up a restitution\nsystem sure to fail in cases like this one.

But that is not a workable guide, not\nleast because courts have taken vastly different approaches\nto materially indistinguishable cases.

Even if that were a plausible way to design a resti-\ntution system for Amy’s complex injury, there is no way\naround the fact that it is not the system that Congress\ncreated. The statute requires restitution to be based\nexclusively on the losses that resulted from the defendant’s\ncrime—not on the defendant’s relative culpability. The\nmajority’s plan to situate Paroline along a spectrum of\noffenders who have contributed to Amy’s harm will not\nassist a district court in calculating the amount of Amy’s\nlosses—the amount of her lost wages and counseling\ncosts—that was caused by Paroline’s crime (or that of any\nother defendant).\n   The Court is correct, of course, that awarding Amy no\nrestitution would be contrary to Congress’s remedial and\npenological purposes.

But we have previ-\nously refused to allow “policy considerations”—including\nan “expansive declaration of purpose,” and the need to\n“compensate victims for the full losses they suffered”—to\ndeter us from reading virtually identical statutory lan-\nguage to require proof of the harm caused solely by the\ndefendant’s particular offense.

Ante, at 23. In the first\nplace, only the last figure is relevant, because Paroline’s\nrelative significance can logically be measured only in\nlight of everyone who contributed to Amy’s injury—not\njust those who have been, or will be, caught and convicted.\nEven worse, to the extent it is possible to project the total\nnumber of persons who have viewed Amy’s images, that\nnumber is tragically large, which means that restitution\nawards tied to it will lead to a pitiful recovery in every\ncase. See Brief for Respondent Amy 65 (estimating Paro-\nline’s “ ‘market share’ ” of Amy’s harm at 1/71,000, or $47).\nThe majority says that courts should not impose “trivial\nrestitution orders,” ante, at 23, but it is hard to see how a\ncourt fairly assessing this defendant’s relative contribu-\ntion could do anything else.\n   Nor can confidence in judicial discretion save the statute\nfrom arbitrary application.

New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 758\n(1982). The traffic in images depicting a child’s sexual\nabuse, we have observed, “ ‘poses an even greater threat to\nthe child victim than does sexual abuse or prostitution’ ”\nbecause the victim must “ ‘go through life knowing that the\nrecording is circulating within the mass distribution sys-\ntem for child pornography.’ ” Id., at 759, n. 10. As we\nemphasized in a later case, the images cause “continuing\nharm by haunting the chil[d] in years to come.” Osborne v.\nOhio, 495 U. S. 103, 111 (1990).\n  Congress enacted 18 U. S. C. §2259 against this back-\ndrop. The statute imposes a “mandatory” duty on courts\nto order restitution to victims of federal offenses involving\nthe sexual abuse of children, including the possession of\nchild pornography. §2259(b)(4). And it commands that for\nany such offense, a court “shall direct the defendant to pay\nthe victim . . . the full amount of the victim’s losses.”\n§2259(b)(1).\n  The Court interprets this statute to require restitution\nin a “circumscribed” amount less than the “entirety of the\nvictim’s . . . losses,” a total it instructs courts to estimate\nbased on the defendant’s “relative role” in the victim’s\n2               PAROLINE v.

That amount, the Court holds, should\nbe neither “nominal” nor “severe.” Ibid.\n   I appreciate the Court’s effort to achieve what it per-\nceives to be a just result. It declines to require restitution\nfor a victim’s full losses, a result that might seem incon-\ngruent to an individual possessor’s partial role in a harm\nin which countless others have participated. And it rejects\nthe position advanced by Paroline and the dissenting\nopinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, which would result in no\nrestitution in cases like this for the perverse reason that a\nchild has been victimized by too many.\n   The Court’s approach, however, cannot be reconciled\nwith the law that Congress enacted. Congress mandated\nrestitution for the “full amount of the victim’s losses,”\n§2259(b)(1), and did so within the framework of settled\ntort law principles that treat defendants like Paroline\njointly and severally liable for the indivisible consequences\nof their intentional, concerted conduct. And to the extent\nan award for the full amount of a victim’s losses may lead\nto fears of unfair treatment for particular defendants,\nCongress provided a mechanism to accommodate those\nconcerns: Courts are to order “partial payments” on a\nperiodic schedule if the defendant’s financial circumstances\nor other “interest[s] of justice” so require. §§3664(f )(3),\n3572(d)(1). I would accordingly affirm the Fifth Circuit’s\nholding that the District Court “must enter a restitution\norder reflecting the ‘full amount of [Amy’s] losses,’ ” In re\nAmy Unknown, 701 F. 3d 749, 774 (2012), and instruct the\ncourt to consider a periodic payment schedule on remand.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  There are two distinct but related questions in this case:\nFirst, whether Paroline’s conduct bears a sufficient causal\nnexus to Amy’s harm, and second, if such a nexus exists,\nhow much restitution Paroline should be required to pay.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

J., dissenting). The\nreal issue, then, is “the proper standard of causation in\nfact.” Ante, at 12 (majority opinion).\n   The majority and I share common ground on much of\nthis issue. We agree that the ordinary way to prove cause-\nin-fact is to show that a result would not have occurred\n“but for” the defendant’s conduct. Burrage v. United\nStates, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6). We also\nagree that “ ‘strict but-for causality’ ” is “ ‘not always re-\nquired,’ ” and that alternative standards of factual causa-\ntion are appropriate “where there is ‘textual or contextual’\nreason to conclude” as much. Ante, at 13, 21 (quoting\nBurrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8, 10). And most\nimportantly, we agree that there are ample reasons to\nreject a strict but-for causality requirement in §2259. See\nante, at 21.\n   Starting with the text, §2259 declares that a court “shall\norder restitution for any offense under this chapter.” The\npossession of child pornography, §2252, is an offense\nunder the relevant chapter, and the term “shall” creates\n“an obligation impervious to judicial discretion,” Lexecon\nInc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S.\n26, 35 (1998). So the text could not be clearer: A court\nmust order restitution against a person convicted of pos-\nsessing child pornography. Section 2259(b)(4) underscores\nthis directive by declaring that “[t]he issuance of a restitu-\ntion order under this section is mandatory.” And the\nstatute’s title—“mandatory restitution”—reinforces it\nfurther still.\n   Interpreting §2259 to require but-for causality would\nflout these simple textual commands. That is because “a\nshowing of but-for causation cannot be made” in this case\n4               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nand many like it. Ante, at 12. Even without Paroline’s\noffense, it is a regrettable fact that “thousands would have\nviewed and would in the future view [Amy’s] images,” such\nthat “it cannot be shown that her trauma and attendant\nlosses would have been any different but for Parolin[e].”\nId., at 13. A but-for requirement would thus make restitu-\ntion under §2259 the opposite of “mandatory”; it would\npreclude restitution to the victim of the typical child por-\nnography offense for the nonsensical reason that the child\nhas been victimized by too many.\n   Such an approach would transform §2259 into some-\nthing unrecognizable to the Congress that wrote it. When\nCongress passed §2259 in 1994, it was common knowledge\nthat child pornography victims suffer harm at the hands of\nnumerous offenders who possess their images in common,\nwhether in print, film, or electronic form. See, e.g.,\nShouvlin, Preventing the Sexual Exploitation of Children:\nA Model Act, 17 Wake Forest L. Rev. 535, 544 (1981)\n(describing the “enormous number of magazines” and\n“hundreds of films” produced each year depicting the\nsexual abuse of children, which were circulated to untold\nnumbers of offenders through a “well-organized distribu-\ntion system [that] ensures that even the small towns have\naccess to [the] material”); Doyle, FBI Probing Child Porn\non Computers, San Francisco Chronicle, Dec. 5, 1991,\np. A23 (describing complaint that “child pornographic pho-\ntographs” were circulating via the “America On-Line com-\nputer service”). Congress was also acutely aware of the\nsevere injuries that victims of child pornography suffer at\nthe hands of criminals who possess and view the recorded\nimages of their sexual abuse. Congress found, for exam-\nple, that the “continued existence” and circulation of child\npornography images “causes the child victims of sexual\nabuse continuing harm by haunting those children in\nfuture years.” Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996,\n§121, 110 Stat. 3009–26, Congressional Findings (2), notes\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

C. §2251 (hereinafter §2251 Findings).\nIt is inconceivable that Congress would have imposed a\nmandatory restitution obligation on the possessors who\ncontribute to these “continuing harm[s],” ibid., only\nto direct courts to apply a but-for cause requirement\nthat would prevent victims from actually obtaining any\nrecovery.\n   There is, of course, an alternative standard for deter-\nmining cause-in-fact that would be consistent with the\ntext of §2259 and the context in which it was enacted:\naggregate causation. As the majority points out, aggre-\ngate causation was, “no less than the but-for test itself,” a\n“part of the background legal tradition against which\nCongress” legislated. Ante, at 21. And under this stand-\nard, “ ‘[w]hen the conduct of two or more actors is so re-\nlated to an event that their combined conduct, viewed as a\nwhole, is a but-for cause of the event, and application of\nthe but-for rule to them individually would absolve all of\nthem, the conduct of each is a cause in fact of the event.’ ”\nAnte, at 14 (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.\nOwen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §41, p. 268 (5th\ned. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton)).1 Paroline and\nhis fellow offenders plainly qualify as factual causes under\nthis approach because Amy’s losses would not have oc-\ncurred but for their combined conduct, and because apply-\ning the but-for rule would excuse them all.\n   There is every reason to think Congress intended §2259\n\n——————\n   1 The Fifth Circuit recognized this standard more than 60 years ago\n\nwhen it observed that “ ‘[a]ccording to the great weight of authority\nwhere the concurrent or successive acts or omissions of two or more\npersons, although acting independently of each other, are in combina-\ntion, the direct or proximate cause of a single injury,’ ” any of them may\nbe held liable “ ‘even though his act alone might not have caused the\nentire injury, or the same damage might have resulted from the act of\nthe other tort-feasor[s].’ ” Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Hardee, 189 F. 2d\n205, 212 (1951) (quoting 38 Am. Jur. Negligence §257, p. 946 (1941)).\n6               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nto incorporate aggregate causation. Whereas a but-for\nrequirement would set §2259’s “mandatory” restitution\ncommand on a collision course with itself, the aggregate\ncausation standard follows directly from the statute.\nSection 2259 is unequivocal; it offers no safety-in-numbers\nexception for defendants who possess images of a child’s\nabuse in common with other offenders. And the aggregate\ncausation standard exists to avoid exactly that kind of\nexception. See Prosser and Keeton §41, at 268–269 (ag-\ngregate causation applies where multiple defendants\n“bea[r] a like relationship” to a victim’s injury, and where\n“[e]ach seeks to escape liability for a reason that, if recog-\nnized, would likewise protect each other defendant in the\ngroup, thus leaving the [victim] without a remedy in the face\nof the fact that had none of them acted improperly the\n[victim] would not have suffered the harm”); Restatement\n(Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional\nHarm §27, Comment f, p. 380 (2005) (similar).\n   At bottom, Congress did not intend §2259 to create a\nsafe harbor for those who inflict upon their victims the\nproverbial death by a thousand cuts. Given the very\nnature of the child pornography market—in which a large\nclass of offenders contribute jointly to their victims’ harm\nby trading in their images—a but-for causation require-\nment would swallow §2259’s “mandatory” restitution\ncommand, leaving victims with little hope of recovery.\nThat is all the “textual [and] contextual” reason necessary\nto conclude that Congress incorporated aggregate causa-\ntion into §2259. Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\n                            B\n  The dissent of THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests that a con-\ntrary conclusion is compelled by our decision in Hughey v.\nUnited States, 495 U. S. 411 (1990). Hughey involved a\ndefendant who had been convicted of a single count of\nunauthorized credit card use, which resulted in $10,412 in\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

The Government nonetheless re-\nquested restitution for additional losses based on different\ncounts in the indictment that the Government had agreed\nto dismiss. Id., at 413. We declined the Government’s\nrequest, reasoning that restitution was to be tied to the\noffense of conviction. Id., at 418.\n   That commonsense holding, of course, casts no doubt on\nthe ordinary practice of requiring restitution for losses\ncaused by an offense for which a defendant is convicted,\nwhere the loss is the product of the combined conduct of\nmultiple offenders. What troubles my colleagues in this\ncase, then, is not the concept of restitution in cases involv-\ning losses caused by more than one offender. Their objec-\ntion is instead to restitution in cases where the victim’s\nlosses are caused by too many offenders. As THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE puts it, Congress wrote a law that would enable\nAmy to recover if only her images had been circulated by\n“a single distributor” to just a “handful of possessors.”\nAnte, at 6–7. But because she has been victimized by\nnumerous distributors and thousands of possessors, she\ngets nothing. It goes without saying that Congress did not\nintend that result.\n   My colleagues in dissent next assert that no restitution\nmay be awarded because of §3664(e), which describes the\nGovernment’s burden of showing the “loss sustained by a\nvictim as a result of the offense.” But that provision is\nnothing close to a “direct answer” to this case. Ante, at 4.\nIt simply restates the question: What should a court do\nwhen the losses sustained by a victim are the “result of the\n[defendant’s] offense,” §3664(e), but that result is produced\nin combination with the offenses of others? One answer is\nthat the defendant’s offense is a cause-in-fact only of losses\nfor which it was a but-for cause. A second is that the\noffense is a cause-in-fact of losses for which it was part of\nthe aggregate cause. The former would preclude restitu-\ntion in cases like this; the latter would allow it. Given\n8                  PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nCongress’ “mandatory” command that courts “shall order\nrestitution for any offense,” §§2259(a), (b)(4), it is beyond\nclear which answer Congress chose.2\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent also fails to contend with\nthe ramifications of the suggestion that §3664(e) forecloses\nentry of restitution in cases where a victim suffers indi-\nvisible losses as a result of the aggregate conduct of nu-\nmerous offenders. It claims that this reading of §3664(e)\n“will work just fine” for “common crimes” such as assault.\nAnte, at 5–6. But what about a victim of a vicious gang\nassault, where a single offender’s conduct cannot be la-\nbeled a but-for cause of any discrete injury? Such offenses\nare, unfortunately, all too common. See, e.g., Wheelock v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2318145</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *2 (ED Wisc., May 28,\n2013) (defendant convicted for his participation in a gang\nrape of a 13-year-old victim in which he “and several other\nindividuals had provided alcohol to the girl and, after she\nbecame intoxicated and unconscious, sexually assaulted\nher”); United States v.

I would have thought it beyond\nrefute that the victim of such a tragic offense would be\nentitled to restitution even though none of her losses may\nbe attributed solely to any individual defendant. If the\nopinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE is in agreement, it does not\nexplain why the result should be any different for victims\nlike Amy, who have suffered heart wrenching losses at the\n——————\n    2 THE\n        CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent elides the distinction between aggre-\ngate and but-for causation. Despite “assum[ing], for purposes of argu-\nment,” that §2259 incorporates aggregate causation, the dissent never-\ntheless applies but-for causation to determine the “full amount” of\nlosses Paroline must pay. See ante, at 5, and n. 2 (arguing that Paro-\nline can only be asked to pay “the full amount of the losses he caused,”\nnot losses that he and others combined to cause). My dissenting\ncolleagues cannot have it both ways. Either §2259 incorporates aggre-\ngate causation (in which case the full amount of Amy’s losses is all of\nthe losses aggregately caused by Paroline and like offenders), or it\nrequires but-for causation (in which case Amy gets nothing).\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

But the majority resists the “strict\nlogic” of aggregate causation for fear that doing so would\nproduce the “striking outcome” of an award against an\nindividual possessor “for the entire aggregately caused\namount.” Ante, at 15–16. The majority accordingly holds\nthat “a court applying §2259 should order restitution in an\namount that comports with the defendant’s relative”\ncontribution to “the victim’s general losses.” Ante, at 21.\n    The majority’s apportionment approach appears to be a\nsensible one. It would, for instance, further the goal of\n“proportionality in sentencing,” avoid “turning away vic-\ntims emptyhanded,” and “spread payment among” offend-\ners. Ante, at 24–25. But it suffers from a far more funda-\nmental problem: It contravenes the language Congress\nactually used.

But individuals need not act together\nto trigger joint and several liability; such liability applies equally to\nmultiple actors who independently commit intentional torts that\ncombine to produce an indivisible injury. Infra, at 11–14. And in any\nevent, the offenders at issue in this case do act together, with the\ncommon end of trafficking in the market for images of child sexual\nabuse. See infra, at 12–13. While these offenders may not be physi-\ncally in the same room when they commit their crimes, there is no rea-\nson to read §2259(b)(4)’s “mandatory” restitution command out of the\nstatute for child abusers who hide behind the anonymity of a computer\nscreen.\n10              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe “full amount of the victim’s losses.” §2259(b)(1). That\ncommand is unequivocal, and it is buttressed by the tort\nlaw tradition of joint and several liability within which\nCongress legislated.\n                             A\n   Once a defendant is found to bear a sufficient causal\nnexus to a victim’s harm, §2259 provides a straightfor-\nward instruction on how much restitution a court is to\norder: “The order of restitution under this section shall\ndirect the defendant to pay the victim . . . the full amount\nof the victim’s losses.” §2259(b)(1). Because the word\n“shall” imposes a “discretionless obligatio[n],” Lopez v.\nDavis, 531 U. S. 230, 241 (2001), a court considering a\n§2259 restitution request has no license to deviate from\nthe statute’s command. It must enter an order for the “full\namount of the victim’s losses,” regardless of whether other\ndefendants may have contributed to the same victim’s\nharm.\n   If there were any doubt on the matter, Congress elimi-\nnated it in §2259(b)(4)(B)(ii), which bars a court from\n“declin[ing] to issue [a restitution] order under this sec-\ntion” on the ground that a victim “is entitled to receive\ncompensation for his or her injuries from the proceeds of\ninsurance or any other source.” One “other source” from\nwhich a victim would be “entitled to receive compensation”\nis, of course, other offenders who possess images of her\nsexual abuse. It is unthinkable that Congress would have\nexpressly forbidden courts to award victims no restitution\nbecause their harms have been aggregately caused by\nmany offenders, only to permit restitution orders for a\nsingle penny for the same reason.\n                            B\n  As the majority recognizes, Congress did not draft §2259\nin a vacuum; it did so in the context of settled tort law\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S. 280, 285 (2003) (Congress “legislates against a\nlegal background of ordinary tort-related” principles).\nSection 2259 functions as a tort statute, one designed to\nensure that victims will recover compensatory damages in\nan efficient manner concurrent with criminal proceedings.\nSee Restatement of Torts §901, p. 537 (1939) (the purposes\nof tort law include “to give compensation, indemnity, or\nrestitution for harms” and “to punish wrongdoers”); Dolan\nv. United States, 560 U. S. 605, 612 (2010) (the “substan-\ntive purpose” of the related Mandatory Victims Restitution\nAct of 1996, §3664, is “to ensure that victims of a crime\nreceive full restitution”). And the nature of the child\npornography industry and the indivisible quality of the\ninjuries suffered by its victims make this a paradigmatic\nsituation in which traditional tort law principles would\nrequire joint and several liability. By requiring restitution\nfor the “full amount of the victim’s losses,” §2259(b)(1),\nCongress did not depart from these principles; it embraced\nthem.\n   First, the injuries caused by child pornography posses-\nsors are impossible to apportion in any practical sense. It\ncannot be said, for example, that Paroline’s offense alone\nrequired Amy to attend five additional minutes of therapy,\nor that it caused some discrete portion of her lost income.\nThe majority overlooks this fact, ordering courts to sur-\nmise some “circumscribed” amount of loss based on a list\nof factors. Ante, at 21, 22–23; see also ante, at 7–10\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). Section 2259’s full restitu-\ntion requirement dispenses with this guesswork, however,\nand in doing so it harmonizes with the settled tort law\ntradition concerning indivisible injuries. As this Court\nexplained this rule in Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale\nTransatlantique, 443 U. S. 256 (1979), unless a plaintiff ’s\n“injury is divisible and the causation of each part can be\nseparately assigned to each tortfeasor,” the rule is that a\n12               PAROLINE v.

Indeed, one expert describes Internet\nchild pornography networks as “an example of a complex\ncriminal conspiracy,” ibid.—the quintessential concerted\naction to which joint and several liability attaches.\n  Lastly, §2259’s full restitution requirement conforms to\nwhat Congress would have understood to be the uniform\nrule governing joint and several liability for intentional\ntorts. Under that rule, “[e]ach person who commits a tort\nthat requires intent is jointly and severally liable for any\nindivisible injury legally caused by the tortious conduct.”\nRestatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability\n§12, p. 110 (2007). There is little doubt that the posses-\nsion of images of a child being sexually abused would\namount to an intentional invasion of privacy tort—and an\nextreme one at that. See Restatement (Second) of Torts\n§652B, p. 378 (1976) (“One who intentionally intrudes,\nphysically or otherwise, upon [another’s] private affairs or\nconcerns, is subject to liability . . . if the intrusion would\nbe highly offensive to a reasonable person”).4\n——————\n   4 Possession of child pornography under §2252 constitutes an inten-\n\ntional tort notwithstanding that the offense requires a mens rea of\nknowledge. See §2252(a)(3)(B) (punishing one who “knowingly sells or\npossesses” child pornography). One is “said to act knowingly if he is\naware ‘ “that [a] result is practically certain to follow from his con-\nduct.” ’ ” United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 404 (1980). That\ndefinition is, if anything, more exacting than the kind of “intent”\nrequired for an intentional tort under the Restatement, which defines\n“intent” to include situations where an actor “believes that . . . conse-\nquences are substantially certain to result from [his act].” Restatement\n14                  PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Section 2259’s imposition of joint and several liability\nmakes particular sense when viewed in light of this inten-\ntional tort rule. For at the end of the day, the question of\nhow to allocate losses among defendants is really a choice\nbetween placing the risk of loss on the defendants (since\none who is caught first may be required to pay more than\nhis fair share) or the victim (since an apportionment re-\ngime would risk preventing her from obtaining full recov-\nery). Whatever the merits of placing the risk of loss on a\nvictim in the context of a negligence-based offense, Con-\ngress evidently struck the balance quite differently in this\ncontext, placing the risk on the morally culpable posses-\nsors of child pornography and not their innocent child\nvictims.\n                              C\n   Notwithstanding §2259’s text and the longstanding tort\nlaw traditions that support it, the majority adopts an\napportionment approach based on its concern that joint\nand several liability might lead to unfairness as applied to\nindividual defendants. See ante, at 15–22. The majority\nfinds this approach necessary because §2259 does not\nprovide individual defendants with the ability to seek\ncontribution from other offenders. Ante, at 17–18. I agree\nthat the statute does not create a cause of action for con-\ntribution, but unlike the majority I do not think the ab-\nsence of contribution suggests that Congress intended the\nphrase “full amount of the victim’s losses” to mean some-\nthing less than that. For instead of expending judicial\nresources on disputes between intentional tortfeasors,\nCongress crafted a different mechanism for preventing\ninequitable treatment of individual defendants—the use of\nperiodic payment schedules.\n   Section 2259(b)(2) directs that “[a]n order of restitution\n—————— \n\n(Second) of Torts §8A, p. 15 (1965). \n\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Thus, §3664(f )(2) states that a\ncourt “shall . . . specify in the restitution order . . . the\nschedule according to whic[h] the restitution is to be paid,”\nand §3664(f)(3)(A) provides that “[a] restitution order may\ndirect the defendant to make a single, lump sum payment”\nor “partial payments at specified intervals.” Critically, in\nchoosing between lump-sum and partial payments, courts\n“shall” consider “the financial resources and other assets\nof the defendant,” along with “any financial obligations\nof the defendant, including obligations to dependents.”\n§§3664(f )(2)(A), (C).\n   Applying these factors to set an appropriate payment\nschedule in light of any individual child pornography\npossessor’s financial circumstances would not be difficult;\nindeed, there is already a robust body of case law clarify-\ning how payment schedules are to be set under §3664(f ).\nFor example, Courts of Appeals have uniformly found it an\nabuse of discretion to require defendants to make immedi-\nate lump-sum payments for the full amount of a restitu-\ntion award when they do not have the ability to do so. In\nsuch cases, Congress has instead required courts to im-\npose periodic payment schedules. See, e.g., United States\nv. McGlothlin, 249 F. 3d 783, 784 (CA8 2001) (reversing\nlump-sum payment order where defendant “had no ability\nto pay the restitution immediately,” and requiring District\nCourt to set a periodic payment schedule); United States v.\nMyers, 198 F. 3d 160, 168–169 (CA5 1999) (same). The\nexisting body of law also provides guidance as to proper\npayment schedules. Compare, e.g., United States v. Cal-\nbat, 266 F. 3d 358, 366 (CA5 2001) (annual payment of\n16              PAROLINE v.

A more difficult challenge is presented,\nhowever, by the case of a wealthy defendant who would\nbe able to satisfy a large restitution judgment in an imme-\ndiate lump-sum payment. But the statute is fully capable\nof ensuring just results for these defendants, too. For in\naddition to an offender’s financial circumstances, §3664\npermits courts to consider other factors “in the interest of\njustice” when deciding whether to impose a payment\nschedule. See §3664(f )(2) (district court shall specify\npayment schedule “pursuant to section 3572”); §3572(d)(1)\n(restitution order shall be payable in periodic installments\nif “in the interest of justice”).\n   Accordingly, in the context of a restitution order against\na wealthy child pornography possessor, it would likely be\nin the interest of justice for a district court to set a pay-\nment schedule requiring the defendant to pay restitution\nin amounts equal to the periodic losses that the district\ncourt finds will actually be “incurred by the victim,”\n§2259(b)(3), in the given timeframe. In this case, for\nexample, Amy’s expert estimates that she will suffer\napproximately $3.4 million in losses from medical costs\nand lost income over the next 60 years of her life, or ap-\nproximately $56,000 per year. If that estimate is deemed\naccurate, a court would enter a restitution order against a\nwealthy defendant for the full $3.4 million amount of\nAmy’s losses, and could make it payable on an annual\nschedule of $56,000 per year. Doing so would serve the\ninterest of justice because the periodic payment schedule\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   17\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwould allow the individual wealthy defendant’s ultimate\nburden to be substantially offset by payments made by\nother offenders,5 while the entry of the full restitution\naward would provide certainty to Amy that she will be\nmade whole for her losses.\n                          *     *     *\n   Although I ultimately reach a different conclusion as to\nthe proper interpretation of the statutory scheme, I do\nappreciate the caution with which the Court has an-\nnounced its approach. For example, the Court expressly\nrejects the possibility of district courts entering restitution\norders for “token or nominal amount[s].” Ante, at 21.\nThat point is important because, if taken out of context,\naspects of the Court’s opinion might be construed other-\nwise. For instance, the Court states that in estimating a\nrestitution amount, a district court may consider “the\nbroader number of offenders involved (most of whom will,\nof course, never be caught or convicted).” Ante, at 23. If\nthat factor is given too much weight, it could lead to ex-\nactly the type of trivial restitution awards the Court dis-\nclaims. Amy’s counsel has noted, for instance, that in\nlight of the large number of persons who possess her im-\nages, a truly proportional approach to restitution would\n——————\n   5 As the facts of this case show, the offset would be significant. Be-\n\ntween June 2009 and December 11, 2013, Amy obtained restitution\nawards from 182 persons, 161 of whom were ordered to pay an amount\nbetween $1,000 and $530,000. See Restitution Awards for Amy\nThrough December 11, 2013, Lodging of United States. If these offend-\ners (and new offenders caught each month) were instead ordered to pay\nthe full amount of restitution in periodic amounts according to their\nfinancial means, a wealthy defendant’s annual obligation would termi-\nnate long before he would be required to pay anything close to the full\n$3.4 million. For once a victim receives the full amount of restitution,\nall outstanding obligations expire because §2259 does not displace the\nsettled joint and several liability rule forbidding double recovery. See\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §885(3) (1979), see also, e.g., United\nStates v. Nucci, 364 F. 3d 419, 423 (CA2 2004).\n18                PAROLINE v.

Congress obviously\ndid not intend that outcome, and the Court wisely refuses\nto permit it.6\n   In the end, of course, it is Congress that will have the\nfinal say. If Congress wishes to recodify its full restitution\ncommand, it can do so in language perhaps even more\nclear than §2259’s “mandatory” directive to order restitu-\ntion for the “full amount of the victim’s losses.” Congress\nmight amend the statute, for example, to include the term\n“aggregate causation.” Alternatively, to avoid the uncer-\ntainty in the Court’s apportionment approach, Congress\nmight wish to enact fixed minimum restitution amounts.\nSee, e.g., §2255 (statutorily imposed $150,000 minimum\ncivil remedy). In the meanwhile, it is my hope that the\nCourt’s approach will not unduly undermine the ability of\nvictims like Amy to recover for—and from—the unfathom-\nable harms they have sustained.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  6 The Court mentions that Amy received roughly $6,000 from her\n\nuncle, the person responsible for abusing her as a child.

Argued January 22, 2014—Decided April 23, 2014\nThe respondent victim in this case was sexually abused as a young girl\n  in order to produce child pornography. When she was 17, she learned\n  that images of her abuse were being trafficked on the Internet, in ef-\n  fect repeating the original wrongs, for she knew that her humiliation\n  and hurt would be renewed well into the future as thousands of addi-\n  tional wrongdoers witnessed those crimes. Petitioner Paroline plead-\n  ed guilty in federal court to possessing images of child pornography,\n  which included two of the victim, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §2252.\n  The victim then sought restitution under §2259, requesting nearly $3\n  million in lost income and about $500,000 in future treatment and\n  counseling costs. The District Court declined to award restitution,\n  concluding that the Government had not met its burden of proving\n  what losses, if any, were proximately caused by Paroline’s offense.\n  The victim sought a writ of mandamus, asking the Fifth Circuit to di-\n  rect the District Court to order Paroline to pay restitution. Granting\n  the writ on rehearing en banc, the Fifth Circuit held, inter alia, that\n  §2259 did not limit restitution to losses proximately caused by the de-\n  fendant, and that each defendant who possessed the victim’s images\n  should be made liable for the victim’s entire losses from the trade in\n  her images.\nHeld:\n    1. Restitution is proper under §2259 only to the extent the defend-\n ant’s offense proximately caused a victim’s losses. This provision has\n a broad restitutionary purpose, stating that a district court “shall or-\n der restitution for any offense” under Chapter 110 of Title 18, such as\n Paroline’s possession offense; requiring district courts to order de-\n fendants “to pay the victim . . . the full amount of the victim’s losses\n as determined by the court,” §2259(b)(1); and expressly making “is-\n2                     PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    suance of a restitution order . . . mandatory,” §2259(b)(4)(A). The\n    Government has the “burden of demonstrating the amount of the\n    [victim’s] loss.” §3664(e).\n       To say one event proximately caused another means, first, that the\n    former event caused the latter, i.e., actual cause or cause in fact; and\n    second, that it is a proximate cause, i.e., it has a sufficient connection\n    to the result. The concept of proximate causation is applicable in\n    both criminal and tort law, and the analysis is parallel in many in-\n    stances. Section 2259(c) defines a victim as “the individual harmed\n    as a result of a commission of a crime under this chapter.” The words\n    “as a result of ” plainly suggest causation, and the referent of “a\n    crime” is the offense of conviction. The “full amount of the victim’s\n    losses,” §2259(b)(1), includes “any costs incurred by the victim” for six\n    enumerated categories of expense, §2259(b)(3). The reference to\n    “costs incurred by the victim” is most naturally understood as costs\n    arising “as a result of ” the offense of conviction, i.e., the defendant’s\n    conduct. And the last of the six enumerated categories—for “other\n    losses suffered . . . as a proximate result of the offense,”\n    §2259(b)(3)(F)—clearly states that the causal requirement is one of\n    proximate cause. This reading is supported by the canon of construc-\n    tion that, “[w]hen several words are followed by a clause which is ap-\n    plicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natu-\n    ral construction of the language demands that the clause be read as\n    applicable to all.” Porto Rico Railway, Light & Power Co. v. Mor, 253\n    U. S. 345, 348. The reading also presents a commonsense way to im-\n    pose sensible limitations on claims for attenuated costs. Pp. 5–11.\n       2. Applying the statute’s causation requirements in this case, vic-\n    tims should be compensated and defendants should be held to ac-\n    count for the impact of their conduct on those victims, but defendants\n    should only be made liable for the consequences and gravity of their\n    own conduct, not the conduct of others. Pp. 11–25.\n          (a) A somewhat atypical causal process underlies the losses here.\n    It may be simple to prove aggregate losses, i.e., “general losses,”\n    stemming from the ongoing traffic in the victim’s images, but the\n    question for §2259 purposes is how much of these general losses were\n    the “proximate result” of an individual defendant’s offense. Here, the\n    victim’s costs of treatment and lost income resulting from the trauma\n    of knowing that images of her abuse are being viewed over and over\n    are direct and foreseeable results of child-pornography crimes, pro-\n    vided the prerequisite of factual causation is satisfied. The primary\n    problem, then, is the proper standard of causation in fact. Pp. 11–12.\n          (b) A showing of but-for causation is not the proper standard\n    here, for it is not possible to prove that the victim’s losses would be\n    less but for one possessor’s individual role in the large, loosely con-\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

The victim and\nthe Government urge the Court to read §2259 to require a less re-\nstrictive causation standard in child-pornography cases like this.\nThey endorse the theory of “aggregate causation,” one formulation of\nwhich finds factual causation satisfied where a wrongdoer’s conduct,\nthough alone “insufficient . . . to cause the plaintiff ’s harm,” is, “when\ncombined with conduct by other persons,” “more than sufficient to\ncause the harm.” 1 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical\nand Emotional Harm §27, Comment f. Tort law teaches that such al-\nternative causal tests, though a kind of legal fiction, may be neces-\nsary to vindicate the law’s purposes, for it would be anomalous to\nturn away a person harmed by the combined acts of many wrongdo-\ners simply because none of those wrongdoers alone caused the harm,\nand nonsensical to adopt a rule whereby individuals hurt by the com-\nbined wrongful acts of many would have no redress, while those hurt\nby the acts of one person alone would. These are sound principles.\nTaken too far, however, such alternative causal standards would\ntreat each possessor as the cause in fact of all the trauma and at-\ntendant losses incurred as a result of all the ongoing traffic in the vic-\ntim’s images. Aggregate causation logic should not be adopted in an\nincautious manner in the context of criminal restitution, which dif-\nfers from tort law in numerous respects. Paroline’s contribution to\nthe causal process underlying the victim’s losses was very minor,\nboth compared to the combined acts of all other relevant offenders\nand compared to the contributions of other individual offenders, par-\nticularly distributors and the initial producer of the child pornogra-\nphy. Congress gave no indication that it intended the statute to be\napplied in an expansive manner so starkly contrary to the principle\nthat restitution should reflect the consequences of the defendant’s\nown conduct. The victim claims that holding each possessor liable for\nher entire losses would be fair and practical in part because offenders\ncan seek contribution from one another, but there is no general fed-\neral right to contribution and no specific statutory authorization for\ncontribution here. Her severe approach could also raise questions\nunder the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Pp. 12–\n19.\n     (c) While the victim’s expansive reading must be rejected, that\ndoes not mean the broader principles underlying aggregate causation\ntheories are irrelevant to determining the proper outcome in cases\nlike this. The cause of the victim’s general losses is the trade in her\nimages, and Paroline is a part of that cause. Just as it undermines\nthe purposes of tort law to turn away plaintiffs harmed by several\nwrongdoers, it would undermine §2259’s purposes to turn away vic-\ntims in cases like this. With respect to the statute’s remedial pur-\n4                    PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    pose, there is no question that it would produce anomalous results to\n    say that no restitution is appropriate in these circumstances, for\n    harms of the kind the victim endured here are a major reason why\n    child pornography is outlawed. The unlawful conduct of everyone\n    who reproduces, distributes, or possesses images of the victim’s\n    abuse—including Paroline—plays a part in sustaining and aggravat-\n    ing this tragedy. And there is no doubt Congress wanted restitution\n    for such victims. Denying restitution would also be at odds with\n    §2259’s penological purposes, which include the need to impress upon\n    offenders that their conduct produces concrete and devastating\n    harms for real, identifiable victims. Thus, where it can be shown\n    both that a defendant possessed a victim’s images and that a victim\n    has outstanding losses caused by the continuing traffic in her images\n    but where it is impossible to trace a particular amount of those losses\n    to the individual defendant utilizing a more traditional causal in-\n    quiry, a court should order restitution in an amount that comports\n    with the defendant’s relative role in the causal process underlying\n    the victim’s general losses.\n      District courts should use discretion and sound judgment in deter-\n    mining the proper amount of restitution. A variety of factors may\n    serve as guideposts. Courts might, as a start, determine the amount\n    of the victim’s losses caused by the continuing traffic in the victim’s\n    images, and then base an award on factors bearing on the relative\n    causal significance of the defendant’s conduct in producing those\n    losses. The victim finds this approach untenable because her losses\n    are “indivisible,” but the Court is required to define a causal standard\n    that effects the statute’s purposes, not to apply tort-law concepts in a\n    mechanical way in the criminal restitution context. She also argues\n    she will be consigned to “piecemeal” restitution that may never lead\n    to full recovery, but Congress has not promised victims full and swift\n    restitution at the cost of holding a defendant liable for an amount\n    drastically out of proportion to his individual causal relation to those\n    losses. Furthermore, this approach better effects the need to impress\n    upon defendants that their acts are not irrelevant or victimless.\n    Pp. 19–25.\n         (d) Though this approach is not without difficulties, courts can\n    only do their best to apply the statute as written in a workable man-\n    ner, faithful to the competing principles at stake: that victims should\n    be compensated and that defendants should be held to account for the\n    impact of their own conduct, not the conduct of others. District\n    courts, which routinely exercise wide discretion both in sentencing\n    generally and in fashioning restitution orders, should be able to apply\n    the causal standard defined here without further detailed guidance.\n    P. 25.\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

The relevant statu-\ntory provisions are set forth at 18 U. S. C. §2259. Enacted\nas a component of the Violence Against Women Act of\n1994, §2259 requires district courts to award restitution\nfor certain federal criminal offenses, including child-\npornography possession.\n   Petitioner Doyle Randall Paroline pleaded guilty to such\nan offense. He admitted to possessing between 150 and\n300 images of child pornography, which included two that\ndepicted the sexual exploitation of a young girl, now a\nyoung woman, who goes by the pseudonym “Amy” for this\nlitigation. The question is what causal relationship must\nbe established between the defendant’s conduct and a\nvictim’s losses for purposes of determining the right to,\nand the amount of, restitution under §2259.\n                          I\n  Three decades ago, this Court observed that “the ex-\n2               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nploitive use of children in the production of pornography\nhas become a serious national problem.” New York v.\nFerber, 458 U. S. 747, 749 (1982). The demand for child\npornography harms children in part because it drives\nproduction, which involves child abuse. The harms caused\nby child pornography, however, are still more extensive\nbecause child pornography is “a permanent record” of the\ndepicted child’s abuse, and “the harm to the child is exac-\nerbated by [its] circulation.” Id., at 759. Because child\npornography is now traded with ease on the Internet, “the\nnumber of still images and videos memorializing the\nsexual assault and other sexual exploitation of children,\nmany very young in age, has grown exponentially.” United\nStates Sentencing Comm’n, P. Saris et al., Federal\nChild Pornography Offenses 3 (2012) (hereinafter Sentenc-\ning Comm’n Report).\n  One person whose story illustrates the devastating\nharm caused by child pornography is the respondent\nvictim in this case. When she was eight and nine years\nold, she was sexually abused by her uncle in order to\nproduce child pornography. Her uncle was prosecuted,\nrequired to pay about $6,000 in restitution, and sentenced\nto a lengthy prison term. The victim underwent an initial\ncourse of therapy beginning in 1998 and continuing into\n1999. By the end of this period, her therapist’s notes\nreported that she was “ ‘back to normal’ ”; her involvement\nin dance and other age-appropriate activities, and the\nsupport of her family, justified an optimistic assessment.\nApp. 70–71. Her functioning appeared to decline in her\nteenage years, however; and a major blow to her recovery\ncame when, at the age of 17, she learned that images of\nher abuse were being trafficked on the Internet. Id., at 71.\nThe digital images were available nationwide and no\ndoubt worldwide. Though the exact scale of the trade in\nher images is unknown, the possessors to date easily\nnumber in the thousands. The knowledge that her images\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwere circulated far and wide renewed the victim’s trauma\nand made it difficult for her to recover from her abuse. As\nshe explained in a victim impact statement submitted to\nthe District Court in this case:\n    “Every day of my life I live in constant fear that some-\n    one will see my pictures and recognize me and that I\n    will be humiliated all over again. It hurts me to know\n    someone is looking at them—at me—when I was just\n    a little girl being abused for the camera. I did not\n    choose to be there, but now I am there forever in pic-\n    tures that people are using to do sick things. I want it\n    all erased. I want it all stopped. But I am powerless\n    to stop it just like I was powerless to stop my un-\n    cle. . . . My life and my feelings are worse now because\n    the crime has never really stopped and will never re-\n    ally stop. . . . It’s like I am being abused over and over\n    and over again.” Id., at 60–61.\nThe victim says in her statement that her fear and trauma\nmake it difficult for her to trust others or to feel that she\nhas control over what happens to her. Id., at 63.\n  The full extent of this victim’s suffering is hard to grasp.\nHer abuser took away her childhood, her self-conception of\nher innocence, and her freedom from the kind of night-\nmares and memories that most others will never know.\nThese crimes were compounded by the distribution of\nimages of her abuser’s horrific acts, which meant the\nwrongs inflicted upon her were in effect repeated; for she\nknew her humiliation and hurt were and would be re-\nnewed into the future as an ever-increasing number of\nwrongdoers witnessed the crimes committed against her.\n  Petitioner Paroline is one of the individuals who pos-\nsessed this victim’s images. In 2009, he pleaded guilty in\nfederal court to one count of possession of material involv-\ning the sexual exploitation of children in violation of 18\nU. S. C. §2252. 672 F. Supp. 2d 781, 783 (ED Tex. 2009).\n4              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nParoline admitted to knowing possession of between 150\nand 300 images of child pornography, two of which depicted\nthe respondent victim. Ibid. The victim sought restitution\nunder §2259, asking for close to $3.4 million, consisting\nof nearly $3 million in lost income and about $500,000\nin future treatment and counseling costs. App. 52, 104.\nShe also sought attorney’s fees and costs. 672 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 783. The parties submitted competing expert reports.\nThey stipulated that the victim did not know who Paroline\nwas and that none of her claimed losses flowed from any\nspecific knowledge about him or his offense conduct. Id.,\nat 792, and n. 11; App. 230.\n   After briefing and hearings, the District Court declined\nto award restitution. 672 F. Supp. 2d, at 793. The Dis-\ntrict Court observed that “everyone involved with child\npornography—from the abusers and producers to the end-\nusers and possessors—contribute[s] to [the victim’s] ongo-\ning harm.” Id., at 792. But it concluded that the Govern-\nment had the burden of proving the amount of the victim’s\nlosses “directly produced by Paroline that would not have\noccurred without his possession of her images.” Id., at\n791. The District Court found that, under this standard,\nthe Government had failed to meet its burden of proving\nwhat losses, if any, were proximately caused by Paroline’s\noffense. It thus held that “an award of restitution is not\nappropriate in this case.” Id., at 793.\n   The victim sought a writ of mandamus, asking the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to\ndirect the District Court to order Paroline to pay restitu-\ntion in the amount requested. In re Amy, 591 F. 3d 792,\n793 (2009). The Court of Appeals denied relief. Id., at\n795. The victim sought rehearing. Her rehearing request\nwas granted, as was her petition for a writ of mandamus.\nIn re Amy Unknown, 636 F. 3d 190, 201 (2011).\n   The Fifth Circuit reheard the case en banc along with\nanother case, in which the defendant, Michael Wright, had\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nraised similar issues in appealing an order of restitution\nunder §2259, see United States v. Wright, 639 F. 3d 679,\n681 (2011) (per curiam). As relevant, the Court of Appeals\nset out to determine the level of proof required to award\nrestitution to victims in cases like this. It held that §2259\ndid not limit restitution to losses proximately caused by\nthe defendant, and each defendant who possessed the\nvictim’s images should be made liable for the victim’s\nentire losses from the trade in her images, even though\nother offenders played a role in causing those losses. In re\nAmy Unknown, 701 F. 3d 749, 772–774 (2012) (en banc).\n  Paroline sought review here. Certiorari was granted to\nresolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals over the proper\ncausation inquiry for purposes of determining the entitle-\nment to and amount of restitution under §2259. 570 U. S.\n___ (2013). For the reasons set forth, the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals is vacated.\n                              II\n   Title 18 U. S. C. §2259(a) provides that a district court\n“shall order restitution for any offense” under Chapter 110\nof Title 18, which covers a number of offenses involving\nthe sexual exploitation of children and child pornography\nin particular. Paroline was convicted of knowingly pos-\nsessing child pornography under §2252, a Chapter 110\noffense.\n   Section 2259 states a broad restitutionary purpose: It\nrequires district courts to order defendants “to pay the\nvictim . . . the full amount of the victim’s losses as deter-\nmined by the court,” §2259(b)(1), and expressly states that\n“[t]he issuance of a restitution order under this section is\nmandatory,” §2259(b)(4)(A). Section 2259(b)(2) provides\nthat “[a]n order of restitution under this section shall be\nissued and enforced in accordance with section 3664,”\nwhich in turn provides in relevant part that “[t]he burden\nof demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a\n6               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nvictim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney for\nthe Government,” §3664(e).\n  The threshold question the Court faces is whether §2259\nlimits restitution to those losses proximately caused by the\ndefendant’s offense conduct. The Fifth Circuit held that it\ndoes not, contrary to the holdings of other Courts of Ap-\npeals to have addressed the question. Compare, e.g., 701\nF. 3d, at 752 (no general proximate-cause requirement\napplies under §2259), with United States v. Rogers, 714\nF. 3d 82, 89 (CA1 2013) (general proximate-cause re-\nquirement applies under §2259); United States v. Benoit,\n713 F. 3d 1, 20 (CA10 2013) (same); United States v. Fast,\n709 F. 3d 712, 721–722 (CA8 2013) (same); United States\nv. Laraneta, 700 F. 3d 983, 989–990 (CA7 2012) (same);\nUnited States v.

McDaniel, 631 F. 3d 1204, 1208–1209 (CA11\n2011) (same).\n  As a general matter, to say one event proximately\ncaused another is a way of making two separate but related\nassertions. First, it means the former event caused the\nlatter. This is known as actual cause or cause in fact. The\nconcept of actual cause “is not a metaphysical one but an\nordinary, matter-of-fact inquiry into the existence . . . of a\ncausal relation as laypeople would view it.” 4 F. Harper,\nF. James, & O. Gray, Torts §20.2, p. 100 (3d ed. 2007).\n  Every event has many causes, however, see ibid., and\nonly some of them are proximate, as the law uses that\nterm. So to say that one event was a proximate cause of\nanother means that it was not just any cause, but one with\na sufficient connection to the result. The idea of proximate\ncause, as distinct from actual cause or cause in fact, defies\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neasy summary. It is “a flexible concept,” Bridge v. Phoenix\nBond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 654 (2008), that\ngenerally “refers to the basic requirement that . . . there\nmust be ‘some direct relation between the injury asserted\nand the injurious conduct alleged,’ ” CSX Transp., Inc. v.\nMcBride, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (ROBERTS, C. J., dis-\nsenting) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Holmes v. Securities Inves-\ntor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992)). The\nconcept of proximate causation is applicable in both crimi-\nnal and tort law, and the analysis is parallel in many\ninstances.     1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law\n§6.4(c), p. 471 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter LaFave). Proxi-\nmate cause is often explicated in terms of foreseeability or\nthe scope of the risk created by the predicate conduct.\nSee, e.g., ibid.; 1 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for\nPhysical and Emotional Harm §29, p. 493 (2005) (herein-\nafter Restatement). A requirement of proximate cause\nthus serves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations\nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is so\nattenuated that the consequence is more aptly described\nas mere fortuity. Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517\nU. S. 830, 838–839 (1996).\n   All parties agree §2259 imposes some causation re-\nquirement. The statute defines a victim as “the individual\nharmed as a result of a commission of a crime under this\nchapter.” §2259(c). The words “as a result of ” plainly\nsuggest causation. See Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v.\nValladolid, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 13); see\nalso Burrage v. United States, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014)\n(slip op., at 5). And a straightforward reading of §2259(c)\nindicates that the term “a crime” refers to the offense of\nconviction. Cf. Hughey v. United States, 495 U. S. 411,\n416 (1990). So if the defendant’s offense conduct did not\ncause harm to an individual, that individual is by defini-\ntion not a “victim” entitled to restitution under §2259.\n   As noted above, §2259 requires a court to order restitu-\n8               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion for “the full amount of the victim’s losses,”\n§2259(b)(1), which the statute defines to include “any costs\nincurred by the victim” for six enumerated categories of\nexpense, §2259(b)(3). The reference to “costs incurred by\nthe victim” is most naturally understood as costs stem-\nming from the source that qualifies an individual as a\n“victim” in the first place—namely, ones arising “as a\nresult of ” the offense. Thus, as is typically the case with\ncriminal restitution, §2259 is intended to compensate\nvictims for losses caused by the offense of conviction. See\nid., at 416. This is an important point, for it means the\ncentral concern of the causal inquiry must be the conduct\nof the particular defendant from whom restitution is\nsought.\n   But there is a further question whether restitution\nunder §2259 is limited to losses proximately caused by the\noffense. As noted, a requirement of proximate cause is\nmore restrictive than a requirement of factual cause alone.\nEven if §2259 made no express reference to proximate\ncausation, the Court might well hold that a showing of\nproximate cause was required. Proximate cause is a\nstandard aspect of causation in criminal law and the law\nof torts. See 1 LaFave §6.4(a), at 464–466; W. Keeton, D.\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law\nof Torts §41, p. 263 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and\nKeeton). Given proximate cause’s traditional role in cau-\nsation analysis, this Court has more than once found a\nproximate-cause requirement built into a statute that did\nnot expressly impose one. See Holmes, supra, at 265–268;\nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459\nU. S. 519, 529–536 (1983); see also CSX Transp., Inc.,\nsupra, at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4)\n(“We have applied the standard requirement of proximate\ncause to actions under federal statutes where the text did\nnot expressly provide for it”); Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static\nControl Components, Inc., ante, at 13–14.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Here, however, the interpretive task is easier, for the\nrequirement of proximate cause is in the statute’s text.\nThe statute enumerates six categories of covered losses.\n§2259(b)(3).       These include certain medical services,\n§2259(b)(3)(A); physical and occupational therapy,\n§2259(b)(3)(B); transportation, temporary housing, and\nchild care, §2259(b)(3)(C); lost income, §2259(b)(3)(D);\nattorney’s fees and costs, §2259(b)(3)(E); and a final\ncatchall category for “any other losses suffered by the\nvictim as a proximate result of the offense,” §2259(b)(3)(F).\n   The victim argues that because the “proximate result”\nlanguage appears only in the final, catchall category of\nlosses set forth at §2259(b)(3)(F), the statute has no\nproximate-cause requirement for losses falling within the\nprior enumerated categories. She justifies this reading of\n§2259(b) in part on the grammatical rule of the last ante-\ncedent, “according to which a limiting clause or phrase . . .\nshould ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or\nphrase that it immediately follows.” Barnhart v. Thomas,\n540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). But that rule is “not an absolute\nand can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of mean-\ning.” Ibid. The Court has not applied it in a mechanical\nway where it would require accepting “unlikely premises.”\nUnited States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 425 (2009).\n   Other canons of statutory construction, moreover, work\nagainst the reading the victim suggests. “When several\nwords are followed by a clause which is applicable as much\nto the first and other words as to the last, the natural\nconstruction of the language demands that the clause be\nread as applicable to all.” Porto Rico Railway, Light &\nPower Co. v. Mor, 253 U. S. 345, 348 (1920). Furthermore,\n“[i]t is . . . a familiar canon of statutory construction that\n[catchall] clauses are to be read as bringing within a stat-\nute categories similar in type to those specifically enumer-\nated.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v. Seatrain Lines, Inc.,\n411 U. S. 726, 734 (1973). Here, §2259(b)(3)(F) defines a\n10              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbroad, final category of “other losses suffered . . . as a\nproximate result of the offense.” That category is most\nnaturally understood as a summary of the type of losses\ncovered—i.e., losses suffered as a proximate result of the\noffense.\n   The victim says that if Congress had wanted to limit the\nlosses recoverable under §2259 to those proximately\ncaused by the offense, it could have written the statute the\nsame way it wrote §2327, which provides for restitution to\nvictims of telemarketing fraud. Section 2327, which is\nwritten and structured much like §2259, simply defines\nthe term “full amount of the victim’s losses” as “all losses\nsuffered by the victim as a proximate result of the of-\nfense.” §2327(b)(3). In essence the victim argues that the\nfirst five categories of losses enumerated in §2259(b)(3)\nwould be superfluous if all were governed by a proximate-\ncause requirement. That, however, is unpersuasive. The\nfirst five categories provide guidance to district courts as\nto the specific types of losses Congress thought would\noften be the proximate result of a Chapter 110 offense and\ncould as a general matter be included in an award of\nrestitution.\n   Reading the statute to impose a general proximate-\ncause limitation accords with common sense. As noted\nabove, proximate cause forecloses liability in situations\nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is so\nattenuated that the so-called consequence is more akin to\nmere fortuity. For example, suppose the traumatized\nvictim of a Chapter 110 offender needed therapy and had a\ncar accident on the way to her therapist’s office. The\nresulting medical costs, in a literal sense, would be a\nfactual result of the offense. But it would be strange\nindeed to make a defendant pay restitution for these costs.\nThe victim herself concedes Congress did not intend costs\nlike these to be recoverable under §2259.

She says the statute\n“contextually and inferentially require[s] a nexus for why”\nthe losses were sustained—i.e., a sufficient connection to\nchild pornography. Id., at 46.\n   The victim may be right that the concept of proximate\ncause is not necessary to impose sensible limitations on\nrestitution for remote consequences. But one very effec-\ntive way, and perhaps the most obvious way, of excluding\ncosts like those arising from the hypothetical car accident\ndescribed above would be to incorporate a proximate-cause\nlimitation into the statute. Congress did so, and for rea-\nsons given above the proximate-cause requirement applies\nto all the losses described in §2259. Restitution is there-\nfore proper under §2259 only to the extent the defendant’s\noffense proximately caused a victim’s losses.\n                            III\n  There remains the difficult question of how to apply the\nstatute’s causation requirements in this case. The prob-\nlem stems from the somewhat atypical causal process\nunderlying the losses the victim claims here. It is perhaps\nsimple enough for the victim to prove the aggregate losses,\nincluding the costs of psychiatric treatment and lost in-\ncome, that stem from the ongoing traffic in her images as\na whole. (Complications may arise in disaggregating\nlosses sustained as a result of the initial physical abuse,\nbut those questions may be set aside for present purposes.)\nThese losses may be called, for convenience’s sake, a vic-\ntim’s “general losses.” The difficulty is in determining the\n“full amount” of those general losses, if any, that are the\nproximate result of the offense conduct of a particular\ndefendant who is one of thousands who have possessed\nand will in the future possess the victim’s images but who\nhas no other connection to the victim.\n  In determining the amount of general losses a defendant\n12              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmust pay under §2259 the ultimate question is how much\nof these losses were the “proximate result,” §2259(b)(3)(F),\nof that individual’s offense. But the most difficult aspect\nof this inquiry concerns the threshold requirement of\ncausation in fact. To be sure, the requirement of proxi-\nmate causation, as distinct from mere causation in fact,\nwould prevent holding any possessor liable for losses\ncaused in only a remote sense. But the victim’s costs of\ntreatment and lost income resulting from the trauma of\nknowing that images of her abuse are being viewed over\nand over are direct and foreseeable results of child-\npornography crimes, including possession, assuming the\nprerequisite of factual causation is satisfied. The primary\nproblem, then, is the proper standard of causation in fact.\n                                A\n  The traditional way to prove that one event was a fac-\ntual cause of another is to show that the latter would not\nhave occurred “but for” the former. This approach is a\nfamiliar part of our legal tradition, see 1 LaFave §6.4(b),\nat 467–468; Prosser and Keeton §41, at 266, and no party\ndisputes that a showing of but-for causation would satisfy\n§2259’s factual-causation requirement. Sometimes that\nshowing could be made with little difficulty. For example,\nbut-for causation could be shown with ease in many cases\ninvolving producers of child pornography, see §2251(a);\nparents who permit their children to be used for child-\npornography production, see §2251(b); individuals who sell\nchildren for such purposes, see §2251A; or the initial\ndistributor of the pornographic images of a child, see\n§2252.\n  In this case, however, a showing of but-for causation\ncannot be made. The District Court found that the Gov-\nernment failed to prove specific losses caused by Paroline\nin a but-for sense and recognized that it would be “incred-\nibly difficult” to do so in a case like this. 672 F. Supp. 2d,\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 791–793. That finding has a solid foundation in the\nrecord, and it is all but unchallenged in this Court. See\nBrief for Respondent Amy 63; Brief for United States 19,\n25. But see Supp. Brief for United States 8–10. From the\nvictim’s perspective, Paroline was just one of thousands of\nanonymous possessors. To be sure, the victim’s precise\ndegree of trauma likely bears a relation to the total num-\nber of offenders; it would probably be less if only 10 rather\nthan thousands had seen her images. But it is not possi-\nble to prove that her losses would be less (and by how\nmuch) but for one possessor’s individual role in the large,\nloosely connected network through which her images\ncirculate. See Sentencing Comm’n Report, at ii, xx. Even\nwithout Paroline’s offense, thousands would have viewed\nand would in the future view the victim’s images, so it\ncannot be shown that her trauma and attendant losses\nwould have been any different but for Paroline’s offense.\nThat is especially so given the parties’ stipulation that the\nvictim had no knowledge of Paroline. See supra, at 4.\n   Recognizing that losses cannot be substantiated under a\nbut-for approach where the defendant is an anonymous\npossessor of images in wide circulation on the Internet,\nthe victim and the Government urge the Court to read\n§2259 to require a less restrictive causation standard, at\nleast in this and similar child-pornography cases. They\nare correct to note that courts have departed from the but-\nfor standard where circumstances warrant, especially\nwhere the combined conduct of multiple wrongdoers pro-\nduces a bad outcome. See Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10) (acknowledging “the undoubted reality that\ncourts have not always required strict but-for causality,\neven where criminal liability is at issue”).\n   The victim and the Government look to the literature on\ncriminal and tort law for alternatives to the but-for test.\nThe Court has noted that the “most common” exception to\nthe but-for causation requirement is applied where “mul-\n14              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntiple sufficient causes independently . . . produce a result,”\nibid.; see also 1 LaFave §6.4(b), at 467–469; 1 Restatement\n§27, at 376. This exception is an ill fit here, as all parties\nseem to recognize. Paroline’s possession of two images of\nthe victim was surely not sufficient to cause her entire\nlosses from the ongoing trade in her images. Nor is there\na practical way to isolate some subset of the victim’s gen-\neral losses that Paroline’s conduct alone would have been\nsufficient to cause. See Brief for United States 26, n. 11.\n   Understandably, the victim and the Government thus\nconcentrate on a handful of less demanding causation\ntests endorsed by authorities on tort law. One prominent\ntreatise suggests that “[w]hen the conduct of two or more\nactors is so related to an event that their combined con-\nduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event,\nand application of the but-for rule to them individually\nwould absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in\nfact of the event.” Prosser and Keeton §41, at 268. The\nRestatement adopts a similar exception for “[m]ultiple\nsufficient causal sets.” 1 Restatement §27, Comment f, at\n380–381. This is where a wrongdoer’s conduct, though\nalone “insufficient . . . to cause the plaintiff ’s harm,” is,\n“when combined with conduct by other persons,” “more\nthan sufficient to cause the harm.” Ibid. The Restate-\nment offers as an example a case in which three people\nindependently but simultaneously lean on a car, creating\nenough combined force to roll it off a cliff. Ibid. Even if\neach exerted too little force to move the car, and the force\nexerted by any two was sufficient to the move the car, each\nindividual is a factual cause of the car’s destruction. Ibid.\nThe Government argues that these authorities “provide\nample support for an ‘aggregate’ causation theory,” Brief\nfor United States 18, and that such a theory would best\neffectuate congressional intent in cases like this, id., at\n18–19. The victim says much the same. Brief for Re-\nspondent Amy 42–43.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  These alternative causal tests are a kind of legal fiction\nor construct. If the conduct of a wrongdoer is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient to produce an outcome, that con-\nduct cannot in a strict sense be said to have caused the\noutcome. Nonetheless, tort law teaches that alternative\nand less demanding causal standards are necessary in\ncertain circumstances to vindicate the law’s purposes. It\nwould be anomalous to turn away a person harmed by the\ncombined acts of many wrongdoers simply because none of\nthose wrongdoers alone caused the harm. And it would be\nnonsensical to adopt a rule whereby individuals hurt by\nthe combined wrongful acts of many (and thus in many\ninstances hurt more badly than otherwise) would have\nno redress, whereas individuals hurt by the acts of one\nperson alone would have a remedy. Those are the prin-\nciples that underlie the various aggregate causation tests\nthe victim and the Government cite, and they are sound\nprinciples.\n  These alternative causal standards, though salutary\nwhen applied in a judicious manner, also can be taken too\nfar. That is illustrated by the victim’s suggested approach\nto applying §2259 in cases like this. The victim says that\nunder the strict logic of these alternative causal tests,\neach possessor of her images is a part of a causal set suffi-\ncient to produce her ongoing trauma, so each possessor\nshould be treated as a cause in fact of all the trauma and\nall the attendant losses incurred as a result of the entire\nongoing traffic in her images. Id., at 43. And she argues\nthat if this premise is accepted the further requirement of\nproximate causation poses no barrier, for she seeks resti-\ntution only for those losses that are the direct and foresee-\nable result of child-pornography offenses. Because the\nstatute requires restitution for the “full amount of the\nvictim’s losses,” including “any . . . losses suffered by the\nvictim as a proximate result of the offense,” §2259(b), she\nargues that restitution is required for the entire aggre-\n16              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngately caused amount.\n   The striking outcome of this reasoning—that each pos-\nsessor of the victim’s images would bear the consequences\nof the acts of the many thousands who possessed those\nimages—illustrates why the Court has been reluctant to\nadopt aggregate causation logic in an incautious manner,\nespecially in interpreting criminal statutes where there is\nno language expressly suggesting Congress intended that\napproach. See Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11–\n12). Even if one were to refer just to the law of torts, it\nwould be a major step to say there is a sufficient causal\nlink between the injury and the wrong so that all the\nvictim’s general losses were “suffered . . . as a proximate\nresult of [Paroline’s] offense,” §2259(b)(3)(F).\n   And there is special reason not to do so in the context of\ncriminal restitution. Aside from the manifest procedural\ndifferences between criminal sentencing and civil tort\nlawsuits, restitution serves purposes that differ from\n(though they overlap with) the purposes of tort law. See,\ne.g., Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 49, n. 10 (1986) (not-\ning that restitution is, inter alia, “an effective rehabilita-\ntive penalty”). Legal fictions developed in the law of torts\ncannot be imported into criminal restitution and applied\nto their utmost limits without due consideration of these\ndifferences.\n   Contrary to the victim’s suggestion, this is not akin to a\ncase in which a “gang of ruffians” collectively beats a\nperson, or in which a woman is “gang raped by five men on\none night or by five men on five sequential nights.” Brief\nfor Respondent Amy 55. First, this case does not involve a\nset of wrongdoers acting in concert, see Prosser and Keeton\n§52, at 346 (discussing full liability for a joint enter-\nprise); for Paroline had no contact with the overwhelming\nmajority of the offenders for whose actions the victim\nwould hold him accountable. Second, adopting the victim’s\napproach would make an individual possessor liable for\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe combined consequences of the acts of not just 2, 5, or\neven 100 independently acting offenders; but instead, a\nnumber that may reach into the tens of thousands. See\nBrief for Respondent Amy 65.\n  It is unclear whether it could ever be sensible to em-\nbrace the fiction that this victim’s entire losses were the\n“proximate result,” §2259(b)(3)(F), of a single possessor’s\noffense. Paroline’s contribution to the causal process\nunderlying the victim’s losses was very minor, both com-\npared to the combined acts of all other relevant offenders,\nand in comparison to the contributions of other individual\noffenders, particularly distributors (who may have caused\nhundreds or thousands of further viewings) and the initial\nproducer of the child pornography. See 1 Restatement\n§36, and Comment a, at 597–598 (recognizing a rule ex-\ncluding from liability individuals whose contribution to a\ncausal set that factually caused the outcome “pales by\ncomparison to the other contributions to that causal set”).\nBut see id., §27, Reporters’ Note, Comment i, at 395 (“The\nconclusion that none of ” two dozen small contributions to\na sufficient causal set was a cause of the outcome “is obvi-\nously untenable”). Congress gave no indication that it\nintended its statute to be applied in the expansive manner\nthe victim suggests, a manner contrary to the bedrock\nprinciple that restitution should reflect the consequences\nof the defendant’s own conduct, see Hughey, 495 U. S., at\n416, not the conduct of thousands of geographically and\ntemporally distant offenders acting independently, and\nwith whom the defendant had no contact.\n  The victim argues that holding each possessor liable for\nher entire losses would be fair and practical, in part be-\ncause offenders may seek contribution from one another.\nBrief for Respondent Amy 58. If that were so, it might\nmitigate to some degree the concerns her approach pre-\nsents. But there is scant authority for her contention that\noffenders convicted in different proceedings in different\n18              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdictions and ordered to pay restitution to the same\nvictim may seek contribution from one another. There is\nno general federal right to contribution. Northwest Air-\nlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U. S. 77, 96–97\n(1981). Nor does the victim point to any clear statutory\nbasis for a right to contribution in these circumstances.\nShe thus suggests that this Court should imply a cause of\naction. Brief for Respondent Amy 58. But that is a rare\nstep in any circumstance. See, e.g., Stoneridge Investment\nPartners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148,\n164–165 (2008); Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers\nIns. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 291 (1993) (noting that this\nCourt’s precedents “teach that the creation of new rights\nought to be left to legislatures, not courts”). And it would\ndo little to address the practical problems offenders would\nface in seeking contribution in any event, see Brief for\nUnited States 45–46, problems with which the victim fails\nto grapple.\n   The reality is that the victim’s suggested approach\nwould amount to holding each possessor of her images\nliable for the conduct of thousands of other independently\nacting possessors and distributors, with no legal or practi-\ncal avenue for seeking contribution. That approach is so\nsevere it might raise questions under the Excessive Fines\nClause of the Eighth Amendment. To be sure, this Court\nhas said that “the Excessive Fines Clause was intended to\nlimit only those fines directly imposed by, and payable to,\nthe government.” Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc.\nv. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 268 (1989). But\nwhile restitution under §2259 is paid to a victim, it is\nimposed by the Government “at the culmination of a crim-\ninal proceeding and requires conviction of an underlying”\ncrime, United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 328\n(1998). Thus, despite the differences between restitution\nand a traditional fine, restitution still implicates “the\nprosecutorial powers of government,” Browning-Ferris,\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 275. The primary goal of restitution is remedial\nor compensatory, cf. Bajakajian, supra, at 329, but it also\nserves punitive purposes, see Pasquantino v. United\nStates, 544 U. S. 349, 365 (2005) (“The purpose of award-\ning restitution” under 18 U. S. C. §3663A “is . . . to mete\nout appropriate criminal punishment”); Kelly, 479 U. S., at\n49, n. 10. That may be “sufficient to bring [it] within the\npurview of the Excessive Fines Clause,” Bajakajian, su-\npra, at 329, n. 4. And there is a real question whether\nholding a single possessor liable for millions of dollars in\nlosses collectively caused by thousands of independent\nactors might be excessive and disproportionate in these\ncircumstances. These concerns offer further reason not to\ninterpret the statute the way the victim suggests.\n                              B\n  The contention that the victim’s entire losses from the\nongoing trade in her images were “suffered . . . as a proxi-\nmate result” of Paroline’s offense for purposes of §2259\nmust be rejected. But that does not mean the broader\nprinciples underlying the aggregate causation theories the\nGovernment and the victim cite are irrelevant to deter-\nmining the proper outcome in cases like this. The cause of\nthe victim’s general losses is the trade in her images. And\nParoline is a part of that cause, for he is one of those who\nviewed her images. While it is not possible to identify a\ndiscrete, readily definable incremental loss he caused, it is\nindisputable that he was a part of the overall phenomenon\nthat caused her general losses. Just as it undermines the\npurposes of tort law to turn away plaintiffs harmed by\nseveral wrongdoers, it would undermine the remedial and\npenological purposes of §2259 to turn away victims in\ncases like this.\n  With respect to the statute’s remedial purpose, there\ncan be no question that it would produce anomalous re-\nsults to say that no restitution is appropriate in these\n20             PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncircumstances. It is common ground that the victim suf-\nfers continuing and grievous harm as a result of her\nknowledge that a large, indeterminate number of individ-\nuals have viewed and will in the future view images of the\nsexual abuse she endured. Brief for Petitioner 50; Brief\nfor Respondent Wright 4; Brief for United States 23; Brief\nfor Respondent Amy 60. Harms of this sort are a major\nreason why child pornography is outlawed. See Ferber,\n458 U. S., at 759. The unlawful conduct of everyone who\nreproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of the\nvictim’s abuse—including Paroline—plays a part in sus-\ntaining and aggravating this tragedy. And there can be no\ndoubt Congress wanted victims to receive restitution for\nharms like this. The law makes restitution “mandatory,”\n§2259(b)(4), for child-pornography offenses under Chapter\n110, language that indicates Congress’ clear intent that\nvictims of child pornography be compensated by the perpe-\ntrators who contributed to their anguish. It would un-\ndermine this intent to apply the statute in a way that\nwould render it a dead letter in child-pornography prose-\ncutions of this type.\n   Denying restitution in cases like this would also be at\nodds with the penological purposes of §2259’s mandatory\nrestitution scheme. In a sense, every viewing of child\npornography is a repetition of the victim’s abuse. One\nreason to make restitution mandatory for crimes like this\nis to impress upon offenders that their conduct produces\nconcrete and devastating harms for real, identifiable\nvictims. See Kelly, supra, at 49, n. 10 (“Restitution is an\neffective rehabilitative penalty because it forces the de-\nfendant to confront, in concrete terms, the harm his ac-\ntions have caused”). It would be inconsistent with this\npurpose to apply the statute in a way that leaves offenders\nwith the mistaken impression that child-pornography\npossession (at least where the images are in wide circula-\ntion) is a victimless crime.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   If the statute by its terms required a showing of strict\nbut-for causation, these purposes would be beside the\npoint. But the text of the statute is not so limited. Al-\nthough Congress limited restitution to losses that are the\n“proximate result” of the defendant’s offense, such unelab-\norated causal language by no means requires but-for\ncausation by its terms. See Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 8) (courts need not read phrases like “results from”\nto require but-for causality where there is “textual or\ncontextual” reason to conclude otherwise). As the authori-\nties the Government and the victim cite show, the availa-\nbility of alternative causal standards where circumstances\nwarrant is, no less than the but-for test itself as a default,\npart of the background legal tradition against which Con-\ngress has legislated, cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). It\nwould be unacceptable to adopt a causal standard so strict\nthat it would undermine congressional intent where nei-\nther the plain text of the statute nor legal tradition de-\nmands such an approach.\n   In this special context, where it can be shown both that\na defendant possessed a victim’s images and that a victim\nhas outstanding losses caused by the continuing traffic in\nthose images but where it is impossible to trace a particu-\nlar amount of those losses to the individual defendant by\nrecourse to a more traditional causal inquiry, a court\napplying §2259 should order restitution in an amount that\ncomports with the defendant’s relative role in the causal\nprocess that underlies the victim’s general losses. The\namount would not be severe in a case like this, given the\nnature of the causal connection between the conduct of a\npossessor like Paroline and the entirety of the victim’s\ngeneral losses from the trade in her images, which are the\nproduct of the acts of thousands of offenders. It would not,\nhowever, be a token or nominal amount. The required\nrestitution would be a reasonable and circumscribed\naward imposed in recognition of the indisputable role of\n22              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe offender in the causal process underlying the victim’s\nlosses and suited to the relative size of that causal role.\nThis would serve the twin goals of helping the victim\nachieve eventual restitution for all her child-pornography\nlosses and impressing upon offenders the fact that child-\npornography crimes, even simple possession, affect real\nvictims.\n   There remains the question of how district courts should\ngo about determining the proper amount of restitution. At\na general level of abstraction, a court must assess as best\nit can from available evidence the significance of the indi-\nvidual defendant’s conduct in light of the broader causal\nprocess that produced the victim’s losses. This cannot be a\nprecise mathematical inquiry and involves the use of\ndiscretion and sound judgment. But that is neither unu-\nsual nor novel, either in the wider context of criminal\nsentencing or in the more specific domain of restitution. It\nis well recognized that district courts by necessity “exer-\ncise . . . discretion in fashioning a restitution order.”\n§3664(a). Indeed, a district court is expressly authorized\nto conduct a similar inquiry where multiple defendants\nwho have “contributed to the loss of a victim” appear\nbefore it. §3664(h). In that case it may “apportion liabil-\nity among the defendants to reflect the level of contribu-\ntion to the victim’s loss . . . of each defendant.” Ibid.\nAssessing an individual defendant’s role in the causal\nprocess behind a child-pornography victim’s losses does\nnot involve a substantially different or greater exercise of\ndiscretion.\n   There are a variety of factors district courts might con-\nsider in determining a proper amount of restitution, and it\nis neither necessary nor appropriate to prescribe a precise\nalgorithm for determining the proper restitution amount\nat this point in the law’s development.

These could include the\nnumber of past criminal defendants found to have con-\ntributed to the victim’s general losses; reasonable predic-\ntions of the number of future offenders likely to be caught\nand convicted for crimes contributing to the victim’s gen-\neral losses; any available and reasonably reliable estimate\nof the broader number of offenders involved (most of whom\nwill, of course, never be caught or convicted); whether the\ndefendant reproduced or distributed images of the victim;\nwhether the defendant had any connection to the initial\nproduction of the images; how many images of the victim\nthe defendant possessed; and other facts relevant to the\ndefendant’s relative causal role. See Brief for United\nStates 49.\n   These factors need not be converted into a rigid formula,\nespecially if doing so would result in trivial restitution\norders. They should rather serve as rough guideposts for\ndetermining an amount that fits the offense. The result-\ning amount fixed by the court would be deemed the\namount of the victim’s general losses that were the “prox-\nimate result of the offense” for purposes of §2259, and thus\nthe “full amount” of such losses that should be awarded.\nThe court could then set an appropriate payment schedule\nin consideration of the defendant’s financial means. See\n§3664(f)(2).\n   The victim says this approach is untenable because her\nlosses are “indivisible” in the sense that term is used by\ntort law, i.e., that there is no “reasonable basis for the\nfactfinder to determine . . . the amount of damages sepa-\nrately caused by” any one offender’s conduct. Restatement\n24              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability §26, p. 320\n(1999). The premise of her argument is that because it is\nin a sense a fiction to say Paroline caused $1,000 in losses,\n$10,000 in losses, or any other lesser amount, it is neces-\nsary to embrace the much greater fiction that Paroline\ncaused all the victim’s losses from the ongoing trade in her\nimages. But that is a non sequitur. The Court is required\nto define a causal standard that effects the statute’s pur-\nposes, not to apply tort-law concepts in a mechanical way\nin the criminal restitution context. Even if the victim’s\nlosses are fully “indivisible” in this sense (which is debata-\nble), treating Paroline as a proximate cause of all the\nvictim’s losses—especially in the absence of a workable\nsystem of contribution—stretches the fiction of aggregate\ncausation to its breaking point. Treating him as a cause of\na smaller amount of the victim’s general losses, taking\naccount of his role in the overall causal process behind\nthose losses, effects the statute’s purposes; avoids the\nnonsensical result of turning away victims emptyhanded;\nand does so without sacrificing the need for proportional-\nity in sentencing.\n   The victim also argues that this approach would consign\nher to “piecemeal” restitution and leave her to face “dec-\nades of litigation that might never lead to full recovery,”\nBrief for Respondent Amy 57, which “would convert Con-\ngress’s promise to child pornography victims into an empty\ngesture,” id., at 66. But Congress has not promised\nvictims full and swift restitution at all costs. To be sure,\nthe statute states a strong restitutionary purpose; but that\npurpose cannot be twisted into a license to hold a defend-\nant liable for an amount drastically out of proportion to\nhis own individual causal relation to the victim’s losses.\n   Furthermore, an approach of this sort better effects the\nneed to impress upon defendants that their acts are not\nirrelevant or victimless. As the Government observes,\nReply Brief for United States 18, it would undermine this\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Of course the victim\nshould someday collect restitution for all her child-\npornography losses, but it makes sense to spread payment\namong a larger number of offenders in amounts more\nclosely in proportion to their respective causal roles and\ntheir own circumstances so that more are made aware,\nthrough the concrete mechanism of restitution, of the\nimpact of child-pornography possession on victims.\n                             C\n   This approach is not without its difficulties. Restitution\norders should represent “an application of law,” not “a\ndecisionmaker’s caprice,” Philip Morris USA v. Williams,\n549 U. S. 346, 352 (2007) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted), and the approach articulated above involves discre-\ntion and estimation. But courts can only do their best to\napply the statute as written in a workable manner, faith-\nful to the competing principles at stake: that victims\nshould be compensated and that defendants should be\nheld to account for the impact of their conduct on those\nvictims, but also that defendants should be made liable for\nthe consequences and gravity of their own conduct, not the\nconduct of others. District courts routinely exercise wide\ndiscretion both in sentencing as a general matter and\nmore specifically in fashioning restitution orders. There is\nno reason to believe they cannot apply the causal standard\ndefined above in a reasonable manner without further\ndetailed guidance at this stage in the law’s elaboration.\nBased on its experience in prior cases of this kind, the\nGovernment—which, as noted above, see supra, at 5–6,\nbears the burden of proving the amount of the victim’s\nlosses, §3664(e)—could also inform district courts of resti-\ntution sought and ordered in other cases.\n26              PAROLINE v.

Unfortunately, the restitution statute that\nCongress wrote for child pornography offenses makes it\nimpossible to award that relief to Amy in this case. In-\nstead of tailoring the statute to the unique harms caused\nby child pornography, Congress borrowed a generic resti-\ntution standard that makes restitution contingent on the\nGovernment’s ability to prove, “by the preponderance of\nthe evidence,” “the amount of the loss sustained by a\nvictim as a result of ” the defendant’s crime. 18 U. S. C.\n§3664(e). When it comes to Paroline’s crime—possession\nof two of Amy’s images—it is not possible to do anything\nmore than pick an arbitrary number for that “amount.”\nAnd arbitrary is not good enough for the criminal law.\n   The Court attempts to design a more coherent restitu-\ntion system, focusing on “the defendant’s relative role in\nthe causal process that underlies the victim’s general\nlosses.” Ante, at 21. But this inquiry, sensible as it may\nbe, is not the one Congress adopted.

See Brief for United\nStates 25 (“it is practically impossible to know whether\n[Amy’s] losses would have been slightly lower if one were\nto subtract one defendant, or ten, or fifty”). I must regret-\nfully dissent.\n                               I\n   Section 2259(a) of Title 18 directs that a district court\n“shall order restitution for any offense under this chapter,”\nwhich includes Paroline’s offense of knowingly possessing\nchild pornography in violation of section 2252. In case\nCongress’s purpose were not clear from its use of “shall,”\nsection 2259(b)(4) then emphasizes that “[t]he issuance of\na restitution order under this section is mandatory.”\n   Section 2259(b)(1) spells out who may receive restitu-\ntion, and for what. It provides that “[t]he order of restitu-\ntion under this section shall direct the defendant to pay\nthe victim (through the appropriate court mechanism) the\nfull amount of the victim’s losses as determined by the\ncourt pursuant to [section 2259(b)(2)].” The term “ ‘vic-\ntim’ ” is defined as “the individual harmed as a result of a\ncommission of a crime under this chapter.” §2259(c). And\nthe term “ ‘full amount of the victim’s losses’ includes any\ncosts incurred by the victim for . . . medical services relat-\ning to physical, psychiatric, or psychological care”; “lost\nincome”; and “any other losses suffered by the victim as a\nproximate result of the offense.” §§2259(b)(3)(A), (D), (F).\n   Section 2259(b)(2) then describes how the district court\nmust calculate restitution. It provides that “[a]n order of\nrestitution under this section shall be issued and enforced\nin accordance with section 3664 in the same manner as an\norder under section 3663A.” Unlike section 2259, sections\n3663A and 3664 were not designed specifically for child\npornography offenses; they are part of the Mandatory\nVictims Restitution Act of 1996 and supply general resti-\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Most relevant\nhere, section 3664(e) provides that “[a]ny dispute as to the\nproper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by\nthe court by the preponderance of the evidence. The bur-\nden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by\na victim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney\nfor the Government.”\n                              A\n  As the Court explains, the statute allows restitution\nonly for those losses that were the “proximate result” of\nParoline’s offense. See ante, at 9–11 (citing §2259(b)(3)).\nContrary to Paroline’s argument, the proximate cause re-\nquirement is easily satisfied in this case. It was readily\nforeseeable that Paroline’s crime could cause Amy to\nsuffer precisely the types of losses that she claims: future\nlost wages, costs for treatment and counseling, and attor-\nney’s fees and costs, all of which are eligible losses enu-\nmerated in section 2259(b)(3). There is a “direct relation”\nbetween those types of injuries and Paroline’s “injurious\nconduct.” Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corpo-\nration, 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992). I therefore agree with\nthe Court that if Paroline actually caused those losses, he\nalso proximately caused them. See ante, at 12.\n  The more pressing problem is the statutory requirement\nof actual causation. See Burrage v. United States, 571\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6) (the ordinary meaning\nof the term “results from” requires proof that the defend-\nant’s conduct was the “actual cause” of the injury). Here\ntoo the Court correctly holds that the statute precludes the\nrestitution award sought by Amy and preferred by\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent, which would hold Paroline\nresponsible for Amy’s entire loss. See ante, at 16–19;\ncontra, post, at 7–16. Congress has authorized restitution\nonly for “the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a\nresult of the offense.” §3664(e). We have interpreted\n4                  PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nvirtually identical language, in the predecessor statute to\nsection 3664, to require “restitution to be tied to the loss\ncaused by the offense of conviction.” Hughey v. United\nStates, 495 U. S. 411, 418 (1990) (citing 18 U. S. C.\n§3580(a) (1982 ed.); emphasis added). That is, restitution\nmay not be imposed for losses caused by any other crime\nor any other defendant.1\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent dismisses section 3664(e),\nwhich is Congress’s direct answer to the very question\npresented by this case, namely, how to resolve a “dispute\nas to the proper amount . . . of restitution.” JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR thinks the answer to that question begins and\nends with the statement in section 2259(b)(1) that the\ndefendant must pay “the full amount of the victim’s losses.”\nSee post, at 1, 2, 10, 15. But losses from what? The\nanswer is found in the rest of that sentence: “the full\namount of the victim’s losses as determined by the court\npursuant to paragraph 2.” §2259(b)(1) (emphasis added).\n“[P]aragraph 2,” of course, instructs that “[a]n order of\nrestitution under this section shall be issued and enforced\nin accordance with section 3664 in the same manner as an\norder under section 3663A.” §2259(b)(2). And it is section\n3664 that provides the statute’s burden of proof and speci-\nfies that the defendant pay for those losses sustained “as a\nresult of the offense”—that is, his offense. §3664(e).\n   The offense of conviction here was Paroline’s possession\nof two of Amy’s images. No one suggests Paroline’s crime\n\n——————\n  1 In a case “where the loss is the product of the combined conduct of\n\nmultiple offenders,” post, at 7 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting), section\n3664(h) provides that a court may “make each defendant liable for\npayment of the full amount of restitution or may apportion liability\namong the defendants to reflect the level of contribution to the victim’s\nloss and economic circumstances of each defendant.” As the Court\nnotes, however, this provision applies only when multiple defendants\nare sentenced in the same proceeding, or charged under the same\nindictment.

Determining what amount the\nstatute does allow—the amount of Amy’s losses that Paro-\nline’s offense caused—is the real difficulty of this case.\nSee ante, at 12.\n                                B\n   Regrettably, Congress provided no mechanism for an-\nswering that question. If actual causation is to be deter-\nmined using the traditional, but-for standard, then the\nCourt acknowledges that “a showing of but-for causation\ncannot be made” in this case. Ante, at 12. Amy would\nhave incurred all of her lost wages and counseling costs\neven if Paroline had not viewed her images. The Govern-\nment and Amy respond by offering an “aggregate” causa-\ntion theory borrowed from tort law. But even if we apply\nthis “legal fiction,” ante, at 15, and assume, for purposes of\nargument, that Paroline’s crime contributed something to\nAmy’s total losses, that suffices only to establish causation\nin fact. It is not sufficient to award restitution under the\nstatute, which requires a further determination of the\namount that Paroline must pay. He must pay “the full\namount of the victim’s losses,” yes, but “as determined by”\nsection 3664—that is, the full amount of the losses he\ncaused. The Government has the burden to establish that\namount, and no one has suggested a plausible means for\nthe Government to carry that burden.2\n   The problem stems from the nature of Amy’s injury. As\nexplained, section 3664 is a general statute designed to\nprovide restitution for more common crimes, such as fraud\nand assault. The section 3664(e) standard will work just\n——————\n  2 The correct amount is not the one favored by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s\ndissent, which would hold Paroline liable for losses that he certainly\ndid not cause, without any right to seek contribution from others who\nharmed Amy.\n6                  PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfine for most crime victims, because it will usually not be\ndifficult to identify the harm caused by the defendant’s\noffense. The dispute will usually just be over the amount\nof the victim’s loss—for example, the value of lost assets or\nthe cost of a night in the hospital.\n   Amy has a qualitatively different injury. Her loss, while\nundoubtedly genuine, is a result of the collective actions of\na huge number of people—beginning with her uncle who\nabused her and put her images on the Internet, to the\ndistributors who make those images more widely avail-\nable, to the possessors such as Paroline who view her im-\nages. The harm to Amy was produced over time, gradually,\nby tens of thousands of persons acting independently from\none another.3       She suffers in particular from her\nknowledge that her images are being viewed online by an\nunknown number of people, and from her fear that any\nperson she meets might recognize her from having wit-\nnessed her abuse. App. 59–66. But Amy does not know\nwho Paroline is. Id., at 295, n. 11. Nothing in the record\ncomes close to establishing that Amy would have suffered\nless if Paroline had not possessed her images, let alone\nhow much less. See Brief for United States 25. Amy’s\ninjury is indivisible, which means that Paroline’s particu-\nlar share of her losses is unknowable. And yet it is proof\nof Paroline’s particular share that the statute requires.\n   By simply importing the generic restitution statute\nwithout accounting for the diffuse harm suffered by vic-\ntims of child pornography, Congress set up a restitution\nsystem sure to fail in cases like this one.

But Paroline has never met or interacted with any, or\nvirtually any, of the other persons who contributed to Amy’s injury, and\nhis possession offense did not aid or abet anyone.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

But when tens of thousands of copies (or\nmore) of Amy’s images have changed hands all across the\nworld for more than a decade, a demand for the Govern-\nment to prove “the amount of the loss sustained by a\nvictim as a result of the offense”—the offense before the\ncourt in any particular case—is a demand for the impos-\nsible. §3664(e) (emphasis added). When Congress con-\nditioned restitution on the Government’s meeting that\nburden of proof, it effectively precluded restitution in\nmost cases involving possession or distribution of child\npornography.\n                              II\n   The District Court in Paroline’s case found that the\nGovernment could not meet its statutory burden of proof.\nThe Government does not really contest that holding here;\nit instead asks to be held to a less demanding standard.\nHaving litigated this issue for years now in virtually every\nCircuit, the best the Government has come up with is to\ntell courts awarding restitution to look at what other\ncourts have done. But that is not a workable guide, not\nleast because courts have taken vastly different approaches\nto materially indistinguishable cases. According to the\nGovernment’s lodging in this case, District Courts award-\ning less than Amy’s full losses have imposed restitution\norders varying from $50 to $530,000.4 Restitution Awards\nfor Amy Through December 11, 2013, Lodging of United\nStates.

Even if that were a plausible way to design a resti-\ntution system for Amy’s complex injury, there is no way\naround the fact that it is not the system that Congress\ncreated. The statute requires restitution to be based\nexclusively on the losses that resulted from the defendant’s\ncrime—not on the defendant’s relative culpability. The\nmajority’s plan to situate Paroline along a spectrum of\noffenders who have contributed to Amy’s harm will not\nassist a district court in calculating the amount of Amy’s\nlosses—the amount of her lost wages and counseling\ncosts—that was caused by Paroline’s crime (or that of any\nother defendant).\n   The Court is correct, of course, that awarding Amy no\nrestitution would be contrary to Congress’s remedial and\npenological purposes.

Ante, at 23. In the first\nplace, only the last figure is relevant, because Paroline’s\nrelative significance can logically be measured only in\nlight of everyone who contributed to Amy’s injury—not\njust those who have been, or will be, caught and convicted.\nEven worse, to the extent it is possible to project the total\nnumber of persons who have viewed Amy’s images, that\nnumber is tragically large, which means that restitution\nawards tied to it will lead to a pitiful recovery in every\ncase. See Brief for Respondent Amy 65 (estimating Paro-\nline’s “ ‘market share’ ” of Amy’s harm at 1/71,000, or $47).\nThe majority says that courts should not impose “trivial\nrestitution orders,” ante, at 23, but it is hard to see how a\ncourt fairly assessing this defendant’s relative contribu-\ntion could do anything else.\n   Nor can confidence in judicial discretion save the statute\nfrom arbitrary application.

New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 758\n(1982). The traffic in images depicting a child’s sexual\nabuse, we have observed, “ ‘poses an even greater threat to\nthe child victim than does sexual abuse or prostitution’ ”\nbecause the victim must “ ‘go through life knowing that the\nrecording is circulating within the mass distribution sys-\ntem for child pornography.’ ” Id., at 759, n. 10. As we\nemphasized in a later case, the images cause “continuing\nharm by haunting the chil[d] in years to come.” Osborne v.\nOhio, 495 U. S. 103, 111 (1990).\n  Congress enacted 18 U. S. C. §2259 against this back-\ndrop. The statute imposes a “mandatory” duty on courts\nto order restitution to victims of federal offenses involving\nthe sexual abuse of children, including the possession of\nchild pornography. §2259(b)(4). And it commands that for\nany such offense, a court “shall direct the defendant to pay\nthe victim . . . the full amount of the victim’s losses.”\n§2259(b)(1).\n  The Court interprets this statute to require restitution\nin a “circumscribed” amount less than the “entirety of the\nvictim’s . . . losses,” a total it instructs courts to estimate\nbased on the defendant’s “relative role” in the victim’s\n2               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nharm. Ante, at 21. That amount, the Court holds, should\nbe neither “nominal” nor “severe.” Ibid.\n   I appreciate the Court’s effort to achieve what it per-\nceives to be a just result. It declines to require restitution\nfor a victim’s full losses, a result that might seem incon-\ngruent to an individual possessor’s partial role in a harm\nin which countless others have participated. And it rejects\nthe position advanced by Paroline and the dissenting\nopinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, which would result in no\nrestitution in cases like this for the perverse reason that a\nchild has been victimized by too many.\n   The Court’s approach, however, cannot be reconciled\nwith the law that Congress enacted. Congress mandated\nrestitution for the “full amount of the victim’s losses,”\n§2259(b)(1), and did so within the framework of settled\ntort law principles that treat defendants like Paroline\njointly and severally liable for the indivisible consequences\nof their intentional, concerted conduct. And to the extent\nan award for the full amount of a victim’s losses may lead\nto fears of unfair treatment for particular defendants,\nCongress provided a mechanism to accommodate those\nconcerns: Courts are to order “partial payments” on a\nperiodic schedule if the defendant’s financial circumstances\nor other “interest[s] of justice” so require. §§3664(f )(3),\n3572(d)(1). I would accordingly affirm the Fifth Circuit’s\nholding that the District Court “must enter a restitution\norder reflecting the ‘full amount of [Amy’s] losses,’ ” In re\nAmy Unknown, 701 F. 3d 749, 774 (2012), and instruct the\ncourt to consider a periodic payment schedule on remand.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  There are two distinct but related questions in this case:\nFirst, whether Paroline’s conduct bears a sufficient causal\nnexus to Amy’s harm, and second, if such a nexus exists,\nhow much restitution Paroline should be required to pay.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nBeginning with causation, I agree with the majority that\nproximate causation is beyond dispute because the medi-\ncal and economic losses suffered by Amy are “direct and\nforeseeable results of child-pornography crimes.” Ante, at\n12; accord, ante, at 3 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). The\nreal issue, then, is “the proper standard of causation in\nfact.” Ante, at 12 (majority opinion).\n   The majority and I share common ground on much of\nthis issue. We agree that the ordinary way to prove cause-\nin-fact is to show that a result would not have occurred\n“but for” the defendant’s conduct. Burrage v. United\nStates, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6). We also\nagree that “ ‘strict but-for causality’ ” is “ ‘not always re-\nquired,’ ” and that alternative standards of factual causa-\ntion are appropriate “where there is ‘textual or contextual’\nreason to conclude” as much. Ante, at 13, 21 (quoting\nBurrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8, 10). And most\nimportantly, we agree that there are ample reasons to\nreject a strict but-for causality requirement in §2259. See\nante, at 21.\n   Starting with the text, §2259 declares that a court “shall\norder restitution for any offense under this chapter.” The\npossession of child pornography, §2252, is an offense\nunder the relevant chapter, and the term “shall” creates\n“an obligation impervious to judicial discretion,” Lexecon\nInc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S.\n26, 35 (1998). So the text could not be clearer: A court\nmust order restitution against a person convicted of pos-\nsessing child pornography. Section 2259(b)(4) underscores\nthis directive by declaring that “[t]he issuance of a restitu-\ntion order under this section is mandatory.” And the\nstatute’s title—“mandatory restitution”—reinforces it\nfurther still.\n   Interpreting §2259 to require but-for causality would\nflout these simple textual commands. That is because “a\nshowing of but-for causation cannot be made” in this case\n4               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nand many like it. Ante, at 12. Even without Paroline’s\noffense, it is a regrettable fact that “thousands would have\nviewed and would in the future view [Amy’s] images,” such\nthat “it cannot be shown that her trauma and attendant\nlosses would have been any different but for Parolin[e].”\nId., at 13. A but-for requirement would thus make restitu-\ntion under §2259 the opposite of “mandatory”; it would\npreclude restitution to the victim of the typical child por-\nnography offense for the nonsensical reason that the child\nhas been victimized by too many.\n   Such an approach would transform §2259 into some-\nthing unrecognizable to the Congress that wrote it. When\nCongress passed §2259 in 1994, it was common knowledge\nthat child pornography victims suffer harm at the hands of\nnumerous offenders who possess their images in common,\nwhether in print, film, or electronic form. See, e.g.,\nShouvlin, Preventing the Sexual Exploitation of Children:\nA Model Act, 17 Wake Forest L. Rev. 535, 544 (1981)\n(describing the “enormous number of magazines” and\n“hundreds of films” produced each year depicting the\nsexual abuse of children, which were circulated to untold\nnumbers of offenders through a “well-organized distribu-\ntion system [that] ensures that even the small towns have\naccess to [the] material”); Doyle, FBI Probing Child Porn\non Computers, San Francisco Chronicle, Dec. 5, 1991,\np. A23 (describing complaint that “child pornographic pho-\ntographs” were circulating via the “America On-Line com-\nputer service”). Congress was also acutely aware of the\nsevere injuries that victims of child pornography suffer at\nthe hands of criminals who possess and view the recorded\nimages of their sexual abuse. Congress found, for exam-\nple, that the “continued existence” and circulation of child\npornography images “causes the child victims of sexual\nabuse continuing harm by haunting those children in\nfuture years.” Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996,\n§121, 110 Stat. 3009–26, Congressional Findings (2), notes\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

C. §2251 (hereinafter §2251 Findings).\nIt is inconceivable that Congress would have imposed a\nmandatory restitution obligation on the possessors who\ncontribute to these “continuing harm[s],” ibid., only\nto direct courts to apply a but-for cause requirement\nthat would prevent victims from actually obtaining any\nrecovery.\n   There is, of course, an alternative standard for deter-\nmining cause-in-fact that would be consistent with the\ntext of §2259 and the context in which it was enacted:\naggregate causation. As the majority points out, aggre-\ngate causation was, “no less than the but-for test itself,” a\n“part of the background legal tradition against which\nCongress” legislated. Ante, at 21. And under this stand-\nard, “ ‘[w]hen the conduct of two or more actors is so re-\nlated to an event that their combined conduct, viewed as a\nwhole, is a but-for cause of the event, and application of\nthe but-for rule to them individually would absolve all of\nthem, the conduct of each is a cause in fact of the event.’ ”\nAnte, at 14 (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.\nOwen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §41, p. 268 (5th\ned. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton)).1 Paroline and\nhis fellow offenders plainly qualify as factual causes under\nthis approach because Amy’s losses would not have oc-\ncurred but for their combined conduct, and because apply-\ning the but-for rule would excuse them all.\n   There is every reason to think Congress intended §2259\n\n——————\n   1 The Fifth Circuit recognized this standard more than 60 years ago\n\nwhen it observed that “ ‘[a]ccording to the great weight of authority\nwhere the concurrent or successive acts or omissions of two or more\npersons, although acting independently of each other, are in combina-\ntion, the direct or proximate cause of a single injury,’ ” any of them may\nbe held liable “ ‘even though his act alone might not have caused the\nentire injury, or the same damage might have resulted from the act of\nthe other tort-feasor[s].’ ” Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Hardee, 189 F. 2d\n205, 212 (1951) (quoting 38 Am. Jur. Negligence §257, p. 946 (1941)).\n6               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nto incorporate aggregate causation. Whereas a but-for\nrequirement would set §2259’s “mandatory” restitution\ncommand on a collision course with itself, the aggregate\ncausation standard follows directly from the statute.\nSection 2259 is unequivocal; it offers no safety-in-numbers\nexception for defendants who possess images of a child’s\nabuse in common with other offenders. And the aggregate\ncausation standard exists to avoid exactly that kind of\nexception. See Prosser and Keeton §41, at 268–269 (ag-\ngregate causation applies where multiple defendants\n“bea[r] a like relationship” to a victim’s injury, and where\n“[e]ach seeks to escape liability for a reason that, if recog-\nnized, would likewise protect each other defendant in the\ngroup, thus leaving the [victim] without a remedy in the face\nof the fact that had none of them acted improperly the\n[victim] would not have suffered the harm”); Restatement\n(Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional\nHarm §27, Comment f, p. 380 (2005) (similar).\n   At bottom, Congress did not intend §2259 to create a\nsafe harbor for those who inflict upon their victims the\nproverbial death by a thousand cuts. Given the very\nnature of the child pornography market—in which a large\nclass of offenders contribute jointly to their victims’ harm\nby trading in their images—a but-for causation require-\nment would swallow §2259’s “mandatory” restitution\ncommand, leaving victims with little hope of recovery.\nThat is all the “textual [and] contextual” reason necessary\nto conclude that Congress incorporated aggregate causa-\ntion into §2259. Burrage, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\n                            B\n  The dissent of THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests that a con-\ntrary conclusion is compelled by our decision in Hughey v.\nUnited States, 495 U. S. 411 (1990). Hughey involved a\ndefendant who had been convicted of a single count of\nunauthorized credit card use, which resulted in $10,412 in\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

The Government nonetheless re-\nquested restitution for additional losses based on different\ncounts in the indictment that the Government had agreed\nto dismiss. Id., at 413. We declined the Government’s\nrequest, reasoning that restitution was to be tied to the\noffense of conviction. Id., at 418.\n   That commonsense holding, of course, casts no doubt on\nthe ordinary practice of requiring restitution for losses\ncaused by an offense for which a defendant is convicted,\nwhere the loss is the product of the combined conduct of\nmultiple offenders. What troubles my colleagues in this\ncase, then, is not the concept of restitution in cases involv-\ning losses caused by more than one offender. Their objec-\ntion is instead to restitution in cases where the victim’s\nlosses are caused by too many offenders. As THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE puts it, Congress wrote a law that would enable\nAmy to recover if only her images had been circulated by\n“a single distributor” to just a “handful of possessors.”\nAnte, at 6–7. But because she has been victimized by\nnumerous distributors and thousands of possessors, she\ngets nothing. It goes without saying that Congress did not\nintend that result.\n   My colleagues in dissent next assert that no restitution\nmay be awarded because of §3664(e), which describes the\nGovernment’s burden of showing the “loss sustained by a\nvictim as a result of the offense.” But that provision is\nnothing close to a “direct answer” to this case. Ante, at 4.\nIt simply restates the question: What should a court do\nwhen the losses sustained by a victim are the “result of the\n[defendant’s] offense,” §3664(e), but that result is produced\nin combination with the offenses of others? One answer is\nthat the defendant’s offense is a cause-in-fact only of losses\nfor which it was a but-for cause. A second is that the\noffense is a cause-in-fact of losses for which it was part of\nthe aggregate cause. The former would preclude restitu-\ntion in cases like this; the latter would allow it. Given\n8                  PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nCongress’ “mandatory” command that courts “shall order\nrestitution for any offense,” §§2259(a), (b)(4), it is beyond\nclear which answer Congress chose.2\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent also fails to contend with\nthe ramifications of the suggestion that §3664(e) forecloses\nentry of restitution in cases where a victim suffers indi-\nvisible losses as a result of the aggregate conduct of nu-\nmerous offenders. It claims that this reading of §3664(e)\n“will work just fine” for “common crimes” such as assault.\nAnte, at 5–6. But what about a victim of a vicious gang\nassault, where a single offender’s conduct cannot be la-\nbeled a but-for cause of any discrete injury? Such offenses\nare, unfortunately, all too common. See, e.g., Wheelock v.\nUnited States, 2013 WL 2318145, *2 (ED Wisc., May 28,\n2013) (defendant convicted for his participation in a gang\nrape of a 13-year-old victim in which he “and several other\nindividuals had provided alcohol to the girl and, after she\nbecame intoxicated and unconscious, sexually assaulted\nher”); United States v. Homer B., 1990 WL 79705 (CA9,\nJune 14, 1990) (similar). I would have thought it beyond\nrefute that the victim of such a tragic offense would be\nentitled to restitution even though none of her losses may\nbe attributed solely to any individual defendant. If the\nopinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE is in agreement, it does not\nexplain why the result should be any different for victims\nlike Amy, who have suffered heart wrenching losses at the\n——————\n    2 THE\n        CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent elides the distinction between aggre-\ngate and but-for causation. Despite “assum[ing], for purposes of argu-\nment,” that §2259 incorporates aggregate causation, the dissent never-\ntheless applies but-for causation to determine the “full amount” of\nlosses Paroline must pay. See ante, at 5, and n. 2 (arguing that Paro-\nline can only be asked to pay “the full amount of the losses he caused,”\nnot losses that he and others combined to cause). My dissenting\ncolleagues cannot have it both ways. Either §2259 incorporates aggre-\ngate causation (in which case the full amount of Amy’s losses is all of\nthe losses aggregately caused by Paroline and like offenders), or it\nrequires but-for causation (in which case Amy gets nothing).\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

But the majority resists the “strict\nlogic” of aggregate causation for fear that doing so would\nproduce the “striking outcome” of an award against an\nindividual possessor “for the entire aggregately caused\namount.” Ante, at 15–16. The majority accordingly holds\nthat “a court applying §2259 should order restitution in an\namount that comports with the defendant’s relative”\ncontribution to “the victim’s general losses.” Ante, at 21.\n    The majority’s apportionment approach appears to be a\nsensible one. It would, for instance, further the goal of\n“proportionality in sentencing,” avoid “turning away vic-\ntims emptyhanded,” and “spread payment among” offend-\ners. Ante, at 24–25. But it suffers from a far more funda-\nmental problem: It contravenes the language Congress\nactually used. Section 2259 directs courts to enter restitu-\ntion not for a “proportional” or “relative” amount, but for\n\n——————\n  3 THE CHIEF JUSTICE objects that gang assaults are not a “fair analogy”\n\nbecause they involve a group of individuals acting “together, with a\ncommon plan.” Ante, at 6, n. 3. But individuals need not act together\nto trigger joint and several liability; such liability applies equally to\nmultiple actors who independently commit intentional torts that\ncombine to produce an indivisible injury. Infra, at 11–14. And in any\nevent, the offenders at issue in this case do act together, with the\ncommon end of trafficking in the market for images of child sexual\nabuse. See infra, at 12–13. While these offenders may not be physi-\ncally in the same room when they commit their crimes, there is no rea-\nson to read §2259(b)(4)’s “mandatory” restitution command out of the\nstatute for child abusers who hide behind the anonymity of a computer\nscreen.\n10              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe “full amount of the victim’s losses.” §2259(b)(1). That\ncommand is unequivocal, and it is buttressed by the tort\nlaw tradition of joint and several liability within which\nCongress legislated.\n                             A\n   Once a defendant is found to bear a sufficient causal\nnexus to a victim’s harm, §2259 provides a straightfor-\nward instruction on how much restitution a court is to\norder: “The order of restitution under this section shall\ndirect the defendant to pay the victim . . . the full amount\nof the victim’s losses.” §2259(b)(1). Because the word\n“shall” imposes a “discretionless obligatio[n],” Lopez v.\nDavis, 531 U. S. 230, 241 (2001), a court considering a\n§2259 restitution request has no license to deviate from\nthe statute’s command. It must enter an order for the “full\namount of the victim’s losses,” regardless of whether other\ndefendants may have contributed to the same victim’s\nharm.\n   If there were any doubt on the matter, Congress elimi-\nnated it in §2259(b)(4)(B)(ii), which bars a court from\n“declin[ing] to issue [a restitution] order under this sec-\ntion” on the ground that a victim “is entitled to receive\ncompensation for his or her injuries from the proceeds of\ninsurance or any other source.” One “other source” from\nwhich a victim would be “entitled to receive compensation”\nis, of course, other offenders who possess images of her\nsexual abuse. It is unthinkable that Congress would have\nexpressly forbidden courts to award victims no restitution\nbecause their harms have been aggregately caused by\nmany offenders, only to permit restitution orders for a\nsingle penny for the same reason.\n                            B\n  As the majority recognizes, Congress did not draft §2259\nin a vacuum; it did so in the context of settled tort law\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S. 280, 285 (2003) (Congress “legislates against a\nlegal background of ordinary tort-related” principles).\nSection 2259 functions as a tort statute, one designed to\nensure that victims will recover compensatory damages in\nan efficient manner concurrent with criminal proceedings.\nSee Restatement of Torts §901, p. 537 (1939) (the purposes\nof tort law include “to give compensation, indemnity, or\nrestitution for harms” and “to punish wrongdoers”); Dolan\nv. United States, 560 U. S. 605, 612 (2010) (the “substan-\ntive purpose” of the related Mandatory Victims Restitution\nAct of 1996, §3664, is “to ensure that victims of a crime\nreceive full restitution”). And the nature of the child\npornography industry and the indivisible quality of the\ninjuries suffered by its victims make this a paradigmatic\nsituation in which traditional tort law principles would\nrequire joint and several liability. By requiring restitution\nfor the “full amount of the victim’s losses,” §2259(b)(1),\nCongress did not depart from these principles; it embraced\nthem.\n   First, the injuries caused by child pornography posses-\nsors are impossible to apportion in any practical sense. It\ncannot be said, for example, that Paroline’s offense alone\nrequired Amy to attend five additional minutes of therapy,\nor that it caused some discrete portion of her lost income.\nThe majority overlooks this fact, ordering courts to sur-\nmise some “circumscribed” amount of loss based on a list\nof factors. Ante, at 21, 22–23; see also ante, at 7–10\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). Section 2259’s full restitu-\ntion requirement dispenses with this guesswork, however,\nand in doing so it harmonizes with the settled tort law\ntradition concerning indivisible injuries. As this Court\nexplained this rule in Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale\nTransatlantique, 443 U. S. 256 (1979), unless a plaintiff ’s\n“injury is divisible and the causation of each part can be\nseparately assigned to each tortfeasor,” the rule is that a\n12               PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n“tortfeasor is not relieved of liability for the entire harm\nhe caused just because another’s negligence was also a\nfactor in effecting the injury.” Id., at 260, n. 8; see also\nProsser and Keeton §52, at 347 (joint and several liability\napplies to injuries that “are obviously incapable of any\nreasonable or practical division”); Feneff v. Boston &\nMaine R. Co., 196 Mass. 575, 580, 82 N. E. 705, 707 (1907)\n(similar).\n   Second, Congress adopted §2259 against the backdrop of\nthe rule governing concerted action by joint tortfeasors,\nwhich specifies that “[w]here two or more [tortfeasors] act\nin concert, it is well settled . . . that each will be liable for\nthe entire result.” Prosser and Keeton §52, at 346. The\ndegree of concerted action required by the rule is not\ninordinate; “if one person acts to produce injury with full\nknowledge that others are acting in a similar manner and\nthat his conduct will contribute to produce a single harm,\na joint tort has been consummated even when there is no\nprearranged plan.” 1 F. Harper, F. James, & O. Gray, The\nLaw of Torts §10.1, p. 699 (1st ed. 1956) (hereinafter 1\nHarper and James); see also, e.g., Troop v. Dew, 150 Ark.\n560, 565, 234 S.

As Congress itself recognized, “posses-\nsors of such material” are an integral part of the “market\nfor the sexual exploitative use of children.” §2251 Finding\n(12).

By communally browsing and downloading\nInternet child pornography, offenders like Paroline “fuel\nthe process” that allows the industry to flourish.\nO’Connell, Paedophiles Networking on the Internet, in\nChild Abuse on the Internet: Ending the Silence 77 (C.\nArnaldo ed. 2001). Indeed, one expert describes Internet\nchild pornography networks as “an example of a complex\ncriminal conspiracy,” ibid.—the quintessential concerted\naction to which joint and several liability attaches.\n  Lastly, §2259’s full restitution requirement conforms to\nwhat Congress would have understood to be the uniform\nrule governing joint and several liability for intentional\ntorts. Under that rule, “[e]ach person who commits a tort\nthat requires intent is jointly and severally liable for any\nindivisible injury legally caused by the tortious conduct.”\nRestatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability\n§12, p. 110 (2007). There is little doubt that the posses-\nsion of images of a child being sexually abused would\namount to an intentional invasion of privacy tort—and an\nextreme one at that. See Restatement (Second) of Torts\n§652B, p. 378 (1976) (“One who intentionally intrudes,\nphysically or otherwise, upon [another’s] private affairs or\nconcerns, is subject to liability . . . if the intrusion would\nbe highly offensive to a reasonable person”).4\n——————\n   4 Possession of child pornography under §2252 constitutes an inten-\n\ntional tort notwithstanding that the offense requires a mens rea of\nknowledge. See §2252(a)(3)(B) (punishing one who “knowingly sells or\npossesses” child pornography). One is “said to act knowingly if he is\naware ‘ “that [a] result is practically certain to follow from his con-\nduct.” ’ ” United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 404 (1980). That\ndefinition is, if anything, more exacting than the kind of “intent”\nrequired for an intentional tort under the Restatement, which defines\n“intent” to include situations where an actor “believes that . . . conse-\nquences are substantially certain to result from [his act].” Restatement\n14                  PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Section 2259’s imposition of joint and several liability\nmakes particular sense when viewed in light of this inten-\ntional tort rule. For at the end of the day, the question of\nhow to allocate losses among defendants is really a choice\nbetween placing the risk of loss on the defendants (since\none who is caught first may be required to pay more than\nhis fair share) or the victim (since an apportionment re-\ngime would risk preventing her from obtaining full recov-\nery). Whatever the merits of placing the risk of loss on a\nvictim in the context of a negligence-based offense, Con-\ngress evidently struck the balance quite differently in this\ncontext, placing the risk on the morally culpable posses-\nsors of child pornography and not their innocent child\nvictims.\n                              C\n   Notwithstanding §2259’s text and the longstanding tort\nlaw traditions that support it, the majority adopts an\napportionment approach based on its concern that joint\nand several liability might lead to unfairness as applied to\nindividual defendants. See ante, at 15–22. The majority\nfinds this approach necessary because §2259 does not\nprovide individual defendants with the ability to seek\ncontribution from other offenders. Ante, at 17–18. I agree\nthat the statute does not create a cause of action for con-\ntribution, but unlike the majority I do not think the ab-\nsence of contribution suggests that Congress intended the\nphrase “full amount of the victim’s losses” to mean some-\nthing less than that. For instead of expending judicial\nresources on disputes between intentional tortfeasors,\nCongress crafted a different mechanism for preventing\ninequitable treatment of individual defendants—the use of\nperiodic payment schedules.\n   Section 2259(b)(2) directs that “[a]n order of restitution\n—————— \n\n(Second) of Torts §8A, p. 15 (1965). \n\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nunder this section shall be issued and enforced in accord-\nance with section 3664.” Section 3664(f )(1)(A) in turn\nreiterates §2259’s command that courts “shall order resti-\ntution to each victim in the full amount of each victim’s\nlosses.” But §3664 goes on to distinguish between the\namount of restitution ordered and the schedule on which\npayments are to be made. Thus, §3664(f )(2) states that a\ncourt “shall . . . specify in the restitution order . . . the\nschedule according to whic[h] the restitution is to be paid,”\nand §3664(f)(3)(A) provides that “[a] restitution order may\ndirect the defendant to make a single, lump sum payment”\nor “partial payments at specified intervals.” Critically, in\nchoosing between lump-sum and partial payments, courts\n“shall” consider “the financial resources and other assets\nof the defendant,” along with “any financial obligations\nof the defendant, including obligations to dependents.”\n§§3664(f )(2)(A), (C).\n   Applying these factors to set an appropriate payment\nschedule in light of any individual child pornography\npossessor’s financial circumstances would not be difficult;\nindeed, there is already a robust body of case law clarify-\ning how payment schedules are to be set under §3664(f ).\nFor example, Courts of Appeals have uniformly found it an\nabuse of discretion to require defendants to make immedi-\nate lump-sum payments for the full amount of a restitu-\ntion award when they do not have the ability to do so. In\nsuch cases, Congress has instead required courts to im-\npose periodic payment schedules. See, e.g., United States\nv. McGlothlin, 249 F. 3d 783, 784 (CA8 2001) (reversing\nlump-sum payment order where defendant “had no ability\nto pay the restitution immediately,” and requiring District\nCourt to set a periodic payment schedule); United States v.\nMyers, 198 F. 3d 160, 168–169 (CA5 1999) (same). The\nexisting body of law also provides guidance as to proper\npayment schedules. Compare, e.g., United States v. Cal-\nbat, 266 F. 3d 358, 366 (CA5 2001) (annual payment of\n16              PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n$41,000 an abuse of discretion where defendant had a net\nworth of $6,400 and yearly income of $39,000), with United\nStates v. Harris, 60 F. Supp. 2d 169, 180 (SDNY 1999)\n(setting payment schedule for the greater of $35 per\nmonth or 10% of defendant’s gross income).\n   Section 3664’s provision for partial periodic payments\nthus alleviates any concerns of unfairness for the vast\nnumber of child pornography defendants who have modest\nfinancial resources. A more difficult challenge is presented,\nhowever, by the case of a wealthy defendant who would\nbe able to satisfy a large restitution judgment in an imme-\ndiate lump-sum payment. But the statute is fully capable\nof ensuring just results for these defendants, too. For in\naddition to an offender’s financial circumstances, §3664\npermits courts to consider other factors “in the interest of\njustice” when deciding whether to impose a payment\nschedule. See §3664(f )(2) (district court shall specify\npayment schedule “pursuant to section 3572”); §3572(d)(1)\n(restitution order shall be payable in periodic installments\nif “in the interest of justice”).\n   Accordingly, in the context of a restitution order against\na wealthy child pornography possessor, it would likely be\nin the interest of justice for a district court to set a pay-\nment schedule requiring the defendant to pay restitution\nin amounts equal to the periodic losses that the district\ncourt finds will actually be “incurred by the victim,”\n§2259(b)(3), in the given timeframe. In this case, for\nexample, Amy’s expert estimates that she will suffer\napproximately $3.4 million in losses from medical costs\nand lost income over the next 60 years of her life, or ap-\nproximately $56,000 per year. If that estimate is deemed\naccurate, a court would enter a restitution order against a\nwealthy defendant for the full $3.4 million amount of\nAmy’s losses, and could make it payable on an annual\nschedule of $56,000 per year. Doing so would serve the\ninterest of justice because the periodic payment schedule\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   17\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwould allow the individual wealthy defendant’s ultimate\nburden to be substantially offset by payments made by\nother offenders,5 while the entry of the full restitution\naward would provide certainty to Amy that she will be\nmade whole for her losses.\n                          *     *     *\n   Although I ultimately reach a different conclusion as to\nthe proper interpretation of the statutory scheme, I do\nappreciate the caution with which the Court has an-\nnounced its approach. For example, the Court expressly\nrejects the possibility of district courts entering restitution\norders for “token or nominal amount[s].” Ante, at 21.\nThat point is important because, if taken out of context,\naspects of the Court’s opinion might be construed other-\nwise. For instance, the Court states that in estimating a\nrestitution amount, a district court may consider “the\nbroader number of offenders involved (most of whom will,\nof course, never be caught or convicted).” Ante, at 23. If\nthat factor is given too much weight, it could lead to ex-\nactly the type of trivial restitution awards the Court dis-\nclaims. Amy’s counsel has noted, for instance, that in\nlight of the large number of persons who possess her im-\nages, a truly proportional approach to restitution would\n——————\n   5 As the facts of this case show, the offset would be significant. Be-\n\ntween June 2009 and December 11, 2013, Amy obtained restitution\nawards from 182 persons, 161 of whom were ordered to pay an amount\nbetween $1,000 and $530,000. See Restitution Awards for Amy\nThrough December 11, 2013, Lodging of United States. If these offend-\ners (and new offenders caught each month) were instead ordered to pay\nthe full amount of restitution in periodic amounts according to their\nfinancial means, a wealthy defendant’s annual obligation would termi-\nnate long before he would be required to pay anything close to the full\n$3.4 million. For once a victim receives the full amount of restitution,\nall outstanding obligations expire because §2259 does not displace the\nsettled joint and several liability rule forbidding double recovery. See\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §885(3) (1979), see also, e.g., United\nStates v. Nucci, 364 F. 3d 419, 423 (CA2 2004).\n18                PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nlead to an award of just $47 against any individual de-\nfendant. Brief for Respondent Amy 65. Congress obviously\ndid not intend that outcome, and the Court wisely refuses\nto permit it.6\n   In the end, of course, it is Congress that will have the\nfinal say. If Congress wishes to recodify its full restitution\ncommand, it can do so in language perhaps even more\nclear than §2259’s “mandatory” directive to order restitu-\ntion for the “full amount of the victim’s losses.” Congress\nmight amend the statute, for example, to include the term\n“aggregate causation.” Alternatively, to avoid the uncer-\ntainty in the Court’s apportionment approach, Congress\nmight wish to enact fixed minimum restitution amounts.\nSee, e.g., §2255 (statutorily imposed $150,000 minimum\ncivil remedy). In the meanwhile, it is my hope that the\nCourt’s approach will not unduly undermine the ability of\nvictims like Amy to recover for—and from—the unfathom-\nable harms they have sustained.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  6 The Court mentions that Amy received roughly $6,000 from her\n\nuncle, the person responsible for abusing her as a child. Ante, at 2.\nCare must be taken in considering the amount of the award against\nAmy’s uncle, however, ante, at 23, because as Amy’s expert explained,\nAmy was “back to normal” by the end of her treatment for the initial\noffense. App. 70. It was chiefly after discovering, eight years later,\nthat images of her sexual abuse had spread on the Internet that Amy\nsuffered additional losses due to the realization that possessors like\nParoline were viewing them and that “the sexual abuse of her has\nnever really ended.” Id., at 71.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2670966/", "sha1": "9b0a52fa8a8a0979e5151c417f24c24c65d7b493", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-038", "time_retrieved": "2014-04-23T07:31:27.617220"}
