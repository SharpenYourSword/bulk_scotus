Argued February 26, 2014\u2014Decided April 29, 2014\nThe Patent Act\u2019s fee-shifting provision authorizes district courts to\n  award attorney\u2019s fees to prevailing parties in \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d 35\n  U. S. C. \u00a7285. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int\u2019l, Inc.,\n  393 F. 3d 1378, 1381, the Federal Circuit defined an \u201cexceptional\n  case\u201d as one which either involves \u201cmaterial inappropriate conduct\u201d\n  or is both \u201cobjectively baseless\u201d and \u201cbrought in subjective bad faith.\u201d\n  Brooks Furniture also requires that parties establish the \u201cexception-\n  al\u201d nature of a case by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id., at 1382.\n     Respondent ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., sued petitioner Octane\n  Fitness, LLC, for patent infringement. The District Court granted\n  summary judgment to Octane. Octane then moved for attorney\u2019s fees\n  under \u00a7285. The District Court denied the motion under the Brooks\n  Furniture framework, finding ICON\u2019s claim to be neither objectively\n  baseless nor brought in subjective bad faith. The Federal Circuit af-\n  firmed.\nHeld: The Brooks Furniture framework is unduly rigid and impermissi-\n bly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.\n Pp. 7\u201312.\n    (a) Section 285 imposes one and only one constraint on district\n courts\u2019 discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees: The power is reserved for\n \u201cexceptional\u201d cases. Because the Patent Act does not define \u201cexcep-\n tional,\u201d the term is construed \u201cin accordance with [its] ordinary\n meaning.\u201d Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___. In 1952, when Con-\n gress used the word in \u00a7285 (and today, for that matter),\n \u201c[e]xceptional\u201d meant \u201cuncommon,\u201d \u201crare,\u201d or \u201cnot ordinary.\u201d Web-\n ster\u2019s New International Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934). An \u201cexcep-\n tional\u201d case, then, is simply one that stands out from others with re-\n2     OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    spect to the substantive strength of a party\u2019s litigating position (con-\n    sidering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the un-\n    reasonable manner in which the case was litigated. District courts\n    may determine whether a case is \u201cexceptional\u201d in the case-by-case\n    exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circum-\n    stances. Cf. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517. Pp. 7\u20138.\n       (b) The Brooks Furniture framework superimposes an inflexible\n    framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible. Pp. 8\u201311.\n         (1) Brooks Furniture is too restrictive in defining the two catego-\n    ries of cases in which fee awards are allowed. The first category\u2014\n    cases involving litigation or certain other misconduct\u2014appears to ex-\n    tend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. But that is not\n    the appropriate benchmark. A district court may award fees in the\n    rare case in which a party\u2019s unreasonable, though not independently\n    sanctionable, conduct is so \u201cexceptional\u201d as to justify an award. For\n    litigation to fall within the second category, a district court must de-\n    termine that the litigation is both objectively baseless and brought in\n    subjective bad faith. But a case presenting either subjective bad\n    faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself\n    apart from mine-run cases to be \u201cexceptional.\u201d The Federal Circuit\n    imported this second category from Professional Real Estate Inves-\n    tors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49, but that\n    case\u2019s standard finds no roots in \u00a7285\u2019s text and makes little sense in\n    the context of the exceptional-case determination. Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (2) Brooks Furniture is so demanding that it would appear to\n    render \u00a7285 largely superfluous. Because courts already possess the\n    inherent power to award fees in cases involving misconduct or bad\n    faith, see Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S.\n    240, 258\u2013259, this Court has declined to construe fee-shifting provi-\n    sions narrowly so as to avoid rendering them superfluous. See, e.g.,\n    Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419. Pp. 10\u201311.\n         (3) Brooks Furniture\u2019s requirement that proof of entitlement to\n    fees be made by clear and convincing evidence is not justified by\n    \u00a7285, which imposes no specific evidentiary burden. Nor has this\n    Court interpreted comparable fee-shifting statutes to require such a\n    burden of proof. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510 U. S, at 519. P. 11.\n496 Fed.

It provides,\nin its entirety, that \u201c[t]he court in exceptional cases may\naward reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d\n35 U. S. C. \u00a7285. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Du\u00ad\ntailier Int\u2019l, Inc., 393 F. 3d 1378 (2005), the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that \u201c[a] case\nmay be deemed exceptional\u201d under \u00a7285 only in two lim-\nited circumstances: \u201cwhen there has been some material\ninappropriate conduct,\u201d or when the litigation is both\n\u201cbrought in subjective bad faith\u201d and \u201cobjectively base-\nless.\u201d Id., at 1381. The question before us is whether the\nBrooks Furniture framework is consistent with the statu-\ntory text. We hold that it is not.\n                           I\n                          A\n  Prior to 1946, the Patent Act did not authorize the\nawarding of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * JUSTICE SCALIA joins this opinion except as to footnotes 1\u20133.\n2   OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v.

S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). In 1946, Congress amended the\nPatent Act to add a discretionary fee-shifting provision,\nthen codified in \u00a770, which stated that a court \u201cmay in its\ndiscretion award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevail-\ning party upon the entry of judgment in any patent case.\u201d\n35 U. S. C. \u00a770 (1946 ed.).1\n    Courts did not award fees under \u00a770 as a matter of\ncourse. They viewed the award of fees not \u201cas a penalty\nfor failure to win a patent infringement suit,\u201d but as ap-\npropriate \u201conly in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d Park-In-\nTheatres, Inc. v. Perkins, 190 F. 2d 137, 142 (CA9 1951).\nThe provision enabled them to address \u201cunfairness or bad\nfaith in the conduct of the losing party, or some other\nequitable consideration of similar force,\u201d which made a\ncase so unusual as to warrant fee-shifting. Ibid.; see also\nPennsylvania Crusher Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 193 F.\n2d 445, 451 (CA3 1951) (listing as \u201cadequate justifica-\ntion[s]\u201d for fee awards \u201cfraud practiced on the Patent\nOffice or vexatious or unjustified litigation\u201d).\n    Six years later, Congress amended the fee-shifting\nprovision and recodified it as \u00a7285. Whereas \u00a770 had\nspecified that a district court could \u201cin its discretion award\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party,\u201d the\nrevised language of \u00a7285 (which remains in force today)\nprovides that \u201c[t]he court in exceptional cases may award\nreasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d We have\nobserved, in interpreting the damages provision of the\nPatent Act, that the addition of the phrase \u201cexceptional\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 This provision did \u201cnot contemplat[e] that the recovery of attorney\u2019s\n\nfees [would] become an ordinary thing in patent suits . . . .\u201d S. Rep. No.\n79\u20131503, p. 2 (1946).\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncases\u201d to \u00a7285 was \u201cfor purposes of clarification only.\u201d2\nGeneral Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., 461 U. S. 648, 653,\nn. 8 (1983); see also id., at 652, n. 6. And the parties agree\nthat the recodification did not substantively alter the\nmeaning of the statute.3\n   For three decades after the enactment of \u00a7285, courts\napplied it\u2014as they had applied \u00a770\u2014in a discretionary\nmanner, assessing various factors to determine whether a\ngiven case was sufficiently \u201cexceptional\u201d to warrant a fee\naward. See, e.g., True Temper Corp. v. CF&I Steel Corp.,\n601 F. 2d 495, 508\u2013509 (CA10 1979); Kearney & Trecker\nCorp. v. Giddings & Lewis, Inc., 452 F. 2d 579, 597 (CA7\n1971); Siebring v. Hansen, 346 F. 2d 474, 480\u2013481 (CA8\n1965).\n   In 1982, Congress created the Federal Circuit and vested\nit with exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases.\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71295. In the two decades that followed, the\nFederal Circuit, like the regional circuits before it, in-\nstructed district courts to consider the totality of the cir-\ncumstances when making fee determinations under \u00a7285.\nSee, e.g., Rohm & Haas Co. v. Crystal Chemical Co., 736\nF. 2d 688, 691 (1984) (\u201cCases decided under \u00a7285 have\nnoted that \u2018the substitution of the phrase \u201cin exceptional\ncases\u201d has not done away with the discretionary feature\u2019 \u201d);\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Senate Report similarly explained that the new provision was\n\n\u201csubstantially the same as\u201d \u00a770, and that the \u201c \u2018exceptional cases\u2019 \u201d\nlanguage was added simply to \u201cexpres[s] the intention of the [1946]\nstatute as shown by its legislative history and as interpreted by the\ncourts.\u201d S. Rep. No. 82\u20131979, p. 30 (1952).\n  3 See Brief for Petitioner 35 (\u201c[T]his amendment was not intended to\n\ncreate a stricter standard for fee awards, but instead was intended to\nclarify and endorse the already-existing statutory standard\u201d); Brief for\nRespondent 17 (\u201cWhen it enacted \u00a7285, as the historical notes to this\nprovision make clear, Congress adopted the standards applied by courts\ninterpreting that statute\u2019s predecessor, \u00a770 of the 1946 statute. Con-\ngress explained that \u00a7285 \u2018is substantially the same as the correspond-\ning provision in\u2019 \u00a770\u201d).\n4     OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nYamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. v. Danbury Phar\u00ad\nmacal, Inc., 231 F. 3d 1339, 1347 (2000) (\u201cIn assessing\nwhether a case qualifies as exceptional, the district court\nmust look at the totality of the circumstances\u201d).\n   In 2005, however, the Federal Circuit abandoned that\nholistic, equitable approach in favor of a more rigid and\nmechanical formulation. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v.\nDutailier Int\u2019l, Inc., 393 F. 3d 1378 (2005), the court held\nthat a case is \u201cexceptional\u201d under \u00a7285 only \u201cwhen there\nhas been some material inappropriate conduct related to\nthe matter in litigation, such as willful infringement,\nfraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent,\nmisconduct during litigation, vexatious or unjustified\nlitigation, conduct that violates Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, or like\ninfractions.\u201d Id., at 1381. \u201cAbsent misconduct in conduct\nof the litigation or in securing the patent,\u201d the Federal\nCircuit continued, fees \u201cmay be imposed against the pa-\ntentee only if both (1) the litigation is brought in subjec-\ntive bad faith, and (2) the litigation is objectively base-\nless.\u201d Ibid. The Federal Circuit subsequently clarified\nthat litigation is objectively baseless only if it is \u201cso unrea-\nsonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it would\nsucceed,\u201d iLOR, LLC v. Google, Inc., 631 F. 3d 1372, 1378\n(2011), and that litigation is brought in subjective bad\nfaith only if the plaintiff \u201cactually know[s]\u201d that it is objec-\ntively baseless, id., at 1377.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 In\n       Kilopass Technology, Inc. v. Sidense Corp., 738 F. 3d 1302 (CA\nFed 2013)\u2014decided after our grant of certiorari but before we heard\noral argument in this case\u2014the Federal Circuit appeared to cut back on\nthe \u201csubjective bad faith\u201d inquiry, holding that the language in iLOR\nwas dictum and that \u201cactual knowledge of baselessness is not required.\u201d\n738 F. 3d, at 1310. Rather, the court held, \u201ca defendant need only\nprove reckless conduct to satisfy the subjective component of the \u00a7285\nanalysis,\u201d ibid., and courts may \u201cdra[w] an inference of bad faith from\ncircumstantial evidence thereof when a patentee pursues claims that\nare devoid of merit,\u201d id., at 1311. Most importantly, the Federal Circuit\nstated that \u201c[o]bjective baselessness alone can create a sufficient\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Finally, Brooks Furniture held that because \u201c[t]here is a\npresumption that the assertion of infringement of a duly\ngranted patent is made in good faith[,] . . . the underlying\nimproper conduct and the characterization of the case as\nexceptional must be established by clear and convincing\nevidence.\u201d 393 F. 3d, at 1382.\n                               B\n   The parties to this litigation are manufacturers of exer-\ncise equipment. The respondent, ICON Health & Fitness,\nInc., owns U. S. Patent No. 6,019,710 (\u2019710 patent), which\ndiscloses an elliptical exercise machine that allows for\nadjustments to fit the individual stride paths of users.\nICON is a major manufacturer of exercise equipment, but\nit has never commercially sold the machine disclosed in\nthe \u2019710 patent. The petitioner, Octane Fitness, LLC, also\nmanufactures exercise equipment, including elliptical\nmachines known as the Q45 and Q47.\n   ICON sued Octane, alleging that the Q45 and Q47\ninfringed several claims of the \u2019710 patent. The District\nCourt granted Octane\u2019s motion for summary judgment,\nconcluding that Octane\u2019s machines did not infringe ICON\u2019s\npatent. 2011 WL 2457914 (D Minn., June 17, 2011).\nOctane then moved for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7285. Apply-\ning the Brooks Furniture standard, the District Court\ndenied Octane\u2019s motion. 2011 WL 3900975 (D Minn.,\nSept. 6, 2011). It determined that Octane could show\nneither that ICON\u2019s claim was objectively baseless nor\nthat ICON had brought it in subjective bad faith. As to\nobjective baselessness, the District Court rejected Octane\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ninference of bad faith to establish exceptionality under \u00a7285, unless the \n\ncircumstances as a whole show a lack of recklessness on the patentee\u2019s \n\npart.\u201d Id., at 1314. Chief Judge Rader wrote a concurring opinion that\n\nsharply criticized Brooks Furniture, 738 F. 3d, at 1318\u20131320; the court, \n\nhe said, \u201cshould have remained true to its original reading of\u201d \u00a7285, id.,\n\nat 1320.\n\n6   OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nargument that the judgment of noninfringement \u201cshould\nhave been a foregone conclusion to anyone who visually\ninspected\u201d Octane\u2019s machines. Id., *2. The court ex-\nplained that although it had rejected ICON\u2019s infringement\narguments, they were neither \u201cfrivolous\u201d nor \u201cobjectively\nbaseless.\u201d Id., *2\u2013*3. The court also found no subjective\nbad faith on ICON\u2019s part, dismissing as insufficient both\n\u201cthe fact that [ICON] is a bigger company which never\ncommercialized the \u2019710 patent\u201d and an e-mail exchange\nbetween two ICON sales executives, which Octane had\noffered as evidence that ICON had brought the infringe-\nment action \u201cas a matter of commercial strategy.\u201d5 Id., *4.\n   ICON appealed the judgment of noninfringement, and\nOctane cross-appealed the denial of attorney\u2019s fees. The\nFederal Circuit affirmed both orders. 496 Fed. Appx. 57\n(2012). In upholding the denial of attorney\u2019s fees, it re-\njected Octane\u2019s argument that the District Court had\n\u201capplied an overly restrictive standard in refusing to find\nthe case exceptional under \u00a7285.\u201d Id., at 65. The Federal\nCircuit declined to \u201crevisit the settled standard for excep-\ntionality.\u201d Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari, 570 U.

Under\nthe standard crafted in Brooks Furniture, a case is \u201cexcep-\ntional\u201d only if a district court either finds litigation-related\nmisconduct of an independently sanctionable magnitude\nor determines that the litigation was both \u201cbrought in\nsubjective bad faith\u201d and \u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d 393 F. 3d,\nat 1381. This formulation superimposes an inflexible\nframework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible.\n   For one thing, the first category of cases in which the\nFederal Circuit allows fee awards\u2014those involving litiga-\ntion misconduct or certain other misconduct\u2014appears to\nextend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. See\nibid.

Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517 (1994), for example, we\nexplained that in determining whether to award fees under a similar\nprovision in the Copyright Act, district courts could consider a \u201cnonex-\nclusive\u201d list of \u201cfactors,\u201d including \u201cfrivolousness, motivation, objective\nunreasonableness (both in the factual and legal components of the case)\nand the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of\ncompensation and deterrence.\u201d Id., at 534, n. 19 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

But sanctionable conduct\nis not the appropriate benchmark. Under the standard\nannounced today, a district court may award fees in the\nrare case in which a party\u2019s unreasonable conduct\u2014while\nnot necessarily independently sanctionable\u2014is nonethe-\nless so \u201cexceptional\u201d as to justify an award of fees.\n   The second category of cases in which the Federal Cir-\ncuit allows fee awards is also too restrictive. In order for a\ncase to fall within this second category, a district court\nmust determine both that the litigation is objectively\nbaseless and that the plaintiff brought it in subjective bad\nfaith. But a case presenting either subjective bad faith or\nexceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself\napart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award. Cf.\nNoxell, 771 F. 2d, at 526 (\u201c[W]e think it fair to assume\nthat Congress did not intend rigidly to limit recovery of\nfees by a [Lanham Act] defendant to the rare case in\nwhich a court finds that the plaintiff \u2018acted in bad faith,\nvexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons\u2019 . . . .\nSomething less than \u2018bad faith,\u2019 we believe, suffices to\nmark a case as \u2018exceptional\u2019 \u201d).\n   ICON argues that the dual requirement of \u201csubjective\nbad faith\u201d and \u201cobjective baselessness\u201d follows from this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc.\nv. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49 (1993)\n(PRE), which involved an exception to the Noerr-\nPennington doctrine of antitrust law. It does not. Under\nthe Noerr-Pennington doctrine\u2014established by Eastern\nRailroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight,\nInc., 365 U. S. 127 (1961), and Mine Workers v. Penning\u00ad\nton, 381 U. S. 657 (1965)\u2014defendants are immune from\nantitrust liability for engaging in conduct (including litiga-\ntion) aimed at influencing decisionmaking by the govern-\nment. PRE, 508 U. S., at 56. But under a \u201csham excep-\ntion\u201d to this doctrine, \u201cactivity \u2018ostensibly directed toward\n10 OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninfluencing governmental action\u2019 does not qualify for\nNoerr immunity if it \u2018is a mere sham to cover . . . an at-\ntempt to interfere directly with the business relationships\nof a competitor.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 51. In PRE, we held that to\nqualify as a \u201csham,\u201d a \u201clawsuit must be objectively base-\nless\u201d and must \u201cconcea[l] \u2018an attempt to interfere directly\nwith the business relationships of a competitor . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 60\u201361 (emphasis deleted). In other words, the plaintiff\nmust have brought baseless claims in an attempt to\nthwart competition (i.e., in bad faith).\n   In Brooks Furniture, the Federal Circuit imported the\nPRE standard into \u00a7285. See 393 F. 3d, at 1381. But the\nPRE standard finds no roots in the text of \u00a7285, and it\nmakes little sense in the context of determining whether a\ncase is so \u201cexceptional\u201d as to justify an award of attorney\u2019s\nfees in patent litigation. We crafted the Noerr-Pennington\ndoctrine\u2014and carved out only a narrow exception for\n\u201csham\u201d litigation\u2014to avoid chilling the exercise of the\nFirst Amendment right to petition the government for the\nredress of grievances. See PRE, 508 U. S., at 56 (\u201cThose\nwho petition government for redress are generally im-\nmune from antitrust liability\u201d). But to the extent that\npatent suits are similarly protected as acts of petitioning,\nit is not clear why the shifting of fees in an \u201cexceptional\u201d\ncase would diminish that right. The threat of antitrust\nliability (and the attendant treble damages, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a715) far more significantly chills the exercise of the right\nto petition than does the mere shifting of attorney\u2019s fees.\nIn the Noerr-Pennington context, defendants seek immun-\nity from a judicial declaration that their filing of a lawsuit\nwas actually unlawful; here, they seek immunity from a\nfar less onerous declaration that they should bear the\ncosts of that lawsuit in exceptional cases.\n                           2\n  We reject Brooks Furniture for another reason: It is so\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

We have twice declined to\nconstrue fee-shifting provisions narrowly on the basis that\ndoing so would render them superfluous, given the back-\nground exception to the American rule, see Christiansburg\nGarment Co. v.

We have not interpreted comparable\nfee-shifting statutes to require proof of entitlement to fees\nby clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510\nU. S., at 519; Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n384 (1990); Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558\n(1988). And nothing in \u00a7285 justifies such a high standard\nof proof. Section 285 demands a simple discretionary\ninquiry; it imposes no specific evidentiary burden, much\nless such a high one. Indeed, patent-infringement litiga-\ntion has always been governed by a preponderance of the\nevidence standard, see, e.g., B\u00e9n\u00e9 v. Jeantet, 129 U.

Dutailier Int\u2019l, Inc.,\n  393 F. 3d 1378, 1381, the Federal Circuit defined an \u201cexceptional\n  case\u201d as one which either involves \u201cmaterial inappropriate conduct\u201d\n  or is both \u201cobjectively baseless\u201d and \u201cbrought in subjective bad faith.\u201d\n  Brooks Furniture also requires that parties establish the \u201cexception-\n  al\u201d nature of a case by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id., at 1382.\n     Respondent ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., sued petitioner Octane\n  Fitness, LLC, for patent infringement. The District Court granted\n  summary judgment to Octane. Octane then moved for attorney\u2019s fees\n  under \u00a7285. The District Court denied the motion under the Brooks\n  Furniture framework, finding ICON\u2019s claim to be neither objectively\n  baseless nor brought in subjective bad faith. The Federal Circuit af-\n  firmed.\nHeld: The Brooks Furniture framework is unduly rigid and impermissi-\n bly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.\n Pp. 7\u201312.\n    (a) Section 285 imposes one and only one constraint on district\n courts\u2019 discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees: The power is reserved for\n \u201cexceptional\u201d cases. Because the Patent Act does not define \u201cexcep-\n tional,\u201d the term is construed \u201cin accordance with [its] ordinary\n meaning.\u201d Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___.

District courts\n    may determine whether a case is \u201cexceptional\u201d in the case-by-case\n    exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circum-\n    stances. Cf. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517. Pp. 7\u20138.\n       (b) The Brooks Furniture framework superimposes an inflexible\n    framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible. Pp. 8\u201311.\n         (1) Brooks Furniture is too restrictive in defining the two catego-\n    ries of cases in which fee awards are allowed. The first category\u2014\n    cases involving litigation or certain other misconduct\u2014appears to ex-\n    tend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. But that is not\n    the appropriate benchmark. A district court may award fees in the\n    rare case in which a party\u2019s unreasonable, though not independently\n    sanctionable, conduct is so \u201cexceptional\u201d as to justify an award. For\n    litigation to fall within the second category, a district court must de-\n    termine that the litigation is both objectively baseless and brought in\n    subjective bad faith. But a case presenting either subjective bad\n    faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself\n    apart from mine-run cases to be \u201cexceptional.\u201d The Federal Circuit\n    imported this second category from Professional Real Estate Inves-\n    tors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49, but that\n    case\u2019s standard finds no roots in \u00a7285\u2019s text and makes little sense in\n    the context of the exceptional-case determination. Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (2) Brooks Furniture is so demanding that it would appear to\n    render \u00a7285 largely superfluous. Because courts already possess the\n    inherent power to award fees in cases involving misconduct or bad\n    faith, see Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S.\n    240, 258\u2013259, this Court has declined to construe fee-shifting provi-\n    sions narrowly so as to avoid rendering them superfluous. See, e.g.,\n    Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419. Pp. 10\u201311.\n         (3) Brooks Furniture\u2019s requirement that proof of entitlement to\n    fees be made by clear and convincing evidence is not justified by\n    \u00a7285, which imposes no specific evidentiary burden.

S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). In 1946, Congress amended the\nPatent Act to add a discretionary fee-shifting provision,\nthen codified in \u00a770, which stated that a court \u201cmay in its\ndiscretion award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevail-\ning party upon the entry of judgment in any patent case.\u201d\n35 U. S. C. \u00a770 (1946 ed.).1\n    Courts did not award fees under \u00a770 as a matter of\ncourse. They viewed the award of fees not \u201cas a penalty\nfor failure to win a patent infringement suit,\u201d but as ap-\npropriate \u201conly in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d Park-In-\nTheatres, Inc. v. Perkins, 190 F. 2d 137, 142 (CA9 1951).\nThe provision enabled them to address \u201cunfairness or bad\nfaith in the conduct of the losing party, or some other\nequitable consideration of similar force,\u201d which made a\ncase so unusual as to warrant fee-shifting. Ibid.; see also\nPennsylvania Crusher Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 193 F.\n2d 445, 451 (CA3 1951) (listing as \u201cadequate justifica-\ntion[s]\u201d for fee awards \u201cfraud practiced on the Patent\nOffice or vexatious or unjustified litigation\u201d).\n    Six years later, Congress amended the fee-shifting\nprovision and recodified it as \u00a7285. Whereas \u00a770 had\nspecified that a district court could \u201cin its discretion award\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party,\u201d the\nrevised language of \u00a7285 (which remains in force today)\nprovides that \u201c[t]he court in exceptional cases may award\nreasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d We have\nobserved, in interpreting the damages provision of the\nPatent Act, that the addition of the phrase \u201cexceptional\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 This provision did \u201cnot contemplat[e] that the recovery of attorney\u2019s\n\nfees [would] become an ordinary thing in patent suits . . . .\u201d S.

And the parties agree\nthat the recodification did not substantively alter the\nmeaning of the statute.3\n   For three decades after the enactment of \u00a7285, courts\napplied it\u2014as they had applied \u00a770\u2014in a discretionary\nmanner, assessing various factors to determine whether a\ngiven case was sufficiently \u201cexceptional\u201d to warrant a fee\naward. See, e.g., True Temper Corp. v. CF&I Steel Corp.,\n601 F. 2d 495, 508\u2013509 (CA10 1979); Kearney & Trecker\nCorp. v. Giddings & Lewis, Inc., 452 F. 2d 579, 597 (CA7\n1971); Siebring v.

In the two decades that followed, the\nFederal Circuit, like the regional circuits before it, in-\nstructed district courts to consider the totality of the cir-\ncumstances when making fee determinations under \u00a7285.\nSee, e.g., Rohm & Haas Co. v.

In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v.\nDutailier Int\u2019l, Inc., 393 F. 3d 1378 (2005), the court held\nthat a case is \u201cexceptional\u201d under \u00a7285 only \u201cwhen there\nhas been some material inappropriate conduct related to\nthe matter in litigation, such as willful infringement,\nfraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent,\nmisconduct during litigation, vexatious or unjustified\nlitigation, conduct that violates Fed.

The\nFederal Circuit affirmed both orders. 496 Fed. Appx. 57\n(2012). In upholding the denial of attorney\u2019s fees, it re-\njected Octane\u2019s argument that the District Court had\n\u201capplied an overly restrictive standard in refusing to find\nthe case exceptional under \u00a7285.\u201d Id., at 65.

Under\nthe standard crafted in Brooks Furniture, a case is \u201cexcep-\ntional\u201d only if a district court either finds litigation-related\nmisconduct of an independently sanctionable magnitude\nor determines that the litigation was both \u201cbrought in\nsubjective bad faith\u201d and \u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d 393 F. 3d,\nat 1381. This formulation superimposes an inflexible\nframework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible.\n   For one thing, the first category of cases in which the\nFederal Circuit allows fee awards\u2014those involving litiga-\ntion misconduct or certain other misconduct\u2014appears to\nextend largely to independently sanctionable conduct.

But sanctionable conduct\nis not the appropriate benchmark. Under the standard\nannounced today, a district court may award fees in the\nrare case in which a party\u2019s unreasonable conduct\u2014while\nnot necessarily independently sanctionable\u2014is nonethe-\nless so \u201cexceptional\u201d as to justify an award of fees.\n   The second category of cases in which the Federal Cir-\ncuit allows fee awards is also too restrictive. In order for a\ncase to fall within this second category, a district court\nmust determine both that the litigation is objectively\nbaseless and that the plaintiff brought it in subjective bad\nfaith. But a case presenting either subjective bad faith or\nexceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself\napart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award. Cf.\nNoxell, 771 F. 2d, at 526 (\u201c[W]e think it fair to assume\nthat Congress did not intend rigidly to limit recovery of\nfees by a [Lanham Act] defendant to the rare case in\nwhich a court finds that the plaintiff \u2018acted in bad faith,\nvexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons\u2019 . . . .\nSomething less than \u2018bad faith,\u2019 we believe, suffices to\nmark a case as \u2018exceptional\u2019 \u201d).\n   ICON argues that the dual requirement of \u201csubjective\nbad faith\u201d and \u201cobjective baselessness\u201d follows from this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc.\nv. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49 (1993)\n(PRE), which involved an exception to the Noerr-\nPennington doctrine of antitrust law. It does not.

ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninfluencing governmental action\u2019 does not qualify for\nNoerr immunity if it \u2018is a mere sham to cover . . . an at-\ntempt to interfere directly with the business relationships\nof a competitor.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 51. In PRE, we held that to\nqualify as a \u201csham,\u201d a \u201clawsuit must be objectively base-\nless\u201d and must \u201cconcea[l] \u2018an attempt to interfere directly\nwith the business relationships of a competitor . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 60\u201361 (emphasis deleted). In other words, the plaintiff\nmust have brought baseless claims in an attempt to\nthwart competition (i.e., in bad faith).\n   In Brooks Furniture, the Federal Circuit imported the\nPRE standard into \u00a7285. See 393 F. 3d, at 1381. But the\nPRE standard finds no roots in the text of \u00a7285, and it\nmakes little sense in the context of determining whether a\ncase is so \u201cexceptional\u201d as to justify an award of attorney\u2019s\nfees in patent litigation. We crafted the Noerr-Pennington\ndoctrine\u2014and carved out only a narrow exception for\n\u201csham\u201d litigation\u2014to avoid chilling the exercise of the\nFirst Amendment right to petition the government for the\nredress of grievances. See PRE, 508 U. S., at 56 (\u201cThose\nwho petition government for redress are generally im-\nmune from antitrust liability\u201d). But to the extent that\npatent suits are similarly protected as acts of petitioning,\nit is not clear why the shifting of fees in an \u201cexceptional\u201d\ncase would diminish that right. The threat of antitrust\nliability (and the attendant treble damages, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a715) far more significantly chills the exercise of the right\nto petition than does the mere shifting of attorney\u2019s fees.\nIn the Noerr-Pennington context, defendants seek immun-\nity from a judicial declaration that their filing of a lawsuit\nwas actually unlawful; here, they seek immunity from a\nfar less onerous declaration that they should bear the\ncosts of that lawsuit in exceptional cases.\n                           2\n  We reject Brooks Furniture for another reason: It is so\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndemanding that it would appear to render \u00a7285 largely\nsuperfluous. We have long recognized a common-law\nexception to the general \u201cAmerican rule\u201d against fee-\nshifting\u2014an exception, \u201cinherent\u201d in the \u201cpower [of] the\ncourts\u201d that applies for \u201c \u2018willful disobedience of a court\norder\u2019 \u201d or \u201cwhen the losing party has \u2018acted in bad faith,\nvexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons . . . .\u2019 \u201d\nAlyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421\nU. S. 240, 258\u2013259 (1975). We have twice declined to\nconstrue fee-shifting provisions narrowly on the basis that\ndoing so would render them superfluous, given the back-\nground exception to the American rule, see Christiansburg\nGarment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419 (1978); Newman\nv. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402, n. 4\n(1968) (per curiam), and we again decline to do so here.\n                              3\n   Finally, we reject the Federal Circuit\u2019s requirement that\npatent litigants establish their entitlement to fees under\n\u00a7285 by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d Brooks Furniture,\n393 F. 3d, at 1382. We have not interpreted comparable\nfee-shifting statutes to require proof of entitlement to fees\nby clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510\nU. S., at 519; Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n384 (1990); Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558\n(1988). And nothing in \u00a7285 justifies such a high standard\nof proof. Section 285 demands a simple discretionary\ninquiry; it imposes no specific evidentiary burden, much\nless such a high one. Indeed, patent-infringement litiga-\ntion has always been governed by a preponderance of the\nevidence standard, see, e.g., B\u00e9n\u00e9 v. Jeantet, 129 U. S. 683,\n688 (1889), and that is the \u201cstandard generally applicable\nin civil actions,\u201d because it \u201callows both parties to \u2018share\nthe risk of error in roughly equal fashion,\u2019 \u201d Herman &\nMacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 390 (1983).\n12 OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                        *    *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
