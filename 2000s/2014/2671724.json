S. C. \u00a7285. In Brooks Furni-\nture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int\u2019l, Inc., 393 F. 3d 1378\n(2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit interpreted \u00a7285 as authorizing fee awards only in\ntwo circumstances. It held that \u201c[a] case may be deemed\nexceptional\u201d under \u00a7285 \u201cwhen there has been some mate-\nrial inappropriate conduct,\u201d or when it is both \u201cbrought in\nsubjective bad faith\u201d and \u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d Id., at\n1381. We granted certiorari to determine whether an\nappellate court should accord deference to a district court\u2019s\ndetermination that litigation is \u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d On\nthe basis of our opinion in Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON\nHealth & Fitness, Inc., ante, p. ___, argued together with\nthis case and also issued today, we hold that an appellate\ncourt should review all aspects of a district court\u2019s \u00a7285\ndetermination for abuse of discretion.\n                        I\n  Allcare Health Management System, Inc., owns U. S.\n2     HIGHMARK INC. v. ALLCARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT\n                        SYSTEM, INC.\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPatent No. 5,301,105 (\u2019105 patent), which covers \u201cutiliza-\ntion review\u201d in \u201c \u2018managed health care systems.\u2019 \u201d1 687\nF. 3d 1300, 1306 (CA Fed 2012). Highmark Inc., a health\ninsurance company, sued Allcare seeking a declaratory\njudgment that the \u2019105 patent was invalid and unenforce-\nable and that, to the extent it was valid, Highmark\u2019s\nactions were not infringing it. Allcare counterclaimed for\npatent infringement. Both parties filed motions for sum-\nmary judgment, and the District Court entered a final\njudgment of noninfringement in favor of Highmark. The\nFederal Circuit affirmed. 329 Fed. Appx. 280 (2009) (per\ncuriam).\n   Highmark then moved for fees under \u00a7285. The District\nCourt granted Highmark\u2019s motion. 706 F. Supp. 2d 713\n(ND Tex. 2010). The court reasoned that Allcare had\nengaged in a pattern of \u201cvexatious\u201d and \u201cdeceitful\u201d conduct\nthroughout the litigation. Id., at 737. Specifically, it\nfound that Allcare had \u201cpursued this suit as part of a\nbigger plan to identify companies potentially infringing\nthe \u2019105 patent under the guise of an informational sur-\nvey, and then to force those companies to purchase a\nlicense of the \u2019105 patent under threat of litigation.\u201d Id.,\nat 736\u2013737. And it found that Allcare had \u201cmaintained\ninfringement claims [against Highmark] well after such\nclaims had been shown by its own experts to be without\nmerit\u201d and had \u201casserted defenses it and its attorneys\nknew to be frivolous.\u201d Id., at 737. In a subsequent opin-\nion, the District Court fixed the amount of the award at\n$4,694,727.40 in attorney\u2019s fees and $209,626.56 in ex-\npenses, in addition to $375,400.05 in expert fees. 2010 WL\n6432945, *7 (ND Tex., Nov. 5, 2010).\n   The Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 \u201c \u2018Utilization review\u2019 is the process of determining whether a health\n\ninsurer should approve a particular treatment for a patient.\u201d 687 F. 3d,\nat 1306.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npart. 687 F. 3d 1300. It affirmed the District Court\u2019s\nexceptional-case determination with respect to the allega-\ntions that Highmark\u2019s system infringed one claim of the\n\u2019105 patent, id., at 1311\u20131313, but reversed the determi-\nnation with respect to another claim of the patent, id., at\n1313\u20131315. In reversing the exceptional-case determina-\ntion as to one claim, the court reviewed it de novo. The\ncourt held that because the question whether litigation is\n\u201cobjectively baseless\u201d under Brooks Furniture \u201c \u2018is a ques-\ntion of law based on underlying mixed questions of law\nand fact,\u2019 \u201d an objective-baselessness determination is\nreviewed on appeal \u201c \u2018de novo\u2019 \u201d and \u201cwithout deference.\u201d\n687 F. 3d, at 1309; see also ibid., n. 1. It then determined,\ncontrary to the judgment of the District Court, that \u201cAll-\ncare\u2019s argument\u201d as to claim construction \u201cwas not \u2018so\nunreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it\nwould succeed.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1315. The court further found\nthat none of Allcare\u2019s conduct warranted an award of fees\nunder the litigation-misconduct prong of Brooks Furniture.\n687 F. 3d, at 1315\u20131319.\n   Judge Mayer dissented in part, disagreeing with the\nview \u201cthat no deference is owed to a district court\u2019s finding\nthat the infringement claims asserted by a litigant at trial\nwere objectively unreasonable.\u201d Id., at 1319. He would\nhave held that \u201creasonableness is a finding of fact which\nmay be set aside only for clear error.\u201d Ibid. The Federal\nCircuit denied rehearing en banc, over the dissent of five\njudges. 701 F. 3d 1351 (2012). The dissenting judges\ncriticized the court\u2019s decision to adopt a de novo standard\nof review for the \u201cobjectively baseless\u201d determination as an\nimpermissible invasion of the province of the district\ncourt. Id., at 1357.\n   We granted certiorari, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), and now\nvacate and remand.\n4     HIGHMARK INC. v. ALLCARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT \n\n                        SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               II\n   Our opinion in Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health &\nFitness, Inc., rejects the Brooks Furniture framework as\nunduly rigid and inconsistent with the text of \u00a7285. It\nholds, instead, that the word \u201cexceptional\u201d in \u00a7285 should\nbe interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning.\nAnte, at 7. An \u201cexceptional\u201d case, it explains, \u201cis simply\none that stands out from others with respect to the sub-\nstantive strength of a party\u2019s litigating position (consider-\ning both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the\nunreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.\u201d\nAnte, at 7\u20138. And it instructs that \u201c[d]istrict courts may\ndetermine whether a case is \u2018exceptional\u2019 in the case-by-\ncase exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of\nthe circumstances.\u201d Ante, at 8. Our holding in Octane\nsettles this case: Because \u00a7285 commits the determination\nwhether a case is \u201cexceptional\u201d to the discretion of the\ndistrict court, that decision is to be reviewed on appeal for\nabuse of discretion.\n   Traditionally, decisions on \u201cquestions of law\u201d are \u201cre-\nviewable de novo,\u201d decisions on \u201cquestions of fact\u201d are\n\u201creviewable for clear error,\u201d and decisions on \u201cmatters of\ndiscretion\u201d are \u201creviewable for \u2018abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d\nPierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558 (1988). For rea-\nsons we explain in Octane, the determination whether a\ncase is \u201cexceptional\u201d under \u00a7285 is a matter of discretion.\nAnd as in our prior cases involving similar determina-\ntions, the exceptional-case determination is to be reviewed\nonly for abuse of discretion.2 See Pierce, 487 U. S., at 559\n(determinations whether a litigating position is \u201csubstan-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The abuse-of-discretion standard does not preclude an appellate\n\ncourt\u2019s correction of a district court\u2019s legal or factual error: \u201cA district\ncourt would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an\nerroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the\nevidence.\u201d Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 405 (1990).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntially justified\u201d for purposes of fee-shifting under the\nEqual Access to Justice Act are to be reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion); Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n384, 405 (1990) (sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 11 are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n   As in Pierce, the text of the statute \u201cemphasizes the fact\nthat the determination is for the district court,\u201d which\n\u201csuggests some deference to the district court upon ap-\npeal,\u201d 487 U. S., at 559. As in Pierce, \u201cas a matter of the\nsound administration of justice,\u201d the district court \u201cis\nbetter positioned\u201d to decide whether a case is exceptional,\nid., at 559\u2013560, because it lives with the case over a pro-\nlonged period of time. And as in Pierce, the question is\n\u201cmultifarious and novel,\u201d not susceptible to \u201cuseful gener-\nalization\u201d of the sort that de novo review provides, and\n\u201clikely to profit from the experience that an abuse-of-\ndiscretion rule will permit to develop,\u201d id., at 562.\n   We therefore hold that an appellate court should apply\nan abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of\na district court\u2019s \u00a7285 determination. Although questions\nof law may in some cases be relevant to the \u00a7285 inquiry,\nthat inquiry generally is, at heart, \u201crooted in factual de-\nterminations,\u201d Cooter, 496 U. S., at 401.\n                        *    *     *\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n",

We granted certiorari to determine whether an\nappellate court should accord deference to a district court\u2019s\ndetermination that litigation is \u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d On\nthe basis of our opinion in Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON\nHealth & Fitness, Inc., ante, p. ___, argued together with\nthis case and also issued today, we hold that an appellate\ncourt should review all aspects of a district court\u2019s \u00a7285\ndetermination for abuse of discretion.\n                        I\n  Allcare Health Management System, Inc., owns U.

ALLCARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT\n                        SYSTEM, INC.\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPatent No. 5,301,105 (\u2019105 patent), which covers \u201cutiliza-\ntion review\u201d in \u201c \u2018managed health care systems.\u2019 \u201d1 687\nF. 3d 1300, 1306 (CA Fed 2012). Highmark Inc., a health\ninsurance company, sued Allcare seeking a declaratory\njudgment that the \u2019105 patent was invalid and unenforce-\nable and that, to the extent it was valid, Highmark\u2019s\nactions were not infringing it. Allcare counterclaimed for\npatent infringement. Both parties filed motions for sum-\nmary judgment, and the District Court entered a final\njudgment of noninfringement in favor of Highmark. The\nFederal Circuit affirmed. 329 Fed. Appx. 280 (2009) (per\ncuriam).\n   Highmark then moved for fees under \u00a7285. The District\nCourt granted Highmark\u2019s motion. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2541965\"><a href=\"/txnd/e2CZ/highmark-v-allcare-health-management-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(ND Tex. 2010). The court reasoned that Allcare had\nengaged in a pattern of \u201cvexatious\u201d and \u201cdeceitful\u201d conduct\nthroughout the litigation. Id., at 737. Specifically, it\nfound that Allcare had \u201cpursued this suit as part of a\nbigger plan to identify companies potentially infringing\nthe \u2019105 patent under the guise of an informational sur-\nvey, and then to force those companies to purchase a\nlicense of the \u2019105 patent under threat of litigation.\u201d Id.,\nat 736\u2013737. And it found that Allcare had \u201cmaintained\ninfringement claims [against Highmark] well after such\nclaims had been shown by its own experts to be without\nmerit\u201d and had \u201casserted defenses it and its attorneys\nknew to be frivolous.\u201d Id., at 737. In a subsequent opin-\nion, the District Court fixed the amount of the award at\n$4,694,727.40 in attorney\u2019s fees and $209,626.56 in ex-\npenses, in addition to $375,400.05 in expert fees. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">6432945</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *7 (ND Tex., Nov. 5, 2010).\n   The Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 \u201c \u2018Utilization review\u2019 is the process of determining whether a health\n\ninsurer should approve a particular treatment for a patient.\u201d 687 F. 3d,\nat 1306.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

It affirmed the District Court\u2019s\nexceptional-case determination with respect to the allega-\ntions that Highmark\u2019s system infringed one claim of the\n\u2019105 patent, id., at 1311\u20131313, but reversed the determi-\nnation with respect to another claim of the patent, id., at\n1313\u20131315. In reversing the exceptional-case determina-\ntion as to one claim, the court reviewed it de novo. The\ncourt held that because the question whether litigation is\n\u201cobjectively baseless\u201d under Brooks Furniture \u201c \u2018is a ques-\ntion of law based on underlying mixed questions of law\nand fact,\u2019 \u201d an objective-baselessness determination is\nreviewed on appeal \u201c \u2018de novo\u2019 \u201d and \u201cwithout deference.\u201d\n687 F. 3d, at 1309; see also ibid., n. 1. It then determined,\ncontrary to the judgment of the District Court, that \u201cAll-\ncare\u2019s argument\u201d as to claim construction \u201cwas not \u2018so\nunreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it\nwould succeed.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1315. The court further found\nthat none of Allcare\u2019s conduct warranted an award of fees\nunder the litigation-misconduct prong of Brooks Furniture.\n687 F. 3d, at 1315\u20131319.\n   Judge Mayer dissented in part, disagreeing with the\nview \u201cthat no deference is owed to a district court\u2019s finding\nthat the infringement claims asserted by a litigant at trial\nwere objectively unreasonable.\u201d Id., at 1319. He would\nhave held that \u201creasonableness is a finding of fact which\nmay be set aside only for clear error.\u201d Ibid. The Federal\nCircuit denied rehearing en banc, over the dissent of five\njudges. 701 F. 3d 1351 (2012). The dissenting judges\ncriticized the court\u2019s decision to adopt a de novo standard\nof review for the \u201cobjectively baseless\u201d determination as an\nimpermissible invasion of the province of the district\ncourt.

ALLCARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT \n\n                        SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               II\n   Our opinion in Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health &\nFitness, Inc., rejects the Brooks Furniture framework as\nunduly rigid and inconsistent with the text of \u00a7285. It\nholds, instead, that the word \u201cexceptional\u201d in \u00a7285 should\nbe interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning.\nAnte, at 7. An \u201cexceptional\u201d case, it explains, \u201cis simply\none that stands out from others with respect to the sub-\nstantive strength of a party\u2019s litigating position (consider-\ning both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the\nunreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.\u201d\nAnte, at 7\u20138. And it instructs that \u201c[d]istrict courts may\ndetermine whether a case is \u2018exceptional\u2019 in the case-by-\ncase exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of\nthe circumstances.\u201d Ante, at 8. Our holding in Octane\nsettles this case: Because \u00a7285 commits the determination\nwhether a case is \u201cexceptional\u201d to the discretion of the\ndistrict court, that decision is to be reviewed on appeal for\nabuse of discretion.\n   Traditionally, decisions on \u201cquestions of law\u201d are \u201cre-\nviewable de novo,\u201d decisions on \u201cquestions of fact\u201d are\n\u201creviewable for clear error,\u201d and decisions on \u201cmatters of\ndiscretion\u201d are \u201creviewable for \u2018abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d\nPierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558 (1988). For rea-\nsons we explain in Octane, the determination whether a\ncase is \u201cexceptional\u201d under \u00a7285 is a matter of discretion.\nAnd as in our prior cases involving similar determina-\ntions, the exceptional-case determination is to be reviewed\nonly for abuse of discretion.2 See Pierce, 487 U. S., at 559\n(determinations whether a litigating position is \u201csubstan-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The abuse-of-discretion standard does not preclude an appellate\n\ncourt\u2019s correction of a district court\u2019s legal or factual error: \u201cA district\ncourt would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an\nerroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the\nevidence.\u201d Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 405 (1990).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntially justified\u201d for purposes of fee-shifting under the\nEqual Access to Justice Act are to be reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion); Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n384, 405 (1990) (sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 11 are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n   As in Pierce, the text of the statute \u201cemphasizes the fact\nthat the determination is for the district court,\u201d which\n\u201csuggests some deference to the district court upon ap-\npeal,\u201d 487 U. S., at 559. As in Pierce, \u201cas a matter of the\nsound administration of justice,\u201d the district court \u201cis\nbetter positioned\u201d to decide whether a case is exceptional,\nid., at 559\u2013560, because it lives with the case over a pro-\nlonged period of time. And as in Pierce, the question is\n\u201cmultifarious and novel,\u201d not susceptible to \u201cuseful gener-\nalization\u201d of the sort that de novo review provides, and\n\u201clikely to profit from the experience that an abuse-of-\ndiscretion rule will permit to develop,\u201d id., at 562.\n   We therefore hold that an appellate court should apply\nan abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of\na district court\u2019s \u00a7285 determination. Although questions\nof law may in some cases be relevant to the \u00a7285 inquiry,\nthat inquiry generally is, at heart, \u201crooted in factual de-\nterminations,\u201d Cooter, 496 U. S., at 401.\n                        *    *     *\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
