Argued October 15, 2013\u2014Decided April 22, 2014\nAfter this Court decided that the University of Michigan\u2019s undergradu-\n  ate admissions plan\u2019s use of race-based preferences violated the\n  Equal Protection Clause, Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244, 270, but\n  that the law school admission plan\u2019s more limited use did not, Grutter\n  v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 343, Michigan voters adopted Proposal 2,\n  now Art. I, \u00a726, of the State Constitution, which, as relevant here,\n  prohibits the use of race-based preferences as part of the admissions\n  process for state universities. In consolidated challenges, the District\n  Court granted summary judgment to Michigan, thus upholding Pro-\n  posal 2, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that the proposal\n  violated the principles of Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,\n  458 U. S. 457.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed.\n701 F. 3d 466, reversed.\n    JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO,\n  concluded that there is no authority in the Federal Constitution or in\n  this Court\u2019s precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws\n  that commit to the voters the determination whether racial prefer-\n  ences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular\n  with respect to school admissions. Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) This case is not about the constitutionality, or the merits, of\n  race-conscious admissions policies in higher education. Here, the\n  principle that the consideration of race in admissions is permissible\n2                          SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    when certain conditions are met is not being challenged. Rather, the\n    question concerns whether, and in what manner, voters in the States\n    may choose to prohibit the consideration of such racial preferences.\n    Where States have prohibited race-conscious admissions policies,\n    universities have responded by experimenting \u201cwith a wide variety of\n    alternative approaches.\u201d Grutter, supra, at 342. The decision by\n    Michigan voters reflects the ongoing national dialogue about such\n    practices. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Sixth Circuit\u2019s determination that Seattle controlled here\n    extends Seattle\u2019s holding in a case presenting quite different issues to\n    reach a mistaken conclusion. Pp. 5\u201318.\n         (1) It is necessary to consider first the relevant cases preceding\n    Seattle and the background against which Seattle arose. Both Reit\u00ad\n    man v. Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369, and Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385,\n    involved demonstrated injuries on the basis of race that, by reasons\n    of state encouragement or participation, became more aggravated. In\n    Mulkey, a voter-enacted amendment to the California Constitution\n    prohibiting state legislative interference with an owner\u2019s prerogative\n    to decline to sell or rent residential property on any basis barred the\n    challenging parties, on account of race, from invoking the protection\n    of California\u2019s statutes, thus preventing them from leasing residen-\n    tial property. In Hunter, voters overturned an Akron ordinance that\n    was enacted to address widespread racial discrimination in housing\n    sales and rentals had forced many to live in \u201c \u2018unhealthful, unsafe,\n    unsanitary and overcrowded\u2019 \u201d segregated housing, 393 U. S., at 391.\n    In Seattle, after the school board adopted a mandatory busing pro-\n    gram to alleviate racial isolation of minority students in local schools,\n    voters passed a state initiative that barred busing to desegregate.\n    This Court found that the state initiative had the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of\n    removing \u201cthe authority to address a racial problem . . . from the ex-\n    isting decisionmaking body, in such a way as to burden minority in-\n    terests\u201d of busing advocates who must now \u201cseek relief from the state\n    legislature, or from the statewide electorate.\u201d 458 U. S., at 474.\n    Pp. 5\u20138.\n         (2) Seattle is best understood as a case in which the state action\n    had the serious risk, if not purpose, of causing specific injuries on ac-\n    count of race as had been the case in Mulkey and Hunter. While\n    there had been no judicial finding of de jure segregation with respect\n    to Seattle\u2019s school district, a finding that would be required today, see\n    Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,\n    551 U. S. 701, 720\u2013721, Seattle must be understood as Seattle under-\n    stood itself, as a case in which neither the State nor the United\n    States \u201cchallenge[d] the propriety of race-conscious student assign-\n    ments for the purpose of achieving integration, even absent a finding\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nof prior de jure segregation.\u201d 458 U. S. at 472, n. 15.\n   Seattle\u2019s broad language, however, went well beyond the analysis\nneeded to resolve the case. Seizing upon the statement in Justice\nHarlan\u2019s concurrence in Hunter that the procedural change in that\ncase had \u201cthe clear purpose of making it more difficult for certain ra-\ncial and religious minorities to achieve legislation that is in their in-\nterest,\u201d 385 U. S., at 395, the Seattle Court established a new and far-\nreaching rationale: Where a government policy \u201cinures primarily to\nthe benefit of the minority\u201d and \u201cminorities . . . consider\u201d the policy to\nbe \u201c \u2018in their interest,\u2019 \u201d then any state action that \u201cplace[s] effective\ndecisionmaking authority over\u201d that policy \u201cat a different level of\ngovernment\u201d is subject to strict scrutiny. 458 U. S., at 472, 474.\nPp. 8\u201311.\n      (3) To the extent Seattle is read to require the Court to determine\nand declare which political policies serve the \u201cinterest\u201d of a group de-\nfined in racial terms, that rationale was unnecessary to the decision\nin Seattle; it has no support in precedent; and it raises serious equal\nprotection concerns. In cautioning against \u201cimpermissible racial ste-\nreotypes,\u201d this Court has rejected the assumption that all individuals\nof the same race think alike, see Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 647,\nbut that proposition would be a necessary beginning point were the\nSeattle formulation to control. And if it were deemed necessary to\nprobe how some races define their own interest in political matters,\nstill another beginning point would be to define individuals according\nto race. Such a venture would be undertaken with no clear legal\nstandards or accepted sources to guide judicial decision. It would al-\nso result in, or impose a high risk of, inquiries and categories de-\npendent upon demeaning stereotypes, classifications of questionable\nconstitutionality on their own terms. Assuming these steps could be\ntaken, the court would next be required to determine the policy\nrealms in which groups defined by race had a political interest. That\nundertaking, again without guidance from accepted legal standards,\nwould risk the creation of incentives for those who support or oppose\ncertain policies to cast the debate in terms of racial advantage or dis-\nadvantage. Adoption of the Seattle formulation could affect any\nnumber of laws or decisions, involving, e.g., tax policy or housing sub-\nsidies. And racial division would be validated, not discouraged.\n   It can be argued that objections to the larger consequences of the\nSeattle formulation need not be confronted here, for race was an un-\ndoubted subject of the ballot issue. But other problems raised by Se\u00ad\nattle, such as racial definitions, still apply. And the principal flaw in\nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision remains: Here there was no infliction of a\nspecific injury of the kind at issue in Mulkey and Hunter and in the\nhistory of the Seattle schools, and there is no precedent for extending\n4                          SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    these cases to restrict the right of Michigan voters to determine that\n    race-based preferences granted by state entities should be ended.\n    The Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment also calls into question other States\u2019\n    long-settled rulings on policies similar to Michigan\u2019s.\n       Unlike the injuries in Mulkey, Hunter, and Seattle, the question\n    here is not how to address or prevent injury caused on account of race\n    but whether voters may determine whether a policy of race-based\n    preferences should be continued. By approving Proposal 2 and there-\n    by adding \u00a726 to their State Constitution, Michigan voters exercised\n    their privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic\n    power, bypassing public officials they deemed not responsive to their\n    concerns about a policy of granting race-based preferences. The\n    mandate for segregated schools, Brown v. Board of Education, 347\n    U. S. 483, and scores of other examples teach that individual liberty\n    has constitutional protection. But this Nation\u2019s constitutional system\n    also embraces the right of citizens to speak and debate and learn and\n    then, as a matter of political will, to act through a lawful electoral\n    process, as Michigan voters have done here. These precepts are not\n    inconsistent with the well-established principle that when hurt or in-\n    jury is inflicted on racial minorities by the encouragement or com-\n    mand of laws or other state action, the Constitution requires redress\n    by the courts. Such circumstances were present in Mulkey, Hunter,\n    and Seattle, but they are not present here. Pp. 11\u201318.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, agreed that \u00a726 rightly\n    stands, though not because it passes muster under the political-\n    process doctrine. It likely does not, but the cases establishing that\n    doctrine should be overruled. They are patently atextual, unadmin-\n    istrable, and contrary to this Court\u2019s traditional equal protection ju-\n    risprudence. The question here, as in every case in which neutral\n    state action is said to deny equal protection on account of race, is\n    whether the challenged action reflects a racially discriminatory pur-\n    pose. It plainly does not. Pp. 1\u201318.\n       (a) The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held \u00a726 unconstitu-\n    tional under the so-called political-process doctrine, derived from\n    Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, and Hunter v.\n    Erickson, 393 U. S. 385. In those cases, one level of government ex-\n    ercised borrowed authority over an apparently \u201cracial issue\u201d until a\n    higher level of government called the loan. This Court deemed each\n    revocation an equal-protection violation, without regard to whether\n    there was evidence of an invidious purpose to discriminate. The re-\n    lentless, radical logic of Hunter and Seattle would point to a similar\n    conclusion here, as in so many other cases. Pp. 3\u20137.\n       (b) The problems with the political-process doctrine begin with its\n    triggering prong, which assigns to a court the task of determining\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nwhether a law that reallocates policymaking authority concerns a\n\u201cracial issue,\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S., at 473, i.e., whether adopting one\nposition on the question would \u201cat bottom inur[e] primarily to the\nbenefit of the minority, and is designed for that purpose,\u201d id., at 472.\nSuch freeform judicial musing into ethnic and racial \u201cinterests\u201d in-\nvolves judges in the dirty business of dividing the Nation \u201cinto racial\nblocs,\u201d Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 603, 610\n(O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting), and promotes racial stereotyping, see\nShaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 647. More fundamentally, the analysis\nmisreads the Equal Protection Clause to protect particular groups, a\nconstruction that has been repudiated in a \u201clong line of cases under-\nstanding equal protection as a personal right.\u201d Adarand Construc\u00ad\ntors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 224, 230. Pp. 7\u201312.\n   (c) The second part of the Hunter-Seattle analysis directs a court to\ndetermine whether the challenged act \u201cplace[s] effective decisionmak-\ning authority over [the] racial issue at a different level of govern-\nment,\u201d Seattle, supra, at 474; but, in another line of cases, the Court\nhas emphasized the near-limitless sovereignty of each State to design\nits governing structure as it sees fit, see, e.g., Holt Civic Club v. Tus\u00ad\ncaloosa, 439 U. S. 60, 71. Taken to the limits of its logic, Hunter-\nSeattle is the gaping exception that nearly swallows the rule of struc-\ntural state sovereignty, which would seem to permit a State to give\ncertain powers to cities, later assign the same powers to counties, and\neven reclaim them for itself. Pp. 12\u201315.\n   (d) Hunter and Seattle also endorse a version of the proposition\nthat a facially neutral law may deny equal protection solely because\nit has a disparate racial impact. That equal-protection theory has\nbeen squarely and soundly rejected by an \u201cunwavering line of cases\u201d\nholding \u201cthat a violation of the Equal Protection Clause requires\nstate action motivated by discriminatory intent,\u201d Hernandez v. New\nYork, 500 U. S. 352, 372\u2013373 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment),\nand that \u201cofficial action will not be held unconstitutional solely be-\ncause it results in a racially disproportionate impact,\u201d Arlington\nHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252,\n264\u2013265. Respondents cannot prove that the action here reflects a\nracially discriminatory purpose, for any law expressly requiring state\nactors to afford all persons equal protection of the laws does not\u2014\ncannot\u2014deny \u201cto any person . . . equal protection of the laws,\u201d U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 14, \u00a71. Pp. 15\u201317.\n   JUSTICE BREYER agreed that the amendment is consistent with the\nEqual Protection Clause, but for different reasons. First, this case\naddresses the amendment only as it applies to, and forbids, race-\nconscious admissions programs that consider race solely in order to\nobtain the educational benefits of a diverse student body. Second, the\n6                          SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Constitution permits, but does not require, the use of the kind of\n    race-conscious programs now barred by the Michigan Constitution.\n    It foresees the ballot box, not the courts, as the normal instrument\n    for resolving debates about the merits of these programs. Third,\n    Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385, and Washington v. Seattle School\n    Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, which reflect the important principle that\n    an individual\u2019s ability to participate meaningfully in the political pro-\n    cess should be independent of his race, do not apply here. Those cas-\n    es involved a restructuring of the political process that changed the\n    political level at which policies were enacted, while this case involves\n    an amendment that took decisionmaking authority away from une-\n    lected actors and placed it in the hands of the voters. Hence, this\n    case does not involve a diminution of the minority\u2019s ability to partici-\n    pate in the political process. Extending the holding of Hunter and\n    Seattle to situations where decisionmaking authority is moved from\n    an administrative body to a political one would also create significant\n    difficulties, given the nature of the administrative process. Further-\n    more, the principle underlying Hunter and Seattle runs up against a\n    competing principle favoring decisionmaking through the democratic\n    process.

The\nundergraduate admissions plan was addressed in Gratz v.\nBollinger, 539 U. S. 244. The law school admission plan\nwas addressed in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306. Each\nadmissions process permitted the explicit consideration of\nan applicant\u2019s race. In Gratz, the Court invalidated the\nundergraduate plan as a violation of the Equal Protection\nClause. 539 U. S., at 270. In Grutter, the Court found no\n2                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nconstitutional flaw in the law school admission plan\u2019s\nmore limited use of race-based preferences. 539 U. S., at\n343.\n   In response to the Court\u2019s decision in Gratz, the univer-\nsity revised its undergraduate admissions process, but the\nrevision still allowed limited use of race-based preferences.\nAfter a statewide debate on the question of racial prefer-\nences in the context of governmental decisionmaking, the\nvoters, in 2006, adopted an amendment to the State Con-\nstitution prohibiting state and other governmental entities\nin Michigan from granting certain preferences, including\nrace-based preferences, in a wide range of actions and\ndecisions. Under the terms of the amendment, race-based\npreferences cannot be part of the admissions process for\nstate universities. That particular prohibition is central to\nthe instant case.\n   The ballot proposal was called Proposal 2 and, after it\npassed by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent, the result-\ning enactment became Article I, \u00a726, of the Michigan\nConstitution. As noted, the amendment is in broad terms.\nSection 26 states, in relevant part, as follows:\n       \u201c(1) The University of Michigan, Michigan State\n    University, Wayne State University, and any other\n    public college or university, community college, or\n    school district shall not discriminate against, or grant\n    preferential treatment to, any individual or group on\n    the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national\n    origin in the operation of public employment, public\n    education, or public contracting.\n       \u201c(2) The state shall not discriminate against, or\n    grant preferential treatment to, any individual or\n    group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or na-\n    tional origin in the operation of public employment,\n    public education, or public contracting.\n       \u201c(3) For the purposes of this section \u2018state\u2019 includes,\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Among the\nplaintiffs in the suits were the Coalition to Defend Affirm-\native Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight\nfor Equality By Any Means Necessary (BAMN); students;\nfaculty; and prospective applicants to Michigan public\nuniversities.     The named defendants included then-\nGovernor Jennifer Granholm, the Board of Regents of the\nUniversity of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan\nState University, and the Board of Governors of Wayne\nState University. The Michigan Attorney General was\ngranted leave to intervene as a defendant. The United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan\nconsolidated the cases.\n   In 2008, the District Court granted summary judgment\nto Michigan, thus upholding Proposal 2. BAMN v. Regents\nof Univ. of Mich., 539 F. Supp. 2d 924. The District Court\ndenied a motion to reconsider the grant of summary judg-\nment. 592 F. Supp. 2d 948. A panel of the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the grant\nof summary judgment. 652 F. 3d 607 (2011). Judge Gib-\nbons dissented from that holding. Id., at 633\u2013646. The\npanel majority held that Proposal 2 had violated the prin-\nciples elaborated by this Court in Washington v. Seattle\nSchool Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457 (1982), and in the cases\nthat Seattle relied upon.\n   The Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, agreed with the\npanel decision. 701 F. 3d 466 (CA6 2012). The majority\nopinion determined that Seattle \u201cmirrors the [case] before\nus.\u201d Id., at 475. Seven judges dissented in a number of\nopinions. The Court granted certiorari. 568 U.

BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n(2013).\n   Before the Court addresses the question presented, it is\nimportant to note what this case is not about. It is not\nabout the constitutionality, or the merits, of race-conscious\nadmissions policies in higher education. The considera-\ntion of race in admissions presents complex questions, in\npart addressed last Term in Fisher v. University of Texas\nat Austin, 570 U. S. \u2013\u2013\u2013 (2013). In Fisher, the Court did\nnot disturb the principle that the consideration of race in\nadmissions is permissible, provided that certain conditions\nare met. In this case, as in Fisher, that principle is not\nchallenged. The question here concerns not the permissi-\nbility of race-conscious admissions policies under the\nConstitution but whether, and in what manner, voters in\nthe States may choose to prohibit the consideration of\nracial preferences in governmental decisions, in particular\nwith respect to school admissions.\n   This Court has noted that some States have decided to\nprohibit race-conscious admissions policies. In Grutter,\nthe Court noted: \u201cUniversities in California, Florida, and\nWashington State, where racial preferences in admissions\nare prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in\nexperimenting with a wide variety of alternative ap-\nproaches. Universities in other States can and should\ndraw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral\nalternatives as they develop.\u201d 539 U. S., at 342 (citing\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 581 (1995)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he States may perform\ntheir role as laboratories for experimentation to devise\nvarious solutions where the best solution is far from\nclear\u201d)). In this way, Grutter acknowledged the signifi-\ncance of a dialogue regarding this contested and complex\npolicy question among and within States. There was\nrecognition that our federal structure \u201cpermits \u2018 innovation\nand experimentation\u2019 \u201d and \u201cenables greater citizen \u2018 in-\nvolvement in democratic processes.\u2019 \u201d Bond v. United\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nStates, 564 U. S. \u2013\u2013\u2013, \u2013\u2013\u2013 (2011) (slip op., at 9) (quoting\nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458 (1991)). While this\ncase arises in Michigan, the decision by the State\u2019s voters\nreflects in part the national dialogue regarding the wis-\ndom and practicality of race-conscious admissions policies\nin higher education. See, e.g., Coalition for Economic\nEquity v. Wilson, 122 F. 3d 692 (CA9 1997).\n   In Michigan, the State Constitution invests independent\nboards of trustees with plenary authority over public\nuniversities, including admissions policies. Mich. Const.,\nArt. VIII, \u00a75; see also Federated Publications, Inc. v. Board\nof Trustees of Mich. State Univ., 460 Mich. 75, 86\u201387, 594\nN. W. 2d 491, 497 (1999). Although the members of the\nboards are elected, some evidence in the record suggests\nthey delegated authority over admissions policy to the\nfaculty. But whether the boards or the faculty set the\nspecific policy, Michigan\u2019s public universities did consider\nrace as a factor in admissions decisions before 2006.\n   In holding \u00a726 invalid in the context of student admis-\nsions at state universities, the Court of Appeals relied in\nprimary part on Seattle, supra, which it deemed to control\nthe case. But that determination extends Seattle\u2019s holding\nin a case presenting quite different issues to reach a con-\nclusion that is mistaken here. Before explaining this\nfurther, it is necessary to consider the relevant cases that\npreceded Seattle and the background against which Seat-\ntle itself arose.\n   Though it has not been prominent in the arguments of\nthe parties, this Court\u2019s decision in Reitman v. Mulkey,\n387 U. S. 369 (1967), is a proper beginning point for dis-\ncussing the controlling decisions.       In Mulkey, voters\namended the California Constitution to prohibit any state\nlegislative interference with an owner\u2019s prerogative to\ndecline to sell or rent residential property on any basis.\nTwo different cases gave rise to Mulkey. In one a couple\ncould not rent an apartment, and in the other a couple\n6                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nwere evicted from their apartment. Those adverse actions\nwere on account of race. In both cases the complaining\nparties were barred, on account of race, from invoking the\nprotection of California\u2019s statutes; and, as a result, they\nwere unable to lease residential property. This Court\nconcluded that the state constitutional provision was a\ndenial of equal protection. The Court agreed with the\nCalifornia Supreme Court that the amendment operated\nto insinuate the State into the decision to discriminate by\nencouraging that practice. The Court noted the \u201cimmedi-\nate design and intent\u201d of the amendment was to \u201cestab-\nlis[h] a purported constitutional right to privately discrim-\ninate.\u201d Id., at 374 (internal quotation marks omitted and\nemphasis deleted). The Court agreed that the amendment\n\u201cexpressly authorized and constitutionalized the private\nright to discriminate.\u201d Id., at 376. The effect of the state\nconstitutional amendment was to \u201csignificantly encourage\nand involve the State in private racial discriminations.\u201d\nId., at 381. In a dissent joined by three other Justices,\nJustice Harlan disagreed with the majority\u2019s holding. Id.,\nat 387. The dissent reasoned that California, by the action\nof its voters, simply wanted the State to remain neutral in\nthis area, so that the State was not a party to discrimina-\ntion. Id., at 389. That dissenting voice did not prevail\nagainst the majority\u2019s conclusion that the state action in\nquestion encouraged discrimination, causing real and\nspecific injury.\n   The next precedent of relevance, Hunter v. Erickson, 393\nU. S. 385 (1969), is central to the arguments the respond-\nents make in the instant case. In Hunter, the Court for\nthe first time elaborated what the Court of Appeals here\nstyled the \u201cpolitical process\u201d doctrine. There, the Akron\nCity Council found that the citizens of Akron consisted of\n\u201c \u2018people of different race[s], . . . many of whom live in\ncircumscribed and segregated areas, under sub-standard\nunhealthful, unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded condi-\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\ntions, because of discrimination in the sale, lease, rental\nand financing of housing.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 391. To address the\nproblem, Akron enacted a fair housing ordinance to pro-\nhibit that sort of discrimination. In response, voters\namended the city charter to overturn the ordinance and to\nrequire that any additional antidiscrimination housing\nordinance be approved by referendum. But most other\nordinances \u201cregulating the real property market\u201d were not\nsubject to those threshold requirements. Id., at 390. The\nplaintiff, a black woman in Akron, Ohio, alleged that her\nreal estate agent could not show her certain residences\nbecause the owners had specified they would not sell to\nblack persons.\n   Central to the Court\u2019s reasoning in Hunter was that the\ncharter amendment was enacted in circumstances where\nwidespread racial discrimination in the sale and rental of\nhousing led to segregated housing, forcing many to live in\n\u201c \u2018unhealthful, unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded condi-\ntions.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 391. The Court stated: \u201cIt is against this\nbackground that the referendum required by [the charter\namendment] must be assessed.\u201d Ibid. Akron attempted to\ncharacterize the charter amendment \u201csimply as a public\ndecision to move slowly in the delicate area of race rela-\ntions\u201d and as a means \u201cto allow the people of Akron to\nparticipate\u201d in the decision. Id., at 392. The Court rejected\nAkron\u2019s flawed \u201cjustifications for its discrimination,\u201d\njustifications that by their own terms had the effect of\nacknowledging the targeted nature of the charter amend-\nment. Ibid. The Court noted, furthermore, that the char-\nter amendment was unnecessary as a general means of\npublic control over the city council; for the people of Akron\nalready were empowered to overturn ordinances by refer-\nendum. Id., at 390, n. 6. The Court found that the city\ncharter amendment, by singling out antidiscrimination\nordinances, \u201cplaces special burden on racial minorities\nwithin the governmental process,\u201d thus becoming as im-\n8                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\npermissible as any other government action taken with\nthe invidious intent to injure a racial minority. Id., at 391.\nJustice Harlan filed a concurrence. He argued the city\ncharter amendment \u201chas the clear purpose of making it\nmore difficult for certain racial and religious minorities to\nachieve legislation that is in their interest.\u201d Id., at 395.\nBut without regard to the sentence just quoted, Hunter\nrests on the unremarkable principle that the State may\nnot alter the procedures of government to target racial\nminorities. The facts in Hunter established that invidious\ndiscrimination would be the necessary result of the proce-\ndural restructuring. Thus, in Mulkey and Hunter, there\nwas a demonstrated injury on the basis of race that, by\nreasons of state encouragement or participation, became\nmore aggravated.\n  Seattle is the third case of principal relevance here.\nThere, the school board adopted a mandatory busing\nprogram to alleviate racial isolation of minority students\nin local schools. Voters who opposed the school board\u2019s\nbusing plan passed a state initiative that barred busing to\ndesegregate. The Court first determined that, although\n\u201cwhite as well as Negro children benefit from\u201d diversity,\nthe school board\u2019s plan \u201cinures primarily to the benefit of\nthe minority.\u201d 458 U. S., at 472. The Court next found\nthat \u201cthe practical effect\u201d of the state initiative was to\n\u201cremov[e] the authority to address a racial problem\u2014and\nonly a racial problem\u2014from the existing decisionmaking\nbody, in such a way as to burden minority interests\u201d be-\ncause advocates of busing \u201cnow must seek relief from the\nstate legislature, or from the statewide electorate.\u201d Id., at\n474. The Court therefore found that the initiative had\n\u201cexplicitly us[ed] the racial nature of a decision to deter-\nmine the decisionmaking process.\u201d Id., at 470 (emphasis\ndeleted).\n  Seattle is best understood as a case in which the state\naction in question (the bar on busing enacted by the\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              9\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nState\u2019s voters) had the serious risk, if not purpose, of\ncausing specific injuries on account of race, just as had\nbeen the case in Mulkey and Hunter. Although there had\nbeen no judicial finding of de jure segregation with respect\nto Seattle\u2019s school district, it appears as though school\nsegregation in the district in the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s may\nhave been the partial result of school board policies that\n\u201cpermitted white students to transfer out of black schools\nwhile restricting the transfer of black students into white\nschools.\u201d Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seat-\ntle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 807\u2013808 (2007)\n(BREYER, J., dissenting). In 1977, the National Associa-\ntion for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed\na complaint with the Office for Civil Rights, a federal\nagency. The NAACP alleged that the school board had\nmaintained a system of de jure segregation. Specifically,\nthe complaint alleged \u201cthat the Seattle School Board had\ncreated or perpetuated unlawful racial segregation\nthrough, e.g., certain school-transfer criteria, a construc-\ntion program that needlessly built new schools in white\nareas, district line-drawing criteria, the maintenance of\ninferior facilities at black schools, the use of explicit racial\ncriteria in the assignment of teachers and other staff, and\na general pattern of delay in respect to the implementa-\ntion of promised desegregation efforts.\u201d Id., at 810. As\npart of a settlement with the Office for Civil Rights, the\nschool board implemented the \u201cSeattle Plan,\u201d which used\nbusing and mandatory reassignments between elementary\nschools to reduce racial imbalance and which was the\nsubject of the state initiative at issue in Seattle. See 551\nU. S., at 807\u2013812.\n   As this Court held in Parents Involved, the school\nboard\u2019s purported remedial action would not be permissi-\nble today absent a showing of de jure segregation. Id., at\n720\u2013721. That holding prompted JUSTICE BREYER to\nobserve in dissent, as noted above, that one permissible\n10                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nreading of the record was that the school board had main-\ntained policies to perpetuate racial segregation in the\nschools. In all events we must understand Seattle as\nSeattle understood itself, as a case in which neither the\nState nor the United States \u201cchallenge[d] the propriety of\nrace-conscious student assignments for the purpose of\nachieving integration, even absent a finding of prior\nde jure segregation.\u201d 458 U. S. at 472, n. 15. In other\nwords the legitimacy and constitutionality of the remedy\nin question (busing for desegregation) was assumed, and\nSeattle must be understood on that basis. Ibid. Seattle\ninvolved a state initiative that \u201cwas carefully tailored to\ninterfere only with desegregative busing.\u201d Id., at 471. The\nSeattle Court, accepting the validity of the school board\u2019s\nbusing remedy as a predicate to its analysis of the consti-\ntutional question, found that the State\u2019s disapproval of the\nschool board\u2019s busing remedy was an aggravation of the\nvery racial injury in which the State itself was complicit.\n   The broad language used in Seattle, however, went well\nbeyond the analysis needed to resolve the case. The Court\nthere seized upon the statement in Justice Harlan\u2019s con-\ncurrence in Hunter that the procedural change in that case\nhad \u201cthe clear purpose of making it more difficult for\ncertain racial and religious minorities to achieve legisla-\ntion that is in their interest.\u201d 385 U. S., at 395. That\nlanguage, taken in the context of the facts in Hunter, is\nbest read simply to describe the necessity for finding an\nequal protection violation where specific injuries from\nhostile discrimination were at issue. The Seattle Court,\nhowever, used the language from the Hunter concurrence\nto establish a new and far-reaching rationale. Seattle\nstated that where a government policy \u201cinures primarily\nto the benefit of the minority\u201d and \u201cminorities . . . con-\nsider\u201d the policy to be \u201c \u2018in their interest,\u2019 \u201d then any state\naction that \u201cplace[s] effective decisionmaking authority\nover\u201d that policy \u201cat a different level of government\u201d must\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             11\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nbe reviewed under strict scrutiny. 458 U. S., at 472, 474.\nIn essence, according to the broad reading of Seattle, any\nstate action with a \u201cracial focus\u201d that makes it \u201cmore\ndifficult for certain racial minorities than for other groups\u201d\nto \u201cachieve legislation that is in their interest\u201d is subject to\nstrict scrutiny. It is this reading of Seattle that the Court\nof Appeals found to be controlling here. And that reading\nmust be rejected.\n    The broad rationale that the Court of Appeals adopted\ngoes beyond the necessary holding and the meaning of the\nprecedents said to support it; and in the instant case\nneither the formulation of the general rule just set forth\nnor the precedents cited to authenticate it suffice to inval-\nidate Proposal 2. The expansive reading of Seattle has no\nprincipled limitation and raises serious questions of com-\npatibility with the Court\u2019s settled equal protection juris-\nprudence. To the extent Seattle is read to require the\nCourt to determine and declare which political policies\nserve the \u201cinterest\u201d of a group defined in racial terms, that\nrationale was unnecessary to the decision in Seattle; it has\nno support in precedent; and it raises serious constitu-\ntional concerns. That expansive language does not provide\na proper guide for decisions and should not be deemed\nauthoritative or controlling. The rule that the Court of\nAppeals elaborated and respondents seek to establish here\nwould contradict central equal protection principles.\n    In cautioning against \u201cimpermissible racial stereotypes,\u201d\nthis Court has rejected the assumption that \u201cmembers of\nthe same racial group\u2014regardless of their age, education,\neconomic status, or the community in which they live\u2014\nthink alike, share the same political interests, and will\nprefer the same candidates at the polls.\u201d Shaw v. Reno,\n509 U. S. 630, 647 (1993); see also Metro Broadcasting,\nInc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 636 (1990) (KENNEDY, J., dis-\nsenting) (rejecting the \u201cdemeaning notion that members of\n. . . defined racial groups ascribe to certain \u2018minority views\u2019\n12                  SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nthat must be different from those of other citizens\u201d). It\ncannot be entertained as a serious proposition that all\nindividuals of the same race think alike. Yet that proposi-\ntion would be a necessary beginning point were the Seattle\nformulation to control, as the Court of Appeals held it did\nin this case. And if it were deemed necessary to probe how\nsome races define their own interest in political matters,\nstill another beginning point would be to define individu-\nals according to race. But in a society in which those lines\nare becoming more blurred, the attempt to define race-\nbased categories also raises serious questions of its own.\nGovernment action that classifies individuals on the basis\nof race is inherently suspect and carries the danger of\nperpetuating the very racial divisions the polity seeks to\ntranscend. Cf. Ho v. San Francisco Unified School Dist.,\n147 F. 3d 854, 858 (CA9 1998) (school district delineating\n13 racial categories for purposes of racial balancing).\nWere courts to embark upon this venture not only would it\nbe undertaken with no clear legal standards or accepted\nsources to guide judicial decision but also it would result\nin, or at least impose a high risk of, inquiries and catego-\nries dependent upon demeaning stereotypes, classifica-\ntions of questionable constitutionality on their own terms.\n   Even assuming these initial steps could be taken in a\nmanner consistent with a sound analytic and judicial\nframework, the court would next be required to determine\nthe policy realms in which certain groups\u2014groups defined\nby race\u2014have a political interest. That undertaking,\nagain without guidance from any accepted legal stand-\nards, would risk, in turn, the creation of incentives for\nthose who support or oppose certain policies to cast the\ndebate in terms of racial advantage or disadvantage. Thus\ncould racial antagonisms and conflict tend to arise in the\ncontext of judicial decisions as courts undertook to an-\nnounce what particular issues of public policy should be\nclassified as advantageous to some group defined by race.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nThis risk is inherent in adopting the Seattle formulation.\n   There would be no apparent limiting standards defining\nwhat public policies should be included in what Seattle\ncalled policies that \u201cinur[e] primarily to the benefit of the\nminority\u201d and that \u201cminorities . . . consider\u201d to be \u201c \u2018in\ntheir interest.\u2019 \u201d 458 U. S., at 472, 474. Those who seek to\nrepresent the interests of particular racial groups could\nattempt to advance those aims by demanding an equal\nprotection ruling that any number of matters be foreclosed\nfrom voter review or participation. In a nation in which\ngovernmental policies are wide ranging, those who seek to\nlimit voter participation might be tempted, were this\nCourt to adopt the Seattle formulation, to urge that a\ngroup they choose to define by race or racial stereotypes\nare advantaged or disadvantaged by any number of laws\nor decisions. Tax policy, housing subsidies, wage regula-\ntions, and even the naming of public schools, highways,\nand monuments are just a few examples of what could\nbecome a list of subjects that some organizations could\ninsist should be beyond the power of voters to decide, or\nbeyond the power of a legislature to decide when enacting\nlimits on the power of local authorities or other govern-\nmental entities to address certain subjects. Racial division\nwould be validated, not discouraged, were the Seattle\nformulation, and the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in\nthis case, to remain in force.\n   Perhaps, when enacting policies as an exercise of demo-\ncratic self-government, voters will determine that race-\nbased preferences should be adopted. The constitutional\nvalidity of some of those choices regarding racial prefer-\nences is not at issue here. The holding in the instant case\nis simply that the courts may not disempower the voters\nfrom choosing which path to follow. In the realm of policy\ndiscussions the regular give-and-take of debate ought to be\na context in which rancor or discord based on race are\navoided, not invited. And if these factors are to be inter-\n14                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\njected, surely it ought not to be at the invitation or insist-\nence of the courts.\n   One response to these concerns may be that objections\nto the larger consequences of the Seattle formulation need\nnot be confronted in this case, for here race was an un-\ndoubted subject of the ballot issue. But a number of prob-\nlems raised by Seattle, such as racial definitions, still\napply. And this principal flaw in the ruling of the Court of\nAppeals does remain: Here there was no infliction of a\nspecific injury of the kind at issue in Mulkey and Hunter\nand in the history of the Seattle schools. Here there is no\nprecedent for extending these cases to restrict the right of\nMichigan voters to determine that race-based preferences\ngranted by Michigan governmental entities should be\nended.\n   It should also be noted that the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals in this case of necessity calls into question other\nlong-settled rulings on similar state policies. The Califor-\nnia Supreme Court has held that a California constitu-\ntional amendment prohibiting racial preferences in public\ncontracting does not violate the rule set down by Seattle.\nCoral Constr., Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, 50\nCal. 4th 315, 235 P. 3d 947 (2010). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit has held that the same amendment,\nwhich also barred racial preferences in public education,\ndoes not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Wilson, 122\nF. 3d 692 (1997). If the Court were to affirm the essential\nrationale of the Court of Appeals in the instant case, those\nholdings would be invalidated, or at least would be put in\nserious question. The Court, by affirming the judgment\nnow before it, in essence would announce a finding that\nthe past 15 years of state public debate on this issue have\nbeen improper. And were the argument made that Coral\nmight still stand because it involved racial preferences in\npublic contracting while this case concerns racial prefer-\nences in university admissions, the implication would be\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nthat the constitutionality of laws forbidding racial prefer-\nences depends on the policy interest at stake, the concern\nthat, as already explained, the voters deem it wise to avoid\nbecause of its divisive potential. The instant case presents\nthe question involved in Coral and Wilson but not involved\nin Mulkey, Hunter, and Seattle. That question is not how\nto address or prevent injury caused on account of race but\nwhether voters may determine whether a policy of race-\nbased preferences should be continued.\n   By approving Proposal 2 and thereby adding \u00a726 to their\nState Constitution, the Michigan voters exercised their\nprivilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their demo-\ncratic power. In the federal system States \u201crespond,\nthrough the enactment of positive law, to the initiative of\nthose who seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own\ntimes.\u201d Bond, 564 U. S., at \u2013\u2013\u2013 (slip op., at 9). Michigan\nvoters used the initiative system to bypass public officials\nwho were deemed not responsive to the concerns of a\nmajority of the voters with respect to a policy of granting\nrace-based preferences that raises difficult and delicate\nissues.\n   The freedom secured by the Constitution consists, in one\nof its essential dimensions, of the right of the individual\nnot to be injured by the unlawful exercise of governmental\npower. The mandate for segregated schools, Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); a wrongful\ninvasion of the home, Silverman v. United States, 365\nU. S. 505 (1961); or punishing a protester whose views\noffend others, Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989); and\nscores of other examples teach that individual liberty has\nconstitutional protection, and that liberty\u2019s full extent and\nmeaning may remain yet to be discovered and affirmed.\nYet freedom does not stop with individual rights. Our\nconstitutional system embraces, too, the right of citizens to\ndebate so they can learn and decide and then, through the\npolitical process, act in concert to try to shape the course\n16                   SCHUETTE v.

Here Michigan voters acted in concert and\nstatewide to seek consensus and adopt a policy on a diffi-\ncult subject against a historical background of race in\nAmerica that has been a source of tragedy and persisting\ninjustice. That history demands that we continue to learn,\nto listen, and to remain open to new approaches if we are\nto aspire always to a constitutional order in which all\npersons are treated with fairness and equal dignity. Were\nthe Court to rule that the question addressed by Michigan\nvoters is too sensitive or complex to be within the grasp of\nthe electorate; or that the policies at issue remain too\ndelicate to be resolved save by university officials or facul-\nties, acting at some remove from immediate public scru-\ntiny and control; or that these matters are so arcane that\nthe electorate\u2019s power must be limited because the people\ncannot prudently exercise that power even after a full\ndebate, that holding would be an unprecedented re-\nstriction on the exercise of a fundamental right held not\njust by one person but by all in common. It is the right to\nspeak and debate and learn and then, as a matter of polit-\nical will, to act through a lawful electoral process.\n   The respondents in this case insist that a difficult ques-\ntion of public policy must be taken from the reach of the\nvoters, and thus removed from the realm of public discus-\nsion, dialogue, and debate in an election campaign. Quite\nin addition to the serious First Amendment implications of\nthat position with respect to any particular election, it is\ninconsistent with the underlying premises of a responsi-\nble, functioning democracy. One of those premises is that\na democracy has the capacity\u2014and the duty\u2014to learn\nfrom its past mistakes; to discover and confront persisting\nbiases; and by respectful, rationale deliberation to rise\nabove those flaws and injustices. That process is impeded,\nnot advanced, by court decrees based on the proposition\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nthat the public cannot have the requisite repose to discuss\ncertain issues. It is demeaning to the democratic process\nto presume that the voters are not capable of deciding an\nissue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds.\nThe process of public discourse and political debate should\nnot be foreclosed even if there is a risk that during a pub-\nlic campaign there will be those, on both sides, who seek to\nuse racial division and discord to their own political ad-\nvantage. An informed public can, and must, rise above\nthis. The idea of democracy is that it can, and must,\nmature. Freedom embraces the right, indeed the duty, to\nengage in a rational, civic discourse in order to determine\nhow best to form a consensus to shape the destiny of the\nNation and its people. These First Amendment dynamics\nwould be disserved if this Court were to say that the ques-\ntion here at issue is beyond the capacity of the voters to\ndebate and then to determine.\n   These precepts are not inconsistent with the well-\nestablished principle that when hurt or injury is inflicted\non racial minorities by the encouragement or command of\nlaws or other state action, the Constitution requires re-\ndress by the courts. Cf. Johnson v. California, 543 U. S.\n499, 511\u2013512 (2005) (\u201c[S]earching judicial review . . . is\nnecessary to guard against invidious discrimination\u201d);\nEdmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 619\n(1991) (\u201cRacial discrimination\u201d is \u201cinvidious in all con-\ntexts\u201d). As already noted, those were the circumstances\nthat the Court found present in Mulkey, Hunter, and\nSeattle. But those circumstances are not present here.\n   For reasons already discussed, Mulkey, Hunter, and\nSeattle are not precedents that stand for the conclusion\nthat Michigan\u2019s voters must be disempowered from acting.\nThose cases were ones in which the political restriction in\nquestion was designed to be used, or was likely to be used,\nto encourage infliction of injury by reason of race. What is\nat stake here is not whether injury will be inflicted but\n18                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nwhether government can be instructed not to follow a\ncourse that entails, first, the definition of racial categories\nand, second, the grant of favored status to persons in some\nracial categories and not others. The electorate\u2019s instruc-\ntion to governmental entities not to embark upon the\ncourse of race-defined and race-based preferences was\nadopted, we must assume, because the voters deemed a\npreference system to be unwise, on account of what voters\nmay deem its latent potential to become itself a source of\nthe very resentments and hostilities based on race that\nthis Nation seeks to put behind it. Whether those adverse\nresults would follow is, and should be, the subject of de-\nbate. Voters might likewise consider, after debate and\nreflection, that programs designed to increase diversity\u2014\nconsistent with the Constitution\u2014are a necessary part of\nprogress to transcend the stigma of past racism.\n   This case is not about how the debate about racial pref-\nerences should be resolved. It is about who may resolve it.\nThere is no authority in the Constitution of the United\nStates or in this Court\u2019s precedents for the Judiciary to set\naside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination\nto the voters. See Sailors v. Board of Ed. of County of\nKent, 387 U. S. 105, 109 (1967) (\u201cSave and unless the\nstate, county, or municipal government runs afoul of a\nfederally protected right, it has vast leeway in the man-\nagement of its internal affairs\u201d). Deliberative debate on\nsensitive issues such as racial preferences all too often\nmay shade into rancor. But that does not justify removing\ncertain court-determined issues from the voters\u2019 reach.\nDemocracy does not presume that some subjects are either\ntoo divisive or too profound for public debate.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is reversed.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Called upon to explore the jurispru-\ndential twilight zone between two errant lines of prece-\ndent, we confront a frighteningly bizarre question: Does\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment forbid what its text plainly requires? Needless to say\n(except that this case obliges us to say it), the question\nanswers itself. \u201cThe Constitution proscribes government\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided\neducation is no exception.\u201d Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S.\n306, 349 (2003) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dis-\nsenting in part). It is precisely this understanding\u2014the\ncorrect understanding\u2014of the federal Equal Protection\nClause that the people of the State of Michigan have\nadopted for their own fundamental law. By adopting it,\nthey did not simultaneously offend it.\n  Even taking this Court\u2019s sorry line of race-based-\nadmissions cases as a given, I find the question presented\nonly slightly less strange: Does the Equal Protection\nClause forbid a State from banning a practice that the\nClause barely\u2014and only provisionally\u2014permits? React-\n2                       SCHUETTE v.

S.,\nat 343; or simply opposed in principle to the notion of\n\u201cbenign\u201d racial discrimination\u2014have gotten out of the\nracial-preferences business altogether. And with our\nexpress encouragement: \u201cUniversities in California, Flor-\nida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in\nadmissions are prohibited by state law, are currently\nengaging in experimenting with a wide variety of alterna-\ntive approaches. Universities in other States can and\nshould draw on the most promising aspects of these race-\nneutral alternatives as they develop.\u201d Id., at 342 (empha-\nsis added). Respondents seem to think this admonition\nwas merely in jest.1 The experiment, they maintain, is not\nonly over; it never rightly began. Neither the people of the\nStates nor their legislatures ever had the option of direct-\ning subordinate public-university officials to cease consid-\nering the race of applicants, since that would deny mem-\nbers of those minority groups the option of enacting a\npolicy designed to further their interest, thus denying\nthem the equal protection of the laws. Never mind that it\nis hotly disputed whether the practice of race-based ad-\nmissions is ever in a racial minority\u2019s interest. Cf. id., at\n371\u2013373 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). And never mind that, were a public university to\nstake its defense of a race-based-admissions policy on the\nground that it was designed to benefit primarily minorities\n(as opposed to all students, regardless of color, by enhanc-\ning diversity), we would hold the policy unconstitutional.\nSee id., at 322\u2013325.\n   But the battleground for this case is not the constitu-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For simplicity\u2019s sake, I use \u201crespondent\u201d or \u201crespondents\u201d through-\n\nout the opinion to describe only those parties who are adverse to\npetitioner, not Eric Russell, a respondent who supports petitioner.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Seattle\nSchool Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457 (1982), and Hunter v.\nErickson, 393 U. S. 385 (1969). I agree with those parts of\nthe plurality opinion that repudiate this doctrine. But I do\nnot agree with its reinterpretation of Seattle and Hunter,\nwhich makes them stand in part for the cloudy and doctri-\nnally anomalous proposition that whenever state action\nposes \u201cthe serious risk . . . of causing specific injuries on\naccount of race,\u201d it denies equal protection. Ante, at 9. I\nwould instead reaffirm that the \u201cordinary principles of our\nlaw [and] of our democratic heritage\u201d require \u201cplaintiffs\nalleging equal protection violations\u201d stemming from fa-\ncially neutral acts to \u201cprove intent and causation and not\nmerely the existence of racial disparity.\u201d Freeman v. Pitts,\n503 U. S. 467, 506 (1992) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (citing\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976)). I would fur-\nther hold that a law directing state actors to provide equal\nprotection is (to say the least) facially neutral, and cannot\nviolate the Constitution. Section 26 of the Michigan Con-\nstitution (formerly Proposal 2) rightly stands.\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n   The political-process doctrine has its roots in two of our\ncases. The first is Hunter. In 1964, the Akron City Coun-\ncil passed a fair-housing ordinance \u201c \u2018assur[ing] equal\nopportunity to all persons to live in decent housing facili-\nties regardless of race, color, religion, ancestry or national\norigin.\u2019 \u201d 393 U. S., at 386. Soon after, the city\u2019s voters\npassed an amendment to the Akron City Charter stating\nthat any ordinance enacted by the council that \u201c \u2018regu-\nlates\u2019 \u201d commercial transactions in real property \u201c \u2018on the\nbasis of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry\u2019 \u201d\u2014\nincluding the already enacted 1964 ordinance\u2014\u201cmust first\n4                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbe approved by a majority of the electors voting on the\nquestion\u201d at a later referendum. Id., at 387. The question\nwas whether the charter amendment denied equal protec-\ntion. Answering yes, the Court explained that \u201calthough\nthe law on its face treats Negro and white, Jew and gentile\nin an identical manner, the reality is that the law\u2019s impact\nfalls on the minority. The majority needs no protection\nagainst discrimination.\u201d Id., at 391. By placing a \u201cspecial\nburden on racial minorities within the governmental\nprocesses,\u201d the amendment \u201cdisadvantage[d]\u201d a racial\nminority \u201cby making it more difficult to enact legislation\nin its behalf.\u201d Id., at 391, 393.\n   The reasoning in Seattle is of a piece. Resolving to\n\u201celiminate all [racial] imbalance from the Seattle public\nschools,\u201d the city school board passed a mandatory busing\nand pupil-reassignment plan of the sort typically imposed\non districts guilty of de jure segregation. 458 U. S., at\n460\u2013461. A year later, the citizens of the State of Wash-\nington passed Initiative 350, which directed (with excep-\ntions) that \u201c \u2018no school . . . shall directly or indirectly re-\nquire any student to attend a school other than the school\nwhich is geographically nearest or next nearest the stu-\ndent\u2019s place of residence . . . and which offers the course of\nstudy pursued by such student,\u2019 \u201d permitting only court-\nordered race-based busing. Id., at 462. The lower courts\nheld Initiative 350 unconstitutional, and we affirmed,\nannouncing in the prelude of our analysis\u2014as though it\nwere beyond debate\u2014that the Equal Protection Clause\nforbade laws that \u201csubtly distor[t] governmental processes\nin such a way as to place special burdens on the ability of\nminority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.\u201d Id., at\n467.\n   The first question in Seattle was whether the subject\nmatter of Initiative 350 was a \u201c \u2018racial\u2019 issue,\u201d triggering\nHunter and its process doctrine. 458 U. S., at 471\u2013472. It\nwas \u201cundoubtedly. . . true\u201d that whites and blacks were\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201ccounted among both the supporters and the opponents of\nInitiative 350.\u201d Id., at 472. It was \u201cequally clear\u201d that\nboth white and black children benefited from desegre-\ngated schools. Ibid. Nonetheless, we concluded that desegre-\ngation \u201cinures primarily to the benefit of the minority, and\nis designed for that purpose.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). In\nany event, it was \u201cenough that minorities may consider\nbusing for integration to be \u2018legislation that is in their\ninterest.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 474 (quoting Hunter, supra, at 395\n(Harlan, J., concurring)).\n   So we proceeded to the heart of the political-process\nanalysis. We held Initiative 350 unconstitutional, since it\nremoved \u201cthe authority to address a racial problem\u2014and\nonly a racial problem\u2014from the existing decisionmaking\nbody, in such a way as to burden minority interests.\u201d\nSeattle, 458 U. S., at 474. Although school boards in\nWashington retained authority over other student-\nassignment issues and over most matters of educational\npolicy generally, under Initiative 350, minorities favoring\nrace-based busing would have to \u201csurmount a considerably\nhigher hurdle\u201d than the mere petitioning of a local assem-\nbly: They \u201cnow must seek relief from the state legislature,\nor from the statewide electorate,\u201d a \u201cdifferent level of\ngovernment.\u201d Ibid.\n   The relentless logic of Hunter and Seattle would point to\na similar conclusion in this case. In those cases, one level\nof government exercised borrowed authority over an ap-\nparently \u201cracial issue,\u201d until a higher level of government\ncalled the loan. So too here. In those cases, we deemed\nthe revocation an equal-protection violation regardless of\nwhether it facially classified according to race or reflected\nan invidious purpose to discriminate. Here, the Court of\nAppeals did the same.\n   The plurality sees it differently. Though it, too, dis-\navows the political-process-doctrine basis on which Hunter\nand Seattle were decided, ante, at 10\u201314, it does not take\n6                        SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe next step of overruling those cases. Rather, it reinter-\nprets them beyond recognition. Hunter, the plurality\nsuggests, was a case in which the challenged act had\n\u201ctarget[ed] racial minorities.\u201d Ante, at 8. Maybe, but the\nHunter Court neither found that to be so nor considered it\nrelevant, bypassing the question of intent entirely, satis-\nfied that its newly minted political-process theory sufficed\nto invalidate the charter amendment.\n   As for Seattle, what was really going on, according to the\nplurality, was that Initiative 350 had the consequence (if\nnot the purpose) of preserving the harms effected by prior\nde jure segregation. Thus, \u201cthe political restriction in\nquestion was designed to be used, or was likely to be used,\nto encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.\u201d Ante,\nat 17. That conclusion is derived not from the opinion but\nfrom recently discovered evidence that the city of Seattle\nhad been a cause of its schools\u2019 racial imbalance all along:\n\u201cAlthough there had been no judicial finding of de jure\nsegregation with respect to Seattle\u2019s school district, it\nappears as though school segregation in the district in the\n1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s may have been the partial result of\nschool board policies.\u201d Ante, at 9.2 That the district\u2019s\neffort to end racial imbalance had been stymied by Initia-\ntive 350 meant that the people, by passing it, somehow\nhad become complicit in Seattle\u2019s equal-protection-denying\nstatus quo, whether they knew it or not. Hence, there\nwas in Seattle a government-furthered \u201cinfliction of a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The plurality cites evidence from JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s dissent in Par\u00ad\n\nents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551\nU. S. 701 (2007), to suggest that the city had been a \u201cpartial\u201d cause of\nits segregation problem. Ante, at 9. The plurality in Parents Involved\ncriticized that dissent for relying on irrelevant evidence, for \u201celid[ing\nthe] distinction between de jure and de facto segregation,\u201d and for\n\u201ccasually intimat[ing] that Seattle\u2019s school attendance patterns re-\nflect[ed] illegal segregation.\u201d 551 U.

Nor did it\nanywhere state that the current racial imbalance was the\n(judicially remediable) effect of prior de jure segregation.\nAbsence of de jure segregation or the effects of de jure\nsegregation was a necessary premise of the Seattle opin-\nion. That is what made the issue of busing and pupil\nreassignment a matter of political choice rather than\njudicial mandate.3 And precisely because it was a question\nfor the political branches to decide, the manner\u2014which is\nto say, the process\u2014of its resolution implicated the Court\u2019s\nnew process theory. The opinion itself says this: \u201c[I]n the\nabsence of a constitutional violation, the desirability and\nefficacy of school desegregation are matters to be resolved\nthrough the political process. For present purposes, it is\nenough [to hold reallocation of that political decision to a\nhigher level unconstitutional] that minorities may consider\nbusing for integration to be legislation that is in their\ninterest.\u201d 458 U.

S.,\nat 473. Seattle takes a couple of dissatisfying cracks at\ndefining this crucial term. It suggests that an issue is\nracial if adopting one position on the question would \u201cat\nbottom inur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority, and\nis designed for that purpose.\u201d Id., at 472. It is irrelevant\nthat, as in Hunter and Seattle, 458 U. S., at 472, both the\nracial minority and the racial majority benefit from the\npolicy in question, and members of both groups favor it.\nJudges should instead focus their guesswork on their own\njuridical sense of what is primarily for the benefit of mi-\nnorities. Cf. ibid. (regarding as dispositive what \u201cour\ncases\u201d suggest is beneficial to minorities). On second\nthought, maybe judges need only ask this question: Is it\npossible \u201cthat minorities may consider\u201d the policy in ques-\ntion to be \u201cin their interest\u201d? Id., at 474. If so, you can be\nsure that you are dealing with a \u201cracial issue.\u201d4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent\u2019s version of this test is just as scattershot. Since, ac-\n\ncording to the dissent, the doctrine forbids \u201creconfigur[ing] the political\nprocess in a manner that burdens only a racial minority,\u201d post, at 5\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (emphasis added), it must be that the reason\nthe underlying issue (that is, the issue concerning which the process\nhas been reconfigured) is \u201cracial\u201d is that the policy in question benefits\nonly a racial minority (if it also benefited persons not belonging to a\nracial majority, then the political-process reconfiguration would burden\nthem as well). On second thought: The issue is \u201cracial\u201d if the policy\nbenefits primarily a racial minority and \u201c \u2018[is] designed for that pur-\npose,\u2019 \u201d post, at 44. This is the standard Seattle purported to apply. But\nunder that standard, \u00a726 does not affect a \u201cracial issue,\u201d because under\nGrutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003), race-based admissions\npolicies may not constitutionally be \u201cdesigned for [the] purpose,\u201d\nSeattle, supra, at 472, of benefiting primarily racial minorities, but\nmust be designed for the purpose of achieving educational benefits for\nstudents of all races, Grutter, supra, at 322\u2013325.

It seems to me quite the opposite.\nAmending the Constitution requires the approval of only\n\u201ca majority of the electors voting on the question.\u201d Mich.\nConst., Art. XII, \u00a72. By contrast, voting in a favorable\nboard (each of which has eight members) at the three\nmajor public universities requires electing by majority\nvote at least 15 different candidates, several of whom\nwould be running during different election cycles. See\nBAMN v. Regents of Univ. of Mich., 701 F. 3d 466, 508\n(CA6 2012) (Sutton, J., dissenting). So if Michigan voters,\ninstead of amending their Constitution, had pursued the\ndissent\u2019s preferred path of electing board members promis-\ning to \u201cabolish race-sensitive admissions policies,\u201d post, at\n3, it would have been harder, not easier, for racial minori-\nties favoring affirmative action to overturn that decision.\nBut the more important point is that we should not design\nour jurisprudence to conform to dictum in a footnote in a\nfour-Justice opinion.\n                             C\n  Moving from the appalling to the absurd, I turn now to\nthe second part of the Hunter-Seattle analysis\u2014which is\napparently no more administrable than the first, compare\npost, at 4\u20136 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cThis\ncase . . . does not involve a reordering of the political\nprocess\u201d), with post, at 25\u201329 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting)\n(yes, it does).

S., at 474.\nThe laws in both Hunter and Seattle were thought to fail\nthis test. In both cases, \u201cthe effect of the challenged\naction was to redraw decisionmaking authority over racial\nmatters\u2014and only over racial matters\u2014in such a way as\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

This, we said, a State may not do.\n   By contrast, in another line of cases, we have empha-\nsized the near-limitless sovereignty of each State to design\nits governing structure as it sees fit. Generally, \u201ca State is\nafforded wide leeway when experimenting with the appro-\npriate allocation of state legislative power\u201d and may create\n\u201cpolitical subdivisions such as cities and counties . . . \u2018as\nconvenient agencies for exercising such of the governmen-\ntal powers of the state as may be entrusted to them.\u2019 \u201d\nHolt Civic Club v. Tuscaloosa, 439 U. S. 60, 71 (1978)\n(quoting Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161, 178 (1907)).\nAccordingly, States have \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d to deter-\nmine the \u201cnumber, nature and duration of the powers\nconferred upon [municipal] corporations and the territory\nover which they shall be exercised.\u201d Holt Civic Club,\nsupra, at 71. So it would seem to go without saying that a\nState may give certain powers to cities, later assign the\nsame powers to counties, and even reclaim them for itself.\n   Taken to the limits of its logic, Hunter-Seattle is the\ngaping exception that nearly swallows the rule of struc-\ntural state sovereignty. If indeed the Fourteenth Amend-\nment forbids States to \u201cplace effective decisionmaking\nauthority over\u201d racial issues at \u201cdifferent level[s] of gov-\nernment,\u201d then it must be true that the Amendment\u2019s\nratification in 1868 worked a partial ossification of each\nState\u2019s governing structure, rendering basically irrevoca-\nble the power of any subordinate state official who, the\nday before the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s passage, hap-\npened to enjoy legislatively conferred authority over a\n\u201cracial issue.\u201d Under the Fourteenth Amendment, that\nsubordinate entity (suppose it is a city council) could itself\ntake action on the issue, action either favorable or unfa-\nvorable to minorities. It could even reverse itself later.\nWhat it could not do, however, is redelegate its power to\nan even lower level of state government (such as a city-\n14                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncouncil committee) without forfeiting it, since the neces-\nsary effect of wresting it back would be to put an additional\nobstacle in the path of minorities. Likewise, no entity\nor official higher up the state chain (e.g., a county board)\ncould exercise authority over the issue. Nor, even, could\nthe state legislature, or the people by constitutional\namendment, revoke the legislative conferral of power to\nthe subordinate, whether the city council, its subcommit-\ntee, or the county board. Seattle\u2019s logic would create\naffirmative-action safe havens wherever subordinate offi-\ncials in public universities (1) traditionally have enjoyed\n\u201ceffective decisionmaking authority\u201d over admissions\npolicy but (2) have not yet used that authority to prohibit\nrace-conscious admissions decisions. The mere existence\nof a subordinate\u2019s discretion over the matter would work a\nkind of reverse pre-emption. It is \u201ca strange notion\u2014alien\nto our system\u2014that local governmental bodies can forever\npre-empt the ability of a State\u2014the sovereign power\u2014to\naddress a matter of compelling concern to the State.\u201d 458\nU. S., at 495 (Powell, J., dissenting). But that is precisely\nwhat the political-process doctrine contemplates.\n   Perhaps the spirit of Seattle is especially disquieted by\nenactments of constitutional amendments. That appears\nto be the dissent\u2019s position. The problem with \u00a726, it\nsuggests, is that amending Michigan\u2019s Constitution is\nsimply not a part of that State\u2019s \u201cexisting\u201d political pro-\ncess. E.g., post, at 4, 41. What a peculiar notion: that a\nrevision of a State\u2019s fundamental law, made in precisely\nthe manner that law prescribes, by the very people who\nare the source of that law\u2019s authority, is not part of the\n\u201cpolitical process\u201d which, but for those people and that\nlaw, would not exist. This will surely come as news to the\npeople of Michigan, who, since 1914, have amended their\nConstitution 20 times. Brief for Gary Segura et al. as\nAmici Curiae 12.

That is\nparticularly true of statutes mandating equal treatment.\n\u201c[A] law that prohibits the State from classifying individu-\nals by race . . . a fortiori does not classify individuals by\nrace.\u201d Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F. 3d\n692, 702 (CA9 1997) (O\u2019Scannlain, J.).\n  Thus, the question in this case, as in every case in which\nneutral state action is said to deny equal protection on\naccount of race, is whether the action reflects a racially\ndiscriminatory purpose. Seattle stresses that \u201csingling out\nthe political processes affecting racial issues for uniquely\ndisadvantageous treatment inevitably raises dangers of\nimpermissible motivation.\u201d 458 U. S., at 486, n. 30. True\nenough, but that motivation must be proved. And re-\nspondents do not have a prayer of proving it here. The\nDistrict Court noted that, under \u201cconventional equal\nprotection\u201d doctrine, the suit was \u201cdoom[ed].\u201d 539 F. Supp.\n2d 924, 951 (ED Mich. 2008). Though the Court of Ap-\npeals did not opine on this question, I would not leave it\nfor them on remand. In my view, any law expressly re-\nquiring state actors to afford all persons equal protection\nof the laws (such as Initiative 350 in Seattle, though not\nthe charter amendment in Hunter) does not\u2014cannot\u2014\ndeny \u201cto any person . . . equal protection of the laws,\u201d U.

Const., Art. I, \u00a726. We here\nfocus on the prohibition of \u201cgrant[ing] . . . preferential\ntreatment . . . on the basis of race . . . in . . . public educa-\ntion.\u201d I agree with the plurality that the amendment is\nconsistent with the Federal Equal Protection Clause.\nU. S. Const., Amdt. 14. But I believe this for different\nreasons.\n   First, we do not address the amendment insofar as it\nforbids the use of race-conscious admissions programs\ndesigned to remedy past exclusionary racial discrimina-\ntion or the direct effects of that discrimination. Applica-\ntion of the amendment in that context would present\ndifferent questions which may demand different answers.\nRather, we here address the amendment only as it applies\nto, and forbids, programs that, as in Grutter v. Bollinger,\n539 U. S. 306 (2003), rest upon \u201cone justification\u201d: using\n2                    SCHUETTE v.

Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701 (2007),\nI explained why I believe race-conscious programs of this\nkind are constitutional, whether implemented by law\nschools, universities, high schools, or elementary schools.\nI concluded that the Constitution does not \u201cauthorize\njudges\u201d either to forbid or to require the adoption of diver-\nsity-seeking race-conscious \u201csolutions\u201d (of the kind at issue\nhere) to such serious problems as \u201chow best to administer\nAmerica\u2019s schools\u201d to help \u201ccreate a society that includes\nall Americans.\u201d Id., at 862.\n   I continue to believe that the Constitution permits,\nthough it does not require, the use of the kind of race-\nconscious programs that are now barred by the Michigan\nConstitution. The serious educational problems that faced\nAmericans at the time this Court decided Grutter endure.\nSee, e.g., I. Mullis, M. Martin, P. Foy, & K. Drucker,\nProgress in International Reading Literacy Study, 2011\nInternational Results in Reading 38, Exh. 1.1 (2012)\n(elementary-school students in numerous other countries\noutperform their counterparts in the United States in\nreading); I.

And low educa-\ntional achievement continues to be correlated with income\nand race. See, e.g., National Center for Education Statis-\ntics, Digest of Education Statistics, Advance Release of\nSelected 2013 Digest Tables (Table 104.20) (White Ameri-\ncans more likely to have completed high school than\nAfrican-Americans or Hispanic-Americans), online at\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest (as visited Apr. 15,\n2014, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); id., Table\n219.75 (Americans in bottom quartile of income most\nlikely to drop out of high school); id., Table 302.60 (White\nAmericans more likely to enroll in college than African-\nAmericans or Hispanic-Americans); id., Table 302.30\n(middle- and high-income Americans more likely to enroll\nin college than low-income Americans).\n   The Constitution allows local, state, and national com-\nmunities to adopt narrowly tailored race-conscious pro-\ngrams designed to bring about greater inclusion and di-\nversity. But the Constitution foresees the ballot box, not\nthe courts, as the normal instrument for resolving differ-\nences and debates about the merits of these programs.\nCompare Parents Involved, 551 U. S., at 839 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting) (identifying studies showing the benefits of\nracially integrated education), with id., at 761\u2013763\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (identifying studies suggesting\nracially integrated schools may not confer educational\nbenefits). In short, the \u201cConstitution creates a democratic\npolitical system through which the people themselves\nmust together find answers\u201d to disagreements of this kind.\nId., at 862 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n   Third, cases such as Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385\n(1969), and Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458\nU. S. 457 (1982), reflect an important principle, namely,\nthat an individual\u2019s ability to participate meaningfully in\nthe political process should be independent of his race.\nAlthough racial minorities, like other political minorities,\n4                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwill not always succeed at the polls, they must have the\nsame opportunity as others to secure through the ballot\nbox policies that reflect their preferences. In my view,\nhowever, neither Hunter nor Seattle applies here. And the\nparties do not here suggest that the amendment violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause if not under the Hunter-\nSeattle doctrine.\n   Hunter and Seattle involved efforts to manipulate the\npolitical process in a way not here at issue. Both cases\ninvolved a restructuring of the political process that\nchanged the political level at which policies were enacted.\nIn Hunter, decisionmaking was moved from the elected\ncity council to the local electorate at large. 393 U. S., at\n389\u2013390. And in Seattle, decisionmaking by an elected\nschool board was replaced with decisionmaking by the\nstate legislature and electorate at large. 458 U. S., at 466.\n   This case, in contrast, does not involve a reordering of\nthe political process; it does not in fact involve the move-\nment of decisionmaking from one political level to another.\nRather, here, Michigan law delegated broad policymaking\nauthority to elected university boards, see Mich. Const.,\nArt. VIII, \u00a75, but those boards delegated admissions-\nrelated decisionmaking authority to unelected university\nfaculty members and administrators, see, e.g., Bylaws of\nUniv. of Mich. Bd. of Regents \u00a78.01; Mich. State Univ.\nBylaws of Bd. of Trustees, Preamble; Mich. State Univ.\nBylaws for Academic Governance \u00a74.4.3; Wayne State\nUniv. Stat. \u00a7\u00a72\u201334\u201309, 2\u201334\u201312. Although the boards\nunquestionably retained the power to set policy regarding\nrace-conscious     admissions,    see    post,   at    25\u201329\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting), in fact faculty members and\nadministrators set the race-conscious admissions policies\nin question.     (It is often true that elected bodies\u2014\nincluding, for example, school boards, city councils, and\nstate legislatures\u2014have the power to enact policies, but in\nfact delegate that power to administrators.) Although at\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlimited times the university boards were advised of the\ncontent of their race-conscious admissions policies, see 701\nF. 3d 466, 481\u2013482 (CA6 2012), to my knowledge no board\nvoted to accept or reject any of those policies. Thus, un-\nelected faculty members and administrators, not voters or\ntheir elected representatives, adopted the race-conscious\nadmissions programs affected by Michigan\u2019s constitutional\namendment. The amendment took decisionmaking au-\nthority away from these unelected actors and placed it in\nthe hands of the voters.\n   Why does this matter? For one thing, considered con-\nceptually, the doctrine set forth in Hunter and Seattle does\nnot easily fit this case. In those cases minorities had\nparticipated in the political process and they had won.\nThe majority\u2019s subsequent reordering of the political\nprocess repealed the minority\u2019s successes and made it\nmore difficult for the minority to succeed in the future.\nThe majority thereby diminished the minority\u2019s ability to\nparticipate meaningfully in the electoral process. But one\ncannot as easily characterize the movement of the deci-\nsionmaking mechanism at issue here\u2014from an adminis-\ntrative process to an electoral process\u2014as diminishing the\nminority\u2019s ability to participate meaningfully in the politi-\ncal process. There is no prior electoral process in which\nthe minority participated.\n   For another thing, to extend the holding of Hunter and\nSeattle to reach situations in which decisionmaking au-\nthority is moved from an administrative body to a political\none would pose significant difficulties. The administrative\nprocess encompasses vast numbers of decisionmakers\nanswering numerous policy questions in hosts of different\nfields. See Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Ac-\ncounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, ___ (2010) (BREYER,\nJ., dissenting). Administrative bodies modify programs in\ndetail, and decisionmaking authority within the adminis-\ntrative process frequently moves around\u2014due to amend-\n6                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nments to statutes, new administrative rules, and evolving\nagency practice. It is thus particularly difficult in this\ncontext for judges to determine when a change in the locus\nof decisionmaking authority places a comparative struc-\ntural burden on a racial minority. And to apply Hunter\nand Seattle to the administrative process would, by tend-\ning to hinder change, risk discouraging experimentation,\ninterfering with efforts to see when and how race-\nconscious policies work.\n   Finally, the principle that underlies Hunter and Seattle\nruns up against a competing principle, discussed above.\nThis competing principle favors decisionmaking through\nthe democratic process. Just as this principle strongly\nsupports the right of the people, or their elected repre-\nsentatives, to adopt race-conscious policies for reasons of\ninclusion, so must it give them the right to vote not to do\nso.\n   As I have said, my discussion here is limited to circum-\nstances in which decisionmaking is moved from an un-\nelected administrative body to a politically responsive one,\nand in which the targeted race-conscious admissions\nprograms consider race solely in order to obtain the educa-\ntional benefits of a diverse student body. We need now\ndecide no more than whether the Federal Constitution\npermits Michigan to apply its constitutional amendment\nin those circumstances. I would hold that it does. There-\nfore, I concur in the judgment of the Court.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

But\nwithout checks, democratically approved legislation can\noppress minority groups. For that reason, our Constitu-\ntion places limits on what a majority of the people may do.\nThis case implicates one such limit: the guarantee of equal\nprotection of the laws. Although that guarantee is tradi-\ntionally understood to prohibit intentional discrimination\nunder existing laws, equal protection does not end there.\nAnother fundamental strand of our equal protection juris-\nprudence focuses on process, securing to all citizens the\nright to participate meaningfully and equally in self-\ngovernment. That right is the bedrock of our democracy,\nfor it preserves all other rights.\n   Yet to know the history of our Nation is to understand\nits long and lamentable record of stymieing the right of\nracial minorities to participate in the political process. At\nfirst, the majority acted with an open, invidious purpose.\nNotwithstanding the command of the Fifteenth Amend-\nment, certain States shut racial minorities out of the\npolitical process altogether by withholding the right to\n2                        SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nvote. This Court intervened to preserve that right. The\nmajority tried again, replacing outright bans on voting\nwith literacy tests, good character requirements, poll\ntaxes, and gerrymandering. The Court was not fooled; it\ninvalidated those measures, too. The majority persisted.\nThis time, although it allowed the minority access to the\npolitical process, the majority changed the ground rules of\nthe process so as to make it more difficult for the minority,\nand the minority alone, to obtain policies designed to\nfoster racial integration. Although these political restruc-\nturings may not have been discriminatory in purpose, the\nCourt reaffirmed the right of minority members of our\nsociety to participate meaningfully and equally in the\npolitical process.\n  This case involves this last chapter of discrimination: A\nmajority of the Michigan electorate changed the basic\nrules of the political process in that State in a manner that\nuniquely disadvantaged racial minorities.1 Prior to the\nenactment of the constitutional initiative at issue here,\nall of the admissions policies of Michigan\u2019s public colleges\nand universities\u2014including race-sensitive admissions poli-\ncies2\u2014were in the hands of each institution\u2019s governing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 I of course do not mean to suggest that Michigan\u2019s voters acted with\n\nanything like the invidious intent, see n. 8, infra, of those who histori-\ncally stymied the rights of racial minorities. Contra, ante, at 18, n. 11\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). But like earlier chapters of\npolitical restructuring, the Michigan amendment at issue in this case\nchanged the rules of the political process to the disadvantage of minor-\nity members of our society.\n   2 Although the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d is commonly used to describe\n\ncolleges\u2019 and universities\u2019 use of race in crafting admissions policies, I\ninstead use the term \u201crace-sensitive admissions policies.\u201d Some com-\nprehend the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d as connoting intentional prefer-\nential treatment based on race alone\u2014for example, the use of a quota\nsystem, whereby a certain proportion of seats in an institution\u2019s incom-\ning class must be set aside for racial minorities; the use of a \u201cpoints\u201d\nsystem, whereby an institution accords a fixed numerical advantage to\nan applicant because of her race; or the admission of otherwise unquali-\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

The members of those boards are nominated by\npolitical parties and elected by the citizenry in statewide\nelections. After over a century of being shut out of Michi-\ngan\u2019s institutions of higher education, racial minorities in\nMichigan had succeeded in persuading the elected board\nrepresentatives to adopt admissions policies that took into\naccount the benefits of racial diversity. And this Court\ntwice blessed such efforts\u2014first in Regents of Univ. of Cal.\nv. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978), and again in Grutter v.\nBollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003), a case that itself concerned\na Michigan admissions policy.\n  In the wake of Grutter, some voters in Michigan set out\nto eliminate the use of race-sensitive admissions policies.\nThose voters were of course free to pursue this end in any\nnumber of ways. For example, they could have persuaded\nexisting board members to change their minds through\nindividual or grassroots lobbying efforts, or through gen-\neral public awareness campaigns. Or they could have\nmobilized efforts to vote uncooperative board members out\nof office, replacing them with members who would share\ntheir desire to abolish race-sensitive admissions policies.\nWhen this Court holds that the Constitution permits a\nparticular policy, nothing prevents a majority of a State\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfied students to an institution solely on account of their race. None of\nthis is an accurate description of the practices that public universities\nare permitted to adopt after this Court\u2019s decision in Grutter v. Bol\u00ad\nlinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003). There, we instructed that institutions of\nhigher education could consider race in admissions in only a very\nlimited way in an effort to create a diverse student body. To comport\nwith Grutter, colleges and universities must use race flexibly, id., at\n334, and must not maintain a quota, ibid. And even this limited\nsensitivity to race must be limited in time, id., at 341\u2013343, and must be\nemployed only after \u201cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-\nneutral alternatives,\u201d id., at 339. Grutter-compliant admissions plans,\nlike the ones in place at Michigan\u2019s institutions, are thus a far cry from\naffirmative action plans that confer preferential treatment intention-\nally and solely on the basis of race.\n4                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nvoters from choosing not to adopt that policy. Our system\nof government encourages\u2014and indeed, depends on\u2014that\ntype of democratic action.\n   But instead, the majority of Michigan voters changed\nthe rules in the middle of the game, reconfiguring the\nexisting political process in Michigan in a manner that\nburdened racial minorities. They did so in the 2006 elec-\ntion by amending the Michigan Constitution to enact Art.\nI, \u00a726, which provides in relevant part that Michigan\u2019s\npublic universities \u201cshall not discriminate against, or\ngrant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on\nthe basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in\nthe operation of public employment, public education, or\npublic contracting.\u201d\n   As a result of \u00a726, there are now two very different\nprocesses through which a Michigan citizen is permitted to\ninfluence the admissions policies of the State\u2019s universi-\nties: one for persons interested in race-sensitive admis-\nsions policies and one for everyone else. A citizen who is a\nUniversity of Michigan alumnus, for instance, can advo-\ncate for an admissions policy that considers an applicant\u2019s\nlegacy status by meeting individually with members of the\nBoard of Regents to convince them of her views, by joining\nwith other legacy parents to lobby the Board, or by voting\nfor and supporting Board candidates who share her posi-\ntion. The same options are available to a citizen who\nwants the Board to adopt admissions policies that consider\nathleticism, geography, area of study, and so on. The one\nand only policy a Michigan citizen may not seek through\nthis long-established process is a race-sensitive admissions\npolicy that considers race in an individualized manner\nwhen it is clear that race-neutral alternatives are not\nadequate to achieve diversity. For that policy alone, the\ncitizens of Michigan must undertake the daunting task of\namending the State Constitution.\n   Our precedents do not permit political restructurings\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

This\nCourt has held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not\ntolerate \u201ca political structure that treats all individuals as\nequals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in\nsuch a way as to place special burdens on the ability of\nminority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.\u201d Wash\u00ad\nington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, 467\n(1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such restruc-\nturing, the Court explained, \u201cis no more permissible than\ndenying [the minority] the [right to] vote, on an equal\nbasis with others.\u201d Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.

In those cases\u2014Hunter and Seattle\u2014the Court\nrecognized what is now known as the \u201cpolitical-process\ndoctrine\u201d: When the majority reconfigures the political\nprocess in a manner that burdens only a racial minority,\nthat alteration triggers strict judicial scrutiny.\n  Today, disregarding stare decisis, a majority of the\nCourt effectively discards those precedents. The plurality\ndoes so, it tells us, because the freedom actually secured\nby the Constitution is the freedom of self-government\u2014\nbecause the majority of Michigan citizens \u201cexercised their\nprivilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their demo-\ncratic power.\u201d Ante, at 15. It would be \u201cdemeaning to the\ndemocratic process,\u201d the plurality concludes, to disturb\nthat decision in any way. Ante, at 17.

I agree wholeheartedly that nothing\nvests the resolution of that debate exclusively in the courts\nor requires that we remove it from the reach of the elec-\ntorate.

While our Constitution does not\nguarantee minority groups victory in the political process,\nit does guarantee them meaningful and equal access to\nthat process. It guarantees that the majority may not win\nby stacking the political process against minority groups\npermanently, forcing the minority alone to surmount\nunique obstacles in pursuit of its goals\u2014here, educational\ndiversity that cannot reasonably be accomplished through\nrace-neutral measures. Today, by permitting a majority of\nthe voters in Michigan to do what our Constitution forbids,\nthe Court ends the debate over race-sensitive admissions\npolicies in Michigan in a manner that contravenes consti-\ntutional protections long recognized in our precedents.\n   Like the plurality, I have faith that our citizenry will\ncontinue to learn from this Nation\u2019s regrettable history;\nthat it will strive to move beyond those injustices towards\na future of equality. And I, too, believe in the importance\nof public discourse on matters of public policy. But I part\nways with the plurality when it suggests that judicial\nintervention in this case \u201cimpede[s]\u201d rather than \u201cad-\nvance[s]\u201d the democratic process and the ultimate hope of\nequality. Ante, at 16. I firmly believe that our role as\njudges includes policing the process of self-government\nand stepping in when necessary to secure the constitu-\ntional guarantee of equal protection. Because I would do\nso here, I respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n  For much of its history, our Nation has denied to many\nof its citizens the right to participate meaningfully and\nequally in its politics. This is a history we strive to put\nbehind us. But it is a history that still informs the society\nwe live in, and so it is one we must address with candor.\nBecause the political-process doctrine is best understood\nagainst the backdrop of this history, I will briefly trace its\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

But many\nStates ignored this promise. In addition to outright tactics\nof fraud, intimidation, and violence, there are countless\nexamples of States categorically denying to racial minori-\nties access to the political process. Consider Texas; there,\na 1923 statute prevented racial minorities from participat-\ning in primary elections. After this Court declared that\nstatute unconstitutional, Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536,\n540\u2013541 (1927), Texas responded by changing the rules.\nIt enacted a new statute that gave political parties them-\nselves the right to determine who could participate in\ntheir primaries. Predictably, the Democratic Party speci-\nfied that only white Democrats could participate in its\nprimaries. Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73, 81\u201382 (1932).\nThe Court invalidated that scheme, too. Id., at 89; see\nalso Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944); Terry v.\nAdams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953).\n   Some States were less direct. Oklahoma was one of\nmany that required all voters to pass a literacy test. But\nthe test did not apply equally to all voters. Under a\n\u201cgrandfather clause,\u201d voters were exempt if their grand-\nfathers had been voters or had served as soldiers before\n1866. This meant, of course, that black voters had to pass\nthe test, but many white voters did not. The Court held\nthe scheme unconstitutional. Guinn v. United States, 238\nU. S. 347 (1915). In response, Oklahoma changed the\nrules. It enacted a new statute under which all voters who\nwere qualified to vote in 1914 (under the unconstitutional\ngrandfather clause) remained qualified, and the remaining\nvoters had to apply for registration within a 12-day period.\nLane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, 270\u2013271 (1939). The Court\nstruck down that statute as well. Id., at 275.\n   Racial minorities were occasionally able to surmount the\nhurdles to their political participation. Indeed, in some\n8                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nStates, minority citizens were even able to win elective\noffice. But just as many States responded to the Fifteenth\nAmendment by subverting minorities\u2019 access to the polls,\nmany States responded to the prospect of elected minority\nofficials by undermining the ability of minorities to win\nand hold elective office. Some States blatantly removed\nblack officials from local offices. See, e.g., H. Rabinowitz,\nRace Relations in the Urban South, 1865\u20131890, pp. 267,\n269\u2013270 (1978) (describing events in Tennessee and Vir-\nginia). Others changed the processes by which local offi-\ncials were elected. See, e.g., Extension of the Voting\nRights Act, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Civil\nand Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the\nJudiciary, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, pp. 2016\u20132017\n(1981) (hereinafter 1981 Hearings) (statement of Professor\nJ. Morgan Kousser) (after a black judge refused to resign\nin Alabama, the legislature abolished the court on which\nhe served and replaced it with one whose judges were\nappointed by the Governor); Rabinowitz, supra, at 269\u2013\n270 (the North Carolina Legislature divested voters of\nthe right to elect justices of the peace and county commis-\nsioners, then arrogated to itself the authority to select\njustices of the peace and gave them the power to select\ncommissioners).\n   This Court did not stand idly by. In Alabama, for exam-\nple, the legislature responded to increased black voter\nregistration in the city of Tuskegee by amending the State\nConstitution to authorize legislative abolition of the county\nin which Tuskegee was located, Ala. Const. Amdt. 132\n(1957), repealed by Ala. Const. Amdt. 406 (1982), and by\nredrawing the city\u2019s boundaries to remove all the black\nvoters \u201cwhile not removing a single white voter,\u201d Gomil\u00ad\nlion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 341 (1960). The Court\nintervened, finding it \u201cinconceivable that guaranties em-\nbedded in the Constitution\u201d could be \u201cmanipulated out of\nexistence\u201d by being \u201ccloaked in the garb of [political] rea-\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Board of\nEducation, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), triggered a new era of\npolitical restructuring, this time in the context of educa-\ntion. In Virginia, the General Assembly transferred con-\ntrol of student assignment from local school districts to a\nState Pupil Placement Board. See B. Muse, Virginia\u2019s\nMassive Resistance 34, 74 (1961). And when the legisla-\nture learned that the Arlington County school board had\nprepared a desegregation plan, the General Assembly\n\u201cswiftly retaliated\u201d by stripping the county of its right to\nelect its school board by popular vote and instead making\nthe board an appointed body. Id., at 24; see also B. Smith,\nThey Closed Their Schools 142\u2013143 (1965).\n   Other States similarly disregarded this Court\u2019s mandate\nby changing their political process. See, e.g., Bush v.\nOrleans Parish School Bd., 187 F. Supp. 42, 44\u201345 (ED La.\n1960) (the Louisiana Legislature gave the Governor the\nauthority to supersede any school board\u2019s decision to\nintegrate); Extension of the Voting Rights Act, Hearings\non H. R. 4249 et al. before Subcommittee No. 5 of the\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess.,\n146\u2013149 (1969) (statement of Thomas E. Harris, Assoc.\nGen. Counsel, American Federation of Labor and Congress\nof Industrial Organizations) (the Mississippi Legislature\nremoved from the people the right to elect superintendents\nof education in 11 counties and instead made those posi-\ntions appointive).\n   The Court remained true to its command in Brown. In\nArkansas, for example, it enforced a desegregation order\nagainst the Little Rock school board. Cooper v. Aaron, 358\nU. S. 1, 5 (1958). On the very day the Court announced\nthat ruling, the Arkansas Legislature responded by chang-\ning the rules. It enacted a law permitting the Governor to\nclose any public school in the State, and stripping local\nschool districts of their decisionmaking authority so long\n10                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nas the Governor determined that local officials could not\nmaintain \u201c \u2018a general, suitable, and efficient educational\nsystem.\u2019 \u201d Aaron v. Cooper, 261 F. 2d 97, 99 (CA8 1958)\n(per curiam) (quoting Arkansas statute).           The then-\nGovernor immediately closed all of Little Rock\u2019s high\nschools. Id., at 99\u2013100; see also S. Breyer, Making Our\nDemocracy Work 49\u201367 (2010) (discussing the events in\nLittle Rock).\n   The States\u2019 political restructuring efforts in the 1960\u2019s\nand 1970\u2019s went beyond the context of education. Many\nStates tried to suppress the political voice of racial minori-\nties more generally by reconfiguring the manner in which\nthey filled vacancies in local offices, often transferring\nauthority from the electorate (where minority citizens had\na voice at the local level) to the States\u2019 executive branch\n(where minorities wielded little if any influence). See, e.g.,\n1981 Hearings, pt. 1, at 815 (report of J. Cox & A. Turner)\n(the Alabama Legislature changed all municipal judge-\nships from elective to appointive offices); id., at 1955\n(report of R. Hudlin & K. Brimah, Voter Educ. Project,\nInc.) (the Georgia Legislature eliminated some elective\noffices and made others appointive when it appeared that\na minority candidate would be victorious); id., at 501\n(statement of Frank R. Parker, Director, Lawyers\u2019 Comm.\nfor Civil Rights Under Law) (the Mississippi Legislature\nchanged the manner of filling vacancies for various public\noffices from election to appointment).\n                               II\n  It was in this historical context that the Court inter-\nvened in Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385 (1969), and\nWashington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457\n(1982). Together, Hunter and Seattle recognized a funda-\nmental strand of this Court\u2019s equal protection jurispru-\ndence: the political-process doctrine. To understand that\ndoctrine fully, it is necessary to set forth in detail precisely\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S., at 386 (internal quotation marks omitted). A major-\nity of the citizens of Akron disagreed with the ordinance\nand overturned it. But the majority did not stop there; it\nalso amended the city charter to prevent the City Council\nfrom implementing any future ordinance dealing with\nracial, religious, or ancestral discrimination in housing\nwithout the approval of the majority of the Akron elec-\ntorate. Ibid. That amendment changed the rules of the\npolitical process in Akron. The Court described the result\nof the change as follows:\n    \u201c[T]o enact an ordinance barring housing discrimina-\n    tion on the basis of race or religion, proponents had to\n    obtain the approval of the City Council and of a major-\n    ity of the voters citywide. To enact an ordinance pre-\n    venting housing discrimination on other grounds, or\n    to enact any other type of housing ordinance, propo-\n    nents needed the support of only the City Council.\u201d\n    Seattle, 458 U. S., at 468 (describing Hunter; empha-\n    sis deleted).\n  The Court invalidated the Akron charter amendment\nunder the Equal Protection Clause. It concluded that the\namendment unjustifiably \u201cplace[d] special burdens on\nracial minorities within the governmental process,\u201d thus\neffecting \u201ca real, substantial, and invidious denial of the\nequal protection of the laws.\u201d Hunter, 393 U. S., at 391,\n393. The Court characterized the amendment as \u201cno more\n12                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npermissible\u201d than denying racial minorities the right to\nvote on an equal basis with the majority. Id., at 391. For\na \u201cState may no more disadvantage any particular group\nby making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf\nthan it may dilute any person\u2019s vote or give any group a\nsmaller representation than another of comparable size.\u201d\nId., at 392\u2013393. The vehicle for the change\u2014a popular\nreferendum\u2014did not move the Court: \u201cThe sovereignty of\nthe people,\u201d it explained, \u201cis itself subject to . . . constitu-\ntional limitations.\u201d Id., at 392.\n   Justice Harlan, joined by Justice Stewart, wrote in his\nconcurrence that although a State can normally allocate\npolitical power according to any general principle, it bears\na \u201cfar heavier burden of justification\u201d when it reallocates\npolitical power based on race, because the selective reallo-\ncation necessarily makes it far more difficult for racial\nminorities to \u201cachieve legislation that is in their interest.\u201d\nId., at 395 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In Seattle, a case that mirrors the one before us, the\nCourt applied Hunter to invalidate a statute, enacted by a\nmajority of Washington State\u2019s citizens, that prohibited\nracially integrative busing in the wake of Brown. As early\nas 1963, Seattle\u2019s School District No. 1 began taking steps\nto cure the de facto racial segregation in its schools. 458\nU. S., at 460\u2013461. Among other measures, it enacted a\ndesegregation plan that made extensive use of busing and\nmandatory assignments. Id., at 461. The district was\nunder no obligation to adopt the plan; Brown charged\nschool boards with a duty to integrate schools that were\nsegregated because of de jure racial discrimination, but\nthere had been no finding that the de facto segregation in\nSeattle\u2019s schools was the product of de jure discrimination.\n458 U. S., at 472, n. 15. Several residents who opposed\nthe desegregation efforts formed a committee and sued to\nenjoin implementation of the plan. Id., at 461. When\nthese efforts failed, the committee sought to change the\n                   Cite as: 572 U.

It drafted a statewide initia-\ntive \u201cdesigned to terminate the use of mandatory busing\nfor purposes of racial integration.\u201d Id., at 462. A major-\nity of the State\u2019s citizens approved the initiative. Id., at\n463\u2013464.\n   The Court invalidated the initiative under the Equal\nProtection Clause. It began by observing that equal pro-\ntection of the laws \u201cguarantees racial minorities the right\nto full participation in the political life of the community.\u201d\nId., at 467. \u201cIt is beyond dispute,\u201d the Court explained,\n\u201cthat given racial or ethnic groups may not be denied the\nfranchise, or precluded from entering into the political\nprocess in a reliable and meaningful manner.\u201d Ibid. But\nthe Equal Protection Clause reaches further, the Court\nstated, reaffirming the principle espoused in Hunter\u2014that\nwhile \u201claws structuring political institutions or allocating\npolitical power according to neutral principles\u201d do not\nviolate the Constitution, \u201ca different analysis is required\nwhen the State allocates governmental power nonneutrally,\nby explicitly using the racial nature of a decision to de-\ntermine the decisionmaking process.\u201d 458 U. S., at 470.\nThat kind of state action, it observed, \u201cplaces special bur-\ndens on racial minorities within the governmental pro-\ncess,\u201d by making it \u201cmore difficult for certain racial and\nreligious minorities\u201d than for other members of the com-\nmunity \u201cto achieve legislation . . . in their interest.\u201d Ibid.\n   Rejecting the argument that the initiative had no racial\nfocus, the Court found that the desegregation of public\nschools, like the Akron housing ordinance, \u201cinure[d] pri-\nmarily to the benefit of the minority, and [was] designed\nfor that purpose.\u201d Id., at 472. Because minorities had\ngood reason to \u201cconsider busing for integration to be \u2018legis-\nlation that is in their interest,\u2019 \u201d the Court concluded that\nthe \u201cracial focus of [the initiative] . . . suffice[d] to trigger\napplication of the Hunter doctrine.\u201d Id., at 474 (quoting\nHunter, 393 U. S., at 395) (Harlan, J. concurring)).\n14                        SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court next concluded that \u201cthe practical effect of\n[the initiative was] to work a reallocation of power of the\nkind condemned in Hunter.\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S., at 474. It\nexplained: \u201cThose favoring the elimination of de facto\nschool segregation now must seek relief from the state\nlegislature, or from the statewide electorate. Yet authority\nover all other student assignment decisions, as well as\nover most other areas of educational policy, remains vested\nin the local school board.\u201d Ibid. Thus, the initiative re-\nquired those in favor of racial integration in public schools\nto \u201csurmount a considerably higher hurdle than persons\nseeking comparable legislative action\u201d in different con-\ntexts. Ibid.\n   The Court reaffirmed that the \u201c \u2018simple repeal or modifi-\ncation of desegregation or antidiscrimination laws, without\nmore, never has been viewed as embodying a presump-\ntively invalid racial classification.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 483 (quoting\nCrawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles, 458 U. S. 527,\n539 (1982)). But because the initiative burdened future\nattempts to integrate by lodging the decisionmaking au-\nthority at a \u201cnew and remote level of government,\u201d it was\nmore than a \u201cmere repeal\u201d; it was an unconstitutionally\ndiscriminatory change to the political process.3 Seattle,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In Crawford, the Court confronted an amendment to the California\n\nConstitution prohibiting state courts from mandating pupil assign-\nments unless a federal court would be required to do so under the\nEqual Protection Clause. We upheld the amendment as nothing more\nthan a repeal of existing legislation: The standard previously required\nby California went beyond what was federally required; the amendment\nmerely moved the standard back to the federal baseline. The Court\ndistinguished the amendment from the one in Seattle because it left the\nrules of the political game unchanged. Racial minorities in Crawford,\nunlike racial minorities in Seattle, could still appeal to their local school\ndistricts for relief.\n  The Crawford Court distinguished Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385\n(1969), by clarifying that the charter amendment in Hunter was \u201csome-\nthing more than a mere repeal\u201d because it altered the framework of the\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

S., at 483\u2013484.\n                              B\n   Hunter and Seattle vindicated a principle that is as\nelementary to our equal protection jurisprudence as it is\nessential: The majority may not suppress the minority\u2019s\nright to participate on equal terms in the political process.\nUnder this doctrine, governmental action deprives minor-\nity groups of equal protection when it (1) has a racial focus,\ntargeting a policy or program that \u201cinures primarily to the\nbenefit of the minority,\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S., at 472; and\n(2) alters the political process in a manner that uniquely\nburdens racial minorities\u2019 ability to achieve their goals\nthrough that process. A faithful application of the doc-\ntrine resoundingly resolves this case in respondents\u2019 favor.\n                              1\n   Section 26 has a \u201cracial focus.\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S., at\n474. That is clear from its text, which prohibits Michi-\ngan\u2019s public colleges and universities from \u201cgrant[ing]\npreferential treatment to any individual or group on the\nbasis of race.\u201d Mich. Const., Art. I, \u00a726. Like desegrega-\ntion of public schools, race-sensitive admissions policies\n\u201cinur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority,\u201d 458\nU.

And the Seattle Court drew the\nsame distinction when it held that the initiative \u201cwork[ed] something\nmore than the \u2018mere repeal\u2019 of a desegregation law by the political\nentity that created it.\u201d 458 U. S., at 483.\n  4 JUSTICE SCALIA accuses me of crafting my own version (or versions)\n\nof the racial-focus prong. See ante, at 8\u20139, n. 4 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). I do not. I simply apply the test announced in Seattle:\nwhether the policy in question \u201cinures primarily to the benefit of the\nminority.\u201d 458 U. S., at 472. JUSTICE SCALIA ignores this analysis, see\nPart II\u2013B\u20131, supra, and instead purports to identify three versions of\nthe test that he thinks my opinion advances. The first\u2014whether \u201c \u2018the\npolicy in question benefits only a racial minority, \u2019 \u201d ante, at 8, n. 4\n16                       SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Petitioner argues that race-sensitive admissions policies\ncannot \u201cinur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority,\u201d\nibid., as the Court has upheld such policies only insofar as\nthey further \u201cthe educational benefits that flow from a\ndiverse student body,\u201d Grutter, 539 U. S., at 343. But\nthere is no conflict between this Court\u2019s pronouncement in\nGrutter and the common-sense reality that race-sensitive\nadmissions policies benefit minorities.       Rather, race-\nsensitive admissions policies further a compelling state\ninterest in achieving a diverse student body precisely\nbecause they increase minority enrollment, which neces-\nsarily benefits minority groups. In other words, constitu-\ntionally permissible race-sensitive admissions policies can\nboth serve the compelling interest of obtaining the educa-\ntional benefits that flow from a diverse student body, and\ninure to the benefit of racial minorities. There is nothing\nmutually exclusive about the two. Cf. Seattle, 458 U. S., at\n472 (concluding that the desegregation plan had a racial\nfocus even though \u201cwhite as well as Negro children bene-\nfit from exposure to \u2018ethnic and racial diversity in the\nclassroom\u2019 \u201d).\n   It is worth emphasizing, moreover, that \u00a726 is relevant\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(quoting supra, at 5)\u2014misunderstands the doctrine and misquotes my\nopinion. The racial-focus prong has never required a policy to benefit\nonly a minority group. The sentence from which JUSTICE SCALIA\nappears to quote makes the altogether different point that the political-\nprocess doctrine is obviously not implicated in the first place by a\nrestructuring that burdens members of society equally. This is the\nsecond prong of the political-process doctrine. See supra, at 5 (explain-\ning that the political-process doctrine is implicated \u201c[w]hen the majority\nreconfigures the political process in a manner that burdens only a\nracial minority\u201d). The second version\u2014which asks whether a policy\n\u201cbenefits primarily a racial minority,\u201d ante, at 8, n. 4\u2014is the one\narticulated by the Seattle Court and, as I have explained, see supra, at\n15 and this page, it is easily met in this case.

While substantially less\ngrueling paths remain open to those advocating for any\nother admissions policies, a constitutional amendment is\nthe only avenue by which race-sensitive admissions poli-\ncies may be obtained. The effect of \u00a726 is that a white\ngraduate of a public Michigan university who wishes to\npass his historical privilege on to his children may freely\nlobby the board of that university in favor of an expanded\nlegacy admissions policy, whereas a black Michigander\nwho was denied the opportunity to attend that very uni-\nversity cannot lobby the board in favor of a policy that\nmight give his children a chance that he never had and\nthat they might never have absent that policy.\n   Such reordering of the political process contravenes\nHunter and Seattle.7 See Seattle, 458 U. S., at 467 (the\nEqual Protection Clause prohibits \u201c \u2018a political structure\nthat treats all individuals as equals,\u2019 yet more subtly\ndistorts governmental processes in such a way as to place\nspecial burdens on the ability of minority groups to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSCALIA overlooks the fact that minorities need not elect any new board\nmembers in order to effect change; they may instead seek to persuade\nexisting board members to adopt changes in their interests.\n   7 I do not take the position, as JUSTICE SCALIA asserts, that the pro-\n\ncess of amending the Michigan Constitution is not a part of Michigan\u2019s\nexisting political process. See ante, at 13\u201314 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). It clearly is. The problem with \u00a726 is not that \u201camending\nMichigan\u2019s Constitution is simply not a part of that State\u2019s \u2018existing\npolitical process.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 14. It is that \u00a726 reconfigured the political\nprocess in Michigan such that it is now more difficult for racial minori-\nties, and racial minorities alone, to achieve legislation in their interest.\nSection 26 elevated the issue of race-sensitive admissions policies,\nand not any other kinds of admissions policies, to a higher plane of\nthe existing political process in Michigan: that of a constitutional\namendment.\n22                       SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nachieve beneficial legislation\u201d (citation omitted)). Where,\nas here, the majority alters the political process to the\ndetriment of a racial minority, the governmental action is\nsubject to strict scrutiny. See id., at 485, n. 28. Michigan\ndoes not assert that \u00a726 satisfies a compelling state inter-\nest. That should settle the matter.\n                               C\n                               1\n   The plurality sees it differently. Disregarding the lan-\nguage used in Hunter, the plurality asks us to contort that\ncase into one that \u201crests on the unremarkable principle\nthat the State may not alter the procedures of government\nto target racial minorities.\u201d Ante, at 8. And the plurality\nrecasts Seattle \u201cas a case in which the state action in\nquestion . . . had the serious risk, if not purpose, of causing\nspecific injuries on account of race.\u201d Ante, at 8\u20139. Accord-\ning to the plurality, the Hunter and Seattle Courts were\nnot concerned with efforts to reconfigure the political\nprocess to the detriment of racial minorities; rather, those\ncases invalidated governmental actions merely because\nthey reflected an invidious purpose to discriminate. This\nis not a tenable reading of those cases.\n   The plurality identifies \u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d as the\n\u201cnecessary result\u201d of the restructuring in Hunter. Ante, at\n8. It is impossible to assess whether the housing amend-\nment in Hunter was motivated by discriminatory purpose,\nfor the opinion does not discuss the question of intent.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 It certainly is fair to assume that some voters may have supported\n\nthe Hunter amendment because of discriminatory animus. But others\nmay have been motivated by their strong beliefs in the freedom of\ncontract or the freedom to alienate property. Similarly, here, although\nsome Michiganders may have voted for \u00a726 out of racial animus, some\nmay have been acting on a personal belief, like that of some of my\ncolleagues today, that using race-sensitive admissions policies in higher\neducation is unwise. The presence (or absence) of invidious discrimina-\ntion has no place in the current analysis. That is the very purpose of\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

The Hunter Court was clear about why\nit invalidated the Akron charter amendment: It was im-\npermissible as a restructuring of the political process, not\nas an action motivated by discriminatory intent. See 393\nU. S., at 391 (striking down the Akron charter amendment\nbecause it \u201cplaces a special burden on racial minorities\nwithin the governmental process\u201d).\n   Similarly, the plurality disregards what Seattle actually\nsays and instead opines that \u201cthe political restriction in\nquestion was designed to be used, or was likely to be used,\nto encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.\u201d Ante,\nat 17. Here, the plurality derives its conclusion not from\nSeattle itself, but from evidence unearthed more than a\nquarter-century later in Parents Involved in Community\nSchools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701 (2007):\n\u201cAlthough there had been no judicial finding of de jure\nsegregation with respect to Seattle\u2019s school district, it\nappears as though school desegregation in the district in\nthe 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s may have been the partial result of\nschool board policies that \u2018permitted white students to\ntransfer out of black schools while restricting the transfer\nof black students into white schools.\u2019 \u201d9 Ante, at 9 (quoting\nParents Involved, 551 U. S., at 807\u2013808 (BREYER, J., dis-\nsenting) (emphasis added). It follows, according to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe political-process doctrine; it operates irrespective of discriminatory\nintent, for it protects a process-based right.\n  9 The plurality relies on JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s dissent in Parents Involved\n\nto conclude that \u201cone permissible reading of the record was that the\nschool board had maintained policies to perpetuate racial segregation\nin the schools.\u201d Ante, at 9\u201310. Remarkably, some Members of today\u2019s\nplurality criticized JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s reading of the record in Parents\nInvolved itself. See 551 U. S., at 736.\n24                   SCHUETTE v.

Not once did the\nCourt suggest the presence of de jure segregation in Seat-\ntle. Quite the opposite: The opinion explicitly suggested\nthe desegregation plan was adopted to remedy de facto\nrather than de jure segregation. See 458 U. S., at 472,\nn. 15 (referring to the \u201cabsen[ce]\u201d of \u201ca finding of prior de\njure segregation\u201d). The Court, moreover, assumed that no\n\u201cconstitutional violation\u201d through de jure segregation had\noccurred. Id., at 474. And it unmistakably rested its\ndecision on Hunter, holding Seattle\u2019s initiative invalid\nbecause it \u201cuse[d] the racial nature of an issue to define\nthe governmental decisionmaking structure, and thus\nimpose[d] substantial and unique burdens on racial minor-\nities.\u201d 458 U. S., at 470.\n   It is nothing short of baffling, then, for the plurality to\ninsist\u2014in the face of clear language in Hunter and Seattle\nsaying otherwise\u2014that those cases were about nothing\nmore than the intentional and invidious infliction of a\nracial injury. Ante, at 8 (describing the injury in Hunter\nas \u201ca demonstrated injury on the basis of race\u201d); ante, at\n8\u20139 (describing the injury in Seattle as an \u201cinjur[y] on\naccount of race\u201d). The plurality\u2019s attempt to rewrite\nHunter and Seattle so as to cast aside the political-process\ndoctrine sub silentio is impermissible as a matter of stare\ndecisis. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, we usually\nstand by our decisions, even if we disagree with them,\nbecause people rely on what we say, and they believe they\ncan take us at our word.\n   And what now of the political-process doctrine? After\nthe plurality\u2019s revision of Hunter and Seattle, it is unclear\nwhat is left. The plurality certainly does not tell us. On\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

See ante, at 5\u20137 (opinion concurring\nin judgment).\n                               2\n   JUSTICE BREYER concludes that Hunter and Seattle do\nnot apply. Section 26, he reasons, did not move the rele-\nvant decisionmaking authority from one political level to\nanother; rather, it removed that authority from \u201cunelected\nactors and placed it in the hands of the voters.\u201d Ante, at 5\n(opinion concurring in judgment). He bases this conclu-\nsion on the premise that Michigan\u2019s elected boards \u201cdele-\ngated admissions-related decisionmaking authority to\nunelected university faculty members and administra-\ntors.\u201d Ibid. But this premise is simply incorrect.\n   For one thing, it is undeniable that prior to \u00a726, board\ncandidates often pledged to end or carry on the use of race-\nsensitive admissions policies at Michigan\u2019s public univer-\nsities. See supra, at 18. Surely those were not empty\npromises. Indeed, the issue of race-sensitive admissions\npolicies often dominated board elections. See, e.g., George,\nDetroit Free Press, at 2B (observing that \u201c[t]he race for\nthe University of Michigan Board of Regents could deter-\nmine . . . the future of [the University\u2019s] affirmative action\npolicies\u201d); Kosseff, UM Policy May Hang On Election,\nCrain\u2019s Detroit Business, Sept. 18, 2000, p. 1 (noting that\nan upcoming election could determine whether the Uni-\nversity would continue to defend its affirmative action\npolicies); University of Michigan\u2019s Admissions Policy Still\nan Issue for Regents\u2019 Election, Black Issues in Higher\nEducation, Oct. 21, 2004, p. 17 (commenting that although\n\u201cthe Supreme Court struck down the University of Michi-\ngan\u2019s undergraduate admissions policy as too formulaic,\u201d\nthe issue \u201cremains an important [one] to several peo-\nple running\u201d in an upcoming election for the Board of\n26                   SCHUETTE v.

Its Board of\nGovernors has enacted university statutes that govern the\nday-to-day running of the institution. See Wayne State\nUniv. Stat., online at http://bog.wayne.edu/code. A num-\nber of those statutes establish general admissions proce-\ndures, see \u00a72.34.09 (establishing undergraduate admis-\nsions procedures); \u00a72.34.12 (establishing graduate\nadmissions procedures), and some set out more specific\ninstructions for university officials, see, e.g., \u00a72.34.09.030\n(\u201cAdmissions decisions will be based on a full evaluation of\neach student\u2019s academic record, and on empirical data\nreflecting the characteristics of students who have suc-\ncessfully graduated from [the university] within the four\nyears prior to the year in which the student applies\u201d);\n\u00a7\u00a72.34.12.080, 2.34.12.090 (setting the requisite grade\npoint average for graduate applicants).\n  The Board of Governors does give primary responsibility\nover day-to-day admissions matters to the university\u2019s\nPresident. \u00a72.34.09.080.

And\nwhile university officials and faculty members \u201cserv[e] an\nimportant advisory role in recommending educational\npolicy,\u201d id., at 14, the Board alone ultimately controls\neducational policy and decides whether to adopt (or reject)\nprogram-specific admissions recommendations. For ex-\nample, the Board has voted on recommendations \u201cto revise\nguidelines for establishment of honors curricula, including\nadmissions criteria\u201d; \u201cto modify the honor point criteria for\ngraduate admission\u201d; and \u201cto modify the maximum num-\nber of transfer credits that the university would allow in\ncertain cases where articulation agreements rendered\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

The Board also \u201cengages in\nrobust and regular review of administrative actions in-\nvolving admissions policy and related matters.\u201d Id., at 16.\n   Other public universities more clearly entrust admis-\nsions policy to university officials. The Board of Regents\nof the University of Michigan, for example, gives primary\nresponsibility for admissions to the Associate Vice Provost,\nExecutive Director of Undergraduate Admissions, and\nDirectors of Admissions. Bylaws \u00a78.01, online at http://\nwww.regents.umich.edu/bylaws. And the Board of Trus-\ntees of Michigan State University relies on the President\nto make recommendations regarding admissions policies.\nBylaws, Art. 8, online at http://www.trustees.msu.edu/\nbylaws. But the bylaws of the Board of Regents and the\nBoard of Trustees \u201cmake clear that all university opera-\ntions remain subject to their control.\u201d Brief for Respond-\nents Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of\nTrustees of Michigan State University et al. 13\u201314.\n   The boards retain ultimate authority to adopt or reject\nadmissions policies in at least three ways. First, they\nroutinely meet with university officials to review admis-\nsions policies, including race-sensitive admissions policies.\nFor example, shortly after this Court\u2019s decisions in Gratz\nv. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244 (2003), and Grutter, 539 U.

Brief for Respondents Re-\ngents of the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees\nof Michigan State University et al. 14.\n   The salient point is this: Although the elected and polit-\nically accountable boards may well entrust university\nofficials with certain day-to-day admissions responsibili-\nties, they often weigh in on admissions policies themselves\nand, at all times, they retain complete supervisory author-\nity over university officials and over all admissions\ndecisions.\n   There is no question, then, that the elected boards in\nMichigan had the power to eliminate or adopt race-\nsensitive admissions policies prior to \u00a726. There is also no\nquestion that \u00a726 worked an impermissible reordering of\nthe political process; it removed that power from the elected\nboards and placed it instead at a higher level of the\npolitical process in Michigan. See supra, at 17\u201322. This\ncase is no different from Hunter and Seattle in that re-\nspect. Just as in Hunter and Seattle, minorities in Michi-\ngan \u201cparticipated in the political process and won.\u201d Ante,\nat 5 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). And just as in\nHunter and Seattle, \u201cthe majority\u2019s subsequent reordering\nof the political process repealed the minority\u2019s successes\nand made it more difficult for the minority to succeed in\nthe future,\u201d thereby \u201cdiminish[ing] the minority\u2019s ability to\nparticipate meaningfully in the electoral process.\u201d Ibid.\nThere is therefore no need to consider \u201cextend[ing] the\nholding of Hunter and Seattle to reach situations in which\ndecisionmaking authority is moved from an administrative\nbody to a political one,\u201d ibid. Such a scenario is not be-\nfore us.\n                              III\n  The political-process doctrine not only resolves this case\nas a matter of stare decisis; it is correct as a matter of first\n30                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nprinciples.\n                                A\n   Under our Constitution, majority rule is not without\nlimit. Our system of government is predicated on an\nequilibrium between the notion that a majority of citizens\nmay determine governmental policy through legislation\nenacted by their elected representatives, and the overrid-\ning principle that there are nonetheless some things the\nConstitution forbids even a majority of citizens to do. The\npolitical-process doctrine, grounded in the Fourteenth\nAmendment, is a central check on majority rule.\n   The Fourteenth Amendment instructs that all who act\nfor the government may not \u201cdeny to any person . . . the\nequal protection of the laws.\u201d We often think of equal\nprotection as a guarantee that the government will apply\nthe law in an equal fashion\u2014that it will not intentionally\ndiscriminate against minority groups. But equal protec-\ntion of the laws means more than that; it also secures the\nright of all citizens to participate meaningfully and equally\nin the process through which laws are created.\n   Few rights are as fundamental as the right to partici-\npate meaningfully and equally in the process of govern-\nment. See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 370 (1886)\n(political rights are \u201cfundamental\u201d because they are \u201cpre-\nservative of all rights\u201d). That right is the bedrock of our\ndemocracy, recognized from its very inception. See J. Ely,\nDemocracy and Distrust 87 (1980) (the Constitution \u201cis\noverwhelmingly concerned, on the one hand, with proce-\ndural fairness in the resolution of individual disputes,\u201d\nand on the other, \u201cwith ensuring broad participation in the\nprocesses and distributions of government\u201d).\n   This should come as no surprise. The political process is\nthe channel of change. Id., at 103 (describing the im-\nportance of the judiciary in policing the \u201cchannels of politi-\ncal change\u201d). It is the means by which citizens may both\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)           31\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nobtain desirable legislation and repeal undesirable legisla-\ntion. Of course, we do not expect minority members of our\nsociety to obtain every single result they seek through the\npolitical process\u2014not, at least, when their views conflict\nwith those of the majority. The minority plainly does not\nhave a right to prevail over majority groups in any given\npolitical contest. But the minority does have a right to\nplay by the same rules as the majority. It is this right\nthat Hunter and Seattle so boldly vindicated.\n   This right was hardly novel at the time of Hunter and\nSeattle. For example, this Court focused on the vital\nimportance of safeguarding minority groups\u2019 access to the\npolitical process in United States v. Carolene Products Co.,\n304 U. S. 144 (1938), a case that predated Hunter by 30\nyears. In a now-famous footnote, the Court explained that\nwhile ordinary social and economic legislation carries a\npresumption of constitutionality, the same may not be\ntrue of legislation that offends fundamental rights or\ntargets minority groups.        Citing cases involving re-\nstrictions on the right to vote, restraints on the dissemina-\ntion of information, interferences with political organiza-\ntions, and prohibition of peaceable assembly, the Court\nrecognized that \u201clegislation which restricts those political\nprocesses which can ordinarily be expected to bring about\nrepeal of undesirable legislation\u201d could be worthy of \u201cmore\nexacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment than are most other types of\nlegislation.\u201d Id., at 152, n. 4; see also Ely, supra, at 76\n(explaining that \u201c[p]aragraph two [of Carolene Products\nfootnote 4] suggests that it is an appropriate function of\nthe Court to keep the machinery of democratic govern-\nment running as it should, to make sure the channels of\npolitical participation and communication are kept open\u201d).\nThe Court also noted that \u201cprejudice against discrete and\ninsular minorities may be a special condition, which tends\nseriously to curtail the operation of those political pro-\n32                      SCHUETTE v.

S., at 153,\nn. 4, see also Ely, supra, at 76 (explaining that\n\u201c[p]aragraph three [of Carolene Products footnote 4] sug-\ngests that the Court should also concern itself with what\nmajorities do to minorities, particularly mentioning laws\n\u2018directed at\u2019 religious, national and racial minorities and\nthose infected by prejudice against them\u201d).\n   The values identified in Carolene Products lie at the\nheart of the political-process doctrine. Indeed, Seattle\nexplicitly relied on Carolene Products. See 458 U. S., at\n486 (\u201c[W]hen the State\u2019s allocation of power places unusual\nburdens on the ability of racial groups to enact legisla-\ntion specifically designed to overcome the \u2018special condi-\ntion\u2019 of prejudice, the governmental action seriously\n\u2018curtail[s] the operation of those political processes ordi-\nnarily to be relied upon to protect minorities\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nCarolene Products, 304 U. S., at 153, n. 4)). These values\nare central tenets of our equal protection jurisprudence.\n   Our cases recognize at least three features of the right\nto meaningful participation in the political process. Two\nof them, thankfully, are uncontroversial. First, every\neligible citizen has a right to vote. See Shaw v. Reno, 509\nU. S. 630, 639 (1993). This, woefully, has not always been\nthe case. But it is a right no one would take issue with\ntoday. Second, the majority may not make it more diffi-\ncult for the minority to exercise the right to vote. This,\ntoo, is widely accepted. After all, the Court has invalidat-\ned grandfather clauses, good character requirements, poll\ntaxes, and gerrymandering provisions.11 The third fea-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Attempts by the majority to make it more difficult for the minority\n\nto exercise its right to vote are, sadly, not a thing of the past. See\nShelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 15\u201317)\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (describing recent examples of discriminatory\nchanges to state voting laws, including a 1995 dual voter registration\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)                   33\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nture, the one the plurality dismantles today, is that a\nmajority may not reconfigure the existing political process\nin a manner that creates a two-tiered system of political\nchange, subjecting laws designed to protect or benefit\ndiscrete and insular minorities to a more burdensome\npolitical process than all other laws. This is the political-\nprocess doctrine of Hunter and Seattle.\n   My colleagues would stop at the second. The plurality\nembraces the freedom of \u201cself-government\u201d without limits.\nSee ante, at 13. And JUSTICE SCALIA values a \u201cnear-\nlimitless\u201d notion of state sovereignty. See ante, at 13\n(opinion concurring in judgment). The wrong sought to be\ncorrected by the political-process doctrine, they say, is not\none that should concern us and is in any event beyond the\nreach of the Fourteenth Amendment. As they see it, the\nCourt\u2019s role in protecting the political process ends once\nwe have removed certain barriers to the minority\u2019s partic-\nipation in that process. Then, they say, we must sit back\nand let the majority rule without the key constitutional\nlimit recognized in Hunter and Seattle.\n   That view drains the Fourteenth Amendment of one of\nits core teachings. Contrary to today\u2019s decision, protecting\nthe right to meaningful participation in the political pro-\ncess must mean more than simply removing barriers to\nparticipation. It must mean vigilantly policing the politi-\ncal process to ensure that the majority does not use other\nmethods to prevent minority groups from partaking in\nthat process on equal footing. Why? For the same reason\nwe guard the right of every citizen to vote. If \u201c[e]fforts to\nreduce the impact of minority votes, in contrast to direct\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsystem in Mississippi to disfranchise black voters, a 2000 redistricting\nplan in Georgia to decrease black voting strength, and a 2003 proposal\nto change the voting mechanism for school board elections in South\nCarolina). Until this Court\u2019s decision last Term in Shelby County, the\npreclearance requirement of \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 blocked\nthose and many other discriminatory changes to voting procedures.\n34                        SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nattempts to block access to the ballot,\u201d were \u201c \u2018second-\ngeneration barriers\u2019 \u201d to minority voting, Shelby County v.\nHolder, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (GINSBURG, J., dissent-\ning) (slip op., at 5), efforts to reconfigure the political\nprocess in ways that uniquely disadvantage minority\ngroups who have already long been disadvantaged are\nthird-generation barriers. For as the Court recognized in\nSeattle, \u201cminorities are no less powerless with the vote\nthan without it when a racial criterion is used to assign\ngovernmental power in such a way as to exclude particular\nracial groups \u2018from effective participation in the political\nproces[s].\u2019 \u201d12 458 U. S., at 486.\n  To accept the first two features of the right to meaning-\nful participation in the political process, while renouncing\nthe third, paves the way for the majority to do what it has\ndone time and again throughout our Nation\u2019s history:\nafford the minority the opportunity to participate, yet\nmanipulate the ground rules so as to ensure the minority\u2019s\ndefeat. This is entirely at odds with our idea of equality\nunder the law.\n  To reiterate, none of this is to say that the political-\nprocess doctrine prohibits the exercise of democratic self-\ngovernment. Nothing prevents a majority of citizens from\npursuing or obtaining its preferred outcome in a political\ncontest.

See ante, at 16\u201317. They were free to elect\ngoverning boards that opposed race-sensitive admissions\npolicies or, through public discourse and dialogue, to lobby\nthe existing boards toward that end. They were also free\nto remove from the boards the authority to make any\ndecisions with respect to admissions policies, as opposed to\nonly decisions concerning race-sensitive admissions poli-\ncies. But what the majority could not do, consistent with\nthe Constitution, is change the ground rules of the politi-\ncal process in a manner that makes it more difficult for\nracial minorities alone to achieve their goals. In doing so,\nthe majority effectively rigs the contest to guarantee a\nparticular outcome. That is the very wrong the political-\nprocess doctrine seeks to remedy. The doctrine \u201chews to\nthe unremarkable notion that when two competitors are\nrunning a race, one may not require the other to run twice\nas far or to scale obstacles not present in the first runner\u2019s\ncourse.\u201d BAMN v.

In those cases,\nthe Court described the right to vote as \u201c \u2018the essence of a\ndemocratic society.\u2019 \u201d Shaw, 509 U. S., at 639. It rejected\nStates\u2019 use of ostensibly race-neutral measures to prevent\nminorities from exercising their political rights. See id., at\n639\u2013640. And it invalidated practices such as at-large\nelectoral systems that reduce or nullify a minority group\u2019s\nability to vote as a cohesive unit, when those practices\nwere adopted with a discriminatory purpose. Id., at 641.\nThese cases, like the political-process doctrine, all sought\nto preserve the political rights of the minority.\n36                      SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Two more recent cases involving discriminatory restruc-\nturings of the political process are also worthy of mention:\nRomer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620 (1996), and League of United\nLatin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399 (2006)\n(LULAC).\n   Romer involved a Colorado constitutional amendment\nthat removed from the local political process an issue\nprimarily affecting gay and lesbian citizens. The amend-\nment, enacted in response to a number of local ordinances\nprohibiting discrimination against gay citizens, repealed\nthese ordinances and effectively prohibited the adoption of\nsimilar ordinances in the future without another amend-\nment to the State Constitution. 517 U. S., at 623\u2013624.\nAlthough the Court did not apply the political-process\ndoctrine in Romer,13 the case resonates with the principles\nundergirding the political-process doctrine. The Court\nrejected an attempt by the majority to transfer decision-\nmaking authority from localities (where the targeted\nminority group could influence the process) to state gov-\nernment (where it had less ability to participate effec-\ntively). See id., at 632 (describing this type of political\nrestructuring as a \u201cdisability\u201d on the minority group).\nRather than being able to appeal to municipalities for\npolicy changes, the Court commented, the minority was\nforced to \u201cenlis[t] the citizenry of Colorado to amend the\nState Constitution,\u201d id., at 631\u2014just as in this case.\n   LULAC, a Voting Rights Act case, involved an enact-\nment by the Texas Legislature that redrew district lines\nfor a number of Texas seats in the House of Representa-\ntives. 548 U.

Against this backdrop,\nthe Court found that just as \u201cLatino voters were poised to\nelect their candidate of choice,\u201d id., at 438, the State\u2019s\nenactment \u201ctook away [their] opportunity because [they]\nwere about to exercise it,\u201d id., at 440.

And the events giving rise to\nLULAC are strikingly similar to those here. Just as redis-\ntricting prevented Latinos in Texas from attaining a bene-\nfit they had fought for and were poised to enjoy, \u00a726\nprevents racial minorities in Michigan from enjoying a\nlast-resort benefit that they, too, had fought for through\nthe existing political processes.\n                             IV\n   My colleagues claim that the political-process doctrine is\nunadministrable and contrary to our more recent equal\nprotection precedents.

For nothing the\nCourt has said in the last 32 years undermines the princi-\nples announced in those cases.\n                               1\n  JUSTICE SCALIA first argues that the political-process\ndoctrine \u201cmisreads the Equal Protection Clause to protect\n\u2018particular group[s],\u2019 \u201d running counter to a line of cases\nthat treat \u201c \u2018equal protection as a personal right.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n9 (opinion concurring in judgment) (quoting Adarand, 515\nU. S., at 230). Equal protection, he says, protects \u201c \u2018per\u00ad\nsons, not groups.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 10 (quoting Adarand, 515\nU. S., at 227). This criticism ignores the obvious: Discrim-\nination against an individual occurs because of that indi-\nvidual\u2019s membership in a particular group. Yes, equal\nprotection is a personal right, but there can be no equal\nprotection violation unless the injured individual is a\nmember of a protected group or a class of individuals. It is\nmembership in the group\u2014here the racial minority\u2014that\ngives rise to an equal protection violation.\n   Relatedly, JUSTICE SCALIA argues that the political-\nprocess doctrine is inconsistent with our precedents be-\ncause it protects only the minority from political restruc-\nturings. This aspect of the doctrine, he says, cannot be\ntolerated because our precedents have rejected \u201c \u2018a reading\nof the guarantee of equal protection under which the level\nof scrutiny varies according to the ability of different\n40                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ngroups to defend their interests in the representative\nprocess.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 10 (quoting Richmond v. J. A. Croson\nCo., 488 U. S., 469, 495 (1989) (plurality opinion)). Equal\nprotection, he continues, \u201c \u2018cannot mean one thing when\napplied to one individual and something else when applied\nto a person of another color.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 10 (quoting Bakke,\n438 U. S., at 289\u2013290) (opinion of Powell, J.).\n  JUSTICE SCALIA is troubled that the political-process\ndoctrine has not been applied to trigger strict scrutiny for\npolitical restructurings that burden the majority. But the\ndoctrine is inapplicable to the majority. The minority\ncannot achieve such restructurings against the majority,\nfor the majority is, well, the majority. As the Seattle Court\nexplained, \u201c \u2018[t]he majority needs no protection against\ndiscriminat[ory restructurings], and if it did, a referen-\ndum, [for instance], might be bothersome but no more\nthan that.\u2019 \u201d 458 U. S., at 468. Stated differently, the\ndoctrine protects only the minority because it implicates a\nproblem that affects only the minority. Nothing in my\nopinion suggests, as JUSTICE SCALIA says, that under the\npolitical-process doctrine, \u201cthe Constitution prohibits\ndiscrimination against minority groups, but not against\nmajority groups.\u201d Ante, at 10, n. 7. If the minority some-\nhow managed to effectuate a political restructuring that\nburdened only the majority, we could decide then whether\nto apply the political-process doctrine to safeguard the\npolitical right of the majority. But such a restructuring is\nnot before us, and I cannot fathom how it could be\nachieved.\n                             2\n   JUSTICE SCALIA next invokes state sovereignty, arguing\nthat \u201cwe have emphasized the near-limitless sovereignty\nof each State to design its governing structure as it sees\nfit.\u201d Ante, at 13 (opinion concurring in judgment). But\nstate sovereignty is not absolute; it is subject to constitu-\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)            41\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntional limits. The Court surely did not offend state sover-\neignty by barring States from changing their voting proce-\ndures to exclude racial minorities. So why does the\npolitical-process doctrine offend state sovereignty? The\ndoctrine takes nothing away from state sovereignty that\nthe Equal Protection Clause does not require. All it says\nis that a State may not reconfigure its existing political\nprocesses in a manner that establishes a distinct and more\nburdensome process for minority members of our society\nalone to obtain legislation in their interests.\n   More broadly, JUSTICE SCALIA is troubled that the\npolitical-process doctrine would create supposed \u201caffirma-\ntive-action safe havens\u201d in places where the ordinary\npolitical process has thus far produced race-sensitive\nadmissions policies. Ante, at 13\u201314. It would not. As\nexplained previously, the voters in Michigan who opposed\nrace-sensitive admissions policies had any number of\noptions available to them to challenge those policies. See\nsupra, at 34\u201335. And in States where decisions regarding\nrace-sensitive admissions policies are not subject to the\npolitical process in the first place, voters are entirely free\nto eliminate such policies via a constitutional amendment\nbecause that action would not reallocate power in the\nmanner condemned in Hunter and Seattle (and, of course,\npresent here). The Seattle Court recognized this careful\nbalance between state sovereignty and constitutional\nprotections:\n    \u201c[W]e do not undervalue the magnitude of the State\u2019s\n    interest in its system of education. Washington could\n    have reserved to state officials the right to make all\n    decisions in the areas of education and student as-\n    signment. It has chosen, however, to use a more elab-\n    orate system; having done so, the State is obligated to\n    operate that system within the confines of the Four-\n    teenth Amendment.\u201d 458 U. S., at 487.\n42                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nThe same is true of Michigan.\n                               3\n   Finally, JUSTICE SCALIA disagrees with \u201cthe proposition\nthat a facially neutral law may deny equal protection\nsolely because it has a disparate racial impact.\u201d Ante,\nat 15 (opinion concurring in judgment).            He would\nacknowledge, however, that an act that draws racial dis-\ntinctions or makes racial classifications triggers strict\nscrutiny regardless of whether discriminatory intent is\nshown. See Adarand, 515 U. S., at 213. That should\nsettle the matter: Section 26 draws a racial distinction. As\nthe Seattle Court explained, \u201cwhen the political process or\nthe decisionmaking mechanism used to address racially\nconscious legislation\u2014and only such legislation\u2014is sin-\ngled out for peculiar and disadvantageous treatment, the\ngovernmental action plainly rests on \u2018distinctions based on\nrace.\u2019 \u201d 458 U. S., at 485 (some internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also id., at 470 (noting that although a State\nmay \u201c \u2018allocate governmental power on the basis of any\ngeneral principle,\u2019 \u201d it may not use racial considerations \u201cto\ndefine the governmental decisionmaking structure\u201d).\n   But in JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s view, cases like Washington v.\nDavis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976), and Arlington Heights v.\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252\n(1977), call Seattle into question. It is odd to suggest that\nprior precedents call into question a later one. Seattle\n(decided in 1982) postdated both Washington v. Davis\n(1976) and Arlington Heights (1977). JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\nsuggestion that Seattle runs afoul of the principles estab-\nlished in Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights\nwould come as a surprise to Justice Blackmun, who joined\nthe majority opinions in all three cases. Indeed, the Seat\u00ad\ntle Court explicitly rejected the argument that Hunter had\nbeen effectively overruled by Washington v. Davis and\nArlington Heights:\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

While decisions such\n     as Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights consid-\n     ered classifications facially unrelated to race, the\n     charter amendment at issue in Hunter dealt in explic-\n     itly racial terms with legislation designed to benefit\n     minorities \u2018as minorities,\u2019 not legislation intended to\n     benefit some larger group of underprivileged citizens\n     among whom minorities were disproportionately rep-\n     resented.\u201d 458 U. S., at 485.\nAnd it concluded that both the Hunter amendment and\nthe Seattle initiative rested on distinctions based on race.\n458 U. S., at 485. So does \u00a726.14\n                              B\n  My colleagues also attack the first prong of the doctrine\nas \u201crais[ing] serious constitutional concerns,\u201d ante, at 11\n(plurality opinion), and being \u201cunadministrable,\u201d ante, at 7\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). JUSTICE SCALIA\nwonders whether judges are equipped to weigh in on what\nconstitutes a \u201cracial issue.\u201d See ante, at 8. The plurality,\ntoo, thinks courts would be \u201cwith no clear legal standards\nor accepted sources to guide judicial decision.\u201d Ante, at 12.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 The plurality raises another concern with respect to precedent. It\n\npoints to decisions by the California Supreme Court and the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upholding as constitu-\ntional Proposition 209, a California constitutional amendment identical\nin substance to \u00a726. Ante, at 14. The plurality notes that if we were to\naffirm the lower court\u2019s decision in this case, \u201cthose holdings would be\ninvalidated . . . .\u201d Ibid. I fail to see the significance. We routinely\nresolve conflicts between lower courts; the necessary result, of course, is\nthat decisions of courts on one side of the debate are invalidated or\ncalled into question. I am unaware of a single instance where that\n(inevitable) fact influenced the Court\u2019s decision one way or the other.\nHad the lower courts proceeded in opposite fashion\u2014had the California\nSupreme Court and Ninth Circuit invalidated Proposition 209 and the\nSixth Circuit upheld \u00a726\u2014would the plurality come out the other way?\n44                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nYet as JUSTICE SCALIA recognizes, Hunter and Seattle\nprovide a standard: Does the public policy at issue \u201cinur[e]\nprimarily to the benefit of the minority, and [was it] de-\nsigned for that purpose\u201d? Seattle, 458 U. S., at 472; see\nante, at 8. Surely this is the kind of factual inquiry that\njudges are capable of making. JUSTICE SCALIA, for in-\nstance, accepts the standard announced in Washington v.\nDavis, which requires judges to determine whether dis-\ncrimination is intentional or whether it merely has a\ndiscriminatory effect. Such an inquiry is at least as diffi-\ncult for judges as the one called for by Hunter and Seattle.\nIn any event, it is clear that the constitutional amendment\nin this case has a racial focus; it is facially race-based and,\nby operation of law, disadvantages only minorities. See\nsupra, at 15\u201316.\n   \u201cNo good can come\u201d from these inquiries, JUSTICE\nSCALIA responds, because they divide the Nation along\nracial lines and perpetuate racial stereotypes. Ante, at 9.\nThe plurality shares that view; it tells us that we must not\nassume all individuals of the same race think alike. See\nante, at 11\u201312. The same could have been said about\ndesegregation: Not all members of a racial minority in\nSeattle necessarily regarded the integration of public\nschools as good policy. Yet the Seattle Court had little\ndifficulty saying that school integration as a general mat-\nter \u201cinure[d] . . . to the benefit of \u201d the minority. 458 U. S.,\nat 472.\n   My colleagues are of the view that we should leave race\nout of the picture entirely and let the voters sort it out.\nSee ante, at 13 (plurality opinion) (\u201cRacial division would\nbe validated, not discouraged, were the Seattle formula-\ntion . . . to remain in force\u201d); ante, at 9 (SCALIA, J., concur-\nring in judgment) (\u201c \u2018[R]acial stereotyping [is] at odds with\nequal protection mandates\u2019 \u201d). We have seen this reason-\ning before. See Parents Involved, 551 U. S., at 748 (\u201cThe\nway to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

It is a sentiment out\nof touch with reality, one not required by our Constitution,\nand one that has properly been rejected as \u201cnot sufficient\u201d\nto resolve cases of this nature.

Race matters in part because of the long\nhistory of racial minorities\u2019 being denied access to the\npolitical process. See Part I, supra; see also South Carolina\nv. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 309 (1966) (describing\nracial discrimination in voting as \u201can insidious and perva-\nsive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of\nour country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of\nthe Constitution\u201d). And although we have made great\nstrides, \u201cvoting discrimination still exists; no one doubts\nthat.\u201d Shelby County, 570 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 2).\n   Race also matters because of persistent racial inequality\nin society\u2014inequality that cannot be ignored and that has\nproduced stark socioeconomic disparities. See Gratz, 539\nU. S., at 298\u2013300 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (cataloging\nthe many ways in which \u201cthe effects of centuries of law-\nsanctioned inequality remain painfully evident in our\ncommunities and schools,\u201d in areas like employment,\npoverty, access to health care, housing, consumer transac-\ntions, and education); Adarand, 515 U.

Race matters because\nof the slights, the snickers, the silent judgments that\nreinforce that most crippling of thoughts: \u201cI do not belong\nhere.\u201d\n  In my colleagues\u2019 view, examining the racial impact of\nlegislation only perpetuates racial discrimination. This\nrefusal to accept the stark reality that race matters is\nregrettable. The way to stop discrimination on the basis of\nrace is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race,\nand to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfor-\ntunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination. As\nmembers of the judiciary tasked with intervening to carry\nout the guarantee of equal protection, we ought not sit\nback and wish away, rather than confront, the racial\ninequality that exists in our society. It is this view that\nworks harm, by perpetuating the facile notion that what\nmakes race matter is acknowledging the simple truth that\nrace does matter.\n                               V\n  Although the only constitutional rights at stake in this\ncase are process-based rights, the substantive policy at\nissue is undeniably of some relevance to my colleagues.\nSee ante, at 18 (plurality opinion) (suggesting that race-\nsensitive admissions policies have the \u201cpotential to be-\ncome . . . the source of the very resentments and hostilities\nbased on race that this Nation seeks to put behind it\u201d).

Before the advent of race-sensitive admissions\npolicies, those institutions, like others around the country,\nwere essentially segregated. In 1868, two black students\nwere admitted to the University of Michigan, the first of\ntheir race. See Expert Report of James D. Anderson 4, in\nGratz v. Bollinger, No. 97\u201375231 (ED Mich.). In 1935,\nover six decades later, there were still only 35 black stu-\ndents at the University. Ibid. By 1954, this number had\nrisen to slightly below 200. Ibid. And by 1966, to around\n400, among a total student population of roughly 32,500\u2014\nbarely over 1 percent. Ibid. The numbers at the University\nof Michigan Law School are even more telling. During\nthe 1960\u2019s, the Law School produced 9 black graduates\namong a total of 3,041\u2014less than three-tenths of 1 per-\ncent. See App. in Grutter v. Bollinger, O. T. 2002, No. 02\u2013\n241, p. 204.\n   The housing and extracurricular policies at these insti-\ntutions also perpetuated open segregation. For instance,\nincoming students were permitted to opt out of rooming\nwith black students. Anderson, supra, at 7\u20138. And some\nfraternities and sororities excluded black students from\nmembership. Id., at 6\u20137.\n   In 1966, the Defense Department conducted an investi-\ngation into the University\u2019s compliance with Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act, and made 25 recommendations for in-\ncreasing opportunities for minority students. Id., at 9. In\n1970, a student group launched a number of protests,\nincluding a strike, demanding that the University increase\nits minority enrollment. Id., at 16\u201323. The University\u2019s\nBoard of Regents responded, adopting a goal of 10 percent\nblack admissions by the fall of 1973. Id., at 23.\n48                       SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   During the 1970\u2019s, the University continued to improve\nits admissions policies,15 encouraged by this Court\u2019s 1978\ndecision in Bakke. In that case, the Court told our Na-\ntion\u2019s colleges and universities that they could consider\nrace in admissions as part of a broader goal to create a\ndiverse student body, in which students of different back-\ngrounds would learn together, and thereby learn to live\ntogether. A little more than a decade ago, in Grutter, the\nCourt reaffirmed this understanding. In upholding the\nadmissions policy of the Law School, the Court laid to rest\nany doubt whether student body diversity is a compelling\ninterest that may justify the use of race.\n   Race-sensitive admissions policies are now a thing of the\npast in Michigan after \u00a726, even though\u2014as experts agree\nand as research shows\u2014those policies were making a\ndifference in achieving educational diversity. In Grutter,\nMichigan\u2019s Law School spoke candidly about the strides\nthe institution had taken successfully because of race-\nsensitive admissions. One expert retained by the Law\nSchool opined that a race-blind admissions system would\nhave a \u201cvery dramatic, negative effect on underrepresented\nminority admissions.\u201d Grutter, 539 U. S., at 320 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). He testified that the school\nhad admitted 35 percent of underrepresented minority\nstudents who had applied in 2000, as opposed to only 10\npercent who would have been admitted had race not been\nconsidered. Ibid. Underrepresented minority students\nwould thus have constituted 4 percent, as opposed to the\nactual 14.5 percent, of the class that entered in 2000.\nIbid.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 In 1973, the Law School graduated 41 black students (out of a class\n\nof 446) and the first Latino student in its history.

On the whole, during the 1970\u2019s, the\nLaw School graduated 262 black students, compared to 9 in the previ-\nous decade, along with 41 Latino students. Ibid.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

The Board of Regents of the University of\nMichigan and the Board of Trustees of Michigan State\nUniversity inform us that those institutions cannot\nachieve the benefits of a diverse student body without\nrace-sensitive admissions plans. See Brief for Respond-\nents Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of\nTrustees of Michigan State University et al. 18\u201325. Dur-\ning proceedings before the lower courts, several university\nofficials testified that \u00a726 would depress minority enroll-\nment at Michigan\u2019s public universities. The Director of\nUndergraduate Admissions at the University of Michigan\n\u201cexpressed doubts over the ability to maintain minority\nenrollment through the use of a proxy, like socioeconomic\nstatus.\u201d Supp. App. to Pet. for Cert. 285a. He explained\nthat university officials in States with laws similar to \u00a726\nhad not \u201c \u2018achieve[d] the same sort of racial and ethnic\ndiversity that they had prior to such measures . . . without\nconsidering race.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Similarly, the Law School\u2019s Dean\nof Admissions testified that she expected \u201ca decline in\nminority admissions because, in her view, it is impossible\n\u2018to get a critical mass of underrepresented minori-\nties . . . without considering race.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. And the Dean of\nWayne State University Law School stated that \u201calthough\nsome creative approaches might mitigate the effects of\n[\u00a726], he \u2018did not think that any one of these proposals or\nany combination of these proposals was reasonably likely\nto result in the admission of a class that had the same or\nsimilar or higher numbers of African Americans, Latinos\nand Native Americans as the prior policy.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n   Michigan tells a different story.

For example, between 2006 and\n2011, the proportion of black freshmen among those en-\nrolled at the University of Michigan declined from 7 per-\ncent to 5 percent, even though the proportion of black\ncollege-aged persons in Michigan increased from 16 to 19\npercent.

At the University of California, Los\nAngeles (UCLA), for example, admission rates for un-\nderrepresented minorities plummeted from 52.4 percent in\n1995 (before California\u2019s ban took effect) to 24 percent\nin 1998. Id., at 12. As a result, the percentage of un-\nderrepresented minorities fell by more than half: from\n30.1 percent of the entering class in 1995 to 14.3 percent\nin 1998. Ibid. The admissions rate for underrepresented\nminorities at UCLA reached a new low of 13.6 percent in\n2012. See Brief for California Social Science Researchers\nand Admissions Experts as Amici Curiae 28.\n   The elimination of race-sensitive admissions policies in\nCalifornia has been especially harmful to black students.\nIn 2006, for example, there were fewer than 100 black\nstudents in UCLA\u2019s incoming class of roughly 5,000, the\nlowest number since at least 1973. See id., at 24.\n   The University of California also saw declines in minor-\nity representation at its graduate programs and profes-\nsional schools. In 2005, underrepresented minorities\nmade up 17 percent of the university\u2019s new medical stu-\ndents, which is actually a lower rate than the 17.4 percent\nreported in 1975, three years before Bakke. President and\nChancellors Brief 13. The numbers at the law schools are\neven more alarming.

See ante, at 2 (ROBERTS, C. J., concur-\nring) (suggesting that race-sensitive admissions policies\nmight \u201cdo more harm than good\u201d); ante, at 9, n. 6 (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in judgment); Grutter, 539 U. S., at 371\u2013373\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);\nid., at 347\u2013348 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part). That view is at odds with our recognition in\nGrutter, and more recently in Fisher v. University of Texas\nat Austin, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), that race-sensitive admis-\nsions policies are necessary to achieve a diverse student\nbody when race-neutral alternatives have failed. More\nfundamentally, it ignores the importance of diversity in\ninstitutions of higher education and reveals how little my\ncolleagues understand about the reality of race in America.\n   This Court has recognized that diversity in education is\nparamount. With good reason. Diversity ensures that the\nnext generation moves beyond the stereotypes, the as-\nsumptions, and the superficial perceptions that students\ncoming from less-heterogeneous communities may harbor,\nconsciously or not, about people who do not look like them.\nRecognizing the need for diversity acknowledges that,\n\u201c[j]ust as growing up in a particular region or having\nparticular professional experiences is likely to affect an\nindividual\u2019s views, so too is one\u2019s own, unique experience\nof being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in\nwhich race unfortunately still matters.\u201d Grutter, 539\nU. S., at 333. And it acknowledges that \u201cto cultivate a set\nof leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is\nnecessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

They must be free to immerse their\nstudents in a multiracial environment that fosters fre-\nquent and meaningful interactions with students of other\nraces, and thereby pushes such students to transcend any\nassumptions they may hold on the basis of skin color.\nWithout race-sensitive admissions policies, this might well\nbe impossible. The statistics I have described make that\nfact glaringly obvious. We should not turn a blind eye to\nsomething we cannot help but see.\n  To be clear, I do not mean to suggest that the virtues of\nadopting race-sensitive admissions policies should inform\nthe legal question before the Court today regarding the\nconstitutionality of \u00a726. But I cannot ignore the unfortu-\nnate outcome of today\u2019s decision: Short of amending the\nState Constitution, a Herculean task, racial minorities in\nMichigan are deprived of even an opportunity to convince\nMichigan\u2019s public colleges and universities to consider race\nin their admissions plans when other attempts to achieve\nracial diversity have proved unworkable, and those insti-\ntutions are unnecessarily hobbled in their pursuit of a\ndiverse student body.\n                        *     *    *\n  The Constitution does not protect racial minorities from\npolitical defeat. But neither does it give the majority free\nrein to erect selective barriers against racial minorities.\nThe political-process doctrine polices the channels of\nchange to ensure that the majority, when it wins, does so\nwithout rigging the rules of the game to ensure its success.\nToday, the Court discards that doctrine without good\nreason.\n  In doing so, it permits the decision of a majority of the\nvoters in Michigan to strip Michigan\u2019s elected university\n58                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nboards of their authority to make decisions with respect to\nconstitutionally permissible race-sensitive admissions\npolicies, while preserving the boards\u2019 plenary authority to\nmake all other educational decisions. \u201cIn a most direct\nsense, this implicates the judiciary\u2019s special role in safe-\nguarding the interests of those groups that are relegated\nto such a position of political powerlessness as to com-\nmand extraordinary protection from the majoritarian\npolitical process.\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S., at 486 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Court abdicates that role,\npermitting the majority to use its numerical advantage to\nchange the rules mid-contest and forever stack the deck\nagainst racial minorities in Michigan. The result is that\nMichigan\u2019s public colleges and universities are less\nequipped to do their part in ensuring that students of all\nraces are \u201cbetter prepare[d] . . . for an increasingly diverse\nworkforce and society . . .\u201d Grutter, 539 U. S., at 330\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Today\u2019s decision eviscerates an important strand of our\nequal protection jurisprudence. For members of historically\nmarginalized groups, which rely on the federal courts to\nprotect their constitutional rights, the decision can hardly\nbolster hope for a vision of democracy that preserves for\nall the right to participate meaningfully and equally in\nself-government.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n",

Argued October 15, 2013\u2014Decided April 22, 2014\nAfter this Court decided that the University of Michigan\u2019s undergradu-\n  ate admissions plan\u2019s use of race-based preferences violated the\n  Equal Protection Clause, Gratz v.

In consolidated challenges, the District\n  Court granted summary judgment to Michigan, thus upholding Pro-\n  posal 2, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that the proposal\n  violated the principles of Washington v.

Rather, the\n    question concerns whether, and in what manner, voters in the States\n    may choose to prohibit the consideration of such racial preferences.\n    Where States have prohibited race-conscious admissions policies,\n    universities have responded by experimenting \u201cwith a wide variety of\n    alternative approaches.\u201d Grutter, supra, at 342. The decision by\n    Michigan voters reflects the ongoing national dialogue about such\n    practices. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Sixth Circuit\u2019s determination that Seattle controlled here\n    extends Seattle\u2019s holding in a case presenting quite different issues to\n    reach a mistaken conclusion. Pp. 5\u201318.\n         (1) It is necessary to consider first the relevant cases preceding\n    Seattle and the background against which Seattle arose. Both Reit\u00ad\n    man v. Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369, and Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385,\n    involved demonstrated injuries on the basis of race that, by reasons\n    of state encouragement or participation, became more aggravated. In\n    Mulkey, a voter-enacted amendment to the California Constitution\n    prohibiting state legislative interference with an owner\u2019s prerogative\n    to decline to sell or rent residential property on any basis barred the\n    challenging parties, on account of race, from invoking the protection\n    of California\u2019s statutes, thus preventing them from leasing residen-\n    tial property. In Hunter, voters overturned an Akron ordinance that\n    was enacted to address widespread racial discrimination in housing\n    sales and rentals had forced many to live in \u201c \u2018unhealthful, unsafe,\n    unsanitary and overcrowded\u2019 \u201d segregated housing, 393 U. S., at 391.\n    In Seattle, after the school board adopted a mandatory busing pro-\n    gram to alleviate racial isolation of minority students in local schools,\n    voters passed a state initiative that barred busing to desegregate.\n    This Court found that the state initiative had the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of\n    removing \u201cthe authority to address a racial problem . . . from the ex-\n    isting decisionmaking body, in such a way as to burden minority in-\n    terests\u201d of busing advocates who must now \u201cseek relief from the state\n    legislature, or from the statewide electorate.\u201d 458 U. S., at 474.\n    Pp. 5\u20138.\n         (2) Seattle is best understood as a case in which the state action\n    had the serious risk, if not purpose, of causing specific injuries on ac-\n    count of race as had been the case in Mulkey and Hunter. While\n    there had been no judicial finding of de jure segregation with respect\n    to Seattle\u2019s school district, a finding that would be required today, see\n    Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,\n    551 U. S. 701, 720\u2013721, Seattle must be understood as Seattle under-\n    stood itself, as a case in which neither the State nor the United\n    States \u201cchallenge[d] the propriety of race-conscious student assign-\n    ments for the purpose of achieving integration, even absent a finding\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

S. at 472, n. 15.\n   Seattle\u2019s broad language, however, went well beyond the analysis\nneeded to resolve the case. Seizing upon the statement in Justice\nHarlan\u2019s concurrence in Hunter that the procedural change in that\ncase had \u201cthe clear purpose of making it more difficult for certain ra-\ncial and religious minorities to achieve legislation that is in their in-\nterest,\u201d 385 U. S., at 395, the Seattle Court established a new and far-\nreaching rationale: Where a government policy \u201cinures primarily to\nthe benefit of the minority\u201d and \u201cminorities . . . consider\u201d the policy to\nbe \u201c \u2018in their interest,\u2019 \u201d then any state action that \u201cplace[s] effective\ndecisionmaking authority over\u201d that policy \u201cat a different level of\ngovernment\u201d is subject to strict scrutiny. 458 U. S., at 472, 474.\nPp. 8\u201311.\n      (3) To the extent Seattle is read to require the Court to determine\nand declare which political policies serve the \u201cinterest\u201d of a group de-\nfined in racial terms, that rationale was unnecessary to the decision\nin Seattle; it has no support in precedent; and it raises serious equal\nprotection concerns. In cautioning against \u201cimpermissible racial ste-\nreotypes,\u201d this Court has rejected the assumption that all individuals\nof the same race think alike, see Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 647,\nbut that proposition would be a necessary beginning point were the\nSeattle formulation to control. And if it were deemed necessary to\nprobe how some races define their own interest in political matters,\nstill another beginning point would be to define individuals according\nto race. Such a venture would be undertaken with no clear legal\nstandards or accepted sources to guide judicial decision. It would al-\nso result in, or impose a high risk of, inquiries and categories de-\npendent upon demeaning stereotypes, classifications of questionable\nconstitutionality on their own terms. Assuming these steps could be\ntaken, the court would next be required to determine the policy\nrealms in which groups defined by race had a political interest. That\nundertaking, again without guidance from accepted legal standards,\nwould risk the creation of incentives for those who support or oppose\ncertain policies to cast the debate in terms of racial advantage or dis-\nadvantage. Adoption of the Seattle formulation could affect any\nnumber of laws or decisions, involving, e.g., tax policy or housing sub-\nsidies. And racial division would be validated, not discouraged.\n   It can be argued that objections to the larger consequences of the\nSeattle formulation need not be confronted here, for race was an un-\ndoubted subject of the ballot issue. But other problems raised by Se\u00ad\nattle, such as racial definitions, still apply. And the principal flaw in\nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision remains: Here there was no infliction of a\nspecific injury of the kind at issue in Mulkey and Hunter and in the\nhistory of the Seattle schools, and there is no precedent for extending\n4                          SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    these cases to restrict the right of Michigan voters to determine that\n    race-based preferences granted by state entities should be ended.\n    The Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment also calls into question other States\u2019\n    long-settled rulings on policies similar to Michigan\u2019s.\n       Unlike the injuries in Mulkey, Hunter, and Seattle, the question\n    here is not how to address or prevent injury caused on account of race\n    but whether voters may determine whether a policy of race-based\n    preferences should be continued. By approving Proposal 2 and there-\n    by adding \u00a726 to their State Constitution, Michigan voters exercised\n    their privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic\n    power, bypassing public officials they deemed not responsive to their\n    concerns about a policy of granting race-based preferences. The\n    mandate for segregated schools, Brown v. Board of Education, 347\n    U. S. 483, and scores of other examples teach that individual liberty\n    has constitutional protection. But this Nation\u2019s constitutional system\n    also embraces the right of citizens to speak and debate and learn and\n    then, as a matter of political will, to act through a lawful electoral\n    process, as Michigan voters have done here. These precepts are not\n    inconsistent with the well-established principle that when hurt or in-\n    jury is inflicted on racial minorities by the encouragement or com-\n    mand of laws or other state action, the Constitution requires redress\n    by the courts. Such circumstances were present in Mulkey, Hunter,\n    and Seattle, but they are not present here. Pp. 11\u201318.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, agreed that \u00a726 rightly\n    stands, though not because it passes muster under the political-\n    process doctrine. It likely does not, but the cases establishing that\n    doctrine should be overruled. They are patently atextual, unadmin-\n    istrable, and contrary to this Court\u2019s traditional equal protection ju-\n    risprudence. The question here, as in every case in which neutral\n    state action is said to deny equal protection on account of race, is\n    whether the challenged action reflects a racially discriminatory pur-\n    pose. It plainly does not. Pp. 1\u201318.\n       (a) The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held \u00a726 unconstitu-\n    tional under the so-called political-process doctrine, derived from\n    Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, and Hunter v.\n    Erickson, 393 U. S. 385. In those cases, one level of government ex-\n    ercised borrowed authority over an apparently \u201cracial issue\u201d until a\n    higher level of government called the loan. This Court deemed each\n    revocation an equal-protection violation, without regard to whether\n    there was evidence of an invidious purpose to discriminate. The re-\n    lentless, radical logic of Hunter and Seattle would point to a similar\n    conclusion here, as in so many other cases. Pp. 3\u20137.\n       (b) The problems with the political-process doctrine begin with its\n    triggering prong, which assigns to a court the task of determining\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

More fundamentally, the analysis\nmisreads the Equal Protection Clause to protect particular groups, a\nconstruction that has been repudiated in a \u201clong line of cases under-\nstanding equal protection as a personal right.\u201d Adarand Construc\u00ad\ntors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 224, 230. Pp. 7\u201312.\n   (c) The second part of the Hunter-Seattle analysis directs a court to\ndetermine whether the challenged act \u201cplace[s] effective decisionmak-\ning authority over [the] racial issue at a different level of govern-\nment,\u201d Seattle, supra, at 474; but, in another line of cases, the Court\nhas emphasized the near-limitless sovereignty of each State to design\nits governing structure as it sees fit, see, e.g., Holt Civic Club v. Tus\u00ad\ncaloosa, 439 U. S. 60, 71. Taken to the limits of its logic, Hunter-\nSeattle is the gaping exception that nearly swallows the rule of struc-\ntural state sovereignty, which would seem to permit a State to give\ncertain powers to cities, later assign the same powers to counties, and\neven reclaim them for itself. Pp. 12\u201315.\n   (d) Hunter and Seattle also endorse a version of the proposition\nthat a facially neutral law may deny equal protection solely because\nit has a disparate racial impact. That equal-protection theory has\nbeen squarely and soundly rejected by an \u201cunwavering line of cases\u201d\nholding \u201cthat a violation of the Equal Protection Clause requires\nstate action motivated by discriminatory intent,\u201d Hernandez v. New\nYork, 500 U. S. 352, 372\u2013373 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment),\nand that \u201cofficial action will not be held unconstitutional solely be-\ncause it results in a racially disproportionate impact,\u201d Arlington\nHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252,\n264\u2013265. Respondents cannot prove that the action here reflects a\nracially discriminatory purpose, for any law expressly requiring state\nactors to afford all persons equal protection of the laws does not\u2014\ncannot\u2014deny \u201cto any person . . . equal protection of the laws,\u201d U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 14, \u00a71. Pp. 15\u201317.\n   JUSTICE BREYER agreed that the amendment is consistent with the\nEqual Protection Clause, but for different reasons. First, this case\naddresses the amendment only as it applies to, and forbids, race-\nconscious admissions programs that consider race solely in order to\nobtain the educational benefits of a diverse student body. Second, the\n6                          SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Constitution permits, but does not require, the use of the kind of\n    race-conscious programs now barred by the Michigan Constitution.\n    It foresees the ballot box, not the courts, as the normal instrument\n    for resolving debates about the merits of these programs. Third,\n    Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385, and Washington v. Seattle School\n    Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, which reflect the important principle that\n    an individual\u2019s ability to participate meaningfully in the political pro-\n    cess should be independent of his race, do not apply here. Those cas-\n    es involved a restructuring of the political process that changed the\n    political level at which policies were enacted, while this case involves\n    an amendment that took decisionmaking authority away from une-\n    lected actors and placed it in the hands of the voters. Hence, this\n    case does not involve a diminution of the minority\u2019s ability to partici-\n    pate in the political process. Extending the holding of Hunter and\n    Seattle to situations where decisionmaking authority is moved from\n    an administrative body to a political one would also create significant\n    difficulties, given the nature of the administrative process. Further-\n    more, the principle underlying Hunter and Seattle runs up against a\n    competing principle favoring decisionmaking through the democratic\n    process.

The\nundergraduate admissions plan was addressed in Gratz v.\nBollinger, 539 U. S. 244. The law school admission plan\nwas addressed in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306. Each\nadmissions process permitted the explicit consideration of\nan applicant\u2019s race. In Gratz, the Court invalidated the\nundergraduate plan as a violation of the Equal Protection\nClause. 539 U. S., at 270. In Grutter, the Court found no\n2                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nconstitutional flaw in the law school admission plan\u2019s\nmore limited use of race-based preferences. 539 U. S., at\n343.\n   In response to the Court\u2019s decision in Gratz, the univer-\nsity revised its undergraduate admissions process, but the\nrevision still allowed limited use of race-based preferences.\nAfter a statewide debate on the question of racial prefer-\nences in the context of governmental decisionmaking, the\nvoters, in 2006, adopted an amendment to the State Con-\nstitution prohibiting state and other governmental entities\nin Michigan from granting certain preferences, including\nrace-based preferences, in a wide range of actions and\ndecisions. Under the terms of the amendment, race-based\npreferences cannot be part of the admissions process for\nstate universities. That particular prohibition is central to\nthe instant case.\n   The ballot proposal was called Proposal 2 and, after it\npassed by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent, the result-\ning enactment became Article I, \u00a726, of the Michigan\nConstitution. As noted, the amendment is in broad terms.\nSection 26 states, in relevant part, as follows:\n       \u201c(1) The University of Michigan, Michigan State\n    University, Wayne State University, and any other\n    public college or university, community college, or\n    school district shall not discriminate against, or grant\n    preferential treatment to, any individual or group on\n    the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national\n    origin in the operation of public employment, public\n    education, or public contracting.\n       \u201c(2) The state shall not discriminate against, or\n    grant preferential treatment to, any individual or\n    group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or na-\n    tional origin in the operation of public employment,\n    public education, or public contracting.\n       \u201c(3) For the purposes of this section \u2018state\u2019 includes,\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Among the\nplaintiffs in the suits were the Coalition to Defend Affirm-\native Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight\nfor Equality By Any Means Necessary (BAMN); students;\nfaculty; and prospective applicants to Michigan public\nuniversities.     The named defendants included then-\nGovernor Jennifer Granholm, the Board of Regents of the\nUniversity of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan\nState University, and the Board of Governors of Wayne\nState University. The Michigan Attorney General was\ngranted leave to intervene as a defendant. The United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan\nconsolidated the cases.\n   In 2008, the District Court granted summary judgment\nto Michigan, thus upholding Proposal 2. BAMN v. Regents\nof Univ. of Mich., 539 F. Supp. 2d 924. The District Court\ndenied a motion to reconsider the grant of summary judg-\nment. 592 F. Supp. 2d 948. A panel of the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the grant\nof summary judgment. 652 F. 3d 607 (2011). Judge Gib-\nbons dissented from that holding. Id., at 633\u2013646. The\npanel majority held that Proposal 2 had violated the prin-\nciples elaborated by this Court in Washington v. Seattle\nSchool Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457 (1982), and in the cases\nthat Seattle relied upon.\n   The Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, agreed with the\npanel decision. 701 F. 3d 466 (CA6 2012). The majority\nopinion determined that Seattle \u201cmirrors the [case] before\nus.\u201d Id., at 475. Seven judges dissented in a number of\nopinions. The Court granted certiorari. 568 U. S. ___\n4                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n(2013).\n   Before the Court addresses the question presented, it is\nimportant to note what this case is not about. It is not\nabout the constitutionality, or the merits, of race-conscious\nadmissions policies in higher education. The considera-\ntion of race in admissions presents complex questions, in\npart addressed last Term in Fisher v. University of Texas\nat Austin, 570 U. S. \u2013\u2013\u2013 (2013). In Fisher, the Court did\nnot disturb the principle that the consideration of race in\nadmissions is permissible, provided that certain conditions\nare met. In this case, as in Fisher, that principle is not\nchallenged. The question here concerns not the permissi-\nbility of race-conscious admissions policies under the\nConstitution but whether, and in what manner, voters in\nthe States may choose to prohibit the consideration of\nracial preferences in governmental decisions, in particular\nwith respect to school admissions.\n   This Court has noted that some States have decided to\nprohibit race-conscious admissions policies. In Grutter,\nthe Court noted: \u201cUniversities in California, Florida, and\nWashington State, where racial preferences in admissions\nare prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in\nexperimenting with a wide variety of alternative ap-\nproaches. Universities in other States can and should\ndraw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral\nalternatives as they develop.\u201d 539 U. S., at 342 (citing\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 581 (1995)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he States may perform\ntheir role as laboratories for experimentation to devise\nvarious solutions where the best solution is far from\nclear\u201d)). In this way, Grutter acknowledged the signifi-\ncance of a dialogue regarding this contested and complex\npolicy question among and within States. There was\nrecognition that our federal structure \u201cpermits \u2018 innovation\nand experimentation\u2019 \u201d and \u201cenables greater citizen \u2018 in-\nvolvement in democratic processes.\u2019 \u201d Bond v.

S. \u2013\u2013\u2013, \u2013\u2013\u2013 (2011) (slip op., at 9) (quoting\nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458 (1991)). While this\ncase arises in Michigan, the decision by the State\u2019s voters\nreflects in part the national dialogue regarding the wis-\ndom and practicality of race-conscious admissions policies\nin higher education. See, e.g., Coalition for Economic\nEquity v. Wilson, 122 F. 3d 692 (CA9 1997).\n   In Michigan, the State Constitution invests independent\nboards of trustees with plenary authority over public\nuniversities, including admissions policies. Mich. Const.,\nArt. VIII, \u00a75; see also Federated Publications, Inc. v. Board\nof Trustees of Mich. State Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2114300\"><a href=\"/mich/bQvs/federated-publications-inc-v-bd-of-trustees-of-mic/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86\u201387, 594\nN. W. 2d 491, 497 (1999). Although the members of the\nboards are elected, some evidence in the record suggests\nthey delegated authority over admissions policy to the\nfaculty. But whether the boards or the faculty set the\nspecific policy, Michigan\u2019s public universities did consider\nrace as a factor in admissions decisions before 2006.\n   In holding \u00a726 invalid in the context of student admis-\nsions at state universities, the Court of Appeals relied in\nprimary part on Seattle, supra, which it deemed to control\nthe case. But that determination extends Seattle\u2019s holding\nin a case presenting quite different issues to reach a con-\nclusion that is mistaken here. Before explaining this\nfurther, it is necessary to consider the relevant cases that\npreceded Seattle and the background against which Seat-\ntle itself arose.\n   Though it has not been prominent in the arguments of\nthe parties, this Court\u2019s decision in Reitman v. Mulkey,\n387 U. S. 369 (1967), is a proper beginning point for dis-\ncussing the controlling decisions.       In Mulkey, voters\namended the California Constitution to prohibit any state\nlegislative interference with an owner\u2019s prerogative to\ndecline to sell or rent residential property on any basis.\nTwo different cases gave rise to Mulkey. In one a couple\ncould not rent an apartment, and in the other a couple\n6                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nwere evicted from their apartment. Those adverse actions\nwere on account of race. In both cases the complaining\nparties were barred, on account of race, from invoking the\nprotection of California\u2019s statutes; and, as a result, they\nwere unable to lease residential property. This Court\nconcluded that the state constitutional provision was a\ndenial of equal protection. The Court agreed with the\nCalifornia Supreme Court that the amendment operated\nto insinuate the State into the decision to discriminate by\nencouraging that practice. The Court noted the \u201cimmedi-\nate design and intent\u201d of the amendment was to \u201cestab-\nlis[h] a purported constitutional right to privately discrim-\ninate.\u201d Id., at 374 (internal quotation marks omitted and\nemphasis deleted). The Court agreed that the amendment\n\u201cexpressly authorized and constitutionalized the private\nright to discriminate.\u201d Id., at 376. The effect of the state\nconstitutional amendment was to \u201csignificantly encourage\nand involve the State in private racial discriminations.\u201d\nId., at 381. In a dissent joined by three other Justices,\nJustice Harlan disagreed with the majority\u2019s holding. Id.,\nat 387. The dissent reasoned that California, by the action\nof its voters, simply wanted the State to remain neutral in\nthis area, so that the State was not a party to discrimina-\ntion. Id., at 389. That dissenting voice did not prevail\nagainst the majority\u2019s conclusion that the state action in\nquestion encouraged discrimination, causing real and\nspecific injury.\n   The next precedent of relevance, Hunter v. Erickson, 393\nU. S. 385 (1969), is central to the arguments the respond-\nents make in the instant case. In Hunter, the Court for\nthe first time elaborated what the Court of Appeals here\nstyled the \u201cpolitical process\u201d doctrine. There, the Akron\nCity Council found that the citizens of Akron consisted of\n\u201c \u2018people of different race[s], . . . many of whom live in\ncircumscribed and segregated areas, under sub-standard\nunhealthful, unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded condi-\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\ntions, because of discrimination in the sale, lease, rental\nand financing of housing.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 391. To address the\nproblem, Akron enacted a fair housing ordinance to pro-\nhibit that sort of discrimination. In response, voters\namended the city charter to overturn the ordinance and to\nrequire that any additional antidiscrimination housing\nordinance be approved by referendum. But most other\nordinances \u201cregulating the real property market\u201d were not\nsubject to those threshold requirements. Id., at 390. The\nplaintiff, a black woman in Akron, Ohio, alleged that her\nreal estate agent could not show her certain residences\nbecause the owners had specified they would not sell to\nblack persons.\n   Central to the Court\u2019s reasoning in Hunter was that the\ncharter amendment was enacted in circumstances where\nwidespread racial discrimination in the sale and rental of\nhousing led to segregated housing, forcing many to live in\n\u201c \u2018unhealthful, unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded condi-\ntions.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 391. The Court stated: \u201cIt is against this\nbackground that the referendum required by [the charter\namendment] must be assessed.\u201d Ibid. Akron attempted to\ncharacterize the charter amendment \u201csimply as a public\ndecision to move slowly in the delicate area of race rela-\ntions\u201d and as a means \u201cto allow the people of Akron to\nparticipate\u201d in the decision. Id., at 392. The Court rejected\nAkron\u2019s flawed \u201cjustifications for its discrimination,\u201d\njustifications that by their own terms had the effect of\nacknowledging the targeted nature of the charter amend-\nment. Ibid. The Court noted, furthermore, that the char-\nter amendment was unnecessary as a general means of\npublic control over the city council; for the people of Akron\nalready were empowered to overturn ordinances by refer-\nendum. Id., at 390, n. 6. The Court found that the city\ncharter amendment, by singling out antidiscrimination\nordinances, \u201cplaces special burden on racial minorities\nwithin the governmental process,\u201d thus becoming as im-\n8                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\npermissible as any other government action taken with\nthe invidious intent to injure a racial minority. Id., at 391.\nJustice Harlan filed a concurrence. He argued the city\ncharter amendment \u201chas the clear purpose of making it\nmore difficult for certain racial and religious minorities to\nachieve legislation that is in their interest.\u201d Id., at 395.\nBut without regard to the sentence just quoted, Hunter\nrests on the unremarkable principle that the State may\nnot alter the procedures of government to target racial\nminorities. The facts in Hunter established that invidious\ndiscrimination would be the necessary result of the proce-\ndural restructuring. Thus, in Mulkey and Hunter, there\nwas a demonstrated injury on the basis of race that, by\nreasons of state encouragement or participation, became\nmore aggravated.\n  Seattle is the third case of principal relevance here.\nThere, the school board adopted a mandatory busing\nprogram to alleviate racial isolation of minority students\nin local schools. Voters who opposed the school board\u2019s\nbusing plan passed a state initiative that barred busing to\ndesegregate. The Court first determined that, although\n\u201cwhite as well as Negro children benefit from\u201d diversity,\nthe school board\u2019s plan \u201cinures primarily to the benefit of\nthe minority.\u201d 458 U. S., at 472. The Court next found\nthat \u201cthe practical effect\u201d of the state initiative was to\n\u201cremov[e] the authority to address a racial problem\u2014and\nonly a racial problem\u2014from the existing decisionmaking\nbody, in such a way as to burden minority interests\u201d be-\ncause advocates of busing \u201cnow must seek relief from the\nstate legislature, or from the statewide electorate.\u201d Id., at\n474. The Court therefore found that the initiative had\n\u201cexplicitly us[ed] the racial nature of a decision to deter-\nmine the decisionmaking process.\u201d Id., at 470 (emphasis\ndeleted).\n  Seattle is best understood as a case in which the state\naction in question (the bar on busing enacted by the\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Although there had\nbeen no judicial finding of de jure segregation with respect\nto Seattle\u2019s school district, it appears as though school\nsegregation in the district in the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s may\nhave been the partial result of school board policies that\n\u201cpermitted white students to transfer out of black schools\nwhile restricting the transfer of black students into white\nschools.\u201d Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seat-\ntle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 807\u2013808 (2007)\n(BREYER, J., dissenting). In 1977, the National Associa-\ntion for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed\na complaint with the Office for Civil Rights, a federal\nagency. The NAACP alleged that the school board had\nmaintained a system of de jure segregation. Specifically,\nthe complaint alleged \u201cthat the Seattle School Board had\ncreated or perpetuated unlawful racial segregation\nthrough, e.g., certain school-transfer criteria, a construc-\ntion program that needlessly built new schools in white\nareas, district line-drawing criteria, the maintenance of\ninferior facilities at black schools, the use of explicit racial\ncriteria in the assignment of teachers and other staff, and\na general pattern of delay in respect to the implementa-\ntion of promised desegregation efforts.\u201d Id., at 810. As\npart of a settlement with the Office for Civil Rights, the\nschool board implemented the \u201cSeattle Plan,\u201d which used\nbusing and mandatory reassignments between elementary\nschools to reduce racial imbalance and which was the\nsubject of the state initiative at issue in Seattle. See 551\nU. S., at 807\u2013812.\n   As this Court held in Parents Involved, the school\nboard\u2019s purported remedial action would not be permissi-\nble today absent a showing of de jure segregation. Id., at\n720\u2013721. That holding prompted JUSTICE BREYER to\nobserve in dissent, as noted above, that one permissible\n10                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nreading of the record was that the school board had main-\ntained policies to perpetuate racial segregation in the\nschools. In all events we must understand Seattle as\nSeattle understood itself, as a case in which neither the\nState nor the United States \u201cchallenge[d] the propriety of\nrace-conscious student assignments for the purpose of\nachieving integration, even absent a finding of prior\nde jure segregation.\u201d 458 U. S. at 472, n. 15. In other\nwords the legitimacy and constitutionality of the remedy\nin question (busing for desegregation) was assumed, and\nSeattle must be understood on that basis. Ibid. Seattle\ninvolved a state initiative that \u201cwas carefully tailored to\ninterfere only with desegregative busing.\u201d Id., at 471. The\nSeattle Court, accepting the validity of the school board\u2019s\nbusing remedy as a predicate to its analysis of the consti-\ntutional question, found that the State\u2019s disapproval of the\nschool board\u2019s busing remedy was an aggravation of the\nvery racial injury in which the State itself was complicit.\n   The broad language used in Seattle, however, went well\nbeyond the analysis needed to resolve the case. The Court\nthere seized upon the statement in Justice Harlan\u2019s con-\ncurrence in Hunter that the procedural change in that case\nhad \u201cthe clear purpose of making it more difficult for\ncertain racial and religious minorities to achieve legisla-\ntion that is in their interest.\u201d 385 U. S., at 395. That\nlanguage, taken in the context of the facts in Hunter, is\nbest read simply to describe the necessity for finding an\nequal protection violation where specific injuries from\nhostile discrimination were at issue. The Seattle Court,\nhowever, used the language from the Hunter concurrence\nto establish a new and far-reaching rationale. Seattle\nstated that where a government policy \u201cinures primarily\nto the benefit of the minority\u201d and \u201cminorities . . . con-\nsider\u201d the policy to be \u201c \u2018in their interest,\u2019 \u201d then any state\naction that \u201cplace[s] effective decisionmaking authority\nover\u201d that policy \u201cat a different level of government\u201d must\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

S., at 472, 474.\nIn essence, according to the broad reading of Seattle, any\nstate action with a \u201cracial focus\u201d that makes it \u201cmore\ndifficult for certain racial minorities than for other groups\u201d\nto \u201cachieve legislation that is in their interest\u201d is subject to\nstrict scrutiny. It is this reading of Seattle that the Court\nof Appeals found to be controlling here. And that reading\nmust be rejected.\n    The broad rationale that the Court of Appeals adopted\ngoes beyond the necessary holding and the meaning of the\nprecedents said to support it; and in the instant case\nneither the formulation of the general rule just set forth\nnor the precedents cited to authenticate it suffice to inval-\nidate Proposal 2. The expansive reading of Seattle has no\nprincipled limitation and raises serious questions of com-\npatibility with the Court\u2019s settled equal protection juris-\nprudence. To the extent Seattle is read to require the\nCourt to determine and declare which political policies\nserve the \u201cinterest\u201d of a group defined in racial terms, that\nrationale was unnecessary to the decision in Seattle; it has\nno support in precedent; and it raises serious constitu-\ntional concerns. That expansive language does not provide\na proper guide for decisions and should not be deemed\nauthoritative or controlling. The rule that the Court of\nAppeals elaborated and respondents seek to establish here\nwould contradict central equal protection principles.\n    In cautioning against \u201cimpermissible racial stereotypes,\u201d\nthis Court has rejected the assumption that \u201cmembers of\nthe same racial group\u2014regardless of their age, education,\neconomic status, or the community in which they live\u2014\nthink alike, share the same political interests, and will\nprefer the same candidates at the polls.\u201d Shaw v. Reno,\n509 U. S. 630, 647 (1993); see also Metro Broadcasting,\nInc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 636 (1990) (KENNEDY, J., dis-\nsenting) (rejecting the \u201cdemeaning notion that members of\n. . . defined racial groups ascribe to certain \u2018minority views\u2019\n12                  SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nthat must be different from those of other citizens\u201d). It\ncannot be entertained as a serious proposition that all\nindividuals of the same race think alike. Yet that proposi-\ntion would be a necessary beginning point were the Seattle\nformulation to control, as the Court of Appeals held it did\nin this case. And if it were deemed necessary to probe how\nsome races define their own interest in political matters,\nstill another beginning point would be to define individu-\nals according to race. But in a society in which those lines\nare becoming more blurred, the attempt to define race-\nbased categories also raises serious questions of its own.\nGovernment action that classifies individuals on the basis\nof race is inherently suspect and carries the danger of\nperpetuating the very racial divisions the polity seeks to\ntranscend. Cf. Ho v. San Francisco Unified School Dist.,\n147 F. 3d 854, 858 (CA9 1998) (school district delineating\n13 racial categories for purposes of racial balancing).\nWere courts to embark upon this venture not only would it\nbe undertaken with no clear legal standards or accepted\nsources to guide judicial decision but also it would result\nin, or at least impose a high risk of, inquiries and catego-\nries dependent upon demeaning stereotypes, classifica-\ntions of questionable constitutionality on their own terms.\n   Even assuming these initial steps could be taken in a\nmanner consistent with a sound analytic and judicial\nframework, the court would next be required to determine\nthe policy realms in which certain groups\u2014groups defined\nby race\u2014have a political interest. That undertaking,\nagain without guidance from any accepted legal stand-\nards, would risk, in turn, the creation of incentives for\nthose who support or oppose certain policies to cast the\ndebate in terms of racial advantage or disadvantage. Thus\ncould racial antagonisms and conflict tend to arise in the\ncontext of judicial decisions as courts undertook to an-\nnounce what particular issues of public policy should be\nclassified as advantageous to some group defined by race.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nThis risk is inherent in adopting the Seattle formulation.\n   There would be no apparent limiting standards defining\nwhat public policies should be included in what Seattle\ncalled policies that \u201cinur[e] primarily to the benefit of the\nminority\u201d and that \u201cminorities . . . consider\u201d to be \u201c \u2018in\ntheir interest.\u2019 \u201d 458 U. S., at 472, 474. Those who seek to\nrepresent the interests of particular racial groups could\nattempt to advance those aims by demanding an equal\nprotection ruling that any number of matters be foreclosed\nfrom voter review or participation. In a nation in which\ngovernmental policies are wide ranging, those who seek to\nlimit voter participation might be tempted, were this\nCourt to adopt the Seattle formulation, to urge that a\ngroup they choose to define by race or racial stereotypes\nare advantaged or disadvantaged by any number of laws\nor decisions. Tax policy, housing subsidies, wage regula-\ntions, and even the naming of public schools, highways,\nand monuments are just a few examples of what could\nbecome a list of subjects that some organizations could\ninsist should be beyond the power of voters to decide, or\nbeyond the power of a legislature to decide when enacting\nlimits on the power of local authorities or other govern-\nmental entities to address certain subjects. Racial division\nwould be validated, not discouraged, were the Seattle\nformulation, and the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in\nthis case, to remain in force.\n   Perhaps, when enacting policies as an exercise of demo-\ncratic self-government, voters will determine that race-\nbased preferences should be adopted. The constitutional\nvalidity of some of those choices regarding racial prefer-\nences is not at issue here. The holding in the instant case\nis simply that the courts may not disempower the voters\nfrom choosing which path to follow. In the realm of policy\ndiscussions the regular give-and-take of debate ought to be\na context in which rancor or discord based on race are\navoided, not invited. And if these factors are to be inter-\n14                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\njected, surely it ought not to be at the invitation or insist-\nence of the courts.\n   One response to these concerns may be that objections\nto the larger consequences of the Seattle formulation need\nnot be confronted in this case, for here race was an un-\ndoubted subject of the ballot issue. But a number of prob-\nlems raised by Seattle, such as racial definitions, still\napply. And this principal flaw in the ruling of the Court of\nAppeals does remain: Here there was no infliction of a\nspecific injury of the kind at issue in Mulkey and Hunter\nand in the history of the Seattle schools. Here there is no\nprecedent for extending these cases to restrict the right of\nMichigan voters to determine that race-based preferences\ngranted by Michigan governmental entities should be\nended.\n   It should also be noted that the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals in this case of necessity calls into question other\nlong-settled rulings on similar state policies. The Califor-\nnia Supreme Court has held that a California constitu-\ntional amendment prohibiting racial preferences in public\ncontracting does not violate the rule set down by Seattle.\nCoral Constr., Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630898\"><a href=\"/cal/eu5j/coral-construction-inc-v-city-and-county-of-san-fr/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235 P. 3d 947 (2010). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit has held that the same amendment,\nwhich also barred racial preferences in public education,\ndoes not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Wilson, 122\nF. 3d 692 (1997). If the Court were to affirm the essential\nrationale of the Court of Appeals in the instant case, those\nholdings would be invalidated, or at least would be put in\nserious question. The Court, by affirming the judgment\nnow before it, in essence would announce a finding that\nthe past 15 years of state public debate on this issue have\nbeen improper. And were the argument made that Coral\nmight still stand because it involved racial preferences in\npublic contracting while this case concerns racial prefer-\nences in university admissions, the implication would be\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nthat the constitutionality of laws forbidding racial prefer-\nences depends on the policy interest at stake, the concern\nthat, as already explained, the voters deem it wise to avoid\nbecause of its divisive potential. The instant case presents\nthe question involved in Coral and Wilson but not involved\nin Mulkey, Hunter, and Seattle. That question is not how\nto address or prevent injury caused on account of race but\nwhether voters may determine whether a policy of race-\nbased preferences should be continued.\n   By approving Proposal 2 and thereby adding \u00a726 to their\nState Constitution, the Michigan voters exercised their\nprivilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their demo-\ncratic power. In the federal system States \u201crespond,\nthrough the enactment of positive law, to the initiative of\nthose who seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own\ntimes.\u201d Bond, 564 U. S., at \u2013\u2013\u2013 (slip op., at 9). Michigan\nvoters used the initiative system to bypass public officials\nwho were deemed not responsive to the concerns of a\nmajority of the voters with respect to a policy of granting\nrace-based preferences that raises difficult and delicate\nissues.\n   The freedom secured by the Constitution consists, in one\nof its essential dimensions, of the right of the individual\nnot to be injured by the unlawful exercise of governmental\npower. The mandate for segregated schools, Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); a wrongful\ninvasion of the home, Silverman v. United States, 365\nU. S. 505 (1961); or punishing a protester whose views\noffend others, Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989); and\nscores of other examples teach that individual liberty has\nconstitutional protection, and that liberty\u2019s full extent and\nmeaning may remain yet to be discovered and affirmed.\nYet freedom does not stop with individual rights. Our\nconstitutional system embraces, too, the right of citizens to\ndebate so they can learn and decide and then, through the\npolitical process, act in concert to try to shape the course\n16                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nof their own times and the course of a nation that must\nstrive always to make freedom ever greater and more\nsecure.     Here Michigan voters acted in concert and\nstatewide to seek consensus and adopt a policy on a diffi-\ncult subject against a historical background of race in\nAmerica that has been a source of tragedy and persisting\ninjustice. That history demands that we continue to learn,\nto listen, and to remain open to new approaches if we are\nto aspire always to a constitutional order in which all\npersons are treated with fairness and equal dignity. Were\nthe Court to rule that the question addressed by Michigan\nvoters is too sensitive or complex to be within the grasp of\nthe electorate; or that the policies at issue remain too\ndelicate to be resolved save by university officials or facul-\nties, acting at some remove from immediate public scru-\ntiny and control; or that these matters are so arcane that\nthe electorate\u2019s power must be limited because the people\ncannot prudently exercise that power even after a full\ndebate, that holding would be an unprecedented re-\nstriction on the exercise of a fundamental right held not\njust by one person but by all in common. It is the right to\nspeak and debate and learn and then, as a matter of polit-\nical will, to act through a lawful electoral process.\n   The respondents in this case insist that a difficult ques-\ntion of public policy must be taken from the reach of the\nvoters, and thus removed from the realm of public discus-\nsion, dialogue, and debate in an election campaign. Quite\nin addition to the serious First Amendment implications of\nthat position with respect to any particular election, it is\ninconsistent with the underlying premises of a responsi-\nble, functioning democracy. One of those premises is that\na democracy has the capacity\u2014and the duty\u2014to learn\nfrom its past mistakes; to discover and confront persisting\nbiases; and by respectful, rationale deliberation to rise\nabove those flaws and injustices. That process is impeded,\nnot advanced, by court decrees based on the proposition\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nthat the public cannot have the requisite repose to discuss\ncertain issues. It is demeaning to the democratic process\nto presume that the voters are not capable of deciding an\nissue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds.\nThe process of public discourse and political debate should\nnot be foreclosed even if there is a risk that during a pub-\nlic campaign there will be those, on both sides, who seek to\nuse racial division and discord to their own political ad-\nvantage. An informed public can, and must, rise above\nthis. The idea of democracy is that it can, and must,\nmature. Freedom embraces the right, indeed the duty, to\nengage in a rational, civic discourse in order to determine\nhow best to form a consensus to shape the destiny of the\nNation and its people. These First Amendment dynamics\nwould be disserved if this Court were to say that the ques-\ntion here at issue is beyond the capacity of the voters to\ndebate and then to determine.\n   These precepts are not inconsistent with the well-\nestablished principle that when hurt or injury is inflicted\non racial minorities by the encouragement or command of\nlaws or other state action, the Constitution requires re-\ndress by the courts. Cf. Johnson v. California, 543 U. S.\n499, 511\u2013512 (2005) (\u201c[S]earching judicial review . . . is\nnecessary to guard against invidious discrimination\u201d);\nEdmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 619\n(1991) (\u201cRacial discrimination\u201d is \u201cinvidious in all con-\ntexts\u201d). As already noted, those were the circumstances\nthat the Court found present in Mulkey, Hunter, and\nSeattle. But those circumstances are not present here.\n   For reasons already discussed, Mulkey, Hunter, and\nSeattle are not precedents that stand for the conclusion\nthat Michigan\u2019s voters must be disempowered from acting.\nThose cases were ones in which the political restriction in\nquestion was designed to be used, or was likely to be used,\nto encourage infliction of injury by reason of race. What is\nat stake here is not whether injury will be inflicted but\n18                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nwhether government can be instructed not to follow a\ncourse that entails, first, the definition of racial categories\nand, second, the grant of favored status to persons in some\nracial categories and not others. The electorate\u2019s instruc-\ntion to governmental entities not to embark upon the\ncourse of race-defined and race-based preferences was\nadopted, we must assume, because the voters deemed a\npreference system to be unwise, on account of what voters\nmay deem its latent potential to become itself a source of\nthe very resentments and hostilities based on race that\nthis Nation seeks to put behind it. Whether those adverse\nresults would follow is, and should be, the subject of de-\nbate. Voters might likewise consider, after debate and\nreflection, that programs designed to increase diversity\u2014\nconsistent with the Constitution\u2014are a necessary part of\nprogress to transcend the stigma of past racism.\n   This case is not about how the debate about racial pref-\nerences should be resolved. It is about who may resolve it.\nThere is no authority in the Constitution of the United\nStates or in this Court\u2019s precedents for the Judiciary to set\naside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination\nto the voters. See Sailors v. Board of Ed. of County of\nKent, 387 U. S. 105, 109 (1967) (\u201cSave and unless the\nstate, county, or municipal government runs afoul of a\nfederally protected right, it has vast leeway in the man-\nagement of its internal affairs\u201d). Deliberative debate on\nsensitive issues such as racial preferences all too often\nmay shade into rancor. But that does not justify removing\ncertain court-determined issues from the voters\u2019 reach.\nDemocracy does not presume that some subjects are either\ntoo divisive or too profound for public debate.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is reversed.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S.,\nat 343; or simply opposed in principle to the notion of\n\u201cbenign\u201d racial discrimination\u2014have gotten out of the\nracial-preferences business altogether. And with our\nexpress encouragement: \u201cUniversities in California, Flor-\nida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in\nadmissions are prohibited by state law, are currently\nengaging in experimenting with a wide variety of alterna-\ntive approaches. Universities in other States can and\nshould draw on the most promising aspects of these race-\nneutral alternatives as they develop.\u201d Id., at 342 (empha-\nsis added). Respondents seem to think this admonition\nwas merely in jest.1 The experiment, they maintain, is not\nonly over; it never rightly began. Neither the people of the\nStates nor their legislatures ever had the option of direct-\ning subordinate public-university officials to cease consid-\nering the race of applicants, since that would deny mem-\nbers of those minority groups the option of enacting a\npolicy designed to further their interest, thus denying\nthem the equal protection of the laws. Never mind that it\nis hotly disputed whether the practice of race-based ad-\nmissions is ever in a racial minority\u2019s interest. Cf. id., at\n371\u2013373 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). And never mind that, were a public university to\nstake its defense of a race-based-admissions policy on the\nground that it was designed to benefit primarily minorities\n(as opposed to all students, regardless of color, by enhanc-\ning diversity), we would hold the policy unconstitutional.\nSee id., at 322\u2013325.\n   But the battleground for this case is not the constitu-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For simplicity\u2019s sake, I use \u201crespondent\u201d or \u201crespondents\u201d through-\n\nout the opinion to describe only those parties who are adverse to\npetitioner, not Eric Russell, a respondent who supports petitioner.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Seattle\nSchool Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457 (1982), and Hunter v.\nErickson, 393 U. S. 385 (1969). I agree with those parts of\nthe plurality opinion that repudiate this doctrine. But I do\nnot agree with its reinterpretation of Seattle and Hunter,\nwhich makes them stand in part for the cloudy and doctri-\nnally anomalous proposition that whenever state action\nposes \u201cthe serious risk . . . of causing specific injuries on\naccount of race,\u201d it denies equal protection. Ante, at 9. I\nwould instead reaffirm that the \u201cordinary principles of our\nlaw [and] of our democratic heritage\u201d require \u201cplaintiffs\nalleging equal protection violations\u201d stemming from fa-\ncially neutral acts to \u201cprove intent and causation and not\nmerely the existence of racial disparity.\u201d Freeman v. Pitts,\n503 U. S. 467, 506 (1992) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (citing\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976)). I would fur-\nther hold that a law directing state actors to provide equal\nprotection is (to say the least) facially neutral, and cannot\nviolate the Constitution. Section 26 of the Michigan Con-\nstitution (formerly Proposal 2) rightly stands.\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n   The political-process doctrine has its roots in two of our\ncases. The first is Hunter. In 1964, the Akron City Coun-\ncil passed a fair-housing ordinance \u201c \u2018assur[ing] equal\nopportunity to all persons to live in decent housing facili-\nties regardless of race, color, religion, ancestry or national\norigin.\u2019 \u201d 393 U. S., at 386. Soon after, the city\u2019s voters\npassed an amendment to the Akron City Charter stating\nthat any ordinance enacted by the council that \u201c \u2018regu-\nlates\u2019 \u201d commercial transactions in real property \u201c \u2018on the\nbasis of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry\u2019 \u201d\u2014\nincluding the already enacted 1964 ordinance\u2014\u201cmust first\n4                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbe approved by a majority of the electors voting on the\nquestion\u201d at a later referendum. Id., at 387. The question\nwas whether the charter amendment denied equal protec-\ntion. Answering yes, the Court explained that \u201calthough\nthe law on its face treats Negro and white, Jew and gentile\nin an identical manner, the reality is that the law\u2019s impact\nfalls on the minority. The majority needs no protection\nagainst discrimination.\u201d Id., at 391. By placing a \u201cspecial\nburden on racial minorities within the governmental\nprocesses,\u201d the amendment \u201cdisadvantage[d]\u201d a racial\nminority \u201cby making it more difficult to enact legislation\nin its behalf.\u201d Id., at 391, 393.\n   The reasoning in Seattle is of a piece. Resolving to\n\u201celiminate all [racial] imbalance from the Seattle public\nschools,\u201d the city school board passed a mandatory busing\nand pupil-reassignment plan of the sort typically imposed\non districts guilty of de jure segregation. 458 U. S., at\n460\u2013461. A year later, the citizens of the State of Wash-\nington passed Initiative 350, which directed (with excep-\ntions) that \u201c \u2018no school . . . shall directly or indirectly re-\nquire any student to attend a school other than the school\nwhich is geographically nearest or next nearest the stu-\ndent\u2019s place of residence . . . and which offers the course of\nstudy pursued by such student,\u2019 \u201d permitting only court-\nordered race-based busing. Id., at 462. The lower courts\nheld Initiative 350 unconstitutional, and we affirmed,\nannouncing in the prelude of our analysis\u2014as though it\nwere beyond debate\u2014that the Equal Protection Clause\nforbade laws that \u201csubtly distor[t] governmental processes\nin such a way as to place special burdens on the ability of\nminority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.\u201d Id., at\n467.\n   The first question in Seattle was whether the subject\nmatter of Initiative 350 was a \u201c \u2018racial\u2019 issue,\u201d triggering\nHunter and its process doctrine. 458 U. S., at 471\u2013472. It\nwas \u201cundoubtedly. . . true\u201d that whites and blacks were\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201ccounted among both the supporters and the opponents of\nInitiative 350.\u201d Id., at 472. It was \u201cequally clear\u201d that\nboth white and black children benefited from desegre-\ngated schools. Ibid. Nonetheless, we concluded that desegre-\ngation \u201cinures primarily to the benefit of the minority, and\nis designed for that purpose.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). In\nany event, it was \u201cenough that minorities may consider\nbusing for integration to be \u2018legislation that is in their\ninterest.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 474 (quoting Hunter, supra, at 395\n(Harlan, J., concurring)).\n   So we proceeded to the heart of the political-process\nanalysis. We held Initiative 350 unconstitutional, since it\nremoved \u201cthe authority to address a racial problem\u2014and\nonly a racial problem\u2014from the existing decisionmaking\nbody, in such a way as to burden minority interests.\u201d\nSeattle, 458 U. S., at 474. Although school boards in\nWashington retained authority over other student-\nassignment issues and over most matters of educational\npolicy generally, under Initiative 350, minorities favoring\nrace-based busing would have to \u201csurmount a considerably\nhigher hurdle\u201d than the mere petitioning of a local assem-\nbly: They \u201cnow must seek relief from the state legislature,\nor from the statewide electorate,\u201d a \u201cdifferent level of\ngovernment.\u201d Ibid.\n   The relentless logic of Hunter and Seattle would point to\na similar conclusion in this case. In those cases, one level\nof government exercised borrowed authority over an ap-\nparently \u201cracial issue,\u201d until a higher level of government\ncalled the loan. So too here. In those cases, we deemed\nthe revocation an equal-protection violation regardless of\nwhether it facially classified according to race or reflected\nan invidious purpose to discriminate. Here, the Court of\nAppeals did the same.\n   The plurality sees it differently. Though it, too, dis-\navows the political-process-doctrine basis on which Hunter\nand Seattle were decided, ante, at 10\u201314, it does not take\n6                        SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe next step of overruling those cases. Rather, it reinter-\nprets them beyond recognition. Hunter, the plurality\nsuggests, was a case in which the challenged act had\n\u201ctarget[ed] racial minorities.\u201d Ante, at 8. Maybe, but the\nHunter Court neither found that to be so nor considered it\nrelevant, bypassing the question of intent entirely, satis-\nfied that its newly minted political-process theory sufficed\nto invalidate the charter amendment.\n   As for Seattle, what was really going on, according to the\nplurality, was that Initiative 350 had the consequence (if\nnot the purpose) of preserving the harms effected by prior\nde jure segregation. Thus, \u201cthe political restriction in\nquestion was designed to be used, or was likely to be used,\nto encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.\u201d Ante,\nat 17. That conclusion is derived not from the opinion but\nfrom recently discovered evidence that the city of Seattle\nhad been a cause of its schools\u2019 racial imbalance all along:\n\u201cAlthough there had been no judicial finding of de jure\nsegregation with respect to Seattle\u2019s school district, it\nappears as though school segregation in the district in the\n1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s may have been the partial result of\nschool board policies.\u201d Ante, at 9.2 That the district\u2019s\neffort to end racial imbalance had been stymied by Initia-\ntive 350 meant that the people, by passing it, somehow\nhad become complicit in Seattle\u2019s equal-protection-denying\nstatus quo, whether they knew it or not. Hence, there\nwas in Seattle a government-furthered \u201cinfliction of a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The plurality cites evidence from JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s dissent in Par\u00ad\n\nents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551\nU. S. 701 (2007), to suggest that the city had been a \u201cpartial\u201d cause of\nits segregation problem. Ante, at 9. The plurality in Parents Involved\ncriticized that dissent for relying on irrelevant evidence, for \u201celid[ing\nthe] distinction between de jure and de facto segregation,\u201d and for\n\u201ccasually intimat[ing] that Seattle\u2019s school attendance patterns re-\nflect[ed] illegal segregation.\u201d 551 U. S., at 736\u2013737, and n. 15. Today\u2019s\nplurality sides with the dissent and repeats its errors.\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

The\nopinion assumes throughout that Seattle\u2019s schools suffered\nat most from de facto segregation, see, e.g., 458 U. S., at\n474, 475\u2014that is, segregation not the \u201cproduct . . . of state\naction but of private choices,\u201d having no \u201cconstitutional\nimplications,\u201d Freeman, 503 U. S., at 495\u2013496. Nor did it\nanywhere state that the current racial imbalance was the\n(judicially remediable) effect of prior de jure segregation.\nAbsence of de jure segregation or the effects of de jure\nsegregation was a necessary premise of the Seattle opin-\nion. That is what made the issue of busing and pupil\nreassignment a matter of political choice rather than\njudicial mandate.3 And precisely because it was a question\nfor the political branches to decide, the manner\u2014which is\nto say, the process\u2014of its resolution implicated the Court\u2019s\nnew process theory. The opinion itself says this: \u201c[I]n the\nabsence of a constitutional violation, the desirability and\nefficacy of school desegregation are matters to be resolved\nthrough the political process. For present purposes, it is\nenough [to hold reallocation of that political decision to a\nhigher level unconstitutional] that minorities may consider\nbusing for integration to be legislation that is in their\ninterest.\u201d 458 U. S., at 474 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n                            B\n  Patently atextual, unadministrable, and contrary to our\ntraditional equal-protection jurisprudence, Hunter and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Or so the Court assumed. See 458 U. S., at 472, n. 15 (\u201cAppellants\n\nand the United States do not challenge the propriety of race-conscious\nstudent assignments for the purpose of achieving integration, even\nabsent a finding of prior de jure segregation. We therefore do not\nspecifically pass on that issue\u201d).\n8                        SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nSeattle should be overruled.\n   The problems with the political-process doctrine begin\nwith its triggering prong, which assigns to a court the task\nof determining whether a law that reallocates policy-\nmaking authority concerns a \u201cracial issue.\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S.,\nat 473. Seattle takes a couple of dissatisfying cracks at\ndefining this crucial term. It suggests that an issue is\nracial if adopting one position on the question would \u201cat\nbottom inur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority, and\nis designed for that purpose.\u201d Id., at 472. It is irrelevant\nthat, as in Hunter and Seattle, 458 U. S., at 472, both the\nracial minority and the racial majority benefit from the\npolicy in question, and members of both groups favor it.\nJudges should instead focus their guesswork on their own\njuridical sense of what is primarily for the benefit of mi-\nnorities. Cf. ibid. (regarding as dispositive what \u201cour\ncases\u201d suggest is beneficial to minorities). On second\nthought, maybe judges need only ask this question: Is it\npossible \u201cthat minorities may consider\u201d the policy in ques-\ntion to be \u201cin their interest\u201d? Id., at 474. If so, you can be\nsure that you are dealing with a \u201cracial issue.\u201d4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent\u2019s version of this test is just as scattershot. Since, ac-\n\ncording to the dissent, the doctrine forbids \u201creconfigur[ing] the political\nprocess in a manner that burdens only a racial minority,\u201d post, at 5\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (emphasis added), it must be that the reason\nthe underlying issue (that is, the issue concerning which the process\nhas been reconfigured) is \u201cracial\u201d is that the policy in question benefits\nonly a racial minority (if it also benefited persons not belonging to a\nracial majority, then the political-process reconfiguration would burden\nthem as well). On second thought: The issue is \u201cracial\u201d if the policy\nbenefits primarily a racial minority and \u201c \u2018[is] designed for that pur-\npose,\u2019 \u201d post, at 44. This is the standard Seattle purported to apply. But\nunder that standard, \u00a726 does not affect a \u201cracial issue,\u201d because under\nGrutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003), race-based admissions\npolicies may not constitutionally be \u201cdesigned for [the] purpose,\u201d\nSeattle, supra, at 472, of benefiting primarily racial minorities, but\nmust be designed for the purpose of achieving educational benefits for\nstudents of all races, Grutter, supra, at 322\u2013325.

For one thing,\nit involves judges in the dirty business of dividing the\nNation \u201cinto racial blocs,\u201d Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.\nFCC, 497 U. S. 547, 603, 610 (1990) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissent-\ning); ante, at 11\u201313. That task is as difficult as it is unap-\npealing. (Does a half-Latino, half\u2013American Indian have\nLatino interests, American-Indian interests, both, half of\nboth?5) What is worse, the exercise promotes the noxious\nfiction that, knowing only a person\u2019s color or ethnicity, we\ncan be sure that he has a predetermined set of policy\n\u201cinterests,\u201d thus \u201creinforc[ing] the perception that mem-\nbers of the same racial group\u2014regardless of their age,\neducation, economic status, or the community in which\nthey live\u2014think alike, [and] share the same political\ninterests.\u201d6 Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 647 (1993).\nWhether done by a judge or a school board, such \u201cracial\nstereotyping [is] at odds with equal protection mandates.\u201d\nMiller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 920 (1995).\n   But that is not the \u201cracial issue\u201d prong\u2019s only defect.\nMore fundamentally, it misreads the Equal Protection\nClause to protect \u201cparticular group[s],\u201d a construction that\nwe have tirelessly repudiated in a \u201clong line of cases\nunderstanding equal protection as a personal right.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmean that an issue is \u201cracial\u201d so long as the policy in question has the\nincidental effect (an effect not flowing from its design) of benefiting\nprimarily racial minorities.\n  5 And how many members of a particular racial group must take the\n\nsame position on an issue before we suppose that the position is in the\nentire group\u2019s interest? Not every member, the dissent suggests, post,\nat 44. Beyond that, who knows? Five percent? Eighty-five percent?\n  6 The dissent proves my point.

BAMN\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable\nlegislation,\u201d but Michigan voters\u2019 ability to amend their\nConstitution is not. It seems to me quite the opposite.\nAmending the Constitution requires the approval of only\n\u201ca majority of the electors voting on the question.\u201d Mich.\nConst., Art. XII, \u00a72. By contrast, voting in a favorable\nboard (each of which has eight members) at the three\nmajor public universities requires electing by majority\nvote at least 15 different candidates, several of whom\nwould be running during different election cycles. See\nBAMN v. Regents of Univ. of Mich., 701 F. 3d 466, 508\n(CA6 2012) (Sutton, J., dissenting). So if Michigan voters,\ninstead of amending their Constitution, had pursued the\ndissent\u2019s preferred path of electing board members promis-\ning to \u201cabolish race-sensitive admissions policies,\u201d post, at\n3, it would have been harder, not easier, for racial minori-\nties favoring affirmative action to overturn that decision.\nBut the more important point is that we should not design\nour jurisprudence to conform to dictum in a footnote in a\nfour-Justice opinion.\n                             C\n  Moving from the appalling to the absurd, I turn now to\nthe second part of the Hunter-Seattle analysis\u2014which is\napparently no more administrable than the first, compare\npost, at 4\u20136 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cThis\ncase . . . does not involve a reordering of the political\nprocess\u201d), with post, at 25\u201329 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting)\n(yes, it does). This part of the inquiry directs a court to\ndetermine whether the challenged act \u201cplace[s] effective\ndecisionmaking authority over [the] racial issue at a dif-\nferent level of government.\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S., at 474.\nThe laws in both Hunter and Seattle were thought to fail\nthis test. In both cases, \u201cthe effect of the challenged\naction was to redraw decisionmaking authority over racial\nmatters\u2014and only over racial matters\u2014in such a way as\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nto place comparative burdens on minorities.\u201d 458 U. S., at\n475, n. 17. This, we said, a State may not do.\n   By contrast, in another line of cases, we have empha-\nsized the near-limitless sovereignty of each State to design\nits governing structure as it sees fit. Generally, \u201ca State is\nafforded wide leeway when experimenting with the appro-\npriate allocation of state legislative power\u201d and may create\n\u201cpolitical subdivisions such as cities and counties . . . \u2018as\nconvenient agencies for exercising such of the governmen-\ntal powers of the state as may be entrusted to them.\u2019 \u201d\nHolt Civic Club v. Tuscaloosa, 439 U. S. 60, 71 (1978)\n(quoting Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161, 178 (1907)).\nAccordingly, States have \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d to deter-\nmine the \u201cnumber, nature and duration of the powers\nconferred upon [municipal] corporations and the territory\nover which they shall be exercised.\u201d Holt Civic Club,\nsupra, at 71. So it would seem to go without saying that a\nState may give certain powers to cities, later assign the\nsame powers to counties, and even reclaim them for itself.\n   Taken to the limits of its logic, Hunter-Seattle is the\ngaping exception that nearly swallows the rule of struc-\ntural state sovereignty. If indeed the Fourteenth Amend-\nment forbids States to \u201cplace effective decisionmaking\nauthority over\u201d racial issues at \u201cdifferent level[s] of gov-\nernment,\u201d then it must be true that the Amendment\u2019s\nratification in 1868 worked a partial ossification of each\nState\u2019s governing structure, rendering basically irrevoca-\nble the power of any subordinate state official who, the\nday before the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s passage, hap-\npened to enjoy legislatively conferred authority over a\n\u201cracial issue.\u201d Under the Fourteenth Amendment, that\nsubordinate entity (suppose it is a city council) could itself\ntake action on the issue, action either favorable or unfa-\nvorable to minorities. It could even reverse itself later.\nWhat it could not do, however, is redelegate its power to\nan even lower level of state government (such as a city-\n14                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncouncil committee) without forfeiting it, since the neces-\nsary effect of wresting it back would be to put an additional\nobstacle in the path of minorities. Likewise, no entity\nor official higher up the state chain (e.g., a county board)\ncould exercise authority over the issue. Nor, even, could\nthe state legislature, or the people by constitutional\namendment, revoke the legislative conferral of power to\nthe subordinate, whether the city council, its subcommit-\ntee, or the county board. Seattle\u2019s logic would create\naffirmative-action safe havens wherever subordinate offi-\ncials in public universities (1) traditionally have enjoyed\n\u201ceffective decisionmaking authority\u201d over admissions\npolicy but (2) have not yet used that authority to prohibit\nrace-conscious admissions decisions. The mere existence\nof a subordinate\u2019s discretion over the matter would work a\nkind of reverse pre-emption. It is \u201ca strange notion\u2014alien\nto our system\u2014that local governmental bodies can forever\npre-empt the ability of a State\u2014the sovereign power\u2014to\naddress a matter of compelling concern to the State.\u201d 458\nU. S., at 495 (Powell, J., dissenting). But that is precisely\nwhat the political-process doctrine contemplates.\n   Perhaps the spirit of Seattle is especially disquieted by\nenactments of constitutional amendments. That appears\nto be the dissent\u2019s position. The problem with \u00a726, it\nsuggests, is that amending Michigan\u2019s Constitution is\nsimply not a part of that State\u2019s \u201cexisting\u201d political pro-\ncess. E.g., post, at 4, 41. What a peculiar notion: that a\nrevision of a State\u2019s fundamental law, made in precisely\nthe manner that law prescribes, by the very people who\nare the source of that law\u2019s authority, is not part of the\n\u201cpolitical process\u201d which, but for those people and that\nlaw, would not exist. This will surely come as news to the\npeople of Michigan, who, since 1914, have amended their\nConstitution 20 times. Brief for Gary Segura et al. as\nAmici Curiae 12.

Why, one might\nask, is not the amendment provision of the Michigan\nConstitution one (perhaps the most basic one) of the rules\nof the State\u2019s political process?

New York, 500 U. S. 352, 372\u2013373 (1991)\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment), and that \u201cofficial\naction will not be held unconstitutional solely because it\nresults in a racially disproportionate impact,\u201d Arlington\nHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429\nU. S. 252, 264\u2013265 (1977). Indeed, we affirmed this prin-\nciple the same day we decided Seattle: \u201c[E]ven when a\nneutral law has a disproportionately adverse effect on a\nracial minority, the Fourteenth Amendment is violated\nonly if a discriminatory purpose can be shown.\u201d Crawford\nv.

Only when\n\namending Michigan\u2019s Constitution violates Hunter-Seattle, it says, is\nthat constitutionally prescribed activity necessarily not part of the\nState\u2019s existing political process. Post, at 21, n. 7. I understand the\nargument quite well; and see quite well that it begs the question. Why\nis Michigan\u2019s action here unconstitutional? Because it violates Hunter-\nSeattle. And why does it violate Hunter-Seattle? Because it is not part\nof the State\u2019s existing political process. And why is it not part of the\nState\u2019s existing political process? Because it violates Hunter-Seattle.\n16                        SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(1982).\n   Notwithstanding our dozens of cases confirming the\nexception-less nature of the Washington v. Davis rule, the\nplurality opinion leaves ajar an effects-test escape hatch\nmodeled after Hunter and Seattle, suggesting that state\naction denies equal protection when it \u201cha[s] the serious\nrisk, if not purpose, of causing specific injuries on account\nof race,\u201d or is either \u201cdesigned to be used, or . . . likely to be\nused, to encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.\u201d\nAnte, at 9, 17 (emphasis added). Since these formulations\nenable a determination of an equal-protection violation\nwhere there is no discriminatory intent, they are incon-\nsistent with the long Washington v. Davis line of cases.10\n   Respondents argue that we need not bother with the\ndiscriminatory-purpose test, since \u00a726 may be struck more\nstraightforwardly as a racial \u201cclassification.\u201d Admitting\n(as they must) that \u00a726 does not on its face \u201cdistribut[e]\nburdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial classi-\nfications,\u201d Parents Involved in Community Schools v.\nSeattle School Dist.

A law that \u201cneither says nor implies that persons\nare to be treated differently on account of their race\u201d is not\na racial classification. Crawford, supra, at 537. That is\nparticularly true of statutes mandating equal treatment.\n\u201c[A] law that prohibits the State from classifying individu-\nals by race . . . a fortiori does not classify individuals by\nrace.\u201d Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F. 3d\n692, 702 (CA9 1997) (O\u2019Scannlain, J.).\n  Thus, the question in this case, as in every case in which\nneutral state action is said to deny equal protection on\naccount of race, is whether the action reflects a racially\ndiscriminatory purpose. Seattle stresses that \u201csingling out\nthe political processes affecting racial issues for uniquely\ndisadvantageous treatment inevitably raises dangers of\nimpermissible motivation.\u201d 458 U. S., at 486, n. 30. True\nenough, but that motivation must be proved. And re-\nspondents do not have a prayer of proving it here.

Though the Court of Ap-\npeals did not opine on this question, I would not leave it\nfor them on remand. In my view, any law expressly re-\nquiring state actors to afford all persons equal protection\nof the laws (such as Initiative 350 in Seattle, though not\nthe charter amendment in Hunter) does not\u2014cannot\u2014\ndeny \u201cto any person . . . equal protection of the laws,\u201d U.

We here\nfocus on the prohibition of \u201cgrant[ing] . . . preferential\ntreatment . . . on the basis of race . . . in . . . public educa-\ntion.\u201d I agree with the plurality that the amendment is\nconsistent with the Federal Equal Protection Clause.\nU. S. Const., Amdt. 14. But I believe this for different\nreasons.\n   First, we do not address the amendment insofar as it\nforbids the use of race-conscious admissions programs\ndesigned to remedy past exclusionary racial discrimina-\ntion or the direct effects of that discrimination. Applica-\ntion of the amendment in that context would present\ndifferent questions which may demand different answers.\nRather, we here address the amendment only as it applies\nto, and forbids, programs that, as in Grutter v. Bollinger,\n539 U. S. 306 (2003), rest upon \u201cone justification\u201d: using\n2                    SCHUETTE v.

Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701 (2007),\nI explained why I believe race-conscious programs of this\nkind are constitutional, whether implemented by law\nschools, universities, high schools, or elementary schools.\nI concluded that the Constitution does not \u201cauthorize\njudges\u201d either to forbid or to require the adoption of diver-\nsity-seeking race-conscious \u201csolutions\u201d (of the kind at issue\nhere) to such serious problems as \u201chow best to administer\nAmerica\u2019s schools\u201d to help \u201ccreate a society that includes\nall Americans.\u201d Id., at 862.\n   I continue to believe that the Constitution permits,\nthough it does not require, the use of the kind of race-\nconscious programs that are now barred by the Michigan\nConstitution. The serious educational problems that faced\nAmericans at the time this Court decided Grutter endure.\nSee, e.g., I. Mullis, M. Martin, P. Foy, & K. Drucker,\nProgress in International Reading Literacy Study, 2011\nInternational Results in Reading 38, Exh. 1.1 (2012)\n(elementary-school students in numerous other countries\noutperform their counterparts in the United States in\nreading); I.

And low educa-\ntional achievement continues to be correlated with income\nand race. See, e.g., National Center for Education Statis-\ntics, Digest of Education Statistics, Advance Release of\nSelected 2013 Digest Tables (Table 104.20) (White Ameri-\ncans more likely to have completed high school than\nAfrican-Americans or Hispanic-Americans), online at\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest (as visited Apr. 15,\n2014, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); id., Table\n219.75 (Americans in bottom quartile of income most\nlikely to drop out of high school); id., Table 302.60 (White\nAmericans more likely to enroll in college than African-\nAmericans or Hispanic-Americans); id., Table 302.30\n(middle- and high-income Americans more likely to enroll\nin college than low-income Americans).\n   The Constitution allows local, state, and national com-\nmunities to adopt narrowly tailored race-conscious pro-\ngrams designed to bring about greater inclusion and di-\nversity. But the Constitution foresees the ballot box, not\nthe courts, as the normal instrument for resolving differ-\nences and debates about the merits of these programs.\nCompare Parents Involved, 551 U. S., at 839 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting) (identifying studies showing the benefits of\nracially integrated education), with id., at 761\u2013763\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (identifying studies suggesting\nracially integrated schools may not confer educational\nbenefits). In short, the \u201cConstitution creates a democratic\npolitical system through which the people themselves\nmust together find answers\u201d to disagreements of this kind.\nId., at 862 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n   Third, cases such as Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385\n(1969), and Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458\nU. S. 457 (1982), reflect an important principle, namely,\nthat an individual\u2019s ability to participate meaningfully in\nthe political process should be independent of his race.\nAlthough racial minorities, like other political minorities,\n4                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwill not always succeed at the polls, they must have the\nsame opportunity as others to secure through the ballot\nbox policies that reflect their preferences. In my view,\nhowever, neither Hunter nor Seattle applies here. And the\nparties do not here suggest that the amendment violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause if not under the Hunter-\nSeattle doctrine.\n   Hunter and Seattle involved efforts to manipulate the\npolitical process in a way not here at issue. Both cases\ninvolved a restructuring of the political process that\nchanged the political level at which policies were enacted.\nIn Hunter, decisionmaking was moved from the elected\ncity council to the local electorate at large. 393 U. S., at\n389\u2013390. And in Seattle, decisionmaking by an elected\nschool board was replaced with decisionmaking by the\nstate legislature and electorate at large. 458 U. S., at 466.\n   This case, in contrast, does not involve a reordering of\nthe political process; it does not in fact involve the move-\nment of decisionmaking from one political level to another.\nRather, here, Michigan law delegated broad policymaking\nauthority to elected university boards, see Mich. Const.,\nArt. VIII, \u00a75, but those boards delegated admissions-\nrelated decisionmaking authority to unelected university\nfaculty members and administrators, see, e.g., Bylaws of\nUniv. of Mich. Bd. of Regents \u00a78.01; Mich. State Univ.\nBylaws of Bd. of Trustees, Preamble; Mich. State Univ.\nBylaws for Academic Governance \u00a74.4.3; Wayne State\nUniv. Stat. \u00a7\u00a72\u201334\u201309, 2\u201334\u201312. Although the boards\nunquestionably retained the power to set policy regarding\nrace-conscious     admissions,    see    post,   at    25\u201329\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting), in fact faculty members and\nadministrators set the race-conscious admissions policies\nin question.     (It is often true that elected bodies\u2014\nincluding, for example, school boards, city councils, and\nstate legislatures\u2014have the power to enact policies, but in\nfact delegate that power to administrators.) Although at\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlimited times the university boards were advised of the\ncontent of their race-conscious admissions policies, see 701\nF. 3d 466, 481\u2013482 (CA6 2012), to my knowledge no board\nvoted to accept or reject any of those policies. Thus, un-\nelected faculty members and administrators, not voters or\ntheir elected representatives, adopted the race-conscious\nadmissions programs affected by Michigan\u2019s constitutional\namendment. The amendment took decisionmaking au-\nthority away from these unelected actors and placed it in\nthe hands of the voters.\n   Why does this matter? For one thing, considered con-\nceptually, the doctrine set forth in Hunter and Seattle does\nnot easily fit this case. In those cases minorities had\nparticipated in the political process and they had won.\nThe majority\u2019s subsequent reordering of the political\nprocess repealed the minority\u2019s successes and made it\nmore difficult for the minority to succeed in the future.\nThe majority thereby diminished the minority\u2019s ability to\nparticipate meaningfully in the electoral process. But one\ncannot as easily characterize the movement of the deci-\nsionmaking mechanism at issue here\u2014from an adminis-\ntrative process to an electoral process\u2014as diminishing the\nminority\u2019s ability to participate meaningfully in the politi-\ncal process. There is no prior electoral process in which\nthe minority participated.\n   For another thing, to extend the holding of Hunter and\nSeattle to reach situations in which decisionmaking au-\nthority is moved from an administrative body to a political\none would pose significant difficulties. The administrative\nprocess encompasses vast numbers of decisionmakers\nanswering numerous policy questions in hosts of different\nfields. See Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Ac-\ncounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, ___ (2010) (BREYER,\nJ., dissenting). Administrative bodies modify programs in\ndetail, and decisionmaking authority within the adminis-\ntrative process frequently moves around\u2014due to amend-\n6                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nments to statutes, new administrative rules, and evolving\nagency practice. It is thus particularly difficult in this\ncontext for judges to determine when a change in the locus\nof decisionmaking authority places a comparative struc-\ntural burden on a racial minority. And to apply Hunter\nand Seattle to the administrative process would, by tend-\ning to hinder change, risk discouraging experimentation,\ninterfering with efforts to see when and how race-\nconscious policies work.\n   Finally, the principle that underlies Hunter and Seattle\nruns up against a competing principle, discussed above.\nThis competing principle favors decisionmaking through\nthe democratic process. Just as this principle strongly\nsupports the right of the people, or their elected repre-\nsentatives, to adopt race-conscious policies for reasons of\ninclusion, so must it give them the right to vote not to do\nso.\n   As I have said, my discussion here is limited to circum-\nstances in which decisionmaking is moved from an un-\nelected administrative body to a politically responsive one,\nand in which the targeted race-conscious admissions\nprograms consider race solely in order to obtain the educa-\ntional benefits of a diverse student body. We need now\ndecide no more than whether the Federal Constitution\npermits Michigan to apply its constitutional amendment\nin those circumstances. I would hold that it does. There-\nfore, I concur in the judgment of the Court.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

But\nwithout checks, democratically approved legislation can\noppress minority groups. For that reason, our Constitu-\ntion places limits on what a majority of the people may do.\nThis case implicates one such limit: the guarantee of equal\nprotection of the laws. Although that guarantee is tradi-\ntionally understood to prohibit intentional discrimination\nunder existing laws, equal protection does not end there.\nAnother fundamental strand of our equal protection juris-\nprudence focuses on process, securing to all citizens the\nright to participate meaningfully and equally in self-\ngovernment. That right is the bedrock of our democracy,\nfor it preserves all other rights.\n   Yet to know the history of our Nation is to understand\nits long and lamentable record of stymieing the right of\nracial minorities to participate in the political process. At\nfirst, the majority acted with an open, invidious purpose.\nNotwithstanding the command of the Fifteenth Amend-\nment, certain States shut racial minorities out of the\npolitical process altogether by withholding the right to\n2                        SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nvote. This Court intervened to preserve that right. The\nmajority tried again, replacing outright bans on voting\nwith literacy tests, good character requirements, poll\ntaxes, and gerrymandering. The Court was not fooled; it\ninvalidated those measures, too. The majority persisted.\nThis time, although it allowed the minority access to the\npolitical process, the majority changed the ground rules of\nthe process so as to make it more difficult for the minority,\nand the minority alone, to obtain policies designed to\nfoster racial integration. Although these political restruc-\nturings may not have been discriminatory in purpose, the\nCourt reaffirmed the right of minority members of our\nsociety to participate meaningfully and equally in the\npolitical process.\n  This case involves this last chapter of discrimination: A\nmajority of the Michigan electorate changed the basic\nrules of the political process in that State in a manner that\nuniquely disadvantaged racial minorities.1 Prior to the\nenactment of the constitutional initiative at issue here,\nall of the admissions policies of Michigan\u2019s public colleges\nand universities\u2014including race-sensitive admissions poli-\ncies2\u2014were in the hands of each institution\u2019s governing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 I of course do not mean to suggest that Michigan\u2019s voters acted with\n\nanything like the invidious intent, see n. 8, infra, of those who histori-\ncally stymied the rights of racial minorities. Contra, ante, at 18, n. 11\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). But like earlier chapters of\npolitical restructuring, the Michigan amendment at issue in this case\nchanged the rules of the political process to the disadvantage of minor-\nity members of our society.\n   2 Although the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d is commonly used to describe\n\ncolleges\u2019 and universities\u2019 use of race in crafting admissions policies, I\ninstead use the term \u201crace-sensitive admissions policies.\u201d Some com-\nprehend the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d as connoting intentional prefer-\nential treatment based on race alone\u2014for example, the use of a quota\nsystem, whereby a certain proportion of seats in an institution\u2019s incom-\ning class must be set aside for racial minorities; the use of a \u201cpoints\u201d\nsystem, whereby an institution accords a fixed numerical advantage to\nan applicant because of her race; or the admission of otherwise unquali-\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

The members of those boards are nominated by\npolitical parties and elected by the citizenry in statewide\nelections. After over a century of being shut out of Michi-\ngan\u2019s institutions of higher education, racial minorities in\nMichigan had succeeded in persuading the elected board\nrepresentatives to adopt admissions policies that took into\naccount the benefits of racial diversity. And this Court\ntwice blessed such efforts\u2014first in Regents of Univ. of Cal.\nv. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978), and again in Grutter v.\nBollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003), a case that itself concerned\na Michigan admissions policy.\n  In the wake of Grutter, some voters in Michigan set out\nto eliminate the use of race-sensitive admissions policies.\nThose voters were of course free to pursue this end in any\nnumber of ways. For example, they could have persuaded\nexisting board members to change their minds through\nindividual or grassroots lobbying efforts, or through gen-\neral public awareness campaigns. Or they could have\nmobilized efforts to vote uncooperative board members out\nof office, replacing them with members who would share\ntheir desire to abolish race-sensitive admissions policies.\nWhen this Court holds that the Constitution permits a\nparticular policy, nothing prevents a majority of a State\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfied students to an institution solely on account of their race. None of\nthis is an accurate description of the practices that public universities\nare permitted to adopt after this Court\u2019s decision in Grutter v. Bol\u00ad\nlinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003). There, we instructed that institutions of\nhigher education could consider race in admissions in only a very\nlimited way in an effort to create a diverse student body. To comport\nwith Grutter, colleges and universities must use race flexibly, id., at\n334, and must not maintain a quota, ibid. And even this limited\nsensitivity to race must be limited in time, id., at 341\u2013343, and must be\nemployed only after \u201cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-\nneutral alternatives,\u201d id., at 339. Grutter-compliant admissions plans,\nlike the ones in place at Michigan\u2019s institutions, are thus a far cry from\naffirmative action plans that confer preferential treatment intention-\nally and solely on the basis of race.\n4                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nvoters from choosing not to adopt that policy. Our system\nof government encourages\u2014and indeed, depends on\u2014that\ntype of democratic action.\n   But instead, the majority of Michigan voters changed\nthe rules in the middle of the game, reconfiguring the\nexisting political process in Michigan in a manner that\nburdened racial minorities. They did so in the 2006 elec-\ntion by amending the Michigan Constitution to enact Art.\nI, \u00a726, which provides in relevant part that Michigan\u2019s\npublic universities \u201cshall not discriminate against, or\ngrant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on\nthe basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in\nthe operation of public employment, public education, or\npublic contracting.\u201d\n   As a result of \u00a726, there are now two very different\nprocesses through which a Michigan citizen is permitted to\ninfluence the admissions policies of the State\u2019s universi-\nties: one for persons interested in race-sensitive admis-\nsions policies and one for everyone else. A citizen who is a\nUniversity of Michigan alumnus, for instance, can advo-\ncate for an admissions policy that considers an applicant\u2019s\nlegacy status by meeting individually with members of the\nBoard of Regents to convince them of her views, by joining\nwith other legacy parents to lobby the Board, or by voting\nfor and supporting Board candidates who share her posi-\ntion. The same options are available to a citizen who\nwants the Board to adopt admissions policies that consider\nathleticism, geography, area of study, and so on. The one\nand only policy a Michigan citizen may not seek through\nthis long-established process is a race-sensitive admissions\npolicy that considers race in an individualized manner\nwhen it is clear that race-neutral alternatives are not\nadequate to achieve diversity. For that policy alone, the\ncitizens of Michigan must undertake the daunting task of\namending the State Constitution.\n   Our precedents do not permit political restructurings\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

This\nCourt has held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not\ntolerate \u201ca political structure that treats all individuals as\nequals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in\nsuch a way as to place special burdens on the ability of\nminority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.\u201d Wash\u00ad\nington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, 467\n(1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such restruc-\nturing, the Court explained, \u201cis no more permissible than\ndenying [the minority] the [right to] vote, on an equal\nbasis with others.\u201d Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385, 391\n(1969). In those cases\u2014Hunter and Seattle\u2014the Court\nrecognized what is now known as the \u201cpolitical-process\ndoctrine\u201d: When the majority reconfigures the political\nprocess in a manner that burdens only a racial minority,\nthat alteration triggers strict judicial scrutiny.\n  Today, disregarding stare decisis, a majority of the\nCourt effectively discards those precedents. The plurality\ndoes so, it tells us, because the freedom actually secured\nby the Constitution is the freedom of self-government\u2014\nbecause the majority of Michigan citizens \u201cexercised their\nprivilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their demo-\ncratic power.\u201d Ante, at 15. It would be \u201cdemeaning to the\ndemocratic process,\u201d the plurality concludes, to disturb\nthat decision in any way. Ante, at 17. This logic embraces\nmajority rule without an important constitutional limit.\n  The plurality\u2019s decision fundamentally misunderstands\nthe nature of the injustice worked by \u00a726. This case is not,\nas the plurality imagines, about \u201cwho may resolve\u201d the\ndebate over the use of race in higher education admis-\nsions. Ante, at 18. I agree wholeheartedly that nothing\nvests the resolution of that debate exclusively in the courts\nor requires that we remove it from the reach of the elec-\ntorate. Rather, this case is about how the debate over the\nuse of race-sensitive admissions policies may be resolved,\n6                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncontra, ibid.\u2014that is, it must be resolved in constitution-\nally permissible ways. While our Constitution does not\nguarantee minority groups victory in the political process,\nit does guarantee them meaningful and equal access to\nthat process. It guarantees that the majority may not win\nby stacking the political process against minority groups\npermanently, forcing the minority alone to surmount\nunique obstacles in pursuit of its goals\u2014here, educational\ndiversity that cannot reasonably be accomplished through\nrace-neutral measures. Today, by permitting a majority of\nthe voters in Michigan to do what our Constitution forbids,\nthe Court ends the debate over race-sensitive admissions\npolicies in Michigan in a manner that contravenes consti-\ntutional protections long recognized in our precedents.\n   Like the plurality, I have faith that our citizenry will\ncontinue to learn from this Nation\u2019s regrettable history;\nthat it will strive to move beyond those injustices towards\na future of equality. And I, too, believe in the importance\nof public discourse on matters of public policy. But I part\nways with the plurality when it suggests that judicial\nintervention in this case \u201cimpede[s]\u201d rather than \u201cad-\nvance[s]\u201d the democratic process and the ultimate hope of\nequality.

But many\nStates ignored this promise. In addition to outright tactics\nof fraud, intimidation, and violence, there are countless\nexamples of States categorically denying to racial minori-\nties access to the political process. Consider Texas; there,\na 1923 statute prevented racial minorities from participat-\ning in primary elections. After this Court declared that\nstatute unconstitutional, Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536,\n540\u2013541 (1927), Texas responded by changing the rules.\nIt enacted a new statute that gave political parties them-\nselves the right to determine who could participate in\ntheir primaries. Predictably, the Democratic Party speci-\nfied that only white Democrats could participate in its\nprimaries. Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73, 81\u201382 (1932).\nThe Court invalidated that scheme, too. Id., at 89; see\nalso Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944); Terry v.\nAdams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953).\n   Some States were less direct. Oklahoma was one of\nmany that required all voters to pass a literacy test. But\nthe test did not apply equally to all voters. Under a\n\u201cgrandfather clause,\u201d voters were exempt if their grand-\nfathers had been voters or had served as soldiers before\n1866. This meant, of course, that black voters had to pass\nthe test, but many white voters did not. The Court held\nthe scheme unconstitutional. Guinn v. United States, 238\nU. S. 347 (1915). In response, Oklahoma changed the\nrules. It enacted a new statute under which all voters who\nwere qualified to vote in 1914 (under the unconstitutional\ngrandfather clause) remained qualified, and the remaining\nvoters had to apply for registration within a 12-day period.\nLane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, 270\u2013271 (1939). The Court\nstruck down that statute as well. Id., at 275.\n   Racial minorities were occasionally able to surmount the\nhurdles to their political participation. Indeed, in some\n8                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nStates, minority citizens were even able to win elective\noffice. But just as many States responded to the Fifteenth\nAmendment by subverting minorities\u2019 access to the polls,\nmany States responded to the prospect of elected minority\nofficials by undermining the ability of minorities to win\nand hold elective office. Some States blatantly removed\nblack officials from local offices. See, e.g., H. Rabinowitz,\nRace Relations in the Urban South, 1865\u20131890, pp. 267,\n269\u2013270 (1978) (describing events in Tennessee and Vir-\nginia). Others changed the processes by which local offi-\ncials were elected. See, e.g., Extension of the Voting\nRights Act, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Civil\nand Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the\nJudiciary, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, pp. 2016\u20132017\n(1981) (hereinafter 1981 Hearings) (statement of Professor\nJ.

In Alabama, for exam-\nple, the legislature responded to increased black voter\nregistration in the city of Tuskegee by amending the State\nConstitution to authorize legislative abolition of the county\nin which Tuskegee was located, Ala.

In Virginia, the General Assembly transferred con-\ntrol of student assignment from local school districts to a\nState Pupil Placement Board. See B. Muse, Virginia\u2019s\nMassive Resistance 34, 74 (1961). And when the legisla-\nture learned that the Arlington County school board had\nprepared a desegregation plan, the General Assembly\n\u201cswiftly retaliated\u201d by stripping the county of its right to\nelect its school board by popular vote and instead making\nthe board an appointed body.

Many\nStates tried to suppress the political voice of racial minori-\nties more generally by reconfiguring the manner in which\nthey filled vacancies in local offices, often transferring\nauthority from the electorate (where minority citizens had\na voice at the local level) to the States\u2019 executive branch\n(where minorities wielded little if any influence).

As early\nas 1963, Seattle\u2019s School District No. 1 began taking steps\nto cure the de facto racial segregation in its schools. 458\nU. S., at 460\u2013461. Among other measures, it enacted a\ndesegregation plan that made extensive use of busing and\nmandatory assignments. Id., at 461. The district was\nunder no obligation to adopt the plan; Brown charged\nschool boards with a duty to integrate schools that were\nsegregated because of de jure racial discrimination, but\nthere had been no finding that the de facto segregation in\nSeattle\u2019s schools was the product of de jure discrimination.\n458 U.

It drafted a statewide initia-\ntive \u201cdesigned to terminate the use of mandatory busing\nfor purposes of racial integration.\u201d Id., at 462. A major-\nity of the State\u2019s citizens approved the initiative. Id., at\n463\u2013464.\n   The Court invalidated the initiative under the Equal\nProtection Clause. It began by observing that equal pro-\ntection of the laws \u201cguarantees racial minorities the right\nto full participation in the political life of the community.\u201d\nId., at 467. \u201cIt is beyond dispute,\u201d the Court explained,\n\u201cthat given racial or ethnic groups may not be denied the\nfranchise, or precluded from entering into the political\nprocess in a reliable and meaningful manner.\u201d Ibid. But\nthe Equal Protection Clause reaches further, the Court\nstated, reaffirming the principle espoused in Hunter\u2014that\nwhile \u201claws structuring political institutions or allocating\npolitical power according to neutral principles\u201d do not\nviolate the Constitution, \u201ca different analysis is required\nwhen the State allocates governmental power nonneutrally,\nby explicitly using the racial nature of a decision to de-\ntermine the decisionmaking process.\u201d 458 U. S., at 470.\nThat kind of state action, it observed, \u201cplaces special bur-\ndens on racial minorities within the governmental pro-\ncess,\u201d by making it \u201cmore difficult for certain racial and\nreligious minorities\u201d than for other members of the com-\nmunity \u201cto achieve legislation . . . in their interest.\u201d Ibid.\n   Rejecting the argument that the initiative had no racial\nfocus, the Court found that the desegregation of public\nschools, like the Akron housing ordinance, \u201cinure[d] pri-\nmarily to the benefit of the minority, and [was] designed\nfor that purpose.\u201d Id., at 472. Because minorities had\ngood reason to \u201cconsider busing for integration to be \u2018legis-\nlation that is in their interest,\u2019 \u201d the Court concluded that\nthe \u201cracial focus of [the initiative] . . . suffice[d] to trigger\napplication of the Hunter doctrine.\u201d Id., at 474 (quoting\nHunter, 393 U. S., at 395) (Harlan, J. concurring)).\n14                        SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court next concluded that \u201cthe practical effect of\n[the initiative was] to work a reallocation of power of the\nkind condemned in Hunter.\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S., at 474. It\nexplained: \u201cThose favoring the elimination of de facto\nschool segregation now must seek relief from the state\nlegislature, or from the statewide electorate. Yet authority\nover all other student assignment decisions, as well as\nover most other areas of educational policy, remains vested\nin the local school board.\u201d Ibid. Thus, the initiative re-\nquired those in favor of racial integration in public schools\nto \u201csurmount a considerably higher hurdle than persons\nseeking comparable legislative action\u201d in different con-\ntexts. Ibid.\n   The Court reaffirmed that the \u201c \u2018simple repeal or modifi-\ncation of desegregation or antidiscrimination laws, without\nmore, never has been viewed as embodying a presump-\ntively invalid racial classification.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 483 (quoting\nCrawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles, 458 U. S. 527,\n539 (1982)). But because the initiative burdened future\nattempts to integrate by lodging the decisionmaking au-\nthority at a \u201cnew and remote level of government,\u201d it was\nmore than a \u201cmere repeal\u201d; it was an unconstitutionally\ndiscriminatory change to the political process.3 Seattle,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In Crawford, the Court confronted an amendment to the California\n\nConstitution prohibiting state courts from mandating pupil assign-\nments unless a federal court would be required to do so under the\nEqual Protection Clause. We upheld the amendment as nothing more\nthan a repeal of existing legislation: The standard previously required\nby California went beyond what was federally required; the amendment\nmerely moved the standard back to the federal baseline. The Court\ndistinguished the amendment from the one in Seattle because it left the\nrules of the political game unchanged. Racial minorities in Crawford,\nunlike racial minorities in Seattle, could still appeal to their local school\ndistricts for relief.\n  The Crawford Court distinguished Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385\n(1969), by clarifying that the charter amendment in Hunter was \u201csome-\nthing more than a mere repeal\u201d because it altered the framework of the\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

S., at 483\u2013484.\n                              B\n   Hunter and Seattle vindicated a principle that is as\nelementary to our equal protection jurisprudence as it is\nessential: The majority may not suppress the minority\u2019s\nright to participate on equal terms in the political process.\nUnder this doctrine, governmental action deprives minor-\nity groups of equal protection when it (1) has a racial focus,\ntargeting a policy or program that \u201cinures primarily to the\nbenefit of the minority,\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S., at 472; and\n(2) alters the political process in a manner that uniquely\nburdens racial minorities\u2019 ability to achieve their goals\nthrough that process. A faithful application of the doc-\ntrine resoundingly resolves this case in respondents\u2019 favor.\n                              1\n   Section 26 has a \u201cracial focus.\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S., at\n474. That is clear from its text, which prohibits Michi-\ngan\u2019s public colleges and universities from \u201cgrant[ing]\npreferential treatment to any individual or group on the\nbasis of race.\u201d Mich. Const., Art. I, \u00a726. Like desegrega-\ntion of public schools, race-sensitive admissions policies\n\u201cinur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority,\u201d 458\nU.

And the Seattle Court drew the\nsame distinction when it held that the initiative \u201cwork[ed] something\nmore than the \u2018mere repeal\u2019 of a desegregation law by the political\nentity that created it.\u201d 458 U. S., at 483.\n  4 JUSTICE SCALIA accuses me of crafting my own version (or versions)\n\nof the racial-focus prong. See ante, at 8\u20139, n. 4 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). I do not. I simply apply the test announced in Seattle:\nwhether the policy in question \u201cinures primarily to the benefit of the\nminority.\u201d 458 U. S., at 472. JUSTICE SCALIA ignores this analysis, see\nPart II\u2013B\u20131, supra, and instead purports to identify three versions of\nthe test that he thinks my opinion advances. The first\u2014whether \u201c \u2018the\npolicy in question benefits only a racial minority, \u2019 \u201d ante, at 8, n. 4\n16                       SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Petitioner argues that race-sensitive admissions policies\ncannot \u201cinur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority,\u201d\nibid., as the Court has upheld such policies only insofar as\nthey further \u201cthe educational benefits that flow from a\ndiverse student body,\u201d Grutter, 539 U. S., at 343. But\nthere is no conflict between this Court\u2019s pronouncement in\nGrutter and the common-sense reality that race-sensitive\nadmissions policies benefit minorities.       Rather, race-\nsensitive admissions policies further a compelling state\ninterest in achieving a diverse student body precisely\nbecause they increase minority enrollment, which neces-\nsarily benefits minority groups. In other words, constitu-\ntionally permissible race-sensitive admissions policies can\nboth serve the compelling interest of obtaining the educa-\ntional benefits that flow from a diverse student body, and\ninure to the benefit of racial minorities. There is nothing\nmutually exclusive about the two. Cf. Seattle, 458 U. S., at\n472 (concluding that the desegregation plan had a racial\nfocus even though \u201cwhite as well as Negro children bene-\nfit from exposure to \u2018ethnic and racial diversity in the\nclassroom\u2019 \u201d).\n   It is worth emphasizing, moreover, that \u00a726 is relevant\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(quoting supra, at 5)\u2014misunderstands the doctrine and misquotes my\nopinion. The racial-focus prong has never required a policy to benefit\nonly a minority group. The sentence from which JUSTICE SCALIA\nappears to quote makes the altogether different point that the political-\nprocess doctrine is obviously not implicated in the first place by a\nrestructuring that burdens members of society equally. This is the\nsecond prong of the political-process doctrine. See supra, at 5 (explain-\ning that the political-process doctrine is implicated \u201c[w]hen the majority\nreconfigures the political process in a manner that burdens only a\nracial minority\u201d). The second version\u2014which asks whether a policy\n\u201cbenefits primarily a racial minority,\u201d ante, at 8, n. 4\u2014is the one\narticulated by the Seattle Court and, as I have explained, see supra, at\n15 and this page, it is easily met in this case. And the third\u2014whether\nthe policy has \u201cthe incidental effect\u201d of benefitting racial minorities,\u201d\nante, at 8\u20139, n. 4\u2014is not a test I advance at all.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

A Grutter-\ncompliant admissions policy must use race flexibly, not\nmaintain a quota; must be limited in time; and must be\nemployed only after \u201cserious, good faith consideration of\nworkable race-neutral alternatives,\u201d 539 U. S., at 339.\nThe policies banned by \u00a726 meet all these requirements\nand thus already constitute the least restrictive ways to\nadvance Michigan\u2019s compelling interest in diversity in\nhigher education.\n                               2\n   Section 26 restructures the political process in Michigan\nin a manner that places unique burdens on racial minori-\nties. It establishes a distinct and more burdensome politi-\ncal process for the enactment of admissions plans that\nconsider racial diversity.\n   Long before the enactment of \u00a726, the Michigan Consti-\ntution granted plenary authority over all matters relating\nto Michigan\u2019s public universities, including admissions\ncriteria, to each university\u2019s eight-member governing\nboard.

Prior to \u00a726, board candidates frequently included\ntheir views on race-sensitive admissions in their cam-\npaigns. For example, in 2005, one candidate pledged to\n\u201cwork to end so-called \u2018Affirmative-Action,\u2019 a racist, de-\ngrading system.\u201d See League of Women Voters, 2005\nGeneral Election Voter Guide, online at http://\nwww.lwvka.org/guide04/regents/html (all Internet materi-\nals as visited Apr. 18, 2014, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file); see also George, U-M Regents Race Tests\nPolicy, Detroit Free Press, Oct. 26, 2000, p. 2B (noting that\none candidate \u201copposes affirmative action admissions\npolicies\u201d because they \u201c \u2018basically sa[y] minority students\nare not qualified\u2019 \u201d).\n   Before the enactment of \u00a726, Michigan\u2019s political struc-\nture permitted both supporters and opponents of race-\nsensitive admissions policies to vote for their candidates of\nchoice and to lobby the elected and politically accountable\nboards.

While substantially less\ngrueling paths remain open to those advocating for any\nother admissions policies, a constitutional amendment is\nthe only avenue by which race-sensitive admissions poli-\ncies may be obtained. The effect of \u00a726 is that a white\ngraduate of a public Michigan university who wishes to\npass his historical privilege on to his children may freely\nlobby the board of that university in favor of an expanded\nlegacy admissions policy, whereas a black Michigander\nwho was denied the opportunity to attend that very uni-\nversity cannot lobby the board in favor of a policy that\nmight give his children a chance that he never had and\nthat they might never have absent that policy.\n   Such reordering of the political process contravenes\nHunter and Seattle.7 See Seattle, 458 U. S., at 467 (the\nEqual Protection Clause prohibits \u201c \u2018a political structure\nthat treats all individuals as equals,\u2019 yet more subtly\ndistorts governmental processes in such a way as to place\nspecial burdens on the ability of minority groups to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSCALIA overlooks the fact that minorities need not elect any new board\nmembers in order to effect change; they may instead seek to persuade\nexisting board members to adopt changes in their interests.\n   7 I do not take the position, as JUSTICE SCALIA asserts, that the pro-\n\ncess of amending the Michigan Constitution is not a part of Michigan\u2019s\nexisting political process.

Where,\nas here, the majority alters the political process to the\ndetriment of a racial minority, the governmental action is\nsubject to strict scrutiny. See id., at 485, n. 28. Michigan\ndoes not assert that \u00a726 satisfies a compelling state inter-\nest. That should settle the matter.\n                               C\n                               1\n   The plurality sees it differently. Disregarding the lan-\nguage used in Hunter, the plurality asks us to contort that\ncase into one that \u201crests on the unremarkable principle\nthat the State may not alter the procedures of government\nto target racial minorities.\u201d Ante, at 8. And the plurality\nrecasts Seattle \u201cas a case in which the state action in\nquestion . . . had the serious risk, if not purpose, of causing\nspecific injuries on account of race.\u201d Ante, at 8\u20139. Accord-\ning to the plurality, the Hunter and Seattle Courts were\nnot concerned with efforts to reconfigure the political\nprocess to the detriment of racial minorities; rather, those\ncases invalidated governmental actions merely because\nthey reflected an invidious purpose to discriminate. This\nis not a tenable reading of those cases.\n   The plurality identifies \u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d as the\n\u201cnecessary result\u201d of the restructuring in Hunter. Ante, at\n8. It is impossible to assess whether the housing amend-\nment in Hunter was motivated by discriminatory purpose,\nfor the opinion does not discuss the question of intent.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 It certainly is fair to assume that some voters may have supported\n\nthe Hunter amendment because of discriminatory animus. But others\nmay have been motivated by their strong beliefs in the freedom of\ncontract or the freedom to alienate property. Similarly, here, although\nsome Michiganders may have voted for \u00a726 out of racial animus, some\nmay have been acting on a personal belief, like that of some of my\ncolleagues today, that using race-sensitive admissions policies in higher\neducation is unwise. The presence (or absence) of invidious discrimina-\ntion has no place in the current analysis. That is the very purpose of\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

The Hunter Court was clear about why\nit invalidated the Akron charter amendment: It was im-\npermissible as a restructuring of the political process, not\nas an action motivated by discriminatory intent. See 393\nU. S., at 391 (striking down the Akron charter amendment\nbecause it \u201cplaces a special burden on racial minorities\nwithin the governmental process\u201d).\n   Similarly, the plurality disregards what Seattle actually\nsays and instead opines that \u201cthe political restriction in\nquestion was designed to be used, or was likely to be used,\nto encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.\u201d Ante,\nat 17. Here, the plurality derives its conclusion not from\nSeattle itself, but from evidence unearthed more than a\nquarter-century later in Parents Involved in Community\nSchools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701 (2007):\n\u201cAlthough there had been no judicial finding of de jure\nsegregation with respect to Seattle\u2019s school district, it\nappears as though school desegregation in the district in\nthe 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s may have been the partial result of\nschool board policies that \u2018permitted white students to\ntransfer out of black schools while restricting the transfer\nof black students into white schools.\u2019 \u201d9 Ante, at 9 (quoting\nParents Involved, 551 U. S., at 807\u2013808 (BREYER, J., dis-\nsenting) (emphasis added). It follows, according to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe political-process doctrine; it operates irrespective of discriminatory\nintent, for it protects a process-based right.\n  9 The plurality relies on JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s dissent in Parents Involved\n\nto conclude that \u201cone permissible reading of the record was that the\nschool board had maintained policies to perpetuate racial segregation\nin the schools.\u201d Ante, at 9\u201310. Remarkably, some Members of today\u2019s\nplurality criticized JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s reading of the record in Parents\nInvolved itself. See 551 U. S., at 736.\n24                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nplurality, that Seattle\u2019s desegregation plan was constitu-\ntionally required, so that the initiative halting the plan\nwas an instance of invidious discrimination aimed at\ninflicting a racial injury.\n   Again, the plurality might prefer that the Seattle Court\nhad said that, but it plainly did not. Not once did the\nCourt suggest the presence of de jure segregation in Seat-\ntle. Quite the opposite: The opinion explicitly suggested\nthe desegregation plan was adopted to remedy de facto\nrather than de jure segregation. See 458 U. S., at 472,\nn. 15 (referring to the \u201cabsen[ce]\u201d of \u201ca finding of prior de\njure segregation\u201d). The Court, moreover, assumed that no\n\u201cconstitutional violation\u201d through de jure segregation had\noccurred. Id., at 474. And it unmistakably rested its\ndecision on Hunter, holding Seattle\u2019s initiative invalid\nbecause it \u201cuse[d] the racial nature of an issue to define\nthe governmental decisionmaking structure, and thus\nimpose[d] substantial and unique burdens on racial minor-\nities.\u201d 458 U. S., at 470.\n   It is nothing short of baffling, then, for the plurality to\ninsist\u2014in the face of clear language in Hunter and Seattle\nsaying otherwise\u2014that those cases were about nothing\nmore than the intentional and invidious infliction of a\nracial injury. Ante, at 8 (describing the injury in Hunter\nas \u201ca demonstrated injury on the basis of race\u201d); ante, at\n8\u20139 (describing the injury in Seattle as an \u201cinjur[y] on\naccount of race\u201d). The plurality\u2019s attempt to rewrite\nHunter and Seattle so as to cast aside the political-process\ndoctrine sub silentio is impermissible as a matter of stare\ndecisis. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, we usually\nstand by our decisions, even if we disagree with them,\nbecause people rely on what we say, and they believe they\ncan take us at our word.\n   And what now of the political-process doctrine? After\nthe plurality\u2019s revision of Hunter and Seattle, it is unclear\nwhat is left. The plurality certainly does not tell us. On\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

See ante, at 5\u20137 (opinion concurring\nin judgment).\n                               2\n   JUSTICE BREYER concludes that Hunter and Seattle do\nnot apply. Section 26, he reasons, did not move the rele-\nvant decisionmaking authority from one political level to\nanother; rather, it removed that authority from \u201cunelected\nactors and placed it in the hands of the voters.\u201d Ante, at 5\n(opinion concurring in judgment). He bases this conclu-\nsion on the premise that Michigan\u2019s elected boards \u201cdele-\ngated admissions-related decisionmaking authority to\nunelected university faculty members and administra-\ntors.\u201d Ibid. But this premise is simply incorrect.\n   For one thing, it is undeniable that prior to \u00a726, board\ncandidates often pledged to end or carry on the use of race-\nsensitive admissions policies at Michigan\u2019s public univer-\nsities. See supra, at 18. Surely those were not empty\npromises. Indeed, the issue of race-sensitive admissions\npolicies often dominated board elections. See, e.g., George,\nDetroit Free Press, at 2B (observing that \u201c[t]he race for\nthe University of Michigan Board of Regents could deter-\nmine . . . the future of [the University\u2019s] affirmative action\npolicies\u201d); Kosseff, UM Policy May Hang On Election,\nCrain\u2019s Detroit Business, Sept. 18, 2000, p. 1 (noting that\nan upcoming election could determine whether the Uni-\nversity would continue to defend its affirmative action\npolicies); University of Michigan\u2019s Admissions Policy Still\nan Issue for Regents\u2019 Election, Black Issues in Higher\nEducation, Oct. 21, 2004, p. 17 (commenting that although\n\u201cthe Supreme Court struck down the University of Michi-\ngan\u2019s undergraduate admissions policy as too formulaic,\u201d\nthe issue \u201cremains an important [one] to several peo-\nple running\u201d in an upcoming election for the Board of\n26                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nRegents).\n  Moreover, a careful examination of the boards and their\ngoverning structure reveals that they remain actively\ninvolved in setting admissions policies and procedures.\nTake Wayne State University, for example. Its Board of\nGovernors has enacted university statutes that govern the\nday-to-day running of the institution. See Wayne State\nUniv. Stat., online at http://bog.wayne.edu/code. A num-\nber of those statutes establish general admissions proce-\ndures, see \u00a72.34.09 (establishing undergraduate admis-\nsions procedures); \u00a72.34.12 (establishing graduate\nadmissions procedures), and some set out more specific\ninstructions for university officials, see, e.g., \u00a72.34.09.030\n(\u201cAdmissions decisions will be based on a full evaluation of\neach student\u2019s academic record, and on empirical data\nreflecting the characteristics of students who have suc-\ncessfully graduated from [the university] within the four\nyears prior to the year in which the student applies\u201d);\n\u00a7\u00a72.34.12.080, 2.34.12.090 (setting the requisite grade\npoint average for graduate applicants).\n  The Board of Governors does give primary responsibility\nover day-to-day admissions matters to the university\u2019s\nPresident. \u00a72.34.09.080.

And\nwhile university officials and faculty members \u201cserv[e] an\nimportant advisory role in recommending educational\npolicy,\u201d id., at 14, the Board alone ultimately controls\neducational policy and decides whether to adopt (or reject)\nprogram-specific admissions recommendations. For ex-\nample, the Board has voted on recommendations \u201cto revise\nguidelines for establishment of honors curricula, including\nadmissions criteria\u201d; \u201cto modify the honor point criteria for\ngraduate admission\u201d; and \u201cto modify the maximum num-\nber of transfer credits that the university would allow in\ncertain cases where articulation agreements rendered\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

The Board also \u201cengages in\nrobust and regular review of administrative actions in-\nvolving admissions policy and related matters.\u201d Id., at 16.\n   Other public universities more clearly entrust admis-\nsions policy to university officials. The Board of Regents\nof the University of Michigan, for example, gives primary\nresponsibility for admissions to the Associate Vice Provost,\nExecutive Director of Undergraduate Admissions, and\nDirectors of Admissions. Bylaws \u00a78.01, online at http://\nwww.regents.umich.edu/bylaws. And the Board of Trus-\ntees of Michigan State University relies on the President\nto make recommendations regarding admissions policies.\nBylaws, Art. 8, online at http://www.trustees.msu.edu/\nbylaws. But the bylaws of the Board of Regents and the\nBoard of Trustees \u201cmake clear that all university opera-\ntions remain subject to their control.\u201d Brief for Respond-\nents Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of\nTrustees of Michigan State University et al. 13\u201314.\n   The boards retain ultimate authority to adopt or reject\nadmissions policies in at least three ways. First, they\nroutinely meet with university officials to review admis-\nsions policies, including race-sensitive admissions policies.\nFor example, shortly after this Court\u2019s decisions in Gratz\nv. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244 (2003), and Grutter, 539 U. S.,\nat 306, the President of the University of Michigan ap-\npeared before the University\u2019s Board of Regents to discuss\nthe impact of those decisions on the University. See\nProceedings 2003\u20132004, pp. 10\u201312 (July 2003), online\nat http://name.umdl.umich.edu/ACW7513.2003.001. Six\nmembers of the Board voiced strong support for the Uni-\nversity\u2019s use of race as a factor in admissions. Id., at 11\u2013\n12. In June 2004, the President again appeared before the\n28                      SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nBoard to discuss changes to undergraduate admissions\npolicies. Id., at 301 (June 2004). And in March 2007, the\nUniversity\u2019s Provost appeared before the Board of Regents\nto present strategies to increase diversity in light of the\npassage of Proposal 2. Proceedings 2006\u20132007, pp. 264\u2013\n265 (Mar. 2007), online at http://name.umdl.umich.edu/\nACW7513.2006.001.\n  Second, the boards may enact bylaws with respect to\nspecific admissions policies and may alter any admissions\npolicies set by university officials. The Board of Regents\nmay amend any bylaw \u201cat any regular meeting of the\nboard, or at any special meeting, provided notice is given\nto each regent one week in advance.\u201d Bylaws \u00a714.03.

The boards may\nalso permanently remove certain admissions decisions\nfrom university officials.10 This authority is not merely\ntheoretical. Between 2008 and 2012, the University of\nMichigan\u2019s Board of Regents \u201crevised more than two dozen\nof its bylaws, two of which fall within Chapter VIII, the\nsection regulating admissions practices.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 30a.\n  Finally, the boards may appoint university officials who\nshare their admissions goals, and they may remove those\nofficials if the officials\u2019 goals diverge from those of the\nboards.

Brief for Respondents Re-\ngents of the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees\nof Michigan State University et al. 14.\n   The salient point is this: Although the elected and polit-\nically accountable boards may well entrust university\nofficials with certain day-to-day admissions responsibili-\nties, they often weigh in on admissions policies themselves\nand, at all times, they retain complete supervisory author-\nity over university officials and over all admissions\ndecisions.\n   There is no question, then, that the elected boards in\nMichigan had the power to eliminate or adopt race-\nsensitive admissions policies prior to \u00a726. There is also no\nquestion that \u00a726 worked an impermissible reordering of\nthe political process; it removed that power from the elected\nboards and placed it instead at a higher level of the\npolitical process in Michigan. See supra, at 17\u201322. This\ncase is no different from Hunter and Seattle in that re-\nspect. Just as in Hunter and Seattle, minorities in Michi-\ngan \u201cparticipated in the political process and won.\u201d Ante,\nat 5 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). And just as in\nHunter and Seattle, \u201cthe majority\u2019s subsequent reordering\nof the political process repealed the minority\u2019s successes\nand made it more difficult for the minority to succeed in\nthe future,\u201d thereby \u201cdiminish[ing] the minority\u2019s ability to\nparticipate meaningfully in the electoral process.\u201d Ibid.\nThere is therefore no need to consider \u201cextend[ing] the\nholding of Hunter and Seattle to reach situations in which\ndecisionmaking authority is moved from an administrative\nbody to a political one,\u201d ibid. Such a scenario is not be-\nfore us.\n                              III\n  The political-process doctrine not only resolves this case\nas a matter of stare decisis; it is correct as a matter of first\n30                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nprinciples.\n                                A\n   Under our Constitution, majority rule is not without\nlimit. Our system of government is predicated on an\nequilibrium between the notion that a majority of citizens\nmay determine governmental policy through legislation\nenacted by their elected representatives, and the overrid-\ning principle that there are nonetheless some things the\nConstitution forbids even a majority of citizens to do. The\npolitical-process doctrine, grounded in the Fourteenth\nAmendment, is a central check on majority rule.\n   The Fourteenth Amendment instructs that all who act\nfor the government may not \u201cdeny to any person . . . the\nequal protection of the laws.\u201d We often think of equal\nprotection as a guarantee that the government will apply\nthe law in an equal fashion\u2014that it will not intentionally\ndiscriminate against minority groups. But equal protec-\ntion of the laws means more than that; it also secures the\nright of all citizens to participate meaningfully and equally\nin the process through which laws are created.\n   Few rights are as fundamental as the right to partici-\npate meaningfully and equally in the process of govern-\nment. See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 370 (1886)\n(political rights are \u201cfundamental\u201d because they are \u201cpre-\nservative of all rights\u201d). That right is the bedrock of our\ndemocracy, recognized from its very inception. See J. Ely,\nDemocracy and Distrust 87 (1980) (the Constitution \u201cis\noverwhelmingly concerned, on the one hand, with proce-\ndural fairness in the resolution of individual disputes,\u201d\nand on the other, \u201cwith ensuring broad participation in the\nprocesses and distributions of government\u201d).\n   This should come as no surprise. The political process is\nthe channel of change. Id., at 103 (describing the im-\nportance of the judiciary in policing the \u201cchannels of politi-\ncal change\u201d). It is the means by which citizens may both\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Of course, we do not expect minority members of our\nsociety to obtain every single result they seek through the\npolitical process\u2014not, at least, when their views conflict\nwith those of the majority. The minority plainly does not\nhave a right to prevail over majority groups in any given\npolitical contest. But the minority does have a right to\nplay by the same rules as the majority. It is this right\nthat Hunter and Seattle so boldly vindicated.\n   This right was hardly novel at the time of Hunter and\nSeattle. For example, this Court focused on the vital\nimportance of safeguarding minority groups\u2019 access to the\npolitical process in United States v. Carolene Products Co.,\n304 U. S. 144 (1938), a case that predated Hunter by 30\nyears. In a now-famous footnote, the Court explained that\nwhile ordinary social and economic legislation carries a\npresumption of constitutionality, the same may not be\ntrue of legislation that offends fundamental rights or\ntargets minority groups.        Citing cases involving re-\nstrictions on the right to vote, restraints on the dissemina-\ntion of information, interferences with political organiza-\ntions, and prohibition of peaceable assembly, the Court\nrecognized that \u201clegislation which restricts those political\nprocesses which can ordinarily be expected to bring about\nrepeal of undesirable legislation\u201d could be worthy of \u201cmore\nexacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment than are most other types of\nlegislation.\u201d Id., at 152, n. 4; see also Ely, supra, at 76\n(explaining that \u201c[p]aragraph two [of Carolene Products\nfootnote 4] suggests that it is an appropriate function of\nthe Court to keep the machinery of democratic govern-\nment running as it should, to make sure the channels of\npolitical participation and communication are kept open\u201d).\nThe Court also noted that \u201cprejudice against discrete and\ninsular minorities may be a special condition, which tends\nseriously to curtail the operation of those political pro-\n32                      SCHUETTE v.

S., at 153,\nn. 4, see also Ely, supra, at 76 (explaining that\n\u201c[p]aragraph three [of Carolene Products footnote 4] sug-\ngests that the Court should also concern itself with what\nmajorities do to minorities, particularly mentioning laws\n\u2018directed at\u2019 religious, national and racial minorities and\nthose infected by prejudice against them\u201d).\n   The values identified in Carolene Products lie at the\nheart of the political-process doctrine. Indeed, Seattle\nexplicitly relied on Carolene Products. See 458 U. S., at\n486 (\u201c[W]hen the State\u2019s allocation of power places unusual\nburdens on the ability of racial groups to enact legisla-\ntion specifically designed to overcome the \u2018special condi-\ntion\u2019 of prejudice, the governmental action seriously\n\u2018curtail[s] the operation of those political processes ordi-\nnarily to be relied upon to protect minorities\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nCarolene Products, 304 U. S., at 153, n. 4)). These values\nare central tenets of our equal protection jurisprudence.\n   Our cases recognize at least three features of the right\nto meaningful participation in the political process. Two\nof them, thankfully, are uncontroversial. First, every\neligible citizen has a right to vote. See Shaw v. Reno, 509\nU. S. 630, 639 (1993). This, woefully, has not always been\nthe case. But it is a right no one would take issue with\ntoday. Second, the majority may not make it more diffi-\ncult for the minority to exercise the right to vote. This,\ntoo, is widely accepted. After all, the Court has invalidat-\ned grandfather clauses, good character requirements, poll\ntaxes, and gerrymandering provisions.11 The third fea-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Attempts by the majority to make it more difficult for the minority\n\nto exercise its right to vote are, sadly, not a thing of the past. See\nShelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 15\u201317)\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (describing recent examples of discriminatory\nchanges to state voting laws, including a 1995 dual voter registration\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

This is the political-\nprocess doctrine of Hunter and Seattle.\n   My colleagues would stop at the second. The plurality\nembraces the freedom of \u201cself-government\u201d without limits.\nSee ante, at 13. And JUSTICE SCALIA values a \u201cnear-\nlimitless\u201d notion of state sovereignty.

The wrong sought to be\ncorrected by the political-process doctrine, they say, is not\none that should concern us and is in any event beyond the\nreach of the Fourteenth Amendment. As they see it, the\nCourt\u2019s role in protecting the political process ends once\nwe have removed certain barriers to the minority\u2019s partic-\nipation in that process. Then, they say, we must sit back\nand let the majority rule without the key constitutional\nlimit recognized in Hunter and Seattle.\n   That view drains the Fourteenth Amendment of one of\nits core teachings. Contrary to today\u2019s decision, protecting\nthe right to meaningful participation in the political pro-\ncess must mean more than simply removing barriers to\nparticipation. It must mean vigilantly policing the politi-\ncal process to ensure that the majority does not use other\nmethods to prevent minority groups from partaking in\nthat process on equal footing. Why? For the same reason\nwe guard the right of every citizen to vote.

For as the Court recognized in\nSeattle, \u201cminorities are no less powerless with the vote\nthan without it when a racial criterion is used to assign\ngovernmental power in such a way as to exclude particular\nracial groups \u2018from effective participation in the political\nproces[s].\u2019 \u201d12 458 U.

This is entirely at odds with our idea of equality\nunder the law.\n  To reiterate, none of this is to say that the political-\nprocess doctrine prohibits the exercise of democratic self-\ngovernment.

See ante, at 16\u201317. They were free to elect\ngoverning boards that opposed race-sensitive admissions\npolicies or, through public discourse and dialogue, to lobby\nthe existing boards toward that end. They were also free\nto remove from the boards the authority to make any\ndecisions with respect to admissions policies, as opposed to\nonly decisions concerning race-sensitive admissions poli-\ncies. But what the majority could not do, consistent with\nthe Constitution, is change the ground rules of the politi-\ncal process in a manner that makes it more difficult for\nracial minorities alone to achieve their goals. In doing so,\nthe majority effectively rigs the contest to guarantee a\nparticular outcome. That is the very wrong the political-\nprocess doctrine seeks to remedy.

S. 399 (2006)\n(LULAC).\n   Romer involved a Colorado constitutional amendment\nthat removed from the local political process an issue\nprimarily affecting gay and lesbian citizens. The amend-\nment, enacted in response to a number of local ordinances\nprohibiting discrimination against gay citizens, repealed\nthese ordinances and effectively prohibited the adoption of\nsimilar ordinances in the future without another amend-\nment to the State Constitution. 517 U. S., at 623\u2013624.\nAlthough the Court did not apply the political-process\ndoctrine in Romer,13 the case resonates with the principles\nundergirding the political-process doctrine. The Court\nrejected an attempt by the majority to transfer decision-\nmaking authority from localities (where the targeted\nminority group could influence the process) to state gov-\nernment (where it had less ability to participate effec-\ntively). See id., at 632 (describing this type of political\nrestructuring as a \u201cdisability\u201d on the minority group).\nRather than being able to appeal to municipalities for\npolicy changes, the Court commented, the minority was\nforced to \u201cenlis[t] the citizenry of Colorado to amend the\nState Constitution,\u201d id., at 631\u2014just as in this case.\n   LULAC, a Voting Rights Act case, involved an enact-\nment by the Texas Legislature that redrew district lines\nfor a number of Texas seats in the House of Representa-\ntives. 548 U.

And the events giving rise to\nLULAC are strikingly similar to those here. Just as redis-\ntricting prevented Latinos in Texas from attaining a bene-\nfit they had fought for and were poised to enjoy, \u00a726\nprevents racial minorities in Michigan from enjoying a\nlast-resort benefit that they, too, had fought for through\nthe existing political processes.\n                             IV\n   My colleagues claim that the political-process doctrine is\nunadministrable and contrary to our more recent equal\nprotection precedents.

I note that in the view of many, it is those prece-\ndents that have departed from the mandate of the Equal\nProtection Clause in the first place, by applying strict\nscrutiny to actions designed to benefit rather than burden\nthe minority. See Gratz, 539 U. S., at 301 (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201c[A]s I see it, government decisionmakers may\nproperly distinguish between policies of exclusion and\ninclusion.

For nothing the\nCourt has said in the last 32 years undermines the princi-\nples announced in those cases.\n                               1\n  JUSTICE SCALIA first argues that the political-process\ndoctrine \u201cmisreads the Equal Protection Clause to protect\n\u2018particular group[s],\u2019 \u201d running counter to a line of cases\nthat treat \u201c \u2018equal protection as a personal right.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n9 (opinion concurring in judgment) (quoting Adarand, 515\nU. S., at 230). Equal protection, he says, protects \u201c \u2018per\u00ad\nsons, not groups.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 10 (quoting Adarand, 515\nU. S., at 227). This criticism ignores the obvious: Discrim-\nination against an individual occurs because of that indi-\nvidual\u2019s membership in a particular group. Yes, equal\nprotection is a personal right, but there can be no equal\nprotection violation unless the injured individual is a\nmember of a protected group or a class of individuals. It is\nmembership in the group\u2014here the racial minority\u2014that\ngives rise to an equal protection violation.\n   Relatedly, JUSTICE SCALIA argues that the political-\nprocess doctrine is inconsistent with our precedents be-\ncause it protects only the minority from political restruc-\nturings. This aspect of the doctrine, he says, cannot be\ntolerated because our precedents have rejected \u201c \u2018a reading\nof the guarantee of equal protection under which the level\nof scrutiny varies according to the ability of different\n40                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ngroups to defend their interests in the representative\nprocess.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 10 (quoting Richmond v. J. A. Croson\nCo., 488 U. S., 469, 495 (1989) (plurality opinion)). Equal\nprotection, he continues, \u201c \u2018cannot mean one thing when\napplied to one individual and something else when applied\nto a person of another color.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 10 (quoting Bakke,\n438 U. S., at 289\u2013290) (opinion of Powell, J.).\n  JUSTICE SCALIA is troubled that the political-process\ndoctrine has not been applied to trigger strict scrutiny for\npolitical restructurings that burden the majority. But the\ndoctrine is inapplicable to the majority. The minority\ncannot achieve such restructurings against the majority,\nfor the majority is, well, the majority. As the Seattle Court\nexplained, \u201c \u2018[t]he majority needs no protection against\ndiscriminat[ory restructurings], and if it did, a referen-\ndum, [for instance], might be bothersome but no more\nthan that.\u2019 \u201d 458 U. S., at 468. Stated differently, the\ndoctrine protects only the minority because it implicates a\nproblem that affects only the minority. Nothing in my\nopinion suggests, as JUSTICE SCALIA says, that under the\npolitical-process doctrine, \u201cthe Constitution prohibits\ndiscrimination against minority groups, but not against\nmajority groups.\u201d Ante, at 10, n. 7. If the minority some-\nhow managed to effectuate a political restructuring that\nburdened only the majority, we could decide then whether\nto apply the political-process doctrine to safeguard the\npolitical right of the majority. But such a restructuring is\nnot before us, and I cannot fathom how it could be\nachieved.\n                             2\n   JUSTICE SCALIA next invokes state sovereignty, arguing\nthat \u201cwe have emphasized the near-limitless sovereignty\nof each State to design its governing structure as it sees\nfit.\u201d Ante, at 13 (opinion concurring in judgment). But\nstate sovereignty is not absolute; it is subject to constitu-\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ___ (2014)            41\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntional limits. The Court surely did not offend state sover-\neignty by barring States from changing their voting proce-\ndures to exclude racial minorities. So why does the\npolitical-process doctrine offend state sovereignty? The\ndoctrine takes nothing away from state sovereignty that\nthe Equal Protection Clause does not require. All it says\nis that a State may not reconfigure its existing political\nprocesses in a manner that establishes a distinct and more\nburdensome process for minority members of our society\nalone to obtain legislation in their interests.\n   More broadly, JUSTICE SCALIA is troubled that the\npolitical-process doctrine would create supposed \u201caffirma-\ntive-action safe havens\u201d in places where the ordinary\npolitical process has thus far produced race-sensitive\nadmissions policies. Ante, at 13\u201314. It would not. As\nexplained previously, the voters in Michigan who opposed\nrace-sensitive admissions policies had any number of\noptions available to them to challenge those policies. See\nsupra, at 34\u201335. And in States where decisions regarding\nrace-sensitive admissions policies are not subject to the\npolitical process in the first place, voters are entirely free\nto eliminate such policies via a constitutional amendment\nbecause that action would not reallocate power in the\nmanner condemned in Hunter and Seattle (and, of course,\npresent here). The Seattle Court recognized this careful\nbalance between state sovereignty and constitutional\nprotections:\n    \u201c[W]e do not undervalue the magnitude of the State\u2019s\n    interest in its system of education. Washington could\n    have reserved to state officials the right to make all\n    decisions in the areas of education and student as-\n    signment. It has chosen, however, to use a more elab-\n    orate system; having done so, the State is obligated to\n    operate that system within the confines of the Four-\n    teenth Amendment.\u201d 458 U. S., at 487.\n42                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nThe same is true of Michigan.\n                               3\n   Finally, JUSTICE SCALIA disagrees with \u201cthe proposition\nthat a facially neutral law may deny equal protection\nsolely because it has a disparate racial impact.\u201d Ante,\nat 15 (opinion concurring in judgment).            He would\nacknowledge, however, that an act that draws racial dis-\ntinctions or makes racial classifications triggers strict\nscrutiny regardless of whether discriminatory intent is\nshown. See Adarand, 515 U. S., at 213. That should\nsettle the matter: Section 26 draws a racial distinction. As\nthe Seattle Court explained, \u201cwhen the political process or\nthe decisionmaking mechanism used to address racially\nconscious legislation\u2014and only such legislation\u2014is sin-\ngled out for peculiar and disadvantageous treatment, the\ngovernmental action plainly rests on \u2018distinctions based on\nrace.\u2019 \u201d 458 U. S., at 485 (some internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also id., at 470 (noting that although a State\nmay \u201c \u2018allocate governmental power on the basis of any\ngeneral principle,\u2019 \u201d it may not use racial considerations \u201cto\ndefine the governmental decisionmaking structure\u201d).\n   But in JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s view, cases like Washington v.\nDavis, 426 U.

It is odd to suggest that\nprior precedents call into question a later one. Seattle\n(decided in 1982) postdated both Washington v. Davis\n(1976) and Arlington Heights (1977). JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\nsuggestion that Seattle runs afoul of the principles estab-\nlished in Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights\nwould come as a surprise to Justice Blackmun, who joined\nthe majority opinions in all three cases. Indeed, the Seat\u00ad\ntle Court explicitly rejected the argument that Hunter had\nbeen effectively overruled by Washington v. Davis and\nArlington Heights:\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

While decisions such\n     as Washington v.

So does \u00a726.14\n                              B\n  My colleagues also attack the first prong of the doctrine\nas \u201crais[ing] serious constitutional concerns,\u201d ante, at 11\n(plurality opinion), and being \u201cunadministrable,\u201d ante, at 7\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). JUSTICE SCALIA\nwonders whether judges are equipped to weigh in on what\nconstitutes a \u201cracial issue.\u201d See ante, at 8. The plurality,\ntoo, thinks courts would be \u201cwith no clear legal standards\nor accepted sources to guide judicial decision.\u201d Ante, at 12.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 The plurality raises another concern with respect to precedent. It\n\npoints to decisions by the California Supreme Court and the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upholding as constitu-\ntional Proposition 209, a California constitutional amendment identical\nin substance to \u00a726.

I fail to see the significance. We routinely\nresolve conflicts between lower courts; the necessary result, of course, is\nthat decisions of courts on one side of the debate are invalidated or\ncalled into question. I am unaware of a single instance where that\n(inevitable) fact influenced the Court\u2019s decision one way or the other.\nHad the lower courts proceeded in opposite fashion\u2014had the California\nSupreme Court and Ninth Circuit invalidated Proposition 209 and the\nSixth Circuit upheld \u00a726\u2014would the plurality come out the other way?\n44                    SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nYet as JUSTICE SCALIA recognizes, Hunter and Seattle\nprovide a standard: Does the public policy at issue \u201cinur[e]\nprimarily to the benefit of the minority, and [was it] de-\nsigned for that purpose\u201d? Seattle, 458 U. S., at 472; see\nante, at 8. Surely this is the kind of factual inquiry that\njudges are capable of making. JUSTICE SCALIA, for in-\nstance, accepts the standard announced in Washington v.\nDavis, which requires judges to determine whether dis-\ncrimination is intentional or whether it merely has a\ndiscriminatory effect. Such an inquiry is at least as diffi-\ncult for judges as the one called for by Hunter and Seattle.\nIn any event, it is clear that the constitutional amendment\nin this case has a racial focus; it is facially race-based and,\nby operation of law, disadvantages only minorities. See\nsupra, at 15\u201316.\n   \u201cNo good can come\u201d from these inquiries, JUSTICE\nSCALIA responds, because they divide the Nation along\nracial lines and perpetuate racial stereotypes.

Before the advent of race-sensitive admissions\npolicies, those institutions, like others around the country,\nwere essentially segregated. In 1868, two black students\nwere admitted to the University of Michigan, the first of\ntheir race. See Expert Report of James D. Anderson 4, in\nGratz v. Bollinger, No. 97\u201375231 (ED Mich.). In 1935,\nover six decades later, there were still only 35 black stu-\ndents at the University. Ibid. By 1954, this number had\nrisen to slightly below 200. Ibid. And by 1966, to around\n400, among a total student population of roughly 32,500\u2014\nbarely over 1 percent. Ibid. The numbers at the University\nof Michigan Law School are even more telling. During\nthe 1960\u2019s, the Law School produced 9 black graduates\namong a total of 3,041\u2014less than three-tenths of 1 per-\ncent. See App. in Grutter v. Bollinger, O. T. 2002, No. 02\u2013\n241, p. 204.\n   The housing and extracurricular policies at these insti-\ntutions also perpetuated open segregation. For instance,\nincoming students were permitted to opt out of rooming\nwith black students. Anderson, supra, at 7\u20138. And some\nfraternities and sororities excluded black students from\nmembership. Id., at 6\u20137.\n   In 1966, the Defense Department conducted an investi-\ngation into the University\u2019s compliance with Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act, and made 25 recommendations for in-\ncreasing opportunities for minority students. Id., at 9. In\n1970, a student group launched a number of protests,\nincluding a strike, demanding that the University increase\nits minority enrollment. Id., at 16\u201323. The University\u2019s\nBoard of Regents responded, adopting a goal of 10 percent\nblack admissions by the fall of 1973. Id., at 23.\n48                       SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   During the 1970\u2019s, the University continued to improve\nits admissions policies,15 encouraged by this Court\u2019s 1978\ndecision in Bakke. In that case, the Court told our Na-\ntion\u2019s colleges and universities that they could consider\nrace in admissions as part of a broader goal to create a\ndiverse student body, in which students of different back-\ngrounds would learn together, and thereby learn to live\ntogether. A little more than a decade ago, in Grutter, the\nCourt reaffirmed this understanding. In upholding the\nadmissions policy of the Law School, the Court laid to rest\nany doubt whether student body diversity is a compelling\ninterest that may justify the use of race.\n   Race-sensitive admissions policies are now a thing of the\npast in Michigan after \u00a726, even though\u2014as experts agree\nand as research shows\u2014those policies were making a\ndifference in achieving educational diversity. In Grutter,\nMichigan\u2019s Law School spoke candidly about the strides\nthe institution had taken successfully because of race-\nsensitive admissions. One expert retained by the Law\nSchool opined that a race-blind admissions system would\nhave a \u201cvery dramatic, negative effect on underrepresented\nminority admissions.\u201d Grutter, 539 U. S., at 320 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). He testified that the school\nhad admitted 35 percent of underrepresented minority\nstudents who had applied in 2000, as opposed to only 10\npercent who would have been admitted had race not been\nconsidered. Ibid. Underrepresented minority students\nwould thus have constituted 4 percent, as opposed to the\nactual 14.5 percent, of the class that entered in 2000.\nIbid.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 In 1973, the Law School graduated 41 black students (out of a class\n\nof 446) and the first Latino student in its history. App. in Grutter v.\nBollinger, O. T. 2002, No. 02\u2013241, p. 204. In 1976, it graduated its first\nNative American student. Ibid. On the whole, during the 1970\u2019s, the\nLaw School graduated 262 black students, compared to 9 in the previ-\nous decade, along with 41 Latino students. Ibid.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

See Brief for Respond-\nents Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of\nTrustees of Michigan State University et al. 18\u201325. Dur-\ning proceedings before the lower courts, several university\nofficials testified that \u00a726 would depress minority enroll-\nment at Michigan\u2019s public universities.

And the Dean of\nWayne State University Law School stated that \u201calthough\nsome creative approaches might mitigate the effects of\n[\u00a726], he \u2018did not think that any one of these proposals or\nany combination of these proposals was reasonably likely\nto result in the admission of a class that had the same or\nsimilar or higher numbers of African Americans, Latinos\nand Native Americans as the prior policy.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n   Michigan tells a different story.

See Brief for California Social Science Researchers\nand Admissions Experts as Amici Curiae 28.\n   The elimination of race-sensitive admissions policies in\nCalifornia has been especially harmful to black students.\nIn 2006, for example, there were fewer than 100 black\nstudents in UCLA\u2019s incoming class of roughly 5,000, the\nlowest number since at least 1973.

That view is at odds with our recognition in\nGrutter, and more recently in Fisher v. University of Texas\nat Austin, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), that race-sensitive admis-\nsions policies are necessary to achieve a diverse student\nbody when race-neutral alternatives have failed. More\nfundamentally, it ignores the importance of diversity in\ninstitutions of higher education and reveals how little my\ncolleagues understand about the reality of race in America.\n   This Court has recognized that diversity in education is\nparamount. With good reason. Diversity ensures that the\nnext generation moves beyond the stereotypes, the as-\nsumptions, and the superficial perceptions that students\ncoming from less-heterogeneous communities may harbor,\nconsciously or not, about people who do not look like them.\nRecognizing the need for diversity acknowledges that,\n\u201c[j]ust as growing up in a particular region or having\nparticular professional experiences is likely to affect an\nindividual\u2019s views, so too is one\u2019s own, unique experience\nof being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in\nwhich race unfortunately still matters.\u201d Grutter, 539\nU.

They must be free to immerse their\nstudents in a multiracial environment that fosters fre-\nquent and meaningful interactions with students of other\nraces, and thereby pushes such students to transcend any\nassumptions they may hold on the basis of skin color.\nWithout race-sensitive admissions policies, this might well\nbe impossible. The statistics I have described make that\nfact glaringly obvious. We should not turn a blind eye to\nsomething we cannot help but see.\n  To be clear, I do not mean to suggest that the virtues of\nadopting race-sensitive admissions policies should inform\nthe legal question before the Court today regarding the\nconstitutionality of \u00a726. But I cannot ignore the unfortu-\nnate outcome of today\u2019s decision: Short of amending the\nState Constitution, a Herculean task, racial minorities in\nMichigan are deprived of even an opportunity to convince\nMichigan\u2019s public colleges and universities to consider race\nin their admissions plans when other attempts to achieve\nracial diversity have proved unworkable, and those insti-\ntutions are unnecessarily hobbled in their pursuit of a\ndiverse student body.\n                        *     *    *\n  The Constitution does not protect racial minorities from\npolitical defeat. But neither does it give the majority free\nrein to erect selective barriers against racial minorities.\nThe political-process doctrine polices the channels of\nchange to ensure that the majority, when it wins, does so\nwithout rigging the rules of the game to ensure its success.\nToday, the Court discards that doctrine without good\nreason.\n  In doing so, it permits the decision of a majority of the\nvoters in Michigan to strip Michigan\u2019s elected university\n58                   SCHUETTE v. BAMN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nboards of their authority to make decisions with respect to\nconstitutionally permissible race-sensitive admissions\npolicies, while preserving the boards\u2019 plenary authority to\nmake all other educational decisions. \u201cIn a most direct\nsense, this implicates the judiciary\u2019s special role in safe-\nguarding the interests of those groups that are relegated\nto such a position of political powerlessness as to com-\nmand extraordinary protection from the majoritarian\npolitical process.\u201d Seattle, 458 U. S., at 486 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Court abdicates that role,\npermitting the majority to use its numerical advantage to\nchange the rules mid-contest and forever stack the deck\nagainst racial minorities in Michigan. The result is that\nMichigan\u2019s public colleges and universities are less\nequipped to do their part in ensuring that students of all\nraces are \u201cbetter prepare[d] . . . for an increasingly diverse\nworkforce and society . . .\u201d Grutter, 539 U. S., at 330\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Today\u2019s decision eviscerates an important strand of our\nequal protection jurisprudence. For members of historically\nmarginalized groups, which rely on the federal courts to\nprotect their constitutional rights, the decision can hardly\nbolster hope for a vision of democracy that preserves for\nall the right to participate meaningfully and equally in\nself-government.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
