JEFFREY WAYNE COTTON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 13\u2013551.   Decided May 5, 2014\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   During the early morning hours of New Year\u2019s Eve,\n2008, police sergeant Jeffrey Cotton fired three bullets at\nRobert Tolan; one of those bullets hit its target and punc-\ntured Tolan\u2019s right lung. At the time of the shooting,\nTolan was unarmed on his parents\u2019 front porch about 15 to\n20 feet away from Cotton. Tolan sued, alleging that Cot-\nton had exercised excessive force in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment. The District Court granted summary judg-\nment to Cotton, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning\nthat regardless of whether Cotton used excessive force, he\nwas entitled to qualified immunity because he did not\nviolate any clearly established right. 713 F. 3d 299 (2013).\nIn articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth\nCircuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a\nmotion for summary judgment, \u201c[t]he evidence of the\nnonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences\nare to be drawn in his favor.\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U. S. 242, 255 (1986). For that reason, we vacate\nits decision and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The following facts, which we view in the light most\nfavorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and\nthe opinions below. At around 2:00 on the morning of\nDecember 31, 2008, John Edwards, a police officer, was on\npatrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan\n2                    TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nsport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential\nstreet. The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of\nthe street in front of a house. Two men exited: Tolan and\nhis cousin, Anthony Cooper.\n   Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of\nthe vehicle into a computer in his squad car. But he keyed\nan incorrect character; instead of entering plate number\n696BGK, he entered 695BGK. That incorrect number\nmatched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make. This\nmatch caused the squad car\u2019s computer to send an auto-\nmatic message to other police units, informing them that\nEdwards had found a stolen vehicle.\n   Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and\nordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground. He accused\nTolan and Cooper of having stolen the car. Cooper re-\nsponded, \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Record 1295. And Tolan ex-\nplained, \u201cThat\u2019s my car.\u201d Ibid. Tolan then complied with\nthe officer\u2019s demand to lie face-down on the home\u2019s front\nporch.\n   As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home\nwhere Tolan lived with his parents. Hearing the commo-\ntion, Tolan\u2019s parents exited the front door in their paja-\nmas. In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from\nescalating into something more, Tolan\u2019s father instructed\nCooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to\nsay nothing. Tolan and Cooper then remained facedown.\n   Edwards told Tolan\u2019s parents that he believed Tolan and\nCooper had stolen the vehicle. In response, Tolan\u2019s father\nidentified Tolan as his son, and Tolan\u2019s mother explained\nthat the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime\nhad been committed. Tolan\u2019s father explained, with his\nhands in the air, \u201c[T]his is my nephew. This is my son.\nWe live here. This is my house.\u201d Id., at 2059. Tolan\u2019s\nmother similarly offered, \u201c[S]ir this is a big mistake. This\ncar is not stolen. . . . That\u2019s our car.\u201d Id., at 2075.\n   While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nin silence, Edwards radioed for assistance. Shortly there-\nafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and\ndrew his pistol. Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and\nTolan had exited a stolen vehicle. Tolan\u2019s mother reiter-\nated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan\nhad been driving and the home where these events were\nunfolding. Cotton then ordered her to stand against the\nfamily\u2019s garage door. In response to Cotton\u2019s order, To-\nlan\u2019s mother asked, \u201c[A]re you kidding me? We\u2019ve lived\nher[e] 15 years. We\u2019ve never had anything like this hap-\npen before.\u201d Id., at 2077; see also id., at 1465.\n  The parties disagree as to what happened next. Tolan\u2019s\nmother and Cooper testified during Cotton\u2019s criminal trial1\nthat Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the\ngarage door with such force that she fell to the ground.\nId., at 2035, 2078\u20132080. Tolan similarly testified that\nCotton pushed his mother against the garage door. Id., at\n2479. In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother\nand photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton\nused enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back\nthat lasted for days. Id., at 2078\u20132079, 2089\u20132091. By\ncontrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he\nwas escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her\narm up and told him to get his hands off her. Id., at 1043.\nHe also testified that he did not know whether he left\nbruises but believed that he had not. Id., at 1044.\n  The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan\nresponded. Tolan testified in his deposition and during\nthe criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being\npushed, id., at 1249, he rose to his knees, id., at 1928.\nEdwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The events described here led to Cotton\u2019s criminal indictment in\n\nHarris County, Texas, for aggravated assault by a public servant. 713\nF. 3d 299, 303 (CA5 2013). He was acquitted. Ibid. The testimony of\nTolan\u2019s mother during Cotton\u2019s trial is a part of the record in this civil\naction. Record 2066\u20132087.\n4                        TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nId., at 1051\u20131052, 1121.\n  Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from\nroughly 15 to 20 feet away, 713 F. 3d, at 303, \u201c[G]et your\nfucking hands off my mom.\u201d Record 1928. The parties\nalso agree that Cotton then drew his pistol and fired three\nshots at Tolan. Tolan and his mother testified that these\nshots came with no verbal warning. Id., at 2019, 2080.\nOne of the bullets entered Tolan\u2019s chest, collapsing his\nright lung and piercing his liver. While Tolan survived, he\nsuffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding\nprofessional baseball career and causes him to experience\npain on a daily basis.\n                             B\n  In May 2009, Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan\u2019s parents filed\nthis suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims\nunder Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Tolan claimed,\namong other things, that Cotton had used excessive force\nagainst him in violation of the Fourth Amendment.2 After\ndiscovery, Cotton moved for summary judgment, arguing\nthat the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the suit.\nThat doctrine immunizes government officials from dam-\nages suits unless their conduct has violated a clearly\nestablished right.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment to Cot-\nton. 854 F. Supp. 2d 444 (SD Tex. 2012). It reasoned that\nCotton\u2019s use of force was not unreasonable and therefore\ndid not violate the Fourth Amendment. Id., at 477\u2013478.\nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed, but on a different basis. 713\nF. 3d 299. It declined to decide whether Cotton\u2019s actions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The complaint also alleged that the officers\u2019 actions violated the\n\nEqual Protection Clause to the extent they were motivated by Tolan\u2019s\nand Cooper\u2019s race. 854 F. Supp. 2d 444, 465 (SD Tex. 2012). In addi-\ntion, the complaint alleged that Cotton used excessive force against\nTolan\u2019s mother. Id., at 468. Those claims, which were dismissed, id., at\n465, 470, are not before this Court.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, it held that\neven if Cotton\u2019s conduct did violate the Fourth Amend-\nment, Cotton was entitled to qualified immunity because\nhe did not violate a clearly established right. Id., at 306.\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit began by\nnoting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, \u201cit was . . .\nclearly established that an officer had the right to use\ndeadly force if that officer harbored an objective and rea-\nsonable belief that a suspect presented an \u2018immediate\nthreat to [his] safety.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 306 (quoting Deville v.\nMarcantel, 567 F. 3d 156, 167 (CA5 2009)). The Court\nof Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome the\nqualified-immunity bar because \u201can objectively-reasonable\nofficer in Sergeant Cotton\u2019s position could have . . . be-\nlieved\u201d that Tolan \u201cpresented an \u2018immediate threat to the\nsafety of the officers.\u2019 \u201d 713 F. 3d, at 307.3 In support of\nthis conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the\nfront porch had been \u201cdimly-lit\u201d; Tolan\u2019s mother had \u201cre-\nfus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm\u201d; and Tolan\u2019s\nwords had amounted to a \u201cverba[l] threa[t].\u201d Ibid. Most\ncritically, the court also relied on the purported fact that\nTolan was \u201cmoving to intervene in\u201d Cotton\u2019s handling of\nhis mother, id., at 305, and that Cotton therefore could\nreasonably have feared for his life, id., at 307. Accord-\ningly, the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly estab-\nlished law in shooting Tolan.\n   The Fifth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 538 Fed.\nAppx. 374 (2013). Three judges voted to grant rehearing.\nJudge Dennis filed a dissent, contending that the panel\nopinion \u201cfail[ed] to address evidence that, when viewed in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Tolan argues that the Fifth Circuit incorrectly analyzed the reason-\n\nableness of Sergeant Cotton\u2019s beliefs under the second prong of the\nqualified-immunity analysis rather than the first. See Pet. for Cert. 12,\n20. Because we rule in Tolan\u2019s favor on the narrow ground that the\nFifth Circuit erred in its application of the summary judgment stand-\nard, we express no view as to Tolan\u2019s additional argument.\n6                    TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff, creates genuine\nissues of material fact as to whether an objective officer in\nCotton\u2019s position could have reasonably and objectively\nbelieved that [Tolan] posed an immediate, significant\nthreat of substantial injury to him.\u201d Id., at 377.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n   In resolving questions of qualified immunity at sum-\nmary judgment, courts engage in a two-pronged inquiry.\nThe first asks whether the facts, \u201c[t]aken in the light most\nfavorable to the party asserting the injury, . . . show the\nofficer\u2019s conduct violated a [federal] right[.]\u201d Saucier v.\nKatz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). When a plaintiff alleges\nexcessive force during an investigation or arrest, the\nfederal right at issue is the Fourth Amendment right\nagainst unreasonable seizures. Graham v. Connor, 490\nU. S. 386, 394 (1989). The inquiry into whether this right\nwas violated requires a balancing of \u201c \u2018the nature and\nquality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment interests against the importance of the gov-\nernmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\u2019 \u201d\nTennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 8 (1985); see Graham,\nsupra, at 396.\n   The second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis\nasks whether the right in question was \u201cclearly estab-\nlished\u201d at the time of the violation. Hope v. Pelzer, 536\nU. S. 730, 739 (2002). Governmental actors are \u201cshielded\nfrom liability for civil damages if their actions did not\nviolate \u2018clearly established statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. \u201c[T]he salient question . . . is whether the state of\nthe law\u201d at the time of an incident provided \u201cfair warning\u201d\nto the defendants \u201cthat their alleged [conduct] was uncon-\nstitutional.\u201d Id., at 741.\n    Courts have discretion to decide the order in which to\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nengage these two prongs. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S.\n223, 236 (2009). But under either prong, courts may not\nresolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seek-\ning summary judgment. See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543\nU. S. 194, 195, n. 2 (2004) (per curiam); Saucier, supra, at\n201; Hope, supra, at 733, n. 1. This is not a rule specific to\nqualified immunity; it is simply an application of the more\ngeneral rule that a \u201cjudge\u2019s function\u201d at summary judg-\nment is not \u201cto weigh the evidence and determine the\ntruth of the matter but to determine whether there is a\ngenuine issue for trial.\u201d Anderson, 477 U. S., at 249.\nSummary judgment is appropriate only if \u201cthe movant\nshows that there is no genuine issue as to any material\nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a). In making that determi-\nnation, a court must view the evidence \u201cin the light most\nfavorable to the opposing party.\u201d Adickes v. S. H. Kress &\nCo., 398 U. S. 144, 157 (1970); see also Anderson, supra, at\n255.\n  Our qualified-immunity cases illustrate the importance\nof drawing inferences in favor of the nonmovant, even\nwhen, as here, a court decides only the clearly-established\nprong of the standard. In cases alleging unreasonable\nsearches or seizures, we have instructed that courts\nshould define the \u201cclearly established\u201d right at issue on\nthe basis of the \u201cspecific context of the case.\u201d Saucier,\nsupra, at 201; see also Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S.\n635, 640\u2013641 (1987). Accordingly, courts must take care\nnot to define a case\u2019s \u201ccontext\u201d in a manner that imports\ngenuinely disputed factual propositions. See Brosseau,\nsupra, at 195, 198 (inquiring as to whether conduct violated\nclearly established law \u201c \u2018in light of the specific context\nof the case\u2019 \u201d and construing \u201cfacts . . . in a light most\nfavorable to\u201d the nonmovant).\n8                     TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n                               B\n   In holding that Cotton\u2019s actions did not violate clearly\nestablished law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evi-\ndence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to\nTolan with respect to the central facts of this case. By\nfailing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key\nfactual conclusions, the court improperly \u201cweigh[ed] the\nevidence\u201d and resolved disputed issues in favor of the\nmoving party, Anderson, 477 U. S., at 249.\n   First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the\nshooting, the Tolans\u2019 front porch was \u201cdimly-lit.\u201d 713\nF. 3d, at 307. The court appears to have drawn this as-\nsessment from Cotton\u2019s statements in a deposition that\nwhen he fired at Tolan, the porch was \u201c \u2018fairly dark,\u2019 \u201d and\nlit by a gas lamp that was \u201c \u2018decorative.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 302. In\nhis own deposition, however, Tolan\u2019s father was asked\nwhether the gas lamp was in fact \u201cmore decorative than\nilluminating.\u201d Record 1552. He said that it was not. Ibid.\nMoreover, Tolan stated in his deposition that two flood-\nlights shone on the driveway during the incident, id.,\nat 2496, and Cotton acknowledged that there were two\nmotion-activated lights in front of the house. Id., at 1034.\nAnd Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he\nwas \u201cnot in darkness.\u201d Id., at 2498\u20132499.\n   Second, the Fifth Circuit stated that Tolan\u2019s mother\n\u201crefus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm,\u201d thereby \u201ccom-\npound[ing]\u201d Cotton\u2019s belief that Tolan \u201cpresented an im-\nmediate threat to the safety of the officers.\u201d 713 F. 3d, at\n307 (internal quotation marks omitted). But here, too, the\ncourt did not credit directly contradictory evidence. Al-\nthough the parties agree that Tolan\u2019s mother repeatedly\ninformed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in\nthe home in front of which he had parked, and that the\nvehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her hus-\nband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this\ninformation. Cotton stated during his deposition that\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nTolan\u2019s mother was \u201cvery agitated\u201d when she spoke to the\nofficers. Record 1032\u20131033. By contrast, Tolan\u2019s mother\ntestified at Cotton\u2019s criminal trial that she was neither\n\u201caggravated\u201d nor \u201cagitated.\u201d Id., at 2075, 2077.\n  Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was \u201cshouting,\u201d\n713 F. 3d, at 306, 308, and \u201cverbally threatening\u201d the\nofficer, id., at 307, in the moments before the shooting.\nThe court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton\nwas grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton,\n\u201c[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.\u201d Record 1928. But\nTolan testified that he \u201cwas not screaming.\u201d Id., at 2544.\nAnd a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in con-\ntext, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict\nharm. Cf. United States v. White, 258 F. 3d 374, 383 (CA5\n2001) (\u201cA threat imports \u2018[a] communicated intent to\ninflict physical or other harm\u2019 \u201d (quoting Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1480 (6th ed. 1990))); Morris v. Noe, 672 F. 3d\n1185, 1196 (CA10 2012) (inferring that the words \u201cWhy\nwas you talking to Mama that way\u201d did not constitute an\n\u201covert threa[t]\u201d). Tolan\u2019s mother testified in Cotton\u2019s\ncriminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door\nwith enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days.\nRecord 2078\u20132079. A jury could well have concluded that\na reasonable officer would have heard Tolan\u2019s words not as\na threat, but as a son\u2019s plea not to continue any assault of\nhis mother.\n  Fourth, the Fifth Circuit inferred that at the time of the\nshooting, Tolan was \u201cmoving to intervene in Sergeant\nCotton\u2019s\u201d interaction with his mother. 713 F. 3d, at\n305; see also id., at 308 (characterizing Tolan\u2019s behavior\nas \u201cabruptly attempting to approach Sergeant Cotton,\u201d\nthereby \u201cinflam[ing] an already tense situation\u201d). The\ncourt appears to have credited Edwards\u2019 account that at\nthe time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet \u201c[i]n a\ncrouch\u201d or a \u201ccharging position\u201d looking as if he was going\nto move forward. Record 1121\u20131122. Tolan testified at\n10                   TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ntrial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot\nhim, id., at 1928, a fact corroborated by his mother, id., at\n2081. Tolan also testified in his deposition that he \u201cwasn\u2019t\ngoing anywhere,\u201d id., at 2502, and emphasized that he did\nnot \u201cjump up,\u201d id., at 2544.\n   Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable\nconclusion that the court below credited the evidence of\nthe party seeking summary judgment and failed properly\nto acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing\nthat motion. And while \u201cthis Court is not equipped to\ncorrect every perceived error coming from the lower federal\ncourts,\u201d Boag v. MacDougall 454 U. S. 364, 366 (1982)\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring), we intervene here because the\nopinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of sum-\nmary judgment standards in light of our precedents.

By\nweighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences\ncontrary to Tolan\u2019s competent evidence, the court below\nneglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at\nthe summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences\nshould be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.\n   Applying that principle here, the court should have\nacknowledged and credited Tolan\u2019s evidence with regard\nto the lighting, his mother\u2019s demeanor, whether he shouted\nwords that were an overt threat, and his positioning\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Decided May 5, 2014\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, con-\ncurring in the judgment.\n   The Court takes two actions. It grants the petition for a\nwrit of certiorari, and it summarily vacates the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals.\n   The granting of a petition for plenary review is not a\ndecision from which Members of this Court have custom-\narily registered dissents, and I do not do so here. I note,\nhowever, that the granting of review in this case sets a\nprecedent that, if followed in other cases, will very sub-\nstantially alter the Court\u2019s practice. See, e.g., this Court\u2019s\nRule 10 (\u201cA petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted\nwhen the asserted error consists of erroneous factual\nfindings or the misapplication of a properly stated rule of\nlaw\u201d); S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E.

The present case falls into\nthat very large category. There is no confusion in the\ncourts of appeals about the standard to be applied in\nruling on a summary judgment motion, and the Court of\nAppeals invoked the correct standard here. See 713 F. 3d\n2                     TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n299, 304 (CA5 2013). Thus, the only issue is whether the\nrelevant evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\nthe nonmoving party, is sufficient to support a judgment\nfor that party. In the courts of appeals, cases presenting\nthis question are utterly routine. There is no question\nthat this case is important for the parties, but the same is\ntrue for a great many other cases that fall into the same\ncategory.\n  On the merits of the case, while I do not necessarily\nagree in all respects with the Court\u2019s characterization of\nthe evidence, I agree that there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact and that this is a case in which summary\njudgment should not have been granted.\n  I therefore concur in the judgment.\n",

TOLAN v. JEFFREY WAYNE COTTON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 13\u2013551.   Decided May 5, 2014\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   During the early morning hours of New Year\u2019s Eve,\n2008, police sergeant Jeffrey Cotton fired three bullets at\nRobert Tolan; one of those bullets hit its target and punc-\ntured Tolan\u2019s right lung. At the time of the shooting,\nTolan was unarmed on his parents\u2019 front porch about 15 to\n20 feet away from Cotton. Tolan sued, alleging that Cot-\nton had exercised excessive force in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment. The District Court granted summary judg-\nment to Cotton, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning\nthat regardless of whether Cotton used excessive force, he\nwas entitled to qualified immunity because he did not\nviolate any clearly established right. 713 F. 3d 299 (2013).\nIn articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth\nCircuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a\nmotion for summary judgment, \u201c[t]he evidence of the\nnonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences\nare to be drawn in his favor.\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U. S. 242, 255 (1986). For that reason, we vacate\nits decision and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The following facts, which we view in the light most\nfavorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and\nthe opinions below. At around 2:00 on the morning of\nDecember 31, 2008, John Edwards, a police officer, was on\npatrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan\n2                    TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nsport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential\nstreet. The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of\nthe street in front of a house. Two men exited: Tolan and\nhis cousin, Anthony Cooper.\n   Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of\nthe vehicle into a computer in his squad car. But he keyed\nan incorrect character; instead of entering plate number\n696BGK, he entered 695BGK. That incorrect number\nmatched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make. This\nmatch caused the squad car\u2019s computer to send an auto-\nmatic message to other police units, informing them that\nEdwards had found a stolen vehicle.\n   Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and\nordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground. He accused\nTolan and Cooper of having stolen the car. Cooper re-\nsponded, \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Record 1295. And Tolan ex-\nplained, \u201cThat\u2019s my car.\u201d Ibid. Tolan then complied with\nthe officer\u2019s demand to lie face-down on the home\u2019s front\nporch.\n   As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home\nwhere Tolan lived with his parents. Hearing the commo-\ntion, Tolan\u2019s parents exited the front door in their paja-\nmas. In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from\nescalating into something more, Tolan\u2019s father instructed\nCooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to\nsay nothing. Tolan and Cooper then remained facedown.\n   Edwards told Tolan\u2019s parents that he believed Tolan and\nCooper had stolen the vehicle. In response, Tolan\u2019s father\nidentified Tolan as his son, and Tolan\u2019s mother explained\nthat the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime\nhad been committed. Tolan\u2019s father explained, with his\nhands in the air, \u201c[T]his is my nephew. This is my son.\nWe live here. This is my house.\u201d Id., at 2059. Tolan\u2019s\nmother similarly offered, \u201c[S]ir this is a big mistake. This\ncar is not stolen. . . . That\u2019s our car.\u201d Id., at 2075.\n   While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nin silence, Edwards radioed for assistance. Shortly there-\nafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and\ndrew his pistol. Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and\nTolan had exited a stolen vehicle. Tolan\u2019s mother reiter-\nated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan\nhad been driving and the home where these events were\nunfolding. Cotton then ordered her to stand against the\nfamily\u2019s garage door. In response to Cotton\u2019s order, To-\nlan\u2019s mother asked, \u201c[A]re you kidding me? We\u2019ve lived\nher[e] 15 years. We\u2019ve never had anything like this hap-\npen before.\u201d Id., at 2077; see also id., at 1465.\n  The parties disagree as to what happened next. Tolan\u2019s\nmother and Cooper testified during Cotton\u2019s criminal trial1\nthat Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the\ngarage door with such force that she fell to the ground.\nId., at 2035, 2078\u20132080. Tolan similarly testified that\nCotton pushed his mother against the garage door. Id., at\n2479. In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother\nand photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton\nused enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back\nthat lasted for days. Id., at 2078\u20132079, 2089\u20132091. By\ncontrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he\nwas escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her\narm up and told him to get his hands off her. Id., at 1043.\nHe also testified that he did not know whether he left\nbruises but believed that he had not. Id., at 1044.\n  The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan\nresponded. Tolan testified in his deposition and during\nthe criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being\npushed, id., at 1249, he rose to his knees, id., at 1928.\nEdwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The events described here led to Cotton\u2019s criminal indictment in\n\nHarris County, Texas, for aggravated assault by a public servant. 713\nF. 3d 299, 303 (CA5 2013). He was acquitted. Ibid. The testimony of\nTolan\u2019s mother during Cotton\u2019s trial is a part of the record in this civil\naction. Record 2066\u20132087.\n4                        TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nId., at 1051\u20131052, 1121.\n  Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from\nroughly 15 to 20 feet away, 713 F. 3d, at 303, \u201c[G]et your\nfucking hands off my mom.\u201d Record 1928. The parties\nalso agree that Cotton then drew his pistol and fired three\nshots at Tolan. Tolan and his mother testified that these\nshots came with no verbal warning. Id., at 2019, 2080.\nOne of the bullets entered Tolan\u2019s chest, collapsing his\nright lung and piercing his liver. While Tolan survived, he\nsuffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding\nprofessional baseball career and causes him to experience\npain on a daily basis.\n                             B\n  In May 2009, Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan\u2019s parents filed\nthis suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims\nunder Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Tolan claimed,\namong other things, that Cotton had used excessive force\nagainst him in violation of the Fourth Amendment.2 After\ndiscovery, Cotton moved for summary judgment, arguing\nthat the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the suit.\nThat doctrine immunizes government officials from dam-\nages suits unless their conduct has violated a clearly\nestablished right.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment to Cot-\nton. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It reasoned that\nCotton\u2019s use of force was not unreasonable and therefore\ndid not violate the Fourth Amendment. Id., at 477\u2013478.\nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed, but on a different basis. 713\nF. 3d 299. It declined to decide whether Cotton\u2019s actions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The complaint also alleged that the officers\u2019 actions violated the\n\nEqual Protection Clause to the extent they were motivated by Tolan\u2019s\nand Cooper\u2019s race. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Id., at 468. Those claims, which were dismissed, id., at\n465, 470, are not before this Court.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, it held that\neven if Cotton\u2019s conduct did violate the Fourth Amend-\nment, Cotton was entitled to qualified immunity because\nhe did not violate a clearly established right. Id., at 306.\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit began by\nnoting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, \u201cit was . . .\nclearly established that an officer had the right to use\ndeadly force if that officer harbored an objective and rea-\nsonable belief that a suspect presented an \u2018immediate\nthreat to [his] safety.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 306 (quoting Deville v.\nMarcantel, 567 F. 3d 156, 167 (CA5 2009)). The Court\nof Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome the\nqualified-immunity bar because \u201can objectively-reasonable\nofficer in Sergeant Cotton\u2019s position could have . . . be-\nlieved\u201d that Tolan \u201cpresented an \u2018immediate threat to the\nsafety of the officers.\u2019 \u201d 713 F. 3d, at 307.3 In support of\nthis conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the\nfront porch had been \u201cdimly-lit\u201d; Tolan\u2019s mother had \u201cre-\nfus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm\u201d; and Tolan\u2019s\nwords had amounted to a \u201cverba[l] threa[t].\u201d Ibid. Most\ncritically, the court also relied on the purported fact that\nTolan was \u201cmoving to intervene in\u201d Cotton\u2019s handling of\nhis mother, id., at 305, and that Cotton therefore could\nreasonably have feared for his life, id., at 307. Accord-\ningly, the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly estab-\nlished law in shooting Tolan.\n   The Fifth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 538 Fed.\nAppx. 374 (2013). Three judges voted to grant rehearing.\nJudge Dennis filed a dissent, contending that the panel\nopinion \u201cfail[ed] to address evidence that, when viewed in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Tolan argues that the Fifth Circuit incorrectly analyzed the reason-\n\nableness of Sergeant Cotton\u2019s beliefs under the second prong of the\nqualified-immunity analysis rather than the first. See Pet. for Cert. 12,\n20. Because we rule in Tolan\u2019s favor on the narrow ground that the\nFifth Circuit erred in its application of the summary judgment stand-\nard, we express no view as to Tolan\u2019s additional argument.\n6                    TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff, creates genuine\nissues of material fact as to whether an objective officer in\nCotton\u2019s position could have reasonably and objectively\nbelieved that [Tolan] posed an immediate, significant\nthreat of substantial injury to him.\u201d Id., at 377.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n   In resolving questions of qualified immunity at sum-\nmary judgment, courts engage in a two-pronged inquiry.\nThe first asks whether the facts, \u201c[t]aken in the light most\nfavorable to the party asserting the injury, . . . show the\nofficer\u2019s conduct violated a [federal] right[.]\u201d Saucier v.\nKatz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). When a plaintiff alleges\nexcessive force during an investigation or arrest, the\nfederal right at issue is the Fourth Amendment right\nagainst unreasonable seizures. Graham v. Connor, 490\nU. S. 386, 394 (1989). The inquiry into whether this right\nwas violated requires a balancing of \u201c \u2018the nature and\nquality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment interests against the importance of the gov-\nernmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\u2019 \u201d\nTennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 8 (1985); see Graham,\nsupra, at 396.\n   The second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis\nasks whether the right in question was \u201cclearly estab-\nlished\u201d at the time of the violation. Hope v. Pelzer, 536\nU. S. 730, 739 (2002). Governmental actors are \u201cshielded\nfrom liability for civil damages if their actions did not\nviolate \u2018clearly established statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. \u201c[T]he salient question . . . is whether the state of\nthe law\u201d at the time of an incident provided \u201cfair warning\u201d\nto the defendants \u201cthat their alleged [conduct] was uncon-\nstitutional.\u201d Id., at 741.\n    Courts have discretion to decide the order in which to\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nengage these two prongs. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S.\n223, 236 (2009). But under either prong, courts may not\nresolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seek-\ning summary judgment. See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543\nU. S. 194, 195, n. 2 (2004) (per curiam); Saucier, supra, at\n201; Hope, supra, at 733, n. 1. This is not a rule specific to\nqualified immunity; it is simply an application of the more\ngeneral rule that a \u201cjudge\u2019s function\u201d at summary judg-\nment is not \u201cto weigh the evidence and determine the\ntruth of the matter but to determine whether there is a\ngenuine issue for trial.\u201d Anderson, 477 U. S., at 249.\nSummary judgment is appropriate only if \u201cthe movant\nshows that there is no genuine issue as to any material\nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a). In making that determi-\nnation, a court must view the evidence \u201cin the light most\nfavorable to the opposing party.\u201d Adickes v. S. H. Kress &\nCo., 398 U. S. 144, 157 (1970); see also Anderson, supra, at\n255.\n  Our qualified-immunity cases illustrate the importance\nof drawing inferences in favor of the nonmovant, even\nwhen, as here, a court decides only the clearly-established\nprong of the standard. In cases alleging unreasonable\nsearches or seizures, we have instructed that courts\nshould define the \u201cclearly established\u201d right at issue on\nthe basis of the \u201cspecific context of the case.\u201d Saucier,\nsupra, at 201; see also Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S.\n635, 640\u2013641 (1987). Accordingly, courts must take care\nnot to define a case\u2019s \u201ccontext\u201d in a manner that imports\ngenuinely disputed factual propositions. See Brosseau,\nsupra, at 195, 198 (inquiring as to whether conduct violated\nclearly established law \u201c \u2018in light of the specific context\nof the case\u2019 \u201d and construing \u201cfacts . . . in a light most\nfavorable to\u201d the nonmovant).\n8                     TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n                               B\n   In holding that Cotton\u2019s actions did not violate clearly\nestablished law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evi-\ndence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to\nTolan with respect to the central facts of this case. By\nfailing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key\nfactual conclusions, the court improperly \u201cweigh[ed] the\nevidence\u201d and resolved disputed issues in favor of the\nmoving party, Anderson, 477 U. S., at 249.\n   First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the\nshooting, the Tolans\u2019 front porch was \u201cdimly-lit.\u201d 713\nF. 3d, at 307. The court appears to have drawn this as-\nsessment from Cotton\u2019s statements in a deposition that\nwhen he fired at Tolan, the porch was \u201c \u2018fairly dark,\u2019 \u201d and\nlit by a gas lamp that was \u201c \u2018decorative.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 302. In\nhis own deposition, however, Tolan\u2019s father was asked\nwhether the gas lamp was in fact \u201cmore decorative than\nilluminating.\u201d Record 1552. He said that it was not. Ibid.\nMoreover, Tolan stated in his deposition that two flood-\nlights shone on the driveway during the incident, id.,\nat 2496, and Cotton acknowledged that there were two\nmotion-activated lights in front of the house. Id., at 1034.\nAnd Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he\nwas \u201cnot in darkness.\u201d Id., at 2498\u20132499.\n   Second, the Fifth Circuit stated that Tolan\u2019s mother\n\u201crefus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm,\u201d thereby \u201ccom-\npound[ing]\u201d Cotton\u2019s belief that Tolan \u201cpresented an im-\nmediate threat to the safety of the officers.\u201d 713 F. 3d, at\n307 (internal quotation marks omitted). But here, too, the\ncourt did not credit directly contradictory evidence. Al-\nthough the parties agree that Tolan\u2019s mother repeatedly\ninformed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in\nthe home in front of which he had parked, and that the\nvehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her hus-\nband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this\ninformation. Cotton stated during his deposition that\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nTolan\u2019s mother was \u201cvery agitated\u201d when she spoke to the\nofficers. Record 1032\u20131033. By contrast, Tolan\u2019s mother\ntestified at Cotton\u2019s criminal trial that she was neither\n\u201caggravated\u201d nor \u201cagitated.\u201d Id., at 2075, 2077.\n  Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was \u201cshouting,\u201d\n713 F. 3d, at 306, 308, and \u201cverbally threatening\u201d the\nofficer, id., at 307, in the moments before the shooting.\nThe court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton\nwas grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton,\n\u201c[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.\u201d Record 1928. But\nTolan testified that he \u201cwas not screaming.\u201d Id., at 2544.\nAnd a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in con-\ntext, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict\nharm. Cf. United States v. White, 258 F. 3d 374, 383 (CA5\n2001) (\u201cA threat imports \u2018[a] communicated intent to\ninflict physical or other harm\u2019 \u201d (quoting Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1480 (6th ed. 1990))); Morris v. Noe, 672 F. 3d\n1185, 1196 (CA10 2012) (inferring that the words \u201cWhy\nwas you talking to Mama that way\u201d did not constitute an\n\u201covert threa[t]\u201d). Tolan\u2019s mother testified in Cotton\u2019s\ncriminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door\nwith enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days.\nRecord 2078\u20132079. A jury could well have concluded that\na reasonable officer would have heard Tolan\u2019s words not as\na threat, but as a son\u2019s plea not to continue any assault of\nhis mother.\n  Fourth, the Fifth Circuit inferred that at the time of the\nshooting, Tolan was \u201cmoving to intervene in Sergeant\nCotton\u2019s\u201d interaction with his mother. 713 F. 3d, at\n305; see also id., at 308 (characterizing Tolan\u2019s behavior\nas \u201cabruptly attempting to approach Sergeant Cotton,\u201d\nthereby \u201cinflam[ing] an already tense situation\u201d). The\ncourt appears to have credited Edwards\u2019 account that at\nthe time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet \u201c[i]n a\ncrouch\u201d or a \u201ccharging position\u201d looking as if he was going\nto move forward. Record 1121\u20131122. Tolan testified at\n10                   TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ntrial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot\nhim, id., at 1928, a fact corroborated by his mother, id., at\n2081. Tolan also testified in his deposition that he \u201cwasn\u2019t\ngoing anywhere,\u201d id., at 2502, and emphasized that he did\nnot \u201cjump up,\u201d id., at 2544.\n   Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable\nconclusion that the court below credited the evidence of\nthe party seeking summary judgment and failed properly\nto acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing\nthat motion. And while \u201cthis Court is not equipped to\ncorrect every perceived error coming from the lower federal\ncourts,\u201d Boag v. MacDougall 454 U. S. 364, 366 (1982)\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring), we intervene here because the\nopinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of sum-\nmary judgment standards in light of our precedents. Cf.\nBrosseau, 543 U. S., at 197\u2013198 (summarily reversing\ndecision in a Fourth Amendment excessive force case \u201cto\ncorrect a clear misapprehension of the qualified immunity\nstandard\u201d); see also Florida Dept. of Health and Rehabili-\ntative Servs. v. Florida Nursing Home Assn., 450 U. S.\n147, 150 (1981) (per curiam) (summarily reversing an\nopinion that could not \u201cbe reconciled with the principles\nset out\u201d in this Court\u2019s sovereign immunity jurisprudence).\n   The witnesses on both sides come to this case with their\nown perceptions, recollections, and even potential biases.\nIt is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are\ngenerally resolved by juries in our adversarial system. By\nweighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences\ncontrary to Tolan\u2019s competent evidence, the court below\nneglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at\nthe summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences\nshould be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.\n   Applying that principle here, the court should have\nacknowledged and credited Tolan\u2019s evidence with regard\nto the lighting, his mother\u2019s demeanor, whether he shouted\nwords that were an overt threat, and his positioning\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nduring the shooting. This is not to say, of course, that\nthese are the only facts that the Fifth Circuit should con-\nsider, or that no other facts might contribute to the rea-\nsonableness of the officer\u2019s actions as a matter of law. Nor\ndo we express a view as to whether Cotton\u2019s actions vio-\nlated clearly established law. We instead vacate the Fifth\nCircuit\u2019s judgment so that the court can determine whether,\nwhen Tolan\u2019s evidence is properly credited and factual\ninferences are reasonably drawn in his favor, Cotton\u2019s\nactions violated clearly established law.\n                        *   *    *\n  The petition for certiorari and the NAACP Legal De-\nfense and Educational Fund\u2019s motion to file an amicus\ncuriae brief are granted. The judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is vacated,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             1\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n   ROBERT R. TOLAN v. JEFFREY WAYNE COTTON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                No. 13\u2013551.   Decided May 5, 2014\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, con-\ncurring in the judgment.\n   The Court takes two actions. It grants the petition for a\nwrit of certiorari, and it summarily vacates the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals.\n   The granting of a petition for plenary review is not a\ndecision from which Members of this Court have custom-\narily registered dissents, and I do not do so here. I note,\nhowever, that the granting of review in this case sets a\nprecedent that, if followed in other cases, will very sub-\nstantially alter the Court\u2019s practice. See, e.g., this Court\u2019s\nRule 10 (\u201cA petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted\nwhen the asserted error consists of erroneous factual\nfindings or the misapplication of a properly stated rule of\nlaw\u201d); S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E. Hartnett, & D.\nHimmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice \u00a75.12(c)(3), p. 352\n(10th ed. 2013) (\u201c[E]rror correction . . . is outside the\nmainstream of the Court\u2019s functions and . . . not among\nthe \u2018compelling reasons\u2019 . . . that govern the grant of\ncertiorari\u201d).\n   In my experience, a substantial percentage of the civil\nappeals heard each year by the courts of appeals present\nthe question whether the evidence in the summary judg-\nment record is just enough or not quite enough to support\na grant of summary judgment. The present case falls into\nthat very large category. There is no confusion in the\ncourts of appeals about the standard to be applied in\nruling on a summary judgment motion, and the Court of\nAppeals invoked the correct standard here. See 713 F. 3d\n2                     TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n299, 304 (CA5 2013). Thus, the only issue is whether the\nrelevant evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\nthe nonmoving party, is sufficient to support a judgment\nfor that party. In the courts of appeals, cases presenting\nthis question are utterly routine. There is no question\nthat this case is important for the parties, but the same is\ntrue for a great many other cases that fall into the same\ncategory.\n  On the merits of the case, while I do not necessarily\nagree in all respects with the Court\u2019s characterization of\nthe evidence, I agree that there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact and that this is a case in which summary\njudgment should not have been granted.\n  I therefore concur in the judgment.\n</pre>",
