UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12\u20139012. Argued February 25, 2014\u2014Decided May 5, 2014\nPetitioner Robers was convicted of a federal crime for submitting\n  fraudulent mortgage loan applications to two banks. On appeal, he\n  argued that the District Court had miscalculated his restitution obli-\n  gation under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73663A\u20133664, a provision of which requires property crime\n  offenders to pay \u201can amount equal to . . . the value of the property\u201d\n  less \u201cthe value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of\n  the property that is returned,\u201d \u00a73663A(b)(1)(B). The District Court\n  had ordered Robers to pay the difference between the amount lent to\n  him and the amount the banks received in selling the houses that\n  had served as collateral for the loans. Robers claimed that the Dis-\n  trict Court should have instead reduced the restitution amount by\n  the value of the houses on the date the banks took title to them since\n  that was when \u201cpart of the property\u201d was \u201creturned.\u201d The Seventh\n  Circuit rejected Robers\u2019 argument.\nHeld: The phrase \u201cany part of the property . . . returned\u201d refers to the\n property the banks lost, namely, the money they lent to Robers, and\n not to the collateral the banks received, namely, the houses. Read\n naturally, the words \u201cthe property,\u201d which appear seven times in\n \u00a73663A(b)(1), refer to the property that was lost as a result of the\n crime, here, the money. Because \u201c[g]enerally, \u2018identical words used\n in different parts of the same statute are . . . presumed to have the\n same meaning,\u2019 \u201d Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit,\n 547 U. S. 71, 86 (quoting IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34), \u201cthe\n property . . . returned\u201d must also be the property lost as a result of\n the crime. Any awkwardness or redundancy that comes from substi-\n tuting an amount of money for the words \u201cthe property\u201d is the lin-\n guistic price paid for having a single statutory provision that covers\n2                      ROBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    different kinds of property. Since valuing money is easier than valu-\n    ing other types of property, the natural reading also facilitates the\n    statute\u2019s administration.\n      Robers\u2019 contrary arguments are unconvincing. First, other provi-\n    sions of the statute, see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a73664(f)(2), (3)(A), (4), seem to give\n    courts adequate authority to avoid Robers\u2019 false dichotomy of having\n    to choose between refusing to award restitution and requiring the of-\n    fender to pay the full amount lent where a victim has not sold the col-\n    lateral by the time of sentencing. Second, for purposes of the stat-\n    ute\u2019s proximate-cause requirement, see \u00a7\u00a73663A(a)(2), 3664(e),\n    normal market fluctuations do not break the causal chain between\n    the offender\u2019s fraud and the losses incurred by the victim. Third,\n    even assuming that the return of collateral compensates lenders for\n    their losses under state mortgage law, the issue here is whether the\n    statutory provision, which does not purport to track state mortgage\n    law, requires that collateral received be valued at the time the victim\n    received it. Finally, the rule of lenity does not apply here. See Mus-\n    carello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                  [May 5, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 requires\ncertain offenders to restore property lost by their victims\nas a result of the crime. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73663A. A provision\nin the statute says that, when return of the property lost by\nthe victim is \u201cimpossible, impracticable, or inadequate,\u201d\nthe offender must pay the victim \u201can amount equal to . . .\nthe value of the property\u201d less \u201cthe value (as of the date\nthe property is returned) of any part of the property that is\nreturned.\u201d \u00a73663A(b)(1)(B). The question before us is\nwhether \u201cany part of the property\u201d is \u201creturned\u201d when a\nvictim takes title to collateral securing a loan that an\noffender fraudulently obtained from the victim.\n  We hold that it is not. In our view, the statutory phrase\n\u201cany part of the property\u201d refers only to the specific prop-\nerty lost by a victim, which, in the case of a fraudulently\nobtained loan, is the money lent. Therefore, no \u201cpart of\nthe property\u201d is \u201creturned\u201d to the victim until the collat-\neral is sold and the victim receives money from the sale.\nThe import of our holding is that a sentencing court must\nreduce the restitution amount by the amount of money the\nvictim received in selling the collateral, not the value of\n2                ROBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe collateral when the victim received it.\n                               I\n  The relevant facts, as simplified, are the following: In\n2005 petitioner Benjamin Robers, acting as a straw buyer,\nsubmitted fraudulent loan applications to two banks. The\nbanks lent Robers about $470,000 for the purchase of two\nhouses, upon which the banks took mortgages. When\nRobers failed to make loan payments, the banks foreclosed\non the mortgages. In 2006 they took title to the two houses.\nIn 2007 they sold one house for about $120,000. And\nin 2008 they sold the other house for about $160,000. The\nsales took place in a falling real estate market.\n  In 2010 Robers was convicted in federal court of con-\nspiracy to commit wire fraud. See \u00a7\u00a7371, 1343. He was\nsentenced to three years of probation. And the court\nordered him to pay restitution of about $220,000, roughly\nthe $470,000 the banks lent to Robers less the $280,000\nthe banks received from the sale of the two houses (minus\ncertain expenses incurred in selling them).\n  On appeal Robers argued that the sentencing court had\nmiscalculated his restitution obligation. In his view, \u201cpart\nof the property\u201d was \u201creturned\u201d to the banks when they\ntook title to the houses. And, since the statute says that\n\u201creturned\u201d property shall be valued \u201cas of the date the\nproperty is returned,\u201d the sentencing court should have\nreduced the restitution amount by more than $280,000:\n$280,000 was what the banks received from the sale of the\nhouses, but since the banks sold the houses in a falling\nreal estate market, the houses had been worth more when\nthe banks took title to them.\n  The Court of Appeals rejected Robers\u2019 argument. 698\nF. 3d 937 (CA7 2012). And, because different Circuits\nhave come to different conclusions about this kind of\nmatter, we granted Robers\u2019 petition for certiorari.

Yeung, 672 F. 3d 594, 604 (CA9 2012) (restitution\nobligation reduced by value of collateral at time lender\ntook title).\n                             II\n   In our view, the phrase \u201cany part of the property . . .\nreturned\u201d refers to the property the banks lost, namely,\nthe money they lent to Robers, and not to the collateral\nthe banks received, namely, the two houses. For one\nthing, that is what the statute says. The phrase is part of\na long sentence that reads as follows:\n         \u201c(b) The order of restitution shall require that [the]\n     defendant\u2014\n         \u201c(1) in the case of an offense resulting in damage to\n     or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the\n     offense\u2014\n         \u201c(A) return the property to the owner of the property\n     . . . ; or\n         \u201c(B) if return of the property under subparagraph\n     (A) is impossible, impracticable, or inadequate, pay an\n     amount equal to\u2014\n         \u201c(i) the greater of\u2014\n         \u201c(I) the value of the property on the date of the dam-\n     age, loss, or destruction; or\n         \u201c(II) the value of the property on the date of sentenc-\n     ing, less\n         \u201c(ii) the value (as of the date the property is re-\n     turned) of any part of the property that is returned\n     . . . .\u201d \u00a73663A (emphasis added).\nThe words \u201cthe property\u201d appear seven times in this sen-\ntence. If read naturally, they refer to the \u201cproperty\u201d that\nwas \u201cdamage[d],\u201d \u201clos[t],\u201d or \u201cdestr[oyed]\u201d as a result of the\ncrime. \u00a73663A(b)(1). \u201cGenerally, \u2018identical words used in\ndifferent parts of the same statute are . . . presumed to\nhave the same meaning.\u2019 \u201d Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &\n4                 ROBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nSmith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71, 86 (2006) (quoting IBP,\nInc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34 (2005)). And, if the \u201cprop-\nerty\u201d that was \u201cdamage[d],\u201d \u201clos[t],\u201d or \u201cdestr[oyed]\u201d was\nthe money, then \u201cthe property . . . returned\u201d must also be\nthe money. Money being fungible, however, see, e.g.,\nRansom v. FIA Card Services, N. A., 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 17); Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S.\n600, 606 (2004), \u201cthe property . . . returned\u201d need not be\nthe very same bills or checks.\n  We concede that substituting an amount of money, say,\n$1,000, for the words \u201cthe property\u201d will sometimes seem\nawkward or unnecessary as, for example:\n    \u201c[I]f return of [$1,000] . . . is impossible, . . . pay an\n    amount equal to . . . the greater of . . . the value of\n    [$1,000] on the date of the . . . loss . . . or . . . the value\n    of [$1,000] on the date of sentencing . . . .\u201d\n    \u00a73663A(b)(1)(B).\nBut any such awkwardness or redundancy is the linguistic\nprice paid for having a single statutory provision that\ncovers property of many different kinds. The provision is\nnot awkward as applied to, say, a swindler who obtains\njewelry, is unable to return all of the jewelry, and must\nthen instead pay an amount equal to the value of all of the\njewelry obtained less the value (as of the date of the re-\nturn) of any of the jewelry that he did return. It directs\nthe court to value the returned jewelry as of the date it\nwas returned and subtract that amount from the value of\nall of the jewelry the swindler obtained. As applied to\nmoney, the provision is in part unnecessary but reading\nthe statute similarly does no harm. And the law does not\nrequire legislators to write extra language specifically\nexempting, phrase by phrase, applications in respect to\nwhich a portion of a phrase is not needed.\n   The natural reading also facilitates the statute\u2019s admin-\nistration. Many victims who lose money but subsequently\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreceive other property (e.g., collateral securing a loan) will\nsell that other property and receive money from the sale.\nAnd often that sale will take place fairly soon after the\nvictim receives the property. Valuing the money from the\nsale is easy. But valuing other property as of the time it\nwas received may provoke argument, requiring time,\nexpense, and expert testimony to resolve.\n  We are not convinced by Robers\u2019 arguments to the con-\ntrary. First, Robers says that, when a victim has not sold\nthe collateral by the time of sentencing, our interpretation\nwill lead to unfair results. A sentencing court will have\nonly two choices, both undesirable. The court will either\nhave to refuse to award restitution, thereby undercompen-\nsating the victim, or have to require the offender to pay\nthe full amount lent to him, thereby giving the victim a\nwindfall.\n  In our view, however, the dilemma is a false one. Other\nprovisions of the statute allow the court to avoid an under-\ncompensation or a windfall. Where, for example, a sale of\nthe collateral is foreseen but has not yet taken place, the\ncourt may postpone determination of the restitution\namount for two to three months after sentencing, thereby\nproviding the victim with additional time to sell. See\n\u00a73664(d)(5). Where a victim receives, say, collateral, but\ndoes not intend to sell it, other provisions of the statute\nmay come into play. Section 3664(f)(2) provides that upon\n    \u201cdetermination of the amount of restitution owed to\n    each victim, the court shall . . . specify in the restitu-\n    tion order the manner in which, and the schedule ac-\n    cording to which, the restitution is to be paid.\u201d\nSection 3664(f)(3)(A) says that a\n    \u201crestitution order may direct the defendant to make a\n    single, lump-sum payment, partial payments at spec-\n    ified intervals, in-kind payments, or a combination\n    of payments at specified intervals and in-kind\n6                ROBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    payments.\u201d\nAnd \u00a73664(f)(4) defines \u201cin-kind payment\u201d as including\n\u201creplacement of property.\u201d These provisions would seem\nto give a court adequate authority to count, as part of the\nrestitution paid, the value of collateral previously received\nbut not sold. Regardless, Robers has not pointed us to any\ncase suggesting an unfairness problem. And the Govern-\nment has conceded that the statute (whether through\nthese or other provisions) provides room for \u201ccredit[s]\u201d\nagainst an offender\u2019s restitution obligation \u201cto prevent\ndouble recovery to the victim.\u201d Brief for United States 30\n(emphasis deleted).\n  Robers also points out, correctly, that the statute has a\nproximate cause requirement. See \u00a73663A(a)(2) (defining\n\u201cvictim\u201d as \u201ca person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of \u201d the offense (emphasis added));\n\u00a73664(e) (Government bears the \u201cburden of demon-\nstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a\nresult of the offense\u201d (emphasis added)). Cf. Paroline v.\nUnited States, ante, at 6\u201311. And Robers argues that\nwhere, as here, a victim receives less money from a later\nsale than the collateral was worth when received, the\nmarket and not the offender is the proximate cause of the\ndeficiency.\n  We are not convinced. The basic question that a proxi-\nmate cause requirement presents is \u201cwhether the harm\nalleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct\u201d\nat issue. Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components,\nInc., ante, at 14. Here, it does. Fluctuations in property\nvalues are common. Their existence (though not direction\nor amount) is foreseeable. And losses in part incurred\nthrough a decline in the value of collateral sold are di-\nrectly related to an offender\u2019s having obtained collateralized\nproperty through fraud. That is not to say that an offender\nis responsible for everything that reduces the amount of\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoney a victim receives for collateral. Market fluctua-\ntions are normally unlike, say, an unexpected natural\ndisaster that destroys collateral or a victim\u2019s donation of\ncollateral or its sale to a friend for a nominal sum\u2014any of\nwhich, as the Government concedes, could break the causal\nchain. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25\u201327, 38\u201339, 46, 50\u201351.\n   Further, Robers argues that \u201cprinciples\u201d of state mort-\ngage law \u201cconfirm that the return of mortgage collateral\ncompensates a lender for its losses.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n30. But whether the collateral compensates a victim for\nits losses is not the question before us. That question is\nwhether the particular statutory provision at issue here\nrequires that collateral received be valued at the time the\nvictim received it. That statutory provision does not pur-\nport to track the details of state mortgage law. Thus, even\nwere we to assume that Robers is right about the details of\nstate mortgage law, we would not find them sufficient to\nchange our interpretation.\n   Finally, Robers invokes the rule of lenity. To apply this\nrule, we would have to assume that we could interpret the\nstatutory provision to help an offender like Robers, who is\nhurt when the market for collateral declines, without\nharming other offenders, who would be helped when the\nmarket for collateral rises. We cannot find such an inter-\npretation. Regardless, the rule of lenity applies only if,\nafter using the usual tools of statutory construction, we\nare left with a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the\nstatute.\u201d Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Having come\nto the end of our analysis, we are left with no such ambi-\nguity or uncertainty here. The statutory provision refers\nto the money lost, not to the collateral received.\n                        *    *   *\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis affirmed.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

I write separately, how-\never, to clarify that I see its analysis as applying only in\ncases where a victim intends to sell collateral but encoun-\nters a reasonable delay in doing so. See ante, at 5\u20136 (ex-\nplaining that where a victim \u201cdoes not intend to sell\u201d\ncollateral, \u201cother provisions of the statute may come into\nplay,\u201d enabling a court \u201cto count, as part of the restitution\npaid, the value of collateral previously received but not\nsold\u201d). If a victim chooses to hold collateral rather than to\nreduce it to cash within a reasonable time, then the victim\nmust bear the risk of any subsequent decline in the value\nof the collateral, because the defendant is not the proxi-\nmate cause of that decline.\n   Here, although the banks did not immediately sell the\nhomes they received as collateral, Robers did not ade-\nquately argue below that their delay reflected a choice to\nhold the homes as investments.* Such an argument would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Before the District Court, Robers suggested precisely the opposite:\nthat the banks had sold the homes too hastily, at fire-sale prices in a\nfalling market. See App. 35 (\u201cThe drop in value could have been due to\nthe housing market itself, or due to the victim\u2019s rush to cut their losses\nwith the properties and take whatever price they could get at a sheriff\u2019s\nsale, regardless of whether the sale price reflected the fair market value\nof the property at the time\u201d). Before the Seventh Circuit, Robers did\n2                    ROBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nlikely have been fruitless, because the delay appears\nconsistent with a genuine desire to dispose of the collat-\neral. Real property is not a liquid asset, which means that\nconverting it to cash often takes time. See, e.g., 698 F. 3d\n937, 947 (CA7 2012) (\u201c[R]eal property is not liquid and,\nabsent a huge price discount, cannot be sold immediately\u201d).\nAnd indeed, the delays here appear to have resulted\nfrom illiquidity. See App. 70 (one of the two homes was\nplaced on the market but did not immediately sell); id., at\n89 (the other attracted no bids at a foreclosure sale).\nBecause such delays are foreseeable, it is fair for Robers to\nbear their cost: the diminution in the homes\u2019 value. See\nante, at 6 (analysis of proximate causation).\n   In other cases, however, a defendant might be able to\nshow that a significant delay in the sale of collateral\nevinced the victim\u2019s choice to hold it as an investment\nrather than reducing it to cash. Suppose, for example,\nthat a bank received shares of a public company as collat-\neral for a fraudulently obtained loan. \u201cCommon stock\ntraded on a national exchange is . . . readily convertible\ninto cash,\u201d Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U. S. 56, 69\n(1990), so if the bank waited more than a reasonable time\nto sell the shares, a district court could infer that the bank\nwas not really trying to sell but instead was holding the\nshares as investment assets. If the shares declined in\nvalue after the bank chose to hold them, it would be wrong\nfor the court to make the defendant bear that loss. As the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsuggest that the banks should have sold more quickly.

But this argu-\nment does not imply that the banks\u2019 delay reflected a choice to hold the\nhomes as investments, only that the banks misjudged the timing of the\nsales.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\u201339, 44\u201345.\nIf the collateral loses value after the victim chooses to hold\nit, then that \u201cpart of the victim\u2019s net los[s]\u201d is \u201cattributable\nto\u201d the victim\u2019s \u201cindependent decisions.\u201d Id., at 39.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12\u20139012. Argued February 25, 2014\u2014Decided May 5, 2014\nPetitioner Robers was convicted of a federal crime for submitting\n  fraudulent mortgage loan applications to two banks. On appeal, he\n  argued that the District Court had miscalculated his restitution obli-\n  gation under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73663A\u20133664, a provision of which requires property crime\n  offenders to pay \u201can amount equal to . . . the value of the property\u201d\n  less \u201cthe value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of\n  the property that is returned,\u201d \u00a73663A(b)(1)(B). The District Court\n  had ordered Robers to pay the difference between the amount lent to\n  him and the amount the banks received in selling the houses that\n  had served as collateral for the loans. Robers claimed that the Dis-\n  trict Court should have instead reduced the restitution amount by\n  the value of the houses on the date the banks took title to them since\n  that was when \u201cpart of the property\u201d was \u201creturned.\u201d The Seventh\n  Circuit rejected Robers\u2019 argument.\nHeld: The phrase \u201cany part of the property . . . returned\u201d refers to the\n property the banks lost, namely, the money they lent to Robers, and\n not to the collateral the banks received, namely, the houses. Read\n naturally, the words \u201cthe property,\u201d which appear seven times in\n \u00a73663A(b)(1), refer to the property that was lost as a result of the\n crime, here, the money. Because \u201c[g]enerally, \u2018identical words used\n in different parts of the same statute are . . . presumed to have the\n same meaning,\u2019 \u201d Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v.

Any awkwardness or redundancy that comes from substi-\n tuting an amount of money for the words \u201cthe property\u201d is the lin-\n guistic price paid for having a single statutory provision that covers\n2                      ROBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    different kinds of property. Since valuing money is easier than valu-\n    ing other types of property, the natural reading also facilitates the\n    statute\u2019s administration.\n      Robers\u2019 contrary arguments are unconvincing. First, other provi-\n    sions of the statute, see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a73664(f)(2), (3)(A), (4), seem to give\n    courts adequate authority to avoid Robers\u2019 false dichotomy of having\n    to choose between refusing to award restitution and requiring the of-\n    fender to pay the full amount lent where a victim has not sold the col-\n    lateral by the time of sentencing. Second, for purposes of the stat-\n    ute\u2019s proximate-cause requirement, see \u00a7\u00a73663A(a)(2), 3664(e),\n    normal market fluctuations do not break the causal chain between\n    the offender\u2019s fraud and the losses incurred by the victim. Third,\n    even assuming that the return of collateral compensates lenders for\n    their losses under state mortgage law, the issue here is whether the\n    statutory provision, which does not purport to track state mortgage\n    law, requires that collateral received be valued at the time the victim\n    received it. Finally, the rule of lenity does not apply here. See Mus-\n    carello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                  [May 5, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 requires\ncertain offenders to restore property lost by their victims\nas a result of the crime. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73663A. A provision\nin the statute says that, when return of the property lost by\nthe victim is \u201cimpossible, impracticable, or inadequate,\u201d\nthe offender must pay the victim \u201can amount equal to . . .\nthe value of the property\u201d less \u201cthe value (as of the date\nthe property is returned) of any part of the property that is\nreturned.\u201d \u00a73663A(b)(1)(B). The question before us is\nwhether \u201cany part of the property\u201d is \u201creturned\u201d when a\nvictim takes title to collateral securing a loan that an\noffender fraudulently obtained from the victim.\n  We hold that it is not. In our view, the statutory phrase\n\u201cany part of the property\u201d refers only to the specific prop-\nerty lost by a victim, which, in the case of a fraudulently\nobtained loan, is the money lent. Therefore, no \u201cpart of\nthe property\u201d is \u201creturned\u201d to the victim until the collat-\neral is sold and the victim receives money from the sale.\nThe import of our holding is that a sentencing court must\nreduce the restitution amount by the amount of money the\nvictim received in selling the collateral, not the value of\n2                ROBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe collateral when the victim received it.\n                               I\n  The relevant facts, as simplified, are the following: In\n2005 petitioner Benjamin Robers, acting as a straw buyer,\nsubmitted fraudulent loan applications to two banks. The\nbanks lent Robers about $470,000 for the purchase of two\nhouses, upon which the banks took mortgages. When\nRobers failed to make loan payments, the banks foreclosed\non the mortgages. In 2006 they took title to the two houses.\nIn 2007 they sold one house for about $120,000. And\nin 2008 they sold the other house for about $160,000. The\nsales took place in a falling real estate market.\n  In 2010 Robers was convicted in federal court of con-\nspiracy to commit wire fraud. See \u00a7\u00a7371, 1343. He was\nsentenced to three years of probation. And the court\nordered him to pay restitution of about $220,000, roughly\nthe $470,000 the banks lent to Robers less the $280,000\nthe banks received from the sale of the two houses (minus\ncertain expenses incurred in selling them).\n  On appeal Robers argued that the sentencing court had\nmiscalculated his restitution obligation. In his view, \u201cpart\nof the property\u201d was \u201creturned\u201d to the banks when they\ntook title to the houses. And, since the statute says that\n\u201creturned\u201d property shall be valued \u201cas of the date the\nproperty is returned,\u201d the sentencing court should have\nreduced the restitution amount by more than $280,000:\n$280,000 was what the banks received from the sale of the\nhouses, but since the banks sold the houses in a falling\nreal estate market, the houses had been worth more when\nthe banks took title to them.\n  The Court of Appeals rejected Robers\u2019 argument. 698\nF. 3d 937 (CA7 2012). And, because different Circuits\nhave come to different conclusions about this kind of\nmatter, we granted Robers\u2019 petition for certiorari.

Yeung, 672 F. 3d 594, 604 (CA9 2012) (restitution\nobligation reduced by value of collateral at time lender\ntook title).\n                             II\n   In our view, the phrase \u201cany part of the property . . .\nreturned\u201d refers to the property the banks lost, namely,\nthe money they lent to Robers, and not to the collateral\nthe banks received, namely, the two houses. For one\nthing, that is what the statute says. The phrase is part of\na long sentence that reads as follows:\n         \u201c(b) The order of restitution shall require that [the]\n     defendant\u2014\n         \u201c(1) in the case of an offense resulting in damage to\n     or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the\n     offense\u2014\n         \u201c(A) return the property to the owner of the property\n     . . . ; or\n         \u201c(B) if return of the property under subparagraph\n     (A) is impossible, impracticable, or inadequate, pay an\n     amount equal to\u2014\n         \u201c(i) the greater of\u2014\n         \u201c(I) the value of the property on the date of the dam-\n     age, loss, or destruction; or\n         \u201c(II) the value of the property on the date of sentenc-\n     ing, less\n         \u201c(ii) the value (as of the date the property is re-\n     turned) of any part of the property that is returned\n     . . . .\u201d \u00a73663A (emphasis added).\nThe words \u201cthe property\u201d appear seven times in this sen-\ntence.

And, if the \u201cprop-\nerty\u201d that was \u201cdamage[d],\u201d \u201clos[t],\u201d or \u201cdestr[oyed]\u201d was\nthe money, then \u201cthe property . . . returned\u201d must also be\nthe money. Money being fungible, however, see, e.g.,\nRansom v. FIA Card Services, N. A., 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 17); Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S.\n600, 606 (2004), \u201cthe property . . . returned\u201d need not be\nthe very same bills or checks.\n  We concede that substituting an amount of money, say,\n$1,000, for the words \u201cthe property\u201d will sometimes seem\nawkward or unnecessary as, for example:\n    \u201c[I]f return of [$1,000] . . . is impossible, . . . pay an\n    amount equal to . . . the greater of . . . the value of\n    [$1,000] on the date of the . . . loss . . . or . . . the value\n    of [$1,000] on the date of sentencing . . . .\u201d\n    \u00a73663A(b)(1)(B).\nBut any such awkwardness or redundancy is the linguistic\nprice paid for having a single statutory provision that\ncovers property of many different kinds. The provision is\nnot awkward as applied to, say, a swindler who obtains\njewelry, is unable to return all of the jewelry, and must\nthen instead pay an amount equal to the value of all of the\njewelry obtained less the value (as of the date of the re-\nturn) of any of the jewelry that he did return. It directs\nthe court to value the returned jewelry as of the date it\nwas returned and subtract that amount from the value of\nall of the jewelry the swindler obtained. As applied to\nmoney, the provision is in part unnecessary but reading\nthe statute similarly does no harm. And the law does not\nrequire legislators to write extra language specifically\nexempting, phrase by phrase, applications in respect to\nwhich a portion of a phrase is not needed.\n   The natural reading also facilitates the statute\u2019s admin-\nistration. Many victims who lose money but subsequently\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreceive other property (e.g., collateral securing a loan) will\nsell that other property and receive money from the sale.\nAnd often that sale will take place fairly soon after the\nvictim receives the property. Valuing the money from the\nsale is easy. But valuing other property as of the time it\nwas received may provoke argument, requiring time,\nexpense, and expert testimony to resolve.\n  We are not convinced by Robers\u2019 arguments to the con-\ntrary. First, Robers says that, when a victim has not sold\nthe collateral by the time of sentencing, our interpretation\nwill lead to unfair results. A sentencing court will have\nonly two choices, both undesirable. The court will either\nhave to refuse to award restitution, thereby undercompen-\nsating the victim, or have to require the offender to pay\nthe full amount lent to him, thereby giving the victim a\nwindfall.\n  In our view, however, the dilemma is a false one. Other\nprovisions of the statute allow the court to avoid an under-\ncompensation or a windfall. Where, for example, a sale of\nthe collateral is foreseen but has not yet taken place, the\ncourt may postpone determination of the restitution\namount for two to three months after sentencing, thereby\nproviding the victim with additional time to sell. See\n\u00a73664(d)(5). Where a victim receives, say, collateral, but\ndoes not intend to sell it, other provisions of the statute\nmay come into play. Section 3664(f)(2) provides that upon\n    \u201cdetermination of the amount of restitution owed to\n    each victim, the court shall . . . specify in the restitu-\n    tion order the manner in which, and the schedule ac-\n    cording to which, the restitution is to be paid.\u201d\nSection 3664(f)(3)(A) says that a\n    \u201crestitution order may direct the defendant to make a\n    single, lump-sum payment, partial payments at spec-\n    ified intervals, in-kind payments, or a combination\n    of payments at specified intervals and in-kind\n6                ROBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    payments.\u201d\nAnd \u00a73664(f)(4) defines \u201cin-kind payment\u201d as including\n\u201creplacement of property.\u201d These provisions would seem\nto give a court adequate authority to count, as part of the\nrestitution paid, the value of collateral previously received\nbut not sold. Regardless, Robers has not pointed us to any\ncase suggesting an unfairness problem. And the Govern-\nment has conceded that the statute (whether through\nthese or other provisions) provides room for \u201ccredit[s]\u201d\nagainst an offender\u2019s restitution obligation \u201cto prevent\ndouble recovery to the victim.\u201d Brief for United States 30\n(emphasis deleted).\n  Robers also points out, correctly, that the statute has a\nproximate cause requirement. See \u00a73663A(a)(2) (defining\n\u201cvictim\u201d as \u201ca person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of \u201d the offense (emphasis added));\n\u00a73664(e) (Government bears the \u201cburden of demon-\nstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a\nresult of the offense\u201d (emphasis added)). Cf. Paroline v.\nUnited States, ante, at 6\u201311. And Robers argues that\nwhere, as here, a victim receives less money from a later\nsale than the collateral was worth when received, the\nmarket and not the offender is the proximate cause of the\ndeficiency.\n  We are not convinced. The basic question that a proxi-\nmate cause requirement presents is \u201cwhether the harm\nalleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct\u201d\nat issue. Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components,\nInc., ante, at 14. Here, it does. Fluctuations in property\nvalues are common. Their existence (though not direction\nor amount) is foreseeable. And losses in part incurred\nthrough a decline in the value of collateral sold are di-\nrectly related to an offender\u2019s having obtained collateralized\nproperty through fraud. That is not to say that an offender\nis responsible for everything that reduces the amount of\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Market fluctua-\ntions are normally unlike, say, an unexpected natural\ndisaster that destroys collateral or a victim\u2019s donation of\ncollateral or its sale to a friend for a nominal sum\u2014any of\nwhich, as the Government concedes, could break the causal\nchain. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25\u201327, 38\u201339, 46, 50\u201351.\n   Further, Robers argues that \u201cprinciples\u201d of state mort-\ngage law \u201cconfirm that the return of mortgage collateral\ncompensates a lender for its losses.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n30. But whether the collateral compensates a victim for\nits losses is not the question before us. That question is\nwhether the particular statutory provision at issue here\nrequires that collateral received be valued at the time the\nvictim received it. That statutory provision does not pur-\nport to track the details of state mortgage law. Thus, even\nwere we to assume that Robers is right about the details of\nstate mortgage law, we would not find them sufficient to\nchange our interpretation.\n   Finally, Robers invokes the rule of lenity. To apply this\nrule, we would have to assume that we could interpret the\nstatutory provision to help an offender like Robers, who is\nhurt when the market for collateral declines, without\nharming other offenders, who would be helped when the\nmarket for collateral rises. We cannot find such an inter-\npretation. Regardless, the rule of lenity applies only if,\nafter using the usual tools of statutory construction, we\nare left with a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the\nstatute.\u201d Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Having come\nto the end of our analysis, we are left with no such ambi-\nguity or uncertainty here. The statutory provision refers\nto the money lost, not to the collateral received.\n                        *    *   *\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis affirmed.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [May 5, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG\njoins, concurring.\n   I join the opinion of the Court. I write separately, how-\never, to clarify that I see its analysis as applying only in\ncases where a victim intends to sell collateral but encoun-\nters a reasonable delay in doing so. See ante, at 5\u20136 (ex-\nplaining that where a victim \u201cdoes not intend to sell\u201d\ncollateral, \u201cother provisions of the statute may come into\nplay,\u201d enabling a court \u201cto count, as part of the restitution\npaid, the value of collateral previously received but not\nsold\u201d). If a victim chooses to hold collateral rather than to\nreduce it to cash within a reasonable time, then the victim\nmust bear the risk of any subsequent decline in the value\nof the collateral, because the defendant is not the proxi-\nmate cause of that decline.\n   Here, although the banks did not immediately sell the\nhomes they received as collateral, Robers did not ade-\nquately argue below that their delay reflected a choice to\nhold the homes as investments.* Such an argument would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Before the District Court, Robers suggested precisely the opposite:\nthat the banks had sold the homes too hastily, at fire-sale prices in a\nfalling market. See App. 35 (\u201cThe drop in value could have been due to\nthe housing market itself, or due to the victim\u2019s rush to cut their losses\nwith the properties and take whatever price they could get at a sheriff\u2019s\nsale, regardless of whether the sale price reflected the fair market value\nof the property at the time\u201d). Before the Seventh Circuit, Robers did\n2                    ROBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nlikely have been fruitless, because the delay appears\nconsistent with a genuine desire to dispose of the collat-\neral. Real property is not a liquid asset, which means that\nconverting it to cash often takes time. See, e.g., 698 F. 3d\n937, 947 (CA7 2012) (\u201c[R]eal property is not liquid and,\nabsent a huge price discount, cannot be sold immediately\u201d).\nAnd indeed, the delays here appear to have resulted\nfrom illiquidity. See App. 70 (one of the two homes was\nplaced on the market but did not immediately sell); id., at\n89 (the other attracted no bids at a foreclosure sale).\nBecause such delays are foreseeable, it is fair for Robers to\nbear their cost: the diminution in the homes\u2019 value. See\nante, at 6 (analysis of proximate causation).\n   In other cases, however, a defendant might be able to\nshow that a significant delay in the sale of collateral\nevinced the victim\u2019s choice to hold it as an investment\nrather than reducing it to cash. Suppose, for example,\nthat a bank received shares of a public company as collat-\neral for a fraudulently obtained loan. \u201cCommon stock\ntraded on a national exchange is . . . readily convertible\ninto cash,\u201d Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U. S. 56, 69\n(1990), so if the bank waited more than a reasonable time\nto sell the shares, a district court could infer that the bank\nwas not really trying to sell but instead was holding the\nshares as investment assets. If the shares declined in\nvalue after the bank chose to hold them, it would be wrong\nfor the court to make the defendant bear that loss. As the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsuggest that the banks should have sold more quickly. See Brief for\nAppellant in No. 10\u20133794, p. 35 (\u201c[T]here is no \u2018loss causation\u2019 here, . . .\nbecause the kind of loss that occurred (due to the market, or to the\nvictims holding the property longer than they should have in a declin-\ning market, or to other unknown factors) was not the kind for which the\ndefendant\u2019s acts could have controlled or accounted\u201d). But this argu-\nment does not imply that the banks\u2019 delay reflected a choice to hold the\nhomes as investments, only that the banks misjudged the timing of the\nsales.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              3\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nGovernment acknowledged at oral argument, a victim\u2019s\nchoice to hold collateral\u2014rather than selling it in a rea-\nsonably expeditious manner\u2014breaks the chain of proxi-\nmate causation. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\u201339, 44\u201345.\nIf the collateral loses value after the victim chooses to hold\nit, then that \u201cpart of the victim\u2019s net los[s]\u201d is \u201cattributable\nto\u201d the victim\u2019s \u201cindependent decisions.\u201d Id., at 39. The\ndefendant cannot be regarded as the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of\nthat part of the loss, ibid., and so cannot be made to bear\nit.\n    In such cases, I would place on the defendant the bur-\nden to show\u2014with evidence specific to the market at\nissue\u2014that a victim delayed unreasonably in selling col-\nlateral, manifesting a choice to hold the collateral. See 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73664(e) (burden to be allocated \u201cas justice re-\nquires\u201d). Because Robers did not sufficiently argue below\nthat the banks broke the chain of proximate causation by\nchoosing to hold the homes as investments, and because\nthe delay encountered by the banks appears to have been\nreasonable, it is fair for Robers to bear the cost of that\ndelay. I therefore join the Court in affirming the restitu-\ntion order.\n</pre>",
