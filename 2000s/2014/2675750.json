Argued March 4, 2014—Decided May 27, 2014\nDonald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase that came\n to a temporary halt when Rickard spun out into a parking lot. Rick-\n ard resumed maneuvering his car, and as he continued to use the ac-\n celerator even though his bumper was flush against a patrol car, an\n officer fired three shots into Rickard’s car. Rickard managed to drive\n away, almost hitting an officer in the process. Officers fired 12 more\n shots as Rickard sped away, striking him and his passenger, both of\n whom died from some combination of gunshot wounds and injuries\n suffered when the car eventually crashed.\n    Respondent, Rickard’s minor daughter, filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983\n action, alleging that the officers used excessive force in violation of\n the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court denied\n the officers’ motion for summary judgment based on qualified im-\n munity, holding that their conduct violated the Fourth Amendment\n and was contrary to clearly established law at the time in question.\n After finding that it had appellate jurisdiction, the Sixth Circuit held\n that the officers’ conduct violated the Fourth Amendment. It af-\n firmed the District Court’s order, suggesting that it agreed that the\n officers violated clearly established law.\nHeld:\n    1. The Sixth Circuit properly exercised jurisdiction under 28\n U. S. C. §1291, which gives courts of appeals jurisdiction to hear ap-\n peals from “final decisions” of the district courts. The general rule\n2                        PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    that an order denying a summary judgment motion is not a “final de-\n    cision[n],” and thus not immediately appealable, does not apply when\n    it is based on a qualified immunity claim. Johnson v. Jones, 515\n    U. S. 304, 311. Respondent argues that Johnson forecloses appellate\n    jurisdiction here, but the order in Johnson was not immediately ap-\n    pealable because it merely decided “a question of ‘evidence sufficien-\n    cy,’ ” id., at 313, while here, petitioners’ qualified immunity claims\n    raise legal issues quite different from any purely factual issues that\n    might be confronted at trial. Deciding such legal issues is a core re-\n    sponsibility of appellate courts and does not create an undue burden\n    for them. See, e.g., Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372. Pp. 5–7.\n       2. The officers’ conduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n    Pp. 7–15.\n          (a) Addressing this question first will be “beneficial” in “devel-\n    op[ing] constitutional precedent” in an area that courts typically con-\n    sider in cases in which the defendant asserts a qualified immunity\n    defense, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236. Pp. 7–8.\n          (b) Respondent’s excessive-force argument requires analyzing the\n    totality of the circumstances from the perspective “of a reasonable of-\n    ficer on the scene.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396. Respond-\n    ent contends that the Fourth Amendment did not allow the officers to\n    use deadly force to terminate the chase, and that, even if they were\n    permitted to fire their weapons, they went too far when they fired as\n    many rounds as they did. Pp. 8–12.\n            (1) The officers acted reasonably in using deadly force. A “po-\n    lice officer’s attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase\n    that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the\n    Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk\n    of serious injury or death.” Scott, supra, at 385. Rickard’s outra-\n    geously reckless driving—which lasted more than five minutes, ex-\n    ceeded 100 miles per hour, and included the passing of more than two\n    dozen other motorists—posed a grave public safety risk, and the rec-\n    ord conclusively disproves that the chase was over when Rickard’s\n    car came to a temporary standstill and officers began shooting. Un-\n    der the circumstances when the shots were fired, all that a reasona-\n    ble officer could have concluded from Rickard’s conduct was that he\n    was intent on resuming his flight, which would again pose a threat to\n    others on the road. Pp. 9–11.\n            (2) Petitioners did not fire more shots than necessary to end\n    the public safety risk. It makes sense that, if officers are justified in\n    firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety,\n    they need not stop shooting until the threat has ended. Here, during\n    the 10-second span when all the shots were fired, Rickard never\n    abandoned his attempt to flee and eventually managed to drive away.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  A passenger’s presence does not bear on whether officers violated\n  Rickard’s Fourth Amendment rights, which “are personal rights\n  [that] may not be vicariously asserted.” Alderman v. United States,\n  394 U. S. 165, 174. Pp. 11–12.\n     3. Even if the officers’ conduct had violated the Fourth Amend-\n  ment, petitioners would still be entitled to summary judgment based\n  on qualified immunity. An official sued under §1983 is entitled to\n  qualified immunity unless it is shown that the official violated a\n  statutory or constitutional right that was “ ‘clearly established’ ” at\n  the time of the challenged conduct. Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___,\n  ___. Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 201, where an officer shot at\n  a fleeing vehicle to prevent possible harm, makes plain that no clear-\n  ly established law precluded the officer’s conduct there. Thus, to pre-\n  vail, respondent must meaningfully distinguish Brosseau or point to\n  any “controlling authority” or “robust ‘consensus of cases of persua-\n  sive authority,’ ” al-Kidd, supra, at ___, that emerged between the\n  events there and those here that would alter the qualified-immunity\n  analysis. Respondent has made neither showing. If anything, the\n  facts here are more favorable to the officers than the facts in\n  Brosseau; and respondent points to no cases that could be said to\n  have clearly established the unconstitutionality of using lethal force\n  to end a high-speed car chase.

Wilkie v. Robbins, 551\nU. S. 537, 543, n. 2 (2007). Near midnight on July 18,\n2004, Lieutenant Joseph Forthman of the West Memphis,\nArkansas, Police Department pulled over a white Honda\nAccord because the car had only one operating headlight.\nDonald Rickard was the driver of the Accord, and Kelly\nAllen was in the passenger seat. Forthman noticed an\nindentation, “ ‘roughly the size of a head or a basketball’ ”\nin the windshield of the car. Estate of Allen v.

He\nasked Rickard if he had been drinking, and Rickard re­\nsponded that he had not. Because Rickard failed to pro­\nduce his driver’s license upon request and appeared nerv­\nous, Forthman asked him to step out of the car. Rather\nthan comply with Forthman’s request, Rickard sped away.\n   Forthman gave chase and was soon joined by five other\npolice cruisers driven by Sergeant Vance Plumhoff and\nOfficers Jimmy Evans, Lance Ellis, Troy Galtelli, and\nJohn Gardner. The officers pursued Rickard east on In­\nterstate 40 toward Memphis, Tennessee. While on I–40,\nthey attempted to stop Rickard using a “rolling roadblock,”\nid., at *2, but they were unsuccessful. The District Court\ndescribed the vehicles as “swerving through traffic at high\nspeeds,” id., at *8, and respondent does not dispute that\nthe cars attained speeds over 100 miles per hour.1 See\nMemorandum of Law in Response to Defendants’ Motion\nfor Summary Judgment in No. 2:05–cv–2585 (WD Tenn.),\np. 16; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 54:23–55:6.

As a result of that contact, Rickard’s car spun\nout into a parking lot and collided with Plumhoff ’s cruiser.\nNow in danger of being cornered, Rickard put his car into\nreverse “in an attempt to escape.” Ibid. As he did so,\nEvans and Plumhoff got out of their cruisers and ap­\nproached Rickard’s car, and Evans, gun in hand, pounded\non the passenger-side window. At that point, Rickard’s\ncar “made contact with” yet another police cruiser. Ibid.\nRickard’s tires started spinning, and his car “was rocking\nback and forth,” ibid., indicating that Rickard was using\nthe accelerator even though his bumper was flush against\na police cruiser. At that point, Plumhoff fired three shots\ninto Rickard’s car. Rickard then “reversed in a 180 degree\narc” and “maneuvered onto” another street, forcing Ellis to\n“step to his right to avoid the vehicle.” Ibid. As Rickard\ncontinued “fleeing down” that street, ibid., Gardner and\nGaltelli fired 12 shots toward Rickard’s car, bringing the\ntotal number of shots fired during this incident to 15.\nRickard then lost control of the car and crashed into a\nbuilding. Ibid. Rickard and Allen both died from some\ncombination of gunshot wounds and injuries suffered in\nthe crash that ended the chase. See App. 60, 76.\n                              B\n  Respondent, Rickard’s surviving daughter, filed this\naction under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, against\nthe six individual police officers and the mayor and chief\nof police of West Memphis. She alleged that the officers\nused excessive force in violation of the Fourth and Four­\nteenth Amendments.\n  The officers moved for summary judgment based on\n4                     PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nqualified immunity, but the District Court denied that\nmotion, holding that the officers’ conduct violated the\nFourth Amendment and was contrary to law that was\nclearly established at the time in question. The officers\nappealed, but a Sixth Circuit motions panel initially dis­\nmissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on this\nCourt’s decision in Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 309\n(1995). Later, however, that panel granted rehearing,\nvacated its dismissal order, and left the jurisdictional\nissue to be decided by a merits panel.\n   The merits panel then affirmed the District Court’s\ndecision on the merits. Estate of Allen v. West Memphis,\n509 Fed. Appx. 388 (CA6 2012). On the issue of appellate\njurisdiction, the merits panel began by stating that a\n“motion for qualified immunity denied on the basis of a\ndistrict court’s determination that there exists a triable\nissue of fact generally cannot be appealed on an interlocu­\ntory basis.” Id., at 391. But the panel then noted that the\nSixth Circuit had previously interpreted our decision in\nScott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372 (2007), as creating an “ex­\nception to this rule” under which an immediate appeal\nmay be taken to challenge “ ‘blatantly and demonstrably\nfalse’ ” factual determinations. 509 Fed. Appx., at 391\n(quoting Moldowan v. Warren, 578 F. 3d 351, 370 (CA6\n2009)). Concluding that none of the District Court’s fac-\ntual determinations ran afoul of that high standard, and\ndistinguishing the facts of this case from those in Scott,\nthe panel held that the officers’ conduct violated the\nFourth Amendment. 509 Fed. Appx., at 392, and n. 3.\nThe panel said nothing about whether the officers violated\nclearly established law, but since the panel affirmed the\norder denying the officers’ summary judgment motion,2\n——————\n  2 After expressing some confusion about whether it should dismiss or\n\naffirm, the panel wrote that “it would seem that what we are doing is\naffirming [the District Court’s] judgment.” 509 Fed.

S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe panel must have decided that issue in respondent’s\nfavor.\n  We granted certiorari. 571 U. S. ____ (2013).\n                              II\n   We start with the question whether the Court of Ap­\npeals properly exercised jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n§1291, which gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction to\nhear appeals from “final decisions” of the district courts.\n   An order denying a motion for summary judgment is\ngenerally not a final decision within the meaning of §1291\nand is thus generally not immediately appealable. John-\nson, 515 U. S., at 309. But that general rule does not\napply when the summary judgment motion is based on a\nclaim of qualified immunity. Id., at 311; Mitchell v. For-\nsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 528 (1985). “[Q]ualified immunity is\n‘an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to\nliability.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 231 (2009)\n(quoting Mitchell, supra, at 526). As a result, pretrial\norders denying qualified immunity generally fall within\nthe collateral order doctrine. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556\nU. S. 662, 671–672 (2009). This is so because such orders\nconclusively determine whether the defendant is entitled\nto immunity from suit; this immunity issue is both im­\nportant and completely separate from the merits of the\naction, and this question could not be effectively reviewed\non appeal from a final judgment because by that time the\nimmunity from standing trial will have been irretrievably\nlost. See ibid; Johnson, supra, at 311–312 (citing Mitchell,\nsupra, at 525–527).\n   Respondent argues that our decision in Johnson, fore­\ncloses appellate jurisdiction under the circumstances here,\nbut the order from which the appeal was taken in Johnson\nwas quite different from the order in the present case. In\nJohnson, the plaintiff brought suit against certain police\nofficers who, he alleged, had beaten him. 515 U. S., at\n6                  PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n307. These officers moved for summary judgment, assert­\ning that they were not present at the time of the alleged\nbeating and had nothing to do with it. Id., at 307–308.\nThe District Court determined, however, that the evidence\nin the summary judgment record was sufficient to support\na contrary finding, and the court therefore denied the\nofficers’ motion for summary judgment. Id., at 308. The\nofficers then appealed, arguing that the District Court had\nnot correctly analyzed the relevant evidence. Ibid.\n   This Court held that the Johnson order was not imme­\ndiately appealable because it merely decided “a question of\n‘evidence sufficiency,’ i.e., which facts a party may, or may\nnot, be able to prove at trial.” Id., at 313. The Court noted\nthat an order denying summary judgment based on a\ndetermination of “evidence sufficiency” does not present a\nlegal question in the sense in which the term was used in\nMitchell, the decision that first held that a pretrial order\nrejecting a claim of qualified immunity is immediately\nappealable. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 314. In addition, the\nCourt observed that a determination of evidence sufficiency\nis closely related to other determinations that the trial\ncourt may be required to make at later stages of the case.\nId., at 317. The Court also noted that appellate courts\nhave “no comparative expertise” over trial courts in mak­\ning such determinations and that forcing appellate courts\nto entertain appeals from such orders would impose an\nundue burden. Id., at 309–310, 316.\n   The District Court order in this case is nothing like the\norder in Johnson. Petitioners do not claim that other\nofficers were responsible for shooting Rickard; rather, they\ncontend that their conduct did not violate the Fourth\nAmendment and, in any event, did not violate clearly\nestablished law. Thus, they raise legal issues; these issues\nare quite different from any purely factual issues that the\ntrial court might confront if the case were tried; deciding\nlegal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts, and requiring appellate courts to decide such is­\nsues is not an undue burden.\n  The District Court order here is not materially distin­\nguishable from the District Court order in Scott v. Harris,\nand in that case we expressed no doubts about the juris­\ndiction of the Court of Appeals under §1291. Accordingly,\nhere, as in Scott, we hold that the Court of Appeals prop-\nerly exercised jurisdiction, and we therefore turn to the\nmerits.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   Petitioners contend that the decision of the Court of\nAppeals is wrong for two separate reasons. They maintain\nthat they did not violate Rickard’s Fourth Amendment\nrights and that, in any event, their conduct did not violate\nany Fourth Amendment rule that was clearly established\nat the time of the events in question. When confronted\nwith such arguments, we held in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S.\n194, 200 (2001), that “the first inquiry must be whether a\nconstitutional right would have been violated on the facts\nalleged.” Only after deciding that question, we concluded,\nmay an appellate court turn to the question whether the\nright at issue was clearly established at the relevant time.\nIbid.\n   We subsequently altered this rigid framework in Pear-\nson, declaring that “Saucier’s procedure should not be\nregarded as an inflexible requirement.” 555 U. S., at 227.\nAt the same time, however, we noted that the Saucier\nprocedure “is often beneficial” because it “promotes the\ndevelopment of constitutional precedent and is especially\nvaluable with respect to questions that do not frequently\narise in cases in which a qualified immunity defense is\nunavailable.” 555 U. S., at 236. Pearson concluded that\ncourts “have the discretion to decide whether that [Sau-\ncier] procedure is worthwhile in particular cases.” Id., at\n8                  PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n242.\n  Heeding our guidance in Pearson, we begin in this case\nwith the question whether the officers’ conduct violated\nthe Fourth Amendment. This approach, we believe, will\nbe “beneficial” in “develop[ing] constitutional precedent” in\nan area that courts typically consider in cases in which the\ndefendant asserts a qualified immunity defense. See\nPearson, supra, at 236.\n                               B\n   A claim that law-enforcement officers used excessive\nforce to effect a seizure is governed by the Fourth\nAmendment’s “reasonableness” standard. See Graham v.\nConnor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989); Tennessee v. Garner, 471\nU. S. 1 (1985). In Graham, we held that determining the\nobjective reasonableness of a particular seizure under the\nFourth Amendment “requires a careful balancing of the\nnature and quality of the intrusion on the individual’s\nFourth Amendment interests against the countervailing\ngovernmental interests at stake.” 490 U. S., at 396 (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted). The inquiry requires ana­\nlyzing the totality of the circumstances. See ibid.\n   We analyze this question from the perspective “of a\nreasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20\nvision of hindsight.” Ibid. We thus “allo[w] for the fact\nthat police officers are often forced to make split-second\njudgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain,\nand rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is\nnecessary in a particular situation.” Id., at 396–397.\n   In this case, respondent advances two main Fourth\nAmendment arguments. First, she contends that the\nFourth Amendment did not allow petitioners to use deadly\nforce to terminate the chase. See Brief for Respondent 24–\n35. Second, she argues that the “degree of force was ex­\ncessive,” that is, that even if the officers were permitted to\nfire their weapons, they went too far when they fired as\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

We address\neach issue in turn.\n                              1\n   In Scott, we considered a claim that a police officer\nviolated the Fourth Amendment when he terminated a\nhigh-speed car chase by using a technique that placed a\n“fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.” 550\nU. S., at 386. The record in that case contained a vide­\notape of the chase, and we found that the events recorded\non the tape justified the officer’s conduct. We wrote as\nfollows: “Although there is no obvious way to quantify the\nrisks on either side, it is clear from the videotape that\nrespondent posed an actual and imminent threat to the\nlives of any pedestrians who might have been present, to\nother civilian motorists, and to the officers involved in the\nchase.” Id., at 383–384. We also wrote:\n    “[R]espondent’s vehicle rac[ed] down narrow, two-lane\n    roads in the dead of night at speeds that are shock-\n    ingly fast. We see it swerve around more than a dozen\n    other cars, cross the double-yellow line, and force cars\n    traveling in both directions to their respective shoul­\n    ders to avoid being hit. We see it run multiple red\n    lights and travel for considerable periods of time in\n    the occasional center left-turn-only lane, chased by\n    numerous police cars forced to engage in the same\n    hazardous maneuvers just to keep up.” Id., at 379–\n    380 (footnote omitted).\n  In light of those facts, “we [thought] it [was] quite clear\nthat [the police officer] did not violate the Fourth Amend­\nment.” Id., at 381. We held that a “police officer’s attempt\nto terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that\nthreatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing\n10                     PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmotorist at risk of serious injury or death.”3 Id., at 386.\n  We see no basis for reaching a different conclusion here.\nAs we have explained supra, at ___, the chase in this case\nexceeded 100 miles per hour and lasted over five minutes.\nDuring that chase, Rickard passed more than two dozen\nother vehicles, several of which were forced to alter course.\nRickard’s outrageously reckless driving posed a grave\npublic safety risk. And while it is true that Rickard’s car\neventually collided with a police car and came temporarily\nto a near standstill, that did not end the chase. Less than\nthree seconds later, Rickard resumed maneuvering his\ncar. Just before the shots were fired, when the front\nbumper of his car was flush with that of one of the police\ncruisers, Rickard was obviously pushing down on the\naccelerator because the car’s wheels were spinning, and\nthen Rickard threw the car into reverse “in an attempt to\nescape.” Thus, the record conclusively disproves respond­\nent’s claim that the chase in the present case was already\nover when petitioners began shooting. Under the circum­\nstances at the moment when the shots were fired, all that\na reasonable police officer could have concluded was that\nRickard was intent on resuming his flight and that, if he\nwas allowed to do so, he would once again pose a deadly\nthreat for others on the road. Rickard’s conduct even after\nthe shots were fired—as noted, he managed to drive away\ndespite the efforts of the police to block his path—\n——————\n  3 In holding that petitioners’ conduct violated the Fourth Amend­\nment, the District Court relied on reasoning that is irreconcilable with\nour decision in Scott. The District Court held that the danger presented\nby a high-speed chase cannot justify the use of deadly force because\nthat danger was caused by the officers’ decision to continue the chase.\nEstate of Allen v. West Memphis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">197426</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *8 (WD Tenn., Jan.\n20, 2011). In Scott, however, we declined to “lay down a rule requiring\nthe police to allow fleeing suspects to get away whenever they drive so\nrecklessly that they put other people’s lives in danger,” concluding that\nthe Constitution “assuredly does not impose this invitation to impunity­\nearned-by-recklessness.” 550 U. S., at 385–386.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nunderscores the point.\n  In light of the circumstances we have discussed, it is\nbeyond serious dispute that Rickard’s flight posed a grave\npublic safety risk, and here, as in Scott, the police acted\nreasonably in using deadly force to end that risk.\n                                 2\n   We now consider respondent’s contention that, even if\nthe use of deadly force was permissible, petitioners acted\nunreasonably in firing a total of 15 shots. We reject that\nargument. It stands to reason that, if police officers are\njustified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe\nthreat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting\nuntil the threat has ended. As petitioners noted below, “if\nlethal force is justified, officers are taught to keep shooting\nuntil the threat is over.” 509 Fed. Appx., at 392.\n   Here, during the 10-second span when all the shots were\nfired, Rickard never abandoned his attempt to flee. In­\ndeed, even after all the shots had been fired, he managed\nto drive away and to continue driving until he crashed.\nThis would be a different case if petitioners had initiated a\nsecond round of shots after an initial round had clearly\nincapacitated Rickard and had ended any threat of con­\ntinued flight, or if Rickard had clearly given himself up.\nBut that is not what happened.\n   In arguing that too many shots were fired, respondent\nrelies in part on the presence of Kelly Allen in the front\nseat of the car, but we do not think that this factor\nchanges the calculus. Our cases make it clear that “Fourth\nAmendment rights are personal rights which . . . may not\nbe vicariously asserted.” Alderman v. United States, 394\nU. S. 165, 174 (1969); see also Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S.\n128, 138–143 (1978). Thus, the question before us is\nwhether petitioners violated Rickard’s Fourth Amendment\nrights, not Allen’s. If a suit were brought on behalf of\nAllen under either §1983 or state tort law, the risk to\n12                    PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nAllen would be of central concern.4 But Allen’s presence in\nthe car cannot enhance Rickard’s Fourth Amendment\nrights. After all, it was Rickard who put Allen in danger\nby fleeing and refusing to end the chase, and it would be\nperverse if his disregard for Allen’s safety worked to his\nbenefit.\n                               C\n   We have held that petitioners’ conduct did not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment, but even if that were not the case,\npetitioners would still be entitled to summary judgment\nbased on qualified immunity.\n   An official sued under §1983 is entitled to qualified\nimmunity unless it is shown that the official violated a\nstatutory or constitutional right that was “ ‘clearly estab­\nlished’ ” at the time of the challenged conduct. Ashcroft v.\nal-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3). And a\ndefendant cannot be said to have violated a clearly estab­\nlished right unless the right’s contours were sufficiently\ndefinite that any reasonable official in the defendant’s\nshoes would have understood that he was violating it. Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9). In other words, “existing precedent\nmust have placed the statutory or constitutional question”\nconfronted by the official “beyond debate.” Ibid. In addi­\ntion, “[w]e have repeatedly told courts . . . not to define\nclearly established law at a high level of generality,” id., at\n——————\n  4 There seems to be some disagreement among lower courts as to\nwhether a passenger in Allen’s situation can recover under a Fourth\nAmendment theory. Compare Vaughan v. Cox, 343 F. 3d 1323 (CA11\n2003) (suggesting yes), and Fisher v. Memphis, 234 F. 3d 312 (CA6\n2000) (same), with Milstead v. Kibler, 243 F. 3d 157 (CA4 2001) (sug­\ngesting no), and Landol-Rivera v. Cruz Cosme, 906 F. 2d 791 (CA1\n1990) (same). We express no view on this question. We also note that\nin County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 836 (1998), the Court\nheld that a passenger killed as a result of a police chase could recover\nunder a substantive due process theory only if the officer had “a pur­\npose to cause harm unrelated to the legitimate object of arrest.”\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

We think our deci­\nsion in Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194 (2004) (per\ncuriam) squarely demonstrates that no clearly established\nlaw precluded petitioners’ conduct at the time in question.\nIn Brosseau, we held that a police officer did not violate\nclearly established law when she fired at a fleeing vehicle\nto prevent possible harm to “other officers on foot who\n[she] believed were in the immediate area, . . . occupied\nvehicles in [the driver’s] path[,] and . . . any other citizens\nwho might be in the area.” Id., at 197 (quoting 339 F. 3d\n857, 865 (CA9 2003); internal quotation marks omitted).\nAfter surveying lower court decisions regarding the rea­\nsonableness of lethal force as a response to vehicular\nflight, we observed that this is an area “in which the result\ndepends very much on the facts of each case” and that the\ncases “by no means ‘clearly establish[ed]’ that [the of­\nficer’s] conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.” 543\nU. S., at 201. In reaching that conclusion, we held that\nGarner and Graham, which are “cast at a high level of\ngenerality,” did not clearly establish that the officer’s\ndecision was unreasonable. 543 U. S., at 199.\n   Brosseau makes plain that as of February 21, 1999—the\ndate of the events at issue in that case—it was not clearly\nestablished that it was unconstitutional to shoot a fleeing\ndriver to protect those whom his flight might endanger.\nWe did not consider later decided cases because they\n“could not have given fair notice to [the officer].” Id., at\n200, n. 4. To defeat immunity here, then, respondent\nmust show at a minimum either (1) that the officers’ con­\nduct in this case was materially different from the conduct\nin Brosseau or (2) that between February 21, 1999, and\nJuly 18, 2004, there emerged either “ ‘controlling authority’ ”\nor a “robust ‘consensus of cases of persuasive authority,’ ”\nal-Kidd, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting Wilson\n14                 PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999); some internal quota­\ntion marks omitted), that would alter our analysis of the\nqualified immunity question. Respondent has made nei­\nther showing.\n   To begin, certain facts here are more favorable to the\nofficers. In Brosseau, an officer on foot fired at a driver\nwho had just begun to flee and who had not yet driven his\ncar in a dangerous manner. In contrast, the officers here\nshot at Rickard to put an end to what had already been a\nlengthy, high-speed pursuit that indisputably posed a\ndanger both to the officers involved and to any civilians\nwho happened to be nearby. Indeed, the lone dissenting\nJustice in Brosseau emphasized that in that case, “there\nwas no ongoing or prior high-speed car chase to inform the\n[constitutional] analysis.” 543 U. S., at 206, n. 4 (opinion\nof Stevens, J.). Attempting to distinguish Brosseau, re­\nspondent focuses on the fact that the officer there fired\nonly 1 shot, whereas here three officers collectively fired\n15 shots. But it was certainly not clearly established at\nthe time of the shooting in this case that the number of\nshots fired, under the circumstances present here, ren­\ndered the use of force excessive.\n   Since respondent cannot meaningfully distinguish\nBrosseau, her only option is to show that its analysis was\nout of date by 2004. Yet respondent has not pointed us to\nany case—let alone a controlling case or a robust consen­\nsus of cases—decided between 1999 and 2004 that could\nbe said to have clearly established the unconstitutionality\nof using lethal force to end a high-speed car chase. And\nrespondent receives no help on this front from the opinions\nbelow. The District Court cited only a single case decided\nbetween 1999 and 2004 that identified a possible constitu­\ntional violation by an officer who shot a fleeing driver, and\nthe facts of that case—where a reasonable jury could have\nconcluded that the suspect merely “accelerated to eighty to\neighty-five miles per hour in a seventy-miles-per-hour\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Argued March 4, 2014—Decided May 27, 2014\nDonald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase that came\n to a temporary halt when Rickard spun out into a parking lot. Rick-\n ard resumed maneuvering his car, and as he continued to use the ac-\n celerator even though his bumper was flush against a patrol car, an\n officer fired three shots into Rickard’s car. Rickard managed to drive\n away, almost hitting an officer in the process. Officers fired 12 more\n shots as Rickard sped away, striking him and his passenger, both of\n whom died from some combination of gunshot wounds and injuries\n suffered when the car eventually crashed.\n    Respondent, Rickard’s minor daughter, filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983\n action, alleging that the officers used excessive force in violation of\n the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court denied\n the officers’ motion for summary judgment based on qualified im-\n munity, holding that their conduct violated the Fourth Amendment\n and was contrary to clearly established law at the time in question.\n After finding that it had appellate jurisdiction, the Sixth Circuit held\n that the officers’ conduct violated the Fourth Amendment. It af-\n firmed the District Court’s order, suggesting that it agreed that the\n officers violated clearly established law.\nHeld:\n    1. The Sixth Circuit properly exercised jurisdiction under 28\n U. S. C. §1291, which gives courts of appeals jurisdiction to hear ap-\n peals from “final decisions” of the district courts. The general rule\n2                        PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    that an order denying a summary judgment motion is not a “final de-\n    cision[n],” and thus not immediately appealable, does not apply when\n    it is based on a qualified immunity claim. Johnson v. Jones, 515\n    U. S. 304, 311. Respondent argues that Johnson forecloses appellate\n    jurisdiction here, but the order in Johnson was not immediately ap-\n    pealable because it merely decided “a question of ‘evidence sufficien-\n    cy,’ ” id., at 313, while here, petitioners’ qualified immunity claims\n    raise legal issues quite different from any purely factual issues that\n    might be confronted at trial. Deciding such legal issues is a core re-\n    sponsibility of appellate courts and does not create an undue burden\n    for them. See, e.g., Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372. Pp. 5–7.\n       2. The officers’ conduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n    Pp. 7–15.\n          (a) Addressing this question first will be “beneficial” in “devel-\n    op[ing] constitutional precedent” in an area that courts typically con-\n    sider in cases in which the defendant asserts a qualified immunity\n    defense, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236. Pp. 7–8.\n          (b) Respondent’s excessive-force argument requires analyzing the\n    totality of the circumstances from the perspective “of a reasonable of-\n    ficer on the scene.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396. Respond-\n    ent contends that the Fourth Amendment did not allow the officers to\n    use deadly force to terminate the chase, and that, even if they were\n    permitted to fire their weapons, they went too far when they fired as\n    many rounds as they did. Pp. 8–12.\n            (1) The officers acted reasonably in using deadly force. A “po-\n    lice officer’s attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase\n    that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the\n    Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk\n    of serious injury or death.” Scott, supra, at 385. Rickard’s outra-\n    geously reckless driving—which lasted more than five minutes, ex-\n    ceeded 100 miles per hour, and included the passing of more than two\n    dozen other motorists—posed a grave public safety risk, and the rec-\n    ord conclusively disproves that the chase was over when Rickard’s\n    car came to a temporary standstill and officers began shooting. Un-\n    der the circumstances when the shots were fired, all that a reasona-\n    ble officer could have concluded from Rickard’s conduct was that he\n    was intent on resuming his flight, which would again pose a threat to\n    others on the road. Pp. 9–11.\n            (2) Petitioners did not fire more shots than necessary to end\n    the public safety risk. It makes sense that, if officers are justified in\n    firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety,\n    they need not stop shooting until the threat has ended. Here, during\n    the 10-second span when all the shots were fired, Rickard never\n    abandoned his attempt to flee and eventually managed to drive away.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

United States,\n  394 U. S. 165, 174. Pp. 11–12.\n     3. Even if the officers’ conduct had violated the Fourth Amend-\n  ment, petitioners would still be entitled to summary judgment based\n  on qualified immunity. An official sued under §1983 is entitled to\n  qualified immunity unless it is shown that the official violated a\n  statutory or constitutional right that was “ ‘clearly established’ ” at\n  the time of the challenged conduct. Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___,\n  ___. Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 201, where an officer shot at\n  a fleeing vehicle to prevent possible harm, makes plain that no clear-\n  ly established law precluded the officer’s conduct there. Thus, to pre-\n  vail, respondent must meaningfully distinguish Brosseau or point to\n  any “controlling authority” or “robust ‘consensus of cases of persua-\n  sive authority,’ ” al-Kidd, supra, at ___, that emerged between the\n  events there and those here that would alter the qualified-immunity\n  analysis. Respondent has made neither showing. If anything, the\n  facts here are more favorable to the officers than the facts in\n  Brosseau; and respondent points to no cases that could be said to\n  have clearly established the unconstitutionality of using lethal force\n  to end a high-speed car chase.

Near midnight on July 18,\n2004, Lieutenant Joseph Forthman of the West Memphis,\nArkansas, Police Department pulled over a white Honda\nAccord because the car had only one operating headlight.\nDonald Rickard was the driver of the Accord, and Kelly\nAllen was in the passenger seat. Forthman noticed an\nindentation, “ ‘roughly the size of a head or a basketball’ ”\nin the windshield of the car. Estate of Allen v. West Mem-\nphis, 2011 WL 197426, *1 (WD Tenn., Jan. 20, 2011). He\nasked Rickard if he had been drinking, and Rickard re­\nsponded that he had not. Because Rickard failed to pro­\nduce his driver’s license upon request and appeared nerv­\nous, Forthman asked him to step out of the car. Rather\nthan comply with Forthman’s request, Rickard sped away.\n   Forthman gave chase and was soon joined by five other\npolice cruisers driven by Sergeant Vance Plumhoff and\nOfficers Jimmy Evans, Lance Ellis, Troy Galtelli, and\nJohn Gardner. The officers pursued Rickard east on In­\nterstate 40 toward Memphis, Tennessee. While on I–40,\nthey attempted to stop Rickard using a “rolling roadblock,”\nid., at *2, but they were unsuccessful. The District Court\ndescribed the vehicles as “swerving through traffic at high\nspeeds,” id., at *8, and respondent does not dispute that\nthe cars attained speeds over 100 miles per hour.1 See\nMemorandum of Law in Response to Defendants’ Motion\nfor Summary Judgment in No. 2:05–cv–2585 (WD Tenn.),\np. 16; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 54:23–55:6. During the\n——————\n    1 It\n      is also undisputed that Forthman saw glass shavings on the\ndashboard of Rickard’s car, a sign that the windshield had been broken\nrecently; that another officer testified that the windshield indentation\nand glass shavings would have justified a suspicion “ ‘that someone had\npossibly been struck by that vehicle, like a pedestrian’ ”; and that\nForthman saw beer in Rickard’s car. See App. 424–426 (Response to\nDefendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in No. 2:05–cv–\n2585 (WD Tenn.), ¶¶15–19).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchase, Rickard and the officers passed more than two\ndozen vehicles.\n   Rickard eventually exited I–40 in Memphis, and shortly\nafterward he made “a quick right turn,” causing “contact\n[to] occu[r]” between his car and Evans’ cruiser. 2011 WL\n197426, *3. As a result of that contact, Rickard’s car spun\nout into a parking lot and collided with Plumhoff ’s cruiser.\nNow in danger of being cornered, Rickard put his car into\nreverse “in an attempt to escape.” Ibid. As he did so,\nEvans and Plumhoff got out of their cruisers and ap­\nproached Rickard’s car, and Evans, gun in hand, pounded\non the passenger-side window. At that point, Rickard’s\ncar “made contact with” yet another police cruiser. Ibid.\nRickard’s tires started spinning, and his car “was rocking\nback and forth,” ibid., indicating that Rickard was using\nthe accelerator even though his bumper was flush against\na police cruiser. At that point, Plumhoff fired three shots\ninto Rickard’s car. Rickard then “reversed in a 180 degree\narc” and “maneuvered onto” another street, forcing Ellis to\n“step to his right to avoid the vehicle.” Ibid. As Rickard\ncontinued “fleeing down” that street, ibid., Gardner and\nGaltelli fired 12 shots toward Rickard’s car, bringing the\ntotal number of shots fired during this incident to 15.\nRickard then lost control of the car and crashed into a\nbuilding. Ibid. Rickard and Allen both died from some\ncombination of gunshot wounds and injuries suffered in\nthe crash that ended the chase. See App. 60, 76.\n                              B\n  Respondent, Rickard’s surviving daughter, filed this\naction under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, against\nthe six individual police officers and the mayor and chief\nof police of West Memphis. She alleged that the officers\nused excessive force in violation of the Fourth and Four­\nteenth Amendments.\n  The officers moved for summary judgment based on\n4                     PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nqualified immunity, but the District Court denied that\nmotion, holding that the officers’ conduct violated the\nFourth Amendment and was contrary to law that was\nclearly established at the time in question. The officers\nappealed, but a Sixth Circuit motions panel initially dis­\nmissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on this\nCourt’s decision in Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 309\n(1995). Later, however, that panel granted rehearing,\nvacated its dismissal order, and left the jurisdictional\nissue to be decided by a merits panel.\n   The merits panel then affirmed the District Court’s\ndecision on the merits. Estate of Allen v. West Memphis,\n509 Fed. Appx. 388 (CA6 2012). On the issue of appellate\njurisdiction, the merits panel began by stating that a\n“motion for qualified immunity denied on the basis of a\ndistrict court’s determination that there exists a triable\nissue of fact generally cannot be appealed on an interlocu­\ntory basis.” Id., at 391. But the panel then noted that the\nSixth Circuit had previously interpreted our decision in\nScott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372 (2007), as creating an “ex­\nception to this rule” under which an immediate appeal\nmay be taken to challenge “ ‘blatantly and demonstrably\nfalse’ ” factual determinations. 509 Fed. Appx., at 391\n(quoting Moldowan v. Warren, 578 F. 3d 351, 370 (CA6\n2009)). Concluding that none of the District Court’s fac-\ntual determinations ran afoul of that high standard, and\ndistinguishing the facts of this case from those in Scott,\nthe panel held that the officers’ conduct violated the\nFourth Amendment. 509 Fed. Appx., at 392, and n. 3.\nThe panel said nothing about whether the officers violated\nclearly established law, but since the panel affirmed the\norder denying the officers’ summary judgment motion,2\n——————\n  2 After expressing some confusion about whether it should dismiss or\n\naffirm, the panel wrote that “it would seem that what we are doing is\naffirming [the District Court’s] judgment.” 509 Fed. Appx., at 393.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe panel must have decided that issue in respondent’s\nfavor.\n  We granted certiorari. 571 U. S. ____ (2013).\n                              II\n   We start with the question whether the Court of Ap­\npeals properly exercised jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n§1291, which gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction to\nhear appeals from “final decisions” of the district courts.\n   An order denying a motion for summary judgment is\ngenerally not a final decision within the meaning of §1291\nand is thus generally not immediately appealable. John-\nson, 515 U. S., at 309. But that general rule does not\napply when the summary judgment motion is based on a\nclaim of qualified immunity. Id., at 311; Mitchell v. For-\nsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 528 (1985). “[Q]ualified immunity is\n‘an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to\nliability.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 231 (2009)\n(quoting Mitchell, supra, at 526). As a result, pretrial\norders denying qualified immunity generally fall within\nthe collateral order doctrine. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556\nU. S. 662, 671–672 (2009). This is so because such orders\nconclusively determine whether the defendant is entitled\nto immunity from suit; this immunity issue is both im­\nportant and completely separate from the merits of the\naction, and this question could not be effectively reviewed\non appeal from a final judgment because by that time the\nimmunity from standing trial will have been irretrievably\nlost. See ibid; Johnson, supra, at 311–312 (citing Mitchell,\nsupra, at 525–527).\n   Respondent argues that our decision in Johnson, fore­\ncloses appellate jurisdiction under the circumstances here,\nbut the order from which the appeal was taken in Johnson\nwas quite different from the order in the present case. In\nJohnson, the plaintiff brought suit against certain police\nofficers who, he alleged, had beaten him. 515 U. S., at\n6                  PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n307. These officers moved for summary judgment, assert­\ning that they were not present at the time of the alleged\nbeating and had nothing to do with it. Id., at 307–308.\nThe District Court determined, however, that the evidence\nin the summary judgment record was sufficient to support\na contrary finding, and the court therefore denied the\nofficers’ motion for summary judgment. Id., at 308. The\nofficers then appealed, arguing that the District Court had\nnot correctly analyzed the relevant evidence. Ibid.\n   This Court held that the Johnson order was not imme­\ndiately appealable because it merely decided “a question of\n‘evidence sufficiency,’ i.e., which facts a party may, or may\nnot, be able to prove at trial.” Id., at 313. The Court noted\nthat an order denying summary judgment based on a\ndetermination of “evidence sufficiency” does not present a\nlegal question in the sense in which the term was used in\nMitchell, the decision that first held that a pretrial order\nrejecting a claim of qualified immunity is immediately\nappealable. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 314. In addition, the\nCourt observed that a determination of evidence sufficiency\nis closely related to other determinations that the trial\ncourt may be required to make at later stages of the case.\nId., at 317. The Court also noted that appellate courts\nhave “no comparative expertise” over trial courts in mak­\ning such determinations and that forcing appellate courts\nto entertain appeals from such orders would impose an\nundue burden. Id., at 309–310, 316.\n   The District Court order in this case is nothing like the\norder in Johnson. Petitioners do not claim that other\nofficers were responsible for shooting Rickard; rather, they\ncontend that their conduct did not violate the Fourth\nAmendment and, in any event, did not violate clearly\nestablished law. Thus, they raise legal issues; these issues\nare quite different from any purely factual issues that the\ntrial court might confront if the case were tried; deciding\nlegal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts, and requiring appellate courts to decide such is­\nsues is not an undue burden.\n  The District Court order here is not materially distin­\nguishable from the District Court order in Scott v. Harris,\nand in that case we expressed no doubts about the juris­\ndiction of the Court of Appeals under §1291. Accordingly,\nhere, as in Scott, we hold that the Court of Appeals prop-\nerly exercised jurisdiction, and we therefore turn to the\nmerits.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   Petitioners contend that the decision of the Court of\nAppeals is wrong for two separate reasons. They maintain\nthat they did not violate Rickard’s Fourth Amendment\nrights and that, in any event, their conduct did not violate\nany Fourth Amendment rule that was clearly established\nat the time of the events in question. When confronted\nwith such arguments, we held in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S.\n194, 200 (2001), that “the first inquiry must be whether a\nconstitutional right would have been violated on the facts\nalleged.” Only after deciding that question, we concluded,\nmay an appellate court turn to the question whether the\nright at issue was clearly established at the relevant time.\nIbid.\n   We subsequently altered this rigid framework in Pear-\nson, declaring that “Saucier’s procedure should not be\nregarded as an inflexible requirement.” 555 U. S., at 227.\nAt the same time, however, we noted that the Saucier\nprocedure “is often beneficial” because it “promotes the\ndevelopment of constitutional precedent and is especially\nvaluable with respect to questions that do not frequently\narise in cases in which a qualified immunity defense is\nunavailable.” 555 U. S., at 236. Pearson concluded that\ncourts “have the discretion to decide whether that [Sau-\ncier] procedure is worthwhile in particular cases.” Id., at\n8                  PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n242.\n  Heeding our guidance in Pearson, we begin in this case\nwith the question whether the officers’ conduct violated\nthe Fourth Amendment. This approach, we believe, will\nbe “beneficial” in “develop[ing] constitutional precedent” in\nan area that courts typically consider in cases in which the\ndefendant asserts a qualified immunity defense. See\nPearson, supra, at 236.\n                               B\n   A claim that law-enforcement officers used excessive\nforce to effect a seizure is governed by the Fourth\nAmendment’s “reasonableness” standard. See Graham v.\nConnor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989); Tennessee v. Garner, 471\nU. S. 1 (1985). In Graham, we held that determining the\nobjective reasonableness of a particular seizure under the\nFourth Amendment “requires a careful balancing of the\nnature and quality of the intrusion on the individual’s\nFourth Amendment interests against the countervailing\ngovernmental interests at stake.” 490 U. S., at 396 (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted). The inquiry requires ana­\nlyzing the totality of the circumstances. See ibid.\n   We analyze this question from the perspective “of a\nreasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20\nvision of hindsight.” Ibid. We thus “allo[w] for the fact\nthat police officers are often forced to make split-second\njudgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain,\nand rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is\nnecessary in a particular situation.” Id., at 396–397.\n   In this case, respondent advances two main Fourth\nAmendment arguments. First, she contends that the\nFourth Amendment did not allow petitioners to use deadly\nforce to terminate the chase. See Brief for Respondent 24–\n35. Second, she argues that the “degree of force was ex­\ncessive,” that is, that even if the officers were permitted to\nfire their weapons, they went too far when they fired as\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmany rounds as they did. See id., at 36–38. We address\neach issue in turn.\n                              1\n   In Scott, we considered a claim that a police officer\nviolated the Fourth Amendment when he terminated a\nhigh-speed car chase by using a technique that placed a\n“fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.” 550\nU. S., at 386. The record in that case contained a vide­\notape of the chase, and we found that the events recorded\non the tape justified the officer’s conduct. We wrote as\nfollows: “Although there is no obvious way to quantify the\nrisks on either side, it is clear from the videotape that\nrespondent posed an actual and imminent threat to the\nlives of any pedestrians who might have been present, to\nother civilian motorists, and to the officers involved in the\nchase.” Id., at 383–384. We also wrote:\n    “[R]espondent’s vehicle rac[ed] down narrow, two-lane\n    roads in the dead of night at speeds that are shock-\n    ingly fast. We see it swerve around more than a dozen\n    other cars, cross the double-yellow line, and force cars\n    traveling in both directions to their respective shoul­\n    ders to avoid being hit. We see it run multiple red\n    lights and travel for considerable periods of time in\n    the occasional center left-turn-only lane, chased by\n    numerous police cars forced to engage in the same\n    hazardous maneuvers just to keep up.” Id., at 379–\n    380 (footnote omitted).\n  In light of those facts, “we [thought] it [was] quite clear\nthat [the police officer] did not violate the Fourth Amend­\nment.” Id., at 381. We held that a “police officer’s attempt\nto terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that\nthreatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing\n10                     PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmotorist at risk of serious injury or death.”3 Id., at 386.\n  We see no basis for reaching a different conclusion here.\nAs we have explained supra, at ___, the chase in this case\nexceeded 100 miles per hour and lasted over five minutes.\nDuring that chase, Rickard passed more than two dozen\nother vehicles, several of which were forced to alter course.\nRickard’s outrageously reckless driving posed a grave\npublic safety risk. And while it is true that Rickard’s car\neventually collided with a police car and came temporarily\nto a near standstill, that did not end the chase. Less than\nthree seconds later, Rickard resumed maneuvering his\ncar. Just before the shots were fired, when the front\nbumper of his car was flush with that of one of the police\ncruisers, Rickard was obviously pushing down on the\naccelerator because the car’s wheels were spinning, and\nthen Rickard threw the car into reverse “in an attempt to\nescape.” Thus, the record conclusively disproves respond­\nent’s claim that the chase in the present case was already\nover when petitioners began shooting. Under the circum­\nstances at the moment when the shots were fired, all that\na reasonable police officer could have concluded was that\nRickard was intent on resuming his flight and that, if he\nwas allowed to do so, he would once again pose a deadly\nthreat for others on the road. Rickard’s conduct even after\nthe shots were fired—as noted, he managed to drive away\ndespite the efforts of the police to block his path—\n——————\n  3 In holding that petitioners’ conduct violated the Fourth Amend­\nment, the District Court relied on reasoning that is irreconcilable with\nour decision in Scott. The District Court held that the danger presented\nby a high-speed chase cannot justify the use of deadly force because\nthat danger was caused by the officers’ decision to continue the chase.\nEstate of Allen v. West Memphis, 2011 WL 197426, *8 (WD Tenn., Jan.\n20, 2011). In Scott, however, we declined to “lay down a rule requiring\nthe police to allow fleeing suspects to get away whenever they drive so\nrecklessly that they put other people’s lives in danger,” concluding that\nthe Constitution “assuredly does not impose this invitation to impunity­\nearned-by-recklessness.” 550 U. S., at 385–386.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nunderscores the point.\n  In light of the circumstances we have discussed, it is\nbeyond serious dispute that Rickard’s flight posed a grave\npublic safety risk, and here, as in Scott, the police acted\nreasonably in using deadly force to end that risk.\n                                 2\n   We now consider respondent’s contention that, even if\nthe use of deadly force was permissible, petitioners acted\nunreasonably in firing a total of 15 shots. We reject that\nargument. It stands to reason that, if police officers are\njustified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe\nthreat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting\nuntil the threat has ended. As petitioners noted below, “if\nlethal force is justified, officers are taught to keep shooting\nuntil the threat is over.” 509 Fed. Appx., at 392.\n   Here, during the 10-second span when all the shots were\nfired, Rickard never abandoned his attempt to flee. In­\ndeed, even after all the shots had been fired, he managed\nto drive away and to continue driving until he crashed.\nThis would be a different case if petitioners had initiated a\nsecond round of shots after an initial round had clearly\nincapacitated Rickard and had ended any threat of con­\ntinued flight, or if Rickard had clearly given himself up.\nBut that is not what happened.\n   In arguing that too many shots were fired, respondent\nrelies in part on the presence of Kelly Allen in the front\nseat of the car, but we do not think that this factor\nchanges the calculus. Our cases make it clear that “Fourth\nAmendment rights are personal rights which . . . may not\nbe vicariously asserted.” Alderman v. United States, 394\nU. S. 165, 174 (1969); see also Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S.\n128, 138–143 (1978). Thus, the question before us is\nwhether petitioners violated Rickard’s Fourth Amendment\nrights, not Allen’s. If a suit were brought on behalf of\nAllen under either §1983 or state tort law, the risk to\n12                    PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nAllen would be of central concern.4 But Allen’s presence in\nthe car cannot enhance Rickard’s Fourth Amendment\nrights. After all, it was Rickard who put Allen in danger\nby fleeing and refusing to end the chase, and it would be\nperverse if his disregard for Allen’s safety worked to his\nbenefit.\n                               C\n   We have held that petitioners’ conduct did not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment, but even if that were not the case,\npetitioners would still be entitled to summary judgment\nbased on qualified immunity.\n   An official sued under §1983 is entitled to qualified\nimmunity unless it is shown that the official violated a\nstatutory or constitutional right that was “ ‘clearly estab­\nlished’ ” at the time of the challenged conduct. Ashcroft v.\nal-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3). And a\ndefendant cannot be said to have violated a clearly estab­\nlished right unless the right’s contours were sufficiently\ndefinite that any reasonable official in the defendant’s\nshoes would have understood that he was violating it. Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9). In other words, “existing precedent\nmust have placed the statutory or constitutional question”\nconfronted by the official “beyond debate.” Ibid. In addi­\ntion, “[w]e have repeatedly told courts . . . not to define\nclearly established law at a high level of generality,” id., at\n——————\n  4 There seems to be some disagreement among lower courts as to\nwhether a passenger in Allen’s situation can recover under a Fourth\nAmendment theory. Compare Vaughan v. Cox, 343 F. 3d 1323 (CA11\n2003) (suggesting yes), and Fisher v. Memphis, 234 F. 3d 312 (CA6\n2000) (same), with Milstead v. Kibler, 243 F. 3d 157 (CA4 2001) (sug­\ngesting no), and Landol-Rivera v. Cruz Cosme, 906 F. 2d 791 (CA1\n1990) (same). We express no view on this question. We also note that\nin County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 836 (1998), the Court\nheld that a passenger killed as a result of a police chase could recover\nunder a substantive due process theory only if the officer had “a pur­\npose to cause harm unrelated to the legitimate object of arrest.”\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n___ (slip op., at 10), since doing so avoids the crucial ques­\ntion whether the official acted reasonably in the particular\ncircumstances that he or she faced. We think our deci­\nsion in Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194 (2004) (per\ncuriam) squarely demonstrates that no clearly established\nlaw precluded petitioners’ conduct at the time in question.\nIn Brosseau, we held that a police officer did not violate\nclearly established law when she fired at a fleeing vehicle\nto prevent possible harm to “other officers on foot who\n[she] believed were in the immediate area, . . . occupied\nvehicles in [the driver’s] path[,] and . . . any other citizens\nwho might be in the area.” Id., at 197 (quoting 339 F. 3d\n857, 865 (CA9 2003); internal quotation marks omitted).\nAfter surveying lower court decisions regarding the rea­\nsonableness of lethal force as a response to vehicular\nflight, we observed that this is an area “in which the result\ndepends very much on the facts of each case” and that the\ncases “by no means ‘clearly establish[ed]’ that [the of­\nficer’s] conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.” 543\nU. S., at 201. In reaching that conclusion, we held that\nGarner and Graham, which are “cast at a high level of\ngenerality,” did not clearly establish that the officer’s\ndecision was unreasonable. 543 U. S., at 199.\n   Brosseau makes plain that as of February 21, 1999—the\ndate of the events at issue in that case—it was not clearly\nestablished that it was unconstitutional to shoot a fleeing\ndriver to protect those whom his flight might endanger.\nWe did not consider later decided cases because they\n“could not have given fair notice to [the officer].” Id., at\n200, n. 4. To defeat immunity here, then, respondent\nmust show at a minimum either (1) that the officers’ con­\nduct in this case was materially different from the conduct\nin Brosseau or (2) that between February 21, 1999, and\nJuly 18, 2004, there emerged either “ ‘controlling authority’ ”\nor a “robust ‘consensus of cases of persuasive authority,’ ”\nal-Kidd, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting Wilson\n14                 PLUMHOFF v. RICKARD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999); some internal quota­\ntion marks omitted), that would alter our analysis of the\nqualified immunity question. Respondent has made nei­\nther showing.\n   To begin, certain facts here are more favorable to the\nofficers. In Brosseau, an officer on foot fired at a driver\nwho had just begun to flee and who had not yet driven his\ncar in a dangerous manner. In contrast, the officers here\nshot at Rickard to put an end to what had already been a\nlengthy, high-speed pursuit that indisputably posed a\ndanger both to the officers involved and to any civilians\nwho happened to be nearby. Indeed, the lone dissenting\nJustice in Brosseau emphasized that in that case, “there\nwas no ongoing or prior high-speed car chase to inform the\n[constitutional] analysis.” 543 U. S., at 206, n. 4 (opinion\nof Stevens, J.). Attempting to distinguish Brosseau, re­\nspondent focuses on the fact that the officer there fired\nonly 1 shot, whereas here three officers collectively fired\n15 shots. But it was certainly not clearly established at\nthe time of the shooting in this case that the number of\nshots fired, under the circumstances present here, ren­\ndered the use of force excessive.\n   Since respondent cannot meaningfully distinguish\nBrosseau, her only option is to show that its analysis was\nout of date by 2004. Yet respondent has not pointed us to\nany case—let alone a controlling case or a robust consen­\nsus of cases—decided between 1999 and 2004 that could\nbe said to have clearly established the unconstitutionality\nof using lethal force to end a high-speed car chase. And\nrespondent receives no help on this front from the opinions\nbelow. The District Court cited only a single case decided\nbetween 1999 and 2004 that identified a possible constitu­\ntional violation by an officer who shot a fleeing driver, and\nthe facts of that case—where a reasonable jury could have\nconcluded that the suspect merely “accelerated to eighty to\neighty-five miles per hour in a seventy-miles-per-hour\n                 Cite as: 572 U.
