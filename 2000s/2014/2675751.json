BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 12–515.      Argued December 2, 2013—Decided May 27, 2014\nThe State of Michigan, petitioner, entered into a compact with respond-\n  ent Bay Mills Indian Community pursuant to the Indian Gaming\n  Regulatory Act (IGRA). See 25 U. S. C. §2710(d)(1)(C). The compact\n  authorizes Bay Mills to conduct class III gaming activities (i.e., to op-\n  erate a casino) on Indian lands located within the State’s borders, but\n  prohibits it from doing so outside that territory. Bay Mills later\n  opened a second casino on land it had purchased through a congres-\n  sionally established land trust. The Tribe claimed it could operate a\n  casino there because the property qualified as Indian land. Michigan\n  disagreed and sued the Tribe under §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), which allows a\n  State to enjoin “class III gaming activity located on Indian lands and\n  conducted in violation of any Tribal-State compact.” The District\n  Court granted the injunction, but the Sixth Circuit vacated. It held\n  that tribal sovereign immunity barred the suit unless Congress pro-\n  vided otherwise, and that §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) only authorized suits to\n  enjoin gaming activity located “on Indian lands,” whereas Michigan’s\n  complaint alleged the casino was outside such territory.\nHeld: Michigan’s suit against Bay Mills is barred by tribal sovereign\n immunity. Pp. 4–21.\n    (a) As “ ‘domestic dependent nations,’ ” Indian tribes exercise “in-\n herent sovereign authority” that is subject to plenary control by Con-\n gress. Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of\n Okla., 498 U. S. 505, 509. Unless and “until Congress acts, the tribes\n retain” their historic sovereign authority. United States v. Wheeler,\n 435 U. S. 313, 323. Among the core aspects of sovereignty that tribes\n possess—subject to congressional action—is the “common-law im-\n munity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers.” Santa\n Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 58. That immunity applies\n2           MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    whether a suit is brought by a State, see, e.g., Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v.\n    Department of Game of Wash., 433 U. S. 165, or arises from a tribe’s\n    commercial activities off Indian lands, see Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v.\n    Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751. Therefore, unless\n    Congress has “unequivocally” authorized Michigan’s suit, C & L En-\n    terprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 532 U. S.\n    411, 418, it must be dismissed. Pp. 4–8.\n       (b) IGRA’s plain terms do not authorize this suit.             Section\n    2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) partially abrogates tribal immunity with respect to\n    class III gaming located “on Indian lands,” but the very premise of\n    Michigan’s suit is that Bay Mills’ casino is unlawful because it is out-\n    side Indian lands. Michigan argues that the casino is authorized, li-\n    censed, and operated from within the reservation, and that such ad-\n    ministrative action constitutes “class III gaming activity.” However,\n    numerous other IGRA provisions make clear that “class III gaming\n    activity” refers to the gambling that goes on in a casino, not the off-\n    site licensing of such games. See, e.g., §§2710(d)(3)(C)(i), (d)(9).\n    IGRA’s history and design also explain why Congress would have au-\n    thorized a State to enjoin illegal tribal gaming on Indian lands but\n    not on lands subject to the State’s own sovereign jurisdiction. Con-\n    gress adopted IGRA in response to California v. Cabazon Band of\n    Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202, 221–222, which held that States\n    lacked regulatory authority over gaming on Indian lands but left in-\n    tact States’ regulatory power over tribal gaming outside Indian terri-\n    tory. A State therefore has many tools to enforce its law on state\n    land that it does not possess in Indian territory, including, e.g., bring-\n    ing a civil or criminal action against tribal officials rather than the\n    tribe itself for conducting illegal gaming. A State can also use its lev-\n    erage in negotiating an IGRA compact to bargain for a waiver of the\n    tribe’s immunity. Pp. 8–14.\n       (c) Michigan urges the Court to overrule Kiowa and hold that tribal\n    immunity does not apply to commercial activity outside Indian terri-\n    tory. However, “any departure” from precedent “demands special jus-\n    tification,” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212, and Michigan of-\n    fers nothing more than arguments already rejected in Kiowa. Kiowa\n    rejected these arguments because it is fundamentally Congress’s job\n    to determine whether or how to limit tribal immunity; Congress had\n    restricted tribal immunity “in limited circumstances” like\n    §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), while “in other statutes” declaring an “intention\n    not to alter it.” 523 U. S., at 758. Kiowa therefore chose to “defer to\n    the role Congress may wish to exercise in this important judgment.”\n    Ibid. Congress has since reflected on Kiowa and decided to retain\n    tribal immunity in a case like this.

BAY MILLS INDIAN \n\n               COMMUNITY ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                  [May 27, 2014] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The question in this case is whether tribal sovereign\nimmunity bars Michigan’s suit against the Bay Mills\nIndian Community for opening a casino outside Indian\nlands. We hold that immunity protects Bay Mills from\nthis legal action. Congress has not abrogated tribal sover-\neign immunity from a State’s suit to enjoin gaming off a\nreservation or other Indian lands. And we decline to\nrevisit our prior decisions holding that, absent such an\nabrogation (or a waiver), Indian tribes have immunity\neven when a suit arises from off-reservation commercial\nactivity. Michigan must therefore resort to other mecha-\nnisms, including legal actions against the responsible\nindividuals, to resolve this dispute.\n                            I\n  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA or Act), 102\nStat. 2467, 25 U. S. C. §2701 et seq., creates a framework\nfor regulating gaming activity on Indian lands.1 See\n——————\n  1 The Act defines “Indian lands” as “(A) all lands within the limits of\n\nany Indian reservation; and (B) any lands title to which is either held\n2        MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n§2702(3) (describing the statute’s purpose as establishing\n“regulatory authority . . . [and] standards for gaming on\nIndian lands”). The Act divides gaming into three classes.\nClass III gaming, the most closely regulated and the kind\ninvolved here, includes casino games, slot machines, and\nhorse racing. See §2703(8). A tribe may conduct such\ngaming on Indian lands only pursuant to, and in compli-\nance with, a compact it has negotiated with the sur-\nrounding State. See §2710(d)(1)(C). A compact typically\nprescribes rules for operating gaming, allocates law\nenforcement authority between the tribe and State, and\nprovides remedies for breach of the agreement’s terms.\nSee §§2710(d)(3)(C)(ii), (v). Notable here, IGRA itself\nauthorizes a State to bring suit against a tribe for certain\nconduct violating a compact: Specifically, §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii)\nallows a State to sue in federal court to “enjoin a class III\ngaming activity located on Indian lands and conducted in\nviolation of any Tribal-State compact . . . that is in effect.”\n  Pursuant to the Act, Michigan and Bay Mills, a federally\nrecognized Indian Tribe, entered into a compact in 1993.\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a–96a. The compact empow-\ners Bay Mills to conduct class III gaming on “Indian\nlands”; conversely, it prohibits the Tribe from doing so\noutside that territory. Id., at 78a, 83a; see n. 1, supra.\nThe compact also contains a dispute resolution mecha-\nnism, which sends to arbitration any contractual differ-\nences the parties cannot settle on their own. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 89a–90a. A provision within that arbitration\nsection states that “[n]othing in this Compact shall be\ndeemed a waiver” of either the Tribe’s or the State’s sover-\neign immunity. Id., at 90a. Since entering into the com-\n\n——————\nin trust by the United States for the benefit of any Indian tribe or\nindividual[,] or held by any Indian tribe or individual subject to re-\nstriction by the United States against alienation and over which an\nIndian tribe exercises governmental power.” §2703(4).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npact, Bay Mills has operated class III gaming, as author-\nized, on its reservation in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.\n   In 2010, Bay Mills opened another class III gaming\nfacility in Vanderbilt, a small village in Michigan’s Lower\nPeninsula about 125 miles from the Tribe’s reservation.\nBay Mills had bought the Vanderbilt property with ac-\ncrued interest from a federal appropriation, which Con-\ngress had made to compensate the Tribe for 19th-century\ntakings of its ancestral lands. See Michigan Indian Land\nClaims Settlement Act, 111 Stat. 2652. Congress had\ndirected that a portion of the appropriated funds go into a\n“Land Trust” whose earnings the Tribe was to use to\nimprove or purchase property. According to the legisla-\ntion, any land so acquired “shall be held as Indian lands\nare held.” §107(a)(3), id., at 2658. Citing that provision,\nBay Mills contended that the Vanderbilt property was\n“Indian land” under IGRA and the compact; and the Tribe\nthus claimed authority to operate a casino there.\n   Michigan disagreed: The State sued Bay Mills in federal\ncourt to enjoin operation of the new casino, alleging that\nthe facility violated IGRA and the compact because it was\nlocated outside Indian lands. The same day Michigan filed\nsuit, the federal Department of the Interior issued an\nopinion concluding (as the State’s complaint said) that the\nTribe’s use of Land Trust earnings to purchase the Van-\nderbilt property did not convert it into Indian territory.\nSee App. 69–101. The District Court entered a prelimi-\nnary injunction against Bay Mills, which promptly shut\ndown the new casino and took an interlocutory appeal.\nWhile that appeal was pending, Michigan amended its\ncomplaint to join various tribal officials as defendants, as\nwell as to add state law and federal common law claims.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit then vacated\nthe injunction, holding (among other things) that tribal\nsovereign immunity barred Michigan’s suit against Bay\nMills unless Congress provided otherwise, and that\n4           MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n§2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) did not authorize the action. See 695\nF. 3d 406, 413–415 (2012). That provision of IGRA, the\nSixth Circuit reasoned, permitted a suit against the Tribe\nto enjoin only gaming activity located on Indian lands,\nwhereas the State’s complaint alleged that the Vanderbilt\ncasino was outside such territory. See id., at 412.2 Ac-\ncordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that Michigan\ncould proceed, if at all, solely against the individual de-\nfendants, and it remanded to the District Court to consider\nthose claims. See id., at 416–417.3 Although no injunc-\ntion is currently in effect, Bay Mills has not reopened the\nVanderbilt casino.\n   We granted certiorari to consider whether tribal sover-\neign immunity bars Michigan’s suit against Bay Mills, 570\nU. S. __ (2013), and we now affirm the Court of Appeals’\njudgment.\n                           II\n  Indian tribes are “ ‘domestic dependent nations’ ” that\nexercise “inherent sovereign authority.” Oklahoma Tax\n——————\n    2 TheSixth Circuit framed part of its analysis in jurisdictional terms,\nholding that the District Court had no authority to consider Michigan’s\nIGRA claim because §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) provides federal jurisdiction only\nover suits to enjoin gaming on Indian lands (and Michigan’s suit was\nnot that). See 695 F. 3d, at 412–413. That reasoning is wrong, as all\nparties agree. See Brief for Michigan 22–25; Brief for Bay Mills 23–24;\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16–17. The general federal-\nquestion statute, 28 U. S. C. §1331, gives a district court subject matter\njurisdiction to decide any claim alleging a violation of IGRA. Nothing\nin §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) or any other provision of IGRA limits that grant of\njurisdiction (although those provisions may indicate that a party has no\nstatutory right of action). See Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n\nof Md., 535 U. S. 635, 643–644 (2002).\n   3 The Court of Appeals’ decision applied not only to Michigan’s case,\n\nbut also to a consolidated case brought by the Little Traverse Bay\nBands of Odawa Indians, which operates a casino about 40 miles from\nthe Vanderbilt property. Little Traverse subsequently dismissed its\nsuit, rather than seek review in this Court.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nComm’n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498\nU. S. 505, 509 (1991) (Potawatomi) (quoting Cherokee\nNation v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1831)). As dependents, the\ntribes are subject to plenary control by Congress. See\nUnited States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 200 (2004) (“[T]he\nConstitution grants Congress” powers “we have consist-\nently described as ‘plenary and exclusive’ ” to “legislate in\nrespect to Indian tribes”). And yet they remain “separate\nsovereigns pre-existing the Constitution.” Santa Clara\nPueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 56 (1978). Thus, unless\nand “until Congress acts, the tribes retain” their historic\nsovereign authority. United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S.\n313, 323 (1978).\n   Among the core aspects of sovereignty that tribes pos-\nsess—subject, again, to congressional action—is the\n“common-law immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by\nsovereign powers.” Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U. S., at 58.\nThat immunity, we have explained, is “a necessary corol-\nlary to Indian sovereignty and self-governance.” Three\nAffiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold\nEngineering, P. C., 476 U. S. 877, 890 (1986); cf. The Fed-\neralist No. 81, p. 511 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton)\n(It is “inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be ame-\nnable” to suit without consent). And the qualified nature\nof Indian sovereignty modifies that principle only by plac-\ning a tribe’s immunity, like its other governmental powers\nand attributes, in Congress’s hands. See United States v.\nUnited States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506, 512\n(1940) (USF&G) (“It is as though the immunity which was\ntheirs as sovereigns passed to the United States for their\nbenefit”). Thus, we have time and again treated the “doc-\ntrine of tribal immunity [as] settled law” and dismissed\nany suit against a tribe absent congressional authorization\n(or a waiver). Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing\nTechnologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751, 756 (1998).\n   In doing so, we have held that tribal immunity applies\n6       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nno less to suits brought by States (including in their own\ncourts) than to those by individuals. First in Puyallup\nTribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Wash., 433 U. S. 165,\n167–168, 172–173 (1977), and then again in Potawatomi,\n498 U. S., at 509–510, we barred a State seeking to en-\nforce its laws from filing suit against a tribe, rejecting\narguments grounded in the State’s own sovereignty. In\neach case, we said a State must resort to other remedies,\neven if they would be less “efficient.” Id., at 514; see\nKiowa, 523 U. S., at 755 (“There is a difference between\nthe right to demand compliance with state laws and the\nmeans available to enforce them”). That is because, as we\nhave often stated (and contrary to the dissent’s novel\npronouncement, see post, at 3 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)\n(hereinafter the dissent)), tribal immunity “is a matter of\nfederal law and is not subject to diminution by the States.”\n523 U. S., at 756 (citing Three Affiliated Tribes, 476 U. S.,\nat 891; Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville\nReservation, 447 U. S. 134, 154 (1980)). Or as we else-\nwhere explained: While each State at the Constitutional\nConvention surrendered its immunity from suit by sister\nStates, “it would be absurd to suggest that the tribes”—at\na conference “to which they were not even parties”—\nsimilarly ceded their immunity against state-initiated\nsuits. Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S.\n775, 782 (1991).\n  Equally important here, we declined in Kiowa to make\nany exception for suits arising from a tribe’s commercial\nactivities, even when they take place off Indian lands. In\nthat case, a private party sued a tribe in state court for\ndefaulting on a promissory note. The plaintiff asked this\nCourt to confine tribal immunity to suits involving conduct\non “reservations or to noncommercial activities.” 523\nU. S., at 758. We said no. We listed Puyallup, Potawa-\ntomi, and USF&G as precedents applying immunity to a\nsuit predicated on a tribe’s commercial conduct—\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrespectively, fishing, selling cigarettes, and leasing coal\nmines. 523 U. S., at 754–755. Too, we noted that\nPuyallup involved enterprise “both on and off [the Tribe’s]\nreservation.” 523 U. S., at 754 (quoting 433 U. S., at 167).\n“[O]ur precedents,” we thus concluded, have not previously\n“drawn the[ ] distinctions” the plaintiff pressed in the case.\n523 U. S., at 755. They had established a broad principle,\nfrom which we thought it improper suddenly to start\ncarving out exceptions. Rather, we opted to “defer” to\nCongress about whether to abrogate tribal immunity for\noff-reservation commercial conduct. Id., at 758, 760; see\ninfra, at 17–18.\n  Our decisions establish as well that such a congressional\ndecision must be clear. The baseline position, we have\noften held, is tribal immunity; and “[t]o abrogate [such]\nimmunity, Congress must ‘unequivocally’ express that\npurpose.” C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Pota-\nwatomi Tribe of Okla., 532 U. S. 411, 418 (2001) (quoting\nSanta Clara Pueblo, 436 U. S., at 58). That rule of con-\nstruction reflects an enduring principle of Indian law:\nAlthough Congress has plenary authority over tribes,\ncourts will not lightly assume that Congress in fact in-\ntends to undermine Indian self-government. See, e.g., id.,\nat 58–60; Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9, 18\n(1987); United States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734, 738–739\n(1986).\n  The upshot is this: Unless Congress has authorized\nMichigan’s suit, our precedents demand that it be dis-\nmissed.4 And so Michigan, naturally enough, makes two\narguments: first, that IGRA indeed abrogates the Tribe’s\nimmunity from the State’s suit; and second, that if it\ndoes not, we should revisit—and reverse—our decision in\n——————\n  4 Michigan does not argue here that Bay Mills waived its immunity\n\nfrom suit. Recall that the compact expressly preserves both the Tribe’s\nand the State’s sovereign immunity. See supra, at 2.\n8       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nKiowa, so that tribal immunity no longer applies to claims\narising from commercial activity outside Indian lands. We\nconsider—and reject—each contention in turn.\n                               III\n   IGRA partially abrogates tribal sovereign immunity in\n§2710(d)(7)(A)(ii)—but this case, viewed most naturally,\nfalls outside that term’s ambit. The provision, as noted\nabove, authorizes a State to sue a tribe to “enjoin a class\nIII gaming activity located on Indian lands and conducted\nin violation of any Tribal-State compact.” See supra, at 2;\nKiowa, 523 U. S., at 758 (citing the provision as an exam-\nple of legislation “restrict[ing] tribal immunity from suit in\nlimited circumstances”). A key phrase in that abrogation\nis “on Indian lands”—three words reflecting IGRA’s over-\nall scope (and repeated some two dozen times in the stat-\nute). A State’s suit to enjoin gaming activity on Indian\nlands (assuming other requirements are met, see n. 6,\ninfra) falls within §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii); a similar suit to stop\ngaming activity off Indian lands does not. And that cre-\nates a fundamental problem for Michigan. After all, the\nvery premise of this suit—the reason Michigan thinks Bay\nMills is acting unlawfully—is that the Vanderbilt casino is\noutside Indian lands. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a–60a.\nBy dint of that theory, a suit to enjoin gaming in Vander-\nbilt is correspondingly outside §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii)’s abroga-\ntion of immunity.\n   Michigan first attempts to fit this suit within\n§2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) by relocating the “class III gaming activ-\nity” to which it is objecting. True enough, Michigan states,\nthe Vanderbilt casino lies outside Indian lands. But Bay\nMills “authorized, licensed, and operated” that casino from\nwithin its own reservation. Brief for Michigan 20. Accord-\ning to the State, that necessary administrative action—no\nless than, say, dealing craps—is “class III gaming activ-\nity,” and because it occurred on Indian land, this suit to\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nenjoin it can go forward.\n   But that argument comes up snake eyes, because nu-\nmerous provisions of IGRA show that “class III gaming\nactivity” means just what it sounds like—the stuff in-\nvolved in playing class III games.               For example,\n§2710(d)(3)(C)(i) refers to “the licensing and regulation of\n[a class III gaming] activity” and §2710(d)(9) concerns the\n“operation of a class III gaming activity.” Those phrases\nmake perfect sense if “class III gaming activity” is what\ngoes on in a casino—each roll of the dice and spin of the\nwheel. But they lose all meaning if, as Michigan argues,\n“class III gaming activity” refers equally to the off-site\nlicensing or operation of the games. (Just plug in those\nwords and see what happens.) See also §§2710(b)(2)(A),\n(b)(4)(A), (c)(4), (d)(1)(A) (similarly referring to class II or\nIII “gaming activity”). The same holds true throughout\nthe statute. Section 2717(a)(1) specifies fees to be paid by\n“each gaming operation that conducts a class II or class III\ngaming activity”—signifying that the gaming activity is\nthe gambling in the poker hall, not the proceedings of the\noff-site administrative authority. And §§2706(a)(5) and\n2713(b)(1) together describe a federal agency’s power to\n“clos[e] a gaming activity” for “substantial violation[s]” of\nlaw—e.g., to shut down crooked blackjack tables, not the\ntribal regulatory body meant to oversee them. Indeed,\nconsider IGRA’s very first finding: Many tribes, Congress\nstated, “have licensed gaming activities on Indian lands,”\nthereby necessitating federal regulation. §2701(1). The\n“gaming activit[y]” is (once again) the gambling. And that\nmeans §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) does not allow Michigan’s suit\neven if Bay Mills took action on its reservation to license\nor oversee the Vanderbilt facility.\n   Stymied under §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), Michigan next urges\nus to adopt a “holistic method” of interpreting IGRA that\nwould allow a State to sue a tribe for illegal gaming off, no\nless than on, Indian lands. Brief for Michigan 30. Michi-\n10        MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ngan asks here that we consider “IGRA’s text and structure\nas a whole.” Id., at 28. But (with one briefly raised excep-\ntion) Michigan fails to identify any specific textual or\nstructural features of the statute to support its proposed\nresult.5 Rather, Michigan highlights a (purported) anomaly\nof the statute as written: that it enables a State to sue a\ntribe for illegal gaming inside, but not outside, Indian\ncountry. “[W]hy,” Michigan queries, “would Congress\nauthorize a state to obtain a federal injunction against\nillegal tribal gaming on Indian lands, but not on lands\nsubject to the state’s own sovereign jurisdiction?” Reply\nBrief 1. That question has no answer, Michigan argues:\nWhatever words Congress may have used in IGRA, it\ncould not have intended that senseless outcome. See Brief\nfor Michigan 28.\n   But this Court does not revise legislation, as Michigan\nproposes, just because the text as written creates an ap-\nparent anomaly as to some subject it does not address.\nTruth be told, such anomalies often arise from statutes, if\n——————\n  5 Michigan’s single reference to another statutory provision, 18\n\nU. S. C. §1166, does not advance its argument, because that term\nincludes a geographical limitation similar to the one appearing in\n§2710(d)(7)(A)(ii). Section 1166 makes a State’s gambling laws applica-\nble “in Indian country” as federal law, and then gives the Federal\nGovernment “exclusive jurisdiction over criminal prosecutions” for\nviolating those laws. 18 U. S. C. §1166(a), (d). Michigan briefly argues\nthat, by negative implication, §1166 gives a State the power “to bring a\ncivil suit to enforce [its] anti-gambling laws in Indian country,” and\nthat this power applies “even when the defendant is an Indian tribe.”\nBrief for Michigan 26 (emphasis added). Bay Mills and the United\nStates vigorously contest both those propositions, arguing that §1166\ngives States no civil enforcement authority at all, much less as against\na tribe. See Brief for Bay Mills 30–31; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 20–22. But that dispute is irrelevant here. Even\nassuming Michigan’s double inference were valid, §1166 would still\nallow a State to sue a tribe for gaming only “in Indian country.” So\nMichigan’s suit, alleging that illegal gaming occurred on state lands,\ncould no more proceed under §1166 than under §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii).\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor no other reason than that Congress typically legislates\nby parts—addressing one thing without examining all\nothers that might merit comparable treatment. Rejecting\na similar argument that a statutory anomaly (between\nproperty and non-property taxes) made “not a whit of\nsense,” we explained in one recent case that “Congress\nwrote the statute it wrote”—meaning, a statute going so\nfar and no further. See CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama\nDept. of Revenue, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 17–\n18). The same could be said of IGRA’s abrogation of tribal\nimmunity for gaming “on Indian lands.” This Court has\nno roving license, in even ordinary cases of statutory\ninterpretation, to disregard clear language simply on the\nview that (in Michigan’s words) Congress “must have\nintended” something broader. Brief for Michigan 32. And\nstill less do we have that warrant when the consequence\nwould be to expand an abrogation of immunity, because\n(as explained earlier) “Congress must ‘unequivocally’\nexpress [its] purpose” to subject a tribe to litigation.\nC & L Enterprises, 532 U. S., at 418; see supra, at 7.\n   In any event, IGRA’s history and design provide a more\nthan intelligible answer to the question Michigan poses\nabout why Congress would have confined a State’s author-\nity to sue a tribe as §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) does. Congress\nadopted IGRA in response to this Court’s decision in Cali-\nfornia v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202,\n221–222 (1987), which held that States lacked any regula-\ntory authority over gaming on Indian lands. Cabazon left\nfully intact a State’s regulatory power over tribal gaming\noutside Indian territory—which, as we will soon show, is\ncapacious. See infra, at 12–13. So the problem Congress\nset out to address in IGRA (Cabazon’s ouster of state\nauthority) arose in Indian lands alone. And the solution\nCongress devised, naturally enough, reflected that fact.\nSee, e.g., Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 58\n(1996) (“[T]he Act grants the States a power that they\n12        MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwould not otherwise have, viz., some measure of author-\nity over gaming on Indian lands”). Everything—literally\neverything—in IGRA affords tools (for either state or\nfederal officials) to regulate gaming on Indian lands, and\nnowhere else. Small surprise that IGRA’s abrogation of\ntribal immunity does that as well.6\n   And the resulting world, when considered functionally,\nis not nearly so “enigma[tic]” as Michigan suggests. Reply\nBrief 1. True enough, a State lacks the ability to sue a\ntribe for illegal gaming when that activity occurs off the\nreservation. But a State, on its own lands, has many\nother powers over tribal gaming that it does not possess\n(absent consent) in Indian territory. Unless federal law\nprovides differently, “Indians going beyond reservation\nboundaries” are subject to any generally applicable state\nlaw. See Wagnon v. Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, 546\nU. S. 95, 113 (2005) (quoting Mescalero Apache Tribe v.\nJones, 411 U. S. 145, 148 (1973)). So, for example, Michi-\ngan could, in the first instance, deny a license to Bay Mills\nfor an off-reservation casino. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n——————\n  6 Indeed, the statutory abrogation does not even cover all suits to\nenjoin gaming on Indian lands, thus refuting the very premise of\nMichigan’s argument-from-anomaly. Section 2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), recall,\nallows a State to sue a tribe not for all “class III gaming activity located\non Indian lands” (as Michigan suggests), but only for such gaming as is\n“conducted in violation of any Tribal-State compact . . . that is in effect.”\nAccordingly, if a tribe opens a casino on Indian lands before negotiating\na compact, the surrounding State cannot sue; only the Federal Gov-\nernment can enforce the law. See 18 U. S. C. §1166(d). To be precise,\nthen, IGRA’s authorization of suit mirrors not the full problem Cabazon\ncreated (a vacuum of state authority over gaming in Indian country)\nbut, more particularly, Congress’s “carefully crafted” compact-based\nsolution to that difficulty. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S.\n44, 73–74 (1996). So Michigan’s binary challenge—if a State can sue to\nstop gaming in Indian country, why not off?—fails out of the starting\ngate. In fact, a State cannot sue to enjoin all gaming in Indian country;\nthat gaming must, in addition, violate an agreement that the State and\ntribe have mutually entered.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n§§432.206–432.206a (West 2001). And if Bay Mills went\nahead anyway, Michigan could bring suit against tribal\nofficials or employees (rather than the Tribe itself) seeking\nan injunction for, say, gambling without a license. See\n§432.220; see also §600.3801(1)(a) (West 2013) (designat-\ning illegal gambling facilities as public nuisances). As this\nCourt has stated before, analogizing to Ex parte Young,\n209 U. S. 123 (1908), tribal immunity does not bar such\na suit for injunctive relief against individuals, includ-\ning tribal officers, responsible for unlawful conduct. See\nSanta Clara Pueblo, 436 U. S., at 59. And to the extent\ncivil remedies proved inadequate, Michigan could resort to\nits criminal law, prosecuting anyone who maintains—or\neven frequents—an unlawful gambling establishment.\nSee Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§432.218 (West 2001),\n750.303, 750.309 (West 2004). In short (and contrary to\nthe dissent’s unsupported assertion, see post, at 11), the\npanoply of tools Michigan can use to enforce its law on its\nown lands—no less than the suit it could bring on Indian\nlands under §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii)—can shutter, quickly and\npermanently, an illegal casino.7\n   Finally, if a State really wants to sue a tribe for gaming\noutside Indian lands, the State need only bargain for a\nwaiver of immunity. Under IGRA, a State and tribe nego-\ntiating a compact “may include . . . remedies for breach of\ncontract,” 25 U. S. C. §2710(d)(3)(C)(v)—including a provi-\nsion allowing the State to bring an action against the tribe\nin the circumstances presented here. States have more\n——————\n  7 Michigan   contends that these alternative remedies may be more\nintrusive on, or less respectful of, tribal sovereignty than the suit it\nwants to bring. See Brief for Michigan 15; Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. Bay\nMills, which presumably is better positioned to address that question,\nemphatically disagrees. See id., at 32–33. And the law supports Bay\nMills’ position: Dispensing with the immunity of a sovereign for fear of\npursuing available remedies against its officers or other individuals\nwould upend all known principles of sovereign immunity.\n14      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthan enough leverage to obtain such terms because a tribe\ncannot conduct class III gaming on its lands without a\ncompact, see §2710(d)(1)(C), and cannot sue to enforce a\nState’s duty to negotiate a compact in good faith, see\nSeminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 47 (holding a State immune\nfrom such suits). So as Michigan forthrightly acknowl-\nedges, “a party dealing with a tribe in contract negotia-\ntions has the power to protect itself by refusing to deal\nabsent the tribe’s waiver of sovereign immunity from suit.”\nBrief for Michigan 40. And many States have taken that\npath. See Brief for Seminole Tribe of Florida et al. as\nAmici Curiae 12–22 (listing compacts with waivers of tribal\nimmunity). To be sure, Michigan did not: As noted earlier,\nthe compact at issue here, instead of authorizing judicial\nremedies, sends disputes to arbitration and expressly\nretains each party’s sovereign immunity. See supra, at 2.\nBut Michigan—like any State—could have insisted on a\ndifferent deal (and indeed may do so now for the future,\nbecause the current compact has expired and remains in\neffect only until the parties negotiate a new one, see Tr. of\nOral Arg. 21). And in that event, the limitation Congress\nplaced on IGRA’s abrogation of tribal immunity—whether\nor not anomalous as an abstract matter—would have\nmade no earthly difference.\n                             IV\n  Because IGRA’s plain terms do not abrogate Bay Mills’\nimmunity from this suit, Michigan (and the dissent) must\nmake a more dramatic argument: that this Court should\n“revisit[ ] Kiowa’s holding” and rule that tribes “have no\nimmunity for illegal commercial activity outside their\nsovereign territory.” Reply Brief 8, 10; see post, at 1.\nMichigan argues that tribes increasingly participate in off-\nreservation gaming and other commercial activity, and\noperate in that capacity less as governments than as\nprivate businesses. See Brief for Michigan 38 (noting,\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\namong other things, that “tribal gaming revenues have\nmore than tripled” since Kiowa). Further, Michigan con-\ntends, tribes have broader immunity from suits arising\nfrom such conduct than other sovereigns—most notably,\nbecause Congress enacted legislation limiting foreign\nnations’ immunity for commercial activity in the United\nStates. See id., at 41; 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(2). It is time,\nMichigan concludes, to “level[ ] the playing field.” Brief for\nMichigan 38.\n   But this Court does not overturn its precedents lightly.\nStare decisis, we have stated, “is the preferred course\nbecause it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and\nconsistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance\non judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and\nperceived integrity of the judicial process.” Payne v. Ten-\nnessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991). Although “not an inexo-\nrable command,” id., at 828, stare decisis is a foundation\nstone of the rule of law, necessary to ensure that legal\nrules develop “in a principled and intelligible fashion,”\nVasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986). For that\nreason, this Court has always held that “any departure”\nfrom the doctrine “demands special justification.” Arizona\nv. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).\n   And that is more than usually so in the circumstances\nhere. First, Kiowa itself was no one-off: Rather, in reject-\ning the identical argument Michigan makes, our decision\nreaffirmed a long line of precedents, concluding that “the\ndoctrine of tribal immunity”—without any exceptions for\ncommercial or off-reservation conduct—“is settled law and\ncontrols this case.” 523 U. S., at 756; see id., at 754–755;\nsupra, at 5–7. Second, we have relied on Kiowa subse-\nquently: In another case involving a tribe’s off-reservation\ncommercial conduct, we began our analysis with Kiowa’s\nholding that tribal immunity applies to such activity (and\nthen found that the Tribe had waived its protection). See\nC & L Enterprises, 532 U. S., at 418. Third, tribes across\n16        MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe country, as well as entities and individuals doing\nbusiness with them, have for many years relied on Kiowa\n(along with its forebears and progeny), negotiating their\ncontracts and structuring their transactions against a\nbackdrop of tribal immunity. As in other cases involving\ncontract and property rights, concerns of stare decisis are\nthus “at their acme.” State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20\n(1997). And fourth (a point we will later revisit, see infra,\nat 17–20), Congress exercises primary authority in this\narea and “remains free to alter what we have done”—\nanother factor that gives “special force” to stare decisis.\nPatterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172–173\n(1989). To overcome all these reasons for this Court to\nstand pat, Michigan would need an ace up its sleeve.8\n   But instead, all the State musters are retreads of asser-\ntions we have rejected before. Kiowa expressly considered\nthe view, now offered by Michigan, that “when tribes take\npart in the Nation’s commerce,” immunity “extends be-\nyond what is needed to safeguard tribal self-governance.”\n523 U. S., at 758. (Indeed, as Kiowa noted, see id., at 757,\nPotawatomi had less than a decade earlier rejected Okla-\nhoma’s identical contention that “because tribal business\nactivities . . . are now so detached from traditional tribal\ninterests,” immunity “no longer makes sense in [the com-\nmercial] context,” 498 U. S., at 510.) So too, the Kiowa\n——————\n   8 Adhering to stare decisis is particularly appropriate here given that\n\nthe State, as we have shown, has many alternative remedies: It has no\nneed to sue the Tribe to right the wrong it alleges. See supra, at 12–13.\nWe need not consider whether the situation would be different if\nno alternative remedies were available. We have never, for example,\nspecifically addressed (nor, so far as we are aware, has Congress)\nwhether immunity should apply in the ordinary way if a tort victim, or\nother plaintiff who has not chosen to deal with a tribe, has no alterna-\ntive way to obtain relief for off-reservation commercial conduct. The\nargument that such cases would present a “special justification” for\nabandoning precedent is not before us. Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S.\n203, 212 (1984).\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt comprehended the trajectory of tribes’ commercial\nactivity (which is the dissent’s exclusive rationale for\nignoring stare decisis, see post, at 10–13). In the preceding\ndecade, tribal gaming revenues had increased more than\nthirty fold9 (dwarfing the still strong rate of growth since\nthat time, see supra, at 14–15); and Kiowa noted the\nflourishing of other tribal enterprises, ranging from ciga-\nrette sales to ski resorts, see 523 U. S., at 758. Moreover,\nthe Kiowa Court understood that other sovereigns did not\nenjoy similar immunity for commercial activities outside\ntheir territory; that seeming “anomal[y]” was a principal\npoint in the dissenting opinion. See id., at 765 (Stevens,\nJ., dissenting). Kiowa did more, in fact, than acknowledge\nthose arguments; it expressed a fair bit of sympathy to-\nward them. See id., at 758 (noting “reasons to doubt the\nwisdom of perpetuating the doctrine” as to off-reservation\ncommercial conduct). Yet the decision could not have been\nany clearer: “We decline to draw [any] distinction” that\nwould “confine [immunity] to reservations or to noncom-\nmercial activities.” Ibid.\n   We ruled that way for a single, simple reason: because it\nis fundamentally Congress’s job, not ours, to determine\nwhether or how to limit tribal immunity. The special\nbrand of sovereignty the tribes retain—both its nature and\nits extent—rests in the hands of Congress. See Lara, 541\nU. S., at 200; Wheeler, 435 U. S., at 323. Kiowa chose to\nrespect that congressional responsibility (as Potawatomi\nhad a decade earlier) when it rejected the precursor to\nMichigan’s argument: Whatever our view of the merits, we\nexplained, “we defer to the role Congress may wish to\nexercise in this important judgment.” 523 U. S., at 758;\nsee Potawatomi, 498 U. S., at 510 (stating that because\n——————\n  9 See Nat.

BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n“Congress has always been at liberty to dispense with” or\nlimit tribal immunity, “we are not disposed to modify” its\nscope). Congress, we said—drawing an analogy to its role\nin shaping foreign sovereign immunity10—has the greater\ncapacity “to weigh and accommodate the competing policy\nconcerns and reliance interests” involved in the issue. 523\nU. S., at 759. And Congress repeatedly had done just\nthat: It had restricted tribal immunity “in limited circum-\nstances” (including, we noted, in §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii)), while “in\nother statutes” declaring an “intention not to alter” the\ndoctrine. Id., at 758; see Potawatomi, 498 U. S., at 510\n(citing statutory provisions involving tribal immunity). So\ntoo, we thought, Congress should make the call whether\nto curtail a tribe’s immunity for off-reservation commer-\ncial conduct—and the Court should accept Congress’s\njudgment.\n   All that we said in Kiowa applies today, with yet one\n——————\n   10 Kiowa explained that Congress, in the Foreign Sovereign Immuni-\n\nties Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(2), “den[ied] immunity for the\ncommercial acts of a foreign nation,” codifying an earlier State Depart-\nment document, known as the Tate Letter, announcing that policy. 523\nU. S., at 759. Michigan takes issue with Kiowa’s account, maintaining\nthat this Court took the lead in crafting the commercial exception to\nforeign sovereign immunity, and so should feel free to do the same\nthing here. See Reply Brief 6–7. But the decision Michigan cites,\nAlfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U. S. 682\n(1976), does not show what the State would like. First, Michigan points\nto a part of the Dunhill opinion commanding only four votes, see id., at\n695–706 (opinion of White, J.); the majority’s decision was based on the\nact of state doctrine, not on anything to do with foreign sovereign\nimmunity, see id., at 690–695. And second, even the plurality opinion\nrelied heavily on the views of the Executive Branch as expressed in the\nTate Letter—going so far as to attach that document as an appendix.\nSee id., at 696–698 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 711–715 (appendix 2 to\nopinion of the Court). The opinion therefore illustrates what Kiowa\nhighlighted: this Court’s historic practice of “deferr[ing] to the decisions\nof the political branches,” rather than going it alone, when addressing\nforeign sovereign immunity. Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nige-\nria, 461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983).\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     19\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nmore thing: Congress has now reflected on Kiowa and\nmade an initial (though of course not irrevocable) decision\nto retain that form of tribal immunity. Following Kiowa,\nCongress considered several bills to substantially modify\ntribal immunity in the commercial context. Two in partic-\nular—drafted by the chair of the Senate Appropriations\nSubcommittee on the Interior—expressly referred to Kiowa\nand broadly abrogated tribal immunity for most torts\nand breaches of contract. See S. 2299, 105th Cong., 2d\nSess. (1998); S. 2302, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998). But\ninstead of adopting those reversals of Kiowa, Congress\nchose to enact a far more modest alternative requiring\ntribes either to disclose or to waive their immunity in\ncontracts needing the Secretary of the Interior’s approval.\nSee Indian Tribal Economic Development and Contract\nEncouragement Act of 2000, §2, 114 Stat. 46 (codified at\n25 U. S. C. §81(d)(2)); see also F. Cohen, Handbook of\nFederal Indian Law §7.05[1][b], p. 643 (2012). Since then,\nCongress has continued to exercise its plenary authority\nover tribal immunity, specifically preserving immunity in\nsome contexts and abrogating it in others, but never\nadopting the change Michigan wants.11 So rather than\nconfronting, as we did in Kiowa, a legislative vacuum as to\nthe precise issue presented, we act today against the\nbackdrop of a congressional choice: to retain tribal immun-\nity (at least for now) in a case like this one.12\n——————\n  11 Compare,   e.g., Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009, §§2(e),\n(3)(a), 124 Stat. 1101, 1108 (preserving immunity), with Arizona Water\nSettlements Act, §§213(a)(2), 301, 118 Stat. 3531, 3551 (abrogating\nimmunity). The dissent’s claim that “Congress has never granted tribal\nsovereign immunity in any shape or form,” post, at 13, apparently does\nnot take into account the many statutes in which Congress preserved or\notherwise ratified tribal immunity. See, e.g., 25 U. S. C. §450n; see\ngenerally Potawatomi, 498 U. S., at 510 (“Congress has consistently\nreiterated its approval of the immunity doctrine”).\n  12 The dissent principally counters that this history is not “relevan[t]”\n\nbecause Kiowa was a “common-law decision.” Post, at 14. But that is\n20        MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Reversing Kiowa in these circumstances would scale\nthe heights of presumption: Beyond upending “long-\nestablished principle[s] of tribal sovereign immunity,” that\naction would replace Congress’s considered judgment with\nour contrary opinion. Potawatomi, 498 U. S., at 510. As\nKiowa recognized, a fundamental commitment of Indian\nlaw is judicial respect for Congress’s primary role in defin-\ning the contours of tribal sovereignty. See 523 U. S., at\n758–760; see also Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U. S., at 60\n(“[A] proper respect . . . for the plenary authority of Con-\ngress in this area cautions that [the courts] tread lightly”);\nCohen, supra, §2.01[1], at 110 (“Judicial deference to the\nparamount authority of Congress in matters concerning\nIndian policy remains a central and indispensable princi-\nple of the field of Indian law”). That commitment gains\nonly added force when Congress has already reflected on\nan issue of tribal sovereignty, including immunity from\nsuit, and declined to change settled law. And that force\nmust grow greater still when Congress considered that\nissue partly at our urging. See Kiowa, 523 U. S., at 758\n(hinting, none too subtly, that “Congress may wish to\nexercise” its authority over the question presented). Hav-\ning held in Kiowa that this issue is up to Congress, we\ncannot reverse ourselves because some may think its\nconclusion wrong. Congress of course may always change\nits mind—and we would readily defer to that new decision.\nBut it is for Congress, now more than ever, to say whether\nto create an exception to tribal immunity for off-\nreservation commercial activity. As in Kiowa—except still\n——————\nto ignore what Kiowa (in line with prior rulings) specifically told\nCongress: that tribal immunity, far from any old common law doctrine,\nlies in Congress’s hands to configure. See 523 U. S., at 758; Potawatomi,\n498 U. S., at 510; Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 58–\n60 (1978). When we inform Congress that it has primary responsibility\nover a sphere of law, and invite Congress to consider a specific issue\nwithin that sphere, we cannot deem irrelevant how Congress responds.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Sovereignty implies im-\nmunity from lawsuits. Subjection means (among much\nelse) that Congress can abrogate that immunity as and to\nthe extent it wishes. If Congress had authorized this suit,\nBay Mills would have no valid grounds to object. But\nCongress has not done so: The abrogation of immunity in\nIGRA applies to gaming on, but not off, Indian lands. We\nwill not rewrite Congress’s handiwork. Nor will we create\na freestanding exception to tribal immunity for all off-\nreservation commercial conduct. This Court has declined\nthat course once before.

Rev. 1587, 1640–1641\n(2013) (same). And in more recent decades, this Court has\nconsistently affirmed the doctrine. See, e.g., United States\nv. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506\n(1940); Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of\nWash., 433 U. S. 165 (1977); C & L Enterprises, Inc. v.\nCitizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Okla., 532 U. S.\n411, 418 (2001). Despite this history, the principal dissent\nchides the Court for failing to offer a sufficient basis for\nthe doctrine of tribal immunity, post, at 3 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.), and reasons that we should at least limit the\ndoctrine of tribal sovereign immunity in ways that resem-\nble restrictions on foreign sovereign immunity.\n   The majority compellingly explains why stare decisis\nand deference to Congress’ careful regulatory scheme\nrequire affirming the decision below. I write separately to\nfurther detail why both history and comity counsel against\nlimiting Tribes’ sovereign immunity in the manner the\n2       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nprincipal dissent advances.\n                               I\n   Long before the formation of the United States, Tribes\n“were self-governing sovereign political communities.”\nUnited States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 322–323 (1978).\nAnd Tribes “have not given up their full sovereignty.” Id.,\nat 323. Absent contrary congressional acts, Tribes “retain\ntheir existing sovereign powers” and “possess those as-\npects of sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or statute, or\nby implication as a necessary result of their dependent\nstatus.” Ibid. See also 25 U. S. C. §1301(1) (affirming\nTribes’ continued “powers of self-government”). In this\ncase then, the question is what type of immunity federal\ncourts should accord to Tribes, commensurate with their\nretained sovereignty.\n   In answering this question, the principal dissent analo-\ngizes tribal sovereign immunity to foreign sovereign im-\nmunity. Foreign sovereigns (unlike States) are generally\nnot immune from suits arising from their commercial\nactivities. Post, at 4; see also Foreign Sovereign Immuni-\nties Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(2) (commercial-\nactivity exception to foreign sovereign immunity). This\nanalogy, however, lacks force. Indian Tribes have never\nhistorically been classified as “foreign” governments in\nfederal courts even when they asked to be.\n   The case of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1831),\nis instructive. In 1828 and 1829, the Georgia Legislature\nenacted a series of laws that purported to nullify acts of\nthe Cherokee government and seize Cherokee land, among\nother things. Id., at 7–8. The Cherokee Nation sued\nGeorgia in this Court, alleging that Georgia’s laws violated\nfederal law and treaties. Id., at 7. As the constitutional\nbasis for jurisdiction, the Tribe relied on Article III, §2, cl.\n1, which extends the federal judicial power to cases “be-\ntween a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states,\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\ncitizens, or subjects.” 5 Pet., at 15 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But this Court concluded that it lacked\njurisdiction because Tribes were not “foreign state[s].” Id.,\nat 20. The Court reasoned that “[t]he condition of the\nIndians in relation to the United States is perhaps unlike\nthat of any other two people in existence.” Id., at 16.\nTribes were more akin to “domestic dependent nations,”\nthe Court explained, than to foreign nations. Id., at 17.\nWe have repeatedly relied on that characterization in\nsubsequent cases. See, e.g., Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.\nCitizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505,\n509 (1991); Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S.\n130, 141 (1982). Two centuries of jurisprudence therefore\nweigh against treating Tribes like foreign visitors in\nAmerican courts.\n                             II\n  The principal dissent contends that whenever one sov-\nereign is sued in the courts of another, the question\nwhether to confer sovereign immunity is not a matter of\nright but rather one of “comity.” Post, at 3. But in my\nview, the premise leads to a different conclusion than the\none offered by the dissent. Principles of comity strongly\ncounsel in favor of continued recognition of tribal sover-\neign immunity, including for off-reservation commercial\nconduct.\n  Comity—“that is, ‘a proper respect for [a sovereign’s]\nfunctions,’ ” Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7)—fosters “respectful,\nharmonious relations” between governments, Wood v.\nMilyard, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7). For two\nreasons, these goals are best served by recognizing sover-\neign immunity for Indian Tribes, including immunity for\noff-reservation conduct, except where Congress has ex-\npressly abrogated it. First, a legal rule that permitted\nStates to sue Tribes, absent their consent, for commercial\n4       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nconduct would be anomalous in light of the existing prohi-\nbitions against Tribes’ suing States in like circumstances.\nSuch disparate treatment of these two classes of domestic\nsovereigns would hardly signal the Federal Government’s\nrespect for tribal sovereignty. Second, Tribes face a num-\nber of barriers to raising revenue in traditional ways. If\nTribes are ever to become more self-sufficient, and fund a\nmore substantial portion of their own governmental func-\ntions, commercial enterprises will likely be a central\nmeans of achieving that goal.\n                              A\n   We have held that Tribes may not sue States in federal\ncourt, Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S.\n775 (1991), including for commercial conduct that chiefly\nimpacts Indian reservations, Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.\nFlorida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996). In Seminole Tribe, the Tribe\nsued the State of Florida in federal court under the Indian\nGaming Regulatory Act (IGRA)—the same statute peti-\ntioner relies on here. The suit alleged that Florida had\nbreached its statutory “duty to negotiate in good faith with\n[the Tribe] toward the formation of a [gaming] compact.”\nId., at 47. This Court held that state sovereign immunity\nprohibited such a suit.\n   Importantly, the Court barred the Tribe’s suit against\nFlorida even though the case involved the State’s conduct\nin the course of commercial negotiations. As this Court\nlater observed, relying in part on Seminole Tribe, the\ndoctrine of state sovereign immunity is not “any less ro-\nbust” when the case involves conduct “that is undertaken\nfor profit, that is traditionally performed by private citi-\nzens and corporations, and that otherwise resembles the\nbehavior of ‘market participants.’ ” College Savings Bank\nv. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527\nU. S. 666, 684 (1999). Nor did Seminole Tribe adopt a\nstate corollary to the “off-reservation” exception to tribal\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    5\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nsovereign immunity that the principal dissent urges today.\nTo the contrary, the negotiations in Seminole Tribe con-\ncerned gaming on Indian lands, not state lands.\n  As the principal dissent observes, “comity is about one\nsovereign respecting the dignity of another.” Post, at 4.\nThis Court would hardly foster respect for the dignity of\nTribes by allowing States to sue Tribes for commercial\nactivity on State lands, while prohibiting Tribes from\nsuing States for commercial activity on Indian lands. Both\nStates and Tribes are domestic governments who come to\nthis Court with sovereignty that they have not entirely\nceded to the Federal Government.\n  Similar asymmetry would result if States could sue\nTribes in state courts.1 In Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U. S. 353,\n355 (2001), this Court considered whether a tribal court\nhad “jurisdiction over civil claims against state officials\nwho entered tribal land to execute a search warrant\nagainst a tribe member suspected of having violated state\nlaw outside the reservation.” It held that the tribal court\ndid not. Id., at 374. In reaching that conclusion, the\nCourt observed that “[s]tate sovereignty does not end at a\nreservation’s border.” Id., at 361. And relying on similar\nprinciples, some federal courts have more explicitly held\nthat tribal courts may not entertain suits against States.\nSee, e.g., Montana v. Gilham, 133 F. 3d 1133, 1136–1137\n(CA9 1998) (holding that while neither “the Eleventh\nAmendment [n]or congressional act” barred suits against\nStates in tribal courts, “the inherent sovereign powers of\nthe States” barred such suits). To the extent Tribes are\nbarred from suing in tribal courts, it would be anomalous\nto permit suits against Tribes in state courts.\n  Two of the dissenting opinions implicitly address this\n——————\n  1 While this case involves a suit against a Tribe in federal court, the\n\nprincipal dissent also critiques tribal sovereign immunity in state\ncourts. Post, at 4–5.\n6       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nasymmetry. The principal dissent reasons that States and\nTribes should be treated differently for purposes of sover-\neign immunity because—unlike tribal sovereign immu-\nnity—state sovereign immunity has constitutional origins.\nPost, at 3, n. 1. JUSTICE GINSBURG offers another view:\nthat Tribes and States should both receive less immunity.\nShe expresses concerns about cases like Seminole Tribe,\npointing to dissents that have catalogued the many prob-\nlems associated with the Court’s sprawling state sovereign\nimmunity jurisprudence. Post, at 1–2 (citing, among\nothers, Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 814 (1999) (Souter,\nJ., dissenting)).\n   As things stand, however, Seminole Tribe and its prog-\neny remain the law. And so long as that is so, comity would\nbe ill-served by unequal treatment of States and Tribes. If\nTribes cannot sue States for commercial activities on\ntribal lands, the converse should also be true. Any other\nresult would fail to respect the dignity of Indian Tribes.\n                              B\n   The principal dissent contends that Tribes have\nemerged as particularly “substantial and successful”\ncommercial actors. Post, at 13. The dissent expresses\nconcern that, although tribal leaders can be sued for pro-\nspective relief, ante, at 13 (majority opinion), Tribes’ pur-\nportedly growing coffers remain unexposed to broad dam-\nages liability. Post, at 10–11. These observations suffer\nfrom two flaws.\n   First, not all Tribes are engaged in highly lucrative\ncommercial activity. Nearly half of federally recognized\nTribes in the United States do not operate gaming facili-\nties at all. A. Meister, Casino City’s Indian Gaming In-\ndustry Report 28 (2009–2010 ed.) (noting that “only 237,\nor 42 percent, of the 564 federally recognized Native\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      7\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nAmerican tribes in the U. S. operate gaming”).2 And even\namong the Tribes that do, gaming revenue is far from\nuniform. As of 2009, fewer than 20% of Indian gaming\nfacilities accounted for roughly 70% of the revenues from\nsuch facilities. Ibid. One must therefore temper any\nimpression that Tribes across the country have suddenly\nand uniformly found their treasuries filled with gaming\nrevenue.\n   Second, even if all Tribes were equally successful in\ngenerating commercial revenues, that would not justify\nthe commercial-activity exception urged by the principal\ndissent. For tribal gaming operations cannot be under-\nstood as mere profit-making ventures that are wholly\nseparate from the Tribes’ core governmental functions. A\nkey goal of the Federal Government is to render Tribes\nmore self-sufficient, and better positioned to fund their\nown sovereign functions, rather than relying on federal\nfunding. 25 U. S. C. §2702(1) (explaining that Congress’\npurpose in enacting IGRA was “to provide a statutory\nbasis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a\nmeans of promoting tribal economic development, self-\nsufficiency, and strong tribal governments”); see also\nCohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law 1357–1373\n(2012) (Cohen’s Handbook) (describing various types of\nfederal financial assistance that Tribes receive). And\ntribal business operations are critical to the goals of tribal\nself-sufficiency because such enterprises in some cases\n“may be the only means by which a tribe can raise reve-\nnues,” Struve, 36 Ariz. St. L. J., at 169. This is due in\nlarge part to the insuperable (and often state-imposed)\nbarriers Tribes face in raising revenue through more\n\n——————\n  2 The  term “ ‘Indian gaming facility’ is defined as any tribal enterprise\nthat offer[s] gaming in accordance with [the Indian Gaming Regulation\nAct].’ ” A. Meister, Casino City’s Indian Gaming Industry Report 10\n(2009–2010 ed.).\n8       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\ntraditional means.\n   For example, States have the power to tax certain indi-\nviduals and companies based on Indian reservations,\nmaking it difficult for Tribes to raise revenue from those\nsources. See Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Citizen Band\nPotawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505 (allowing State\nto collect taxes on sales to non-Indians on Indian land);\nArizona Dept. of Revenue v. Blaze Constr. Co., 526 U. S. 32\n(1999) (allowing taxation of companies owned by non-\nIndians on Indian land); Thomas v. Gay, 169 U. S. 264\n(1898) (allowing taxation of property owned by non-\nIndians on Indian land). States may also tax reservation\nland that Congress has authorized individuals to hold in\nfee, regardless of whether it is held by Indians or non-\nIndians. See Cass County v. Leech Lake Band of Chip-\npewa Indians, 524 U. S. 103 (1998) (States may tax Indian\nreservation land if Congress made the land subject to sale\nunder the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887 (also\nknown as the Dawes Act)); County of Yakima v. Confeder-\nated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251\n(1992) (same).\n   As commentators have observed, if Tribes were to im-\npose their own taxes on these same sources, the resulting\ndouble taxation would discourage economic growth.\nFletcher, In Pursuit of Tribal Economic Development as a\nSubstitute for Reservation Tax Revenue, 80 N. D. L.

Many businesses may find\nit easier to avoid doing business on our reservations rather\nthan . . . bear the brunt of an added tax burden”).\n   If non-Indians controlled only a small amount of prop-\nerty on Indian reservations, and if only a negligible amount\nof land was held in fee, the double-taxation concern might\nbe less severe. But for many Tribes, that is not the case.\nHistory explains why this is so: Federal policies enacted in\nthe late 19th and early 20th centuries rendered a devas-\ntating blow to tribal ownership. In 1887, Congress enacted\nthe Dawes Act. 24 Stat. 388. That Act had two major\ncomponents relevant here. First, it converted the property\nthat belonged to Indian Tribes into fee property, and\nallotted the land to individual Indians. Id., at 388–389.\nMuch of this land passed quickly to non-Indian owners.\nRoyster, The Legacy of Allotment, 27 Ariz. St. L. J. 1, 12\n(1995). Indeed, by 1934, the amount of land that passed\nfrom Indian Tribes to non-Indians totaled 90 million acres.\nSee Cohen’s Handbook 74. Other property passed to non-\nIndians when destitute Indians found themselves unable\nto pay state taxes, resulting in sheriff ’s sales. Royster,\nsupra, at 12.\n   A second component of the Dawes Act opened “surplus”\nland on Indian reservations to settlement by non-Indians.\n24 Stat. 389–390. Selling surplus lands to non-Indians\nwas part of a more general policy of forced assimilation.\nSee Cohen’s Handbook 75. Sixty million acres of land\npassed to non-Indian hands as a result of surplus pro-\ngrams. Royster, supra, at 13.3\n   These policies have left a devastating legacy, as the\ncases that have come before this Court demonstrate. We\n\n——————\n  3 This figure does not include land taken from Indian Tribes after\nWorld War II; during that time, some Tribes and reservations were\nliquidated and given to non-Indians. A. Debo, A History of Indians of\nthe United States 301–312 (1970).\n10      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nnoted in Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 548\n(1981), for example, that due in large part to the Dawes\nAct, 28% of the Crow Tribe’s reservation in Montana was\nheld in fee by non-Indians. Similarly, Justice White ob-\nserved in Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of\nYakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 414 (1989) (plurality opin-\nion), that 20% of the Yakima Nation’s reservation was\nowned in fee. For reservations like those, it is particu-\nlarly impactful that States and local governments may tax\nproperty held by non-Indians, Thomas, 169 U. S., at 264–\n265, and land held in fee as a result of the Dawes Act. See\nCounty of Yakima, 502 U. S., at 259.\n   Moreover, Tribes are largely unable to obtain substan-\ntial revenue by taxing tribal members who reside on non-\nfee land that was not allotted under the Dawes Act. As\none scholar recently observed, even if Tribes imposed high\ntaxes on Indian residents, “there is very little income,\nproperty, or sales they could tax.” Fletcher, supra, at 774.\nThe poverty and unemployment rates on Indian reserva-\ntions are significantly greater than the national average.\nSee n. 4, infra. As a result, “there is no stable tax base on\nmost reservations.” Fletcher, supra, at 774; see Williams,\nSmall Steps on the Long Road to Self-Sufficiency for In-\ndian Nations: The Indian Tribal Governmental Tax Status\nAct of 1982, 22 Harv. J. Legis. 335, 385 (1985).\n   To be sure, poverty has decreased over the past few\ndecades on reservations that have gaming activity. One\nrecent study found that between 1990 and 2000, the pres-\nence of a tribal casino increased average per capita income\nby 7.4% and reduced the family poverty rate by 4.9 per-\ncentage points. Anderson, Tribal Casino Impacts on Amer-\nican Indians Well-Being: Evidence From Reservation-\nLevel Census Data, 31 Contemporary Economic Policy\n291, 298 (Apr. 2013).

Manufacturing Technologies,\nInc., 523 U. S. 751 (1998), this Court extended the judge-\nmade doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity to bar suits\narising out of an Indian tribe’s commercial activities con-\nducted outside its territory. That was error. Such an\nexpansion of tribal immunity is unsupported by any ra-\ntionale for that doctrine, inconsistent with the limits on\ntribal sovereignty, and an affront to state sovereignty.\n   That decision, wrong to begin with, has only worsened\nwith the passage of time. In the 16 years since Kiowa,\ntribal commerce has proliferated and the inequities en-\ngendered by unwarranted tribal immunity have multi-\nplied. Nevertheless, the Court turns down a chance to\nrectify its error. Still lacking a substantive justification\nfor Kiowa’s rule, the majority relies on notions of deference\nto Congress and stare decisis. Because those considera-\ntions do not support (and cannot sustain) Kiowa’s unjusti-\nfiable rule and its mounting consequences, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                           I\n                           A\n  There is no substantive basis for Kiowa’s extension of\n2       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntribal immunity to off-reservation commercial acts. As\nthis Court explained in Kiowa, the common-law doctrine of\ntribal sovereign immunity arose “almost by accident.” Id.,\nat 756. The case this Court typically cited as the doc-\ntrine’s source “simply does not stand for that proposition,”\nibid. (citing Turner v. United States, 248 U. S. 354\n(1919)), and later cases merely “reiterated the doctrine”\n“with little analysis,” 523 U. S., at 757. In fact, far from\ndefending the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity, the\nKiowa majority “doubt[ed] the wisdom of perpetuating the\ndoctrine.” Id., at 758. The majority here suggests just one\npost hoc justification: that tribes automatically receive\nimmunity as an incident to their historic sovereignty. But\nthat explanation fails to account for the fact that immunity\ndoes not apply of its own force in the courts of another\nsovereign. And none of the other colorable rationales for\nthe doctrine—i.e., considerations of comity, and protection\nof tribal self-sufficiency and self-government—supports\nextending immunity to suits arising out of a tribe’s com-\nmercial activities conducted beyond its territory.\n                               1\n  Despite the Indian tribes’ subjection to the authority\nand protection of the United States Government, this\nCourt has deemed them “domestic dependent nations”\nthat retain limited attributes of their historic sovereignty.\nCherokee Nation v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1831); see also\nUnited States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 323 (1978) (“The\nsovereignty that the Indian tribes retain is of a unique and\nlimited character”). The majority suggests that tribal\nimmunity is one such attribute of sovereignty that tribes\nhave retained. See ante, at 5; Brief for Respondent Bay\nMills Indian Community 48; On that view, immunity\nfrom suit applies automatically, on the theory that it is\nsimply “inherent in the nature of sovereignty,” The Feder-\nalist No. 81, p. 548 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   This basis for immunity—the only substantive basis the\nmajority invokes—is unobjectionable when a tribe raises\nimmunity as a defense in its own courts. We have long\nrecognized that in the sovereign’s own courts, “the sover-\neign’s power to determine the jurisdiction of its own courts\nand to define the substantive legal rights of its citizens\nadequately explains the lesser authority to define its own\nimmunity.” Kiowa, supra, at 760 (Stevens, J., dissenting)\n(citing Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, 353\n(1907)). But this notion cannot support a tribe’s claim of\nimmunity in the courts of another sovereign—either a\nState (as in Kiowa) or the United States (as here). Sover-\neign immunity is not a freestanding “right” that applies of\nits own force when a sovereign faces suit in the courts of\nanother. Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677,\n688 (2004). Rather, “[t]he sovereign’s claim to immunity\nin the courts of a second sovereign . . . normally depends\non the second sovereign’s law.” Kiowa, supra, at 760–761\n(Stevens, J., dissenting); see, e.g., Altmann, supra, at 711\n(BREYER, J., concurring) (application of foreign sovereign\nimmunity “is a matter, not of legal right, but of ‘grace and\ncomity’ ”).1 In short, to the extent an Indian tribe may\nclaim immunity in federal or state court, it is because\nfederal or state law provides it, not merely because the\ntribe is sovereign. Outside of tribal courts, the majority’s\n——————\n   1 State sovereign immunity is an exception: This Court has said that\n\nthe States’ immunity from suit in federal court is secured by the Con-\nstitution. See Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 73 (2000)\n(“[F]or over a century now, we have made clear that the Constitution\ndoes not provide for federal jurisdiction over suits against nonconsent-\ning States”); Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 733 (1999) (“Although the\nsovereign immunity of the States derives at least in part from the\ncommon-law tradition, . . . the immunity exists today by constitutional\ndesign”). Unlike the States, Indian tribes “are not part of this constitu-\ntional order,” and their immunity is not guaranteed by it. United\nStates v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 219 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment).\n4       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ninherent-immunity argument is hardly persuasive.\n                                2\n    Immunity for independent foreign nations in federal\ncourts is grounded in international “comity,” Verlinden B. V.\nv. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983), i.e.,\nrespecting the dignity of other sovereigns so as not to\n“ ‘ “ imperil the amicable relations between governments\nand vex the peace of nations,” ’ ” Banco Nacional de Cuba\nv. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 418 (1964). But whatever its\nrelevance to tribal immunity, comity is an ill-fitting justi-\nfication for extending immunity to tribes’ off-reservation\ncommercial activities. Even with respect to fully sovereign\nforeign nations, comity has long been discarded as a suffi-\ncient reason to grant immunity for commercial acts. In\n1976, Congress provided that foreign states are not im-\nmune from suits based on their “commercial activity” in\nthe United States or abroad. Foreign Sovereign Immuni-\nties Act, 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(2); see also Alfred Dunhill of\nLondon, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U. S. 682, 703–704\n(1976) (plurality opinion of White, J., joined by Burger,\nC. J., and Powell and Rehnquist, JJ.) (“Subjecting for-\neign governments to the rule of law in their commercial\ndealings” is “unlikely to touch very sharply on ‘na-\ntional nerves,’” because “[i]n their commercial capacities, for-\neign governments do not exercise powers peculiar to\nsovereigns”).\n    There is a further reason that comity cannot support\ntribal immunity for off-reservation commercial activities.\nAt bottom, comity is about one sovereign respecting the\ndignity of another. See Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 416\n(1979).      But permitting immunity for a tribe’s off-\nreservation acts represents a substantial affront to a\ndifferent set of sovereigns—the States, whose sovereignty\nis guaranteed by the Constitution, see New York v. United\nStates, 505 U. S. 144, 188 (1992) (“The Constitution . . .\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n‘leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable\nsovereignty ’ ” (quoting The Federalist No. 39, at 256)).\nWhen an Indian tribe engages in commercial activity\noutside its own territory, it necessarily acts within the\nterritory of a sovereign State. This is why, “[a]bsent ex-\npress federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond\nreservation boundaries have generally been held subject to\nnondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all\ncitizens of the State.” Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones,\n411 U. S. 145, 148–149 (1973). A rule barring all suits\nagainst a tribe arising out of a tribe’s conduct within state\nterritory—whether private actions or (as here) actions\nbrought by the State itself—stands in stark contrast to a\nState’s broad regulatory authority over Indians within its\nown territory. Indeed, by foreclosing key mechanisms\nupon which States depend to enforce their laws against\ntribes engaged in off-reservation commercial activity, such\na rule effects a breathtaking pre-emption of state power.\nKiowa, 523 U. S., at 764 (Stevens, J., dissenting). What is\nworse, because that rule of immunity also applies in state\ncourts, it strips the States of their prerogative “to decide\nfor themselves whether to accord such immunity to Indian\ntribes as a matter of comity.” Id., at 760 (same). The\nStates may decide whether to grant immunity in their\ncourts to other sovereign States, see Hall, supra, at 417–\n418 (a State’s immunity from suit in the courts of a second\nState depends on whether the second has chosen to extend\nimmunity to the first “as a matter of comity”), but when it\ncomes to Indian tribes, this Court has taken that right\naway. Kiowa, supra, at 765 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n   Nor does granting tribes immunity with respect to their\ncommercial conduct in state territory serve the practical\naim of comity: allaying friction between sovereigns. See\nBanco Nacional de Cuba, supra, at 417–418. We need look\nno further than this case (and many others cited by peti-\ntioner and amici States) to see that such broad immunity\n6       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nhas only aggravated relationships between States and\ntribes throughout the country. See infra, at 11–13; see\ngenerally Brief for State of Alabama et al. 11–16; Brief for\nState of Oklahoma 8–10, 12–15.\n                                3\n   This Court has previously suggested that recognizing\ntribal immunity furthers a perceived congressional goal of\npromoting tribal self-sufficiency and self-governance. See\nKiowa, supra, at 757; Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort\nBerthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 476 U. S.\n877, 890 (1986). Whatever the force of this assertion as a\ngeneral matter, it is easy to reject as a basis for extending\ntribal immunity to off-reservation commercial activities.\nIn Kiowa itself, this Court dismissed the self-sufficiency\nrationale as “inapposite to modern, wide-ranging tribal\nenterprises extending well beyond traditional tribal cus-\ntoms and activities.” 523 U. S., at 757–758. The Court\nexpressed concern that “[i]n this economic context, im-\nmunity can harm those who are unaware that they are\ndealing with a tribe, who do not know of tribal immunity,\nor who have no choice in the matter, as in the case of tort\nvictims.” Id., at 758.\n   Nor is immunity for off-reservation commercial acts\nnecessary to protect tribal self-governance. As the Kiowa\nmajority conceded, “[i]n our interdependent and mobile\nsociety, . . . tribal immunity extends beyond what is needed\nto safeguard tribal self-governance.” Ibid. Such broad\nimmunity far exceeds the modest scope of tribal sover-\neignty, which is limited only to “what is necessary to pro-\ntect tribal self-government or to control internal relations.”\nMontana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 564 (1981); see\nalso Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U. S. 353, 392 (2001) (O’Connor,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\n(“[T]ribes retain sovereign interests in activities that occur\non land owned and controlled by the tribe . . .”).

See 523 U. S., at 758. The Kiowa majority admit-\nted that the Court—rather than Congress—“has taken the\nlead in drawing the bounds of tribal immunity.” Id., at\n759. Nevertheless, the Court adopted a rule of expansive\nimmunity purportedly to “defer to the role Congress may\nwish to exercise in this important judgment.” Id., at 758.\n  This asserted “deference” to Congress was a fiction and\nremains an enigma, however, because the Kiowa Court did\nnot actually leave to Congress the decision whether to\nextend tribal immunity. Tribal immunity is a common-\nlaw doctrine adopted and shaped by this Court. Okla-\nhoma Tax Comm’n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of\nOkla., 498 U. S. 505, 510 (1991); Kiowa, 523 U. S., at 759.\nBefore Kiowa, we had never held that tribal sovereign\nimmunity applied to off-reservation commercial activities.2\nThus, faced with an unresolved question about a common-\nlaw doctrine of its own design, the Kiowa Court had to\n——————\n  2 The  Court in Kiowa noted that in one case, we upheld a claim of\nimmunity where “a state court had asserted jurisdiction over tribal\nfishing ‘both on and off its reservation.’ ” 523 U. S., at 754 (quoting\nPuyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Wash., 433 U. S. 165,\n167 (1977)). It went on to admit, however, that Puyallup “did not\ndiscuss the relevance of where the fishing had taken place.” 523 U. S.,\nat 754. And, as Justice Stevens explained in dissent, that case was\nabout whether the state courts had jurisdiction to regulate fishing\nactivities on the reservation; “we had no occasion to consider the\nvalidity of an injunction relating solely to off-reservation fishing.” Id.,\nat 763.\n8         MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmake a choice: tailor the immunity to the realities of their\ncommercial enterprises, or “grant . . . virtually unlimited\ntribal immunity.” Id., at 764 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\nThe Court took the latter course. In doing so, it did not\n“defe[r] to Congress or exercis[e] ‘caution,’—rather, it . . .\ncreat[ed] law.” Id., at 765 (citation omitted). To be sure,\nCongress had the power to “alter” that decision if it wanted.\nId., at 759 (majority opinion). But Congress has the au-\nthority to do that with respect to any nonconstitutional\ndecision involving federal law, and the mere existence of\nthis authority could not be the basis for choosing one\noutcome over another in Kiowa.3\n   Accident or no, it was this Court, not Congress, that\nadopted the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity in the\nfirst instance. And it was this Court that left open a\nquestion about its scope. Why should Congress—and only\nCongress, according to the Kiowa Court—have to take on a\nproblem this Court created? In other areas of federal\ncommon law, until Congress intervenes, it is up to us to\ncorrect our errors. See, e.g., Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker,\n554 U. S. 471, 507 (2008) (“[I]f, in the absence of legisla-\ntion, judicially derived standards leave the door open to\noutlier punitive-damages awards [in maritime law], it is\nhard to see how the judiciary can wash its hands of a\n——————\n   3 Nor did the Kiowa Court “defer” to any pre-existing congressional\n\npolicy choices. As I have already made clear, the rule the Court chose\nin Kiowa was divorced from, and in some ways contrary to any federal\ninterest. See Part I–A, supra; see also Kiowa, 523 U. S., at 765 (Ste-\nvens, J., dissenting). And the rule is a “strikingly anomalous” depar-\nture from the immunities of other sovereigns in federal and state court.\nIbid. (observing that Kiowa conferred on Indian tribes “broader immun-\nity than the States, the Federal Government, and foreign nations”); see\nalso Florey, Indian Country’s Borders: Territoriality, Immunity, and\nthe Construction of Tribal Sovereignty, 51 Boston College L. Rev. 595,\n627 (2010) (After Kiowa, “the actual contours of [tribal immunity]\nremain astonishingly broad”).\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S. 454, 456 (1945) (“[I]n the absence of an applica-\nble Act of Congress, federal courts must fashion the gov-\nerning rules” in commercial-paper cases affecting the\nrights and liabilities of the United States). We have the\nsame duty here.\n                             II\n  Today, the Court reaffirms Kiowa. Unsurprisingly, it\noffers no new substantive defense for Kiowa’s indefensible\nview of tribal immunity. Instead, the majority relies on a\ncombination of the Kiowa Court’s purported deference to\nCongress and considerations of stare decisis. I have al-\nready explained why it was error to ground the Kiowa rule\nin deference to Congress. I turn now to stare decisis.\nContrary to the majority’s claim, that policy does not\nrequire us to preserve this Court’s mistake in Kiowa. The\nCourt’s failure to justify Kiowa’s rule and the decision’s\nuntoward consequences outweigh the majority’s argu-\nments for perpetuating the error.\n                              A\n  Stare decisis may sometimes be “the preferred course,”\nbut as this Court acknowledges, it is “not an inexorable\ncommand.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827, 828\n(1991). “[W]hen governing decisions are unworkable or\nare badly reasoned,” id., at 827, or “experience has pointed\nup the precedent’s shortcomings,” Pearson v. Callahan,\n555 U. S. 223, 233 (2009), “ ‘this Court has never felt con-\nstrained to follow precedent,’ ” Payne, supra, at 827. See\nalso Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485\nU. S. 271, 282–283 (1988) (overruling precedent as “defi-\ncient in utility and sense,” “unsound in theory, unworka-\nble and arbitrary in practice, and unnecessary to achieve\nany legitimate goals”). The discussion above explains why\n10      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nKiowa was unpersuasive on its own terms. Now, the\nadverse consequences of that decision make it even more\nuntenable.\n   In the 16 years since Kiowa, the commercial activities of\ntribes have increased dramatically. This is especially evi-\ndent within the tribal gambling industry. Combined tribal\ngaming revenues in 28 States have more than tripled—from\n$8.5 billion in 1998 to $27.9 billion in 2012. National\nIndian Gaming Commission, 2012 Indian Gaming Reve-\nnues Increase 2.7 Percent (July 23, 2013), online at http://\nwww.nigc.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Fhd5shyZ1fM%3D\n(all Internet materials as visited May 2, 2014, and availa-\nble in Clerk of Court’s case file). But tribal businesses\nextend well beyond gambling and far past reservation\nborders. In addition to ventures that take advantage of\non-reservation resources (like tourism, recreation, mining,\nforestry, and agriculture), tribes engage in “domestic and\ninternational business ventures” including manufacturing,\nretail, banking, construction, energy, telecommunications,\nand more. Graham, An Interdisciplinary Approach to\nAmerican Indian Economic Development, 80 N. D. L. Rev.\n597, 600–604 (2004). Tribal enterprises run the gamut:\nthey sell cigarettes and prescription drugs online; engage\nin foreign financing; and operate greeting cards compa-\nnies, national banks, cement plants, ski resorts, and ho-\ntels. Ibid.; see also, e.g., The Harvard Project on American\nIndian Economic Development, The State of the Native\nNations 124 (2008) (Ho-Chunk, Inc., a tribal corporation\nof the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, operates “hotels\nin Nebraska and Iowa,” “numerous retail grocery\nand convenience stores,” a “tobacco and gasoline distribu-\ntion company,” and “a temporary labor service provider”);\nFour Fires, San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, http://\nwww.sanmanuel-nsn.gov/fourfires.php.html) (four Tribes from\nCalifornia and Wisconsin jointly own and operate a $43\nmillion hotel in Washington, D.

Tribal immunity significantly\nlimits, and often extinguishes, the States’ ability to protect\ntheir citizens and enforce the law against tribal busi-\nnesses. This case is but one example: No one can seriously\ndispute that Bay Mills’ operation of a casino outside its\nreservation (and thus within Michigan territory) would\nviolate both state law and the Tribe’s compact with Michi-\ngan. Yet, immunity poses a substantial impediment to\nMichigan’s efforts to halt the casino’s operation perma-\nnently. The problem repeats itself every time a tribe fails\nto pay state taxes, harms a tort victim, breaches a con-\ntract, or otherwise violates state laws, and tribal immu-\nnity bars the only feasible legal remedy. Given the wide\nreach of tribal immunity, such scenarios are common-\nplace.4 See, e.g., Oneida Indian Nation of New York v.\nMadison Cty., 605 F. 3d 149, 163 (CA2 2010) (Cabranes,\nJ., joined by Hall, J., concurring) (“The holding in this case\ncomes down to this: an Indian tribe can purchase land\n(including land that was never part of a reservation); refuse\n——————\n   4 Lower courts have held that tribal immunity shields not only Indian\n\ntribes themselves, but also entities deemed “arms of the tribe.” See,\ne.g., Breakthrough Management Group, Inc. v. Chukchansi Gold Casino\n& Resort, 629 F. 3d 1173, 1191–1195 (CA10 2010) (casino and economic\ndevelopment authority were arms of the Tribe); Memphis Biofuels, LLC\nv. Chickasaw Nation Industries, Inc., 585 F. 3d 917, 921 (CA6 2009)\n(tribal conglomerate was an arm of the Tribe). In addition, tribal\nimmunity has been interpreted to cover tribal employees and officials\nacting within the scope of their employment. See, e.g., Cook v. AVI\nCasino Enterprises, Inc., 548 F. 3d 718, 726–727 (CA9 2008); Native\nAmerican Distributing v. Seneca-Cayuga Tobacco Co., 546 F. 3d 1288,\n1296 (CA10 2008); Chayoon v.

For instance, payday lenders (companies that lend\nconsumers short-term advances on paychecks at interest\nrates that can reach upwards of 1,000 percent per annum)\noften arrange to share fees or profits with tribes so they\ncan use tribal immunity as a shield for conduct of ques-\ntionable legality.

Indian tribes have also\ncreated conflict in certain States by asserting tribal im-\nmunity as a defense against violations of state campaign\nfinance laws. See generally Moylan, Sovereign Rules of\nthe Game: Requiring Campaign Finance Disclosure in the\nFace of Tribal Sovereign Immunity, 20 B. U. Pub. Interest\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

J. 1 (2010).\n  In sum, any number of Indian tribes across the country\nhave emerged as substantial and successful competitors in\ninterstate and international commerce, both within and\nbeyond Indian lands. As long as tribal immunity remains\nout of sync with this reality, it will continue to invite\nproblems, including de facto deregulation of highly regu-\nlated activities; unfairness to tort victims; and increas-\ningly fractious relations with States and individuals alike.\nThe growing harms wrought by Kiowa’s unjustifiable rule\nfully justify overruling it.\n                                B\n   In support of its adherence to stare decisis, the majority\nasserts that “Congress has now reflected on Kiowa” and\nhas decided to “retain” the decision. Ante, at 18; see also\nante, at 19 (“[W]e act today against the backdrop of an\napparent congressional choice: to keep tribal immunity . . .\nin a case like this one”). On its face, however, this is a\ncurious assertion. To this day, Congress has never granted\ntribal sovereign immunity in any shape or form—much\nless immunity that extends as far as Kiowa went. What\nthe majority really means, I gather, is that the Court must\nstay its hand because Congress has implicitly approved of\nKiowa’s rule by not overturning it.\n   This argument from legislative inaction is unavailing.\nAs a practical matter, it is “ ‘ impossible to assert with any\ndegree of assurance that congressional failure to act rep-\nresents’ affirmative congressional approval of ” one of this\nCourt’s decisions. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491\nU. S. 164, 175, n. 1 (1989) (quoting Johnson v. Transporta-\ntion Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616, 672 (1987)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting)); see also Girouard v. United\nStates, 328 U. S. 61, 69 (1946) (“It is at best treacherous to\nfind in congressional silence alone the adoption of a con-\ntrolling rule of law”); Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106,\n14      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n121 (1940) (“[W]e walk on quicksand when we try to find\nin the absence of corrective legislation a controlling legal\nprinciple”). There are many reasons Congress might not\nact on a decision like Kiowa, and most of them have noth-\ning at all to do with Congress’ desire to preserve the deci-\nsion. See Johnson, 480 U. S., at 672 (SCALIA, J., dissent-\ning) (listing various kinds of legislative inertia, including\nan “inability to agree upon how to alter the status quo”\nand “indifference to the status quo”).\n   Even assuming the general validity of arguments from\nlegislative inaction, they are a poor fit in this common-law\ncontext. Such arguments are typically based on the prem-\nise that the failure of later Congresses to reject a judicial\ndecision interpreting a statute says something about what\nCongress understands the statute to mean. See, e.g., id.,\nat 629, n. 7 (majority opinion). But it is not clear why\nCongress’ unenacted “opinion” has any relevance to de-\ntermining the correctness of a decision about a doctrine\ncreated and shaped by this Court. Giving dispositive\nweight to congressional silence regarding a common-law\ndecision of this Court effectively codifies that decision\nbased only on Congress’ failure to address it. This ap-\nproach is at odds with our Constitution’s requirements for\nenacting law. Cf. Patterson, supra, at 175, n. 1 (“Congress\nmay legislate . . . only through the passage of a bill which\nis approved by both Houses and signed by the President.\nCongressional inaction cannot amend a duly enacted\nstatute” (citation omitted)). It is also the direct opposite of\nthis Court’s usual approach in common-law cases, where\nwe have made clear that, “in the absence of an applicable\nAct of Congress, federal courts must fashion the governing\nrules.” National Metropolitan Bank, 323 U. S., at 456; see\nalso supra, at 11–12; Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc.,\n398 U. S. 375, 378 (1970) (precedent barring recovery for\nwrongful death, “somewhat dubious even when rendered,\nis such an unjustifiable anomaly in the present maritime\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    15\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n[common] law that it should no longer be followed”).5\nAllowing legislative inaction to guide common-law deci-\nsionmaking is not deference, but abdication.6\n  In any event, because legislative inaction is usually\n\n——————\n    5 The majority appears to agree that the Court can revise the judicial\n\ndoctrine of tribal immunity, because it reserves the right to make an\n“off-reservation” tort exception to Kiowa’s blanket rule. See ante, at 16,\nn. 8. In light of that reservation, the majority’s declaration that it is\n“Congress’s job . . . to determine whether or how to limit tribal immu-\nnity” rings hollow. Id., at 17. Such a judge-made exception would no\nmore defer to Congress to “make the call whether to curtail a tribe’s\nimmunity” than would recognizing that Kiowa was wrongly decided in\nthe first instance. Id., at 18. In any event, I welcome the majority’s\ninterest in fulfilling its independent responsibility to correct Kiowa’s\nmistaken extension of immunity “without any exceptions for commer-\ncial or off-reservation conduct.” Id., at 15. I regret only that the Court\ndoes not see fit to take that step today.\n    6 Of course, stare decisis still applies in the common-law context; I\n\nreject only the notion that arguments from legislative inaction have any\nplace in the analysis.\n    I also reject the majority’s intimation that stare decisis applies as\nstrongly to common-law decisions as to those involving statutory\ninterpretation. The majority asserts that stare decisis should have\n“ ‘special force’ ” in this case because “ ‘Congress remains free to alter\nwhat we have done.’ ” Ante, at 16 (quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit\nUnion, 491 U. S. 164, 172–173 (1989)). Although the Court has invoked\nthis reasoning in the statutory context, I am not aware of a case in\nwhich we have relied upon it to preserve a common-law decision of this\nCourt. Indeed, we have minimized that reasoning when interpreting\nthe Sherman Act precisely because “the Court has treated the Sherman\nAct as a common-law statute.” Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc.\nv. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, 899 (2007) (emphasis added); see also\nState Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20–21 (1997) (“[T]he general pre-\nsumption that legislative changes should be left to Congress has less\nforce with respect to the Sherman Act in light of the accepted view that\nCongress ‘expected the courts to give shape to the statute’s broad\nmandate by drawing on common-law tradition’ ”). Surely no higher\nstandard of stare decisis can apply when dealing with common law\nproper, which Congress certainly expects the Court to shape in the\nabsence of legislative action. See, e.g., National Metropolitan Bank v.\nUnited States, 323 U. S. 454, 456 (1945).\n16      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nindeterminate, we “ ‘require very persuasive circumstances\nenveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from\nreexamining its own doctrines.’ ” Girouard, supra, at 69.\nHere, the majority provides nothing that solidifies the\ninference of approval it draws from congressional silence\nin the wake of Kiowa.\n   First, the majority cites two Senate bills that proposed\nto abrogate tribal immunity for contract and tort claims\nagainst tribes. See S. 2299, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998)\n(contract claims); S. 2302, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998)\n(tort claims). Neither bill expresses Congress’ views on\nKiowa’s rule, for both died in committee without a vote.\n   Second, the majority notes various post-Kiowa enact-\nments that either abrogate tribal immunity in various\nlimited contexts or leave it be. See ante, at 18, 19, n. 10.\nNone of these enactments provides a reason to believe that\nCongress both considered and approved Kiowa’s holding.\nNone of them targets with any precision the immunity of\nIndian tribes for off-reservation commercial activities.\nSee, e.g., Indian Tribal Economic Development and Con-\ntract Encouragement Act of 2000 (codified at 25 U. S. C.\n§81(d)(2)) (for contracts that encumber Indian lands for\nmore than seven years, tribes must either provide for\nbreach-of-contract remedies or disclose tribal immunity if\napplicable). And given the exceedingly narrow contexts in\nwhich these provisions apply, see, e.g., Arizona Water\nSettlements Act, §213(a)(2), 118 Stat. 3531 (abrogating\none tribe’s immunity for the limited purpose of enforcing\nwater settlements), the far stronger inference is that\nCongress simply did not address Kiowa or its extension of\nimmunity in these Acts; rather, Congress considered only\nwhether an abrogation of judge-made tribal immunity was\nnecessary to the narrow regulatory scheme on the table.\nSee, e.g., Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009,\n§§2(e), 3(a), 124 Stat. 1101, 1108.\n   The majority posits that its inference of congressional\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\napproval of Kiowa is stronger because Congress failed to\nact after the Kiowa Court “urg[ed]” Congress to consider\nthe question presented. Ante, at 17, 19–20 (quoting\nKiowa, 523 U. S., at 758) (“[W]e defer to the role Congress\nmay wish to exercise in this important judgment”). But\nthis circumstance too raises any number of inferences.\nCongress is under no obligation to review and respond to\nevery statement this Court makes; perhaps legislative\ninertia simply won out. The majority seems to suggest\nthat Congress understood Kiowa to assign the burgeoning\nproblems of expansive common-law immunity to the Legis-\nlature, and then chose to let those problems fester. But\nCongress has not explained its inaction, and we should not\npretend that it has done so by remaining silent after we\nsupposedly prodded it to say something. Even if we credit\nthe relevance of post-Kiowa congressional silence in this\ncommon-law context—and I do not—there is certainly not\nenough evidence of congressional acquiescence here “that\nwe can properly place on the shoulders of Congress the\nburden of the Court’s own error.” Girouard, 328 U. S., at\n69–70.\n                              C\n   The majority’s remaining arguments for retaining Kiowa\nare also unconvincing.\n   First, the majority characterizes Kiowa as one case in a\n“long line of precedents” in which the Court has recognized\ntribal immunity “without any exceptions for commercial or\noff-reservation conduct.” Ante, at 15. True, the Court has\nrelied on tribal immunity as a general matter in several\ncases. But not until Kiowa were we required to decide\nwhether immunity should extend to commercial activities\nbeyond Indian reservations. See supra, at 7. And after\nKiowa, we have mentioned it only once, and then only in\ndicta. C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi\nTribe of Okla., 532 U. S. 411, 418 (2001) (holding that the\n18      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nTribe had waived its immunity in a construction contract).\nThus, overturning Kiowa would overturn Kiowa only.\n   Second, the majority suggests that tribes and their\nbusiness partners have now relied on Kiowa in structuring\ntheir contracts and transactions. Ante, at 15. But even\nwhen Kiowa extended the scope of tribal immunity, it was\nreadily apparent that the Court had strong misgivings\nabout it. Not one Member of the Kiowa Court identified a\nsubstantive justification for its extension of immunity:\nThree would not have expanded the immunity in the first\nplace, Kiowa, 523 U. S., at 760 (Stevens, J., dissenting),\nand the other six essentially expressed hope that Congress\nwould overrule the Court’s decision, see id., at 758–759.\nAgainst that backdrop, it would hardly be reasonable for a\ntribe to rely on Kiowa as a permanent grant of immunity\nfor off-reservation commercial activities. In any event, the\nutter absence of a reasoned justification for Kiowa’s rule\nand its growing adverse effects easily outweigh this gen-\neralized assertion of reliance. See, e.g., Leegin Creative\nLeather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, 906\n(2007) (in the antitrust context, overturning the per se rule\nagainst vertical price restraints in part because the “reli-\nance interests” in the case could not “justify an inefficient\nrule”).\n                        *     *     *\n  In Kiowa, this Court adopted a rule without a reason: a\nsweeping immunity from suit untethered from commercial\nrealities and the usual justifications for immunity, prem-\nised on the misguided notion that only Congress can place\nsensible limits on a doctrine we created. The decision was\nmistaken then, and the Court’s decision to reaffirm it in\nthe face of the unfairness and conflict it has engendered is\ndoubly so.

Argued December 2, 2013—Decided May 27, 2014\nThe State of Michigan, petitioner, entered into a compact with respond-\n  ent Bay Mills Indian Community pursuant to the Indian Gaming\n  Regulatory Act (IGRA). See 25 U. S. C. §2710(d)(1)(C). The compact\n  authorizes Bay Mills to conduct class III gaming activities (i.e., to op-\n  erate a casino) on Indian lands located within the State’s borders, but\n  prohibits it from doing so outside that territory. Bay Mills later\n  opened a second casino on land it had purchased through a congres-\n  sionally established land trust. The Tribe claimed it could operate a\n  casino there because the property qualified as Indian land. Michigan\n  disagreed and sued the Tribe under §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), which allows a\n  State to enjoin “class III gaming activity located on Indian lands and\n  conducted in violation of any Tribal-State compact.” The District\n  Court granted the injunction, but the Sixth Circuit vacated. It held\n  that tribal sovereign immunity barred the suit unless Congress pro-\n  vided otherwise, and that §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) only authorized suits to\n  enjoin gaming activity located “on Indian lands,” whereas Michigan’s\n  complaint alleged the casino was outside such territory.\nHeld: Michigan’s suit against Bay Mills is barred by tribal sovereign\n immunity. Pp. 4–21.\n    (a) As “ ‘domestic dependent nations,’ ” Indian tribes exercise “in-\n herent sovereign authority” that is subject to plenary control by Con-\n gress. Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of\n Okla., 498 U. S. 505, 509. Unless and “until Congress acts, the tribes\n retain” their historic sovereign authority. United States v. Wheeler,\n 435 U. S. 313, 323. Among the core aspects of sovereignty that tribes\n possess—subject to congressional action—is the “common-law im-\n munity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers.” Santa\n Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 58. That immunity applies\n2           MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    whether a suit is brought by a State, see, e.g., Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v.\n    Department of Game of Wash., 433 U. S. 165, or arises from a tribe’s\n    commercial activities off Indian lands, see Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v.\n    Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751. Therefore, unless\n    Congress has “unequivocally” authorized Michigan’s suit, C & L En-\n    terprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 532 U. S.\n    411, 418, it must be dismissed. Pp. 4–8.\n       (b) IGRA’s plain terms do not authorize this suit.             Section\n    2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) partially abrogates tribal immunity with respect to\n    class III gaming located “on Indian lands,” but the very premise of\n    Michigan’s suit is that Bay Mills’ casino is unlawful because it is out-\n    side Indian lands. Michigan argues that the casino is authorized, li-\n    censed, and operated from within the reservation, and that such ad-\n    ministrative action constitutes “class III gaming activity.” However,\n    numerous other IGRA provisions make clear that “class III gaming\n    activity” refers to the gambling that goes on in a casino, not the off-\n    site licensing of such games. See, e.g., §§2710(d)(3)(C)(i), (d)(9).\n    IGRA’s history and design also explain why Congress would have au-\n    thorized a State to enjoin illegal tribal gaming on Indian lands but\n    not on lands subject to the State’s own sovereign jurisdiction. Con-\n    gress adopted IGRA in response to California v. Cabazon Band of\n    Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202, 221–222, which held that States\n    lacked regulatory authority over gaming on Indian lands but left in-\n    tact States’ regulatory power over tribal gaming outside Indian terri-\n    tory. A State therefore has many tools to enforce its law on state\n    land that it does not possess in Indian territory, including, e.g., bring-\n    ing a civil or criminal action against tribal officials rather than the\n    tribe itself for conducting illegal gaming. A State can also use its lev-\n    erage in negotiating an IGRA compact to bargain for a waiver of the\n    tribe’s immunity. Pp. 8–14.\n       (c) Michigan urges the Court to overrule Kiowa and hold that tribal\n    immunity does not apply to commercial activity outside Indian terri-\n    tory. However, “any departure” from precedent “demands special jus-\n    tification,” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212, and Michigan of-\n    fers nothing more than arguments already rejected in Kiowa. Kiowa\n    rejected these arguments because it is fundamentally Congress’s job\n    to determine whether or how to limit tribal immunity; Congress had\n    restricted tribal immunity “in limited circumstances” like\n    §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), while “in other statutes” declaring an “intention\n    not to alter it.” 523 U. S., at 758. Kiowa therefore chose to “defer to\n    the role Congress may wish to exercise in this important judgment.”\n    Ibid. Congress has since reflected on Kiowa and decided to retain\n    tribal immunity in a case like this.

BAY MILLS INDIAN \n\n               COMMUNITY ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                  [May 27, 2014] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The question in this case is whether tribal sovereign\nimmunity bars Michigan’s suit against the Bay Mills\nIndian Community for opening a casino outside Indian\nlands. We hold that immunity protects Bay Mills from\nthis legal action. Congress has not abrogated tribal sover-\neign immunity from a State’s suit to enjoin gaming off a\nreservation or other Indian lands. And we decline to\nrevisit our prior decisions holding that, absent such an\nabrogation (or a waiver), Indian tribes have immunity\neven when a suit arises from off-reservation commercial\nactivity. Michigan must therefore resort to other mecha-\nnisms, including legal actions against the responsible\nindividuals, to resolve this dispute.\n                            I\n  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA or Act), 102\nStat. 2467, 25 U. S. C. §2701 et seq., creates a framework\nfor regulating gaming activity on Indian lands.1 See\n——————\n  1 The Act defines “Indian lands” as “(A) all lands within the limits of\n\nany Indian reservation; and (B) any lands title to which is either held\n2        MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n§2702(3) (describing the statute’s purpose as establishing\n“regulatory authority . . . [and] standards for gaming on\nIndian lands”). The Act divides gaming into three classes.\nClass III gaming, the most closely regulated and the kind\ninvolved here, includes casino games, slot machines, and\nhorse racing. See §2703(8). A tribe may conduct such\ngaming on Indian lands only pursuant to, and in compli-\nance with, a compact it has negotiated with the sur-\nrounding State. See §2710(d)(1)(C). A compact typically\nprescribes rules for operating gaming, allocates law\nenforcement authority between the tribe and State, and\nprovides remedies for breach of the agreement’s terms.\nSee §§2710(d)(3)(C)(ii), (v). Notable here, IGRA itself\nauthorizes a State to bring suit against a tribe for certain\nconduct violating a compact: Specifically, §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii)\nallows a State to sue in federal court to “enjoin a class III\ngaming activity located on Indian lands and conducted in\nviolation of any Tribal-State compact . . . that is in effect.”\n  Pursuant to the Act, Michigan and Bay Mills, a federally\nrecognized Indian Tribe, entered into a compact in 1993.\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a–96a. The compact empow-\ners Bay Mills to conduct class III gaming on “Indian\nlands”; conversely, it prohibits the Tribe from doing so\noutside that territory. Id., at 78a, 83a; see n. 1, supra.\nThe compact also contains a dispute resolution mecha-\nnism, which sends to arbitration any contractual differ-\nences the parties cannot settle on their own. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 89a–90a. A provision within that arbitration\nsection states that “[n]othing in this Compact shall be\ndeemed a waiver” of either the Tribe’s or the State’s sover-\neign immunity. Id., at 90a. Since entering into the com-\n\n——————\nin trust by the United States for the benefit of any Indian tribe or\nindividual[,] or held by any Indian tribe or individual subject to re-\nstriction by the United States against alienation and over which an\nIndian tribe exercises governmental power.” §2703(4).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npact, Bay Mills has operated class III gaming, as author-\nized, on its reservation in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.\n   In 2010, Bay Mills opened another class III gaming\nfacility in Vanderbilt, a small village in Michigan’s Lower\nPeninsula about 125 miles from the Tribe’s reservation.\nBay Mills had bought the Vanderbilt property with ac-\ncrued interest from a federal appropriation, which Con-\ngress had made to compensate the Tribe for 19th-century\ntakings of its ancestral lands. See Michigan Indian Land\nClaims Settlement Act, 111 Stat. 2652. Congress had\ndirected that a portion of the appropriated funds go into a\n“Land Trust” whose earnings the Tribe was to use to\nimprove or purchase property. According to the legisla-\ntion, any land so acquired “shall be held as Indian lands\nare held.” §107(a)(3), id., at 2658. Citing that provision,\nBay Mills contended that the Vanderbilt property was\n“Indian land” under IGRA and the compact; and the Tribe\nthus claimed authority to operate a casino there.\n   Michigan disagreed: The State sued Bay Mills in federal\ncourt to enjoin operation of the new casino, alleging that\nthe facility violated IGRA and the compact because it was\nlocated outside Indian lands. The same day Michigan filed\nsuit, the federal Department of the Interior issued an\nopinion concluding (as the State’s complaint said) that the\nTribe’s use of Land Trust earnings to purchase the Van-\nderbilt property did not convert it into Indian territory.\nSee App. 69–101. The District Court entered a prelimi-\nnary injunction against Bay Mills, which promptly shut\ndown the new casino and took an interlocutory appeal.\nWhile that appeal was pending, Michigan amended its\ncomplaint to join various tribal officials as defendants, as\nwell as to add state law and federal common law claims.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit then vacated\nthe injunction, holding (among other things) that tribal\nsovereign immunity barred Michigan’s suit against Bay\nMills unless Congress provided otherwise, and that\n4           MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n§2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) did not authorize the action. See 695\nF. 3d 406, 413–415 (2012). That provision of IGRA, the\nSixth Circuit reasoned, permitted a suit against the Tribe\nto enjoin only gaming activity located on Indian lands,\nwhereas the State’s complaint alleged that the Vanderbilt\ncasino was outside such territory. See id., at 412.2 Ac-\ncordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that Michigan\ncould proceed, if at all, solely against the individual de-\nfendants, and it remanded to the District Court to consider\nthose claims. See id., at 416–417.3 Although no injunc-\ntion is currently in effect, Bay Mills has not reopened the\nVanderbilt casino.\n   We granted certiorari to consider whether tribal sover-\neign immunity bars Michigan’s suit against Bay Mills, 570\nU. S. __ (2013), and we now affirm the Court of Appeals’\njudgment.\n                           II\n  Indian tribes are “ ‘domestic dependent nations’ ” that\nexercise “inherent sovereign authority.” Oklahoma Tax\n——————\n    2 TheSixth Circuit framed part of its analysis in jurisdictional terms,\nholding that the District Court had no authority to consider Michigan’s\nIGRA claim because §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) provides federal jurisdiction only\nover suits to enjoin gaming on Indian lands (and Michigan’s suit was\nnot that). See 695 F. 3d, at 412–413. That reasoning is wrong, as all\nparties agree. See Brief for Michigan 22–25; Brief for Bay Mills 23–24;\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16–17. The general federal-\nquestion statute, 28 U. S. C. §1331, gives a district court subject matter\njurisdiction to decide any claim alleging a violation of IGRA. Nothing\nin §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) or any other provision of IGRA limits that grant of\njurisdiction (although those provisions may indicate that a party has no\nstatutory right of action). See Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n\nof Md., 535 U. S. 635, 643–644 (2002).\n   3 The Court of Appeals’ decision applied not only to Michigan’s case,\n\nbut also to a consolidated case brought by the Little Traverse Bay\nBands of Odawa Indians, which operates a casino about 40 miles from\nthe Vanderbilt property. Little Traverse subsequently dismissed its\nsuit, rather than seek review in this Court.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nComm’n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498\nU. S. 505, 509 (1991) (Potawatomi) (quoting Cherokee\nNation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831)). As dependents, the\ntribes are subject to plenary control by Congress. See\nUnited States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 200 (2004) (“[T]he\nConstitution grants Congress” powers “we have consist-\nently described as ‘plenary and exclusive’ ” to “legislate in\nrespect to Indian tribes”). And yet they remain “separate\nsovereigns pre-existing the Constitution.” Santa Clara\nPueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 56 (1978). Thus, unless\nand “until Congress acts, the tribes retain” their historic\nsovereign authority. United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S.\n313, 323 (1978).\n   Among the core aspects of sovereignty that tribes pos-\nsess—subject, again, to congressional action—is the\n“common-law immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by\nsovereign powers.” Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U. S., at 58.\nThat immunity, we have explained, is “a necessary corol-\nlary to Indian sovereignty and self-governance.” Three\nAffiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold\nEngineering, P. C., 476 U. S. 877, 890 (1986); cf. The Fed-\neralist No. 81, p. 511 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton)\n(It is “inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be ame-\nnable” to suit without consent). And the qualified nature\nof Indian sovereignty modifies that principle only by plac-\ning a tribe’s immunity, like its other governmental powers\nand attributes, in Congress’s hands. See United States v.\nUnited States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506, 512\n(1940) (USF&G) (“It is as though the immunity which was\ntheirs as sovereigns passed to the United States for their\nbenefit”). Thus, we have time and again treated the “doc-\ntrine of tribal immunity [as] settled law” and dismissed\nany suit against a tribe absent congressional authorization\n(or a waiver). Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing\nTechnologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751, 756 (1998).\n   In doing so, we have held that tribal immunity applies\n6       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nno less to suits brought by States (including in their own\ncourts) than to those by individuals. First in Puyallup\nTribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Wash., 433 U. S. 165,\n167–168, 172–173 (1977), and then again in Potawatomi,\n498 U. S., at 509–510, we barred a State seeking to en-\nforce its laws from filing suit against a tribe, rejecting\narguments grounded in the State’s own sovereignty. In\neach case, we said a State must resort to other remedies,\neven if they would be less “efficient.” Id., at 514; see\nKiowa, 523 U. S., at 755 (“There is a difference between\nthe right to demand compliance with state laws and the\nmeans available to enforce them”). That is because, as we\nhave often stated (and contrary to the dissent’s novel\npronouncement, see post, at 3 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)\n(hereinafter the dissent)), tribal immunity “is a matter of\nfederal law and is not subject to diminution by the States.”\n523 U. S., at 756 (citing Three Affiliated Tribes, 476 U. S.,\nat 891; Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville\nReservation, 447 U. S. 134, 154 (1980)). Or as we else-\nwhere explained: While each State at the Constitutional\nConvention surrendered its immunity from suit by sister\nStates, “it would be absurd to suggest that the tribes”—at\na conference “to which they were not even parties”—\nsimilarly ceded their immunity against state-initiated\nsuits. Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S.\n775, 782 (1991).\n  Equally important here, we declined in Kiowa to make\nany exception for suits arising from a tribe’s commercial\nactivities, even when they take place off Indian lands. In\nthat case, a private party sued a tribe in state court for\ndefaulting on a promissory note. The plaintiff asked this\nCourt to confine tribal immunity to suits involving conduct\non “reservations or to noncommercial activities.” 523\nU. S., at 758. We said no. We listed Puyallup, Potawa-\ntomi, and USF&G as precedents applying immunity to a\nsuit predicated on a tribe’s commercial conduct—\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrespectively, fishing, selling cigarettes, and leasing coal\nmines. 523 U. S., at 754–755. Too, we noted that\nPuyallup involved enterprise “both on and off [the Tribe’s]\nreservation.” 523 U. S., at 754 (quoting 433 U. S., at 167).\n“[O]ur precedents,” we thus concluded, have not previously\n“drawn the[ ] distinctions” the plaintiff pressed in the case.\n523 U. S., at 755. They had established a broad principle,\nfrom which we thought it improper suddenly to start\ncarving out exceptions. Rather, we opted to “defer” to\nCongress about whether to abrogate tribal immunity for\noff-reservation commercial conduct. Id., at 758, 760; see\ninfra, at 17–18.\n  Our decisions establish as well that such a congressional\ndecision must be clear. The baseline position, we have\noften held, is tribal immunity; and “[t]o abrogate [such]\nimmunity, Congress must ‘unequivocally’ express that\npurpose.” C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Pota-\nwatomi Tribe of Okla., 532 U. S. 411, 418 (2001) (quoting\nSanta Clara Pueblo, 436 U. S., at 58). That rule of con-\nstruction reflects an enduring principle of Indian law:\nAlthough Congress has plenary authority over tribes,\ncourts will not lightly assume that Congress in fact in-\ntends to undermine Indian self-government. See, e.g., id.,\nat 58–60; Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9, 18\n(1987); United States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734, 738–739\n(1986).\n  The upshot is this: Unless Congress has authorized\nMichigan’s suit, our precedents demand that it be dis-\nmissed.4 And so Michigan, naturally enough, makes two\narguments: first, that IGRA indeed abrogates the Tribe’s\nimmunity from the State’s suit; and second, that if it\ndoes not, we should revisit—and reverse—our decision in\n——————\n  4 Michigan does not argue here that Bay Mills waived its immunity\n\nfrom suit. Recall that the compact expressly preserves both the Tribe’s\nand the State’s sovereign immunity. See supra, at 2.\n8       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nKiowa, so that tribal immunity no longer applies to claims\narising from commercial activity outside Indian lands. We\nconsider—and reject—each contention in turn.\n                               III\n   IGRA partially abrogates tribal sovereign immunity in\n§2710(d)(7)(A)(ii)—but this case, viewed most naturally,\nfalls outside that term’s ambit. The provision, as noted\nabove, authorizes a State to sue a tribe to “enjoin a class\nIII gaming activity located on Indian lands and conducted\nin violation of any Tribal-State compact.” See supra, at 2;\nKiowa, 523 U. S., at 758 (citing the provision as an exam-\nple of legislation “restrict[ing] tribal immunity from suit in\nlimited circumstances”). A key phrase in that abrogation\nis “on Indian lands”—three words reflecting IGRA’s over-\nall scope (and repeated some two dozen times in the stat-\nute). A State’s suit to enjoin gaming activity on Indian\nlands (assuming other requirements are met, see n. 6,\ninfra) falls within §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii); a similar suit to stop\ngaming activity off Indian lands does not. And that cre-\nates a fundamental problem for Michigan. After all, the\nvery premise of this suit—the reason Michigan thinks Bay\nMills is acting unlawfully—is that the Vanderbilt casino is\noutside Indian lands. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a–60a.\nBy dint of that theory, a suit to enjoin gaming in Vander-\nbilt is correspondingly outside §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii)’s abroga-\ntion of immunity.\n   Michigan first attempts to fit this suit within\n§2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) by relocating the “class III gaming activ-\nity” to which it is objecting. True enough, Michigan states,\nthe Vanderbilt casino lies outside Indian lands. But Bay\nMills “authorized, licensed, and operated” that casino from\nwithin its own reservation. Brief for Michigan 20. Accord-\ning to the State, that necessary administrative action—no\nless than, say, dealing craps—is “class III gaming activ-\nity,” and because it occurred on Indian land, this suit to\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nenjoin it can go forward.\n   But that argument comes up snake eyes, because nu-\nmerous provisions of IGRA show that “class III gaming\nactivity” means just what it sounds like—the stuff in-\nvolved in playing class III games.               For example,\n§2710(d)(3)(C)(i) refers to “the licensing and regulation of\n[a class III gaming] activity” and §2710(d)(9) concerns the\n“operation of a class III gaming activity.” Those phrases\nmake perfect sense if “class III gaming activity” is what\ngoes on in a casino—each roll of the dice and spin of the\nwheel. But they lose all meaning if, as Michigan argues,\n“class III gaming activity” refers equally to the off-site\nlicensing or operation of the games. (Just plug in those\nwords and see what happens.) See also §§2710(b)(2)(A),\n(b)(4)(A), (c)(4), (d)(1)(A) (similarly referring to class II or\nIII “gaming activity”). The same holds true throughout\nthe statute. Section 2717(a)(1) specifies fees to be paid by\n“each gaming operation that conducts a class II or class III\ngaming activity”—signifying that the gaming activity is\nthe gambling in the poker hall, not the proceedings of the\noff-site administrative authority. And §§2706(a)(5) and\n2713(b)(1) together describe a federal agency’s power to\n“clos[e] a gaming activity” for “substantial violation[s]” of\nlaw—e.g., to shut down crooked blackjack tables, not the\ntribal regulatory body meant to oversee them. Indeed,\nconsider IGRA’s very first finding: Many tribes, Congress\nstated, “have licensed gaming activities on Indian lands,”\nthereby necessitating federal regulation. §2701(1). The\n“gaming activit[y]” is (once again) the gambling. And that\nmeans §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) does not allow Michigan’s suit\neven if Bay Mills took action on its reservation to license\nor oversee the Vanderbilt facility.\n   Stymied under §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), Michigan next urges\nus to adopt a “holistic method” of interpreting IGRA that\nwould allow a State to sue a tribe for illegal gaming off, no\nless than on, Indian lands. Brief for Michigan 30. Michi-\n10        MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ngan asks here that we consider “IGRA’s text and structure\nas a whole.” Id., at 28. But (with one briefly raised excep-\ntion) Michigan fails to identify any specific textual or\nstructural features of the statute to support its proposed\nresult.5 Rather, Michigan highlights a (purported) anomaly\nof the statute as written: that it enables a State to sue a\ntribe for illegal gaming inside, but not outside, Indian\ncountry. “[W]hy,” Michigan queries, “would Congress\nauthorize a state to obtain a federal injunction against\nillegal tribal gaming on Indian lands, but not on lands\nsubject to the state’s own sovereign jurisdiction?” Reply\nBrief 1. That question has no answer, Michigan argues:\nWhatever words Congress may have used in IGRA, it\ncould not have intended that senseless outcome. See Brief\nfor Michigan 28.\n   But this Court does not revise legislation, as Michigan\nproposes, just because the text as written creates an ap-\nparent anomaly as to some subject it does not address.\nTruth be told, such anomalies often arise from statutes, if\n——————\n  5 Michigan’s single reference to another statutory provision, 18\n\nU. S. C. §1166, does not advance its argument, because that term\nincludes a geographical limitation similar to the one appearing in\n§2710(d)(7)(A)(ii). Section 1166 makes a State’s gambling laws applica-\nble “in Indian country” as federal law, and then gives the Federal\nGovernment “exclusive jurisdiction over criminal prosecutions” for\nviolating those laws. 18 U. S. C. §1166(a), (d). Michigan briefly argues\nthat, by negative implication, §1166 gives a State the power “to bring a\ncivil suit to enforce [its] anti-gambling laws in Indian country,” and\nthat this power applies “even when the defendant is an Indian tribe.”\nBrief for Michigan 26 (emphasis added). Bay Mills and the United\nStates vigorously contest both those propositions, arguing that §1166\ngives States no civil enforcement authority at all, much less as against\na tribe. See Brief for Bay Mills 30–31; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 20–22. But that dispute is irrelevant here. Even\nassuming Michigan’s double inference were valid, §1166 would still\nallow a State to sue a tribe for gaming only “in Indian country.” So\nMichigan’s suit, alleging that illegal gaming occurred on state lands,\ncould no more proceed under §1166 than under §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii).\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor no other reason than that Congress typically legislates\nby parts—addressing one thing without examining all\nothers that might merit comparable treatment. Rejecting\na similar argument that a statutory anomaly (between\nproperty and non-property taxes) made “not a whit of\nsense,” we explained in one recent case that “Congress\nwrote the statute it wrote”—meaning, a statute going so\nfar and no further. See CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama\nDept. of Revenue, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 17–\n18). The same could be said of IGRA’s abrogation of tribal\nimmunity for gaming “on Indian lands.” This Court has\nno roving license, in even ordinary cases of statutory\ninterpretation, to disregard clear language simply on the\nview that (in Michigan’s words) Congress “must have\nintended” something broader. Brief for Michigan 32. And\nstill less do we have that warrant when the consequence\nwould be to expand an abrogation of immunity, because\n(as explained earlier) “Congress must ‘unequivocally’\nexpress [its] purpose” to subject a tribe to litigation.\nC & L Enterprises, 532 U. S., at 418; see supra, at 7.\n   In any event, IGRA’s history and design provide a more\nthan intelligible answer to the question Michigan poses\nabout why Congress would have confined a State’s author-\nity to sue a tribe as §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) does. Congress\nadopted IGRA in response to this Court’s decision in Cali-\nfornia v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202,\n221–222 (1987), which held that States lacked any regula-\ntory authority over gaming on Indian lands. Cabazon left\nfully intact a State’s regulatory power over tribal gaming\noutside Indian territory—which, as we will soon show, is\ncapacious. See infra, at 12–13. So the problem Congress\nset out to address in IGRA (Cabazon’s ouster of state\nauthority) arose in Indian lands alone. And the solution\nCongress devised, naturally enough, reflected that fact.\nSee, e.g., Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 58\n(1996) (“[T]he Act grants the States a power that they\n12        MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwould not otherwise have, viz., some measure of author-\nity over gaming on Indian lands”). Everything—literally\neverything—in IGRA affords tools (for either state or\nfederal officials) to regulate gaming on Indian lands, and\nnowhere else. Small surprise that IGRA’s abrogation of\ntribal immunity does that as well.6\n   And the resulting world, when considered functionally,\nis not nearly so “enigma[tic]” as Michigan suggests. Reply\nBrief 1. True enough, a State lacks the ability to sue a\ntribe for illegal gaming when that activity occurs off the\nreservation. But a State, on its own lands, has many\nother powers over tribal gaming that it does not possess\n(absent consent) in Indian territory. Unless federal law\nprovides differently, “Indians going beyond reservation\nboundaries” are subject to any generally applicable state\nlaw. See Wagnon v. Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, 546\nU. S. 95, 113 (2005) (quoting Mescalero Apache Tribe v.\nJones, 411 U. S. 145, 148 (1973)). So, for example, Michi-\ngan could, in the first instance, deny a license to Bay Mills\nfor an off-reservation casino. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n——————\n  6 Indeed, the statutory abrogation does not even cover all suits to\nenjoin gaming on Indian lands, thus refuting the very premise of\nMichigan’s argument-from-anomaly. Section 2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), recall,\nallows a State to sue a tribe not for all “class III gaming activity located\non Indian lands” (as Michigan suggests), but only for such gaming as is\n“conducted in violation of any Tribal-State compact . . . that is in effect.”\nAccordingly, if a tribe opens a casino on Indian lands before negotiating\na compact, the surrounding State cannot sue; only the Federal Gov-\nernment can enforce the law. See 18 U. S. C. §1166(d). To be precise,\nthen, IGRA’s authorization of suit mirrors not the full problem Cabazon\ncreated (a vacuum of state authority over gaming in Indian country)\nbut, more particularly, Congress’s “carefully crafted” compact-based\nsolution to that difficulty. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S.\n44, 73–74 (1996). So Michigan’s binary challenge—if a State can sue to\nstop gaming in Indian country, why not off?—fails out of the starting\ngate. In fact, a State cannot sue to enjoin all gaming in Indian country;\nthat gaming must, in addition, violate an agreement that the State and\ntribe have mutually entered.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n§§432.206–432.206a (West 2001). And if Bay Mills went\nahead anyway, Michigan could bring suit against tribal\nofficials or employees (rather than the Tribe itself) seeking\nan injunction for, say, gambling without a license. See\n§432.220; see also §600.3801(1)(a) (West 2013) (designat-\ning illegal gambling facilities as public nuisances). As this\nCourt has stated before, analogizing to Ex parte Young,\n209 U. S. 123 (1908), tribal immunity does not bar such\na suit for injunctive relief against individuals, includ-\ning tribal officers, responsible for unlawful conduct. See\nSanta Clara Pueblo, 436 U. S., at 59. And to the extent\ncivil remedies proved inadequate, Michigan could resort to\nits criminal law, prosecuting anyone who maintains—or\neven frequents—an unlawful gambling establishment.\nSee Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§432.218 (West 2001),\n750.303, 750.309 (West 2004). In short (and contrary to\nthe dissent’s unsupported assertion, see post, at 11), the\npanoply of tools Michigan can use to enforce its law on its\nown lands—no less than the suit it could bring on Indian\nlands under §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii)—can shutter, quickly and\npermanently, an illegal casino.7\n   Finally, if a State really wants to sue a tribe for gaming\noutside Indian lands, the State need only bargain for a\nwaiver of immunity. Under IGRA, a State and tribe nego-\ntiating a compact “may include . . . remedies for breach of\ncontract,” 25 U. S. C. §2710(d)(3)(C)(v)—including a provi-\nsion allowing the State to bring an action against the tribe\nin the circumstances presented here. States have more\n——————\n  7 Michigan   contends that these alternative remedies may be more\nintrusive on, or less respectful of, tribal sovereignty than the suit it\nwants to bring. See Brief for Michigan 15; Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. Bay\nMills, which presumably is better positioned to address that question,\nemphatically disagrees. See id., at 32–33. And the law supports Bay\nMills’ position: Dispensing with the immunity of a sovereign for fear of\npursuing available remedies against its officers or other individuals\nwould upend all known principles of sovereign immunity.\n14      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthan enough leverage to obtain such terms because a tribe\ncannot conduct class III gaming on its lands without a\ncompact, see §2710(d)(1)(C), and cannot sue to enforce a\nState’s duty to negotiate a compact in good faith, see\nSeminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 47 (holding a State immune\nfrom such suits). So as Michigan forthrightly acknowl-\nedges, “a party dealing with a tribe in contract negotia-\ntions has the power to protect itself by refusing to deal\nabsent the tribe’s waiver of sovereign immunity from suit.”\nBrief for Michigan 40. And many States have taken that\npath. See Brief for Seminole Tribe of Florida et al. as\nAmici Curiae 12–22 (listing compacts with waivers of tribal\nimmunity). To be sure, Michigan did not: As noted earlier,\nthe compact at issue here, instead of authorizing judicial\nremedies, sends disputes to arbitration and expressly\nretains each party’s sovereign immunity. See supra, at 2.\nBut Michigan—like any State—could have insisted on a\ndifferent deal (and indeed may do so now for the future,\nbecause the current compact has expired and remains in\neffect only until the parties negotiate a new one, see Tr. of\nOral Arg. 21). And in that event, the limitation Congress\nplaced on IGRA’s abrogation of tribal immunity—whether\nor not anomalous as an abstract matter—would have\nmade no earthly difference.\n                             IV\n  Because IGRA’s plain terms do not abrogate Bay Mills’\nimmunity from this suit, Michigan (and the dissent) must\nmake a more dramatic argument: that this Court should\n“revisit[ ] Kiowa’s holding” and rule that tribes “have no\nimmunity for illegal commercial activity outside their\nsovereign territory.” Reply Brief 8, 10; see post, at 1.\nMichigan argues that tribes increasingly participate in off-\nreservation gaming and other commercial activity, and\noperate in that capacity less as governments than as\nprivate businesses. See Brief for Michigan 38 (noting,\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\namong other things, that “tribal gaming revenues have\nmore than tripled” since Kiowa). Further, Michigan con-\ntends, tribes have broader immunity from suits arising\nfrom such conduct than other sovereigns—most notably,\nbecause Congress enacted legislation limiting foreign\nnations’ immunity for commercial activity in the United\nStates. See id., at 41; 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(2). It is time,\nMichigan concludes, to “level[ ] the playing field.” Brief for\nMichigan 38.\n   But this Court does not overturn its precedents lightly.\nStare decisis, we have stated, “is the preferred course\nbecause it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and\nconsistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance\non judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and\nperceived integrity of the judicial process.” Payne v. Ten-\nnessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991). Although “not an inexo-\nrable command,” id., at 828, stare decisis is a foundation\nstone of the rule of law, necessary to ensure that legal\nrules develop “in a principled and intelligible fashion,”\nVasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986). For that\nreason, this Court has always held that “any departure”\nfrom the doctrine “demands special justification.” Arizona\nv. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).\n   And that is more than usually so in the circumstances\nhere. First, Kiowa itself was no one-off: Rather, in reject-\ning the identical argument Michigan makes, our decision\nreaffirmed a long line of precedents, concluding that “the\ndoctrine of tribal immunity”—without any exceptions for\ncommercial or off-reservation conduct—“is settled law and\ncontrols this case.” 523 U. S., at 756; see id., at 754–755;\nsupra, at 5–7. Second, we have relied on Kiowa subse-\nquently: In another case involving a tribe’s off-reservation\ncommercial conduct, we began our analysis with Kiowa’s\nholding that tribal immunity applies to such activity (and\nthen found that the Tribe had waived its protection). See\nC & L Enterprises, 532 U. S., at 418. Third, tribes across\n16        MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe country, as well as entities and individuals doing\nbusiness with them, have for many years relied on Kiowa\n(along with its forebears and progeny), negotiating their\ncontracts and structuring their transactions against a\nbackdrop of tribal immunity. As in other cases involving\ncontract and property rights, concerns of stare decisis are\nthus “at their acme.” State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20\n(1997). And fourth (a point we will later revisit, see infra,\nat 17–20), Congress exercises primary authority in this\narea and “remains free to alter what we have done”—\nanother factor that gives “special force” to stare decisis.\nPatterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172–173\n(1989). To overcome all these reasons for this Court to\nstand pat, Michigan would need an ace up its sleeve.8\n   But instead, all the State musters are retreads of asser-\ntions we have rejected before. Kiowa expressly considered\nthe view, now offered by Michigan, that “when tribes take\npart in the Nation’s commerce,” immunity “extends be-\nyond what is needed to safeguard tribal self-governance.”\n523 U. S., at 758. (Indeed, as Kiowa noted, see id., at 757,\nPotawatomi had less than a decade earlier rejected Okla-\nhoma’s identical contention that “because tribal business\nactivities . . . are now so detached from traditional tribal\ninterests,” immunity “no longer makes sense in [the com-\nmercial] context,” 498 U. S., at 510.) So too, the Kiowa\n——————\n   8 Adhering to stare decisis is particularly appropriate here given that\n\nthe State, as we have shown, has many alternative remedies: It has no\nneed to sue the Tribe to right the wrong it alleges. See supra, at 12–13.\nWe need not consider whether the situation would be different if\nno alternative remedies were available. We have never, for example,\nspecifically addressed (nor, so far as we are aware, has Congress)\nwhether immunity should apply in the ordinary way if a tort victim, or\nother plaintiff who has not chosen to deal with a tribe, has no alterna-\ntive way to obtain relief for off-reservation commercial conduct. The\nargument that such cases would present a “special justification” for\nabandoning precedent is not before us. Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S.\n203, 212 (1984).\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt comprehended the trajectory of tribes’ commercial\nactivity (which is the dissent’s exclusive rationale for\nignoring stare decisis, see post, at 10–13). In the preceding\ndecade, tribal gaming revenues had increased more than\nthirty fold9 (dwarfing the still strong rate of growth since\nthat time, see supra, at 14–15); and Kiowa noted the\nflourishing of other tribal enterprises, ranging from ciga-\nrette sales to ski resorts, see 523 U. S., at 758. Moreover,\nthe Kiowa Court understood that other sovereigns did not\nenjoy similar immunity for commercial activities outside\ntheir territory; that seeming “anomal[y]” was a principal\npoint in the dissenting opinion. See id., at 765 (Stevens,\nJ., dissenting). Kiowa did more, in fact, than acknowledge\nthose arguments; it expressed a fair bit of sympathy to-\nward them. See id., at 758 (noting “reasons to doubt the\nwisdom of perpetuating the doctrine” as to off-reservation\ncommercial conduct). Yet the decision could not have been\nany clearer: “We decline to draw [any] distinction” that\nwould “confine [immunity] to reservations or to noncom-\nmercial activities.” Ibid.\n   We ruled that way for a single, simple reason: because it\nis fundamentally Congress’s job, not ours, to determine\nwhether or how to limit tribal immunity. The special\nbrand of sovereignty the tribes retain—both its nature and\nits extent—rests in the hands of Congress. See Lara, 541\nU. S., at 200; Wheeler, 435 U. S., at 323. Kiowa chose to\nrespect that congressional responsibility (as Potawatomi\nhad a decade earlier) when it rejected the precursor to\nMichigan’s argument: Whatever our view of the merits, we\nexplained, “we defer to the role Congress may wish to\nexercise in this important judgment.” 523 U. S., at 758;\nsee Potawatomi, 498 U. S., at 510 (stating that because\n——————\n  9 See Nat.

BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n“Congress has always been at liberty to dispense with” or\nlimit tribal immunity, “we are not disposed to modify” its\nscope). Congress, we said—drawing an analogy to its role\nin shaping foreign sovereign immunity10—has the greater\ncapacity “to weigh and accommodate the competing policy\nconcerns and reliance interests” involved in the issue. 523\nU. S., at 759. And Congress repeatedly had done just\nthat: It had restricted tribal immunity “in limited circum-\nstances” (including, we noted, in §2710(d)(7)(A)(ii)), while “in\nother statutes” declaring an “intention not to alter” the\ndoctrine. Id., at 758; see Potawatomi, 498 U. S., at 510\n(citing statutory provisions involving tribal immunity). So\ntoo, we thought, Congress should make the call whether\nto curtail a tribe’s immunity for off-reservation commer-\ncial conduct—and the Court should accept Congress’s\njudgment.\n   All that we said in Kiowa applies today, with yet one\n——————\n   10 Kiowa explained that Congress, in the Foreign Sovereign Immuni-\n\nties Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(2), “den[ied] immunity for the\ncommercial acts of a foreign nation,” codifying an earlier State Depart-\nment document, known as the Tate Letter, announcing that policy. 523\nU. S., at 759. Michigan takes issue with Kiowa’s account, maintaining\nthat this Court took the lead in crafting the commercial exception to\nforeign sovereign immunity, and so should feel free to do the same\nthing here. See Reply Brief 6–7. But the decision Michigan cites,\nAlfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U. S. 682\n(1976), does not show what the State would like. First, Michigan points\nto a part of the Dunhill opinion commanding only four votes, see id., at\n695–706 (opinion of White, J.); the majority’s decision was based on the\nact of state doctrine, not on anything to do with foreign sovereign\nimmunity, see id., at 690–695. And second, even the plurality opinion\nrelied heavily on the views of the Executive Branch as expressed in the\nTate Letter—going so far as to attach that document as an appendix.\nSee id., at 696–698 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 711–715 (appendix 2 to\nopinion of the Court). The opinion therefore illustrates what Kiowa\nhighlighted: this Court’s historic practice of “deferr[ing] to the decisions\nof the political branches,” rather than going it alone, when addressing\nforeign sovereign immunity. Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nige-\nria, 461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983).\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     19\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nmore thing: Congress has now reflected on Kiowa and\nmade an initial (though of course not irrevocable) decision\nto retain that form of tribal immunity. Following Kiowa,\nCongress considered several bills to substantially modify\ntribal immunity in the commercial context. Two in partic-\nular—drafted by the chair of the Senate Appropriations\nSubcommittee on the Interior—expressly referred to Kiowa\nand broadly abrogated tribal immunity for most torts\nand breaches of contract. See S. 2299, 105th Cong., 2d\nSess. (1998); S. 2302, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998). But\ninstead of adopting those reversals of Kiowa, Congress\nchose to enact a far more modest alternative requiring\ntribes either to disclose or to waive their immunity in\ncontracts needing the Secretary of the Interior’s approval.\nSee Indian Tribal Economic Development and Contract\nEncouragement Act of 2000, §2, 114 Stat. 46 (codified at\n25 U. S. C. §81(d)(2)); see also F. Cohen, Handbook of\nFederal Indian Law §7.05[1][b], p. 643 (2012). Since then,\nCongress has continued to exercise its plenary authority\nover tribal immunity, specifically preserving immunity in\nsome contexts and abrogating it in others, but never\nadopting the change Michigan wants.11 So rather than\nconfronting, as we did in Kiowa, a legislative vacuum as to\nthe precise issue presented, we act today against the\nbackdrop of a congressional choice: to retain tribal immun-\nity (at least for now) in a case like this one.12\n——————\n  11 Compare,   e.g., Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009, §§2(e),\n(3)(a), 124 Stat. 1101, 1108 (preserving immunity), with Arizona Water\nSettlements Act, §§213(a)(2), 301, 118 Stat. 3531, 3551 (abrogating\nimmunity). The dissent’s claim that “Congress has never granted tribal\nsovereign immunity in any shape or form,” post, at 13, apparently does\nnot take into account the many statutes in which Congress preserved or\notherwise ratified tribal immunity. See, e.g., 25 U. S. C. §450n; see\ngenerally Potawatomi, 498 U. S., at 510 (“Congress has consistently\nreiterated its approval of the immunity doctrine”).\n  12 The dissent principally counters that this history is not “relevan[t]”\n\nbecause Kiowa was a “common-law decision.” Post, at 14. But that is\n20        MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Reversing Kiowa in these circumstances would scale\nthe heights of presumption: Beyond upending “long-\nestablished principle[s] of tribal sovereign immunity,” that\naction would replace Congress’s considered judgment with\nour contrary opinion. Potawatomi, 498 U. S., at 510. As\nKiowa recognized, a fundamental commitment of Indian\nlaw is judicial respect for Congress’s primary role in defin-\ning the contours of tribal sovereignty. See 523 U. S., at\n758–760; see also Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U. S., at 60\n(“[A] proper respect . . . for the plenary authority of Con-\ngress in this area cautions that [the courts] tread lightly”);\nCohen, supra, §2.01[1], at 110 (“Judicial deference to the\nparamount authority of Congress in matters concerning\nIndian policy remains a central and indispensable princi-\nple of the field of Indian law”). That commitment gains\nonly added force when Congress has already reflected on\nan issue of tribal sovereignty, including immunity from\nsuit, and declined to change settled law. And that force\nmust grow greater still when Congress considered that\nissue partly at our urging. See Kiowa, 523 U. S., at 758\n(hinting, none too subtly, that “Congress may wish to\nexercise” its authority over the question presented). Hav-\ning held in Kiowa that this issue is up to Congress, we\ncannot reverse ourselves because some may think its\nconclusion wrong. Congress of course may always change\nits mind—and we would readily defer to that new decision.\nBut it is for Congress, now more than ever, to say whether\nto create an exception to tribal immunity for off-\nreservation commercial activity. As in Kiowa—except still\n——————\nto ignore what Kiowa (in line with prior rulings) specifically told\nCongress: that tribal immunity, far from any old common law doctrine,\nlies in Congress’s hands to configure. See 523 U. S., at 758; Potawatomi,\n498 U. S., at 510; Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 58–\n60 (1978).

Sovereignty implies im-\nmunity from lawsuits. Subjection means (among much\nelse) that Congress can abrogate that immunity as and to\nthe extent it wishes. If Congress had authorized this suit,\nBay Mills would have no valid grounds to object. But\nCongress has not done so: The abrogation of immunity in\nIGRA applies to gaming on, but not off, Indian lands. We\nwill not rewrite Congress’s handiwork. Nor will we create\na freestanding exception to tribal immunity for all off-\nreservation commercial conduct. This Court has declined\nthat course once before. To choose it now would entail\nboth overthrowing our precedent and usurping Congress’s\ncurrent policy judgment.

Rev. 1587, 1640–1641\n(2013) (same). And in more recent decades, this Court has\nconsistently affirmed the doctrine. See, e.g., United States\nv. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506\n(1940); Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of\nWash., 433 U. S. 165 (1977); C & L Enterprises, Inc. v.\nCitizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Okla., 532 U. S.\n411, 418 (2001). Despite this history, the principal dissent\nchides the Court for failing to offer a sufficient basis for\nthe doctrine of tribal immunity, post, at 3 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.), and reasons that we should at least limit the\ndoctrine of tribal sovereign immunity in ways that resem-\nble restrictions on foreign sovereign immunity.\n   The majority compellingly explains why stare decisis\nand deference to Congress’ careful regulatory scheme\nrequire affirming the decision below. I write separately to\nfurther detail why both history and comity counsel against\nlimiting Tribes’ sovereign immunity in the manner the\n2       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nprincipal dissent advances.\n                               I\n   Long before the formation of the United States, Tribes\n“were self-governing sovereign political communities.”\nUnited States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 322–323 (1978).\nAnd Tribes “have not given up their full sovereignty.” Id.,\nat 323. Absent contrary congressional acts, Tribes “retain\ntheir existing sovereign powers” and “possess those as-\npects of sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or statute, or\nby implication as a necessary result of their dependent\nstatus.” Ibid. See also 25 U. S. C. §1301(1) (affirming\nTribes’ continued “powers of self-government”). In this\ncase then, the question is what type of immunity federal\ncourts should accord to Tribes, commensurate with their\nretained sovereignty.\n   In answering this question, the principal dissent analo-\ngizes tribal sovereign immunity to foreign sovereign im-\nmunity. Foreign sovereigns (unlike States) are generally\nnot immune from suits arising from their commercial\nactivities. Post, at 4; see also Foreign Sovereign Immuni-\nties Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(2) (commercial-\nactivity exception to foreign sovereign immunity). This\nanalogy, however, lacks force. Indian Tribes have never\nhistorically been classified as “foreign” governments in\nfederal courts even when they asked to be.\n   The case of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1 (1831),\nis instructive. In 1828 and 1829, the Georgia Legislature\nenacted a series of laws that purported to nullify acts of\nthe Cherokee government and seize Cherokee land, among\nother things. Id., at 7–8. The Cherokee Nation sued\nGeorgia in this Court, alleging that Georgia’s laws violated\nfederal law and treaties. Id., at 7. As the constitutional\nbasis for jurisdiction, the Tribe relied on Article III, §2, cl.\n1, which extends the federal judicial power to cases “be-\ntween a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states,\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\ncitizens, or subjects.” 5 Pet., at 15 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But this Court concluded that it lacked\njurisdiction because Tribes were not “foreign state[s].” Id.,\nat 20. The Court reasoned that “[t]he condition of the\nIndians in relation to the United States is perhaps unlike\nthat of any other two people in existence.” Id., at 16.\nTribes were more akin to “domestic dependent nations,”\nthe Court explained, than to foreign nations. Id., at 17.\nWe have repeatedly relied on that characterization in\nsubsequent cases. See, e.g., Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.\nCitizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505,\n509 (1991); Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S.\n130, 141 (1982). Two centuries of jurisprudence therefore\nweigh against treating Tribes like foreign visitors in\nAmerican courts.\n                             II\n  The principal dissent contends that whenever one sov-\nereign is sued in the courts of another, the question\nwhether to confer sovereign immunity is not a matter of\nright but rather one of “comity.” Post, at 3. But in my\nview, the premise leads to a different conclusion than the\none offered by the dissent. Principles of comity strongly\ncounsel in favor of continued recognition of tribal sover-\neign immunity, including for off-reservation commercial\nconduct.\n  Comity—“that is, ‘a proper respect for [a sovereign’s]\nfunctions,’ ” Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7)—fosters “respectful,\nharmonious relations” between governments, Wood v.\nMilyard, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7). For two\nreasons, these goals are best served by recognizing sover-\neign immunity for Indian Tribes, including immunity for\noff-reservation conduct, except where Congress has ex-\npressly abrogated it. First, a legal rule that permitted\nStates to sue Tribes, absent their consent, for commercial\n4       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nconduct would be anomalous in light of the existing prohi-\nbitions against Tribes’ suing States in like circumstances.\nSuch disparate treatment of these two classes of domestic\nsovereigns would hardly signal the Federal Government’s\nrespect for tribal sovereignty. Second, Tribes face a num-\nber of barriers to raising revenue in traditional ways. If\nTribes are ever to become more self-sufficient, and fund a\nmore substantial portion of their own governmental func-\ntions, commercial enterprises will likely be a central\nmeans of achieving that goal.\n                              A\n   We have held that Tribes may not sue States in federal\ncourt, Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S.\n775 (1991), including for commercial conduct that chiefly\nimpacts Indian reservations, Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.\nFlorida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996). In Seminole Tribe, the Tribe\nsued the State of Florida in federal court under the Indian\nGaming Regulatory Act (IGRA)—the same statute peti-\ntioner relies on here. The suit alleged that Florida had\nbreached its statutory “duty to negotiate in good faith with\n[the Tribe] toward the formation of a [gaming] compact.”\nId., at 47. This Court held that state sovereign immunity\nprohibited such a suit.\n   Importantly, the Court barred the Tribe’s suit against\nFlorida even though the case involved the State’s conduct\nin the course of commercial negotiations. As this Court\nlater observed, relying in part on Seminole Tribe, the\ndoctrine of state sovereign immunity is not “any less ro-\nbust” when the case involves conduct “that is undertaken\nfor profit, that is traditionally performed by private citi-\nzens and corporations, and that otherwise resembles the\nbehavior of ‘market participants.’ ” College Savings Bank\nv. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527\nU. S. 666, 684 (1999). Nor did Seminole Tribe adopt a\nstate corollary to the “off-reservation” exception to tribal\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    5\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nsovereign immunity that the principal dissent urges today.\nTo the contrary, the negotiations in Seminole Tribe con-\ncerned gaming on Indian lands, not state lands.\n  As the principal dissent observes, “comity is about one\nsovereign respecting the dignity of another.” Post, at 4.\nThis Court would hardly foster respect for the dignity of\nTribes by allowing States to sue Tribes for commercial\nactivity on State lands, while prohibiting Tribes from\nsuing States for commercial activity on Indian lands. Both\nStates and Tribes are domestic governments who come to\nthis Court with sovereignty that they have not entirely\nceded to the Federal Government.\n  Similar asymmetry would result if States could sue\nTribes in state courts.1 In Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U. S. 353,\n355 (2001), this Court considered whether a tribal court\nhad “jurisdiction over civil claims against state officials\nwho entered tribal land to execute a search warrant\nagainst a tribe member suspected of having violated state\nlaw outside the reservation.” It held that the tribal court\ndid not. Id., at 374. In reaching that conclusion, the\nCourt observed that “[s]tate sovereignty does not end at a\nreservation’s border.” Id., at 361. And relying on similar\nprinciples, some federal courts have more explicitly held\nthat tribal courts may not entertain suits against States.\nSee, e.g., Montana v. Gilham, 133 F. 3d 1133, 1136–1137\n(CA9 1998) (holding that while neither “the Eleventh\nAmendment [n]or congressional act” barred suits against\nStates in tribal courts, “the inherent sovereign powers of\nthe States” barred such suits). To the extent Tribes are\nbarred from suing in tribal courts, it would be anomalous\nto permit suits against Tribes in state courts.\n  Two of the dissenting opinions implicitly address this\n——————\n  1 While this case involves a suit against a Tribe in federal court, the\n\nprincipal dissent also critiques tribal sovereign immunity in state\ncourts. Post, at 4–5.\n6       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nasymmetry. The principal dissent reasons that States and\nTribes should be treated differently for purposes of sover-\neign immunity because—unlike tribal sovereign immu-\nnity—state sovereign immunity has constitutional origins.\nPost, at 3, n. 1. JUSTICE GINSBURG offers another view:\nthat Tribes and States should both receive less immunity.\nShe expresses concerns about cases like Seminole Tribe,\npointing to dissents that have catalogued the many prob-\nlems associated with the Court’s sprawling state sovereign\nimmunity jurisprudence. Post, at 1–2 (citing, among\nothers, Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 814 (1999) (Souter,\nJ., dissenting)).\n   As things stand, however, Seminole Tribe and its prog-\neny remain the law. And so long as that is so, comity would\nbe ill-served by unequal treatment of States and Tribes. If\nTribes cannot sue States for commercial activities on\ntribal lands, the converse should also be true. Any other\nresult would fail to respect the dignity of Indian Tribes.\n                              B\n   The principal dissent contends that Tribes have\nemerged as particularly “substantial and successful”\ncommercial actors. Post, at 13. The dissent expresses\nconcern that, although tribal leaders can be sued for pro-\nspective relief, ante, at 13 (majority opinion), Tribes’ pur-\nportedly growing coffers remain unexposed to broad dam-\nages liability. Post, at 10–11. These observations suffer\nfrom two flaws.\n   First, not all Tribes are engaged in highly lucrative\ncommercial activity. Nearly half of federally recognized\nTribes in the United States do not operate gaming facili-\nties at all. A. Meister, Casino City’s Indian Gaming In-\ndustry Report 28 (2009–2010 ed.) (noting that “only 237,\nor 42 percent, of the 564 federally recognized Native\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

S. operate gaming”).2 And even\namong the Tribes that do, gaming revenue is far from\nuniform. As of 2009, fewer than 20% of Indian gaming\nfacilities accounted for roughly 70% of the revenues from\nsuch facilities. Ibid. One must therefore temper any\nimpression that Tribes across the country have suddenly\nand uniformly found their treasuries filled with gaming\nrevenue.\n   Second, even if all Tribes were equally successful in\ngenerating commercial revenues, that would not justify\nthe commercial-activity exception urged by the principal\ndissent. For tribal gaming operations cannot be under-\nstood as mere profit-making ventures that are wholly\nseparate from the Tribes’ core governmental functions. A\nkey goal of the Federal Government is to render Tribes\nmore self-sufficient, and better positioned to fund their\nown sovereign functions, rather than relying on federal\nfunding. 25 U. S. C. §2702(1) (explaining that Congress’\npurpose in enacting IGRA was “to provide a statutory\nbasis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a\nmeans of promoting tribal economic development, self-\nsufficiency, and strong tribal governments”); see also\nCohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law 1357–1373\n(2012) (Cohen’s Handbook) (describing various types of\nfederal financial assistance that Tribes receive). And\ntribal business operations are critical to the goals of tribal\nself-sufficiency because such enterprises in some cases\n“may be the only means by which a tribe can raise reve-\nnues,” Struve, 36 Ariz. St. L. J., at 169. This is due in\nlarge part to the insuperable (and often state-imposed)\nbarriers Tribes face in raising revenue through more\n\n——————\n  2 The  term “ ‘Indian gaming facility’ is defined as any tribal enterprise\nthat offer[s] gaming in accordance with [the Indian Gaming Regulation\nAct].’ ” A. Meister, Casino City’s Indian Gaming Industry Report 10\n(2009–2010 ed.).\n8       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\ntraditional means.\n   For example, States have the power to tax certain indi-\nviduals and companies based on Indian reservations,\nmaking it difficult for Tribes to raise revenue from those\nsources. See Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Citizen Band\nPotawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505 (allowing State\nto collect taxes on sales to non-Indians on Indian land);\nArizona Dept. of Revenue v. Blaze Constr. Co., 526 U. S. 32\n(1999) (allowing taxation of companies owned by non-\nIndians on Indian land); Thomas v. Gay, 169 U. S. 264\n(1898) (allowing taxation of property owned by non-\nIndians on Indian land). States may also tax reservation\nland that Congress has authorized individuals to hold in\nfee, regardless of whether it is held by Indians or non-\nIndians. See Cass County v. Leech Lake Band of Chip-\npewa Indians, 524 U. S. 103 (1998) (States may tax Indian\nreservation land if Congress made the land subject to sale\nunder the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887 (also\nknown as the Dawes Act)); County of Yakima v. Confeder-\nated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251\n(1992) (same).\n   As commentators have observed, if Tribes were to im-\npose their own taxes on these same sources, the resulting\ndouble taxation would discourage economic growth.\nFletcher, In Pursuit of Tribal Economic Development as a\nSubstitute for Reservation Tax Revenue, 80 N.

Many businesses may find\nit easier to avoid doing business on our reservations rather\nthan . . . bear the brunt of an added tax burden”).\n   If non-Indians controlled only a small amount of prop-\nerty on Indian reservations, and if only a negligible amount\nof land was held in fee, the double-taxation concern might\nbe less severe. But for many Tribes, that is not the case.\nHistory explains why this is so: Federal policies enacted in\nthe late 19th and early 20th centuries rendered a devas-\ntating blow to tribal ownership. In 1887, Congress enacted\nthe Dawes Act. 24 Stat. 388. That Act had two major\ncomponents relevant here. First, it converted the property\nthat belonged to Indian Tribes into fee property, and\nallotted the land to individual Indians. Id., at 388–389.\nMuch of this land passed quickly to non-Indian owners.\nRoyster, The Legacy of Allotment, 27 Ariz. St. L. J. 1, 12\n(1995). Indeed, by 1934, the amount of land that passed\nfrom Indian Tribes to non-Indians totaled 90 million acres.\nSee Cohen’s Handbook 74. Other property passed to non-\nIndians when destitute Indians found themselves unable\nto pay state taxes, resulting in sheriff ’s sales. Royster,\nsupra, at 12.\n   A second component of the Dawes Act opened “surplus”\nland on Indian reservations to settlement by non-Indians.\n24 Stat. 389–390. Selling surplus lands to non-Indians\nwas part of a more general policy of forced assimilation.\nSee Cohen’s Handbook 75. Sixty million acres of land\npassed to non-Indian hands as a result of surplus pro-\ngrams. Royster, supra, at 13.3\n   These policies have left a devastating legacy, as the\ncases that have come before this Court demonstrate. We\n\n——————\n  3 This figure does not include land taken from Indian Tribes after\nWorld War II; during that time, some Tribes and reservations were\nliquidated and given to non-Indians. A. Debo, A History of Indians of\nthe United States 301–312 (1970).\n10      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nnoted in Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 548\n(1981), for example, that due in large part to the Dawes\nAct, 28% of the Crow Tribe’s reservation in Montana was\nheld in fee by non-Indians. Similarly, Justice White ob-\nserved in Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of\nYakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 414 (1989) (plurality opin-\nion), that 20% of the Yakima Nation’s reservation was\nowned in fee. For reservations like those, it is particu-\nlarly impactful that States and local governments may tax\nproperty held by non-Indians, Thomas, 169 U. S., at 264–\n265, and land held in fee as a result of the Dawes Act. See\nCounty of Yakima, 502 U. S., at 259.\n   Moreover, Tribes are largely unable to obtain substan-\ntial revenue by taxing tribal members who reside on non-\nfee land that was not allotted under the Dawes Act. As\none scholar recently observed, even if Tribes imposed high\ntaxes on Indian residents, “there is very little income,\nproperty, or sales they could tax.” Fletcher, supra, at 774.\nThe poverty and unemployment rates on Indian reserva-\ntions are significantly greater than the national average.\nSee n. 4, infra. As a result, “there is no stable tax base on\nmost reservations.” Fletcher, supra, at 774; see Williams,\nSmall Steps on the Long Road to Self-Sufficiency for In-\ndian Nations: The Indian Tribal Governmental Tax Status\nAct of 1982, 22 Harv. J. Legis. 335, 385 (1985).\n   To be sure, poverty has decreased over the past few\ndecades on reservations that have gaming activity. One\nrecent study found that between 1990 and 2000, the pres-\nence of a tribal casino increased average per capita income\nby 7.4% and reduced the family poverty rate by 4.9 per-\ncentage points. Anderson, Tribal Casino Impacts on Amer-\nican Indians Well-Being: Evidence From Reservation-\nLevel Census Data, 31 Contemporary Economic Policy\n291, 298 (Apr. 2013).

Manufacturing Technologies,\nInc., 523 U. S. 751 (1998), this Court extended the judge-\nmade doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity to bar suits\narising out of an Indian tribe’s commercial activities con-\nducted outside its territory. That was error. Such an\nexpansion of tribal immunity is unsupported by any ra-\ntionale for that doctrine, inconsistent with the limits on\ntribal sovereignty, and an affront to state sovereignty.\n   That decision, wrong to begin with, has only worsened\nwith the passage of time. In the 16 years since Kiowa,\ntribal commerce has proliferated and the inequities en-\ngendered by unwarranted tribal immunity have multi-\nplied. Nevertheless, the Court turns down a chance to\nrectify its error. Still lacking a substantive justification\nfor Kiowa’s rule, the majority relies on notions of deference\nto Congress and stare decisis. Because those considera-\ntions do not support (and cannot sustain) Kiowa’s unjusti-\nfiable rule and its mounting consequences, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                           I\n                           A\n  There is no substantive basis for Kiowa’s extension of\n2       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntribal immunity to off-reservation commercial acts. As\nthis Court explained in Kiowa, the common-law doctrine of\ntribal sovereign immunity arose “almost by accident.” Id.,\nat 756. The case this Court typically cited as the doc-\ntrine’s source “simply does not stand for that proposition,”\nibid. (citing Turner v. United States, 248 U. S. 354\n(1919)), and later cases merely “reiterated the doctrine”\n“with little analysis,” 523 U. S., at 757. In fact, far from\ndefending the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity, the\nKiowa majority “doubt[ed] the wisdom of perpetuating the\ndoctrine.” Id., at 758. The majority here suggests just one\npost hoc justification: that tribes automatically receive\nimmunity as an incident to their historic sovereignty. But\nthat explanation fails to account for the fact that immunity\ndoes not apply of its own force in the courts of another\nsovereign. And none of the other colorable rationales for\nthe doctrine—i.e., considerations of comity, and protection\nof tribal self-sufficiency and self-government—supports\nextending immunity to suits arising out of a tribe’s com-\nmercial activities conducted beyond its territory.\n                               1\n  Despite the Indian tribes’ subjection to the authority\nand protection of the United States Government, this\nCourt has deemed them “domestic dependent nations”\nthat retain limited attributes of their historic sovereignty.\nCherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831); see also\nUnited States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 323 (1978) (“The\nsovereignty that the Indian tribes retain is of a unique and\nlimited character”). The majority suggests that tribal\nimmunity is one such attribute of sovereignty that tribes\nhave retained. See ante, at 5; Brief for Respondent Bay\nMills Indian Community 48; On that view, immunity\nfrom suit applies automatically, on the theory that it is\nsimply “inherent in the nature of sovereignty,” The Feder-\nalist No. 81, p. 548 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

We have long\nrecognized that in the sovereign’s own courts, “the sover-\neign’s power to determine the jurisdiction of its own courts\nand to define the substantive legal rights of its citizens\nadequately explains the lesser authority to define its own\nimmunity.” Kiowa, supra, at 760 (Stevens, J., dissenting)\n(citing Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, 353\n(1907)). But this notion cannot support a tribe’s claim of\nimmunity in the courts of another sovereign—either a\nState (as in Kiowa) or the United States (as here). Sover-\neign immunity is not a freestanding “right” that applies of\nits own force when a sovereign faces suit in the courts of\nanother. Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677,\n688 (2004). Rather, “[t]he sovereign’s claim to immunity\nin the courts of a second sovereign . . . normally depends\non the second sovereign’s law.” Kiowa, supra, at 760–761\n(Stevens, J., dissenting); see, e.g., Altmann, supra, at 711\n(BREYER, J., concurring) (application of foreign sovereign\nimmunity “is a matter, not of legal right, but of ‘grace and\ncomity’ ”).1 In short, to the extent an Indian tribe may\nclaim immunity in federal or state court, it is because\nfederal or state law provides it, not merely because the\ntribe is sovereign. Outside of tribal courts, the majority’s\n——————\n   1 State sovereign immunity is an exception: This Court has said that\n\nthe States’ immunity from suit in federal court is secured by the Con-\nstitution. See Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 73 (2000)\n(“[F]or over a century now, we have made clear that the Constitution\ndoes not provide for federal jurisdiction over suits against nonconsent-\ning States”); Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 733 (1999) (“Although the\nsovereign immunity of the States derives at least in part from the\ncommon-law tradition, . . . the immunity exists today by constitutional\ndesign”). Unlike the States, Indian tribes “are not part of this constitu-\ntional order,” and their immunity is not guaranteed by it. United\nStates v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 219 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment).\n4       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ninherent-immunity argument is hardly persuasive.\n                                2\n    Immunity for independent foreign nations in federal\ncourts is grounded in international “comity,” Verlinden B. V.\nv. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983), i.e.,\nrespecting the dignity of other sovereigns so as not to\n“ ‘ “ imperil the amicable relations between governments\nand vex the peace of nations,” ’ ” Banco Nacional de Cuba\nv. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 418 (1964). But whatever its\nrelevance to tribal immunity, comity is an ill-fitting justi-\nfication for extending immunity to tribes’ off-reservation\ncommercial activities. Even with respect to fully sovereign\nforeign nations, comity has long been discarded as a suffi-\ncient reason to grant immunity for commercial acts. In\n1976, Congress provided that foreign states are not im-\nmune from suits based on their “commercial activity” in\nthe United States or abroad. Foreign Sovereign Immuni-\nties Act, 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(2); see also Alfred Dunhill of\nLondon, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U. S. 682, 703–704\n(1976) (plurality opinion of White, J., joined by Burger,\nC. J., and Powell and Rehnquist, JJ.) (“Subjecting for-\neign governments to the rule of law in their commercial\ndealings” is “unlikely to touch very sharply on ‘na-\ntional nerves,’” because “[i]n their commercial capacities, for-\neign governments do not exercise powers peculiar to\nsovereigns”).\n    There is a further reason that comity cannot support\ntribal immunity for off-reservation commercial activities.\nAt bottom, comity is about one sovereign respecting the\ndignity of another. See Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 416\n(1979).      But permitting immunity for a tribe’s off-\nreservation acts represents a substantial affront to a\ndifferent set of sovereigns—the States, whose sovereignty\nis guaranteed by the Constitution, see New York v. United\nStates, 505 U. S. 144, 188 (1992) (“The Constitution . . .\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n‘leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable\nsovereignty ’ ” (quoting The Federalist No. 39, at 256)).\nWhen an Indian tribe engages in commercial activity\noutside its own territory, it necessarily acts within the\nterritory of a sovereign State. This is why, “[a]bsent ex-\npress federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond\nreservation boundaries have generally been held subject to\nnondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all\ncitizens of the State.” Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones,\n411 U. S. 145, 148–149 (1973). A rule barring all suits\nagainst a tribe arising out of a tribe’s conduct within state\nterritory—whether private actions or (as here) actions\nbrought by the State itself—stands in stark contrast to a\nState’s broad regulatory authority over Indians within its\nown territory. Indeed, by foreclosing key mechanisms\nupon which States depend to enforce their laws against\ntribes engaged in off-reservation commercial activity, such\na rule effects a breathtaking pre-emption of state power.\nKiowa, 523 U. S., at 764 (Stevens, J., dissenting). What is\nworse, because that rule of immunity also applies in state\ncourts, it strips the States of their prerogative “to decide\nfor themselves whether to accord such immunity to Indian\ntribes as a matter of comity.” Id., at 760 (same). The\nStates may decide whether to grant immunity in their\ncourts to other sovereign States, see Hall, supra, at 417–\n418 (a State’s immunity from suit in the courts of a second\nState depends on whether the second has chosen to extend\nimmunity to the first “as a matter of comity”), but when it\ncomes to Indian tribes, this Court has taken that right\naway. Kiowa, supra, at 765 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n   Nor does granting tribes immunity with respect to their\ncommercial conduct in state territory serve the practical\naim of comity: allaying friction between sovereigns. See\nBanco Nacional de Cuba, supra, at 417–418. We need look\nno further than this case (and many others cited by peti-\ntioner and amici States) to see that such broad immunity\n6       MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nhas only aggravated relationships between States and\ntribes throughout the country. See infra, at 11–13; see\ngenerally Brief for State of Alabama et al. 11–16; Brief for\nState of Oklahoma 8–10, 12–15.\n                                3\n   This Court has previously suggested that recognizing\ntribal immunity furthers a perceived congressional goal of\npromoting tribal self-sufficiency and self-governance. See\nKiowa, supra, at 757; Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort\nBerthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 476 U. S.\n877, 890 (1986). Whatever the force of this assertion as a\ngeneral matter, it is easy to reject as a basis for extending\ntribal immunity to off-reservation commercial activities.\nIn Kiowa itself, this Court dismissed the self-sufficiency\nrationale as “inapposite to modern, wide-ranging tribal\nenterprises extending well beyond traditional tribal cus-\ntoms and activities.” 523 U. S., at 757–758. The Court\nexpressed concern that “[i]n this economic context, im-\nmunity can harm those who are unaware that they are\ndealing with a tribe, who do not know of tribal immunity,\nor who have no choice in the matter, as in the case of tort\nvictims.” Id., at 758.\n   Nor is immunity for off-reservation commercial acts\nnecessary to protect tribal self-governance. As the Kiowa\nmajority conceded, “[i]n our interdependent and mobile\nsociety, . . . tribal immunity extends beyond what is needed\nto safeguard tribal self-governance.” Ibid. Such broad\nimmunity far exceeds the modest scope of tribal sover-\neignty, which is limited only to “what is necessary to pro-\ntect tribal self-government or to control internal relations.”\nMontana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 564 (1981); see\nalso Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U. S. 353, 392 (2001) (O’Connor,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\n(“[T]ribes retain sovereign interests in activities that occur\non land owned and controlled by the tribe . . .”). And no\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     7\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nparty has suggested that immunity from the isolated suits\nthat may arise out of extraterritorial commercial dealings\nis somehow fundamental to protecting tribal government\nor regulating a tribe’s internal affairs.\n                             B\n  Despite acknowledging that there is scant substantive\njustification for extending tribal immunity to off-\nreservation commercial acts, this Court did just that in\nKiowa. See 523 U. S., at 758. The Kiowa majority admit-\nted that the Court—rather than Congress—“has taken the\nlead in drawing the bounds of tribal immunity.” Id., at\n759. Nevertheless, the Court adopted a rule of expansive\nimmunity purportedly to “defer to the role Congress may\nwish to exercise in this important judgment.” Id., at 758.\n  This asserted “deference” to Congress was a fiction and\nremains an enigma, however, because the Kiowa Court did\nnot actually leave to Congress the decision whether to\nextend tribal immunity. Tribal immunity is a common-\nlaw doctrine adopted and shaped by this Court. Okla-\nhoma Tax Comm’n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of\nOkla., 498 U. S. 505, 510 (1991); Kiowa, 523 U. S., at 759.\nBefore Kiowa, we had never held that tribal sovereign\nimmunity applied to off-reservation commercial activities.2\nThus, faced with an unresolved question about a common-\nlaw doctrine of its own design, the Kiowa Court had to\n——————\n  2 The  Court in Kiowa noted that in one case, we upheld a claim of\nimmunity where “a state court had asserted jurisdiction over tribal\nfishing ‘both on and off its reservation.’ ” 523 U. S., at 754 (quoting\nPuyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Wash., 433 U. S. 165,\n167 (1977)). It went on to admit, however, that Puyallup “did not\ndiscuss the relevance of where the fishing had taken place.” 523 U. S.,\nat 754. And, as Justice Stevens explained in dissent, that case was\nabout whether the state courts had jurisdiction to regulate fishing\nactivities on the reservation; “we had no occasion to consider the\nvalidity of an injunction relating solely to off-reservation fishing.” Id.,\nat 763.\n8         MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmake a choice: tailor the immunity to the realities of their\ncommercial enterprises, or “grant . . . virtually unlimited\ntribal immunity.” Id., at 764 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\nThe Court took the latter course. In doing so, it did not\n“defe[r] to Congress or exercis[e] ‘caution,’—rather, it . . .\ncreat[ed] law.” Id., at 765 (citation omitted). To be sure,\nCongress had the power to “alter” that decision if it wanted.\nId., at 759 (majority opinion). But Congress has the au-\nthority to do that with respect to any nonconstitutional\ndecision involving federal law, and the mere existence of\nthis authority could not be the basis for choosing one\noutcome over another in Kiowa.3\n   Accident or no, it was this Court, not Congress, that\nadopted the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity in the\nfirst instance. And it was this Court that left open a\nquestion about its scope. Why should Congress—and only\nCongress, according to the Kiowa Court—have to take on a\nproblem this Court created? In other areas of federal\ncommon law, until Congress intervenes, it is up to us to\ncorrect our errors. See, e.g., Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker,\n554 U. S. 471, 507 (2008) (“[I]f, in the absence of legisla-\ntion, judicially derived standards leave the door open to\noutlier punitive-damages awards [in maritime law], it is\nhard to see how the judiciary can wash its hands of a\n——————\n   3 Nor did the Kiowa Court “defer” to any pre-existing congressional\n\npolicy choices. As I have already made clear, the rule the Court chose\nin Kiowa was divorced from, and in some ways contrary to any federal\ninterest. See Part I–A, supra; see also Kiowa, 523 U. S., at 765 (Ste-\nvens, J., dissenting). And the rule is a “strikingly anomalous” depar-\nture from the immunities of other sovereigns in federal and state court.\nIbid. (observing that Kiowa conferred on Indian tribes “broader immun-\nity than the States, the Federal Government, and foreign nations”); see\nalso Florey, Indian Country’s Borders: Territoriality, Immunity, and\nthe Construction of Tribal Sovereignty, 51 Boston College L. Rev. 595,\n627 (2010) (After Kiowa, “the actual contours of [tribal immunity]\nremain astonishingly broad”).\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

We have the\nsame duty here.\n                             II\n  Today, the Court reaffirms Kiowa. Unsurprisingly, it\noffers no new substantive defense for Kiowa’s indefensible\nview of tribal immunity. Instead, the majority relies on a\ncombination of the Kiowa Court’s purported deference to\nCongress and considerations of stare decisis. I have al-\nready explained why it was error to ground the Kiowa rule\nin deference to Congress. I turn now to stare decisis.\nContrary to the majority’s claim, that policy does not\nrequire us to preserve this Court’s mistake in Kiowa. The\nCourt’s failure to justify Kiowa’s rule and the decision’s\nuntoward consequences outweigh the majority’s argu-\nments for perpetuating the error.\n                              A\n  Stare decisis may sometimes be “the preferred course,”\nbut as this Court acknowledges, it is “not an inexorable\ncommand.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827, 828\n(1991). “[W]hen governing decisions are unworkable or\nare badly reasoned,” id., at 827, or “experience has pointed\nup the precedent’s shortcomings,” Pearson v. Callahan,\n555 U. S. 223, 233 (2009), “ ‘this Court has never felt con-\nstrained to follow precedent,’ ” Payne, supra, at 827. See\nalso Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485\nU. S. 271, 282–283 (1988) (overruling precedent as “defi-\ncient in utility and sense,” “unsound in theory, unworka-\nble and arbitrary in practice, and unnecessary to achieve\nany legitimate goals”). The discussion above explains why\n10      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nKiowa was unpersuasive on its own terms. Now, the\nadverse consequences of that decision make it even more\nuntenable.\n   In the 16 years since Kiowa, the commercial activities of\ntribes have increased dramatically. This is especially evi-\ndent within the tribal gambling industry. Combined tribal\ngaming revenues in 28 States have more than tripled—from\n$8.5 billion in 1998 to $27.9 billion in 2012. National\nIndian Gaming Commission, 2012 Indian Gaming Reve-\nnues Increase 2.7 Percent (July 23, 2013), online at http://\nwww.nigc.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Fhd5shyZ1fM%3D\n(all Internet materials as visited May 2, 2014, and availa-\nble in Clerk of Court’s case file). But tribal businesses\nextend well beyond gambling and far past reservation\nborders. In addition to ventures that take advantage of\non-reservation resources (like tourism, recreation, mining,\nforestry, and agriculture), tribes engage in “domestic and\ninternational business ventures” including manufacturing,\nretail, banking, construction, energy, telecommunications,\nand more. Graham, An Interdisciplinary Approach to\nAmerican Indian Economic Development, 80 N. D. L. Rev.\n597, 600–604 (2004). Tribal enterprises run the gamut:\nthey sell cigarettes and prescription drugs online; engage\nin foreign financing; and operate greeting cards compa-\nnies, national banks, cement plants, ski resorts, and ho-\ntels. Ibid.; see also, e.g., The Harvard Project on American\nIndian Economic Development, The State of the Native\nNations 124 (2008) (Ho-Chunk, Inc., a tribal corporation\nof the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, operates “hotels\nin Nebraska and Iowa,” “numerous retail grocery\nand convenience stores,” a “tobacco and gasoline distribu-\ntion company,” and “a temporary labor service provider”);\nFour Fires, San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, http://\nwww.sanmanuel-nsn.gov/fourfires.php.html) (four Tribes from\nCalifornia and Wisconsin jointly own and operate a $43\nmillion hotel in Washington, D. C.). These manifold com-\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

Tribal immunity significantly\nlimits, and often extinguishes, the States’ ability to protect\ntheir citizens and enforce the law against tribal busi-\nnesses. This case is but one example: No one can seriously\ndispute that Bay Mills’ operation of a casino outside its\nreservation (and thus within Michigan territory) would\nviolate both state law and the Tribe’s compact with Michi-\ngan. Yet, immunity poses a substantial impediment to\nMichigan’s efforts to halt the casino’s operation perma-\nnently. The problem repeats itself every time a tribe fails\nto pay state taxes, harms a tort victim, breaches a con-\ntract, or otherwise violates state laws, and tribal immu-\nnity bars the only feasible legal remedy. Given the wide\nreach of tribal immunity, such scenarios are common-\nplace.4 See, e.g., Oneida Indian Nation of New York v.\nMadison Cty., 605 F. 3d 149, 163 (CA2 2010) (Cabranes,\nJ., joined by Hall, J., concurring) (“The holding in this case\ncomes down to this: an Indian tribe can purchase land\n(including land that was never part of a reservation); refuse\n——————\n   4 Lower courts have held that tribal immunity shields not only Indian\n\ntribes themselves, but also entities deemed “arms of the tribe.” See,\ne.g., Breakthrough Management Group, Inc. v. Chukchansi Gold Casino\n& Resort, 629 F. 3d 1173, 1191–1195 (CA10 2010) (casino and economic\ndevelopment authority were arms of the Tribe); Memphis Biofuels, LLC\nv. Chickasaw Nation Industries, Inc., 585 F. 3d 917, 921 (CA6 2009)\n(tribal conglomerate was an arm of the Tribe). In addition, tribal\nimmunity has been interpreted to cover tribal employees and officials\nacting within the scope of their employment. See, e.g., Cook v. AVI\nCasino Enterprises, Inc., 548 F. 3d 718, 726–727 (CA9 2008); Native\nAmerican Distributing v. Seneca-Cayuga Tobacco Co., 546 F. 3d 1288,\n1296 (CA10 2008); Chayoon v.

Miccosukee Tribe of Indians\nof Fla., 685 F. 3d 1224 (CA11 2012) (Tribe immune from a\nsuit arising out of a fatal off-reservation car crash that\nalleged negligence and violation of state dram shop laws);\nNative American Distributing v. Seneca-Cayuga Tobacco\nCo., 546 F. 3d 1288 (CA10 2008) (tribal officials and a\ntobacco-products manufacturer were immune from a suit\nbrought by a national distributor alleging breach of con-\ntract and interstate market manipulation); Tonasket v.\nSargent, 830 F.

Supp. 2d 1131 (ND\nOkla. 2001) (tribal immunity barred a suit alleging copy-\nright infringement, unfair competition, breach of contract,\nand other claims against a tribal business development\nagency).\n   In the wake of Kiowa, tribal immunity has also been\nexploited in new areas that are often heavily regulated by\nStates. For instance, payday lenders (companies that lend\nconsumers short-term advances on paychecks at interest\nrates that can reach upwards of 1,000 percent per annum)\noften arrange to share fees or profits with tribes so they\ncan use tribal immunity as a shield for conduct of ques-\ntionable legality.

Indian tribes have also\ncreated conflict in certain States by asserting tribal im-\nmunity as a defense against violations of state campaign\nfinance laws. See generally Moylan, Sovereign Rules of\nthe Game: Requiring Campaign Finance Disclosure in the\nFace of Tribal Sovereign Immunity, 20 B. U. Pub. Interest\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

J. 1 (2010).\n  In sum, any number of Indian tribes across the country\nhave emerged as substantial and successful competitors in\ninterstate and international commerce, both within and\nbeyond Indian lands. As long as tribal immunity remains\nout of sync with this reality, it will continue to invite\nproblems, including de facto deregulation of highly regu-\nlated activities; unfairness to tort victims; and increas-\ningly fractious relations with States and individuals alike.\nThe growing harms wrought by Kiowa’s unjustifiable rule\nfully justify overruling it.\n                                B\n   In support of its adherence to stare decisis, the majority\nasserts that “Congress has now reflected on Kiowa” and\nhas decided to “retain” the decision. Ante, at 18; see also\nante, at 19 (“[W]e act today against the backdrop of an\napparent congressional choice: to keep tribal immunity . . .\nin a case like this one”). On its face, however, this is a\ncurious assertion. To this day, Congress has never granted\ntribal sovereign immunity in any shape or form—much\nless immunity that extends as far as Kiowa went. What\nthe majority really means, I gather, is that the Court must\nstay its hand because Congress has implicitly approved of\nKiowa’s rule by not overturning it.\n   This argument from legislative inaction is unavailing.\nAs a practical matter, it is “ ‘ impossible to assert with any\ndegree of assurance that congressional failure to act rep-\nresents’ affirmative congressional approval of ” one of this\nCourt’s decisions. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491\nU. S. 164, 175, n. 1 (1989) (quoting Johnson v. Transporta-\ntion Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616, 672 (1987)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting)); see also Girouard v. United\nStates, 328 U. S. 61, 69 (1946) (“It is at best treacherous to\nfind in congressional silence alone the adoption of a con-\ntrolling rule of law”); Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106,\n14      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n121 (1940) (“[W]e walk on quicksand when we try to find\nin the absence of corrective legislation a controlling legal\nprinciple”). There are many reasons Congress might not\nact on a decision like Kiowa, and most of them have noth-\ning at all to do with Congress’ desire to preserve the deci-\nsion. See Johnson, 480 U. S., at 672 (SCALIA, J., dissent-\ning) (listing various kinds of legislative inertia, including\nan “inability to agree upon how to alter the status quo”\nand “indifference to the status quo”).\n   Even assuming the general validity of arguments from\nlegislative inaction, they are a poor fit in this common-law\ncontext. Such arguments are typically based on the prem-\nise that the failure of later Congresses to reject a judicial\ndecision interpreting a statute says something about what\nCongress understands the statute to mean. See, e.g., id.,\nat 629, n. 7 (majority opinion). But it is not clear why\nCongress’ unenacted “opinion” has any relevance to de-\ntermining the correctness of a decision about a doctrine\ncreated and shaped by this Court. Giving dispositive\nweight to congressional silence regarding a common-law\ndecision of this Court effectively codifies that decision\nbased only on Congress’ failure to address it. This ap-\nproach is at odds with our Constitution’s requirements for\nenacting law. Cf. Patterson, supra, at 175, n. 1 (“Congress\nmay legislate . . . only through the passage of a bill which\nis approved by both Houses and signed by the President.\nCongressional inaction cannot amend a duly enacted\nstatute” (citation omitted)). It is also the direct opposite of\nthis Court’s usual approach in common-law cases, where\nwe have made clear that, “in the absence of an applicable\nAct of Congress, federal courts must fashion the governing\nrules.” National Metropolitan Bank, 323 U. S., at 456; see\nalso supra, at 11–12; Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc.,\n398 U. S. 375, 378 (1970) (precedent barring recovery for\nwrongful death, “somewhat dubious even when rendered,\nis such an unjustifiable anomaly in the present maritime\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

See ante, at 16,\nn. 8. In light of that reservation, the majority’s declaration that it is\n“Congress’s job . . . to determine whether or how to limit tribal immu-\nnity” rings hollow. Id., at 17. Such a judge-made exception would no\nmore defer to Congress to “make the call whether to curtail a tribe’s\nimmunity” than would recognizing that Kiowa was wrongly decided in\nthe first instance. Id., at 18. In any event, I welcome the majority’s\ninterest in fulfilling its independent responsibility to correct Kiowa’s\nmistaken extension of immunity “without any exceptions for commer-\ncial or off-reservation conduct.” Id., at 15. I regret only that the Court\ndoes not see fit to take that step today.\n    6 Of course, stare decisis still applies in the common-law context; I\n\nreject only the notion that arguments from legislative inaction have any\nplace in the analysis.\n    I also reject the majority’s intimation that stare decisis applies as\nstrongly to common-law decisions as to those involving statutory\ninterpretation. The majority asserts that stare decisis should have\n“ ‘special force’ ” in this case because “ ‘Congress remains free to alter\nwhat we have done.’ ” Ante, at 16 (quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit\nUnion, 491 U. S. 164, 172–173 (1989)). Although the Court has invoked\nthis reasoning in the statutory context, I am not aware of a case in\nwhich we have relied upon it to preserve a common-law decision of this\nCourt. Indeed, we have minimized that reasoning when interpreting\nthe Sherman Act precisely because “the Court has treated the Sherman\nAct as a common-law statute.” Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc.\nv.

S. 3, 20–21 (1997) (“[T]he general pre-\nsumption that legislative changes should be left to Congress has less\nforce with respect to the Sherman Act in light of the accepted view that\nCongress ‘expected the courts to give shape to the statute’s broad\nmandate by drawing on common-law tradition’ ”). Surely no higher\nstandard of stare decisis can apply when dealing with common law\nproper, which Congress certainly expects the Court to shape in the\nabsence of legislative action. See, e.g., National Metropolitan Bank v.\nUnited States, 323 U. S. 454, 456 (1945).\n16      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nindeterminate, we “ ‘require very persuasive circumstances\nenveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from\nreexamining its own doctrines.’ ” Girouard, supra, at 69.\nHere, the majority provides nothing that solidifies the\ninference of approval it draws from congressional silence\nin the wake of Kiowa.\n   First, the majority cites two Senate bills that proposed\nto abrogate tribal immunity for contract and tort claims\nagainst tribes. See S. 2299, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998)\n(contract claims); S. 2302, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998)\n(tort claims). Neither bill expresses Congress’ views on\nKiowa’s rule, for both died in committee without a vote.\n   Second, the majority notes various post-Kiowa enact-\nments that either abrogate tribal immunity in various\nlimited contexts or leave it be. See ante, at 18, 19, n. 10.\nNone of these enactments provides a reason to believe that\nCongress both considered and approved Kiowa’s holding.\nNone of them targets with any precision the immunity of\nIndian tribes for off-reservation commercial activities.\nSee, e.g., Indian Tribal Economic Development and Con-\ntract Encouragement Act of 2000 (codified at 25 U. S. C.\n§81(d)(2)) (for contracts that encumber Indian lands for\nmore than seven years, tribes must either provide for\nbreach-of-contract remedies or disclose tribal immunity if\napplicable). And given the exceedingly narrow contexts in\nwhich these provisions apply, see, e.g., Arizona Water\nSettlements Act, §213(a)(2), 118 Stat. 3531 (abrogating\none tribe’s immunity for the limited purpose of enforcing\nwater settlements), the far stronger inference is that\nCongress simply did not address Kiowa or its extension of\nimmunity in these Acts; rather, Congress considered only\nwhether an abrogation of judge-made tribal immunity was\nnecessary to the narrow regulatory scheme on the table.\nSee, e.g., Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009,\n§§2(e), 3(a), 124 Stat. 1101, 1108.\n   The majority posits that its inference of congressional\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\napproval of Kiowa is stronger because Congress failed to\nact after the Kiowa Court “urg[ed]” Congress to consider\nthe question presented. Ante, at 17, 19–20 (quoting\nKiowa, 523 U. S., at 758) (“[W]e defer to the role Congress\nmay wish to exercise in this important judgment”). But\nthis circumstance too raises any number of inferences.\nCongress is under no obligation to review and respond to\nevery statement this Court makes; perhaps legislative\ninertia simply won out. The majority seems to suggest\nthat Congress understood Kiowa to assign the burgeoning\nproblems of expansive common-law immunity to the Legis-\nlature, and then chose to let those problems fester. But\nCongress has not explained its inaction, and we should not\npretend that it has done so by remaining silent after we\nsupposedly prodded it to say something. Even if we credit\nthe relevance of post-Kiowa congressional silence in this\ncommon-law context—and I do not—there is certainly not\nenough evidence of congressional acquiescence here “that\nwe can properly place on the shoulders of Congress the\nburden of the Court’s own error.” Girouard, 328 U. S., at\n69–70.\n                              C\n   The majority’s remaining arguments for retaining Kiowa\nare also unconvincing.\n   First, the majority characterizes Kiowa as one case in a\n“long line of precedents” in which the Court has recognized\ntribal immunity “without any exceptions for commercial or\noff-reservation conduct.” Ante, at 15. True, the Court has\nrelied on tribal immunity as a general matter in several\ncases. But not until Kiowa were we required to decide\nwhether immunity should extend to commercial activities\nbeyond Indian reservations. See supra, at 7. And after\nKiowa, we have mentioned it only once, and then only in\ndicta. C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi\nTribe of Okla., 532 U. S. 411, 418 (2001) (holding that the\n18      MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nTribe had waived its immunity in a construction contract).\nThus, overturning Kiowa would overturn Kiowa only.\n   Second, the majority suggests that tribes and their\nbusiness partners have now relied on Kiowa in structuring\ntheir contracts and transactions. Ante, at 15. But even\nwhen Kiowa extended the scope of tribal immunity, it was\nreadily apparent that the Court had strong misgivings\nabout it. Not one Member of the Kiowa Court identified a\nsubstantive justification for its extension of immunity:\nThree would not have expanded the immunity in the first\nplace, Kiowa, 523 U. S., at 760 (Stevens, J., dissenting),\nand the other six essentially expressed hope that Congress\nwould overrule the Court’s decision, see id., at 758–759.\nAgainst that backdrop, it would hardly be reasonable for a\ntribe to rely on Kiowa as a permanent grant of immunity\nfor off-reservation commercial activities. In any event, the\nutter absence of a reasoned justification for Kiowa’s rule\nand its growing adverse effects easily outweigh this gen-\neralized assertion of reliance. See, e.g., Leegin Creative\nLeather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, 906\n(2007) (in the antitrust context, overturning the per se rule\nagainst vertical price restraints in part because the “reli-\nance interests” in the case could not “justify an inefficient\nrule”).\n                        *     *     *\n  In Kiowa, this Court adopted a rule without a reason: a\nsweeping immunity from suit untethered from commercial\nrealities and the usual justifications for immunity, prem-\nised on the misguided notion that only Congress can place\nsensible limits on a doctrine we created. The decision was\nmistaken then, and the Court’s decision to reaffirm it in\nthe face of the unfairness and conflict it has engendered is\ndoubly so.

Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Tech-\nnologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751 (1998), held for the first time\nthat tribal sovereign immunity extends to suits arising out\nof an Indian tribe’s off-reservation commercial activity.\nFor the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion I joined\nin Kiowa, id., at 760–766 (opinion of Stevens, J.), and co-\ngently recapitulated today by JUSTICE THOMAS, this Court’s\ndeclaration of an immunity thus absolute was and re-\nmains exorbitant. But I also believe that the Court has\ncarried beyond the pale the immunity possessed by States\nof the United States. Compare ante, at 3, n. 3 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting), with Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517\nU. S. 44, 100 (1996) (Souter, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Court\ntoday holds for the first time since the founding of the\nRepublic that Congress has no authority to subject a State\nto the jurisdiction of a federal court at the behest of an\nindividual asserting a federal right. . . .
