ILLINOIS\n       ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE\n\n              SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n              No. 13\u20135967. Decided May 27, 2014\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   The trial of Esteban Martinez was set to begin on May\n17, 2010. His counsel was ready; the State was not. When\nthe court swore in the jury and invited the State to pre\u00ad\nsent its first witness, the State declined to present any\nevidence. So Martinez moved for a directed not-guilty\nverdict, and the court granted it. The State appealed,\narguing that the trial court should have granted its motion\nfor a continuance. The question is whether the Double\nJeopardy Clause bars the State\u2019s attempt to appeal in the\nhope of subjecting Martinez to a new trial.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court manifestly erred in allowing\nthe State\u2019s appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never\nattached because Martinez \u201cwas never at risk of convic\u00ad\ntion.\u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b639, 990 N. E. 2d 215, 224. Our\ncases have repeatedly stated the bright-line rule that\n\u201cjeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and\nsworn.\u201d Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 35 (1978); see infra, at\n6. There is simply no doubt that Martinez was subjected\nto jeopardy. And because the trial court found the State\u2019s\nevidence insufficient to sustain a conviction, there is\nequally no doubt that Martinez may not be retried.\n   We therefore grant Martinez\u2019s petition for certiorari and\nreverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.\n                             I\n                             A\n  The State of Illinois indicted Martinez in August 2006\non charges of aggravated battery and mob action against\n2                     MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nAvery Binion and Demarco Scott. But Martinez\u2019s trial\ndate did not arrive for nearly four years.1\n   The story picks up for present purposes on July 20,\n2009, when the State moved to continue an August 3 trial\ndate because it had not located the complaining witnesses,\nBinion and Scott. The State subpoenaed both men four\ndays later, and the court rescheduled Martinez\u2019s trial to\nSeptember 28. But the State sought another continuance,\nshortly before that date, because it still had not found\nBinion and Scott. The court rescheduled the trial to No\u00ad\nvember 9, and the State reissued subpoenas. But Novem\u00ad\nber 9 came and went (the court continued the case when\nMartinez showed up late) and the trial was eventually\ndelayed to the following March 29. In early February, the\nState yet again subpoenaed Binion and Scott. When\nMarch 29 arrived, the trial court granted the State an\u00ad\nother continuance. It reset the trial date for May 17 and\nordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May 10.\nAnd the State once more issued subpoenas.2\n   On the morning of May 17, however, Binion and Scott\nwere again nowhere to be found. At 8:30, when the trial\nwas set to begin, the State asked for a brief continuance.\nThe court offered to delay swearing the jurors until a\ncomplete jury had been empaneled and told the State that\nit could at that point either have the jury sworn or move to\ndismiss its case. When Binion and Scott still had not\nshown up after the jury was chosen, the court offered to\ncall the other cases on its docket so as to delay swearing\nthe jury a bit longer. But when all these delays had run\nout, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight. The\nState filed a written motion for a continuance, arguing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Much of that delay was due to Martinez and his counsel. See 2013\n\nIL 113475, \u00b64, n. 1, 990 N. E. 2d 215, 216, n. 1 (summarizing the\nlengthy procedural history).\n  2 These facts are set forth in the opinion of the Illinois Appellate\n\nCourt. 2011 IL App (2d) 100498, \u00b6\u00b65\u20137, 969 N. E. 2d 840, 842\u2013843.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthat it was \u201cunable to proceed\u201d without Binion and Scott.\nTr. 7. The court denied that motion:\n       \u201cThe case before the Court began on July 7, 2006.\n    In two months we will then be embarking upon half a\n    decade of pending a Class 3 felony. Avery Binion, Jr.,\n    and Demarco [Scott] are well known in Elgin, both are\n    convicted felons. One would believe that the Elgin Po\u00ad\n    lice Department would know their whereabouts. They\n    were ordered to be in court today. The Court will is\u00ad\n    sue body writs for both of these gentlemen.\n       \u201cIn addition, the State\u2019s list of witnesses indi\u00ad\n    cates twelve witnesses. Excluding Mr. Scott and Mr.\n    Binion, that\u2019s ten witnesses. The Court would antici\u00ad\n    pate it would take every bit of today and most of to\u00ad\n    morrow to get through ten witnesses. By then the\n    People may have had a chance to execute the arrest\n    warrant body writs for these two gentlemen.\n       \u201cThe Court will deny the motion for continuance. I\n    will swear the jury in in 15, 20 minutes. Perhaps you\n    might want to send the police out to find these two\n    gentlemen.\u201d Id., at 8\u20139.\n   After a brief recess, the court offered to delay the start\nof the trial for several more hours if the continuance would\n\u201cbe of any help\u201d to the State. Id., at 9. But when the State\nmade clear that Binion and Scott\u2019s \u201cwhereabouts\u201d re\u00ad\nmained \u201cunknown,\u201d the court concluded that the delay\n\u201cwould be a further waste of time.\u201d Id., at 10. The follow\u00ad\ning colloquy ensued:\n      \u201cTHE COURT: . . . . It\u2019s a quarter to eleven and\n    [Binion and Scott] have not appeared on their own\n    will, so I\u2019m going to bring the jury in now then to\n    swear them.\n      \u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Your Honor, may I ap\u00ad\n    proach briefly?\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Yes.\n4                   MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n       \u201c[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, just so your Honor is\n    aware, I know that it\u2019s the process to bring them in\n    and swear them in; however, the State will not be par\u00ad\n    ticipating in the trial. I wanted to let you know that.\n       \u201cTHE COURT: Very well. We\u2019ll see how that\n    works.\u201d Id., at 10\u201311.\n  The jury was then sworn. After instructing the jury, the\ncourt directed the State to proceed with its opening state\u00ad\nment. The prosecutor demurred: \u201cYour Honor, respect\u00ad\nfully, the State is not participating in this case.\u201d Id., at\n20. After the defense waived its opening statement, the\ncourt directed the State to call its first witness. Again, the\nprosecutor demurred: \u201cRespectfully, your Honor, the State\nis not participating in this matter.\u201d Ibid. The defense\nthen moved for a judgment of acquittal:\n      \u201c[Defense Counsel]: Judge, the jury has been sworn.\n    The State has not presented any evidence. I believe\n    they\u2019ve indicated their intention not to present any ev\u00ad\n    idence or witnesses.\n      \u201cBased on that, Judge, I would ask the Court to\n    enter directed findings of not guilty to both counts, ag\u00ad\n    gravated battery and mob action.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Do the People wish to reply?\n      \u201c[The Prosecutor]: No, your Honor. Respectfully,\n    the State is not participating.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: The Court will grant the motion for\n    a directed finding and dismiss the charges.\u201d Id., at 21.\n                            B\n   The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should\nhave granted a continuance. Martinez responded that the\nState\u2019s appeal was improper because he had been acquit\u00ad\nted. The Illinois Appellate Court sided with the State,\nholding that jeopardy had never attached and that the\ntrial court had erred in failing to grant a continuance.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n2011 IL App (2d) 100498, \u00b6\u00b646, 53\u201356, 969 N. E. 2d 840,\n854, 856\u2013858.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court granted review on the jeop\u00ad\nardy issue and affirmed. 2013 IL 113475, 990 N. E. 2d\n215. It began by recognizing that \u201c[g]enerally, in cases of\na jury trial, jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled\nand sworn, as that is the point when the defendant is \u2018 \u201cput\nto trial before the trier of the facts.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., \u00b623, 990 N. E.\n2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377,\n394 (1975)). But it reasoned that under this Court\u2019s prec\u00ad\nedents, \u201c \u2018 \u201crigid, mechanical\u201d rules\u2019 \u201d should not govern the\ninquiry into whether jeopardy has attached. 2013 IL\n113475, \u00b624, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra,\nat 390). Rather, it opined, the relevant question is whether\na defendant \u201cwas \u2018 \u201csubjected to the hazards of trial and\npossible conviction.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b624, 990 N. E. 2d,\nat 222 (quoting Serfass, supra, at 391).\n   Here, the court concluded, Martinez \u201cwas never at risk\nof conviction\u201d\u2014and jeopardy therefore did not attach\u2014\nbecause \u201c[t]he State indicated it would not participate\nprior to the jury being sworn.\u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b639, 990\nN. E. 2d, at 224. And because Martinez \u201cwas not placed in\njeopardy,\u201d the court held, the trial \u201ccourt\u2019s entry of di\u00ad\nrected verdicts of not guilty did not constitute true acquit\u00ad\ntals.\u201d Id., \u00b640, 990 N. E. 2d, at 225. Indeed, the court\nremarked, the trial court \u201crepeatedly referred to its action\nas a \u2018dismissal\u2019 rather than an acquittal.\u201d Ibid.\n   Justice Burke dissented, writing that the majority\u2019s\nconclusion \u201cthat impaneling and swearing the jury had no\nlegal significance\u201d ran \u201ccontrary to well-established prin\u00ad\nciples regarding double jeopardy.\u201d Id., \u00b657, 990 N. E. 2d,\nat 227. Moreover, she argued, its assertion that Martinez\nwas not in danger of conviction was \u201cbelied by the actions\nof the court and the prosecutor.\u201d Id., \u00b663, 990 N. E. 2d, at\n229. She explained that under the majority\u2019s holding, the\nState could \u201cunilaterally render a trial a \u2018sham\u2019 simply by\n6                   MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nrefusing to call witnesses after a jury has been selected.\u201d\nId., \u00b664, 990 N. E. 2d, at 229.\n                            II\n  This case presents two issues. First, did jeopardy attach\nto Martinez? Second, if so, did the proceeding end in such\na manner that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his retrial?\nOur precedents clearly dictate an affirmative answer\nto each question.\n                              A\n   There are few if any rules of criminal procedure clearer\nthan the rule that \u201cjeopardy attaches when the jury is\nempaneled and sworn.\u201d Crist, 437 U. S., at 35; see also\nUnited States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564,\n569 (1977); Serfass, supra, at 388; 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel,\nN. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a725.1(d) (3d ed.\n2007).\n   Our clearest exposition of this rule came in Crist, which\naddressed the constitutionality of a Montana statute\nproviding that jeopardy did not attach until the swearing\nof the first witness. As Crist explains, \u201cthe precise point at\nwhich jeopardy [attaches] in a jury trial might have been\nopen to argument before this Court\u2019s decision in Downum\nv. United States, 372 U. S. 734 [(1963)],\u201d in which \u201cthe\nCourt held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented a\nsecond prosecution of a defendant whose first trial had\nended just after the jury had been sworn and before any\ntestimony had been taken.\u201d 437 U. S., at 35. But\nDownum put any such argument to rest: Its holding \u201cnec\u00ad\nessarily pinpointed the stage in a jury trial when jeopardy\nattaches, and [it] has since been understood as explicit\nauthority for the proposition that jeopardy attaches when\nthe jury is empaneled and sworn.\u201d Crist, supra, at 35.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court misread our precedents in\nsuggesting that the swearing of the jury is anything other\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthan a bright line at which jeopardy attaches. It relied on\nSerfass, understanding that case to mean \u201cthat in as\u00ad\nsessing whether and when jeopardy attaches, \u2018 \u201crigid,\nmechanical\u201d rules\u2019 should not be applied.\u201d           2013 IL\n113475, \u00b624, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222. Under Serfass, the\ncourt reasoned, the relevant question is whether a defend\u00ad\nant was as a functional matter \u201c \u2018 \u201csubjected to the hazards\nof trial and possible conviction.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b624,\n990 N. E. 2d, at 222.\n   But Serfass does not apply a functional approach to the\ndetermination of when jeopardy has attached. As to that\nquestion, it states the same bright-line rule as every other\ncase: Jeopardy attaches when \u201ca defendant is \u2018put to trial,\u2019 \u201d\nand in a jury trial, that is \u201cwhen a jury is empaneled\nand sworn.\u201d 420 U. S., at 388. Indeed, Serfass explicitly\nrejects a functional approach to the question whether\njeopardy has attached. See id., at 390 (refuting the de\u00ad\nfendant\u2019s argument that \u201c \u2018constructiv[e] jeopardy had\nattached\u2019 \u201d upon the pretrial grant of a motion to dismiss\nthe indictment, which the defendant characterized as \u201cthe\n\u2018functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits\u2019 \u201d). The\nSerfass Court acknowledged \u201cthat we have disparaged\n\u2018rigid, mechanical\u2019 rules in the interpretation of the Double\nJeopardy Clause.\u201d Ibid. But it was referring to the case of\nIllinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S. 458 (1973), in which we\ndeclined to apply \u201crigid, mechanical\u201d reasoning in answer\u00ad\ning a very different question: not whether jeopardy had\nattached, but whether the manner in which it terminated\n(by mistrial) barred the defendant\u2019s retrial. Id., at 467.\nBy contrast, Serfass explains, the rule that jeopardy at\u00ad\ntaches at the start of a trial is \u201cby no means a mere tech\u00ad\nnicality, nor is it a \u2018rigid, mechanical\u2019 rule.\u201d 420 U. S., at\n391. And contrary to the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s inter\u00ad\npretation, Serfass creates not the slightest doubt about\nwhen a \u201ctrial\u201d begins.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s error was consequential,\n8                      MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nfor it introduced confusion into what we have consistently\ntreated as a bright-line rule: A jury trial begins, and jeop\u00ad\nardy attaches, when the jury is sworn. We have never\nsuggested the exception perceived by the Illinois Supreme\nCourt\u2014that jeopardy may not have attached where, under\nthe circumstances of a particular case, the defendant was\nnot genuinely at risk of conviction.3 Martinez was subjected\nto jeopardy because the jury in his case was sworn.\n                               B\n   \u201c \u2018[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has attached,\u2019 \u201d how\u00ad\never, \u201c \u2018begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 390.\nThe remaining question is whether the jeopardy ended in\nsuch a manner that the defendant may not be retried. See\n6 LaFave \u00a725.1(g) (surveying circumstances in which\nretrial is and is not allowed). Here, there is no doubt that\nMartinez\u2019s jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his\nretrial: The trial court acquitted him of the charged of\u00ad\nfenses. \u201cPerhaps the most fundamental rule in the history\nof double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that \u2018[a] verdict\nof acquittal . . . could not be reviewed . . . without putting\n[a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the\nConstitution.\u2019 \u201d Martin Linen, supra, at 571.\n   \u201c[O]ur cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any\nruling that the prosecution\u2019s proof is insufficient to estab\u00ad\nlish criminal liability for an offense.\u201d Evans v. Michigan,\n568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4\u20135). And the trial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Some commentators have suggested that there may be limited ex\u00ad\n\nceptions to this rule\u2014e.g., where the trial court lacks jurisdiction or\nwhere a defendant obtains an acquittal by fraud or corruption. See 6\nW. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a725.1(d)\n(3d ed. 2007). The scope of any such exceptions is not presented here.\nNor need we reach a situation where the prosecutor had no opportunity\nto dismiss the charges to avoid the consequences of empaneling the\njury. Cf. People v. Deems, 81 Ill. 2d 384, 387\u2013389, 410 N. E. 2d 8, 10\u201311\n(1980).\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\ncourt clearly made such a ruling here. After the State\ndeclined to present evidence against Martinez, his counsel\nmoved for \u201cdirected findings of not guilty to both counts,\u201d\nand the court \u201cgrant[ed] the motion for a directed finding.\u201d\nTr. 21. That is a textbook acquittal: a finding that the\nState\u2019s evidence cannot support a conviction.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court thought otherwise. It first\nopined that \u201c[b]ecause [Martinez] was not placed in jeop\u00ad\nardy, the [trial] court\u2019s entry of directed verdicts of not\nguilty did not constitute true acquittals.\u201d 2013 IL 113475,\n\u00b640, 990 N. E. 2d, at 225. But the premise of that argu\u00ad\nment is incorrect: Martinez was in jeopardy, for the rea\u00ad\nsons given above. The court went on to \u201cnote that, in\ndirecting findings of not guilty,\u201d the trial court \u201creferred to\nits action as a \u2018dismissal\u2019 rather than an acquittal.\u201d Ibid.\nUnder our precedents, however, that is immaterial: \u201c[W]e\nhave emphasized that what constitutes an \u2018acquittal\u2019 is\nnot to be controlled by the form of the judge\u2019s action\u201d; it\nturns on \u201cwhether the ruling of the judge, whatever its\nlabel, actually represents a resolution . . . of some or all of\nthe factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d Martin\nLinen, 430 U.

On the day of trial, the court was acutely\naware of the significance of swearing a jury. It repeatedly\ndelayed that act to give the State additional time to find\nits witnesses. It had previously granted the State a num\u00ad\nber of continuances for the same purpose. See supra, at 2.\nAnd, critically, the court told the State on the day of trial\nthat it could \u201cmove to dismiss [its] case\u201d before the jury\nwas sworn. Tr. 3. Had the State accepted that invitation,\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred it from\nrecharging Martinez. Instead, the State participated in\nthe selection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before\nthe jury was sworn. When the State declined to dismiss\nits case, it \u201c \u2018took a chance[,] . . . enter[ing] upon the trial of\nthe case without sufficient evidence to convict.\u2019 \u201d Downum\nv. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 737 (1963). Here, the\nState knew, or should have known, that an acquittal\nforever bars the retrial of the defendant when it occurs\nafter jeopardy has attached. The Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s\nholding is understandable, given the significant conse\u00ad\nquence of the State\u2019s mistake, but it runs directly counter\nto our precedents and to the protection conferred by the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Indeed, even if the trial court had chosen to dismiss the case or de\u00ad\n\nclare a mistrial rather than granting Martinez\u2019s motion for a directed\nverdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause probably would still bar his retrial.\nWe confronted precisely this scenario in Downum v. United States, 372\nU. S. 734 (1963), holding that once jeopardy has attached, the absence\nof witnesses generally does not constitute the kind of \u201c \u2018extraordinary\nand striking circumstanc[e]\u2019 \u201d in which a trial court may exercise\n\u201cdiscretion to discharge the jury before it has reached a verdict.\u201d Id., at\n736; see also Arizona v.

ILLINOIS\n       ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE\n\n              SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n              No. 13\u20135967. Decided May 27, 2014\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   The trial of Esteban Martinez was set to begin on May\n17, 2010. His counsel was ready; the State was not. When\nthe court swore in the jury and invited the State to pre\u00ad\nsent its first witness, the State declined to present any\nevidence. So Martinez moved for a directed not-guilty\nverdict, and the court granted it. The State appealed,\narguing that the trial court should have granted its motion\nfor a continuance. The question is whether the Double\nJeopardy Clause bars the State\u2019s attempt to appeal in the\nhope of subjecting Martinez to a new trial.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court manifestly erred in allowing\nthe State\u2019s appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never\nattached because Martinez \u201cwas never at risk of convic\u00ad\ntion.\u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b639, 990 N. E. 2d 215, 224. Our\ncases have repeatedly stated the bright-line rule that\n\u201cjeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and\nsworn.\u201d Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 35 (1978); see infra, at\n6. There is simply no doubt that Martinez was subjected\nto jeopardy. And because the trial court found the State\u2019s\nevidence insufficient to sustain a conviction, there is\nequally no doubt that Martinez may not be retried.\n   We therefore grant Martinez\u2019s petition for certiorari and\nreverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.\n                             I\n                             A\n  The State of Illinois indicted Martinez in August 2006\non charges of aggravated battery and mob action against\n2                     MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nAvery Binion and Demarco Scott. But Martinez\u2019s trial\ndate did not arrive for nearly four years.1\n   The story picks up for present purposes on July 20,\n2009, when the State moved to continue an August 3 trial\ndate because it had not located the complaining witnesses,\nBinion and Scott. The State subpoenaed both men four\ndays later, and the court rescheduled Martinez\u2019s trial to\nSeptember 28. But the State sought another continuance,\nshortly before that date, because it still had not found\nBinion and Scott. The court rescheduled the trial to No\u00ad\nvember 9, and the State reissued subpoenas. But Novem\u00ad\nber 9 came and went (the court continued the case when\nMartinez showed up late) and the trial was eventually\ndelayed to the following March 29. In early February, the\nState yet again subpoenaed Binion and Scott. When\nMarch 29 arrived, the trial court granted the State an\u00ad\nother continuance. It reset the trial date for May 17 and\nordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May 10.\nAnd the State once more issued subpoenas.2\n   On the morning of May 17, however, Binion and Scott\nwere again nowhere to be found. At 8:30, when the trial\nwas set to begin, the State asked for a brief continuance.\nThe court offered to delay swearing the jurors until a\ncomplete jury had been empaneled and told the State that\nit could at that point either have the jury sworn or move to\ndismiss its case. When Binion and Scott still had not\nshown up after the jury was chosen, the court offered to\ncall the other cases on its docket so as to delay swearing\nthe jury a bit longer. But when all these delays had run\nout, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight. The\nState filed a written motion for a continuance, arguing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Much of that delay was due to Martinez and his counsel. See 2013\n\nIL 113475, \u00b64, n. 1, 990 N. E. 2d 215, 216, n. 1 (summarizing the\nlengthy procedural history).\n  2 These facts are set forth in the opinion of the Illinois Appellate\n\nCourt. 2011 IL App (2d) 100498, \u00b6\u00b65\u20137, 969 N.

The court denied that motion:\n       \u201cThe case before the Court began on July 7, 2006.\n    In two months we will then be embarking upon half a\n    decade of pending a Class 3 felony. Avery Binion, Jr.,\n    and Demarco [Scott] are well known in Elgin, both are\n    convicted felons. One would believe that the Elgin Po\u00ad\n    lice Department would know their whereabouts. They\n    were ordered to be in court today. The Court will is\u00ad\n    sue body writs for both of these gentlemen.\n       \u201cIn addition, the State\u2019s list of witnesses indi\u00ad\n    cates twelve witnesses. Excluding Mr. Scott and Mr.\n    Binion, that\u2019s ten witnesses. The Court would antici\u00ad\n    pate it would take every bit of today and most of to\u00ad\n    morrow to get through ten witnesses. By then the\n    People may have had a chance to execute the arrest\n    warrant body writs for these two gentlemen.\n       \u201cThe Court will deny the motion for continuance. I\n    will swear the jury in in 15, 20 minutes. Perhaps you\n    might want to send the police out to find these two\n    gentlemen.\u201d Id., at 8\u20139.\n   After a brief recess, the court offered to delay the start\nof the trial for several more hours if the continuance would\n\u201cbe of any help\u201d to the State. Id., at 9. But when the State\nmade clear that Binion and Scott\u2019s \u201cwhereabouts\u201d re\u00ad\nmained \u201cunknown,\u201d the court concluded that the delay\n\u201cwould be a further waste of time.\u201d Id., at 10. The follow\u00ad\ning colloquy ensued:\n      \u201cTHE COURT: . . . . It\u2019s a quarter to eleven and\n    [Binion and Scott] have not appeared on their own\n    will, so I\u2019m going to bring the jury in now then to\n    swear them.\n      \u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Your Honor, may I ap\u00ad\n    proach briefly?\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Yes.\n4                   MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n       \u201c[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, just so your Honor is\n    aware, I know that it\u2019s the process to bring them in\n    and swear them in; however, the State will not be par\u00ad\n    ticipating in the trial. I wanted to let you know that.\n       \u201cTHE COURT: Very well. We\u2019ll see how that\n    works.\u201d Id., at 10\u201311.\n  The jury was then sworn. After instructing the jury, the\ncourt directed the State to proceed with its opening state\u00ad\nment. The prosecutor demurred: \u201cYour Honor, respect\u00ad\nfully, the State is not participating in this case.\u201d Id., at\n20. After the defense waived its opening statement, the\ncourt directed the State to call its first witness. Again, the\nprosecutor demurred: \u201cRespectfully, your Honor, the State\nis not participating in this matter.\u201d Ibid. The defense\nthen moved for a judgment of acquittal:\n      \u201c[Defense Counsel]: Judge, the jury has been sworn.\n    The State has not presented any evidence. I believe\n    they\u2019ve indicated their intention not to present any ev\u00ad\n    idence or witnesses.\n      \u201cBased on that, Judge, I would ask the Court to\n    enter directed findings of not guilty to both counts, ag\u00ad\n    gravated battery and mob action.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Do the People wish to reply?\n      \u201c[The Prosecutor]: No, your Honor. Respectfully,\n    the State is not participating.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: The Court will grant the motion for\n    a directed finding and dismiss the charges.\u201d Id., at 21.\n                            B\n   The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should\nhave granted a continuance. Martinez responded that the\nState\u2019s appeal was improper because he had been acquit\u00ad\nted. The Illinois Appellate Court sided with the State,\nholding that jeopardy had never attached and that the\ntrial court had erred in failing to grant a continuance.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n2011 IL App (2d) 100498, \u00b6\u00b646, 53\u201356, 969 N. E. 2d 840,\n854, 856\u2013858.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court granted review on the jeop\u00ad\nardy issue and affirmed. 2013 IL 113475, 990 N. E. 2d\n215. It began by recognizing that \u201c[g]enerally, in cases of\na jury trial, jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled\nand sworn, as that is the point when the defendant is \u2018 \u201cput\nto trial before the trier of the facts.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., \u00b623, 990 N. E.\n2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377,\n394 (1975)). But it reasoned that under this Court\u2019s prec\u00ad\nedents, \u201c \u2018 \u201crigid, mechanical\u201d rules\u2019 \u201d should not govern the\ninquiry into whether jeopardy has attached. 2013 IL\n113475, \u00b624, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra,\nat 390). Rather, it opined, the relevant question is whether\na defendant \u201cwas \u2018 \u201csubjected to the hazards of trial and\npossible conviction.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b624, 990 N. E. 2d,\nat 222 (quoting Serfass, supra, at 391).\n   Here, the court concluded, Martinez \u201cwas never at risk\nof conviction\u201d\u2014and jeopardy therefore did not attach\u2014\nbecause \u201c[t]he State indicated it would not participate\nprior to the jury being sworn.\u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b639, 990\nN. E. 2d, at 224. And because Martinez \u201cwas not placed in\njeopardy,\u201d the court held, the trial \u201ccourt\u2019s entry of di\u00ad\nrected verdicts of not guilty did not constitute true acquit\u00ad\ntals.\u201d Id., \u00b640, 990 N. E. 2d, at 225. Indeed, the court\nremarked, the trial court \u201crepeatedly referred to its action\nas a \u2018dismissal\u2019 rather than an acquittal.\u201d Ibid.\n   Justice Burke dissented, writing that the majority\u2019s\nconclusion \u201cthat impaneling and swearing the jury had no\nlegal significance\u201d ran \u201ccontrary to well-established prin\u00ad\nciples regarding double jeopardy.\u201d Id., \u00b657, 990 N. E. 2d,\nat 227. Moreover, she argued, its assertion that Martinez\nwas not in danger of conviction was \u201cbelied by the actions\nof the court and the prosecutor.\u201d Id., \u00b663, 990 N. E. 2d, at\n229. She explained that under the majority\u2019s holding, the\nState could \u201cunilaterally render a trial a \u2018sham\u2019 simply by\n6                   MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nrefusing to call witnesses after a jury has been selected.\u201d\nId., \u00b664, 990 N. E. 2d, at 229.\n                            II\n  This case presents two issues. First, did jeopardy attach\nto Martinez? Second, if so, did the proceeding end in such\na manner that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his retrial?\nOur precedents clearly dictate an affirmative answer\nto each question.\n                              A\n   There are few if any rules of criminal procedure clearer\nthan the rule that \u201cjeopardy attaches when the jury is\nempaneled and sworn.\u201d Crist, 437 U. S., at 35; see also\nUnited States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564,\n569 (1977); Serfass, supra, at 388; 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel,\nN. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a725.1(d) (3d ed.\n2007).\n   Our clearest exposition of this rule came in Crist, which\naddressed the constitutionality of a Montana statute\nproviding that jeopardy did not attach until the swearing\nof the first witness. As Crist explains, \u201cthe precise point at\nwhich jeopardy [attaches] in a jury trial might have been\nopen to argument before this Court\u2019s decision in Downum\nv. United States, 372 U. S. 734 [(1963)],\u201d in which \u201cthe\nCourt held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented a\nsecond prosecution of a defendant whose first trial had\nended just after the jury had been sworn and before any\ntestimony had been taken.\u201d 437 U. S., at 35. But\nDownum put any such argument to rest: Its holding \u201cnec\u00ad\nessarily pinpointed the stage in a jury trial when jeopardy\nattaches, and [it] has since been understood as explicit\nauthority for the proposition that jeopardy attaches when\nthe jury is empaneled and sworn.\u201d Crist, supra, at 35.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court misread our precedents in\nsuggesting that the swearing of the jury is anything other\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthan a bright line at which jeopardy attaches. It relied on\nSerfass, understanding that case to mean \u201cthat in as\u00ad\nsessing whether and when jeopardy attaches, \u2018 \u201crigid,\nmechanical\u201d rules\u2019 should not be applied.\u201d           2013 IL\n113475, \u00b624, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222. Under Serfass, the\ncourt reasoned, the relevant question is whether a defend\u00ad\nant was as a functional matter \u201c \u2018 \u201csubjected to the hazards\nof trial and possible conviction.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b624,\n990 N. E. 2d, at 222.\n   But Serfass does not apply a functional approach to the\ndetermination of when jeopardy has attached. As to that\nquestion, it states the same bright-line rule as every other\ncase: Jeopardy attaches when \u201ca defendant is \u2018put to trial,\u2019 \u201d\nand in a jury trial, that is \u201cwhen a jury is empaneled\nand sworn.\u201d 420 U. S., at 388. Indeed, Serfass explicitly\nrejects a functional approach to the question whether\njeopardy has attached. See id., at 390 (refuting the de\u00ad\nfendant\u2019s argument that \u201c \u2018constructiv[e] jeopardy had\nattached\u2019 \u201d upon the pretrial grant of a motion to dismiss\nthe indictment, which the defendant characterized as \u201cthe\n\u2018functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits\u2019 \u201d). The\nSerfass Court acknowledged \u201cthat we have disparaged\n\u2018rigid, mechanical\u2019 rules in the interpretation of the Double\nJeopardy Clause.\u201d Ibid. But it was referring to the case of\nIllinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S. 458 (1973), in which we\ndeclined to apply \u201crigid, mechanical\u201d reasoning in answer\u00ad\ning a very different question: not whether jeopardy had\nattached, but whether the manner in which it terminated\n(by mistrial) barred the defendant\u2019s retrial. Id., at 467.\nBy contrast, Serfass explains, the rule that jeopardy at\u00ad\ntaches at the start of a trial is \u201cby no means a mere tech\u00ad\nnicality, nor is it a \u2018rigid, mechanical\u2019 rule.\u201d 420 U. S., at\n391. And contrary to the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s inter\u00ad\npretation, Serfass creates not the slightest doubt about\nwhen a \u201ctrial\u201d begins.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s error was consequential,\n8                      MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nfor it introduced confusion into what we have consistently\ntreated as a bright-line rule: A jury trial begins, and jeop\u00ad\nardy attaches, when the jury is sworn. We have never\nsuggested the exception perceived by the Illinois Supreme\nCourt\u2014that jeopardy may not have attached where, under\nthe circumstances of a particular case, the defendant was\nnot genuinely at risk of conviction.3 Martinez was subjected\nto jeopardy because the jury in his case was sworn.\n                               B\n   \u201c \u2018[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has attached,\u2019 \u201d how\u00ad\never, \u201c \u2018begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 390.\nThe remaining question is whether the jeopardy ended in\nsuch a manner that the defendant may not be retried. See\n6 LaFave \u00a725.1(g) (surveying circumstances in which\nretrial is and is not allowed). Here, there is no doubt that\nMartinez\u2019s jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his\nretrial: The trial court acquitted him of the charged of\u00ad\nfenses. \u201cPerhaps the most fundamental rule in the history\nof double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that \u2018[a] verdict\nof acquittal . . . could not be reviewed . . . without putting\n[a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the\nConstitution.\u2019 \u201d Martin Linen, supra, at 571.\n   \u201c[O]ur cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any\nruling that the prosecution\u2019s proof is insufficient to estab\u00ad\nlish criminal liability for an offense.\u201d Evans v. Michigan,\n568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4\u20135). And the trial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Some commentators have suggested that there may be limited ex\u00ad\n\nceptions to this rule\u2014e.g., where the trial court lacks jurisdiction or\nwhere a defendant obtains an acquittal by fraud or corruption. See 6\nW. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a725.1(d)\n(3d ed. 2007). The scope of any such exceptions is not presented here.\nNor need we reach a situation where the prosecutor had no opportunity\nto dismiss the charges to avoid the consequences of empaneling the\njury.

After the State\ndeclined to present evidence against Martinez, his counsel\nmoved for \u201cdirected findings of not guilty to both counts,\u201d\nand the court \u201cgrant[ed] the motion for a directed finding.\u201d\nTr. 21. That is a textbook acquittal: a finding that the\nState\u2019s evidence cannot support a conviction.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court thought otherwise. It first\nopined that \u201c[b]ecause [Martinez] was not placed in jeop\u00ad\nardy, the [trial] court\u2019s entry of directed verdicts of not\nguilty did not constitute true acquittals.\u201d 2013 IL 113475,\n\u00b640, 990 N. E. 2d, at 225. But the premise of that argu\u00ad\nment is incorrect: Martinez was in jeopardy, for the rea\u00ad\nsons given above. The court went on to \u201cnote that, in\ndirecting findings of not guilty,\u201d the trial court \u201creferred to\nits action as a \u2018dismissal\u2019 rather than an acquittal.\u201d Ibid.\nUnder our precedents, however, that is immaterial: \u201c[W]e\nhave emphasized that what constitutes an \u2018acquittal\u2019 is\nnot to be controlled by the form of the judge\u2019s action\u201d; it\nturns on \u201cwhether the ruling of the judge, whatever its\nlabel, actually represents a resolution . . . of some or all of\nthe factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d Martin\nLinen, 430 U. S., at 571; see also Evans, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 11) (\u201cOur decision turns not on the form of the trial\ncourt\u2019s action, but rather whether it \u2018serve[s]\u2019 substantive\n\u2018purposes\u2019 or procedural ones\u201d); United States v. Scott, 437\nU. S. 82, 96 (1978) (\u201cWe have previously noted that \u2018the\ntrial judge\u2019s characterization of his own action cannot\ncontrol the classification of the action\u2019 \u201d).\n   Here, as in Evans and Martin Linen, the trial court\u2019s\naction was an acquittal because the court \u201cacted on its\nview that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.\u201d\nEvans, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11); see Martin Linen,\nsupra, at 572 (\u201c[T]he District Court in this case evaluated\nthe Government\u2019s evidence and determined that it was\nlegally insufficient to sustain a conviction\u201d). And because\n10                      MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nMartinez was acquitted, the State cannot retry him.4\n                                III\n   The functional rule adopted by the Illinois Supreme\nCourt is not necessary to avoid unfairness to prosecutors\nor to the public. On the day of trial, the court was acutely\naware of the significance of swearing a jury. It repeatedly\ndelayed that act to give the State additional time to find\nits witnesses. It had previously granted the State a num\u00ad\nber of continuances for the same purpose. See supra, at 2.\nAnd, critically, the court told the State on the day of trial\nthat it could \u201cmove to dismiss [its] case\u201d before the jury\nwas sworn. Tr. 3. Had the State accepted that invitation,\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred it from\nrecharging Martinez. Instead, the State participated in\nthe selection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before\nthe jury was sworn. When the State declined to dismiss\nits case, it \u201c \u2018took a chance[,] . . . enter[ing] upon the trial of\nthe case without sufficient evidence to convict.\u2019 \u201d Downum\nv. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 737 (1963). Here, the\nState knew, or should have known, that an acquittal\nforever bars the retrial of the defendant when it occurs\nafter jeopardy has attached. The Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s\nholding is understandable, given the significant conse\u00ad\nquence of the State\u2019s mistake, but it runs directly counter\nto our precedents and to the protection conferred by the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Indeed, even if the trial court had chosen to dismiss the case or de\u00ad\n\nclare a mistrial rather than granting Martinez\u2019s motion for a directed\nverdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause probably would still bar his retrial.\nWe confronted precisely this scenario in Downum v. United States, 372\nU. S. 734 (1963), holding that once jeopardy has attached, the absence\nof witnesses generally does not constitute the kind of \u201c \u2018extraordinary\nand striking circumstanc[e]\u2019 \u201d in which a trial court may exercise\n\u201cdiscretion to discharge the jury before it has reached a verdict.\u201d Id., at\n736; see also Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 508, n. 24 (1978).\n                  Cite as: 572 U.
