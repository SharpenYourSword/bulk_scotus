ILLINOIS\n       ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE\n\n              SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n              No. 13–5967. Decided May 27, 2014\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   The trial of Esteban Martinez was set to begin on May\n17, 2010. His counsel was ready; the State was not. When\nthe court swore in the jury and invited the State to pre­\nsent its first witness, the State declined to present any\nevidence. So Martinez moved for a directed not-guilty\nverdict, and the court granted it. The State appealed,\narguing that the trial court should have granted its motion\nfor a continuance. The question is whether the Double\nJeopardy Clause bars the State’s attempt to appeal in the\nhope of subjecting Martinez to a new trial.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court manifestly erred in allowing\nthe State’s appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never\nattached because Martinez “was never at risk of convic­\ntion.” 2013 IL 113475, ¶39, 990 N. E. 2d 215, 224. Our\ncases have repeatedly stated the bright-line rule that\n“jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and\nsworn.” Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 35 (1978); see infra, at\n6. There is simply no doubt that Martinez was subjected\nto jeopardy. And because the trial court found the State’s\nevidence insufficient to sustain a conviction, there is\nequally no doubt that Martinez may not be retried.\n   We therefore grant Martinez’s petition for certiorari and\nreverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.\n                             I\n                             A\n  The State of Illinois indicted Martinez in August 2006\non charges of aggravated battery and mob action against\n2                     MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nAvery Binion and Demarco Scott. But Martinez’s trial\ndate did not arrive for nearly four years.1\n   The story picks up for present purposes on July 20,\n2009, when the State moved to continue an August 3 trial\ndate because it had not located the complaining witnesses,\nBinion and Scott. The State subpoenaed both men four\ndays later, and the court rescheduled Martinez’s trial to\nSeptember 28. But the State sought another continuance,\nshortly before that date, because it still had not found\nBinion and Scott. The court rescheduled the trial to No­\nvember 9, and the State reissued subpoenas. But Novem­\nber 9 came and went (the court continued the case when\nMartinez showed up late) and the trial was eventually\ndelayed to the following March 29. In early February, the\nState yet again subpoenaed Binion and Scott. When\nMarch 29 arrived, the trial court granted the State an­\nother continuance. It reset the trial date for May 17 and\nordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May 10.\nAnd the State once more issued subpoenas.2\n   On the morning of May 17, however, Binion and Scott\nwere again nowhere to be found. At 8:30, when the trial\nwas set to begin, the State asked for a brief continuance.\nThe court offered to delay swearing the jurors until a\ncomplete jury had been empaneled and told the State that\nit could at that point either have the jury sworn or move to\ndismiss its case. When Binion and Scott still had not\nshown up after the jury was chosen, the court offered to\ncall the other cases on its docket so as to delay swearing\nthe jury a bit longer. But when all these delays had run\nout, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight. The\nState filed a written motion for a continuance, arguing\n——————\n  1 Much of that delay was due to Martinez and his counsel. See 2013\n\nIL 113475, ¶4, n. 1, 990 N. E. 2d 215, 216, n. 1 (summarizing the\nlengthy procedural history).\n  2 These facts are set forth in the opinion of the Illinois Appellate\n\nCourt. 2011 IL App (2d) 100498, ¶¶5–7, 969 N. E. 2d 840, 842–843.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthat it was “unable to proceed” without Binion and Scott.\nTr. 7. The court denied that motion:\n       “The case before the Court began on July 7, 2006.\n    In two months we will then be embarking upon half a\n    decade of pending a Class 3 felony. Avery Binion, Jr.,\n    and Demarco [Scott] are well known in Elgin, both are\n    convicted felons. One would believe that the Elgin Po­\n    lice Department would know their whereabouts. They\n    were ordered to be in court today. The Court will is­\n    sue body writs for both of these gentlemen.\n       “In addition, the State’s list of witnesses indi­\n    cates twelve witnesses. Excluding Mr. Scott and Mr.\n    Binion, that’s ten witnesses. The Court would antici­\n    pate it would take every bit of today and most of to­\n    morrow to get through ten witnesses. By then the\n    People may have had a chance to execute the arrest\n    warrant body writs for these two gentlemen.\n       “The Court will deny the motion for continuance. I\n    will swear the jury in in 15, 20 minutes. Perhaps you\n    might want to send the police out to find these two\n    gentlemen.” Id., at 8–9.\n   After a brief recess, the court offered to delay the start\nof the trial for several more hours if the continuance would\n“be of any help” to the State. Id., at 9. But when the State\nmade clear that Binion and Scott’s “whereabouts” re­\nmained “unknown,” the court concluded that the delay\n“would be a further waste of time.” Id., at 10. The follow­\ning colloquy ensued:\n      “THE COURT: . . . . It’s a quarter to eleven and\n    [Binion and Scott] have not appeared on their own\n    will, so I’m going to bring the jury in now then to\n    swear them.\n      “[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Your Honor, may I ap­\n    proach briefly?\n      “THE COURT: Yes.\n4                   MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n       “[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, just so your Honor is\n    aware, I know that it’s the process to bring them in\n    and swear them in; however, the State will not be par­\n    ticipating in the trial. I wanted to let you know that.\n       “THE COURT: Very well. We’ll see how that\n    works.” Id., at 10–11.\n  The jury was then sworn. After instructing the jury, the\ncourt directed the State to proceed with its opening state­\nment. The prosecutor demurred: “Your Honor, respect­\nfully, the State is not participating in this case.” Id., at\n20. After the defense waived its opening statement, the\ncourt directed the State to call its first witness. Again, the\nprosecutor demurred: “Respectfully, your Honor, the State\nis not participating in this matter.” Ibid. The defense\nthen moved for a judgment of acquittal:\n      “[Defense Counsel]: Judge, the jury has been sworn.\n    The State has not presented any evidence. I believe\n    they’ve indicated their intention not to present any ev­\n    idence or witnesses.\n      “Based on that, Judge, I would ask the Court to\n    enter directed findings of not guilty to both counts, ag­\n    gravated battery and mob action.\n      “THE COURT: Do the People wish to reply?\n      “[The Prosecutor]: No, your Honor. Respectfully,\n    the State is not participating.\n      “THE COURT: The Court will grant the motion for\n    a directed finding and dismiss the charges.” Id., at 21.\n                            B\n   The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should\nhave granted a continuance. Martinez responded that the\nState’s appeal was improper because he had been acquit­\nted. The Illinois Appellate Court sided with the State,\nholding that jeopardy had never attached and that the\ntrial court had erred in failing to grant a continuance.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n2011 IL App (2d) 100498, ¶¶46, 53–56, 969 N. E. 2d 840,\n854, 856–858.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court granted review on the jeop­\nardy issue and affirmed. 2013 IL 113475, 990 N. E. 2d\n215. It began by recognizing that “[g]enerally, in cases of\na jury trial, jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled\nand sworn, as that is the point when the defendant is ‘ “put\nto trial before the trier of the facts.” ’ ” Id., ¶23, 990 N. E.\n2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377,\n394 (1975)). But it reasoned that under this Court’s prec­\nedents, “ ‘ “rigid, mechanical” rules’ ” should not govern the\ninquiry into whether jeopardy has attached. 2013 IL\n113475, ¶24, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra,\nat 390). Rather, it opined, the relevant question is whether\na defendant “was ‘ “subjected to the hazards of trial and\npossible conviction.” ’ ” 2013 IL 113475, ¶24, 990 N. E. 2d,\nat 222 (quoting Serfass, supra, at 391).\n   Here, the court concluded, Martinez “was never at risk\nof conviction”—and jeopardy therefore did not attach—\nbecause “[t]he State indicated it would not participate\nprior to the jury being sworn.” 2013 IL 113475, ¶39, 990\nN. E. 2d, at 224. And because Martinez “was not placed in\njeopardy,” the court held, the trial “court’s entry of di­\nrected verdicts of not guilty did not constitute true acquit­\ntals.” Id., ¶40, 990 N. E. 2d, at 225. Indeed, the court\nremarked, the trial court “repeatedly referred to its action\nas a ‘dismissal’ rather than an acquittal.” Ibid.\n   Justice Burke dissented, writing that the majority’s\nconclusion “that impaneling and swearing the jury had no\nlegal significance” ran “contrary to well-established prin­\nciples regarding double jeopardy.” Id., ¶57, 990 N. E. 2d,\nat 227. Moreover, she argued, its assertion that Martinez\nwas not in danger of conviction was “belied by the actions\nof the court and the prosecutor.” Id., ¶63, 990 N. E. 2d, at\n229. She explained that under the majority’s holding, the\nState could “unilaterally render a trial a ‘sham’ simply by\n6                   MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nrefusing to call witnesses after a jury has been selected.”\nId., ¶64, 990 N. E. 2d, at 229.\n                            II\n  This case presents two issues. First, did jeopardy attach\nto Martinez? Second, if so, did the proceeding end in such\na manner that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his retrial?\nOur precedents clearly dictate an affirmative answer\nto each question.\n                              A\n   There are few if any rules of criminal procedure clearer\nthan the rule that “jeopardy attaches when the jury is\nempaneled and sworn.” Crist, 437 U. S., at 35; see also\nUnited States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564,\n569 (1977); Serfass, supra, at 388; 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel,\nN. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §25.1(d) (3d ed.\n2007).\n   Our clearest exposition of this rule came in Crist, which\naddressed the constitutionality of a Montana statute\nproviding that jeopardy did not attach until the swearing\nof the first witness. As Crist explains, “the precise point at\nwhich jeopardy [attaches] in a jury trial might have been\nopen to argument before this Court’s decision in Downum\nv. United States, 372 U. S. 734 [(1963)],” in which “the\nCourt held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented a\nsecond prosecution of a defendant whose first trial had\nended just after the jury had been sworn and before any\ntestimony had been taken.” 437 U. S., at 35. But\nDownum put any such argument to rest: Its holding “nec­\nessarily pinpointed the stage in a jury trial when jeopardy\nattaches, and [it] has since been understood as explicit\nauthority for the proposition that jeopardy attaches when\nthe jury is empaneled and sworn.” Crist, supra, at 35.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court misread our precedents in\nsuggesting that the swearing of the jury is anything other\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthan a bright line at which jeopardy attaches. It relied on\nSerfass, understanding that case to mean “that in as­\nsessing whether and when jeopardy attaches, ‘ “rigid,\nmechanical” rules’ should not be applied.”           2013 IL\n113475, ¶24, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222. Under Serfass, the\ncourt reasoned, the relevant question is whether a defend­\nant was as a functional matter “ ‘ “subjected to the hazards\nof trial and possible conviction.” ’ ” 2013 IL 113475, ¶24,\n990 N. E. 2d, at 222.\n   But Serfass does not apply a functional approach to the\ndetermination of when jeopardy has attached. As to that\nquestion, it states the same bright-line rule as every other\ncase: Jeopardy attaches when “a defendant is ‘put to trial,’ ”\nand in a jury trial, that is “when a jury is empaneled\nand sworn.” 420 U. S., at 388. Indeed, Serfass explicitly\nrejects a functional approach to the question whether\njeopardy has attached. See id., at 390 (refuting the de­\nfendant’s argument that “ ‘constructiv[e] jeopardy had\nattached’ ” upon the pretrial grant of a motion to dismiss\nthe indictment, which the defendant characterized as “the\n‘functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits’ ”). The\nSerfass Court acknowledged “that we have disparaged\n‘rigid, mechanical’ rules in the interpretation of the Double\nJeopardy Clause.” Ibid. But it was referring to the case of\nIllinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S. 458 (1973), in which we\ndeclined to apply “rigid, mechanical” reasoning in answer­\ning a very different question: not whether jeopardy had\nattached, but whether the manner in which it terminated\n(by mistrial) barred the defendant’s retrial. Id., at 467.\nBy contrast, Serfass explains, the rule that jeopardy at­\ntaches at the start of a trial is “by no means a mere tech­\nnicality, nor is it a ‘rigid, mechanical’ rule.” 420 U. S., at\n391. And contrary to the Illinois Supreme Court’s inter­\npretation, Serfass creates not the slightest doubt about\nwhen a “trial” begins.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court’s error was consequential,\n8                      MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nfor it introduced confusion into what we have consistently\ntreated as a bright-line rule: A jury trial begins, and jeop­\nardy attaches, when the jury is sworn. We have never\nsuggested the exception perceived by the Illinois Supreme\nCourt—that jeopardy may not have attached where, under\nthe circumstances of a particular case, the defendant was\nnot genuinely at risk of conviction.3 Martinez was subjected\nto jeopardy because the jury in his case was sworn.\n                               B\n   “ ‘[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has attached,’ ” how­\never, “ ‘begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.’ ” Id., at 390.\nThe remaining question is whether the jeopardy ended in\nsuch a manner that the defendant may not be retried. See\n6 LaFave §25.1(g) (surveying circumstances in which\nretrial is and is not allowed). Here, there is no doubt that\nMartinez’s jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his\nretrial: The trial court acquitted him of the charged of­\nfenses. “Perhaps the most fundamental rule in the history\nof double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that ‘[a] verdict\nof acquittal . . . could not be reviewed . . . without putting\n[a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the\nConstitution.’ ” Martin Linen, supra, at 571.\n   “[O]ur cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any\nruling that the prosecution’s proof is insufficient to estab­\nlish criminal liability for an offense.” Evans v. Michigan,\n568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4–5). And the trial\n——————\n  3 Some commentators have suggested that there may be limited ex­\n\nceptions to this rule—e.g., where the trial court lacks jurisdiction or\nwhere a defendant obtains an acquittal by fraud or corruption. See 6\nW. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §25.1(d)\n(3d ed. 2007). The scope of any such exceptions is not presented here.\nNor need we reach a situation where the prosecutor had no opportunity\nto dismiss the charges to avoid the consequences of empaneling the\njury.

After the State\ndeclined to present evidence against Martinez, his counsel\nmoved for “directed findings of not guilty to both counts,”\nand the court “grant[ed] the motion for a directed finding.”\nTr. 21. That is a textbook acquittal: a finding that the\nState’s evidence cannot support a conviction.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court thought otherwise. It first\nopined that “[b]ecause [Martinez] was not placed in jeop­\nardy, the [trial] court’s entry of directed verdicts of not\nguilty did not constitute true acquittals.” 2013 IL 113475,\n¶40, 990 N. E. 2d, at 225. But the premise of that argu­\nment is incorrect: Martinez was in jeopardy, for the rea­\nsons given above. The court went on to “note that, in\ndirecting findings of not guilty,” the trial court “referred to\nits action as a ‘dismissal’ rather than an acquittal.” Ibid.\nUnder our precedents, however, that is immaterial: “[W]e\nhave emphasized that what constitutes an ‘acquittal’ is\nnot to be controlled by the form of the judge’s action”; it\nturns on “whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its\nlabel, actually represents a resolution . . . of some or all of\nthe factual elements of the offense charged.” Martin\nLinen, 430 U. S., at 571; see also Evans, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 11) (“Our decision turns not on the form of the trial\ncourt’s action, but rather whether it ‘serve[s]’ substantive\n‘purposes’ or procedural ones”); United States v. Scott, 437\nU. S. 82, 96 (1978) (“We have previously noted that ‘the\ntrial judge’s characterization of his own action cannot\ncontrol the classification of the action’ ”).\n   Here, as in Evans and Martin Linen, the trial court’s\naction was an acquittal because the court “acted on its\nview that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.”\nEvans, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11); see Martin Linen,\nsupra, at 572 (“[T]he District Court in this case evaluated\nthe Government’s evidence and determined that it was\nlegally insufficient to sustain a conviction”). And because\n10                      MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nMartinez was acquitted, the State cannot retry him.4\n                                III\n   The functional rule adopted by the Illinois Supreme\nCourt is not necessary to avoid unfairness to prosecutors\nor to the public. On the day of trial, the court was acutely\naware of the significance of swearing a jury. It repeatedly\ndelayed that act to give the State additional time to find\nits witnesses. It had previously granted the State a num­\nber of continuances for the same purpose. See supra, at 2.\nAnd, critically, the court told the State on the day of trial\nthat it could “move to dismiss [its] case” before the jury\nwas sworn. Tr. 3. Had the State accepted that invitation,\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred it from\nrecharging Martinez. Instead, the State participated in\nthe selection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before\nthe jury was sworn. When the State declined to dismiss\nits case, it “ ‘took a chance[,] . . . enter[ing] upon the trial of\nthe case without sufficient evidence to convict.’ ” Downum\nv. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 737 (1963). Here, the\nState knew, or should have known, that an acquittal\nforever bars the retrial of the defendant when it occurs\nafter jeopardy has attached. The Illinois Supreme Court’s\nholding is understandable, given the significant conse­\nquence of the State’s mistake, but it runs directly counter\nto our precedents and to the protection conferred by the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\n\n——————\n  4 Indeed, even if the trial court had chosen to dismiss the case or de­\n\nclare a mistrial rather than granting Martinez’s motion for a directed\nverdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause probably would still bar his retrial.\nWe confronted precisely this scenario in Downum v. United States, 372\nU. S. 734 (1963), holding that once jeopardy has attached, the absence\nof witnesses generally does not constitute the kind of “ ‘extraordinary\nand striking circumstanc[e]’ ” in which a trial court may exercise\n“discretion to discharge the jury before it has reached a verdict.” Id., at\n736; see also Arizona v.

Decided May 27, 2014\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   The trial of Esteban Martinez was set to begin on May\n17, 2010. His counsel was ready; the State was not. When\nthe court swore in the jury and invited the State to pre­\nsent its first witness, the State declined to present any\nevidence. So Martinez moved for a directed not-guilty\nverdict, and the court granted it. The State appealed,\narguing that the trial court should have granted its motion\nfor a continuance. The question is whether the Double\nJeopardy Clause bars the State’s attempt to appeal in the\nhope of subjecting Martinez to a new trial.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court manifestly erred in allowing\nthe State’s appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never\nattached because Martinez “was never at risk of convic­\ntion.” 2013 IL 113475, ¶39, 990 N. E. 2d 215, 224. Our\ncases have repeatedly stated the bright-line rule that\n“jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and\nsworn.” Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 35 (1978); see infra, at\n6. There is simply no doubt that Martinez was subjected\nto jeopardy. And because the trial court found the State’s\nevidence insufficient to sustain a conviction, there is\nequally no doubt that Martinez may not be retried.\n   We therefore grant Martinez’s petition for certiorari and\nreverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.\n                             I\n                             A\n  The State of Illinois indicted Martinez in August 2006\non charges of aggravated battery and mob action against\n2                     MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nAvery Binion and Demarco Scott. But Martinez’s trial\ndate did not arrive for nearly four years.1\n   The story picks up for present purposes on July 20,\n2009, when the State moved to continue an August 3 trial\ndate because it had not located the complaining witnesses,\nBinion and Scott. The State subpoenaed both men four\ndays later, and the court rescheduled Martinez’s trial to\nSeptember 28. But the State sought another continuance,\nshortly before that date, because it still had not found\nBinion and Scott. The court rescheduled the trial to No­\nvember 9, and the State reissued subpoenas. But Novem­\nber 9 came and went (the court continued the case when\nMartinez showed up late) and the trial was eventually\ndelayed to the following March 29. In early February, the\nState yet again subpoenaed Binion and Scott. When\nMarch 29 arrived, the trial court granted the State an­\nother continuance. It reset the trial date for May 17 and\nordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May 10.\nAnd the State once more issued subpoenas.2\n   On the morning of May 17, however, Binion and Scott\nwere again nowhere to be found. At 8:30, when the trial\nwas set to begin, the State asked for a brief continuance.\nThe court offered to delay swearing the jurors until a\ncomplete jury had been empaneled and told the State that\nit could at that point either have the jury sworn or move to\ndismiss its case. When Binion and Scott still had not\nshown up after the jury was chosen, the court offered to\ncall the other cases on its docket so as to delay swearing\nthe jury a bit longer. But when all these delays had run\nout, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight. The\nState filed a written motion for a continuance, arguing\n——————\n  1 Much of that delay was due to Martinez and his counsel. See 2013\n\nIL 113475, ¶4, n. 1, 990 N. E. 2d 215, 216, n. 1 (summarizing the\nlengthy procedural history).\n  2 These facts are set forth in the opinion of the Illinois Appellate\n\nCourt. 2011 IL App (2d) 100498, ¶¶5–7, 969 N.

The court denied that motion:\n       “The case before the Court began on July 7, 2006.\n    In two months we will then be embarking upon half a\n    decade of pending a Class 3 felony. Avery Binion, Jr.,\n    and Demarco [Scott] are well known in Elgin, both are\n    convicted felons. One would believe that the Elgin Po­\n    lice Department would know their whereabouts. They\n    were ordered to be in court today. The Court will is­\n    sue body writs for both of these gentlemen.\n       “In addition, the State’s list of witnesses indi­\n    cates twelve witnesses. Excluding Mr. Scott and Mr.\n    Binion, that’s ten witnesses. The Court would antici­\n    pate it would take every bit of today and most of to­\n    morrow to get through ten witnesses. By then the\n    People may have had a chance to execute the arrest\n    warrant body writs for these two gentlemen.\n       “The Court will deny the motion for continuance. I\n    will swear the jury in in 15, 20 minutes. Perhaps you\n    might want to send the police out to find these two\n    gentlemen.” Id., at 8–9.\n   After a brief recess, the court offered to delay the start\nof the trial for several more hours if the continuance would\n“be of any help” to the State. Id., at 9. But when the State\nmade clear that Binion and Scott’s “whereabouts” re­\nmained “unknown,” the court concluded that the delay\n“would be a further waste of time.” Id., at 10. The follow­\ning colloquy ensued:\n      “THE COURT: . . . . It’s a quarter to eleven and\n    [Binion and Scott] have not appeared on their own\n    will, so I’m going to bring the jury in now then to\n    swear them.\n      “[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Your Honor, may I ap­\n    proach briefly?\n      “THE COURT: Yes.\n4                   MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n       “[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, just so your Honor is\n    aware, I know that it’s the process to bring them in\n    and swear them in; however, the State will not be par­\n    ticipating in the trial. I wanted to let you know that.\n       “THE COURT: Very well. We’ll see how that\n    works.” Id., at 10–11.\n  The jury was then sworn. After instructing the jury, the\ncourt directed the State to proceed with its opening state­\nment. The prosecutor demurred: “Your Honor, respect­\nfully, the State is not participating in this case.” Id., at\n20. After the defense waived its opening statement, the\ncourt directed the State to call its first witness. Again, the\nprosecutor demurred: “Respectfully, your Honor, the State\nis not participating in this matter.” Ibid. The defense\nthen moved for a judgment of acquittal:\n      “[Defense Counsel]: Judge, the jury has been sworn.\n    The State has not presented any evidence. I believe\n    they’ve indicated their intention not to present any ev­\n    idence or witnesses.\n      “Based on that, Judge, I would ask the Court to\n    enter directed findings of not guilty to both counts, ag­\n    gravated battery and mob action.\n      “THE COURT: Do the People wish to reply?\n      “[The Prosecutor]: No, your Honor. Respectfully,\n    the State is not participating.\n      “THE COURT: The Court will grant the motion for\n    a directed finding and dismiss the charges.” Id., at 21.\n                            B\n   The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should\nhave granted a continuance. Martinez responded that the\nState’s appeal was improper because he had been acquit­\nted. The Illinois Appellate Court sided with the State,\nholding that jeopardy had never attached and that the\ntrial court had erred in failing to grant a continuance.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n2011 IL App (2d) 100498, ¶¶46, 53–56, 969 N. E. 2d 840,\n854, 856–858.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court granted review on the jeop­\nardy issue and affirmed. 2013 IL 113475, 990 N. E. 2d\n215. It began by recognizing that “[g]enerally, in cases of\na jury trial, jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled\nand sworn, as that is the point when the defendant is ‘ “put\nto trial before the trier of the facts.” ’ ” Id., ¶23, 990 N. E.\n2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377,\n394 (1975)). But it reasoned that under this Court’s prec­\nedents, “ ‘ “rigid, mechanical” rules’ ” should not govern the\ninquiry into whether jeopardy has attached. 2013 IL\n113475, ¶24, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra,\nat 390). Rather, it opined, the relevant question is whether\na defendant “was ‘ “subjected to the hazards of trial and\npossible conviction.” ’ ” 2013 IL 113475, ¶24, 990 N. E. 2d,\nat 222 (quoting Serfass, supra, at 391).\n   Here, the court concluded, Martinez “was never at risk\nof conviction”—and jeopardy therefore did not attach—\nbecause “[t]he State indicated it would not participate\nprior to the jury being sworn.” 2013 IL 113475, ¶39, 990\nN. E. 2d, at 224. And because Martinez “was not placed in\njeopardy,” the court held, the trial “court’s entry of di­\nrected verdicts of not guilty did not constitute true acquit­\ntals.” Id., ¶40, 990 N. E. 2d, at 225. Indeed, the court\nremarked, the trial court “repeatedly referred to its action\nas a ‘dismissal’ rather than an acquittal.” Ibid.\n   Justice Burke dissented, writing that the majority’s\nconclusion “that impaneling and swearing the jury had no\nlegal significance” ran “contrary to well-established prin­\nciples regarding double jeopardy.” Id., ¶57, 990 N. E. 2d,\nat 227. Moreover, she argued, its assertion that Martinez\nwas not in danger of conviction was “belied by the actions\nof the court and the prosecutor.” Id., ¶63, 990 N. E. 2d, at\n229. She explained that under the majority’s holding, the\nState could “unilaterally render a trial a ‘sham’ simply by\n6                   MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nrefusing to call witnesses after a jury has been selected.”\nId., ¶64, 990 N. E. 2d, at 229.\n                            II\n  This case presents two issues. First, did jeopardy attach\nto Martinez? Second, if so, did the proceeding end in such\na manner that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his retrial?\nOur precedents clearly dictate an affirmative answer\nto each question.\n                              A\n   There are few if any rules of criminal procedure clearer\nthan the rule that “jeopardy attaches when the jury is\nempaneled and sworn.” Crist, 437 U. S., at 35; see also\nUnited States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564,\n569 (1977); Serfass, supra, at 388; 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel,\nN. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §25.1(d) (3d ed.\n2007).\n   Our clearest exposition of this rule came in Crist, which\naddressed the constitutionality of a Montana statute\nproviding that jeopardy did not attach until the swearing\nof the first witness. As Crist explains, “the precise point at\nwhich jeopardy [attaches] in a jury trial might have been\nopen to argument before this Court’s decision in Downum\nv. United States, 372 U. S. 734 [(1963)],” in which “the\nCourt held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented a\nsecond prosecution of a defendant whose first trial had\nended just after the jury had been sworn and before any\ntestimony had been taken.” 437 U. S., at 35. But\nDownum put any such argument to rest: Its holding “nec­\nessarily pinpointed the stage in a jury trial when jeopardy\nattaches, and [it] has since been understood as explicit\nauthority for the proposition that jeopardy attaches when\nthe jury is empaneled and sworn.” Crist, supra, at 35.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court misread our precedents in\nsuggesting that the swearing of the jury is anything other\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthan a bright line at which jeopardy attaches. It relied on\nSerfass, understanding that case to mean “that in as­\nsessing whether and when jeopardy attaches, ‘ “rigid,\nmechanical” rules’ should not be applied.”           2013 IL\n113475, ¶24, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222. Under Serfass, the\ncourt reasoned, the relevant question is whether a defend­\nant was as a functional matter “ ‘ “subjected to the hazards\nof trial and possible conviction.” ’ ” 2013 IL 113475, ¶24,\n990 N. E. 2d, at 222.\n   But Serfass does not apply a functional approach to the\ndetermination of when jeopardy has attached. As to that\nquestion, it states the same bright-line rule as every other\ncase: Jeopardy attaches when “a defendant is ‘put to trial,’ ”\nand in a jury trial, that is “when a jury is empaneled\nand sworn.” 420 U. S., at 388. Indeed, Serfass explicitly\nrejects a functional approach to the question whether\njeopardy has attached. See id., at 390 (refuting the de­\nfendant’s argument that “ ‘constructiv[e] jeopardy had\nattached’ ” upon the pretrial grant of a motion to dismiss\nthe indictment, which the defendant characterized as “the\n‘functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits’ ”). The\nSerfass Court acknowledged “that we have disparaged\n‘rigid, mechanical’ rules in the interpretation of the Double\nJeopardy Clause.” Ibid. But it was referring to the case of\nIllinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S. 458 (1973), in which we\ndeclined to apply “rigid, mechanical” reasoning in answer­\ning a very different question: not whether jeopardy had\nattached, but whether the manner in which it terminated\n(by mistrial) barred the defendant’s retrial. Id., at 467.\nBy contrast, Serfass explains, the rule that jeopardy at­\ntaches at the start of a trial is “by no means a mere tech­\nnicality, nor is it a ‘rigid, mechanical’ rule.” 420 U. S., at\n391. And contrary to the Illinois Supreme Court’s inter­\npretation, Serfass creates not the slightest doubt about\nwhen a “trial” begins.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court’s error was consequential,\n8                      MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nfor it introduced confusion into what we have consistently\ntreated as a bright-line rule: A jury trial begins, and jeop­\nardy attaches, when the jury is sworn. We have never\nsuggested the exception perceived by the Illinois Supreme\nCourt—that jeopardy may not have attached where, under\nthe circumstances of a particular case, the defendant was\nnot genuinely at risk of conviction.3 Martinez was subjected\nto jeopardy because the jury in his case was sworn.\n                               B\n   “ ‘[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has attached,’ ” how­\never, “ ‘begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.’ ” Id., at 390.\nThe remaining question is whether the jeopardy ended in\nsuch a manner that the defendant may not be retried. See\n6 LaFave §25.1(g) (surveying circumstances in which\nretrial is and is not allowed). Here, there is no doubt that\nMartinez’s jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his\nretrial: The trial court acquitted him of the charged of­\nfenses. “Perhaps the most fundamental rule in the history\nof double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that ‘[a] verdict\nof acquittal . . . could not be reviewed . . . without putting\n[a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the\nConstitution.’ ” Martin Linen, supra, at 571.\n   “[O]ur cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any\nruling that the prosecution’s proof is insufficient to estab­\nlish criminal liability for an offense.” Evans v. Michigan,\n568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4–5). And the trial\n——————\n  3 Some commentators have suggested that there may be limited ex­\n\nceptions to this rule—e.g., where the trial court lacks jurisdiction or\nwhere a defendant obtains an acquittal by fraud or corruption. See 6\nW. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §25.1(d)\n(3d ed. 2007). The scope of any such exceptions is not presented here.\nNor need we reach a situation where the prosecutor had no opportunity\nto dismiss the charges to avoid the consequences of empaneling the\njury. Cf. People v. Deems, 81 Ill. 2d 384, 387–389, 410 N. E. 2d 8, 10–11\n(1980).\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\ncourt clearly made such a ruling here. After the State\ndeclined to present evidence against Martinez, his counsel\nmoved for “directed findings of not guilty to both counts,”\nand the court “grant[ed] the motion for a directed finding.”\nTr. 21. That is a textbook acquittal: a finding that the\nState’s evidence cannot support a conviction.\n   The Illinois Supreme Court thought otherwise. It first\nopined that “[b]ecause [Martinez] was not placed in jeop­\nardy, the [trial] court’s entry of directed verdicts of not\nguilty did not constitute true acquittals.” 2013 IL 113475,\n¶40, 990 N. E. 2d, at 225. But the premise of that argu­\nment is incorrect: Martinez was in jeopardy, for the rea­\nsons given above. The court went on to “note that, in\ndirecting findings of not guilty,” the trial court “referred to\nits action as a ‘dismissal’ rather than an acquittal.” Ibid.\nUnder our precedents, however, that is immaterial: “[W]e\nhave emphasized that what constitutes an ‘acquittal’ is\nnot to be controlled by the form of the judge’s action”; it\nturns on “whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its\nlabel, actually represents a resolution . . . of some or all of\nthe factual elements of the offense charged.” Martin\nLinen, 430 U. S., at 571; see also Evans, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 11) (“Our decision turns not on the form of the trial\ncourt’s action, but rather whether it ‘serve[s]’ substantive\n‘purposes’ or procedural ones”); United States v. Scott, 437\nU. S. 82, 96 (1978) (“We have previously noted that ‘the\ntrial judge’s characterization of his own action cannot\ncontrol the classification of the action’ ”).\n   Here, as in Evans and Martin Linen, the trial court’s\naction was an acquittal because the court “acted on its\nview that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.”\nEvans, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11); see Martin Linen,\nsupra, at 572 (“[T]he District Court in this case evaluated\nthe Government’s evidence and determined that it was\nlegally insufficient to sustain a conviction”). And because\n10                      MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nMartinez was acquitted, the State cannot retry him.4\n                                III\n   The functional rule adopted by the Illinois Supreme\nCourt is not necessary to avoid unfairness to prosecutors\nor to the public. On the day of trial, the court was acutely\naware of the significance of swearing a jury. It repeatedly\ndelayed that act to give the State additional time to find\nits witnesses. It had previously granted the State a num­\nber of continuances for the same purpose. See supra, at 2.\nAnd, critically, the court told the State on the day of trial\nthat it could “move to dismiss [its] case” before the jury\nwas sworn. Tr. 3. Had the State accepted that invitation,\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred it from\nrecharging Martinez. Instead, the State participated in\nthe selection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before\nthe jury was sworn. When the State declined to dismiss\nits case, it “ ‘took a chance[,] . . . enter[ing] upon the trial of\nthe case without sufficient evidence to convict.’ ” Downum\nv. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 737 (1963). Here, the\nState knew, or should have known, that an acquittal\nforever bars the retrial of the defendant when it occurs\nafter jeopardy has attached. The Illinois Supreme Court’s\nholding is understandable, given the significant conse­\nquence of the State’s mistake, but it runs directly counter\nto our precedents and to the protection conferred by the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\n\n——————\n  4 Indeed, even if the trial court had chosen to dismiss the case or de­\n\nclare a mistrial rather than granting Martinez’s motion for a directed\nverdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause probably would still bar his retrial.\nWe confronted precisely this scenario in Downum v. United States, 372\nU. S. 734 (1963), holding that once jeopardy has attached, the absence\nof witnesses generally does not constitute the kind of “ ‘extraordinary\nand striking circumstanc[e]’ ” in which a trial court may exercise\n“discretion to discharge the jury before it has reached a verdict.” Id., at\n736; see also Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 508, n. 24 (1978).\n                  Cite as: 572 U.
