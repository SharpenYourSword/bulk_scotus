Argued April 30, 2014\u2014Decided June 2, 2014\nAkamai Technologies, Inc., a respondent here, is the exclusive licensee\n of a patent that claims a method of delivering electronic data using a\n content delivery network (CDN). Petitioner, Limelight Networks,\n Inc., also operates a CDN and carries out several of the steps claimed\n in the patent, but its customers, rather than Limelight itself, perform\n a step of the patent known as \u201ctagging.\u201d Under Federal Circuit case\n law, liability for direct infringement under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(a) re-\n quires performance of all steps of a method patent to be attributable\n to a single party. This position was most recently refined in Mu-\n niauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F. 3d 1318. The District Court\n concluded that Limelight could not have directly infringed the patent\n at issue because performance of the tagging step could not be at-\n tributed to it. The en banc Federal Circuit reversed, holding that a\n defendant who performed some steps of a method patent and encour-\n aged others to perform the rest could be liable for inducement of in-\n fringement even if no one was liable for direct infringement. The en\n banc court concluded that the evidence could support liability for\n Limelight on an inducement theory and remanded for further pro-\n ceedings.\nHeld: A defendant is not liable for inducing infringement under \u00a7271(b)\n when no one has directly infringed under \u00a7271(a) or any other statu-\n tory provision.

The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary view would deprive\n    \u00a7271(b) of ascertainable standards and require the courts to develop\n    two parallel bodies of infringement law. This Court\u2019s reading of\n    \u00a7271(b) is reinforced by \u00a7271(f)(1), which illustrates that Congress\n    knows how to impose inducement liability predicated on non-\n    infringing conduct when it wishes to do so. The notion that conduct\n    which would be infringing in altered circumstances can form the ba-\n    sis for contributory infringement has been rejected, see Deepsouth\n    Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U. S. 518, 526\u2013527, and there is no\n    reason to apply a different rule for inducement. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Respondents claim that principles from tort law and criminal\n    aiding and abetting doctrine, as well as patent law principles in ex-\n    istence before the 1952 Patent Act, support the Federal Circuit\u2019s\n    reading of the statute, but their arguments are unpersuasive.\n    Though a would-be infringer could evade liability by dividing perfor-\n    mance of a method patent\u2019s steps with another whose conduct cannot\n    be attributed to the defendant, this is merely a result of the Federal\n    Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7271(a), and a desire to avoid this conse-\n    quence does not justify fundamentally altering the rules of induce-\n    ment liability clearly required by the Patent Act\u2019s text and structure.\n    Pp. 8\u201310.\n       (c) Because the question presented here is clearly focused on\n    \u00a7271(b) and presupposes that Limelight has not committed direct in-\n    fringement under \u00a7271(a), the Court declines to address whether the\n    Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in Muniauction is correct.

S. C. \u00a7271(b) when no one has directly infringed the\npatent under \u00a7271(a) or any other statutory provision.\nThe statutory text and structure and our prior case law\nrequire that we answer this question in the negative. We\naccordingly reverse the Federal Circuit, which reached the\nopposite conclusion.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Respondent the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nis the assignee of U. S. Patent No. 6,108,703 (\u2019703 patent),\nwhich claims a method of delivering electronic data using\na \u201ccontent delivery network,\u201d or \u201cCDN.\u201d Respondent\nAkamai Technologies, Inc., is the exclusive licensee.\nAkamai maintains many servers distributed in various\nlocations. Proprietors of Web sites, known as \u201ccontent\nproviders,\u201d contract with Akamai to deliver their Web\nsites\u2019 content to individual Internet users. The \u2019703 patent\nprovides for the designation of certain components of a\n2            LIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC. v. AKAMAI\n                    TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncontent provider\u2019s Web site (often large files, such as video\nor music files) to be stored on Akamai\u2019s servers and ac-\ncessed from those servers by Internet users. The process\nof designating components to be stored on Akamai\u2019s serv-\ners is known as \u201ctagging.\u201d By \u201caggregat[ing] the data\ndemands of multiple content providers with differing peak\nusage patterns and serv[ing] that content from multiple\nservers in multiple locations,\u201d 614 F. Supp. 2d 90, 96\n(Mass. 2009), as well as by delivering content from servers\nlocated in the same geographic area as the users who are\nattempting to access it, Akamai is able to increase the\nspeed with which Internet users access the content of its\ncustomers\u2019 Web sites.\n  Petitioner Limelight Networks, Inc., also operates a\nCDN and carries out several of the steps claimed in the\n\u2019703 patent. But instead of tagging those components of its\ncustomers\u2019 Web sites that it intends to store on its servers\n(a step included in the \u2019703 patent), Limelight requires its\ncustomers to do their own tagging.1 Respondents claim\nthat Limelight \u201cprovides instructions and offers technical\nassistance\u201d to its customers regarding how to tag, 629\nF. 3d 1311, 1321 (CA Fed. 2010), but the record is undis-\nputed that Limelight does not tag the components to be\nstored on its servers.\n                           B\n  In 2006, respondents sued Limelight in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts,\nclaiming patent infringement. The case was tried to a\njury, which found that Limelight had committed infringe-\nment and awarded more than $40 million in damages.\n  Respondents\u2019 victory was short-lived, however. After\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 In\n      its brief, Limelight disputes whether its customers actually \u201ctag\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the patent. Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 4. We\nassume arguendo that Limelight\u2019s customers do in fact \u201ctag\u201d within the\npatent\u2019s meaning.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe jury returned its verdict, the Federal Circuit decided\nMuniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F. 3d 1318\n(2008). In that case the Court of Appeals rejected a claim\nthat the defendant\u2019s method, involving bidding on finan-\ncial instruments using a computer system, directly in-\nfringed the plaintiff \u2019s patent. The defendant performed\nsome of the steps of the patented method, and its custom-\ners, to whom the defendant gave access to its system along\nwith instructions on the use of the system, performed the\nremaining steps. The court started from \u201cthe proposition\nthat direct infringement requires a single party to perform\nevery step of a claimed method.\u201d Id., at 1329. This re-\nquirement is satisfied even though the steps are actually\nundertaken by multiple parties, the court explained, if a\nsingle defendant \u201cexercises \u2018control or direction\u2019 over the\nentire process such that every step is attributable to the\ncontrolling party.\u201d Ibid. The court held that the defend-\nant in Muniauction was not liable for direct infringement\nbecause it did not exercise control or direction over its\ncustomers\u2019 performance of those steps of the patent that\nthe defendant itself did not perform. Id., at 1330.\n   In light of Muniauction, Limelight moved for reconsid-\neration of its earlier motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw, which the District Court had denied. The District\nCourt granted the motion, concluding that Muniauction\nprecluded a finding of direct infringement under \u00a7271(a)\nbecause infringement of the \u2019703 patent required tagging\nand Limelight does not control or direct its customers\u2019\ntagging. A panel of the Federal Circuit affirmed, explain-\ning that a defendant that does not itself undertake all of a\npatent\u2019s steps can be liable for direct infringement only\n\u201cwhen there is an agency relationship between the parties\nwho perform the method steps or when one party is con-\ntractually obligated to the other to perform the steps.\u201d 629\nF. 3d, at 1320. Since neither of these conditions was met\nin the present case, the Federal Circuit panel held that\n4            LIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC. v. AKAMAI\n                    TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nLimelight could not be held liable for direct infringement.2\nIbid.\n   The Federal Circuit granted en banc review and re-\nversed. The en banc court found it unnecessary to revisit\nits \u00a7271(a) direct infringement case law. Instead, it con-\ncluded that the \u201cevidence could support a judgment in\n[respondents\u2019] favor on a theory of induced infringement\u201d\nunder \u00a7271(b). 692 F. 3d 1301, 1319 (2012) (per curiam).\nThis was true, the court explained, because \u00a7271(b) liabil-\nity arises when a defendant carries out some steps consti-\ntuting a method patent and encourages others to carry out\nthe remaining steps\u2014even if no one would be liable as a\ndirect infringer in such circumstances, because those who\nperformed the remaining steps did not act as agents of, or\nunder the direction or control of, the defendant. The\nCourt of Appeals did not dispute that \u201cthere can be no\nindirect infringement without direct infringement,\u201d id., at\n1308, but it explained that \u201c[r]equiring proof that there\nhas been direct infringement . . . is not the same as requir-\ning proof that a single party would be liable as a direct\ninfringer,\u201d id., at 1308\u20131309 (emphasis deleted). Judge\nNewman and Judge Linn both dissented (with the latter\njoined by Judges Dyk, Prost, and O\u2019Malley).\n   Limelight sought certiorari, which we granted. 571\nU. S. ___ (2014).\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n   Neither the Federal Circuit, see 692 F. 3d, at 1308, nor\nrespondents, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 44, dispute the proposi-\ntion that liability for inducement must be predicated on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The panel noted that Limelight\u2019s contracts instruct its customers to\n\ntag the components they wish to be stored on Limelight\u2019s CDN, but\nconcluded that, because these contracts did not give Limelight control\nover its customers, the customers\u2019 tagging could not be attributed to\nLimelight. See 629 F. 3d, at 1321.\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ndirect infringement. This is for good reason, as our case\nlaw leaves no doubt that inducement liability may arise\n\u201cif, but only if, [there is] . . . direct infringement.\u201d Aro Mfg.\nCo. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U. S 336, 341\n(1961) (emphasis deleted).3\n   One might think that this simple truth is enough to\ndispose of this appeal. But the Federal Circuit reasoned\nthat a defendant can be liable for inducing infringement\nunder \u00a7271(b) even if no one has committed direct in-\nfringement within the terms of \u00a7271(a) (or any other pro-\nvision of the patent laws), because direct infringement can\nexist independently of a violation of these statutory provi-\nsions. See 692 F. 3d, at 1314.\n   The Federal Circuit\u2019s analysis fundamentally misunder-\nstands what it means to infringe a method patent. A\nmethod patent claims a number of steps; under this\nCourt\u2019s case law, the patent is not infringed unless all the\nsteps are carried out. See, e.g., Aro, supra, at 344 (a \u201cpat-\nent covers only the totality of the elements in the claim\nand . . . no element, separately viewed, is within the\ngrant\u201d). This principle follows ineluctably from what a\npatent is: the conferral of rights in a particular claimed set\nof elements. \u201cEach element contained in a patent claim is\ndeemed material to defining the scope of the patented\ninvention,\u201d Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemi-\ncal Co., 520 U. S. 17, 29 (1997), and a patentee\u2019s rights\nextend only to the claimed combination of elements, and\nno further.\n   The Federal Circuit held in Muniauction that a meth-\nod\u2019s steps have not all been performed as claimed by the\npatent unless they are all attributable to the same de-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Aro addressed contributory infringement under \u00a7271(c), rather than\n\ninducement of infringement under \u00a7271(b), but we see no basis to\ndistinguish for these purposes between the two, which after all spring\nfrom common stock. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8).\n6          LIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC. v. AKAMAI\n                  TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nfendant, either because the defendant actually performed\nthose steps or because he directed or controlled others who\nperformed them. See 532 F. 3d, at 1329\u20131330. Assuming\nwithout deciding that the Federal Circuit\u2019s holding in\nMuniauction is correct, there has simply been no in-\nfringement of the method in which respondents have\nstaked out an interest, because the performance of all the\npatent\u2019s steps is not attributable to any one person. And,\nas both the Federal Circuit and respondents admit, where\nthere has been no direct infringement, there can be no\ninducement of infringement under \u00a7271(b).\n   The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary view would deprive\n\u00a7271(b) of ascertainable standards. If a defendant can be\nheld liable under \u00a7271(b) for inducing conduct that does\nnot constitute infringement, then how can a court assess\nwhen a patent holder\u2019s rights have been invaded? What if\na defendant pays another to perform just one step of a 12-\nstep process, and no one performs the other steps, but that\none step can be viewed as the most important step in the\nprocess? In that case the defendant has not encouraged\ninfringement, but no principled reason prevents him from\nbeing held liable for inducement under the Federal Cir-\ncuit\u2019s reasoning, which permits inducement liability when\nfewer than all of a method\u2019s steps have been performed\nwithin the meaning of the patent. The decision below\nwould require the courts to develop two parallel bodies of\ninfringement law: one for liability for direct infringement,\nand one for liability for inducement.\n   Section 271(f)(1) reinforces our reading of \u00a7271(b). That\nsubsection imposes liability on a party who \u201csupplies or\ncauses to be supplied in or from the United States all or a\nsubstantial portion of the components of a patented inven-\ntion . . . in such manner as to actively induce the combina-\ntion of such components outside of the United States in a\nmanner that would infringe the patent if such combination\noccurred within the United States\u201d (emphasis added). As\n                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)               7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthis provision illustrates, when Congress wishes to impose\nliability for inducing activity that does not itself constitute\ndirect infringement, it knows precisely how to do so. The\ncourts should not create liability for inducement of non-\ninfringing conduct where Congress has elected not to\nextend that concept.\n   The Federal Circuit seems to have adopted the view that\nLimelight induced infringement on the theory that the\nsteps that Limelight and its customers perform would\ninfringe the \u2019703 patent if all the steps were performed by\nthe same person. But we have already rejected the notion\nthat conduct which would be infringing in altered circum-\nstances can form the basis for contributory infringement,\nand we see no reason to apply a different rule for induce-\nment. In Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406\nU. S. 518 (1972), a manufacturer produced components of\na patented machine and then exported those components\noverseas to be assembled by its foreign customers.4 (The\nassembly by the foreign customers did not violate U. S.\npatent laws.) In both Deepsouth and this case, the conduct\nthat the defendant induced or contributed to would have\nbeen infringing if committed in altered circumstances: in\nDeepsouth if the machines had been assembled in the\nUnited States, see id., at 526, and in this case if perfor-\nmance of all of the claimed steps had been attributable to\nthe same person. In Deepsouth, we rejected the possibility\nof contributory infringement because the machines had\nnot been assembled in the United States, and direct in-\nfringement had consequently never occurred. See id., at\n526\u2013527. Similarly, in this case, performance of all the\nclaimed steps cannot be attributed to a single person, so\ndirect infringement never occurred. Limelight cannot be\nliable for inducing infringement that never came to pass.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 Section 271(f) now prohibits the exporter\u2019s conduct at issue in\n\nDeepsouth.\n8          LIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC. v. AKAMAI\n                  TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n  Respondents\u2019 arguments in support of the Federal Cir-\ncuit\u2019s reading of the statute are unpersuasive. First,\nrespondents note that tort law imposes liability on a de-\nfendant who harms another through a third party, even if\nthat third party would not himself be liable, and respond-\nents contend that, given the background tort principles\nagainst which the Patent Act of 1952 was enacted, it\nshould not matter that no one is liable for direct infringe-\nment in this case. But the reason Limelight could not\nhave induced infringement under \u00a7271(b) is not that no\nthird party is liable for direct infringement; the problem,\ninstead, is that no direct infringement was committed.\nMuniauction (which, again, we assume to be correct)\ninstructs that a method patent is not directly infringed\u2014\nand the patentee\u2019s interest is thus not violated\u2014unless a\nsingle actor can be held responsible for the performance of\nall steps of the patent. Because Limelight did not under-\ntake all steps of the \u2019703 patent and cannot otherwise be\nheld responsible for all those steps, respondents\u2019 rights\nhave not been violated. Unsurprisingly, respondents point\nus to no tort case in which liability was imposed because a\ndefendant caused an innocent third party to undertake\naction that did not violate the plaintiff \u2019s legal rights.\n  In a related argument, respondents contend that, at\ntort, liability sometimes attaches where two or more de-\nfendants inflict injury, even if each defendant\u2019s conduct,\nstanding alone, would not be actionable. See W. Keeton,\nD. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.

C. \u00a72, and\nthey argue that two parties who divide all the necessary\nelements of a crime between them are both guilty under\n\u00a72. The analogy does not hold up. The aiding and abet-\nting statute must be read \u201cagainst its common-law back-\nground,\u201d Standefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10, 19\n(1980), and at common law two or more defendants, each\nof whom committed an element of a crime, were liable as\nprincipals. See, e.g., 1 J. Bishop, Commentaries on the\nCriminal Law \u00a7649, p. 392 (7th ed. 1882). While we have\ndrawn on criminal law concepts in the past in interpreting\n\u00a7271(b), see Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10\u201312), we think it un-\nlikely that Congress had this particular doctrine in mind\nwhen it enacted the Patent Act of 1952, given the doc-\ntrine\u2019s inconsistency with the Act\u2019s cornerstone principle\nthat patentees have a right only to the set of elements\nclaimed in their patents and nothing further.\n   Third, respondents contend that patent law principles\nestablished before the enactment of the Patent Act demon-\nstrate that a defendant that performs some steps of a\npatent with the purpose of having its customers perform\nthe remaining steps is liable for inducing infringement.\nBut here, too, the nature of the rights created by the Pat-\nent Act defeats the notion that Congress could have\nintended to permit inducement liability where there is no\nunderlying direct infringement. According to respondents,\ntheir understanding of the pre-1952 doctrine casts doubt\non the Muniauction rule for direct infringement under\n\u00a7271(a), on the ground that that rule has the indirect\neffect of preventing inducement liability where Congress\nwould have wanted it. But the possibility that the Federal\nCircuit erred by too narrowly circumscribing the scope of\n\u00a7271(a) is no reason for this Court to err a second time by\nmisconstruing \u00a7271(b) to impose liability for inducing\n10         LIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC. v.

We acknowledge this concern.\nAny such anomaly, however, would result from the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7271(a) in Muniauction. A\ndesire to avoid Muniauction\u2019s natural consequences does\nnot justify fundamentally altering the rules of inducement\nliability that the text and structure of the Patent Act\nclearly require\u2014an alteration that would result in its own\nserious and problematic consequences, namely, creating\nfor \u00a7271(b) purposes some free-floating concept of \u201cin-\nfringement\u201d both untethered to the statutory text and\ndifficult for the lower courts to apply consistently.\n                             III\n  Respondents ask us to review the merits of the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s Muniauction rule for direct infringement under\n\u00a7271(a). We decline to do so today.\n  In the first place, the question presented is clearly\nfocused on \u00a7271(b), not \u00a7271(a). We granted certiorari on\nthe following question: \u201cWhether the Federal Circuit erred\nin holding that a defendant may be held liable for inducing\npatent infringement under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(b) even though\nno one has committed direct infringement under \u00a7271(a).\u201d\nPet. for Cert. i. The question presupposes that Limelight\nhas not committed direct infringement under \u00a7271(a).\nAnd since the question on which we granted certiorari did\nnot involve \u00a7271(a), petitioner did not address that im-\nportant issue in its opening brief. Our decision on the\n\u00a7271(b) question necessitates a remand to the Federal\nCircuit, and on remand, the Federal Circuit will have the\nopportunity to revisit the \u00a7271(a) question if it so chooses.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Argued April 30, 2014\u2014Decided June 2, 2014\nAkamai Technologies, Inc., a respondent here, is the exclusive licensee\n of a patent that claims a method of delivering electronic data using a\n content delivery network (CDN). Petitioner, Limelight Networks,\n Inc., also operates a CDN and carries out several of the steps claimed\n in the patent, but its customers, rather than Limelight itself, perform\n a step of the patent known as \u201ctagging.\u201d Under Federal Circuit case\n law, liability for direct infringement under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(a) re-\n quires performance of all steps of a method patent to be attributable\n to a single party. This position was most recently refined in Mu-\n niauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F. 3d 1318. The District Court\n concluded that Limelight could not have directly infringed the patent\n at issue because performance of the tagging step could not be at-\n tributed to it. The en banc Federal Circuit reversed, holding that a\n defendant who performed some steps of a method patent and encour-\n aged others to perform the rest could be liable for inducement of in-\n fringement even if no one was liable for direct infringement. The en\n banc court concluded that the evidence could support liability for\n Limelight on an inducement theory and remanded for further pro-\n ceedings.\nHeld: A defendant is not liable for inducing infringement under \u00a7271(b)\n when no one has directly infringed under \u00a7271(a) or any other statu-\n tory provision.

The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary view would deprive\n    \u00a7271(b) of ascertainable standards and require the courts to develop\n    two parallel bodies of infringement law. This Court\u2019s reading of\n    \u00a7271(b) is reinforced by \u00a7271(f)(1), which illustrates that Congress\n    knows how to impose inducement liability predicated on non-\n    infringing conduct when it wishes to do so. The notion that conduct\n    which would be infringing in altered circumstances can form the ba-\n    sis for contributory infringement has been rejected, see Deepsouth\n    Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U. S. 518, 526\u2013527, and there is no\n    reason to apply a different rule for inducement. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Respondents claim that principles from tort law and criminal\n    aiding and abetting doctrine, as well as patent law principles in ex-\n    istence before the 1952 Patent Act, support the Federal Circuit\u2019s\n    reading of the statute, but their arguments are unpersuasive.\n    Though a would-be infringer could evade liability by dividing perfor-\n    mance of a method patent\u2019s steps with another whose conduct cannot\n    be attributed to the defendant, this is merely a result of the Federal\n    Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7271(a), and a desire to avoid this conse-\n    quence does not justify fundamentally altering the rules of induce-\n    ment liability clearly required by the Patent Act\u2019s text and structure.\n    Pp. 8\u201310.\n       (c) Because the question presented here is clearly focused on\n    \u00a7271(b) and presupposes that Limelight has not committed direct in-\n    fringement under \u00a7271(a), the Court declines to address whether the\n    Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in Muniauction is correct.

But instead of tagging those components of its\ncustomers\u2019 Web sites that it intends to store on its servers\n(a step included in the \u2019703 patent), Limelight requires its\ncustomers to do their own tagging.1 Respondents claim\nthat Limelight \u201cprovides instructions and offers technical\nassistance\u201d to its customers regarding how to tag, 629\nF. 3d 1311, 1321 (CA Fed. 2010), but the record is undis-\nputed that Limelight does not tag the components to be\nstored on its servers.\n                           B\n  In 2006, respondents sued Limelight in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts,\nclaiming patent infringement.

S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe jury returned its verdict, the Federal Circuit decided\nMuniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F. 3d 1318\n(2008). In that case the Court of Appeals rejected a claim\nthat the defendant\u2019s method, involving bidding on finan-\ncial instruments using a computer system, directly in-\nfringed the plaintiff \u2019s patent. The defendant performed\nsome of the steps of the patented method, and its custom-\ners, to whom the defendant gave access to its system along\nwith instructions on the use of the system, performed the\nremaining steps. The court started from \u201cthe proposition\nthat direct infringement requires a single party to perform\nevery step of a claimed method.\u201d Id., at 1329. This re-\nquirement is satisfied even though the steps are actually\nundertaken by multiple parties, the court explained, if a\nsingle defendant \u201cexercises \u2018control or direction\u2019 over the\nentire process such that every step is attributable to the\ncontrolling party.\u201d Ibid. The court held that the defend-\nant in Muniauction was not liable for direct infringement\nbecause it did not exercise control or direction over its\ncustomers\u2019 performance of those steps of the patent that\nthe defendant itself did not perform. Id., at 1330.\n   In light of Muniauction, Limelight moved for reconsid-\neration of its earlier motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw, which the District Court had denied. The District\nCourt granted the motion, concluding that Muniauction\nprecluded a finding of direct infringement under \u00a7271(a)\nbecause infringement of the \u2019703 patent required tagging\nand Limelight does not control or direct its customers\u2019\ntagging. A panel of the Federal Circuit affirmed, explain-\ning that a defendant that does not itself undertake all of a\npatent\u2019s steps can be liable for direct infringement only\n\u201cwhen there is an agency relationship between the parties\nwho perform the method steps or when one party is con-\ntractually obligated to the other to perform the steps.\u201d 629\nF. 3d, at 1320. Since neither of these conditions was met\nin the present case, the Federal Circuit panel held that\n4            LIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC. v. AKAMAI\n                    TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nLimelight could not be held liable for direct infringement.2\nIbid.\n   The Federal Circuit granted en banc review and re-\nversed. The en banc court found it unnecessary to revisit\nits \u00a7271(a) direct infringement case law. Instead, it con-\ncluded that the \u201cevidence could support a judgment in\n[respondents\u2019] favor on a theory of induced infringement\u201d\nunder \u00a7271(b). 692 F. 3d 1301, 1319 (2012) (per curiam).\nThis was true, the court explained, because \u00a7271(b) liabil-\nity arises when a defendant carries out some steps consti-\ntuting a method patent and encourages others to carry out\nthe remaining steps\u2014even if no one would be liable as a\ndirect infringer in such circumstances, because those who\nperformed the remaining steps did not act as agents of, or\nunder the direction or control of, the defendant. The\nCourt of Appeals did not dispute that \u201cthere can be no\nindirect infringement without direct infringement,\u201d id., at\n1308, but it explained that \u201c[r]equiring proof that there\nhas been direct infringement . . . is not the same as requir-\ning proof that a single party would be liable as a direct\ninfringer,\u201d id., at 1308\u20131309 (emphasis deleted).

This is for good reason, as our case\nlaw leaves no doubt that inducement liability may arise\n\u201cif, but only if, [there is] . . . direct infringement.\u201d Aro Mfg.\nCo. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U. S 336, 341\n(1961) (emphasis deleted).3\n   One might think that this simple truth is enough to\ndispose of this appeal. But the Federal Circuit reasoned\nthat a defendant can be liable for inducing infringement\nunder \u00a7271(b) even if no one has committed direct in-\nfringement within the terms of \u00a7271(a) (or any other pro-\nvision of the patent laws), because direct infringement can\nexist independently of a violation of these statutory provi-\nsions. See 692 F. 3d, at 1314.\n   The Federal Circuit\u2019s analysis fundamentally misunder-\nstands what it means to infringe a method patent. A\nmethod patent claims a number of steps; under this\nCourt\u2019s case law, the patent is not infringed unless all the\nsteps are carried out. See, e.g., Aro, supra, at 344 (a \u201cpat-\nent covers only the totality of the elements in the claim\nand . . . no element, separately viewed, is within the\ngrant\u201d). This principle follows ineluctably from what a\npatent is: the conferral of rights in a particular claimed set\nof elements. \u201cEach element contained in a patent claim is\ndeemed material to defining the scope of the patented\ninvention,\u201d Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemi-\ncal Co., 520 U. S. 17, 29 (1997), and a patentee\u2019s rights\nextend only to the claimed combination of elements, and\nno further.\n   The Federal Circuit held in Muniauction that a meth-\nod\u2019s steps have not all been performed as claimed by the\npatent unless they are all attributable to the same de-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Aro addressed contributory infringement under \u00a7271(c), rather than\n\ninducement of infringement under \u00a7271(b), but we see no basis to\ndistinguish for these purposes between the two, which after all spring\nfrom common stock. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8).\n6          LIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC. v. AKAMAI\n                  TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nfendant, either because the defendant actually performed\nthose steps or because he directed or controlled others who\nperformed them. See 532 F. 3d, at 1329\u20131330. Assuming\nwithout deciding that the Federal Circuit\u2019s holding in\nMuniauction is correct, there has simply been no in-\nfringement of the method in which respondents have\nstaked out an interest, because the performance of all the\npatent\u2019s steps is not attributable to any one person. And,\nas both the Federal Circuit and respondents admit, where\nthere has been no direct infringement, there can be no\ninducement of infringement under \u00a7271(b).\n   The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary view would deprive\n\u00a7271(b) of ascertainable standards. If a defendant can be\nheld liable under \u00a7271(b) for inducing conduct that does\nnot constitute infringement, then how can a court assess\nwhen a patent holder\u2019s rights have been invaded? What if\na defendant pays another to perform just one step of a 12-\nstep process, and no one performs the other steps, but that\none step can be viewed as the most important step in the\nprocess? In that case the defendant has not encouraged\ninfringement, but no principled reason prevents him from\nbeing held liable for inducement under the Federal Cir-\ncuit\u2019s reasoning, which permits inducement liability when\nfewer than all of a method\u2019s steps have been performed\nwithin the meaning of the patent. The decision below\nwould require the courts to develop two parallel bodies of\ninfringement law: one for liability for direct infringement,\nand one for liability for inducement.\n   Section 271(f)(1) reinforces our reading of \u00a7271(b). That\nsubsection imposes liability on a party who \u201csupplies or\ncauses to be supplied in or from the United States all or a\nsubstantial portion of the components of a patented inven-\ntion . . . in such manner as to actively induce the combina-\ntion of such components outside of the United States in a\nmanner that would infringe the patent if such combination\noccurred within the United States\u201d (emphasis added).

S. ____ (2014)               7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthis provision illustrates, when Congress wishes to impose\nliability for inducing activity that does not itself constitute\ndirect infringement, it knows precisely how to do so. The\ncourts should not create liability for inducement of non-\ninfringing conduct where Congress has elected not to\nextend that concept.\n   The Federal Circuit seems to have adopted the view that\nLimelight induced infringement on the theory that the\nsteps that Limelight and its customers perform would\ninfringe the \u2019703 patent if all the steps were performed by\nthe same person. But we have already rejected the notion\nthat conduct which would be infringing in altered circum-\nstances can form the basis for contributory infringement,\nand we see no reason to apply a different rule for induce-\nment. In Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406\nU. S. 518 (1972), a manufacturer produced components of\na patented machine and then exported those components\noverseas to be assembled by its foreign customers.4 (The\nassembly by the foreign customers did not violate U. S.\npatent laws.) In both Deepsouth and this case, the conduct\nthat the defendant induced or contributed to would have\nbeen infringing if committed in altered circumstances: in\nDeepsouth if the machines had been assembled in the\nUnited States, see id., at 526, and in this case if perfor-\nmance of all of the claimed steps had been attributable to\nthe same person. In Deepsouth, we rejected the possibility\nof contributory infringement because the machines had\nnot been assembled in the United States, and direct in-\nfringement had consequently never occurred. See id., at\n526\u2013527. Similarly, in this case, performance of all the\nclaimed steps cannot be attributed to a single person, so\ndirect infringement never occurred. Limelight cannot be\nliable for inducing infringement that never came to pass.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 Section 271(f) now prohibits the exporter\u2019s conduct at issue in\n\nDeepsouth.\n8          LIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC. v. AKAMAI\n                  TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n  Respondents\u2019 arguments in support of the Federal Cir-\ncuit\u2019s reading of the statute are unpersuasive. First,\nrespondents note that tort law imposes liability on a de-\nfendant who harms another through a third party, even if\nthat third party would not himself be liable, and respond-\nents contend that, given the background tort principles\nagainst which the Patent Act of 1952 was enacted, it\nshould not matter that no one is liable for direct infringe-\nment in this case. But the reason Limelight could not\nhave induced infringement under \u00a7271(b) is not that no\nthird party is liable for direct infringement; the problem,\ninstead, is that no direct infringement was committed.\nMuniauction (which, again, we assume to be correct)\ninstructs that a method patent is not directly infringed\u2014\nand the patentee\u2019s interest is thus not violated\u2014unless a\nsingle actor can be held responsible for the performance of\nall steps of the patent. Because Limelight did not under-\ntake all steps of the \u2019703 patent and cannot otherwise be\nheld responsible for all those steps, respondents\u2019 rights\nhave not been violated. Unsurprisingly, respondents point\nus to no tort case in which liability was imposed because a\ndefendant caused an innocent third party to undertake\naction that did not violate the plaintiff \u2019s legal rights.\n  In a related argument, respondents contend that, at\ntort, liability sometimes attaches where two or more de-\nfendants inflict injury, even if each defendant\u2019s conduct,\nstanding alone, would not be actionable. See W. Keeton,\nD. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on\nTorts \u00a752, p. 354 (5th ed. 1984) (multiple defendants who\neach add negligible impurities to stream liable if aggre-\ngate impurities cause harm). But the rationale for impos-\ning liability in these circumstances is that the defendants\ncollectively invaded the plaintiff \u2019s protected interests. See\nibid. By contrast, under the Muniauction rule, respond-\nents\u2019 interests in the \u2019713 patent have not been invaded.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Second, respondents seek to analogize \u00a7271(b) to the\nfederal aiding and abetting statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a72, and\nthey argue that two parties who divide all the necessary\nelements of a crime between them are both guilty under\n\u00a72. The analogy does not hold up. The aiding and abet-\nting statute must be read \u201cagainst its common-law back-\nground,\u201d Standefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10, 19\n(1980), and at common law two or more defendants, each\nof whom committed an element of a crime, were liable as\nprincipals. See, e.g., 1 J. Bishop, Commentaries on the\nCriminal Law \u00a7649, p. 392 (7th ed. 1882). While we have\ndrawn on criminal law concepts in the past in interpreting\n\u00a7271(b), see Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10\u201312), we think it un-\nlikely that Congress had this particular doctrine in mind\nwhen it enacted the Patent Act of 1952, given the doc-\ntrine\u2019s inconsistency with the Act\u2019s cornerstone principle\nthat patentees have a right only to the set of elements\nclaimed in their patents and nothing further.\n   Third, respondents contend that patent law principles\nestablished before the enactment of the Patent Act demon-\nstrate that a defendant that performs some steps of a\npatent with the purpose of having its customers perform\nthe remaining steps is liable for inducing infringement.\nBut here, too, the nature of the rights created by the Pat-\nent Act defeats the notion that Congress could have\nintended to permit inducement liability where there is no\nunderlying direct infringement. According to respondents,\ntheir understanding of the pre-1952 doctrine casts doubt\non the Muniauction rule for direct infringement under\n\u00a7271(a), on the ground that that rule has the indirect\neffect of preventing inducement liability where Congress\nwould have wanted it. But the possibility that the Federal\nCircuit erred by too narrowly circumscribing the scope of\n\u00a7271(a) is no reason for this Court to err a second time by\nmisconstruing \u00a7271(b) to impose liability for inducing\n10         LIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC. v. AKAMAI\n                  TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ninfringement where no infringement has occurred.\n   Finally, respondents, like the Federal Circuit, criticize\nour interpretation of \u00a7271(b) as permitting a would-be\ninfringer to evade liability by dividing performance of a\nmethod patent\u2019s steps with another whom the defendant\nneither directs nor controls. We acknowledge this concern.\nAny such anomaly, however, would result from the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7271(a) in Muniauction. A\ndesire to avoid Muniauction\u2019s natural consequences does\nnot justify fundamentally altering the rules of inducement\nliability that the text and structure of the Patent Act\nclearly require\u2014an alteration that would result in its own\nserious and problematic consequences, namely, creating\nfor \u00a7271(b) purposes some free-floating concept of \u201cin-\nfringement\u201d both untethered to the statutory text and\ndifficult for the lower courts to apply consistently.\n                             III\n  Respondents ask us to review the merits of the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s Muniauction rule for direct infringement under\n\u00a7271(a). We decline to do so today.\n  In the first place, the question presented is clearly\nfocused on \u00a7271(b), not \u00a7271(a). We granted certiorari on\nthe following question: \u201cWhether the Federal Circuit erred\nin holding that a defendant may be held liable for inducing\npatent infringement under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(b) even though\nno one has committed direct infringement under \u00a7271(a).\u201d\nPet. for Cert. i. The question presupposes that Limelight\nhas not committed direct infringement under \u00a7271(a).\nAnd since the question on which we granted certiorari did\nnot involve \u00a7271(a), petitioner did not address that im-\nportant issue in its opening brief. Our decision on the\n\u00a7271(b) question necessitates a remand to the Federal\nCircuit, and on remand, the Federal Circuit will have the\nopportunity to revisit the \u00a7271(a) question if it so chooses.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.
