UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 12–158.      Argued November 5, 2013—Decided June 2, 2014\nTo implement the international Convention on the Prohibition of the\n  Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons\n  and on Their Destruction, Congress enacted the Chemical Weapons\n  Convention Implementation Act of 1998. The statute forbids, among\n  other things, any person knowingly to “possess[ ] or use . . . any\n  chemical weapon,” 18 U. S. C. §229(a)(1). A “chemical weapon” is “[a]\n  toxic chemical and its precursors, except where intended for a pur-\n  pose not prohibited under this chapter.” §229F(1)(A). A “toxic chem-\n  ical” is “any chemical which through its chemical action on life pro-\n  cesses can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm\n  to humans or animals. The term includes all such chemicals, regard-\n  less of their origin or of their method of production, and regardless of\n  whether they are produced in facilities, in munitions or elsewhere.”\n  §229F(8)(A). “[P]urposes not prohibited by this chapter” is defined as\n  “[a]ny peaceful purpose related to an industrial, agricultural, re-\n  search, medical, or pharmaceutical activity or other activity,” and\n  other specific purposes. §229F(7).\n     Petitioner Bond sought revenge against Myrlinda Haynes—with\n  whom her husband had carried on an affair—by spreading two toxic\n  chemicals on Haynes’s car, mailbox, and door knob in hopes that\n  Haynes would develop an uncomfortable rash. On one occasion\n  Haynes suffered a minor chemical burn that she treated by rinsing\n  with water, but Bond’s attempted assaults were otherwise entirely\n  unsuccessful. Federal prosecutors charged Bond with violating,\n  among other things, section 229(a). Bond moved to dismiss the chem-\n  ical weapons charges on the ground that the Act violates the Tenth\n  Amendment. When the District Court denied her motion, she plead-\n  ed guilty but reserved the right to appeal. The Third Circuit initially\n2                      BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    held that Bond lacked standing to raise her Tenth Amendment chal-\n    lenge, but this Court reversed. On remand, the Third Circuit rejected\n    her Tenth Amendment argument and her additional argument that\n    section 229 does not reach her conduct.\nHeld: Section 229 does not reach Bond’s simple assault. Pp. 8–21.\n    (a) The parties debate whether section 229 is a necessary and\n proper means of executing the Federal Government’s power to make\n treaties, but “normally [this] Court will not decide a constitutional\n question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the\n case.” Escambia County v. McMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51 (per curiam).\n Thus, this Court starts with Bond’s argument that section 229 does\n not cover her conduct. Pp. 8–9.\n    (b) This Court has no need to interpret the scope of the interna-\n tional Chemical Weapons Convention in this case. The treaty speci-\n fies that a signatory nation should implement its obligations “in ac-\n cordance with its constitutional processes.” Art. VII(1), 1974 U. N. T.\n S. 331. Bond was prosecuted under a federal statute, which, unlike\n the treaty, must be read consistent with the principles of federalism\n inherent in our constitutional structure. Pp. 10–21.\n      (1) A fair reading of section 229 must recognize the duty of “fed-\n eral courts to be certain of Congress’s intent before finding that fed-\n eral law overrides” the “usual constitutional balance of federal and\n state powers,” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460. This principle\n applies to federal laws that punish local criminal activity, which has\n traditionally been the responsibility of the States. This Court’s prec-\n edents have referred to basic principles of federalism in the Constitu-\n tion to resolve ambiguity in federal statutes. See, e.g., United States\n v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336; Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848. Here,\n the ambiguity in the statute derives from the improbably broad reach\n of the key statutory definition, given the term—“chemical weapon”—\n that is being defined, the deeply serious consequences of adopting\n such a boundless reading, and the lack of any apparent need to do so\n in light of the context from which the statute arose—a treaty about\n chemical warfare and terrorism, not about local assaults. Thus, the\n Court can reasonably insist on a clear indication that Congress in-\n tended to reach purely local crimes before interpreting section 229’s\n expansive language in a way that intrudes on the States’ police pow-\n er. Pp. 10–14.\n      (2) No such clear indication is found in section 229. An ordinary\n speaker would not describe Bond’s feud-driven act of spreading irri-\n tating chemicals as involving a “chemical weapon.” And the chemi-\n cals at issue here bear little resemblance to those whose prohibition\n was the object of an international Convention. Where the breadth of\n a statutory definition creates ambiguity, it is appropriate to look to\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  the ordinary meaning of the term being defined (here, “chemical\n  weapon”) in settling on a fair reading of the statute. See Johnson v.\n  United States, 559 U. S. 133.\n    The Government’s reading of section 229 would transform a statute\n  concerned with acts of war, assassination, and terrorism into a mas-\n  sive federal anti-poisoning regime that reaches the simplest of as-\n  saults. In light of the principle that Congress does not normally in-\n  trude upon the States’ police power, this Court is reluctant to\n  conclude that Congress meant to punish Bond’s crime with a federal\n  prosecution for a chemical weapons attack. In fact, only a handful of\n  prosecutions have been brought under section 229, and most of those\n  involved crimes not traditionally within the States’ purview, e.g., ter-\n  rorist plots.\n    Pennsylvania’s laws are sufficient to prosecute assaults like\n  Bond’s, and there is no indication in section 229 that Congress in-\n  tended to abandon its traditional “reluctan[ce] to define as a federal\n  crime conduct readily denounced as criminal by the States,” Bass,\n  supra, at 349. That principle goes to the very structure of the Consti-\n  tution, and “protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary pow-\n  er.” Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___. The global need to\n  prevent chemical warfare does not require the Federal Government\n  to reach into the kitchen cupboard. Pp. 15–21.\n681 F. 3d 149, reversed and remanded.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

UNITED\n\n                  STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 2, 2014]\n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  The horrors of chemical warfare were vividly captured\nby John Singer Sargent in his 1919 painting Gassed. The\nnearly life-sized work depicts two lines of soldiers, blinded\nby mustard gas, clinging single file to orderlies guiding\nthem to an improvised aid station. There they would\nreceive little treatment and no relief; many suffered for\nweeks only to have the gas claim their lives. The soldiers\nwere shown staggering through piles of comrades too\nseriously burned to even join the procession.\n  The painting reflects the devastation that Sargent\nwitnessed in the aftermath of the Second Battle of Arras\nduring World War I. That battle and others like it led to\nan overwhelming consensus in the international commu-\nnity that toxic chemicals should never again be used as\nweapons against human beings. Today that objective is\nreflected in the international Convention on Chemical\nWeapons, which has been ratified or acceded to by 190\ncountries. The United States, pursuant to the Federal\nGovernment’s constitutionally enumerated power to make\n2                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntreaties, ratified the treaty in 1997. To fulfill the United\nStates’ obligations under the Convention, Congress en-\nacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation\nAct of 1998. The Act makes it a federal crime for a person\nto use or possess any chemical weapon, and it punishes\nviolators with severe penalties. It is a statute that, like\nthe Convention it implements, deals with crimes of deadly\nseriousness.\n  The question presented by this case is whether the\nImplementation Act also reaches a purely local crime: an\namateur attempt by a jilted wife to injure her husband’s\nlover, which ended up causing only a minor thumb burn\nreadily treated by rinsing with water. Because our consti-\ntutional structure leaves local criminal activity primarily\nto the States, we have generally declined to read federal\nlaw as intruding on that responsibility, unless Congress\nhas clearly indicated that the law should have such reach.\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act\ncontains no such clear indication, and we accordingly\nconclude that it does not cover the unremarkable local\noffense at issue here.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  In 1997, the President of the United States, upon the\nadvice and consent of the Senate, ratified the Convention\non the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stock-\npiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their De-\nstruction. S. Treaty Doc. No. 103–21, 1974 U. N. T.

Kenyon & D.\nFeakes eds. 2007) (Kenyon & Feakes). The atrocities of\nthat war led the community of nations to adopt the 1925\nGeneva Protocol, which prohibited the use of chemicals as\na method of warfare. Id., at 5.\n    Up to the 1990s, however, chemical weapons remained\nin use both in and out of wartime, with devastating conse-\nquences. Iraq’s use of nerve agents and mustard gas\nduring its war with Iran in the 1980s contributed to inter-\nnational support for a renewed, more effective chemical\nweapons ban. Id., at 6, 10–11. In 1994 and 1995, long-\nheld fears of the use of chemical weapons by terrorists\nwere realized when Japanese extremists carried out two\nattacks using sarin gas. Id., at 6. The Convention was\nconceived as an effort to update the Geneva Protocol’s\nprotections and to expand the prohibition on chemical\nweapons beyond state actors in wartime. Convention\nPreamble, 1974 U. N. T. S. 318 (the State Parties are\n“[d]etermined for the sake of all mankind, to exclude\ncompletely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons,\n. . . thereby complementing the obligations assumed under\nthe Geneva Protocol of 1925”). The Convention aimed to\nachieve that objective by prohibiting the development,\nstockpiling, or use of chemical weapons by any State Party\nor person within a State Party’s jurisdiction. Arts. I, II,\nVII. It also established an elaborate reporting process\nrequiring State Parties to destroy chemical weapons under\ntheir control and submit to inspection and monitoring by\nan international organization based in The Hague, Neth-\nerlands. Arts. VIII, IX.\n    The Convention provides:\n4                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    “(1) Each State Party to this Convention undertakes\n    never under any circumstances:\n      “(a) To develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stock-\n    pile or retain chemical weapons, or transfer, directly\n    or indirectly, chemical weapons to anyone;\n      “(b) To use chemical weapons;\n      “(c) To engage in any military preparations to use\n    chemical weapons;\n      “(d) To assist, encourage or induce, in any way, any-\n    one to engage in any activity prohibited to a State\n    Party under this Convention.” Art. I, id., at 319.\n“Chemical Weapons” are defined in relevant part as\n“[t]oxic chemicals and their precursors, except where\nintended for purposes not prohibited under this Conven-\ntion, as long as the types and quantities are consistent\nwith such purposes.” Art. II(1)(a), ibid. “Toxic Chemical,”\nin turn, is defined as “Any chemical which through its\nchemical action on life processes can cause death, tempo-\nrary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or\nanimals. This includes all such chemicals, regardless of\ntheir origin or of their method of production, and regard-\nless of whether they are produced in facilities, in muni-\ntions or elsewhere.” Art. II(2), id., at 320. “Purposes Not\nProhibited Under this Convention” means “[i]ndustrial,\nagricultural, research, medical, pharmaceutical or other\npeaceful purposes,” Art. II(9)(a), id., at 322, and other\nspecific purposes not at issue here, Arts. II(9)(b)–(d).\n   Although the Convention is a binding international\nagreement, it is “not self-executing.” W. Krutzsch & R.\nTrapp, A Commentary on the Chemical Weapons Conven-\ntion 109 (1994). That is, the Convention creates obliga-\ntions only for State Parties and “does not by itself give rise\nto domestically enforceable federal law” absent “imple-\nmenting legislation passed by Congress.” Medellín v.\nTexas, 552 U.

VII(1), 1974 U. N. T. S. 331. “In particular,” each\nState Party shall “[p]rohibit natural and legal persons\nanywhere . . . under its jurisdiction . . . from undertaking\nany activity prohibited to a State Party under this Con-\nvention, including enacting penal legislation with respect\nto such activity.” Art. VII (1)(a), id., at 331–332.\n  Congress gave the Convention domestic effect in 1998\nwhen it passed the Chemical Weapons Convention Imple-\nmentation Act. See 112 Stat. 2681–856. The Act closely\ntracks the text of the treaty: It forbids any person know-\ningly “to develop, produce, otherwise acquire, transfer\ndirectly or indirectly, receive, stockpile, retain, own, pos-\nsess, or use, or threaten to use, any chemical weapon.” 18\nU. S. C. §229(a)(1). It defines “chemical weapon” in rele-\nvant part as “[a] toxic chemical and its precursors, except\nwhere intended for a purpose not prohibited under this\nchapter as long as the type and quantity is consistent with\nsuch a purpose.” §229F(1)(A). “Toxic chemical,” in turn, is\ndefined in general as “any chemical which through its\nchemical action on life processes can cause death, tempo-\nrary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or\nanimals. The term includes all such chemicals, regardless\nof their origin or of their method of production, and re-\ngardless of whether they are produced in facilities, in\nmunitions or elsewhere.” §229F(8)(A). Finally, “purposes\nnot prohibited by this chapter” is defined as “[a]ny peace-\nful purpose related to an industrial, agricultural, research,\nmedical, or pharmaceutical activity or other activity,” and\nother specific purposes. §229F(7). A person who violates\nsection 229 may be subject to severe punishment: impris-\nonment “for any term of years,” or if a victim’s death re-\nsults, the death penalty or imprisonment “for life.”\n§229A(a).\n6                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n  Petitioner Carol Anne Bond is a microbiologist from\nLansdale, Pennsylvania. In 2006, Bond’s closest friend,\nMyrlinda Haynes, announced that she was pregnant.\nWhen Bond discovered that her husband was the child’s\nfather, she sought revenge against Haynes. Bond stole a\nquantity of 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine (an arsenic-based\ncompound) from her employer, a chemical manufacturer.\nShe also ordered a vial of potassium dichromate (a chemi-\ncal commonly used in printing photographs or cleaning\nlaboratory equipment) on Amazon.com. Both chemicals\nare toxic to humans and, in high enough doses, potentially\nlethal. It is undisputed, however, that Bond did not in-\ntend to kill Haynes. She instead hoped that Haynes would\ntouch the chemicals and develop an uncomfortable rash.\n  Between November 2006 and June 2007, Bond went to\nHaynes’s home on at least 24 occasions and spread the\nchemicals on her car door, mailbox, and door knob. These\nattempted assaults were almost entirely unsuccessful.\nThe chemicals that Bond used are easy to see, and Haynes\nwas able to avoid them all but once. On that occasion,\nHaynes suffered a minor chemical burn on her thumb,\nwhich she treated by rinsing with water. Haynes repeat-\nedly called the local police to report the suspicious sub-\nstances, but they took no action. When Haynes found\npowder on her mailbox, she called the police again, who\ntold her to call the post office. Haynes did so, and postal\ninspectors placed surveillance cameras around her home.\nThe cameras caught Bond opening Haynes’s mailbox,\nstealing an envelope, and stuffing potassium dichromate\ninside the muffler of Haynes’s car.\n  Federal prosecutors naturally charged Bond with two\ncounts of mail theft, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1708.\nMore surprising, they also charged her with two counts\nof possessing and using a chemical weapon, in violation\nof section 229(a). Bond moved to dismiss the chemical\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nweapon counts on the ground that section 229 exceeded\nCongress’s enumerated powers and invaded powers re-\nserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment. The District\nCourt denied Bond’s motion. She then entered a condi-\ntional guilty plea that reserved her right to appeal. The\nDistrict Court sentenced Bond to six years in federal\nprison plus five years of supervised release, and ordered\nher to pay a $2,000 fine and $9,902.79 in restitution.\n   Bond appealed, raising a Tenth Amendment challenge\nto her conviction. The Government contended that Bond\nlacked standing to bring such a challenge. The Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuit agreed. We granted certio-\nrari, the Government confessed error, and we reversed.\nWe held that, in a proper case, an individual may “assert\ninjury from governmental action taken in excess of the\nauthority that federalism defines.” Bond v. United States,\n564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (Bond I) (slip op., at 8). We “ex-\npresse[d] no view on the merits” of Bond’s constitutional\nchallenge. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   On remand, Bond renewed her constitutional argument.\nShe also argued that section 229 does not reach her con-\nduct because the statute’s exception for the use of chemi-\ncals for “peaceful purposes” should be understood in con-\ntradistinction to the “warlike” activities that the\nConvention was primarily designed to prohibit. Bond\nargued that her conduct, though reprehensible, was not at\nall “warlike.” The Court of Appeals rejected this argu-\nment. 681 F. 3d 149 (CA3 2012). The court acknowledged\nthat the Government’s reading of section 229 would render\nthe statute “striking” in its “breadth” and turn every\n“kitchen cupboard and cleaning cabinet in America into a\npotential chemical weapons cache.” Id., at 154, n. 7. But\nthe court nevertheless held that Bond’s use of “ ‘highly\ntoxic chemicals with the intent of harming Haynes’ can\nhardly be characterized as ‘peaceful’ under that word’s\ncommonly understood meaning.” Id., at 154 (citation\n8                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nomitted).\n   The Third Circuit also rejected Bond’s constitutional\nchallenge to her conviction, holding that section 229 was\n“necessary and proper to carry the Convention into effect.”\nId., at 162. The Court of Appeals relied on this Court’s\nopinion in Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920),\nwhich stated that “[i]f the treaty is valid there can be no\ndispute about the validity of the statute” that implements\nit “as a necessary and proper means to execute the powers\nof the Government,” id., at 432.\n   We again granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                              II\n  In our federal system, the National Government pos-\nsesses only limited powers; the States and the people\nretain the remainder. The States have broad authority to\nenact legislation for the public good—what we have often\ncalled a “police power.” United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.\n549, 567 (1995). The Federal Government, by contrast,\nhas no such authority and “can exercise only the powers\ngranted to it,” McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405\n(1819), including the power to make “all Laws which shall\nbe necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the\nenumerated powers, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 18. For\nnearly two centuries it has been “clear” that, lacking a\npolice power, “Congress cannot punish felonies generally.”\nCohens v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 428 (1821).

Fox, 95 U. S. 670, 672 (1878).\n  The Government frequently defends federal criminal\nlegislation on the ground that the legislation is authorized\npursuant to Congress’s power to regulate interstate com-\nmerce.

As\na result, in this Court the parties have devoted significant\neffort to arguing whether section 229, as applied to Bond’s\noffense, is a necessary and proper means of executing the\nNational Government’s power to make treaties. U. S.\nConst., Art. II, §2, cl. 2. Bond argues that the lower\ncourt’s reading of Missouri v. Holland would remove all\nlimits on federal authority, so long as the Federal Gov-\nernment ratifies a treaty first. She insists that to effec-\ntively afford the Government a police power whenever it\nimplements a treaty would be contrary to the Framers’\ncareful decision to divide power between the States and\nthe National Government as a means of preserving liberty.\nTo the extent that Holland authorizes such usurpation of\ntraditional state authority, Bond says, it must be either\nlimited or overruled.\n   The Government replies that this Court has never held\nthat a statute implementing a valid treaty exceeds Con-\ngress’s enumerated powers. To do so here, the Govern-\nment says, would contravene another deliberate choice of\nthe Framers: to avoid placing subject matter limitations\non the National Government’s power to make treaties.\nAnd it might also undermine confidence in the United\nStates as an international treaty partner.\n   Notwithstanding this debate, it is “a well-established\nprinciple governing the prudent exercise of this Court’s\njurisdiction that normally the Court will not decide a\nconstitutional question if there is some other ground upon\nwhich to dispose of the case.” Escambia County v. Mc-\nMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51 (1984) (per curiam); see also\nAshwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring). Bond argues that section 229 does not\ncover her conduct. So we consider that argument first.\n10                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             III\n\n  Section 229 exists to implement the Convention, so we\nbegin with that international agreement. As explained,\nthe Convention’s drafters intended for it to be a compre-\nhensive ban on chemical weapons. But even with its\nbroadly worded definitions, we have doubts that a treaty\nabout chemical weapons has anything to do with Bond’s\nconduct. The Convention, a product of years of worldwide\nstudy, analysis, and multinational negotiation, arose in\nresponse to war crimes and acts of terrorism. See Kenyon\n& Feakes 6. There is no reason to think the sovereign\nnations that ratified the Convention were interested in\nanything like Bond’s common law assault.\n  Even if the treaty does reach that far, nothing prevents\nCongress from implementing the Convention in the same\nmanner it legislates with respect to innumerable other\nmatters—observing the Constitution’s division of respon-\nsibility between sovereigns and leaving the prosecution of\npurely local crimes to the States. The Convention, after\nall, is agnostic between enforcement at the state versus\nfederal level: It provides that “[e]ach State Party shall, in\naccordance with its constitutional processes, adopt the\nnecessary measures to implement its obligations under\nthis Convention.” Art. VII(1), 1974 U. N. T. S. 331 (em-\nphasis added); see also Tabassi, National Implementation:\nArticle VII, in Kenyon & Feakes 205, 207 (“Since the\ncreation of national law, the enforcement of it and the\nstructure and administration of government are all sover-\neign acts reserved exclusively for [State Parties], it is not\nsurprising that the Convention is so vague on the critical\nmatter of national implementation.”).\n  Fortunately, we have no need to interpret the scope of\nthe Convention in this case. Bond was prosecuted under\nsection 229, and the statute—unlike the Convention—\nmust be read consistent with principles of federalism\ninherent in our constitutional structure.\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                             A\n   In the Government’s view, the conclusion that Bond\n“knowingly” “use[d]” a “chemical weapon” in violation of\nsection 229(a) is simple: The chemicals that Bond placed\non Haynes’s home and car are “toxic chemical[s]” as de-\nfined by the statute, and Bond’s attempt to assault\nHaynes was not a “peaceful purpose.” §§229F(1), (8), (7).\nThe problem with this interpretation is that it would\n“dramatically intrude[ ] upon traditional state criminal\njurisdiction,” and we avoid reading statutes to have such\nreach in the absence of a clear indication that they do.\nUnited States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 350 (1971).\n   Part of a fair reading of statutory text is recognizing\nthat “Congress legislates against the backdrop” of certain\nunexpressed presumptions. EEOC v. Arabian American\nOil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991). As Justice Frankfurter\nput it in his famous essay on statutory interpretation,\ncorrectly reading a statute “demands awareness of certain\npresuppositions.” Some Reflections on the Reading of\nStatutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947). For example,\nwe presume that a criminal statute derived from the\ncommon law carries with it the requirement of a culpable\nmental state—even if no such limitation appears in the\ntext—unless it is clear that the Legislature intended to\nimpose strict liability. United States v. United States\nGypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 437 (1978). To take another\nexample, we presume, absent a clear statement from\nCongress, that federal statutes do not apply outside the\nUnited States. Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd.,\n561 U. S. 247, 255 (2010). So even though section 229,\nread on its face, would cover a chemical weapons crime if\ncommitted by a U. S. citizen in Australia, we would not\napply the statute to such conduct absent a plain statement\nfrom Congress.1 The notion that some things “go without\n——————\n 1 Congress   has in fact included just such a plain statement in section\n12                    BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsaying” applies to legislation just as it does to everyday\nlife.\n    Among the background principles of construction that\nour cases have recognized are those grounded in the rela-\ntionship between the Federal Government and the States\nunder our Constitution. It has long been settled, for ex-\nample, that we presume federal statutes do not abrogate\nstate sovereign immunity, Atascadero State Hospital v.\nScanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 243 (1985), impose obligations on\nthe States pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U. S. 1, 16–17 (1981), or preempt state\nlaw, Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230\n(1947).\n    Closely related to these is the well-established principle\nthat “ ‘it is incumbent upon the federal courts to be certain\nof Congress’ intent before finding that federal law over-\nrides’ ” the “usual constitutional balance of federal and\nstate powers.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460\n(1991) (quoting Atascadero, supra, at 243). To quote\nFrankfurter again, if the Federal Government would\n“ ‘radically readjust[ ] the balance of state and national\nauthority, those charged with the duty of legislating [must\nbe] reasonably explicit’ ” about it. BFP v. Resolution Trust\nCorporation, 511 U. S. 531, 544 (1994) (quoting Some\nReflections, supra, at 539–540; second alteration in origi-\nnal). Or as explained by Justice Marshall, when legisla-\ntion “affect[s] the federal balance, the requirement of clear\nstatement assures that the legislature has in fact faced,\nand intended to bring into issue, the critical matters in-\nvolved in the judicial decision.” Bass, supra, at 349.\n\n——————\n229(c)(2): “Conduct prohibited by [section 229(a)] is within the jurisdic-\ntion of the United States if the prohibited conduct . . . takes place\noutside of the United States and is committed by a national of the\nUnited States.”\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   We have applied this background principle when con-\nstruing federal statutes that touched on several areas of\ntraditional state responsibility. See Gregory, supra, at 460\n(qualifications for state officers); BFP, supra, at 544 (titles\nto real estate); Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.\nv. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 174 (2001)\n(land and water use). Perhaps the clearest example of\ntraditional state authority is the punishment of local\ncriminal activity. United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S.\n598, 618 (2000). Thus, “we will not be quick to assume\nthat Congress has meant to effect a significant change in\nthe sensitive relation between federal and state criminal\njurisdiction.” Bass, 404 U. S., at 349.\n   In Bass, we interpreted a statute that prohibited any\nconvicted felon from “ ‘receiv[ing], possess[ing], or\ntransport[ing] in commerce or affecting commerce . . . any\nfirearm.’ ” Id., at 337. The Government argued that the\nstatute barred felons from possessing all firearms and\nthat it was not necessary to demonstrate a connection to\ninterstate commerce. We rejected that reading, which\nwould “render[ ] traditionally local criminal conduct a\nmatter for federal enforcement and would also involve a\nsubstantial extension of federal police resources.” Id., at\n350. We instead read the statute more narrowly to re-\nquire proof of a connection to interstate commerce in every\ncase, thereby “preserv[ing] as an element of all the of-\nfenses a requirement suited to federal criminal jurisdic-\ntion alone.” Id., at 351.\n   Similarly, in Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 850\n(2000), we confronted the question whether the federal\narson statute, which prohibited burning “ ‘any . . . property\nused in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity\naffecting interstate or foreign commerce,’ ” reached an\nowner-occupied private residence. Once again we rejected\nthe Government’s “expansive interpretation,” under which\n“hardly a building in the land would fall outside the fed-\n14                    BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\neral statute’s domain.” Id., at 857. We instead held that the\nstatute was “most sensibly read” more narrowly to reach\nonly buildings used in “active employment for commercial\npurposes.” Id., at 855. We noted that “arson is a para-\ndigmatic common-law state crime,” id., at 858, and that\nthe Government’s proposed broad reading would “ ‘signifi-\ncantly change[ ] the federal-state balance,’ ” ibid. (quoting\nBass, 404 U. S., at 349), “mak[ing] virtually every arson in\nthe country a federal offense,” 529 U. S., at 859.\n  These precedents make clear that it is appropriate to\nrefer to basic principles of federalism embodied in the\nConstitution to resolve ambiguity in a federal statute. In\nthis case, the ambiguity derives from the improbably\nbroad reach of the key statutory definition given the\nterm—“chemical weapon”—being defined; the deeply\nserious consequences of adopting such a boundless read-\ning; and the lack of any apparent need to do so in light of\nthe context from which the statute arose—a treaty about\nchemical warfare and terrorism. We conclude that, in this\ncurious case, we can insist on a clear indication that Con-\ngress meant to reach purely local crimes, before interpret-\ning the statute’s expansive language in a way that in-\ntrudes on the police power of the States. See Bass, supra,\nat 349.2\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE SCALIA contends that the relevance of Bass and Jones to this\n\ncase is “entirely made up,” post, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment),\nbut not because he disagrees with interpreting statutes in light of\nprinciples of federalism. Rather, he says that Bass was a case where\nthe statute was unclear. We agree; we simply think the statute in this\ncase is also subject to construction, for the reasons given. As for Jones,\nJUSTICE SCALIA argues that the discussion of federalism in that case\nwas beside the point. Post, at 4. We do not read Jones that way; the\nCourt adopted the “most sensibl[e] read[ing]” of the statute, 529 U. S.,\nat 855, which suggests that other sensible readings were possible. In\narriving at its fair reading of the statute, the Court considered the\ndramatic extent to which the Government’s broader interpretation\nwould have expanded “the federal statute’s domain.” Id., at 857. We do\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014) \n          15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                                B\n\n   We do not find any such clear indication in section 229.\n“Chemical weapon” is the key term that defines the stat-\nute’s reach, and it is defined extremely broadly. But that\ngeneral definition does not constitute a clear statement\nthat Congress meant the statute to reach local criminal\nconduct.\n   In fact, a fair reading of section 229 suggests that it does\nnot have as expansive a scope as might at first appear. To\nbegin, as a matter of natural meaning, an educated user of\nEnglish would not describe Bond’s crime as involving a\n“chemical weapon.” Saying that a person “used a chemical\nweapon” conveys a very different idea than saying the\nperson “used a chemical in a way that caused some harm.”\nThe natural meaning of “chemical weapon” takes account\nof both the particular chemicals that the defendant used\nand the circumstances in which she used them.\n   When used in the manner here, the chemicals in this\ncase are not of the sort that an ordinary person would\nassociate with instruments of chemical warfare. The\nsubstances that Bond used bear little resemblance to the\ndeadly toxins that are “of particular danger to the objec-\ntives of the Convention.” Why We Need a Chemical\nWeapons Convention and an OPCW, in Kenyon & Feakes\n17 (describing the Convention’s Annex on Chemicals, a\nnonexhaustive list of covered substances that are subject\nto special regulation). More to the point, the use of some-\nthing as a “weapon” typically connotes “[a]n instrument of\noffensive or defensive combat,” Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 2589 (2002), or “[a]n instrument\nof attack or defense in combat, as a gun, missile, or\nsword,” American Heritage Dictionary 2022 (3d ed. 1992).\nBut no speaker in natural parlance would describe Bond’s\nfeud-driven act of spreading irritating chemicals on\n——————\nthe same here.\n16                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nHaynes’s door knob and mailbox as “combat.” Nor do the\nother circumstances of Bond’s offense—an act of revenge\nborn of romantic jealousy, meant to cause discomfort, that\nproduced nothing more than a minor thumb burn—\nsuggest that a chemical weapon was deployed in Norris-\ntown, Pennsylvania. Potassium dichromate and 10-chloro-\n10H-phenoxarsine might be chemical weapons if used, say,\nto poison a city’s water supply. But Bond’s crime is worlds\napart from such hypotheticals, and covering it would give\nthe statute a reach exceeding the ordinary meaning of the\nwords Congress wrote.\n  In settling on a fair reading of a statute, it is not un-\nusual to consider the ordinary meaning of a defined term,\nparticularly when there is dissonance between that ordi-\nnary meaning and the reach of the definition. In Johnson\nv. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 136 (2010), for example,\nwe considered the statutory term “ ‘violent felony,’ ” which\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act defined in relevant part as\nan offense that “ ‘has as an element the use . . . of physical\nforce against the person of another.’ ” Although “physical\nforce against . . . another” might have meant any force,\nhowever slight, we thought it “clear that in the context of\na statutory definition of ‘violent felony,’ the phrase ‘physi-\ncal force’ means violent force—that is, force capable of\ncausing physical pain or injury to another person.” Id., at\n140. The ordinary meaning of “chemical weapon” plays a\nsimilar limiting role here.\n  The Government would have us brush aside the ordi-\nnary meaning and adopt a reading of section 229 that\nwould sweep in everything from the detergent under the\nkitchen sink to the stain remover in the laundry room.\nYet no one would ordinarily describe those substances as\n“chemical weapons.”       The Government responds that\nbecause Bond used “specialized, highly toxic” (though\nlegal) chemicals, “this case presents no occasion to address\nwhether Congress intended [section 229] to apply to com-\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmon household substances.” Brief for United States 13,\nn. 3. That the statute would apply so broadly, however, is\nthe inescapable conclusion of the Government’s position:\nAny parent would be guilty of a serious federal offense—\npossession of a chemical weapon—when, exasperated by\nthe children’s repeated failure to clean the goldfish tank,\nhe considers poisoning the fish with a few drops of vine-\ngar. We are reluctant to ignore the ordinary meaning of\n“chemical weapon” when doing so would transform a\nstatute passed to implement the international Convention\non Chemical Weapons into one that also makes it a federal\noffense to poison goldfish. That would not be a “realistic\nassessment[ ] of congressional intent.” Post, at 6 (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in judgment).\n   In light of all of this, it is fully appropriate to apply the\nbackground assumption that Congress normally preserves\n“the constitutional balance between the National Govern-\nment and the States.” Bond I, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n10). That assumption is grounded in the very structure of\nthe Constitution. And as we explained when this case was\nfirst before us, maintaining that constitutional balance is\nnot merely an end unto itself. Rather, “[b]y denying any\none government complete jurisdiction over all the concerns\nof public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individ-\nual from arbitrary power.” Ibid.\n   The Government’s reading of section 229 would “ ‘alter\nsensitive federal-state relationships,’ ” convert an astonish-\ning amount of “traditionally local criminal conduct” into “a\nmatter for federal enforcement,” and “involve a substantial\nextension of federal police resources.” Bass, 404 U. S., at\n349–350. It would transform the statute from one whose\ncore concerns are acts of war, assassination, and terrorism\ninto a massive federal anti-poisoning regime that reaches\nthe simplest of assaults. As the Government reads section\n229, “hardly” a poisoning “in the land would fall outside\nthe federal statute’s domain.” Jones, 529 U. S., at 857. Of\n18                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourse Bond’s conduct is serious and unacceptable—and\nagainst the laws of Pennsylvania. But the background\nprinciple that Congress does not normally intrude upon\nthe police power of the States is critically important. In\nlight of that principle, we are reluctant to conclude that\nCongress meant to punish Bond’s crime with a federal\nprosecution for a chemical weapons attack.\n   In fact, with the exception of this unusual case, the\nFederal Government itself has not looked to section 229 to\nreach purely local crimes. The Government has identified\nonly a handful of prosecutions that have been brought\nunder this section. Brief in Opposition 27, n. 5. Most of\nthose involved either terrorist plots or the possession of\nextremely dangerous substances with the potential to\ncause severe harm to many people. See United States v.\nGhane, 673 F. 3d 771 (CA8 2012) (defendant possessed\nenough potassium cyanide to kill 450 people); United\nStates v. Crocker, 260 Fed. Appx. 794 (CA6 2008) (defend-\nant attempted to acquire VX nerve gas and chlorine gas as\npart of a plot to attack a federal courthouse); United States\nv. Krar, 134 Fed.

The\nFederal Government undoubtedly has a substantial inter-\nest in enforcing criminal laws against assassination, ter-\nrorism, and acts with the potential to cause mass suffer-\ning.     Those crimes have not traditionally been left\npredominantly to the States, and nothing we have said\nhere will disrupt the Government’s authority to prosecute\nsuch offenses.\n   It is also clear that the laws of the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania (and every other State) are sufficient to\nprosecute Bond. Pennsylvania has several statutes that\nwould likely cover her assault. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  19\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n§§2701 (2012) (simple assault), 2705 (reckless endanger-\nment), 2709 (harassment).3 And state authorities regularly\nenforce these laws in poisoning cases. See, e.g., Gamiz,\nFamily Survives Poisoned Burritos, Allentown, Pa., Morn-\ning Call, May 18, 2013 (defendant charged with assault,\nreckless endangerment, and harassment for feeding burri-\ntos poisoned with prescription medication to her husband\nand daughter); Cops: Man Was Poisoned Over 3 Years,\nHarrisburg, Pa., Patriot News, Aug. 12, 2012, p. A11\n(defendant charged with assault and reckless endanger-\nment for poisoning a man with eye drops over three years\nso that “he would pay more attention to her”).\n  The Government objects that Pennsylvania authorities\ncharged Bond with only a minor offense based on her\n“harassing telephone calls and letters,” Bond I, 564 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2), and declined to prosecute her for\nassault. But we have traditionally viewed the exercise of\nstate officials’ prosecutorial discretion as a valuable fea-\nture of our constitutional system. See Bordenkircher v.\nHayes, 434 U. S. 357, 364 (1978). And nothing in the\nConvention shows a clear intent to abrogate that feature.\nProsecutorial discretion involves carefully weighing the\nbenefits of a prosecution against the evidence needed to\nconvict, the resources of the public fisc, and the public\npolicy of the State. Here, in its zeal to prosecute Bond, the\nFederal Government has “displaced” the “public policy of\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, enacted in its capaci-\nty as sovereign,” that Bond does not belong in prison for a\nchemical weapons offense. Bond I, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12); see also Jones, supra, at 859 (Stevens, J., concur-\nring) (federal prosecution of a traditionally local crime\n——————\n  3 Pennsylvania also prohibits using “a weapon of mass destruction,”\n\nincluding a “chemical agent.” 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§2716(a), (i). Just as\nwe conclude that Bond’s offense cannot be fairly described as the use of\na chemical weapon, Pennsylvania authorities apparently determined\nthat her crime did not involve a “weapon of mass destruction.”\n20                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“illustrates how a criminal law like this may effectively\ndisplace a policy choice made by the State”).\n   As we have explained, “Congress has traditionally been\nreluctant to define as a federal crime conduct readily\ndenounced as criminal by the States.” Bass, 404 U. S., at\n349. There is no clear indication of a contrary approach\nhere. Section 229 implements the Convention, but Bond’s\ncrime could hardly be more unlike the uses of mustard gas\non the Western Front or nerve agents in the Iran-Iraq war\nthat form the core concerns of that treaty. See Kenyon &\nFeakes 6. There are no life-sized paintings of Bond’s rival\nwashing her thumb. And there are no apparent interests\nof the United States Congress or the community of nations\nin seeing Bond end up in federal prison, rather than dealt\nwith (like virtually all other criminals in Pennsylvania) by\nthe State. The Solicitor General acknowledged as much at\noral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47 (“I don’t think\nanybody would say [that] whether or not Ms. Bond is\nprosecuted would give rise to an international incident”).\n   This case is unusual, and our analysis is appropriately\nlimited. Our disagreement with our colleagues reduces to\nwhether section 229 is “utterly clear.” Post, at 5 (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in judgment). We think it is not, given that\nthe definition of “chemical weapon” in a particular case\ncan reach beyond any normal notion of such a weapon,\nthat the context from which the statute arose demon-\nstrates a much more limited prohibition was intended, and\nthat the most sweeping reading of the statute would fun-\ndamentally upset the Constitution’s balance between\nnational and local power. This exceptional convergence of\nfactors gives us serious reason to doubt the Government’s\nexpansive reading of section 229, and calls for us to inter-\npret the statute more narrowly.\n   In sum, the global need to prevent chemical warfare\ndoes not require the Federal Government to reach into the\nkitchen cupboard, or to treat a local assault with a chemi-\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

So we are forced to decide—there is no way around\nit—whether the Act’s application to what Bond did was\n——————\n  1 The Federalist No. 48, p. 333 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (here-\n\ninafter The Federalist).\n2                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nconstitutional.\n  I would hold that it was not, and for that reason would\nreverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit.\n\n                 I. The Statutory Question\n            A. Unavoidable Meaning of the Text\n   The meaning of the Act is plain. No person may know-\ningly “develop, produce, otherwise acquire, transfer directly\nor indirectly, receive, stockpile, retain, own, possess, or\nuse, or threaten to use, any chemical weapon.” 18 U. S. C.\n§229(a)(1). A “chemical weapon” is “[a] toxic chemical and\nits precursors, except where intended for a purpose not\nprohibited under this chapter as long as the type and\nquantity is consistent with such a purpose.” §229F(1)(A).\nA “toxic chemical” is “any chemical which through its\nchemical action on life processes can cause death, tempo-\nrary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or\nanimals. The term includes all such chemicals, regardless\nof their origin or of their method of production, and re-\ngardless of whether they are produced in facilities, in\nmunitions or elsewhere.” §229F(8)(A). A “purpose not\nprohibited” is “[a]ny peaceful purpose related to an indus-\ntrial, agricultural, research, medical, or pharmaceutical\nactivity or other activity.” §229F(7)(A).\n   Applying those provisions to this case is hardly compli-\ncated.    Bond possessed and used “chemical[s] which\nthrough [their] chemical action on life processes can cause\ndeath, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm.”\nThus, she possessed “toxic chemicals.” And, because they\nwere not possessed or used only for a “purpose not prohib-\nited,” §229F(1)(A), they were “chemical weapons.” Ergo,\nBond violated the Act. End of statutory analysis, I would\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nhave thought.2\n  The Court does not think the interpretive exercise so\nsimple. But that is only because its result-driven antitex-\ntualism befogs what is evident.\n                B. The Court’s Interpretation\n   The Court’s account of the clear-statement rule reads\nlike a really good lawyer’s brief for the wrong side, relying\non cases that are so close to being on point that someone\neager to reach the favored outcome might swallow them.\nThe relevance to this case of United States v. Bass, 404\nU. S. 336 (1971), and Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848\n(2000), is, in truth, entirely made up. In Bass, we had to\ndecide whether a statute forbidding “ ‘receiv[ing], pos-\nsess[ing], or transport[ing] in commerce or affecting com-\nmerce . . . any firearm’ ” prohibited possessing a gun that\nlacked any connection to interstate commerce. 404 U. S., at\n337–339. Though the Court relied in part on a federalism-\ninspired interpretive presumption, it did so only after it\nhad found, in Part I of the opinion, applying traditional\ninterpretive tools, that the text in question was ambigu-\nous, id., at 339–347. Adopting in Part II the narrower of\nthe two possible readings, we said that “unless Congress\nconveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have\nsignificantly changed the federal-state balance.” Id., at\n349 (emphasis added). Had Congress “convey[ed] its\npurpose clearly” by enacting a clear and even sweeping\nstatute, the presumption would not have applied.\n——————\n  2 Petitioner offers one textual argument that the Court does not con-\n\nsider. She argues that the exception for “peaceful purposes” is best\nunderstood as a term of art meaning roughly any purpose that is not\n“warlike.”    Brief for Petitioner 50–57.      Though that reading is\nmore defensible than the Court’s, the Act will not bear it. If “peaceful”\nmeant “nonwarlike,” the statute’s exception for “any individual self-\ndefense device, including . . . pepper spray or chemical mace,” §229C—\nthe prosaic uses of which are surely nonwarlike—would have been\nunnecessary.\n4                     BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n    Jones is also irrelevant. To determine whether an owner-\noccupied private residence counted as a “ ‘property used\nin interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affect-\ning interstate or foreign commerce’ ” under the federal\narson statute, 529 U. S., at 850–851, our opinion examined\nnot the federal-jurisdiction-expanding consequences of\nanswering yes but rather the ordinary meaning of the\nwords—and answered no, id., at 855–857. Then, in a\nseparate part of the opinion, we observed that our reading\nwas consistent with the principle that we should adopt a\nconstruction that avoids “grave and doubtful constitutional\nquestions,” id., at 857, and, quoting Bass, the principle\nthat Congress must convey its purpose clearly before its\nlaws will be “ ‘deemed to have significantly changed the\nfederal-state balance,’ ” 529 U. S., at 858. To say that the\nbest reading of the text conformed to those principles is\nnot to say that those principles can render clear text\nambiguous.3\n    The latter is what the Court says today. Inverting Bass\nand Jones, it starts with the federalism-related conse-\nquences of the statute’s meaning and reasons backwards,\nholding that, if the statute has what the Court considers a\ndisruptive effect on the “federal-state balance” of criminal\njurisdiction, ante, at 14, that effect causes the text, even if\nclear on its face, to be ambiguous. Just ponder what the\nCourt says: “[The Act’s] ambiguity derives from the im-\nprobably broad reach of the key statutory definition . . .\nthe deeply serious consequences of adopting such a bound-\nless reading; and the lack of any apparent need to do so\n. . . .” Ibid. (emphasis added). Imagine what future courts\n——————\n  3 Other cases in the Bass line confirm that broad text “need only be\n\nplain to anyone reading [it]” in order to be given its obvious meaning.\nSalinas v. United States, 522 U. S. 52, 60 (1997) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see also Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey,\n524 U. S. 206, 209 (1998); cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.

Undoubtedly so, but\nundoubtedly beside the point, since the Act supplies its\nown definition of “chemical weapon,” which unquestiona-\nbly does bring Bond’s action within the statutory prohibi-\ntion. The Court retorts that “it is not unusual to consider\nthe ordinary meaning of a defined term, particularly when\nthere is dissonance between that ordinary meaning and\nthe reach of the definition.” Ante, at 16. So close to true!\nWhat is “not unusual” is using the ordinary meaning of\nthe term being defined for the purpose of resolving an\nambiguity in the definition. When, for example, “draft,” a\nword of many meanings, is one of the words used in a\ndefinition of “breeze,” we know it has nothing to do with\nmilitary conscription or beer. The point is illustrated by\nthe almost-relevant case the Court cites for its novel prin-\nciple, Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133 (2010).\nThere the defined term was “violent felony,” which the Act\ndefined as an offense that “ ‘has as an element the use . . .\nof physical force against the person of another.’ ” Id., at\n135 (quoting §924(e)(2)(B)(i)). We had to figure out what\n“physical force” meant, since the statute “d[id] not define”\nit. Id., at 138 (emphasis added). So we consulted (among\nother things) the general meaning of the term being de-\nfined, “violent felony.” Id., at 140.\n   In this case, by contrast, the ordinary meaning of the\nterm being defined is irrelevant, because the statute’s own\n6                  BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndefinition—however expansive—is utterly clear: any\n“chemical which through its chemical action on life proc-\nesses can cause death, temporary incapacitation or per-\nmanent harm to humans or animals,” §229F(8)(A), unless\nthe chemical is possessed or used for a “peaceful purpose,”\n§229F(1)(A), (7)(A). The statute parses itself. There is no\nopinion of ours, and none written by any court or put\nforward by any commentator since Aristotle, which says,\nor even suggests, that “dissonance” between ordinary\nmeaning and the unambiguous words of a definition is to\nbe resolved in favor of ordinary meaning. If that were the\ncase, there would hardly be any use in providing a defini-\ntion. No, the true rule is entirely clear: “When a statute\nincludes an explicit definition, we must follow that defini-\ntion, even if it varies from that term’s ordinary meaning.”\nStenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914, 942 (2000) (emphasis\nadded). Once again, contemplate the judge-empowering\nconsequences of the new interpretive rule the Court today\nannounces: When there is “dissonance” between the statu-\ntory definition and the ordinary meaning of the defined\nword, the latter may prevail.\n   But even text clear on its face, the Court suggests, must\nbe read against the backdrop of established interpretive\npresumptions. Thus, we presume “that a criminal statute\nderived from the common law carries with it the require-\nment of a culpable mental state—even if no such limita-\ntion appears in the text.” Ante, at 11. And we presume\nthat “federal statutes do not apply outside the United\nStates.” Ibid. Both of those are, indeed, established in-\nterpretive presumptions that are (1) based upon realistic\nassessments of congressional intent, and (2) well known to\nCongress—thus furthering rather than subverting genu-\nine legislative intent. To apply these presumptions, then,\nis not to rewrite clear text; it is to interpret words fairly, in\nlight of their statutory context. But there is nothing ei-\nther (1) realistic or (2) well known about the presumption\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe Court shoves down the throat of a resisting statute\ntoday. Who in the world would have thought that a defini-\ntion is inoperative if it contradicts ordinary meaning?\nWhen this statute was enacted, there was not yet a “Bond\npresumption” to that effect—though presumably Congress\nwill have to take account of the Bond presumption in the\nfuture, perhaps by adding at the end of all its definitions\nthat depart from ordinary connotation “and we really\nmean it.”\n           C. The Statute as Judicially Amended\n  I suspect the Act will not survive today’s gruesome\nsurgery. A criminal statute must clearly define the con-\nduct it proscribes. If it does not “ ‘give a person of ordi-\nnary intelligence fair notice’ ” of its scope, United States\nv. Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 123 (1979), it denies due\nprocess.\n  The new §229(a)(1) fails that test. Henceforward, a\nperson “shall be fined . . . , imprisoned for any term of\nyears, or both,” §229A(a)(1)—or, if he kills someone, “shall\nbe punished by death or imprisoned for life,” §229A(a)(2)—\nwhenever he “develop[s], produce[s], otherwise acquire[s],\ntransfer[s] directly or indirectly, receive[s], stockpile[s],\nretain[s], own[s], possess[es], or use[s], or threaten[s] to\nuse,” §229(a)(1), any chemical “of the sort that an ordinary\nperson would associate with instruments of chemical war­\nfare,” ante, at 15 (emphasis added). Whether that test is\nsatisfied, the Court unhelpfully (and also illogically) ex-\nplains, depends not only on the “particular chemicals that\nthe defendant used” but also on “the circumstances in\nwhich she used them.” Ibid. The “detergent under the\nkitchen sink” and “the stain remover in the laundry room”\nare apparently out, ante, at 16—but what if they are\ndeployed to poison a neighborhood water fountain? Poi-\nsoning a goldfish tank is also apparently out, ante, at 17,\nbut what if the fish belongs to a Congressman or Governor\n8                     BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand the act is meant as a menacing message, a small-time\nequivalent of leaving a severed horse head in the bed? See\nibid. (using the “concerns” driving the Convention—“acts\nof war, assassination, and terrorism”—as guideposts of\nstatutory meaning). Moreover, the Court’s illogical embel-\nlishment seems to apply only to the “use” of a chemical,\nante, at 15, but “use” is only 1 of 11 kinds of activity that\nthe statute prohibits. What, one wonders, makes some-\nthing a “chemical weapon” when it is merely “stockpile[d]”\nor “possess[ed]?” To these questions and countless others,\none guess is as bad as another.\n   No one should have to ponder the totality of the circum-\nstances in order to determine whether his conduct is a\nfelony. Yet that is what the Court will now require of all\nfuture handlers of harmful toxins—that is to say, all of us.\nThanks to the Court’s revisions, the Act, which before was\nmerely broad, is now broad and unintelligible. “[N]o\nstandard of conduct is specified at all.” Coates v. Cincin­\nnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614 (1971). Before long, I suspect,\ncourts will be required to say so.\n               II. The Constitutional Question\n  Since the Act is clear, the real question this case pre-\nsents is whether the Act is constitutional as applied to\npetitioner. An unreasoned and citation-less sentence from\nour opinion in Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920),\npurported to furnish the answer: “If the treaty is valid”—\nand no one argues that the Convention is not—“there can\nbe no dispute about the validity of the statute under Arti-\ncle I, §8, as a necessary and proper means to execute the\npowers of the Government.” Id., at 432.4 Petitioner and\n——————\n  4 Nineteen years earlier, the Court embraced a similar view—also\n\nwithout reasoning.

[the]\nPower . . . to make Treaties.”\n  It is obvious what the Clauses, read together, do not say.\nThey do not authorize Congress to enact laws for carrying\ninto execution “Treaties,” even treaties that do not execute\nthemselves, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention.6\n——————\nto give efficacy to any stipulations which it is competent for the Presi-\ndent by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to insert in a\ntreaty with a foreign power”).

United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736 (1836) (“The government of the United States\n. . . is one of limited powers.

Ante, at 8–9.\n    6 Non-self-executing treaties are treaties whose commitments do not\n\n“automatically have effect as domestic law,” Medellín v. Texas, 552\n10                   BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nSurely it makes sense, the Government contends, that\nCongress would have the power to carry out the obliga-\ntions to which the President and the Senate have commit-\nted the Nation. The power to “carry into Execution” the\n“Power . . . to make Treaties,” it insists, has to mean the\npower to execute the treaties themselves.\n   That argument, which makes no pretense of resting on\ntext, unsurprisingly misconstrues it. Start with the\nphrase “to make Treaties.” A treaty is a contract with a\nforeign nation made, the Constitution states, by the Presi-\ndent with the concurrence of “two thirds of the Senators\npresent.” That is true of self-executing and non-self-\nexecuting treaties alike; the Constitution does not distin-\nguish between the two. So, because the President and the\nSenate can enter into a non-self-executing compact with a\nforeign nation but can never by themselves (without the\nHouse) give that compact domestic effect through legisla-\ntion, the power of the President and the Senate “to make”\na Treaty cannot possibly mean to “enter into a compact\nwith a foreign nation and then give that compact domestic\nlegal effect.” We have said in another context that a right\n“to make contracts” (a treaty, of course, is a contract) does\nnot “extend . . . to conduct . . . after the contract relation\nhas been established . . . . Such postformation conduct\ndoes not involve the right to make a contract, but rather\nimplicates the performance of established contract obliga-\ntions.” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,\n177 (1989) (emphasis added).           Upon the President’s\nagreement and the Senate’s ratification, a treaty—no\nmatter what kind—has been made and is not susceptible\nof any more making.\n   How might Congress have helped “carr[y]” the power to\n——————\nU.

It could\nhave appropriated money for hiring treaty negotiators,\nempowered the Department of State to appoint those\nnegotiators, formed a commission to study the benefits\nand risks of entering into the agreement, or paid for a\nbevy of spies to monitor the treaty-related deliberations of\nother potential signatories. See G. Lawson & G. Seidman,\nThe Constitution of Empire: Territorial Expansion and\nAmerican Legal History 63 (2004). The Necessary and\nProper Clause interacts similarly with other Article II\npowers: “[W]ith respect to the executive branch, the\nClause would allow Congress to institute an agency to\nhelp the President wisely employ his pardoning power\n. . . . Most important, the Clause allows Congress to estab-\nlish officers to assist the President in exercising his ‘execu-\ntive Power.’ ” Calabresi & Prakash, The President’s Power\nto Execute the Laws, 104 Yale L. J. 541, 591 (1994).\n    But a power to help the President make treaties is not a\npower to implement treaties already made. See generally\nRosenkranz, Executing the Treaty Power, 118 Harv.\nL. Rev. 1867 (2005). Once a treaty has been made, Con-\ngress’s power to do what is “necessary and proper” to\nassist the making of treaties drops out of the picture. To\nlegislate compliance with the United States’ treaty obliga-\ntions, Congress must rely upon its independent (though\nquite robust) Article I, §8, powers.\n                       B. Structure\n  “[T]he Constitutio[n] confer[s] upon Congress . . . not all\ngovernmental powers, but only discrete, enumerated\nones.” Printz v. United States, 521 U.

Ogden, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195 (1824).\n  But in Holland, the proponents of unlimited congres-\nsional power found a loophole: “By negotiating a treaty\n12                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand obtaining the requisite consent of the Senate, the\nPresident . . . may endow Congress with a source of legis-\nlative authority independent of the powers enumerated in\nArticle I.” L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law §4–4,\npp. 645–646 (3d ed. 2000). Though Holland’s change to\nthe Constitution’s text appears minor (the power to carry\ninto execution the power to make treaties becomes the\npower to carry into execution treaties), the change to its\nstructure is seismic.\n   To see why vast expansion of congressional power is not\njust a remote possibility, consider two features of the\nmodern practice of treaty making. In our Nation’s early\nhistory, and extending through the time when Holland\nwas written, treaties were typically bilateral, and ad-\ndressed only a small range of topics relating to the obli-\ngations of each state to the other, and to citizens of the\nother—military neutrality, for example, or military alliance,\nor guarantee of most-favored-nation trade treatment. See\nBradley, The Treaty Power and American Federalism, 97\nMich. L. Rev. 390, 396 (1998). But beginning in the last\nhalf of the last century, many treaties were “detailed\nmultilateral instruments negotiated and drafted at inter-\nnational conferences,” ibid., and they sought to regulate\nstates’ treatment of their own citizens, or even “the activi-\nties of individuals and private entities,” A. Chayes & A.\nChayes, The New Sovereignty: Compliance with Interna-\ntional Regulatory Agreements 14 (1995). “[O]ften vague\nand open-ended,” such treaties “touch on almost every\naspect of domestic civil, political, and cultural life.” Brad-\nley & Goldsmith, Treaties, Human Rights, and Condi-\ntional Consent, 149 U. Pa. L. Rev. 399, 400 (2000).\n   Consider also that, at least according to some scholars,\nthe Treaty Clause comes with no implied subject-matter\nlimitations. See, e.g., L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the\nUnited States Constitution 191, 197 (2d ed. 1996); but see\nBradley, supra, at 433–439. On this view, “[t]he Tenth\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

It could begin, as\nsome scholars have suggested, with abrogation of this\nCourt’s constitutional rulings. For example, the holding\nthat a statute prohibiting the carrying of firearms near\nschools went beyond Congress’s enumerated powers,\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 551 (1995), could be\nreversed by negotiating a treaty with Latvia providing\nthat neither sovereign would permit the carrying of guns\nnear schools. Similarly, Congress could reenact the inval-\nidated part of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994\nthat provided a civil remedy for victims of gender-\nmotivated violence, just so long as there were a treaty on\npoint—and some authors think there already is, see\nMacKinnon, The Supreme Court, 1999 Term, Comment,\n114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, 167 (2000).\n   But reversing some of this Court’s decisions is the least\nof the problem. Imagine the United States’ entry into an\nAntipolygamy Convention, which called for—and Congress\nenacted—legislation providing that, when a spouse of a\nman with more than one wife dies intestate, the surviv-\ning husband may inherit no part of the estate. Constitu-\ntional? The Federalist answers with a rhetorical ques-\ntion: “Suppose by some forced constructions of its authority\n(which indeed cannot easily be imagined) the Federal\nLegislature should attempt to vary the law of descent in\nany State; would it not be evident that . . . it had exceeded\nits jurisdiction and infringed upon that of the State?” The\n14                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nFederalist No. 33, at 206 (A. Hamilton). Yet given the\nAntipolygamy Convention, Holland would uphold it. Or\nimagine that, to execute a treaty, Congress enacted a\nstatute prohibiting state inheritance taxes on real prop-\nerty. Constitutional? Of course not. Again, The Federalist:\n“Suppose . . . [Congress] should undertake to abrogate a\nland tax imposed by the authority of a State, would it not\nbe equally evident that this was an invasion of that con-\ncurrent jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax which\nits constitution plainly supposes to exist in the State\ngovernments?” No. 33, at 206. Holland would uphold it.\nAs these examples show, Holland places Congress only\none treaty away from acquiring a general police power.\n   The Necessary and Proper Clause cannot bear such\nweight. As Chief Justice Marshall said regarding it, no\n“great substantive and independent power” can be “im-\nplied as incidental to other powers, or used as a means of\nexecuting them.” McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n411 (1819); see Baude, Rethinking the Federal Eminent\nDomain Power, 122 Yale L. J. 1738, 1749–1755 (2013).\nNo law that flattens the principle of state sovereignty,\nwhether or not “necessary,” can be said to be “proper.” As\nan old, well-known treatise put it, “it would not be a proper\nor constitutional exercise of the treaty-making power to\nprovide that Congress should have a general legislative\nauthority over a subject which has not been given it by the\nConstitution.” 1 W. Willoughby, The Constitutional Law\nof the United States §216, p. 504 (1910).\n   We would not give the Government’s support of the\nHolland principle the time of day were we confronted with\n“treaty-implementing” legislation that abrogated the\nfreedom of speech or some other constitutionally protected\nindividual right. We proved just that in Reid v. Covert,\n354 U. S. 1 (1957), which held that commitments made in\ntreaties with Great Britain and Japan would not permit\ncivilian wives of American servicemen stationed in those\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

The\nplurality opinion said that “no agreement with a foreign\nnation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other\nbranch of Government, which is free from the restraints of\nthe Constitution.” Id., at 16.\n   To be sure, the Reid plurality purported to distinguish\nthe ipse dixit of Holland with its own unsupported ipse\ndixit. “[T]he people and the States,” it said, “have delegated\n[the treaty] power to the National Government [so] the\nTenth Amendment is no barrier.” 354 U. S., at 18. The\nopinion does not say why (and there is no reason why) only\nthe Tenth Amendment, and not the other nine, has been\n“delegated” away by the treaty power. The distinction\nbetween provisions protecting individual liberty, on the\none hand, and “structural” provisions, on the other, cannot\nbe the explanation, since structure in general—and espe-\ncially the structure of limited federal powers—is designed\nto protect individual liberty. “The federal structure . . .\nsecures the freedom of the individual. . . . By denying any\none government complete jurisdiction over all the concerns\nof public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individ-\nual from arbitrary power.” Bond v. United States, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9–10).\n   The Government raises a functionalist objection: If the\nConstitution does not limit a self-executing treaty to the\nsubject matter delineated in Article I, §8, then it makes no\nsense to impose that limitation upon a statute implement-\ning a non-self-executing treaty. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–33.\nThe premise of the objection (that the power to make self-\nexecuting treaties is limitless) is, to say the least, argua-\nble. But even if it is correct, refusing to extend that prop-\nosition to non-self-executing treaties makes a great deal of\nsense. Suppose, for example, that the self-aggrandizing\nFederal Government wishes to take over the law of intes-\ntacy. If the President and the Senate find in some foreign\nstate a ready accomplice, they have two options. First,\n16                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthey can enter into a treaty with “stipulations” specific\nenough that they “require no legislation to make them\noperative,” Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 194\n(1888), which would mean in this example something like\na comprehensive probate code. But for that to succeed, the\nPresident and a supermajority of the Senate would need to\nreach agreement on all the details—which, when once\nembodied in the treaty, could not be altered or superseded\nby ordinary legislation. The second option—far the better\none—is for Congress to gain lasting and flexible control\nover the law of intestacy by means of a non-self-executing\ntreaty. “[Implementing] legislation is as much subject to\nmodification and repeal by Congress as legislation upon\nany other subject.” Ibid. And to make such a treaty, the\nPresident and Senate would need to agree only that they\ndesire power over the law of intestacy.\n  The famous scholar and jurist Henry St. George Tucker\nsaw clearly the danger of Holland’s ipse dixit five years\nbefore it was written:\n     “[The statement is made that] if the treaty-making\n     power, composed of the President and Senate, in dis-\n     charging its functions under the government, finds\n     that it needs certain legislative powers which Con-\n     gress does not possess to carry out its desires, it may\n     . . . infuse into Congress such powers, although the\n     Framers of the Constitution omitted to grant them to\n     Congress. . . . Every reputable commentator upon the\n     Constitution from Story down to the present day, has\n     held that the legislative powers of Congress lie in\n     grant and are limited by such grant. . . . [S]hould such\n     a construction as that asserted in the above statement\n     obtain through judicial endorsement, our system of\n     government would soon topple and fall.” Limitations\n     on the Treaty-Making Power Under the Constitution\n     of the United States §113, pp. 129–130 (1915).\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

See ante, at 1–2 (SCALIA, J., con-\ncurring in judgment). That aggrandizement of federal\npower cannot be justified as a “necessary and proper”\nmeans of implementing a treaty addressing similar subject\nmatter. See ante, at 8–9. To the contrary, reading the\nNecessary and Proper Clause to expand Congress’ power\nupon the ratification of every new treaty defies an indis-\nputable first principle of our constitutional order: “ ‘[T]he\nConstitution created a Federal Government of limited\npowers.’ ” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 155\n(1992) (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457\n(1991)). I accordingly join JUSTICE SCALIA’s opinion in\nfull.\n   I write separately to suggest that the Treaty Power is\nitself a limited federal power. Cf. United States v. Lopez,\n514 U. S. 549, 584 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (“[W]e\nalways have rejected readings of . . . the scope of federal\npower that would permit Congress to exercise a police\npower”). The Constitution empowers the President, “by\nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make\n2                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nTreaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present\nconcur.” Art. II, §2. The Constitution does not, however,\ncomprehensively define the proper bounds of the Treaty\nPower, and this Court has not yet had occasion to do so.\nAs a result, some have suggested that the Treaty Power is\nboundless—that it can reach any subject matter, even\nthose that are of strictly domestic concern. See, e.g., Re-\nstatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United\nStates, §302, Comment c (1986). A number of recent\ntreaties reflect that suggestion by regulating what appear\nto be purely domestic affairs. See, e.g., Bradley, The Treaty\nPower and American Federalism, 97 Mich. L. Rev. 390,\n402–409 (1998) (hereinafter Bradley) (citing examples).\n  Yet to interpret the Treaty Power as extending to every\nconceivable domestic subject matter—even matters with-\nout any nexus to foreign relations—would destroy the\nbasic constitutional distinction between domestic and\nforeign powers. See United States v. Curtiss-Wright Ex-\nport Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 319 (1936) (“[T]he federal power\nover external affairs [is] in origin and essential character\ndifferent from that over internal affairs . . .”). It would\nalso lodge in the Federal Government the potential for “a\n‘police power’ over all aspects of American life.” Lopez,\nsupra, at 584 (THOMAS, J., concurring). A treaty-based\npower of that magnitude—no less than a plenary power of\nlegislation—would threaten “ ‘ “the liberties that derive\nfrom the diffusion of sovereign power.” ’ ” Bond v. United\nStates, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9). And a\ntreaty-based police power would pose an even greater\nthreat when exercised through a self-executing treaty\nbecause it would circumvent the role of the House of Rep-\nresentatives in the legislative process. See The Federalist\nNo. 52, p. 355 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (noting that\nthe House has a more “immediate dependence on, & an\nintimate sympathy with the people”).\n  I doubt the Treaty Power creates such a gaping loophole\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nin our constitutional structure. Although the parties have\nnot challenged the constitutionality of the particular\ntreaty at issue here, in an appropriate case I believe the\nCourt should address the scope of the Treaty Power as it\nwas originally understood. Today, it is enough to high-\nlight some of the structural and historical evidence sug-\ngesting that the Treaty Power can be used to arrange\nintercourse with other nations, but not to regulate purely\ndomestic affairs.\n                              I\n   The Treaty Power was not drafted on a blank slate. To\nthe contrary, centuries of experience—reflected in treatises,\ndictionaries, and actual practice—shaped the contours of\nthat power.\n   Early treatises discussed a wide variety of treaties that\nnevertheless shared a common thread: All of them gov-\nerned genuinely international matters such as war, peace,\nand trade between nations. See, e.g., 2 H. Grotius, De\nJure Belli Ac Pacis 394–396 (1646 ed., F. Kelsey transl.\n1925) (treaties are made “for the sake either of peace or of\nsome alliance,” including “for the restoration of captives\nand of captured property, and for safety”; “that neither\nsignatory shall have fortresses in the territory of the\nother, or defend the subjects of the other, or furnish a\npassage to the enemy of the other”; and for “commercial\nrelations” and agreements on “import duties” (footnote\nomitted)); 2 S. Pufendorf, De Jure Naturae et Gentium\n1331 (1688 ed., C. Oldfather & W. Oldfather transls. 1934)\n(treaties are made “to form some union or society, the end\nof which is either commercial relations, or a united front\nin war”); 3 E. Vattel, The Law of Nations 165 (1758 ed., C.\nFenwick transl. 1916) (treaties, which “can be subdivided\ninto as many classes as there are varieties in the character\nof national relations,” “deal with conditions of commerce,\nwith mutual defense, with belligerent relations, with\n4                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nrights of passage, . . . stipulations not to fortify certain\nplaces, etc.”).\n   Founding-era dictionaries reflect a similar understand-\ning. To be sure, some early dictionaries briefly defined\n“treaty” simply as a “compact of accommodation relating to\npublic affairs.” See, e.g., 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 2056 (rev. 4th ed. 1773). More detailed\ndefinitions, however, recognized the particular character\nof treaties as addressing matters of intercourse between\nnations rather than domestic regulation. See, e.g., J.\nBuchanan, A New English Dictionary (1769) (defining\n“treaty” as “[a] covenant or agreement between several\nnations for peace, commerce, navigation, &c.”); N. Bailey,\nAn Universal Etymological English Dictionary (26th ed.\n1789) (same); J. Montefiore, A Commercial Dictionary\n(1803) (noting “treaties of alliance” for military aid; “trea-\nties of subsidy” for the provision of soldiers; treaties of\nnavigation and commerce; treaties governing fishing and\ntimber rights; and treaties on import duties); 2 N. Web-\nster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 97\n(1828) (noting “treaties for regulating commercial inter-\ncourse, treaties of alliance, offensive and defensive, trea-\nties for hiring troops, [and] treaties of peace”).\n   Treaty practice under the Articles of Confederation was\nalso consistent with the understanding that treaties gov-\nern matters of international intercourse. The Articles\nprovided: “The United States in Congress assembled, shall\nhave the sole and exclusive right and power of . . . entering\ninto treaties and alliances . . . .” Art. IX. The Congress of\nthe Confederation exercised that power by making treaties\nthat fell squarely within the traditional scope of the power.\nSee, e.g., Treaty with the Cherokee, Art. IV, Nov. 28,\n1785, 7 Stat. 19, 2 C. Kappler, Indian Affairs: Laws and\nTreaties 9 (1904) (territorial borders); Definitive Treaty of\nPeace, U. S.-Gr. Brit., Art. VII, Sept. 3, 1783, 8 Stat. 83,\nT.

No. 346\n(rights of citizens of one treaty partner residing in the\nterritory of the other).\n   These treaties entered into under the Articles of Con-\nfederation would not have suggested to the Framers that\ngranting a power to “make Treaties” included authoriza-\ntion to regulate purely domestic matters. Whenever these\ntreaties affected legal rights within United States territory,\nthey addressed only rights that related to foreign sub-\njects or foreign property. See, e.g., Treaty of Amity and\nCommerce, U. S.-Neth., Art. IV, Oct. 8, 1782, 8 Stat. 34\n(affording burial rights “when any subjects or inhabitants\nof either party shall die in the territory of the other”);\nTreaty with the Cherokee, Art.

Preconstitutional practice\ntherefore reflects the use of the treaty-making power only\nfor matters of international intercourse; that practice\n6                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nprovides no support for using treaties to regulate purely\ndomestic affairs.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Debates preceding the ratification of the proposed Con-\nstitution confirm the limited scope of the powers possessed\nby the Federal Government generally; the Treaty Power\nwas no exception. The Framers understood that most\nregulatory matters were to be left to the States. See The\nFederalist No. 45, at 313 (J. Madison) (“The powers dele-\ngated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Gov-\nernment, are few and defined”); see also Lopez, 514 U. S.,\nat 590–592 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (citing sources).\nConsistent with that general understanding of limited\nfederal power, evidence from the ratification campaign\nsuggests that the Treaty Power was limited and, in par-\nticular, confined to matters of intercourse with other\nnations.\n   In essays during the ratification campaign in New York,\nJames Madison took the view that the Treaty Power was\ninherently limited. The Federal Government’s powers,\nMadison wrote, “will be exercised principally on external\nobjects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign com-\nmerce”—the traditional subjects of treaty-making. The\nFederalist No. 45, at 313. If the “external” Treaty Power\ncontained a capacious domestic regulatory authority, that\nwould plainly conflict with Madison’s firm understanding\nthat “[t]he powers delegated by the proposed Constitution\nto the Federal Government, are few and defined.” Ibid.\nMadison evidently saw no conflict, however, because the\nTreaty Power included authority to “regulate the inter-\ncourse with foreign nations” rather than all domestic\naffairs. Id., No. 42, at 279.\n   Madison reiterated that understanding at the 1788\nVirginia ratifying convention, where the most extensive\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndiscussion of the proposed Treaty Power occurred, see\nBradley 410; Golove, Treaty-Making and the Nation, 98\nMich. L. Rev. 1075, 1141–1142 (2000) (hereinafter Golove).\nThere, Anti-Federalists leveled the charge that the Treaty\nPower gave the Federal Government excessive power.\nSee, e.g., 3 Debates on the Federal Constitution 509 (J.\nElliot 2d ed. 1876) (hereinafter Elliot’s Debates) (G. Ma-\nson) (“The President and Senate can make any treaty\nwhatsoever”); id., at 513 (P. Henry) (“To me this power\nappears still destructive; for they can make any treaty”).\nBut Madison insisted that just “because this power is\ngiven to Congress,” it did not follow that the Treaty Power\nwas “absolute and unlimited.” Id., at 514. The President\nand the Senate lacked the power “to dismember the em-\npire,” for example, because “[t]he exercise of the power\nmust be consistent with the object of the delegation.” Ibid.\n“The object of treaties,” in Madison’s oft-repeated formula-\ntion, “is the regulation of intercourse with foreign nations,\nand is external.” Ibid.\n   Although Alexander Hamilton undoubtedly believed\nthat the Treaty Power was broad within its proper sphere,\nsee infra, at 8, the view he expressed in essays during the\nNew York ratification campaign is entirely consistent with\nMadison’s. After noting that the Treaty Power was one of\nthe “most unexceptionable parts” of the proposed Consti-\ntution, Hamilton distinguished the Treaty Power from the\nlegislative power “to prescribe rules for the regulation of\nthe society” and from the executive power to “execut[e] . . .\nthe laws.” The Federalist No. 75, at 503–504. “The power\nof making treaties,” he concluded, “is plainly neither the\none nor the other.” Id., at 504. Rather, Hamilton ex-\nplained that treaties “are not rules prescribed by the\nsovereign to the subject, but agreements between sover-\neign and sovereign.” Id., at 504–505. That description is\ndifficult to square with a view of the Treaty Power that\nwould allow the Federal Government to prescribe rules\n8                  BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nover all aspects of domestic life.\n                              B\n   It did not escape the attention of the Framers that the\nTreaty Power was drafted without explicitly enumerated\nlimits on what sorts of treaties are permissible. See, e.g.,\nHamilton, The Defence No. XXXVI, in 20 Papers of Alex-\nander Hamilton 6 (H. Syrett ed. 1974) (“A power ‘to make\ntreaties,’ granted in these indefinite terms, extends to all\nkinds of treaties and with all the latitude which such a\npower under any form of Government can possess”). The\nArticles of Confederation had, for example, explicitly\nrestricted certain categories of treaties.      See Art. IX\n(“[N]o treaty of commerce shall be made whereby the legis-\nlative power of the respective States shall be restrained\nfrom imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners, as\ntheir own people are subjected to, or from prohibiting the\nexportation or importation of any species of goods or com-\nmodities whatsoever”). The Constitution omitted those\nrestrictions.\n   That decision was not a grant of unlimited power, but\nrather a grant of flexibility; the Federal Government\nneeded the ability to respond to unforeseeable varieties of\nintercourse with other nations. James Madison, for ex-\nample, did “not think it possible to enumerate all the cases\nin which such external regulations would be necessary.” 3\nElliot’s Debates 514; see also id., at 363 (E. Randolph)\n(“The various contingencies which may form the object of\ntreaties, are, in the nature of things, incapable of defini-\ntion”). But Madison nevertheless recognized that any\nexercise of the Treaty Power “must be consistent with the\nobject of the delegation,” which is “the regulation of inter-\ncourse with foreign nations.” Id., at 514; see also Hamil-\nton, The Defence, supra, at 6 (“[W]hatever is a proper\nsubject of compact between Nation & Nation may be em-\nbraced by a Treaty” (emphasis added)).

Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation,\nNov. 19, 1794, 8 Stat. 116, T. S. No. 105. When President\nWashington requested appropriations to implement that\nso-called “Jay Treaty” (after its chief negotiator, John Jay),\nthe House of Representatives engaged in a month-long\nfloor debate over its own role in the process of implement-\ning treaties. See 5 Annals of Cong. 426 (1796); see gener-\nally D. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: The Fed-\neralist Period 1789–1801, pp. 211–217 (1997). Some\nCongressmen argued that the House had a right to inde-\npendently review the merits of the treaty. See, e.g., 5\nAnnals of Cong. 427–428 (remarks of Rep. Livingston)\n(“[T]he House w[as] vested with a discretionary power of\ncarrying the Treaty into effect, or refusing it their sanc-\ntion”). Others insisted that “if the Treaty was the su-\npreme law of the land, then there was no discretionary\npower in the House, except on the question of its constitu-\ntionality.” Id., at 436–437 (Rep. Murray).\n   That latter group relied in part on the observation that\nthe Treaty Power was limited by its nature, and thus the\nConstitution’s failure to specify a role for the House did\nnot pose a mortal threat to that Chamber’s legislative\nprerogatives. Representative James Hillhouse of Connect-\n10                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nicut expounded that position in the floor debate. Hillhouse\nrecognized that the House had an “indispensable duty to\nlook into every Treaty” to ensure that it is constitutional,\ni.e., “whether it related to objects within the province of\nthe Treaty-making power, a power which is not unlim-\nited.” Id., at 660. He further explained that “[t]he objects\nupon which it can operate are understood and well de-\nfined, and if the Treaty-making power were to embrace\nother objects, their doings would have no more binding\nforce than if the Legislature were to assume and exercise\njudicial powers under the name of legislation.” Ibid.\n   Hillhouse “advert[ed] to the general definition of the\nTreaty-making power” to explain why the Treaty Power\nwas not a threat to the House’s legislative prerogatives:\n     “[I]f we look into our code of laws, we shall find few of\n     them that can be affected, to any great degree, by the\n     Treaty-making power. All laws regulating our own\n     internal police, so far as the citizens of the United\n     States alone are concerned, are wholly beyond its\n     reach; no foreign nation having any interest or con-\n     cern in that business, every attempt to interfere\n     would be a mere nullity, as much as if two individuals\n     were to enter into a contract to regulate the conduct\n     or actions of a third person, who was no party to such\n     contract.” Id., at 662.\nHe accordingly denied that “the President and Senate\nhav[e] it in their power, by forming Treaties with an Indian\ntribe or a foreign nation, to legislate over the United\nStates,” concluding instead that the Treaty Power “cannot\naffect the Legislative power of Congress but in a very\nsmall and limited degree.” Id., at 663.\n   Other Representatives who participated in the Jay\nTreaty debates agreed with Hillhouse that the Treaty\nPower had a limited scope. See, e.g., id., at 516 (Rep.\nSedgwick) (classifying the uses of the power as “1. To\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

To form contracts for mutual security or\ndefence; or to make Treaties, offensive or defensive. 3. To\nregulate an intercourse for mutual benefit, or to form\nTreaties of commerce”). James Madison, who opposed the\nJay Treaty as a Representative from Virginia, also took\nthe opportunity to reiterate his view that “the Treaty-\nmaking power was a limited power.” Id., at 777.\n   Other historical evidence from the postratification period\nis in accord. For example, Thomas Jefferson’s Senate\nManual of Parliamentary Procedure, drafted while he was\nVice President and therefore president of the Senate,\nBradley 415, noted the need for a treaty to have a nexus to\ninternational intercourse. If a treaty did not “concern the\nforeign nation, party to the contract,” then “it would be a\nmere nullity res inter alias acta.” Thomas Jefferson’s\nSenate Manual (1801), in 9 The Writings of Thomas Jef-\nferson 80–81 (H. Washington ed. 1861). Later, Justice\nStory likewise anchored the Treaty Power in intercourse\nbetween nations. J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitu-\ntion of the United States 552–553 (abr. ed. 1833). (“The\npower ‘to make treaties’ is by the constitution general; and\nof course it embraces all sorts of treaties, for peace or war;\nfor commerce or territory; for alliance or succours; for\nindemnity for injuries or payment of debts; for the recogni-\ntion or enforcement of principles of public law; and for any\nother purposes, which the policy or interests of independ-\nent sovereigns may dictate in their intercourse with each\nother”).\n   The touchstone of all of these views was that the Treaty\nPower is limited to matters of international intercourse.\nEven if a treaty may reach some local matters,1 it still\n——————\n  1 This point remains disputed.      Compare Bradley 456 (contending\nthat treaties should be subject “to the same federalism restrictions that\n12                  BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmust relate to intercourse with other nations. The Jay\nTreaty, for example, altered state property law, but only\nwith respect to British subjects, who could hold and devise\nreal property in the United States “in like manner as if\nthey were natives.” Art. IX, 8 Stat. 122. An 1815 treaty\nwith Great Britain was held to pre-empt a state law au-\nthorizing the seizure of “ ‘free negroes or persons of color’ ”\nat ports in part because the state law applied to British\nsailors.

Cf. Power Auth. of N. Y. v.\nFederal Power Comm’n, 247 F. 2d 538, 542–543 (CADC\n1957) (Bazelon, J.) (“No court has ever said . . . that the\ntreaty power can be exercised without limit to affect mat-\nters which are of purely domestic concern and do not\npertain to our relations with other nations”), vacated as\nmoot, 355 U. S. 64 (1957) (per curiam).\n   A common refrain in these cases is that the Treaty\nPower “extends to all proper subjects of negotiation with\nforeign governments.” In re Ross, 140 U. S. 453, 463\n(1891); see also Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U. S. 258, 266 (1890)\n(same); Asakura v. Seattle, 265 U. S. 332, 341 (1924)\n(same). Those cases identified certain paradigmatic in-\nstances of “intercourse” that were “proper negotiating\nsubjects” fit for treaty. See, e.g., Holmes, supra, at 569\n(“[T]he treaty-making power must have authority to de-\ncide how far the right of a foreign nation . . . will be recog-\nnised and enforced, when it demands the surrender of any\n[fugitive] charged with offences against it”); Geofroy, su-\npra, at 266 (“It is also clear that the protection which\nshould be afforded to the citizens of one country owning\nproperty in another, and the manner in which that prop-\nerty may be transferred, devised or inherited, are fitting\nsubjects for such negotiation and of regulation by mutual\nstipulations between the two countries”); Asakura, supra,\nat 341 (“Treaties for the protection of citizens of one coun-\ntry residing in the territory of another are numerous, and\nmake for good understanding between nations” (footnote\nomitted)).

UNITED STATES\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ngests that the Treaty Power conceals a police power over\ndomestic affairs.\n   Whatever its other defects, Missouri v. Holland, 252\nU. S. 416 (1920), is consistent with that view. There, the\nCourt addressed the constitutionality of a treaty that\nregulated the capture of birds that migrated between\nCanada and the United States. Convention with Great\nBritain for the Protection of Migratory Birds, Aug. 16,\n1916, 39 Stat. 1702, T. S. No. 628. Although the Court\nupheld a statute implementing that treaty based on an\nimproperly broad view of the Necessary and Proper\nClause, see ante, at 12–14 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg-\nment), Holland did not conclude that the Treaty Power\nitself was unlimited. See 252 U. S., at 433 (“We do not\nmean to imply that there are no qualifications to the\ntreaty-making power . . .”). To the contrary, the holding in\nHolland is consistent with the understanding that treaties\nare limited to matters of international intercourse. The\nCourt observed that the treaty at issue addressed mi-\ngratory birds that were “only transitorily within the State\nand ha[d] no permanent habitat therein.” Id., at 435; see\nalso id., at 434 (“[T]he treaty deals with creatures that\n[only] for the moment are within the state borders”). As\nsuch, the birds were naturally a matter of international\nintercourse because they were creatures in international\ntransit.2\n——————\n  2 The Solicitor General also defended the treaty in Holland on a basis\nthat recognized the limited scope of the Treaty Power. Acknowledging\nthat the Treaty Power addressed “matters in which a foreign govern-\nment may have an interest, and which may properly be the subject of\nnegotiations with that Government,” Brief for Appellee in Missouri v.\nHolland, O. T. 1919, No. 609, p. 41, the Solicitor General expressly\nreserved the question “[w]hether a treaty . . . for the protection of game\nwhich remains permanently within the United States would be a valid\nexercise of the treaty-making power.” Id., at 42.

See Golove 1288 (“[V]irtually every author-\nity, including the Supreme Court, has on countless occa-\nsions from the earliest days recognized general subject\nmatter limitations on treaties”). The Second Restatement\non the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, for\nexample, opined that the Treaty Power is available only if\nthe subject matter of the treaty “is of international con-\ncern.” §117(1)(a) (1964–1965). The Second Restatement\nexplained that a treaty “must relate to the external con-\ncerns of the nation as distinguished from matters of a\npurely internal nature.” Id., Comment b; see also Treaties\nand Executive Agreements: Hearings on S. J. Res. 1 before\na Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judici-\nary, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 183 (1955) (Secretary of State\nDulles) (Treaties cannot regulate matters “which do not\nessentially affect the actions of nations in relation to\ninternational affairs, but are purely internal”); Proceed-\nings of the American Society of International Law 194–196\n(1929) (C. Hughes) (“[The Treaty Power] is not a power\nintended to be exercised . . . with respect to matters that\nhave no relation to international concerns”). But see\nRestatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the\nUnited States §302, Comment c (“Contrary to what was\nonce suggested, the Constitution does not require that an\ninternational agreement deal only with ‘matters of inter-\nnational concern’ ”). At a minimum, the Second Restate-\nment firmly reflects the understanding shared by the\nFramers that the Treaty Power has substantive limits.\nOnly in the latter part of the past century have treaties\n\n——————\n regulations for the protection of birds which regularly migrate between\nthe United States and Canada”—the Solicitor General concluded that\nthe treaty concerned “a proper subject of negotiations.” Ibid.\n16                BOND v.

I ac-\nknowledge that the distinction between matters of in-\nternational intercourse and matters of purely domestic\nregulation may not be obvious in all cases. But this Court\nhas long recognized that the Treaty Power is limited, and\nhypothetical difficulties in line-drawing are no reason to\nignore a constitutional limit on federal power.\n  The parties in this case have not addressed the proper\nscope of the Treaty Power or the validity of the treaty\nhere. The preservation of limits on the Treaty Power is\nnevertheless a matter of fundamental constitutional im-\nportance, and the Court ought to address the scope of the\nTreaty Power when that issue is presented. Given the\nincreasing frequency with which treaties have begun to\ntest the limits of the Treaty Power, see Bradley 402–409,\nthat chance will come soon enough.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S. C. §229, the federal criminal statute under which she\nwas convicted. I therefore find it necessary to reach the\nquestion whether this statute represents a constitutional\nexercise of federal power, and as the case comes to us, the\nonly possible source of federal power to be considered is\nthe treaty power.\n  For the reasons set out in Parts I–III of JUSTICE\nTHOMAS’ concurring opinion, which I join, I believe that\nthe treaty power is limited to agreements that address\nmatters of legitimate international concern. The treaty\npursuant to which §229 was enacted, the Chemical Weap-\nons Convention, is not self-executing, and thus the Con-\nvention itself does not have domestic effect without con-\ngressional action. The control of true chemical weapons,\nas that term is customarily understood, is a matter of\ngreat international concern, and therefore the heart of the\nConvention clearly represents a valid exercise of the treaty\npower. But insofar as the Convention may be read to\nobligate the United States to enact domestic legislation\ncriminalizing conduct of the sort at issue in this case,\nwhich typically is the sort of conduct regulated by the\nStates, the Convention exceeds the scope of the treaty\n2                BOND v.

Argued November 5, 2013—Decided June 2, 2014\nTo implement the international Convention on the Prohibition of the\n  Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons\n  and on Their Destruction, Congress enacted the Chemical Weapons\n  Convention Implementation Act of 1998. The statute forbids, among\n  other things, any person knowingly to “possess[ ] or use . . . any\n  chemical weapon,” 18 U. S. C. §229(a)(1). A “chemical weapon” is “[a]\n  toxic chemical and its precursors, except where intended for a pur-\n  pose not prohibited under this chapter.” §229F(1)(A). A “toxic chem-\n  ical” is “any chemical which through its chemical action on life pro-\n  cesses can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm\n  to humans or animals. The term includes all such chemicals, regard-\n  less of their origin or of their method of production, and regardless of\n  whether they are produced in facilities, in munitions or elsewhere.”\n  §229F(8)(A). “[P]urposes not prohibited by this chapter” is defined as\n  “[a]ny peaceful purpose related to an industrial, agricultural, re-\n  search, medical, or pharmaceutical activity or other activity,” and\n  other specific purposes. §229F(7).\n     Petitioner Bond sought revenge against Myrlinda Haynes—with\n  whom her husband had carried on an affair—by spreading two toxic\n  chemicals on Haynes’s car, mailbox, and door knob in hopes that\n  Haynes would develop an uncomfortable rash. On one occasion\n  Haynes suffered a minor chemical burn that she treated by rinsing\n  with water, but Bond’s attempted assaults were otherwise entirely\n  unsuccessful. Federal prosecutors charged Bond with violating,\n  among other things, section 229(a). Bond moved to dismiss the chem-\n  ical weapons charges on the ground that the Act violates the Tenth\n  Amendment. When the District Court denied her motion, she plead-\n  ed guilty but reserved the right to appeal. The Third Circuit initially\n2                      BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    held that Bond lacked standing to raise her Tenth Amendment chal-\n    lenge, but this Court reversed. On remand, the Third Circuit rejected\n    her Tenth Amendment argument and her additional argument that\n    section 229 does not reach her conduct.\nHeld: Section 229 does not reach Bond’s simple assault. Pp. 8–21.\n    (a) The parties debate whether section 229 is a necessary and\n proper means of executing the Federal Government’s power to make\n treaties, but “normally [this] Court will not decide a constitutional\n question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the\n case.” Escambia County v. McMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51 (per curiam).\n Thus, this Court starts with Bond’s argument that section 229 does\n not cover her conduct. Pp. 8–9.\n    (b) This Court has no need to interpret the scope of the interna-\n tional Chemical Weapons Convention in this case. The treaty speci-\n fies that a signatory nation should implement its obligations “in ac-\n cordance with its constitutional processes.” Art. VII(1), 1974 U. N. T.\n S. 331. Bond was prosecuted under a federal statute, which, unlike\n the treaty, must be read consistent with the principles of federalism\n inherent in our constitutional structure. Pp. 10–21.\n      (1) A fair reading of section 229 must recognize the duty of “fed-\n eral courts to be certain of Congress’s intent before finding that fed-\n eral law overrides” the “usual constitutional balance of federal and\n state powers,” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460. This principle\n applies to federal laws that punish local criminal activity, which has\n traditionally been the responsibility of the States. This Court’s prec-\n edents have referred to basic principles of federalism in the Constitu-\n tion to resolve ambiguity in federal statutes. See, e.g., United States\n v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336; Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848. Here,\n the ambiguity in the statute derives from the improbably broad reach\n of the key statutory definition, given the term—“chemical weapon”—\n that is being defined, the deeply serious consequences of adopting\n such a boundless reading, and the lack of any apparent need to do so\n in light of the context from which the statute arose—a treaty about\n chemical warfare and terrorism, not about local assaults. Thus, the\n Court can reasonably insist on a clear indication that Congress in-\n tended to reach purely local crimes before interpreting section 229’s\n expansive language in a way that intrudes on the States’ police pow-\n er. Pp. 10–14.\n      (2) No such clear indication is found in section 229. An ordinary\n speaker would not describe Bond’s feud-driven act of spreading irri-\n tating chemicals as involving a “chemical weapon.” And the chemi-\n cals at issue here bear little resemblance to those whose prohibition\n was the object of an international Convention. Where the breadth of\n a statutory definition creates ambiguity, it is appropriate to look to\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

See Johnson v.\n  United States, 559 U. S. 133.\n    The Government’s reading of section 229 would transform a statute\n  concerned with acts of war, assassination, and terrorism into a mas-\n  sive federal anti-poisoning regime that reaches the simplest of as-\n  saults. In light of the principle that Congress does not normally in-\n  trude upon the States’ police power, this Court is reluctant to\n  conclude that Congress meant to punish Bond’s crime with a federal\n  prosecution for a chemical weapons attack. In fact, only a handful of\n  prosecutions have been brought under section 229, and most of those\n  involved crimes not traditionally within the States’ purview, e.g., ter-\n  rorist plots.\n    Pennsylvania’s laws are sufficient to prosecute assaults like\n  Bond’s, and there is no indication in section 229 that Congress in-\n  tended to abandon its traditional “reluctan[ce] to define as a federal\n  crime conduct readily denounced as criminal by the States,” Bass,\n  supra, at 349. That principle goes to the very structure of the Consti-\n  tution, and “protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary pow-\n  er.” Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___.

The\nnearly life-sized work depicts two lines of soldiers, blinded\nby mustard gas, clinging single file to orderlies guiding\nthem to an improvised aid station. There they would\nreceive little treatment and no relief; many suffered for\nweeks only to have the gas claim their lives. The soldiers\nwere shown staggering through piles of comrades too\nseriously burned to even join the procession.\n  The painting reflects the devastation that Sargent\nwitnessed in the aftermath of the Second Battle of Arras\nduring World War I. That battle and others like it led to\nan overwhelming consensus in the international commu-\nnity that toxic chemicals should never again be used as\nweapons against human beings. Today that objective is\nreflected in the international Convention on Chemical\nWeapons, which has been ratified or acceded to by 190\ncountries. The United States, pursuant to the Federal\nGovernment’s constitutionally enumerated power to make\n2                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntreaties, ratified the treaty in 1997. To fulfill the United\nStates’ obligations under the Convention, Congress en-\nacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation\nAct of 1998. The Act makes it a federal crime for a person\nto use or possess any chemical weapon, and it punishes\nviolators with severe penalties. It is a statute that, like\nthe Convention it implements, deals with crimes of deadly\nseriousness.\n  The question presented by this case is whether the\nImplementation Act also reaches a purely local crime: an\namateur attempt by a jilted wife to injure her husband’s\nlover, which ended up causing only a minor thumb burn\nreadily treated by rinsing with water. Because our consti-\ntutional structure leaves local criminal activity primarily\nto the States, we have generally declined to read federal\nlaw as intruding on that responsibility, unless Congress\nhas clearly indicated that the law should have such reach.\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act\ncontains no such clear indication, and we accordingly\nconclude that it does not cover the unremarkable local\noffense at issue here.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  In 1997, the President of the United States, upon the\nadvice and consent of the Senate, ratified the Convention\non the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stock-\npiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their De-\nstruction. S. Treaty Doc. No. 103–21, 1974 U. N. T.

Kenyon & D.\nFeakes eds. 2007) (Kenyon & Feakes). The atrocities of\nthat war led the community of nations to adopt the 1925\nGeneva Protocol, which prohibited the use of chemicals as\na method of warfare. Id., at 5.\n    Up to the 1990s, however, chemical weapons remained\nin use both in and out of wartime, with devastating conse-\nquences. Iraq’s use of nerve agents and mustard gas\nduring its war with Iran in the 1980s contributed to inter-\nnational support for a renewed, more effective chemical\nweapons ban. Id., at 6, 10–11. In 1994 and 1995, long-\nheld fears of the use of chemical weapons by terrorists\nwere realized when Japanese extremists carried out two\nattacks using sarin gas. Id., at 6. The Convention was\nconceived as an effort to update the Geneva Protocol’s\nprotections and to expand the prohibition on chemical\nweapons beyond state actors in wartime. Convention\nPreamble, 1974 U. N. T. S. 318 (the State Parties are\n“[d]etermined for the sake of all mankind, to exclude\ncompletely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons,\n. . . thereby complementing the obligations assumed under\nthe Geneva Protocol of 1925”). The Convention aimed to\nachieve that objective by prohibiting the development,\nstockpiling, or use of chemical weapons by any State Party\nor person within a State Party’s jurisdiction. Arts. I, II,\nVII. It also established an elaborate reporting process\nrequiring State Parties to destroy chemical weapons under\ntheir control and submit to inspection and monitoring by\nan international organization based in The Hague, Neth-\nerlands. Arts. VIII, IX.\n    The Convention provides:\n4                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    “(1) Each State Party to this Convention undertakes\n    never under any circumstances:\n      “(a) To develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stock-\n    pile or retain chemical weapons, or transfer, directly\n    or indirectly, chemical weapons to anyone;\n      “(b) To use chemical weapons;\n      “(c) To engage in any military preparations to use\n    chemical weapons;\n      “(d) To assist, encourage or induce, in any way, any-\n    one to engage in any activity prohibited to a State\n    Party under this Convention.” Art. I, id., at 319.\n“Chemical Weapons” are defined in relevant part as\n“[t]oxic chemicals and their precursors, except where\nintended for purposes not prohibited under this Conven-\ntion, as long as the types and quantities are consistent\nwith such purposes.” Art. II(1)(a), ibid. “Toxic Chemical,”\nin turn, is defined as “Any chemical which through its\nchemical action on life processes can cause death, tempo-\nrary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or\nanimals. This includes all such chemicals, regardless of\ntheir origin or of their method of production, and regard-\nless of whether they are produced in facilities, in muni-\ntions or elsewhere.” Art. II(2), id., at 320. “Purposes Not\nProhibited Under this Convention” means “[i]ndustrial,\nagricultural, research, medical, pharmaceutical or other\npeaceful purposes,” Art. II(9)(a), id., at 322, and other\nspecific purposes not at issue here, Arts. II(9)(b)–(d).\n   Although the Convention is a binding international\nagreement, it is “not self-executing.” W. Krutzsch & R.\nTrapp, A Commentary on the Chemical Weapons Conven-\ntion 109 (1994). That is, the Convention creates obliga-\ntions only for State Parties and “does not by itself give rise\nto domestically enforceable federal law” absent “imple-\nmenting legislation passed by Congress.” Medellín v.\nTexas, 552 U.

VII(1), 1974 U. N. T. S. 331. “In particular,” each\nState Party shall “[p]rohibit natural and legal persons\nanywhere . . . under its jurisdiction . . . from undertaking\nany activity prohibited to a State Party under this Con-\nvention, including enacting penal legislation with respect\nto such activity.” Art. VII (1)(a), id., at 331–332.\n  Congress gave the Convention domestic effect in 1998\nwhen it passed the Chemical Weapons Convention Imple-\nmentation Act. See 112 Stat. 2681–856. The Act closely\ntracks the text of the treaty: It forbids any person know-\ningly “to develop, produce, otherwise acquire, transfer\ndirectly or indirectly, receive, stockpile, retain, own, pos-\nsess, or use, or threaten to use, any chemical weapon.” 18\nU. S. C. §229(a)(1). It defines “chemical weapon” in rele-\nvant part as “[a] toxic chemical and its precursors, except\nwhere intended for a purpose not prohibited under this\nchapter as long as the type and quantity is consistent with\nsuch a purpose.” §229F(1)(A). “Toxic chemical,” in turn, is\ndefined in general as “any chemical which through its\nchemical action on life processes can cause death, tempo-\nrary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or\nanimals. The term includes all such chemicals, regardless\nof their origin or of their method of production, and re-\ngardless of whether they are produced in facilities, in\nmunitions or elsewhere.” §229F(8)(A). Finally, “purposes\nnot prohibited by this chapter” is defined as “[a]ny peace-\nful purpose related to an industrial, agricultural, research,\nmedical, or pharmaceutical activity or other activity,” and\nother specific purposes. §229F(7). A person who violates\nsection 229 may be subject to severe punishment: impris-\nonment “for any term of years,” or if a victim’s death re-\nsults, the death penalty or imprisonment “for life.”\n§229A(a).\n6                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n  Petitioner Carol Anne Bond is a microbiologist from\nLansdale, Pennsylvania. In 2006, Bond’s closest friend,\nMyrlinda Haynes, announced that she was pregnant.\nWhen Bond discovered that her husband was the child’s\nfather, she sought revenge against Haynes. Bond stole a\nquantity of 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine (an arsenic-based\ncompound) from her employer, a chemical manufacturer.\nShe also ordered a vial of potassium dichromate (a chemi-\ncal commonly used in printing photographs or cleaning\nlaboratory equipment) on Amazon.com. Both chemicals\nare toxic to humans and, in high enough doses, potentially\nlethal. It is undisputed, however, that Bond did not in-\ntend to kill Haynes. She instead hoped that Haynes would\ntouch the chemicals and develop an uncomfortable rash.\n  Between November 2006 and June 2007, Bond went to\nHaynes’s home on at least 24 occasions and spread the\nchemicals on her car door, mailbox, and door knob. These\nattempted assaults were almost entirely unsuccessful.\nThe chemicals that Bond used are easy to see, and Haynes\nwas able to avoid them all but once. On that occasion,\nHaynes suffered a minor chemical burn on her thumb,\nwhich she treated by rinsing with water. Haynes repeat-\nedly called the local police to report the suspicious sub-\nstances, but they took no action. When Haynes found\npowder on her mailbox, she called the police again, who\ntold her to call the post office. Haynes did so, and postal\ninspectors placed surveillance cameras around her home.\nThe cameras caught Bond opening Haynes’s mailbox,\nstealing an envelope, and stuffing potassium dichromate\ninside the muffler of Haynes’s car.\n  Federal prosecutors naturally charged Bond with two\ncounts of mail theft, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1708.\nMore surprising, they also charged her with two counts\nof possessing and using a chemical weapon, in violation\nof section 229(a). Bond moved to dismiss the chemical\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nweapon counts on the ground that section 229 exceeded\nCongress’s enumerated powers and invaded powers re-\nserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment. The District\nCourt denied Bond’s motion. She then entered a condi-\ntional guilty plea that reserved her right to appeal. The\nDistrict Court sentenced Bond to six years in federal\nprison plus five years of supervised release, and ordered\nher to pay a $2,000 fine and $9,902.79 in restitution.\n   Bond appealed, raising a Tenth Amendment challenge\nto her conviction. The Government contended that Bond\nlacked standing to bring such a challenge. The Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuit agreed. We granted certio-\nrari, the Government confessed error, and we reversed.\nWe held that, in a proper case, an individual may “assert\ninjury from governmental action taken in excess of the\nauthority that federalism defines.” Bond v. United States,\n564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (Bond I) (slip op., at 8). We “ex-\npresse[d] no view on the merits” of Bond’s constitutional\nchallenge. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   On remand, Bond renewed her constitutional argument.\nShe also argued that section 229 does not reach her con-\nduct because the statute’s exception for the use of chemi-\ncals for “peaceful purposes” should be understood in con-\ntradistinction to the “warlike” activities that the\nConvention was primarily designed to prohibit. Bond\nargued that her conduct, though reprehensible, was not at\nall “warlike.” The Court of Appeals rejected this argu-\nment. 681 F. 3d 149 (CA3 2012). The court acknowledged\nthat the Government’s reading of section 229 would render\nthe statute “striking” in its “breadth” and turn every\n“kitchen cupboard and cleaning cabinet in America into a\npotential chemical weapons cache.” Id., at 154, n. 7. But\nthe court nevertheless held that Bond’s use of “ ‘highly\ntoxic chemicals with the intent of harming Haynes’ can\nhardly be characterized as ‘peaceful’ under that word’s\ncommonly understood meaning.” Id., at 154 (citation\n8                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nomitted).\n   The Third Circuit also rejected Bond’s constitutional\nchallenge to her conviction, holding that section 229 was\n“necessary and proper to carry the Convention into effect.”\nId., at 162. The Court of Appeals relied on this Court’s\nopinion in Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920),\nwhich stated that “[i]f the treaty is valid there can be no\ndispute about the validity of the statute” that implements\nit “as a necessary and proper means to execute the powers\nof the Government,” id., at 432.\n   We again granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                              II\n  In our federal system, the National Government pos-\nsesses only limited powers; the States and the people\nretain the remainder. The States have broad authority to\nenact legislation for the public good—what we have often\ncalled a “police power.” United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.\n549, 567 (1995). The Federal Government, by contrast,\nhas no such authority and “can exercise only the powers\ngranted to it,” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405\n(1819), including the power to make “all Laws which shall\nbe necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the\nenumerated powers, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 18. For\nnearly two centuries it has been “clear” that, lacking a\npolice power, “Congress cannot punish felonies generally.”\nCohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 428 (1821). A criminal\nact committed wholly within a State “cannot be made an\noffence against the United States, unless it have some\nrelation to the execution of a power of Congress, or to some\nmatter within the jurisdiction of the United States.”\nUnited States v. Fox, 95 U. S. 670, 672 (1878).\n  The Government frequently defends federal criminal\nlegislation on the ground that the legislation is authorized\npursuant to Congress’s power to regulate interstate com-\nmerce. In this case, however, the Court of Appeals held\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the Government had explicitly disavowed that argu-\nment before the District Court. 681 F. 3d, at 151, n. 1. As\na result, in this Court the parties have devoted significant\neffort to arguing whether section 229, as applied to Bond’s\noffense, is a necessary and proper means of executing the\nNational Government’s power to make treaties. U. S.\nConst., Art. II, §2, cl. 2. Bond argues that the lower\ncourt’s reading of Missouri v. Holland would remove all\nlimits on federal authority, so long as the Federal Gov-\nernment ratifies a treaty first. She insists that to effec-\ntively afford the Government a police power whenever it\nimplements a treaty would be contrary to the Framers’\ncareful decision to divide power between the States and\nthe National Government as a means of preserving liberty.\nTo the extent that Holland authorizes such usurpation of\ntraditional state authority, Bond says, it must be either\nlimited or overruled.\n   The Government replies that this Court has never held\nthat a statute implementing a valid treaty exceeds Con-\ngress’s enumerated powers. To do so here, the Govern-\nment says, would contravene another deliberate choice of\nthe Framers: to avoid placing subject matter limitations\non the National Government’s power to make treaties.\nAnd it might also undermine confidence in the United\nStates as an international treaty partner.\n   Notwithstanding this debate, it is “a well-established\nprinciple governing the prudent exercise of this Court’s\njurisdiction that normally the Court will not decide a\nconstitutional question if there is some other ground upon\nwhich to dispose of the case.” Escambia County v. Mc-\nMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51 (1984) (per curiam); see also\nAshwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring). Bond argues that section 229 does not\ncover her conduct. So we consider that argument first.\n10                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             III\n\n  Section 229 exists to implement the Convention, so we\nbegin with that international agreement. As explained,\nthe Convention’s drafters intended for it to be a compre-\nhensive ban on chemical weapons. But even with its\nbroadly worded definitions, we have doubts that a treaty\nabout chemical weapons has anything to do with Bond’s\nconduct. The Convention, a product of years of worldwide\nstudy, analysis, and multinational negotiation, arose in\nresponse to war crimes and acts of terrorism. See Kenyon\n& Feakes 6. There is no reason to think the sovereign\nnations that ratified the Convention were interested in\nanything like Bond’s common law assault.\n  Even if the treaty does reach that far, nothing prevents\nCongress from implementing the Convention in the same\nmanner it legislates with respect to innumerable other\nmatters—observing the Constitution’s division of respon-\nsibility between sovereigns and leaving the prosecution of\npurely local crimes to the States. The Convention, after\nall, is agnostic between enforcement at the state versus\nfederal level: It provides that “[e]ach State Party shall, in\naccordance with its constitutional processes, adopt the\nnecessary measures to implement its obligations under\nthis Convention.” Art. VII(1), 1974 U. N. T. S. 331 (em-\nphasis added); see also Tabassi, National Implementation:\nArticle VII, in Kenyon & Feakes 205, 207 (“Since the\ncreation of national law, the enforcement of it and the\nstructure and administration of government are all sover-\neign acts reserved exclusively for [State Parties], it is not\nsurprising that the Convention is so vague on the critical\nmatter of national implementation.”).\n  Fortunately, we have no need to interpret the scope of\nthe Convention in this case. Bond was prosecuted under\nsection 229, and the statute—unlike the Convention—\nmust be read consistent with principles of federalism\ninherent in our constitutional structure.\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                             A\n   In the Government’s view, the conclusion that Bond\n“knowingly” “use[d]” a “chemical weapon” in violation of\nsection 229(a) is simple: The chemicals that Bond placed\non Haynes’s home and car are “toxic chemical[s]” as de-\nfined by the statute, and Bond’s attempt to assault\nHaynes was not a “peaceful purpose.” §§229F(1), (8), (7).\nThe problem with this interpretation is that it would\n“dramatically intrude[ ] upon traditional state criminal\njurisdiction,” and we avoid reading statutes to have such\nreach in the absence of a clear indication that they do.\nUnited States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 350 (1971).\n   Part of a fair reading of statutory text is recognizing\nthat “Congress legislates against the backdrop” of certain\nunexpressed presumptions. EEOC v. Arabian American\nOil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991). As Justice Frankfurter\nput it in his famous essay on statutory interpretation,\ncorrectly reading a statute “demands awareness of certain\npresuppositions.” Some Reflections on the Reading of\nStatutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947). For example,\nwe presume that a criminal statute derived from the\ncommon law carries with it the requirement of a culpable\nmental state—even if no such limitation appears in the\ntext—unless it is clear that the Legislature intended to\nimpose strict liability. United States v. United States\nGypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 437 (1978). To take another\nexample, we presume, absent a clear statement from\nCongress, that federal statutes do not apply outside the\nUnited States. Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd.,\n561 U. S. 247, 255 (2010). So even though section 229,\nread on its face, would cover a chemical weapons crime if\ncommitted by a U. S. citizen in Australia, we would not\napply the statute to such conduct absent a plain statement\nfrom Congress.1 The notion that some things “go without\n——————\n 1 Congress   has in fact included just such a plain statement in section\n12                    BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsaying” applies to legislation just as it does to everyday\nlife.\n    Among the background principles of construction that\nour cases have recognized are those grounded in the rela-\ntionship between the Federal Government and the States\nunder our Constitution. It has long been settled, for ex-\nample, that we presume federal statutes do not abrogate\nstate sovereign immunity, Atascadero State Hospital v.\nScanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 243 (1985), impose obligations on\nthe States pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U. S. 1, 16–17 (1981), or preempt state\nlaw, Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230\n(1947).\n    Closely related to these is the well-established principle\nthat “ ‘it is incumbent upon the federal courts to be certain\nof Congress’ intent before finding that federal law over-\nrides’ ” the “usual constitutional balance of federal and\nstate powers.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460\n(1991) (quoting Atascadero, supra, at 243). To quote\nFrankfurter again, if the Federal Government would\n“ ‘radically readjust[ ] the balance of state and national\nauthority, those charged with the duty of legislating [must\nbe] reasonably explicit’ ” about it. BFP v. Resolution Trust\nCorporation, 511 U. S. 531, 544 (1994) (quoting Some\nReflections, supra, at 539–540; second alteration in origi-\nnal). Or as explained by Justice Marshall, when legisla-\ntion “affect[s] the federal balance, the requirement of clear\nstatement assures that the legislature has in fact faced,\nand intended to bring into issue, the critical matters in-\nvolved in the judicial decision.” Bass, supra, at 349.\n\n——————\n229(c)(2): “Conduct prohibited by [section 229(a)] is within the jurisdic-\ntion of the United States if the prohibited conduct . . . takes place\noutside of the United States and is committed by a national of the\nUnited States.”\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

See Gregory, supra, at 460\n(qualifications for state officers); BFP, supra, at 544 (titles\nto real estate); Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.\nv. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 174 (2001)\n(land and water use). Perhaps the clearest example of\ntraditional state authority is the punishment of local\ncriminal activity. United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S.\n598, 618 (2000). Thus, “we will not be quick to assume\nthat Congress has meant to effect a significant change in\nthe sensitive relation between federal and state criminal\njurisdiction.” Bass, 404 U. S., at 349.\n   In Bass, we interpreted a statute that prohibited any\nconvicted felon from “ ‘receiv[ing], possess[ing], or\ntransport[ing] in commerce or affecting commerce . . . any\nfirearm.’ ” Id., at 337. The Government argued that the\nstatute barred felons from possessing all firearms and\nthat it was not necessary to demonstrate a connection to\ninterstate commerce. We rejected that reading, which\nwould “render[ ] traditionally local criminal conduct a\nmatter for federal enforcement and would also involve a\nsubstantial extension of federal police resources.” Id., at\n350. We instead read the statute more narrowly to re-\nquire proof of a connection to interstate commerce in every\ncase, thereby “preserv[ing] as an element of all the of-\nfenses a requirement suited to federal criminal jurisdic-\ntion alone.” Id., at 351.\n   Similarly, in Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 850\n(2000), we confronted the question whether the federal\narson statute, which prohibited burning “ ‘any . . . property\nused in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity\naffecting interstate or foreign commerce,’ ” reached an\nowner-occupied private residence. Once again we rejected\nthe Government’s “expansive interpretation,” under which\n“hardly a building in the land would fall outside the fed-\n14                    BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\neral statute’s domain.” Id., at 857. We instead held that the\nstatute was “most sensibly read” more narrowly to reach\nonly buildings used in “active employment for commercial\npurposes.” Id., at 855. We noted that “arson is a para-\ndigmatic common-law state crime,” id., at 858, and that\nthe Government’s proposed broad reading would “ ‘signifi-\ncantly change[ ] the federal-state balance,’ ” ibid. (quoting\nBass, 404 U. S., at 349), “mak[ing] virtually every arson in\nthe country a federal offense,” 529 U. S., at 859.\n  These precedents make clear that it is appropriate to\nrefer to basic principles of federalism embodied in the\nConstitution to resolve ambiguity in a federal statute. In\nthis case, the ambiguity derives from the improbably\nbroad reach of the key statutory definition given the\nterm—“chemical weapon”—being defined; the deeply\nserious consequences of adopting such a boundless read-\ning; and the lack of any apparent need to do so in light of\nthe context from which the statute arose—a treaty about\nchemical warfare and terrorism. We conclude that, in this\ncurious case, we can insist on a clear indication that Con-\ngress meant to reach purely local crimes, before interpret-\ning the statute’s expansive language in a way that in-\ntrudes on the police power of the States. See Bass, supra,\nat 349.2\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE SCALIA contends that the relevance of Bass and Jones to this\n\ncase is “entirely made up,” post, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment),\nbut not because he disagrees with interpreting statutes in light of\nprinciples of federalism. Rather, he says that Bass was a case where\nthe statute was unclear. We agree; we simply think the statute in this\ncase is also subject to construction, for the reasons given. As for Jones,\nJUSTICE SCALIA argues that the discussion of federalism in that case\nwas beside the point. Post, at 4. We do not read Jones that way; the\nCourt adopted the “most sensibl[e] read[ing]” of the statute, 529 U. S.,\nat 855, which suggests that other sensible readings were possible. In\narriving at its fair reading of the statute, the Court considered the\ndramatic extent to which the Government’s broader interpretation\nwould have expanded “the federal statute’s domain.” Id., at 857. We do\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014) \n          15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                                B\n\n   We do not find any such clear indication in section 229.\n“Chemical weapon” is the key term that defines the stat-\nute’s reach, and it is defined extremely broadly. But that\ngeneral definition does not constitute a clear statement\nthat Congress meant the statute to reach local criminal\nconduct.\n   In fact, a fair reading of section 229 suggests that it does\nnot have as expansive a scope as might at first appear. To\nbegin, as a matter of natural meaning, an educated user of\nEnglish would not describe Bond’s crime as involving a\n“chemical weapon.” Saying that a person “used a chemical\nweapon” conveys a very different idea than saying the\nperson “used a chemical in a way that caused some harm.”\nThe natural meaning of “chemical weapon” takes account\nof both the particular chemicals that the defendant used\nand the circumstances in which she used them.\n   When used in the manner here, the chemicals in this\ncase are not of the sort that an ordinary person would\nassociate with instruments of chemical warfare. The\nsubstances that Bond used bear little resemblance to the\ndeadly toxins that are “of particular danger to the objec-\ntives of the Convention.” Why We Need a Chemical\nWeapons Convention and an OPCW, in Kenyon & Feakes\n17 (describing the Convention’s Annex on Chemicals, a\nnonexhaustive list of covered substances that are subject\nto special regulation). More to the point, the use of some-\nthing as a “weapon” typically connotes “[a]n instrument of\noffensive or defensive combat,” Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 2589 (2002), or “[a]n instrument\nof attack or defense in combat, as a gun, missile, or\nsword,” American Heritage Dictionary 2022 (3d ed. 1992).\nBut no speaker in natural parlance would describe Bond’s\nfeud-driven act of spreading irritating chemicals on\n——————\nthe same here.\n16                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nHaynes’s door knob and mailbox as “combat.” Nor do the\nother circumstances of Bond’s offense—an act of revenge\nborn of romantic jealousy, meant to cause discomfort, that\nproduced nothing more than a minor thumb burn—\nsuggest that a chemical weapon was deployed in Norris-\ntown, Pennsylvania. Potassium dichromate and 10-chloro-\n10H-phenoxarsine might be chemical weapons if used, say,\nto poison a city’s water supply. But Bond’s crime is worlds\napart from such hypotheticals, and covering it would give\nthe statute a reach exceeding the ordinary meaning of the\nwords Congress wrote.\n  In settling on a fair reading of a statute, it is not un-\nusual to consider the ordinary meaning of a defined term,\nparticularly when there is dissonance between that ordi-\nnary meaning and the reach of the definition. In Johnson\nv. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 136 (2010), for example,\nwe considered the statutory term “ ‘violent felony,’ ” which\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act defined in relevant part as\nan offense that “ ‘has as an element the use . . . of physical\nforce against the person of another.’ ” Although “physical\nforce against . . . another” might have meant any force,\nhowever slight, we thought it “clear that in the context of\na statutory definition of ‘violent felony,’ the phrase ‘physi-\ncal force’ means violent force—that is, force capable of\ncausing physical pain or injury to another person.” Id., at\n140. The ordinary meaning of “chemical weapon” plays a\nsimilar limiting role here.\n  The Government would have us brush aside the ordi-\nnary meaning and adopt a reading of section 229 that\nwould sweep in everything from the detergent under the\nkitchen sink to the stain remover in the laundry room.\nYet no one would ordinarily describe those substances as\n“chemical weapons.”       The Government responds that\nbecause Bond used “specialized, highly toxic” (though\nlegal) chemicals, “this case presents no occasion to address\nwhether Congress intended [section 229] to apply to com-\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmon household substances.” Brief for United States 13,\nn. 3. That the statute would apply so broadly, however, is\nthe inescapable conclusion of the Government’s position:\nAny parent would be guilty of a serious federal offense—\npossession of a chemical weapon—when, exasperated by\nthe children’s repeated failure to clean the goldfish tank,\nhe considers poisoning the fish with a few drops of vine-\ngar. We are reluctant to ignore the ordinary meaning of\n“chemical weapon” when doing so would transform a\nstatute passed to implement the international Convention\non Chemical Weapons into one that also makes it a federal\noffense to poison goldfish. That would not be a “realistic\nassessment[ ] of congressional intent.” Post, at 6 (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in judgment).\n   In light of all of this, it is fully appropriate to apply the\nbackground assumption that Congress normally preserves\n“the constitutional balance between the National Govern-\nment and the States.” Bond I, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n10). That assumption is grounded in the very structure of\nthe Constitution. And as we explained when this case was\nfirst before us, maintaining that constitutional balance is\nnot merely an end unto itself. Rather, “[b]y denying any\none government complete jurisdiction over all the concerns\nof public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individ-\nual from arbitrary power.” Ibid.\n   The Government’s reading of section 229 would “ ‘alter\nsensitive federal-state relationships,’ ” convert an astonish-\ning amount of “traditionally local criminal conduct” into “a\nmatter for federal enforcement,” and “involve a substantial\nextension of federal police resources.” Bass, 404 U. S., at\n349–350. It would transform the statute from one whose\ncore concerns are acts of war, assassination, and terrorism\ninto a massive federal anti-poisoning regime that reaches\nthe simplest of assaults. As the Government reads section\n229, “hardly” a poisoning “in the land would fall outside\nthe federal statute’s domain.” Jones, 529 U. S., at 857. Of\n18                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourse Bond’s conduct is serious and unacceptable—and\nagainst the laws of Pennsylvania. But the background\nprinciple that Congress does not normally intrude upon\nthe police power of the States is critically important. In\nlight of that principle, we are reluctant to conclude that\nCongress meant to punish Bond’s crime with a federal\nprosecution for a chemical weapons attack.\n   In fact, with the exception of this unusual case, the\nFederal Government itself has not looked to section 229 to\nreach purely local crimes. The Government has identified\nonly a handful of prosecutions that have been brought\nunder this section. Brief in Opposition 27, n. 5. Most of\nthose involved either terrorist plots or the possession of\nextremely dangerous substances with the potential to\ncause severe harm to many people. See United States v.\nGhane, 673 F. 3d 771 (CA8 2012) (defendant possessed\nenough potassium cyanide to kill 450 people); United\nStates v. Crocker, 260 Fed. Appx. 794 (CA6 2008) (defend-\nant attempted to acquire VX nerve gas and chlorine gas as\npart of a plot to attack a federal courthouse); United States\nv. Krar, 134 Fed. Appx. 662 (CA5 2005) (per curiam) (de-\nfendant possessed sodium cyanide); United States v. Fries,\n2012 WL 689157 (D Ariz., Feb. 28, 2012) (defendant set off\na homemade chlorine bomb in the victim’s driveway,\nrequiring evacuation of a residential neighborhood). The\nFederal Government undoubtedly has a substantial inter-\nest in enforcing criminal laws against assassination, ter-\nrorism, and acts with the potential to cause mass suffer-\ning.     Those crimes have not traditionally been left\npredominantly to the States, and nothing we have said\nhere will disrupt the Government’s authority to prosecute\nsuch offenses.\n   It is also clear that the laws of the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania (and every other State) are sufficient to\nprosecute Bond. Pennsylvania has several statutes that\nwould likely cover her assault. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  19\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n§§2701 (2012) (simple assault), 2705 (reckless endanger-\nment), 2709 (harassment).3 And state authorities regularly\nenforce these laws in poisoning cases. See, e.g., Gamiz,\nFamily Survives Poisoned Burritos, Allentown, Pa., Morn-\ning Call, May 18, 2013 (defendant charged with assault,\nreckless endangerment, and harassment for feeding burri-\ntos poisoned with prescription medication to her husband\nand daughter); Cops: Man Was Poisoned Over 3 Years,\nHarrisburg, Pa., Patriot News, Aug. 12, 2012, p. A11\n(defendant charged with assault and reckless endanger-\nment for poisoning a man with eye drops over three years\nso that “he would pay more attention to her”).\n  The Government objects that Pennsylvania authorities\ncharged Bond with only a minor offense based on her\n“harassing telephone calls and letters,” Bond I, 564 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2), and declined to prosecute her for\nassault. But we have traditionally viewed the exercise of\nstate officials’ prosecutorial discretion as a valuable fea-\nture of our constitutional system. See Bordenkircher v.\nHayes, 434 U. S. 357, 364 (1978). And nothing in the\nConvention shows a clear intent to abrogate that feature.\nProsecutorial discretion involves carefully weighing the\nbenefits of a prosecution against the evidence needed to\nconvict, the resources of the public fisc, and the public\npolicy of the State. Here, in its zeal to prosecute Bond, the\nFederal Government has “displaced” the “public policy of\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, enacted in its capaci-\nty as sovereign,” that Bond does not belong in prison for a\nchemical weapons offense. Bond I, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12); see also Jones, supra, at 859 (Stevens, J., concur-\nring) (federal prosecution of a traditionally local crime\n——————\n  3 Pennsylvania also prohibits using “a weapon of mass destruction,”\n\nincluding a “chemical agent.” 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§2716(a), (i). Just as\nwe conclude that Bond’s offense cannot be fairly described as the use of\na chemical weapon, Pennsylvania authorities apparently determined\nthat her crime did not involve a “weapon of mass destruction.”\n20                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“illustrates how a criminal law like this may effectively\ndisplace a policy choice made by the State”).\n   As we have explained, “Congress has traditionally been\nreluctant to define as a federal crime conduct readily\ndenounced as criminal by the States.” Bass, 404 U. S., at\n349. There is no clear indication of a contrary approach\nhere. Section 229 implements the Convention, but Bond’s\ncrime could hardly be more unlike the uses of mustard gas\non the Western Front or nerve agents in the Iran-Iraq war\nthat form the core concerns of that treaty. See Kenyon &\nFeakes 6. There are no life-sized paintings of Bond’s rival\nwashing her thumb. And there are no apparent interests\nof the United States Congress or the community of nations\nin seeing Bond end up in federal prison, rather than dealt\nwith (like virtually all other criminals in Pennsylvania) by\nthe State. The Solicitor General acknowledged as much at\noral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47 (“I don’t think\nanybody would say [that] whether or not Ms. Bond is\nprosecuted would give rise to an international incident”).\n   This case is unusual, and our analysis is appropriately\nlimited. Our disagreement with our colleagues reduces to\nwhether section 229 is “utterly clear.” Post, at 5 (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in judgment). We think it is not, given that\nthe definition of “chemical weapon” in a particular case\ncan reach beyond any normal notion of such a weapon,\nthat the context from which the statute arose demon-\nstrates a much more limited prohibition was intended, and\nthat the most sweeping reading of the statute would fun-\ndamentally upset the Constitution’s balance between\nnational and local power. This exceptional convergence of\nfactors gives us serious reason to doubt the Government’s\nexpansive reading of section 229, and calls for us to inter-\npret the statute more narrowly.\n   In sum, the global need to prevent chemical warfare\ndoes not require the Federal Government to reach into the\nkitchen cupboard, or to treat a local assault with a chemi-\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Madison) (here-\n\ninafter The Federalist).\n2                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nconstitutional.\n  I would hold that it was not, and for that reason would\nreverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit.\n\n                 I. The Statutory Question\n            A. Unavoidable Meaning of the Text\n   The meaning of the Act is plain. No person may know-\ningly “develop, produce, otherwise acquire, transfer directly\nor indirectly, receive, stockpile, retain, own, possess, or\nuse, or threaten to use, any chemical weapon.” 18 U. S. C.\n§229(a)(1). A “chemical weapon” is “[a] toxic chemical and\nits precursors, except where intended for a purpose not\nprohibited under this chapter as long as the type and\nquantity is consistent with such a purpose.” §229F(1)(A).\nA “toxic chemical” is “any chemical which through its\nchemical action on life processes can cause death, tempo-\nrary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or\nanimals. The term includes all such chemicals, regardless\nof their origin or of their method of production, and re-\ngardless of whether they are produced in facilities, in\nmunitions or elsewhere.” §229F(8)(A). A “purpose not\nprohibited” is “[a]ny peaceful purpose related to an indus-\ntrial, agricultural, research, medical, or pharmaceutical\nactivity or other activity.” §229F(7)(A).\n   Applying those provisions to this case is hardly compli-\ncated.    Bond possessed and used “chemical[s] which\nthrough [their] chemical action on life processes can cause\ndeath, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm.”\nThus, she possessed “toxic chemicals.” And, because they\nwere not possessed or used only for a “purpose not prohib-\nited,” §229F(1)(A), they were “chemical weapons.” Ergo,\nBond violated the Act. End of statutory analysis, I would\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nhave thought.2\n  The Court does not think the interpretive exercise so\nsimple. But that is only because its result-driven antitex-\ntualism befogs what is evident.\n                B. The Court’s Interpretation\n   The Court’s account of the clear-statement rule reads\nlike a really good lawyer’s brief for the wrong side, relying\non cases that are so close to being on point that someone\neager to reach the favored outcome might swallow them.\nThe relevance to this case of United States v. Bass, 404\nU. S. 336 (1971), and Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848\n(2000), is, in truth, entirely made up. In Bass, we had to\ndecide whether a statute forbidding “ ‘receiv[ing], pos-\nsess[ing], or transport[ing] in commerce or affecting com-\nmerce . . . any firearm’ ” prohibited possessing a gun that\nlacked any connection to interstate commerce. 404 U. S., at\n337–339. Though the Court relied in part on a federalism-\ninspired interpretive presumption, it did so only after it\nhad found, in Part I of the opinion, applying traditional\ninterpretive tools, that the text in question was ambigu-\nous, id., at 339–347. Adopting in Part II the narrower of\nthe two possible readings, we said that “unless Congress\nconveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have\nsignificantly changed the federal-state balance.” Id., at\n349 (emphasis added). Had Congress “convey[ed] its\npurpose clearly” by enacting a clear and even sweeping\nstatute, the presumption would not have applied.\n——————\n  2 Petitioner offers one textual argument that the Court does not con-\n\nsider. She argues that the exception for “peaceful purposes” is best\nunderstood as a term of art meaning roughly any purpose that is not\n“warlike.”    Brief for Petitioner 50–57.      Though that reading is\nmore defensible than the Court’s, the Act will not bear it. If “peaceful”\nmeant “nonwarlike,” the statute’s exception for “any individual self-\ndefense device, including . . . pepper spray or chemical mace,” §229C—\nthe prosaic uses of which are surely nonwarlike—would have been\nunnecessary.\n4                     BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n    Jones is also irrelevant. To determine whether an owner-\noccupied private residence counted as a “ ‘property used\nin interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affect-\ning interstate or foreign commerce’ ” under the federal\narson statute, 529 U. S., at 850–851, our opinion examined\nnot the federal-jurisdiction-expanding consequences of\nanswering yes but rather the ordinary meaning of the\nwords—and answered no, id., at 855–857. Then, in a\nseparate part of the opinion, we observed that our reading\nwas consistent with the principle that we should adopt a\nconstruction that avoids “grave and doubtful constitutional\nquestions,” id., at 857, and, quoting Bass, the principle\nthat Congress must convey its purpose clearly before its\nlaws will be “ ‘deemed to have significantly changed the\nfederal-state balance,’ ” 529 U. S., at 858. To say that the\nbest reading of the text conformed to those principles is\nnot to say that those principles can render clear text\nambiguous.3\n    The latter is what the Court says today. Inverting Bass\nand Jones, it starts with the federalism-related conse-\nquences of the statute’s meaning and reasons backwards,\nholding that, if the statute has what the Court considers a\ndisruptive effect on the “federal-state balance” of criminal\njurisdiction, ante, at 14, that effect causes the text, even if\nclear on its face, to be ambiguous. Just ponder what the\nCourt says: “[The Act’s] ambiguity derives from the im-\nprobably broad reach of the key statutory definition . . .\nthe deeply serious consequences of adopting such a bound-\nless reading; and the lack of any apparent need to do so\n. . . .” Ibid.

Undoubtedly so, but\nundoubtedly beside the point, since the Act supplies its\nown definition of “chemical weapon,” which unquestiona-\nbly does bring Bond’s action within the statutory prohibi-\ntion. The Court retorts that “it is not unusual to consider\nthe ordinary meaning of a defined term, particularly when\nthere is dissonance between that ordinary meaning and\nthe reach of the definition.” Ante, at 16. So close to true!\nWhat is “not unusual” is using the ordinary meaning of\nthe term being defined for the purpose of resolving an\nambiguity in the definition. When, for example, “draft,” a\nword of many meanings, is one of the words used in a\ndefinition of “breeze,” we know it has nothing to do with\nmilitary conscription or beer. The point is illustrated by\nthe almost-relevant case the Court cites for its novel prin-\nciple, Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133 (2010).\nThere the defined term was “violent felony,” which the Act\ndefined as an offense that “ ‘has as an element the use . . .\nof physical force against the person of another.’ ” Id., at\n135 (quoting §924(e)(2)(B)(i)). We had to figure out what\n“physical force” meant, since the statute “d[id] not define”\nit. Id., at 138 (emphasis added). So we consulted (among\nother things) the general meaning of the term being de-\nfined, “violent felony.” Id., at 140.\n   In this case, by contrast, the ordinary meaning of the\nterm being defined is irrelevant, because the statute’s own\n6                  BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndefinition—however expansive—is utterly clear: any\n“chemical which through its chemical action on life proc-\nesses can cause death, temporary incapacitation or per-\nmanent harm to humans or animals,” §229F(8)(A), unless\nthe chemical is possessed or used for a “peaceful purpose,”\n§229F(1)(A), (7)(A). The statute parses itself. There is no\nopinion of ours, and none written by any court or put\nforward by any commentator since Aristotle, which says,\nor even suggests, that “dissonance” between ordinary\nmeaning and the unambiguous words of a definition is to\nbe resolved in favor of ordinary meaning. If that were the\ncase, there would hardly be any use in providing a defini-\ntion. No, the true rule is entirely clear: “When a statute\nincludes an explicit definition, we must follow that defini-\ntion, even if it varies from that term’s ordinary meaning.”\nStenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914, 942 (2000) (emphasis\nadded). Once again, contemplate the judge-empowering\nconsequences of the new interpretive rule the Court today\nannounces: When there is “dissonance” between the statu-\ntory definition and the ordinary meaning of the defined\nword, the latter may prevail.\n   But even text clear on its face, the Court suggests, must\nbe read against the backdrop of established interpretive\npresumptions. Thus, we presume “that a criminal statute\nderived from the common law carries with it the require-\nment of a culpable mental state—even if no such limita-\ntion appears in the text.” Ante, at 11. And we presume\nthat “federal statutes do not apply outside the United\nStates.” Ibid. Both of those are, indeed, established in-\nterpretive presumptions that are (1) based upon realistic\nassessments of congressional intent, and (2) well known to\nCongress—thus furthering rather than subverting genu-\nine legislative intent. To apply these presumptions, then,\nis not to rewrite clear text; it is to interpret words fairly, in\nlight of their statutory context. But there is nothing ei-\nther (1) realistic or (2) well known about the presumption\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe Court shoves down the throat of a resisting statute\ntoday. Who in the world would have thought that a defini-\ntion is inoperative if it contradicts ordinary meaning?\nWhen this statute was enacted, there was not yet a “Bond\npresumption” to that effect—though presumably Congress\nwill have to take account of the Bond presumption in the\nfuture, perhaps by adding at the end of all its definitions\nthat depart from ordinary connotation “and we really\nmean it.”\n           C. The Statute as Judicially Amended\n  I suspect the Act will not survive today’s gruesome\nsurgery. A criminal statute must clearly define the con-\nduct it proscribes. If it does not “ ‘give a person of ordi-\nnary intelligence fair notice’ ” of its scope, United States\nv. Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 123 (1979), it denies due\nprocess.\n  The new §229(a)(1) fails that test. Henceforward, a\nperson “shall be fined . . . , imprisoned for any term of\nyears, or both,” §229A(a)(1)—or, if he kills someone, “shall\nbe punished by death or imprisoned for life,” §229A(a)(2)—\nwhenever he “develop[s], produce[s], otherwise acquire[s],\ntransfer[s] directly or indirectly, receive[s], stockpile[s],\nretain[s], own[s], possess[es], or use[s], or threaten[s] to\nuse,” §229(a)(1), any chemical “of the sort that an ordinary\nperson would associate with instruments of chemical war­\nfare,” ante, at 15 (emphasis added). Whether that test is\nsatisfied, the Court unhelpfully (and also illogically) ex-\nplains, depends not only on the “particular chemicals that\nthe defendant used” but also on “the circumstances in\nwhich she used them.” Ibid. The “detergent under the\nkitchen sink” and “the stain remover in the laundry room”\nare apparently out, ante, at 16—but what if they are\ndeployed to poison a neighborhood water fountain? Poi-\nsoning a goldfish tank is also apparently out, ante, at 17,\nbut what if the fish belongs to a Congressman or Governor\n8                     BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand the act is meant as a menacing message, a small-time\nequivalent of leaving a severed horse head in the bed? See\nibid. (using the “concerns” driving the Convention—“acts\nof war, assassination, and terrorism”—as guideposts of\nstatutory meaning). Moreover, the Court’s illogical embel-\nlishment seems to apply only to the “use” of a chemical,\nante, at 15, but “use” is only 1 of 11 kinds of activity that\nthe statute prohibits. What, one wonders, makes some-\nthing a “chemical weapon” when it is merely “stockpile[d]”\nor “possess[ed]?” To these questions and countless others,\none guess is as bad as another.\n   No one should have to ponder the totality of the circum-\nstances in order to determine whether his conduct is a\nfelony. Yet that is what the Court will now require of all\nfuture handlers of harmful toxins—that is to say, all of us.\nThanks to the Court’s revisions, the Act, which before was\nmerely broad, is now broad and unintelligible. “[N]o\nstandard of conduct is specified at all.” Coates v. Cincin­\nnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614 (1971). Before long, I suspect,\ncourts will be required to say so.\n               II. The Constitutional Question\n  Since the Act is clear, the real question this case pre-\nsents is whether the Act is constitutional as applied to\npetitioner. An unreasoned and citation-less sentence from\nour opinion in Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920),\npurported to furnish the answer: “If the treaty is valid”—\nand no one argues that the Convention is not—“there can\nbe no dispute about the validity of the statute under Arti-\ncle I, §8, as a necessary and proper means to execute the\npowers of the Government.” Id., at 432.4 Petitioner and\n——————\n  4 Nineteen years earlier, the Court embraced a similar view—also\n\nwithout reasoning. See Neely v. Henkel, 180 U. S. 109, 121 (1901) (“The\npower of Congress to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying\ninto execution . . . all [powers] vested in the Government of the United\nStates . . . includes the power to enact such legislation as is appropriate\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     9\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nher amici press us to consider whether there is anything\nto this ipse dixit. The Constitution’s text and structure\nshow that there is not.5\n                           A. Text\n  Under Article I, §8, cl. 18, Congress has the power “[t]o\nmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for\ncarrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other\nPowers vested by this Constitution in the Government\nof the United States, or in any Department or Officer\nthereof.” One such “other Powe[r]” appears in Article II,\n§2, cl. 2: “[The President] shall have Power, by and with\nthe Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties,\nprovided two thirds of the Senators present concur.” Read\ntogether, the two Clauses empower Congress to pass laws\n“necessary and proper for carrying into Execution . . . [the]\nPower . . . to make Treaties.”\n  It is obvious what the Clauses, read together, do not say.\nThey do not authorize Congress to enact laws for carrying\ninto execution “Treaties,” even treaties that do not execute\nthemselves, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention.6\n——————\nto give efficacy to any stipulations which it is competent for the Presi-\ndent by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to insert in a\ntreaty with a foreign power”). There is also dictum arguably favorable\nto Holland in Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 619 (1842) (“[T]he\npower is nowhere in positive terms conferred upon Congress to make\nlaws to carry the stipulations of treaties into effect. It has been sup-\nposed to result from the duty of the national government to fulfill all\nthe obligations of treaties”). But see Mayor of New Orleans v. United\nStates, 10 Pet. 662, 736 (1836) (“The government of the United States\n. . . is one of limited powers. It can exercise authority over no subjects,\nexcept those which have been delegated to it. Congress cannot, by\nlegislation, enlarge the federal jurisdiction, nor can it be enlarged\nunder the treaty-making power”).\n    5 I agree with the Court that the Government waived its defense of\n\nthe Act as an exercise of the commerce power. Ante, at 8–9.\n    6 Non-self-executing treaties are treaties whose commitments do not\n\n“automatically have effect as domestic law,” Medellín v. Texas, 552\n10                   BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nSurely it makes sense, the Government contends, that\nCongress would have the power to carry out the obliga-\ntions to which the President and the Senate have commit-\nted the Nation. The power to “carry into Execution” the\n“Power . . . to make Treaties,” it insists, has to mean the\npower to execute the treaties themselves.\n   That argument, which makes no pretense of resting on\ntext, unsurprisingly misconstrues it. Start with the\nphrase “to make Treaties.” A treaty is a contract with a\nforeign nation made, the Constitution states, by the Presi-\ndent with the concurrence of “two thirds of the Senators\npresent.” That is true of self-executing and non-self-\nexecuting treaties alike; the Constitution does not distin-\nguish between the two. So, because the President and the\nSenate can enter into a non-self-executing compact with a\nforeign nation but can never by themselves (without the\nHouse) give that compact domestic effect through legisla-\ntion, the power of the President and the Senate “to make”\na Treaty cannot possibly mean to “enter into a compact\nwith a foreign nation and then give that compact domestic\nlegal effect.” We have said in another context that a right\n“to make contracts” (a treaty, of course, is a contract) does\nnot “extend . . . to conduct . . . after the contract relation\nhas been established . . . . Such postformation conduct\ndoes not involve the right to make a contract, but rather\nimplicates the performance of established contract obliga-\ntions.” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,\n177 (1989) (emphasis added).           Upon the President’s\nagreement and the Senate’s ratification, a treaty—no\nmatter what kind—has been made and is not susceptible\nof any more making.\n   How might Congress have helped “carr[y]” the power to\n——————\nU. S. 491, 504 (2008), and “can only be enforced pursuant to legislation\nto carry them into effect,” Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 194\n(1888).\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmake the treaty—here, the Chemical Weapons Conven-\ntion—“into Execution”? In any number of ways. It could\nhave appropriated money for hiring treaty negotiators,\nempowered the Department of State to appoint those\nnegotiators, formed a commission to study the benefits\nand risks of entering into the agreement, or paid for a\nbevy of spies to monitor the treaty-related deliberations of\nother potential signatories. See G. Lawson & G. Seidman,\nThe Constitution of Empire: Territorial Expansion and\nAmerican Legal History 63 (2004). The Necessary and\nProper Clause interacts similarly with other Article II\npowers: “[W]ith respect to the executive branch, the\nClause would allow Congress to institute an agency to\nhelp the President wisely employ his pardoning power\n. . . . Most important, the Clause allows Congress to estab-\nlish officers to assist the President in exercising his ‘execu-\ntive Power.’ ” Calabresi & Prakash, The President’s Power\nto Execute the Laws, 104 Yale L. J. 541, 591 (1994).\n    But a power to help the President make treaties is not a\npower to implement treaties already made. See generally\nRosenkranz, Executing the Treaty Power, 118 Harv.\nL. Rev. 1867 (2005). Once a treaty has been made, Con-\ngress’s power to do what is “necessary and proper” to\nassist the making of treaties drops out of the picture. To\nlegislate compliance with the United States’ treaty obliga-\ntions, Congress must rely upon its independent (though\nquite robust) Article I, §8, powers.\n                       B. Structure\n  “[T]he Constitutio[n] confer[s] upon Congress . . . not all\ngovernmental powers, but only discrete, enumerated\nones.” Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 919 (1997).\nAnd, of course, “enumeration presupposes something not\nenumerated.” Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824).\n  But in Holland, the proponents of unlimited congres-\nsional power found a loophole: “By negotiating a treaty\n12                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand obtaining the requisite consent of the Senate, the\nPresident . . . may endow Congress with a source of legis-\nlative authority independent of the powers enumerated in\nArticle I.” L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law §4–4,\npp. 645–646 (3d ed. 2000). Though Holland’s change to\nthe Constitution’s text appears minor (the power to carry\ninto execution the power to make treaties becomes the\npower to carry into execution treaties), the change to its\nstructure is seismic.\n   To see why vast expansion of congressional power is not\njust a remote possibility, consider two features of the\nmodern practice of treaty making. In our Nation’s early\nhistory, and extending through the time when Holland\nwas written, treaties were typically bilateral, and ad-\ndressed only a small range of topics relating to the obli-\ngations of each state to the other, and to citizens of the\nother—military neutrality, for example, or military alliance,\nor guarantee of most-favored-nation trade treatment. See\nBradley, The Treaty Power and American Federalism, 97\nMich. L. Rev. 390, 396 (1998). But beginning in the last\nhalf of the last century, many treaties were “detailed\nmultilateral instruments negotiated and drafted at inter-\nnational conferences,” ibid., and they sought to regulate\nstates’ treatment of their own citizens, or even “the activi-\nties of individuals and private entities,” A. Chayes & A.\nChayes, The New Sovereignty: Compliance with Interna-\ntional Regulatory Agreements 14 (1995). “[O]ften vague\nand open-ended,” such treaties “touch on almost every\naspect of domestic civil, political, and cultural life.” Brad-\nley & Goldsmith, Treaties, Human Rights, and Condi-\ntional Consent, 149 U. Pa. L. Rev. 399, 400 (2000).\n   Consider also that, at least according to some scholars,\nthe Treaty Clause comes with no implied subject-matter\nlimitations. See, e.g., L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the\nUnited States Constitution 191, 197 (2d ed. 1996); but see\nBradley, supra, at 433–439. On this view, “[t]he Tenth\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nAmendment . . . does not limit the power to make treaties\nor other agreements,” Restatement (Third) of Foreign\nRelations Law of the United States §302, Comment d, p.\n154 (1986), and the treaty power can be used to regulate\nmatters of strictly domestic concern, see id., at Comment\nc, p. 153; but see post, at 3–16 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment).\n   If that is true, then the possibilities of what the Federal\nGovernment may accomplish, with the right treaty in\nhand, are endless and hardly farfetched. It could begin, as\nsome scholars have suggested, with abrogation of this\nCourt’s constitutional rulings. For example, the holding\nthat a statute prohibiting the carrying of firearms near\nschools went beyond Congress’s enumerated powers,\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 551 (1995), could be\nreversed by negotiating a treaty with Latvia providing\nthat neither sovereign would permit the carrying of guns\nnear schools. Similarly, Congress could reenact the inval-\nidated part of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994\nthat provided a civil remedy for victims of gender-\nmotivated violence, just so long as there were a treaty on\npoint—and some authors think there already is, see\nMacKinnon, The Supreme Court, 1999 Term, Comment,\n114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, 167 (2000).\n   But reversing some of this Court’s decisions is the least\nof the problem. Imagine the United States’ entry into an\nAntipolygamy Convention, which called for—and Congress\nenacted—legislation providing that, when a spouse of a\nman with more than one wife dies intestate, the surviv-\ning husband may inherit no part of the estate. Constitu-\ntional? The Federalist answers with a rhetorical ques-\ntion: “Suppose by some forced constructions of its authority\n(which indeed cannot easily be imagined) the Federal\nLegislature should attempt to vary the law of descent in\nany State; would it not be evident that . . . it had exceeded\nits jurisdiction and infringed upon that of the State?” The\n14                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nFederalist No. 33, at 206 (A. Hamilton). Yet given the\nAntipolygamy Convention, Holland would uphold it. Or\nimagine that, to execute a treaty, Congress enacted a\nstatute prohibiting state inheritance taxes on real prop-\nerty. Constitutional? Of course not. Again, The Federalist:\n“Suppose . . . [Congress] should undertake to abrogate a\nland tax imposed by the authority of a State, would it not\nbe equally evident that this was an invasion of that con-\ncurrent jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax which\nits constitution plainly supposes to exist in the State\ngovernments?” No. 33, at 206. Holland would uphold it.\nAs these examples show, Holland places Congress only\none treaty away from acquiring a general police power.\n   The Necessary and Proper Clause cannot bear such\nweight. As Chief Justice Marshall said regarding it, no\n“great substantive and independent power” can be “im-\nplied as incidental to other powers, or used as a means of\nexecuting them.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316,\n411 (1819); see Baude, Rethinking the Federal Eminent\nDomain Power, 122 Yale L. J. 1738, 1749–1755 (2013).\nNo law that flattens the principle of state sovereignty,\nwhether or not “necessary,” can be said to be “proper.” As\nan old, well-known treatise put it, “it would not be a proper\nor constitutional exercise of the treaty-making power to\nprovide that Congress should have a general legislative\nauthority over a subject which has not been given it by the\nConstitution.” 1 W. Willoughby, The Constitutional Law\nof the United States §216, p. 504 (1910).\n   We would not give the Government’s support of the\nHolland principle the time of day were we confronted with\n“treaty-implementing” legislation that abrogated the\nfreedom of speech or some other constitutionally protected\nindividual right. We proved just that in Reid v. Covert,\n354 U. S. 1 (1957), which held that commitments made in\ntreaties with Great Britain and Japan would not permit\ncivilian wives of American servicemen stationed in those\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            15\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncountries to be tried for murder by court-martial. The\nplurality opinion said that “no agreement with a foreign\nnation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other\nbranch of Government, which is free from the restraints of\nthe Constitution.” Id., at 16.\n   To be sure, the Reid plurality purported to distinguish\nthe ipse dixit of Holland with its own unsupported ipse\ndixit. “[T]he people and the States,” it said, “have delegated\n[the treaty] power to the National Government [so] the\nTenth Amendment is no barrier.” 354 U. S., at 18. The\nopinion does not say why (and there is no reason why) only\nthe Tenth Amendment, and not the other nine, has been\n“delegated” away by the treaty power. The distinction\nbetween provisions protecting individual liberty, on the\none hand, and “structural” provisions, on the other, cannot\nbe the explanation, since structure in general—and espe-\ncially the structure of limited federal powers—is designed\nto protect individual liberty. “The federal structure . . .\nsecures the freedom of the individual. . . . By denying any\none government complete jurisdiction over all the concerns\nof public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individ-\nual from arbitrary power.” Bond v. United States, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9–10).\n   The Government raises a functionalist objection: If the\nConstitution does not limit a self-executing treaty to the\nsubject matter delineated in Article I, §8, then it makes no\nsense to impose that limitation upon a statute implement-\ning a non-self-executing treaty. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–33.\nThe premise of the objection (that the power to make self-\nexecuting treaties is limitless) is, to say the least, argua-\nble. But even if it is correct, refusing to extend that prop-\nosition to non-self-executing treaties makes a great deal of\nsense. Suppose, for example, that the self-aggrandizing\nFederal Government wishes to take over the law of intes-\ntacy. If the President and the Senate find in some foreign\nstate a ready accomplice, they have two options. First,\n16                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthey can enter into a treaty with “stipulations” specific\nenough that they “require no legislation to make them\noperative,” Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 194\n(1888), which would mean in this example something like\na comprehensive probate code. But for that to succeed, the\nPresident and a supermajority of the Senate would need to\nreach agreement on all the details—which, when once\nembodied in the treaty, could not be altered or superseded\nby ordinary legislation. The second option—far the better\none—is for Congress to gain lasting and flexible control\nover the law of intestacy by means of a non-self-executing\ntreaty. “[Implementing] legislation is as much subject to\nmodification and repeal by Congress as legislation upon\nany other subject.” Ibid. And to make such a treaty, the\nPresident and Senate would need to agree only that they\ndesire power over the law of intestacy.\n  The famous scholar and jurist Henry St. George Tucker\nsaw clearly the danger of Holland’s ipse dixit five years\nbefore it was written:\n     “[The statement is made that] if the treaty-making\n     power, composed of the President and Senate, in dis-\n     charging its functions under the government, finds\n     that it needs certain legislative powers which Con-\n     gress does not possess to carry out its desires, it may\n     . . . infuse into Congress such powers, although the\n     Framers of the Constitution omitted to grant them to\n     Congress. . . . Every reputable commentator upon the\n     Constitution from Story down to the present day, has\n     held that the legislative powers of Congress lie in\n     grant and are limited by such grant. . . .

See ante, at 1–2 (SCALIA, J., con-\ncurring in judgment). That aggrandizement of federal\npower cannot be justified as a “necessary and proper”\nmeans of implementing a treaty addressing similar subject\nmatter. See ante, at 8–9. To the contrary, reading the\nNecessary and Proper Clause to expand Congress’ power\nupon the ratification of every new treaty defies an indis-\nputable first principle of our constitutional order: “ ‘[T]he\nConstitution created a Federal Government of limited\npowers.’ ” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 155\n(1992) (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457\n(1991)). I accordingly join JUSTICE SCALIA’s opinion in\nfull.\n   I write separately to suggest that the Treaty Power is\nitself a limited federal power. Cf. United States v. Lopez,\n514 U. S. 549, 584 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (“[W]e\nalways have rejected readings of . . . the scope of federal\npower that would permit Congress to exercise a police\npower”). The Constitution empowers the President, “by\nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make\n2                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nTreaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present\nconcur.” Art. II, §2. The Constitution does not, however,\ncomprehensively define the proper bounds of the Treaty\nPower, and this Court has not yet had occasion to do so.\nAs a result, some have suggested that the Treaty Power is\nboundless—that it can reach any subject matter, even\nthose that are of strictly domestic concern. See, e.g., Re-\nstatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United\nStates, §302, Comment c (1986). A number of recent\ntreaties reflect that suggestion by regulating what appear\nto be purely domestic affairs. See, e.g., Bradley, The Treaty\nPower and American Federalism, 97 Mich. L. Rev. 390,\n402–409 (1998) (hereinafter Bradley) (citing examples).\n  Yet to interpret the Treaty Power as extending to every\nconceivable domestic subject matter—even matters with-\nout any nexus to foreign relations—would destroy the\nbasic constitutional distinction between domestic and\nforeign powers. See United States v. Curtiss-Wright Ex-\nport Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 319 (1936) (“[T]he federal power\nover external affairs [is] in origin and essential character\ndifferent from that over internal affairs . . .”). It would\nalso lodge in the Federal Government the potential for “a\n‘police power’ over all aspects of American life.” Lopez,\nsupra, at 584 (THOMAS, J., concurring). A treaty-based\npower of that magnitude—no less than a plenary power of\nlegislation—would threaten “ ‘ “the liberties that derive\nfrom the diffusion of sovereign power.” ’ ” Bond v. United\nStates, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9). And a\ntreaty-based police power would pose an even greater\nthreat when exercised through a self-executing treaty\nbecause it would circumvent the role of the House of Rep-\nresentatives in the legislative process. See The Federalist\nNo. 52, p. 355 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (noting that\nthe House has a more “immediate dependence on, & an\nintimate sympathy with the people”).\n  I doubt the Treaty Power creates such a gaping loophole\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Although the parties have\nnot challenged the constitutionality of the particular\ntreaty at issue here, in an appropriate case I believe the\nCourt should address the scope of the Treaty Power as it\nwas originally understood. Today, it is enough to high-\nlight some of the structural and historical evidence sug-\ngesting that the Treaty Power can be used to arrange\nintercourse with other nations, but not to regulate purely\ndomestic affairs.\n                              I\n   The Treaty Power was not drafted on a blank slate. To\nthe contrary, centuries of experience—reflected in treatises,\ndictionaries, and actual practice—shaped the contours of\nthat power.\n   Early treatises discussed a wide variety of treaties that\nnevertheless shared a common thread: All of them gov-\nerned genuinely international matters such as war, peace,\nand trade between nations. See, e.g., 2 H. Grotius, De\nJure Belli Ac Pacis 394–396 (1646 ed., F. Kelsey transl.\n1925) (treaties are made “for the sake either of peace or of\nsome alliance,” including “for the restoration of captives\nand of captured property, and for safety”; “that neither\nsignatory shall have fortresses in the territory of the\nother, or defend the subjects of the other, or furnish a\npassage to the enemy of the other”; and for “commercial\nrelations” and agreements on “import duties” (footnote\nomitted)); 2 S. Pufendorf, De Jure Naturae et Gentium\n1331 (1688 ed., C. Oldfather & W. Oldfather transls. 1934)\n(treaties are made “to form some union or society, the end\nof which is either commercial relations, or a united front\nin war”); 3 E. Vattel, The Law of Nations 165 (1758 ed., C.\nFenwick transl. 1916) (treaties, which “can be subdivided\ninto as many classes as there are varieties in the character\nof national relations,” “deal with conditions of commerce,\nwith mutual defense, with belligerent relations, with\n4                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nrights of passage, . . . stipulations not to fortify certain\nplaces, etc.”).\n   Founding-era dictionaries reflect a similar understand-\ning. To be sure, some early dictionaries briefly defined\n“treaty” simply as a “compact of accommodation relating to\npublic affairs.” See, e.g., 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 2056 (rev. 4th ed. 1773). More detailed\ndefinitions, however, recognized the particular character\nof treaties as addressing matters of intercourse between\nnations rather than domestic regulation. See, e.g., J.\nBuchanan, A New English Dictionary (1769) (defining\n“treaty” as “[a] covenant or agreement between several\nnations for peace, commerce, navigation, &c.”); N. Bailey,\nAn Universal Etymological English Dictionary (26th ed.\n1789) (same); J. Montefiore, A Commercial Dictionary\n(1803) (noting “treaties of alliance” for military aid; “trea-\nties of subsidy” for the provision of soldiers; treaties of\nnavigation and commerce; treaties governing fishing and\ntimber rights; and treaties on import duties); 2 N. Web-\nster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 97\n(1828) (noting “treaties for regulating commercial inter-\ncourse, treaties of alliance, offensive and defensive, trea-\nties for hiring troops, [and] treaties of peace”).\n   Treaty practice under the Articles of Confederation was\nalso consistent with the understanding that treaties gov-\nern matters of international intercourse. The Articles\nprovided: “The United States in Congress assembled, shall\nhave the sole and exclusive right and power of . . . entering\ninto treaties and alliances . . . .” Art. IX. The Congress of\nthe Confederation exercised that power by making treaties\nthat fell squarely within the traditional scope of the power.\nSee, e.g., Treaty with the Cherokee, Art. IV, Nov. 28,\n1785, 7 Stat. 19, 2 C. Kappler, Indian Affairs: Laws and\nTreaties 9 (1904) (territorial borders); Definitive Treaty of\nPeace, U. S.-Gr. Brit., Art. VII, Sept. 3, 1783, 8 Stat. 83,\nT.

No. 346\n(rights of citizens of one treaty partner residing in the\nterritory of the other).\n   These treaties entered into under the Articles of Con-\nfederation would not have suggested to the Framers that\ngranting a power to “make Treaties” included authoriza-\ntion to regulate purely domestic matters. Whenever these\ntreaties affected legal rights within United States territory,\nthey addressed only rights that related to foreign sub-\njects or foreign property. See, e.g., Treaty of Amity and\nCommerce, U. S.-Neth., Art. IV, Oct. 8, 1782, 8 Stat. 34\n(affording burial rights “when any subjects or inhabitants\nof either party shall die in the territory of the other”);\nTreaty with the Cherokee, Art. VII, 7 Stat. 19, 2 Kappler,\nsupra, at 10 (“If any citizen of the United States . . . shall\ncommit a robbery or murder, or other capital crime, on any\nIndian, such offender or offenders shall be punished in the\nsame manner as if [the crime] had been committed on a\ncitizen of the United States . . .”); Convention Relative to\nRecaptured Vessels, U.

Preconstitutional practice\ntherefore reflects the use of the treaty-making power only\nfor matters of international intercourse; that practice\n6                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nprovides no support for using treaties to regulate purely\ndomestic affairs.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Debates preceding the ratification of the proposed Con-\nstitution confirm the limited scope of the powers possessed\nby the Federal Government generally; the Treaty Power\nwas no exception. The Framers understood that most\nregulatory matters were to be left to the States. See The\nFederalist No. 45, at 313 (J. Madison) (“The powers dele-\ngated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Gov-\nernment, are few and defined”); see also Lopez, 514 U. S.,\nat 590–592 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (citing sources).\nConsistent with that general understanding of limited\nfederal power, evidence from the ratification campaign\nsuggests that the Treaty Power was limited and, in par-\nticular, confined to matters of intercourse with other\nnations.\n   In essays during the ratification campaign in New York,\nJames Madison took the view that the Treaty Power was\ninherently limited. The Federal Government’s powers,\nMadison wrote, “will be exercised principally on external\nobjects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign com-\nmerce”—the traditional subjects of treaty-making. The\nFederalist No. 45, at 313. If the “external” Treaty Power\ncontained a capacious domestic regulatory authority, that\nwould plainly conflict with Madison’s firm understanding\nthat “[t]he powers delegated by the proposed Constitution\nto the Federal Government, are few and defined.” Ibid.\nMadison evidently saw no conflict, however, because the\nTreaty Power included authority to “regulate the inter-\ncourse with foreign nations” rather than all domestic\naffairs. Id., No. 42, at 279.\n   Madison reiterated that understanding at the 1788\nVirginia ratifying convention, where the most extensive\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndiscussion of the proposed Treaty Power occurred, see\nBradley 410; Golove, Treaty-Making and the Nation, 98\nMich. L. Rev. 1075, 1141–1142 (2000) (hereinafter Golove).\nThere, Anti-Federalists leveled the charge that the Treaty\nPower gave the Federal Government excessive power.\nSee, e.g., 3 Debates on the Federal Constitution 509 (J.\nElliot 2d ed. 1876) (hereinafter Elliot’s Debates) (G. Ma-\nson) (“The President and Senate can make any treaty\nwhatsoever”); id., at 513 (P. Henry) (“To me this power\nappears still destructive; for they can make any treaty”).\nBut Madison insisted that just “because this power is\ngiven to Congress,” it did not follow that the Treaty Power\nwas “absolute and unlimited.” Id., at 514. The President\nand the Senate lacked the power “to dismember the em-\npire,” for example, because “[t]he exercise of the power\nmust be consistent with the object of the delegation.” Ibid.\n“The object of treaties,” in Madison’s oft-repeated formula-\ntion, “is the regulation of intercourse with foreign nations,\nand is external.” Ibid.\n   Although Alexander Hamilton undoubtedly believed\nthat the Treaty Power was broad within its proper sphere,\nsee infra, at 8, the view he expressed in essays during the\nNew York ratification campaign is entirely consistent with\nMadison’s. After noting that the Treaty Power was one of\nthe “most unexceptionable parts” of the proposed Consti-\ntution, Hamilton distinguished the Treaty Power from the\nlegislative power “to prescribe rules for the regulation of\nthe society” and from the executive power to “execut[e] . . .\nthe laws.” The Federalist No. 75, at 503–504. “The power\nof making treaties,” he concluded, “is plainly neither the\none nor the other.” Id., at 504. Rather, Hamilton ex-\nplained that treaties “are not rules prescribed by the\nsovereign to the subject, but agreements between sover-\neign and sovereign.” Id., at 504–505. That description is\ndifficult to square with a view of the Treaty Power that\nwould allow the Federal Government to prescribe rules\n8                  BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nover all aspects of domestic life.\n                              B\n   It did not escape the attention of the Framers that the\nTreaty Power was drafted without explicitly enumerated\nlimits on what sorts of treaties are permissible. See, e.g.,\nHamilton, The Defence No. XXXVI, in 20 Papers of Alex-\nander Hamilton 6 (H. Syrett ed. 1974) (“A power ‘to make\ntreaties,’ granted in these indefinite terms, extends to all\nkinds of treaties and with all the latitude which such a\npower under any form of Government can possess”). The\nArticles of Confederation had, for example, explicitly\nrestricted certain categories of treaties.      See Art. IX\n(“[N]o treaty of commerce shall be made whereby the legis-\nlative power of the respective States shall be restrained\nfrom imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners, as\ntheir own people are subjected to, or from prohibiting the\nexportation or importation of any species of goods or com-\nmodities whatsoever”). The Constitution omitted those\nrestrictions.\n   That decision was not a grant of unlimited power, but\nrather a grant of flexibility; the Federal Government\nneeded the ability to respond to unforeseeable varieties of\nintercourse with other nations. James Madison, for ex-\nample, did “not think it possible to enumerate all the cases\nin which such external regulations would be necessary.” 3\nElliot’s Debates 514; see also id., at 363 (E. Randolph)\n(“The various contingencies which may form the object of\ntreaties, are, in the nature of things, incapable of defini-\ntion”). But Madison nevertheless recognized that any\nexercise of the Treaty Power “must be consistent with the\nobject of the delegation,” which is “the regulation of inter-\ncourse with foreign nations.” Id., at 514; see also Hamil-\nton, The Defence, supra, at 6 (“[W]hatever is a proper\nsubject of compact between Nation & Nation may be em-\nbraced by a Treaty” (emphasis added)). That understand-\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ning of the Treaty Power did not permit the President and\nthe Senate to exercise domestic authority commensurate\nwith their substantial power over external affairs.\n                              C\n   The understanding that treaties are limited to, in Madi-\nson’s words, “the regulation of intercourse with foreign\nnations,” endured in the years after the Constitution was\nratified.\n   In 1796, an extended debate regarding the proper scope\nof the Treaty Power arose in the aftermath of a controver-\nsial treaty with Great Britain that addressed the validity\nof prerevolutionary debts and the property rights of Brit-\nish subjects. Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation,\nNov. 19, 1794, 8 Stat. 116, T. S. No. 105. When President\nWashington requested appropriations to implement that\nso-called “Jay Treaty” (after its chief negotiator, John Jay),\nthe House of Representatives engaged in a month-long\nfloor debate over its own role in the process of implement-\ning treaties. See 5 Annals of Cong. 426 (1796); see gener-\nally D. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: The Fed-\neralist Period 1789–1801, pp. 211–217 (1997). Some\nCongressmen argued that the House had a right to inde-\npendently review the merits of the treaty. See, e.g., 5\nAnnals of Cong. 427–428 (remarks of Rep. Livingston)\n(“[T]he House w[as] vested with a discretionary power of\ncarrying the Treaty into effect, or refusing it their sanc-\ntion”). Others insisted that “if the Treaty was the su-\npreme law of the land, then there was no discretionary\npower in the House, except on the question of its constitu-\ntionality.” Id., at 436–437 (Rep. Murray).\n   That latter group relied in part on the observation that\nthe Treaty Power was limited by its nature, and thus the\nConstitution’s failure to specify a role for the House did\nnot pose a mortal threat to that Chamber’s legislative\nprerogatives. Representative James Hillhouse of Connect-\n10                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nicut expounded that position in the floor debate. Hillhouse\nrecognized that the House had an “indispensable duty to\nlook into every Treaty” to ensure that it is constitutional,\ni.e., “whether it related to objects within the province of\nthe Treaty-making power, a power which is not unlim-\nited.” Id., at 660. He further explained that “[t]he objects\nupon which it can operate are understood and well de-\nfined, and if the Treaty-making power were to embrace\nother objects, their doings would have no more binding\nforce than if the Legislature were to assume and exercise\njudicial powers under the name of legislation.” Ibid.\n   Hillhouse “advert[ed] to the general definition of the\nTreaty-making power” to explain why the Treaty Power\nwas not a threat to the House’s legislative prerogatives:\n     “[I]f we look into our code of laws, we shall find few of\n     them that can be affected, to any great degree, by the\n     Treaty-making power. All laws regulating our own\n     internal police, so far as the citizens of the United\n     States alone are concerned, are wholly beyond its\n     reach; no foreign nation having any interest or con-\n     cern in that business, every attempt to interfere\n     would be a mere nullity, as much as if two individuals\n     were to enter into a contract to regulate the conduct\n     or actions of a third person, who was no party to such\n     contract.” Id., at 662.\nHe accordingly denied that “the President and Senate\nhav[e] it in their power, by forming Treaties with an Indian\ntribe or a foreign nation, to legislate over the United\nStates,” concluding instead that the Treaty Power “cannot\naffect the Legislative power of Congress but in a very\nsmall and limited degree.” Id., at 663.\n   Other Representatives who participated in the Jay\nTreaty debates agreed with Hillhouse that the Treaty\nPower had a limited scope. See, e.g., id., at 516 (Rep.\nSedgwick) (classifying the uses of the power as “1. To\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

To form contracts for mutual security or\ndefence; or to make Treaties, offensive or defensive. 3. To\nregulate an intercourse for mutual benefit, or to form\nTreaties of commerce”). James Madison, who opposed the\nJay Treaty as a Representative from Virginia, also took\nthe opportunity to reiterate his view that “the Treaty-\nmaking power was a limited power.” Id., at 777.\n   Other historical evidence from the postratification period\nis in accord. For example, Thomas Jefferson’s Senate\nManual of Parliamentary Procedure, drafted while he was\nVice President and therefore president of the Senate,\nBradley 415, noted the need for a treaty to have a nexus to\ninternational intercourse. If a treaty did not “concern the\nforeign nation, party to the contract,” then “it would be a\nmere nullity res inter alias acta.” Thomas Jefferson’s\nSenate Manual (1801), in 9 The Writings of Thomas Jef-\nferson 80–81 (H. Washington ed. 1861). Later, Justice\nStory likewise anchored the Treaty Power in intercourse\nbetween nations. J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitu-\ntion of the United States 552–553 (abr. ed. 1833). (“The\npower ‘to make treaties’ is by the constitution general; and\nof course it embraces all sorts of treaties, for peace or war;\nfor commerce or territory; for alliance or succours; for\nindemnity for injuries or payment of debts; for the recogni-\ntion or enforcement of principles of public law; and for any\nother purposes, which the policy or interests of independ-\nent sovereigns may dictate in their intercourse with each\nother”).\n   The touchstone of all of these views was that the Treaty\nPower is limited to matters of international intercourse.\nEven if a treaty may reach some local matters,1 it still\n——————\n  1 This point remains disputed.      Compare Bradley 456 (contending\nthat treaties should be subject “to the same federalism restrictions that\n12                  BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmust relate to intercourse with other nations. The Jay\nTreaty, for example, altered state property law, but only\nwith respect to British subjects, who could hold and devise\nreal property in the United States “in like manner as if\nthey were natives.” Art. IX, 8 Stat. 122. An 1815 treaty\nwith Great Britain was held to pre-empt a state law au-\nthorizing the seizure of “ ‘free negroes or persons of color’ ”\nat ports in part because the state law applied to British\nsailors. See Elkison v. Deliesseline, 8 F. Cas. 493, 495 (No.\n4, 366) (CC SC 1823) (Johnson, Circuit Justice). And\ntreaties with China and Japan, which afforded subjects of\nthose countries the same rights and privileges as citizens\nof other nations, were understood to pre-empt state laws\nthat discriminated against Chinese and Japanese subjects.\nSee, e.g., Baker v. Portland, 2 F. Cas. 472, 474 (No. 777)\n(CC Ore. 1879). Cf. Brief for United States 29, 33–38.\n  The postratification theory and practice of treaty-\nmaking accordingly confirms the understanding that\ntreaties by their nature relate to intercourse with other\nnations (including their people and property), rather than\nto purely domestic affairs.\n                            III\n  The original understanding that the Treaty Power was\nlimited to international intercourse has been well repre-\nsented in this Court’s precedents. Although we have not\nhad occasion to define the limits of the power in much\ndetail, we have described treaties as dealing in some\nmanner with intercourse between nations. See, e.g.,\nHolmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540, 569 (1840) (“The power to\nmake treaties . . . was designed to include all those sub-\njects, which in the ordinary intercourse of nations had\n——————\napply to Congress’s legislative powers”), with Golove 1077 (arguing\ntreaties can address “subjects that are otherwise beyond Congress’s\nlegislative powers”).\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

S. 453, 463\n(1891); see also Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U. S. 258, 266 (1890)\n(same); Asakura v. Seattle, 265 U. S. 332, 341 (1924)\n(same). Those cases identified certain paradigmatic in-\nstances of “intercourse” that were “proper negotiating\nsubjects” fit for treaty. See, e.g., Holmes, supra, at 569\n(“[T]he treaty-making power must have authority to de-\ncide how far the right of a foreign nation . . . will be recog-\nnised and enforced, when it demands the surrender of any\n[fugitive] charged with offences against it”); Geofroy, su-\npra, at 266 (“It is also clear that the protection which\nshould be afforded to the citizens of one country owning\nproperty in another, and the manner in which that prop-\nerty may be transferred, devised or inherited, are fitting\nsubjects for such negotiation and of regulation by mutual\nstipulations between the two countries”); Asakura, supra,\nat 341 (“Treaties for the protection of citizens of one coun-\ntry residing in the territory of another are numerous, and\nmake for good understanding between nations” (footnote\nomitted)). Nothing in our cases, on the other hand, sug-\n14                    BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ngests that the Treaty Power conceals a police power over\ndomestic affairs.\n   Whatever its other defects, Missouri v. Holland, 252\nU. S. 416 (1920), is consistent with that view. There, the\nCourt addressed the constitutionality of a treaty that\nregulated the capture of birds that migrated between\nCanada and the United States. Convention with Great\nBritain for the Protection of Migratory Birds, Aug. 16,\n1916, 39 Stat. 1702, T. S. No. 628. Although the Court\nupheld a statute implementing that treaty based on an\nimproperly broad view of the Necessary and Proper\nClause, see ante, at 12–14 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg-\nment), Holland did not conclude that the Treaty Power\nitself was unlimited. See 252 U. S., at 433 (“We do not\nmean to imply that there are no qualifications to the\ntreaty-making power . . .”). To the contrary, the holding in\nHolland is consistent with the understanding that treaties\nare limited to matters of international intercourse. The\nCourt observed that the treaty at issue addressed mi-\ngratory birds that were “only transitorily within the State\nand ha[d] no permanent habitat therein.” Id., at 435; see\nalso id., at 434 (“[T]he treaty deals with creatures that\n[only] for the moment are within the state borders”). As\nsuch, the birds were naturally a matter of international\nintercourse because they were creatures in international\ntransit.2\n——————\n  2 The Solicitor General also defended the treaty in Holland on a basis\nthat recognized the limited scope of the Treaty Power. Acknowledging\nthat the Treaty Power addressed “matters in which a foreign govern-\nment may have an interest, and which may properly be the subject of\nnegotiations with that Government,” Brief for Appellee in Missouri v.\nHolland, O. T. 1919, No. 609, p. 41, the Solicitor General expressly\nreserved the question “[w]hether a treaty . . . for the protection of game\nwhich remains permanently within the United States would be a valid\nexercise of the treaty-making power.” Id., at 42. Because the treaty at\nissue focused on creatures in international transit—it was “limited to\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

See Golove 1288 (“[V]irtually every author-\nity, including the Supreme Court, has on countless occa-\nsions from the earliest days recognized general subject\nmatter limitations on treaties”). The Second Restatement\non the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, for\nexample, opined that the Treaty Power is available only if\nthe subject matter of the treaty “is of international con-\ncern.” §117(1)(a) (1964–1965). The Second Restatement\nexplained that a treaty “must relate to the external con-\ncerns of the nation as distinguished from matters of a\npurely internal nature.” Id., Comment b; see also Treaties\nand Executive Agreements: Hearings on S. J. Res. 1 before\na Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judici-\nary, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 183 (1955) (Secretary of State\nDulles) (Treaties cannot regulate matters “which do not\nessentially affect the actions of nations in relation to\ninternational affairs, but are purely internal”); Proceed-\nings of the American Society of International Law 194–196\n(1929) (C. Hughes) (“[The Treaty Power] is not a power\nintended to be exercised . . . with respect to matters that\nhave no relation to international concerns”). But see\nRestatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the\nUnited States §302, Comment c (“Contrary to what was\nonce suggested, the Constitution does not require that an\ninternational agreement deal only with ‘matters of inter-\nnational concern’ ”). At a minimum, the Second Restate-\nment firmly reflects the understanding shared by the\nFramers that the Treaty Power has substantive limits.\nOnly in the latter part of the past century have treaties\n\n——————\n regulations for the protection of birds which regularly migrate between\nthe United States and Canada”—the Solicitor General concluded that\nthe treaty concerned “a proper subject of negotiations.” Ibid.\n16                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nchallenged that prevailing conception by addressing “mat-\nters that in the past countries would have addressed\nwholly domestically” and “purport[ing] to regulate the\nrelationship between nations and their own citizens,”\nBradley 396; see also ante, at 12 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\nBut even the Solicitor General in this case would not go\nthat far; he acknowledges that “there may well be a line to\nbe drawn” regarding “whether the subject matter of [a]\ntreaty is a proper subject for a treaty.” Tr. of Oral Arg.\n43:10–15.\n                         *    *     *\n  In an appropriate case, I would draw a line that respects\nthe original understanding of the Treaty Power. I ac-\nknowledge that the distinction between matters of in-\nternational intercourse and matters of purely domestic\nregulation may not be obvious in all cases. But this Court\nhas long recognized that the Treaty Power is limited, and\nhypothetical difficulties in line-drawing are no reason to\nignore a constitutional limit on federal power.\n  The parties in this case have not addressed the proper\nscope of the Treaty Power or the validity of the treaty\nhere. The preservation of limits on the Treaty Power is\nnevertheless a matter of fundamental constitutional im-\nportance, and the Court ought to address the scope of the\nTreaty Power when that issue is presented. Given the\nincreasing frequency with which treaties have begun to\ntest the limits of the Treaty Power, see Bradley 402–409,\nthat chance will come soon enough.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

S. C. §229, the federal criminal statute under which she\nwas convicted. I therefore find it necessary to reach the\nquestion whether this statute represents a constitutional\nexercise of federal power, and as the case comes to us, the\nonly possible source of federal power to be considered is\nthe treaty power.\n  For the reasons set out in Parts I–III of JUSTICE\nTHOMAS’ concurring opinion, which I join, I believe that\nthe treaty power is limited to agreements that address\nmatters of legitimate international concern. The treaty\npursuant to which §229 was enacted, the Chemical Weap-\nons Convention, is not self-executing, and thus the Con-\nvention itself does not have domestic effect without con-\ngressional action. The control of true chemical weapons,\nas that term is customarily understood, is a matter of\ngreat international concern, and therefore the heart of the\nConvention clearly represents a valid exercise of the treaty\npower. But insofar as the Convention may be read to\nobligate the United States to enact domestic legislation\ncriminalizing conduct of the sort at issue in this case,\nwhich typically is the sort of conduct regulated by the\nStates, the Convention exceeds the scope of the treaty\n2                BOND v.

Section 229 cannot be regarded as necessary and\nproper to carry into execution the treaty power, and ac-\ncordingly it lies outside Congress’ reach unless supported\nby some other power enumerated in the Constitution. The\nGovernment has presented no such justification for this\nstatute.\n   For these reasons, I would reverse petitioner’s convic-\ntion on constitutional grounds.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2676593/", "sha1": "e5b687d8054c5d4e31332c35ee3843e48f9508d8", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-053", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-02T08:00:33.142259"}
