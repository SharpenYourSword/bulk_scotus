CUELLAR DE OSORIO ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12\u2013930.      Argued December 10, 2013\u2014Decided June 9, 2014\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act permits qualifying U. S. citizens\n  and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) to petition for certain family\n  members to obtain immigrant visas. A sponsored individual, known\n  as the principal beneficiary, is placed into a \u201cfamily preference\u201d cate-\n  gory based on his relationship with the petitioner. 8 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7\u00a71153(a)(1)\u2013(4). The principal beneficiary\u2019s spouse and minor chil-\n  dren in turn qualify as derivative beneficiaries, \u201centitled to the same\n  status\u201d and \u201corder of consideration\u201d as the principal. \u00a71153(d). The\n  beneficiaries then become eligible to apply for visas in order of \u201cprior-\n  ity date\u201d\u2014that is, the date a petition was filed. \u00a71153(e)(1). Because\n  the immigration process often takes years or decades to complete, a\n  child seeking to immigrate may \u201cage out\u201d\u2014i.e., reach adulthood and\n  lose her immigration status\u2014before she reaches the front of the visa\n  queue. The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) sets forth a remedy\n  in that circumstance, providing that \u201c[i]f the age of an alien is deter-\n  mined . . . to be 21 years of age or older,\u201d notwithstanding certain al-\n  lowances for bureaucratic delay, \u00a7\u00a71153(h)(1)\u2013(2), \u201cthe alien\u2019s petition\n  shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the\n  alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the\n  original petition.\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3).\n     Respondents, principal beneficiaries who became LPRs, filed peti-\n  tions for their aged-out children, asserting that the newly filed peti-\n  tions should receive the same priority date as their original petitions.\n  Instead, U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) gave\n  the new petitions current priority dates. The District Court granted\n  the Government summary judgment, deferring to the Board of Immi-\n2                SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    gration Appeals\u2019 (BIA\u2019s) determination that only those petitions that\n    can be seamlessly converted from one family preference category to\n    another without the need for a new sponsor are entitled to conversion\n    under \u00a71153(h)(3). The en banc Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that\n    the provision unambiguously entitled all aged-out derivative benefi-\n    ciaries to automatic conversion and priority date retention.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n695 F. 3d 1003, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE KAGAN, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY and JUSTICE GINS-\n  BURG, concluded that the BIA\u2019s textually reasonable construction of\n  \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s ambiguous language was entitled to deference. Pp. 13\u2013\n  33.\n     (a) Because \u00a71153(h)(3) does not speak unambiguously to the issue\n  here, a court must defer to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation. See\n  Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467\n  U. S. 837, 844. The first clause of \u00a71153(h)(3) states a condition that\n  encompasses every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference peti-\n  tion. The second clause, however, does not easily cohere with the\n  first. It prescribes a remedy that can apply to only a subset of the\n  beneficiaries described in the first clause. This remedial prescription\n  directs immigration officials to take the alien\u2019s petition and convert it\n  from a category benefitting a child to an appropriate category for\n  adults, without any change in the petition, including its sponsor, or\n  any new filing. Moreover, this conversion is to be \u201cautomati[c]\u201d\u2014that\n  is, one involving no additional decisions, contingencies, or delays.\n  Thus, the only aliens who may benefit from \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s back half\n  are those for whom automatic conversion is possible.\n     The understanding that \u201cautomatic conversion\u201d entails nothing\n  more than picking up the petition from one category and dropping it\n  into another for which the alien now qualifies matches the exclusive\n  way immigration law used the term when \u00a71153(h)(3) was enacted.\n  See 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i)(1)\u2013(3) (2002). And Congress used the word \u201ccon-\n  version\u201d in the identical way elsewhere in the CSPA. See, e.g.,\n  \u00a7\u00a71151(f)(2), (3).\n     If the term meant more than that in \u00a71153(h)(3), it would under-\n  mine the family preference system\u2019s core premise: that each immi-\n  grant must have a qualified and willing sponsor. See \u00a7\u00a71154(a), (b).\n  If an original sponsor does not have a legally recognized relationship\n  with the aged-out derivative beneficiary, another sponsor, e.g., the\n  old principal beneficiary, must be swapped in for the alien to qualify\n  for a new family preference category. But immigration officials can-\n  not assume that a new sponsor is eligible and willing to petition on\n  the alien\u2019s behalf, given the numerous requirements the law imposes\n  on family preference petitioners. See, e.g., \u00a71154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II). Nei-\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nther can they figure out whether a valid sponsor exists unless he files\nand USCIS approves a new petition\u2014the very thing \u00a71153(h)(3) says\nis not required.\n   In any case, a new qualified sponsor will rarely exist at the requi-\nsite time. An alien is deemed to age out on \u201cthe date on which an\nimmigrant visa number became available for the alien\u2019s parent.\u201d\n\u00a71153(h)(1)(A). Since aging out triggers automatic conversion, the\ndate of automatic conversion is best viewed as the same. But at that\ntime, the aged-out beneficiary\u2019s parent cannot yet be a citizen or LPR,\nand so no new, qualified sponsor will be ready to step into the old\none\u2019s shoes.\n   On the above account, \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s second clause provides a reme-\ndy to those principal and derivative beneficiaries who had a qualify-\ning relationship with an LPR both before and after they aged out. In\ncontrast, aliens like respondents\u2019 children\u2014the nieces, nephews, and\ngrandchildren of the initial sponsors\u2014cannot qualify for \u201cautomatic\nconversion\u201d: they lacked a qualifying preference relationship with\nthe initial petitioner, and so cannot fit into a new preference category\nwithout obtaining a new sponsor.\n   The ambiguity created by \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s ill-fitting clauses left the\nBIA to choose how to reconcile the statute\u2019s different commands. It\nreasonably opted to abide by the inherent limits of \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s re-\nmedial clause, rather than go beyond those limits so as to match the\nsweep of the first clause\u2019s condition. When an agency thus resolves\nstatutory tension, ordinary principles of administrative deference re-\nquire this Court to defer. See National Assn. of Home Builders v. De-\nfenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 666. Pp. 13\u201322.\n   (b) Respondents take issue with the BIA\u2019s interpretation, but none\nof their contentions is persuasive. Pp. 22\u201333.\n     (1) Respondents aver that every aged-out beneficiary could be\nautomatically converted if immigration officials substituted new\nsponsors and managed the timing of conversion so that a new sponsor\nexisted on the relevant date. These administrative maneuvers are\nnot in keeping with the natural and long-established meaning of \u201cau-\ntomatic conversion,\u201d they require conversion to occur on a date that\nhas no connection to the alien\u2019s aging out, and they demand adminis-\ntrative juggling to make automatic conversion work. And that pains-\ntakingly managed process still cannot succeed because a derivative\u2019s\nparent may never become able to sponsor a visa\u2014and immigration\nofficials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has done so.\nPp. 22\u201327.\n     (2) Respondents argue that the word \u201cand\u201d in the second clause\nof \u00a71153(h)(3) indicates that priority date retention is a benefit whol-\nly independent of automatic conversion. But \u201cand\u201d does not neces-\n4                 SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    sarily disjoin two phrases, and context suggests that the instructions\n    work in tandem. In other statutory and regulatory provisions re-\n    specting \u201cconversions,\u201d retention of a priority date is conditional on a\n    conversion occurring. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71154(k)(1)\u2013(3). Respondent\u2019s read-\n    ing would make priority date retention conditional on something the\n    statute nowhere mentions. And it would engender unusual results\n    that, without some clearer statement, the Court cannot conclude that\n    Congress intended. Pp. 27\u201330.\n          (3) Finally, respondents contend that, assuming \u00a71153(h)(3) is\n    ambiguous, the BIA acted unreasonably in choosing the more restric-\n    tive reading. But the BIA\u2019s interpretation benefits from administra-\n    tive simplicity and fits with immigration law\u2019s basic first-come, first-\n    served rule. By contrast, respondents would scramble the priority\n    order Congress established by allowing aged-out derivative benefi-\n    ciaries, like respondents\u2019 sons and daughters, to enter the visa queue\n    ahead of beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR\n    for a far longer time. Pp. 31\u201333.\n       THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, agreed that the\n    BIA\u2019s interpretation was reasonable, but not because an agency has\n    authority to resolve direct conflicts within a statute. There is no con-\n    flict or internal tension in \u00a71153(h)(3). The first clause of the provi-\n    sion defines the persons potentially affected, but does not grant any-\n    thing to anyone. The particular benefit provided by the statute\u2014\n    automatic conversion and retention of priority date\u2014is found exclu-\n    sively in the second clause, and that relief requires, at minimum,\n    that an aged-out beneficiary have his own eligible sponsor who is\n    committed to providing financial support for the beneficiary. Beyond\n    that, Congress did not speak clearly to which petitions can be auto-\n    matically converted.       The BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of\n    \u00a71153(h)(3) is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory\n    terms, with the established meaning of automatic conversion in im-\n    migration law, and with the structure of the family-based immigra-\n    tion system.

ROSA-\n\n         LINA CUELLAR DE OSORIO ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 9, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN announced the judgment of the Court\nand delivered an opinion, in which JUSTICE KENNEDY and\nJUSTICE GINSBURG join.\n   Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71101 et seq., citizens and lawful permanent residents\n(LPRs) of the United States may petition for certain fam-\nily members\u2014spouses, siblings, and children of various\nages\u2014to obtain immigrant visas. Such a sponsored indi-\nvidual is known as the petition\u2019s principal beneficiary. In\nturn, any principal beneficiary\u2019s minor child\u2014meaning an\nunmarried child under the age of 21\u2014qualifies as a deriv-\native beneficiary, \u201centitled to the same [immigration]\nstatus\u201d and \u201corder of consideration\u201d as his parent.\n\u00a71153(d). Accordingly, when a visa becomes available to\nthe petition\u2019s principal beneficiary, one also becomes\navailable to her minor child.\n   But what happens if, sometime after the relevant peti-\ntion was filed, a minor child (whether a principal or a\nderivative beneficiary) has turned 21\u2014or, in immigration\n2              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                        Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nlingo, has \u201caged out\u201d? The immigration process may take\nyears or even decades to complete, due in part to bureau-\ncratic delays associated with reviewing immigration doc-\numents and in (still greater) part to long queues for the\nlimited number of visas available each year. So someone\nwho was a youngster at the start of the process may be an\nadult at the end, and no longer qualify for an immigration\nstatus given to minors. The Child Status Protection Act\n(CSPA), 116 Stat. 927, ensures that the time Government\nofficials have spent processing immigration papers will not\ncount against the beneficiary in assessing his status. See\n8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(h)(1). But even with that provision, the\nbeneficiary may age out solely because of the time he\nspent waiting in line for a visa to become available.\n   The question presented in this case is whether the\nCSPA grants a remedy to all aliens who have thus out-\npaced the immigration process\u2014that is, all aliens who\ncounted as child beneficiaries when a sponsoring petition\nwas filed, but no longer do so (even after excluding admin-\nistrative delays) by the time they reach the front of the\nvisa queue. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or\nBoard) said no. It interpreted the CSPA as providing\nrelief to only a subset of that group\u2014specifically, those\naged-out aliens who qualified or could have qualified as\nprincipal beneficiaries of a visa petition, rather than only\nas derivative beneficiaries piggy-backing on a parent. We\nnow uphold the Board\u2019s determination as a permissible\nconstruction of the statute.\n                           I\n\n                           A\n\n  An alien needs an immigrant visa to enter and perma-\nnently reside in the United States.

See \u00a7\u00a71151(a)\u2013(b). The most favored is for the\n\u201cimmediate relatives\u201d of U. S. citizens\u2014their parents,\nspouses, and unmarried children under the age of 21.\nSee \u00a7\u00a71151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1101(b)(1). Five other categories\u2014\ncrucial to this case, and often denominated \u201cpreference\u201d\ncategories\u2014are for \u201cfamily-sponsored immigrants,\u201d who\ninclude more distant or independent relatives of U. S.\ncitizens, and certain close relatives of LPRs.2 Specifically,\nthose family preference categories are:\n     F1: the unmarried, adult (21 or over) sons and daugh-\n     ters of U. S. citizens;\n     F2A: the spouses and unmarried, minor (under 21)\n     children of LPRs;\n     F2B: the unmarried, adult (21 or over) sons and\n     daughters of LPRs;\n     F3: the married sons and daughters of U.

S. citizens. See Brief for Petitioners 3, n. 1.\n  3 Immigrant visas can also go to aliens with special, marketable\n\nskills, see \u00a7\u00a71151(a)(2), 1153(b), or to aliens from countries with histori-\ncally low immigration to the United States, see \u00a7\u00a71151(a)(3), 1153(c).\nNone of the respondents here sought visas under those \u201cemployment-\nbased\u201d or \u201cdiversity\u201d categories.\n4             SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                      Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\n   The road to obtaining any family-based immigrant visa\nbegins when a sponsoring U. S. citizen or LPR files a\npetition on behalf of a foreign relative, termed the princi-\npal beneficiary. See \u00a7\u00a71154(a)(1)(A)(i), (a)(1)(B)(i)(I), (b); 8\nCFR \u00a7204.1(a)(1) (2014). The sponsor (otherwise known\nas the petitioner\u2014we use the words interchangeably)\nmust provide U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\n(USCIS) with evidence showing, among other things, that\nshe has the necessary familial relationship with the\nbeneficiary, see \u00a7\u00a7204.2(a)(2), (d)(2), (g)(2), and that she\nhas not committed any conduct disqualifying her from\nsponsoring an alien for a visa, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II) (barring an LPR from submitting a\npetition if she has committed certain offenses against\nminors). USCIS thereafter reviews the petition, and\napproves it if found to meet all requirements. See\n\u00a71154(b).\n   For a family preference beneficiary, that approval re-\nsults not in getting a visa then and there, but only in\ngetting a place in line. (The case is different for \u201cimmedi-\nate relatives\u201d of U. S. citizens, who can apply for and\nreceive a visa as soon as a sponsoring petition is ap-\nproved.) The law caps the number of visas issued each\nyear in the five family preference categories, see\n\u00a7\u00a71151(c)(1), 1152, 1153(a)(1)\u2013(4), and demand regularly\nexceeds the supply. As a consequence, the principal bene-\nficiary of an approved petition is placed in a queue with\nothers in her category (F1, F2A, or what have you) in\norder of \u201cpriority date\u201d\u2014that is, the date a petition was\nfiled with USCIS. See \u00a71153(e)(1); 8 CFR \u00a7204.1(b); 22\nCFR 42.53(a) (2013). Every month, the Department of\nState sets a cut-off date for each family preference category,\nindicating that visas (sometimes referred to by \u201cvisa\nnumbers\u201d) are available for beneficiaries with priority\ndates earlier than the cut-off. See 8 CFR \u00a7245.1(g)(1); 22\nCFR \u00a742.51(b). The system is thus first-come, first-served\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

C. \u00a7\u00a71153(d), (h). Accordingly, when a visa be-\ncomes available for the principal, one becomes available\nfor her spouse and minor children too. And that is so even\nwhen (as is usually but not always the case) the spouse\nand children would not qualify for any family preference\ncategory on their own. For example, the child of an F4\npetition\u2019s principal beneficiary is the niece or nephew of a\nU. S. citizen, and federal immigration law does not recog-\nnize that relationship. Nonetheless, the child can piggy-\nback on his qualifying parent in seeking an immigrant\nvisa\u2014although, as will be further discussed, he may not\nimmigrate without her. See 22 CFR \u00a740.1(a)(2); infra, at\n6, 20\u201321, 31\u201332.\n   Once visas become available, the principal and any\nderivative beneficiaries must separately file visa applica-\ntions. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71202(a). Such an application re-\nquires an alien to demonstrate in various ways her ad-\nmissibility to the United States. See, e.g., \u00a71182(a)\n(1)(A) (alien may not have serious health problems);\n\u00a71182(a)(2)(A) (alien may not have been convicted of cer-\ntain crimes); \u00a71182(a)(3)(B) (alien may not have engaged\nin terrorist activity). Notably, one necessary showing\ninvolves the U. S. citizen or LPR who filed the initial\npetition: To mitigate any possibility of becoming a \u201cpublic\ncharge,\u201d the visa applicant (whether a principal or de-\nrivative beneficiary) must append an \u201caffidavit of sup-\nport\u201d    executed     by    that     sponsoring   individual.\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(4)(C)(ii), 1183a(a)(1). Such an affidavit legally\ncommits the sponsor to support the alien, usually for at\n6               SCIALABBA v.

See \u00a71202(h).\nThe interviews for a principal and her children (or spouse)\nusually occur back-to-back, although those for the children\nmay also come later.4 The consular official will determine\nfirst whether the principal should receive a visa; if (but\nonly if) the answer is yes, the official will then consider the\nderivatives\u2019 applications. See 22 CFR \u00a7\u00a740.1(a)(2), 42.62,\n42.81(a). Provided all goes well, everyone exits the consu-\nlate with visas in hand\u2014but that still does not make them\nLPRs. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71154(e). Each approved alien must\nthen travel to the United States within a set time, undergo\ninspection, and confirm her admissibility. See \u00a7\u00a71201(c),\n1222, 1225(a)\u2013(b). Once again, a derivative\u2019s fate is tied to\nthe principal\u2019s: If the principal cannot enter the country,\nneither can her children (or spouse). See \u00a71153(d); 22 CFR\n\u00a740.1(a)(2).

See n. 1, supra. The immigration officer interviewing such\nan alien, upon finding her visa-eligible, may declare her an LPR on the\nspot. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71255(i)(2). But here too, the officer will not make\na derivative beneficiary an LPR unless and until he approves that\nstatus for the principal.

At the front\nend, many months may go by before USCIS approves the\ninitial sponsoring petition.6 On the back end, several\nadditional months may elapse while a consular official\nconsiders the alien\u2019s visa application and schedules an\ninterview.7 And the middle is the worst. After a sponsor-\ning petition is approved but before a visa application can\nbe filed, a family-sponsored immigrant may stand in line\nfor years\u2014or even decades\u2014just waiting for an immigrant\nvisa to become available. See, e.g., Dept. of State, Bureau\nof Consular Affairs, 9 Visa Bulletin, Immigrant Numbers\nfor December 2013 (Nov. 8, 2013).\n   And as the years tick by, young people grow up, and\nthereby endanger their immigration status. Remember\nthat not all offspring, but only those under the age of 21\ncan qualify as an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d of a U. S. citizen, or\nas the principal beneficiary of an LPR\u2019s F2A petition, or\n(most crucially here) as the derivative beneficiary of any\nfamily preference petition. See supra, at 3, 5. So an alien\neligible to immigrate at the start of the process (when a\nsponsor files a petition) might not be so at the end (when\nan immigration official reviews his documents for admis-\nsion). He may have \u201caged out\u201d of his original immigration\nstatus by the simple passage of time.\n   In 2002, Congress enacted the Child Status Protection\nAct (CSPA), 116 Stat. 927, to address the treatment of\nthose once-but-no-longer-minor aliens. One section of the\nAct neatly eliminates the \u201caging out\u201d problem for the\noffspring of U.

S.\ncitizen sponsored his entry, then Peter Pan-like, he re-\nmains young throughout the immigration process.\n   A different scheme\u2014and one not nearly so limpid\u2014\napplies to the offspring of LPRs and aliens who initially\nqualified as either principal beneficiaries of F2A petitions\nor derivative beneficiaries of any kind of family preference\npetition. Section 3 of the CSPA, now codified at 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71153(h), contains three interlinked paragraphs that\nmitigate the \u201caging out\u201d problem for those prospective\nimmigrants.

See supra, at 6\u20137. The months that\nelapse before USCIS personnel approve a family prefer-\nence petition (\u201cthe period during which the applicable\npetition described in paragraph (2) was pending\u201d) do not\ncount against an alien in determining his statutory \u201cage.\u201d\nNeither do the months a consular officer lets pass before\nadjudicating the alien\u2019s own visa application (the period\nafter \u201can immigrant visa number becomes available for\nsuch alien (or . . . [his] parent)\u201d). But the time in be-\ntween\u2014the months or, more likely, years the alien spends\nsimply waiting for a visa to become available\u2014is not\nsimilarly excluded in calculating his age: Every day the\nalien stands in that line is a day he grows older, under the\nimmigration laws no less than in life. And so derivative\nbeneficiaries, as well as principal beneficiaries of F2A\npetitions, can still \u201cage out\u201d\u2014in other words, turn 21,\nnotwithstanding \u00a71153(h)(1)\u2019s dual age adjustments\u2014\nprior to receiving an opportunity to immigrate.\n  What happens then (if anything) is the subject of\n\u00a71153(h)\u2019s third paragraph\u2014the provision at issue in this\ncase. That paragraph states:\n       \u201cIf the age of an alien is determined under para-\n     graph (1) to be 21 years of age or older for the purposes\n     of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d) of this section, the\n     alien\u2019s petition shall automatically be converted to the\n     appropriate category and the alien shall retain the\n     original priority date issued upon receipt of the origi-\n     nal petition.\u201d\nThe provision thus first references the aged-out beneficiar-\nies of family preference petitions, and then directs immi-\ngration officials to do something whose meaning this\nopinion will further consider\u2014i.e., \u201cautomatically convert\u201d\nan alien\u2019s petition to an \u201cappropriate category.\u201d\n  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) addressed the\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Dec.\n28 (2009); its interpretation there is what we review in\nthis case. Wang was the principal beneficiary of an F4\npetition that his sister, a U. S. citizen, filed in 1992. At\nthat time, Wang\u2019s daughter was 10 years old, and thus\nqualified as a derivative beneficiary. But Wang waited in\nline for a visa for more than a decade, and by the time his\npriority date finally came up, his daughter had turned 22\n(even after applying \u00a71153(h)(1)\u2019s age-reduction formula).\nWang thus obtained a visa for himself, boarded a plane\nalone, and entered the United States as an LPR. He then\nfiled a new preference petition on his daughter\u2019s behalf\u2014\nthis one under F2B, the category for LPRs\u2019 adult sons and\ndaughters. USCIS approved that petition, with a priority\ndate corresponding to the date of Wang\u2019s filing. Wang\ncontended that under \u00a71153(h)(3), his daughter was in-\nstead entitled to \u201cretain the original priority date\u201d given to\nhis sister\u2019s old F4 petition, because that petition could\n\u201cautomatically be converted\u201d to the F2B category.\n   The Board rejected that argument. It explained that\n\u201cthe language of [\u00a71153(h)(3)] does not expressly state\nwhich petitions qualify for automatic conversion and\nretention of priority dates.\u201d Id., at 33. Given that \u201cambi-\nguity,\u201d the BIA looked to the \u201crecognized meaning\u201d of \u201cthe\nphrase \u2018automatic conversion\u2019 \u201d in immigration statutes\nand regulations\u2014which it \u201cpresume[d]\u201d Congress under-\nstood when enacting the CSPA. Id., at 33\u201335. \u201cHistorically,\u201d\nthe BIA showed, that language applied only when a\npetition could move seamlessly from one family preference\ncategory to another\u2014not when a new sponsor was needed\nto fit a beneficiary into a different category. Id., at 35.\nSome aged-out aliens\u2019 petitions could accomplish that\nmaneuver, because the alien had a qualifying relationship\nwith the original sponsor, and continued to do so upon\naging out; in that event, the Board held, \u00a71153(h)(3) en-\nsured that the alien would retain his original priority date.\n12           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nSee id., at 34\u201335. But the F4 petition filed by Wang\u2019s\nsister could not \u201cautomatically be converted\u201d in that way\nbecause Wang\u2019s daughter never had a qualifying relation-\nship with the sponsor: \u201c[N]o category exists for the niece of\na United States citizen.\u201d Id., at 35\u201336. That is why Wang\nhimself had to file a new petition on his daughter\u2019s behalf\nonce she aged out and could no longer ride on his sibling\nstatus. The Board saw no evidence that Congress meant\n\u201cto expand the use of the concept[ ] of automatic conver-\nsion\u201d to reach such a case. Id., at 36. And the Board\nthought such an expansion unwarranted because it would\nallow aliens like Wang\u2019s daughter, who lacked any inde-\npendent entitlement to a visa during the years her father\nspent standing on the F4 queue, to \u201ccut[ ] in line ahead of\nothers awaiting visas in other preference categories.\u201d Id.,\nat 38.\n                               C\n   The respondents in this case are similarly situated to\nWang, and they seek the same relief. Each was once the\nprincipal beneficiary of either an F3 petition filed by a\nU. S. citizen parent or an F4 petition filed by a U. S. citi-\nzen sibling. Each also has a son or daughter who, on the\ndate of filing, was under 21 and thus qualified as a deriva-\ntive beneficiary of the petition. But as was true of Wang\u2019s\ndaughter, the respondents\u2019 offspring had all turned 21\n(even accounting for \u00a71153(h)(1)\u2019s age adjustments) by the\ntime visas became available. Accordingly, the respondents\nimmigrated to the United States alone and, as new LPRs,\nfiled F2B petitions for their sons and daughters. Each\nargued that under \u00a71153(h)(3), those petitions should get\nthe same priority date as the original F3 and F4 petitions\nonce had. USCIS instead gave the new F2B petitions\ncurrent priority dates, meaning that the sons and daugh-\nters could not leapfrog over others in the F2B line.\n   This case began as two separate suits, one joining many\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

In each suit, the District Court deferred to the\nBIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71153(h)(3) in Wang, and accord-\ningly granted summary judgment to the Government. See\nZhang v. Napolitano, 663 F. Supp. 2d 913, 919 (CD Cal.\n2009); Costelo v. Chertoff, No. SA08\u201300688, 2009 WL\n4030516 (CD Cal., Nov. 10, 2009). After consolidating the\ntwo cases on appeal, a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed:\nLike the lower courts, it found \u00a71153(h)(3) ambiguous and\nacceded to the BIA\u2019s construction. 656 F. 3d 954, 965\u2013966\n(2011). The Ninth Circuit then granted rehearing en banc\nand reversed in a 6-to-5 decision. 695 F. 3d 1003 (2012).\nThe majority concluded that \u201cthe plain language of the\nCSPA unambiguously grants automatic conversion and\npriority date retention to [all] aged-out derivative benefi-\nciaries,\u201d and that the Board\u2019s contrary conclusion \u201cis not\nentitled to deference.\u201d Id., at 1006.\n  We granted certiorari, 570 U.

See Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837, 842\u2013844 (1984); INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S.\n415, 424\u2013425 (1999).

CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nagree with the \u201ccomplexity\u201d point.) Under Chevron, the\nstatute\u2019s plain meaning controls, whatever the Board\nmight have to say. See 467 U. S., at 842\u2013843. But if the\nlaw does not speak clearly to the question at issue, a court\nmust defer to the Board\u2019s reasonable interpretation, ra-\nther than substitute its own reading. Id., at 844.\n   And \u00a71153(h)(3) does not speak unambiguously to the\nissue here\u2014or more precisely put, it addresses that issue\nin divergent ways. We might call the provision Janus-\nfaced. Its first half looks in one direction, toward the\nsweeping relief the respondents propose, which would\nreach every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference\npetition. But as the BIA recognized, and we will further\nexplain, the section\u2019s second half looks another way, to-\nward a remedy that can apply to only a subset of those\nbeneficiaries\u2014and one not including the respondents\u2019\noffspring. The two faces of the statute do not easily cohere\nwith each other: Read either most naturally, and the other\nappears to mean not what it says. That internal tension\nmakes possible alternative reasonable constructions,\nbringing into correspondence in one way or another the\nsection\u2019s different parts. And when that is so, Chevron\ndictates that a court defer to the agency\u2019s choice\u2014here, to\nthe Board\u2019s expert judgment about which interpretation\nfits best with, and makes most sense of, the statutory\nscheme.\n   Begin by reading the statute from the top\u2014the part\nfavoring the respondents.

That is because all those beneficiaries have had their\nages \u201cdetermined under paragraph (1)\u201d (and have come up\nwanting): Recall that the age formula of \u00a71153(h)(1) ap-\nplies to each alien child who originally qualified (under\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

On its own, then, \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s\nopening clause encompasses the respondents\u2019 sons and\ndaughters, along with every other once-young beneficiary\nof a family preference petition now on the wrong side of\n21. If the next phrase said something like \u201cthe alien shall\nbe treated as though still a minor\u201d (much as the CSPA did\nto ensure U. S. citizens\u2019 children, qualifying as \u201cimmediate\nrelatives,\u201d would stay forever young, see supra, at 7\u20138), all\nthose aged-out beneficiaries would prevail in this case.\n   But read on, because \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s second clause instead\nprescribes a remedy containing its own limitation on the\neligible class of recipients. \u201c[T]he alien\u2019s petition,\u201d that\npart provides, \u201cshall automatically be converted to the\nappropriate category and the alien shall retain the origi-\nnal priority date.\u201d That statement directs immigration\nofficials to take the initial petition benefitting an alien\nchild, and now that he has turned 21, \u201cconvert[ ]\u201d that\nsame petition from a category for children to an \u201cappropri-\nate category\u201d for adults (while letting him keep the old\npriority date). The \u201cconversion,\u201d in other words, is merely\nfrom one category to another; it does not entail any change\nin the petition, including its sponsor, let alone any new\nfiling. And more, that category shift is to be \u201cautomatic\u201d\u2014\nthat is, one involving no additional decisions, contingen-\ncies, or delays. See, e.g., Random House Webster\u2019s Una-\nbridged Dictionary 140 (2d ed. 2001) (defining \u201cautomatic\u201d\nas \u201chaving the capability of starting, operating, moving,\netc., independently\u201d); The American Heritage Dictionary\n122 (4th ed. 2000) (\u201c[a]cting or operating in a manner\nessentially independent of external influence\u201d). The oper-\nation described is, then, a mechanical cut-and-paste job\u2014\nmoving a petition, without any substantive alteration,\nfrom one (no-longer-appropriate, child-based) category to\nanother (now-appropriate, adult) compartment. And so\n16              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                          Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nthe aliens who may benefit from \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s back half\nare only those for whom that procedure is possible. The\nclause offers relief not to every aged-out beneficiary, but\njust to those covered by petitions that can roll over, seam-\nlessly and promptly, into a category for adult relatives.\n   That understanding of \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s \u201cautomatic conver-\nsion\u201d language matches the exclusive way immigration\nlaw used the term when Congress enacted the CSPA. For\nmany years before then (as today), a regulation entitled\n\u201cAutomatic conversion of preference classification\u201d in-\nstructed immigration officials to change the preference\ncategory of a petition\u2019s principal beneficiary when either\nhis or his sponsor\u2019s status changed in specified ways. See\n8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7204.2(i)(1)\u2013(3) (2002). For example, the regula-\ntion provided that when a U. S. citizen\u2019s child aged out, his\n\u201cimmediate relative\u201d petition converted to an F1 petition,\nwith his original priority date left intact. See \u00a7204.2(i)(2).\nSimilarly, when a U. S. citizen\u2019s adult son married, his\noriginal petition migrated from F1 to F3, see \u00a7204.2(i)\n(1)(i); when, conversely, such a person divorced, his peti-\ntion converted from F3 to F1, see \u00a7204.2(i)(1)(iii); and\nwhen a minor child\u2019s LPR parent became a citizen, his\nF2A petition became an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d petition, see\n\u00a7204.2(i)(3)\u2014all again with their original priority dates.\nMost notable here, what all of those authorized changes\nhad in common was that they could occur without any\nchange in the petitioner\u2019s identity, or otherwise in the\npetition\u2019s content. In each circumstance, the \u201cautomatic\nconversion\u201d entailed nothing more than picking up the\npetition from one category and dropping it into another for\nwhich the alien now qualified.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The dissent responds to this fact only with a pair of non-sequiturs.\n\nPost, at 18\u201319 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). First, the dissent cites a\nstatutory provision that does not use the word \u201cconversion\u201d at all, so\ncan hardly attest to its meaning. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71154(a)(1)(D)(i)(III).\nAnd next, the dissent cites a regulation that post-dated the CSPA by\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\n   Congress used the word \u201cconversion\u201d (even without the\nmodifier \u201cautomatic\u201d) in the identical way in two other\nsections of the CSPA. See Law v. Siegel, 571 U. S. ___, ___\n(slip op., at 7) (2014) (\u201c[W]ords repeated in different parts\nof the same statute generally have the same meaning\u201d).\nSection 2 refers to occasions on which, by virtue of the\nabove-described regulation, a petition \u201cconverted\u201d from\nF2A to the \u201cimmediate relative\u201d category because of the\nsponsor parent\u2019s naturalization, or from the F3 to the\nF1 box because of the beneficiary\u2019s divorce. 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71151(f )(2), (3). Then, in \u00a76, Congress authorized an\nadditional conversion of the same nature: It directed that\nwhen an LPR parent-sponsor naturalizes, the petition he\nhas filed for his adult son or daughter \u201cshall be converted,\u201d\nunless the beneficiary objects, from the F2B to the F1\ncompartment\u2014again with the original priority date un-\nchanged. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71154(k)(1)\u2013(3). (That opt-out mech-\nanism itself underscores the otherwise mechanical nature\nof the conversion.) Once again, in those cases, all that is\ninvolved is a recategorization\u2014moving the same petition,\nfiled by the same petitioner, from one preference classifi-\ncation to another, so as to reflect a change in either the\nalien\u2019s or his sponsor\u2019s status. In the rest of the CSPA, as\nin the prior immigration regulation, that is what \u201cconver-\nsion\u201d means.\n   And if the term meant more than that in \u00a71153(h)(3), it\nwould undermine the family preference system\u2019s core\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nyears, and thus is equally irrelevant to what Congress intended. See 71\nFed. Reg. 35732, 35749 (2006) (adding 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i)(1)(iv)). More-\nover, both provisions relate to a sui generis circumstance in which a\nperson can self-petition for a visa because her U. S. citizen or LPR\nrelative either died or engaged in domestic abuse. In that situation, the\nalien\u2019s eligibility rests throughout on her connection to the deceased or\nabusive relative; no new party must ever come in, as one has to in a\ncase like Wang, to salvage a no-longer-effective petition. See infra, at\n18 (addressing the problems that the substitution of a new petitioner\nraises).\n18           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                      Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\npremise: that each immigrant must have a qualified spon-\nsor. Consider the alternative addressed in Wang\u2014if\n\u201cautomatic conversion\u201d were also to encompass the substi-\ntution of a new petitioner for the old one, to make sure the\naged-out alien\u2019s petition fits into a new preference category.\nIn a case like Wang, recall, the original sponsor does\nnot have a legally recognized relationship with the aged-\nout derivative beneficiary (they are aunt and niece); ac-\ncordingly, the derivative\u2019s father\u2014the old principal benefi-\nciary\u2014must be swapped in as the petitioner to enable his\ndaughter to immigrate. But what if, at that point, the\nfather is in no position to sponsor his daughter? Suppose\nhe decided in the end not to immigrate, or failed to pass\nborder inspection, or died in the meanwhile. Or suppose\nhe entered the country, but cannot sponsor a relative\u2019s\nvisa because he lacks adequate proof of parentage or\ncommitted a disqualifying crime. See \u00a71154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II);\n8 CFR \u00a7204.2(d)(2); supra, at 4. Or suppose he does not\nwant to\u2014or simply cannot\u2014undertake the significant\nfinancial obligations that the law imposes on someone\npetitioning for an alien\u2019s admission.         See 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71183a(a)(1)(A), (f )(1)(D); supra, at 5. Immigration offi-\ncials cannot assume away all those potential barriers to\nentry: That would run counter to the family preference\nsystem\u2019s insistence that a qualified and willing sponsor\nback every immigrant visa. See \u00a7\u00a71154(a)\u2013(b). But nei-\nther can they easily, or perhaps at all, figure out whether\nsuch a sponsor exists unless he files and USCIS approves\na new petition\u2014the very thing \u00a71153(h)(3) says is not\nrequired.\n   Indeed, in cases like Wang, the problem is broader:\nUnder the statute\u2019s most natural reading, a new qualified\nsponsor will hardly ever exist at the moment the petition\nis to be \u201cconverted.\u201d Section 1153(h)(3), to be sure, does\nnot explicitly identify that point in time. But \u00a71153(h)(1)\nspecifies the date on which a derivative beneficiary is\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\ndeemed to have either aged out or not: It is \u201cthe date on\nwhich an immigrant visa number became available for the\nalien\u2019s parent.\u201d See \u00a7\u00a71153(h)(1)(A)\u2013(B). Because that\nstatutory aging out is the one and only thing that triggers\nautomatic conversion for eligible aliens, the date of con-\nversion is best viewed as the same. That reading, more-\nover, comports with the \u201cautomatic conversion\u201d regulation\non which Congress drew in enacting the CSPA, see supra,\nat 16\u201317: The rule authorizes conversions \u201cupon\u201d or \u201cas of\nthe date\u201d of the relevant change in the alien\u2019s status (in-\ncluding turning 21))\u2014regardless when USCIS may re-\nceive notice of the change. 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i); but cf. post, at\n14 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (wrongly stating that\nunder that rule conversion occurs upon the agency\u2019s re-\nceipt of proof of the change). But on that date, no new\npetitioner will be ready to step into the old one\u2019s shoes if\nsuch a substitution is needed to fit an aged-out beneficiary\ninto a different category. The beneficiary\u2019s parent, on the\nday a \u201cvisa number became available,\u201d cannot yet be an\nLPR or citizen; by definition, she has just become eligible\nto apply for a visa, and faces a wait of at least several\nmonths before she can sponsor an alien herself. Nor,\nexcept in a trivial number of cases, is any hitherto uniden-\ntified person likely to have a legally recognized relation-\nship to the alien. So if an aged-out beneficiary has lost his\nqualifying connection to the original petitioner, no conver-\nsion to an \u201cappropriate category\u201d can take place at the\nrequisite time. As long as immigration law demands some\nvalid sponsor, \u00a71153(h)(3) cannot give such an alien the\ndesignated relief.\n   On the above account\u2014in which conversion entails a\nsimple reslotting of an original petition into a now-\nappropriate category\u2014\u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s back half provides a\nremedy to two groups of aged-out beneficiaries. First, any\nchild who was the principal beneficiary of an F2A petition\n(filed by an LPR parent on his behalf) can take advantage\n20               SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                           Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nof that clause after turning 21. He is, upon aging out, the\nadult son of the same LPR who sponsored him as a child;\nhis petition can therefore be moved seamlessly\u2014without\nthe slightest alteration or delay\u2014into the F2B category.\nSecond, any child who was the derivative beneficiary of an\nF2A petition (filed by an LPR on his spouse\u2019s behalf) can\nsimilarly claim relief, provided that under the statute, he\nis not just the spouse\u2019s but also the petitioner\u2019s child.11\nSuch an alien is identically situated to the aged-out prin-\ncipal beneficiary of an F2A petition; indeed, for the price of\nanother filing fee, he could just as easily have been named\na principal himself. He too is now the adult son of the\noriginal LPR petitioner, and his petition can also be in-\nstantly relabeled an F2B petition, without any need to\nsubstitute a new sponsor or make other revisions. In each\ncase, the alien had a qualifying relationship before he was\n21 and retains it afterward; all that must be changed is\nthe label affixed to his petition.12\n   In contrast, as the Board held in Wang, the aged-out\nderivative beneficiaries of the other family preference\ncategories\u2014like the sons and daughters of the respond-\nents here\u2014cannot qualify for \u201cautomatic conversion.\u201d\nRecall that the respondents themselves were principal\nbeneficiaries of F3 and F4 petitions; their children, when\nunder 21, counted as derivatives, but lacked any qualify-\ning preference relationship of their own. The F3 deriva-\ntives were the petitioners\u2019 grandsons and granddaughters;\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    11 Given the statute\u2019s broad definition of \u201cchild,\u201d the only F2A deriva-\n\ntive beneficiaries who fall outside that proviso are stepchildren who\nwere over the age of 18 when the petitioner married the spousal benefi-\nciary. See \u00a71101(b)(1)(B). The Government represents that thousands\nof children are designated as F2A derivatives every year. See Reply\nBrief 18, n. 13.\n    12 It is, therefore, impossible to understand the dissent\u2019s statement\n\nthat conversion of such a petition to an appropriate category requires\n\u201c \u2018substantive alteration\u2019 to [the] petition.\u201d See post, at 19, n. 8 (opinion\nof SOTOMAYOR, J.).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71153(a)(3)\u2013\n(4). Now that the respondents\u2019 children have turned 21,\nand they can no longer ride on their parents\u2019 coattails,\nthat lack of independent eligibility makes a difference.\nFor them, unlike for the F2A beneficiaries, it is impossible\nsimply to slide the original petitions from a (no-longer-\nappropriate) child category to a (now-appropriate) adult\none. To fit into a new category, those aged-out derivatives,\nlike Wang\u2019s daughter, must have new sponsors\u2014and for\nall the reasons already stated, that need means they\ncannot benefit from \u201cautomatic conversion.\u201d\n   All that said, we hold only that \u00a71153(h)(3) permits\u2014not\nthat it requires\u2014the Board\u2019s decision to so distinguish\namong aged-out beneficiaries. That is because, as we\nexplained earlier, the two halves of \u00a71153(h)(3) face in\ndifferent directions. See supra, at 14. Section 1153(h)(3)\u2019s\nfirst part\u2014its conditional phrase\u2014encompasses every\naged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition, and\nthus points toward broad-based relief. But as just shown,\n\u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s second part\u2014its remedial prescription\u2014\napplies only to a narrower class of beneficiaries: those\naliens who naturally qualify for (and so can be \u201cautomati-\ncally converted\u201d to) a new preference classification when\nthey age out. Were there an interpretation that gave each\nclause full effect, the Board would have been required to\nadopt it. But the ambiguity those ill-fitting clauses create\ninstead left the Board with a choice\u2014essentially of how to\nreconcile the statute\u2019s different commands. The Board,\nrecognizing the need to make that call, opted to abide by\nthe inherent limits of \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s remedial clause, rather\nthan go beyond those limits so as to match the sweep of\nthe section\u2019s initial condition. On the Board\u2019s reasoned\nview, the only beneficiaries entitled to statutory relief are\nthose capable of obtaining the remedy designated. When\n22           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nan agency thus resolves statutory tension, ordinary prin-\nciples of administrative deference require us to defer. See\nNational Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n551 U. S. 644, 666 (2007) (When a statutory scheme con-\ntains \u201ca fundamental ambiguity\u201d arising from \u201cthe differ-\ning mandates\u201d of two provisions, \u201cit is appropriate to look\nto the implementing agency\u2019s expert interpretation\u201d to\ndetermine which \u201cmust give way\u201d).\n                              III\n  The respondents urge us to overturn the Board\u2019s judg-\nment for three independent reasons. First, and principally,\nthey take issue with the Board\u2019s\u2014and now our\u2014view\nof the limits associated with \u201cautomatic conversion\u201d: They\nargue that every aged-out beneficiary\u2019s petition can \u201cau-\ntomatically be converted\u201d to an \u201cappropriate category,\u201d\nand that the two halves of \u00a71153(h)(3) are thus reconcila-\nble. Second, the respondents contend that even if \u201cauto-\nmatic conversion\u201d does not extend so far, \u00a71153(h)(3)\nseparately entitles each such beneficiary to the benefit of\nhis original petition\u2019s priority date. And third, they claim\nthat the Board\u2019s way of resolving whatever ambiguity\ninheres in \u00a71153(h)(3) is arbitrary and capricious. The\ndissenting opinion reiterates the first two arguments,\nthough with slight variation and in opposite order, while\nforgoing the third.       See post, at 9\u201319 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.) (hereinafter the dissent). We find none of\nthe contentions persuasive.\n                            A\n  The respondents (and the dissent) initially aver that\nevery aged-out beneficiary (including their own sons and\ndaughters) can \u201cautomatically be converted\u201d to an \u201cappro-\npriate\u201d immigration category, if only immigration officials\ntry hard enough.

Brief for Respondents 33. And because, the\nrespondents say, it is thus possible to align the two halves\nof \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2014even if through multiple administrative\nmaneuvers\u2014immigration officials are under an obligation\nto do so. We disagree, for reasons that should sound fa-\nmiliar: Several are the same as those we have just given\nfor upholding the Board\u2019s interpretation. But still, we\nwalk through the respondents\u2019 argument step-by-step, to\nshow how far it departs from any ordinary understanding\nof \u201cautomatic conversion.\u201d\n   The first (and necessary) premise of that argument does\nnot augur well for the remainder: It is the view that the\n\u201cautomatic conversion\u201d procedure permits a change in the\npetitioner\u2019s identity. According to the respondents, the\naged-out beneficiaries\u2019 parents, upon becoming LPRs, can\nbe subbed in for the original sponsors (i.e., the beneficiar-\nies\u2019 grandparents, aunts, and uncles), and the petitions\nthen converted to the F2B category. But as we have\nshown, the \u201cautomatic conversion\u201d language\u2014as most\nnaturally read and as long used throughout immigration\nlaw\u2014contemplates merely moving a petition into a new\nand valid category, not changing its most essential fea-\nture. See supra, at 15\u201317. That alone defeats the re-\nspondents\u2019 position.\n   And a further problem follows\u2014this one concerning the\ndate of automatic conversion. The respondents need that\ndate to come at a time when the derivative beneficiaries\u2019\nparents (the substitute petitioners) are already living in\nthe United States as LPRs; otherwise, the petitions could\nnot qualify for the F2B box. In an attempt to make that\npossible, the respondents propose that conversion be\nviewed as taking place when \u201cthe derivative beneficiary\u2019s\nvisa . . . application is adjudicated.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n29. But as we have (again) demonstrated, the statute is\n24              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                          Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nbest read as establishing a different date: that \u201con which\nan immigrant visa number became available for the alien\u2019s\nparent\u201d\u2014when, by definition, the parent is not yet an\nLPR. \u00a71153(h)(1); see supra, at 18\u201319. That is the mo-\nment when a derivative ages out, which is the single\nchange conversion reflects. By contrast, the respondents\u2019\nsuggested date has no connection to that metamorphosis;\nthe date of adjudication is merely when an immigration\nofficial later discovers that a child has turned 21. And\nthat date is itself fortuitous, reflecting no more than when\nan immigration officer got around to reviewing a visa\napplication: The possibility of conversion would thus\ndepend on bureaucratic vagaries attending the visa pro-\ncess. So the respondents\u2019 mistaken view of the timing of\nconversion is another off-ramp from their argument.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 Still, the respondents\u2019 view of the timing of conversion is better\n\nthan the dissent\u2019s. As an initial matter, the dissent\u2019s objection to\nassessing conversion as of the date a visa becomes available hinges on\nan imaginary difficulty. That approach, the dissent complains, cannot\nbe right because that date always \u201coccurs before the point at which the\nchild is determined to have aged-out.\u201d Post, at 15. Well, yes. The date\na visa becomes available is, under the statute, the date an alien ages\nout (or not); and that status change of course occurs before an immigra-\ntion official, reviewing a visa application, finds that it has done so. But\nwhat of it? When an official determines that an alien was no longer a\nchild on the date a visa became available, he also assesses whether\nautomatic conversion was available to the alien as of that prior date. In\nother words, here as elsewhere in immigration law, conversion occurs\n(or not) upon the date of the relevant status change\u2014and no other. See\nsupra, at 19. And once that is understood, the supposed difficulties the\ndissent throws up all melt away.

The respondents\u2019 next\nproblem is that even on the conversion date they propose,\nmost of them (and other derivatives\u2019 parents) were not yet\nLPRs, and so could not possibly be sponsors. In the ordi-\nnary course, principal and derivative beneficiaries living\nabroad apply for their visas at the same time and go to the\nconsulate together for back-to-back interviews. See supra,\nat 6. And even if the parent is approved first, that alone\ndoes not make her an LPR; she still must come to this\ncountry, demonstrate her continued eligibility, and pass\nan inspection. See ibid. Thus, the respondents must\nrecommend changes to the visa process to get the timing\nto work\u2014essentially, administrative juggling to hold off\nthe derivative beneficiary\u2019s visa adjudication until his\nparent has become an LPR. In particular, they suggest\nthat the consular official defer the derivative\u2019s interview,\nor that the official nominally \u201creject the application\u201d and\nthen instruct the derivative to \u201creapply after the principal\nbeneficiary immigrates.\u201d Brief for Respondents 30. But\nthe need for that choreography (which, in any event, few if\nany of the respondents conformed to) renders the conver-\nsion process only less \u201cautomatic,\u201d because now it requires\nspecial intervention, purposeful delay, and deviation from\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhow far in the future, that a new petitioner stands ready and willing to\nsponsor an aged-out beneficiary. Post, at 15. Not even the respondents\npropose such a date, and for good reason. It has no grounding in the\nCSPA or in any regulatory practice, and it bears no connection to the\ntiming of the status change (aging out) that triggers conversion (or\neven, as the respondents\u2019 date does, to the later determination of that\nchange). The only thing appearing to support the dissent\u2019s date is a\nsingle-minded resolve, statutory text and administrative practice\nnotwithstanding, to grant relief to every possible aged-out beneficiary.\n26              SCIALABBA v.

Conversion has become\nnot a machine that would go of itself, but a process pains-\ntakingly managed.\n   And after all this fancy footwork, the respondents\u2019\nscheme still cannot succeed, because however long a visa\nadjudication is postponed, a derivative\u2019s parent may never\nbecome able to sponsor a relative\u2019s visa\u2014and immigration\nofficials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has\ndone so. We have noted before the potential impediments\nto serving as a petitioner\u2014including that a parent may\nnot immigrate, may not qualify as a sponsor, or may not\nbe able to provide the requisite financial support. See\nsupra, at 17\u201318. The respondents offer no way to deal\nwith those many contingencies. Require the parent to\nsubmit a new petition? But the entire point of automatic\nconversion (as the respondents themselves agree) is to\nobviate the need for such a document. See Brief for Re-\nspondents 30, 42. Investigate the parent\u2019s eligibility in\nsome other way? But even were that possible (which we\ndoubt) such an inquiry would not square with the essen-\ntial idea of an automatic process. Disregard the possibility\nthat no legal sponsor exists? But then visas would go,\ninevitably and not infrequently, to ineligible aliens. And\nso the workarounds have well and truly run out on the\nrespondents\u2019 argument.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Nor does the dissent offer any serious aid to the respondents. The\n\ndissent initially acknowledges that automatic conversion cannot involve\n\u201cadditional decisions, contingencies, or delays.\u201d Post, at 13. But no\nworries, the dissent continues: \u201c[O]nce [an alien\u2019s parent] provides\nconfirmation of her eligibility to sponsor\u201d the aged-out alien, the origi-\nnal petition \u201ccan automatically be converted to an F2B petition, with no\nadditional decision or contingency\u201d or (presumably) delay. Post, at 14.\nThink about that: Once every decision, contingency, and delay we have\njust described is over (and a parent has at long last turned out to be a\nviable sponsor), the dissent assures us that no further decisions,\ncontingencies, and delays remain. Or, put differently, there are no\ncontingencies after all the contingencies have been resolved; no deci-\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Having followed each step of the\nrespondents\u2019 resourceful (if Rube Goldbergish) argument,\nwe still see no way to apply the concept of automatic con-\nversion to the respondents\u2019 children and others like them.\nAnd that means we continue to face a statute whose\nhalves do not correspond to each other\u2014giving rise to an\nambiguity that calls for Chevron deference.\n                               B\n   The respondents, however, have another idea for recon-\nciling \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s front and back parts (and this back-up\nclaim becomes the dissent\u2019s principal argument). Recall\nthat the section\u2019s remedial clause instructs that \u201cthe\nalien\u2019s petition shall automatically be converted to the\nappropriate category and the alien shall retain the original\npriority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.\u201d\nThe respondents (and the dissent) ask us to read the\nitalicized language as conferring a benefit wholly inde-\npendent of automatic conversion. On that view, aged-out\nderivatives, even though ineligible for conversion, could\n\u201cretain the[ir] original priority date[s]\u201d if their parents file\na new petition (as the respondents in fact did here \u201cas a\nprotective matter,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 55). And then, every-\none encompassed in \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s first clause would get at\nleast some form of relief (even if not both forms) from the\nsection\u2019s second. For this argument, the respondents\nprincipally rely on the word \u201cand\u201d: \u201cWhere the word \u2018and\u2019\nconnects two\u201d phrases as in \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s back half, the\nrespondents contend, those terms \u201coperate independently.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsions after all the decisions have been made; and no delay after all the\ndelay has transpired. And as if that argument were not awkward\nenough, consider that it would make automatic conversion turn on the\nfiling of a new document that shows the parent\u2019s eligibility to sponsor\nher aged-out son or daughter\u2014the very thing, as all parties agree, that\nconversion is supposed to render unnecessary. See supra, at 18, 26.\n28               SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                           Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nBrief for Respondents 39; see post, at 9.\n  But the conjunction \u201cand\u201d does not necessarily disjoin\ntwo phrases in the way the respondents say. In some\nsentences, no doubt, the respondents have a point. They\nuse as their primary example: \u201c[I]f the boat takes on wa-\nter, then you shall operate the bilge pump and you shall\ndistribute life jackets.\u201d Brief for Respondents 39; see also\npost, at 10 (offering further examples). We agree that \u201cyou\nshall distribute life jackets\u201d functions in that sentence as\nan independent command. But we can come up with\nmany paired dictates in which the second is conditional on\nthe first. \u201cIf the price is reasonable, buy two tickets and\nsave a receipt.\u201d \u201cIf you have time this summer, read this\nbook and give me a report.\u201d Or, shades of this case: \u201cIf\nyour cell-phone contract expires, buy a new phone and\nkeep the old number.\u201d15 In each case, the second com-\nmand functions only once the first is accomplished.\nWhether \u201cand\u201d works in that way or in the respondents\u2019\ndepends, like many questions of usage, on the context.\nSee, e.g., Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 The  dissent appears to think that something helpful to its view\nfollows from repeating the word \u201cshall\u201d and changing the subject of the\ncommands. See post, at 9\u201310. But that is not so, as some further\nexamples show. \u201cIf you advance to the next round, my assistant shall\nschedule an interview and you shall come in to answer questions.\u201d \u201cIf\nthe plane is low on fuel, the tanks shall be refilled and the pilot shall fly\nthe route as scheduled.\u201d In these sentences, as in our prior ones, the\nsecond command is conditional on the first; all that differs is that these\nsentences are (much like statutes) more formal and stilted. And the\ndissent\u2019s citation of United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489\nU. S. 235 (1989), adds nothing to its argument. There, we construed\nthe following provision: \u201c[T]here shall be allowed to the holder of [a\nsecured] claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs,\nor charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim\narose.\u201d Id., at 241. We held that the phrase \u201cprovided for under the\nagreement\u201d qualifies the words \u201cany reasonable fees, costs, or charges,\u201d\nbut not the words \u201cinterest on such claim.\u201d Id., at 241\u2013242. What\nrelevance that interpretation bears to this case eludes us.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          29\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012).\n   Here, we think, context compels the Board\u2019s view that\nthe instructions work in tandem. The first phrase in-\nstructs immigration officials to convert a petition (when an\n\u201cappropriate category\u201d exists); the next clarifies that such\na converted petition will retain the original priority date,\nrather than receive a new one corresponding to the date of\nconversion. That reading comports with the way retention\nfigures in other statutory and regulatory provisions re-\nspecting \u201cconversions\u201d; there too, retention of a priority\ndate is conditional on a conversion occurring. See 8\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71154(k)(1)\u2013(3); 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i); supra, at 16.\nThe respondents wish to unhook the \u201cretention\u201d phrase\nfrom that mooring, and use it to explain what will attend a\ndifferent event\u2014that is, the filing of a new petition. But\nthat is to make \u201cretention\u201d conditional on something the\nstatute nowhere mentions\u2014a highly improbable thing for\nCongress to have done. (If, once again, a teacher says to\n\u201cread this book and give me a report,\u201d no one would think\nhe wants a report on some unidentified subject.) And\nindeed, the respondents\u2019 and dissent\u2019s own examples prove\nthis point: In not a single one of their proffered sentences\nis the second command contingent on the occurrence of\nsome additional, unstated event, as it would have to be\nunder the respondents\u2019 construction of \u00a71153(h)(3); rather,\neach such command (e.g., \u201cdistribute life jackets\u201d) flows\ndirectly from the stated condition (e.g., \u201cif the boat takes\non water\u201d). So by far the more natural understanding of\n\u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s text is that retention follows conversion, and\nnothing else.\n   The respondents\u2019 contrary view would also engender\nunusual results, introducing uncertainty into the immi-\ngration system\u2019s operation and thus interfering with\nstatutory goals. Were their theory correct, an aged-out\nalien could hold on to a priority date for years or even\ndecades while waiting for a relative to file a new petition.\n30              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                          Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nEven if that filing happened, say, 20 years after the alien\naged out, the alien could take out his priority-date token,\nand assert a right to spring to the front of any visa line.\nAt that point, USCIS could well have a hard time confirm-\ning the old priority date, in part because the names of\nderivative beneficiaries need not be listed on a visa peti-\ntion. And the possibility of such leap-frogging from many\nyears past would impede USCIS\u2019s publication of accurate\nwaiting times. As far as we know, immigration law no-\nwhere else allows an alien to keep in his pocket a priority\ndate untethered to any existing valid petition. Without\nsome clearer statement, we cannot conclude Congress\nintended here to create such a free-floating, open-ended\nentitlement to a defunct petition\u2019s priority date. See\nWang, 25 I. & N. Dec., at 36.16\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 The dissent claims that USCIS \u201cadministered priority date reten-\n\ntion in exactly this manner\u201d before the CSPA\u2019s enactment, post, at 10,\nbut that confident assertion is just not so\u2014or at least not in any way\nthat assists the respondents. The dissent principally relies on 8 CFR\n\u00a7204.2(a)(4), which prior to the CSPA\u2019s enactment permitted an aged-\nout F2A derivative beneficiary to retain his old priority date \u201cif [a]\nsubsequent petition is filed by the same petitioner\u201d as filed the original.\nFar from authorizing an open-ended, free-floating entitlement, that\nnow-superseded regulation allowed an alien to keep his priority date\nonly if he (unlike the respondents\u2019 offspring) had a qualifying relation-\nship with the initial petitioner\u2014that is, only if he fell within the group\nthat the BIA in Wang thought entitled to relief. See 25 I. & N. Dec., at\n34\u201335. And the other provisions the dissent cites (which, unlike\n\u00a7204.2(a)(4), continue to operate) similarly fail to support the dissent\u2019s\nposition, because they enable an alien to retain a priority date only if\nattached to an existing valid petition. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71154(k)(3) (per-\nmitting an alien to retain a priority date associated with an ex-\nisting F2B petition); 8 CFR \u00a7204.5(e) (permitting an alien to retain a\npriority date associated with an existing employment-based peti-\ntion); \u00a7204.12(f)(1) (permitting an alien to retain a priority date\nassociated with an existing employment-based petition for immigrating\nphysicians).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

In their view, the Board has offered\nno valid reason, consistent with \u201cthe purposes and con-\ncerns of the immigration laws,\u201d to treat their own sons and\ndaughters less favorably than aliens who were principal\nand derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions. Brief for\nRespondents 47. Indeed, the respondents suggest that the\nBIA, \u201cfor its own unfathomable reasons, disapproves of\nCongress\u2019s decision to allow any aged-out\u201d aliens to get\nrelief, and has thus \u201climited [\u00a71153(h)(3)] to as few deriva-\ntive beneficiaries as possible.\u201d Id., at 55.\n   We cannot agree. At the least, the Board\u2019s interpreta-\ntion has administrative simplicity to recommend it. Un-\nder that view, immigration authorities need only perform\nthe kind of straightforward (i.e., \u201cautomatic\u201d) conversion\nthey have done for decades\u2014moving a petition from one\nbox to another to reflect a given status change like aging\nout. See Wang, 25 I. & N. Dec., at 36. The respondents,\nas we have shown, would transform conversion into a\nmanaged, multi-stage process, requiring immigration and\nconsular officials around the world to sequence and delay\nevery aged-out alien\u2019s visa adjudication until they are able\nto confirm that one of his parents had become a qualifying\nand willing F2B petitioner. And according to the Govern-\nment\u2019s (incomplete) statistics, that would have to happen\nin, at a minimum, tens of thousands of cases every year.\nSee Reply Brief 18, n. 13.\n   Still more important, the Board offered a cogent argu-\nment, reflecting statutory purposes, for distinguishing\nbetween aged-out beneficiaries of F2A petitions and the\nrespondents\u2019 sons and daughters. See Wang, 35 I. & N.\nDec., at 38. As earlier explained, the F2A beneficiaries\n32           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nhave all had a qualifying relationship with an LPR for the\nentire period they have waited in line\u2014i.e., since their\noriginal priority dates. See supra, at 19\u201320. That means\nthat when immigration authorities convert their petitions,\nthey will enter the F2B line at the same place as others\nwho have had a comparable relationship for an equal time.\nThe conversion thus fits with the immigration law\u2019s basic\nfirst-come-first-served rule. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(e); supra,\nat 4. By contrast, the derivative beneficiaries of F3 and F4\npetitions, like the respondents\u2019 sons and daughters, lacked\nany qualifying relationship with a citizen or LPR during\nthe period they waited in line. See supra, at 20\u201321. They\nwere, instead, the grandchildren, nieces, or nephews of\ncitizens, and those relationships did not independently\nentitle them to visas. If such aliens received relief under\n\u00a71153(h)(3), they would jump over thousands of others in\nthe F2B line who had a qualifying relationship with an\nLPR for a far longer time. That displacement would, the\nBoard reasonably found, scramble the priority order Con-\ngress prescribed.\n   The argument to the contrary assumes that the re-\nspondents\u2019 sons and daughters should \u201creceive credit\u201d for\nall the time the respondents themselves stood in line.\nBrief for Respondents 50. But first, the time the respond-\nents spent waiting for a visa may diverge substantially\nfrom the time their children did. Suppose, for example,\nthat one of the respondents had stood in the F4 queue for\n15 years, and with just 4 years to go, married someone\nwith a 17-year-old son. Under the respondents\u2019 reading,\nthat derivative beneficiary, after aging out, would get the\nfull benefit of his new parent\u2019s wait, and so displace many\nthousands of aliens who (unlike him) had stood in an\nimmigration queue for nearly two decades. And second,\neven when the derivative qualified as such for all the time\nhis parent stood in line, his status throughout that period\nhinged on his being that parent\u2019s minor child. If his par-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          33\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nent had obtained a visa before he aged out, he would have\nbeen eligible for a visa too, because the law does not de-\nmand that a prospective immigrant abandon a minor\nchild. But if the parent had died while waiting for a visa,\nor had been found ineligible, or had decided not to immi-\ngrate after all, the derivative would have gotten nothing\nfor the time spent in line. See supra, at 5\u20136. Similarly,\nthe Board could reasonably conclude, he should not receive\ncredit for his parent\u2019s wait when he has become old\nenough to live independently. In the unavoidably zero-\nsum world of allocating a limited number of visas, the\nBoard could decide that he belongs behind any alien who\nhas had a lengthier stand-alone entitlement to immigrate.\n                            IV\n   This is the kind of case Chevron was built for. What-\never Congress might have meant in enacting \u00a71153(h)(3),\nit failed to speak clearly.     Confronted with a self-\ncontradictory, ambiguous provision in a complex statutory\nscheme, the Board chose a textually reasonable construc-\ntion consonant with its view of the purposes and policies\nunderlying immigration law. Were we to overturn the\nBoard in that circumstance, we would assume as our own\nthe responsible and expert agency\u2019s role.

I disa-\ngree with the plurality that the first clause \u201cpoints toward\nbroad-based relief,\u201d ante, at 21, because I do not think the\nfirst clause points toward any relief at all.2\n   Imagine a provision of the Tax Code that read: \u201cIf a\nstudent is determined to be enrolled at an accredited\nuniversity, the student\u2019s cost of off-campus housing shall\nbe deductible on her tax return.\u201d It would be immediately\napparent from that provision that an enrolled student who\nlives on campus is not entitled to the deduction, even\nthough the student falls within the conditional first\nclause. And yet no one would describe the two clauses as\nbeing in tension. If the Internal Revenue Service then\ninterpreted the term \u201ccost of off-campus housing\u201d to ex-\nclude payments by a student who rents a home from his\nparents, a court would determine whether that interpreta-\ntion was reasonable. The same is true in this case.3\n   The particular benefit provided by section 1153(h)(3) is\nfound exclusively in the second clause\u2014the only operative\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 For  the same reason, I do not agree with the contention in JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent that the first clause of section 1153(h)(3) unam-\nbiguously \u201canswers the precise question in this case.\u201d Post, at 6.\n   3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent accuses me of \u201cignor[ing]\u201d the first\n\nclause of section 1153(h)(3), \u201ctreating [that] clause as a nullity,\u201d and\ndenying the clause \u201ceffect.\u201d Post, at 20\u201321. But that point is correct\nonly if the reader adopts JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s own premise, that the\nfirst clause has operative effect on its own. I give the statute\u2019s first\nclause precisely the (limited) effect it is meant to have: it defines who is\npotentially affected by section 1153(h)(3). JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s re-\nsponse to the campus housing example proves my point by acknowledg-\ning that who gets relief under a statute depends entirely on the mean-\ning of the statute\u2019s operative provision, not on the reach of the\nintroductory clause. See post, at 21. The Court would not reject a\nreasonable interpretation of the term \u201ccost of off-campus housing,\u201d as\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent would, simply because the IRS could have\ninterpreted the term to cover more students who fall within the prefa-\ntory clause.\n4               SCIALABBA v.

There we are told what an aged-out beneficiary\n(from whatever preference category) is entitled to: His\npetition \u201cshall automatically be converted to the appropri-\nate category and the alien shall retain the original priority\ndate.\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3). But automatic conversion is not possi-\nble for every beneficiary in every preference category, as\nthe plurality convincingly demonstrates. Ante, at 15\u201319.\nAutomatic conversion requires, at minimum, that the\nbeneficiary have his own sponsor, who demonstrates that\nhe is eligible to act as a sponsor, and who commits to\nproviding financial support for the beneficiary. Ante, at\n18. Some aged-out children will not meet those prerequi-\nsites, and they cannot benefit from automatic conversion\neven under respondents\u2019 interpretation of the statute.4\n   Beyond those requirements, however, Congress did not\nspeak clearly to which petitions can \u201cautomatically be\nconverted.\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3). Whatever other interpretations\nof that provision might be possible, it was reasonable, for\nthe reasons explained by the plurality, for the Board to\ninterpret section 1153(h)(3) to provide relief only to a child\nwho was a principal or derivative beneficiary of an F2A\npetition. That interpretation is consistent with the ordi-\nnary meaning of the statutory terms, with the established\nmeaning of automatic conversion in immigration law, and\nwith the structure of the family-based immigration sys-\ntem. Ante, at 15\u201320. It also avoids the problems that\nwould flow from respondents\u2019 proposed alternative inter-\npretations, including the suggestion that retention of the\noriginal priority date provides a benefit wholly separate\nfrom automatic conversion.

While I, like JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, would affirm\nthe Court of Appeals, my justification for doing so differs\nsomewhat from hers.\n   As I see it, the question before us is whether there is or\nis not an \u201cappropriate category\u201d to which the petitions for\nrespondents\u2019 children may be converted. If there is, the\nagency was obligated by the clear text of 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71153(h)(3) to convert the petitions and leave the children\nwith their original priority dates. Any such conversion\nwould be \u201cautomatic,\u201d because the agency\u2019s obligation to\nconvert the petitions follows inexorably, and without need\nfor any additional action on the part of either respondents\nor their children, from the fact that the children\u2019s ages\n2               SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nhave been calculated to be 21 or older.1 If there is not an\nappropriate category, then the agency was not required to\nconvert the petitions.\n   By the time respondents became legal permanent resi-\ndents and filed new petitions for their children (if not\nsooner), there existed an appropriate category to which the\noriginal petitions could be converted. That is because at\nthat point the children all qualified for F2B preference\nstatus, as unmarried, adult children of legal permanent\nresidents. Accordingly, the agency should have converted\nrespondents\u2019 children\u2019s petitions and allowed them to\nretain their original priority dates.2\n   Section 1153(h)(3) is brief and cryptic. It may well\ncontain a great deal of ambiguity, which the Board of\nImmigration Appeals in its expertise is free to resolve, so\nlong as its resolution is a \u201cpermissible construction of the\nstatute.\u201d Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources De-\nfense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). But the\nstatute is clear on at least one point: \u201cIf the age of an alien\nis determined under [\u00a71153(h)(1)] to be 21 years of age or\nolder . . . , the alien\u2019s petition shall automatically be con-\nverted to the appropriate category and the alien shall\nretain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the\noriginal petition\u201d (emphasis added).

The initial clause of 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71153(h)(3) provides a clear answer: Aged-out\nchildren may retain their priority dates so long as they\nmeet a single condition\u2014they must be \u201cdetermined . . . to\nbe 21 years of age or older for purposes of\u201d derivative\nbeneficiary status. Because all five categories of aged-out\nchildren satisfy this condition, all are entitled to relief.\n   Notwithstanding this textual command, the Board of\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) ruled that four of the five\ncategories of aged-out children to whom \u00a71153(h)(3) un-\nambiguously promises priority date retention, are, in fact,\nentitled to no relief at all. See Matter of Wang, 25 I. & N.\nDec. 28, 38\u201339 (2009). The Court defers to that interpre-\ntation today. In doing so, the Court does not identify any\n2            SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nambiguity in the dispositive initial clause of \u00a71153(h)(3).\nIndeed, it candidly admits that the clause mandates relief\nfor \u201cevery aged-out beneficiary of a family-preference\npetition\u201d in any of the five categories. Ante, at 21. The\nCourt nevertheless holds that the BIA was free to ignore\nthis unambiguous text on the ground that \u00a71153(h)(3) also\noffers aged-out derivative beneficiaries a type of relief\u2014\nautomatic conversion\u2014that it thinks can apply only to one\nof the five categories. The Court thus perceives a conflict\nin the statute that, in its view, permits the BIA to override\n\u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s initial eligibility clause.\n  In reaching this conclusion, the Court fails to follow a\ncardinal rule of statutory interpretation: When deciding\nwhether Congress has \u201cspecifically addressed the question\nat issue,\u201d thereby leaving no room for an agency to fill a\nstatutory gap, courts must \u201cinterpret the statute \u2018as a . . .\ncoherent regulatory scheme\u2019 and \u2018fit, if possible, all parts\ninto [a] harmonious whole.\u2019 \u201d FDA v. Brown & Williamson\nTobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132\u2013133 (2000) (citation\nomitted). Because the Court and the BIA ignore obvious\nways in which \u00a71153(h)(3) can operate as a coherent whole\nand instead construe the statute as a self-contradiction\nthat was broken from the moment Congress wrote it, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n                              I\n   Under Chevron, the first question we ask when review-\ning an agency\u2019s construction of a statute is whether \u201cCon-\ngress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d\nChevron U.

Congress has de-\nfined five categories of eligible relatives\u2014referred to as\nfamily-preference categories\u2014with annual limits on the\nnumber of visas that may be issued within each category.1\nBecause the demand for visas outstrips supply, the wait\nfor a visa can often last many years. While a principal\nbeneficiary waits, her place in line is determined based on\nher \u201cpriority date,\u201d the date on which her petition was\nfiled. See \u00a71153(e)(1); 8 CFR \u00a7204.1(b) (2014); 22 CFR\n\u00a742.53(a) (2013). Priority dates are therefore crucial\u2014the\nearlier one\u2019s priority date, the sooner one\u2019s place will come\nup in line and a visa will be available. Significantly, when\nthe wait ends and a principal beneficiary finally becomes\neligible to apply for a visa, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(d) enables the\nbeneficiary\u2019s spouse and minor children (known as \u201cderiv-\native beneficiaries\u201d) to do so too.\n   This case arises from a common problem: Given the\nlengthy period prospective immigrants must wait for a\nvisa, a principal beneficiary\u2019s child\u2014although younger\nthan 21 when her parent\u2019s petition was initially filed\u2014\noften will have turned 21 by the time the parent\u2019s priority\ndate comes up in line. Such a child is said to have \u201caged\nout\u201d of derivative beneficiary treatment under \u00a71153(d).\nBy way of example, respondent Norma Uy was the princi-\npal beneficiary of an F4 family-preference petition filed by\nher U. S. citizen sister in February 1981. That petition\nlisted Norma\u2019s daughter, Ruth, who was then two years\nold, as a derivative beneficiary. If Norma had reached the\nfront of the visa line at any time before Ruth\u2019s 21st birth-\nday, \u00a71153(d) would have enabled Ruth to accompany\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The five categories are F1 (unmarried adult children of U. S. citi-\n\nzens); F2A (spouses and unmarried minor children of LPRs); F2B\n(unmarried adult children of LPRs); F3 (married children of U. S.\ncitizens); and F4 (brothers and sisters of U. S. citizens). 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71153(a)(1)\u2013(4).\n4               SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nNorma to the United States. Unfortunately, it took more\nthan two decades for Norma\u2019s priority date to become\ncurrent, by which point Ruth was 23 and thus too old for\nderivative beneficiary status under \u00a71153(d). Norma\ntherefore immigrated alone to the United States, where\nshe filed a new F2B petition (for unmarried children of\nLPRs) on Ruth\u2019s behalf. Before \u00a71153(h)(3) was enacted,\nhowever, an immigrant in Ruth\u2019s position would have been\nunable to retain the February 1981 priority date from her\noriginal petition; the law would have instead required her\nto receive a new priority date all the way at the back of the\nF2B line.\n  Congress responded to this problem by enacting\n\u00a71153(h)(3), a provision entitled \u201c[r]etention of priority\ndate.\u201d It states:\n         \u201cIf the age of an alien is determined under [the for-\n       mula specified in] paragraph (1)[2] to be 21 years of\n       age or older for the purpos[e] of . . . [\u00a71153(d)] of this\n       section, the alien\u2019s petition shall automatically be\n       converted to the appropriate category and the alien\n       shall retain the original priority date issued upon re-\n       ceipt of the original petition.\u201d\n   The provision\u2019s structure is crucial to its meaning. The\ninitial clause (call it the \u201celigibility clause\u201d) specifies who\nis eligible for relief. The concluding clause (call it the\n\u201crelief clause\u201d) describes the two forms of relief to which\neligible persons are entitled. As the title of the provision\nsuggests, the main form of relief is the right of an aged-out\nderivative beneficiary to retain the priority date of her\noriginal petition. In Ruth Uy\u2019s case, such relief would\nmean the difference between resuming her wait near the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 As\n      the plurality explains, ante, at 9\u201310, the formula specified in\nparagraph (1) subtracts out bureaucratic delays resulting from the\nGovernment\u2019s review of the relevant immigration paperwork. That\nformula is not at issue in this case.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Brief for Respondents 52.\n   The question in this case is which aged-out beneficiaries\nof family-preference petitions are eligible for priority date\nretention: the aged-out beneficiaries of petitions in all five\nfamily-preference categories (which would include re-\nspondents\u2019 children, who were derivative beneficiaries of\nF3 and F4 petitions for adult children and adult siblings of\nU. S. citizens, respectively), or the aged-out beneficiaries\nof only F2A petitions for spouses and children of LPRs (the\ninterpretation offered by the BIA)?\n   Congress answered that question in \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s eligi-\nbility clause, which specifies that relief is to be conferred\non any immigrant who has been \u201cdetermined under [the\nformula specified in] paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or\nolder\u201d for the purpose of \u00a71153(d). As the plurality con-\ncedes, this clause \u201cstates a condition that every aged-out\nbeneficiary of a preference petition satisfies\u201d\u2014that is, it\nmakes eligible for relief aged-out children within each of\nthe F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and F4 categories. Ante, at 14.\n   Congress made this clear in two mutually reinforc-\ning ways. First, by referring to the formula set forth in\n\u201cparagraph (1),\u201d the statute incorporates that paragraph\u2019s\ncross-reference to \u00a71153(h)(2). Section 1153(h)(2) in turn\ndefines the set of covered petitions to include, \u201cwith re-\nspect to an alien child who is a derivative beneficiary\nunder [\u00a71153(d)], a petition filed . . . for classification\nof the alien\u2019s parent under [\u00a71153(a)].\u201d And \u00a71153(a)\nencompasses all five family-preference categories. See\n\u00a7\u00a71153(a)(1)\u2013(4). Second, \u00a71153(h)(3) promises relief to\nthose who are found to be 21 \u201cfor the purpos[e] of . . .\n[\u00a71153](d),\u201d the provision governing derivative beneficiar-\nies. And that provision also unambiguously covers all five\nfamily-preference categories. See \u00a71153(d) (a minor child\n6              SCIALABBA v.

Thus, unlike in the usual\nChevron case, where ambiguity derives from the fact that\nthe text does not speak with sufficient specificity to the\nquestion at issue, the plurality argues that this is a case in\nwhich ambiguity can only arise\u2014if it is to arise at all\u2014if\nCongress has spoken clearly on the issue in diametrically\nopposing ways.3 As the plurality frames it, \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 To\n       understand the kind of conflict that can make deference appro-\npriate to an agency\u2019s decision to override unambiguous statutory text,\nconsider the provisions at issue in National Assn. of Home Builders v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 551 U.

See A. Scalia & B.\nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n180 (2012) (\u201cThe provisions of a text should be interpreted\nin a way that renders them compatible, not contradic-\ntory. . . .

That is especially true where, as here,\nthe conflict that Congress supposedly created is not be-\ntween two different statutes or even two separate provi-\nsions within a single statute, but between two clauses in\nthe same sentence. See ibid. (\u201c[I]t is invariably true that\nintelligent drafters do not contradict themselves\u201d).

Each of these cautions springs\nfrom a common well: As judicious as it can be to defer to\nadministrative agencies, our foremost duty is, and always\nhas been, to give effect to the law as drafted by Congress.\n   The plurality contends that deference is appropriate\nhere because, in its view, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s two\nclauses are \u201cself-contradictory.\u201d Ante, at 33. But far from\nit being unworkable (or even difficult) for the agency to\nobey both clauses, traditional tools of statutory construc-\ntion reveal that \u00a71153(h)\u2019s clauses are entirely compatible.\n                               B\n   The plurality argues that although \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s eligibil-\nity clause clearly encompasses aged-out beneficiaries\nwithin all five preference categories, the relief clause\nimplies a conflicting \u201climitation on the eligible class of\nrecipients.\u201d Ante, at 15. The plurality infers that limita-\ntion from two premises. First, it contends that no aged-\nout child may retain her priority date unless her petition\nis also eligible for automatic conversion. And second, it\nasserts that only aged-out F2A beneficiaries may receive\nautomatic conversion. As a result, the plurality concludes,\nit was reasonable for the BIA to exclude aged-out children\nin the four other categories from receiving both automatic\nconversion and priority date retention, thereby rendering\n\u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s eligibility clause defunct.\n   The plurality\u2019s conclusion is wrong because its premises\nare wrong. For one, \u00a71153(h)(3) is naturally read to confer\npriority date retention as an independent form of relief to\nall aged-out children, regardless of whether automatic\nconversion is separately available. And even if that were\nwrong, the plurality\u2019s supposition that only F2A benefi-\nciaries can receive automatic conversion is incorrect on its\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nown terms. Because either of these interpretations would\ntreat \u00a71153(h)(3) as a coherent whole, the BIA\u2019s construc-\ntion was impermissible.\n                              1\n   The most obvious flaw in the plurality\u2019s analysis is its\npresumption that \u00a71153(h)(3) permits an aged-out child to\nretain her original priority date only if her petition can\nbe automatically converted. That is incorrect for many\nreasons.\n   When an immigrant is determined to have aged out of\nderivative beneficiary status, \u00a71153(h)(3) prescribes two\nforms of relief: \u201c[T]he alien\u2019s petition shall automatically\nbe converted to the appropriate category and the alien\nshall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt\nof the original petition.\u201d We have held that when a statute\nprovides two forms of relief in this manner, joined by the\nconjunction \u201cand,\u201d the two remedies are \u201cdistinct.\u201d United\nStates v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241\u2013\n242 (1989). That understanding makes particular sense\nhere, where Congress used the mandatory word \u201cshall\u201d\ntwice, once before each form of relief. See Lexecon Inc. v.\nMilberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 35\n(1998) (\u201c[T]he mandatory [term] \u2018shall\u2019 . . . normally cre-\nates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion\u201d).\nMoreover, the two \u201cshall\u201d commands operate on different\nsubjects, further reinforcing that they prescribe distinct\nremedies: An aged-out \u201calien\u2019s petition shall automatically\nbe converted,\u201d but it is \u201cthe alien\u201d herself who, in all\nevents, \u201cshall retain\u201d her original priority date.\n\u00a71153(h)(3) (emphasis added).\n   The plurality responds with a series of examples in\nwhich the word \u201cand\u201d is used to join two commands, one of\nwhich is\u2014as the plurality asserts here\u2014dependent on\nanother. Ante, at 28, and n. 15. But as the plurality\nrecognizes, ante, at 28, that is hardly the only way the\n10           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nword can be used. For example: \u201cIf today\u2019s baseball game\nis rained out, your ticket shall automatically be converted\nto a ticket for next Saturday\u2019s game, and you shall retain\nyour free souvenir from today\u2019s game.\u201d Or: \u201cIf you provide\nthe DMV with proof of your new address, your voter regis-\ntration shall automatically be converted to the correct\npolling location, and you shall receive in the mail an up-\ndated driver\u2019s license.\u201d It is plain in both of these exam-\nples that the two commands are distinct\u2014the fan in the\nfirst example can keep her free souvenir even if she cannot\nattend next Saturday\u2019s game; the new resident will receive\nan updated driver\u2019s license even if she is ineligible to vote.\nWhat the plurality does not explain is why we should forgo\nthe same understanding of \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s relief clause when\nthat would treat the statute as a coherent whole (and\nwhen the plurality\u2019s alternative interpretation would\nrender the statute a walking self-contradiction within the\nspan of a few words).\n   With the text unavailing, the plurality turns to a policy\nargument. The plurality worries that if automatic conver-\nsion and priority date retention are independent benefits,\naged-out beneficiaries will be able to \u201chold on to a priority\ndate for years . . . while waiting for a relative to file a new\npetition,\u201d which might hamper U. S. Citizenship and\nImmigration Services (USCIS) operations. Ante, at 29\u201330.\nBut the plurality\u2019s fears of administrative inconvenience\nare belied by the fact that USCIS has administered prior-\nity date retention in exactly this manner for years, with no\napparent problems. Well before \u00a71153(h)(3) was enacted,\na regulation provided aged-out F2A derivative beneficiar-\nies the ability to retain their priority dates without also\nproviding automatic conversion. See 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(a)(4)\n(permitting priority date retention after a \u201cseparate peti-\ntion\u201d is filed); 57 Fed. Reg. 41053, 41059 (1992) (adopting\nthis provision). Indeed, the USCIS continues to instruct\nfield officers that a \u201cseparate petition\u201d must be filed in\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

The notion that it is somehow impossible for an\nimmigrant to retain her priority date contingent upon the\nfiling of a separate petition is therefore contradicted by\nyears of agency experience.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The plurality does not dispute that USCIS has administered priority\ndate retention as a form of relief independent from automatic conver-\nsion for years. Ante, at 30, n. 16. It nonetheless argues that the same\napproach is impermissible here for the counterintuitive reason that a\npre-existing regulation used express language limiting priority date\nretention to derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions alone. See ante, at\n30, n. 16 (noting that 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(a)(4) permitted an aged-out benefi-\nciary to retain her priority date \u201c \u2018if the subsequent petition is filed by\nthe same petitioner\u2019 \u201d). Congress included no such language to limit the\nscope of priority date retention in 8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(h)(3), however,\nwhich just reinforces what the eligibility clause already makes clear:\nPriority date retention is independently available for aged-out de-\nrivative beneficiaries of all family-preference petitions, not just F2A\npetitions.\n   The plurality also fails to account for the numerous other contexts in\nwhich USCIS has administered priority date retention as a benefit\ndistinct from automatic conversion. See, e.g., \u00a71154(k)(3) (providing\npriority date retention to unmarried adult children of LPRs whose\nparents become naturalized citizens \u201c[r]egardless of whether a petition\nis converted\u201d); 8 CFR \u00a7204.5(e) (\u201cA petition approved on behalf of an\nalien under [the employment-based immigration provisions of \u00a71153(b)]\naccords the alien the priority date of the approved petition for any\nsubsequently filed [employment] petition\u201d); \u00a7204.12(f)(1) (a \u201cphysician\nbeneficiary\u201d who finds a \u201cnew employer [who] desir[es] to petition\n[USCIS] on the physician\u2019s behalf\u201d must submit a new petition, but\n\u201cwill retain the priority date from the initial\u201d petition). Finally, the\nplurality suggests that priority date retention can operate independently\nof automatic conversion only if the date to be retained is attached to\na valid petition. Ante, at 30, and n. 16. But that cannot be squared with\nUSCIS\u2019s longstanding practice of allowing F2A beneficiaries to retain\nthe priority dates from their no-longer valid petitions upon the filing of\na new petition.\n12           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   In the end, the plurality suggests that we should defer\nto the BIA\u2019s all-or-nothing approach because \u201ccontext\ncompels\u201d it. Ante, at 28. Yet fatally absent from the plu-\nrality\u2019s discussion of context is any mention of the first\nclause of the very same provision, which, as the plurality\nadmits, unambiguously confers relief upon all five catego-\nries of aged-out children. That clause is dispositive, be-\ncause\u2014assuming that F2A beneficiaries alone can receive\nautomatic conversion\u2014a reading that treats automatic\nconversion and priority date retention as independent\nbenefits is the only one that would \u201cproduc[e] a substan-\ntive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\u201d\nUnited Sav.

The ordinary\nmeaning of \u201cconvert\u201d is \u201cto change (something) into a\ndifferent form.\u201d Id., at 444. Here, the statute specifies the\nform into which an aged-out child\u2019s petition shall be\nchanged: another petition in the \u201cappropriate category.\u201d\n\u00a71153(h)(3). Tying the terms together, then, \u201cautomatic\nconversion\u201d means changing an old petition into a new\npetition in an appropriate category upon the occurrence\nof some predicate event, without a further decision or\ncontingency.\n   All aged-out beneficiaries can have their petitions auto-\nmatically converted under this definition. Perhaps most\nsensibly, all five categories of petitions may be converted\nto an appropriate category, without any further decision or\ncontingency, upon a logical predicate event: when USCIS\nreceives confirmation that an appropriate category exists.\nTo see how this would work, recall the case of Norma Uy,\nand her daughter, Ruth. Norma was the principal benefi-\nciary of an F4 petition filed by her U. S. citizen sister;\nRuth was a derivative beneficiary of the same petition.\nBecause Ruth had aged out of derivative beneficiary sta-\ntus prior to Norma\u2019s reaching the front of the visa line,\nNorma immigrated to the United States without Ruth.\nOnce Norma became an LPR, however, she also became\neligible to file a new petition on Ruth\u2019s behalf under\nthe F2B category (unmarried adult children of LPRs),\n\u00a71153(a)(2)(B). Thus, once Norma provides confirmation\nof that eligibility to sponsor Ruth (i.e., that she is an LPR,\nthat Ruth is her daughter, and that she has not committed\ndisqualifying criminal conduct, see ante, at 4), Ruth\u2019s\noriginal F4 petition can automatically be converted to an\n14              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nF2B petition, with no additional decision or contingency.5\n   Indeed, this is how USCIS already applies automatic\nconversion in other contexts. For example, when an LPR\nhas filed an F2A petition on behalf of a spouse or child,\nand the LPR subsequently becomes a U. S. citizen, a pro-\nvision entitled \u201c[a]utomatic conversion of preference classi-\nfication,\u201d 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i), permits the F2A petition to be\nautomatically converted to an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d peti-\ntion, \u00a7204.2(i)(3). See ante, at 16. Significantly, the predi-\ncate event that triggers this conversion is the agency\u2019s\nreceipt of proof that the petition\u2019s sponsor has become a\nU. S. citizen\u2014proof, in other words, that there is an ap-\npropriate category into which the petition can be converted.6\nSection 1153(h)(3)\u2019s automatic conversion remedy can\nsensibly be administered in the same way.\n   The plurality\u2019s contrary conclusion that automatic\nconversion is impossible for all but one category of family-\npreference petitions hinges on three basic misunderstand-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Of  course, just like any other beneficiary of a family visa petition,\none whose petition has been automatically converted must still satisfy\nthe requirements for actually obtaining a visa. See ante, at 5. For\nexample, all visa applicants must attach an \u201caffidavit of support\u201d from\ntheir sponsors. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71182(a)(4)(C)(ii). As is true for any other\nbeneficiary, nothing stops a sponsor from declining to swear their\nsupport for the beneficiary of an automatically converted petition after\na visa has become available. Converting petitions upon proof of an\nappropriate category therefore produces no uncertainties or contingen-\ncies that do not already exist for all family visa applicants to begin\nwith.\n   6 See Dept. of State, If You Were an LPR and Are Now a U. S. Citizen:\n\nUpgrading a Petition, online at http://travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/\ntypes/types_2991.html#5. The regulation cited by the plurality, 8 CFR\n\u00a7204.2(i), is not to the contrary; it merely establishes that when an\nautomatic conversion occurs, it shall be treated as \u201c[e]ffective upon the\ndate of naturalization,\u201d \u00a7204.2(i)(3). As the State Department\u2019s instruc-\ntions make clear, the conversion itself takes place after the new citizen\n\u201csend[s] proof of [her] U.

First, the plurality contends that automatic conver-\nsion is triggered not by confirmation of the existence of an\nappropriate category, but rather by a different predicate\nevent: the moment when \u201c \u2018an immigrant visa number\nbec[omes] available for the alien\u2019s parent.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 19.\nThis is a curious argument, not least because nothing in\n\u00a71153(h)(3) suggests it. That provision simply makes\nautomatic conversion available \u201c[i]f the age of an alien is\ndetermined\u201d to be \u201cbe 21 years of age or older\u201d for pur-\nposes of \u00a71153(d). Section 1153(h)(3) thus states the\ncondition that an immigrant must satisfy to be eligible for\nautomatic conversion, but it nowhere commands when the\nconversion should occur. There is no reason why conver-\nsion cannot occur at the logical point just described: the\nmoment when USCIS receives proof that an appropriate\ncategory exists.\n   The plurality acknowledges that \u00a71153(h)(3) \u201cdoes not\nexplicitly identify th[e] point in time\u201d at which a \u201cpetition\nis to be \u2018converted.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 18. It nevertheless suggests\nthat the date when a conversion occurs \u201cis best viewed\u201d as\nthe date when a visa became available for the aged-out\nchild\u2019s parent. Ante, at 19. But Congress could not have\nintended conversion to occur at that point for a glaring\nreason: The date on which a visa becomes available for an\naged-out child\u2019s parent occurs before the point at which\nthe child is determined to have aged-out under \u00a71153(d)\u2014\nthe very requirement \u00a71153(h)(3) prescribes for the aged-\nout child to be eligible for automatic conversion in the first\nplace. As the plurality explains, ante, at 5\u20136, such age\ndeterminations occur when an immigration official re-\nviews the child\u2019s derivative visa application, which invari-\nably happens after a visa became available for the child\u2019s\nparent as the principal beneficiary. At best, then, the\nplurality\u2019s interpretation requires USCIS to convert peti-\ntions at a time when it does not know which petitions are\neligible for conversion; at worst, it requires the automatic\n16           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nconversion of petitions benefiting immigrants who will\nnever even qualify for such relief (i.e., aged-out immi-\ngrants who, for any number of reasons, never file a visa\napplication and so are never determined by officials to be\nolder than 21).\n   Faced with this fact, the plurality falls back to the posi-\ntion that automatic conversion must merely be viewed as\nhaving occurred \u201cas of th[e] . . . date\u201d when a parent\u2019s visa\nbecomes available, although the actual \u201cassess[ment]\u201d of\nthe conversion will necessarily occur at some future point\nin time. Ante, at 24, n. 13. That approach, however,\nintroduces precisely the kind of \u201cadditional decisions,\ncontingencies, and delays\u201d that the plurality regards as\ninconsistent with the ordinary meaning of \u201cautomatic,\u201d\nante, at 15. For even under the plurality\u2019s view, automatic\nconversion cannot actually be \u201cassesse[d]\u201d until and unless\nthe aged-out child decides to apply for a visa and officials\nassessing the child\u2019s application deem her to have aged out\n(events which may themselves be contingent on the child\u2019s\nparent first filing her own successful visa application, see\nante, at 6). The far simpler approach is for conversion to\noccur automatically upon the most logical moment sug-\ngested by the statute: the moment when USCIS confirms\nthat an \u201cappropriate category\u201d exists, \u00a71153(h)(3). Indeed,\nthe plurality fails to explain why this cannot be the proper\npredicate; it simply dismisses such an approach as sup-\nported \u201conly\u201d by \u201ca single-minded resolve . . . to grant\nrelief to every possible aged-out beneficiary.\u201d Ante, at 25,\nn. 13. But that criticism is revealing: The \u201csingle-minded\nresolve\u201d the plurality maligns is Congress\u2019 own, for it is\nCongress that expressly provided, in the eligibility clause,\nfor aged-out beneficiaries in all five categories to be granted\nrelief.\n   The plurality\u2019s second argument is a corollary of its\nfirst. If automatic conversion must occur when a visa first\nbecomes available for a parent, the plurality frets, that\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    17\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwill mean an aged-out child will have her petition auto-\nmatically converted before immigration officials can ascer-\ntain whether her parent is even qualified to sponsor her.\nSee ante, at 17\u201318. True enough, but that only confirms\nthat it makes no sense to force USCIS to convert petitions\nso prematurely. The plurality\u2019s fears can all be averted by\nhaving automatic conversion occur, as with petitions\nsponsored by LPRs who later become U. S. citizens, supra,\nat 13\u201315, when USCIS receives confirmation that conver-\nsion is appropriate.7\n   The plurality\u2019s final argument is that something about\nthe term \u201cconversion\u201d precludes relief for all but the aged-\nout derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions. The plurality\naccepts that \u201cconversion\u201d will always require changing\nsome aspects of a petition, including its preference category\n(e.g., from F2A to F2B) and the identity of its principal\nbeneficiary (e.g., from an aged-out child\u2019s parent to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The plurality is unsatisfied with this approach to automatic conver-\n\nsion on the theory that, in order to eliminate all additional \u201cdecisions,\ncontingencies, or delays\u201d in the process, this solution postpones the\nmoment of \u201cconversion\u201d until the necessary contingencies are satisfied.\nYet the plurality\u2019s approach does the same thing, because even on its\naccount, some \u201cdecisions, contingencies, or delays\u201d must occur before\nconversion can actually be assessed by immigration officials (i.e., a\nparent\u2019s visa must become available, the child must apply for a visa,\nand immigration officials must deem her to have aged out, see supra, at\n16). So the only question is whether the \u201cconversion\u201d should be consid-\nered to occur after all \u201cdecisions, contingencies, or delays\u201d are in the\npast such that there is an appropriate category for conversion, or after\nonly some. The former understanding would allow the unambiguous\nlanguage of the eligibility clause to be carried into effect; the latter\nwould preclude relief for four categories of derivative beneficiaries. In\nsupport of its restrictive interpretation, the plurality offers only the\nargument that converting a petition upon proof of an appropriate\ncategory would require the \u201cfiling of a new document. . . that shows the\nparent\u2019s eligibility to sponsor her aged-out [child].\u201d Ante, at 26, n. 14.\nThe fact that a statute may require an agency to process a form is not a\nreason to disregard a coherent reading of a statute in favor of a self-\ncontradictory one.\n18           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nchild). But the plurality asserts that a related kind of\nchange is entirely off the table: a change to the identity of\nthe petition\u2019s sponsor. Ante, at 15. If a converted petition\nrequires a different sponsor than the original petition, the\nplurality suggests, then it cannot be \u201cconverted\u201d at all.\n   The plurality points to nothing in the plain meaning of\n\u201cconversion\u201d that supports this distinction. It instead\nargues that a \u201cconversion\u201d cannot entail a change to the\nidentity of a petition\u2019s sponsor because that is \u201cthe exclu-\nsive way immigration law used the term when Congress\nenacted the CSPA.\u201d Ante, at 16. But immigration law has\nlong allowed petitions to be converted from one category to\nanother in contexts where doing so requires changing the\nsponsor\u2019s identity. In 2006, for example, the Secretary of\nHomeland Security promulgated a regulatory provision\nentitled \u201cautomatic conversion of preference classifica-\ntion,\u201d 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i)(1)(iv), which allows the automatic\nconversion of a petition filed by a U. S. citizen on behalf of\nher spouse to a widower petition if the citizen dies before\nthe petition is approved. That conversion requires chang-\ning the sponsor from the citizen to the widower himself.\nThe fact that the agency used the word \u201cconversion\u201d to\nrefer to a process in which the petition\u2019s sponsor was\nchanged, just a few years after 8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(h)(3) was\nenacted, strongly suggests that the term did not have the\nexclusive meaning that the plurality suggests. Similarly,\n\u00a71154(a)(1)(D)(i)(III), a provision enacted two years before\n\u00a71153(h)(3), see Victims of Trafficking and Violence Pro-\ntection Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1522, provides that a peti-\ntion filed by a battered spouse on behalf of her child \u201cshall\nbe considered\u201d a self-petition filed by the child herself if\nthe child ages out\u2014a conversion that obviously requires\nchanging the identity of the sponsor from the battered\nspouse to the aged-out child. And \u00a71153(h)(4) confirms\nthat such \u201cself-petitioners\u201d are entitled to \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s\nautomatic conversion remedy.

It begins by recognizing\nthat \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s eligibility clause \u201cstates a condition\u201d\nthat is satisfied by aged-out \u201cbeneficiaries from any pref-\nerence category.\u201d Ante, at 2 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in\njudgment). The concurrence thus acknowledges that the\neligibility clause encompasses aged-out beneficiaries of\nfamily-preference petitions in the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and\nF4 categories.\n   The concurrence nonetheless concludes that the BIA\nwas free to exclude F1, F2B, F3, and F4 beneficiaries from\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Moreover, had Congress actually intended to permit relief only\n\nwhere a new petition has the same sponsor as the original petition, it\nhad a ready model in the language of a pre-existing regulation. See 8\nCFR \u00a7204.2(a)(4) (conferring priority date retention on a derivative\nbeneficiary only \u201cif the subsequent petition is filed by the same peti-\ntioner\u201d). If it had wanted to limit \u00a71153(h)(3) to just the beneficiaries\npreferred by the BIA, \u201cCongress could easily have said so.\u201d Kucana v.\nHolder, 558 U. S. 233, 248 (2010).\n   The plurality\u2019s argument that a \u201cconversion\u201d cannot entail a change\nto a petition\u2019s sponsor ultimately boils down to this: A \u201cconversion\u201d\ncannot include \u201cany substantive alteration\u201d to a petition, ante, at 15,\nexcept when it can. For example, a \u201cconversion\u201d can (indeed, must)\nentail changing a petition\u2019s family-preference category and changing\nthe petition\u2019s principal beneficiary (from the aged-out child\u2019s parent to\nthe child herself). And the plurality concedes that in other contexts,\nconversion must entail changing the identity of a petition\u2019s sponsor\nfrom the beneficiary\u2019s qualifying relative to the beneficiary himself.\nAnte, at 16\u201317, n. 10. The plurality does not explain why the word\n\u201cconversion\u201d can encompass all of these other substantive alterations,\nbut not a change to the identity of a petition\u2019s sponsor in just this case.\n20           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe clear scope of the eligibility clause because of a per-\nceived ambiguity as to which beneficiaries can receive\n\u201cautomatic conversion.\u201d See ante, at 4 (\u201cCongress did not\nspeak clearly to which petitions can \u2018automatically be\nconverted\u2019 \u201d). In other words, the concurrence concludes\nthat it was reasonable for the agency to ignore the clear\ntext of the eligibility clause because the phrase \u201cautomatic\nconversion\u201d might be read in a manner that would benefit\nF2A beneficiaries alone.\n   This is an unusual way to interpret a statute. The\nconcurrence identifies no case in which we have deferred\nto an agency\u2019s decision to use ambiguity in one portion of a\nstatute as a license to ignore another statutory provision\nthat is perfectly clear. To the contrary, \u201c[a] provision that\nmay seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the\nremainder of the statutory scheme . . . because only one of\nthe permissible meanings produces a substantive effect\nthat is compatible with the rest of the law.\u201d United Sav.\nAssn. of Tex., 484 U. S., at 371.\n   The concurrence justifies its conclusion only by treating\nthe eligibility clause as a nullity. The concurrence is quite\ncandid about its approach, arguing that \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s relief\nclause is its \u201conly operative provision\u201d and that the eligi-\nbility clause does not \u201cgrant anything to anyone.\u201d Ante, at\n3. Yet \u201c[i]t is our duty \u2018to give effect, if possible, to every\nclause and word of a statute.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Menasche,\n348 U. S. 528, 538\u2013539 (1955). And there is an easy way\nto give meaning to the eligibility clause: The clause identi-\nfies who is entitled to the benefits specified in the ensuing\nrelief clause.\n   The concurrence relies ultimately on an irrelevant\nhypothetical: \u201cIf a student is determined to be enrolled at\nan accredited university, the student\u2019s cost of off-campus\nhousing shall be deductible on her tax return.\u201d Ante, at 3.\nIn this example, the concurrence points out, it is \u201cappar-\nent. . . that an enrolled student who lives on campus is not\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    21\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nentitled to the deduction, even though the student falls\nwithin the conditional first clause.\u201d Ibid. That is correct,\nbut it says nothing about this case. For in the hypothet-\nical, it is plain that the promised relief (a tax deduction for\noff-campus housing) cannot apply to the persons at issue\n(students who live on campus). Here, however, the relief\npromised in \u00a71153(h)(3) (priority date retention and auto-\nmatic conversion) can be given to persons specified in\nthe initial eligibility clause (aged-out children in all five\nfamily-preference categories). See supra, at 9\u201319. And\nonce one recognizes that aged-out children in each cate-\ngory unambiguously covered by the eligibility clause can\nreceive relief, the BIA\u2019s view that no children in four of\nthose categories can ever receive any relief cannot be\nreasonable.9\n                       *    *      *\n  Congress faced a difficult choice when it enacted\n\u00a71153(h)(3). Given the \u201czero-sum world of allocating a\nlimited number of visas,\u201d ante, at 33, Congress could have\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 More  fundamentally, the concurrence\u2019s hypothetical is irrelevant\nbecause it altogether ignores a critical feature of the statute before us:\n\u00a71153(h)(2)\u2019s express enumeration of the covered petitions to include\npetitions filed within the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and F4 preference catego-\nries. See supra, at 5\u20136. A proper analogy would therefore be a provi-\nsion that says the following: \u201cIf a student is determined to be enrolled\nat an accredited junior college, community college, or 4-year college, the\nstudent\u2019s room and board shall be tax-deductible and the student shall\nreceive financial aid.\u201d Is there any permissible reading of this provision\nunder which, although expressly covered in the eligibility clause, all\njunior and community college students are categorically forbidden to\nreceive both the tax deduction and financial aid? Of course not. And\nthat would be true even if the term \u201croom and board\u201d were ambiguous\nand thus open to an interpretation under which only 4-year students\ncould receive the tax deduction. Likewise here, where F1, F2B, F3, and\nF4 derivative beneficiaries may not be categorically excluded from relief\nbecause they are indisputably covered by \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s eligibility clause\nand able to receive the relief described in the relief clause.\n22           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nrequired aged-out children like Ruth Uy to lose their place\nin line and wait many additional years (or even decades)\nbefore being reunited with their parents, or it could have\nenabled such immigrants to retain their place in line\u2014\nalbeit at the cost of extending the wait for other immi-\ngrants by some shorter amount. Whatever one might\nthink of the policy arguments on each side, however, this\nmuch is clear: Congress made a choice. The plurality\u2019s\ncontrary view\u2014that Congress actually delegated the\nchoice to the BIA in a statute that unambiguously encom-\npasses aged-out children in all five preference categories\nand commands that they \u201cshall retain the[ir] original\npriority date[s],\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2014is untenable.\n   In the end, then, this case should have been resolved\nunder a commonsense approach to statutory interpreta-\ntion: Using traditional tools of statutory construction,\nagencies and courts should try to give effect to a statute\u2019s\nclear text before concluding that Congress has legislated\nin conflicting and unintelligible terms. Here, there are\nstraightforward interpretations of \u00a71153(h)(3) that allow it\nto function as a coherent whole. Because the BIA and the\nCourt ignore these interpretations and advance a con-\nstruction that contravenes the language Congress wrote, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n",

Argued December 10, 2013\u2014Decided June 9, 2014\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act permits qualifying U. S. citizens\n  and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) to petition for certain family\n  members to obtain immigrant visas. A sponsored individual, known\n  as the principal beneficiary, is placed into a \u201cfamily preference\u201d cate-\n  gory based on his relationship with the petitioner. 8 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7\u00a71153(a)(1)\u2013(4). The principal beneficiary\u2019s spouse and minor chil-\n  dren in turn qualify as derivative beneficiaries, \u201centitled to the same\n  status\u201d and \u201corder of consideration\u201d as the principal. \u00a71153(d). The\n  beneficiaries then become eligible to apply for visas in order of \u201cprior-\n  ity date\u201d\u2014that is, the date a petition was filed. \u00a71153(e)(1). Because\n  the immigration process often takes years or decades to complete, a\n  child seeking to immigrate may \u201cage out\u201d\u2014i.e., reach adulthood and\n  lose her immigration status\u2014before she reaches the front of the visa\n  queue. The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) sets forth a remedy\n  in that circumstance, providing that \u201c[i]f the age of an alien is deter-\n  mined . . . to be 21 years of age or older,\u201d notwithstanding certain al-\n  lowances for bureaucratic delay, \u00a7\u00a71153(h)(1)\u2013(2), \u201cthe alien\u2019s petition\n  shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the\n  alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the\n  original petition.\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3).\n     Respondents, principal beneficiaries who became LPRs, filed peti-\n  tions for their aged-out children, asserting that the newly filed peti-\n  tions should receive the same priority date as their original petitions.\n  Instead, U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) gave\n  the new petitions current priority dates. The District Court granted\n  the Government summary judgment, deferring to the Board of Immi-\n2                SCIALABBA v.

Pp. 13\u2013\n  33.\n     (a) Because \u00a71153(h)(3) does not speak unambiguously to the issue\n  here, a court must defer to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation. See\n  Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467\n  U. S. 837, 844. The first clause of \u00a71153(h)(3) states a condition that\n  encompasses every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference peti-\n  tion. The second clause, however, does not easily cohere with the\n  first. It prescribes a remedy that can apply to only a subset of the\n  beneficiaries described in the first clause. This remedial prescription\n  directs immigration officials to take the alien\u2019s petition and convert it\n  from a category benefitting a child to an appropriate category for\n  adults, without any change in the petition, including its sponsor, or\n  any new filing. Moreover, this conversion is to be \u201cautomati[c]\u201d\u2014that\n  is, one involving no additional decisions, contingencies, or delays.\n  Thus, the only aliens who may benefit from \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s back half\n  are those for whom automatic conversion is possible.\n     The understanding that \u201cautomatic conversion\u201d entails nothing\n  more than picking up the petition from one category and dropping it\n  into another for which the alien now qualifies matches the exclusive\n  way immigration law used the term when \u00a71153(h)(3) was enacted.\n  See 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i)(1)\u2013(3) (2002). And Congress used the word \u201ccon-\n  version\u201d in the identical way elsewhere in the CSPA. See, e.g.,\n  \u00a7\u00a71151(f)(2), (3).\n     If the term meant more than that in \u00a71153(h)(3), it would under-\n  mine the family preference system\u2019s core premise: that each immi-\n  grant must have a qualified and willing sponsor. See \u00a7\u00a71154(a), (b).\n  If an original sponsor does not have a legally recognized relationship\n  with the aged-out derivative beneficiary, another sponsor, e.g., the\n  old principal beneficiary, must be swapped in for the alien to qualify\n  for a new family preference category. But immigration officials can-\n  not assume that a new sponsor is eligible and willing to petition on\n  the alien\u2019s behalf, given the numerous requirements the law imposes\n  on family preference petitioners. See, e.g., \u00a71154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II). Nei-\n                   Cite as: 573 U.

An alien is deemed to age out on \u201cthe date on which an\nimmigrant visa number became available for the alien\u2019s parent.\u201d\n\u00a71153(h)(1)(A). Since aging out triggers automatic conversion, the\ndate of automatic conversion is best viewed as the same. But at that\ntime, the aged-out beneficiary\u2019s parent cannot yet be a citizen or LPR,\nand so no new, qualified sponsor will be ready to step into the old\none\u2019s shoes.\n   On the above account, \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s second clause provides a reme-\ndy to those principal and derivative beneficiaries who had a qualify-\ning relationship with an LPR both before and after they aged out. In\ncontrast, aliens like respondents\u2019 children\u2014the nieces, nephews, and\ngrandchildren of the initial sponsors\u2014cannot qualify for \u201cautomatic\nconversion\u201d: they lacked a qualifying preference relationship with\nthe initial petitioner, and so cannot fit into a new preference category\nwithout obtaining a new sponsor.\n   The ambiguity created by \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s ill-fitting clauses left the\nBIA to choose how to reconcile the statute\u2019s different commands. It\nreasonably opted to abide by the inherent limits of \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s re-\nmedial clause, rather than go beyond those limits so as to match the\nsweep of the first clause\u2019s condition. When an agency thus resolves\nstatutory tension, ordinary principles of administrative deference re-\nquire this Court to defer. See National Assn. of Home Builders v. De-\nfenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 666. Pp. 13\u201322.\n   (b) Respondents take issue with the BIA\u2019s interpretation, but none\nof their contentions is persuasive. Pp. 22\u201333.\n     (1) Respondents aver that every aged-out beneficiary could be\nautomatically converted if immigration officials substituted new\nsponsors and managed the timing of conversion so that a new sponsor\nexisted on the relevant date. These administrative maneuvers are\nnot in keeping with the natural and long-established meaning of \u201cau-\ntomatic conversion,\u201d they require conversion to occur on a date that\nhas no connection to the alien\u2019s aging out, and they demand adminis-\ntrative juggling to make automatic conversion work. And that pains-\ntakingly managed process still cannot succeed because a derivative\u2019s\nparent may never become able to sponsor a visa\u2014and immigration\nofficials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has done so.\nPp. 22\u201327.\n     (2) Respondents argue that the word \u201cand\u201d in the second clause\nof \u00a71153(h)(3) indicates that priority date retention is a benefit whol-\nly independent of automatic conversion. But \u201cand\u201d does not neces-\n4                 SCIALABBA v.

In other statutory and regulatory provisions re-\n    specting \u201cconversions,\u201d retention of a priority date is conditional on a\n    conversion occurring. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71154(k)(1)\u2013(3). Respondent\u2019s read-\n    ing would make priority date retention conditional on something the\n    statute nowhere mentions. And it would engender unusual results\n    that, without some clearer statement, the Court cannot conclude that\n    Congress intended. Pp. 27\u201330.\n          (3) Finally, respondents contend that, assuming \u00a71153(h)(3) is\n    ambiguous, the BIA acted unreasonably in choosing the more restric-\n    tive reading. But the BIA\u2019s interpretation benefits from administra-\n    tive simplicity and fits with immigration law\u2019s basic first-come, first-\n    served rule. By contrast, respondents would scramble the priority\n    order Congress established by allowing aged-out derivative benefi-\n    ciaries, like respondents\u2019 sons and daughters, to enter the visa queue\n    ahead of beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR\n    for a far longer time. Pp. 31\u201333.\n       THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, agreed that the\n    BIA\u2019s interpretation was reasonable, but not because an agency has\n    authority to resolve direct conflicts within a statute. There is no con-\n    flict or internal tension in \u00a71153(h)(3). The first clause of the provi-\n    sion defines the persons potentially affected, but does not grant any-\n    thing to anyone. The particular benefit provided by the statute\u2014\n    automatic conversion and retention of priority date\u2014is found exclu-\n    sively in the second clause, and that relief requires, at minimum,\n    that an aged-out beneficiary have his own eligible sponsor who is\n    committed to providing financial support for the beneficiary. Beyond\n    that, Congress did not speak clearly to which petitions can be auto-\n    matically converted.       The BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of\n    \u00a71153(h)(3) is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory\n    terms, with the established meaning of automatic conversion in im-\n    migration law, and with the structure of the family-based immigra-\n    tion system.

S. C.\n\u00a71101 et seq., citizens and lawful permanent residents\n(LPRs) of the United States may petition for certain fam-\nily members\u2014spouses, siblings, and children of various\nages\u2014to obtain immigrant visas. Such a sponsored indi-\nvidual is known as the petition\u2019s principal beneficiary. In\nturn, any principal beneficiary\u2019s minor child\u2014meaning an\nunmarried child under the age of 21\u2014qualifies as a deriv-\native beneficiary, \u201centitled to the same [immigration]\nstatus\u201d and \u201corder of consideration\u201d as his parent.\n\u00a71153(d). Accordingly, when a visa becomes available to\nthe petition\u2019s principal beneficiary, one also becomes\navailable to her minor child.\n   But what happens if, sometime after the relevant peti-\ntion was filed, a minor child (whether a principal or a\nderivative beneficiary) has turned 21\u2014or, in immigration\n2              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                        Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nlingo, has \u201caged out\u201d? The immigration process may take\nyears or even decades to complete, due in part to bureau-\ncratic delays associated with reviewing immigration doc-\numents and in (still greater) part to long queues for the\nlimited number of visas available each year. So someone\nwho was a youngster at the start of the process may be an\nadult at the end, and no longer qualify for an immigration\nstatus given to minors. The Child Status Protection Act\n(CSPA), 116 Stat. 927, ensures that the time Government\nofficials have spent processing immigration papers will not\ncount against the beneficiary in assessing his status. See\n8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(h)(1). But even with that provision, the\nbeneficiary may age out solely because of the time he\nspent waiting in line for a visa to become available.\n   The question presented in this case is whether the\nCSPA grants a remedy to all aliens who have thus out-\npaced the immigration process\u2014that is, all aliens who\ncounted as child beneficiaries when a sponsoring petition\nwas filed, but no longer do so (even after excluding admin-\nistrative delays) by the time they reach the front of the\nvisa queue. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or\nBoard) said no. It interpreted the CSPA as providing\nrelief to only a subset of that group\u2014specifically, those\naged-out aliens who qualified or could have qualified as\nprincipal beneficiaries of a visa petition, rather than only\nas derivative beneficiaries piggy-backing on a parent. We\nnow uphold the Board\u2019s determination as a permissible\nconstruction of the statute.\n                           I\n\n                           A\n\n  An alien needs an immigrant visa to enter and perma-\nnently reside in the United States.

See \u00a7\u00a71151(a)\u2013(b). The most favored is for the\n\u201cimmediate relatives\u201d of U. S. citizens\u2014their parents,\nspouses, and unmarried children under the age of 21.\nSee \u00a7\u00a71151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1101(b)(1). Five other categories\u2014\ncrucial to this case, and often denominated \u201cpreference\u201d\ncategories\u2014are for \u201cfamily-sponsored immigrants,\u201d who\ninclude more distant or independent relatives of U. S.\ncitizens, and certain close relatives of LPRs.2 Specifically,\nthose family preference categories are:\n     F1: the unmarried, adult (21 or over) sons and daugh-\n     ters of U. S. citizens;\n     F2A: the spouses and unmarried, minor (under 21)\n     children of LPRs;\n     F2B: the unmarried, adult (21 or over) sons and\n     daughters of LPRs;\n     F3: the married sons and daughters of U.

See Brief for Petitioners 3, n. 1.\n  3 Immigrant visas can also go to aliens with special, marketable\n\nskills, see \u00a7\u00a71151(a)(2), 1153(b), or to aliens from countries with histori-\ncally low immigration to the United States, see \u00a7\u00a71151(a)(3), 1153(c).\nNone of the respondents here sought visas under those \u201cemployment-\nbased\u201d or \u201cdiversity\u201d categories.\n4             SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                      Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\n   The road to obtaining any family-based immigrant visa\nbegins when a sponsoring U. S. citizen or LPR files a\npetition on behalf of a foreign relative, termed the princi-\npal beneficiary. See \u00a7\u00a71154(a)(1)(A)(i), (a)(1)(B)(i)(I), (b); 8\nCFR \u00a7204.1(a)(1) (2014). The sponsor (otherwise known\nas the petitioner\u2014we use the words interchangeably)\nmust provide U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\n(USCIS) with evidence showing, among other things, that\nshe has the necessary familial relationship with the\nbeneficiary, see \u00a7\u00a7204.2(a)(2), (d)(2), (g)(2), and that she\nhas not committed any conduct disqualifying her from\nsponsoring an alien for a visa, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II) (barring an LPR from submitting a\npetition if she has committed certain offenses against\nminors). USCIS thereafter reviews the petition, and\napproves it if found to meet all requirements. See\n\u00a71154(b).\n   For a family preference beneficiary, that approval re-\nsults not in getting a visa then and there, but only in\ngetting a place in line. (The case is different for \u201cimmedi-\nate relatives\u201d of U. S. citizens, who can apply for and\nreceive a visa as soon as a sponsoring petition is ap-\nproved.) The law caps the number of visas issued each\nyear in the five family preference categories, see\n\u00a7\u00a71151(c)(1), 1152, 1153(a)(1)\u2013(4), and demand regularly\nexceeds the supply. As a consequence, the principal bene-\nficiary of an approved petition is placed in a queue with\nothers in her category (F1, F2A, or what have you) in\norder of \u201cpriority date\u201d\u2014that is, the date a petition was\nfiled with USCIS. See \u00a71153(e)(1); 8 CFR \u00a7204.1(b); 22\nCFR 42.53(a) (2013). Every month, the Department of\nState sets a cut-off date for each family preference category,\nindicating that visas (sometimes referred to by \u201cvisa\nnumbers\u201d) are available for beneficiaries with priority\ndates earlier than the cut-off. See 8 CFR \u00a7245.1(g)(1); 22\nCFR \u00a742.51(b). The system is thus first-come, first-served\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nwithin each preference category, with visas becoming\navailable in order of priority date.\n   Such a date may benefit not only the principal benefi-\nciary of a family preference petition, but also her spouse\nand minor children. Those persons, labeled the petition\u2019s\n\u201cderivative beneficiar[ies],\u201d are \u201centitled to the same sta-\ntus, and the same order of consideration\u201d as the principal.\n8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71153(d), (h). Accordingly, when a visa be-\ncomes available for the principal, one becomes available\nfor her spouse and minor children too. And that is so even\nwhen (as is usually but not always the case) the spouse\nand children would not qualify for any family preference\ncategory on their own. For example, the child of an F4\npetition\u2019s principal beneficiary is the niece or nephew of a\nU. S. citizen, and federal immigration law does not recog-\nnize that relationship. Nonetheless, the child can piggy-\nback on his qualifying parent in seeking an immigrant\nvisa\u2014although, as will be further discussed, he may not\nimmigrate without her. See 22 CFR \u00a740.1(a)(2); infra, at\n6, 20\u201321, 31\u201332.\n   Once visas become available, the principal and any\nderivative beneficiaries must separately file visa applica-\ntions. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71202(a). Such an application re-\nquires an alien to demonstrate in various ways her ad-\nmissibility to the United States. See, e.g., \u00a71182(a)\n(1)(A) (alien may not have serious health problems);\n\u00a71182(a)(2)(A) (alien may not have been convicted of cer-\ntain crimes); \u00a71182(a)(3)(B) (alien may not have engaged\nin terrorist activity). Notably, one necessary showing\ninvolves the U. S. citizen or LPR who filed the initial\npetition: To mitigate any possibility of becoming a \u201cpublic\ncharge,\u201d the visa applicant (whether a principal or de-\nrivative beneficiary) must append an \u201caffidavit of sup-\nport\u201d    executed     by    that     sponsoring   individual.\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(4)(C)(ii), 1183a(a)(1). Such an affidavit legally\ncommits the sponsor to support the alien, usually for at\n6               SCIALABBA v.

See \u00a71202(h).\nThe interviews for a principal and her children (or spouse)\nusually occur back-to-back, although those for the children\nmay also come later.4 The consular official will determine\nfirst whether the principal should receive a visa; if (but\nonly if) the answer is yes, the official will then consider the\nderivatives\u2019 applications. See 22 CFR \u00a7\u00a740.1(a)(2), 42.62,\n42.81(a). Provided all goes well, everyone exits the consu-\nlate with visas in hand\u2014but that still does not make them\nLPRs. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71154(e). Each approved alien must\nthen travel to the United States within a set time, undergo\ninspection, and confirm her admissibility. See \u00a7\u00a71201(c),\n1222, 1225(a)\u2013(b). Once again, a derivative\u2019s fate is tied to\nthe principal\u2019s: If the principal cannot enter the country,\nneither can her children (or spouse). See \u00a71153(d); 22 CFR\n\u00a740.1(a)(2). When, but only when, an alien with an immi-\ngrant visa is approved at the border does she finally be-\ncome an LPR.5\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See Dept. of State, The Immigrant Visa Process: Visa Applicant\n\nInterview,    online    at   http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/\nimmigrate/immigrant-process/interview/applicant_interview.html (all\nInternet materials as visited June 5, 2014, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file).\n  5 The last part of the immigration process is streamlined for aliens\n\nalready residing in the United States who have applied for adjustment\nof status. See n. 1, supra. The immigration officer interviewing such\nan alien, upon finding her visa-eligible, may declare her an LPR on the\nspot. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71255(i)(2). But here too, the officer will not make\na derivative beneficiary an LPR unless and until he approves that\nstatus for the principal.

At the front\nend, many months may go by before USCIS approves the\ninitial sponsoring petition.6 On the back end, several\nadditional months may elapse while a consular official\nconsiders the alien\u2019s visa application and schedules an\ninterview.7 And the middle is the worst. After a sponsor-\ning petition is approved but before a visa application can\nbe filed, a family-sponsored immigrant may stand in line\nfor years\u2014or even decades\u2014just waiting for an immigrant\nvisa to become available. See, e.g., Dept. of State, Bureau\nof Consular Affairs, 9 Visa Bulletin, Immigrant Numbers\nfor December 2013 (Nov. 8, 2013).\n   And as the years tick by, young people grow up, and\nthereby endanger their immigration status. Remember\nthat not all offspring, but only those under the age of 21\ncan qualify as an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d of a U. S. citizen, or\nas the principal beneficiary of an LPR\u2019s F2A petition, or\n(most crucially here) as the derivative beneficiary of any\nfamily preference petition. See supra, at 3, 5. So an alien\neligible to immigrate at the start of the process (when a\nsponsor files a petition) might not be so at the end (when\nan immigration official reviews his documents for admis-\nsion). He may have \u201caged out\u201d of his original immigration\nstatus by the simple passage of time.\n   In 2002, Congress enacted the Child Status Protection\nAct (CSPA), 116 Stat. 927, to address the treatment of\nthose once-but-no-longer-minor aliens. One section of the\nAct neatly eliminates the \u201caging out\u201d problem for the\noffspring of U.

S. C. \u00a71151(f )(1).\nThe section thus halts the flow of time for that group of\nwould-be immigrants: If an alien was young when a U. S.\ncitizen sponsored his entry, then Peter Pan-like, he re-\nmains young throughout the immigration process.\n   A different scheme\u2014and one not nearly so limpid\u2014\napplies to the offspring of LPRs and aliens who initially\nqualified as either principal beneficiaries of F2A petitions\nor derivative beneficiaries of any kind of family preference\npetition. Section 3 of the CSPA, now codified at 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71153(h), contains three interlinked paragraphs that\nmitigate the \u201caging out\u201d problem for those prospective\nimmigrants.

See supra, at 6\u20137. The months that\nelapse before USCIS personnel approve a family prefer-\nence petition (\u201cthe period during which the applicable\npetition described in paragraph (2) was pending\u201d) do not\ncount against an alien in determining his statutory \u201cage.\u201d\nNeither do the months a consular officer lets pass before\nadjudicating the alien\u2019s own visa application (the period\nafter \u201can immigrant visa number becomes available for\nsuch alien (or . . . [his] parent)\u201d). But the time in be-\ntween\u2014the months or, more likely, years the alien spends\nsimply waiting for a visa to become available\u2014is not\nsimilarly excluded in calculating his age: Every day the\nalien stands in that line is a day he grows older, under the\nimmigration laws no less than in life. And so derivative\nbeneficiaries, as well as principal beneficiaries of F2A\npetitions, can still \u201cage out\u201d\u2014in other words, turn 21,\nnotwithstanding \u00a71153(h)(1)\u2019s dual age adjustments\u2014\nprior to receiving an opportunity to immigrate.\n  What happens then (if anything) is the subject of\n\u00a71153(h)\u2019s third paragraph\u2014the provision at issue in this\ncase. That paragraph states:\n       \u201cIf the age of an alien is determined under para-\n     graph (1) to be 21 years of age or older for the purposes\n     of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d) of this section, the\n     alien\u2019s petition shall automatically be converted to the\n     appropriate category and the alien shall retain the\n     original priority date issued upon receipt of the origi-\n     nal petition.\u201d\nThe provision thus first references the aged-out beneficiar-\nies of family preference petitions, and then directs immi-\ngration officials to do something whose meaning this\nopinion will further consider\u2014i.e., \u201cautomatically convert\u201d\nan alien\u2019s petition to an \u201cappropriate category.\u201d\n  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) addressed the\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nmeaning of \u00a71153(h)(3) in Matter of Wang, 25 I. & N. Dec.\n28 (2009); its interpretation there is what we review in\nthis case. Wang was the principal beneficiary of an F4\npetition that his sister, a U. S. citizen, filed in 1992. At\nthat time, Wang\u2019s daughter was 10 years old, and thus\nqualified as a derivative beneficiary. But Wang waited in\nline for a visa for more than a decade, and by the time his\npriority date finally came up, his daughter had turned 22\n(even after applying \u00a71153(h)(1)\u2019s age-reduction formula).\nWang thus obtained a visa for himself, boarded a plane\nalone, and entered the United States as an LPR. He then\nfiled a new preference petition on his daughter\u2019s behalf\u2014\nthis one under F2B, the category for LPRs\u2019 adult sons and\ndaughters. USCIS approved that petition, with a priority\ndate corresponding to the date of Wang\u2019s filing. Wang\ncontended that under \u00a71153(h)(3), his daughter was in-\nstead entitled to \u201cretain the original priority date\u201d given to\nhis sister\u2019s old F4 petition, because that petition could\n\u201cautomatically be converted\u201d to the F2B category.\n   The Board rejected that argument. It explained that\n\u201cthe language of [\u00a71153(h)(3)] does not expressly state\nwhich petitions qualify for automatic conversion and\nretention of priority dates.\u201d Id., at 33. Given that \u201cambi-\nguity,\u201d the BIA looked to the \u201crecognized meaning\u201d of \u201cthe\nphrase \u2018automatic conversion\u2019 \u201d in immigration statutes\nand regulations\u2014which it \u201cpresume[d]\u201d Congress under-\nstood when enacting the CSPA. Id., at 33\u201335. \u201cHistorically,\u201d\nthe BIA showed, that language applied only when a\npetition could move seamlessly from one family preference\ncategory to another\u2014not when a new sponsor was needed\nto fit a beneficiary into a different category. Id., at 35.\nSome aged-out aliens\u2019 petitions could accomplish that\nmaneuver, because the alien had a qualifying relationship\nwith the original sponsor, and continued to do so upon\naging out; in that event, the Board held, \u00a71153(h)(3) en-\nsured that the alien would retain his original priority date.\n12           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nSee id., at 34\u201335. But the F4 petition filed by Wang\u2019s\nsister could not \u201cautomatically be converted\u201d in that way\nbecause Wang\u2019s daughter never had a qualifying relation-\nship with the sponsor: \u201c[N]o category exists for the niece of\na United States citizen.\u201d Id., at 35\u201336. That is why Wang\nhimself had to file a new petition on his daughter\u2019s behalf\nonce she aged out and could no longer ride on his sibling\nstatus. The Board saw no evidence that Congress meant\n\u201cto expand the use of the concept[ ] of automatic conver-\nsion\u201d to reach such a case. Id., at 36. And the Board\nthought such an expansion unwarranted because it would\nallow aliens like Wang\u2019s daughter, who lacked any inde-\npendent entitlement to a visa during the years her father\nspent standing on the F4 queue, to \u201ccut[ ] in line ahead of\nothers awaiting visas in other preference categories.\u201d Id.,\nat 38.\n                               C\n   The respondents in this case are similarly situated to\nWang, and they seek the same relief. Each was once the\nprincipal beneficiary of either an F3 petition filed by a\nU. S. citizen parent or an F4 petition filed by a U. S. citi-\nzen sibling. Each also has a son or daughter who, on the\ndate of filing, was under 21 and thus qualified as a deriva-\ntive beneficiary of the petition. But as was true of Wang\u2019s\ndaughter, the respondents\u2019 offspring had all turned 21\n(even accounting for \u00a71153(h)(1)\u2019s age adjustments) by the\ntime visas became available. Accordingly, the respondents\nimmigrated to the United States alone and, as new LPRs,\nfiled F2B petitions for their sons and daughters. Each\nargued that under \u00a71153(h)(3), those petitions should get\nthe same priority date as the original F3 and F4 petitions\nonce had. USCIS instead gave the new F2B petitions\ncurrent priority dates, meaning that the sons and daugh-\nters could not leapfrog over others in the F2B line.\n   This case began as two separate suits, one joining many\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

In each suit, the District Court deferred to the\nBIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71153(h)(3) in Wang, and accord-\ningly granted summary judgment to the Government. See\nZhang v.

See Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837, 842\u2013844 (1984); INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S.\n415, 424\u2013425 (1999). Indeed, \u201cjudicial deference to the\nExecutive Branch is especially appropriate in the immi-\ngration context,\u201d where decisions about a complex statu-\ntory scheme often implicate foreign relations.

CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nagree with the \u201ccomplexity\u201d point.) Under Chevron, the\nstatute\u2019s plain meaning controls, whatever the Board\nmight have to say. See 467 U. S., at 842\u2013843. But if the\nlaw does not speak clearly to the question at issue, a court\nmust defer to the Board\u2019s reasonable interpretation, ra-\nther than substitute its own reading. Id., at 844.\n   And \u00a71153(h)(3) does not speak unambiguously to the\nissue here\u2014or more precisely put, it addresses that issue\nin divergent ways. We might call the provision Janus-\nfaced. Its first half looks in one direction, toward the\nsweeping relief the respondents propose, which would\nreach every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference\npetition. But as the BIA recognized, and we will further\nexplain, the section\u2019s second half looks another way, to-\nward a remedy that can apply to only a subset of those\nbeneficiaries\u2014and one not including the respondents\u2019\noffspring. The two faces of the statute do not easily cohere\nwith each other: Read either most naturally, and the other\nappears to mean not what it says. That internal tension\nmakes possible alternative reasonable constructions,\nbringing into correspondence in one way or another the\nsection\u2019s different parts. And when that is so, Chevron\ndictates that a court defer to the agency\u2019s choice\u2014here, to\nthe Board\u2019s expert judgment about which interpretation\nfits best with, and makes most sense of, the statutory\nscheme.\n   Begin by reading the statute from the top\u2014the part\nfavoring the respondents.        Section 1153(h)(3)\u2019s first\nclause\u2014\u201cIf the age of an alien is determined under para-\ngraph (1) to be 21 years of age or older for the purposes of\nsubsections (a)(2)(A) and (d)\u201d\u2014states a condition that\nevery aged-out beneficiary of a preference petition satis-\nfies. That is because all those beneficiaries have had their\nages \u201cdetermined under paragraph (1)\u201d (and have come up\nwanting): Recall that the age formula of \u00a71153(h)(1) ap-\nplies to each alien child who originally qualified (under\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\n\u201csubsections (a)(2)(A) and (d)\u201d) as the principal beneficiary\nof an F2A petition or the derivative beneficiary of any\nfamily preference petition. On its own, then, \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s\nopening clause encompasses the respondents\u2019 sons and\ndaughters, along with every other once-young beneficiary\nof a family preference petition now on the wrong side of\n21. If the next phrase said something like \u201cthe alien shall\nbe treated as though still a minor\u201d (much as the CSPA did\nto ensure U. S. citizens\u2019 children, qualifying as \u201cimmediate\nrelatives,\u201d would stay forever young, see supra, at 7\u20138), all\nthose aged-out beneficiaries would prevail in this case.\n   But read on, because \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s second clause instead\nprescribes a remedy containing its own limitation on the\neligible class of recipients. \u201c[T]he alien\u2019s petition,\u201d that\npart provides, \u201cshall automatically be converted to the\nappropriate category and the alien shall retain the origi-\nnal priority date.\u201d That statement directs immigration\nofficials to take the initial petition benefitting an alien\nchild, and now that he has turned 21, \u201cconvert[ ]\u201d that\nsame petition from a category for children to an \u201cappropri-\nate category\u201d for adults (while letting him keep the old\npriority date). The \u201cconversion,\u201d in other words, is merely\nfrom one category to another; it does not entail any change\nin the petition, including its sponsor, let alone any new\nfiling. And more, that category shift is to be \u201cautomatic\u201d\u2014\nthat is, one involving no additional decisions, contingen-\ncies, or delays. See, e.g., Random House Webster\u2019s Una-\nbridged Dictionary 140 (2d ed. 2001) (defining \u201cautomatic\u201d\nas \u201chaving the capability of starting, operating, moving,\netc., independently\u201d); The American Heritage Dictionary\n122 (4th ed. 2000) (\u201c[a]cting or operating in a manner\nessentially independent of external influence\u201d). The oper-\nation described is, then, a mechanical cut-and-paste job\u2014\nmoving a petition, without any substantive alteration,\nfrom one (no-longer-appropriate, child-based) category to\nanother (now-appropriate, adult) compartment. And so\n16              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                          Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nthe aliens who may benefit from \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s back half\nare only those for whom that procedure is possible. The\nclause offers relief not to every aged-out beneficiary, but\njust to those covered by petitions that can roll over, seam-\nlessly and promptly, into a category for adult relatives.\n   That understanding of \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s \u201cautomatic conver-\nsion\u201d language matches the exclusive way immigration\nlaw used the term when Congress enacted the CSPA. For\nmany years before then (as today), a regulation entitled\n\u201cAutomatic conversion of preference classification\u201d in-\nstructed immigration officials to change the preference\ncategory of a petition\u2019s principal beneficiary when either\nhis or his sponsor\u2019s status changed in specified ways. See\n8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7204.2(i)(1)\u2013(3) (2002). For example, the regula-\ntion provided that when a U. S. citizen\u2019s child aged out, his\n\u201cimmediate relative\u201d petition converted to an F1 petition,\nwith his original priority date left intact. See \u00a7204.2(i)(2).\nSimilarly, when a U. S. citizen\u2019s adult son married, his\noriginal petition migrated from F1 to F3, see \u00a7204.2(i)\n(1)(i); when, conversely, such a person divorced, his peti-\ntion converted from F3 to F1, see \u00a7204.2(i)(1)(iii); and\nwhen a minor child\u2019s LPR parent became a citizen, his\nF2A petition became an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d petition, see\n\u00a7204.2(i)(3)\u2014all again with their original priority dates.\nMost notable here, what all of those authorized changes\nhad in common was that they could occur without any\nchange in the petitioner\u2019s identity, or otherwise in the\npetition\u2019s content. In each circumstance, the \u201cautomatic\nconversion\u201d entailed nothing more than picking up the\npetition from one category and dropping it into another for\nwhich the alien now qualified.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The dissent responds to this fact only with a pair of non-sequiturs.\n\nPost, at 18\u201319 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). First, the dissent cites a\nstatutory provision that does not use the word \u201cconversion\u201d at all, so\ncan hardly attest to its meaning. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71154(a)(1)(D)(i)(III).\nAnd next, the dissent cites a regulation that post-dated the CSPA by\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\n   Congress used the word \u201cconversion\u201d (even without the\nmodifier \u201cautomatic\u201d) in the identical way in two other\nsections of the CSPA. See Law v. Siegel, 571 U. S. ___, ___\n(slip op., at 7) (2014) (\u201c[W]ords repeated in different parts\nof the same statute generally have the same meaning\u201d).\nSection 2 refers to occasions on which, by virtue of the\nabove-described regulation, a petition \u201cconverted\u201d from\nF2A to the \u201cimmediate relative\u201d category because of the\nsponsor parent\u2019s naturalization, or from the F3 to the\nF1 box because of the beneficiary\u2019s divorce. 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71151(f )(2), (3). Then, in \u00a76, Congress authorized an\nadditional conversion of the same nature: It directed that\nwhen an LPR parent-sponsor naturalizes, the petition he\nhas filed for his adult son or daughter \u201cshall be converted,\u201d\nunless the beneficiary objects, from the F2B to the F1\ncompartment\u2014again with the original priority date un-\nchanged. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71154(k)(1)\u2013(3). (That opt-out mech-\nanism itself underscores the otherwise mechanical nature\nof the conversion.) Once again, in those cases, all that is\ninvolved is a recategorization\u2014moving the same petition,\nfiled by the same petitioner, from one preference classifi-\ncation to another, so as to reflect a change in either the\nalien\u2019s or his sponsor\u2019s status. In the rest of the CSPA, as\nin the prior immigration regulation, that is what \u201cconver-\nsion\u201d means.\n   And if the term meant more than that in \u00a71153(h)(3), it\nwould undermine the family preference system\u2019s core\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nyears, and thus is equally irrelevant to what Congress intended. See 71\nFed. Reg. 35732, 35749 (2006) (adding 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i)(1)(iv)). More-\nover, both provisions relate to a sui generis circumstance in which a\nperson can self-petition for a visa because her U. S. citizen or LPR\nrelative either died or engaged in domestic abuse. In that situation, the\nalien\u2019s eligibility rests throughout on her connection to the deceased or\nabusive relative; no new party must ever come in, as one has to in a\ncase like Wang, to salvage a no-longer-effective petition. See infra, at\n18 (addressing the problems that the substitution of a new petitioner\nraises).\n18           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                      Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\npremise: that each immigrant must have a qualified spon-\nsor. Consider the alternative addressed in Wang\u2014if\n\u201cautomatic conversion\u201d were also to encompass the substi-\ntution of a new petitioner for the old one, to make sure the\naged-out alien\u2019s petition fits into a new preference category.\nIn a case like Wang, recall, the original sponsor does\nnot have a legally recognized relationship with the aged-\nout derivative beneficiary (they are aunt and niece); ac-\ncordingly, the derivative\u2019s father\u2014the old principal benefi-\nciary\u2014must be swapped in as the petitioner to enable his\ndaughter to immigrate. But what if, at that point, the\nfather is in no position to sponsor his daughter? Suppose\nhe decided in the end not to immigrate, or failed to pass\nborder inspection, or died in the meanwhile. Or suppose\nhe entered the country, but cannot sponsor a relative\u2019s\nvisa because he lacks adequate proof of parentage or\ncommitted a disqualifying crime. See \u00a71154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II);\n8 CFR \u00a7204.2(d)(2); supra, at 4. Or suppose he does not\nwant to\u2014or simply cannot\u2014undertake the significant\nfinancial obligations that the law imposes on someone\npetitioning for an alien\u2019s admission.         See 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71183a(a)(1)(A), (f )(1)(D); supra, at 5. Immigration offi-\ncials cannot assume away all those potential barriers to\nentry: That would run counter to the family preference\nsystem\u2019s insistence that a qualified and willing sponsor\nback every immigrant visa. See \u00a7\u00a71154(a)\u2013(b). But nei-\nther can they easily, or perhaps at all, figure out whether\nsuch a sponsor exists unless he files and USCIS approves\na new petition\u2014the very thing \u00a71153(h)(3) says is not\nrequired.\n   Indeed, in cases like Wang, the problem is broader:\nUnder the statute\u2019s most natural reading, a new qualified\nsponsor will hardly ever exist at the moment the petition\nis to be \u201cconverted.\u201d Section 1153(h)(3), to be sure, does\nnot explicitly identify that point in time. But \u00a71153(h)(1)\nspecifies the date on which a derivative beneficiary is\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\ndeemed to have either aged out or not: It is \u201cthe date on\nwhich an immigrant visa number became available for the\nalien\u2019s parent.\u201d See \u00a7\u00a71153(h)(1)(A)\u2013(B). Because that\nstatutory aging out is the one and only thing that triggers\nautomatic conversion for eligible aliens, the date of con-\nversion is best viewed as the same. That reading, more-\nover, comports with the \u201cautomatic conversion\u201d regulation\non which Congress drew in enacting the CSPA, see supra,\nat 16\u201317: The rule authorizes conversions \u201cupon\u201d or \u201cas of\nthe date\u201d of the relevant change in the alien\u2019s status (in-\ncluding turning 21))\u2014regardless when USCIS may re-\nceive notice of the change. 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i); but cf. post, at\n14 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (wrongly stating that\nunder that rule conversion occurs upon the agency\u2019s re-\nceipt of proof of the change). But on that date, no new\npetitioner will be ready to step into the old one\u2019s shoes if\nsuch a substitution is needed to fit an aged-out beneficiary\ninto a different category. The beneficiary\u2019s parent, on the\nday a \u201cvisa number became available,\u201d cannot yet be an\nLPR or citizen; by definition, she has just become eligible\nto apply for a visa, and faces a wait of at least several\nmonths before she can sponsor an alien herself. Nor,\nexcept in a trivial number of cases, is any hitherto uniden-\ntified person likely to have a legally recognized relation-\nship to the alien. So if an aged-out beneficiary has lost his\nqualifying connection to the original petitioner, no conver-\nsion to an \u201cappropriate category\u201d can take place at the\nrequisite time. As long as immigration law demands some\nvalid sponsor, \u00a71153(h)(3) cannot give such an alien the\ndesignated relief.\n   On the above account\u2014in which conversion entails a\nsimple reslotting of an original petition into a now-\nappropriate category\u2014\u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s back half provides a\nremedy to two groups of aged-out beneficiaries. First, any\nchild who was the principal beneficiary of an F2A petition\n(filed by an LPR parent on his behalf) can take advantage\n20               SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                           Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nof that clause after turning 21. He is, upon aging out, the\nadult son of the same LPR who sponsored him as a child;\nhis petition can therefore be moved seamlessly\u2014without\nthe slightest alteration or delay\u2014into the F2B category.\nSecond, any child who was the derivative beneficiary of an\nF2A petition (filed by an LPR on his spouse\u2019s behalf) can\nsimilarly claim relief, provided that under the statute, he\nis not just the spouse\u2019s but also the petitioner\u2019s child.11\nSuch an alien is identically situated to the aged-out prin-\ncipal beneficiary of an F2A petition; indeed, for the price of\nanother filing fee, he could just as easily have been named\na principal himself. He too is now the adult son of the\noriginal LPR petitioner, and his petition can also be in-\nstantly relabeled an F2B petition, without any need to\nsubstitute a new sponsor or make other revisions. In each\ncase, the alien had a qualifying relationship before he was\n21 and retains it afterward; all that must be changed is\nthe label affixed to his petition.12\n   In contrast, as the Board held in Wang, the aged-out\nderivative beneficiaries of the other family preference\ncategories\u2014like the sons and daughters of the respond-\nents here\u2014cannot qualify for \u201cautomatic conversion.\u201d\nRecall that the respondents themselves were principal\nbeneficiaries of F3 and F4 petitions; their children, when\nunder 21, counted as derivatives, but lacked any qualify-\ning preference relationship of their own. The F3 deriva-\ntives were the petitioners\u2019 grandsons and granddaughters;\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    11 Given the statute\u2019s broad definition of \u201cchild,\u201d the only F2A deriva-\n\ntive beneficiaries who fall outside that proviso are stepchildren who\nwere over the age of 18 when the petitioner married the spousal benefi-\nciary. See \u00a71101(b)(1)(B). The Government represents that thousands\nof children are designated as F2A derivatives every year. See Reply\nBrief 18, n. 13.\n    12 It is, therefore, impossible to understand the dissent\u2019s statement\n\nthat conversion of such a petition to an appropriate category requires\n\u201c \u2018substantive alteration\u2019 to [the] petition.\u201d See post, at 19, n. 8 (opinion\nof SOTOMAYOR, J.).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71153(a)(3)\u2013\n(4). Now that the respondents\u2019 children have turned 21,\nand they can no longer ride on their parents\u2019 coattails,\nthat lack of independent eligibility makes a difference.\nFor them, unlike for the F2A beneficiaries, it is impossible\nsimply to slide the original petitions from a (no-longer-\nappropriate) child category to a (now-appropriate) adult\none. To fit into a new category, those aged-out derivatives,\nlike Wang\u2019s daughter, must have new sponsors\u2014and for\nall the reasons already stated, that need means they\ncannot benefit from \u201cautomatic conversion.\u201d\n   All that said, we hold only that \u00a71153(h)(3) permits\u2014not\nthat it requires\u2014the Board\u2019s decision to so distinguish\namong aged-out beneficiaries. That is because, as we\nexplained earlier, the two halves of \u00a71153(h)(3) face in\ndifferent directions. See supra, at 14. Section 1153(h)(3)\u2019s\nfirst part\u2014its conditional phrase\u2014encompasses every\naged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition, and\nthus points toward broad-based relief. But as just shown,\n\u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s second part\u2014its remedial prescription\u2014\napplies only to a narrower class of beneficiaries: those\naliens who naturally qualify for (and so can be \u201cautomati-\ncally converted\u201d to) a new preference classification when\nthey age out. Were there an interpretation that gave each\nclause full effect, the Board would have been required to\nadopt it. But the ambiguity those ill-fitting clauses create\ninstead left the Board with a choice\u2014essentially of how to\nreconcile the statute\u2019s different commands. The Board,\nrecognizing the need to make that call, opted to abide by\nthe inherent limits of \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s remedial clause, rather\nthan go beyond those limits so as to match the sweep of\nthe section\u2019s initial condition. On the Board\u2019s reasoned\nview, the only beneficiaries entitled to statutory relief are\nthose capable of obtaining the remedy designated. When\n22           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nan agency thus resolves statutory tension, ordinary prin-\nciples of administrative deference require us to defer. See\nNational Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n551 U. S. 644, 666 (2007) (When a statutory scheme con-\ntains \u201ca fundamental ambiguity\u201d arising from \u201cthe differ-\ning mandates\u201d of two provisions, \u201cit is appropriate to look\nto the implementing agency\u2019s expert interpretation\u201d to\ndetermine which \u201cmust give way\u201d).\n                              III\n  The respondents urge us to overturn the Board\u2019s judg-\nment for three independent reasons. First, and principally,\nthey take issue with the Board\u2019s\u2014and now our\u2014view\nof the limits associated with \u201cautomatic conversion\u201d: They\nargue that every aged-out beneficiary\u2019s petition can \u201cau-\ntomatically be converted\u201d to an \u201cappropriate category,\u201d\nand that the two halves of \u00a71153(h)(3) are thus reconcila-\nble. Second, the respondents contend that even if \u201cauto-\nmatic conversion\u201d does not extend so far, \u00a71153(h)(3)\nseparately entitles each such beneficiary to the benefit of\nhis original petition\u2019s priority date. And third, they claim\nthat the Board\u2019s way of resolving whatever ambiguity\ninheres in \u00a71153(h)(3) is arbitrary and capricious. The\ndissenting opinion reiterates the first two arguments,\nthough with slight variation and in opposite order, while\nforgoing the third.       See post, at 9\u201319 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.) (hereinafter the dissent). We find none of\nthe contentions persuasive.\n                            A\n  The respondents (and the dissent) initially aver that\nevery aged-out beneficiary (including their own sons and\ndaughters) can \u201cautomatically be converted\u201d to an \u201cappro-\npriate\u201d immigration category, if only immigration officials\ntry hard enough.

Brief for Respondents 33. And because, the\nrespondents say, it is thus possible to align the two halves\nof \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2014even if through multiple administrative\nmaneuvers\u2014immigration officials are under an obligation\nto do so. We disagree, for reasons that should sound fa-\nmiliar: Several are the same as those we have just given\nfor upholding the Board\u2019s interpretation. But still, we\nwalk through the respondents\u2019 argument step-by-step, to\nshow how far it departs from any ordinary understanding\nof \u201cautomatic conversion.\u201d\n   The first (and necessary) premise of that argument does\nnot augur well for the remainder: It is the view that the\n\u201cautomatic conversion\u201d procedure permits a change in the\npetitioner\u2019s identity. According to the respondents, the\naged-out beneficiaries\u2019 parents, upon becoming LPRs, can\nbe subbed in for the original sponsors (i.e., the beneficiar-\nies\u2019 grandparents, aunts, and uncles), and the petitions\nthen converted to the F2B category. But as we have\nshown, the \u201cautomatic conversion\u201d language\u2014as most\nnaturally read and as long used throughout immigration\nlaw\u2014contemplates merely moving a petition into a new\nand valid category, not changing its most essential fea-\nture. See supra, at 15\u201317. That alone defeats the re-\nspondents\u2019 position.\n   And a further problem follows\u2014this one concerning the\ndate of automatic conversion. The respondents need that\ndate to come at a time when the derivative beneficiaries\u2019\nparents (the substitute petitioners) are already living in\nthe United States as LPRs; otherwise, the petitions could\nnot qualify for the F2B box. In an attempt to make that\npossible, the respondents propose that conversion be\nviewed as taking place when \u201cthe derivative beneficiary\u2019s\nvisa . . . application is adjudicated.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n29. But as we have (again) demonstrated, the statute is\n24              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                          Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nbest read as establishing a different date: that \u201con which\nan immigrant visa number became available for the alien\u2019s\nparent\u201d\u2014when, by definition, the parent is not yet an\nLPR. \u00a71153(h)(1); see supra, at 18\u201319. That is the mo-\nment when a derivative ages out, which is the single\nchange conversion reflects. By contrast, the respondents\u2019\nsuggested date has no connection to that metamorphosis;\nthe date of adjudication is merely when an immigration\nofficial later discovers that a child has turned 21. And\nthat date is itself fortuitous, reflecting no more than when\nan immigration officer got around to reviewing a visa\napplication: The possibility of conversion would thus\ndepend on bureaucratic vagaries attending the visa pro-\ncess. So the respondents\u2019 mistaken view of the timing of\nconversion is another off-ramp from their argument.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 Still, the respondents\u2019 view of the timing of conversion is better\n\nthan the dissent\u2019s. As an initial matter, the dissent\u2019s objection to\nassessing conversion as of the date a visa becomes available hinges on\nan imaginary difficulty. That approach, the dissent complains, cannot\nbe right because that date always \u201coccurs before the point at which the\nchild is determined to have aged-out.\u201d Post, at 15. Well, yes. The date\na visa becomes available is, under the statute, the date an alien ages\nout (or not); and that status change of course occurs before an immigra-\ntion official, reviewing a visa application, finds that it has done so. But\nwhat of it? When an official determines that an alien was no longer a\nchild on the date a visa became available, he also assesses whether\nautomatic conversion was available to the alien as of that prior date. In\nother words, here as elsewhere in immigration law, conversion occurs\n(or not) upon the date of the relevant status change\u2014and no other. See\nsupra, at 19. And once that is understood, the supposed difficulties the\ndissent throws up all melt away. At the time of the status change, F2A\npetitions can be converted without further contingencies, decisions, or\ndelays, whereas no other petitions can. But cf. post, at 16, 17, n. 7\n(countering, irrelevantly, that after an F2A petition is automatically\nconverted, additional steps remain in the immigration process). And\nimmigration officials later reviewing visa applications know that fact,\nand can treat the different classes of aged-out beneficiaries accordingly.\n   Further, the dissent compounds its error by suggesting a baseless\nalternative date: \u201cthe moment when USCIS receives proof,\u201d no matter\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                  25\n\n                         Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\n  Yet there is more\u2014because even after substituting a\nnew petitioner and delaying the conversion date in a way\nthe statute does not contemplate, the respondents must\npropose yet further fixes to make \u201cautomatic\u201d conversion\nwork for their sons and daughters. The respondents\u2019 next\nproblem is that even on the conversion date they propose,\nmost of them (and other derivatives\u2019 parents) were not yet\nLPRs, and so could not possibly be sponsors. In the ordi-\nnary course, principal and derivative beneficiaries living\nabroad apply for their visas at the same time and go to the\nconsulate together for back-to-back interviews. See supra,\nat 6. And even if the parent is approved first, that alone\ndoes not make her an LPR; she still must come to this\ncountry, demonstrate her continued eligibility, and pass\nan inspection. See ibid. Thus, the respondents must\nrecommend changes to the visa process to get the timing\nto work\u2014essentially, administrative juggling to hold off\nthe derivative beneficiary\u2019s visa adjudication until his\nparent has become an LPR. In particular, they suggest\nthat the consular official defer the derivative\u2019s interview,\nor that the official nominally \u201creject the application\u201d and\nthen instruct the derivative to \u201creapply after the principal\nbeneficiary immigrates.\u201d Brief for Respondents 30. But\nthe need for that choreography (which, in any event, few if\nany of the respondents conformed to) renders the conver-\nsion process only less \u201cautomatic,\u201d because now it requires\nspecial intervention, purposeful delay, and deviation from\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhow far in the future, that a new petitioner stands ready and willing to\nsponsor an aged-out beneficiary. Post, at 15. Not even the respondents\npropose such a date, and for good reason. It has no grounding in the\nCSPA or in any regulatory practice, and it bears no connection to the\ntiming of the status change (aging out) that triggers conversion (or\neven, as the respondents\u2019 date does, to the later determination of that\nchange). The only thing appearing to support the dissent\u2019s date is a\nsingle-minded resolve, statutory text and administrative practice\nnotwithstanding, to grant relief to every possible aged-out beneficiary.\n26              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                          Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nstandard administrative practice. Conversion has become\nnot a machine that would go of itself, but a process pains-\ntakingly managed.\n   And after all this fancy footwork, the respondents\u2019\nscheme still cannot succeed, because however long a visa\nadjudication is postponed, a derivative\u2019s parent may never\nbecome able to sponsor a relative\u2019s visa\u2014and immigration\nofficials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has\ndone so. We have noted before the potential impediments\nto serving as a petitioner\u2014including that a parent may\nnot immigrate, may not qualify as a sponsor, or may not\nbe able to provide the requisite financial support. See\nsupra, at 17\u201318. The respondents offer no way to deal\nwith those many contingencies. Require the parent to\nsubmit a new petition? But the entire point of automatic\nconversion (as the respondents themselves agree) is to\nobviate the need for such a document. See Brief for Re-\nspondents 30, 42. Investigate the parent\u2019s eligibility in\nsome other way? But even were that possible (which we\ndoubt) such an inquiry would not square with the essen-\ntial idea of an automatic process. Disregard the possibility\nthat no legal sponsor exists? But then visas would go,\ninevitably and not infrequently, to ineligible aliens. And\nso the workarounds have well and truly run out on the\nrespondents\u2019 argument.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Nor does the dissent offer any serious aid to the respondents. The\n\ndissent initially acknowledges that automatic conversion cannot involve\n\u201cadditional decisions, contingencies, or delays.\u201d Post, at 13. But no\nworries, the dissent continues: \u201c[O]nce [an alien\u2019s parent] provides\nconfirmation of her eligibility to sponsor\u201d the aged-out alien, the origi-\nnal petition \u201ccan automatically be converted to an F2B petition, with no\nadditional decision or contingency\u201d or (presumably) delay. Post, at 14.\nThink about that: Once every decision, contingency, and delay we have\njust described is over (and a parent has at long last turned out to be a\nviable sponsor), the dissent assures us that no further decisions,\ncontingencies, and delays remain. Or, put differently, there are no\ncontingencies after all the contingencies have been resolved; no deci-\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Having followed each step of the\nrespondents\u2019 resourceful (if Rube Goldbergish) argument,\nwe still see no way to apply the concept of automatic con-\nversion to the respondents\u2019 children and others like them.\nAnd that means we continue to face a statute whose\nhalves do not correspond to each other\u2014giving rise to an\nambiguity that calls for Chevron deference.\n                               B\n   The respondents, however, have another idea for recon-\nciling \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s front and back parts (and this back-up\nclaim becomes the dissent\u2019s principal argument). Recall\nthat the section\u2019s remedial clause instructs that \u201cthe\nalien\u2019s petition shall automatically be converted to the\nappropriate category and the alien shall retain the original\npriority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.\u201d\nThe respondents (and the dissent) ask us to read the\nitalicized language as conferring a benefit wholly inde-\npendent of automatic conversion. On that view, aged-out\nderivatives, even though ineligible for conversion, could\n\u201cretain the[ir] original priority date[s]\u201d if their parents file\na new petition (as the respondents in fact did here \u201cas a\nprotective matter,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 55). And then, every-\none encompassed in \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s first clause would get at\nleast some form of relief (even if not both forms) from the\nsection\u2019s second. For this argument, the respondents\nprincipally rely on the word \u201cand\u201d: \u201cWhere the word \u2018and\u2019\nconnects two\u201d phrases as in \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s back half, the\nrespondents contend, those terms \u201coperate independently.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsions after all the decisions have been made; and no delay after all the\ndelay has transpired. And as if that argument were not awkward\nenough, consider that it would make automatic conversion turn on the\nfiling of a new document that shows the parent\u2019s eligibility to sponsor\nher aged-out son or daughter\u2014the very thing, as all parties agree, that\nconversion is supposed to render unnecessary. See supra, at 18, 26.\n28               SCIALABBA v.

In some\nsentences, no doubt, the respondents have a point. They\nuse as their primary example: \u201c[I]f the boat takes on wa-\nter, then you shall operate the bilge pump and you shall\ndistribute life jackets.\u201d Brief for Respondents 39; see also\npost, at 10 (offering further examples). We agree that \u201cyou\nshall distribute life jackets\u201d functions in that sentence as\nan independent command. But we can come up with\nmany paired dictates in which the second is conditional on\nthe first. \u201cIf the price is reasonable, buy two tickets and\nsave a receipt.\u201d \u201cIf you have time this summer, read this\nbook and give me a report.\u201d Or, shades of this case: \u201cIf\nyour cell-phone contract expires, buy a new phone and\nkeep the old number.\u201d15 In each case, the second com-\nmand functions only once the first is accomplished.\nWhether \u201cand\u201d works in that way or in the respondents\u2019\ndepends, like many questions of usage, on the context.\nSee, e.g., Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 The  dissent appears to think that something helpful to its view\nfollows from repeating the word \u201cshall\u201d and changing the subject of the\ncommands. See post, at 9\u201310. But that is not so, as some further\nexamples show. \u201cIf you advance to the next round, my assistant shall\nschedule an interview and you shall come in to answer questions.\u201d \u201cIf\nthe plane is low on fuel, the tanks shall be refilled and the pilot shall fly\nthe route as scheduled.\u201d In these sentences, as in our prior ones, the\nsecond command is conditional on the first; all that differs is that these\nsentences are (much like statutes) more formal and stilted. And the\ndissent\u2019s citation of United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489\nU. S. 235 (1989), adds nothing to its argument. There, we construed\nthe following provision: \u201c[T]here shall be allowed to the holder of [a\nsecured] claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs,\nor charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim\narose.\u201d Id., at 241. We held that the phrase \u201cprovided for under the\nagreement\u201d qualifies the words \u201cany reasonable fees, costs, or charges,\u201d\nbut not the words \u201cinterest on such claim.\u201d Id., at 241\u2013242. What\nrelevance that interpretation bears to this case eludes us.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          29\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012).\n   Here, we think, context compels the Board\u2019s view that\nthe instructions work in tandem. The first phrase in-\nstructs immigration officials to convert a petition (when an\n\u201cappropriate category\u201d exists); the next clarifies that such\na converted petition will retain the original priority date,\nrather than receive a new one corresponding to the date of\nconversion. That reading comports with the way retention\nfigures in other statutory and regulatory provisions re-\nspecting \u201cconversions\u201d; there too, retention of a priority\ndate is conditional on a conversion occurring. See 8\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71154(k)(1)\u2013(3); 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i); supra, at 16.\nThe respondents wish to unhook the \u201cretention\u201d phrase\nfrom that mooring, and use it to explain what will attend a\ndifferent event\u2014that is, the filing of a new petition. But\nthat is to make \u201cretention\u201d conditional on something the\nstatute nowhere mentions\u2014a highly improbable thing for\nCongress to have done. (If, once again, a teacher says to\n\u201cread this book and give me a report,\u201d no one would think\nhe wants a report on some unidentified subject.) And\nindeed, the respondents\u2019 and dissent\u2019s own examples prove\nthis point: In not a single one of their proffered sentences\nis the second command contingent on the occurrence of\nsome additional, unstated event, as it would have to be\nunder the respondents\u2019 construction of \u00a71153(h)(3); rather,\neach such command (e.g., \u201cdistribute life jackets\u201d) flows\ndirectly from the stated condition (e.g., \u201cif the boat takes\non water\u201d). So by far the more natural understanding of\n\u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s text is that retention follows conversion, and\nnothing else.\n   The respondents\u2019 contrary view would also engender\nunusual results, introducing uncertainty into the immi-\ngration system\u2019s operation and thus interfering with\nstatutory goals. Were their theory correct, an aged-out\nalien could hold on to a priority date for years or even\ndecades while waiting for a relative to file a new petition.\n30              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                          Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nEven if that filing happened, say, 20 years after the alien\naged out, the alien could take out his priority-date token,\nand assert a right to spring to the front of any visa line.\nAt that point, USCIS could well have a hard time confirm-\ning the old priority date, in part because the names of\nderivative beneficiaries need not be listed on a visa peti-\ntion. And the possibility of such leap-frogging from many\nyears past would impede USCIS\u2019s publication of accurate\nwaiting times. As far as we know, immigration law no-\nwhere else allows an alien to keep in his pocket a priority\ndate untethered to any existing valid petition. Without\nsome clearer statement, we cannot conclude Congress\nintended here to create such a free-floating, open-ended\nentitlement to a defunct petition\u2019s priority date. See\nWang, 25 I. & N. Dec., at 36.16\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 The dissent claims that USCIS \u201cadministered priority date reten-\n\ntion in exactly this manner\u201d before the CSPA\u2019s enactment, post, at 10,\nbut that confident assertion is just not so\u2014or at least not in any way\nthat assists the respondents. The dissent principally relies on 8 CFR\n\u00a7204.2(a)(4), which prior to the CSPA\u2019s enactment permitted an aged-\nout F2A derivative beneficiary to retain his old priority date \u201cif [a]\nsubsequent petition is filed by the same petitioner\u201d as filed the original.\nFar from authorizing an open-ended, free-floating entitlement, that\nnow-superseded regulation allowed an alien to keep his priority date\nonly if he (unlike the respondents\u2019 offspring) had a qualifying relation-\nship with the initial petitioner\u2014that is, only if he fell within the group\nthat the BIA in Wang thought entitled to relief. See 25 I. & N. Dec., at\n34\u201335. And the other provisions the dissent cites (which, unlike\n\u00a7204.2(a)(4), continue to operate) similarly fail to support the dissent\u2019s\nposition, because they enable an alien to retain a priority date only if\nattached to an existing valid petition. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71154(k)(3) (per-\nmitting an alien to retain a priority date associated with an ex-\nisting F2B petition); 8 CFR \u00a7204.5(e) (permitting an alien to retain a\npriority date associated with an existing employment-based peti-\ntion); \u00a7204.12(f)(1) (permitting an alien to retain a priority date\nassociated with an existing employment-based petition for immigrating\nphysicians).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

In their view, the Board has offered\nno valid reason, consistent with \u201cthe purposes and con-\ncerns of the immigration laws,\u201d to treat their own sons and\ndaughters less favorably than aliens who were principal\nand derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions. Brief for\nRespondents 47. Indeed, the respondents suggest that the\nBIA, \u201cfor its own unfathomable reasons, disapproves of\nCongress\u2019s decision to allow any aged-out\u201d aliens to get\nrelief, and has thus \u201climited [\u00a71153(h)(3)] to as few deriva-\ntive beneficiaries as possible.\u201d Id., at 55.\n   We cannot agree. At the least, the Board\u2019s interpreta-\ntion has administrative simplicity to recommend it. Un-\nder that view, immigration authorities need only perform\nthe kind of straightforward (i.e., \u201cautomatic\u201d) conversion\nthey have done for decades\u2014moving a petition from one\nbox to another to reflect a given status change like aging\nout. See Wang, 25 I. & N. Dec., at 36. The respondents,\nas we have shown, would transform conversion into a\nmanaged, multi-stage process, requiring immigration and\nconsular officials around the world to sequence and delay\nevery aged-out alien\u2019s visa adjudication until they are able\nto confirm that one of his parents had become a qualifying\nand willing F2B petitioner. And according to the Govern-\nment\u2019s (incomplete) statistics, that would have to happen\nin, at a minimum, tens of thousands of cases every year.\nSee Reply Brief 18, n. 13.\n   Still more important, the Board offered a cogent argu-\nment, reflecting statutory purposes, for distinguishing\nbetween aged-out beneficiaries of F2A petitions and the\nrespondents\u2019 sons and daughters. See Wang, 35 I. & N.\nDec., at 38. As earlier explained, the F2A beneficiaries\n32           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nhave all had a qualifying relationship with an LPR for the\nentire period they have waited in line\u2014i.e., since their\noriginal priority dates. See supra, at 19\u201320. That means\nthat when immigration authorities convert their petitions,\nthey will enter the F2B line at the same place as others\nwho have had a comparable relationship for an equal time.\nThe conversion thus fits with the immigration law\u2019s basic\nfirst-come-first-served rule. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(e); supra,\nat 4. By contrast, the derivative beneficiaries of F3 and F4\npetitions, like the respondents\u2019 sons and daughters, lacked\nany qualifying relationship with a citizen or LPR during\nthe period they waited in line. See supra, at 20\u201321. They\nwere, instead, the grandchildren, nieces, or nephews of\ncitizens, and those relationships did not independently\nentitle them to visas. If such aliens received relief under\n\u00a71153(h)(3), they would jump over thousands of others in\nthe F2B line who had a qualifying relationship with an\nLPR for a far longer time. That displacement would, the\nBoard reasonably found, scramble the priority order Con-\ngress prescribed.\n   The argument to the contrary assumes that the re-\nspondents\u2019 sons and daughters should \u201creceive credit\u201d for\nall the time the respondents themselves stood in line.\nBrief for Respondents 50. But first, the time the respond-\nents spent waiting for a visa may diverge substantially\nfrom the time their children did. Suppose, for example,\nthat one of the respondents had stood in the F4 queue for\n15 years, and with just 4 years to go, married someone\nwith a 17-year-old son. Under the respondents\u2019 reading,\nthat derivative beneficiary, after aging out, would get the\nfull benefit of his new parent\u2019s wait, and so displace many\nthousands of aliens who (unlike him) had stood in an\nimmigration queue for nearly two decades. And second,\neven when the derivative qualified as such for all the time\nhis parent stood in line, his status throughout that period\nhinged on his being that parent\u2019s minor child. If his par-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          33\n\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\n\nent had obtained a visa before he aged out, he would have\nbeen eligible for a visa too, because the law does not de-\nmand that a prospective immigrant abandon a minor\nchild. But if the parent had died while waiting for a visa,\nor had been found ineligible, or had decided not to immi-\ngrate after all, the derivative would have gotten nothing\nfor the time spent in line. See supra, at 5\u20136. Similarly,\nthe Board could reasonably conclude, he should not receive\ncredit for his parent\u2019s wait when he has become old\nenough to live independently. In the unavoidably zero-\nsum world of allocating a limited number of visas, the\nBoard could decide that he belongs behind any alien who\nhas had a lengthier stand-alone entitlement to immigrate.\n                            IV\n   This is the kind of case Chevron was built for. What-\never Congress might have meant in enacting \u00a71153(h)(3),\nit failed to speak clearly.     Confronted with a self-\ncontradictory, ambiguous provision in a complex statutory\nscheme, the Board chose a textually reasonable construc-\ntion consonant with its view of the purposes and policies\nunderlying immigration law. Were we to overturn the\nBoard in that circumstance, we would assume as our own\nthe responsible and expert agency\u2019s role. We decline that\npath, and defer to the Board.\n   We therefore reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit\nand remand the case for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

S. C. \u00a71153(h)(3). I write separately\nbecause I take a different view of what makes this provi-\nsion \u201cambiguous\u201d under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984).\n   As the plurality reads section 1153(h)(3), the statute\u2019s\ntwo clauses address the issue before the Court \u201cin diver-\ngent ways\u201d and \u201cdo not easily cohere with each other.\u201d\nAnte, at 14. For the plurality, the first clause looks \u201cto-\nward the sweeping relief the respondents propose, which\nwould reach every aged-out beneficiary of a family prefer-\nence petition,\u201d while the second clause offers narrower\nrelief that can help \u201conly a subset of those beneficiaries.\u201d\nIbid. Such \u201cill-fitting clauses,\u201d the plurality says, \u201cleft the\nBoard with a choice\u2014essentially of how to reconcile the\nstatute\u2019s different commands.\u201d Ante, at 21.\n   To the extent the plurality\u2019s opinion could be read to\nsuggest that deference is warranted because of a direct\nconflict between these clauses, that is wrong. Courts defer\nto an agency\u2019s reasonable construction of an ambiguous\n2              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\n\nstatute because we presume that Congress intended to\nassign responsibility to resolve the ambiguity to the agency.\nChevron, supra, at 843\u2013844. But when Congress assigns\nto an agency the responsibility for deciding whether a\nparticular group should get relief, it does not do so by\nsimultaneously saying that the group should and that it\nshould not. Direct conflict is not ambiguity, and the reso-\nlution of such a conflict is not statutory construction but\nlegislative choice. Chevron is not a license for an agency\nto repair a statute that does not make sense.1\n  I see no conflict, or even \u201cinternal tension,\u201d ante, at 14,\nin section 1153(h)(3). See FDA v. Brown & Williamson\nTobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000) (we must \u201cinter-\npret the statute \u2018as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory\nscheme,\u2019 and \u2018fit, if possible, all parts into a[ ] harmonious\nwhole\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).\n  The statute reads:\n       \u201cIf the age of an alien is determined under [section\n     1153(h)(1)] to be 21 years of age or older for the pur-\n     poses of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d) of this section,\n     the alien\u2019s petition shall automatically be converted to\n     the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the\n     original priority date issued upon receipt of the origi-\n     nal petition.\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3).\n  The first clause states a condition\u2014one that beneficiar-\nies from any preference category can meet\u2014and thereby\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 National Assn. of Home Builders v.

J., concurring in judgment\n\ndefines the persons potentially affected by this provision.\nBut the clause does not grant anything to anyone. I disa-\ngree with the plurality that the first clause \u201cpoints toward\nbroad-based relief,\u201d ante, at 21, because I do not think the\nfirst clause points toward any relief at all.2\n   Imagine a provision of the Tax Code that read: \u201cIf a\nstudent is determined to be enrolled at an accredited\nuniversity, the student\u2019s cost of off-campus housing shall\nbe deductible on her tax return.\u201d It would be immediately\napparent from that provision that an enrolled student who\nlives on campus is not entitled to the deduction, even\nthough the student falls within the conditional first\nclause. And yet no one would describe the two clauses as\nbeing in tension. If the Internal Revenue Service then\ninterpreted the term \u201ccost of off-campus housing\u201d to ex-\nclude payments by a student who rents a home from his\nparents, a court would determine whether that interpreta-\ntion was reasonable. The same is true in this case.3\n   The particular benefit provided by section 1153(h)(3) is\nfound exclusively in the second clause\u2014the only operative\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 For  the same reason, I do not agree with the contention in JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent that the first clause of section 1153(h)(3) unam-\nbiguously \u201canswers the precise question in this case.\u201d Post, at 6.\n   3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent accuses me of \u201cignor[ing]\u201d the first\n\nclause of section 1153(h)(3), \u201ctreating [that] clause as a nullity,\u201d and\ndenying the clause \u201ceffect.\u201d Post, at 20\u201321. But that point is correct\nonly if the reader adopts JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s own premise, that the\nfirst clause has operative effect on its own. I give the statute\u2019s first\nclause precisely the (limited) effect it is meant to have: it defines who is\npotentially affected by section 1153(h)(3). JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s re-\nsponse to the campus housing example proves my point by acknowledg-\ning that who gets relief under a statute depends entirely on the mean-\ning of the statute\u2019s operative provision, not on the reach of the\nintroductory clause. See post, at 21. The Court would not reject a\nreasonable interpretation of the term \u201ccost of off-campus housing,\u201d as\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent would, simply because the IRS could have\ninterpreted the term to cover more students who fall within the prefa-\ntory clause.\n4               SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\n\nprovision. There we are told what an aged-out beneficiary\n(from whatever preference category) is entitled to: His\npetition \u201cshall automatically be converted to the appropri-\nate category and the alien shall retain the original priority\ndate.\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3). But automatic conversion is not possi-\nble for every beneficiary in every preference category, as\nthe plurality convincingly demonstrates. Ante, at 15\u201319.\nAutomatic conversion requires, at minimum, that the\nbeneficiary have his own sponsor, who demonstrates that\nhe is eligible to act as a sponsor, and who commits to\nproviding financial support for the beneficiary. Ante, at\n18. Some aged-out children will not meet those prerequi-\nsites, and they cannot benefit from automatic conversion\neven under respondents\u2019 interpretation of the statute.4\n   Beyond those requirements, however, Congress did not\nspeak clearly to which petitions can \u201cautomatically be\nconverted.\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3). Whatever other interpretations\nof that provision might be possible, it was reasonable, for\nthe reasons explained by the plurality, for the Board to\ninterpret section 1153(h)(3) to provide relief only to a child\nwho was a principal or derivative beneficiary of an F2A\npetition. That interpretation is consistent with the ordi-\nnary meaning of the statutory terms, with the established\nmeaning of automatic conversion in immigration law, and\nwith the structure of the family-based immigration sys-\ntem. Ante, at 15\u201320. It also avoids the problems that\nwould flow from respondents\u2019 proposed alternative inter-\npretations, including the suggestion that retention of the\noriginal priority date provides a benefit wholly separate\nfrom automatic conversion. Ante, at 18\u201319, 22\u201332.\n   I concur in the judgment.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 JUSTICE\n            SOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent is wrong that \u201cthe relief promised in\n\u00a71153(h)(3) (priority date retention and automatic conversion) can be\ngiven\u201d to every aged-out child in every preference category, post, at 21,\nand it therefore follows that the statute is ambiguous.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

If there is, the\nagency was obligated by the clear text of 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71153(h)(3) to convert the petitions and leave the children\nwith their original priority dates. Any such conversion\nwould be \u201cautomatic,\u201d because the agency\u2019s obligation to\nconvert the petitions follows inexorably, and without need\nfor any additional action on the part of either respondents\nor their children, from the fact that the children\u2019s ages\n2               SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nhave been calculated to be 21 or older.1 If there is not an\nappropriate category, then the agency was not required to\nconvert the petitions.\n   By the time respondents became legal permanent resi-\ndents and filed new petitions for their children (if not\nsooner), there existed an appropriate category to which the\noriginal petitions could be converted. That is because at\nthat point the children all qualified for F2B preference\nstatus, as unmarried, adult children of legal permanent\nresidents. Accordingly, the agency should have converted\nrespondents\u2019 children\u2019s petitions and allowed them to\nretain their original priority dates.2\n   Section 1153(h)(3) is brief and cryptic. It may well\ncontain a great deal of ambiguity, which the Board of\nImmigration Appeals in its expertise is free to resolve, so\nlong as its resolution is a \u201cpermissible construction of the\nstatute.\u201d Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources De-\nfense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). But the\nstatute is clear on at least one point: \u201cIf the age of an alien\nis determined under [\u00a71153(h)(1)] to be 21 years of age or\nolder . . . , the alien\u2019s petition shall automatically be con-\nverted to the appropriate category and the alien shall\nretain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the\noriginal petition\u201d (emphasis added). The Board was not\nfree to disregard this clear statutory command.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1Ido not believe the term \u201cconverted\u201d demands the interpretation\nthe plurality gives it, for the reasons advanced in JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s\ndissenting opinion.\n  2 The Government does not argue that respondents\u2019 children were\n\nineligible for relief because, as a factual matter, their ages were never\n\u201cdetermined . . . to be 21 years of age or older,\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3), after an\nappropriate category became available.

The initial clause of 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71153(h)(3) provides a clear answer: Aged-out\nchildren may retain their priority dates so long as they\nmeet a single condition\u2014they must be \u201cdetermined . . . to\nbe 21 years of age or older for purposes of\u201d derivative\nbeneficiary status. Because all five categories of aged-out\nchildren satisfy this condition, all are entitled to relief.\n   Notwithstanding this textual command, the Board of\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) ruled that four of the five\ncategories of aged-out children to whom \u00a71153(h)(3) un-\nambiguously promises priority date retention, are, in fact,\nentitled to no relief at all. See Matter of Wang, 25 I. & N.\nDec. 28, 38\u201339 (2009). The Court defers to that interpre-\ntation today. In doing so, the Court does not identify any\n2            SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nambiguity in the dispositive initial clause of \u00a71153(h)(3).\nIndeed, it candidly admits that the clause mandates relief\nfor \u201cevery aged-out beneficiary of a family-preference\npetition\u201d in any of the five categories. Ante, at 21. The\nCourt nevertheless holds that the BIA was free to ignore\nthis unambiguous text on the ground that \u00a71153(h)(3) also\noffers aged-out derivative beneficiaries a type of relief\u2014\nautomatic conversion\u2014that it thinks can apply only to one\nof the five categories. The Court thus perceives a conflict\nin the statute that, in its view, permits the BIA to override\n\u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s initial eligibility clause.\n  In reaching this conclusion, the Court fails to follow a\ncardinal rule of statutory interpretation: When deciding\nwhether Congress has \u201cspecifically addressed the question\nat issue,\u201d thereby leaving no room for an agency to fill a\nstatutory gap, courts must \u201cinterpret the statute \u2018as a . . .\ncoherent regulatory scheme\u2019 and \u2018fit, if possible, all parts\ninto [a] harmonious whole.\u2019 \u201d FDA v. Brown & Williamson\nTobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132\u2013133 (2000) (citation\nomitted). Because the Court and the BIA ignore obvious\nways in which \u00a71153(h)(3) can operate as a coherent whole\nand instead construe the statute as a self-contradiction\nthat was broken from the moment Congress wrote it, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n                              I\n   Under Chevron, the first question we ask when review-\ning an agency\u2019s construction of a statute is whether \u201cCon-\ngress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d\nChevron U.

Congress has de-\nfined five categories of eligible relatives\u2014referred to as\nfamily-preference categories\u2014with annual limits on the\nnumber of visas that may be issued within each category.1\nBecause the demand for visas outstrips supply, the wait\nfor a visa can often last many years. While a principal\nbeneficiary waits, her place in line is determined based on\nher \u201cpriority date,\u201d the date on which her petition was\nfiled. See \u00a71153(e)(1); 8 CFR \u00a7204.1(b) (2014); 22 CFR\n\u00a742.53(a) (2013). Priority dates are therefore crucial\u2014the\nearlier one\u2019s priority date, the sooner one\u2019s place will come\nup in line and a visa will be available. Significantly, when\nthe wait ends and a principal beneficiary finally becomes\neligible to apply for a visa, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(d) enables the\nbeneficiary\u2019s spouse and minor children (known as \u201cderiv-\native beneficiaries\u201d) to do so too.\n   This case arises from a common problem: Given the\nlengthy period prospective immigrants must wait for a\nvisa, a principal beneficiary\u2019s child\u2014although younger\nthan 21 when her parent\u2019s petition was initially filed\u2014\noften will have turned 21 by the time the parent\u2019s priority\ndate comes up in line. Such a child is said to have \u201caged\nout\u201d of derivative beneficiary treatment under \u00a71153(d).\nBy way of example, respondent Norma Uy was the princi-\npal beneficiary of an F4 family-preference petition filed by\nher U. S. citizen sister in February 1981. That petition\nlisted Norma\u2019s daughter, Ruth, who was then two years\nold, as a derivative beneficiary. If Norma had reached the\nfront of the visa line at any time before Ruth\u2019s 21st birth-\nday, \u00a71153(d) would have enabled Ruth to accompany\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The five categories are F1 (unmarried adult children of U. S. citi-\n\nzens); F2A (spouses and unmarried minor children of LPRs); F2B\n(unmarried adult children of LPRs); F3 (married children of U. S.\ncitizens); and F4 (brothers and sisters of U. S. citizens). 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71153(a)(1)\u2013(4).\n4               SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nNorma to the United States. Unfortunately, it took more\nthan two decades for Norma\u2019s priority date to become\ncurrent, by which point Ruth was 23 and thus too old for\nderivative beneficiary status under \u00a71153(d). Norma\ntherefore immigrated alone to the United States, where\nshe filed a new F2B petition (for unmarried children of\nLPRs) on Ruth\u2019s behalf. Before \u00a71153(h)(3) was enacted,\nhowever, an immigrant in Ruth\u2019s position would have been\nunable to retain the February 1981 priority date from her\noriginal petition; the law would have instead required her\nto receive a new priority date all the way at the back of the\nF2B line.\n  Congress responded to this problem by enacting\n\u00a71153(h)(3), a provision entitled \u201c[r]etention of priority\ndate.\u201d It states:\n         \u201cIf the age of an alien is determined under [the for-\n       mula specified in] paragraph (1)[2] to be 21 years of\n       age or older for the purpos[e] of . . . [\u00a71153(d)] of this\n       section, the alien\u2019s petition shall automatically be\n       converted to the appropriate category and the alien\n       shall retain the original priority date issued upon re-\n       ceipt of the original petition.\u201d\n   The provision\u2019s structure is crucial to its meaning. The\ninitial clause (call it the \u201celigibility clause\u201d) specifies who\nis eligible for relief. The concluding clause (call it the\n\u201crelief clause\u201d) describes the two forms of relief to which\neligible persons are entitled. As the title of the provision\nsuggests, the main form of relief is the right of an aged-out\nderivative beneficiary to retain the priority date of her\noriginal petition. In Ruth Uy\u2019s case, such relief would\nmean the difference between resuming her wait near the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 As\n      the plurality explains, ante, at 9\u201310, the formula specified in\nparagraph (1) subtracts out bureaucratic delays resulting from the\nGovernment\u2019s review of the relevant immigration paperwork. That\nformula is not at issue in this case.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Brief for Respondents 52.\n   The question in this case is which aged-out beneficiaries\nof family-preference petitions are eligible for priority date\nretention: the aged-out beneficiaries of petitions in all five\nfamily-preference categories (which would include re-\nspondents\u2019 children, who were derivative beneficiaries of\nF3 and F4 petitions for adult children and adult siblings of\nU. S. citizens, respectively), or the aged-out beneficiaries\nof only F2A petitions for spouses and children of LPRs (the\ninterpretation offered by the BIA)?\n   Congress answered that question in \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s eligi-\nbility clause, which specifies that relief is to be conferred\non any immigrant who has been \u201cdetermined under [the\nformula specified in] paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or\nolder\u201d for the purpose of \u00a71153(d). As the plurality con-\ncedes, this clause \u201cstates a condition that every aged-out\nbeneficiary of a preference petition satisfies\u201d\u2014that is, it\nmakes eligible for relief aged-out children within each of\nthe F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and F4 categories. Ante, at 14.\n   Congress made this clear in two mutually reinforc-\ning ways. First, by referring to the formula set forth in\n\u201cparagraph (1),\u201d the statute incorporates that paragraph\u2019s\ncross-reference to \u00a71153(h)(2). Section 1153(h)(2) in turn\ndefines the set of covered petitions to include, \u201cwith re-\nspect to an alien child who is a derivative beneficiary\nunder [\u00a71153(d)], a petition filed . . . for classification\nof the alien\u2019s parent under [\u00a71153(a)].\u201d And \u00a71153(a)\nencompasses all five family-preference categories. See\n\u00a7\u00a71153(a)(1)\u2013(4). Second, \u00a71153(h)(3) promises relief to\nthose who are found to be 21 \u201cfor the purpos[e] of . . .\n[\u00a71153](d),\u201d the provision governing derivative beneficiar-\nies. And that provision also unambiguously covers all five\nfamily-preference categories. See \u00a71153(d) (a minor child\n6              SCIALABBA v.

See ante, at 14, 21. Thus, unlike in the usual\nChevron case, where ambiguity derives from the fact that\nthe text does not speak with sufficient specificity to the\nquestion at issue, the plurality argues that this is a case in\nwhich ambiguity can only arise\u2014if it is to arise at all\u2014if\nCongress has spoken clearly on the issue in diametrically\nopposing ways.3 As the plurality frames it, \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 To\n       understand the kind of conflict that can make deference appro-\npriate to an agency\u2019s decision to override unambiguous statutory text,\nconsider the provisions at issue in National Assn. of Home Builders v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 551 U.

See A. Scalia & B.\nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n180 (2012) (\u201cThe provisions of a text should be interpreted\nin a way that renders them compatible, not contradic-\ntory. . . . [T]here can be no justification for needlessly ren-\ndering provisions in conflict if they can be interpreted\nharmoniously\u201d). That is especially true where, as here,\nthe conflict that Congress supposedly created is not be-\ntween two different statutes or even two separate provi-\nsions within a single statute, but between two clauses in\nthe same sentence. See ibid. (\u201c[I]t is invariably true that\nintelligent drafters do not contradict themselves\u201d).

Each of these cautions springs\nfrom a common well: As judicious as it can be to defer to\nadministrative agencies, our foremost duty is, and always\nhas been, to give effect to the law as drafted by Congress.\n   The plurality contends that deference is appropriate\nhere because, in its view, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s two\nclauses are \u201cself-contradictory.\u201d Ante, at 33. But far from\nit being unworkable (or even difficult) for the agency to\nobey both clauses, traditional tools of statutory construc-\ntion reveal that \u00a71153(h)\u2019s clauses are entirely compatible.\n                               B\n   The plurality argues that although \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s eligibil-\nity clause clearly encompasses aged-out beneficiaries\nwithin all five preference categories, the relief clause\nimplies a conflicting \u201climitation on the eligible class of\nrecipients.\u201d Ante, at 15. The plurality infers that limita-\ntion from two premises. First, it contends that no aged-\nout child may retain her priority date unless her petition\nis also eligible for automatic conversion. And second, it\nasserts that only aged-out F2A beneficiaries may receive\nautomatic conversion. As a result, the plurality concludes,\nit was reasonable for the BIA to exclude aged-out children\nin the four other categories from receiving both automatic\nconversion and priority date retention, thereby rendering\n\u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s eligibility clause defunct.\n   The plurality\u2019s conclusion is wrong because its premises\nare wrong. For one, \u00a71153(h)(3) is naturally read to confer\npriority date retention as an independent form of relief to\nall aged-out children, regardless of whether automatic\nconversion is separately available. And even if that were\nwrong, the plurality\u2019s supposition that only F2A benefi-\nciaries can receive automatic conversion is incorrect on its\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Because either of these interpretations would\ntreat \u00a71153(h)(3) as a coherent whole, the BIA\u2019s construc-\ntion was impermissible.\n                              1\n   The most obvious flaw in the plurality\u2019s analysis is its\npresumption that \u00a71153(h)(3) permits an aged-out child to\nretain her original priority date only if her petition can\nbe automatically converted. That is incorrect for many\nreasons.\n   When an immigrant is determined to have aged out of\nderivative beneficiary status, \u00a71153(h)(3) prescribes two\nforms of relief: \u201c[T]he alien\u2019s petition shall automatically\nbe converted to the appropriate category and the alien\nshall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt\nof the original petition.\u201d We have held that when a statute\nprovides two forms of relief in this manner, joined by the\nconjunction \u201cand,\u201d the two remedies are \u201cdistinct.\u201d United\nStates v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241\u2013\n242 (1989).

S. 26, 35\n(1998) (\u201c[T]he mandatory [term] \u2018shall\u2019 . . . normally cre-\nates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion\u201d).\nMoreover, the two \u201cshall\u201d commands operate on different\nsubjects, further reinforcing that they prescribe distinct\nremedies: An aged-out \u201calien\u2019s petition shall automatically\nbe converted,\u201d but it is \u201cthe alien\u201d herself who, in all\nevents, \u201cshall retain\u201d her original priority date.\n\u00a71153(h)(3) (emphasis added).\n   The plurality responds with a series of examples in\nwhich the word \u201cand\u201d is used to join two commands, one of\nwhich is\u2014as the plurality asserts here\u2014dependent on\nanother. Ante, at 28, and n. 15. But as the plurality\nrecognizes, ante, at 28, that is hardly the only way the\n10           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nword can be used. For example: \u201cIf today\u2019s baseball game\nis rained out, your ticket shall automatically be converted\nto a ticket for next Saturday\u2019s game, and you shall retain\nyour free souvenir from today\u2019s game.\u201d Or: \u201cIf you provide\nthe DMV with proof of your new address, your voter regis-\ntration shall automatically be converted to the correct\npolling location, and you shall receive in the mail an up-\ndated driver\u2019s license.\u201d It is plain in both of these exam-\nples that the two commands are distinct\u2014the fan in the\nfirst example can keep her free souvenir even if she cannot\nattend next Saturday\u2019s game; the new resident will receive\nan updated driver\u2019s license even if she is ineligible to vote.\nWhat the plurality does not explain is why we should forgo\nthe same understanding of \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s relief clause when\nthat would treat the statute as a coherent whole (and\nwhen the plurality\u2019s alternative interpretation would\nrender the statute a walking self-contradiction within the\nspan of a few words).\n   With the text unavailing, the plurality turns to a policy\nargument. The plurality worries that if automatic conver-\nsion and priority date retention are independent benefits,\naged-out beneficiaries will be able to \u201chold on to a priority\ndate for years . . . while waiting for a relative to file a new\npetition,\u201d which might hamper U. S. Citizenship and\nImmigration Services (USCIS) operations. Ante, at 29\u201330.\nBut the plurality\u2019s fears of administrative inconvenience\nare belied by the fact that USCIS has administered prior-\nity date retention in exactly this manner for years, with no\napparent problems. Well before \u00a71153(h)(3) was enacted,\na regulation provided aged-out F2A derivative beneficiar-\nies the ability to retain their priority dates without also\nproviding automatic conversion. See 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(a)(4)\n(permitting priority date retention after a \u201cseparate peti-\ntion\u201d is filed); 57 Fed. Reg. 41053, 41059 (1992) (adopting\nthis provision). Indeed, the USCIS continues to instruct\nfield officers that a \u201cseparate petition\u201d must be filed in\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

The notion that it is somehow impossible for an\nimmigrant to retain her priority date contingent upon the\nfiling of a separate petition is therefore contradicted by\nyears of agency experience.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The plurality does not dispute that USCIS has administered priority\ndate retention as a form of relief independent from automatic conver-\nsion for years. Ante, at 30, n. 16. It nonetheless argues that the same\napproach is impermissible here for the counterintuitive reason that a\npre-existing regulation used express language limiting priority date\nretention to derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions alone. See ante, at\n30, n. 16 (noting that 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(a)(4) permitted an aged-out benefi-\nciary to retain her priority date \u201c \u2018if the subsequent petition is filed by\nthe same petitioner\u2019 \u201d). Congress included no such language to limit the\nscope of priority date retention in 8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(h)(3), however,\nwhich just reinforces what the eligibility clause already makes clear:\nPriority date retention is independently available for aged-out de-\nrivative beneficiaries of all family-preference petitions, not just F2A\npetitions.\n   The plurality also fails to account for the numerous other contexts in\nwhich USCIS has administered priority date retention as a benefit\ndistinct from automatic conversion. See, e.g., \u00a71154(k)(3) (providing\npriority date retention to unmarried adult children of LPRs whose\nparents become naturalized citizens \u201c[r]egardless of whether a petition\nis converted\u201d); 8 CFR \u00a7204.5(e) (\u201cA petition approved on behalf of an\nalien under [the employment-based immigration provisions of \u00a71153(b)]\naccords the alien the priority date of the approved petition for any\nsubsequently filed [employment] petition\u201d); \u00a7204.12(f)(1) (a \u201cphysician\nbeneficiary\u201d who finds a \u201cnew employer [who] desir[es] to petition\n[USCIS] on the physician\u2019s behalf\u201d must submit a new petition, but\n\u201cwill retain the priority date from the initial\u201d petition). Finally, the\nplurality suggests that priority date retention can operate independently\nof automatic conversion only if the date to be retained is attached to\na valid petition. Ante, at 30, and n. 16. But that cannot be squared with\nUSCIS\u2019s longstanding practice of allowing F2A beneficiaries to retain\nthe priority dates from their no-longer valid petitions upon the filing of\na new petition.\n12           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   In the end, the plurality suggests that we should defer\nto the BIA\u2019s all-or-nothing approach because \u201ccontext\ncompels\u201d it. Ante, at 28. Yet fatally absent from the plu-\nrality\u2019s discussion of context is any mention of the first\nclause of the very same provision, which, as the plurality\nadmits, unambiguously confers relief upon all five catego-\nries of aged-out children. That clause is dispositive, be-\ncause\u2014assuming that F2A beneficiaries alone can receive\nautomatic conversion\u2014a reading that treats automatic\nconversion and priority date retention as independent\nbenefits is the only one that would \u201cproduc[e] a substan-\ntive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\u201d\nUnited Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest\nAssociates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988); see also Home\nBuilders, 551 U.

The ordinary\nmeaning of \u201cconvert\u201d is \u201cto change (something) into a\ndifferent form.\u201d Id., at 444. Here, the statute specifies the\nform into which an aged-out child\u2019s petition shall be\nchanged: another petition in the \u201cappropriate category.\u201d\n\u00a71153(h)(3). Tying the terms together, then, \u201cautomatic\nconversion\u201d means changing an old petition into a new\npetition in an appropriate category upon the occurrence\nof some predicate event, without a further decision or\ncontingency.\n   All aged-out beneficiaries can have their petitions auto-\nmatically converted under this definition. Perhaps most\nsensibly, all five categories of petitions may be converted\nto an appropriate category, without any further decision or\ncontingency, upon a logical predicate event: when USCIS\nreceives confirmation that an appropriate category exists.\nTo see how this would work, recall the case of Norma Uy,\nand her daughter, Ruth. Norma was the principal benefi-\nciary of an F4 petition filed by her U. S. citizen sister;\nRuth was a derivative beneficiary of the same petition.\nBecause Ruth had aged out of derivative beneficiary sta-\ntus prior to Norma\u2019s reaching the front of the visa line,\nNorma immigrated to the United States without Ruth.\nOnce Norma became an LPR, however, she also became\neligible to file a new petition on Ruth\u2019s behalf under\nthe F2B category (unmarried adult children of LPRs),\n\u00a71153(a)(2)(B). Thus, once Norma provides confirmation\nof that eligibility to sponsor Ruth (i.e., that she is an LPR,\nthat Ruth is her daughter, and that she has not committed\ndisqualifying criminal conduct, see ante, at 4), Ruth\u2019s\noriginal F4 petition can automatically be converted to an\n14              SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nF2B petition, with no additional decision or contingency.5\n   Indeed, this is how USCIS already applies automatic\nconversion in other contexts. For example, when an LPR\nhas filed an F2A petition on behalf of a spouse or child,\nand the LPR subsequently becomes a U. S. citizen, a pro-\nvision entitled \u201c[a]utomatic conversion of preference classi-\nfication,\u201d 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i), permits the F2A petition to be\nautomatically converted to an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d peti-\ntion, \u00a7204.2(i)(3). See ante, at 16. Significantly, the predi-\ncate event that triggers this conversion is the agency\u2019s\nreceipt of proof that the petition\u2019s sponsor has become a\nU. S. citizen\u2014proof, in other words, that there is an ap-\npropriate category into which the petition can be converted.6\nSection 1153(h)(3)\u2019s automatic conversion remedy can\nsensibly be administered in the same way.\n   The plurality\u2019s contrary conclusion that automatic\nconversion is impossible for all but one category of family-\npreference petitions hinges on three basic misunderstand-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Of  course, just like any other beneficiary of a family visa petition,\none whose petition has been automatically converted must still satisfy\nthe requirements for actually obtaining a visa. See ante, at 5. For\nexample, all visa applicants must attach an \u201caffidavit of support\u201d from\ntheir sponsors. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71182(a)(4)(C)(ii). As is true for any other\nbeneficiary, nothing stops a sponsor from declining to swear their\nsupport for the beneficiary of an automatically converted petition after\na visa has become available. Converting petitions upon proof of an\nappropriate category therefore produces no uncertainties or contingen-\ncies that do not already exist for all family visa applicants to begin\nwith.\n   6 See Dept. of State, If You Were an LPR and Are Now a U. S. Citizen:\n\nUpgrading a Petition, online at http://travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/\ntypes/types_2991.html#5. The regulation cited by the plurality, 8 CFR\n\u00a7204.2(i), is not to the contrary; it merely establishes that when an\nautomatic conversion occurs, it shall be treated as \u201c[e]ffective upon the\ndate of naturalization,\u201d \u00a7204.2(i)(3). As the State Department\u2019s instruc-\ntions make clear, the conversion itself takes place after the new citizen\n\u201csend[s] proof of [her] U.

S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nings. First, the plurality contends that automatic conver-\nsion is triggered not by confirmation of the existence of an\nappropriate category, but rather by a different predicate\nevent: the moment when \u201c \u2018an immigrant visa number\nbec[omes] available for the alien\u2019s parent.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 19.\nThis is a curious argument, not least because nothing in\n\u00a71153(h)(3) suggests it. That provision simply makes\nautomatic conversion available \u201c[i]f the age of an alien is\ndetermined\u201d to be \u201cbe 21 years of age or older\u201d for pur-\nposes of \u00a71153(d). Section 1153(h)(3) thus states the\ncondition that an immigrant must satisfy to be eligible for\nautomatic conversion, but it nowhere commands when the\nconversion should occur. There is no reason why conver-\nsion cannot occur at the logical point just described: the\nmoment when USCIS receives proof that an appropriate\ncategory exists.\n   The plurality acknowledges that \u00a71153(h)(3) \u201cdoes not\nexplicitly identify th[e] point in time\u201d at which a \u201cpetition\nis to be \u2018converted.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 18. It nevertheless suggests\nthat the date when a conversion occurs \u201cis best viewed\u201d as\nthe date when a visa became available for the aged-out\nchild\u2019s parent. Ante, at 19. But Congress could not have\nintended conversion to occur at that point for a glaring\nreason: The date on which a visa becomes available for an\naged-out child\u2019s parent occurs before the point at which\nthe child is determined to have aged-out under \u00a71153(d)\u2014\nthe very requirement \u00a71153(h)(3) prescribes for the aged-\nout child to be eligible for automatic conversion in the first\nplace. As the plurality explains, ante, at 5\u20136, such age\ndeterminations occur when an immigration official re-\nviews the child\u2019s derivative visa application, which invari-\nably happens after a visa became available for the child\u2019s\nparent as the principal beneficiary. At best, then, the\nplurality\u2019s interpretation requires USCIS to convert peti-\ntions at a time when it does not know which petitions are\neligible for conversion; at worst, it requires the automatic\n16           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nconversion of petitions benefiting immigrants who will\nnever even qualify for such relief (i.e., aged-out immi-\ngrants who, for any number of reasons, never file a visa\napplication and so are never determined by officials to be\nolder than 21).\n   Faced with this fact, the plurality falls back to the posi-\ntion that automatic conversion must merely be viewed as\nhaving occurred \u201cas of th[e] . . . date\u201d when a parent\u2019s visa\nbecomes available, although the actual \u201cassess[ment]\u201d of\nthe conversion will necessarily occur at some future point\nin time. Ante, at 24, n. 13. That approach, however,\nintroduces precisely the kind of \u201cadditional decisions,\ncontingencies, and delays\u201d that the plurality regards as\ninconsistent with the ordinary meaning of \u201cautomatic,\u201d\nante, at 15. For even under the plurality\u2019s view, automatic\nconversion cannot actually be \u201cassesse[d]\u201d until and unless\nthe aged-out child decides to apply for a visa and officials\nassessing the child\u2019s application deem her to have aged out\n(events which may themselves be contingent on the child\u2019s\nparent first filing her own successful visa application, see\nante, at 6). The far simpler approach is for conversion to\noccur automatically upon the most logical moment sug-\ngested by the statute: the moment when USCIS confirms\nthat an \u201cappropriate category\u201d exists, \u00a71153(h)(3). Indeed,\nthe plurality fails to explain why this cannot be the proper\npredicate; it simply dismisses such an approach as sup-\nported \u201conly\u201d by \u201ca single-minded resolve . . . to grant\nrelief to every possible aged-out beneficiary.\u201d Ante, at 25,\nn. 13. But that criticism is revealing: The \u201csingle-minded\nresolve\u201d the plurality maligns is Congress\u2019 own, for it is\nCongress that expressly provided, in the eligibility clause,\nfor aged-out beneficiaries in all five categories to be granted\nrelief.\n   The plurality\u2019s second argument is a corollary of its\nfirst. If automatic conversion must occur when a visa first\nbecomes available for a parent, the plurality frets, that\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    17\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwill mean an aged-out child will have her petition auto-\nmatically converted before immigration officials can ascer-\ntain whether her parent is even qualified to sponsor her.\nSee ante, at 17\u201318. True enough, but that only confirms\nthat it makes no sense to force USCIS to convert petitions\nso prematurely. The plurality\u2019s fears can all be averted by\nhaving automatic conversion occur, as with petitions\nsponsored by LPRs who later become U. S. citizens, supra,\nat 13\u201315, when USCIS receives confirmation that conver-\nsion is appropriate.7\n   The plurality\u2019s final argument is that something about\nthe term \u201cconversion\u201d precludes relief for all but the aged-\nout derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions. The plurality\naccepts that \u201cconversion\u201d will always require changing\nsome aspects of a petition, including its preference category\n(e.g., from F2A to F2B) and the identity of its principal\nbeneficiary (e.g., from an aged-out child\u2019s parent to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The plurality is unsatisfied with this approach to automatic conver-\n\nsion on the theory that, in order to eliminate all additional \u201cdecisions,\ncontingencies, or delays\u201d in the process, this solution postpones the\nmoment of \u201cconversion\u201d until the necessary contingencies are satisfied.\nYet the plurality\u2019s approach does the same thing, because even on its\naccount, some \u201cdecisions, contingencies, or delays\u201d must occur before\nconversion can actually be assessed by immigration officials (i.e., a\nparent\u2019s visa must become available, the child must apply for a visa,\nand immigration officials must deem her to have aged out, see supra, at\n16). So the only question is whether the \u201cconversion\u201d should be consid-\nered to occur after all \u201cdecisions, contingencies, or delays\u201d are in the\npast such that there is an appropriate category for conversion, or after\nonly some. The former understanding would allow the unambiguous\nlanguage of the eligibility clause to be carried into effect; the latter\nwould preclude relief for four categories of derivative beneficiaries. In\nsupport of its restrictive interpretation, the plurality offers only the\nargument that converting a petition upon proof of an appropriate\ncategory would require the \u201cfiling of a new document. . . that shows the\nparent\u2019s eligibility to sponsor her aged-out [child].\u201d Ante, at 26, n. 14.\nThe fact that a statute may require an agency to process a form is not a\nreason to disregard a coherent reading of a statute in favor of a self-\ncontradictory one.\n18           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nchild). But the plurality asserts that a related kind of\nchange is entirely off the table: a change to the identity of\nthe petition\u2019s sponsor. Ante, at 15. If a converted petition\nrequires a different sponsor than the original petition, the\nplurality suggests, then it cannot be \u201cconverted\u201d at all.\n   The plurality points to nothing in the plain meaning of\n\u201cconversion\u201d that supports this distinction. It instead\nargues that a \u201cconversion\u201d cannot entail a change to the\nidentity of a petition\u2019s sponsor because that is \u201cthe exclu-\nsive way immigration law used the term when Congress\nenacted the CSPA.\u201d Ante, at 16. But immigration law has\nlong allowed petitions to be converted from one category to\nanother in contexts where doing so requires changing the\nsponsor\u2019s identity. In 2006, for example, the Secretary of\nHomeland Security promulgated a regulatory provision\nentitled \u201cautomatic conversion of preference classifica-\ntion,\u201d 8 CFR \u00a7204.2(i)(1)(iv), which allows the automatic\nconversion of a petition filed by a U. S. citizen on behalf of\nher spouse to a widower petition if the citizen dies before\nthe petition is approved. That conversion requires chang-\ning the sponsor from the citizen to the widower himself.\nThe fact that the agency used the word \u201cconversion\u201d to\nrefer to a process in which the petition\u2019s sponsor was\nchanged, just a few years after 8 U. S. C. \u00a71153(h)(3) was\nenacted, strongly suggests that the term did not have the\nexclusive meaning that the plurality suggests. Similarly,\n\u00a71154(a)(1)(D)(i)(III), a provision enacted two years before\n\u00a71153(h)(3), see Victims of Trafficking and Violence Pro-\ntection Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1522, provides that a peti-\ntion filed by a battered spouse on behalf of her child \u201cshall\nbe considered\u201d a self-petition filed by the child herself if\nthe child ages out\u2014a conversion that obviously requires\nchanging the identity of the sponsor from the battered\nspouse to the aged-out child. And \u00a71153(h)(4) confirms\nthat such \u201cself-petitioners\u201d are entitled to \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s\nautomatic conversion remedy.

J., concurring in\njudgment). The concurrence thus acknowledges that the\neligibility clause encompasses aged-out beneficiaries of\nfamily-preference petitions in the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and\nF4 categories.\n   The concurrence nonetheless concludes that the BIA\nwas free to exclude F1, F2B, F3, and F4 beneficiaries from\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Moreover, had Congress actually intended to permit relief only\n\nwhere a new petition has the same sponsor as the original petition, it\nhad a ready model in the language of a pre-existing regulation.

S. 233, 248 (2010).\n   The plurality\u2019s argument that a \u201cconversion\u201d cannot entail a change\nto a petition\u2019s sponsor ultimately boils down to this: A \u201cconversion\u201d\ncannot include \u201cany substantive alteration\u201d to a petition, ante, at 15,\nexcept when it can. For example, a \u201cconversion\u201d can (indeed, must)\nentail changing a petition\u2019s family-preference category and changing\nthe petition\u2019s principal beneficiary (from the aged-out child\u2019s parent to\nthe child herself). And the plurality concedes that in other contexts,\nconversion must entail changing the identity of a petition\u2019s sponsor\nfrom the beneficiary\u2019s qualifying relative to the beneficiary himself.\nAnte, at 16\u201317, n. 10. The plurality does not explain why the word\n\u201cconversion\u201d can encompass all of these other substantive alterations,\nbut not a change to the identity of a petition\u2019s sponsor in just this case.\n20           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe clear scope of the eligibility clause because of a per-\nceived ambiguity as to which beneficiaries can receive\n\u201cautomatic conversion.\u201d See ante, at 4 (\u201cCongress did not\nspeak clearly to which petitions can \u2018automatically be\nconverted\u2019 \u201d). In other words, the concurrence concludes\nthat it was reasonable for the agency to ignore the clear\ntext of the eligibility clause because the phrase \u201cautomatic\nconversion\u201d might be read in a manner that would benefit\nF2A beneficiaries alone.\n   This is an unusual way to interpret a statute. The\nconcurrence identifies no case in which we have deferred\nto an agency\u2019s decision to use ambiguity in one portion of a\nstatute as a license to ignore another statutory provision\nthat is perfectly clear. To the contrary, \u201c[a] provision that\nmay seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the\nremainder of the statutory scheme . . . because only one of\nthe permissible meanings produces a substantive effect\nthat is compatible with the rest of the law.\u201d United Sav.\nAssn. of Tex., 484 U. S., at 371.\n   The concurrence justifies its conclusion only by treating\nthe eligibility clause as a nullity. The concurrence is quite\ncandid about its approach, arguing that \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s relief\nclause is its \u201conly operative provision\u201d and that the eligi-\nbility clause does not \u201cgrant anything to anyone.\u201d Ante, at\n3. Yet \u201c[i]t is our duty \u2018to give effect, if possible, to every\nclause and word of a statute.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Menasche,\n348 U. S. 528, 538\u2013539 (1955). And there is an easy way\nto give meaning to the eligibility clause: The clause identi-\nfies who is entitled to the benefits specified in the ensuing\nrelief clause.\n   The concurrence relies ultimately on an irrelevant\nhypothetical: \u201cIf a student is determined to be enrolled at\nan accredited university, the student\u2019s cost of off-campus\nhousing shall be deductible on her tax return.\u201d Ante, at 3.\nIn this example, the concurrence points out, it is \u201cappar-\nent. . . that an enrolled student who lives on campus is not\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    21\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nentitled to the deduction, even though the student falls\nwithin the conditional first clause.\u201d Ibid. That is correct,\nbut it says nothing about this case. For in the hypothet-\nical, it is plain that the promised relief (a tax deduction for\noff-campus housing) cannot apply to the persons at issue\n(students who live on campus). Here, however, the relief\npromised in \u00a71153(h)(3) (priority date retention and auto-\nmatic conversion) can be given to persons specified in\nthe initial eligibility clause (aged-out children in all five\nfamily-preference categories). See supra, at 9\u201319. And\nonce one recognizes that aged-out children in each cate-\ngory unambiguously covered by the eligibility clause can\nreceive relief, the BIA\u2019s view that no children in four of\nthose categories can ever receive any relief cannot be\nreasonable.9\n                       *    *      *\n  Congress faced a difficult choice when it enacted\n\u00a71153(h)(3). Given the \u201czero-sum world of allocating a\nlimited number of visas,\u201d ante, at 33, Congress could have\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 More  fundamentally, the concurrence\u2019s hypothetical is irrelevant\nbecause it altogether ignores a critical feature of the statute before us:\n\u00a71153(h)(2)\u2019s express enumeration of the covered petitions to include\npetitions filed within the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and F4 preference catego-\nries. See supra, at 5\u20136. A proper analogy would therefore be a provi-\nsion that says the following: \u201cIf a student is determined to be enrolled\nat an accredited junior college, community college, or 4-year college, the\nstudent\u2019s room and board shall be tax-deductible and the student shall\nreceive financial aid.\u201d Is there any permissible reading of this provision\nunder which, although expressly covered in the eligibility clause, all\njunior and community college students are categorically forbidden to\nreceive both the tax deduction and financial aid? Of course not. And\nthat would be true even if the term \u201croom and board\u201d were ambiguous\nand thus open to an interpretation under which only 4-year students\ncould receive the tax deduction. Likewise here, where F1, F2B, F3, and\nF4 derivative beneficiaries may not be categorically excluded from relief\nbecause they are indisputably covered by \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2019s eligibility clause\nand able to receive the relief described in the relief clause.\n22           SCIALABBA v. CUELLAR DE OSORIO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nrequired aged-out children like Ruth Uy to lose their place\nin line and wait many additional years (or even decades)\nbefore being reunited with their parents, or it could have\nenabled such immigrants to retain their place in line\u2014\nalbeit at the cost of extending the wait for other immi-\ngrants by some shorter amount. Whatever one might\nthink of the policy arguments on each side, however, this\nmuch is clear: Congress made a choice. The plurality\u2019s\ncontrary view\u2014that Congress actually delegated the\nchoice to the BIA in a statute that unambiguously encom-\npasses aged-out children in all five preference categories\nand commands that they \u201cshall retain the[ir] original\npriority date[s],\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3)\u2014is untenable.\n   In the end, then, this case should have been resolved\nunder a commonsense approach to statutory interpreta-\ntion: Using traditional tools of statutory construction,\nagencies and courts should try to give effect to a statute\u2019s\nclear text before concluding that Congress has legislated\nin conflicting and unintelligible terms. Here, there are\nstraightforward interpretations of \u00a71153(h)(3) that allow it\nto function as a coherent whole. Because the BIA and the\nCourt ignore these interpretations and advance a con-\nstruction that contravenes the language Congress wrote, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
