Argued April 23, 2014\u2014Decided June 9, 2014\nFederal law pre-empts state-law statutes of limitations in certain tort\n  actions involving personal injury or property damage arising from the\n  release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the\n  environment. 42 U. S. C. \u00a79658. Petitioner CTS Corporation sold\n  property on which it had stored chemicals as part its operations as an\n  electronics plant. Twenty-four years later, respondents, the owners\n  of portions of that property and adjacent landowners, sued, alleging\n  damages from the stored contaminants. CTS moved to dismiss, cit-\n  ing a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to\n  a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the defendant\u2019s last cul-\n  pable act. Because CTS\u2019s last act occurred when it sold the property,\n  the District Court granted the motion. Finding \u00a79658 ambiguous, the\n  Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the statute\u2019s remedial purpose\n  favored pre-emption.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed.\n723 F. 3d 434, reversed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  all but Part II\u2013D, concluding that \u00a79658 does not pre-empt state\n  statutes of repose. Pp. 5\u201316.\n     (a) The outcome here turns on whether \u00a79658 distinguishes be-\n  tween statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, which are both\n  used to limit the temporal extent or duration of tort liability. There\n  is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two,\n  but their specified time periods are measured differently and they\n  seek to attain different purposes and objectives. Statutes of limita-\n  tions are designed to promote justice by encouraging plaintiffs to pur-\n  sue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues. Stat-\n2                      CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    utes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should\n    be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time\n    and are measured from the date of the defendant\u2019s last culpable act\n    or omission. The application of equitable tolling underscores their\n    difference in purpose. Because a statute of limitations\u2019 purpose is not\n    furthered by barring an untimely action brought by a plaintiff who\n    was prevented by extraordinary circumstances from timely filing, eq-\n    uitable tolling operates to pause the running of the statute. The pur-\n    pose of statutes of repose are unaffected by such circumstances, and\n    equitable tolling does not apply. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) The text and structure of \u00a79658 resolve this case. Under that\n    provision, pre-emption is characterized as an \u201c[e]xception,\u201d\n    \u00a79658(a)(1), to the regular rule that the \u201cthe statute of limitations es-\n    tablished under State law\u201d applies. The \u201capplicable limitations peri-\n    od,\u201d the \u201ccommencement date\u201d of which is subject to pre-emption, is\n    defined as \u201cthe period specified in a statute of limitations.\u201d\n    \u00a79658(b)(2). That term appears four times, and \u201cstatute of repose\u201d\n    does not appear at all. While it is apparent from the historical devel-\n    opment of the two terms that their general usage has not always\n    been precise, their distinction was well enough established to be re-\n    flected in the 1982 Study Group Report that guided \u00a79658\u2019s enact-\n    ment, acknowledged the distinction, and urged the repeal of both\n    types of statutes. Because that distinction is not similarly reflected\n    in \u00a79658, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not intend to pre-\n    empt statutes of repose.\n       Other textual features further support this conclusion. It would be\n    awkward to use the singular \u201capplicable limitations period\u201d to man-\n    date pre-emption of two different time periods with two different\n    purposes. And the definition of that limitations period as \u201cthe peri-\n    od\u201d during which a \u201ccivil action\u201d under state law \u201cmay be brought,\u201d\n    \u00a79658(b)(2), presupposes that a civil action exists. A statute of re-\n    pose, in contrast, can prohibit a cause of action from ever coming into\n    existence. Section 9658\u2019s inclusion of a tolling rule also suggests that\n    the statute\u2019s reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which tradi-\n    tionally have been subject to tolling. Respondents contend that\n    \u00a79658 also effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose\n    create an obstacle to Congress\u2019 purposes and objectives, see Wyeth v.\n    Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563\u2013564. But the level of generality at which\n    the statute\u2019s purpose is framed affects whether a specific reading will\n    further or hinder that purpose. Here, where Congress chose to leave\n    many areas of state law untouched, respondents have not shown that\n    statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of\n    statutory purposes.

PETER \n\n               WALDBURGER ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 9, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court,\nexcept as to Part II\u2013D.\n  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compen\u00ad\nsation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 94 Stat. 2767,\nas amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a79601 et seq., contains a provision\nthat by its terms pre-empts statutes of limitations appli\u00ad\ncable to state-law tort actions in certain circumstances.\n\u00a79658. Section 9658 applies to statutes of limitations\ngoverning actions for personal injury or property damage\narising from the release of a hazardous substance, pollu\u00ad\ntant, or contaminant into the environment.\n  Section 9658 adopts what is known as the discovery\nrule. Under this framework, statutes of limitations in\ncovered actions begin to run when a plaintiff discovers, or\nreasonably should have discovered, that the harm in\nquestion was caused by the contaminant. A person who is\nexposed to a toxic contaminant may not develop or show\nsigns of resulting injury for many years, and so Congress\nenacted \u00a79658 out of concern for long latency periods.\n  It is undoubted that the discovery rule in \u00a79658 pre\u00ad\nempts state statutes of limitations that are in conflict with\n2               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits terms. The question presented in this case is whether\n\u00a79658 also pre-empts state statutes of repose.\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit held that \u00a79658 does pre-empt statutes of repose.\nThat holding was in error, and, for the reasons that follow,\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.\n                             I\n  Congress enacted CERCLA in 1980 \u201cto promote \u2018 \u201cthe\ntimely cleanup of hazardous waste sites\u201d \u2019 and to ensure\nthat the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those\nresponsible for the contamination.\u201d Burlington N. & S. F.\nR. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. 599, 602 (2009) (quoting\nConsolidated Edison Co. of New York v. UGI Utilities, Inc.,\n423 F. 3d 90, 94 (CA2 2005)). The Act provided a federal\ncause of action to recover costs of cleanup from culpable\nentities but not a federal cause of action for personal\ninjury or property damage. Instead, CERCLA directed\npreparation of an expert report to determine \u201cthe ade-\nquacy of existing common law and statutory remedies in\nproviding legal redress for harm to man and the environ\u00ad\nment caused by the release of hazardous substances into\nthe environment,\u201d including \u201cbarriers to recovery posed by\nexisting statutes of limitations.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79651(e)(1),\n(3)(F).\n  The 1982 report resulting from that statutory directive\nproposed certain changes to state tort law. Senate Com\u00ad\nmittee on Environment and Public Works, Superfund\nSection 301(e) Study Group, Injuries and Damages from\nHazardous Wastes\u2014Analysis and Improvement of Legal\nRemedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (Comm. Print 1982) (here\u00ad\ninafter Study Group Report or Report). As relevant here,\nthe Study Group Report noted the long latency periods\ninvolved in harm caused by toxic substances and \u201crecom\u00ad\nmend[ed] that all states that have not already done so,\nclearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or\ndisease and its cause.\u201d Id., at pt. 1, 256. The Report\nfurther stated: \u201cThe Recommendation is intended also to\ncover the repeal of the statutes of repose which, in a num\u00ad\nber of states[,] have the same effect as some statutes of\nlimitation in barring [a] plaintiff \u2019s claim before he knows\nthat he has one.\u201d Ibid.\n   Congress did not wait long for States to respond to some\nor all of the Report\u2019s recommendations. Instead, Congress\ndecided to act at the federal level. Congress amended\nCERCLA in 1986 to add the provision now codified in\n\u00a79658. Whether \u00a79658 repeals statutes of repose, as the\nStudy Group Report recommended, is the question to be\naddressed here.\n   The instant case arose in North Carolina, where CTS\nCorporation ran an electronics plant in Asheville from\n1959 to 1985. (A subsidiary, CTS of Asheville, Inc., ran\nthe plant until 1983, when CTS Corporation took over.)\nThe plant manufactured and disposed of electronics and\nelectronic parts. In the process, it stored the chemicals\ntrichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-1, 2-dichloroethane (DCE).\nIn 1987, CTS sold the property, along with a promise that\nthe site was environmentally sound. The buyer eventually\nsold portions of the property to individuals who, along\nwith adjacent landowners, brought this suit alleging dam\u00ad\nage from contaminants on the land. Those who alleged\nthe injury and damage were the plaintiffs in the trial court\nand are respondents here.\n   Their suit was brought in 2011, 24 years after CTS sold\nthe property. The suit, filed in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of North Carolina, was a\nstate-law nuisance action against CTS, petitioner here.\nRespondents sought \u201creclamation\u201d of \u201ctoxic chemical con\u00ad\ntaminants\u201d belonging to petitioner, \u201cremediation of the\nenvironmental harm caused\u201d by contaminants, and \u201cmone\u00ad\ntary damages in an amount that will fully compensate\n4                CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthem for all the losses and damages they have suffered,\n. . . and will suffer in the future.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n57a. Respondents claim that in 2009 they learned from\nthe Environmental Protection Agency that their well\nwater was contaminated, allegedly while petitioner oper\u00ad\nated its electronics plant.\n    Citing North Carolina\u2019s statute of repose, CTS moved to\ndismiss the claim. That statute prevents subjecting a\ndefendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after\nthe last culpable act of the defendant. N. C. Gen. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a71\u201352(16) (Lexis 2013) (\u201c[N]o cause of action shall\naccrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of\nthe defendant giving rise to the cause of action\u201d); Robinson\nv. Wadford, ___ N. C. App. ___, ___, 731 S. E. 2d 539, 541\n(2012) (referring to the provision as a \u201cstatute of repose\u201d).\nBecause CTS\u2019 last act occurred in 1987, when it sold the\nelectronics plant, the District Court accepted the recom\u00ad\nmendation of a Magistrate Judge and granted CTS\u2019 motion\nto dismiss.\n    A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit reversed, ruling that \u00a79658 pre-empted the statute\nof repose. 723 F. 3d 434 (2013). The majority found \u00a79658\n\u201cambiguous,\u201d but also found that the interpretation in\nfavor of pre-emption was preferable because of CERCLA\u2019s\nremedial purpose. Id., at 443\u2013444.\n    Judge Thacker dissented. Id., at 445\u2013454. She found\nthe statutory text\u2019s exclusion of statutes of repose to be\n\u201cplain and unambiguous.\u201d Id., at 445. She further indi\u00ad\ncated that, even \u201cif the preemptive effect of \u00a79658 were\nsusceptible to two interpretations, a presumption against\npreemption would counsel that we should limit \u00a79658\u2019s\npreemptive reach to statutes of limitations without also\nextending it to statutes of repose.\u201d Ibid.\n    The Courts of Appeals, as well as the Supreme Court of\nSouth Dakota, have rendered conflicting judgments on\nthis question.

Statutes of limitations and stat\u00ad\nutes of repose both are mechanisms used to limit the\ntemporal extent or duration of liability for tortious acts.\nBoth types of statute can operate to bar a plaintiff \u2019s suit,\nand in each instance time is the controlling factor. There\nis considerable common ground in the policies underlying\nthe two types of statute. But the time periods specified\nare measured from different points, and the statutes seek\nto attain different purposes and objectives. And, as will be\nexplained, \u00a79658 mandates a distinction between the two.\n   In the ordinary course, a statute of limitations creates \u201ca\ntime limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when\nthe claim accrued.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1546 (9th ed.\n2009) (Black\u2019s); see also Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life &\nAccident Ins. Co., 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4)\n(\u201cAs a general matter, a statute of limitations begins to\nrun when the cause of action \u2018 \u201caccrues\u201d \u2019\u2014that is, when\n\u2018the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief \u2019 \u201d (quoting Bay\nArea Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v.\nFerbar Corp. of Cal., Inc., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997))).\nMeasured by this standard, a claim accrues in a personal\u00ad\ninjury or property-damage action \u201cwhen the injury oc\u00ad\ncurred or was discovered.\u201d Black\u2019s 1546. For example,\nNorth Carolina, whose laws are central to this case, has a\nstatute of limitations that allows a person three years to\nbring suit for personal injury or property damage, begin\u00ad\n6                CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nning on the date that damage \u201cbecomes apparent or ought\nreasonably to have become apparent to the claimant,\nwhichever event first occurs.\u201d N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a71\u2013\n52(16).\n   A statute of repose, on the other hand, puts an outer\nlimit on the right to bring a civil action. That limit is\nmeasured not from the date on which the claim accrues\nbut instead from the date of the last culpable act or omis\u00ad\nsion of the defendant. A statute of repose \u201cbar[s] any suit\nthat is brought after a specified time since the defendant\nacted (such as by designing or manufacturing a product),\neven if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a\nresulting injury.\u201d Black\u2019s 1546. The statute of repose\nlimit is \u201cnot related to the accrual of any cause of action;\nthe injury need not have occurred, much less have been\ndiscovered.\u201d 54 C. J. S., Limitations of Actions \u00a77, p. 24\n(2010) (hereinafter C. J. S.). The repose provision is there\u00ad\nfore equivalent to \u201ca cutoff,\u201d Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,\nPrupis & Petigrow v.

S. \u00a77, at 24.\n   Although there is substantial overlap between the poli\u00ad\ncies of the two types of statute, each has a distinct purpose\nand each is targeted at a different actor. Statutes of limi\u00ad\ntations require plaintiffs to pursue \u201cdiligent prosecution of\nknown claims.\u201d Black\u2019s 1546. Statutes of limitations\n\u201cpromote justice by preventing surprises through [plain\u00ad\ntiffs\u2019] revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber\nuntil evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and\nwitnesses have disappeared.\u201d Railroad Telegraphers v.\nRailway Express Agency, Inc., 321 U. S. 342, 348\u2013349\n(1944). Statutes of repose also encourage plaintiffs to\nbring actions in a timely manner, and for many of the\nsame reasons. But the rationale has a different emphasis.\nStatutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a\ndefendant should \u201cbe free from liability after the legisla\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntively determined period of time.\u201d C. J. S. \u00a77, at 24; see\nalso School Board of Norfolk v. United States Gypsum Co.,\n234 Va. 32, 37, 360 S. E. 2d 325, 328 (1987) (\u201c[S]tatutes\nof repose reflect legislative decisions that as a matter of\npolicy there should be a specific time beyond which a\ndefendant should no longer be subjected to protracted\nliability\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Like a\ndischarge in bankruptcy, a statute of repose can be said to\nprovide a fresh start or freedom from liability. Indeed, the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause has been described as \u201ca statute\nof repose\u201d because it in part embodies the idea that at\nsome point a defendant should be able to put past events\nbehind him.

The Court of\nAppeals was in error when it treated this as a substitute\nfor a conclusion grounded in the statute\u2019s text and struc\u00ad\nture. After all, almost every statute might be described as\nremedial in the sense that all statutes are designed to\nremedy some problem. And even if the Court identified\nsome subset of statutes as especially remedial, the Court\nhas emphasized that \u201cno legislation pursues its purposes\nat all costs.\u201d Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522,\n525\u2013526 (1987) (per curiam). Congressional intent is\ndiscerned primarily from the statutory text. In any event,\nwere the Court to adopt a presumption to help resolve\nambiguity, substantial support also exists for the proposi\u00ad\ntion that \u201cthe States\u2019 coordinate role in government coun\u00ad\nsels against reading\u201d federal laws such as \u00a79658 \u201cto re\u00ad\nstrict the States\u2019 sovereign capacity to regulate\u201d in areas of\ntraditional state concern. FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health\nSystem, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 18).\n   Turning to the statutory text, the Court notes first that\n\u00a79658, in the caption of subsection (a), characterizes pre\u00ad\nemption as an \u201c[e]xception\u201d to the regular rule.\n\u00a79658(a)(1). Section 9658 contains another subsection,\nwith the heading \u201cState law generally applicable,\u201d that\nprovides the rule that \u201cthe statute of limitations estab\u00ad\nlished under State law shall apply.\u201d \u00a79658(a)(2). Under\nthis structure, state law is not pre-empted unless it fits\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninto the precise terms of the exception.\n   The statute defines the \u201capplicable limitations period,\u201d\nthe \u201ccommencement date\u201d of which is subject to pre\u00ad\nemption, as a period specified in \u201ca statute of limitations.\u201d\n\u00a79658(b)(2). Indeed, \u00a79658 uses the term \u201cstatute of limi\u00ad\ntations\u201d four times (not including the caption), but not the\nterm \u201cstatute of repose.\u201d This is instructive, but it is not\ndispositive. While the term \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d has\nacquired a precise meaning, distinct from \u201cstatute of\nrepose,\u201d and while that is its primary meaning, it must be\nacknowledged that the term \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d is\nsometimes used in a less formal way. In that sense, it can\nrefer to any provision restricting the time in which a\nplaintiff must bring suit. See Black\u2019s 1546; see also Ernst\n& Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 210 (1976). Con\u00ad\ngress has used the term \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d when\nenacting statutes of repose. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u2013\n6(h)(1)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) (2012 ed.) (creating a statute of repose\nand placing it in a provision entitled \u201cStatute of limita\u00ad\ntions\u201d); 42 U. S. C. \u00a72278 (same). And petitioner does not\npoint out an example in which Congress has used the term\n\u201cstatute of repose.\u201d So the Court must proceed to examine\nother evidence of the meaning of the term \u201cstatute of\nlimitations\u201d as it is used in \u00a79658. The parties debate the\nhistorical development of the terms \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d\nand \u201cstatute of repose\u201d in an effort to show how these\nterms were likely understood in 1986, when Congress\nenacted \u00a79658. It is apparent that the distinction between\nstatutes of limitations and statutes of repose was under\u00ad\nstood by some courts and scholars before 1986. The 1977\nRestatement of Torts noted that \u201c[i]n recent years special\n\u2018statutes of repose\u2019 have been adopted in some states . . . .\nThe statutory period in these acts is usually longer than\nthat for the regular statute of limitations, but . . . may\nhave run before a cause of action came fully into exist\u00ad\nence.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7899, Comment g.\n12               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   But that usage, now predominant, then was not the only\ndefinition of the two terms. One scholar, writing in 1981,\ndescribed multiple usages of the terms, including both a\nusage in which the terms are equivalent and also the\nmodern, more precise usage. McGovern, The Variety,\nPolicy and Constitutionality of Product Liability Statutes\nof Repose, 30 Am. U. L. Rev. 579, 584 (1981) (describing a\nstatute of repose as \u201cdistinct from a statute of limitation\nbecause [a statute of repose] begins to run at a time unre\u00ad\nlated to the traditional accrual of the cause of action\u201d).\n   Respondents note that an entry in Black\u2019s Law Diction\u00ad\nary from 1979 describes a statute of limitations as follows:\n\u201cStatutes of limitations are statutes of repose.\u201d Black\u2019s\n835 (5th ed.). That statement likely reflects an earlier,\nbroader usage in which the term \u201cstatute of repose\u201d re\u00ad\nferred to all provisions delineating the time in which a\nplaintiff must bring suit. See, e.g., Pillow v. Roberts, 13\nHow. 472, 477 (1852) (\u201cStatutes of limitation . . . are stat\u00ad\nutes of repose, and should not be evaded by a forced con\u00ad\nstruction\u201d); Rosenberg v. North Bergen, 61 N. J. 190, 201,\n293 A. 2d 662, 667 (1972) (\u201cAll statutes limiting in any\nway the time within which a judicial remedy may be\nsought are statutes of repose\u201d); Black\u2019s 1077 (rev. 4th ed.\n1968) (defining \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d as \u201c[a] statute . . .\ndeclaring that no suit shall be maintained . . . unless\nbrought within a specified period after the right accrued.\nStatutes of limitation are statutes of repose\u201d); Ballentine\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1233 (2d ed. 1948) (similar). That usage\ndoes not necessarily support respondents\u2019 interpretation,\nbecause the broad usage of the term \u201cstatute of repose\u201d\ndoes not mean that the term \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d must\nrefer to both types of statute.\n   From all this, it is apparent that general usage of the\nlegal terms has not always been precise, but the concept\nthat statutes of repose and statutes of limitations are\ndistinct was well enough established to be reflected in the\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1982 Study Group Report, commissioned by Congress. In\none of its recommendations, the Study Group Report\ncalled on States to adopt the discovery rule now embodied\nin \u00a79658. Study Group Report, pt. 1, at 256. The Report\nacknowledged that statutes of repose were not equivalent\nto statutes of limitations and that a recommendation to\npre-empt the latter did not necessarily include the former.\nFor immediately it went on to state: \u201cThe Recommenda\u00ad\ntion is intended also to cover the repeal of the statutes of\nrepose which, in a number of states[,] have the same effect\nas some statutes of limitation in barring [a] plaintiff \u2019s\nclaim before he knows that he has one.\u201d Ibid. The schol\u00ad\nars and professionals who were discussing this matter\n(and indeed were advising Congress) knew of a clear dis\u00ad\ntinction between the two.\n   The Report clearly urged the repeal of statutes of repose\nas well as statutes of limitations. But in so doing the\nReport did what the statute does not: It referred to stat\u00ad\nutes of repose as a distinct category. And when Congress\ndid not make the same distinction, it is proper to conclude\nthat Congress did not exercise the full scope of its pre\u00ad\nemption power.\n   While the use of the term \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d in\n\u00a79658 is not dispositive, the Court\u2019s textual inquiry does\nnot end there, for other features of the statutory text\nfurther support the exclusion of statutes of repose. The\ntext of \u00a79658 includes language describing the covered\nperiod in the singular. The statute uses the terms \u201cthe\napplicable limitations period,\u201d \u201csuch period shall com\u00ad\nmence,\u201d and \u201cthe statute of limitations established under\nState law.\u201d This would be an awkward way to mandate\nthe pre-emption of two different time periods with two\ndifferent purposes.\n   True, the Dictionary Act states that \u201cwords importing\nthe singular include and apply to several persons, parties,\nor things\u201d unless \u201cthe context indicates otherwise.\u201d 1\n14               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. \u00a71. But the Court has relied on this directive\nwhen the rule is \u201c \u2018necessary to carry out the evident intent\nof the statute.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415,\n422, n. 5 (2009) (quoting First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v.\nMissouri, 263 U. S. 640, 657 (1924)). As discussed, the\ncontext here shows an evident intent not to cover statutes\nof repose.\n   Further, to return again to the definition of the \u201cappli\u00ad\ncable limitations period,\u201d the statute describes it as \u201cthe\nperiod\u201d during which a \u201ccivil action\u201d under state law \u201cmay\nbe brought.\u201d \u00a79658(b)(2). It is true that in a literal sense\na statute of repose limits the time during which a suit\n\u201cmay be brought\u201d because it provides a point after which a\nsuit cannot be brought. Ibid.; see C. J. S. \u00a77, at 24 (\u201cA\nstatute of repose . . . limits the time within which an\naction may be brought\u201d). But the definition of the \u201cappli\u00ad\ncable limitations period\u201d presupposes that \u201ca [covered]\ncivil action\u201d exists. \u00a79658(b)(2). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\ndefines a \u201ccivil action\u201d as identical to an \u201caction at law,\u201d\nwhich in relevant part is defined as a \u201ccivil suit stating a\nlegal cause of action.\u201d Black\u2019s 32\u201333, 279 (9th ed. 2009);\nsee also id., at 222 (5th ed. 1979).\n   A statute of repose, however, as noted above, \u201cis not\nrelated to the accrual of any cause of action.\u201d C. J. S. \u00a77,\nat 24. Rather, it mandates that there shall be no cause of\naction beyond a certain point, even if no cause of action\nhas yet accrued. Thus, a statute of repose can prohibit a\ncause of action from coming into existence. See, e.g., N. C.\nGen. Stat. Ann. \u00a71\u201352(16) (\u201c[N]o cause of action shall\naccrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of\nthe defendant giving rise to the cause of action\u201d); see also\nHargett v. Holland, 337 N. C. 651, 654\u2013655, 447 S.

S. ____ (2014)             15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhas no cause of action\u201d (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted)); Lamb v. Wedgewood South Corp., 308 N. C. 419,\n440\u2013441, 302 S. E. 2d 868, 880 (1983). A statute of repose\ncan be said to define the scope of the cause of action, and\ntherefore the liability of the defendant. See Hargett,\nsupra, at 655\u2013656, 447 S. E. 2d, at 788.\n   In light of the distinct purpose for statutes of repose, the\ndefinition of \u201capplicable limitations period\u201d (and thus also\nthe definition of \u201ccommencement date\u201d) in \u00a79658(b)(2) is\nbest read to encompass only statutes of limitations, which\ngenerally begin to run after a cause of action accrues and\nso always limit the time in which a civil action \u201cmay be\nbrought.\u201d A statute of repose, however, may preclude an\nalleged tortfeasor\u2019s liability before a plaintiff is entitled to\nsue, before an actionable harm ever occurs.\n   Another and altogether unambiguous textual indication\nthat \u00a79658 does not pre-empt statutes of repose is that\n\u00a79658 provides for equitable tolling for \u201cminor or incompe\u00ad\ntent plaintiff[s].\u201d \u00a79658(b)(4)(B). As noted in the preced\u00ad\ning discussion, a \u201ccritical distinction\u201d between statutes of\nlimitations and statutes of repose \u201cis that a repose period\nis fixed and its expiration will not be delayed by estoppel\nor tolling.\u201d 4 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a71056, at 240. As a consequence, the inclusion of a tolling\nrule in \u00a79658 suggests that the statute\u2019s reach is limited to\nstatutes of limitations, which traditionally have been\nsubject to tolling. It would be odd for Congress, if it did\nseek to pre-empt statutes of repose, to pre-empt not just\nthe commencement date of statutes of repose but also\nstate law prohibiting tolling of statutes of repose\u2014all\nwithout an express indication that \u00a79658 was intended to\nreach the latter.\n   In addition to their argument that \u00a79658 expressly pre\u00ad\nempts statutes of repose, respondents contend that \u00a79658\neffects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose\n\u201ccreat[e] an unacceptable \u2018obstacle to the accomplishment\n16               CTS CORP. v.

Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563\u2013564 (2009)\n(quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)).\nRespondents argue that pre-emption of statutes of repose\nadvances \u00a79658\u2019s purpose, namely to help plaintiffs bring\ntort actions for harm caused by toxic contaminants.\n  But the level of generality at which the statute\u2019s pur\u00ad\npose is framed affects the judgment whether a specific\nreading will further or hinder that purpose. CERCLA, it\nmust be remembered, does not provide a complete reme-\ndial framework. The statute does not provide a general\ncause of action for all harm caused by toxic contaminants.\nSection 9658 leaves untouched States\u2019 judgments about\ncauses of action, the scope of liability, the duration of the\nperiod provided by statutes of limitations, burdens of\nproof, rules of evidence, and other important rules govern\u00ad\ning civil actions. \u201c \u2018The case for federal pre-emption is\nparticularly weak where Congress has indicated its\nawareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal\ninterest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both\nconcepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] be\u00ad\ntween them.\u2019 \u201d Wyeth, supra, at 574\u2013575 (quoting Bonito\nBoats v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 166\u2013167\n(1989)). Respondents have not shown that in light of\nCongress\u2019 decision to leave those many areas of state law\nuntouched, statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obsta\u00ad\ncle to the attainment of CERCLA\u2019s purposes.\n                            D\n   Under a proper interpretation of \u00a79658, statutes of\nrepose are not within Congress\u2019 pre-emption mandate.\nAlthough the natural reading of \u00a79658\u2019s text is that stat\u00ad\nutes of repose are excluded, the Court finds additional\nsupport for its conclusion in well-established \u201cpresump\u00ad\ntions about the nature of pre-emption.\u201d Medtronic, Inc. v.\nLohr, 518 U.

I agree. But as I see it, the later \u201cfederally required\ncommencement date,\u201d \u00a79658(a)(1), (b)(4), displaces the\nearlier date state law prescribes.\n   Section 9658(b)(3) defines \u201ccommencement date\u201d as \u201cthe\ndate specified in a statute of limitations as the beginning\nof the applicable limitations period.\u201d Under North Caro-\nlina law, that date is determined by the occurrence of\n\u201cthe last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to\nthe [claim].\u201d N.

See ante, at 5\u201316. Yet\nNorth Carolina itself made its repose period a component\nof the statute prescribing periods for \u201cthe commencement\nof actions.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71\u201346, 1\u201352(16). What is a repose period, in\nessence, other than a limitations period unattended by a\ndiscovery rule? See Senate Committee on Environment\nand Public Works, Superfund Section 301(e) Study Group,\nInjuries and Damages from Hazardous Wastes\u2014Analysis\nand Improvement of Legal Remedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess.,\n(pt. 1) 255\u2013256 (Comm. Print 1982) (hereinafter Study\nGroup Report).\n   The legislative history of \u00a79658, moreover, shows why\nthe distinction the Court draws between statutes of limita-\ntions and repose prescriptions cannot be what Congress\nordered. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 2\u20133, Congress\namended CERCLA to include \u00a79658 in response to the\nreport of an expert Study Group commissioned when\nCERCLA was enacted. That report directed its proposals\nto the States rather than to Congress. It \u201crecommend[ed]\nthat the several states enhance and develop common law\nand statutory remedies, and that they remove unreasona-\nble procedural and other barriers to recovery in court\naction for personal injuries resulting from exposure to\nhazardous waste.\u201d Study Group Report 255. The report\nthen made specific proposals. Under the heading \u201cStat-\nutes of Limitations,\u201d the Study Group proposed (1) \u201cthat\nall [S]tates . . . clearly adopt the rule that an action ac-\ncrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discov-\nered the injury or disease and its cause\u201d and (2) that\nStates repeal \u201cstatutes of repose which, in a number of\n[S]tates have the same effect as some statutes of limita-\ntion in barring plaintiff \u2019s claim before he knows he has\none.\u201d Id., at 255\u2013256. Both measures are necessary, the\nreport explained, because \u201cmany of the hazardous wastes\nare carcinogens\u201d with \u201clatency period[s] for the appearance\n4                   CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nof injury or disease . . . likely to [run] for thirty years or\nmore.\u201d Id., at 255.\n  Beyond question, a repose period, like the 10-year period\nat issue here, will prevent recovery for injuries with la-\ntency periods running for decades. Thus, altering statutes\nof limitations to include a discovery rule would be of little\nuse in States with repose prescriptions.\n  Rather than await action by the States, Congress decid-\ned to implement the Study Group\u2019s proposal itself by\nadopting \u00a79658. Ante, at 3. The Conference Report re-\nlates the Study Group Report\u2019s observation that \u201ccertain\nState statutes deprive plaintiffs of their day in court\u201d\nbecause \u201c[i]n the case of a long-latency disease, such as\ncancer,\u201d a limitations period that begins to run before the\nplaintiff has discovered her injury frequently will make\ntimely suit impossible. Conference Report 261. The Con-\nference Report then states that \u201c[t]his section\u201d\u2014\u00a79658\u2014\n\u201caddresses the problem identified in the [Study Group\nReport].\u201d Ibid. As the Study Group Report makes clear,\n\u201cthe problem\u201d it identified, to which the Conference Report\nadverted, cannot be solved when statutes of repose remain\noperative. The Court\u2019s interpretation thus thwarts Con-\ngress\u2019 clearly expressed intent to fix \u201cthe problem\u201d the\nStudy Group described.\n  In lieu of uniform application of the \u201cfederally required\ncommencement date,\u201d \u00a79658(b)(4), the Court allows those\nresponsible for environmental contamination, if they are\nlocated in the still small number of States with repose\nperiods,* to escape liability for the devastating harm they\ncause, harm hidden from detection for more than 10 years.\nInstead of encouraging prompt identification and remedia-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * See Conn.

Argued April 23, 2014\u2014Decided June 9, 2014\nFederal law pre-empts state-law statutes of limitations in certain tort\n  actions involving personal injury or property damage arising from the\n  release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the\n  environment. 42 U. S. C. \u00a79658. Petitioner CTS Corporation sold\n  property on which it had stored chemicals as part its operations as an\n  electronics plant. Twenty-four years later, respondents, the owners\n  of portions of that property and adjacent landowners, sued, alleging\n  damages from the stored contaminants. CTS moved to dismiss, cit-\n  ing a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to\n  a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the defendant\u2019s last cul-\n  pable act. Because CTS\u2019s last act occurred when it sold the property,\n  the District Court granted the motion. Finding \u00a79658 ambiguous, the\n  Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the statute\u2019s remedial purpose\n  favored pre-emption.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed.\n723 F. 3d 434, reversed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  all but Part II\u2013D, concluding that \u00a79658 does not pre-empt state\n  statutes of repose. Pp. 5\u201316.\n     (a) The outcome here turns on whether \u00a79658 distinguishes be-\n  tween statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, which are both\n  used to limit the temporal extent or duration of tort liability. There\n  is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two,\n  but their specified time periods are measured differently and they\n  seek to attain different purposes and objectives. Statutes of limita-\n  tions are designed to promote justice by encouraging plaintiffs to pur-\n  sue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues. Stat-\n2                      CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    utes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should\n    be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time\n    and are measured from the date of the defendant\u2019s last culpable act\n    or omission. The application of equitable tolling underscores their\n    difference in purpose. Because a statute of limitations\u2019 purpose is not\n    furthered by barring an untimely action brought by a plaintiff who\n    was prevented by extraordinary circumstances from timely filing, eq-\n    uitable tolling operates to pause the running of the statute. The pur-\n    pose of statutes of repose are unaffected by such circumstances, and\n    equitable tolling does not apply. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) The text and structure of \u00a79658 resolve this case. Under that\n    provision, pre-emption is characterized as an \u201c[e]xception,\u201d\n    \u00a79658(a)(1), to the regular rule that the \u201cthe statute of limitations es-\n    tablished under State law\u201d applies. The \u201capplicable limitations peri-\n    od,\u201d the \u201ccommencement date\u201d of which is subject to pre-emption, is\n    defined as \u201cthe period specified in a statute of limitations.\u201d\n    \u00a79658(b)(2). That term appears four times, and \u201cstatute of repose\u201d\n    does not appear at all. While it is apparent from the historical devel-\n    opment of the two terms that their general usage has not always\n    been precise, their distinction was well enough established to be re-\n    flected in the 1982 Study Group Report that guided \u00a79658\u2019s enact-\n    ment, acknowledged the distinction, and urged the repeal of both\n    types of statutes. Because that distinction is not similarly reflected\n    in \u00a79658, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not intend to pre-\n    empt statutes of repose.\n       Other textual features further support this conclusion. It would be\n    awkward to use the singular \u201capplicable limitations period\u201d to man-\n    date pre-emption of two different time periods with two different\n    purposes. And the definition of that limitations period as \u201cthe peri-\n    od\u201d during which a \u201ccivil action\u201d under state law \u201cmay be brought,\u201d\n    \u00a79658(b)(2), presupposes that a civil action exists. A statute of re-\n    pose, in contrast, can prohibit a cause of action from ever coming into\n    existence. Section 9658\u2019s inclusion of a tolling rule also suggests that\n    the statute\u2019s reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which tradi-\n    tionally have been subject to tolling. Respondents contend that\n    \u00a79658 also effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose\n    create an obstacle to Congress\u2019 purposes and objectives, see Wyeth v.\n    Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563\u2013564. But the level of generality at which\n    the statute\u2019s purpose is framed affects whether a specific reading will\n    further or hinder that purpose. Here, where Congress chose to leave\n    many areas of state law untouched, respondents have not shown that\n    statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of\n    statutory purposes.

Section 9658 applies to statutes of limitations\ngoverning actions for personal injury or property damage\narising from the release of a hazardous substance, pollu\u00ad\ntant, or contaminant into the environment.\n  Section 9658 adopts what is known as the discovery\nrule. Under this framework, statutes of limitations in\ncovered actions begin to run when a plaintiff discovers, or\nreasonably should have discovered, that the harm in\nquestion was caused by the contaminant. A person who is\nexposed to a toxic contaminant may not develop or show\nsigns of resulting injury for many years, and so Congress\nenacted \u00a79658 out of concern for long latency periods.\n  It is undoubted that the discovery rule in \u00a79658 pre\u00ad\nempts state statutes of limitations that are in conflict with\n2               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits terms. The question presented in this case is whether\n\u00a79658 also pre-empts state statutes of repose.\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit held that \u00a79658 does pre-empt statutes of repose.\nThat holding was in error, and, for the reasons that follow,\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.\n                             I\n  Congress enacted CERCLA in 1980 \u201cto promote \u2018 \u201cthe\ntimely cleanup of hazardous waste sites\u201d \u2019 and to ensure\nthat the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those\nresponsible for the contamination.\u201d Burlington N. & S. F.\nR. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. 599, 602 (2009) (quoting\nConsolidated Edison Co. of New York v. UGI Utilities, Inc.,\n423 F. 3d 90, 94 (CA2 2005)). The Act provided a federal\ncause of action to recover costs of cleanup from culpable\nentities but not a federal cause of action for personal\ninjury or property damage. Instead, CERCLA directed\npreparation of an expert report to determine \u201cthe ade-\nquacy of existing common law and statutory remedies in\nproviding legal redress for harm to man and the environ\u00ad\nment caused by the release of hazardous substances into\nthe environment,\u201d including \u201cbarriers to recovery posed by\nexisting statutes of limitations.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79651(e)(1),\n(3)(F).\n  The 1982 report resulting from that statutory directive\nproposed certain changes to state tort law. Senate Com\u00ad\nmittee on Environment and Public Works, Superfund\nSection 301(e) Study Group, Injuries and Damages from\nHazardous Wastes\u2014Analysis and Improvement of Legal\nRemedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (Comm. Print 1982) (here\u00ad\ninafter Study Group Report or Report). As relevant here,\nthe Study Group Report noted the long latency periods\ninvolved in harm caused by toxic substances and \u201crecom\u00ad\nmend[ed] that all states that have not already done so,\nclearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

The Report\nfurther stated: \u201cThe Recommendation is intended also to\ncover the repeal of the statutes of repose which, in a num\u00ad\nber of states[,] have the same effect as some statutes of\nlimitation in barring [a] plaintiff \u2019s claim before he knows\nthat he has one.\u201d Ibid.\n   Congress did not wait long for States to respond to some\nor all of the Report\u2019s recommendations. Instead, Congress\ndecided to act at the federal level. Congress amended\nCERCLA in 1986 to add the provision now codified in\n\u00a79658. Whether \u00a79658 repeals statutes of repose, as the\nStudy Group Report recommended, is the question to be\naddressed here.\n   The instant case arose in North Carolina, where CTS\nCorporation ran an electronics plant in Asheville from\n1959 to 1985. (A subsidiary, CTS of Asheville, Inc., ran\nthe plant until 1983, when CTS Corporation took over.)\nThe plant manufactured and disposed of electronics and\nelectronic parts. In the process, it stored the chemicals\ntrichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-1, 2-dichloroethane (DCE).\nIn 1987, CTS sold the property, along with a promise that\nthe site was environmentally sound. The buyer eventually\nsold portions of the property to individuals who, along\nwith adjacent landowners, brought this suit alleging dam\u00ad\nage from contaminants on the land. Those who alleged\nthe injury and damage were the plaintiffs in the trial court\nand are respondents here.\n   Their suit was brought in 2011, 24 years after CTS sold\nthe property. The suit, filed in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of North Carolina, was a\nstate-law nuisance action against CTS, petitioner here.\nRespondents sought \u201creclamation\u201d of \u201ctoxic chemical con\u00ad\ntaminants\u201d belonging to petitioner, \u201cremediation of the\nenvironmental harm caused\u201d by contaminants, and \u201cmone\u00ad\ntary damages in an amount that will fully compensate\n4                CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthem for all the losses and damages they have suffered,\n. . . and will suffer in the future.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n57a. Respondents claim that in 2009 they learned from\nthe Environmental Protection Agency that their well\nwater was contaminated, allegedly while petitioner oper\u00ad\nated its electronics plant.\n    Citing North Carolina\u2019s statute of repose, CTS moved to\ndismiss the claim. That statute prevents subjecting a\ndefendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after\nthe last culpable act of the defendant. N. C. Gen. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a71\u201352(16) (Lexis 2013) (\u201c[N]o cause of action shall\naccrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of\nthe defendant giving rise to the cause of action\u201d); Robinson\nv.

E. 2d 539, 541\n(2012) (referring to the provision as a \u201cstatute of repose\u201d).\nBecause CTS\u2019 last act occurred in 1987, when it sold the\nelectronics plant, the District Court accepted the recom\u00ad\nmendation of a Magistrate Judge and granted CTS\u2019 motion\nto dismiss.\n    A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit reversed, ruling that \u00a79658 pre-empted the statute\nof repose. 723 F. 3d 434 (2013). The majority found \u00a79658\n\u201cambiguous,\u201d but also found that the interpretation in\nfavor of pre-emption was preferable because of CERCLA\u2019s\nremedial purpose. Id., at 443\u2013444.\n    Judge Thacker dissented. Id., at 445\u2013454. She found\nthe statutory text\u2019s exclusion of statutes of repose to be\n\u201cplain and unambiguous.\u201d Id., at 445. She further indi\u00ad\ncated that, even \u201cif the preemptive effect of \u00a79658 were\nsusceptible to two interpretations, a presumption against\npreemption would counsel that we should limit \u00a79658\u2019s\npreemptive reach to statutes of limitations without also\nextending it to statutes of repose.\u201d Ibid.\n    The Courts of Appeals, as well as the Supreme Court of\nSouth Dakota, have rendered conflicting judgments on\nthis question.

Statutes of limitations and stat\u00ad\nutes of repose both are mechanisms used to limit the\ntemporal extent or duration of liability for tortious acts.\nBoth types of statute can operate to bar a plaintiff \u2019s suit,\nand in each instance time is the controlling factor. There\nis considerable common ground in the policies underlying\nthe two types of statute. But the time periods specified\nare measured from different points, and the statutes seek\nto attain different purposes and objectives. And, as will be\nexplained, \u00a79658 mandates a distinction between the two.\n   In the ordinary course, a statute of limitations creates \u201ca\ntime limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when\nthe claim accrued.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1546 (9th ed.\n2009) (Black\u2019s); see also Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life &\nAccident Ins. Co., 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4)\n(\u201cAs a general matter, a statute of limitations begins to\nrun when the cause of action \u2018 \u201caccrues\u201d \u2019\u2014that is, when\n\u2018the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief \u2019 \u201d (quoting Bay\nArea Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v.\nFerbar Corp. of Cal., Inc., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997))).\nMeasured by this standard, a claim accrues in a personal\u00ad\ninjury or property-damage action \u201cwhen the injury oc\u00ad\ncurred or was discovered.\u201d Black\u2019s 1546. For example,\nNorth Carolina, whose laws are central to this case, has a\nstatute of limitations that allows a person three years to\nbring suit for personal injury or property damage, begin\u00ad\n6                CTS CORP. v.

C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a71\u2013\n52(16).\n   A statute of repose, on the other hand, puts an outer\nlimit on the right to bring a civil action. That limit is\nmeasured not from the date on which the claim accrues\nbut instead from the date of the last culpable act or omis\u00ad\nsion of the defendant. A statute of repose \u201cbar[s] any suit\nthat is brought after a specified time since the defendant\nacted (such as by designing or manufacturing a product),\neven if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a\nresulting injury.\u201d Black\u2019s 1546. The statute of repose\nlimit is \u201cnot related to the accrual of any cause of action;\nthe injury need not have occurred, much less have been\ndiscovered.\u201d 54 C. J. S., Limitations of Actions \u00a77, p. 24\n(2010) (hereinafter C. J. S.). The repose provision is there\u00ad\nfore equivalent to \u201ca cutoff,\u201d Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,\nPrupis & Petigrow v.

S. \u00a77, at 24.\n   Although there is substantial overlap between the poli\u00ad\ncies of the two types of statute, each has a distinct purpose\nand each is targeted at a different actor. Statutes of limi\u00ad\ntations require plaintiffs to pursue \u201cdiligent prosecution of\nknown claims.\u201d Black\u2019s 1546. Statutes of limitations\n\u201cpromote justice by preventing surprises through [plain\u00ad\ntiffs\u2019] revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber\nuntil evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and\nwitnesses have disappeared.\u201d Railroad Telegraphers v.\nRailway Express Agency, Inc., 321 U. S. 342, 348\u2013349\n(1944). Statutes of repose also encourage plaintiffs to\nbring actions in a timely manner, and for many of the\nsame reasons.

Like a\ndischarge in bankruptcy, a statute of repose can be said to\nprovide a fresh start or freedom from liability. Indeed, the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause has been described as \u201ca statute\nof repose\u201d because it in part embodies the idea that at\nsome point a defendant should be able to put past events\nbehind him. Jones v. Thomas, 491 U. S. 376, 392 (1989)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   One central distinction between statutes of limitations\nand statutes of repose underscores their differing purposes.\nStatutes of limitations, but not statutes of repose, are\nsubject to equitable tolling, a doctrine that \u201cpauses the\nrunning of, or \u2018tolls,\u2019 a statute of limitations when a liti\u00ad\ngant has pursued his rights diligently but some extraordi\u00ad\nnary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely\naction.\u201d Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U. S. 1, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 7). Statutes of repose, on the other\nhand, generally may not be tolled, even in cases of ex\u00ad\ntraordinary circumstances beyond a plaintiff \u2019s control.\nSee, e.g., Lampf, supra, at 363 (\u201c[A] period of repose [is]\ninconsistent with tolling\u201d); 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal\nPractice and Procedure \u00a71056, p. 240 (3d ed. 2002) (\u201c[A]\ncritical distinction is that a repose period is fixed and its\nexpiration will not be delayed by estoppel or tolling\u201d);\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7899, Comment g (1977).\n   Equitable tolling is applicable to statutes of limitations\nbecause their main thrust is to encourage the plaintiff to\n\u201cpursu[e] his rights diligently,\u201d and when an \u201cextraordi\u00ad\nnary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely\naction,\u201d the restriction imposed by the statute of limita\u00ad\n8                  CTS CORP. v.

But a statute of repose is a\njudgment that defendants should \u201cbe free from liability\nafter the legislatively determined period of time, beyond\nwhich the liability will no longer exist and will not be\ntolled for any reason.\u201d C. J. S. \u00a77, at 24. As an illustrative\nexample, under North Carolina law statutes of limitations\nmay be tolled but statutes of repose may not. See, e.g.,\nMonson v. Paramount Homes, Inc., 133 N.

The Court of\nAppeals was in error when it treated this as a substitute\nfor a conclusion grounded in the statute\u2019s text and struc\u00ad\nture. After all, almost every statute might be described as\nremedial in the sense that all statutes are designed to\nremedy some problem. And even if the Court identified\nsome subset of statutes as especially remedial, the Court\nhas emphasized that \u201cno legislation pursues its purposes\nat all costs.\u201d Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522,\n525\u2013526 (1987) (per curiam). Congressional intent is\ndiscerned primarily from the statutory text. In any event,\nwere the Court to adopt a presumption to help resolve\nambiguity, substantial support also exists for the proposi\u00ad\ntion that \u201cthe States\u2019 coordinate role in government coun\u00ad\nsels against reading\u201d federal laws such as \u00a79658 \u201cto re\u00ad\nstrict the States\u2019 sovereign capacity to regulate\u201d in areas of\ntraditional state concern. FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health\nSystem, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 18).\n   Turning to the statutory text, the Court notes first that\n\u00a79658, in the caption of subsection (a), characterizes pre\u00ad\nemption as an \u201c[e]xception\u201d to the regular rule.\n\u00a79658(a)(1). Section 9658 contains another subsection,\nwith the heading \u201cState law generally applicable,\u201d that\nprovides the rule that \u201cthe statute of limitations estab\u00ad\nlished under State law shall apply.\u201d \u00a79658(a)(2). Under\nthis structure, state law is not pre-empted unless it fits\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninto the precise terms of the exception.\n   The statute defines the \u201capplicable limitations period,\u201d\nthe \u201ccommencement date\u201d of which is subject to pre\u00ad\nemption, as a period specified in \u201ca statute of limitations.\u201d\n\u00a79658(b)(2). Indeed, \u00a79658 uses the term \u201cstatute of limi\u00ad\ntations\u201d four times (not including the caption), but not the\nterm \u201cstatute of repose.\u201d This is instructive, but it is not\ndispositive. While the term \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d has\nacquired a precise meaning, distinct from \u201cstatute of\nrepose,\u201d and while that is its primary meaning, it must be\nacknowledged that the term \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d is\nsometimes used in a less formal way. In that sense, it can\nrefer to any provision restricting the time in which a\nplaintiff must bring suit. See Black\u2019s 1546; see also Ernst\n& Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 210 (1976). Con\u00ad\ngress has used the term \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d when\nenacting statutes of repose. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u2013\n6(h)(1)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) (2012 ed.) (creating a statute of repose\nand placing it in a provision entitled \u201cStatute of limita\u00ad\ntions\u201d); 42 U. S. C. \u00a72278 (same). And petitioner does not\npoint out an example in which Congress has used the term\n\u201cstatute of repose.\u201d So the Court must proceed to examine\nother evidence of the meaning of the term \u201cstatute of\nlimitations\u201d as it is used in \u00a79658. The parties debate the\nhistorical development of the terms \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d\nand \u201cstatute of repose\u201d in an effort to show how these\nterms were likely understood in 1986, when Congress\nenacted \u00a79658. It is apparent that the distinction between\nstatutes of limitations and statutes of repose was under\u00ad\nstood by some courts and scholars before 1986.

One scholar, writing in 1981,\ndescribed multiple usages of the terms, including both a\nusage in which the terms are equivalent and also the\nmodern, more precise usage. McGovern, The Variety,\nPolicy and Constitutionality of Product Liability Statutes\nof Repose, 30 Am. U. L. Rev. 579, 584 (1981) (describing a\nstatute of repose as \u201cdistinct from a statute of limitation\nbecause [a statute of repose] begins to run at a time unre\u00ad\nlated to the traditional accrual of the cause of action\u201d).\n   Respondents note that an entry in Black\u2019s Law Diction\u00ad\nary from 1979 describes a statute of limitations as follows:\n\u201cStatutes of limitations are statutes of repose.\u201d Black\u2019s\n835 (5th ed.). That statement likely reflects an earlier,\nbroader usage in which the term \u201cstatute of repose\u201d re\u00ad\nferred to all provisions delineating the time in which a\nplaintiff must bring suit. See, e.g., Pillow v. Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 477 (1852) (\u201cStatutes of limitation . . . are stat\u00ad\nutes of repose, and should not be evaded by a forced con\u00ad\nstruction\u201d); Rosenberg v. North Bergen, 61 N. J. 190, 201,\n293 A. 2d 662, 667 (1972) (\u201cAll statutes limiting in any\nway the time within which a judicial remedy may be\nsought are statutes of repose\u201d); Black\u2019s 1077 (rev. 4th ed.\n1968) (defining \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d as \u201c[a] statute . . .\ndeclaring that no suit shall be maintained . . . unless\nbrought within a specified period after the right accrued.\nStatutes of limitation are statutes of repose\u201d); Ballentine\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1233 (2d ed. 1948) (similar). That usage\ndoes not necessarily support respondents\u2019 interpretation,\nbecause the broad usage of the term \u201cstatute of repose\u201d\ndoes not mean that the term \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d must\nrefer to both types of statute.\n   From all this, it is apparent that general usage of the\nlegal terms has not always been precise, but the concept\nthat statutes of repose and statutes of limitations are\ndistinct was well enough established to be reflected in the\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

In\none of its recommendations, the Study Group Report\ncalled on States to adopt the discovery rule now embodied\nin \u00a79658. Study Group Report, pt. 1, at 256. The Report\nacknowledged that statutes of repose were not equivalent\nto statutes of limitations and that a recommendation to\npre-empt the latter did not necessarily include the former.\nFor immediately it went on to state: \u201cThe Recommenda\u00ad\ntion is intended also to cover the repeal of the statutes of\nrepose which, in a number of states[,] have the same effect\nas some statutes of limitation in barring [a] plaintiff \u2019s\nclaim before he knows that he has one.\u201d Ibid. The schol\u00ad\nars and professionals who were discussing this matter\n(and indeed were advising Congress) knew of a clear dis\u00ad\ntinction between the two.\n   The Report clearly urged the repeal of statutes of repose\nas well as statutes of limitations. But in so doing the\nReport did what the statute does not: It referred to stat\u00ad\nutes of repose as a distinct category. And when Congress\ndid not make the same distinction, it is proper to conclude\nthat Congress did not exercise the full scope of its pre\u00ad\nemption power.\n   While the use of the term \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d in\n\u00a79658 is not dispositive, the Court\u2019s textual inquiry does\nnot end there, for other features of the statutory text\nfurther support the exclusion of statutes of repose. The\ntext of \u00a79658 includes language describing the covered\nperiod in the singular. The statute uses the terms \u201cthe\napplicable limitations period,\u201d \u201csuch period shall com\u00ad\nmence,\u201d and \u201cthe statute of limitations established under\nState law.\u201d This would be an awkward way to mandate\nthe pre-emption of two different time periods with two\ndifferent purposes.\n   True, the Dictionary Act states that \u201cwords importing\nthe singular include and apply to several persons, parties,\nor things\u201d unless \u201cthe context indicates otherwise.\u201d 1\n14               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. \u00a71. But the Court has relied on this directive\nwhen the rule is \u201c \u2018necessary to carry out the evident intent\nof the statute.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415,\n422, n. 5 (2009) (quoting First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v.\nMissouri, 263 U. S. 640, 657 (1924)). As discussed, the\ncontext here shows an evident intent not to cover statutes\nof repose.\n   Further, to return again to the definition of the \u201cappli\u00ad\ncable limitations period,\u201d the statute describes it as \u201cthe\nperiod\u201d during which a \u201ccivil action\u201d under state law \u201cmay\nbe brought.\u201d \u00a79658(b)(2). It is true that in a literal sense\na statute of repose limits the time during which a suit\n\u201cmay be brought\u201d because it provides a point after which a\nsuit cannot be brought. Ibid.; see C. J. S. \u00a77, at 24 (\u201cA\nstatute of repose . . . limits the time within which an\naction may be brought\u201d). But the definition of the \u201cappli\u00ad\ncable limitations period\u201d presupposes that \u201ca [covered]\ncivil action\u201d exists. \u00a79658(b)(2). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\ndefines a \u201ccivil action\u201d as identical to an \u201caction at law,\u201d\nwhich in relevant part is defined as a \u201ccivil suit stating a\nlegal cause of action.\u201d Black\u2019s 32\u201333, 279 (9th ed. 2009);\nsee also id., at 222 (5th ed. 1979).\n   A statute of repose, however, as noted above, \u201cis not\nrelated to the accrual of any cause of action.\u201d C. J. S. \u00a77,\nat 24. Rather, it mandates that there shall be no cause of\naction beyond a certain point, even if no cause of action\nhas yet accrued. Thus, a statute of repose can prohibit a\ncause of action from coming into existence. See, e.g., N. C.\nGen. Stat. Ann. \u00a71\u201352(16) (\u201c[N]o cause of action shall\naccrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of\nthe defendant giving rise to the cause of action\u201d); see also\nHargett v. Holland, 337 N. C. 651, 654\u2013655, 447 S. E. 2d\n784, 787 (1994) (\u201cA statute of repose creates an additional\nelement of the claim itself which must be satisfied in order\nfor the claim to be maintained . . . . If the action is not\nbrought within the specified period, the plaintiff literally\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhas no cause of action\u201d (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted)); Lamb v. Wedgewood South Corp., 308 N. C. 419,\n440\u2013441, 302 S. E. 2d 868, 880 (1983). A statute of repose\ncan be said to define the scope of the cause of action, and\ntherefore the liability of the defendant. See Hargett,\nsupra, at 655\u2013656, 447 S. E. 2d, at 788.\n   In light of the distinct purpose for statutes of repose, the\ndefinition of \u201capplicable limitations period\u201d (and thus also\nthe definition of \u201ccommencement date\u201d) in \u00a79658(b)(2) is\nbest read to encompass only statutes of limitations, which\ngenerally begin to run after a cause of action accrues and\nso always limit the time in which a civil action \u201cmay be\nbrought.\u201d A statute of repose, however, may preclude an\nalleged tortfeasor\u2019s liability before a plaintiff is entitled to\nsue, before an actionable harm ever occurs.\n   Another and altogether unambiguous textual indication\nthat \u00a79658 does not pre-empt statutes of repose is that\n\u00a79658 provides for equitable tolling for \u201cminor or incompe\u00ad\ntent plaintiff[s].\u201d \u00a79658(b)(4)(B). As noted in the preced\u00ad\ning discussion, a \u201ccritical distinction\u201d between statutes of\nlimitations and statutes of repose \u201cis that a repose period\nis fixed and its expiration will not be delayed by estoppel\nor tolling.\u201d 4 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a71056, at 240. As a consequence, the inclusion of a tolling\nrule in \u00a79658 suggests that the statute\u2019s reach is limited to\nstatutes of limitations, which traditionally have been\nsubject to tolling. It would be odd for Congress, if it did\nseek to pre-empt statutes of repose, to pre-empt not just\nthe commencement date of statutes of repose but also\nstate law prohibiting tolling of statutes of repose\u2014all\nwithout an express indication that \u00a79658 was intended to\nreach the latter.\n   In addition to their argument that \u00a79658 expressly pre\u00ad\nempts statutes of repose, respondents contend that \u00a79658\neffects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose\n\u201ccreat[e] an unacceptable \u2018obstacle to the accomplishment\n16               CTS CORP. v.

Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563\u2013564 (2009)\n(quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)).\nRespondents argue that pre-emption of statutes of repose\nadvances \u00a79658\u2019s purpose, namely to help plaintiffs bring\ntort actions for harm caused by toxic contaminants.\n  But the level of generality at which the statute\u2019s pur\u00ad\npose is framed affects the judgment whether a specific\nreading will further or hinder that purpose. CERCLA, it\nmust be remembered, does not provide a complete reme-\ndial framework. The statute does not provide a general\ncause of action for all harm caused by toxic contaminants.\nSection 9658 leaves untouched States\u2019 judgments about\ncauses of action, the scope of liability, the duration of the\nperiod provided by statutes of limitations, burdens of\nproof, rules of evidence, and other important rules govern\u00ad\ning civil actions. \u201c \u2018The case for federal pre-emption is\nparticularly weak where Congress has indicated its\nawareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal\ninterest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both\nconcepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] be\u00ad\ntween them.\u2019 \u201d Wyeth, supra, at 574\u2013575 (quoting Bonito\nBoats v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 166\u2013167\n(1989)). Respondents have not shown that in light of\nCongress\u2019 decision to leave those many areas of state law\nuntouched, statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obsta\u00ad\ncle to the attainment of CERCLA\u2019s purposes.\n                            D\n   Under a proper interpretation of \u00a79658, statutes of\nrepose are not within Congress\u2019 pre-emption mandate.\nAlthough the natural reading of \u00a79658\u2019s text is that stat\u00ad\nutes of repose are excluded, the Court finds additional\nsupport for its conclusion in well-established \u201cpresump\u00ad\ntions about the nature of pre-emption.\u201d Medtronic, Inc. v.\nLohr, 518 U.

Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.

Good, 555 U. S. 70, 77 (2008) (quoting\nBates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U.

S., at 485.\n   The effect of that presumption is to support, where\nplausible, \u201ca narrow interpretation\u201d of an express pre\u00ad\nemption provision, ibid., especially \u201cwhen Congress has\nlegislated in a field traditionally occupied by the States,\u201d\nAltria, supra, at 77. The presumption has greatest force\nwhen Congress legislates in an area traditionally governed\nby the States\u2019 police powers.

Under the heading \u201cStat-\nutes of Limitations,\u201d the Study Group proposed (1) \u201cthat\nall [S]tates . . . clearly adopt the rule that an action ac-\ncrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discov-\nered the injury or disease and its cause\u201d and (2) that\nStates repeal \u201cstatutes of repose which, in a number of\n[S]tates have the same effect as some statutes of limita-\ntion in barring plaintiff \u2019s claim before he knows he has\none.\u201d Id., at 255\u2013256. Both measures are necessary, the\nreport explained, because \u201cmany of the hazardous wastes\nare carcinogens\u201d with \u201clatency period[s] for the appearance\n4                   CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nof injury or disease . . . likely to [run] for thirty years or\nmore.\u201d Id., at 255.\n  Beyond question, a repose period, like the 10-year period\nat issue here, will prevent recovery for injuries with la-\ntency periods running for decades. Thus, altering statutes\nof limitations to include a discovery rule would be of little\nuse in States with repose prescriptions.\n  Rather than await action by the States, Congress decid-\ned to implement the Study Group\u2019s proposal itself by\nadopting \u00a79658. Ante, at 3. The Conference Report re-\nlates the Study Group Report\u2019s observation that \u201ccertain\nState statutes deprive plaintiffs of their day in court\u201d\nbecause \u201c[i]n the case of a long-latency disease, such as\ncancer,\u201d a limitations period that begins to run before the\nplaintiff has discovered her injury frequently will make\ntimely suit impossible. Conference Report 261. The Con-\nference Report then states that \u201c[t]his section\u201d\u2014\u00a79658\u2014\n\u201caddresses the problem identified in the [Study Group\nReport].\u201d Ibid. As the Study Group Report makes clear,\n\u201cthe problem\u201d it identified, to which the Conference Report\nadverted, cannot be solved when statutes of repose remain\noperative. The Court\u2019s interpretation thus thwarts Con-\ngress\u2019 clearly expressed intent to fix \u201cthe problem\u201d the\nStudy Group described.\n  In lieu of uniform application of the \u201cfederally required\ncommencement date,\u201d \u00a79658(b)(4), the Court allows those\nresponsible for environmental contamination, if they are\nlocated in the still small number of States with repose\nperiods,* to escape liability for the devastating harm they\ncause, harm hidden from detection for more than 10 years.\nInstead of encouraging prompt identification and remedia-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * See Conn.
