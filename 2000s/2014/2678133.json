COCA-COLA CO.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 12\u2013761.      Argued April 21, 2014\u2014Decided June 12, 2014\nThis case involves the intersection of two federal statutes. The Lanham\n  Act permits one competitor to sue another for unfair competition aris-\n  ing from false or misleading product descriptions. 15 U. S. C. \u00a71125.\n  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) prohibits the mis-\n  branding of food and drink. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7321(f), 331. To implement\n  the FDCA\u2019s provisions, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has\n  promulgated regulations regarding food and beverage labeling, in-\n  cluding one concerning juice blends. Unlike the Lanham Act, which,\n  relies in large part for its enforcement on private suits brought by in-\n  jured competitors, the FDCA and its regulations give the United\n  States nearly exclusive enforcement authority and do not permit pri-\n  vate enforcement suits. The FDCA also pre-empts certain state mis-\n  branding laws.\n     Petitioner POM Wonderful LLC, which produces, markets, and\n  sells, inter alia, a pomegranate-blueberry juice blend, filed a Lanham\n  Act suit against respondent Coca-Cola Company, alleging that the\n  name, label, marketing, and advertising of one of Coca-Cola\u2019s juice\n  blends mislead consumers into believing the product consists predom-\n  inantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it in fact consists\n  predominantly of less expensive apple and grape juices, and that the\n  ensuing confusion causes POM to lose sales. The District Court\n  granted partial summary judgment to Coca-Cola, ruling that the\n  FDCA and its regulations preclude Lanham Act challenges to the\n  name and label of Coca-Cola\u2019s juice blend. The Ninth Circuit af-\n  firmed in relevant part.\nHeld: Competitors may bring Lanham Act claims like POM\u2019s challeng-\n ing food and beverage labels regulated by the FDCA. Pp. 7\u201317.\n    (a) This result is based on the following premises. First, this is not\n2             POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    a pre-emption case, for it does not raise the question whether state\n    law is pre-empted by a federal law, see Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n    555, 563, but instead concerns the alleged preclusion of a cause of ac-\n    tion under one federal statute by the provisions of another federal\n    statute. Pre-emption principles may nonetheless be instructive inso-\n    far as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws bearing on\n    the same subject. Second, this is a statutory interpretation case; and\n    analysis of the statutory text, aided by established interpretation\n    rules, controls. See Chickasaw Nation v. United States, 534 U. S. 84,\n    94. While a principle of interpretation may be countered \u201cby some\n    maxim pointing in a different direction,\u201d Circuit City Stores, Inc. v.\n    Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 115, this Court need not decide what maxim\n    establishes the proper framework here: Even assuming that Coca-\n    Cola is correct that the Court\u2019s task is to reconcile or harmonize the\n    statutes instead of to determine whether one statute is an implied\n    repeal in part of another statute, Coca-Cola is incorrect that the best\n    way to do that is to bar POM\u2019s Lanham Act claim. Pp. 7\u20139.\n       (b) Neither the Lanham Act nor the FDCA, in express terms, for-\n    bids or limits Lanham Act claims challenging labels that are regulat-\n    ed by the FDCA. The absence of such a textual provision when the\n    Lanham Act and the FDCA have coexisted for over 70 years is \u201cpow-\n    erful evidence that Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the\n    exclusive means\u201d of ensuring proper food and beverage labeling. See\n    Wyeth, supra, at 575. In addition, and contrary to Coca-Cola\u2019s argu-\n    ment, Congress, by taking care to pre-empt only some state laws, if\n    anything indicated it did not intend the FDCA to preclude require-\n    ments arising from other sources. See Setser v. United States, 566\n    U. S. ___, ___. The structures of the FDCA and the Lanham Act rein-\n    force this conclusion. Where two statutes are complementary, it\n    would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that Con-\n    gress intended one federal statute nonetheless to preclude the opera-\n    tion of the other. See J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred\n    Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 144. The Lanham Act and the FDCA com-\n    plement each other in major respects, for each has its own scope and\n    purpose. Both touch on food and beverage labeling, but the Lanham\n    Act protects commercial interests against unfair competition, while\n    the FDCA protects public health and safety. They also complement\n    each other with respect to remedies. The FDCA\u2019s enforcement is\n    largely committed to the FDA, while the Lanham Act empowers pri-\n    vate parties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a case-by-\n    case basis. Allowing Lanham Act suits takes advantage of synergies\n    among multiple methods of regulation. A holding that the FDCA\n    precludes Lanham Act claims challenging food and beverage labels\n    also could lead to a result that Congress likely did not intend. Be-\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  cause the FDA does not necessarily pursue enforcement measures re-\n  garding all objectionable labels, preclusion of Lanham Act claims\n  could leave commercial interests\u2014and indirectly the public at large\u2014\n  with less effective protection in the food and beverage labeling realm\n  than in other less regulated industries. Pp. 9\u201312.\n     (c) Coca-Cola\u2019s arguments do not support its claim that preclusion\n  is proper because Congress intended national uniformity in food and\n  beverage labeling. First, the FDCA\u2019s delegation of enforcement au-\n  thority to the Federal Government does not indicate that Congress\n  intended to foreclose private enforcement of other federal statutes.\n  Second, the FDCA\u2019s express pre-emption provision applies by its\n  terms to state, not federal, law. Even if it were proper to stray from\n  that text, it not clear that Coca-Cola\u2019s national uniformity assertions\n  reflect the congressional design. Finally, the FDCA and its imple-\n  menting regulations may address food and beverage labeling with\n  more specificity than the Lanham Act, but this specificity would mat-\n  ter only if the two Acts cannot be implemented in full at the same\n  time. Here, neither the statutory structure nor the empirical evi-\n  dence of which the Court is aware indicates there will be any difficul-\n  ty in fully enforcing each statute according to its terms. Pp. 13\u201315.\n     (d) The Government\u2019s intermediate position\u2014that a Lanham Act\n  claim is precluded \u201cto the extent the FDCA or FDA regulations spe-\n  cifically require or authorize the challenged aspects of [the] label,\u201d\n  and that this rule precludes POM\u2019s challenge to the name of Coca-\n  Cola\u2019s product\u2014is flawed, for the Government assumes that the\n  FDCA and its regulations are a ceiling on the regulation of food and\n  beverage labeling when Congress intended the Lanham Act and the\n  FDCA to complement each other with respect to labeling. Though\n  the FDA\u2019s rulemaking alludes at one point to a balance of interests, it\n  neither discusses nor cites the Lanham Act; and the Government\n  points to no other statement suggesting that the FDA considered the\n  full scope of interests protected by the Lanham Act. Even if agency\n  regulations with the force of law that purport to bar other legal rem-\n  edies may do so, it is a bridge too far to accept an agency\u2019s after-the-\n  fact statement to justify that result here. An agency may not reorder\n  federal statutory rights without congressional authorization.

THE \n\n            COCA-COLA COMPANY \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 12, 2014] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  POM Wonderful LLC makes and sells pomegranate\njuice products, including a pomegranate-blueberry juice\nblend. App. 23a. One of POM\u2019s competitors is the Coca-\nCola Company. Coca-Cola\u2019s Minute Maid Division makes\na juice blend sold with a label that, in describing the con-\ntents, displays the words \u201cpomegranate blueberry\u201d with\nfar more prominence than other words on the label that\nshow the juice to be a blend of five juices. In truth, the\nCoca-Cola product contains but 0.3% pomegranate juice\nand 0.2% blueberry juice.\n  Alleging that the use of that label is deceptive and\nmisleading, POM sued Coca-Cola under \u00a743 of the Lan-\nham Act. 60 Stat. 441, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71125.\nThat provision allows one competitor to sue another if it\nalleges unfair competition arising from false or misleading\nproduct descriptions. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit held that, in the realm of labeling for food and\nbeverages, a Lanham Act claim like POM\u2019s is precluded by\na second federal statute. The second statute is the Federal\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which forbids the\n2         POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmisbranding of food, including by means of false or mis-\nleading labeling. \u00a7\u00a7301, 403, 52 Stat. 1042, 1047, as\namended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7331, 343.\n   The ruling that POM\u2019s Lanham Act cause of action is\nprecluded by the FDCA was incorrect. There is no statu-\ntory text or established interpretive principle to support\nthe contention that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act suits\nlike the one brought by POM in this case. Nothing in the\ntext, history, or structure of the FDCA or the Lanham Act\nshows the congressional purpose or design to forbid these\nsuits. Quite to the contrary, the FDCA and the Lanham\nAct complement each other in the federal regulation of\nmisleading food and beverage labels. Competitors, in their\nown interest, may bring Lanham Act claims like POM\u2019s\nthat challenge food and beverage labels that are regulated\nby the FDCA.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   This case concerns the intersection and complementar-\nity of these two federal laws. A proper beginning point is a\ndescription of the statutes.\n   Congress enacted the Lanham Act nearly seven decades\nago. See 60 Stat. 427 (1946). As the Court explained\nearlier this Term, it \u201crequires no guesswork\u201d to ascertain\nCongress\u2019 intent regarding this federal law, for Congress\nincluded a \u201cdetailed statement of the statute\u2019s purposes.\u201d\nLexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12). Section 45 of the\nLanham Act provides:\n    \u201cThe intent of this chapter is to regulate commerce\n    within the control of Congress by making actionable\n    the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such\n    commerce; to protect registered marks used in such\n    commerce from interference by State, or territorial\n    legislation; to protect persons engaged in such com-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    merce against unfair competition; to prevent fraud\n    and deception in such commerce by the use of repro-\n    ductions, copies, counterfeits, or colorable imitations\n    of registered marks; and to provide rights and reme-\n    dies stipulated by treaties and conventions respecting\n    trademarks, trade names, and unfair competition en-\n    tered into between the United States and foreign na-\n    tions.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71127.\nThe Lanham Act\u2019s trademark provisions are the primary\nmeans of achieving these ends. But the Act also creates a\nfederal remedy \u201cthat goes beyond trademark protection.\u201d\nDastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 539\nU. S. 23, 29 (2003). The broader remedy is at issue here.\n   The Lanham Act creates a cause of action for unfair\ncompetition through misleading advertising or labeling.\nThough in the end consumers also benefit from the Act\u2019s\nproper enforcement, the cause of action is for competitors,\nnot consumers.\n   The term \u201ccompetitor\u201d is used in this opinion to indicate\nall those within the class of persons and entities protected\nby the Lanham Act. Competitors are within the class that\nmay invoke the Lanham Act because they may suffer \u201can\ninjury to a commercial interest in sales or business repu-\ntation proximately caused by [a] defendant\u2019s misrepresen-\ntations.\u201d Lexmark, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22). The\npetitioner here asserts injury as a competitor.\n   The cause of action the Act creates imposes civil liability\non any person who \u201cuses in commerce any word, term,\nname, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or\nany false designation of origin, false or misleading descrip-\ntion of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact,\nwhich . . . misrepresents the nature, characteristics, quali-\nties, or geographic origin of his or her or another person\u2019s\ngoods, services, or commercial activities.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71125(a)(1). As the Court held this Term, the private\n4         POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nremedy may be invoked only by those who \u201callege an\ninjury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales. A\nconsumer who is hoodwinked into purchasing a disap-\npointing product may well have an injury-in-fact cogniza-\nble under Article III, but he cannot invoke the protection\nof the Lanham Act.\u201d Lexmark, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 13). This principle reflects the Lanham Act\u2019s purpose of\n\u201c \u2018protect[ing] persons engaged in [commerce within the\ncontrol of Congress] against unfair competition.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 12). POM\u2019s cause of action would be\nstraightforward enough but for Coca-Cola\u2019s contention\nthat a separate federal statutory regime, the FDCA, al-\nlows it to use the label in question and in fact precludes\nthe Lanham Act claim.\n   So the FDCA is the second statute to be discussed. The\nFDCA statutory regime is designed primarily to protect\nthe health and safety of the public at large. See 62 Cases\nof Jam v. United States, 340 U. S. 593, 596 (1951); FDCA,\n\u00a7401, 52 Stat. 1046, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7341 (agency may issue\ncertain regulations to \u201cpromote honesty and fair dealing in\nthe interest of consumers\u201d). The FDCA prohibits the\nmisbranding of food and drink. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7321(f), 331.\nA food or drink is deemed misbranded if, inter alia, \u201cits\nlabeling is false or misleading,\u201d \u00a7343(a), information re-\nquired to appear on its label \u201cis not prominently placed\nthereon,\u201d \u00a7343(f), or a label does not bear \u201cthe common or\nusual name of the food, if any there be,\u201d \u00a7343(i). To im-\nplement these provisions, the Food and Drug Administra-\ntion (FDA) promulgated regulations regarding food and\nbeverage labeling, including the labeling of mixes of dif-\nferent types of juice into one juice blend. See 21 CFR\n\u00a7102.33 (2013). One provision of those regulations is\nparticularly relevant to this case: If a juice blend does not\nname all the juices it contains and mentions only juices\nthat are not predominant in the blend, then it must either\ndeclare the percentage content of the named juice or\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201c[i]ndicate that the named juice is present as a flavor or\nflavoring,\u201d e.g., \u201craspberry and cranberry flavored juice\ndrink.\u201d \u00a7102.33(d). The Government represents that the\nFDA does not preapprove juice labels under these regula-\ntions. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nOpposition 16. That contrasts with the FDA\u2019s regulation\nof other types of labels, such as drug labels, see 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(d), and is consistent with the less extensive role the\nFDA plays in the regulation of food than in the regulation\nof drugs.\n   Unlike the Lanham Act, which relies in substantial part\nfor its enforcement on private suits brought by injured\ncompetitors, the FDCA and its regulations provide the\nUnited States with nearly exclusive enforcement author-\nity, including the authority to seek criminal sanctions in\nsome circumstances. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7333(a), 337. Private\nparties may not bring enforcement suits. \u00a7337. Also\nunlike the Lanham Act, the FDCA contains a provision\npre-empting certain state laws on misbranding. That\nprovision, which Congress added to the FDCA in the\nNutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, \u00a76, 104\nStat. 2362\u20132364, forecloses a \u201cState or political subdivi-\nsion of a State\u201d from establishing requirements that are of\nthe type but \u201cnot identical to\u201d the requirements in some of\nthe misbranding provisions of the FDCA. 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7343\u20131(a). It does not address, or refer to, other federal\nstatutes or the preclusion thereof.\n                            B\n  POM Wonderful LLC is a grower of pomegranates and\na distributor of pomegranate juices. Through its POM\nWonderful brand, POM produces, markets, and sells a\nvariety of pomegranate products, including a pomegranate-\nblueberry juice blend. App. 23a.\n  POM competes in the pomegranate-blueberry juice\nmarket with the Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola, under\n6         POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits Minute Maid brand, created a juice blend containing\n99.4% apple and grape juices, 0.3% pomegranate juice,\n0.2% blueberry juice, and 0.1% raspberry juice. Id., at\n38a; Brief for Respondent 8. Despite the minuscule\namount of pomegranate and blueberry juices in the blend,\nthe front label of the Coca-Cola product displays the words\n\u201cpomegranate blueberry\u201d in all capital letters, on two\nseparate lines. App. 38a. Below those words, Coca-Cola\nplaced the phrase \u201cflavored blend of 5 juices\u201d in much\nsmaller type. Ibid. And below that phrase, in still smaller\ntype, were the words \u201cfrom concentrate with added ingre-\ndients\u201d\u2014and, with a line break before the final phrase\u2014\n\u201cand other natural flavors.\u201d Ibid. The product\u2019s front\nlabel also displays a vignette of blueberries, grapes, and\nraspberries in front of a halved pomegranate and a halved\napple. Ibid.\n   Claiming that Coca-Cola\u2019s label tricks and deceives\nconsumers, all to POM\u2019s injury as a competitor, POM\nbrought suit under the Lanham Act. POM alleged that\nthe name, label, marketing, and advertising of Coca-Cola\u2019s\njuice blend mislead consumers into believing the product\nconsists predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry\njuice when it in fact consists predominantly of less expen-\nsive apple and grape juices. Id., at 27a. That confusion,\nPOM complained, causes it to lose sales. Id., at 28a. POM\nsought damages and injunctive relief. Id., at 32a\u201333a.\n   The District Court granted partial summary judgment\nto Coca-Cola on POM\u2019s Lanham Act claim, ruling that the\nFDCA and its regulations preclude challenges to the name\nand label of Coca-Cola\u2019s juice blend. The District Court\nreasoned that in the juice blend regulations the \u201cFDA has\ndirectly spoken on the issues that form the basis of Pom\u2019s\nLanham Act claim against the naming and labeling of \u201d\nCoca-Cola\u2019s product, but has not prohibited any, and\nindeed expressly has permitted some, aspects of Coca-\nCola\u2019s label. 727 F.

Like the District Court, the Court of Ap-\npeals reasoned that Congress decided \u201cto entrust matters\nof juice beverage labeling to the FDA\u201d; the FDA has prom-\nulgated \u201ccomprehensive regulation of that labeling\u201d; and\nthe FDA \u201capparently\u201d has not imposed the requirements\non Coca-Cola\u2019s label that are sought by POM. 679 F. 3d\n1170, 1178 (2012). \u201c[U]nder [Circuit] precedent,\u201d the\nCourt of Appeals explained, \u201cfor a court to act when the\nFDA has not\u2014despite regulating extensively in this area\u2014\nwould risk undercutting the FDA\u2019s expert judgments and\nauthority.\u201d Id., at 1177. For these reasons, and \u201c[o]ut\nof respect for the statutory and regulatory scheme,\u201d the\nCourt of Appeals barred POM\u2019s Lanham Act claim. Id., at\n1178.\n                            II\n\n                             A\n\n  This Court granted certiorari to consider whether a\nprivate party may bring a Lanham Act claim challenging a\nfood label that is regulated by the FDCA. 571 U. S. ___\n(2014). The answer to that question is based on the fol-\nlowing premises.\n  First, this is not a pre-emption case. In pre-emption\ncases, the question is whether state law is pre-empted by a\nfederal statute, or in some instances, a federal agency\naction. See Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563 (2009).\nThis case, however, concerns the alleged preclusion of a\ncause of action under one federal statute by the provisions\nof another federal statute. So the state-federal balance\ndoes not frame the inquiry. Because this is a preclusion\ncase, any \u201cpresumption against pre-emption,\u201d id., at 565,\nn. 3, has no force. In addition, the preclusion analysis is\nnot governed by the Court\u2019s complex categorization of the\ntypes of pre-emption. See Crosby v. National Foreign\nTrade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372\u2013373 (2000). Although\n8         POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Court\u2019s pre-emption precedent does not govern preclu-\nsion analysis in this case, its principles are instructive\ninsofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of\nlaws that bear on the same subject.\n   Second, this is a statutory interpretation case and the\nCourt relies on traditional rules of statutory interpreta-\ntion. That does not change because the case involves\nmultiple federal statutes. See FDA v. Brown & William-\nson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 137\u2013139 (2000). Nor\ndoes it change because an agency is involved. See ibid.\nAnalysis of the statutory text, aided by established princi-\nples of interpretation, controls. See Chickasaw Nation v.\nUnited States, 534 U. S. 84, 94 (2001).\n   A principle of interpretation is \u201coften countered, of\ncourse, by some maxim pointing in a different direction.\u201d\nCircuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 115\n(2001). It is thus unsurprising that in this case a thresh-\nold dispute has arisen as to which of two competing max-\nims establishes the proper framework for decision. POM\nargues that this case concerns whether one statute, the\nFDCA as amended, is an \u201cimplied repeal\u201d in part of an-\nother statute, i.e., the Lanham Act. See, e.g., Carcieri v.\nSalazar, 555 U. S. 379, 395 (2009). POM contends that in\nsuch cases courts must give full effect to both statutes\nunless they are in \u201cirreconcilable conflict,\u201d see ibid., and\nthat this high standard is not satisfied here. Coca-Cola\nresists this canon and its high standard. Coca-Cola argues\nthat the case concerns whether a more specific law, the\nFDCA, clarifies or narrows the scope of a more general\nlaw, the Lanham Act. See, e.g., United States v. Fausto,\n484 U. S. 439, 453 (1988); Brief for Respondent 18. The\nCourt\u2019s task, it claims, is to \u201creconcil[e]\u201d the laws, ibid.,\nand it says the best reconciliation is that the more specific\nprovisions of the FDCA bar certain causes of action au-\nthorized in a general manner by the Lanham Act.\n   The Court does not need to resolve this dispute. Even\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nassuming that Coca-Cola is correct that the Court\u2019s task is\nto reconcile or harmonize the statutes and not, as POM\nurges, to enforce both statutes in full unless there is a\ngenuinely irreconcilable conflict, Coca-Cola is incorrect\nthat the best way to harmonize the statutes is to bar\nPOM\u2019s Lanham Act claim.\n                               B\n  Beginning with the text of the two statutes, it must be\nobserved that neither the Lanham Act nor the FDCA, in\nexpress terms, forbids or limits Lanham Act claims chal-\nlenging labels that are regulated by the FDCA. By its\nterms, the Lanham Act subjects to suit any person who\n\u201cmisrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or\ngeographic origin\u201d of goods or services.       15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71125(a). This comprehensive imposition of liability ex-\ntends, by its own terms, to misrepresentations on labels,\nincluding food and beverage labels. No other provision in\nthe Lanham Act limits that understanding or purports to\ngovern the relevant interaction between the Lanham Act\nand the FDCA. And the FDCA, by its terms, does not\npreclude Lanham Act suits. In consequence, food and\nbeverage labels regulated by the FDCA are not, under the\nterms of either statute, off limits to Lanham Act claims.\nNo textual provision in either statute discloses a purpose\nto bar unfair competition claims like POM\u2019s.\n  This absence is of special significance because the Lan-\nham Act and the FDCA have coexisted since the passage\nof the Lanham Act in 1946. 60 Stat. 427 (1946); ch. 675,\n52 Stat. 1040 (1938). If Congress had concluded, in light\nof experience, that Lanham Act suits could interfere with\nthe FDCA, it might well have enacted a provision address-\ning the issue during these 70 years. See Wyeth, supra, at\n574 (\u201cIf Congress thought state-law suits posed an obsta-\ncle to its objectives, it surely would have enacted an ex-\npress pre-emption provision at some point during the\n10        POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFDCA\u2019s 70-year history\u201d). Congress enacted amendments\nto the FDCA and the Lanham Act, see, e.g., Nutrition\nLabeling and Education Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 2353;\nTrademark Law Revision Act of 1988, \u00a7132, 102 Stat.\n3946, including an amendment that added to the FDCA an\nexpress pre-emption provision with respect to state laws\naddressing food and beverage misbranding, \u00a76, 104 Stat.\n2362. Yet Congress did not enact a provision addressing\nthe preclusion of other federal laws that might bear on\nfood and beverage labeling. This is \u201cpowerful evidence\nthat Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the\nexclusive means\u201d of ensuring proper food and beverage\nlabeling. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 575.\n  Perhaps the closest the statutes come to addressing the\npreclusion of the Lanham Act claim at issue here is the\npre-emption provision added to the FDCA in 1990 as part\nof the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act. See 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7343\u20131. But, far from expressly precluding suits\narising under other federal laws, the provision if anything\nsuggests that Lanham Act suits are not precluded.\n  This pre-emption provision forbids a \u201cState or political\nsubdivision of a State\u201d from imposing requirements that\nare of the type but \u201cnot identical to\u201d corresponding FDCA\nrequirements for food and beverage labeling. Ibid. It is\nsignificant that the complex pre-emption provision distin-\nguishes among different FDCA requirements. It forbids\nstate-law requirements that are of the type but not identi-\ncal to only certain FDCA provisions with respect to food\nand beverage labeling. See \u00a7\u00a7343\u20131(a)(1)\u2013(5) (citing some\nbut not all of the subsections of \u00a7343); \u00a76, 104 Stat. 2362\u2013\n2364 (codified at 21 U. S. C. \u00a7343\u20131, and note following).\nJust as significant, the provision does not refer to re-\nquirements imposed by other sources of law, such as fed-\neral statutes. For purposes of deciding whether the FDCA\ndisplaces a regulatory or liability scheme in another stat-\nute, it makes a substantial difference whether that other\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute is state or federal. By taking care to mandate\nexpress pre-emption of some state laws, Congress if any-\nthing indicated it did not intend the FDCA to preclude\nrequirements arising from other sources. See Setser v.\nUnited States, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6\u20137)\n(applying principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius).\nPre-emption of some state requirements does not suggest\nan intent to preclude federal claims.\n  The structures of the FDCA and the Lanham Act rein-\nforce the conclusion drawn from the text. When two stat-\nutes complement each other, it would show disregard for\nthe congressional design to hold that Congress nonethe-\nless intended one federal statute to preclude the operation\nof the other. See J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-\nBred Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 144 (2001) (\u201c[W]e can plainly\nregard each statute as effective because of its different\nrequirements and protections\u201d); see also Wyeth, supra, at\n578\u2013579. The Lanham Act and the FDCA complement\neach other in major respects, for each has its own scope\nand purpose. Although both statutes touch on food and\nbeverage labeling, the Lanham Act protects commercial\ninterests against unfair competition, while the FDCA\nprotects public health and safety. Compare Lexmark, 572\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12\u201313), with 62 Cases of Jam, 340\nU. S., at 596. The two statutes impose \u201cdifferent require-\nments and protections.\u201d J. E. M. Ag Supply, supra, at 144.\n  The two statutes complement each other with respect to\nremedies in a more fundamental respect. Enforcement of\nthe FDCA and the detailed prescriptions of its implement-\ning regulations is largely committed to the FDA. The\nFDA, however, does not have the same perspective or\nexpertise in assessing market dynamics that day-to-day\ncompetitors possess. Competitors who manufacture or\ndistribute products have detailed knowledge regarding\nhow consumers rely upon certain sales and marketing\nstrategies. Their awareness of unfair competition prac-\n12        POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntices may be far more immediate and accurate than that of\nagency rulemakers and regulators. Lanham Act suits\ndraw upon this market expertise by empowering private\nparties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a\ncase-by-case basis. By \u201cserv[ing] a distinct compensatory\nfunction that may motivate injured persons to come for-\nward,\u201d Lanham Act suits, to the extent they touch on the\nsame subject matter as the FDCA, \u201cprovide incentives\u201d for\nmanufacturers to behave well. See id., at 579. Allowing\nLanham Act suits takes advantage of synergies among\nmultiple methods of regulation. This is quite consistent\nwith the congressional design to enact two different stat-\nutes, each with its own mechanisms to enhance the protec-\ntion of competitors and consumers.\n   A holding that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act claims\nchallenging food and beverage labels would not only ignore\nthe distinct functional aspects of the FDCA and the Lan-\nham Act but also would lead to a result that Congress\nlikely did not intend. Unlike other types of labels regu-\nlated by the FDA, such as drug labels, see 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(d), it would appear the FDA does not preapprove food\nand beverage labels under its regulations and instead\nrelies on enforcement actions, warning letters, and other\nmeasures. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\nin Opposition 16. Because the FDA acknowledges that it\ndoes not necessarily pursue enforcement measures regard-\ning all objectionable labels, ibid., if Lanham Act claims\nwere to be precluded then commercial interests\u2014and\nindirectly the public at large\u2014could be left with less effec-\ntive protection in the food and beverage labeling realm\nthan in many other, less regulated industries. It is un-\nlikely that Congress intended the FDCA\u2019s protection of\nhealth and safety to result in less policing of misleading\nfood and beverage labels than in competitive markets for\nother products.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              C\n\n   Coca-Cola argues the FDCA precludes POM\u2019s Lanham\nAct claim because Congress intended national uniformity\nin food and beverage labeling. Coca-Cola notes three\naspects of the FDCA to support that position: delegation of\nenforcement authority to the Federal Government rather\nthan private parties; express pre-emption with respect to\nstate laws; and the specificity of the FDCA and its imple-\nmenting regulations. But these details of the FDCA do\nnot establish an intent or design to preclude Lanham Act\nclaims.\n   Coca-Cola says that the FDCA\u2019s delegation of enforce-\nment authority to the Federal Government shows Con-\ngress\u2019 intent to achieve national uniformity in labeling.\nBut POM seeks to enforce the Lanham Act, not the FDCA\nor its regulations. The centralization of FDCA enforce-\nment authority in the Federal Government does not indi-\ncate that Congress intended to foreclose private enforce-\nment of other federal statutes.\n   Coca-Cola next appeals to the pre-emption provision\nadded to the FDCA in 1990. See \u00a7343\u20131. It argues that\nallowing Lanham Act claims to proceed would undermine\nthe pre-emption provision\u2019s goal of ensuring that food and\nbeverage manufacturers can market nationally without\nthe burden of complying with a patchwork of require-\nments. A significant flaw in this argument is that the pre-\nemption provision by its plain terms applies only to cer-\ntain state-law requirements, not to federal law. See Part\nII\u2013B, supra. Coca-Cola in effect asks the Court to ignore\nthe words \u201cState or political subdivision of a State\u201d in the\nstatute.\n   Even if it were proper to stray from the text in this way,\nit is far from clear that Coca-Cola\u2019s assertions about na-\ntional uniformity in fact reflect the congressional design.\nAlthough the application of a federal statute such as the\nLanham Act by judges and juries in courts throughout the\n14        POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncountry may give rise to some variation in outcome, this is\nthe means Congress chose to enforce a national policy to\nensure fair competition. It is quite different from the\ndisuniformity that would arise from the multitude of state\nlaws, state regulations, state administrative agency rul-\nings, and state-court decisions that are partially forbidden\nby the FDCA\u2019s pre-emption provision. Congress not infre-\nquently permits a certain amount of variability by author-\nizing a federal cause of action even in areas of law where\nnational uniformity is important. Compare Bonito Boats,\nInc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 162 (1989)\n(\u201cOne of the fundamental purposes behind the Patent and\nCopyright Clauses of the Constitution was to promote\nnational uniformity in the realm of intellectual property\u201d),\nwith 35 U. S. C. \u00a7281 (private right of action for patent\ninfringement); see Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 570 (\u201c[T]he [FDCA]\ncontemplates that federal juries will resolve most mis-\nbranding claims\u201d). The Lanham Act itself is an example of\nthis design: Despite Coca-Cola\u2019s protestations, the Act is\nuniform in extending its protection against unfair compe-\ntition to the whole class it describes. It is variable only to\nthe extent that those rights are enforced on a case-by-case\nbasis. The variability about which Coca-Cola complains is\nno different than the variability that any industry covered\nby the Lanham Act faces. And, as noted, Lanham Act\nactions are a means to implement a uniform policy to\nprohibit unfair competition in all covered markets.\n   Finally, Coca-Cola urges that the FDCA, and particu-\nlarly its implementing regulations, addresses food and bev-\nerage labeling with much more specificity than is found\nin the provisions of the Lanham Act. That is true. The\npages of FDA rulemakings devoted only to juice-blend\nlabeling attest to the level of detail with which the FDA\nhas examined the subject. E.g., Food Labeling; Declara-\ntion of Ingredients; Common or Usual Name for Non-\nstandardized Foods; Diluted Juice Beverages, 58 Fed. Reg.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Because, as we have explained, the\nFDCA and the Lanham Act are complementary and have\nseparate scopes and purposes, this greater specificity\nwould matter only if the Lanham Act and the FDCA can-\nnot be implemented in full at the same time. See RadLAX\nGateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U. S. ___,\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 5\u20137). But neither the statutory\nstructure nor the empirical evidence of which the Court is\naware indicates there will be any difficulty in fully enforc-\ning each statute according to its terms. See Part II\u2013B,\nsupra.\n                               D\n  The Government disagrees with both Coca-Cola and\nPOM. It submits that a Lanham Act claim is precluded\n\u201cto the extent the FDCA or FDA regulations specifically\nrequire or authorize the challenged aspects of [the] label.\u201d\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11. Applying\nthat standard, the Government argues that POM may not\nbring a Lanham Act challenge to the name of Coca-Cola\u2019s\nproduct, but that other aspects of the label may be chal-\nlenged. That is because, the Government argues, the FDA\nregulations specifically authorize the names of juice\nblends but not the other aspects of the label that are at\nissue.\n  In addition to raising practical concerns about drawing\na distinction between regulations that \u201cspecifically . . .\nauthorize\u201d a course of conduct and those that merely\ntolerate that course, id., at 10\u201311, the flaw in the Govern-\nment\u2019s intermediate position is the same as that in Coca-\nCola\u2019s theory of the case. The Government assumes that\nthe FDCA and its regulations are at least in some circum-\nstances a ceiling on the regulation of food and beverage\nlabeling. But, as discussed above, Congress intended the\nLanham Act and the FDCA to complement each other with\nrespect to food and beverage labeling.\n16        POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government claims that the \u201cFDA\u2019s juice-naming\nregulation reflects the agency\u2019s \u2018weigh[ing of] the compet-\ning interests relevant to the particular requirement in\nquestion.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 19 (quoting Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518\nU. S. 470, 501 (1996)). The rulemaking indeed does al-\nlude, at one point, to a balancing of interests: It styles a\nparticular requirement as \u201cprovid[ing] manufacturers with\nflexibility for labeling products while providing consumers\nwith information that they need.\u201d 58 Fed. Reg. 2919\u2013\n2920. But that rulemaking does not discuss or even cite\nthe Lanham Act, and the Government cites no other\nstatement in the rulemaking suggesting that the FDA\nconsidered the full scope of the interests the Lanham Act\nprotects. In addition, and contrary to the language quoted\nabove, the FDA explicitly encouraged manufacturers to\ninclude material on their labels that is not required by the\nregulations. Id., at 2919. A single isolated reference to a\ndesire for flexibility is not sufficient to transform a rule-\nmaking that is otherwise at best inconclusive as to its\ninteraction with other federal laws into one with preclu-\nsive force, even on the assumption that a federal regula-\ntion in some instances might preclude application of a\nfederal statute. Cf. Williamson v. Mazda Motor of Amer-\nica, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10\u201311).\n   In addition, Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529\nU. S. 861 (2000), does not support the Government\u2019s ar-\ngument. In Geier, the agency enacted a regulation delib-\nerately allowing manufacturers to choose between differ-\nent options because the agency wanted to encourage\ndiversity in the industry. A subsequent lawsuit chal-\nlenged one of those choices. The Court concluded that the\naction was barred because it directly conflicted with the\nagency\u2019s policy choice to encourage flexibility to foster\ninnovation. Id., at 875. Here, by contrast, the FDA has\nnot made a policy judgment that is inconsistent with\nPOM\u2019s Lanham Act suit. This is not a case where a law-\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

The Government asks\nthe Court to preclude private parties from availing them-\nselves of a well-established federal remedy because an\nagency enacted regulations that touch on similar subject\nmatter but do not purport to displace that remedy or even\nimplement the statute that is its source. Even if agency\nregulations with the force of law that purport to bar other\nlegal remedies may do so, see id., at 874; see also Wyeth,\n555 U. S., at 576, it is a bridge too far to accept an agen-\ncy\u2019s after-the-fact statement to justify that result here. An\nagency may not reorder federal statutory rights without\ncongressional authorization.\n                        *     *   *\n  Coca-Cola and the United States ask the Court to ele-\nvate the FDCA and the FDA\u2019s regulations over the private\ncause of action authorized by the Lanham Act. But the\nFDCA and the Lanham Act complement each other in the\nfederal regulation of misleading labels. Congress did not\nintend the FDCA to preclude Lanham Act suits like\nPOM\u2019s.

Argued April 21, 2014\u2014Decided June 12, 2014\nThis case involves the intersection of two federal statutes. The Lanham\n  Act permits one competitor to sue another for unfair competition aris-\n  ing from false or misleading product descriptions. 15 U. S. C. \u00a71125.\n  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) prohibits the mis-\n  branding of food and drink. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7321(f), 331. To implement\n  the FDCA\u2019s provisions, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has\n  promulgated regulations regarding food and beverage labeling, in-\n  cluding one concerning juice blends. Unlike the Lanham Act, which,\n  relies in large part for its enforcement on private suits brought by in-\n  jured competitors, the FDCA and its regulations give the United\n  States nearly exclusive enforcement authority and do not permit pri-\n  vate enforcement suits. The FDCA also pre-empts certain state mis-\n  branding laws.\n     Petitioner POM Wonderful LLC, which produces, markets, and\n  sells, inter alia, a pomegranate-blueberry juice blend, filed a Lanham\n  Act suit against respondent Coca-Cola Company, alleging that the\n  name, label, marketing, and advertising of one of Coca-Cola\u2019s juice\n  blends mislead consumers into believing the product consists predom-\n  inantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it in fact consists\n  predominantly of less expensive apple and grape juices, and that the\n  ensuing confusion causes POM to lose sales. The District Court\n  granted partial summary judgment to Coca-Cola, ruling that the\n  FDCA and its regulations preclude Lanham Act challenges to the\n  name and label of Coca-Cola\u2019s juice blend. The Ninth Circuit af-\n  firmed in relevant part.\nHeld: Competitors may bring Lanham Act claims like POM\u2019s challeng-\n ing food and beverage labels regulated by the FDCA. Pp. 7\u201317.\n    (a) This result is based on the following premises. First, this is not\n2             POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    a pre-emption case, for it does not raise the question whether state\n    law is pre-empted by a federal law, see Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n    555, 563, but instead concerns the alleged preclusion of a cause of ac-\n    tion under one federal statute by the provisions of another federal\n    statute. Pre-emption principles may nonetheless be instructive inso-\n    far as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws bearing on\n    the same subject. Second, this is a statutory interpretation case; and\n    analysis of the statutory text, aided by established interpretation\n    rules, controls. See Chickasaw Nation v. United States, 534 U. S. 84,\n    94. While a principle of interpretation may be countered \u201cby some\n    maxim pointing in a different direction,\u201d Circuit City Stores, Inc. v.\n    Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 115, this Court need not decide what maxim\n    establishes the proper framework here: Even assuming that Coca-\n    Cola is correct that the Court\u2019s task is to reconcile or harmonize the\n    statutes instead of to determine whether one statute is an implied\n    repeal in part of another statute, Coca-Cola is incorrect that the best\n    way to do that is to bar POM\u2019s Lanham Act claim. Pp. 7\u20139.\n       (b) Neither the Lanham Act nor the FDCA, in express terms, for-\n    bids or limits Lanham Act claims challenging labels that are regulat-\n    ed by the FDCA. The absence of such a textual provision when the\n    Lanham Act and the FDCA have coexisted for over 70 years is \u201cpow-\n    erful evidence that Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the\n    exclusive means\u201d of ensuring proper food and beverage labeling. See\n    Wyeth, supra, at 575. In addition, and contrary to Coca-Cola\u2019s argu-\n    ment, Congress, by taking care to pre-empt only some state laws, if\n    anything indicated it did not intend the FDCA to preclude require-\n    ments arising from other sources. See Setser v. United States, 566\n    U. S. ___, ___. The structures of the FDCA and the Lanham Act rein-\n    force this conclusion. Where two statutes are complementary, it\n    would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that Con-\n    gress intended one federal statute nonetheless to preclude the opera-\n    tion of the other. See J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred\n    Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 144. The Lanham Act and the FDCA com-\n    plement each other in major respects, for each has its own scope and\n    purpose. Both touch on food and beverage labeling, but the Lanham\n    Act protects commercial interests against unfair competition, while\n    the FDCA protects public health and safety. They also complement\n    each other with respect to remedies. The FDCA\u2019s enforcement is\n    largely committed to the FDA, while the Lanham Act empowers pri-\n    vate parties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a case-by-\n    case basis. Allowing Lanham Act suits takes advantage of synergies\n    among multiple methods of regulation. A holding that the FDCA\n    precludes Lanham Act claims challenging food and beverage labels\n    also could lead to a result that Congress likely did not intend. Be-\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  cause the FDA does not necessarily pursue enforcement measures re-\n  garding all objectionable labels, preclusion of Lanham Act claims\n  could leave commercial interests\u2014and indirectly the public at large\u2014\n  with less effective protection in the food and beverage labeling realm\n  than in other less regulated industries. Pp. 9\u201312.\n     (c) Coca-Cola\u2019s arguments do not support its claim that preclusion\n  is proper because Congress intended national uniformity in food and\n  beverage labeling. First, the FDCA\u2019s delegation of enforcement au-\n  thority to the Federal Government does not indicate that Congress\n  intended to foreclose private enforcement of other federal statutes.\n  Second, the FDCA\u2019s express pre-emption provision applies by its\n  terms to state, not federal, law. Even if it were proper to stray from\n  that text, it not clear that Coca-Cola\u2019s national uniformity assertions\n  reflect the congressional design. Finally, the FDCA and its imple-\n  menting regulations may address food and beverage labeling with\n  more specificity than the Lanham Act, but this specificity would mat-\n  ter only if the two Acts cannot be implemented in full at the same\n  time. Here, neither the statutory structure nor the empirical evi-\n  dence of which the Court is aware indicates there will be any difficul-\n  ty in fully enforcing each statute according to its terms. Pp. 13\u201315.\n     (d) The Government\u2019s intermediate position\u2014that a Lanham Act\n  claim is precluded \u201cto the extent the FDCA or FDA regulations spe-\n  cifically require or authorize the challenged aspects of [the] label,\u201d\n  and that this rule precludes POM\u2019s challenge to the name of Coca-\n  Cola\u2019s product\u2014is flawed, for the Government assumes that the\n  FDCA and its regulations are a ceiling on the regulation of food and\n  beverage labeling when Congress intended the Lanham Act and the\n  FDCA to complement each other with respect to labeling. Though\n  the FDA\u2019s rulemaking alludes at one point to a balance of interests, it\n  neither discusses nor cites the Lanham Act; and the Government\n  points to no other statement suggesting that the FDA considered the\n  full scope of interests protected by the Lanham Act. Even if agency\n  regulations with the force of law that purport to bar other legal rem-\n  edies may do so, it is a bridge too far to accept an agency\u2019s after-the-\n  fact statement to justify that result here. An agency may not reorder\n  federal statutory rights without congressional authorization.

THE \n\n            COCA-COLA COMPANY \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 12, 2014] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  POM Wonderful LLC makes and sells pomegranate\njuice products, including a pomegranate-blueberry juice\nblend. App. 23a. One of POM\u2019s competitors is the Coca-\nCola Company. Coca-Cola\u2019s Minute Maid Division makes\na juice blend sold with a label that, in describing the con-\ntents, displays the words \u201cpomegranate blueberry\u201d with\nfar more prominence than other words on the label that\nshow the juice to be a blend of five juices. In truth, the\nCoca-Cola product contains but 0.3% pomegranate juice\nand 0.2% blueberry juice.\n  Alleging that the use of that label is deceptive and\nmisleading, POM sued Coca-Cola under \u00a743 of the Lan-\nham Act. 60 Stat. 441, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71125.\nThat provision allows one competitor to sue another if it\nalleges unfair competition arising from false or misleading\nproduct descriptions. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit held that, in the realm of labeling for food and\nbeverages, a Lanham Act claim like POM\u2019s is precluded by\na second federal statute. The second statute is the Federal\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which forbids the\n2         POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmisbranding of food, including by means of false or mis-\nleading labeling. \u00a7\u00a7301, 403, 52 Stat. 1042, 1047, as\namended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7331, 343.\n   The ruling that POM\u2019s Lanham Act cause of action is\nprecluded by the FDCA was incorrect. There is no statu-\ntory text or established interpretive principle to support\nthe contention that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act suits\nlike the one brought by POM in this case. Nothing in the\ntext, history, or structure of the FDCA or the Lanham Act\nshows the congressional purpose or design to forbid these\nsuits. Quite to the contrary, the FDCA and the Lanham\nAct complement each other in the federal regulation of\nmisleading food and beverage labels. Competitors, in their\nown interest, may bring Lanham Act claims like POM\u2019s\nthat challenge food and beverage labels that are regulated\nby the FDCA.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   This case concerns the intersection and complementar-\nity of these two federal laws. A proper beginning point is a\ndescription of the statutes.\n   Congress enacted the Lanham Act nearly seven decades\nago. See 60 Stat. 427 (1946). As the Court explained\nearlier this Term, it \u201crequires no guesswork\u201d to ascertain\nCongress\u2019 intent regarding this federal law, for Congress\nincluded a \u201cdetailed statement of the statute\u2019s purposes.\u201d\nLexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12). Section 45 of the\nLanham Act provides:\n    \u201cThe intent of this chapter is to regulate commerce\n    within the control of Congress by making actionable\n    the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such\n    commerce; to protect registered marks used in such\n    commerce from interference by State, or territorial\n    legislation; to protect persons engaged in such com-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    merce against unfair competition; to prevent fraud\n    and deception in such commerce by the use of repro-\n    ductions, copies, counterfeits, or colorable imitations\n    of registered marks; and to provide rights and reme-\n    dies stipulated by treaties and conventions respecting\n    trademarks, trade names, and unfair competition en-\n    tered into between the United States and foreign na-\n    tions.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71127.\nThe Lanham Act\u2019s trademark provisions are the primary\nmeans of achieving these ends. But the Act also creates a\nfederal remedy \u201cthat goes beyond trademark protection.\u201d\nDastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 539\nU. S. 23, 29 (2003). The broader remedy is at issue here.\n   The Lanham Act creates a cause of action for unfair\ncompetition through misleading advertising or labeling.\nThough in the end consumers also benefit from the Act\u2019s\nproper enforcement, the cause of action is for competitors,\nnot consumers.\n   The term \u201ccompetitor\u201d is used in this opinion to indicate\nall those within the class of persons and entities protected\nby the Lanham Act. Competitors are within the class that\nmay invoke the Lanham Act because they may suffer \u201can\ninjury to a commercial interest in sales or business repu-\ntation proximately caused by [a] defendant\u2019s misrepresen-\ntations.\u201d Lexmark, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22). The\npetitioner here asserts injury as a competitor.\n   The cause of action the Act creates imposes civil liability\non any person who \u201cuses in commerce any word, term,\nname, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or\nany false designation of origin, false or misleading descrip-\ntion of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact,\nwhich . . . misrepresents the nature, characteristics, quali-\nties, or geographic origin of his or her or another person\u2019s\ngoods, services, or commercial activities.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71125(a)(1). As the Court held this Term, the private\n4         POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nremedy may be invoked only by those who \u201callege an\ninjury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales. A\nconsumer who is hoodwinked into purchasing a disap-\npointing product may well have an injury-in-fact cogniza-\nble under Article III, but he cannot invoke the protection\nof the Lanham Act.\u201d Lexmark, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 13). This principle reflects the Lanham Act\u2019s purpose of\n\u201c \u2018protect[ing] persons engaged in [commerce within the\ncontrol of Congress] against unfair competition.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 12). POM\u2019s cause of action would be\nstraightforward enough but for Coca-Cola\u2019s contention\nthat a separate federal statutory regime, the FDCA, al-\nlows it to use the label in question and in fact precludes\nthe Lanham Act claim.\n   So the FDCA is the second statute to be discussed. The\nFDCA statutory regime is designed primarily to protect\nthe health and safety of the public at large. See 62 Cases\nof Jam v. United States, 340 U. S. 593, 596 (1951); FDCA,\n\u00a7401, 52 Stat. 1046, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7341 (agency may issue\ncertain regulations to \u201cpromote honesty and fair dealing in\nthe interest of consumers\u201d). The FDCA prohibits the\nmisbranding of food and drink. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7321(f), 331.\nA food or drink is deemed misbranded if, inter alia, \u201cits\nlabeling is false or misleading,\u201d \u00a7343(a), information re-\nquired to appear on its label \u201cis not prominently placed\nthereon,\u201d \u00a7343(f), or a label does not bear \u201cthe common or\nusual name of the food, if any there be,\u201d \u00a7343(i). To im-\nplement these provisions, the Food and Drug Administra-\ntion (FDA) promulgated regulations regarding food and\nbeverage labeling, including the labeling of mixes of dif-\nferent types of juice into one juice blend. See 21 CFR\n\u00a7102.33 (2013). One provision of those regulations is\nparticularly relevant to this case: If a juice blend does not\nname all the juices it contains and mentions only juices\nthat are not predominant in the blend, then it must either\ndeclare the percentage content of the named juice or\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201c[i]ndicate that the named juice is present as a flavor or\nflavoring,\u201d e.g., \u201craspberry and cranberry flavored juice\ndrink.\u201d \u00a7102.33(d). The Government represents that the\nFDA does not preapprove juice labels under these regula-\ntions. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nOpposition 16. That contrasts with the FDA\u2019s regulation\nof other types of labels, such as drug labels, see 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(d), and is consistent with the less extensive role the\nFDA plays in the regulation of food than in the regulation\nof drugs.\n   Unlike the Lanham Act, which relies in substantial part\nfor its enforcement on private suits brought by injured\ncompetitors, the FDCA and its regulations provide the\nUnited States with nearly exclusive enforcement author-\nity, including the authority to seek criminal sanctions in\nsome circumstances. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7333(a), 337. Private\nparties may not bring enforcement suits. \u00a7337. Also\nunlike the Lanham Act, the FDCA contains a provision\npre-empting certain state laws on misbranding. That\nprovision, which Congress added to the FDCA in the\nNutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, \u00a76, 104\nStat. 2362\u20132364, forecloses a \u201cState or political subdivi-\nsion of a State\u201d from establishing requirements that are of\nthe type but \u201cnot identical to\u201d the requirements in some of\nthe misbranding provisions of the FDCA. 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7343\u20131(a). It does not address, or refer to, other federal\nstatutes or the preclusion thereof.\n                            B\n  POM Wonderful LLC is a grower of pomegranates and\na distributor of pomegranate juices. Through its POM\nWonderful brand, POM produces, markets, and sells a\nvariety of pomegranate products, including a pomegranate-\nblueberry juice blend. App. 23a.\n  POM competes in the pomegranate-blueberry juice\nmarket with the Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola, under\n6         POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits Minute Maid brand, created a juice blend containing\n99.4% apple and grape juices, 0.3% pomegranate juice,\n0.2% blueberry juice, and 0.1% raspberry juice. Id., at\n38a; Brief for Respondent 8. Despite the minuscule\namount of pomegranate and blueberry juices in the blend,\nthe front label of the Coca-Cola product displays the words\n\u201cpomegranate blueberry\u201d in all capital letters, on two\nseparate lines. App. 38a. Below those words, Coca-Cola\nplaced the phrase \u201cflavored blend of 5 juices\u201d in much\nsmaller type. Ibid. And below that phrase, in still smaller\ntype, were the words \u201cfrom concentrate with added ingre-\ndients\u201d\u2014and, with a line break before the final phrase\u2014\n\u201cand other natural flavors.\u201d Ibid. The product\u2019s front\nlabel also displays a vignette of blueberries, grapes, and\nraspberries in front of a halved pomegranate and a halved\napple. Ibid.\n   Claiming that Coca-Cola\u2019s label tricks and deceives\nconsumers, all to POM\u2019s injury as a competitor, POM\nbrought suit under the Lanham Act. POM alleged that\nthe name, label, marketing, and advertising of Coca-Cola\u2019s\njuice blend mislead consumers into believing the product\nconsists predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry\njuice when it in fact consists predominantly of less expen-\nsive apple and grape juices. Id., at 27a. That confusion,\nPOM complained, causes it to lose sales. Id., at 28a. POM\nsought damages and injunctive relief. Id., at 32a\u201333a.\n   The District Court granted partial summary judgment\nto Coca-Cola on POM\u2019s Lanham Act claim, ruling that the\nFDCA and its regulations preclude challenges to the name\nand label of Coca-Cola\u2019s juice blend. The District Court\nreasoned that in the juice blend regulations the \u201cFDA has\ndirectly spoken on the issues that form the basis of Pom\u2019s\nLanham Act claim against the naming and labeling of \u201d\nCoca-Cola\u2019s product, but has not prohibited any, and\nindeed expressly has permitted some, aspects of Coca-\nCola\u2019s label. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2473086\"><a href=\"/cacd/dFaq/pom-wonderful-llc-v-coca-cola-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Like the District Court, the Court of Ap-\npeals reasoned that Congress decided \u201cto entrust matters\nof juice beverage labeling to the FDA\u201d; the FDA has prom-\nulgated \u201ccomprehensive regulation of that labeling\u201d; and\nthe FDA \u201capparently\u201d has not imposed the requirements\non Coca-Cola\u2019s label that are sought by POM. 679 F. 3d\n1170, 1178 (2012). \u201c[U]nder [Circuit] precedent,\u201d the\nCourt of Appeals explained, \u201cfor a court to act when the\nFDA has not\u2014despite regulating extensively in this area\u2014\nwould risk undercutting the FDA\u2019s expert judgments and\nauthority.\u201d Id., at 1177. For these reasons, and \u201c[o]ut\nof respect for the statutory and regulatory scheme,\u201d the\nCourt of Appeals barred POM\u2019s Lanham Act claim. Id., at\n1178.\n                            II\n\n                             A\n\n  This Court granted certiorari to consider whether a\nprivate party may bring a Lanham Act claim challenging a\nfood label that is regulated by the FDCA. 571 U. S. ___\n(2014). The answer to that question is based on the fol-\nlowing premises.\n  First, this is not a pre-emption case. In pre-emption\ncases, the question is whether state law is pre-empted by a\nfederal statute, or in some instances, a federal agency\naction. See Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563 (2009).\nThis case, however, concerns the alleged preclusion of a\ncause of action under one federal statute by the provisions\nof another federal statute. So the state-federal balance\ndoes not frame the inquiry. Because this is a preclusion\ncase, any \u201cpresumption against pre-emption,\u201d id., at 565,\nn. 3, has no force. In addition, the preclusion analysis is\nnot governed by the Court\u2019s complex categorization of the\ntypes of pre-emption. See Crosby v. National Foreign\nTrade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372\u2013373 (2000). Although\n8         POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Court\u2019s pre-emption precedent does not govern preclu-\nsion analysis in this case, its principles are instructive\ninsofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of\nlaws that bear on the same subject.\n   Second, this is a statutory interpretation case and the\nCourt relies on traditional rules of statutory interpreta-\ntion. That does not change because the case involves\nmultiple federal statutes. See FDA v. Brown & William-\nson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 137\u2013139 (2000). Nor\ndoes it change because an agency is involved. See ibid.\nAnalysis of the statutory text, aided by established princi-\nples of interpretation, controls. See Chickasaw Nation v.\nUnited States, 534 U. S. 84, 94 (2001).\n   A principle of interpretation is \u201coften countered, of\ncourse, by some maxim pointing in a different direction.\u201d\nCircuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 115\n(2001). It is thus unsurprising that in this case a thresh-\nold dispute has arisen as to which of two competing max-\nims establishes the proper framework for decision. POM\nargues that this case concerns whether one statute, the\nFDCA as amended, is an \u201cimplied repeal\u201d in part of an-\nother statute, i.e., the Lanham Act. See, e.g., Carcieri v.\nSalazar, 555 U. S. 379, 395 (2009). POM contends that in\nsuch cases courts must give full effect to both statutes\nunless they are in \u201cirreconcilable conflict,\u201d see ibid., and\nthat this high standard is not satisfied here. Coca-Cola\nresists this canon and its high standard. Coca-Cola argues\nthat the case concerns whether a more specific law, the\nFDCA, clarifies or narrows the scope of a more general\nlaw, the Lanham Act. See, e.g., United States v. Fausto,\n484 U. S. 439, 453 (1988); Brief for Respondent 18. The\nCourt\u2019s task, it claims, is to \u201creconcil[e]\u201d the laws, ibid.,\nand it says the best reconciliation is that the more specific\nprovisions of the FDCA bar certain causes of action au-\nthorized in a general manner by the Lanham Act.\n   The Court does not need to resolve this dispute. Even\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nassuming that Coca-Cola is correct that the Court\u2019s task is\nto reconcile or harmonize the statutes and not, as POM\nurges, to enforce both statutes in full unless there is a\ngenuinely irreconcilable conflict, Coca-Cola is incorrect\nthat the best way to harmonize the statutes is to bar\nPOM\u2019s Lanham Act claim.\n                               B\n  Beginning with the text of the two statutes, it must be\nobserved that neither the Lanham Act nor the FDCA, in\nexpress terms, forbids or limits Lanham Act claims chal-\nlenging labels that are regulated by the FDCA. By its\nterms, the Lanham Act subjects to suit any person who\n\u201cmisrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or\ngeographic origin\u201d of goods or services.       15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71125(a). This comprehensive imposition of liability ex-\ntends, by its own terms, to misrepresentations on labels,\nincluding food and beverage labels. No other provision in\nthe Lanham Act limits that understanding or purports to\ngovern the relevant interaction between the Lanham Act\nand the FDCA. And the FDCA, by its terms, does not\npreclude Lanham Act suits. In consequence, food and\nbeverage labels regulated by the FDCA are not, under the\nterms of either statute, off limits to Lanham Act claims.\nNo textual provision in either statute discloses a purpose\nto bar unfair competition claims like POM\u2019s.\n  This absence is of special significance because the Lan-\nham Act and the FDCA have coexisted since the passage\nof the Lanham Act in 1946. 60 Stat. 427 (1946); ch. 675,\n52 Stat. 1040 (1938). If Congress had concluded, in light\nof experience, that Lanham Act suits could interfere with\nthe FDCA, it might well have enacted a provision address-\ning the issue during these 70 years. See Wyeth, supra, at\n574 (\u201cIf Congress thought state-law suits posed an obsta-\ncle to its objectives, it surely would have enacted an ex-\npress pre-emption provision at some point during the\n10        POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFDCA\u2019s 70-year history\u201d). Congress enacted amendments\nto the FDCA and the Lanham Act, see, e.g., Nutrition\nLabeling and Education Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 2353;\nTrademark Law Revision Act of 1988, \u00a7132, 102 Stat.\n3946, including an amendment that added to the FDCA an\nexpress pre-emption provision with respect to state laws\naddressing food and beverage misbranding, \u00a76, 104 Stat.\n2362. Yet Congress did not enact a provision addressing\nthe preclusion of other federal laws that might bear on\nfood and beverage labeling. This is \u201cpowerful evidence\nthat Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the\nexclusive means\u201d of ensuring proper food and beverage\nlabeling. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 575.\n  Perhaps the closest the statutes come to addressing the\npreclusion of the Lanham Act claim at issue here is the\npre-emption provision added to the FDCA in 1990 as part\nof the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act. See 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7343\u20131. But, far from expressly precluding suits\narising under other federal laws, the provision if anything\nsuggests that Lanham Act suits are not precluded.\n  This pre-emption provision forbids a \u201cState or political\nsubdivision of a State\u201d from imposing requirements that\nare of the type but \u201cnot identical to\u201d corresponding FDCA\nrequirements for food and beverage labeling. Ibid. It is\nsignificant that the complex pre-emption provision distin-\nguishes among different FDCA requirements. It forbids\nstate-law requirements that are of the type but not identi-\ncal to only certain FDCA provisions with respect to food\nand beverage labeling. See \u00a7\u00a7343\u20131(a)(1)\u2013(5) (citing some\nbut not all of the subsections of \u00a7343); \u00a76, 104 Stat. 2362\u2013\n2364 (codified at 21 U. S. C. \u00a7343\u20131, and note following).\nJust as significant, the provision does not refer to re-\nquirements imposed by other sources of law, such as fed-\neral statutes. For purposes of deciding whether the FDCA\ndisplaces a regulatory or liability scheme in another stat-\nute, it makes a substantial difference whether that other\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute is state or federal. By taking care to mandate\nexpress pre-emption of some state laws, Congress if any-\nthing indicated it did not intend the FDCA to preclude\nrequirements arising from other sources. See Setser v.\nUnited States, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6\u20137)\n(applying principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius).\nPre-emption of some state requirements does not suggest\nan intent to preclude federal claims.\n  The structures of the FDCA and the Lanham Act rein-\nforce the conclusion drawn from the text. When two stat-\nutes complement each other, it would show disregard for\nthe congressional design to hold that Congress nonethe-\nless intended one federal statute to preclude the operation\nof the other. See J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-\nBred Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 144 (2001) (\u201c[W]e can plainly\nregard each statute as effective because of its different\nrequirements and protections\u201d); see also Wyeth, supra, at\n578\u2013579. The Lanham Act and the FDCA complement\neach other in major respects, for each has its own scope\nand purpose. Although both statutes touch on food and\nbeverage labeling, the Lanham Act protects commercial\ninterests against unfair competition, while the FDCA\nprotects public health and safety. Compare Lexmark, 572\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12\u201313), with 62 Cases of Jam, 340\nU. S., at 596. The two statutes impose \u201cdifferent require-\nments and protections.\u201d J. E. M. Ag Supply, supra, at 144.\n  The two statutes complement each other with respect to\nremedies in a more fundamental respect. Enforcement of\nthe FDCA and the detailed prescriptions of its implement-\ning regulations is largely committed to the FDA. The\nFDA, however, does not have the same perspective or\nexpertise in assessing market dynamics that day-to-day\ncompetitors possess. Competitors who manufacture or\ndistribute products have detailed knowledge regarding\nhow consumers rely upon certain sales and marketing\nstrategies. Their awareness of unfair competition prac-\n12        POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntices may be far more immediate and accurate than that of\nagency rulemakers and regulators. Lanham Act suits\ndraw upon this market expertise by empowering private\nparties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a\ncase-by-case basis. By \u201cserv[ing] a distinct compensatory\nfunction that may motivate injured persons to come for-\nward,\u201d Lanham Act suits, to the extent they touch on the\nsame subject matter as the FDCA, \u201cprovide incentives\u201d for\nmanufacturers to behave well. See id., at 579. Allowing\nLanham Act suits takes advantage of synergies among\nmultiple methods of regulation. This is quite consistent\nwith the congressional design to enact two different stat-\nutes, each with its own mechanisms to enhance the protec-\ntion of competitors and consumers.\n   A holding that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act claims\nchallenging food and beverage labels would not only ignore\nthe distinct functional aspects of the FDCA and the Lan-\nham Act but also would lead to a result that Congress\nlikely did not intend. Unlike other types of labels regu-\nlated by the FDA, such as drug labels, see 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(d), it would appear the FDA does not preapprove food\nand beverage labels under its regulations and instead\nrelies on enforcement actions, warning letters, and other\nmeasures. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\nin Opposition 16. Because the FDA acknowledges that it\ndoes not necessarily pursue enforcement measures regard-\ning all objectionable labels, ibid., if Lanham Act claims\nwere to be precluded then commercial interests\u2014and\nindirectly the public at large\u2014could be left with less effec-\ntive protection in the food and beverage labeling realm\nthan in many other, less regulated industries. It is un-\nlikely that Congress intended the FDCA\u2019s protection of\nhealth and safety to result in less policing of misleading\nfood and beverage labels than in competitive markets for\nother products.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              C\n\n   Coca-Cola argues the FDCA precludes POM\u2019s Lanham\nAct claim because Congress intended national uniformity\nin food and beverage labeling. Coca-Cola notes three\naspects of the FDCA to support that position: delegation of\nenforcement authority to the Federal Government rather\nthan private parties; express pre-emption with respect to\nstate laws; and the specificity of the FDCA and its imple-\nmenting regulations. But these details of the FDCA do\nnot establish an intent or design to preclude Lanham Act\nclaims.\n   Coca-Cola says that the FDCA\u2019s delegation of enforce-\nment authority to the Federal Government shows Con-\ngress\u2019 intent to achieve national uniformity in labeling.\nBut POM seeks to enforce the Lanham Act, not the FDCA\nor its regulations. The centralization of FDCA enforce-\nment authority in the Federal Government does not indi-\ncate that Congress intended to foreclose private enforce-\nment of other federal statutes.\n   Coca-Cola next appeals to the pre-emption provision\nadded to the FDCA in 1990. See \u00a7343\u20131. It argues that\nallowing Lanham Act claims to proceed would undermine\nthe pre-emption provision\u2019s goal of ensuring that food and\nbeverage manufacturers can market nationally without\nthe burden of complying with a patchwork of require-\nments. A significant flaw in this argument is that the pre-\nemption provision by its plain terms applies only to cer-\ntain state-law requirements, not to federal law. See Part\nII\u2013B, supra. Coca-Cola in effect asks the Court to ignore\nthe words \u201cState or political subdivision of a State\u201d in the\nstatute.\n   Even if it were proper to stray from the text in this way,\nit is far from clear that Coca-Cola\u2019s assertions about na-\ntional uniformity in fact reflect the congressional design.\nAlthough the application of a federal statute such as the\nLanham Act by judges and juries in courts throughout the\n14        POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncountry may give rise to some variation in outcome, this is\nthe means Congress chose to enforce a national policy to\nensure fair competition. It is quite different from the\ndisuniformity that would arise from the multitude of state\nlaws, state regulations, state administrative agency rul-\nings, and state-court decisions that are partially forbidden\nby the FDCA\u2019s pre-emption provision. Congress not infre-\nquently permits a certain amount of variability by author-\nizing a federal cause of action even in areas of law where\nnational uniformity is important. Compare Bonito Boats,\nInc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 162 (1989)\n(\u201cOne of the fundamental purposes behind the Patent and\nCopyright Clauses of the Constitution was to promote\nnational uniformity in the realm of intellectual property\u201d),\nwith 35 U. S. C. \u00a7281 (private right of action for patent\ninfringement); see Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 570 (\u201c[T]he [FDCA]\ncontemplates that federal juries will resolve most mis-\nbranding claims\u201d). The Lanham Act itself is an example of\nthis design: Despite Coca-Cola\u2019s protestations, the Act is\nuniform in extending its protection against unfair compe-\ntition to the whole class it describes. It is variable only to\nthe extent that those rights are enforced on a case-by-case\nbasis. The variability about which Coca-Cola complains is\nno different than the variability that any industry covered\nby the Lanham Act faces. And, as noted, Lanham Act\nactions are a means to implement a uniform policy to\nprohibit unfair competition in all covered markets.\n   Finally, Coca-Cola urges that the FDCA, and particu-\nlarly its implementing regulations, addresses food and bev-\nerage labeling with much more specificity than is found\nin the provisions of the Lanham Act. That is true. The\npages of FDA rulemakings devoted only to juice-blend\nlabeling attest to the level of detail with which the FDA\nhas examined the subject. E.g., Food Labeling; Declara-\ntion of Ingredients; Common or Usual Name for Non-\nstandardized Foods; Diluted Juice Beverages, 58 Fed. Reg.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n2897\u20132926 (1993). Because, as we have explained, the\nFDCA and the Lanham Act are complementary and have\nseparate scopes and purposes, this greater specificity\nwould matter only if the Lanham Act and the FDCA can-\nnot be implemented in full at the same time. See RadLAX\nGateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U. S. ___,\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 5\u20137). But neither the statutory\nstructure nor the empirical evidence of which the Court is\naware indicates there will be any difficulty in fully enforc-\ning each statute according to its terms. See Part II\u2013B,\nsupra.\n                               D\n  The Government disagrees with both Coca-Cola and\nPOM. It submits that a Lanham Act claim is precluded\n\u201cto the extent the FDCA or FDA regulations specifically\nrequire or authorize the challenged aspects of [the] label.\u201d\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11. Applying\nthat standard, the Government argues that POM may not\nbring a Lanham Act challenge to the name of Coca-Cola\u2019s\nproduct, but that other aspects of the label may be chal-\nlenged. That is because, the Government argues, the FDA\nregulations specifically authorize the names of juice\nblends but not the other aspects of the label that are at\nissue.\n  In addition to raising practical concerns about drawing\na distinction between regulations that \u201cspecifically . . .\nauthorize\u201d a course of conduct and those that merely\ntolerate that course, id., at 10\u201311, the flaw in the Govern-\nment\u2019s intermediate position is the same as that in Coca-\nCola\u2019s theory of the case. The Government assumes that\nthe FDCA and its regulations are at least in some circum-\nstances a ceiling on the regulation of food and beverage\nlabeling. But, as discussed above, Congress intended the\nLanham Act and the FDCA to complement each other with\nrespect to food and beverage labeling.\n16        POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government claims that the \u201cFDA\u2019s juice-naming\nregulation reflects the agency\u2019s \u2018weigh[ing of] the compet-\ning interests relevant to the particular requirement in\nquestion.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 19 (quoting Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518\nU. S. 470, 501 (1996)). The rulemaking indeed does al-\nlude, at one point, to a balancing of interests: It styles a\nparticular requirement as \u201cprovid[ing] manufacturers with\nflexibility for labeling products while providing consumers\nwith information that they need.\u201d 58 Fed. Reg. 2919\u2013\n2920. But that rulemaking does not discuss or even cite\nthe Lanham Act, and the Government cites no other\nstatement in the rulemaking suggesting that the FDA\nconsidered the full scope of the interests the Lanham Act\nprotects. In addition, and contrary to the language quoted\nabove, the FDA explicitly encouraged manufacturers to\ninclude material on their labels that is not required by the\nregulations. Id., at 2919. A single isolated reference to a\ndesire for flexibility is not sufficient to transform a rule-\nmaking that is otherwise at best inconclusive as to its\ninteraction with other federal laws into one with preclu-\nsive force, even on the assumption that a federal regula-\ntion in some instances might preclude application of a\nfederal statute. Cf. Williamson v. Mazda Motor of Amer-\nica, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10\u201311).\n   In addition, Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529\nU. S. 861 (2000), does not support the Government\u2019s ar-\ngument. In Geier, the agency enacted a regulation delib-\nerately allowing manufacturers to choose between differ-\nent options because the agency wanted to encourage\ndiversity in the industry. A subsequent lawsuit chal-\nlenged one of those choices. The Court concluded that the\naction was barred because it directly conflicted with the\nagency\u2019s policy choice to encourage flexibility to foster\ninnovation. Id., at 875. Here, by contrast, the FDA has\nnot made a policy judgment that is inconsistent with\nPOM\u2019s Lanham Act suit. This is not a case where a law-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuit is undermining an agency judgment, and in any event\nthe FDA does not have authority to enforce the Lanham\nAct.\n  It is necessary to recognize the implications of the United\nStates\u2019 argument for preclusion. The Government asks\nthe Court to preclude private parties from availing them-\nselves of a well-established federal remedy because an\nagency enacted regulations that touch on similar subject\nmatter but do not purport to displace that remedy or even\nimplement the statute that is its source. Even if agency\nregulations with the force of law that purport to bar other\nlegal remedies may do so, see id., at 874; see also Wyeth,\n555 U. S., at 576, it is a bridge too far to accept an agen-\ncy\u2019s after-the-fact statement to justify that result here. An\nagency may not reorder federal statutory rights without\ncongressional authorization.\n                        *     *   *\n  Coca-Cola and the United States ask the Court to ele-\nvate the FDCA and the FDA\u2019s regulations over the private\ncause of action authorized by the Lanham Act. But the\nFDCA and the Lanham Act complement each other in the\nfederal regulation of misleading labels. Congress did not\nintend the FDCA to preclude Lanham Act suits like\nPOM\u2019s. The position Coca-Cola takes in this Court that\nbecause food and beverage labeling is involved it has no\nLanham Act liability here for practices that allegedly\nmislead and trick consumers, all to the injury of competi-\ntors, finds no support in precedent or the statutes. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n</pre>",
