Argued March 24, 2014—Decided June 12, 2014\nWhen petitioners filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, they sought to exclude\n roughly $300,000 in an inherited individual retirement account (IRA)\n from the bankruptcy estate using the “retirement funds” exemption.\n See 11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(C). The Bankruptcy Court concluded that\n an inherited IRA does not share the same characteristics as a tradi-\n tional IRA and disallowed the exemption. The District Court re-\n versed, explaining that the exemption covers any account in which\n the funds were originally accumulated for retirement purposes. The\n Seventh Circuit disagreed and reversed the District Court.\nHeld: Funds held in inherited IRAs are not “retirement funds” within\n the meaning of §522(b)(3)(C). Pp. 4–11.\n    (a) The ordinary meaning of “retirement funds” is properly under-\n stood to be sums of money set aside for the day an individual stops\n working. Three legal characteristics of inherited IRAs provide objec-\n tive evidence that they do not contain such funds. First, the holder of\n an inherited IRA may never invest additional money in the account.\n 26 U. S. C. §219(d)(4). Second, holders of inherited IRAs are required\n to withdraw money from the accounts, no matter how far they are\n from retirement. §§408(a)(6), 401(a)(9)(B). Finally, the holder of an\n inherited IRA may withdraw the entire balance of the account at any\n time—and use it for any purpose—without penalty. Pp. 4–6.\n    (b) This reading is consistent with the purpose of the Bankruptcy\n Code’s exemption provisions, which effectuate a careful balance be-\n tween the creditor’s interest in recovering assets and the debtor’s in-\n terest in protecting essential needs. Allowing debtors to protect\n funds in traditional and Roth IRAs ensures that debtors will be able\n to meet their basic needs during their retirement years. By contrast,\n nothing about an inherited IRA’s legal characteristics prevent or dis-\n2                          CLARK v. RAMEKER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    courage an individual from using the entire balance immediately af-\n    ter bankruptcy for purposes of current consumption. The “retirement\n    funds” exemption should not be read in a manner that would convert\n    the bankruptcy objective of protecting debtors’ basic needs into a\n    “free pass,” Schwab v. Reilly, 560 U. S. 770, 791. Pp. 6–7.\n       (c) Petitioners’ counterarguments do not overcome the statute’s\n    text and purpose. Their claim that funds in an inherited IRA are re-\n    tirement funds because, at some point, they were set aside for re-\n    tirement, conflicts with ordinary usage and would render the term\n    “retirement funds,” as used in §522(b)(3)(C), superfluous. Congress\n    could have achieved the exact same result without specifying the\n    funds as “retirement funds.” And the absence of the phrase “debtor’s\n    interest,” which appears in many other §522 exemptions, does not in-\n    dicate that §522(b)(3)(C) covers funds intended for someone else’s re-\n    tirement. Where used, that phrase works to limit the value of the as-\n    set that the debtor may exempt from her estate, not to distinguish\n    between a debtor’s assets and the assets of another. Also unpersua-\n    sive is petitioners’ argument that §522(b)(3)(C)’s sentence structure—\n    i.e., a broad category, here, “retirement funds,” followed by limiting\n    language, here, “to the extent that”—prevents the broad category\n    from performing any independent limiting work. This is not the only\n    way in which the phrase “to the extent that” may be read, and this\n    argument reintroduces the problem that makes the term “retirement\n    funds” superfluous. Finally, the possibility that an account holder\n    can leave an inherited IRA intact until retirement and take only the\n    required minimum distributions does not mean that an inherited IRA\n    bears the legal characteristics of retirement funds.

RAMEKER, TRUSTEE, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 12, 2014] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  When an individual files for bankruptcy, she may ex­\nempt particular categories of assets from the bankruptcy\nestate. One such category includes certain “retirement\nfunds.” 11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(C). The question presented\nis whether funds contained in an inherited individual\nretirement account (IRA) qualify as “retirement funds”\nwithin the meaning of this bankruptcy exemption. We\nhold that they do not.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  When an individual debtor files a bankruptcy petition,\nher “legal or equitable interests . . . in property” become\npart of the bankruptcy estate. §541(a)(1). “To help the\ndebtor obtain a fresh start,” however, the Bankruptcy\nCode allows debtors to exempt from the estate limited\ninterests in certain kinds of property. Rousey v. Jacoway,\n544 U. S. 320, 325 (2005). The exemption at issue in this\ncase allows debtors to protect “retirement funds to the\nextent those funds are in a fund or account that is exempt\nfrom taxation under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457,\n2                       CLARK v. RAMEKER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nor 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.” §§522(b)(3)(C),\n(d)(12).1 The enumerated sections of the Internal Revenue\nCode cover many types of accounts, three of which are\nrelevant here.\n   The first two are traditional and Roth IRAs, which are\ncreated by 26 U. S. C. §408 and §408A, respectively. Both\ntypes of accounts offer tax advantages to encourage indi­\nviduals to save for retirement. Qualified contributions to\ntraditional IRAs, for example, are tax-deductible. §219(a).\nRoth IRAs offer the opposite benefit: Although contribu­\ntions are not tax-deductible, qualified distributions are\ntax-free. §§408A(c)(1), (d)(1). To ensure that both types of\nIRAs are used for retirement purposes and not as general\ntax-advantaged savings vehicles, Congress made certain\nwithdrawals from both types of accounts subject to a 10\npercent penalty if taken before an accountholder reaches\nthe age of 59½. See §§72(t)(1)–(2); see also n. 4, infra.\n   The third type of account relevant here is an inher-\nited IRA. An inherited IRA is a traditional or Roth IRA\nthat has been inherited after its owner’s death. See\n§§408(d)(3)(C)(ii), 408A(a). If the heir is the owner’s\nspouse, as is often the case, the spouse has a choice: He or\nshe may “roll over” the IRA funds into his or her own IRA,\nor he or she may keep the IRA as an inherited IRA (sub­\nject to the rules discussed below). See Internal Revenue\nService, Publication 590: Individual Retirement Arrange­\nments (IRAs), p. 18 (Jan. 5, 2014). When anyone other\nthan the owner’s spouse inherits the IRA, he or she may\nnot roll over the funds; the only option is to hold the IRA\n——————\n   1 Under §522, debtors may elect to claim exemptions either under\n\nfederal law, see §522(b)(2), or state law, see §522(b)(3). Both tracks\npermit debtors to exempt “retirement funds.” See §522(b)(3)(C) (re­\ntirement funds exemption for debtors proceeding under state law);\n§522(d)(12) (identical exemption for debtors proceeding under federal\nlaw). Petitioners elected to proceed under state law, so we refer to\n§522(b)(3)(C) throughout.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nas an inherited account.\n   Inherited IRAs do not operate like ordinary IRAs. Un­\nlike with a traditional or Roth IRA, an individual may\nwithdraw funds from an inherited IRA at any time, with­\nout paying a tax penalty. §72(t)(2)(A)(ii). Indeed, the\nowner of an inherited IRA not only may but must with­\ndraw its funds: The owner must either withdraw the\nentire balance in the account within five years of the\noriginal owner’s death or take minimum distributions on\nan annual basis. See §§408(a)(6), 401(a)(9)(B); 26 CFR\n§1.408–8 (2013) (Q–1 and A–1(a) incorporating\n§1.401(a)(9)–3 (Q–1 and A–1(a))); see generally D. Car­\ntano, Taxation of Individual Retirement Accounts\n§32.02[A] (2013). And unlike with a traditional or Roth\nIRA, the owner of an inherited IRA may never make con­\ntributions to the account. 26 U. S. C. §219(d)(4).\n                             B\n   In 2000, Ruth Heffron established a traditional IRA and\nnamed her daughter, Heidi Heffron-Clark, as the sole\nbeneficiary of the account. When Ms. Heffron died in\n2001, her IRA—which was then worth just over\n$450,000—passed to her daughter and became an inherited\nIRA. Ms. Heffron-Clark elected to take monthly distri­\nbutions from the account.\n   In October 2010, Ms. Heffron-Clark and her husband,\npetitioners in this Court, filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\npetition. They identified the inherited IRA, by then worth\nroughly $300,000, as exempt from the bankruptcy estate\nunder 11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(C). Respondents, the bank­\nruptcy trustee and unsecured creditors of the estate, ob­\njected to the claimed exemption on the ground that the\nfunds in the inherited IRA were not “retirement funds”\nwithin the meaning of the statute.\n   The Bankruptcy Court agreed, disallowing the exemp­\ntion. In re Clark, 450 B. R. 858, 866 (WD Wisc. 2011).\n4                       CLARK v. RAMEKER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nRelying on the “plain language of §522(b)(3)(C),” the court\nconcluded that an inherited IRA “does not contain any-\none’s ‘retirement funds,’ ” because unlike with a traditional\nIRA, the funds are not “segregated to meet the needs of,\nnor distributed on the occasion of, any person’s retire­\nment.” Id., at 863.2 The District Court reversed, explain­\ning that the exemption covers any account containing\nfunds “originally” “accumulated for retirement purposes.”\nIn re Clark, 466 B. R. 135, 139 (WD Wisc. 2012). The\nSeventh Circuit reversed the District Court’s judgment.\nIn re Clark, 714 F. 3d 559 (2013). Pointing to the “[d]if-\nferent rules govern[ing] inherited” and noninherited IRAs,\nthe court concluded that “inherited IRAs represent an\nopportunity for current consumption, not a fund of retire­\nment savings.” Id., at 560, 562.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between the\nSeventh Circuit’s ruling and the Fifth Circuit’s decision in\nIn re Chilton, 674 F. 3d 486 (2012). 571 U. S. ___ (2013).\nWe now affirm.\n                             II\n  The text and purpose of the Bankruptcy Code make\nclear that funds held in inherited IRAs are not “retirement\nfunds” within the meaning of §522(b)(3)(C)’s bankruptcy\nexemption.\n                           A\n  The Bankruptcy Code does not define “retirement\nfunds,” so we give the term its ordinary meaning. See\n——————\n    2 The\n       Bankruptcy Court also concluded in the alternative that, even if\nfunds in an inherited IRA qualify as retirement funds within the\nmeaning of §522(b)(3)(C), an inherited IRA is not exempt from taxation\nunder any of the Internal Revenue Code sections listed in the provision.\nSee 450 B. R., at 865. Because we hold that inherited IRAs are not\nretirement funds to begin with, we have no occasion to pass on the\nBankruptcy Court’s alternative ground for disallowing petitioners’\nexemption.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nOctane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7). The ordinary meaning\nof “fund[s]” is “sum[s] of money . . . set aside for a specific\npurpose.” American Heritage Dictionary 712 (4th ed.\n2000). And “retirement” means “[w]ithdrawal from one’s\noccupation, business, or office.” Id., at 1489. Section\n522(b)(3)(C)’s reference to “retirement funds” is therefore\nproperly understood to mean sums of money set aside for\nthe day an individual stops working.\n   The parties agree that, in deciding whether a given set\nof funds falls within this definition, the inquiry must be an\nobjective one, not one that “turns on the debtor’s subjec­\ntive purpose.” Brief for Petitioners 43–44; see also Brief\nfor Respondents 26. In other words, to determine whether\nfunds in an account qualify as “retirement funds,” courts\nshould not engage in a case-by-case, fact-intensive exami­\nnation into whether the debtor actually planned to use the\nfunds for retirement purposes as opposed to current con­\nsumption. Instead, we look to the legal characteristics of\nthe account in which the funds are held, asking whether,\nas an objective matter, the account is one set aside for the\nday when an individual stops working. Cf. Rousey, 544\nU. S., at 332 (holding that traditional IRAs are included\nwithin §522(d)(10)(E)’s exemption for “a payment under a\nstock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar\nplan or contract on account of . . . age” based on the legal\ncharacteristics of traditional IRAs).\n   Three legal characteristics of inherited IRAs lead us to\nconclude that funds held in such accounts are not objec­\ntively set aside for the purpose of retirement. First, the\nholder of an inherited IRA may never invest additional\nmoney in the account. 26 U. S. C. §219(d)(4). Inherited\nIRAs are thus unlike traditional and Roth IRAs, both of\nwhich are quintessential “retirement funds.” For where\ninherited IRAs categorically prohibit contributions, the\nentire purpose of traditional and Roth IRAs is to provide\n6                    CLARK v. RAMEKER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntax incentives for accountholders to contribute regularly\nand over time to their retirement savings.\n   Second, holders of inherited IRAs are required to with­\ndraw money from such accounts, no matter how many\nyears they may be from retirement. Under the Tax Code,\nthe beneficiary of an inherited IRA must either withdraw\nall of the funds in the IRA within five years after the year\nof the owner’s death or take minimum annual distribu­\ntions every year. See §408(a)(6); §401(a)(9)(B); 26 CFR\n§1.408–8 (Q–1 and A–1(a) incorporating §1.401(a)(9)–3\n(Q–1 and A–1(a))). Here, for example, petitioners elected\nto take yearly distributions from the inherited IRA; as a\nresult, the account decreased in value from roughly\n$450,000 to less than $300,000 within 10 years. That the\ntax rules governing inherited IRAs routinely lead to their\ndiminution over time, regardless of their holders’ proxim­\nity to retirement, is hardly a feature one would expect of an\naccount set aside for retirement.\n   Finally, the holder of an inherited IRA may withdraw\nthe entire balance of the account at any time—and for any\npurpose—without penalty. Whereas a withdrawal from a\ntraditional or Roth IRA prior to the age of 59½ triggers a\n10 percent tax penalty subject to narrow exceptions, see\nn. 4, infra—a rule that encourages individuals to leave\nsuch funds untouched until retirement age—there is no\nsimilar limit on the holder of an inherited IRA. Funds\nheld in inherited IRAs accordingly constitute “a pot of\nmoney that can be freely used for current consumption,”\n714 F. 3d., at 561, not funds objectively set aside for one’s\nretirement.\n                             B\n  Our reading of the text is consistent with the purpose of\nthe Bankruptcy Code’s exemption provisions. As a general\nmatter, those provisions effectuate a careful balance be­\ntween the interests of creditors and debtors. On the one\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhand, we have noted that “every asset the Code permits a\ndebtor to withdraw from the estate is an asset that is not\navailable to . . . creditors.” Schwab v. Reilly, 560 U. S.\n770, 791 (2010). On the other hand, exemptions serve\nthe important purpose of “protect[ing] the debtor’s essen­\ntial needs.” United States v. Security Industrial Bank,\n459 U. S. 70, 83 (1982) (Blackmun, J., concurring in\njudgment).3\n   Allowing debtors to protect funds held in traditional and\nRoth IRAs comports with this purpose by helping to en­\nsure that debtors will be able to meet their basic needs\nduring their retirement years. At the same time, the legal\nlimitations on traditional and Roth IRAs ensure that\ndebtors who hold such accounts (but who have not yet\nreached retirement age) do not enjoy a cash windfall by\nvirtue of the exemption—such debtors are instead re­\nquired to wait until age 59½ before they may withdraw\nthe funds penalty-free.\n   The same cannot be said of an inherited IRA. For if an\nindividual is allowed to exempt an inherited IRA from her\nbankruptcy estate, nothing about the inherited IRA’s legal\ncharacteristics would prevent (or even discourage) the\nindividual from using the entire balance of the account on\na vacation home or sports car immediately after her bank­\nruptcy proceedings are complete. Allowing that kind of\nexemption would convert the Bankruptcy Code’s purposes\nof preserving debtors’ ability to meet their basic needs and\nensuring that they have a “fresh start,” Rousey, 544 U. S.,\nat 325, into a “free pass,” Schwab, 560 U. S., at 791. We\ndecline to read the retirement funds provision in that\nmanner.\n——————\n  3 As the House Judiciary Committee explained in the process of enact­\n\ning §522, “[t]he historical purpose” of bankruptcy exemptions has been\nto provide a debtor “with the basic necessities of life” so that she “will\nnot be left destitute and a public charge.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–595, p. 126\n(1977).\n8                    CLARK v. RAMEKER \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              III\n\n   Although petitioners’ counterarguments are not without\nforce, they do not overcome the statute’s text and purpose.\n   Petitioners’ primary argument is that funds in an inher­\nited IRA are retirement funds because—regardless of\nwhether they currently sit in an account bearing the legal\ncharacteristics of a fund set aside for retirement—they did\nso at an earlier moment in time. After all, petitioners\npoint out, “the initial owner” of the account “set aside the\nfunds in question for retirement by depositing them in a”\ntraditional or Roth IRA. Brief for Petitioners 21. And\n“[t]he [initial] owner’s death does not in any way affect the\nfunds in the account.” Ibid.\n   We disagree. In ordinary usage, to speak of a person’s\n“retirement funds” implies that the funds are currently in\nan account set aside for retirement, not that they were set\naside for that purpose at some prior date by an entirely\ndifferent person. Under petitioners’ contrary logic, if an\nindividual withdraws money from a traditional IRA and\ngives it to a friend who then deposits it into a checking\naccount, that money should be forever deemed “retirement\nfunds” because it was originally set aside for retirement.\nThat is plainly incorrect.\n   More fundamentally, the backward-looking inquiry\nurged by petitioners would render a substantial portion of\n11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(C)’s text superfluous. The funds\ncontained in every individual-held account exempt from\ntaxation under the Tax Code provisions enumerated in\n§522(b)(3)(C) have been, at some point in time, “retirement\nfunds.” So on petitioners’ view, rather than defining the\nexemption to cover “retirement funds to the extent that\nthose funds are in a fund or account that is exempt from\ntaxation under [the enumerated sections] of the Internal\nRevenue Code,” Congress could have achieved the exact\nsame result through a provision covering any “fund or\naccount that is exempt from taxation under [the enumer­\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nated sections].” In other words, §522(b)(3)(C) requires that\nfunds satisfy not one but two conditions in order to be\nexempt: the funds must be “retirement funds,” and they\nmust be held in a covered account. Petitioners’ reading\nwould write out of the statute the first element. It there­\nfore flouts the rule that “ ‘a statute should be construed so\nthat effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will\nbe inoperative or superfluous.’ ” Corley v. United States,\n556 U. S. 303, 314 (2009).\n   Petitioners respond that many of §522’s other exemp­\ntions refer to the “debtor’s interest” in various kinds of\nproperty. See, e.g., §522(d)(2) (exempting “[t]he debtor’s\ninterest, not to exceed [$3,675] in value, in one motor\nvehicle”). Section 522(b)(3)(C)’s retirement funds exemp­\ntion, by contrast, includes no such reference. As a result,\npetitioners surmise, Congress must have meant the provi­\nsion to cover funds that were at one time retirement ac­\ncounts, even if they were for someone else’s retirement.\nBrief for Petitioners 33–34. But Congress used the phrase\n“debtor’s interest” in the other exemptions in a different\nmanner—not to distinguish between a debtor’s assets and\nthe assets of another person but to set a limit on the value\nof the particular asset that a debtor may exempt. For\nexample, the statute allows a debtor to protect “[t]he\ndebtor’s aggregate interest, not to exceed [$1,550] in value,\nin jewelry.” §522(d)(4). The phrase “[t]he debtor’s aggre­\ngate interest” in this provision is just a means of introduc­\ning the $1,550 limit; it is not a means of preventing debt­\nors from exempting other persons’ jewelry from their own\nbankruptcy proceedings (an interpretation that would\nserve little apparent purpose). And Congress had no\nneed to use the same “debtor’s interest” formulation in\n§522(b)(3)(C) for the simple reason that it imposed a value\nlimitation on the amount of exemptible retirement funds\nin a separate provision, §522(n).\n   Petitioners next contend that even if their interpreta­\n10                  CLARK v. RAMEKER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of “ ‘retirement funds’ does not independently exclude\nanything from the scope of the statute,” that poses no\nproblem because Congress actually intended that result.\nReply Brief 5–6. In particular, petitioners suggest that\nwhen a sentence is structured as §522(b)(3)(C) is—starting\nwith a broad category (“retirement funds”), then winnow­\ning it down through limiting language (“to the extent that”\nthe funds are held in a particular type of account)—it is\noften the case that the broad category does no independent\nlimiting work. As counsel for petitioners noted at oral\nargument, if a tax were to apply to “sports teams to the\nextent that they are members of the major professional\nsports leagues,” the phrase “sports teams” would not\nprovide any additional limitation on the covered entities.\nTr. of Oral Arg. 15.\n   There are two problems with this argument. First,\nwhile it is possible to conceive of sentences that use\n§522(b)(3)(C)’s “to the extent that” construction in a man­\nner where the initial broad category serves no exclusion­\nary purpose, that is not the only way in which the phrase\nmay be used. For example, a tax break that applies to\n“nonprofit organizations to the extent that they are medi­\ncal or scientific” would not apply to a for-profit pharma­\nceutical company because the initial broad category (“non­\nprofit organizations”) provides its own limitation. Just so\nhere; in order to qualify for bankruptcy protection under\n§522(b)(3)(C), funds must be both “retirement funds” and\nin an account exempt from taxation under one of the\nenumerated Tax Code sections.\n   Second, to accept petitioners’ argument would reintro­\nduce the surplusage problem already discussed. Supra, at\n8–9. And although petitioners are correct that “the only\neffect of respondents’ interpretation of ‘retirement funds’\nwould seemingly be to deny bankruptcy exemption to\ninherited IRAs,” Reply Brief 2, as between one interpreta­\ntion that would render statutory text superfluous and\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                 11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nanother that would render it meaningful yet limited, we\nthink the latter more faithful to the statute Congress\nwrote.\n  Finally, petitioners argue that even under the inquiry\nwe have described, funds in inherited IRAs should still\nqualify as “retirement funds” because the holder of such\nan account can leave much of its value intact until her\nretirement if she invests wisely and chooses to take only\nthe minimum annual distributions required by law. See\nBrief for Petitioners 27–28. But the possibility that some\ninvestors may use their inherited IRAs for retirement\npurposes does not mean that inherited IRAs bear the\ndefining legal characteristics of retirement funds. Were it\nany other way, money in an ordinary checking account (or,\nfor that matter, an envelope of $20 bills) would also\namount to “retirement funds” because it is possible for an\nowner to use those funds for retirement.4\n                      *    *     *\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is\naffirmed.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   4 Petitioners also argue that inherited IRAs are similar enough to\n\nRoth IRAs to qualify as retirement funds because “the owner of a Roth\nIRA may withdraw his contributions . . . without penalty.” Brief for\nPetitioners 44. But that argument fails to recognize that withdrawals\nof contributions to a Roth IRA are not subject to the 10 percent tax\npenalty for the unique reason that the contributions have already been\ntaxed. By contrast, all capital gains and investment income in a Roth\nIRA are subject to the pre-59½ withdrawal penalty (with narrow\nexceptions for, for example, medical expenses), which incentivizes use\nof those funds only in one’s retirement years.\n</pre>", "id": 2678134, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/06/12/clark_v._rameker.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 24, 2014—Decided June 12, 2014\nWhen petitioners filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, they sought to exclude\n roughly $300,000 in an inherited individual retirement account (IRA)\n from the bankruptcy estate using the “retirement funds” exemption.\n See 11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(C). The Bankruptcy Court concluded that\n an inherited IRA does not share the same characteristics as a tradi-\n tional IRA and disallowed the exemption. The District Court re-\n versed, explaining that the exemption covers any account in which\n the funds were originally accumulated for retirement purposes. The\n Seventh Circuit disagreed and reversed the District Court.\nHeld: Funds held in inherited IRAs are not “retirement funds” within\n the meaning of §522(b)(3)(C). Pp. 4–11.\n    (a) The ordinary meaning of “retirement funds” is properly under-\n stood to be sums of money set aside for the day an individual stops\n working. Three legal characteristics of inherited IRAs provide objec-\n tive evidence that they do not contain such funds. First, the holder of\n an inherited IRA may never invest additional money in the account.\n 26 U. S. C. §219(d)(4). Second, holders of inherited IRAs are required\n to withdraw money from the accounts, no matter how far they are\n from retirement. §§408(a)(6), 401(a)(9)(B). Finally, the holder of an\n inherited IRA may withdraw the entire balance of the account at any\n time—and use it for any purpose—without penalty. Pp. 4–6.\n    (b) This reading is consistent with the purpose of the Bankruptcy\n Code’s exemption provisions, which effectuate a careful balance be-\n tween the creditor’s interest in recovering assets and the debtor’s in-\n terest in protecting essential needs. Allowing debtors to protect\n funds in traditional and Roth IRAs ensures that debtors will be able\n to meet their basic needs during their retirement years. By contrast,\n nothing about an inherited IRA’s legal characteristics prevent or dis-\n2                          CLARK v. RAMEKER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    courage an individual from using the entire balance immediately af-\n    ter bankruptcy for purposes of current consumption. The “retirement\n    funds” exemption should not be read in a manner that would convert\n    the bankruptcy objective of protecting debtors’ basic needs into a\n    “free pass,” Schwab v. Reilly, 560 U. S. 770, 791. Pp. 6–7.\n       (c) Petitioners’ counterarguments do not overcome the statute’s\n    text and purpose. Their claim that funds in an inherited IRA are re-\n    tirement funds because, at some point, they were set aside for re-\n    tirement, conflicts with ordinary usage and would render the term\n    “retirement funds,” as used in §522(b)(3)(C), superfluous. Congress\n    could have achieved the exact same result without specifying the\n    funds as “retirement funds.” And the absence of the phrase “debtor’s\n    interest,” which appears in many other §522 exemptions, does not in-\n    dicate that §522(b)(3)(C) covers funds intended for someone else’s re-\n    tirement. Where used, that phrase works to limit the value of the as-\n    set that the debtor may exempt from her estate, not to distinguish\n    between a debtor’s assets and the assets of another. Also unpersua-\n    sive is petitioners’ argument that §522(b)(3)(C)’s sentence structure—\n    i.e., a broad category, here, “retirement funds,” followed by limiting\n    language, here, “to the extent that”—prevents the broad category\n    from performing any independent limiting work. This is not the only\n    way in which the phrase “to the extent that” may be read, and this\n    argument reintroduces the problem that makes the term “retirement\n    funds” superfluous. Finally, the possibility that an account holder\n    can leave an inherited IRA intact until retirement and take only the\n    required minimum distributions does not mean that an inherited IRA\n    bears the legal characteristics of retirement funds.

RAMEKER, TRUSTEE, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 12, 2014] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  When an individual files for bankruptcy, she may ex­\nempt particular categories of assets from the bankruptcy\nestate. One such category includes certain “retirement\nfunds.” 11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(C). The question presented\nis whether funds contained in an inherited individual\nretirement account (IRA) qualify as “retirement funds”\nwithin the meaning of this bankruptcy exemption. We\nhold that they do not.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  When an individual debtor files a bankruptcy petition,\nher “legal or equitable interests . . . in property” become\npart of the bankruptcy estate. §541(a)(1). “To help the\ndebtor obtain a fresh start,” however, the Bankruptcy\nCode allows debtors to exempt from the estate limited\ninterests in certain kinds of property. Rousey v. Jacoway,\n544 U. S. 320, 325 (2005). The exemption at issue in this\ncase allows debtors to protect “retirement funds to the\nextent those funds are in a fund or account that is exempt\nfrom taxation under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457,\n2                       CLARK v. RAMEKER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nor 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.” §§522(b)(3)(C),\n(d)(12).1 The enumerated sections of the Internal Revenue\nCode cover many types of accounts, three of which are\nrelevant here.\n   The first two are traditional and Roth IRAs, which are\ncreated by 26 U. S. C. §408 and §408A, respectively. Both\ntypes of accounts offer tax advantages to encourage indi­\nviduals to save for retirement. Qualified contributions to\ntraditional IRAs, for example, are tax-deductible. §219(a).\nRoth IRAs offer the opposite benefit: Although contribu­\ntions are not tax-deductible, qualified distributions are\ntax-free. §§408A(c)(1), (d)(1). To ensure that both types of\nIRAs are used for retirement purposes and not as general\ntax-advantaged savings vehicles, Congress made certain\nwithdrawals from both types of accounts subject to a 10\npercent penalty if taken before an accountholder reaches\nthe age of 59½. See §§72(t)(1)–(2); see also n. 4, infra.\n   The third type of account relevant here is an inher-\nited IRA. An inherited IRA is a traditional or Roth IRA\nthat has been inherited after its owner’s death. See\n§§408(d)(3)(C)(ii), 408A(a). If the heir is the owner’s\nspouse, as is often the case, the spouse has a choice: He or\nshe may “roll over” the IRA funds into his or her own IRA,\nor he or she may keep the IRA as an inherited IRA (sub­\nject to the rules discussed below). See Internal Revenue\nService, Publication 590: Individual Retirement Arrange­\nments (IRAs), p. 18 (Jan. 5, 2014). When anyone other\nthan the owner’s spouse inherits the IRA, he or she may\nnot roll over the funds; the only option is to hold the IRA\n——————\n   1 Under §522, debtors may elect to claim exemptions either under\n\nfederal law, see §522(b)(2), or state law, see §522(b)(3). Both tracks\npermit debtors to exempt “retirement funds.” See §522(b)(3)(C) (re­\ntirement funds exemption for debtors proceeding under state law);\n§522(d)(12) (identical exemption for debtors proceeding under federal\nlaw). Petitioners elected to proceed under state law, so we refer to\n§522(b)(3)(C) throughout.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nas an inherited account.\n   Inherited IRAs do not operate like ordinary IRAs. Un­\nlike with a traditional or Roth IRA, an individual may\nwithdraw funds from an inherited IRA at any time, with­\nout paying a tax penalty. §72(t)(2)(A)(ii). Indeed, the\nowner of an inherited IRA not only may but must with­\ndraw its funds: The owner must either withdraw the\nentire balance in the account within five years of the\noriginal owner’s death or take minimum distributions on\nan annual basis. See §§408(a)(6), 401(a)(9)(B); 26 CFR\n§1.408–8 (2013) (Q–1 and A–1(a) incorporating\n§1.401(a)(9)–3 (Q–1 and A–1(a))); see generally D. Car­\ntano, Taxation of Individual Retirement Accounts\n§32.02[A] (2013). And unlike with a traditional or Roth\nIRA, the owner of an inherited IRA may never make con­\ntributions to the account. 26 U. S. C. §219(d)(4).\n                             B\n   In 2000, Ruth Heffron established a traditional IRA and\nnamed her daughter, Heidi Heffron-Clark, as the sole\nbeneficiary of the account. When Ms. Heffron died in\n2001, her IRA—which was then worth just over\n$450,000—passed to her daughter and became an inherited\nIRA. Ms. Heffron-Clark elected to take monthly distri­\nbutions from the account.\n   In October 2010, Ms. Heffron-Clark and her husband,\npetitioners in this Court, filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\npetition. They identified the inherited IRA, by then worth\nroughly $300,000, as exempt from the bankruptcy estate\nunder 11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(C). Respondents, the bank­\nruptcy trustee and unsecured creditors of the estate, ob­\njected to the claimed exemption on the ground that the\nfunds in the inherited IRA were not “retirement funds”\nwithin the meaning of the statute.\n   The Bankruptcy Court agreed, disallowing the exemp­\ntion. In re Clark, 450 B. R. 858, 866 (WD Wisc. 2011).\n4                       CLARK v. RAMEKER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nRelying on the “plain language of §522(b)(3)(C),” the court\nconcluded that an inherited IRA “does not contain any-\none’s ‘retirement funds,’ ” because unlike with a traditional\nIRA, the funds are not “segregated to meet the needs of,\nnor distributed on the occasion of, any person’s retire­\nment.” Id., at 863.2 The District Court reversed, explain­\ning that the exemption covers any account containing\nfunds “originally” “accumulated for retirement purposes.”\nIn re Clark, 466 B. R. 135, 139 (WD Wisc. 2012). The\nSeventh Circuit reversed the District Court’s judgment.\nIn re Clark, 714 F. 3d 559 (2013). Pointing to the “[d]if-\nferent rules govern[ing] inherited” and noninherited IRAs,\nthe court concluded that “inherited IRAs represent an\nopportunity for current consumption, not a fund of retire­\nment savings.” Id., at 560, 562.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between the\nSeventh Circuit’s ruling and the Fifth Circuit’s decision in\nIn re Chilton, 674 F. 3d 486 (2012). 571 U. S. ___ (2013).\nWe now affirm.\n                             II\n  The text and purpose of the Bankruptcy Code make\nclear that funds held in inherited IRAs are not “retirement\nfunds” within the meaning of §522(b)(3)(C)’s bankruptcy\nexemption.\n                           A\n  The Bankruptcy Code does not define “retirement\nfunds,” so we give the term its ordinary meaning. See\n——————\n    2 The\n       Bankruptcy Court also concluded in the alternative that, even if\nfunds in an inherited IRA qualify as retirement funds within the\nmeaning of §522(b)(3)(C), an inherited IRA is not exempt from taxation\nunder any of the Internal Revenue Code sections listed in the provision.\nSee 450 B. R., at 865. Because we hold that inherited IRAs are not\nretirement funds to begin with, we have no occasion to pass on the\nBankruptcy Court’s alternative ground for disallowing petitioners’\nexemption.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nOctane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7). The ordinary meaning\nof “fund[s]” is “sum[s] of money . . . set aside for a specific\npurpose.” American Heritage Dictionary 712 (4th ed.\n2000). And “retirement” means “[w]ithdrawal from one’s\noccupation, business, or office.” Id., at 1489. Section\n522(b)(3)(C)’s reference to “retirement funds” is therefore\nproperly understood to mean sums of money set aside for\nthe day an individual stops working.\n   The parties agree that, in deciding whether a given set\nof funds falls within this definition, the inquiry must be an\nobjective one, not one that “turns on the debtor’s subjec­\ntive purpose.” Brief for Petitioners 43–44; see also Brief\nfor Respondents 26. In other words, to determine whether\nfunds in an account qualify as “retirement funds,” courts\nshould not engage in a case-by-case, fact-intensive exami­\nnation into whether the debtor actually planned to use the\nfunds for retirement purposes as opposed to current con­\nsumption. Instead, we look to the legal characteristics of\nthe account in which the funds are held, asking whether,\nas an objective matter, the account is one set aside for the\nday when an individual stops working. Cf. Rousey, 544\nU. S., at 332 (holding that traditional IRAs are included\nwithin §522(d)(10)(E)’s exemption for “a payment under a\nstock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar\nplan or contract on account of . . . age” based on the legal\ncharacteristics of traditional IRAs).\n   Three legal characteristics of inherited IRAs lead us to\nconclude that funds held in such accounts are not objec­\ntively set aside for the purpose of retirement. First, the\nholder of an inherited IRA may never invest additional\nmoney in the account. 26 U. S. C. §219(d)(4). Inherited\nIRAs are thus unlike traditional and Roth IRAs, both of\nwhich are quintessential “retirement funds.” For where\ninherited IRAs categorically prohibit contributions, the\nentire purpose of traditional and Roth IRAs is to provide\n6                    CLARK v. RAMEKER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntax incentives for accountholders to contribute regularly\nand over time to their retirement savings.\n   Second, holders of inherited IRAs are required to with­\ndraw money from such accounts, no matter how many\nyears they may be from retirement. Under the Tax Code,\nthe beneficiary of an inherited IRA must either withdraw\nall of the funds in the IRA within five years after the year\nof the owner’s death or take minimum annual distribu­\ntions every year. See §408(a)(6); §401(a)(9)(B); 26 CFR\n§1.408–8 (Q–1 and A–1(a) incorporating §1.401(a)(9)–3\n(Q–1 and A–1(a))). Here, for example, petitioners elected\nto take yearly distributions from the inherited IRA; as a\nresult, the account decreased in value from roughly\n$450,000 to less than $300,000 within 10 years. That the\ntax rules governing inherited IRAs routinely lead to their\ndiminution over time, regardless of their holders’ proxim­\nity to retirement, is hardly a feature one would expect of an\naccount set aside for retirement.\n   Finally, the holder of an inherited IRA may withdraw\nthe entire balance of the account at any time—and for any\npurpose—without penalty. Whereas a withdrawal from a\ntraditional or Roth IRA prior to the age of 59½ triggers a\n10 percent tax penalty subject to narrow exceptions, see\nn. 4, infra—a rule that encourages individuals to leave\nsuch funds untouched until retirement age—there is no\nsimilar limit on the holder of an inherited IRA. Funds\nheld in inherited IRAs accordingly constitute “a pot of\nmoney that can be freely used for current consumption,”\n714 F. 3d., at 561, not funds objectively set aside for one’s\nretirement.\n                             B\n  Our reading of the text is consistent with the purpose of\nthe Bankruptcy Code’s exemption provisions. As a general\nmatter, those provisions effectuate a careful balance be­\ntween the interests of creditors and debtors. On the one\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhand, we have noted that “every asset the Code permits a\ndebtor to withdraw from the estate is an asset that is not\navailable to . . . creditors.” Schwab v. Reilly, 560 U. S.\n770, 791 (2010). On the other hand, exemptions serve\nthe important purpose of “protect[ing] the debtor’s essen­\ntial needs.” United States v. Security Industrial Bank,\n459 U. S. 70, 83 (1982) (Blackmun, J., concurring in\njudgment).3\n   Allowing debtors to protect funds held in traditional and\nRoth IRAs comports with this purpose by helping to en­\nsure that debtors will be able to meet their basic needs\nduring their retirement years. At the same time, the legal\nlimitations on traditional and Roth IRAs ensure that\ndebtors who hold such accounts (but who have not yet\nreached retirement age) do not enjoy a cash windfall by\nvirtue of the exemption—such debtors are instead re­\nquired to wait until age 59½ before they may withdraw\nthe funds penalty-free.\n   The same cannot be said of an inherited IRA. For if an\nindividual is allowed to exempt an inherited IRA from her\nbankruptcy estate, nothing about the inherited IRA’s legal\ncharacteristics would prevent (or even discourage) the\nindividual from using the entire balance of the account on\na vacation home or sports car immediately after her bank­\nruptcy proceedings are complete. Allowing that kind of\nexemption would convert the Bankruptcy Code’s purposes\nof preserving debtors’ ability to meet their basic needs and\nensuring that they have a “fresh start,” Rousey, 544 U. S.,\nat 325, into a “free pass,” Schwab, 560 U. S., at 791. We\ndecline to read the retirement funds provision in that\nmanner.\n——————\n  3 As the House Judiciary Committee explained in the process of enact­\n\ning §522, “[t]he historical purpose” of bankruptcy exemptions has been\nto provide a debtor “with the basic necessities of life” so that she “will\nnot be left destitute and a public charge.” H.

After all, petitioners\npoint out, “the initial owner” of the account “set aside the\nfunds in question for retirement by depositing them in a”\ntraditional or Roth IRA. Brief for Petitioners 21. And\n“[t]he [initial] owner’s death does not in any way affect the\nfunds in the account.” Ibid.\n   We disagree. In ordinary usage, to speak of a person’s\n“retirement funds” implies that the funds are currently in\nan account set aside for retirement, not that they were set\naside for that purpose at some prior date by an entirely\ndifferent person. Under petitioners’ contrary logic, if an\nindividual withdraws money from a traditional IRA and\ngives it to a friend who then deposits it into a checking\naccount, that money should be forever deemed “retirement\nfunds” because it was originally set aside for retirement.\nThat is plainly incorrect.\n   More fundamentally, the backward-looking inquiry\nurged by petitioners would render a substantial portion of\n11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(C)’s text superfluous. The funds\ncontained in every individual-held account exempt from\ntaxation under the Tax Code provisions enumerated in\n§522(b)(3)(C) have been, at some point in time, “retirement\nfunds.” So on petitioners’ view, rather than defining the\nexemption to cover “retirement funds to the extent that\nthose funds are in a fund or account that is exempt from\ntaxation under [the enumerated sections] of the Internal\nRevenue Code,” Congress could have achieved the exact\nsame result through a provision covering any “fund or\naccount that is exempt from taxation under [the enumer­\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nated sections].” In other words, §522(b)(3)(C) requires that\nfunds satisfy not one but two conditions in order to be\nexempt: the funds must be “retirement funds,” and they\nmust be held in a covered account. Petitioners’ reading\nwould write out of the statute the first element. It there­\nfore flouts the rule that “ ‘a statute should be construed so\nthat effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will\nbe inoperative or superfluous.’ ” Corley v. United States,\n556 U. S. 303, 314 (2009).\n   Petitioners respond that many of §522’s other exemp­\ntions refer to the “debtor’s interest” in various kinds of\nproperty. See, e.g., §522(d)(2) (exempting “[t]he debtor’s\ninterest, not to exceed [$3,675] in value, in one motor\nvehicle”). Section 522(b)(3)(C)’s retirement funds exemp­\ntion, by contrast, includes no such reference. As a result,\npetitioners surmise, Congress must have meant the provi­\nsion to cover funds that were at one time retirement ac­\ncounts, even if they were for someone else’s retirement.\nBrief for Petitioners 33–34. But Congress used the phrase\n“debtor’s interest” in the other exemptions in a different\nmanner—not to distinguish between a debtor’s assets and\nthe assets of another person but to set a limit on the value\nof the particular asset that a debtor may exempt. For\nexample, the statute allows a debtor to protect “[t]he\ndebtor’s aggregate interest, not to exceed [$1,550] in value,\nin jewelry.” §522(d)(4). The phrase “[t]he debtor’s aggre­\ngate interest” in this provision is just a means of introduc­\ning the $1,550 limit; it is not a means of preventing debt­\nors from exempting other persons’ jewelry from their own\nbankruptcy proceedings (an interpretation that would\nserve little apparent purpose). And Congress had no\nneed to use the same “debtor’s interest” formulation in\n§522(b)(3)(C) for the simple reason that it imposed a value\nlimitation on the amount of exemptible retirement funds\nin a separate provision, §522(n).\n   Petitioners next contend that even if their interpreta­\n10                  CLARK v. RAMEKER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of “ ‘retirement funds’ does not independently exclude\nanything from the scope of the statute,” that poses no\nproblem because Congress actually intended that result.\nReply Brief 5–6. In particular, petitioners suggest that\nwhen a sentence is structured as §522(b)(3)(C) is—starting\nwith a broad category (“retirement funds”), then winnow­\ning it down through limiting language (“to the extent that”\nthe funds are held in a particular type of account)—it is\noften the case that the broad category does no independent\nlimiting work. As counsel for petitioners noted at oral\nargument, if a tax were to apply to “sports teams to the\nextent that they are members of the major professional\nsports leagues,” the phrase “sports teams” would not\nprovide any additional limitation on the covered entities.\nTr. of Oral Arg. 15.\n   There are two problems with this argument. First,\nwhile it is possible to conceive of sentences that use\n§522(b)(3)(C)’s “to the extent that” construction in a man­\nner where the initial broad category serves no exclusion­\nary purpose, that is not the only way in which the phrase\nmay be used. For example, a tax break that applies to\n“nonprofit organizations to the extent that they are medi­\ncal or scientific” would not apply to a for-profit pharma­\nceutical company because the initial broad category (“non­\nprofit organizations”) provides its own limitation. Just so\nhere; in order to qualify for bankruptcy protection under\n§522(b)(3)(C), funds must be both “retirement funds” and\nin an account exempt from taxation under one of the\nenumerated Tax Code sections.\n   Second, to accept petitioners’ argument would reintro­\nduce the surplusage problem already discussed. Supra, at\n8–9. And although petitioners are correct that “the only\neffect of respondents’ interpretation of ‘retirement funds’\nwould seemingly be to deny bankruptcy exemption to\ninherited IRAs,” Reply Brief 2, as between one interpreta­\ntion that would render statutory text superfluous and\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                 11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nanother that would render it meaningful yet limited, we\nthink the latter more faithful to the statute Congress\nwrote.\n  Finally, petitioners argue that even under the inquiry\nwe have described, funds in inherited IRAs should still\nqualify as “retirement funds” because the holder of such\nan account can leave much of its value intact until her\nretirement if she invests wisely and chooses to take only\nthe minimum annual distributions required by law. See\nBrief for Petitioners 27–28. But the possibility that some\ninvestors may use their inherited IRAs for retirement\npurposes does not mean that inherited IRAs bear the\ndefining legal characteristics of retirement funds. Were it\nany other way, money in an ordinary checking account (or,\nfor that matter, an envelope of $20 bills) would also\namount to “retirement funds” because it is possible for an\nowner to use those funds for retirement.4\n                      *    *     *\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is\naffirmed.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   4 Petitioners also argue that inherited IRAs are similar enough to\n\nRoth IRAs to qualify as retirement funds because “the owner of a Roth\nIRA may withdraw his contributions . . . without penalty.” Brief for\nPetitioners 44. But that argument fails to recognize that withdrawals\nof contributions to a Roth IRA are not subject to the 10 percent tax\npenalty for the unique reason that the contributions have already been\ntaxed. By contrast, all capital gains and investment income in a Roth\nIRA are subject to the pre-59½ withdrawal penalty (with narrow\nexceptions for, for example, medical expenses), which incentivizes use\nof those funds only in one’s retirement years.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2678134/", "sha1": "82e80f363a9ab32befd58c32b35b703157e479ef", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-058", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-12T08:00:42.054390"}
