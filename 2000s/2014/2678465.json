JOHN DOE \n\n       3, A MINOR BY DOE 3\u2019S NEXT BEST FRIEND\n\n                    DOE 2, ET AL. \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 12\u2013755   Decided June 16, 2014\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n   Some there are\u2014many, perhaps\u2014who are offended by\npublic displays of religion. Religion, they believe, is a\npersonal matter; if it must be given external manifesta-\ntion, that should not occur in public places where others\nmay be offended. I can understand that attitude: It paral-\nlels my own toward the playing in public of rock music or\nStravinsky. And I too am especially annoyed when the\nintrusion upon my inner peace occurs while I am part of a\ncaptive audience, as on a municipal bus or in the waiting\nroom of a public agency.\n   My own aversion cannot be imposed by law because of\nthe First Amendment. See Ward v. Rock Against Racism,\n491 U. S. 781, 790 (1989); Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422\nU. S. 205, 210\u2013211 (1975). Certain of this Court\u2019s cases,\nhowever, have allowed the aversion to religious displays to\nbe enforced directly through the First Amendment, at\nleast in public facilities and with respect to public ceremo-\nnies\u2014this despite the fact that the First Amendment\nexplicitly favors religion and is, so to speak, agnostic about\nmusic.\n   In the decision below, the en banc Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit relied on those cases to condemn a\nsuburban Milwaukee school district\u2019s decision to hold\nhigh-school graduations in a church. We recently con-\n2                 ELMBROOK SCHOOL DIST. v. DOE\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfronted and curtailed this errant line of precedent in Town\nof Greece v. Galloway, 572 U. S. ___ (2014), which upheld\nunder the Establishment Clause the saying of prayers\nbefore monthly town-council meetings. Because that case\nmade clear a number of points with which the Seventh\nCircuit\u2019s decision is fundamentally inconsistent, the Court\nought, at a minimum, to grant certiorari, vacate the judg-\nment, and remand for reconsideration (GVR).\n                        Endorsement\n  First, Town of Greece abandoned the antiquated \u201cen-\ndorsement test,\u201d which formed the basis for the decision\nbelow.\n  In this case, at the request of the student bodies of the\ntwo relevant schools, the Elmbrook School District decided\nto hold its high-school graduation ceremonies at Elmbrook\nChurch, a nondenominational Christian house of worship.\nThe students of the first school to move its ceremonies\npreferred that site to what had been the usual venue, the\nschool\u2019s gymnasium, which was cramped, hot, and uncom-\nfortable. The church offered more space, air conditioning,\nand cushioned seating. No one disputes that the church\nwas chosen only because of these amenities.\n  Despite that, the Seventh Circuit held that the choice of\nvenue violated the Establishment Clause, primarily be-\ncause it failed the endorsement test. That infinitely mal-\nleable standard asks whether governmental action has the\npurpose or effect of \u201cendorsing\u201d religion. See County of\nAllegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater\nPittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 592\u2013594 (1989). The\nSeventh Circuit declared that the endorsement test re-\nmains part of \u201cthe prevailing analytical tool for the analy-\nsis of Establishment Clause claims.\u201d 687 F. 3d 840, 849\n(2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).* And here,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    * More precisely, the court stated that \u201c[t]he three-pronged test set\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cthe sheer religiosity of the space created a likelihood that\nhigh school students and their younger siblings would\nperceive a link between church and state.\u201d Id., at 853.\n  In Town of Greece, the Second Circuit had also relied on\nthe notion of endorsement. See 681 F. 3d 20, 30 (2012).\nWe reversed the judgment without applying that test.\nWhat is more, we strongly suggested approval of a previ-\nous opinion \u201cdisput[ing] that endorsement could be the\nproper [Establishment Clause] test, as it likely would\ncondemn a host of traditional practices that recognize the\nrole religion plays in our society, among them legislative\nprayer and the \u2018forthrightly religious\u2019 Thanksgiving proc-\nlamations issued by nearly every President since Wash-\nington.\u201d 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (describing\nCounty of Allegheny, supra, at 670\u2013671 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part)).\nAfter Town of Greece, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s declaration\u2014\nwhich controlled its subsequent analysis\u2014that the en-\ndorsement test remains part of \u201cthe prevailing analytical\ntool\u201d for assessing Establishment Clause challenges, 687\nF. 3d, at 849 (internal quotation marks omitted), mis-\nstates the law.\n                          Coercion\n  Second, Town of Greece made categorically clear that\nmere \u201c[o]ffense . . . does not equate to coercion\u201d in any\nmanner relevant to the proper Establishment Clause\nanalysis. 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). \u201c[A]n Establishment Clause violation is not\nmade out any time a person experiences a sense of affront\nfrom the expression of contrary religious views.\u201d Ibid. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nforth by the Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602\n(1971), remains the prevailing analytical tool for the analysis of Estab-\nlishment Clause claims.\u201d 687 F. 3d, at 849 (internal quotation marks\nand citations omitted). It then explained that the endorsement test has\nbecome \u201ca legitimate part of Lemon\u2019s second prong.\u201d Id., at 850.\n4             ELMBROOK SCHOOL DIST. v. DOE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nalso id., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and con-\ncurring in judgment) (slip op., at 7\u20138) (same).\n   Here, the Seventh Circuit held that the school district\u2019s\n\u201cdecision to use Elmbrook Church for graduations was\nreligiously coercive\u201d under Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577\n(1992), and Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530\nU. S. 290 (2000). 687 F. 3d, at 854. Lee and Santa Fe,\nhowever, are inapposite because they concluded (however\nunrealistically) that students were coerced to engage in\nschool-sponsored prayer. In this case, it is beyond dispute\nthat no religious exercise whatever occurred. At most,\nrespondents complain that they took offense at being in a\nreligious place. See 687 F. 3d, at 848 (plaintiffs asserted\nthat they \u201c \u2018felt uncomfortable, upset, offended, unwel-\ncome, and/or angry\u2019 because of the religious setting\u201d of the\ngraduations). Were there any question before, Town of\nGreece made obvious that this is insufficient to state an\nEstablishment Clause violation.\n   It bears emphasis that the original understanding of the\nkind of coercion that the Establishment Clause condemns\nwas far narrower than the sort of peer-pressure coercion\nthat this Court has recently held unconstitutional in cases\nlike Lee and Santa Fe. \u201cThe coercion that was a hallmark\nof historical establishments of religion was coercion of\nreligious orthodoxy and of financial support by force of law\nand threat of penalty.\u201d Lee, supra, at 640 (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). See also Town of Greece, supra, at ___\u2013___\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 5\u20138).\n   As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin explained in a 1916\ncase challenging the siting of public high-school gradua-\ntions in local churches:\n    \u201cA man may feel constrained to enter a house of wor-\n    ship belonging to a different sect from the one with\n    which he affiliates, but if no sectarian services are\n    carried on, he is not compelled to worship God contrary\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n    to the dictates of his conscience, and is not obliged\n    to do so at all.\u201d State ex rel. Conway v. District Board\n    of Joint School Dist. No. 6, 162 Wis. 482, 490, 156\n    N. W. 477, 480.\n                           History\n   Last but by no means least, Town of Greece left no doubt\nthat \u201cthe Establishment Clause must be interpreted \u2018by\nreference to historical practices and understandings.\u2019 \u201d\n572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7\u20138). Moreover, \u201cif there is\nany inconsistency between [a \u2018test\u2019 set out in the opinions\nof this Court] and . . . historic practice . . . , the incon-\nsistency calls into question the validity of the test, not the\nhistoric practice.\u201d Id., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip\nop., at 12).\n   In this case, however, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s majority\nopinion said nothing about history at all. And there is\ngood reason to believe that this omission was material. As\ndemonstrated by Conway, the Wisconsin case mentioned\nabove, public schools have long held graduations in\nchurches. This should come as no surprise, given that\n\u201c[e]arly public schools were often held in rented rooms,\nchurch halls and basements, or other buildings that re-\nsembled Protestant churches.\u201d W. Reese, America\u2019s Public\nSchools 39 (2005). An 1821 Illinois law, for example,\nprovided that a meetinghouse erected by a Presbyterian\ncongregation \u201cmay serve to have the gospel preached\ntherein, and likewise may be used for a school-house for\nthe township.\u201d Ill. Laws p. 153.\n   We ought to remand this case to the Seventh Circuit to\nconduct the historical inquiry mandated by Town of\nGreece\u2014or we ought to set the case for argument and\nconduct that inquiry ourselves.\n                       *     *    *\n  It is perhaps the job of school officials to prevent hurt\n6             ELMBROOK SCHOOL DIST. v. DOE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfeelings at school events. But that is decidedly not the job\nof the Constitution. It may well be, as then-Chief Judge\nEasterbrook suggested, that the decision of the Elmbrook\nSchool District to hold graduations under a Latin cross\nin a Christian church was \u201cunwise\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d 687\nF. 3d, at 869 (dissenting opinion). But Town of Greece\nmakes manifest that an establishment of religion it was\nnot.\n    In addition to being decided incorrectly, this case bears\nother indicia of what we have come to call \u201ccertworthi-\nness.\u201d The Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision was en banc and\nprompted three powerful dissents (by then-Chief Judge\nEasterbrook and Judges Posner and Ripple). And it con-\nflicts with decisions that have long allowed graduation\nceremonies to take place in churches, see, e.g., Miller v.\nCooper, 56 N. M. 355, 356\u2013357, 244 P. 2d 520, 520\u2013521\n(1952); Conway, 162 Wis., at 489\u2013493, 156 N. W., at 479\u2013\n481, and with decisions upholding other public uses of\nreligious spaces, see, e.g., Bauchman v. West High School,\n132 F. 3d 542, 553\u2013556 (CA10 1997) (sanctioning school-\nchoir performances in venues \u201cdominated by crosses and\nother religious images\u201d); Otero v. State Election Bd. of\nOkla., 975 F. 2d 738, 740\u2013741 (CA10 1992) (upholding the\nuse of a church as a polling station); Berman v. Board of\nElections, 19 N. Y. 2d 744, 745, 226 N. E. 2d 177 (1967)\n(same).\n    According to the prevailing standard, a GVR order is\npotentially appropriate where \u201cintervening developments\n. . . reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below\nrests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if\ngiven the opportunity for further consideration, and where\nit appears that such a redetermination may determine the\nultimate outcome of the litigation.\u201d Lawrence v. Chater,\n516 U. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam). The Court has\nfound that standard satisfied on numerous occasions\nwhere judgments were far less obviously undermined by a\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\n",

W. 477, 480.\n                           History\n   Last but by no means least, Town of Greece left no doubt\nthat \u201cthe Establishment Clause must be interpreted \u2018by\nreference to historical practices and understandings.\u2019 \u201d\n572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7\u20138). Moreover, \u201cif there is\nany inconsistency between [a \u2018test\u2019 set out in the opinions\nof this Court] and . . . historic practice . . . , the incon-\nsistency calls into question the validity of the test, not the\nhistoric practice.\u201d Id., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip\nop., at 12).\n   In this case, however, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s majority\nopinion said nothing about history at all. And there is\ngood reason to believe that this omission was material. As\ndemonstrated by Conway, the Wisconsin case mentioned\nabove, public schools have long held graduations in\nchurches. This should come as no surprise, given that\n\u201c[e]arly public schools were often held in rented rooms,\nchurch halls and basements, or other buildings that re-\nsembled Protestant churches.\u201d W. Reese, America\u2019s Public\nSchools 39 (2005). An 1821 Illinois law, for example,\nprovided that a meetinghouse erected by a Presbyterian\ncongregation \u201cmay serve to have the gospel preached\ntherein, and likewise may be used for a school-house for\nthe township.\u201d Ill. Laws p. 153.\n   We ought to remand this case to the Seventh Circuit to\nconduct the historical inquiry mandated by Town of\nGreece\u2014or we ought to set the case for argument and\nconduct that inquiry ourselves.\n                       *     *    *\n  It is perhaps the job of school officials to prevent hurt\n6             ELMBROOK SCHOOL DIST. v. DOE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfeelings at school events. But that is decidedly not the job\nof the Constitution. It may well be, as then-Chief Judge\nEasterbrook suggested, that the decision of the Elmbrook\nSchool District to hold graduations under a Latin cross\nin a Christian church was \u201cunwise\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d 687\nF. 3d, at 869 (dissenting opinion). But Town of Greece\nmakes manifest that an establishment of religion it was\nnot.\n    In addition to being decided incorrectly, this case bears\nother indicia of what we have come to call \u201ccertworthi-\nness.\u201d The Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision was en banc and\nprompted three powerful dissents (by then-Chief Judge\nEasterbrook and Judges Posner and Ripple). And it con-\nflicts with decisions that have long allowed graduation\nceremonies to take place in churches, see, e.g., Miller v.\nCooper, 56 N. M. 355, 356\u2013357, 244 P. 2d 520, 520\u2013521\n(1952); Conway, 162 Wis., at 489\u2013493, 156 N. W., at 479\u2013\n481, and with decisions upholding other public uses of\nreligious spaces, see, e.g., Bauchman v. West High School,\n132 F. 3d 542, 553\u2013556 (CA10 1997) (sanctioning school-\nchoir performances in venues \u201cdominated by crosses and\nother religious images\u201d); Otero v. State Election Bd. of\nOkla., 975 F. 2d 738, 740\u2013741 (CA10 1992) (upholding the\nuse of a church as a polling station); Berman v. Board of\nElections, 19 N. Y. 2d 744, 745, 226 N. E. 2d 177 (1967)\n(same).\n    According to the prevailing standard, a GVR order is\npotentially appropriate where \u201cintervening developments\n. . . reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below\nrests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if\ngiven the opportunity for further consideration, and where\nit appears that such a redetermination may determine the\nultimate outcome of the litigation.\u201d Lawrence v. Chater,\n516 U. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam). The Court has\nfound that standard satisfied on numerous occasions\nwhere judgments were far less obviously undermined by a\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsubsequent decision of ours.\n  For these reasons, we should either grant the petition\nand set the case for argument or GVR in light of Town of\nGreece. I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\n</pre>",
