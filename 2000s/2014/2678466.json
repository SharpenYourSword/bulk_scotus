DRIEHAUS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 13\u2013193.      Argued April 22, 2014\u2014Decided June 16, 2014\nRespondent Driehaus, a former Congressman, filed a complaint with\n  the Ohio Elections Commission alleging that petitioner Susan B. An-\n  thony List (SBA) violated an Ohio law that criminalizes certain false\n  statements made during the course of a political campaign. Specifi-\n  cally, Driehaus alleged that SBA violated the law when it stated that\n  his vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)\n  was a vote in favor of \u201ctaxpayer funded abortion.\u201d After Driehaus\n  lost his re-election bid, the complaint was dismissed, but SBA contin-\n  ued to pursue a separate suit in Federal District Court challenging\n  the law on First Amendment grounds. Petitioner Coalition Opposed\n  to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST) also filed a First\n  Amendment challenge to the Ohio law, alleging that it had planned\n  to disseminate materials presenting a similar message but refrained\n  due to the proceedings against SBA. The District Court consolidated\n  the two lawsuits and dismissed them as nonjusticiable, concluding\n  that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes\n  of standing or ripeness. The Sixth Circuit affirmed on ripeness\n  grounds.\nHeld: Petitioners have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for Article\n III purposes. Pp. 7\u201318.\n    (a) To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show, inter\n alia, an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d which must be \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d\n and \u201cactual or imminent, not \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Lujan v.\n Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560. When challenging a law\n prior to its enforcement, a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact re-\n quirement where he alleges \u201can intention to engage in a course of\n conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but pro-\n scribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution\n2               SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    thereunder.\u201d Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298. Pp. 7\u201311.\n       (b) Petitioners have alleged a credible threat of enforcement of the\n    Ohio law. Pp. 11\u201317.\n          (1) Petitioners have alleged \u201can intention to engage in a course of\n    conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest\u201d by pleading\n    specific statements they intend to make in future election cycles.\n    Pp. 11\u201312.\n          (2) Petitioners\u2019 intended future conduct is also \u201carguably . . . pro-\n    scribed by [the] statute.\u201d The Ohio false statement statute sweeps\n    broadly, and a panel of the Ohio Elections Commission already found\n    probable cause to believe that SBA violated the law when it made\n    statements similar to those petitioners plan to make in the future.\n    Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103, is distinguishable; the threat of\n    prosecution under an electoral leafletting ban in that case was wholly\n    conjectural because the plaintiff\u2019s \u201csole concern\u201d related to a former\n    Congressman who was unlikely to run for office again. Here, by con-\n    trast, petitioners\u2019 speech focuses on the broader issue of support for\n    the ACA, not on the voting record of a single candidate. Nor does\n    SBA\u2019s insistence that its previous statements were true render its\n    fears of enforcement misplaced. After all, that insistence did not pre-\n    vent the Commission from finding probable cause for a violation the\n    first time. Pp. 12\u201313.\n          (3) Finally, the threat of future enforcement is substantial.\n    There is a history of past enforcement against petitioners. Past en-\n    forcement against the same conduct is good evidence that the threat\n    of enforcement is not \u201c \u2018chimerical.\u2019 \u201d Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S.\n    452, 459. The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that a\n    complaint may be filed with the State Commission by \u201cany person,\u201d\n    Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a73517.153(A), not just a prosecutor or agency.\n       The threatened Commission proceedings are of particular concern\n    because of the burden they impose on electoral speech. Moreover, the\n    target of a complaint may be forced to divert significant time and re-\n    sources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the\n    crucial days before an election. But this Court need not decide\n    whether the threat of Commission proceedings standing alone is suf-\n    ficient; here, those proceedings are backed by the additional threat of\n    criminal prosecution. Pp. 14\u201317.\n       (c) The Sixth Circuit separately considered two other \u201cprudential\n    factors\u201d: \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201chardship.\u201d This Court need not resolve the\n    continuing vitality of the prudential ripeness doctrine in this case be-\n    cause those factors are easily satisfied here.

The question in this case\nis whether their preenforcement challenge to that law is\njusticiable\u2014and in particular, whether they have alleged a\nsufficiently imminent injury for the purposes of Article III.\nWe conclude that they have.\n                                I\n   The Ohio statute at issue prohibits certain \u201cfalse state-\nment[s]\u201d \u201cduring the course of any campaign for nomina-\ntion or election to public office or office of a political party.\u201d\nOhio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a73517.21(B) (Lexis 2013).

If filed within 60 days\nof a primary election or 90 days of a general election, the\ncomplaint is referred to a panel of at least three Commis-\nsion members. \u00a7\u00a73517.156(A), (B)(1) (Lexis 2013). The\npanel must then hold an expedited hearing, generally\nwithin two business days, \u00a73517.156(B)(1), to determine\nwhether there is probable cause to believe the alleged\nviolation occurred, \u00a73517.156(C). Upon a finding of proba-\nble cause, the full Commission must, within 10 days, hold\na hearing on the complaint. \u00a73517.156(C)(2); see also Ohio\nAdmin.

Anthony List (SBA) is a \u201cpro-life\nadvocacy organization.\u201d 525 Fed. Appx. 415, 416 (CA6\n2013). During the 2010 election cycle, SBA publicly criti-\ncized various Members of Congress who voted for the\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). In\nparticular, it issued a press release announcing its plan to\n\u201ceducat[e] voters that their representative voted for a\nhealth care bill that includes taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d\nApp. 49\u201350. The press release listed then-Congressman\nSteve Driehaus, a respondent here, who voted for the\nACA. SBA also sought to display a billboard in Driehaus\u2019\ndistrict condemning that vote. The planned billboard\nwould have read: \u201cShame on Steve Driehaus! Driehaus\nvoted FOR taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d Id., at 37. The\nadvertising company that owned the billboard space re-\nfused to display that message, however, after Driehaus\u2019\ncounsel threatened legal action.\n  On October 4, 2010, Driehaus filed a complaint with the\nOhio Elections Commission alleging, as relevant here, that\nSBA had violated \u00a7\u00a73517.21(B)(9) and (10) by falsely\n4             SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nstating that he had voted for \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d2\nBecause Driehaus filed his complaint 29 days before the\ngeneral election, a Commission panel held an expedited\nhearing. On October 14, 2010, the panel voted 2 to 1 to\nfind probable cause that a violation had been committed.\nThe full Commission set a hearing date for 10 business\ndays later, and the parties commenced discovery.\nDriehaus noticed depositions of three SBA employees as\nwell as individuals affiliated with similar advocacy groups.\nHe also issued discovery requests for all evidence that\nSBA would rely on at the Commission hearing, as well as\nSBA\u2019s communications with allied organizations, political\nparty committees, and Members of Congress and their\nstaffs.\n   On October 18, 2010\u2014after the panel\u2019s probable-cause\ndetermination, but before the scheduled Commission\nhearing\u2014SBA filed suit in Federal District Court, seek-\ning declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that\n\u00a7\u00a73517.21(B)(9) and (10) violate the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments of the United States Constitution. The\nDistrict Court stayed the action under Younger v. Harris,\n401 U. S. 37 (1971), pending completion of the Commission\nproceedings. The Sixth Circuit denied SBA\u2019s motion for an\ninjunction pending appeal. Driehaus and SBA eventually\nagreed to postpone the full Commission hearing until after\nthe election.\n   When Driehaus lost the election in November 2010, he\nmoved to withdraw his complaint against SBA. The\nCommission granted the motion with SBA\u2019s consent. Once\nthe Commission proceedings were terminated, the District\nCourt lifted the stay and SBA amended its complaint. As\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The dispute about the falsity of SBA\u2019s speech concerns two different\n\nprovisions of the ACA: (1) the subsidy to assist lower income individ-\nuals in paying insurance premiums, and (2) the direct appropriation of\nfederal money for certain health programs such as community health\ncenters. See Brief for Petitioners 4\u20135.\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant here, the amended complaint alleged that Ohio\nRev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a73517.21(B)(9) and (10) are unconstitu-\ntional both facially and as applied. Specifically, the com-\nplaint alleged that SBA\u2019s speech about Driehaus had been\nchilled; that SBA \u201cintends to engage in substantially\nsimilar activity in the future\u201d; and that it \u201cface[d] the\nprospect of its speech and associational rights again being\nchilled and burdened,\u201d because \u201c[a]ny complainant can\nhale [it] before the [Commission], forcing it to expend time\nand resources defending itself.\u201d App. 121\u2013122.\n   The District Court consolidated SBA\u2019s suit with a sepa-\nrate suit brought by petitioner Coalition Opposed to Ad-\nditional Spending and Taxes (COAST), an advocacy orga-\nnization that also alleged that the same Ohio false\nstatement provisions are unconstitutional both facially\nand as applied.3 According to its amended complaint,\nCOAST intended to disseminate a mass e-mail and other\nmaterials criticizing Driehaus\u2019 vote for the ACA as a vote\n\u201cto fund abortions with tax dollars,\u201d but refrained from\ndoing so because of the Commission proceedings against\nSBA. Id., at 146, 148, 162. COAST further alleged that it\n\u201cdesires to make the same or similar statements about\nother federal candidates who voted for\u201d the ACA, but that\nfear \u201cof finding itself subject to the same fate\u201d as SBA has\ndeterred it from doing so. Id., at 149, 157.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Petitioners also challenged a related \u201cdisclaimer provision,\u201d App.\n\n126\u2013127, 156\u2013157, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a73517.20, and COAST\nraised pre-emption and due process claims. Reply Brief 21, n. 7.\nPetitioners do not pursue their \u201cdisclaimer,\u201d pre-emption, or due\nprocess claims before us. Ibid. We also need not address SBA\u2019s sepa-\nrate challenge to the Commission\u2019s investigatory procedures; petition-\ners have conceded that the procedures claim stands or falls with the\nsubstantive prohibition on false statements. Ibid.; see Tr. of Oral Arg.\n19. Finally, the parties agree that petitioners\u2019 as-applied claims \u201care\nbetter read as facial objections to Ohio\u2019s law.\u201d Reply Brief 19. Accord-\ningly, we do not separately address the as-applied claims.\n  4 SBA named Driehaus, the Commission\u2019s members and its staff at-\n6             SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court dismissed both suits as non-\njusticiable, concluding that neither suit presented a suffi-\nciently concrete injury for purposes of standing or ripe-\nness. The Sixth Circuit affirmed on ripeness grounds. 525\nFed. Appx. 415. The Court of Appeals analyzed three\nfactors to assess whether the case was ripe for review: (1)\nthe likelihood that the alleged harm would come to pass;\n(2) whether the factual record was sufficiently developed;\nand (3) the hardship to the parties if judicial relief were\ndenied.\n   Regarding the first factor, the Sixth Circuit concluded\nthat SBA\u2019s prior injuries\u2014the probable-cause determina-\ntion and the billboard rejection\u2014\u201cdo not help it show an\nimminent threat of future prosecution,\u201d particularly where\n\u201cthe Commission never found that SBA . . . violated Ohio\u2019s\nfalse-statement law.\u201d Id., at 420. The court further rea-\nsoned that it was speculative whether any person would\nfile a complaint with the Commission in the future, in part\nbecause Driehaus took a 2-year assignment with the Peace\nCorps in Africa after losing the election. Finally, the court\nnoted that SBA has not alleged that \u201cit plans to lie or\nrecklessly disregard the veracity of its speech\u201d in the\nfuture, but rather maintains that the statements it in-\ntends to make are factually true. Id., at 422.\n   As for the remaining factors, the court concluded that\nthe factual record was insufficiently developed with re-\nspect to the content of SBA\u2019s future speech, and that with-\nholding judicial relief would not result in undue hardship\nbecause, in the time period leading up to the 2010 election,\nSBA continued to communicate its message even after\nCommission proceedings were initiated.

DRIEHAUS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU.

When an individual is subject to such a threat, an\nactual arrest, prosecution, or other enforcement action is\nnot a prerequisite to challenging the law. See Steffel v.\nThompson, 415 U. S. 452, 459 (1974) (\u201c[I]t is not necessary\nthat petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or\nprosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he\nclaims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights\u201d); see\nalso MedImmune, Inc. v.

Instead, we have permitted pre-\nenforcement review under circumstances that render the\nthreatened enforcement sufficiently imminent. Specifically,\nwe have held that a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirement where he alleges \u201can intention to engage in a\ncourse of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional\ninterest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a\ncredible threat of prosecution thereunder.\u201d Babbitt v.\nFarm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298 (1979). Several of our\ncases illustrate the circumstances under which plaintiffs\nmay bring a preenforcement challenge consistent with\nArticle III.\n   In Steffel, for example, police officers threatened to\narrest petitioner and his companion for distributing hand-\nbills protesting the Vietnam War. Petitioner left to avoid\narrest; his companion remained and was arrested and\ncharged with criminal trespass. Petitioner sought a de-\nclaratory judgment that the trespass statute was uncon-\nstitutional as applied to him.\n   We determined that petitioner had alleged a credible\nthreat of enforcement: He had been warned to stop hand-\nbilling and threatened with prosecution if he disobeyed; he\nstated his desire to continue handbilling (an activity he\nclaimed was constitutionally protected); and his compan-\nion\u2019s prosecution showed that his \u201cconcern with arrest\u201d\nwas not \u201c \u2018 chimerical.\u2019 \u201d 415 U. S., at 459. Under those\ncircumstances, we said, \u201cit is not necessary that petitioner\nfirst expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be\nentitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the\nexercise of his constitutional rights.\u201d Ibid.\n   In Babbitt, we considered a preenforcement challenge to\na statute that made it an unfair labor practice to encour-\nage consumers to boycott an \u201cagricultural product . . . by\nthe use of dishonest, untruthful and deceptive publicity.\u2019 \u201d\n442 U. S., at 301. The plaintiffs contended that the law\n\u201cunconstitutionally penalize[d] inaccuracies inadvertently\nuttered in the course of consumer appeals.\u201d Ibid.\n   Building on Steffel, we explained that a plaintiff could\nbring a preenforcement suit when he \u201chas alleged an\nintention to engage in a course of conduct arguably af-\n10         SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a\nstatute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution\nthereunder.\u201d Babbit, supra, at 298. We found those cir-\ncumstances present in Babbitt. In that case, the law \u201con\nits face proscribe[d] dishonest, untruthful, and deceptive\npublicity.\u201d 442 U. S., at 302. The plaintiffs had \u201cactively\nengaged in consumer publicity campaigns in the past\u201d and\nalleged \u201can intention to continue\u201d those campaigns in the\nfuture. Id., at 301. And although they did not \u201cplan to\npropagate untruths,\u201d they argued that \u201c \u2018 erroneous state-\nment is inevitable in free debate.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. We concluded\nthat the plaintiffs\u2019 fear of prosecution was not \u201cimaginary\nor wholly speculative,\u201d and that their challenge to the\nconsumer publicity provision presented an Article III case\nor controversy. Id., at 302.\n   Two other cases bear mention. In Virginia v. American\nBooksellers Assn. Inc., 484 U. S. 383 (1988), we held that\nbooksellers could seek preenforcement review of a law\nmaking it a crime to \u201c \u2018knowingly display for commercial\npurpose\u2019 \u201d material that is \u201c \u2018harmful to juveniles\u2019 \u201d as\ndefined by the statute.        Id., at 386.   At trial, the\nbooksellers introduced 16 books they believed were cov-\nered by the statute and testified that costly compliance\nmeasures would be necessary to avoid prosecution for\ndisplaying such books. Just as in Babbitt and Steffel, we\ndetermined that the \u201cpre-enforcement nature\u201d of the suit\nwas not \u201ctroubl[ing]\u201d because the plaintiffs had \u201calleged an\nactual and well-founded fear that the law will be enforced\nagainst them.\u201d 484 U. S., at 393.\n   Finally, in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561\nU. S. 1 (2010), we considered a preenforcement challenge\nto a law that criminalized \u201c \u2018 knowingly provid[ing] mate-\nrial support or resources to a foreign terrorist organiza-\ntion.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 8. The plaintiffs claimed that they had\nprovided support to groups designated as terrorist organi-\nzations prior to the law\u2019s enactment and would provide\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsimilar support in the future. The Government had\ncharged 150 persons with violating the law and declined to\ndisavow prosecution if the plaintiffs resumed their support\nof the designated organizations. We held that the claims\nwere justiciable: The plaintiffs faced a \u201c \u2018credible threat\u2019 \u201d\nof enforcement and \u201c \u2018should not be required to await and\nundergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seek-\ning relief.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 15.\n                            IV\n  Here, SBA and COAST contend that the threat of en-\nforcement of the false statement statute amounts to an\nArticle III injury in fact. We agree: Petitioners have al-\nleged a credible threat of enforcement. See Babbitt, 442\nU. S., at 298.\n                               A\n   First, petitioners have alleged \u201can intention to engage in\na course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional\ninterest.\u201d Ibid. Both petitioners have pleaded specific\nstatements they intend to make in future election cycles.\nSBA has already stated that representatives who voted for\nthe ACA supported \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion,\u201d and it has\nalleged an \u201cinten[t] to engage in substantially similar\nactivity in the future.\u201d App. 49\u201350, 122. See also Human-\nitarian Law Project, supra, at 15\u201316 (observing that plain-\ntiffs had previously provided support to groups designated\nas terrorist organizations and alleged they \u201cwould provide\nsimilar support [to the same terrorist organizations] again\nif the statute\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted\u201d).\nCOAST has alleged that it previously intended to dissemi-\nnate materials criticizing a vote for the ACA as a vote \u201cto\nfund abortions with tax dollars,\u201d and that it \u201cdesires to\nmake the same or similar statements about other federal\ncandidates who voted for [the ACA].\u201d App. 146, 149, 162.\nBecause petitioners\u2019 intended future conduct concerns\n12          SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npolitical speech, it is certainly \u201caffected with a constitu-\ntional interest.\u201d Babbitt, supra, at 298; see also Monitor\nPatriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971) (\u201c[T]he consti-\ntutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent applica-\ntion precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political\noffice\u201d).\n                               B\n   Next, petitioners\u2019 intended future conduct is \u201cargua-\nbly. . . proscribed by [the] statute\u201d they wish to challenge.\nBabbitt, supra, at 298. The Ohio false statement law\nsweeps broadly, see supra, at 1\u20132, and n. 1., and covers\nthe subject matter of petitioners\u2019 intended speech. Both\nSBA and COAST have alleged an intent to \u201c[m]ake\u201d\nstatements \u201cconcerning the voting record of a candidate or\npublic official,\u201d \u00a73517.21(B)(9), and to \u201cdisseminate\u201d\nstatements \u201cconcerning a candidate . . . to promote the\nelection, nomination, or defeat of the candidate,\u201d\n\u00a73517.21(B)(10). And, a Commission panel here already\nfound probable cause to believe that SBA violated the\nstatute when it stated that Driehaus had supported\n\u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion\u201d\u2014the same sort of statement\npetitioners plan to disseminate in the future. Under these\ncircumstances, we have no difficulty concluding that peti-\ntioners\u2019 intended speech is \u201carguably proscribed\u201d by the\nlaw.\n   Respondents incorrectly rely on Golden v. Zwickler, 394\nU. S. 103 (1969). In that case, the plaintiff had previously\ndistributed anonymous leaflets criticizing a particular\nCongressman who had since left office. Id., at 104\u2013106,\nand n. 2. The Court dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s challenge to\nthe electoral leafletting ban as nonjusticiable because his\n\u201csole concern was literature relating to the Congressman\nand his record,\u201d and \u201cit was most unlikely that the Con-\ngressman would again be a candidate.\u201d Id., at 109 (em-\nphasis added). Under those circumstances, any threat of\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfuture prosecution was \u201cwholly conjectural.\u201d Ibid.\n   Here, by contrast, petitioners\u2019 speech focuses on the\nbroader issue of support for the ACA, not on the voting\nrecord of a single candidate. See Reply Brief 4\u20135 (identify-\ning other elected officials who plan to seek reelection as\npotential objects of SBA\u2019s criticisms). Because petitioners\u2019\nalleged future speech is not directed exclusively at\nDriehaus, it does not matter whether he \u201cmay run for\noffice again.\u201d Brief for Respondents 33 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). As long as petitioners continue to engage\nin comparable electoral speech regarding support for the\nACA, that speech will remain arguably proscribed by\nOhio\u2019s false statement statute.\n   Respondents, echoing the Sixth Circuit, contend that\nSBA\u2019s fears of enforcement are misplaced because SBA\nhas not said it \u201c \u2018plans to lie or recklessly disregard the\nveracity of its speech.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 15 (quoting 525 Fed. Appx.,\nat 422). The Sixth Circuit reasoned that because SBA\n\u201ccan only be liable for making a statement \u2018knowing\u2019 it is\nfalse,\u201d SBA\u2019s insistence that its speech is factually true\n\u201cmakes the possibility of prosecution for uttering such\nstatements exceedingly slim.\u201d Id., at 422.\n   The Sixth Circuit misses the point. SBA\u2019s insistence\nthat the allegations in its press release were true did not\nprevent the Commission panel from finding probable\ncause to believe that SBA had violated the law the first\ntime around. And, there is every reason to think that\nsimilar speech in the future will result in similar proceed-\nings, notwithstanding SBA\u2019s belief in the truth of its alle-\ngations. Nothing in this Court\u2019s decisions requires a\nplaintiff who wishes to challenge the constitutionality of a\nlaw to confess that he will in fact violate that law. See,\ne.g., Babbitt, 442 U. S., at 301 (case was justiciable even\nthough plaintiffs disavowed any intent to \u201cpropagate\nuntruths\u201d).\n14          SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               C\n\n  Finally, the threat of future enforcement of the false\nstatement statute is substantial. Most obviously, there is\na history of past enforcement here: SBA was the subject of\na complaint in a recent election cycle. We have observed\nthat past enforcement against the same conduct is good\nevidence that the threat of enforcement is not \u201c \u2018 chimeri-\ncal.\u2019 \u201d Steffel, 415 U. S., at 459; cf. Clapper, 568 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 12) (plaintiffs\u2019 theory of standing was\n\u201csubstantially undermine[d]\u201d by their \u201cfail[ure] to offer\nany evidence that their communications ha[d] been moni-\ntored\u201d under the challenged statute). Here, the threat is\neven more substantial given that the Commission panel\nactually found probable cause to believe that SBA\u2019s speech\nviolated the false statement statute. Indeed future com-\nplainants may well \u201cinvoke the prior probable-cause find-\ning to prove that SBA knowingly lied.\u201d Brief for Petition-\ners 32.\n  The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that\nauthority to file a complaint with the Commission is not\nlimited to a prosecutor or an agency. Instead, the false\nstatement statute allows \u201cany person\u201d with knowledge of\nthe purported violation to file a complaint. \u00a73517.153(A).\nBecause the universe of potential complainants is not\nrestricted to state officials who are constrained by explicit\nguidelines or ethical obligations, there is a real risk of\ncomplaints from, for example, political opponents. See\nBrief for Michael DeWine, Attorney General of Ohio, as\nAmicus Curiae 8 (hereinafter DeWine Brief); see also id.,\nat 6 (noting that \u201cthe Commission has no system for weed-\ning out frivolous complaints\u201d). And petitioners, who in-\ntend to criticize candidates for political office, are easy\ntargets.\n  Finally, Commission proceedings are not a rare occur-\nrence. Petitioners inform us that the Commission \u201c \u2018han-\ndles about 20 to 80 false statement complaints per year,\u2019 \u201d\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioners 46, and respondents do not deny that\nthe Commission frequently fields complaints alleging\nviolations of the false statement statute. Cf. Humani-\ntarian Law Project, 561 U. S., at 16 (noting that there had\nbeen numerous prior prosecutions under the challenged\nstatute).    Moreover, respondents have not disavowed\nenforcement if petitioners make similar statements in the\nfuture. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\u201330; see also Humanitarian\nLaw Project, supra, at 16 (\u201cThe Government has not ar-\ngued to this Court that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if\nthey do what they say they wish to do\u201d). In fact, the spec-\nter of enforcement is so substantial that the owner of the\nbillboard refused to display SBA\u2019s message after receiving\na letter threatening Commission proceedings. On these\nfacts, the prospect of future enforcement is far from \u201cimag-\ninary or speculative.\u201d Babbitt, supra, at 298.\n   We take the threatened Commission proceedings into\naccount because administrative action, like arrest or\nprosecution, may give rise to harm sufficient to justify pre-\nenforcement review. See Ohio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n v.\nDayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U. S. 619, 625\u2013626,\nn. 1 (1986) (\u201cIf a reasonable threat of prosecution creates a\nripe controversy, we fail to see how the actual filing of the\nadministrative action threatening sanctions in this case\ndoes not\u201d). The burdens that Commission proceedings can\nimpose on electoral speech are of particular concern here.\nAs the Ohio Attorney General himself notes, the \u201cpractical\neffect\u201d of the Ohio false statement scheme is \u201cto permit a\nprivate complainant . . . to gain a campaign advantage\nwithout ever having to prove the falsity of a statement.\u201d\nDeWine Brief 7. \u201c[C]omplainants may time their submis-\nsions to achieve maximum disruption of their political\nopponents while calculating that an ultimate decision on\nthe merits will be deferred until after the relevant elec-\ntion.\u201d Id., at 14\u201315. Moreover, the target of a false state-\nment complaint may be forced to divert significant time\n16         SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v.

The\nburdensome Commission proceedings here are backed by\nthe additional threat of criminal prosecution. We conclude\nthat the combination of those two threats suffices to create\nan Article III injury under the circumstances of this case.\nSee Babbitt, supra, at 302, n. 13 (In addition to the threat\nof criminal sanctions, \u201cthe prospect of issuance of an ad-\nministrative cease-and-desist order or a court-ordered\ninjunction against such prohibited conduct provides sub-\nstantial additional support for the conclusion that appel-\nlees\u2019 challenge . . . is justiciable\u201d (citations omitted)).\n   That conclusion holds true as to both SBA and COAST.\nRespondents, relying on Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37\n(1971), appear to suggest that COAST lacks standing\nbecause it refrained from actually disseminating its\nplanned speech in order to avoid Commission proceedings\nof its own. See Brief for Respondents 26\u201327, 34. In\nYounger, the plaintiff had been indicted for distributing\nleaflets in violation of the California Criminal Syndicalism\nAct. When he challenged the constitutionality of the law\nin federal court, several other plaintiffs intervened, argu-\ning that their own speech was inhibited by Harris\u2019 prose-\ncution. The Court concluded that only the plaintiff had\nstanding because the intervenors \u201cd[id] not claim that\nthey ha[d] ever been threatened with prosecution, that a\nprosecution [wa]s likely, or even that a prosecution [wa]s\nremotely possible.\u201d 401 U.

Also unlike the intervenors in Younger, who had\nnever been threatened with prosecution, COAST has been\nthe subject of Commission proceedings in the past. See,\ne.g., COAST Candidates PAC v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n,\n543 Fed. Appx. 490 (CA6 2013). COAST is far more akin\nto the plaintiff in Steffel, who was not arrested alongside\nhis handbilling companion but was nevertheless threat-\nened with prosecution for similar speech. 415 U. S., at\n459.\n   In sum, we find that both SBA and COAST have alleged\na credible threat of enforcement.\n                              V\n   In concluding that petitioners\u2019 claims were not justicia-\nble, the Sixth Circuit separately considered two other\nfactors: whether the factual record was sufficiently devel-\noped, and whether hardship to the parties would result if\njudicial relief is denied at this stage in the proceedings.\n525 Fed.

DRIEHAUS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 13\u2013193.      Argued April 22, 2014\u2014Decided June 16, 2014\nRespondent Driehaus, a former Congressman, filed a complaint with\n  the Ohio Elections Commission alleging that petitioner Susan B. An-\n  thony List (SBA) violated an Ohio law that criminalizes certain false\n  statements made during the course of a political campaign. Specifi-\n  cally, Driehaus alleged that SBA violated the law when it stated that\n  his vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)\n  was a vote in favor of \u201ctaxpayer funded abortion.\u201d After Driehaus\n  lost his re-election bid, the complaint was dismissed, but SBA contin-\n  ued to pursue a separate suit in Federal District Court challenging\n  the law on First Amendment grounds. Petitioner Coalition Opposed\n  to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST) also filed a First\n  Amendment challenge to the Ohio law, alleging that it had planned\n  to disseminate materials presenting a similar message but refrained\n  due to the proceedings against SBA. The District Court consolidated\n  the two lawsuits and dismissed them as nonjusticiable, concluding\n  that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes\n  of standing or ripeness. The Sixth Circuit affirmed on ripeness\n  grounds.\nHeld: Petitioners have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for Article\n III purposes. Pp. 7\u201318.\n    (a) To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show, inter\n alia, an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d which must be \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d\n and \u201cactual or imminent, not \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Lujan v.\n Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560. When challenging a law\n prior to its enforcement, a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact re-\n quirement where he alleges \u201can intention to engage in a course of\n conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but pro-\n scribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution\n2               SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    thereunder.\u201d Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298. Pp. 7\u201311.\n       (b) Petitioners have alleged a credible threat of enforcement of the\n    Ohio law. Pp. 11\u201317.\n          (1) Petitioners have alleged \u201can intention to engage in a course of\n    conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest\u201d by pleading\n    specific statements they intend to make in future election cycles.\n    Pp. 11\u201312.\n          (2) Petitioners\u2019 intended future conduct is also \u201carguably . . . pro-\n    scribed by [the] statute.\u201d The Ohio false statement statute sweeps\n    broadly, and a panel of the Ohio Elections Commission already found\n    probable cause to believe that SBA violated the law when it made\n    statements similar to those petitioners plan to make in the future.\n    Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103, is distinguishable; the threat of\n    prosecution under an electoral leafletting ban in that case was wholly\n    conjectural because the plaintiff\u2019s \u201csole concern\u201d related to a former\n    Congressman who was unlikely to run for office again. Here, by con-\n    trast, petitioners\u2019 speech focuses on the broader issue of support for\n    the ACA, not on the voting record of a single candidate. Nor does\n    SBA\u2019s insistence that its previous statements were true render its\n    fears of enforcement misplaced. After all, that insistence did not pre-\n    vent the Commission from finding probable cause for a violation the\n    first time. Pp. 12\u201313.\n          (3) Finally, the threat of future enforcement is substantial.\n    There is a history of past enforcement against petitioners. Past en-\n    forcement against the same conduct is good evidence that the threat\n    of enforcement is not \u201c \u2018chimerical.\u2019 \u201d Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S.\n    452, 459. The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that a\n    complaint may be filed with the State Commission by \u201cany person,\u201d\n    Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a73517.153(A), not just a prosecutor or agency.\n       The threatened Commission proceedings are of particular concern\n    because of the burden they impose on electoral speech. Moreover, the\n    target of a complaint may be forced to divert significant time and re-\n    sources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the\n    crucial days before an election. But this Court need not decide\n    whether the threat of Commission proceedings standing alone is suf-\n    ficient; here, those proceedings are backed by the additional threat of\n    criminal prosecution. Pp. 14\u201317.\n       (c) The Sixth Circuit separately considered two other \u201cprudential\n    factors\u201d: \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201chardship.\u201d This Court need not resolve the\n    continuing vitality of the prudential ripeness doctrine in this case be-\n    cause those factors are easily satisfied here.

The question in this case\nis whether their preenforcement challenge to that law is\njusticiable\u2014and in particular, whether they have alleged a\nsufficiently imminent injury for the purposes of Article III.\nWe conclude that they have.\n                                I\n   The Ohio statute at issue prohibits certain \u201cfalse state-\nment[s]\u201d \u201cduring the course of any campaign for nomina-\ntion or election to public office or office of a political party.\u201d\nOhio Rev.

Anthony List (SBA) is a \u201cpro-life\nadvocacy organization.\u201d 525 Fed. Appx. 415, 416 (CA6\n2013). During the 2010 election cycle, SBA publicly criti-\ncized various Members of Congress who voted for the\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). In\nparticular, it issued a press release announcing its plan to\n\u201ceducat[e] voters that their representative voted for a\nhealth care bill that includes taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d\nApp. 49\u201350. The press release listed then-Congressman\nSteve Driehaus, a respondent here, who voted for the\nACA. SBA also sought to display a billboard in Driehaus\u2019\ndistrict condemning that vote. The planned billboard\nwould have read: \u201cShame on Steve Driehaus! Driehaus\nvoted FOR taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d Id., at 37. The\nadvertising company that owned the billboard space re-\nfused to display that message, however, after Driehaus\u2019\ncounsel threatened legal action.\n  On October 4, 2010, Driehaus filed a complaint with the\nOhio Elections Commission alleging, as relevant here, that\nSBA had violated \u00a7\u00a73517.21(B)(9) and (10) by falsely\n4             SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nstating that he had voted for \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d2\nBecause Driehaus filed his complaint 29 days before the\ngeneral election, a Commission panel held an expedited\nhearing. On October 14, 2010, the panel voted 2 to 1 to\nfind probable cause that a violation had been committed.\nThe full Commission set a hearing date for 10 business\ndays later, and the parties commenced discovery.\nDriehaus noticed depositions of three SBA employees as\nwell as individuals affiliated with similar advocacy groups.\nHe also issued discovery requests for all evidence that\nSBA would rely on at the Commission hearing, as well as\nSBA\u2019s communications with allied organizations, political\nparty committees, and Members of Congress and their\nstaffs.\n   On October 18, 2010\u2014after the panel\u2019s probable-cause\ndetermination, but before the scheduled Commission\nhearing\u2014SBA filed suit in Federal District Court, seek-\ning declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that\n\u00a7\u00a73517.21(B)(9) and (10) violate the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments of the United States Constitution. The\nDistrict Court stayed the action under Younger v. Harris,\n401 U. S. 37 (1971), pending completion of the Commission\nproceedings. The Sixth Circuit denied SBA\u2019s motion for an\ninjunction pending appeal. Driehaus and SBA eventually\nagreed to postpone the full Commission hearing until after\nthe election.\n   When Driehaus lost the election in November 2010, he\nmoved to withdraw his complaint against SBA. The\nCommission granted the motion with SBA\u2019s consent. Once\nthe Commission proceedings were terminated, the District\nCourt lifted the stay and SBA amended its complaint. As\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The dispute about the falsity of SBA\u2019s speech concerns two different\n\nprovisions of the ACA: (1) the subsidy to assist lower income individ-\nuals in paying insurance premiums, and (2) the direct appropriation of\nfederal money for certain health programs such as community health\ncenters.

Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a73517.21(B)(9) and (10) are unconstitu-\ntional both facially and as applied. Specifically, the com-\nplaint alleged that SBA\u2019s speech about Driehaus had been\nchilled; that SBA \u201cintends to engage in substantially\nsimilar activity in the future\u201d; and that it \u201cface[d] the\nprospect of its speech and associational rights again being\nchilled and burdened,\u201d because \u201c[a]ny complainant can\nhale [it] before the [Commission], forcing it to expend time\nand resources defending itself.\u201d App. 121\u2013122.\n   The District Court consolidated SBA\u2019s suit with a sepa-\nrate suit brought by petitioner Coalition Opposed to Ad-\nditional Spending and Taxes (COAST), an advocacy orga-\nnization that also alleged that the same Ohio false\nstatement provisions are unconstitutional both facially\nand as applied.3 According to its amended complaint,\nCOAST intended to disseminate a mass e-mail and other\nmaterials criticizing Driehaus\u2019 vote for the ACA as a vote\n\u201cto fund abortions with tax dollars,\u201d but refrained from\ndoing so because of the Commission proceedings against\nSBA. Id., at 146, 148, 162. COAST further alleged that it\n\u201cdesires to make the same or similar statements about\nother federal candidates who voted for\u201d the ACA, but that\nfear \u201cof finding itself subject to the same fate\u201d as SBA has\ndeterred it from doing so. Id., at 149, 157.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Petitioners also challenged a related \u201cdisclaimer provision,\u201d App.\n\n126\u2013127, 156\u2013157, under Ohio Rev.

DRIEHAUS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court dismissed both suits as non-\njusticiable, concluding that neither suit presented a suffi-\nciently concrete injury for purposes of standing or ripe-\nness. The Sixth Circuit affirmed on ripeness grounds. 525\nFed. Appx. 415. The Court of Appeals analyzed three\nfactors to assess whether the case was ripe for review: (1)\nthe likelihood that the alleged harm would come to pass;\n(2) whether the factual record was sufficiently developed;\nand (3) the hardship to the parties if judicial relief were\ndenied.\n   Regarding the first factor, the Sixth Circuit concluded\nthat SBA\u2019s prior injuries\u2014the probable-cause determina-\ntion and the billboard rejection\u2014\u201cdo not help it show an\nimminent threat of future prosecution,\u201d particularly where\n\u201cthe Commission never found that SBA . . . violated Ohio\u2019s\nfalse-statement law.\u201d Id., at 420. The court further rea-\nsoned that it was speculative whether any person would\nfile a complaint with the Commission in the future, in part\nbecause Driehaus took a 2-year assignment with the Peace\nCorps in Africa after losing the election. Finally, the court\nnoted that SBA has not alleged that \u201cit plans to lie or\nrecklessly disregard the veracity of its speech\u201d in the\nfuture, but rather maintains that the statements it in-\ntends to make are factually true. Id., at 422.\n   As for the remaining factors, the court concluded that\nthe factual record was insufficiently developed with re-\nspect to the content of SBA\u2019s future speech, and that with-\nholding judicial relief would not result in undue hardship\nbecause, in the time period leading up to the 2010 election,\nSBA continued to communicate its message even after\nCommission proceedings were initiated.

S. 383, 392 (1988), and Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 299,\nn. 11 (1979), we use the term \u201cstanding\u201d in this opinion.\n8           SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 490, 498 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAn injury sufficient to satisfy Article III must be \u201cconcrete\nand particularized\u201d and \u201cactual or imminent, not \u2018conjec-\ntural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Lujan, supra, at 560 (some inter-\nnal question marks omitted). An allegation of future\ninjury may suffice if the threatened injury is \u201ccertainly\nimpending,\u201d or there is a \u201c \u2018substantial risk\u2019 that the harm\nwill occur.\u201d Clapper, 568 U. S., at ___, ___, n. 5 (slip op., at\n10, 15, n. 5) (emphasis deleted and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n  \u201c \u2018 The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the\nburden of establishing\u2019 standing.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). \u201c[E]ach element must be supported in the same way\nas any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the bur-\nden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence\nrequired at the successive stages of the litigation.\u201d Lujan,\nsupra, at 561.\n                               B\n   One recurring issue in our cases is determining when\nthe threatened enforcement of a law creates an Article III\ninjury. When an individual is subject to such a threat, an\nactual arrest, prosecution, or other enforcement action is\nnot a prerequisite to challenging the law. See Steffel v.\nThompson, 415 U. S. 452, 459 (1974) (\u201c[I]t is not necessary\nthat petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or\nprosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he\nclaims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights\u201d); see\nalso MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118,\n128\u2013129 (2007) (\u201c[W]here threatened action by government\nis concerned, we do not require a plaintiff to expose him-\nself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis\nfor the threat\u201d).       Instead, we have permitted pre-\nenforcement review under circumstances that render the\nthreatened enforcement sufficiently imminent. Specifically,\nwe have held that a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirement where he alleges \u201can intention to engage in a\ncourse of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional\ninterest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a\ncredible threat of prosecution thereunder.\u201d Babbitt v.\nFarm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298 (1979). Several of our\ncases illustrate the circumstances under which plaintiffs\nmay bring a preenforcement challenge consistent with\nArticle III.\n   In Steffel, for example, police officers threatened to\narrest petitioner and his companion for distributing hand-\nbills protesting the Vietnam War. Petitioner left to avoid\narrest; his companion remained and was arrested and\ncharged with criminal trespass. Petitioner sought a de-\nclaratory judgment that the trespass statute was uncon-\nstitutional as applied to him.\n   We determined that petitioner had alleged a credible\nthreat of enforcement: He had been warned to stop hand-\nbilling and threatened with prosecution if he disobeyed; he\nstated his desire to continue handbilling (an activity he\nclaimed was constitutionally protected); and his compan-\nion\u2019s prosecution showed that his \u201cconcern with arrest\u201d\nwas not \u201c \u2018 chimerical.\u2019 \u201d 415 U. S., at 459. Under those\ncircumstances, we said, \u201cit is not necessary that petitioner\nfirst expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be\nentitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the\nexercise of his constitutional rights.\u201d Ibid.\n   In Babbitt, we considered a preenforcement challenge to\na statute that made it an unfair labor practice to encour-\nage consumers to boycott an \u201cagricultural product . . . by\nthe use of dishonest, untruthful and deceptive publicity.\u2019 \u201d\n442 U. S., at 301. The plaintiffs contended that the law\n\u201cunconstitutionally penalize[d] inaccuracies inadvertently\nuttered in the course of consumer appeals.\u201d Ibid.\n   Building on Steffel, we explained that a plaintiff could\nbring a preenforcement suit when he \u201chas alleged an\nintention to engage in a course of conduct arguably af-\n10         SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a\nstatute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution\nthereunder.\u201d Babbit, supra, at 298. We found those cir-\ncumstances present in Babbitt. In that case, the law \u201con\nits face proscribe[d] dishonest, untruthful, and deceptive\npublicity.\u201d 442 U. S., at 302. The plaintiffs had \u201cactively\nengaged in consumer publicity campaigns in the past\u201d and\nalleged \u201can intention to continue\u201d those campaigns in the\nfuture. Id., at 301. And although they did not \u201cplan to\npropagate untruths,\u201d they argued that \u201c \u2018 erroneous state-\nment is inevitable in free debate.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. We concluded\nthat the plaintiffs\u2019 fear of prosecution was not \u201cimaginary\nor wholly speculative,\u201d and that their challenge to the\nconsumer publicity provision presented an Article III case\nor controversy. Id., at 302.\n   Two other cases bear mention. In Virginia v. American\nBooksellers Assn. Inc., 484 U. S. 383 (1988), we held that\nbooksellers could seek preenforcement review of a law\nmaking it a crime to \u201c \u2018knowingly display for commercial\npurpose\u2019 \u201d material that is \u201c \u2018harmful to juveniles\u2019 \u201d as\ndefined by the statute.        Id., at 386.   At trial, the\nbooksellers introduced 16 books they believed were cov-\nered by the statute and testified that costly compliance\nmeasures would be necessary to avoid prosecution for\ndisplaying such books. Just as in Babbitt and Steffel, we\ndetermined that the \u201cpre-enforcement nature\u201d of the suit\nwas not \u201ctroubl[ing]\u201d because the plaintiffs had \u201calleged an\nactual and well-founded fear that the law will be enforced\nagainst them.\u201d 484 U. S., at 393.\n   Finally, in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561\nU. S. 1 (2010), we considered a preenforcement challenge\nto a law that criminalized \u201c \u2018 knowingly provid[ing] mate-\nrial support or resources to a foreign terrorist organiza-\ntion.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 8. The plaintiffs claimed that they had\nprovided support to groups designated as terrorist organi-\nzations prior to the law\u2019s enactment and would provide\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsimilar support in the future. The Government had\ncharged 150 persons with violating the law and declined to\ndisavow prosecution if the plaintiffs resumed their support\nof the designated organizations. We held that the claims\nwere justiciable: The plaintiffs faced a \u201c \u2018credible threat\u2019 \u201d\nof enforcement and \u201c \u2018should not be required to await and\nundergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seek-\ning relief.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 15.\n                            IV\n  Here, SBA and COAST contend that the threat of en-\nforcement of the false statement statute amounts to an\nArticle III injury in fact. We agree: Petitioners have al-\nleged a credible threat of enforcement. See Babbitt, 442\nU. S., at 298.\n                               A\n   First, petitioners have alleged \u201can intention to engage in\na course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional\ninterest.\u201d Ibid. Both petitioners have pleaded specific\nstatements they intend to make in future election cycles.\nSBA has already stated that representatives who voted for\nthe ACA supported \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion,\u201d and it has\nalleged an \u201cinten[t] to engage in substantially similar\nactivity in the future.\u201d App. 49\u201350, 122. See also Human-\nitarian Law Project, supra, at 15\u201316 (observing that plain-\ntiffs had previously provided support to groups designated\nas terrorist organizations and alleged they \u201cwould provide\nsimilar support [to the same terrorist organizations] again\nif the statute\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted\u201d).\nCOAST has alleged that it previously intended to dissemi-\nnate materials criticizing a vote for the ACA as a vote \u201cto\nfund abortions with tax dollars,\u201d and that it \u201cdesires to\nmake the same or similar statements about other federal\ncandidates who voted for [the ACA].\u201d App. 146, 149, 162.\nBecause petitioners\u2019 intended future conduct concerns\n12          SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npolitical speech, it is certainly \u201caffected with a constitu-\ntional interest.\u201d Babbitt, supra, at 298; see also Monitor\nPatriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971) (\u201c[T]he consti-\ntutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent applica-\ntion precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political\noffice\u201d).\n                               B\n   Next, petitioners\u2019 intended future conduct is \u201cargua-\nbly. . . proscribed by [the] statute\u201d they wish to challenge.\nBabbitt, supra, at 298. The Ohio false statement law\nsweeps broadly, see supra, at 1\u20132, and n. 1., and covers\nthe subject matter of petitioners\u2019 intended speech. Both\nSBA and COAST have alleged an intent to \u201c[m]ake\u201d\nstatements \u201cconcerning the voting record of a candidate or\npublic official,\u201d \u00a73517.21(B)(9), and to \u201cdisseminate\u201d\nstatements \u201cconcerning a candidate . . . to promote the\nelection, nomination, or defeat of the candidate,\u201d\n\u00a73517.21(B)(10). And, a Commission panel here already\nfound probable cause to believe that SBA violated the\nstatute when it stated that Driehaus had supported\n\u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion\u201d\u2014the same sort of statement\npetitioners plan to disseminate in the future. Under these\ncircumstances, we have no difficulty concluding that peti-\ntioners\u2019 intended speech is \u201carguably proscribed\u201d by the\nlaw.\n   Respondents incorrectly rely on Golden v. Zwickler, 394\nU. S. 103 (1969). In that case, the plaintiff had previously\ndistributed anonymous leaflets criticizing a particular\nCongressman who had since left office. Id., at 104\u2013106,\nand n. 2. The Court dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s challenge to\nthe electoral leafletting ban as nonjusticiable because his\n\u201csole concern was literature relating to the Congressman\nand his record,\u201d and \u201cit was most unlikely that the Con-\ngressman would again be a candidate.\u201d Id., at 109 (em-\nphasis added). Under those circumstances, any threat of\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfuture prosecution was \u201cwholly conjectural.\u201d Ibid.\n   Here, by contrast, petitioners\u2019 speech focuses on the\nbroader issue of support for the ACA, not on the voting\nrecord of a single candidate. See Reply Brief 4\u20135 (identify-\ning other elected officials who plan to seek reelection as\npotential objects of SBA\u2019s criticisms). Because petitioners\u2019\nalleged future speech is not directed exclusively at\nDriehaus, it does not matter whether he \u201cmay run for\noffice again.\u201d Brief for Respondents 33 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). As long as petitioners continue to engage\nin comparable electoral speech regarding support for the\nACA, that speech will remain arguably proscribed by\nOhio\u2019s false statement statute.\n   Respondents, echoing the Sixth Circuit, contend that\nSBA\u2019s fears of enforcement are misplaced because SBA\nhas not said it \u201c \u2018plans to lie or recklessly disregard the\nveracity of its speech.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 15 (quoting 525 Fed. Appx.,\nat 422). The Sixth Circuit reasoned that because SBA\n\u201ccan only be liable for making a statement \u2018knowing\u2019 it is\nfalse,\u201d SBA\u2019s insistence that its speech is factually true\n\u201cmakes the possibility of prosecution for uttering such\nstatements exceedingly slim.\u201d Id., at 422.\n   The Sixth Circuit misses the point. SBA\u2019s insistence\nthat the allegations in its press release were true did not\nprevent the Commission panel from finding probable\ncause to believe that SBA had violated the law the first\ntime around. And, there is every reason to think that\nsimilar speech in the future will result in similar proceed-\nings, notwithstanding SBA\u2019s belief in the truth of its alle-\ngations. Nothing in this Court\u2019s decisions requires a\nplaintiff who wishes to challenge the constitutionality of a\nlaw to confess that he will in fact violate that law. See,\ne.g., Babbitt, 442 U. S., at 301 (case was justiciable even\nthough plaintiffs disavowed any intent to \u201cpropagate\nuntruths\u201d).\n14          SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               C\n\n  Finally, the threat of future enforcement of the false\nstatement statute is substantial. Most obviously, there is\na history of past enforcement here: SBA was the subject of\na complaint in a recent election cycle. We have observed\nthat past enforcement against the same conduct is good\nevidence that the threat of enforcement is not \u201c \u2018 chimeri-\ncal.\u2019 \u201d Steffel, 415 U. S., at 459; cf. Clapper, 568 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 12) (plaintiffs\u2019 theory of standing was\n\u201csubstantially undermine[d]\u201d by their \u201cfail[ure] to offer\nany evidence that their communications ha[d] been moni-\ntored\u201d under the challenged statute). Here, the threat is\neven more substantial given that the Commission panel\nactually found probable cause to believe that SBA\u2019s speech\nviolated the false statement statute. Indeed future com-\nplainants may well \u201cinvoke the prior probable-cause find-\ning to prove that SBA knowingly lied.\u201d Brief for Petition-\ners 32.\n  The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that\nauthority to file a complaint with the Commission is not\nlimited to a prosecutor or an agency. Instead, the false\nstatement statute allows \u201cany person\u201d with knowledge of\nthe purported violation to file a complaint. \u00a73517.153(A).\nBecause the universe of potential complainants is not\nrestricted to state officials who are constrained by explicit\nguidelines or ethical obligations, there is a real risk of\ncomplaints from, for example, political opponents. See\nBrief for Michael DeWine, Attorney General of Ohio, as\nAmicus Curiae 8 (hereinafter DeWine Brief); see also id.,\nat 6 (noting that \u201cthe Commission has no system for weed-\ning out frivolous complaints\u201d). And petitioners, who in-\ntend to criticize candidates for political office, are easy\ntargets.\n  Finally, Commission proceedings are not a rare occur-\nrence. Petitioners inform us that the Commission \u201c \u2018han-\ndles about 20 to 80 false statement complaints per year,\u2019 \u201d\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioners 46, and respondents do not deny that\nthe Commission frequently fields complaints alleging\nviolations of the false statement statute. Cf. Humani-\ntarian Law Project, 561 U. S., at 16 (noting that there had\nbeen numerous prior prosecutions under the challenged\nstatute).    Moreover, respondents have not disavowed\nenforcement if petitioners make similar statements in the\nfuture. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\u201330; see also Humanitarian\nLaw Project, supra, at 16 (\u201cThe Government has not ar-\ngued to this Court that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if\nthey do what they say they wish to do\u201d). In fact, the spec-\nter of enforcement is so substantial that the owner of the\nbillboard refused to display SBA\u2019s message after receiving\na letter threatening Commission proceedings. On these\nfacts, the prospect of future enforcement is far from \u201cimag-\ninary or speculative.\u201d Babbitt, supra, at 298.\n   We take the threatened Commission proceedings into\naccount because administrative action, like arrest or\nprosecution, may give rise to harm sufficient to justify pre-\nenforcement review. See Ohio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n v.\nDayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U. S. 619, 625\u2013626,\nn. 1 (1986) (\u201cIf a reasonable threat of prosecution creates a\nripe controversy, we fail to see how the actual filing of the\nadministrative action threatening sanctions in this case\ndoes not\u201d). The burdens that Commission proceedings can\nimpose on electoral speech are of particular concern here.\nAs the Ohio Attorney General himself notes, the \u201cpractical\neffect\u201d of the Ohio false statement scheme is \u201cto permit a\nprivate complainant . . . to gain a campaign advantage\nwithout ever having to prove the falsity of a statement.\u201d\nDeWine Brief 7. \u201c[C]omplainants may time their submis-\nsions to achieve maximum disruption of their political\nopponents while calculating that an ultimate decision on\nthe merits will be deferred until after the relevant elec-\ntion.\u201d Id., at 14\u201315. Moreover, the target of a false state-\nment complaint may be forced to divert significant time\n16         SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST v. DRIEHAUS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand resources to hire legal counsel and respond to discov-\nery requests in the crucial days leading up to an election.\nAnd where, as here, a Commission panel issues a preelec-\ntion probable-cause finding, \u201csuch a determination itself\nmay be viewed [by the electorate] as a sanction by the\nState.\u201d Id., at 13.\n   Although the threat of Commission proceedings is a\nsubstantial one, we need not decide whether that threat\nstanding alone gives rise to an Article III injury. The\nburdensome Commission proceedings here are backed by\nthe additional threat of criminal prosecution. We conclude\nthat the combination of those two threats suffices to create\nan Article III injury under the circumstances of this case.\nSee Babbitt, supra, at 302, n. 13 (In addition to the threat\nof criminal sanctions, \u201cthe prospect of issuance of an ad-\nministrative cease-and-desist order or a court-ordered\ninjunction against such prohibited conduct provides sub-\nstantial additional support for the conclusion that appel-\nlees\u2019 challenge . . . is justiciable\u201d (citations omitted)).\n   That conclusion holds true as to both SBA and COAST.\nRespondents, relying on Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37\n(1971), appear to suggest that COAST lacks standing\nbecause it refrained from actually disseminating its\nplanned speech in order to avoid Commission proceedings\nof its own. See Brief for Respondents 26\u201327, 34. In\nYounger, the plaintiff had been indicted for distributing\nleaflets in violation of the California Criminal Syndicalism\nAct. When he challenged the constitutionality of the law\nin federal court, several other plaintiffs intervened, argu-\ning that their own speech was inhibited by Harris\u2019 prose-\ncution. The Court concluded that only the plaintiff had\nstanding because the intervenors \u201cd[id] not claim that\nthey ha[d] ever been threatened with prosecution, that a\nprosecution [wa]s likely, or even that a prosecution [wa]s\nremotely possible.\u201d 401 U. S., at 42.\n   That is not this case. Unlike the intervenors in Younger,\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCOAST has alleged an intent to engage in the same\nspeech that was the subject of a prior enforcement pro-\nceeding. Also unlike the intervenors in Younger, who had\nnever been threatened with prosecution, COAST has been\nthe subject of Commission proceedings in the past. See,\ne.g., COAST Candidates PAC v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n,\n543 Fed. Appx. 490 (CA6 2013). COAST is far more akin\nto the plaintiff in Steffel, who was not arrested alongside\nhis handbilling companion but was nevertheless threat-\nened with prosecution for similar speech. 415 U. S., at\n459.\n   In sum, we find that both SBA and COAST have alleged\na credible threat of enforcement.\n                              V\n   In concluding that petitioners\u2019 claims were not justicia-\nble, the Sixth Circuit separately considered two other\nfactors: whether the factual record was sufficiently devel-\noped, and whether hardship to the parties would result if\njudicial relief is denied at this stage in the proceedings.\n525 Fed. Appx., at 419. Respondents contend that these\n\u201cprudential ripeness\u201d factors confirm that the claims at\nissue are nonjusticiable. Brief for Respondents 17. But\nwe have already concluded that petitioners have alleged a\nsufficient Article III injury. To the extent respondents\nwould have us deem petitioners\u2019 claims nonjusticiable \u201con\ngrounds that are \u2018prudential,\u2019 rather than constitutional,\u201d\n\u201c[t]hat request is in some tension with our recent reaffir-\nmation of the principle that \u2018a federal court\u2019s obligation to\nhear and decide\u2019 cases within its jurisdiction \u2018is virtually\nunflagging.\u2019 \u201d Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v.
