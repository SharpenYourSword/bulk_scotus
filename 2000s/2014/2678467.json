NML CAPITAL, LTD.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 12\u2013842.      Argued April 21, 2014\u2014Decided June 16, 2014\nAfter petitioner, Republic of Argentina, defaulted on its external debt,\n  respondent, NML Capital, Ltd. (NML), one of Argentina\u2019s bondhold-\n  ers, prevailed in 11 debt-collection actions that it brought against Ar-\n  gentina in the Southern District of New York. In aid of executing the\n  judgments, NML sought discovery of Argentina\u2019s property, serving\n  subpoenas on two nonparty banks for records relating to Argentina\u2019s\n  global financial transactions. The District Court granted NML\u2019s mo-\n  tions to compel compliance. The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting\n  Argentina\u2019s argument that the District Court\u2019s order transgressed\n  the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act).\nHeld: No provision in the FSIA immunizes a foreign-sovereign judg-\n ment debtor from postjudgment discovery of information concerning\n its extraterritorial assets. Pp. 4\u201312.\n    (a) This Court assumes without deciding that, in the ordinary case,\n a district court would have the discretion under Federal Rule of Civil\n Procedure 69(a)(2) to permit discovery of third-party information\n bearing on a judgment debtor\u2019s extraterritorial assets. Pp. 4\u20135.\n    (b) The FSIA replaced an executive-driven, factor-intensive, loosely\n common-law-based immunity regime with \u201ca comprehensive frame-\n work for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity.\u201d Republic of\n Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677, 699. Henceforth, any sort of im-\n munity defense made by a foreign sovereign in an American court\n must stand or fall on the Act\u2019s text. The Act confers on foreign states\n two kinds of immunity. The first, jurisdictional immunity (28\n U. S. C. \u00a71604), was waived here. The second, execution immunity,\n generally shields \u201cproperty in the United States of a foreign state\u201d\n from attachment, arrest, and execution. \u00a7\u00a71609, 1610. See also\n \u00a71611(a), (b)(1), (b)(2). The Act has no third provision forbidding or\n2         REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v.

Far from containing the \u201cplain statement\u201d necessary\n    to preclude application of federal discovery rules, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale\n    Industrielle A\u00e9rospatiale v. United States Dist. Court for Southern\n    Dist. of Iowa, 482 U. S. 522, 539, the Act says not a word about\n    postjudgment discovery in aid of execution.\n      Argentina\u2019s arguments are unavailing. Even if Argentina were\n    correct that \u00a71609 execution immunity implies coextensive discovery-\n    in-aid-of-execution immunity, the latter would not shield from dis-\n    covery a foreign sovereign\u2019s extraterritorial assets, since the text of\n    \u00a71609 immunizes only foreign-state property \u201cin the United States.\u201d\n    The prospect that NML\u2019s general request for information about Ar-\n    gentina\u2019s worldwide assets may turn up information about property\n    that Argentina regards as immune does not mean that NML cannot\n    pursue discovery of it.

NML \n\n                 CAPITAL, LTD.\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                  [June 16, 2014] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   We must decide whether the Foreign Sovereign Immu-\nnities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71330, 1602\net seq., limits the scope of discovery available to a judg\u00ad\nment creditor in a federal postjudgment execution pro\u00ad\nceeding against a foreign sovereign.\n                        I. Background\n   In 2001, petitioner, Republic of Argentina, defaulted on\nits external debt. In 2005 and 2010, it restructured most\nof that debt by offering creditors new securities (with less\nfavorable terms) to swap out for the defaulted ones. Most\nbondholders went along. Respondent, NML Capital, Ltd.\n(NML), among others, did not.\n   NML brought 11 actions against Argentina in the\nSouthern District of New York to collect on its debt, and\nprevailed in every one.1 It is owed around $2.5 billion,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The District Court\u2019s jurisdiction rested on Argentina\u2019s broad waiver\n\nof sovereign immunity memorialized in its bond indenture agreement,\nwhich states: \u201cTo the extent that [Argentina] or any of its revenues,\nassets or properties shall be entitled . . . to any immunity from suit . . .\nfrom attachment prior to judgment . . . from execution of a judgment or\n2       REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich Argentina has not paid. Having been unable to\ncollect on its judgments from Argentina, NML has at\u00ad\ntempted to execute them against Argentina\u2019s property.\nThat postjudgment litigation \u201chas involved lengthy at\u00ad\ntachment proceedings before the district court and multi\u00ad\nple appeals.\u201d EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 695 F. 3d\n201, 203, and n. 2 (CA2 2012) (referring the reader to prior\nopinions \u201c[f]or additional background on Argentina\u2019s de\u00ad\nfault and the resulting litigation\u201d).\n   Since 2003, NML has pursued discovery of Argentina\u2019s\nproperty. In 2010, \u201c \u2018[i]n order to locate Argentina\u2019s assets\nand accounts, learn how Argentina moves its assets\nthrough New York and around the world, and accurately\nidentify the places and times when those assets might be\nsubject to attachment and execution (whether under\n[United States law] or the law of foreign jurisdictions),\u2019 \u201d\nid., at 203 (quoting NML brief), NML served subpoenas on\ntwo nonparty banks, Bank of America (BOA) and Banco de\nla Naci\u00f3n Argentina (BNA), an Argentinian bank with a\nbranch in New York City. For the most part, the two\nsubpoenas target the same kinds of information: docu\u00ad\nments relating to accounts maintained by or on behalf of\nArgentina, documents identifying the opening and closing\ndates of Argentina\u2019s accounts, current balances, transac\u00ad\ntion histories, records of electronic fund transfers, debts\nowed by the bank to Argentina, transfers in and out of\nArgentina\u2019s accounts, and information about transferors\nand transferees.\n   Argentina, joined by BOA, moved to quash the BOA\nsubpoena. NML moved to compel compliance but, before\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfrom any other legal or judicial process or remedy, . . . [Argentina] has\nirrevocably agreed not to claim and has irrevocably waived such im\u00ad\nmunity to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction\n(and consents generally for the purposes of the [FSIA] to the giving of\nany relief or the issue of any process in connection with any Related\nProceeding or Related Judgment) . . . .\u201d App. 106\u2013107.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe court ruled, agreed to narrow its subpoenas by exclud\u00ad\ning the names of some Argentine officials from the ini-\ntial electronic-fund-transfer message search. NML also\nagreed to treat as confidential any documents that the\nbanks so designated.\n   The District Court denied the motion to quash and\ngranted the motions to compel. Approving the subpoenas\nin principle, it concluded that extraterritorial asset discov\u00ad\nery did not offend Argentina\u2019s sovereign immunity, and it\nreaffirmed that it would serve as a \u201cclearinghouse for\ninformation\u201d in NML\u2019s efforts to find and attach Argenti\u00ad\nna\u2019s assets. App. to Pet. for Cert. 31. But the court made\nclear that it expected the parties to negotiate further over\nspecific production requests, which, the court said, must\ninclude \u201csome reasonable definition of the information\nbeing sought.\u201d Id., at 32. There was no point, for in\u00ad\nstance, in \u201cgetting information about something that\nmight lead to attachment in Argentina because that would\nbe useless information,\u201d since no Argentinian court would\nallow attachment. Ibid. \u201cThus, the district court . . .\nsought to limit the subpoenas to discovery that was rea\u00ad\nsonably calculated to lead to attachable property.\u201d 695\nF. 3d, at 204\u2013205.\n   NML and BOA later negotiated additional changes to\nthe BOA subpoena. NML expressed its willingness to\nnarrow its requests from BNA as well, but BNA neither\nengaged in negotiation nor complied with the subpoena.\n   Only Argentina appealed, arguing that the court\u2019s order\ntransgressed the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act be\u00ad\ncause it permitted discovery of Argentina\u2019s extraterritorial\nassets. The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that \u201cbe\u00ad\ncause the Discovery Order involves discovery, not attach\u00ad\nment of sovereign property, and because it is directed at\nthird-party banks, not at Argentina itself, Argentina\u2019s\nsovereign immunity is not infringed.\u201d Id., at 205.\n   We granted certiorari. 571 U. S. ___ (2014).\n4      REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                         II. Analysis\n                              A\n   The rules governing discovery in postjudgment execu\u00ad\ntion proceedings are quite permissive. Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 69(a)(2) states that, \u201c[i]n aid of the judg\u00ad\nment or execution, the judgment creditor . . . may obtain\ndiscovery from any person\u2014including the judgment debtor\u2014\nas provided in the rules or by the procedure of the\nstate where the court is located.\u201d See 12 C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & R. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a73014, p. 160 (2d ed. 1997) (hereinafter Wright & Miller)\n(court \u201cmay use the discovery devices provided in [the\nfederal rules] or may obtain discovery in the manner\nprovided by the practice of the state in which the district\ncourt is held\u201d). The general rule in the federal system is\nthat, subject to the district court\u2019s discretion, \u201c[p]arties\nmay obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter\nthat is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense.\u201d Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 26(b)(1). And New York law entitles judgment\ncreditors to discover \u201call matter relevant to the satisfac\u00ad\ntion of [a] judgment,\u201d N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a75223\n(West 1997), permitting \u201cinvestigation [of] any person\nshown to have any light to shed on the subject of the\njudgment debtor\u2019s assets or their whereabouts,\u201d D. Siegel,\nNew York Practice \u00a7509, p. 891 (5th ed. 2011).\n   The meaning of those rules was much discussed at oral\nargument. What if the assets targeted by the discovery\nrequest are beyond the jurisdictional reach of the court to\nwhich the request is made? May the court nonetheless\npermit discovery so long as the judgment creditor shows\nthat the assets are recoverable under the laws of the\njurisdictions in which they reside, whether that be Florida\nor France? We need not take up those issues today, since\nArgentina has not put them in contention. In the Court of\nAppeals, Argentina\u2019s only asserted ground for objection to\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe subpoenas was the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\nSee 695 F. 3d, at 208 (\u201cArgentina argues . . . that the\nnormally broad scope of discovery in aid of execution is\nlimited in this case by principles of sovereign immunity\u201d).\nAnd Argentina\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari asked us to\ndecide only whether that Act \u201cimposes [a] limit on a United\nStates court\u2019s authority to order blanket post-judgment\nexecution discovery on the assets of a foreign state used\nfor any activity anywhere in the world.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 14.\nPlainly, then, this is not a case about the breadth of Rule\n69(a)(2).2 We thus assume without deciding that, as the\nGovernment conceded at argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 24,\nand as the Second Circuit concluded below, \u201cin a run-of\u00ad\nthe-mill execution proceeding . . . the district court would\nhave been within its discretion to order the discovery from\nthird-party banks about the judgment debtor\u2019s assets\nlocated outside the United States.\u201d 695 F. 3d, at 208. The\nsingle, narrow question before us is whether the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act specifies a different rule when\nthe judgment debtor is a foreign state.\n                             B\n  To understand the effect of the Act, one must know\nsomething about the regime it replaced. Foreign sovereign\nimmunity is, and always has been, \u201ca matter of grace and\ncomity on the part of the United States, and not a re\u00ad\nstriction imposed by the Constitution.\u201d Verlinden B. V. v.\nCentral Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983). Ac\u00ad\ncordingly, this Court\u2019s practice has been to \u201cdefe[r] to the\ndecisions of the political branches\u201d about whether and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 On one of the final pages of its reply brief, Argentina makes for the\n\nfirst time the assertion (which it does not develop, and for which it cites\nno authority) that the scope of Rule 69 discovery in aid of execution is\nlimited to assets upon which a United States court can execute. Reply\nBrief 19. We will not revive a forfeited argument simply because the\npetitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief.\n6      REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen to exercise judicial power over foreign states. Ibid.\nFor the better part of the last two centuries, the political\nbranch making the determination was the Executive,\nwhich typically requested immunity in all suits against\nfriendly foreign states. Id., at 486\u2013487. But then, in 1952,\nthe State Department embraced (in the so-called Tate\nLetter) the \u201crestrictive\u201d theory of sovereign immunity,\nwhich holds that immunity shields only a foreign sover\u00ad\neign\u2019s public, noncommercial acts. Id., at 487, and n. 9.\nThe Tate Letter \u201cthr[ew] immunity determinations into\nsome disarray,\u201d since \u201cpolitical considerations sometimes\nled the Department to file suggestions of immunity in\ncases where immunity would not have been available\nunder the restrictive theory.\u201d Republic of Austria v. Alt\u00ad\nmann, 541 U. S. 677, 690 (2004) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Further muddling matters, when in particular\ncases the State Department did not suggest immunity,\ncourts made immunity determinations \u201cgenerally by refer\u00ad\nence to prior State Department decisions.\u201d Verlinden, 461\nU. S., at 487. Hence it was that \u201csovereign immunity\ndecisions were [being] made in two different branches,\nsubject to a variety of factors, sometimes including diplo\u00ad\nmatic considerations. Not surprisingly, the governing\nstandards were neither clear nor uniformly applied.\u201d Id.,\nat 488.\n   Congress abated the bedlam in 1976, replacing the old\nexecutive-driven, factor-intensive, loosely common-law\u00ad\nbased immunity regime with the Foreign Sovereign Im\u00ad\nmunities Act\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive set of legal standards\ngoverning claims of immunity in every civil action against\na foreign state.\u201d Ibid. The key word there\u2014which goes a\nlong way toward deciding this case\u2014is comprehensive. We\nhave used that term often and advisedly to describe the\nAct\u2019s sweep: \u201cCongress established [in the FSIA] a com\u00ad\nprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign\nimmunity.\u201d Altman, 541 U. S., at 699. The Act \u201ccompre\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhensively regulat[es] the amenability of foreign nations to\nsuit in the United States.\u201d Verlinden, supra, at 493. This\nmeans that \u201c[a]fter the enactment of the FSIA, the Act\u2014\nand not the pre-existing common law\u2014indisputably gov\u00ad\nerns the determination of whether a foreign state is enti\u00ad\ntled to sovereign immunity.\u201d Samantar v. Yousuf, 560\nU. S. 305, 313 (2010). As the Act itself instructs, \u201c[c]laims\nof foreign states to immunity should henceforth be decided\nby courts . . . in conformity with the principles set forth in\nthis [Act].\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71602 (emphasis added). Thus, any\nsort of immunity defense made by a foreign sovereign in\nan American court must stand on the Act\u2019s text. Or it\nmust fall.\n   The text of the Act confers on foreign states two kinds of\nimmunity. First and most significant, \u201ca foreign state\nshall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the\nUnited States . . . except as provided in sections 1605 to\n1607.\u201d \u00a71604. That provision is of no help to Argentina\nhere: A foreign state may waive jurisdictional immunity,\n\u00a71605(a)(1), and in this case Argentina did so, see 695\nF. 3d, at 203. Consequently, the Act makes Argentina\n\u201cliable in the same manner and to the same extent as a\nprivate individual under like circumstances.\u201d \u00a71606.\n   The Act\u2019s second immunity-conferring provision states\nthat \u201cthe property in the United States of a foreign state\nshall be immune from attachment[,] arrest[,] and execu\u00ad\ntion except as provided in sections 1610 and 1611 of this\nchapter.\u201d \u00a71609. The exceptions to this immunity defense\n(we will call it \u201cexecution immunity\u201d) are narrower. \u201cThe\nproperty in the United States of a foreign state\u201d is subject\nto attachment, arrest, or execution if (1) it is \u201cused for a\ncommercial activity in the United States,\u201d \u00a71610(a), and\n(2) some other enumerated exception to immunity applies,\nsuch as the one allowing for waiver, see \u00a71610(a)(1)\u2013(7).\nThe Act goes on to confer a more robust execution immu\u00ad\nnity on designated international-organization property,\n8       REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71611(a), property of a foreign central bank, \u00a71611(b)(1),\nand \u201cproperty of a foreign state . . . [that] is, or is intended\nto be, used in connection with a military activity\u201d and is\neither \u201cof a military character\u201d or \u201cunder the control of a\nmilitary authority or defense agency,\u201d \u00a71611(b)(2).\n  That is the last of the Act\u2019s immunity-granting sections.\nThere is no third provision forbidding or limiting discovery\nin aid of execution of a foreign-sovereign judgment debt\u00ad\nor\u2019s assets. Argentina concedes that no part of the Act\n\u201cexpressly address[es] [postjudgment] discovery.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 22. Quite right. The Act speaks of discovery\nonly once, in an subsection requiring courts to stay discov\u00ad\nery requests directed to the United States that would\ninterfere with criminal or national-security matters,\n\u00a71605(g)(1). And that section explicitly suspends certain\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure when such a stay is\nentered, see \u00a71605(g)(4). Elsewhere, it is clear when the\nAct\u2019s provisions specifically applicable to suits against\nsovereigns displace their general federal-rule counter\u00ad\nparts. See, e.g., \u00a71608(d). Far from containing the \u201cplain\nstatement\u201d necessary to preclude application of federal\ndiscovery rules, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale Industrielle A\u00e9rospatiale\nv. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa,\n482 U. S. 522, 539 (1987), the Act says not a word on the\nsubject.3\n  Argentina would have us draw meaning from this si\u00ad\nlence. Its argument has several parts. First, it asserts\nthat, before and after the Tate Letter, the State Depart\u00ad\nment and American courts routinely accorded absolute\nexecution immunity to foreign-state property. If a thing\nbelonged to a foreign sovereign, then, no matter where it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Argentina and the United States suggest that, under the terms of\n\nRule 69 itself, the Act trumps the federal rules, since Rule 69(a)(1)\nstates that \u201ca federal statute governs to the extent it applies.\u201d But,\nsince the Act does not contain implicit discovery-immunity protections,\nit does not \u201capply\u201d (in the relevant sense) at all.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas found, it was immune from execution. And absolute\nimmunity from execution necessarily entailed immunity\nfrom discovery in aid of execution. Second, by codifying\nexecution immunity with only a small set of exceptions,\nCongress merely \u201cpartially lowered the previously uncon\u00ad\nditional barrier to post-judgment relief.\u201d Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 29. Because the Act gives \u201cno indication that it was\nauthorizing courts to inquire into state property beyond\nthe court\u2019s limited enforcement authority,\u201d ibid., Argen\u00ad\ntina contends, discovery of assets that do not fall within an\nexception to execution immunity (plainly true of a foreign\nstate\u2019s extraterritorial assets) is forbidden.\n   The argument founders at each step. To begin with,\nArgentina cites no case holding that, before the Act, a\nforeign state\u2019s extraterritorial assets enjoyed absolute\nexecution immunity in United States courts. No surprise\nthere. Our courts generally lack authority in the first\nplace to execute against property in other countries, so\nhow could the question ever have arisen? See Wright &\nMiller \u00a73013, at 156 (\u201c[A] writ of execution . . . can be\nserved anywhere within the state in which the district\ncourt is held\u201d). More importantly, even if Argentina were\nright about the scope of the common-law execution\u00ad\nimmunity rule, then it would be obvious that the terms of\n\u00a71609 execution immunity are narrower, since the text of\nthat provision immunizes only foreign-state property \u201cin\nthe United States.\u201d So even if Argentina were correct that\n\u00a71609 execution immunity implies coextensive discovery\u00ad\nin-aid-of-execution immunity, the latter would not shield\nfrom discovery a foreign sovereign\u2019s extraterritorial assets.\n   But what of foreign-state property that would enjoy\nexecution immunity under the Act, such as Argentina\u2019s\ndiplomatic or military property? Argentina maintains\nthat, if a judgment creditor could not ultimately execute a\njudgment against certain property, then it has no business\npursuing discovery of information pertaining to that prop\u00ad\n10      REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nerty. But the reason for these subpoenas is that NML does\nnot yet know what property Argentina has and where it is,\nlet alone whether it is executable under the relevant\njurisdiction\u2019s law. If, bizarrely, NML\u2019s subpoenas had\nsought only \u201cinformation that could not lead to executable\nassets in the United States or abroad,\u201d then Argentina\nlikely would be correct to say that the subpoenas were\nunenforceable\u2014not because information about nonexecut\u00ad\nable assets enjoys a penumbral \u201cdiscovery immunity\u201d\nunder the Act, but because information that could not\npossibly lead to executable assets is simply not \u201crelevant\u201d\nto execution in the first place, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n26(b)(1); N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a75223.4 But of course\nthat is not what the subpoenas seek. They ask for infor\u00ad\nmation about Argentina\u2019s worldwide assets generally, so\nthat NML can identify where Argentina may be holding\nproperty that is subject to execution. To be sure, that\nrequest is bound to turn up information about property\nthat Argentina regards as immune. But NML may think\nthe same property not immune. In which case, Argenti\u00ad\nna\u2019s self-serving legal assertion will not automatically\nprevail; the District Court will have to settle the matter.\n                       *    *    *\n  Today\u2019s decision leaves open what Argentina thinks is a\ngap in the statute. Could the 1976 Congress really have\nmeant not to protect foreign states from postjudgment\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The dissent apparently agrees that the Act has nothing to say about\n\nthe scope of postjudgment discovery of a foreign sovereign\u2019s extraterri\u00ad\ntorial assets. It also apparently agrees that the rules limit discovery to\nmatters relevant to execution. Our agreement ends there. The dissent\ngoes on to assert that, unless a judgment creditor proves up front that\nall of the information it seeks is relevant to execution under the laws of\nall foreign jurisdictions, discovery of information concerning extraterri\u00ad\ntorial assets is limited to that which the Act makes relevant to execu\u00ad\ntion in the United States.

It is of course possible that, had\nCongress anticipated the rather unusual circumstances of\nthis case (foreign sovereign waives immunity; foreign\nsovereign owes money under valid judgments; foreign\nsovereign does not pay and apparently has no executable\nassets in the United States), it would have added to the\nAct a sentence conferring categorical discovery-in-aid-of\u00ad\nexecution immunity on a foreign state\u2019s extraterritorial\nassets. Or, just as possible, it would have done no such\nthing. Either way, \u201c[t]he question . . . is not what Con\u00ad\ngress \u2018would have wanted\u2019 but what Congress enacted in\nthe FSIA.\u201d Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504\nU.

Without proof of any kind that other nations\nbroadly expose a foreign sovereign\u2019s property to arrest,\nattachment or execution, a more modest assumption is in\norder. See EM Ltd. v.

Argued April 21, 2014\u2014Decided June 16, 2014\nAfter petitioner, Republic of Argentina, defaulted on its external debt,\n  respondent, NML Capital, Ltd. (NML), one of Argentina\u2019s bondhold-\n  ers, prevailed in 11 debt-collection actions that it brought against Ar-\n  gentina in the Southern District of New York. In aid of executing the\n  judgments, NML sought discovery of Argentina\u2019s property, serving\n  subpoenas on two nonparty banks for records relating to Argentina\u2019s\n  global financial transactions.

The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting\n  Argentina\u2019s argument that the District Court\u2019s order transgressed\n  the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act).\nHeld: No provision in the FSIA immunizes a foreign-sovereign judg-\n ment debtor from postjudgment discovery of information concerning\n its extraterritorial assets. Pp. 4\u201312.\n    (a) This Court assumes without deciding that, in the ordinary case,\n a district court would have the discretion under Federal Rule of Civil\n Procedure 69(a)(2) to permit discovery of third-party information\n bearing on a judgment debtor\u2019s extraterritorial assets.

The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that \u201cbe\u00ad\ncause the Discovery Order involves discovery, not attach\u00ad\nment of sovereign property, and because it is directed at\nthird-party banks, not at Argentina itself, Argentina\u2019s\nsovereign immunity is not infringed.\u201d Id., at 205.\n   We granted certiorari. 571 U.

Analysis\n                              A\n   The rules governing discovery in postjudgment execu\u00ad\ntion proceedings are quite permissive. Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 69(a)(2) states that, \u201c[i]n aid of the judg\u00ad\nment or execution, the judgment creditor . . . may obtain\ndiscovery from any person\u2014including the judgment debtor\u2014\nas provided in the rules or by the procedure of the\nstate where the court is located.\u201d See 12 C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & R. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a73014, p. 160 (2d ed. 1997) (hereinafter Wright & Miller)\n(court \u201cmay use the discovery devices provided in [the\nfederal rules] or may obtain discovery in the manner\nprovided by the practice of the state in which the district\ncourt is held\u201d). The general rule in the federal system is\nthat, subject to the district court\u2019s discretion, \u201c[p]arties\nmay obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter\nthat is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense.\u201d Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 26(b)(1). And New York law entitles judgment\ncreditors to discover \u201call matter relevant to the satisfac\u00ad\ntion of [a] judgment,\u201d N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a75223\n(West 1997), permitting \u201cinvestigation [of] any person\nshown to have any light to shed on the subject of the\njudgment debtor\u2019s assets or their whereabouts,\u201d D. Siegel,\nNew York Practice \u00a7509, p. 891 (5th ed. 2011).\n   The meaning of those rules was much discussed at oral\nargument. What if the assets targeted by the discovery\nrequest are beyond the jurisdictional reach of the court to\nwhich the request is made? May the court nonetheless\npermit discovery so long as the judgment creditor shows\nthat the assets are recoverable under the laws of the\njurisdictions in which they reside, whether that be Florida\nor France? We need not take up those issues today, since\nArgentina has not put them in contention. In the Court of\nAppeals, Argentina\u2019s only asserted ground for objection to\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe subpoenas was the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\nSee 695 F. 3d, at 208 (\u201cArgentina argues . . . that the\nnormally broad scope of discovery in aid of execution is\nlimited in this case by principles of sovereign immunity\u201d).\nAnd Argentina\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari asked us to\ndecide only whether that Act \u201cimposes [a] limit on a United\nStates court\u2019s authority to order blanket post-judgment\nexecution discovery on the assets of a foreign state used\nfor any activity anywhere in the world.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 14.\nPlainly, then, this is not a case about the breadth of Rule\n69(a)(2).2 We thus assume without deciding that, as the\nGovernment conceded at argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 24,\nand as the Second Circuit concluded below, \u201cin a run-of\u00ad\nthe-mill execution proceeding . . . the district court would\nhave been within its discretion to order the discovery from\nthird-party banks about the judgment debtor\u2019s assets\nlocated outside the United States.\u201d 695 F. 3d, at 208. The\nsingle, narrow question before us is whether the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act specifies a different rule when\nthe judgment debtor is a foreign state.\n                             B\n  To understand the effect of the Act, one must know\nsomething about the regime it replaced. Foreign sovereign\nimmunity is, and always has been, \u201ca matter of grace and\ncomity on the part of the United States, and not a re\u00ad\nstriction imposed by the Constitution.\u201d Verlinden B. V. v.\nCentral Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983). Ac\u00ad\ncordingly, this Court\u2019s practice has been to \u201cdefe[r] to the\ndecisions of the political branches\u201d about whether and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 On one of the final pages of its reply brief, Argentina makes for the\n\nfirst time the assertion (which it does not develop, and for which it cites\nno authority) that the scope of Rule 69 discovery in aid of execution is\nlimited to assets upon which a United States court can execute. Reply\nBrief 19. We will not revive a forfeited argument simply because the\npetitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief.\n6      REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen to exercise judicial power over foreign states. Ibid.\nFor the better part of the last two centuries, the political\nbranch making the determination was the Executive,\nwhich typically requested immunity in all suits against\nfriendly foreign states. Id., at 486\u2013487. But then, in 1952,\nthe State Department embraced (in the so-called Tate\nLetter) the \u201crestrictive\u201d theory of sovereign immunity,\nwhich holds that immunity shields only a foreign sover\u00ad\neign\u2019s public, noncommercial acts. Id., at 487, and n. 9.\nThe Tate Letter \u201cthr[ew] immunity determinations into\nsome disarray,\u201d since \u201cpolitical considerations sometimes\nled the Department to file suggestions of immunity in\ncases where immunity would not have been available\nunder the restrictive theory.\u201d Republic of Austria v. Alt\u00ad\nmann, 541 U. S. 677, 690 (2004) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Further muddling matters, when in particular\ncases the State Department did not suggest immunity,\ncourts made immunity determinations \u201cgenerally by refer\u00ad\nence to prior State Department decisions.\u201d Verlinden, 461\nU. S., at 487. Hence it was that \u201csovereign immunity\ndecisions were [being] made in two different branches,\nsubject to a variety of factors, sometimes including diplo\u00ad\nmatic considerations. Not surprisingly, the governing\nstandards were neither clear nor uniformly applied.\u201d Id.,\nat 488.\n   Congress abated the bedlam in 1976, replacing the old\nexecutive-driven, factor-intensive, loosely common-law\u00ad\nbased immunity regime with the Foreign Sovereign Im\u00ad\nmunities Act\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive set of legal standards\ngoverning claims of immunity in every civil action against\na foreign state.\u201d Ibid. The key word there\u2014which goes a\nlong way toward deciding this case\u2014is comprehensive. We\nhave used that term often and advisedly to describe the\nAct\u2019s sweep: \u201cCongress established [in the FSIA] a com\u00ad\nprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign\nimmunity.\u201d Altman, 541 U. S., at 699. The Act \u201ccompre\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhensively regulat[es] the amenability of foreign nations to\nsuit in the United States.\u201d Verlinden, supra, at 493. This\nmeans that \u201c[a]fter the enactment of the FSIA, the Act\u2014\nand not the pre-existing common law\u2014indisputably gov\u00ad\nerns the determination of whether a foreign state is enti\u00ad\ntled to sovereign immunity.\u201d Samantar v. Yousuf, 560\nU. S. 305, 313 (2010). As the Act itself instructs, \u201c[c]laims\nof foreign states to immunity should henceforth be decided\nby courts . . . in conformity with the principles set forth in\nthis [Act].\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71602 (emphasis added). Thus, any\nsort of immunity defense made by a foreign sovereign in\nan American court must stand on the Act\u2019s text. Or it\nmust fall.\n   The text of the Act confers on foreign states two kinds of\nimmunity. First and most significant, \u201ca foreign state\nshall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the\nUnited States . . . except as provided in sections 1605 to\n1607.\u201d \u00a71604. That provision is of no help to Argentina\nhere: A foreign state may waive jurisdictional immunity,\n\u00a71605(a)(1), and in this case Argentina did so, see 695\nF. 3d, at 203. Consequently, the Act makes Argentina\n\u201cliable in the same manner and to the same extent as a\nprivate individual under like circumstances.\u201d \u00a71606.\n   The Act\u2019s second immunity-conferring provision states\nthat \u201cthe property in the United States of a foreign state\nshall be immune from attachment[,] arrest[,] and execu\u00ad\ntion except as provided in sections 1610 and 1611 of this\nchapter.\u201d \u00a71609. The exceptions to this immunity defense\n(we will call it \u201cexecution immunity\u201d) are narrower. \u201cThe\nproperty in the United States of a foreign state\u201d is subject\nto attachment, arrest, or execution if (1) it is \u201cused for a\ncommercial activity in the United States,\u201d \u00a71610(a), and\n(2) some other enumerated exception to immunity applies,\nsuch as the one allowing for waiver, see \u00a71610(a)(1)\u2013(7).\nThe Act goes on to confer a more robust execution immu\u00ad\nnity on designated international-organization property,\n8       REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71611(a), property of a foreign central bank, \u00a71611(b)(1),\nand \u201cproperty of a foreign state . . . [that] is, or is intended\nto be, used in connection with a military activity\u201d and is\neither \u201cof a military character\u201d or \u201cunder the control of a\nmilitary authority or defense agency,\u201d \u00a71611(b)(2).\n  That is the last of the Act\u2019s immunity-granting sections.\nThere is no third provision forbidding or limiting discovery\nin aid of execution of a foreign-sovereign judgment debt\u00ad\nor\u2019s assets. Argentina concedes that no part of the Act\n\u201cexpressly address[es] [postjudgment] discovery.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 22. Quite right. The Act speaks of discovery\nonly once, in an subsection requiring courts to stay discov\u00ad\nery requests directed to the United States that would\ninterfere with criminal or national-security matters,\n\u00a71605(g)(1). And that section explicitly suspends certain\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure when such a stay is\nentered, see \u00a71605(g)(4). Elsewhere, it is clear when the\nAct\u2019s provisions specifically applicable to suits against\nsovereigns displace their general federal-rule counter\u00ad\nparts. See, e.g., \u00a71608(d). Far from containing the \u201cplain\nstatement\u201d necessary to preclude application of federal\ndiscovery rules, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale Industrielle A\u00e9rospatiale\nv. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa,\n482 U. S. 522, 539 (1987), the Act says not a word on the\nsubject.3\n  Argentina would have us draw meaning from this si\u00ad\nlence. Its argument has several parts. First, it asserts\nthat, before and after the Tate Letter, the State Depart\u00ad\nment and American courts routinely accorded absolute\nexecution immunity to foreign-state property. If a thing\nbelonged to a foreign sovereign, then, no matter where it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Argentina and the United States suggest that, under the terms of\n\nRule 69 itself, the Act trumps the federal rules, since Rule 69(a)(1)\nstates that \u201ca federal statute governs to the extent it applies.\u201d But,\nsince the Act does not contain implicit discovery-immunity protections,\nit does not \u201capply\u201d (in the relevant sense) at all.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas found, it was immune from execution. And absolute\nimmunity from execution necessarily entailed immunity\nfrom discovery in aid of execution. Second, by codifying\nexecution immunity with only a small set of exceptions,\nCongress merely \u201cpartially lowered the previously uncon\u00ad\nditional barrier to post-judgment relief.\u201d Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 29. Because the Act gives \u201cno indication that it was\nauthorizing courts to inquire into state property beyond\nthe court\u2019s limited enforcement authority,\u201d ibid., Argen\u00ad\ntina contends, discovery of assets that do not fall within an\nexception to execution immunity (plainly true of a foreign\nstate\u2019s extraterritorial assets) is forbidden.\n   The argument founders at each step. To begin with,\nArgentina cites no case holding that, before the Act, a\nforeign state\u2019s extraterritorial assets enjoyed absolute\nexecution immunity in United States courts. No surprise\nthere. Our courts generally lack authority in the first\nplace to execute against property in other countries, so\nhow could the question ever have arisen? See Wright &\nMiller \u00a73013, at 156 (\u201c[A] writ of execution . . . can be\nserved anywhere within the state in which the district\ncourt is held\u201d). More importantly, even if Argentina were\nright about the scope of the common-law execution\u00ad\nimmunity rule, then it would be obvious that the terms of\n\u00a71609 execution immunity are narrower, since the text of\nthat provision immunizes only foreign-state property \u201cin\nthe United States.\u201d So even if Argentina were correct that\n\u00a71609 execution immunity implies coextensive discovery\u00ad\nin-aid-of-execution immunity, the latter would not shield\nfrom discovery a foreign sovereign\u2019s extraterritorial assets.\n   But what of foreign-state property that would enjoy\nexecution immunity under the Act, such as Argentina\u2019s\ndiplomatic or military property? Argentina maintains\nthat, if a judgment creditor could not ultimately execute a\njudgment against certain property, then it has no business\npursuing discovery of information pertaining to that prop\u00ad\n10      REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nerty. But the reason for these subpoenas is that NML does\nnot yet know what property Argentina has and where it is,\nlet alone whether it is executable under the relevant\njurisdiction\u2019s law. If, bizarrely, NML\u2019s subpoenas had\nsought only \u201cinformation that could not lead to executable\nassets in the United States or abroad,\u201d then Argentina\nlikely would be correct to say that the subpoenas were\nunenforceable\u2014not because information about nonexecut\u00ad\nable assets enjoys a penumbral \u201cdiscovery immunity\u201d\nunder the Act, but because information that could not\npossibly lead to executable assets is simply not \u201crelevant\u201d\nto execution in the first place, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n26(b)(1); N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a75223.4 But of course\nthat is not what the subpoenas seek. They ask for infor\u00ad\nmation about Argentina\u2019s worldwide assets generally, so\nthat NML can identify where Argentina may be holding\nproperty that is subject to execution. To be sure, that\nrequest is bound to turn up information about property\nthat Argentina regards as immune. But NML may think\nthe same property not immune. In which case, Argenti\u00ad\nna\u2019s self-serving legal assertion will not automatically\nprevail; the District Court will have to settle the matter.\n                       *    *    *\n  Today\u2019s decision leaves open what Argentina thinks is a\ngap in the statute. Could the 1976 Congress really have\nmeant not to protect foreign states from postjudgment\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The dissent apparently agrees that the Act has nothing to say about\n\nthe scope of postjudgment discovery of a foreign sovereign\u2019s extraterri\u00ad\ntorial assets. It also apparently agrees that the rules limit discovery to\nmatters relevant to execution. Our agreement ends there. The dissent\ngoes on to assert that, unless a judgment creditor proves up front that\nall of the information it seeks is relevant to execution under the laws of\nall foreign jurisdictions, discovery of information concerning extraterri\u00ad\ntorial assets is limited to that which the Act makes relevant to execu\u00ad\ntion in the United States. Post, at 2 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). We can\nfind no basis in the Act or the rules for that position.\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

It is of course possible that, had\nCongress anticipated the rather unusual circumstances of\nthis case (foreign sovereign waives immunity; foreign\nsovereign owes money under valid judgments; foreign\nsovereign does not pay and apparently has no executable\nassets in the United States), it would have added to the\nAct a sentence conferring categorical discovery-in-aid-of\u00ad\nexecution immunity on a foreign state\u2019s extraterritorial\nassets. Or, just as possible, it would have done no such\nthing. Either way, \u201c[t]he question . . . is not what Con\u00ad\ngress \u2018would have wanted\u2019 but what Congress enacted in\nthe FSIA.\u201d Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504\nU. S. 607, 618 (1992).5\n   Nonetheless, Argentina and the United States urge us\nto consider the worrisome international-relations conse\u00ad\nquences of siding with the lower court. Discovery orders\nas sweeping as this one, the Government warns, will cause\n\u201ca substantial invasion of [foreign states\u2019] sovereignty,\u201d\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18, and will\n\u201c[u]ndermin[e] international comity,\u201d id., at 19.

Republic of Argentina, 695 F. 3d\n201, 207 (CA2 2012) (recognizing that postjudgment dis-\ncovery \u201cmust be calculated to assist in collecting on a\njudgment\u201d (citing Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1), 69(a)(2))).\n   Unless and until the judgment debtor, here, NML,\nproves that other nations would allow unconstrained\naccess to Argentina\u2019s assets, I would be guided by the one\nlaw we know for sure\u2014our own. That guide is all the\nmore appropriate, as our law coincides with the interna-\ntional norm. See \u00a71602. Accordingly, I would limit NML\u2019s\ndiscovery to property used here or abroad \u201cin connection\nwith . . . commercial activities.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71602, 1610(a). I there-\nfore dissent from the sweeping examination of Argentina\u2019s\nworldwide assets the Court exorbitantly approves today.\n</pre>",
