UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12\u20131493. Argued January 22, 2014\u2014Decided June 16, 2014\nPetitioner Bruce Abramski offered to purchase a handgun for his uncle.\n  The form that federal regulations required Abramski to fill out (Form\n  4473) asked whether he was the \u201cactual transferee/buyer\u201d of the gun,\n  and clearly warned that a straw purchaser (namely, someone buying\n  a gun on behalf of another) was not the actual buyer. Abramski\n  falsely answered that he was the actual buyer. Abramski was con-\n  victed for knowingly making false statements \u201cwith respect to any\n  fact material to the lawfulness of the sale\u201d of a gun, 18 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7922(a)(6), and for making a false statement \u201cwith respect to the in-\n  formation required . . . to be kept\u201d in the gun dealer\u2019s records,\n  \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). The Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Abramski\u2019s misrepresentation is material under \u00a7922(a)(6).\n Pp. 7\u201322.\n       (a) Abramski contends that federal gun laws are entirely uncon-\n cerned with straw arrangements: So long as the person at the counter\n is eligible to own a gun, the sale to him is legal under the statute. To\n be sure, federal law regulates licensed dealer\u2019s transactions with\n \u201cpersons\u201d or \u201ctransferees\u201d without specifying whether that language\n refers to the straw buyer or the actual purchaser. But when read in\n light of the statute\u2019s context, structure, and purpose, it is clear this\n language refers to the true buyer rather than the straw. Federal gun\n law establishes an elaborate system of in-person identification and\n background checks to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of\n felons and other prohibited purchasers. \u00a7\u00a7922(c), 922(t). It also im-\n poses record-keeping requirements to assist law enforcement authori-\n ties in investigating serious crimes through the tracing of guns to\n their buyers. \u00a7922(b)(5), 923(g). These provisions would mean little\n2                    ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    if a would-be gun buyer could evade them all simply by enlisting the\n    aid of an intermediary to execute the paperwork on his behalf. The\n    statute\u2019s language is thus best read in context to refer to the actual\n    rather than nominal buyer. This conclusion is reinforced by this\n    Court\u2019s standard practice of focusing on practical realities rather\n    than legal formalities when identifying the parties to a transaction.\n    Pp. 7\u201319.\n          (b) Abramski argues more narrowly that his false response was\n    not material because his uncle could have legally bought a gun for\n    himself. But Abramski\u2019s false statement prevented the dealer from\n    insisting that the true buyer (Alvarez) appear in person, provide\n    identifying information, show a photo ID, and submit to a back-\n    ground check. \u00a7\u00a7922(b), (c), (t). Nothing in the statute suggests that\n    these legal duties may be wiped away merely because the actual buy-\n    er turns out to be legally eligible to own a gun. Because the dealer\n    could not have lawfully sold the gun had it known that Abramski was\n    not the true buyer, the misstatement was material to the lawfulness\n    of the sale. Pp. 19\u201322.\n       2. Abramski\u2019s misrepresentation about the identity of the actual\n    buyer concerned \u201cinformation required by [Chapter 44 of Title 18 of\n    the United States Code] to be kept\u201d in the dealer\u2019s records.\n    \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). Chapter 44 contains a provision requiring a dealer to\n    \u201cmaintain such records . . . as the Attorney General may . . . pre-\n    scribe.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(1)(A). The Attorney General requires every licensed\n    dealer to retain in its records a completed copy of Form 4473, see 27\n    CFR \u00a7478.124(b), and that form in turn includes the \u201cactual buyer\u201d\n    question that Abramski answered falsely. Therefore, falsely answer-\n    ing a question on Form 4473 violates \u00a7924(a)(1)(A).

To ensure the accuracy of those sub-\nmissions, a federal statute imposes criminal penalties on\nany person who, in connection with a firearm\u2019s acquisition,\nmakes false statements about \u201cany fact material to the\nlawfulness of the sale.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(a)(6). In this\ncase, we consider how that law applies to a so-called straw\npurchaser\u2014namely, a person who buys a gun on someone\nelse\u2019s behalf while falsely claiming that it is for himself.\nWe hold that such a misrepresentation is punishable\nunder the statute, whether or not the true buyer could\nhave purchased the gun without the straw.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Federal law has for over 40 years regulated sales by\nlicensed firearms dealers, principally to prevent guns from\nfalling into the wrong hands. See Gun Control Act of\n1968, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7921 et seq. Under \u00a7922(g), certain classes\n2                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nof people\u2014felons, drug addicts, and the mentally ill, to\nlist a few\u2014may not purchase or possess any firearm. And\nto ensure they do not, \u00a7922(d) forbids a licensed dealer\nfrom selling a gun to anyone it knows, or has reasonable\ncause to believe, is such a prohibited buyer. See Huddle-\nston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 825 (1974) (\u201c[T]he\nfocus of the federal scheme,\u201d in controlling access to weap-\nons, \u201cis the federally licensed firearms dealer\u201d).\n   The statute establishes a detailed scheme to enable the\ndealer to verify, at the point of sale, whether a potential\nbuyer may lawfully own a gun. Section 922(c) brings the\nwould-be purchaser onto the dealer\u2019s \u201cbusiness premises\u201d\nby prohibiting, except in limited circumstances, the sale of\na firearm \u201cto a person who does not appear in person\u201d at\nthat location. Other provisions then require the dealer to\ncheck and make use of certain identifying information\nreceived from the buyer. Before completing any sale, the\ndealer must \u201cverif[y] the identity of the transferee by\nexamining a valid identification document\u201d bearing a\nphotograph. \u00a7922(t)(1)(C). In addition, the dealer must\nprocure the buyer\u2019s \u201cname, age, and place of residence.\u201d\n\u00a7922(b)(5). And finally, the dealer must (with limited\nexceptions not at issue here1) submit that information\nto the National Instant Background Check System (NICS)\nto determine whether the potential purchaser is for\nany reason disqualified from owning a firearm. See\n\u00a7\u00a7922(t)(1)(A)\u2013(B).\n   The statute further insists that the dealer keep certain\nrecords, to enable federal authorities both to enforce the\nlaw\u2019s verification measures and to trace firearms used in\ncrimes. See H. R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 14\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        principal exception is for any buyer who has a state permit that\nhas been \u201cissued only after an authorized government official has\nverified\u201d the buyer\u2019s eligibility to own a gun under both federal and\nstate law. \u00a7922(t)(3).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(1968). A dealer must maintain the identifying infor-\nmation mentioned above (i.e., name, age, and residence) in\nits permanent files. See \u00a7922(b)(5). In addition, the dealer\nmust keep \u201csuch records of . . . sale[ ] or other disposi-\ntion of firearms . . . as the Attorney General may by regu-\nlations prescribe.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(1)(A). And the Attorney Gen-\neral (or his designee) may obtain and inspect any of those\nrecords, \u201cin the course of a bona fide criminal investiga-\ntion,\u201d to \u201cdetermin[e] the disposition of 1 or more fire-\narms.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(7).\n   To implement all those statutory requirements, the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n(ATF) developed Form 4473 for gun sales. See Supp. App.\n1\u20136. The part of that form to be completed by the buyer\nrequests his name, birth date, and address, as well as\ncertain other identifying information (for example, his\nheight, weight, and race). The form further lists all the\nfactors disqualifying a person from gun ownership, and\nasks the would-be buyer whether any of them apply (e.g.,\n\u201c[h]ave you ever been convicted . . . of a felony?\u201d). Id., at 1.\nMost important here, Question 11.a. asks (with bolded\nemphasis appearing on the form itself):\n    \u201cAre you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s)\n    listed on this form? Warning: You are not the ac-\n    tual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on\n    behalf of another person. If you are not the ac-\n    tual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the fire-\n    arm(s) to you.\u201d Ibid.\nThe accompanying instructions for that question provide:\n    \u201cQuestion 11.a. Actual Transferee/Buyer: For\n    purposes of this form, you are the actual transferee/\n    buyer if you are purchasing the firearm for yourself\n    or otherwise acquiring the firearm for yourself . . . .\n    You are also the actual transferee/buyer if you are le-\n    gitimately purchasing the firearm as a gift for a third\n4               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    party. ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER EXAM-\n    PLES: Mr. Smith asks Mr. Jones to purchase a fire-\n    arm for Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith gives Mr. Jones the\n    money for the firearm. Mr. Jones is NOT THE\n    ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER of the firearm\n    and must answer \u201cNO\u201d to question 11.a.\u201d Id., at 4.\nAfter responding to this and other questions, the customer\nmust sign a certification declaring his answers \u201ctrue,\ncorrect and complete.\u201d Id., at 2. That certification pro-\nvides that the signator \u201cunderstand[s] that making any\nfalse . . . statement\u201d respecting the transaction\u2014and,\nparticularly, \u201canswering \u2018yes\u2019 to question 11.a. if [he is] not\nthe actual buyer\u201d\u2014is a crime \u201cpunishable as a felony\nunder Federal law.\u201d Ibid. (bold typeface deleted).\n  Two statutory provisions, each designed to ensure that\nthe dealer can rely on the truthfulness of the buyer\u2019s dis-\nclosures in carrying out its obligations, criminalize certain\nfalse statements about firearms transactions. First and\nforemost, \u00a7922(a)(6), provides as follows:\n    \u201cIt shall be unlawful . . . for any person in connection\n    with the acquisition or attempted acquisition of any\n    firearm or ammunition from [a licensed dealer] know-\n    ingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written\n    statement . . . , intended or likely to deceive such\n    [dealer] with respect to any fact material to the law-\n    fulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm\n    or ammunition under the provisions of this chapter.\u201d\nThat provision helps make certain that a dealer will re-\nceive truthful information as to any matter relevant to a\ngun sale\u2019s legality. In addition, \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) prohibits\n\u201cknowingly mak[ing] any false statement or representa-\ntion with respect to the information required by this chap-\nter to be kept in the records\u201d of a federally licensed gun\ndealer. The question in this case is whether, as the ATF\ndeclares in Form 4473\u2019s certification, those statutory\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovisions criminalize a false answer to Question 11.a.\u2014\nthat is, a customer\u2019s statement that he is the \u201cactual\ntransferee/buyer,\u201d purchasing a firearm for himself, when\nin fact he is a straw purchaser, buying the gun on someone\nelse\u2019s behalf.\n                              B\n   The petitioner here is Bruce Abramski, a former police\nofficer who offered to buy a Glock 19 handgun for his\nuncle, Angel Alvarez. (Abramski thought he could get the\ngun for a discount by showing his old police identification,\nthough the Government contends that because he had\nbeen fired from his job two years earlier, he was no longer\nauthorized to use that card.) Accepting his nephew\u2019s offer,\nAlvarez sent Abramski a check for $400 with \u201cGlock 19\nhandgun\u201d written on the memo line. Two days later,\nAbramski went to Town Police Supply, a federally licensed\nfirearms dealer, to make the purchase. There, he filled\nout Form 4473, falsely checking \u201cYes\u201d in reply to Question\n11.a.\u2014that is, asserting he was the \u201cactual transferee/\nbuyer\u201d when, according to the form\u2019s clear definition, he\nwas not. He also signed the requisite certification, ac-\nknowledging his understanding that a false answer to\nQuestion 11.a. is a federal crime. After Abramski\u2019s name\ncleared the NICS background check, the dealer sold him\nthe Glock. Abramski then deposited the $400 check in his\nbank account, transferred the gun to Alvarez, and got back\na receipt. Federal agents found that receipt while execut-\ning a search warrant at Abramski\u2019s home after he became\na suspect in a different crime.\n   A grand jury indicted Abramski for violating \u00a7\u00a7922(a)(6)\nand 924(a)(1)(A) by falsely affirming in his response to\nQuestion 11.a. that he was the Glock\u2019s actual buyer.\nAbramski moved to dismiss both charges. He argued that\nhis misrepresentation on Question 11.a. was not \u201cmaterial\nto the lawfulness of the sale\u201d under \u00a7922(a)(6) because\n6                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nAlvarez was legally eligible to own a gun. And he claimed\nthat the false statement did not violate \u00a7924(a)(1)(A)\nbecause a buyer\u2019s response to Question 11.a. is not \u201cre-\nquired . . . to be kept in the records\u201d of a gun dealer. After\nthe District Court denied those motions, see 778 F. Supp.\n2d 678 (WD Va. 2011), Abramski entered a conditional\nguilty plea, reserving his right to challenge the rulings.\nThe District Court then sentenced him to five years of\nprobation on each count, running concurrently.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the\nconvictions. 706 F. 3d 307 (2013). It noted a division\namong appellate courts on the question Abramski raised\nabout \u00a7922(a)(6)\u2019s materiality requirement: Of three courts\nto have addressed the issue, one agreed with Abramski\nthat a misrepresentation on Question 11.a. is immaterial\nif \u201cthe true purchaser [here, Alvarez] can lawfully pur-\nchase a firearm directly.\u201d Id., at 315 (quoting United\nStates v. Polk, 118 F. 3d 286, 295 (CA5 1997)).2 The\nFourth Circuit, however, thought the majority position\ncorrect: \u201c[T]he identity of the actual purchaser of a firearm\nis a constant that is always material to the lawfulness of a\nfirearm acquisition under \u00a7922(a)(6).\u201d 706 F. 3d, at 316.\nThe court also held that Abramski\u2019s conviction under\n\u00a7924(a)(1)(A) was valid, finding that the statute required a\ndealer to maintain the information at issue in its records.\nId., at 317.\n   We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), principally\nto resolve the Circuit split about \u00a7922(a)(6). In this Court,\nAbramski renews his claim that a false answer to Ques-\ntion 11.a. is immaterial if the true buyer is legally eligible\nto purchase a firearm. But Abramski now focuses on a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Compare Polk, 118 F. 3d, at 294\u2013295, with United States v. Morales,\n\n687 F. 3d 697, 700\u2013701 (CA6 2012) (a misrepresentation about the true\npurchaser\u2019s identity is material even when he can legally own a gun);\nUnited States v. Frazier, 605 F. 3d 1271, 1279\u20131280 (CA11 2010)\n(same).\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                 7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nnew and more ambitious argument, which he concedes no\ncourt has previously accepted. See Brief for Petitioner i.3\nIn brief, he alleges that a false response to Question 11.a.\nis never material to a gun sale\u2019s legality, whether or not\nthe actual buyer is eligible to own a gun. We begin with\nthat fundamental question, next turn to what has become\nAbramski\u2019s back-up argument under \u00a7922(a)(6), and fi-\nnally consider the relatively easy question pertaining to\n\u00a7924(A)(1)(a)\u2019s separate false-statement prohibition. On\neach score, we affirm Abramski\u2019s conviction.\n                             II\n  Abramski\u2019s broad theory (mostly echoed by the dissent)\nis that federal gun law simply does not care about ar-\nrangements involving straw purchasers: So long as the\nperson at the counter is eligible to own a gun, the sale to\nhim is legal under the statute. That is true, Abramski\ncontends, irrespective of any agreement that person has\nmade to purchase the firearm on behalf of someone else\u2014\nincluding someone who cannot lawfully buy or own a gun\nhimself.    Accordingly, Abramski concludes, his \u201cfalse\nstatement that he was the [Glock 19\u2019s] \u2018actual buyer,\u2019 \u201d as\nthat term was \u201cdefined in Question 11.a., was not material\u201d\n\u2014indeed, was utterly irrelevant\u2014\u201cto the lawfulness of\nthe sale.\u201d Id., at 31 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 4\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.). In essence, he claims, Town Police\nSupply could legally have sold the gun to him even if had\ntruthfully answered Question 11.a. by disclosing that he\nwas a straw\u2014because, again, all the federal firearms law\ncares about is whether the individual standing at the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Reflecting that prior consensus, neither of Abramski\u2019s principal\n\namici\u2014the National Rifle Association and a group of 26 States\u2014joins\nAbramski in making this broader argument. They confine themselves\nto supporting the more limited claim about straw purchases made on\nbehalf of eligible gun owners, addressed infra, at 19\u201322.\n8                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndealer\u2019s counter meets the requirements to buy a gun.4\n   At its core, that argument relies on one true fact: Fed-\neral gun law regulates licensed dealers\u2019 transactions with\n\u201cpersons\u201d or \u201ctransferees,\u201d without specifically referencing\nstraw purchasers. Section 922(d), for example, bars a\ndealer from \u201csell[ing] or otherwise dispos[ing] of \u201d a fire-\narm to any \u201cperson\u201d who falls within a prohibited category\u2014\nfelons, drug addicts, the mentally ill, and so forth. See\nsupra, at 1\u20132; see also \u00a7922(b)(5) (before selling a gun to a\n\u201cperson,\u201d the dealer must take down his name, age, and\nresidence); \u00a7922(t)(1) (before selling a gun to a \u201cperson,\u201d\nthe dealer must run a background check). Similarly,\n\u00a7922(t)(1)(C) requires the dealer to verify the identity of\nthe \u201ctransferee\u201d by checking a valid photo ID. See supra,\nat 2; see also \u00a7922(c) (spelling out circumstances in which\na \u201ctransferee\u201d may buy a gun without appearing at the\ndealer\u2019s premises). Abramski contends that Congress\u2019s\nuse of such language alone, sans any mention of \u201cstraw\npurchasers\u201d or \u201cactual buyers,\u201d shows that \u201c[i]t is not\nillegal to buy a gun for someone else.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n15\u201316; Reply Brief 1; see also post, at 2\u20136.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The dissent reserves the question whether the false statement\n\nwould be material if the straw purchaser knew that the true buyer was\nnot eligible to own a firearm. Post, at 6, n. 2. But first, that reserva-\ntion is of quite limited scope: Unlike Abramski\u2019s back-up argument,\nwhich imposes liability whenever the true purchaser cannot legally buy\na gun, the dissent\u2019s reservation applies only when the straw has\nknowledge of (or at least reasonable cause to believe) that fact. And as\nwe will later note, straws often do not have such knowledge. See infra,\nat 12\u201313. Second, the reservation (fairly enough for a reservation) rests\non an uncertain legal theory. According to the dissent, a straw buyer\nmight violate \u00a7922(a)(6) if a dealer\u2019s sale to him aids and abets his\nviolation of \u00a7922(d)\u2014a provision barring knowingly transferring a gun\nto an ineligible person, see infra, at 8, 17\u201318. But that reasoning\npresupposes that a firearms dealer acting in the ordinary course of\nbusiness can ever have the intent needed to aid and abet a crime\u2014a\nquestion this Court reserved not six months ago. See Rosemond v.\nUnited States, 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12, n. 8).\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  But that language merely raises, rather than answers,\nthe critical question: In a straw purchase, who is the\n\u201cperson\u201d or \u201ctransferee\u201d whom federal gun law addresses?\nIs that \u201cperson\u201d the middleman buying a firearm on some-\none else\u2019s behalf (often because the ultimate recipient\ncould not buy it himself, or wants to camouflage the trans-\naction)? Or is that \u201cperson\u201d instead the individual really\npaying for the gun and meant to take possession of it upon\ncompletion of the purchase? Is it the conduit at the coun-\nter, or the gun\u2019s intended owner?5 In answering that in-\nquiry, we must (as usual) interpret the relevant words not\nin a vacuum, but with reference to the statutory context,\n\u201cstructure, history, and purpose.\u201d Maracich v. Spears, 570\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 26). All those tools of\ndivining meaning\u2014not to mention common sense, which is\na fortunate (though not inevitable) side-benefit of constru-\ning statutory terms fairly\u2014demonstrate that \u00a7922, in\nregulating licensed dealers\u2019 gun sales, looks through the\nstraw to the actual buyer.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The dissent claims the answer is easy because \u201cif I give my son $10\n\nand tell him to pick up milk and eggs at the store, no English speaker\nwould say that the store \u2018sells\u2019 the milk and eggs to me.\u201d Post, at 4.\nBut try a question more similar to the one the gun law\u2019s text raises: If I\nsend my brother to the Apple Store with money and instructions to\npurchase an iPhone, and then take immediate and sole possession of\nthat device, am I the \u201cperson\u201d (or \u201ctransferee\u201d) who has bought the\nphone or is he? Nothing in ordinary English usage compels an answer\neither way.\n  6 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s view, our analysis does not rest on mere\n\n\u201cpurpose-based arguments.\u201d Post. at 7. We simply recognize that a\ncourt should not interpret each word in a statute with blinders on,\nrefusing to look at the word\u2019s function within the broader statutory\ncontext. As we have previously put the point, a \u201cprovision that may\nseem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the\nstatutory scheme . . . because only one of the permissible meanings\nproduces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the\nlaw.\u201d United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,\nLtd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988).\n10                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The overarching reason is that Abramski\u2019s reading\nwould undermine\u2014indeed, for all important purposes,\nwould virtually repeal\u2014the gun law\u2019s core provisions.7 As\nnoted earlier, the statute establishes an elaborate system\nto verify a would-be gun purchaser\u2019s identity and check on\nhis background. See supra, at 2. It also requires that the\ninformation so gathered go into a dealer\u2019s permanent\nrecords. See supra, at 2\u20133. The twin goals of this com-\nprehensive scheme are to keep guns out of the hands of\ncriminals and others who should not have them, and to\nassist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious\ncrimes. See Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 824; supra, at 2\u20133.\nAnd no part of that scheme would work if the statute\nturned a blind eye to straw purchases\u2014if, in other words,\nthe law addressed not the substance of a transaction, but\nonly empty formalities.\n  To see why, consider what happens in a typical straw\npurchase. A felon or other person who cannot buy or own\na gun still wants to obtain one. (Or, alternatively, a per-\nson who could legally buy a firearm wants to conceal his\npurchase, maybe so he can use the gun for criminal pur-\nposes without fear that police officers will later trace it to\nhim.) Accordingly, the prospective buyer enlists an inter-\nmediary to help him accomplish his illegal aim. Perhaps\nhe conscripts a loyal friend or family member; perhaps\nmore often, he hires a stranger to purchase the gun for a\nprice. The actual purchaser might even accompany the\nstraw to the gun shop, instruct him which firearm to buy,\ngive him the money to pay at the counter, and take pos-\nsession as they walk out the door. See, e.g., United States\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 That reading would also, at a stroke, declare unlawful a large part\n\nof what the ATF does to combat gun trafficking by criminals. See Dept.\nof Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, Following the\nGun: Enforcing Federal Laws Against Firearms Traffickers, p. xi (June\n2000) (noting that in several prior years \u201c[a]lmost half of all [ATF\nfirearm] trafficking investigations involved straw purchasers\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Bowen, 207 Fed. Appx. 727, 729 (CA7 2006) (describing\na straw purchase along those lines); United States v. Paye,\n129 Fed. Appx. 567, 570 (CA11 2005) (per curiam) (same).\nWhat the true buyer would not do\u2014what he would leave\nto the straw, who possesses the gun for all of a minute\u2014is\ngive his identifying information to the dealer and submit\nhimself to a background check. How many of the statute\u2019s\nprovisions does that scenario\u2014the lawful result of\nAbramski\u2019s (and the dissent\u2019s) reading of \u201ctransferee\u201d and\n\u201cperson\u201d\u2014render meaningless?\n   Start with the parts of \u00a7922 enabling a dealer to verify\nwhether a buyer is legally eligible to own a firearm. That\ntask, as noted earlier, begins with identification\u2014\nrequesting the name, address, and age of the potential\npurchaser and checking his photo ID. See \u00a7\u00a7922(b)(5),\n(t)(1)(C); supra, at 2. And that identification in turn per-\nmits a background check: The dealer runs the purchaser\u2019s\nname through the NICS database to discover whether he\nis, for example, a felon, drug addict, or mentally ill person.\nSee \u00a7\u00a7922(d), (t)(1); supra, at 2. All those provisions are\ndesigned to accomplish what this Court has previously\ntermed Congress\u2019s \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d in enacting the\nstatute\u2014\u201cto curb crime by keeping \u2018firearms out of the\nhands of those not legally entitled to possess them.\u2019 \u201d\nHuddleston, 415 U. S., at 824 (quoting S. Rep. No. 1501,\n90th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1968)). But under Abramski\u2019s\nreading, the statutory terms would be utterly ineffectual,\nbecause the identification and background check would be\nof the wrong person. The provisions would evaluate the\neligibility of mere conduits, while allowing every criminal\n(and drug addict and so forth) to escape that assessment\nand walk away with a weapon.\n   Similarly, Abramski\u2019s view would defeat the point of\n\u00a7922(c), which tightly restricts the sale of guns \u201cto a per-\nson who does not appear in person at the licensee\u2019s busi-\nness premises.\u201d See supra, at 2. Only a narrow class of\n12              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprospective buyers may ever purchase a gun from afar\u2014\nprimarily, individuals who have already had their eligibil-\nity to own a firearm verified by state law enforcement\nofficials with access to the NICS database. See 27 CFR\n\u00a7478.96(b) (2014), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(t)(3); n. 1, supra. And\neven when an individual fits within that category, he still\nmust submit to the dealer a sworn statement that he can\nlawfully own a gun, as well as provide the name and ad-\ndress of the principal law enforcement officer in his com-\nmunity. See \u00a7922(c)(1). The dealer then has to forward\nnotice of the sale to that officer, in order to allow law\nenforcement authorities to investigate the legality of the\nsale and, if necessary, call a stop to it. See \u00a7\u00a7922(c)(2)\u2013(3).\nThe provision thus prevents remote sales except to a small\nclass of buyers subject to extraordinary procedures\u2014\nagain, to ensure effective verification of a potential pur-\nchaser\u2019s eligibility. Yet on Abramski\u2019s view, a person\ncould easily bypass the scheme, purchasing a gun without\never leaving his home by dispatching to a gun store a\nhired deliveryman. Indeed, if Abramski were right, we see\nno reason why anyone (and certainly anyone with less-\nthan-pure motives) would put himself through the proce-\ndures laid out in \u00a7922(c): Deliverymen, after all, are not so\nhard to come by.\n   And likewise, the statute\u2019s record-keeping provisions\nwould serve little purpose if the records kept were of\nnominal rather than real buyers. As noted earlier, dealers\nmust store, and law enforcement officers may obtain,\ninformation about a gun buyer\u2019s identity. See \u00a7\u00a7922(b)(5),\n923(g); supra, at 3. That information helps to fight serious\ncrime. When police officers retrieve a gun at a crime\nscene, they can trace it to the buyer and consider him as a\nsuspect. See National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc. v.\nJones, 716 F. 3d 200, 204 (CADC 2013) (describing law\nenforcement\u2019s use of firearm tracing). Too, the required\nrecords enable dealers to identify certain suspicious pur-\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nchasing trends, which they then must report to federal\nauthorities. See \u00a7923(g)(3) (imposing a reporting obliga-\ntion when a person buys multiple handguns within five\ndays). But once again, those provisions can serve their\nobjective only if the records point to the person who took\nactual control of the gun(s). Otherwise, the police will at\nmost learn the identity of an intermediary, who could not\nhave been responsible for the gun\u2019s use and might know\nnext to nothing about the actual buyer. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Juarez, 626 F. 3d 246, 249 (CA5 2010) (straw\npurchaser bought military-style assault rifles, later found\namong Mexican gang members, for a buyer known \u201conly as\n\u2018El Mano\u2019 \u201d). Abramski\u2019s view would thus render the re-\nquired records close to useless for aiding law enforcement:\nPutting true numbskulls to one side, anyone purchasing a\ngun for criminal purposes would avoid leaving a paper\ntrail by the simple expedient of hiring a straw.\n   To sum up so far: All the prerequisites for buying a gun\ndescribed above refer to a \u201cperson\u201d or \u201ctransferee.\u201d Read\nAbramski\u2019s way (\u201cthe man at the counter\u201d), those terms\ndeny effect to the regulatory scheme, as criminals could\nalways use straw purchasers to evade the law.8 Read the\nother way (\u201cthe man getting, and always meant to get, the\nfirearm\u201d), those terms give effect to the statutory provi-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent is mistaken when it says that the ATF\u2019s own former\n\nview of the statute refutes this proposition. See post, at 11\u201312. As we\nwill later discuss, see infra, at 21\u201322, the ATF for a time thought that\n\u00a7922(a)(6) did not cover cases in which the true purchaser could have\nlegally purchased a gun himself. But Abramski\u2019s principal argument\nextends much further, to cases in which straws buy weapons for crimi-\nnals, drug addicts, and other prohibited purchasers. For the reasons\njust stated, that interpretation would render the statute all but useless.\nAnd although the dissent appeals to a snippet of congressional testi-\nmony to suggest that ATF once briefly held that extreme view of the\nstatute, it agrees that by at least 1979 (well over three decades ago),\nATF recognized the unlawfulness of straw purchases on behalf of\nprohibited persons.\n14              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions, allowing them to accomplish their manifest objects.\nThat alone provides more than sufficient reason to under-\nstand \u201cperson\u201d and \u201ctransferee\u201d as referring not to the\nfictitious but to the real buyer.\n   And other language in \u00a7922 confirms that construction,\nby evincing Congress\u2019s concern with the practical realities,\nrather than the legal niceties, of firearms transactions.\nFor example, \u00a7922(a)(6) itself bars material misrepresen-\ntations \u201cin connection with the acquisition,\u201d and not just\nthe purchase, of a firearm. That broader word, we have\npreviously held, does not focus on \u201clegal title\u201d\u2014let alone\nlegal title for a few short moments, until another, always\nintended transfer occurs. Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 820.\nInstead, the term signifies \u201ccom[ing] into possession,\ncontrol, or power of disposal,\u201d as the actual buyer in a\nstraw purchase does. Ibid. Similarly, we have reasoned\nthat such a substance-over-form approach draws support\nfrom the statute\u2019s repeated references to \u201cthe sale or other\ndisposition\u201d of a firearm. \u00a7922(a)(6); see \u00a7922(d) (making\nit unlawful to \u201csell or otherwise dispose of \u201d a gun to a\nprohibited person). That term, we have stated, \u201cwas\naimed at providing maximum coverage.\u201d Id., at 826\u2013827.\nWe think such expansive language inconsistent with\nAbramski\u2019s view of the statute, which would stare myopi-\ncally at the nominal buyer while remaining blind to the\nperson exiting the transaction with control of the gun.\n   Finally, our reading of \u00a7922 comports with courts\u2019\nstandard practice, evident in many legal spheres and\npresumably known to Congress, of ignoring artifice when\nidentifying the parties to a transaction. In United States\nv. One 1936 Model Ford V-8 Deluxe Coach, Commercial\nCredit Co., 307 U. S. 219 (1939), for example, we consid-\nered the operation of a statute requiring forfeiture of any\ninterest in property that was used to violate prohibition\nlaws, except if acquired in good faith. There, a straw\npurchaser had bought a car in his name but with his\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbrother\u2019s money, and transferred it to the brother\u2014a\nknown bootlegger\u2014right after driving it off the lot. See\nid., at 222\u2013223. The Court held the finance company\u2019s lien\non the car non-forfeitable because the company had no\nhint that the straw was a straw\u2014that his brother would\nin fact be the owner. See id., at 224. But had the com-\npany known, the Court made clear, a different result would\nhave obtained: The company could not have relied on the\nformalities of the sale to the \u201c \u2018straw\u2019 purchaser\u201d when it\nknew that the \u201creal owner and purchaser\u201d of the car was\nsomeone different. Id., at 223\u2013224. We have similarly\nemphasized the need in other contexts, involving both\ncriminal and civil penalties, to look through a transac-\ntion\u2019s nominal parties to its true participants. See, e.g.,\nAmerican Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 560\nU. S. 183, 193 (2010) (focusing on \u201csubstance rather than\nform\u201d in assessing when entities are distinct enough to be\ncapable of conspiring to violate the antitrust laws); Gregory\nv. Helvering, 293 U. S. 465, 470 (1935) (disregarding an\nintermediary shell corporation created to avoid taxes\nbecause doing otherwise would \u201cexalt artifice above reality\u201d).\nWe do no more than that here in holding, consistent\nwith \u00a7922\u2019s text, structure, and purpose, that using a\nstraw does not enable evasion of the firearms law.\n   Abramski, along with the dissent, objects that such\naction is no circumvention\u2014that Congress made an inten-\ntional choice, born of \u201cpolitical compromise,\u201d to limit the\ngun law\u2019s compass to the person at the counter, even if\nmerely acting on another\u2019s behalf. Reply Brief 11; post, at\n10\u201311. As evidence, Abramski states that the statute does\nnot regulate beyond the initial point of sale. Because the\nlaw mostly addresses sales made by licensed dealers, a\npurchaser can (within wide limits) subsequently decide to\nresell his gun to another private party. See Reply Brief\n11. And similarly, Abramski says, a purchaser can buy a\ngun for someone else as a gift. See Brief for Petitioner 26\u2013\n16                ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n27, n. 3. Abramski lumps in the same category the trans-\nfer of a gun from a nominal to a real buyer\u2014as something,\nlike a later resale or gift, meant to fall outside the stat-\nute\u2019s     (purported)    standing-in-front-of-the-gun-dealer\nscope. See Reply Brief 13; see also post, at 7\u20139.\n   But Abramski and the dissent draw the wrong conclu-\nsion from their observations about resales and gifts. Yes,\nCongress decided to regulate dealers\u2019 sales, while leaving\nthe secondary market for guns largely untouched. As we\nnoted in Huddleston, Congress chose to make the dealer\nthe \u201cprincipal agent of federal enforcement\u201d in \u201crestricting\n[criminals\u2019] access to firearms.\u201d 415 U. S., at 824. And\nyes, that choice (like pretty much everything Congress\ndoes) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw\narrangements are not a part of the secondary market,\nseparate and apart from the dealer\u2019s sale. In claiming as\nmuch, Abramski merely repeats his mistaken assumption\nthat the \u201cperson\u201d who acquires a gun from a dealer in a\ncase like this one is the straw, rather than the individual\nwho has made a prior arrangement to pay for, take pos-\nsession of, own, and use that part of the dealer\u2019s stock.\nFor all the reasons we have already given, that is not a\nplausible construction of a statute mandating that the\ndealer identify and run a background check on the person\nto whom it is (really, not fictitiously) selling a gun. See\nsupra, at 9\u201315. The individual who sends a straw to a gun\nstore to buy a firearm is transacting with the dealer, in\nevery way but the most formal; and that distinguishes\nsuch a person from one who buys a gun, or receives a gun\nas a gift, from a private party.9 The line Congress drew\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The dissent responds: \u201cThat certainly distinguishes\u201d the individual\n\ntransacting with a dealer through a straw from an individual receiving\na gun from a private party; \u201cso would the fact that [the former] has\norange hair.\u201d Post, at 9. But that is an example of wit gone wrong.\nWhether the purchaser has orange hair, we can all agree, is immaterial\nto the statutory scheme. By contrast, whether the purchaser has\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween those who acquire guns from dealers and those\nwho get them as gifts or on the secondary market, we\nsuspect, reflects a host of things, including administrative\nsimplicity and a view about where the most problematic\nfirearm transactions\u2014like criminal organizations\u2019 bulk\ngun purchases\u2014typically occur. But whatever the reason,\nthe scarcity of controls in the secondary market provides\nno reason to gut the robust measures Congress enacted at\nthe point of sale.\n   Abramski claims further support for his argument from\nCongress\u2019s decision in 1986 to amend \u00a7922(d) to prohibit a\nprivate party (and not just, as originally enacted, a li-\ncensed dealer) from selling a gun to someone he knows or\nreasonably should know cannot legally possess one. See\nFirearm Owners\u2019 Protection Act, \u00a7102(5)(A), 100 Stat.\n451\u2013452. According to Abramski, the revised \u00a7922(d)\nshould be understood as Congress\u2019s exclusive response to\nthe potential dangers arising from straw purchases. See\nBrief for Petitioner 26\u201327. The amendment shows, he\nclaims, that \u201cCongress chose to address this perceived\nproblem in a way other than\u201d by imposing liability under\n\u00a7922(a)(6) on a straw who tells a licensed dealer that he is\nthe firearm\u2019s actual buyer. Reply Brief 14, n. 2.\n   But Congress\u2019s amendment of \u00a7922(d) says nothing\nabout \u00a7922(a)(6)\u2019s application to straw purchasers. In en-\nacting that amendment, Congress left \u00a7922(a)(6) just as\nit was, undercutting any suggestion that Congress some-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntransacted with a licensed dealer is integral to the statute\u2014because, as\npreviously noted, \u201cthe federal scheme . . . controls access to weapons\u201d\nthrough the federally licensed firearms dealer, who is \u201cthe principal\nagent of federal enforcement.\u201d Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S.\n814, 824, 825 (1974); see supra, at 16. In so designing the statute,\nCongress chose not to pursue the goal of \u201ccontroll[ing] access\u201d to guns to\nthe nth degree; buyers can, as the dissent says, avoid the statute\u2019s\nbackground check and record-keeping requirements by getting a gun\nsecond-hand. But that possibility provides no justification for limiting\nthe statute\u2019s considered regulation of dealer sales.\n18                ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhow intended to contract that provision\u2019s reach. The\namendment instead performed a different function: Rather\nthan ensuring that a licensed dealer receives truthful\ninformation, it extended a minimal form of regulation to\nthe secondary market. The revised \u00a7922(d) prevents a\nprivate person from knowingly selling a gun to an ineligi-\nble owner no matter when or how he acquired the weapon:\nIt thus applies not just to a straw purchaser, but to an\nindividual who bought a gun for himself and later decided\nto resell it. At the same time, \u00a7922(d) has nothing to say\nabout a raft of cases \u00a7922(a)(6) covers, including all the\n(many) straw purchases in which the frontman does not\nknow that the actual buyer is ineligible. See supra, at 13.\nThus, \u00a7922(d) could not serve as an effective substitute for\n\u00a7922(a)(6). And the mere potential for some transactions\nto run afoul of both prohibitions gives no cause to read\n\u00a7922(d) as limiting \u00a7922(a)(6) (or vice versa). See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 118\u2013126\n(1979).10\n  Abramski\u2019s principal attack on his \u00a7922(a)(6) conviction\ntherefore fails. Contrary to his contention, the infor-\nmation Question 11.a. requests\u2014\u201c[a]re you the actual\ntransferee/buyer[?]\u201d or, put conversely, \u201care [you] acquir-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Nor do we agree with the dissent\u2019s argument (not urged by\n\nAbramski himself) that the rule of lenity defeats our construction. See\npost, at 12\u201314. That rule, as we have repeatedly emphasized, applies\nonly if, \u201cafter considering text, structure, history and purpose, there\nremains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that\nthe Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d Maracich\nv. Spears, 570 U. S ___, ___ (2013) (slip op. at 26) (quoting Barber v.\nThomas, 560 U.S. 474, 488 (2010)). We are not in that position here:\nAlthough the text creates some ambiguity, the context, structure,\nhistory, and purpose resolve it. The dissent would apply the rule of\nlenity here because the statute\u2019s text, taken alone, permits a narrower\nconstruction, but we have repeatedly emphasized that is not the appro-\npriate test. See, e.g., Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 138\n(1998); Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993).\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning the firearm(s) on behalf of another person[?]\u201d\u2014is\nrelevant to the lawfulness of a gun sale. That is because,\nfor all the reasons we have given, the firearms law con-\ntemplates that the dealer will check not the fictitious\npurchaser\u2019s but instead the true purchaser\u2019s identity and\neligibility for gun ownership. By concealing that Alvarez\nwas the actual buyer, Abramski prevented the dealer from\ntransacting with Alvarez face-to-face, see \u00a7922(c), record-\ning his name, age, and residence, see \u00a7922(b)(5), inspect-\ning his photo ID, see \u00a7922(t)(1)(C), submitting his identify-\ning information to the background check system, see\n\u00a7922(t)(1)(B), and determining whether he was prohibited\nfrom receiving a firearm, see \u00a7922(d). In sum, Abramski\nthwarted application of essentially all of the firearms law\u2019s\nrequirements. We can hardly think of a misrepresentation\nany more material to a sale\u2019s legality.\n                              III\n  Abramski also challenges his \u00a7922(a)(6) conviction on a\nnarrower ground. For purposes of this argument, he\nassumes that the Government can make its case when a\nstraw hides the name of an underlying purchaser who is\nlegally ineligible to own a gun. But, Abramski reminds us,\nthat is not true here, because Alvarez could have bought a\ngun for himself. In such circumstances, Abramski claims\nthat a false response to Question 11.a. is not material. See\nBrief for Petitioner 28\u201330. Essentially, Abramski con-\ntends, when the hidden purchaser is eligible anyway to\nown a gun, all\u2019s well that ends well, and all should be\nforgiven.\n  But we think what we have already said shows the\nfallacy of that claim: Abramski\u2019s false statement was\nmaterial because had he revealed that he was purchasing\nthe gun on Alvarez\u2019s behalf, the sale could not have pro-\nceeded under the law\u2014even though Alvarez turned out to\nbe an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter,\n20              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould not have complied with \u00a7922(c)\u2019s restrictions on\nabsentee purchases. See supra, at 11\u201312. If the dealer\nhere, Town Police Supply, had realized it was in fact\nselling a gun to Alvarez, it would have had to stop the\ntransaction for failure to comply with those conditions.\nYet more, the sale could not have gone forward because\nthe dealer would have lacked the information needed to\nverify and record Alvarez\u2019s identity and check his back-\nground. See \u00a7\u00a7922(b)(5), (t)(1)(B)\u2013(C); supra, at 10\u201312.\nThose requirements, as we have explained, pertain to the\nreal buyer; and the after-the-fact discovery that Alvarez\nwould have passed the background check cannot somehow\nwipe them away. Accordingly, had Town Police Supply\nknown Abramski was a straw, it could not have certified,\nas Form 4473 demands, its belief that the transfer was\n\u201cnot unlawful.\u201d Supp. App. 3.\n  An analogy may help show the weakness of Abramski\u2019s\nargument. Suppose a would-be purchaser, Smith, lawfully\ncould own a gun. But further suppose that, for reasons of\nhis own, Smith uses an alias (let\u2019s say Jones) to make the\npurchase. Would anyone say \u201cno harm, no foul,\u201d just\nbecause Smith is not in fact a prohibited person under\n\u00a7922(d)? We think not. Smith would in any event have\nmade a false statement about who will own the gun, im-\npeding the dealer\u2019s ability to carry out its legal responsi-\nbilities. So too here.\n  Abramski objects that because Alvarez could own a gun,\nthe statute\u2019s core purpose\u2014\u201ckeeping guns out of the\nhands\u201d of criminals and other prohibited persons\u2014\u201cis not\neven implicated.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 29. But that argu-\nment (which would apply no less to the alias scenario)\nmisunderstands the way the statute works. As earlier\nnoted, the federal gun law makes the dealer \u201c[t]he princi-\npal agent of federal enforcement.\u201d Huddleston, 415 U. S.,\nat 824, see supra, at 16. It is that highly regulated, legally\nknowledgeable entity, possessing access to the expansive\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNICS database, which has the responsibility to \u201c[e]nsure\nthat, in the course of sales or other dispositions . . . ,\nweapons [are not] obtained by individuals whose posses-\nsion of them would be contrary to the public interest.\u201d 415\nU. S., at 825. Nothing could be less consonant with the\nstatutory scheme than placing that inquiry in the hands of\nan unlicensed straw purchaser, who is unlikely to be\nfamiliar with federal firearms law and has no ability to\nuse the database to check whether the true buyer may\nown a gun. And in any event, keeping firearms out of the\nhands of criminals is not \u00a7922\u2019s only goal: The statute\u2019s\nrecord-keeping provisions, as we have said, are also de-\nsigned to aid law enforcement in the investigation of\ncrime. See supra, at 2\u20133, 12\u201313. Abramski\u2019s proposed\nlimitation on \u00a7922(a)(6) would undercut that purpose\nbecause many would-be criminals remain legally eligible\nto buy firearms, and thus could use straws to purchase an\nendless stream of guns off-the-books. See, e.g., Polk, 118\nF. 3d, at 289 (eligible gun buyer used straw purchasers to\nsecretly accumulate an \u201carsenal of weapons\u201d for a \u201cmas-\nsive offensive\u201d against the Federal Government).\n   In addition, Abramski briefly notes that until 1995, the\nATF took the view that a straw purchaser\u2019s misrepresen-\ntation counted as material only if the true buyer could not\nlegally possess a gun. See Brief for Petitioner 7\u20138; n. 8,\nsupra. We may put aside that ATF has for almost two\ndecades now taken the opposite position, after reflecting\non both appellate case law and changes in the statute. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 41; Brady Handgun Violence Prevention\nAct of 1993, \u00a7103, 107 Stat. 1541 (codified at 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7922(t)). The critical point is that criminal laws are for\ncourts, not for the Government, to construe. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Apel, 571 U. S. ___, (2014) (slip op., at 9)\n(\u201c[W]e have never held that the Government\u2019s reading of a\ncriminal statute is entitled to any deference\u201d). We think\nATF\u2019s old position no more relevant than its current one\u2014\n22              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich is to say, not relevant at all. Whether the Govern-\nment interprets a criminal statute too broadly (as it some-\ntimes does) or too narrowly (as the ATF used to in constru-\ning \u00a7922(a)(6)), a court has an obligation to correct its\nerror. Here, nothing suggests that Congress\u2014the entity\nwhose voice does matter\u2014limited its prohibition of a\nstraw purchaser\u2019s misrepresentation in the way Abramski\nproposes.\n                              IV\n  Finally, Abramski challenges his conviction under\n\u00a7924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits \u201cknowingly mak[ing] any\nfalse statement . . . with respect to the information re-\nquired by this chapter to be kept in the records\u201d of a feder-\nally licensed dealer. That provision is broader than\n\u00a7922(a)(6) in one respect: It does not require that the false\nstatement at issue be \u201cmaterial\u201d in any way. At the same\ntime, \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) includes an element absent from\n\u00a7922(a)(6): The false statement must relate to \u201cinfor-\nmation required by this chapter to be kept in [a dealer\u2019s]\nrecords.\u201d Abramski notes that the indictment in this case\ncharged him with only one misrepresentation: his state-\nment in response to Question 11.a. that he was buying the\nGlock on his own behalf rather than on someone else\u2019s.\nAnd, he argues, that information (unlike the transferee\u2019s\n\u201cname, age, and place of residence,\u201d which he plausibly\nreads the indictment as not mentioning) was not required\n\u201cby this chapter\u201d\u2014but only by Form 4473 itself\u2014to be kept\nin the dealer\u2019s permanent records. Brief for Petitioner 32.\n  We disagree. Included in \u201cthis chapter\u201d\u2014Chapter 44 of\nTitle 18\u2014is a provision, noted earlier, requiring a dealer\nto \u201cmaintain such records of . . . sale, or other disposition\nof firearms at his place of business for such period, and in\nsuch form, as the Attorney General may by regulations\nprescribe.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(1)(A); supra, at 3. Because of that\nstatutory section, the information that the Attorney Gen-\neral\u2019s regulations compel a dealer to keep is information\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201crequired by this chapter.\u201d And those regulations (the\nvalidity of which Abramski does not here contest) demand\nthat every licensed dealer \u201cretain . . . as a part of [its]\nrequired records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course\nof \u201d selling or otherwise disposing of a firearm. 27 CFR\n\u00a7478.124(b). Accordingly, a false answer on that form,\nsuch as the one Abramski made, pertains to information a\ndealer is statutorily required to maintain.11\n                              V\n   No piece of information is more important under federal\nfirearms law than the identity of a gun\u2019s purchaser\u2014the\nperson who acquires a gun as a result of a transaction\nwith a licensed dealer. Had Abramski admitted that he\nwas not that purchaser, but merely a straw\u2014that he was\nasking the dealer to verify the identity of, and run a back-\nground check on, the wrong individual\u2014the sale here\ncould not have gone forward. That makes Abramski\u2019s\nmisrepresentation on Question 11.a. material under\n\u00a7922(a)(6). And because that statement pertained to\ninformation that a dealer must keep in its permanent\nrecords under the firearms law, Abramski\u2019s answer to\nQuestion 11.a. also violated \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, we\naffirm the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The dissent argues that our view would impose criminal liability for\n\na false answer even to an \u201cultra vires question,\u201d such as \u201cthe buyer\u2019s\nfavorite color.\u201d Post, at 15. We need not, and do not, opine on that\nhypothetical, because it is miles away from this case. As we have\nexplained, see supra at 9\u201319, Question 11.a. is not ultra vires, but\ninstead fundamental to the lawfulness of a gun sale. It is, indeed, part\nand parcel of the dealer\u2019s determination of the (true) buyer\u2019s \u201cname,\nage, and place of residence,\u201d which \u00a7922(b)(5) requires the dealer to\nkeep. That section alone would justify Abramski\u2019s conviction under\n\u00a7924(a)(1)(A) if the indictment here had clearly alleged that, in addition\nto answering Question 11.a. falsely, he lied about that buyer\u2019s \u201cname,\nage, and place of residence.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Both men were legally eligible to receive\nand possess firearms, and Abramski transferred the gun\nto his uncle at a federally licensed gun dealership in com-\npliance with state law. When buying the gun, Abramski\nhad to fill out Form 4473 issued by the Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). In response to a\nquestion on the form, Abramski affirmed that he was the\n\u201cactual/transferee buyer\u201d of the gun, even though the form\nstated that he was not the \u201cactual transferee/buyer\u201d if he\nwas purchasing the gun for a third party at that person\u2019s\nrequest and with funds provided by that person.\n  The Government charged Abramski with two federal\ncrimes under the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7921\u2013931: making a false statement \u201cmaterial to\nthe lawfulness of the sale,\u201d in violation of \u00a7922(a)(6), and\nmaking a false statement \u201cwith respect to information\nrequired by [the Act] to be kept\u201d by the dealer, in violation\nof \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). On both counts the Government inter-\nprets this criminal statute to punish conduct that its plain\nlanguage simply does not reach. I respectfully dissent\nfrom the Court\u2019s holding to the contrary.\n2               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                      I. Section 922(a)(6)\n                               A\n   Under \u00a7922(a)(6), it is a crime to make a \u201cfalse . . .\nstatement\u201d to a licensed gun dealer about a \u201cfact material\nto the lawfulness of \u201d a firearms sale. Abramski made a\nfalse statement when he claimed to be the gun\u2019s \u201cactual\ntransferee/buyer\u201d as Form 4473 defined that term. But\nthat false statement was not \u201cmaterial to the lawfulness of\nthe sale\u201d since the truth\u2014that Abramski was buying the\ngun for his uncle with his uncle\u2019s money\u2014would not have\nmade the sale unlawful. See Kungys v. United States, 485\nU. S. 759, 775 (1988) (plurality opinion) (materiality is\ndetermined by asking \u201cwhat would have ensued from\nofficial knowledge of the misrepresented fact\u201d); accord id.,\nat 787 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Therefore,\nAbramski\u2019s conviction on this count cannot stand.\n   Several provisions of the Act limit the circumstances in\nwhich a licensed gun dealer may lawfully sell a firearm.\nMost prominently, the Act provides that no one may \u201csell\nor otherwise dispose of \u201d a firearm to a person who he\nknows or has reasonable cause to believe falls within one\nof nine prohibited categories (such as felons, fugitives,\nillegal-drug users, and the mentally ill). \u00a7922(d). But the\nGovernment does not contend that either Abramski or his\nuncle fell into one of those prohibited categories. And no\nprovision of the Act prohibits one person who is eligible to\nreceive and possess firearms (e.g., Abramski) from buying\na gun for another person who is eligible to receive and\npossess firearms (e.g., Abramski\u2019s uncle), even at the\nother\u2019s request and with the other\u2019s money.\n   The Government\u2019s contention that Abramski\u2019s false\nstatement was material to the lawfulness of the sale de-\npends on a strained interpretation of provisions that\nmention the \u201cperson\u201d to whom a dealer \u201csell[s]\u201d (or \u201ctrans-\nfer[s],\u201d or \u201cdeliver[s]\u201d) a gun.

It bases that assertion on the claim that the Gun\nControl Act implicitly incorporates \u201cprinciples of agency\nlaw.\u201d Brief for United States 17. Under those principles,\nit contends, the individual who walks into a dealer\u2019s store,\nfills out the requisite forms, pays the dealer, and takes\npossession of the gun is not necessarily the \u201cperson\u201d to\nwhom the dealer \u201csell[s]\u201d the gun. Instead, it says, we\nmust ask whether that individual bought the gun as a\nthird party\u2019s common-law agent; if so, then the third party\nis the \u201cperson\u201d to whom the dealer \u201csell[s]\u201d the gun within\nthe meaning of the relevant statutory provisions.

That is of no moment, however,\nbecause Abramski\u2019s uncle was not the \u201cperson\u201d to whom\nthe gun was \u201cs[old].\u201d\n   The contrary interpretation provided by the Govern-\nment and the majority founders on the plain language of\nthe Act. We interpret criminal statutes, like other stat-\nutes, in a manner consistent with ordinary English usage.\nFlores-Figueroa v. United States, 556 U. S. 646, 650\u2013652\n(2009); Jones v.

In\nordinary usage, a vendor sells (or delivers, or transfers) an\nitem of merchandise to the person who physically appears\nin his store, selects the item, pays for it, and takes posses-\nsion of it. So if I give my son $10 and tell him to pick up\nmilk and eggs at the store, no English speaker would say\nthat the store \u201csells\u201d the milk and eggs to me.2 And even if\nwe were prepared to let \u201cprinciples of agency law\u201d trump\nordinary English usage in the interpretation of this crimi-\nnal statute, those principles would not require a different\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndealing with him in person, and checking his background. I doubt\nwhether a falsehood that causes the dealer to neglect those procedures\n(here, by applying them to the wrong person) is material to the lawful-\nness of the sale within the meaning of \u00a7922(a)(6) if the sale could have\nbeen executed lawfully had the truth been disclosed. Moreover, if that\nwere so\u2014if a falsehood that introduced procedural error into a gun sale\nwere always material to lawfulness\u2014then \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) (discussed in\nPart II of this opinion), which prohibits making false statements with\nrespect to information required to be recorded in a dealer\u2019s records,\nwould be superfluous.\n  2 The majority makes the puzzling suggestion that the answer would\n\nbe different if the sale involved consumer electronics instead of grocer-\nies. Ante, at 9, n. 5. But whether the item sold is a carton of milk, an\niPhone, or anything else under the sun, an ordinary English speaker\nwould say that an over-the-counter merchant \u201csells\u201d the item to the\nperson who pays for and takes possession of it, not the individual to\nwhom that person later transfers the item.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Giving the text its plain,\nordinary meaning, Abramski, not his uncle, was that\n\u201cperson.\u201d That being so, the Government has identified no\nreason why the arrangement between Abramski and his\nuncle, both of whom were eligible to receive and possess\n6                  ABRAMSKI v.

Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). But\n\u201cno law pursues its purpose at all costs,\u201d and the \u201ctextual\nlimitations upon a law\u2019s scope\u201d are equally \u201ca part of its\n\u2018purpose.\u2019 \u201d Rapanos v.

The majority\u2019s purpose-based\narguments describe a statute Congress reasonably might\nhave written, but not the statute it wrote.\n   The heart of the majority\u2019s argument is its claim that\nunless Abramski\u2019s uncle is deemed the \u201cperson\u201d to whom\nthe gun was \u201cs[old],\u201d the Act\u2019s identification, background-\ncheck, and record-keeping requirements would be \u201cren-\nder[ed] meaningless.\u201d Ante, at 11. That vastly overstates\nthe consequences. Perhaps the statute would serve the\npurpose of crime prevention more effectively if the re-\nquirements at issue looked past the \u201cman at the counter\u201d\nto the person \u201cgetting, and always meant to get, the fire-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The facts of this case provide no occasion to address whether\u2014as\n\nATF maintained for many years before adopting its current position\u2014a\nmisrepresentation in response to Form 4473\u2019s \u201cactual buyer/transferee\u201d\nquestion would be \u201cmaterial to the lawfulness of the sale\u201d if the cus-\ntomer intended to transfer the gun to a person who he knew or had\nreasonable cause to believe was prohibited by the Act from receiving or\npossessing firearms. A falsehood that conceals an intention of that sort\nmay be material because a dealer who sold the gun knowing of that\nintention might be \u201cunlawfully aiding\u201d the customer\u2019s violation of\n\u00a7924(d) (and the prohibited person\u2019s violation of \u00a7924(g)).

But ensuring that the person taking\npossession of the firearm from the dealer is eligible to\nreceive and possess a firearm, and recording information\nabout that person for later reference, are by no means\nworthless functions. On the contrary, they indisputably\nadvance the purpose of crime prevention by making it\nharder for ineligible persons to acquire guns and easier for\nthe Government to locate those guns in the future; they\nsimply do not advance that purpose to the same degree as\na more exacting law might have done.\n   That the Act\u2019s focus on the \u201cman at the counter\u201d in this\nsituation does not render its requirements \u201cmeaningless\u201d\nis confirmed by the Government\u2019s concession that the Act\nhas a similar focus in many comparable situations where\nthe gun\u2019s immediate purchaser is\u2014to use the majority\u2019s\nphrase\u2014a \u201cmere condui[t]\u201d for a contemplated transfer of\nthe gun to a different person who will \u201ctake possession of,\nown, and use\u201d it.

The Government\u2019s position\n      makes no exception for situations where the gift is\n      specifically requested by the recipient (as gifts\n      sometimes are). So long as no money changes\n      hands, and no agency relationship is formed, be-\n      tween gifter and giftee, the Act is concerned only\n      with the man at the counter.\n\n   \uf0b7\t Guns Intended for Resale.

And it appears the Government\u2019s posi-\n       tion would be the same even if the man at the\n       counter purchased the gun with the intent to sell it\n       to a particular third party, so long as the two did\n       not enter into a common-law agency relationship.\n\n    \uf0b7\t Guns Intended as Raffle Prizes.

The Government\u2019s\nconcession that the statute is operating appropriately in\neach of those scenarios should cause the majority to\nreevaluate its assumptions about the type and degree of\nregulation that the statute regards as \u201cmeaningful.\u201d The\nmajority, it is clear, regards Abramski\u2019s interpretation as\ncreating a loophole in the law; but even if that were a fair\ncharacterization, why is the majority convinced that a\nstatute with so many admitted loopholes does not contain\nthis particular loophole?\n   The majority\u2019s answer to this argument is that \u201cthe\nindividual who sends a straw to a gun store to buy a fire-\narm is transacting with the dealer, in every way but the\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

That cer-\ntainly distinguishes that individual from the intended\nsubsequent donee or purchaser; so would the fact that he\nhas orange hair. But it does not establish why that indi-\nvidual, any more than the others, should be thought to be\ncovered by statutory language (the \u201cperson\u201d to whom\na dealer \u201csell[s]\u201d a gun) that does not naturally apply.\nThe only thing which can justify that leap is the false\nimperative to make the statute as effective as possible,\nrather than as effective as the language indicates Con-\ngress desired.4\n  What the scenarios described above show is that the\nstatute typically is concerned only with the man at the\ncounter, even where that man is in a practical sense a\n\u201cconduit\u201d who will promptly transfer the gun to someone\nelse. Perhaps that is because Congress wanted a rule that\nwould be easy to understand and to administer, which the\nGovernment\u2019s proposed agency test\u2014and the majority\u2019s\napparent adoption of that test sans any mention of agency\nlaw\u2014certainly is not. (When counsel for the Government\nwas pressed about hypothetical situations not gift-\nwrapped as neatly as this case, he said, frankly but un-\nhelpfully, that they would turn on the \u201cfactual question\u201d of\n\u201c[w]hether the purchase was made on behalf of someone\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority\u2019s claim that its analysis \u201cdoes not rest on mere \u2018purpose-\n\nbased arguments,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 9, n. 6, rings hollow. The majority\nsays it is relying on the principle that when a statutory provision is\n\u201cambiguous\u201d but \u201conly one of the permissible meanings produces a\nsubstantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law,\u201d we\nshould adopt that meaning. Ibid.

The majority\u2019s contrary conclusion rests, not on anything\nin the text or structure of the Act, but on the majority\u2019s guess about\nhow far Congress meant to go in pursuit of its crime-prevention\n\u201cpurpose.\u201d\n10              ABRAMSKI v.

Perhaps those whose votes\nwere needed for passage of the statute wanted a lawful\npurchaser to be able to use an agent. A statute shaped by\npolitical tradeoffs in a controversial area may appear\n\u201cimperfect\u201d from some perspectives, but \u201cour ability to\nimagine ways of redesigning the statute to advance one of\nCongress\u2019 ends does not render it irrational.\u201d Preseault v.\nICC, 494 U.

We must accept that Con-\ngress, balancing the conflicting demands of a divided\ncitizenry, \u201c \u2018wrote the statute it wrote\u2019\u2014meaning, a statute\ngoing so far and no further.\u201d Michigan v.

After\nCongress passed the Act in 1968, ATF\u2019s initial position\nwas that the Act did not prohibit the sale of a gun to an\neligible buyer acting on behalf of a third party (even an\nineligible one). See Hearings Before the Subcommittee To\nInvestigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Senate Committee\non the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, 118 (1975).\nA few years later, ATF modified its position and asserted\nthat the Act did not \u201cprohibit a dealer from making a sale\nto a person who is actually purchasing the firearm for\nanother person\u201d unless the other person was \u201cprohibited\nfrom receiving or possessing a firearm,\u201d in which case the\ndealer could be guilty of \u201cunlawfully aiding the prohibited\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Polk, 118 F. 3d 286, 295, n. 7 (CA5 1997).\n   The majority deems this enforcement history \u201cnot rel-\nevant\u201d because the Government\u2019s reading of a criminal\nstatute is not entitled to deference. Ante, at 22. But the\nfact that the agency charged with enforcing the Act read\nit, over a period of roughly 25 years, not to apply to the\ntype of conduct at issue here is powerful evidence that\ninterpreting the Act in that way is natural and reasonable\nand does not make its requirements \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\n                              C\n    Even if the statute were wrongly thought to be ambigu-\nous on this point, the rule of lenity would defeat the Gov-\nernment\u2019s construction. It is a \u201cfamiliar principle\u201d that\n\u201c \u2018ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes\nshould be resolved in favor of lenity.\u2019 \u201d Skilling v. United\nStates, 561 U.

And it\nmeans that when a criminal statute has two possible\nreadings, we do not \u201c \u2018choose the harsher alternative\u2019 \u201d\nunless Congress has \u201c \u2018spoken in language that is clear and\ndefinite.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347\u2013349\n(1971). For the reasons given above, it cannot be said that\nthe statute unambiguously commands the Government\u2019s\ncurrent reading. It is especially contrary to sound practice\nto give this criminal statute a meaning that the Govern-\nment itself rejected for years.\n    The majority does not mention the rule of lenity apart\nfrom a footnote, ante, at 18, n. 10, responding to this dis-\n12                 ABRAMSKI v.

See Part I\u2013B, supra.5 If lenity has no\nrole to play in a clear case such as this one, we ought to\nstop pretending it is a genuine part of our jurisprudence.\n  Contrary to the majority\u2019s miserly approach, the rule of\nlenity applies whenever, after all legitimate tools of inter-\npretation have been exhausted, \u201ca reasonable doubt per-\nsists\u201d regarding whether Congress has made the defend-\nant\u2019s conduct a federal crime, Moskal v.

Section 924(a)(1)(A)\n   Under \u00a7924(a)(1)(A), it is a crime to make a \u201cfalse\nstatement . . . with respect to the information required by\nthis chapter to be kept in the records of \u201d a federally li-\ncensed gun dealer (emphasis added). \u201c[T]his chapter\u201d\nrefers to chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code,\nwhich contains the Gun Control Act. \u00a7\u00a7921\u2013931.\n   The question Abramski answered falsely was whether\nhe was buying the gun for someone else. Did the Act itself\nrequire the dealer to record this information? It did not; it\nsimply required him to record \u201cthe name, age, and place of\nresidence\u201d of the \u201cperson\u201d to whom the firearm was \u201cs[old]\nor deliver[ed].\u201d \u00a7922(b)(5). As explained above, that \u201cper-\nson\u201d was Abramski, not his uncle. See Part I, supra.\n   But, the majority says, the Act also directs dealers to\n\u201c \u2018maintain such records . . . as the Attorney General may\nby regulations prescribe.\u2019 \u201d        Ante, at 22 (quoting\n\u00a7923(g)(1)(A)). So did a regulation require this infor-\nmation to be recorded? Again, no. The relevant regulation\nprovides that a dealer shall\n    \u201cobtain a Form 4473 from the transferee showing the\n14               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n     transferee\u2019s name, sex, residence address (including\n     county or similar political subdivision), date and place\n     of birth; height, weight and race of the transferee; the\n     transferee\u2019s country of citizenship; the transferee\u2019s\n     INS-issued alien number or admission number; the\n     transferee\u2019s State of residence; and certification by the\n     transferee that the transferee is not prohibited by the\n     Act from transporting or shipping a firearm in inter-\n     state or foreign commerce or receiving a firearm\n     which has been shipped or transported in interstate or\n     foreign commerce or possessing a firearm in or affect-\n     ing commerce.\u201d 27 CFR \u00a7478.124(c)(1) (2014).\nThe long list of information that this regulation requires\nto be kept in the dealer\u2019s records does not include whether\nthe transferee is buying the gun for an eligible third party.\n   But wait! the majority says: Another provision of the\nregulation requires a dealer to \u201c \u2018retain . . . as part of [its]\nrequired records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course\nof \u2019 \u201d selling or disposing of a firearm. Ante, at 23 (quoting\n27 CFR \u00a7478.124(a)). Therefore, according to the majority,\nany \u201cfalse answer on that Form\u201d\u2014even an answer to a\nquestion that is not among those enumerated in the regu-\nlation\u2014necessarily \u201cpertains to information a dealer is\nstatutorily required to maintain.\u201d Ante, at 23.\n   That carries the text of the statute a bridge too far. On\nthe majority\u2019s view, if the bureaucrats responsible for\ncreating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer\u2019s favor-\nite color, a false response would be a federal crime. That\nis not what the statute says. The statute punishes mis-\nstatements \u201cwith respect to information required to be\nkept,\u201d \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added), not with respect to\n\u201cinformation contained in forms required to be kept.\u201d\nBecause neither the Act nor any regulation requires a\ndealer to keep a record of whether a customer is purchas-\ning a gun for himself or for an eligible third party, that\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     15\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nquestion had no place on Form 4473\u2014any more than\nwould the question whether the customer was purchasing\nthe gun as a gift for a particular individual and, if so, who\nthat individual was. And the statute no more criminalizes\na false answer to an ultra vires question on Form 4473\nthan it criminalizes the purchaser\u2019s volunteering of a false\ne-mail address on that form. Information regarding\nAbramski\u2019s status as a \u201cstraw purchaser\u201d was not \u201cinfor-\nmation required to be kept,\u201d and that is an end of the\nmatter. In my view, that is the best\u2014indeed, the only\nplausible\u2014interpretation of \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). But at a mini-\nmum, the statute is ambiguous, and lenity does the rest.\nSee Part I\u2013C, supra.6\n                        *     *    *\n  The Court makes it a federal crime for one lawful gun\nowner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner. Whether\nor not that is a sensible result, the statutes Congress\nenacted do not support it\u2014especially when, as is appro-\npriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes in favor of\nthe accused. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The  majority professes that it \u201cneed not, and do[es] not, opine on\u201d\nwhether it would impose liability for \u201ca false answer even to an \u2018ultra\nvires question\u2019 \u201d because, given its reasoning on Count One, the ques-\ntion at issue here was \u201cpart and parcel of the dealer\u2019s determination of\nthe (true) buyer\u2019s \u2018name, age, and place of residence,\u2019 which \u00a7922(b)(5)\nrequires the dealer to keep.\u201d Ante, at 23, n. 11. But if that is really all\nthe majority means to decide, then why bother to invoke the require-\nment that the dealer keep such records as the regulations prescribe and\nthe regulation requiring the dealer to keep Form 4473? See ante, at\n22\u201323. If the majority\u2019s ruling is as limited as it claims, it ought to cite\n\u00a7922(b)(5) and be done.\n",

Argued January 22, 2014\u2014Decided June 16, 2014\nPetitioner Bruce Abramski offered to purchase a handgun for his uncle.\n  The form that federal regulations required Abramski to fill out (Form\n  4473) asked whether he was the \u201cactual transferee/buyer\u201d of the gun,\n  and clearly warned that a straw purchaser (namely, someone buying\n  a gun on behalf of another) was not the actual buyer. Abramski\n  falsely answered that he was the actual buyer. Abramski was con-\n  victed for knowingly making false statements \u201cwith respect to any\n  fact material to the lawfulness of the sale\u201d of a gun, 18 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7922(a)(6), and for making a false statement \u201cwith respect to the in-\n  formation required . . . to be kept\u201d in the gun dealer\u2019s records,\n  \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). The Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Abramski\u2019s misrepresentation is material under \u00a7922(a)(6).\n Pp. 7\u201322.\n       (a) Abramski contends that federal gun laws are entirely uncon-\n cerned with straw arrangements: So long as the person at the counter\n is eligible to own a gun, the sale to him is legal under the statute. To\n be sure, federal law regulates licensed dealer\u2019s transactions with\n \u201cpersons\u201d or \u201ctransferees\u201d without specifying whether that language\n refers to the straw buyer or the actual purchaser. But when read in\n light of the statute\u2019s context, structure, and purpose, it is clear this\n language refers to the true buyer rather than the straw. Federal gun\n law establishes an elaborate system of in-person identification and\n background checks to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of\n felons and other prohibited purchasers. \u00a7\u00a7922(c), 922(t). It also im-\n poses record-keeping requirements to assist law enforcement authori-\n ties in investigating serious crimes through the tracing of guns to\n their buyers. \u00a7922(b)(5), 923(g). These provisions would mean little\n2                    ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    if a would-be gun buyer could evade them all simply by enlisting the\n    aid of an intermediary to execute the paperwork on his behalf. The\n    statute\u2019s language is thus best read in context to refer to the actual\n    rather than nominal buyer. This conclusion is reinforced by this\n    Court\u2019s standard practice of focusing on practical realities rather\n    than legal formalities when identifying the parties to a transaction.\n    Pp. 7\u201319.\n          (b) Abramski argues more narrowly that his false response was\n    not material because his uncle could have legally bought a gun for\n    himself. But Abramski\u2019s false statement prevented the dealer from\n    insisting that the true buyer (Alvarez) appear in person, provide\n    identifying information, show a photo ID, and submit to a back-\n    ground check. \u00a7\u00a7922(b), (c), (t). Nothing in the statute suggests that\n    these legal duties may be wiped away merely because the actual buy-\n    er turns out to be legally eligible to own a gun. Because the dealer\n    could not have lawfully sold the gun had it known that Abramski was\n    not the true buyer, the misstatement was material to the lawfulness\n    of the sale. Pp. 19\u201322.\n       2. Abramski\u2019s misrepresentation about the identity of the actual\n    buyer concerned \u201cinformation required by [Chapter 44 of Title 18 of\n    the United States Code] to be kept\u201d in the dealer\u2019s records.\n    \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). Chapter 44 contains a provision requiring a dealer to\n    \u201cmaintain such records . . . as the Attorney General may . . . pre-\n    scribe.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(1)(A). The Attorney General requires every licensed\n    dealer to retain in its records a completed copy of Form 4473, see 27\n    CFR \u00a7478.124(b), and that form in turn includes the \u201cactual buyer\u201d\n    question that Abramski answered falsely. Therefore, falsely answer-\n    ing a question on Form 4473 violates \u00a7924(a)(1)(A).

To ensure the accuracy of those sub-\nmissions, a federal statute imposes criminal penalties on\nany person who, in connection with a firearm\u2019s acquisition,\nmakes false statements about \u201cany fact material to the\nlawfulness of the sale.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(a)(6). In this\ncase, we consider how that law applies to a so-called straw\npurchaser\u2014namely, a person who buys a gun on someone\nelse\u2019s behalf while falsely claiming that it is for himself.\nWe hold that such a misrepresentation is punishable\nunder the statute, whether or not the true buyer could\nhave purchased the gun without the straw.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Federal law has for over 40 years regulated sales by\nlicensed firearms dealers, principally to prevent guns from\nfalling into the wrong hands. See Gun Control Act of\n1968, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7921 et seq. Under \u00a7922(g), certain classes\n2                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nof people\u2014felons, drug addicts, and the mentally ill, to\nlist a few\u2014may not purchase or possess any firearm. And\nto ensure they do not, \u00a7922(d) forbids a licensed dealer\nfrom selling a gun to anyone it knows, or has reasonable\ncause to believe, is such a prohibited buyer. See Huddle-\nston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 825 (1974) (\u201c[T]he\nfocus of the federal scheme,\u201d in controlling access to weap-\nons, \u201cis the federally licensed firearms dealer\u201d).\n   The statute establishes a detailed scheme to enable the\ndealer to verify, at the point of sale, whether a potential\nbuyer may lawfully own a gun. Section 922(c) brings the\nwould-be purchaser onto the dealer\u2019s \u201cbusiness premises\u201d\nby prohibiting, except in limited circumstances, the sale of\na firearm \u201cto a person who does not appear in person\u201d at\nthat location. Other provisions then require the dealer to\ncheck and make use of certain identifying information\nreceived from the buyer. Before completing any sale, the\ndealer must \u201cverif[y] the identity of the transferee by\nexamining a valid identification document\u201d bearing a\nphotograph. \u00a7922(t)(1)(C). In addition, the dealer must\nprocure the buyer\u2019s \u201cname, age, and place of residence.\u201d\n\u00a7922(b)(5). And finally, the dealer must (with limited\nexceptions not at issue here1) submit that information\nto the National Instant Background Check System (NICS)\nto determine whether the potential purchaser is for\nany reason disqualified from owning a firearm. See\n\u00a7\u00a7922(t)(1)(A)\u2013(B).\n   The statute further insists that the dealer keep certain\nrecords, to enable federal authorities both to enforce the\nlaw\u2019s verification measures and to trace firearms used in\ncrimes. See H. R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 14\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        principal exception is for any buyer who has a state permit that\nhas been \u201cissued only after an authorized government official has\nverified\u201d the buyer\u2019s eligibility to own a gun under both federal and\nstate law. \u00a7922(t)(3).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(1968). A dealer must maintain the identifying infor-\nmation mentioned above (i.e., name, age, and residence) in\nits permanent files. See \u00a7922(b)(5). In addition, the dealer\nmust keep \u201csuch records of . . . sale[ ] or other disposi-\ntion of firearms . . . as the Attorney General may by regu-\nlations prescribe.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(1)(A). And the Attorney Gen-\neral (or his designee) may obtain and inspect any of those\nrecords, \u201cin the course of a bona fide criminal investiga-\ntion,\u201d to \u201cdetermin[e] the disposition of 1 or more fire-\narms.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(7).\n   To implement all those statutory requirements, the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n(ATF) developed Form 4473 for gun sales. See Supp. App.\n1\u20136. The part of that form to be completed by the buyer\nrequests his name, birth date, and address, as well as\ncertain other identifying information (for example, his\nheight, weight, and race). The form further lists all the\nfactors disqualifying a person from gun ownership, and\nasks the would-be buyer whether any of them apply (e.g.,\n\u201c[h]ave you ever been convicted . . . of a felony?\u201d). Id., at 1.\nMost important here, Question 11.a. asks (with bolded\nemphasis appearing on the form itself):\n    \u201cAre you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s)\n    listed on this form? Warning: You are not the ac-\n    tual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on\n    behalf of another person.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    party. ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER EXAM-\n    PLES: Mr. Smith asks Mr. Jones to purchase a fire-\n    arm for Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith gives Mr. Jones the\n    money for the firearm. Mr. Jones is NOT THE\n    ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER of the firearm\n    and must answer \u201cNO\u201d to question 11.a.\u201d Id., at 4.\nAfter responding to this and other questions, the customer\nmust sign a certification declaring his answers \u201ctrue,\ncorrect and complete.\u201d Id., at 2. That certification pro-\nvides that the signator \u201cunderstand[s] that making any\nfalse . . . statement\u201d respecting the transaction\u2014and,\nparticularly, \u201canswering \u2018yes\u2019 to question 11.a. if [he is] not\nthe actual buyer\u201d\u2014is a crime \u201cpunishable as a felony\nunder Federal law.\u201d Ibid. (bold typeface deleted).\n  Two statutory provisions, each designed to ensure that\nthe dealer can rely on the truthfulness of the buyer\u2019s dis-\nclosures in carrying out its obligations, criminalize certain\nfalse statements about firearms transactions. First and\nforemost, \u00a7922(a)(6), provides as follows:\n    \u201cIt shall be unlawful . . . for any person in connection\n    with the acquisition or attempted acquisition of any\n    firearm or ammunition from [a licensed dealer] know-\n    ingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written\n    statement . . . , intended or likely to deceive such\n    [dealer] with respect to any fact material to the law-\n    fulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm\n    or ammunition under the provisions of this chapter.\u201d\nThat provision helps make certain that a dealer will re-\nceive truthful information as to any matter relevant to a\ngun sale\u2019s legality. In addition, \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) prohibits\n\u201cknowingly mak[ing] any false statement or representa-\ntion with respect to the information required by this chap-\nter to be kept in the records\u201d of a federally licensed gun\ndealer. The question in this case is whether, as the ATF\ndeclares in Form 4473\u2019s certification, those statutory\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovisions criminalize a false answer to Question 11.a.\u2014\nthat is, a customer\u2019s statement that he is the \u201cactual\ntransferee/buyer,\u201d purchasing a firearm for himself, when\nin fact he is a straw purchaser, buying the gun on someone\nelse\u2019s behalf.\n                              B\n   The petitioner here is Bruce Abramski, a former police\nofficer who offered to buy a Glock 19 handgun for his\nuncle, Angel Alvarez. (Abramski thought he could get the\ngun for a discount by showing his old police identification,\nthough the Government contends that because he had\nbeen fired from his job two years earlier, he was no longer\nauthorized to use that card.) Accepting his nephew\u2019s offer,\nAlvarez sent Abramski a check for $400 with \u201cGlock 19\nhandgun\u201d written on the memo line. Two days later,\nAbramski went to Town Police Supply, a federally licensed\nfirearms dealer, to make the purchase. There, he filled\nout Form 4473, falsely checking \u201cYes\u201d in reply to Question\n11.a.\u2014that is, asserting he was the \u201cactual transferee/\nbuyer\u201d when, according to the form\u2019s clear definition, he\nwas not. He also signed the requisite certification, ac-\nknowledging his understanding that a false answer to\nQuestion 11.a. is a federal crime. After Abramski\u2019s name\ncleared the NICS background check, the dealer sold him\nthe Glock. Abramski then deposited the $400 check in his\nbank account, transferred the gun to Alvarez, and got back\na receipt. Federal agents found that receipt while execut-\ning a search warrant at Abramski\u2019s home after he became\na suspect in a different crime.\n   A grand jury indicted Abramski for violating \u00a7\u00a7922(a)(6)\nand 924(a)(1)(A) by falsely affirming in his response to\nQuestion 11.a. that he was the Glock\u2019s actual buyer.\nAbramski moved to dismiss both charges. He argued that\nhis misrepresentation on Question 11.a. was not \u201cmaterial\nto the lawfulness of the sale\u201d under \u00a7922(a)(6) because\n6                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nAlvarez was legally eligible to own a gun. And he claimed\nthat the false statement did not violate \u00a7924(a)(1)(A)\nbecause a buyer\u2019s response to Question 11.a. is not \u201cre-\nquired . . . to be kept in the records\u201d of a gun dealer. After\nthe District Court denied those motions, see 778 F. Supp.\n2d 678 (WD Va. 2011), Abramski entered a conditional\nguilty plea, reserving his right to challenge the rulings.\nThe District Court then sentenced him to five years of\nprobation on each count, running concurrently.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the\nconvictions. 706 F. 3d 307 (2013). It noted a division\namong appellate courts on the question Abramski raised\nabout \u00a7922(a)(6)\u2019s materiality requirement: Of three courts\nto have addressed the issue, one agreed with Abramski\nthat a misrepresentation on Question 11.a. is immaterial\nif \u201cthe true purchaser [here, Alvarez] can lawfully pur-\nchase a firearm directly.\u201d Id., at 315 (quoting United\nStates v. Polk, 118 F. 3d 286, 295 (CA5 1997)).2 The\nFourth Circuit, however, thought the majority position\ncorrect: \u201c[T]he identity of the actual purchaser of a firearm\nis a constant that is always material to the lawfulness of a\nfirearm acquisition under \u00a7922(a)(6).\u201d 706 F. 3d, at 316.\nThe court also held that Abramski\u2019s conviction under\n\u00a7924(a)(1)(A) was valid, finding that the statute required a\ndealer to maintain the information at issue in its records.\nId., at 317.\n   We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), principally\nto resolve the Circuit split about \u00a7922(a)(6). In this Court,\nAbramski renews his claim that a false answer to Ques-\ntion 11.a. is immaterial if the true buyer is legally eligible\nto purchase a firearm. But Abramski now focuses on a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Compare Polk, 118 F. 3d, at 294\u2013295, with United States v.

See Brief for Petitioner i.3\nIn brief, he alleges that a false response to Question 11.a.\nis never material to a gun sale\u2019s legality, whether or not\nthe actual buyer is eligible to own a gun. We begin with\nthat fundamental question, next turn to what has become\nAbramski\u2019s back-up argument under \u00a7922(a)(6), and fi-\nnally consider the relatively easy question pertaining to\n\u00a7924(A)(1)(a)\u2019s separate false-statement prohibition. On\neach score, we affirm Abramski\u2019s conviction.\n                             II\n  Abramski\u2019s broad theory (mostly echoed by the dissent)\nis that federal gun law simply does not care about ar-\nrangements involving straw purchasers: So long as the\nperson at the counter is eligible to own a gun, the sale to\nhim is legal under the statute. That is true, Abramski\ncontends, irrespective of any agreement that person has\nmade to purchase the firearm on behalf of someone else\u2014\nincluding someone who cannot lawfully buy or own a gun\nhimself.    Accordingly, Abramski concludes, his \u201cfalse\nstatement that he was the [Glock 19\u2019s] \u2018actual buyer,\u2019 \u201d as\nthat term was \u201cdefined in Question 11.a., was not material\u201d\n\u2014indeed, was utterly irrelevant\u2014\u201cto the lawfulness of\nthe sale.\u201d Id., at 31 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 4\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.). In essence, he claims, Town Police\nSupply could legally have sold the gun to him even if had\ntruthfully answered Question 11.a. by disclosing that he\nwas a straw\u2014because, again, all the federal firearms law\ncares about is whether the individual standing at the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Reflecting that prior consensus, neither of Abramski\u2019s principal\n\namici\u2014the National Rifle Association and a group of 26 States\u2014joins\nAbramski in making this broader argument. They confine themselves\nto supporting the more limited claim about straw purchases made on\nbehalf of eligible gun owners, addressed infra, at 19\u201322.\n8                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndealer\u2019s counter meets the requirements to buy a gun.4\n   At its core, that argument relies on one true fact: Fed-\neral gun law regulates licensed dealers\u2019 transactions with\n\u201cpersons\u201d or \u201ctransferees,\u201d without specifically referencing\nstraw purchasers. Section 922(d), for example, bars a\ndealer from \u201csell[ing] or otherwise dispos[ing] of \u201d a fire-\narm to any \u201cperson\u201d who falls within a prohibited category\u2014\nfelons, drug addicts, the mentally ill, and so forth. See\nsupra, at 1\u20132; see also \u00a7922(b)(5) (before selling a gun to a\n\u201cperson,\u201d the dealer must take down his name, age, and\nresidence); \u00a7922(t)(1) (before selling a gun to a \u201cperson,\u201d\nthe dealer must run a background check). Similarly,\n\u00a7922(t)(1)(C) requires the dealer to verify the identity of\nthe \u201ctransferee\u201d by checking a valid photo ID. See supra,\nat 2; see also \u00a7922(c) (spelling out circumstances in which\na \u201ctransferee\u201d may buy a gun without appearing at the\ndealer\u2019s premises). Abramski contends that Congress\u2019s\nuse of such language alone, sans any mention of \u201cstraw\npurchasers\u201d or \u201cactual buyers,\u201d shows that \u201c[i]t is not\nillegal to buy a gun for someone else.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n15\u201316; Reply Brief 1; see also post, at 2\u20136.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The dissent reserves the question whether the false statement\n\nwould be material if the straw purchaser knew that the true buyer was\nnot eligible to own a firearm. Post, at 6, n. 2. But first, that reserva-\ntion is of quite limited scope: Unlike Abramski\u2019s back-up argument,\nwhich imposes liability whenever the true purchaser cannot legally buy\na gun, the dissent\u2019s reservation applies only when the straw has\nknowledge of (or at least reasonable cause to believe) that fact. And as\nwe will later note, straws often do not have such knowledge. See infra,\nat 12\u201313. Second, the reservation (fairly enough for a reservation) rests\non an uncertain legal theory. According to the dissent, a straw buyer\nmight violate \u00a7922(a)(6) if a dealer\u2019s sale to him aids and abets his\nviolation of \u00a7922(d)\u2014a provision barring knowingly transferring a gun\nto an ineligible person, see infra, at 8, 17\u201318. But that reasoning\npresupposes that a firearms dealer acting in the ordinary course of\nbusiness can ever have the intent needed to aid and abet a crime\u2014a\nquestion this Court reserved not six months ago. See Rosemond v.\nUnited States, 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12, n. 8).\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  But that language merely raises, rather than answers,\nthe critical question: In a straw purchase, who is the\n\u201cperson\u201d or \u201ctransferee\u201d whom federal gun law addresses?\nIs that \u201cperson\u201d the middleman buying a firearm on some-\none else\u2019s behalf (often because the ultimate recipient\ncould not buy it himself, or wants to camouflage the trans-\naction)? Or is that \u201cperson\u201d instead the individual really\npaying for the gun and meant to take possession of it upon\ncompletion of the purchase? Is it the conduit at the coun-\nter, or the gun\u2019s intended owner?5 In answering that in-\nquiry, we must (as usual) interpret the relevant words not\nin a vacuum, but with reference to the statutory context,\n\u201cstructure, history, and purpose.\u201d Maracich v. Spears, 570\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 26). All those tools of\ndivining meaning\u2014not to mention common sense, which is\na fortunate (though not inevitable) side-benefit of constru-\ning statutory terms fairly\u2014demonstrate that \u00a7922, in\nregulating licensed dealers\u2019 gun sales, looks through the\nstraw to the actual buyer.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The dissent claims the answer is easy because \u201cif I give my son $10\n\nand tell him to pick up milk and eggs at the store, no English speaker\nwould say that the store \u2018sells\u2019 the milk and eggs to me.\u201d Post, at 4.\nBut try a question more similar to the one the gun law\u2019s text raises: If I\nsend my brother to the Apple Store with money and instructions to\npurchase an iPhone, and then take immediate and sole possession of\nthat device, am I the \u201cperson\u201d (or \u201ctransferee\u201d) who has bought the\nphone or is he? Nothing in ordinary English usage compels an answer\neither way.\n  6 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s view, our analysis does not rest on mere\n\n\u201cpurpose-based arguments.\u201d Post. at 7. We simply recognize that a\ncourt should not interpret each word in a statute with blinders on,\nrefusing to look at the word\u2019s function within the broader statutory\ncontext. As we have previously put the point, a \u201cprovision that may\nseem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the\nstatutory scheme . . . because only one of the permissible meanings\nproduces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the\nlaw.\u201d United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,\nLtd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988).\n10                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The overarching reason is that Abramski\u2019s reading\nwould undermine\u2014indeed, for all important purposes,\nwould virtually repeal\u2014the gun law\u2019s core provisions.7 As\nnoted earlier, the statute establishes an elaborate system\nto verify a would-be gun purchaser\u2019s identity and check on\nhis background. See supra, at 2. It also requires that the\ninformation so gathered go into a dealer\u2019s permanent\nrecords. See supra, at 2\u20133. The twin goals of this com-\nprehensive scheme are to keep guns out of the hands of\ncriminals and others who should not have them, and to\nassist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious\ncrimes. See Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 824; supra, at 2\u20133.\nAnd no part of that scheme would work if the statute\nturned a blind eye to straw purchases\u2014if, in other words,\nthe law addressed not the substance of a transaction, but\nonly empty formalities.\n  To see why, consider what happens in a typical straw\npurchase. A felon or other person who cannot buy or own\na gun still wants to obtain one. (Or, alternatively, a per-\nson who could legally buy a firearm wants to conceal his\npurchase, maybe so he can use the gun for criminal pur-\nposes without fear that police officers will later trace it to\nhim.) Accordingly, the prospective buyer enlists an inter-\nmediary to help him accomplish his illegal aim. Perhaps\nhe conscripts a loyal friend or family member; perhaps\nmore often, he hires a stranger to purchase the gun for a\nprice. The actual purchaser might even accompany the\nstraw to the gun shop, instruct him which firearm to buy,\ngive him the money to pay at the counter, and take pos-\nsession as they walk out the door. See, e.g., United States\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 That reading would also, at a stroke, declare unlawful a large part\n\nof what the ATF does to combat gun trafficking by criminals. See Dept.\nof Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, Following the\nGun: Enforcing Federal Laws Against Firearms Traffickers, p. xi (June\n2000) (noting that in several prior years \u201c[a]lmost half of all [ATF\nfirearm] trafficking investigations involved straw purchasers\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Bowen, 207 Fed. Appx. 727, 729 (CA7 2006) (describing\na straw purchase along those lines); United States v. Paye,\n129 Fed. Appx. 567, 570 (CA11 2005) (per curiam) (same).\nWhat the true buyer would not do\u2014what he would leave\nto the straw, who possesses the gun for all of a minute\u2014is\ngive his identifying information to the dealer and submit\nhimself to a background check. How many of the statute\u2019s\nprovisions does that scenario\u2014the lawful result of\nAbramski\u2019s (and the dissent\u2019s) reading of \u201ctransferee\u201d and\n\u201cperson\u201d\u2014render meaningless?\n   Start with the parts of \u00a7922 enabling a dealer to verify\nwhether a buyer is legally eligible to own a firearm. That\ntask, as noted earlier, begins with identification\u2014\nrequesting the name, address, and age of the potential\npurchaser and checking his photo ID. See \u00a7\u00a7922(b)(5),\n(t)(1)(C); supra, at 2. And that identification in turn per-\nmits a background check: The dealer runs the purchaser\u2019s\nname through the NICS database to discover whether he\nis, for example, a felon, drug addict, or mentally ill person.\nSee \u00a7\u00a7922(d), (t)(1); supra, at 2. All those provisions are\ndesigned to accomplish what this Court has previously\ntermed Congress\u2019s \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d in enacting the\nstatute\u2014\u201cto curb crime by keeping \u2018firearms out of the\nhands of those not legally entitled to possess them.\u2019 \u201d\nHuddleston, 415 U. S., at 824 (quoting S. Rep. No. 1501,\n90th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1968)). But under Abramski\u2019s\nreading, the statutory terms would be utterly ineffectual,\nbecause the identification and background check would be\nof the wrong person. The provisions would evaluate the\neligibility of mere conduits, while allowing every criminal\n(and drug addict and so forth) to escape that assessment\nand walk away with a weapon.\n   Similarly, Abramski\u2019s view would defeat the point of\n\u00a7922(c), which tightly restricts the sale of guns \u201cto a per-\nson who does not appear in person at the licensee\u2019s busi-\nness premises.\u201d See supra, at 2. Only a narrow class of\n12              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprospective buyers may ever purchase a gun from afar\u2014\nprimarily, individuals who have already had their eligibil-\nity to own a firearm verified by state law enforcement\nofficials with access to the NICS database. See 27 CFR\n\u00a7478.96(b) (2014), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(t)(3); n. 1, supra. And\neven when an individual fits within that category, he still\nmust submit to the dealer a sworn statement that he can\nlawfully own a gun, as well as provide the name and ad-\ndress of the principal law enforcement officer in his com-\nmunity. See \u00a7922(c)(1). The dealer then has to forward\nnotice of the sale to that officer, in order to allow law\nenforcement authorities to investigate the legality of the\nsale and, if necessary, call a stop to it. See \u00a7\u00a7922(c)(2)\u2013(3).\nThe provision thus prevents remote sales except to a small\nclass of buyers subject to extraordinary procedures\u2014\nagain, to ensure effective verification of a potential pur-\nchaser\u2019s eligibility. Yet on Abramski\u2019s view, a person\ncould easily bypass the scheme, purchasing a gun without\never leaving his home by dispatching to a gun store a\nhired deliveryman. Indeed, if Abramski were right, we see\nno reason why anyone (and certainly anyone with less-\nthan-pure motives) would put himself through the proce-\ndures laid out in \u00a7922(c): Deliverymen, after all, are not so\nhard to come by.\n   And likewise, the statute\u2019s record-keeping provisions\nwould serve little purpose if the records kept were of\nnominal rather than real buyers. As noted earlier, dealers\nmust store, and law enforcement officers may obtain,\ninformation about a gun buyer\u2019s identity. See \u00a7\u00a7922(b)(5),\n923(g); supra, at 3. That information helps to fight serious\ncrime. When police officers retrieve a gun at a crime\nscene, they can trace it to the buyer and consider him as a\nsuspect. See National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc. v.\nJones, 716 F. 3d 200, 204 (CADC 2013) (describing law\nenforcement\u2019s use of firearm tracing). Too, the required\nrecords enable dealers to identify certain suspicious pur-\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nchasing trends, which they then must report to federal\nauthorities. See \u00a7923(g)(3) (imposing a reporting obliga-\ntion when a person buys multiple handguns within five\ndays). But once again, those provisions can serve their\nobjective only if the records point to the person who took\nactual control of the gun(s). Otherwise, the police will at\nmost learn the identity of an intermediary, who could not\nhave been responsible for the gun\u2019s use and might know\nnext to nothing about the actual buyer. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Juarez, 626 F. 3d 246, 249 (CA5 2010) (straw\npurchaser bought military-style assault rifles, later found\namong Mexican gang members, for a buyer known \u201conly as\n\u2018El Mano\u2019 \u201d). Abramski\u2019s view would thus render the re-\nquired records close to useless for aiding law enforcement:\nPutting true numbskulls to one side, anyone purchasing a\ngun for criminal purposes would avoid leaving a paper\ntrail by the simple expedient of hiring a straw.\n   To sum up so far: All the prerequisites for buying a gun\ndescribed above refer to a \u201cperson\u201d or \u201ctransferee.\u201d Read\nAbramski\u2019s way (\u201cthe man at the counter\u201d), those terms\ndeny effect to the regulatory scheme, as criminals could\nalways use straw purchasers to evade the law.8 Read the\nother way (\u201cthe man getting, and always meant to get, the\nfirearm\u201d), those terms give effect to the statutory provi-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent is mistaken when it says that the ATF\u2019s own former\n\nview of the statute refutes this proposition. See post, at 11\u201312. As we\nwill later discuss, see infra, at 21\u201322, the ATF for a time thought that\n\u00a7922(a)(6) did not cover cases in which the true purchaser could have\nlegally purchased a gun himself. But Abramski\u2019s principal argument\nextends much further, to cases in which straws buy weapons for crimi-\nnals, drug addicts, and other prohibited purchasers. For the reasons\njust stated, that interpretation would render the statute all but useless.\nAnd although the dissent appeals to a snippet of congressional testi-\nmony to suggest that ATF once briefly held that extreme view of the\nstatute, it agrees that by at least 1979 (well over three decades ago),\nATF recognized the unlawfulness of straw purchases on behalf of\nprohibited persons.\n14              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions, allowing them to accomplish their manifest objects.\nThat alone provides more than sufficient reason to under-\nstand \u201cperson\u201d and \u201ctransferee\u201d as referring not to the\nfictitious but to the real buyer.\n   And other language in \u00a7922 confirms that construction,\nby evincing Congress\u2019s concern with the practical realities,\nrather than the legal niceties, of firearms transactions.\nFor example, \u00a7922(a)(6) itself bars material misrepresen-\ntations \u201cin connection with the acquisition,\u201d and not just\nthe purchase, of a firearm. That broader word, we have\npreviously held, does not focus on \u201clegal title\u201d\u2014let alone\nlegal title for a few short moments, until another, always\nintended transfer occurs. Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 820.\nInstead, the term signifies \u201ccom[ing] into possession,\ncontrol, or power of disposal,\u201d as the actual buyer in a\nstraw purchase does. Ibid. Similarly, we have reasoned\nthat such a substance-over-form approach draws support\nfrom the statute\u2019s repeated references to \u201cthe sale or other\ndisposition\u201d of a firearm. \u00a7922(a)(6); see \u00a7922(d) (making\nit unlawful to \u201csell or otherwise dispose of \u201d a gun to a\nprohibited person). That term, we have stated, \u201cwas\naimed at providing maximum coverage.\u201d Id., at 826\u2013827.\nWe think such expansive language inconsistent with\nAbramski\u2019s view of the statute, which would stare myopi-\ncally at the nominal buyer while remaining blind to the\nperson exiting the transaction with control of the gun.\n   Finally, our reading of \u00a7922 comports with courts\u2019\nstandard practice, evident in many legal spheres and\npresumably known to Congress, of ignoring artifice when\nidentifying the parties to a transaction. In United States\nv. One 1936 Model Ford V-8 Deluxe Coach, Commercial\nCredit Co., 307 U. S. 219 (1939), for example, we consid-\nered the operation of a statute requiring forfeiture of any\ninterest in property that was used to violate prohibition\nlaws, except if acquired in good faith. There, a straw\npurchaser had bought a car in his name but with his\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbrother\u2019s money, and transferred it to the brother\u2014a\nknown bootlegger\u2014right after driving it off the lot. See\nid., at 222\u2013223. The Court held the finance company\u2019s lien\non the car non-forfeitable because the company had no\nhint that the straw was a straw\u2014that his brother would\nin fact be the owner. See id., at 224. But had the com-\npany known, the Court made clear, a different result would\nhave obtained: The company could not have relied on the\nformalities of the sale to the \u201c \u2018straw\u2019 purchaser\u201d when it\nknew that the \u201creal owner and purchaser\u201d of the car was\nsomeone different. Id., at 223\u2013224. We have similarly\nemphasized the need in other contexts, involving both\ncriminal and civil penalties, to look through a transac-\ntion\u2019s nominal parties to its true participants. See, e.g.,\nAmerican Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 560\nU. S. 183, 193 (2010) (focusing on \u201csubstance rather than\nform\u201d in assessing when entities are distinct enough to be\ncapable of conspiring to violate the antitrust laws); Gregory\nv. Helvering, 293 U. S. 465, 470 (1935) (disregarding an\nintermediary shell corporation created to avoid taxes\nbecause doing otherwise would \u201cexalt artifice above reality\u201d).\nWe do no more than that here in holding, consistent\nwith \u00a7922\u2019s text, structure, and purpose, that using a\nstraw does not enable evasion of the firearms law.\n   Abramski, along with the dissent, objects that such\naction is no circumvention\u2014that Congress made an inten-\ntional choice, born of \u201cpolitical compromise,\u201d to limit the\ngun law\u2019s compass to the person at the counter, even if\nmerely acting on another\u2019s behalf. Reply Brief 11; post, at\n10\u201311. As evidence, Abramski states that the statute does\nnot regulate beyond the initial point of sale. Because the\nlaw mostly addresses sales made by licensed dealers, a\npurchaser can (within wide limits) subsequently decide to\nresell his gun to another private party. See Reply Brief\n11. And similarly, Abramski says, a purchaser can buy a\ngun for someone else as a gift. See Brief for Petitioner 26\u2013\n16                ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n27, n. 3. Abramski lumps in the same category the trans-\nfer of a gun from a nominal to a real buyer\u2014as something,\nlike a later resale or gift, meant to fall outside the stat-\nute\u2019s     (purported)    standing-in-front-of-the-gun-dealer\nscope. See Reply Brief 13; see also post, at 7\u20139.\n   But Abramski and the dissent draw the wrong conclu-\nsion from their observations about resales and gifts. Yes,\nCongress decided to regulate dealers\u2019 sales, while leaving\nthe secondary market for guns largely untouched. As we\nnoted in Huddleston, Congress chose to make the dealer\nthe \u201cprincipal agent of federal enforcement\u201d in \u201crestricting\n[criminals\u2019] access to firearms.\u201d 415 U. S., at 824. And\nyes, that choice (like pretty much everything Congress\ndoes) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw\narrangements are not a part of the secondary market,\nseparate and apart from the dealer\u2019s sale. In claiming as\nmuch, Abramski merely repeats his mistaken assumption\nthat the \u201cperson\u201d who acquires a gun from a dealer in a\ncase like this one is the straw, rather than the individual\nwho has made a prior arrangement to pay for, take pos-\nsession of, own, and use that part of the dealer\u2019s stock.\nFor all the reasons we have already given, that is not a\nplausible construction of a statute mandating that the\ndealer identify and run a background check on the person\nto whom it is (really, not fictitiously) selling a gun. See\nsupra, at 9\u201315. The individual who sends a straw to a gun\nstore to buy a firearm is transacting with the dealer, in\nevery way but the most formal; and that distinguishes\nsuch a person from one who buys a gun, or receives a gun\nas a gift, from a private party.9 The line Congress drew\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The dissent responds: \u201cThat certainly distinguishes\u201d the individual\n\ntransacting with a dealer through a straw from an individual receiving\na gun from a private party; \u201cso would the fact that [the former] has\norange hair.\u201d Post, at 9. But that is an example of wit gone wrong.\nWhether the purchaser has orange hair, we can all agree, is immaterial\nto the statutory scheme. By contrast, whether the purchaser has\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween those who acquire guns from dealers and those\nwho get them as gifts or on the secondary market, we\nsuspect, reflects a host of things, including administrative\nsimplicity and a view about where the most problematic\nfirearm transactions\u2014like criminal organizations\u2019 bulk\ngun purchases\u2014typically occur. But whatever the reason,\nthe scarcity of controls in the secondary market provides\nno reason to gut the robust measures Congress enacted at\nthe point of sale.\n   Abramski claims further support for his argument from\nCongress\u2019s decision in 1986 to amend \u00a7922(d) to prohibit a\nprivate party (and not just, as originally enacted, a li-\ncensed dealer) from selling a gun to someone he knows or\nreasonably should know cannot legally possess one. See\nFirearm Owners\u2019 Protection Act, \u00a7102(5)(A), 100 Stat.\n451\u2013452. According to Abramski, the revised \u00a7922(d)\nshould be understood as Congress\u2019s exclusive response to\nthe potential dangers arising from straw purchases. See\nBrief for Petitioner 26\u201327. The amendment shows, he\nclaims, that \u201cCongress chose to address this perceived\nproblem in a way other than\u201d by imposing liability under\n\u00a7922(a)(6) on a straw who tells a licensed dealer that he is\nthe firearm\u2019s actual buyer. Reply Brief 14, n. 2.\n   But Congress\u2019s amendment of \u00a7922(d) says nothing\nabout \u00a7922(a)(6)\u2019s application to straw purchasers. In en-\nacting that amendment, Congress left \u00a7922(a)(6) just as\nit was, undercutting any suggestion that Congress some-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntransacted with a licensed dealer is integral to the statute\u2014because, as\npreviously noted, \u201cthe federal scheme . . . controls access to weapons\u201d\nthrough the federally licensed firearms dealer, who is \u201cthe principal\nagent of federal enforcement.\u201d Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S.\n814, 824, 825 (1974); see supra, at 16. In so designing the statute,\nCongress chose not to pursue the goal of \u201ccontroll[ing] access\u201d to guns to\nthe nth degree; buyers can, as the dissent says, avoid the statute\u2019s\nbackground check and record-keeping requirements by getting a gun\nsecond-hand. But that possibility provides no justification for limiting\nthe statute\u2019s considered regulation of dealer sales.\n18                ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhow intended to contract that provision\u2019s reach. The\namendment instead performed a different function: Rather\nthan ensuring that a licensed dealer receives truthful\ninformation, it extended a minimal form of regulation to\nthe secondary market. The revised \u00a7922(d) prevents a\nprivate person from knowingly selling a gun to an ineligi-\nble owner no matter when or how he acquired the weapon:\nIt thus applies not just to a straw purchaser, but to an\nindividual who bought a gun for himself and later decided\nto resell it. At the same time, \u00a7922(d) has nothing to say\nabout a raft of cases \u00a7922(a)(6) covers, including all the\n(many) straw purchases in which the frontman does not\nknow that the actual buyer is ineligible. See supra, at 13.\nThus, \u00a7922(d) could not serve as an effective substitute for\n\u00a7922(a)(6). And the mere potential for some transactions\nto run afoul of both prohibitions gives no cause to read\n\u00a7922(d) as limiting \u00a7922(a)(6) (or vice versa). See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 118\u2013126\n(1979).10\n  Abramski\u2019s principal attack on his \u00a7922(a)(6) conviction\ntherefore fails. Contrary to his contention, the infor-\nmation Question 11.a. requests\u2014\u201c[a]re you the actual\ntransferee/buyer[?]\u201d or, put conversely, \u201care [you] acquir-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Nor do we agree with the dissent\u2019s argument (not urged by\n\nAbramski himself) that the rule of lenity defeats our construction. See\npost, at 12\u201314. That rule, as we have repeatedly emphasized, applies\nonly if, \u201cafter considering text, structure, history and purpose, there\nremains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that\nthe Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d Maracich\nv. Spears, 570 U. S ___, ___ (2013) (slip op. at 26) (quoting Barber v.\nThomas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488 (2010)). We are not in that position here:\nAlthough the text creates some ambiguity, the context, structure,\nhistory, and purpose resolve it. The dissent would apply the rule of\nlenity here because the statute\u2019s text, taken alone, permits a narrower\nconstruction, but we have repeatedly emphasized that is not the appro-\npriate test. See, e.g., Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 138\n(1998); Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993).\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning the firearm(s) on behalf of another person[?]\u201d\u2014is\nrelevant to the lawfulness of a gun sale. That is because,\nfor all the reasons we have given, the firearms law con-\ntemplates that the dealer will check not the fictitious\npurchaser\u2019s but instead the true purchaser\u2019s identity and\neligibility for gun ownership. By concealing that Alvarez\nwas the actual buyer, Abramski prevented the dealer from\ntransacting with Alvarez face-to-face, see \u00a7922(c), record-\ning his name, age, and residence, see \u00a7922(b)(5), inspect-\ning his photo ID, see \u00a7922(t)(1)(C), submitting his identify-\ning information to the background check system, see\n\u00a7922(t)(1)(B), and determining whether he was prohibited\nfrom receiving a firearm, see \u00a7922(d). In sum, Abramski\nthwarted application of essentially all of the firearms law\u2019s\nrequirements. We can hardly think of a misrepresentation\nany more material to a sale\u2019s legality.\n                              III\n  Abramski also challenges his \u00a7922(a)(6) conviction on a\nnarrower ground. For purposes of this argument, he\nassumes that the Government can make its case when a\nstraw hides the name of an underlying purchaser who is\nlegally ineligible to own a gun. But, Abramski reminds us,\nthat is not true here, because Alvarez could have bought a\ngun for himself. In such circumstances, Abramski claims\nthat a false response to Question 11.a. is not material. See\nBrief for Petitioner 28\u201330. Essentially, Abramski con-\ntends, when the hidden purchaser is eligible anyway to\nown a gun, all\u2019s well that ends well, and all should be\nforgiven.\n  But we think what we have already said shows the\nfallacy of that claim: Abramski\u2019s false statement was\nmaterial because had he revealed that he was purchasing\nthe gun on Alvarez\u2019s behalf, the sale could not have pro-\nceeded under the law\u2014even though Alvarez turned out to\nbe an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter,\n20              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould not have complied with \u00a7922(c)\u2019s restrictions on\nabsentee purchases. See supra, at 11\u201312. If the dealer\nhere, Town Police Supply, had realized it was in fact\nselling a gun to Alvarez, it would have had to stop the\ntransaction for failure to comply with those conditions.\nYet more, the sale could not have gone forward because\nthe dealer would have lacked the information needed to\nverify and record Alvarez\u2019s identity and check his back-\nground. See \u00a7\u00a7922(b)(5), (t)(1)(B)\u2013(C); supra, at 10\u201312.\nThose requirements, as we have explained, pertain to the\nreal buyer; and the after-the-fact discovery that Alvarez\nwould have passed the background check cannot somehow\nwipe them away. Accordingly, had Town Police Supply\nknown Abramski was a straw, it could not have certified,\nas Form 4473 demands, its belief that the transfer was\n\u201cnot unlawful.\u201d Supp. App. 3.\n  An analogy may help show the weakness of Abramski\u2019s\nargument. Suppose a would-be purchaser, Smith, lawfully\ncould own a gun. But further suppose that, for reasons of\nhis own, Smith uses an alias (let\u2019s say Jones) to make the\npurchase. Would anyone say \u201cno harm, no foul,\u201d just\nbecause Smith is not in fact a prohibited person under\n\u00a7922(d)? We think not. Smith would in any event have\nmade a false statement about who will own the gun, im-\npeding the dealer\u2019s ability to carry out its legal responsi-\nbilities. So too here.\n  Abramski objects that because Alvarez could own a gun,\nthe statute\u2019s core purpose\u2014\u201ckeeping guns out of the\nhands\u201d of criminals and other prohibited persons\u2014\u201cis not\neven implicated.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 29. But that argu-\nment (which would apply no less to the alias scenario)\nmisunderstands the way the statute works. As earlier\nnoted, the federal gun law makes the dealer \u201c[t]he princi-\npal agent of federal enforcement.\u201d Huddleston, 415 U. S.,\nat 824, see supra, at 16. It is that highly regulated, legally\nknowledgeable entity, possessing access to the expansive\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNICS database, which has the responsibility to \u201c[e]nsure\nthat, in the course of sales or other dispositions . . . ,\nweapons [are not] obtained by individuals whose posses-\nsion of them would be contrary to the public interest.\u201d 415\nU. S., at 825. Nothing could be less consonant with the\nstatutory scheme than placing that inquiry in the hands of\nan unlicensed straw purchaser, who is unlikely to be\nfamiliar with federal firearms law and has no ability to\nuse the database to check whether the true buyer may\nown a gun. And in any event, keeping firearms out of the\nhands of criminals is not \u00a7922\u2019s only goal: The statute\u2019s\nrecord-keeping provisions, as we have said, are also de-\nsigned to aid law enforcement in the investigation of\ncrime. See supra, at 2\u20133, 12\u201313. Abramski\u2019s proposed\nlimitation on \u00a7922(a)(6) would undercut that purpose\nbecause many would-be criminals remain legally eligible\nto buy firearms, and thus could use straws to purchase an\nendless stream of guns off-the-books. See, e.g., Polk, 118\nF. 3d, at 289 (eligible gun buyer used straw purchasers to\nsecretly accumulate an \u201carsenal of weapons\u201d for a \u201cmas-\nsive offensive\u201d against the Federal Government).\n   In addition, Abramski briefly notes that until 1995, the\nATF took the view that a straw purchaser\u2019s misrepresen-\ntation counted as material only if the true buyer could not\nlegally possess a gun. See Brief for Petitioner 7\u20138; n. 8,\nsupra. We may put aside that ATF has for almost two\ndecades now taken the opposite position, after reflecting\non both appellate case law and changes in the statute. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 41; Brady Handgun Violence Prevention\nAct of 1993, \u00a7103, 107 Stat. 1541 (codified at 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7922(t)). The critical point is that criminal laws are for\ncourts, not for the Government, to construe. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Apel, 571 U. S. ___, (2014) (slip op., at 9)\n(\u201c[W]e have never held that the Government\u2019s reading of a\ncriminal statute is entitled to any deference\u201d). We think\nATF\u2019s old position no more relevant than its current one\u2014\n22              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich is to say, not relevant at all. Whether the Govern-\nment interprets a criminal statute too broadly (as it some-\ntimes does) or too narrowly (as the ATF used to in constru-\ning \u00a7922(a)(6)), a court has an obligation to correct its\nerror. Here, nothing suggests that Congress\u2014the entity\nwhose voice does matter\u2014limited its prohibition of a\nstraw purchaser\u2019s misrepresentation in the way Abramski\nproposes.\n                              IV\n  Finally, Abramski challenges his conviction under\n\u00a7924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits \u201cknowingly mak[ing] any\nfalse statement . . . with respect to the information re-\nquired by this chapter to be kept in the records\u201d of a feder-\nally licensed dealer. That provision is broader than\n\u00a7922(a)(6) in one respect: It does not require that the false\nstatement at issue be \u201cmaterial\u201d in any way. At the same\ntime, \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) includes an element absent from\n\u00a7922(a)(6): The false statement must relate to \u201cinfor-\nmation required by this chapter to be kept in [a dealer\u2019s]\nrecords.\u201d Abramski notes that the indictment in this case\ncharged him with only one misrepresentation: his state-\nment in response to Question 11.a. that he was buying the\nGlock on his own behalf rather than on someone else\u2019s.\nAnd, he argues, that information (unlike the transferee\u2019s\n\u201cname, age, and place of residence,\u201d which he plausibly\nreads the indictment as not mentioning) was not required\n\u201cby this chapter\u201d\u2014but only by Form 4473 itself\u2014to be kept\nin the dealer\u2019s permanent records. Brief for Petitioner 32.\n  We disagree. Included in \u201cthis chapter\u201d\u2014Chapter 44 of\nTitle 18\u2014is a provision, noted earlier, requiring a dealer\nto \u201cmaintain such records of . . . sale, or other disposition\nof firearms at his place of business for such period, and in\nsuch form, as the Attorney General may by regulations\nprescribe.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(1)(A); supra, at 3. Because of that\nstatutory section, the information that the Attorney Gen-\neral\u2019s regulations compel a dealer to keep is information\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201crequired by this chapter.\u201d And those regulations (the\nvalidity of which Abramski does not here contest) demand\nthat every licensed dealer \u201cretain . . . as a part of [its]\nrequired records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course\nof \u201d selling or otherwise disposing of a firearm. 27 CFR\n\u00a7478.124(b). Accordingly, a false answer on that form,\nsuch as the one Abramski made, pertains to information a\ndealer is statutorily required to maintain.11\n                              V\n   No piece of information is more important under federal\nfirearms law than the identity of a gun\u2019s purchaser\u2014the\nperson who acquires a gun as a result of a transaction\nwith a licensed dealer. Had Abramski admitted that he\nwas not that purchaser, but merely a straw\u2014that he was\nasking the dealer to verify the identity of, and run a back-\nground check on, the wrong individual\u2014the sale here\ncould not have gone forward. That makes Abramski\u2019s\nmisrepresentation on Question 11.a. material under\n\u00a7922(a)(6). And because that statement pertained to\ninformation that a dealer must keep in its permanent\nrecords under the firearms law, Abramski\u2019s answer to\nQuestion 11.a. also violated \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, we\naffirm the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The dissent argues that our view would impose criminal liability for\n\na false answer even to an \u201cultra vires question,\u201d such as \u201cthe buyer\u2019s\nfavorite color.\u201d Post, at 15. We need not, and do not, opine on that\nhypothetical, because it is miles away from this case. As we have\nexplained, see supra at 9\u201319, Question 11.a. is not ultra vires, but\ninstead fundamental to the lawfulness of a gun sale. It is, indeed, part\nand parcel of the dealer\u2019s determination of the (true) buyer\u2019s \u201cname,\nage, and place of residence,\u201d which \u00a7922(b)(5) requires the dealer to\nkeep. That section alone would justify Abramski\u2019s conviction under\n\u00a7924(a)(1)(A) if the indictment here had clearly alleged that, in addition\nto answering Question 11.a. falsely, he lied about that buyer\u2019s \u201cname,\nage, and place of residence.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Both men were legally eligible to receive\nand possess firearms, and Abramski transferred the gun\nto his uncle at a federally licensed gun dealership in com-\npliance with state law. When buying the gun, Abramski\nhad to fill out Form 4473 issued by the Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). In response to a\nquestion on the form, Abramski affirmed that he was the\n\u201cactual/transferee buyer\u201d of the gun, even though the form\nstated that he was not the \u201cactual transferee/buyer\u201d if he\nwas purchasing the gun for a third party at that person\u2019s\nrequest and with funds provided by that person.\n  The Government charged Abramski with two federal\ncrimes under the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, 18\nU.

Therefore,\nAbramski\u2019s conviction on this count cannot stand.\n   Several provisions of the Act limit the circumstances in\nwhich a licensed gun dealer may lawfully sell a firearm.\nMost prominently, the Act provides that no one may \u201csell\nor otherwise dispose of \u201d a firearm to a person who he\nknows or has reasonable cause to believe falls within one\nof nine prohibited categories (such as felons, fugitives,\nillegal-drug users, and the mentally ill). \u00a7922(d). But the\nGovernment does not contend that either Abramski or his\nuncle fell into one of those prohibited categories. And no\nprovision of the Act prohibits one person who is eligible to\nreceive and possess firearms (e.g., Abramski) from buying\na gun for another person who is eligible to receive and\npossess firearms (e.g., Abramski\u2019s uncle), even at the\nother\u2019s request and with the other\u2019s money.\n   The Government\u2019s contention that Abramski\u2019s false\nstatement was material to the lawfulness of the sale de-\npends on a strained interpretation of provisions that\nmention the \u201cperson\u201d to whom a dealer \u201csell[s]\u201d (or \u201ctrans-\nfer[s],\u201d or \u201cdeliver[s]\u201d) a gun.

He may not, without following special proce-\ndures, \u201csell\u201d a firearm to a \u201cperson\u201d who does not appear in\nperson at the dealer\u2019s business. \u00a7922(c). He may not\n\u201ctransfer\u201d a firearm to a \u201cperson\u201d without verifying that\nperson\u2019s identity and running a background check.\n\u00a7922(t)(1). And he may not \u201csell or deliver\u201d a firearm to a\n\u201cperson\u201d who he knows or has reasonable cause to believe\nresides in a different State. \u00a7922(b)(3).\n   The Government maintains that in this case Abramski\u2019s\nuncle was the \u201cperson\u201d to whom the dealer \u201cs[old]\u201d the\ngun, and that the sale consequently violated those provi-\nsions. It bases that assertion on the claim that the Gun\nControl Act implicitly incorporates \u201cprinciples of agency\nlaw.\u201d Brief for United States 17. Under those principles,\nit contends, the individual who walks into a dealer\u2019s store,\nfills out the requisite forms, pays the dealer, and takes\npossession of the gun is not necessarily the \u201cperson\u201d to\nwhom the dealer \u201csell[s]\u201d the gun. Instead, it says, we\nmust ask whether that individual bought the gun as a\nthird party\u2019s common-law agent; if so, then the third party\nis the \u201cperson\u201d to whom the dealer \u201csell[s]\u201d the gun within\nthe meaning of the relevant statutory provisions. The\nmajority agrees: Although it never explicitly mentions\nagency law, it declares that if an individual is \u201cbuying a\nfirearm on someone else\u2019s behalf,\u201d the \u201csomeone else\u201d is\nthe \u201cperson\u201d to whom the dealer \u201csell[s]\u201d the gun within\nthe meaning of the statute. Ante, at 9.\n   I doubt that three of the four provisions at issue here\nwould establish the materiality of Abramski\u2019s falsehood\neven if Abramski\u2019s uncle were deemed the \u201cperson\u201d to\nwhom the dealer \u201cs[old]\u201d the gun.1 But \u00a7922(b)(3) would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Sections 922(b)(5), (c), and (t)(1) require the dealer to follow certain\n\nprocedures with respect to that \u201cperson,\u201d such as recording his name,\n4                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nunquestionably do so, since it prohibits a dealer from\nselling a gun to a person who resides in another State, as\nAbramski\u2019s uncle did. That is of no moment, however,\nbecause Abramski\u2019s uncle was not the \u201cperson\u201d to whom\nthe gun was \u201cs[old].\u201d\n   The contrary interpretation provided by the Govern-\nment and the majority founders on the plain language of\nthe Act. We interpret criminal statutes, like other stat-\nutes, in a manner consistent with ordinary English usage.\nFlores-Figueroa v. United States, 556 U. S. 646, 650\u2013652\n(2009); Jones v.

In\nordinary usage, a vendor sells (or delivers, or transfers) an\nitem of merchandise to the person who physically appears\nin his store, selects the item, pays for it, and takes posses-\nsion of it. So if I give my son $10 and tell him to pick up\nmilk and eggs at the store, no English speaker would say\nthat the store \u201csells\u201d the milk and eggs to me.2 And even if\nwe were prepared to let \u201cprinciples of agency law\u201d trump\nordinary English usage in the interpretation of this crimi-\nnal statute, those principles would not require a different\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndealing with him in person, and checking his background. I doubt\nwhether a falsehood that causes the dealer to neglect those procedures\n(here, by applying them to the wrong person) is material to the lawful-\nness of the sale within the meaning of \u00a7922(a)(6) if the sale could have\nbeen executed lawfully had the truth been disclosed. Moreover, if that\nwere so\u2014if a falsehood that introduced procedural error into a gun sale\nwere always material to lawfulness\u2014then \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) (discussed in\nPart II of this opinion), which prohibits making false statements with\nrespect to information required to be recorded in a dealer\u2019s records,\nwould be superfluous.\n  2 The majority makes the puzzling suggestion that the answer would\n\nbe different if the sale involved consumer electronics instead of grocer-\nies. Ante, at 9, n. 5. But whether the item sold is a carton of milk, an\niPhone, or anything else under the sun, an ordinary English speaker\nwould say that an over-the-counter merchant \u201csells\u201d the item to the\nperson who pays for and takes possession of it, not the individual to\nwhom that person later transfers the item.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Nor does the case stand, as\nthe majority believes, for \u201ca substance-over-form ap-\nproach,\u201d ante, at 14. We said the term \u201cacquisition\u201d was\n\u201c \u2018aimed at providing maximum coverage,\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting\n415 U.

Giving the text its plain,\nordinary meaning, Abramski, not his uncle, was that\n\u201cperson.\u201d That being so, the Government has identified no\nreason why the arrangement between Abramski and his\nuncle, both of whom were eligible to receive and possess\n6                  ABRAMSKI v.

Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). But\n\u201cno law pursues its purpose at all costs,\u201d and the \u201ctextual\nlimitations upon a law\u2019s scope\u201d are equally \u201ca part of its\n\u2018purpose.\u2019 \u201d Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 752\n(2006) (plurality opinion). The majority\u2019s purpose-based\narguments describe a statute Congress reasonably might\nhave written, but not the statute it wrote.\n   The heart of the majority\u2019s argument is its claim that\nunless Abramski\u2019s uncle is deemed the \u201cperson\u201d to whom\nthe gun was \u201cs[old],\u201d the Act\u2019s identification, background-\ncheck, and record-keeping requirements would be \u201cren-\nder[ed] meaningless.\u201d Ante, at 11. That vastly overstates\nthe consequences. Perhaps the statute would serve the\npurpose of crime prevention more effectively if the re-\nquirements at issue looked past the \u201cman at the counter\u201d\nto the person \u201cgetting, and always meant to get, the fire-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The facts of this case provide no occasion to address whether\u2014as\n\nATF maintained for many years before adopting its current position\u2014a\nmisrepresentation in response to Form 4473\u2019s \u201cactual buyer/transferee\u201d\nquestion would be \u201cmaterial to the lawfulness of the sale\u201d if the cus-\ntomer intended to transfer the gun to a person who he knew or had\nreasonable cause to believe was prohibited by the Act from receiving or\npossessing firearms. A falsehood that conceals an intention of that sort\nmay be material because a dealer who sold the gun knowing of that\nintention might be \u201cunlawfully aiding\u201d the customer\u2019s violation of\n\u00a7924(d) (and the prohibited person\u2019s violation of \u00a7924(g)).

But ensuring that the person taking\npossession of the firearm from the dealer is eligible to\nreceive and possess a firearm, and recording information\nabout that person for later reference, are by no means\nworthless functions. On the contrary, they indisputably\nadvance the purpose of crime prevention by making it\nharder for ineligible persons to acquire guns and easier for\nthe Government to locate those guns in the future; they\nsimply do not advance that purpose to the same degree as\na more exacting law might have done.\n   That the Act\u2019s focus on the \u201cman at the counter\u201d in this\nsituation does not render its requirements \u201cmeaningless\u201d\nis confirmed by the Government\u2019s concession that the Act\nhas a similar focus in many comparable situations where\nthe gun\u2019s immediate purchaser is\u2014to use the majority\u2019s\nphrase\u2014a \u201cmere condui[t]\u201d for a contemplated transfer of\nthe gun to a different person who will \u201ctake possession of,\nown, and use\u201d it.

The Government\u2019s position\n      makes no exception for situations where the gift is\n      specifically requested by the recipient (as gifts\n      sometimes are). So long as no money changes\n      hands, and no agency relationship is formed, be-\n      tween gifter and giftee, the Act is concerned only\n      with the man at the counter.\n\n   \uf0b7\t Guns Intended for Resale.

And it appears the Government\u2019s posi-\n       tion would be the same even if the man at the\n       counter purchased the gun with the intent to sell it\n       to a particular third party, so long as the two did\n       not enter into a common-law agency relationship.\n\n    \uf0b7\t Guns Intended as Raffle Prizes.

The Government\u2019s\nconcession that the statute is operating appropriately in\neach of those scenarios should cause the majority to\nreevaluate its assumptions about the type and degree of\nregulation that the statute regards as \u201cmeaningful.\u201d The\nmajority, it is clear, regards Abramski\u2019s interpretation as\ncreating a loophole in the law; but even if that were a fair\ncharacterization, why is the majority convinced that a\nstatute with so many admitted loopholes does not contain\nthis particular loophole?\n   The majority\u2019s answer to this argument is that \u201cthe\nindividual who sends a straw to a gun store to buy a fire-\narm is transacting with the dealer, in every way but the\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

That cer-\ntainly distinguishes that individual from the intended\nsubsequent donee or purchaser; so would the fact that he\nhas orange hair. But it does not establish why that indi-\nvidual, any more than the others, should be thought to be\ncovered by statutory language (the \u201cperson\u201d to whom\na dealer \u201csell[s]\u201d a gun) that does not naturally apply.\nThe only thing which can justify that leap is the false\nimperative to make the statute as effective as possible,\nrather than as effective as the language indicates Con-\ngress desired.4\n  What the scenarios described above show is that the\nstatute typically is concerned only with the man at the\ncounter, even where that man is in a practical sense a\n\u201cconduit\u201d who will promptly transfer the gun to someone\nelse. Perhaps that is because Congress wanted a rule that\nwould be easy to understand and to administer, which the\nGovernment\u2019s proposed agency test\u2014and the majority\u2019s\napparent adoption of that test sans any mention of agency\nlaw\u2014certainly is not. (When counsel for the Government\nwas pressed about hypothetical situations not gift-\nwrapped as neatly as this case, he said, frankly but un-\nhelpfully, that they would turn on the \u201cfactual question\u201d of\n\u201c[w]hether the purchase was made on behalf of someone\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority\u2019s claim that its analysis \u201cdoes not rest on mere \u2018purpose-\n\nbased arguments,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 9, n. 6, rings hollow. The majority\nsays it is relying on the principle that when a statutory provision is\n\u201cambiguous\u201d but \u201conly one of the permissible meanings produces a\nsubstantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law,\u201d we\nshould adopt that meaning. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBut even if the text at issue here were ambiguous, it is clear that the\n\u201csubstantive effect\u201d of the narrower interpretation is \u201ccompatible\nwith\u201d\u2014indeed, it is downright congenial to\u2014\u201cthe rest of \u201d the Gun\nControl Act. The majority\u2019s contrary conclusion rests, not on anything\nin the text or structure of the Act, but on the majority\u2019s guess about\nhow far Congress meant to go in pursuit of its crime-prevention\n\u201cpurpose.\u201d\n10              ABRAMSKI v.

Perhaps those whose votes\nwere needed for passage of the statute wanted a lawful\npurchaser to be able to use an agent. A statute shaped by\npolitical tradeoffs in a controversial area may appear\n\u201cimperfect\u201d from some perspectives, but \u201cour ability to\nimagine ways of redesigning the statute to advance one of\nCongress\u2019 ends does not render it irrational.\u201d Preseault v.\nICC, 494 U.

After\nCongress passed the Act in 1968, ATF\u2019s initial position\nwas that the Act did not prohibit the sale of a gun to an\neligible buyer acting on behalf of a third party (even an\nineligible one). See Hearings Before the Subcommittee To\nInvestigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Senate Committee\non the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, 118 (1975).\nA few years later, ATF modified its position and asserted\nthat the Act did not \u201cprohibit a dealer from making a sale\nto a person who is actually purchasing the firearm for\nanother person\u201d unless the other person was \u201cprohibited\nfrom receiving or possessing a firearm,\u201d in which case the\ndealer could be guilty of \u201cunlawfully aiding the prohibited\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Ante, at 22. But the\nfact that the agency charged with enforcing the Act read\nit, over a period of roughly 25 years, not to apply to the\ntype of conduct at issue here is powerful evidence that\ninterpreting the Act in that way is natural and reasonable\nand does not make its requirements \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\n                              C\n    Even if the statute were wrongly thought to be ambigu-\nous on this point, the rule of lenity would defeat the Gov-\nernment\u2019s construction. It is a \u201cfamiliar principle\u201d that\n\u201c \u2018ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes\nshould be resolved in favor of lenity.\u2019 \u201d Skilling v. United\nStates, 561 U.

It is especially contrary to sound practice\nto give this criminal statute a meaning that the Govern-\nment itself rejected for years.\n    The majority does not mention the rule of lenity apart\nfrom a footnote, ante, at 18, n. 10, responding to this dis-\n12                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsent. The footnote concedes that \u201cthe text creates some\nambiguity\u201d but says that \u201ccontext, structure, history, and\npurpose resolve it.\u201d Ibid. But for the reasons given above,\ncontext and structure do not support the majority\u2019s inter-\npretation, history refutes it by showing that the Govern-\nment itself interpreted the statute more leniently for\nmany years, and \u201cpurpose\u201d supports it only if one imputes\nto the statute a crime-fighting purpose broader than the\ntext discloses (a practice that would nullify the rule of\nlenity in all cases). See Part I\u2013B, supra.5 If lenity has no\nrole to play in a clear case such as this one, we ought to\nstop pretending it is a genuine part of our jurisprudence.\n  Contrary to the majority\u2019s miserly approach, the rule of\nlenity applies whenever, after all legitimate tools of inter-\npretation have been exhausted, \u201ca reasonable doubt per-\nsists\u201d regarding whether Congress has made the defend-\nant\u2019s conduct a federal crime, Moskal v. United States, 498\nU. S. 103, 108 (1990)\u2014in other words, whenever those\ntools do not decisively dispel the statute\u2019s ambiguity.\nSkilling, supra, at 410; see, e.g., Scheidler v. National\nOrganization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393, 409 (2003);\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000); Cran-\ndon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 158 (1990). \u201c[W]here\ntext, structure, and history fail to establish that the Gov-\nernment\u2019s position is unambiguously correct . . . we apply\nthe rule of lenity and resolve the ambiguity in [the de-\nfendant]\u2019s favor.\u201d United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S.\n39, 54 (1994). It cannot honestly be said that the text,\nstructure, and history of the Gun Control Act establish as\n\u201cunambiguously correct\u201d that the Act makes Abramski\u2019s\nconduct a federal crime.\n  By refusing to apply lenity here, the majority turns its\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority is thus entirely wrong to charge that I would apply the\n\nrule of lenity \u201cbecause the statute\u2019s text, taken alone, permits a nar-\nrower construction,\u201d ante, at 18, n. 10.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Wiltberger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95 (1820)\n(Marshall, C. J.); see, e.g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\non the Laws of England 88 (1765) (\u201cPenal statutes must be\nconstrued strictly\u201d). As Chief Justice Marshall wrote, the\nrule is \u201cfounded on the tenderness of the law for the rights\nof individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of\npunishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial\ndepartment.\u201d Wiltberger, supra, at 95. It forbids a court\nto criminalize an act simply because the court deems that\nact \u201cof equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those\nwhich are enumerated.\u201d Id., at 96. Today\u2019s majority\ndisregards that foundational principle.\n                   II. Section 924(a)(1)(A)\n   Under \u00a7924(a)(1)(A), it is a crime to make a \u201cfalse\nstatement . . . with respect to the information required by\nthis chapter to be kept in the records of \u201d a federally li-\ncensed gun dealer (emphasis added). \u201c[T]his chapter\u201d\nrefers to chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code,\nwhich contains the Gun Control Act. \u00a7\u00a7921\u2013931.\n   The question Abramski answered falsely was whether\nhe was buying the gun for someone else. Did the Act itself\nrequire the dealer to record this information? It did not; it\nsimply required him to record \u201cthe name, age, and place of\nresidence\u201d of the \u201cperson\u201d to whom the firearm was \u201cs[old]\nor deliver[ed].\u201d \u00a7922(b)(5). As explained above, that \u201cper-\nson\u201d was Abramski, not his uncle. See Part I, supra.\n   But, the majority says, the Act also directs dealers to\n\u201c \u2018maintain such records . . . as the Attorney General may\nby regulations prescribe.\u2019 \u201d        Ante, at 22 (quoting\n\u00a7923(g)(1)(A)). So did a regulation require this infor-\nmation to be recorded? Again, no. The relevant regulation\nprovides that a dealer shall\n    \u201cobtain a Form 4473 from the transferee showing the\n14               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n     transferee\u2019s name, sex, residence address (including\n     county or similar political subdivision), date and place\n     of birth; height, weight and race of the transferee; the\n     transferee\u2019s country of citizenship; the transferee\u2019s\n     INS-issued alien number or admission number; the\n     transferee\u2019s State of residence; and certification by the\n     transferee that the transferee is not prohibited by the\n     Act from transporting or shipping a firearm in inter-\n     state or foreign commerce or receiving a firearm\n     which has been shipped or transported in interstate or\n     foreign commerce or possessing a firearm in or affect-\n     ing commerce.\u201d 27 CFR \u00a7478.124(c)(1) (2014).\nThe long list of information that this regulation requires\nto be kept in the dealer\u2019s records does not include whether\nthe transferee is buying the gun for an eligible third party.\n   But wait! the majority says: Another provision of the\nregulation requires a dealer to \u201c \u2018retain . . . as part of [its]\nrequired records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course\nof \u2019 \u201d selling or disposing of a firearm. Ante, at 23 (quoting\n27 CFR \u00a7478.124(a)). Therefore, according to the majority,\nany \u201cfalse answer on that Form\u201d\u2014even an answer to a\nquestion that is not among those enumerated in the regu-\nlation\u2014necessarily \u201cpertains to information a dealer is\nstatutorily required to maintain.\u201d Ante, at 23.\n   That carries the text of the statute a bridge too far. On\nthe majority\u2019s view, if the bureaucrats responsible for\ncreating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer\u2019s favor-\nite color, a false response would be a federal crime. That\nis not what the statute says. The statute punishes mis-\nstatements \u201cwith respect to information required to be\nkept,\u201d \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added), not with respect to\n\u201cinformation contained in forms required to be kept.\u201d\nBecause neither the Act nor any regulation requires a\ndealer to keep a record of whether a customer is purchas-\ning a gun for himself or for an eligible third party, that\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     15\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nquestion had no place on Form 4473\u2014any more than\nwould the question whether the customer was purchasing\nthe gun as a gift for a particular individual and, if so, who\nthat individual was. And the statute no more criminalizes\na false answer to an ultra vires question on Form 4473\nthan it criminalizes the purchaser\u2019s volunteering of a false\ne-mail address on that form. Information regarding\nAbramski\u2019s status as a \u201cstraw purchaser\u201d was not \u201cinfor-\nmation required to be kept,\u201d and that is an end of the\nmatter. In my view, that is the best\u2014indeed, the only\nplausible\u2014interpretation of \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). But at a mini-\nmum, the statute is ambiguous, and lenity does the rest.\nSee Part I\u2013C, supra.6\n                        *     *    *\n  The Court makes it a federal crime for one lawful gun\nowner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner. Whether\nor not that is a sensible result, the statutes Congress\nenacted do not support it\u2014especially when, as is appro-\npriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes in favor of\nthe accused. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The  majority professes that it \u201cneed not, and do[es] not, opine on\u201d\nwhether it would impose liability for \u201ca false answer even to an \u2018ultra\nvires question\u2019 \u201d because, given its reasoning on Count One, the ques-\ntion at issue here was \u201cpart and parcel of the dealer\u2019s determination of\nthe (true) buyer\u2019s \u2018name, age, and place of residence,\u2019 which \u00a7922(b)(5)\nrequires the dealer to keep.\u201d Ante, at 23, n. 11. But if that is really all\nthe majority means to decide, then why bother to invoke the require-\nment that the dealer keep such records as the regulations prescribe and\nthe regulation requiring the dealer to keep Form 4473? See ante, at\n22\u201323. If the majority\u2019s ruling is as limited as it claims, it ought to cite\n\u00a7922(b)(5) and be done.\n</pre>",
