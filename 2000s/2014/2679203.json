BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 13–369.      Argued April 28, 2014—Decided June 2, 2014\nThe Patent Act requires that a patent specification “conclude with one\n  or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the\n  subject matter which the applicant regards as [the] invention.” 35\n  U. S. C. §112, ¶2. This case concerns the proper reading of the stat­\n  ute’s clarity and precision demand.\n     Assigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., the patent in dis­\n  pute (the ’753 patent) involves a heart-rate monitor used with exer­\n  cise equipment. Prior heart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were\n  often inaccurate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying\n  each heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals) because of the\n  presence of other electrical signals (electromyogram or EMG signals),\n  generated by the user’s skeletal muscles, that can impede ECG signal\n  detection. The invention claims to improve on prior art by detecting\n  and processing ECG signals in a way that filters out the EMG inter­\n  ference.\n     Claim 1 of the ’753 patent, which contains the limitations critical to\n  this dispute, refers to a “heart rate monitor for use by a user in asso­\n  ciation with exercise apparatus and/or exercise procedures.” The\n  claim “comprise[s],” among other elements, a cylindrical bar fitted\n  with a display device; “electronic circuitry including a difference am­\n  plifier”; and, on each half of the cylindrical bar, a “live” electrode and\n  a “common” electrode “mounted . . . in spaced relationship with each\n  other.”\n     Biosig filed this patent infringement suit, alleging that Nautilus,\n  Inc., without obtaining a license, sold exercise machines containing\n  Biosig’s patented technology. The District Court, after conducting a\n  hearing to determine the proper construction of the patent’s claims,\n  granted Nautilus’ motion for summary judgment on the ground that\n2          NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the claim term “in spaced relationship with each other” failed §112,\n    ¶2’s definiteness requirement. The Federal Circuit reversed and re­\n    manded, concluding that a patent claim passes the §112, ¶2 thresh­\n    old so long as the claim is “amenable to construction,” and the claim,\n    as construed, is not “insolubly ambiguous.” Under that standard, the\n    court determined, the ’753 patent survived indefiniteness review.\nHeld:\n    1. A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of\n the patent’s specification and prosecution history, fail to inform, with\n reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the\n invention. The parties agree that definiteness is to be evaluated from\n the perspective of a person skilled in the relevant art, that claims are\n to be read in light of the patent’s specification and prosecution histo­\n ry, and that definiteness is to be measured as of the time of the pa­\n tent application. The parties disagree as to how much imprecision\n §112, ¶2 tolerates.\n    Section 112’s definiteness requirement must take into account the\n inherent limitations of language. See Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzo-\n ku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 731. On the one hand, some\n modicum of uncertainty is the “price of ensuring the appropriate in­\n centives for innovation,” id., at 732; and patents are “not addressed to\n lawyers, or even to the public generally,” but to those skilled in the\n relevant art, Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U. S. 403,\n 437. At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to afford\n clear notice of what is claimed, thereby “ ‘appris[ing] the public of\n what is still open to them,’ ” Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,\n 517 U. S. 370, 373, in a manner that avoids “[a] zone of uncertainty\n which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at the risk of\n infringement claims,” United Carbon Co. v. Binney & Smith Co., 317\n U. S. 228, 236. The standard adopted here mandates clarity, while\n recognizing that absolute precision is unattainable. It also accords\n with opinions of this Court stating that “the certainty which the law\n requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable, having regard\n to their subject-matter.” Minerals Separation, Ltd. v. Hyde, 242 U. S.\n 261, 270. Pp. 8–11.\n    2. The Federal Circuit’s standard, which tolerates some ambiguous\n claims but not others, does not satisfy the statute’s definiteness re­\n quirement. The Court of Appeals inquired whether the ’753 patent’s\n claims were “amenable to construction” or “insolubly ambiguous,” but\n such formulations lack the precision §112, ¶2 demands. To tolerate\n imprecision just short of that rendering a claim “insolubly ambigu­\n ous” would diminish the definiteness requirement’s public-notice\n function and foster the innovation-discouraging “zone of uncertainty,”\n United Carbon, 317 U. S., at 236, against which this Court has\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  warned. While some of the Federal Circuit’s fuller explications of the\n  term “insolubly ambiguous” may come closer to tracking the statuto­\n  ry prescription, this Court must ensure that the Federal Circuit’s test\n  is at least “probative of the essential inquiry.” Warner-Jenkinson Co.\n  v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17, 40. The expressions “in­\n  solubly ambiguous” and “amenable to construction,” which permeate\n  the Federal Circuit’s recent decisions concerning §112, ¶2, fall short\n  in this regard and can leave courts and the patent bar at sea without\n  a reliable compass. Pp. 11–13.\n     3. This Court, as “a court of review, not of first view,” Cutter v. Wil-\n  kinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7, follows its ordinary practice of re­\n  manding so that the Federal Circuit can reconsider, under the proper\n  standard, whether the relevant claims in the ’753 patent are suffi­\n  ciently definite, see, e.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 515.\n  Pp. 13–14.\n715 F. 3d 891, vacated and remanded.\n\n  GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 572 U.

S. C. §112, ¶2\n(2006 ed.) (emphasis added). This case, involving a heart­\nrate monitor used with exercise equipment, concerns the\nproper reading of the statute’s clarity and precision de­\nmand. According to the Federal Circuit, a patent claim\npasses the §112, ¶2 threshold so long as the claim is\n“amenable to construction,” and the claim, as construed, is\nnot “insolubly ambiguous.” 715 F. 3d 891, 898–899 (2013).\nWe conclude that the Federal Circuit’s formulation, which\ntolerates some ambiguous claims but not others, does not\nsatisfy the statute’s definiteness requirement. In place of\nthe “insolubly ambiguous” standard, we hold that a patent\nis invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of\nthe specification delineating the patent, and the prosecu­\ntion history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty,\nthose skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\nExpressing no opinion on the validity of the patent-in-suit,\n2       NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe remand, instructing the Federal Circuit to decide the\ncase employing the standard we have prescribed.\n                                I\n   Authorized by the Constitution “[t]o promote the Pro­\ngress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited\nTimes to . . . Inventors the exclusive Right to their . . .\nDiscoveries,” Art. I, §8, cl. 8, Congress has enacted patent\nlaws rewarding inventors with a limited monopoly.\n“Th[at] monopoly is a property right,” and “like any prop­\nerty right, its boundaries should be clear.” Festo Corp. v.\nShoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 730\n(2002). See also Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,\n517 U. S. 370, 373 (1996) (“It has long been understood\nthat a patent must describe the exact scope of an inven­\ntion and its manufacture . . . .”). Thus, when Congress\nenacted the first Patent Act in 1790, it directed that pa­\ntent grantees file a written specification “containing a\ndescription . . . of the thing or things . . . invented or dis­\ncovered,” which “shall be so particular” as to “distinguish\nthe invention or discovery from other things before known\nand used.” Act of Apr. 10, 1790, §2, 1 Stat. 110.\n   The patent laws have retained this requirement of\ndefiniteness even as the focus of patent construction has\nshifted. Under early patent practice in the United States,\nwe have recounted, it was the written specification that\n“represented the key to the patent.” Markman, 517 U. S.,\nat 379. Eventually, however, patent applicants began to\nset out the invention’s scope in a separate section known\nas the “claim.” See generally 1 R. Moy, Walker on Patents\n§4.2, pp. 4–17 to 4–20 (4th ed. 2012). The Patent Act of\n1870 expressly conditioned the receipt of a patent on the\ninventor’s inclusion of one or more such claims, described\nwith particularity and distinctness. See Act of July 8,\n1870, §26, 16 Stat. 201 (to obtain a patent, the inventor\nmust “particularly point out and distinctly claim the part,\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

Section 112 of the Patent Act of 1952,\napplicable to this case, requires the patent applicant to\nconclude the specification with “one or more claims partic­\nularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject\nmatter which the applicant regards as his invention.” 35\nU. S. C. §112, ¶2 (2006 ed.). A lack of definiteness renders\ninvalid “the patent or any claim in suit.” §282, ¶2(3).1\n                            II\n\n                            A\n\n  The patent in dispute, U. S. Patent No. 5,337,753 (’753\npatent), issued to Dr. Gregory Lekhtman in 1994 and\nassigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., concerns\na heart-rate monitor for use during exercise. Previous\nheart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were often inaccu­\nrate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying\neach heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals). The\ninaccuracy was caused by electrical signals of a different\nsort, known as electromyogram or EMG signals, generated\nby an exerciser’s skeletal muscles when, for example, she\nmoves her arm, or grips an exercise monitor with her\nhand. These EMG signals can “mask” ECG signals and\nthereby impede their detection. App. 52, 147.\n——————\n  1 In the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L. 112–29, 125 Stat.\n284, enacted in 2011, Congress amended several parts of the Patent\nAct. Those amendments modified §§112 and 282 in minor respects not\npertinent here. In any event, the amended versions of those provisions\nare inapplicable to patent applications filed before September 16, 2012,\nand proceedings commenced before September 16, 2011. See §§4(e),\n15(c), 20(l), 125 Stat. 297, 328, 335, notes following 35 U. S. C. §§2, 111,\n119. Here, the application for the patent-in-suit was filed in 1992, and\nthe relevant court proceedings were initiated in 2010. Accordingly, this\nopinion’s citations to the Patent Act refer to the 2006 edition of the\nUnited States Code.\n4         NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Dr. Lekhtman’s invention claims to improve on prior art\nby eliminating that impediment. The invention focuses on\na key difference between EMG and ECG waveforms: while\nECG signals detected from a user’s left hand have a polar­\nity opposite to that of the signals detected from her right\nhand,2 EMG signals from each hand have the same polar-\nity. The patented device works by measuring equalized\nEMG signals detected at each hand and then using cir­\ncuitry to subtract the identical EMG signals from each\nother, thus filtering out the EMG interference.\n   As relevant here, the ’753 patent describes a heart-rate\nmonitor contained in a hollow cylindrical bar that a user\ngrips with both hands, such that each hand comes into\ncontact with two electrodes, one “live” and one “common.”\nThe device is illustrated in figure 1 of the patent, id., at\n41, reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion.\n   Claim 1 of the ’753 patent, which contains the limita­\ntions critical to this dispute, refers to a “heart rate monitor\nfor use by a user in association with exercise apparatus\nand/or exercise procedures.” Id., at 61. The claim “com­\nprise[s],” among other elements, an “elongate member”\n(cylindrical bar) with a display device; “electronic circuitry\nincluding a difference amplifier”; and, on each half of the\ncylindrical bar, a live electrode and a common electrode\n“mounted . . . in spaced relationship with each other.”\nIbid.3 The claim sets forth additional elements, including\nthat the cylindrical bar is to be held in such a way that\neach of the user’s hands “contact[s]” both electrodes on\neach side of the bar. Id., at 62. Further, the EMG signals\ndetected by the two electrode pairs are to be “of substan­\n——————\n  2 This difference in polarity occurs because the heart is not aligned\n\nvertically in relation to the center of the body; the organ tilts leftward\nfrom apex to bottom.

Ibid.\n                              B\n  The dispute between the parties arose in the 1990’s,\nwhen Biosig allegedly disclosed the patented technology to\nStairMaster Sports Medical Products, Inc. According to\nBiosig, StairMaster, without ever obtaining a license, sold\nexercise machines that included Biosig’s patented technol­\nogy, and petitioner Nautilus, Inc., continued to do so after\nacquiring the StairMaster brand. In 2004, based on these\nallegations, Biosig brought a patent infringement suit\nagainst Nautilus in the U. S. District Court for the South­\nern District of New York.\n  With Biosig’s lawsuit launched, Nautilus asked the U. S.\nPatent and Trademark Office (PTO) to reexamine the ’753\npatent.     The reexamination proceedings centered on\nwhether the patent was anticipated or rendered obvious\nby prior art—principally, a patent issued in 1984 to an\ninventor named Fujisaki, which similarly disclosed a\nheart-rate monitor using two pairs of electrodes and a\ndifference amplifier. Endeavoring to distinguish the ’753\npatent from prior art, Biosig submitted a declaration from\nDr. Lekhtman. The declaration attested, among other\nthings, that the ’753 patent sufficiently informed a person\nskilled in the art how to configure the detecting electrodes\nso as “to produce equal EMG [signals] from the left and\nright hands.” Id., at 160. Although the electrodes’ design\nvariables—including spacing, shape, size, and material—\ncannot be standardized across all exercise machines, Dr.\nLekhtman explained, a skilled artisan could undertake a\n“trial and error” process of equalization. This would entail\nexperimentation with different electrode configurations in\norder to optimize EMG signal cancellation. Id., at 155–\n6        NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n156, 158.4 In 2010, the PTO issued a determination con­\nfirming the patentability of the ’753 patent’s claims.\n   Biosig thereafter reinstituted its infringement suit,\nwhich the parties had voluntarily dismissed without prej­\nudice while PTO reexamination was underway. In 2011,\nthe District Court conducted a hearing to determine the\nproper construction of the patent’s claims, see Markman v.\nWestview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370 (1996) (claim\nconstruction is a matter of law reserved for court decision),\nincluding the claim term “in spaced relationship with each\nother.” According to Biosig, that “spaced relationship”\nreferred to the distance between the live electrode and the\ncommon electrode in each electrode pair. Nautilus, seizing\non Biosig’s submissions to the PTO during the reexamina­\ntion, maintained that the “spaced relationship” must be a\ndistance “greater than the width of each electrode.” App.\n245. The District Court ultimately construed the term to\nmean “there is a defined relationship between the live\nelectrode and the common electrode on one side of the\ncylindrical bar and the same or a different defined rela­\ntionship between the live electrode and the common elec­\ntrode on the other side of the cylindrical bar,” without any\nreference to the electrodes’ width. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n43a–44a.\n   Nautilus moved for summary judgment, arguing that\nthe term “spaced relationship,” as construed, was indefi­\nnite under §112, ¶2. The District Court granted the mo­\ntion. Those words, the District Court concluded, “did not\ntell [the court] or anyone what precisely the space should\n——————\n   4 Dr. Lekhtman’s declaration also referred to an expert report pre­\n\npared by Dr. Henrietta Galiana, Chair of the Department of Biomedical\nEngineering at McGill University, for use in the infringement litiga­\ntion. That report described how Dr. Galiana’s laboratory technician,\nequipped with a wooden dowel, wire, metal foil, glue, electrical tape,\nand the drawings from the ’753 patent, was able in two hours to build a\nmonitor that “worked just as described in the . . . patent.” Id., at 226.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Id., at 72a.\n   The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded. A claim is\nindefinite, the majority opinion stated, “only when it is\n‘not amenable to construction’ or ‘insolubly ambiguous.’ ”\n715 F. 3d 891, 898 (2013) (quoting Datamize, LLC v.\nPlumtree Software, Inc., 417 F. 3d 1342, 1347 (CA Fed.\n2005)). Under that standard, the majority determined, the\n’753 patent survived indefiniteness review. Considering\nfirst the “intrinsic evidence”—i.e., the claim language, the\nspecification, and the prosecution history—the majority\ndiscerned “certain inherent parameters of the claimed\napparatus, which to a skilled artisan may be sufficient to\nunderstand the metes and bounds of ‘spaced relation­\nship.’ ” 715 F. 3d, at 899. These sources of meaning, the\nmajority explained, make plain that the distance separat­\ning the live and common electrodes on each half of the bar\n“cannot be greater than the width of a user’s hands”; that\nis so “because claim 1 requires the live and common elec­\ntrodes to independently detect electrical signals at two\ndistinct points of a hand.” Ibid. Furthermore, the major­\nity noted, the intrinsic evidence teaches that this distance\ncannot be “infinitesimally small, effectively merging the\nlive and common electrodes into a single electrode with\none detection point.” Ibid. The claim’s functional provi­\nsions, the majority went on to observe, shed additional\nlight on the meaning of “spaced relationship.” Surveying\nthe record before the PTO on reexamination, the majority\nconcluded that a skilled artisan would know that she could\nattain the indicated functions of equalizing and removing\nEMG signals by adjusting design variables, including\nspacing.\n   In a concurring opinion, Judge Schall reached the ma­\njority’s result employing “a more limited analysis.” Id., at\n905. Judge Schall accepted the majority’s recitation of the\ndefiniteness standard, under which claims amenable to\n8       NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconstruction are nonetheless indefinite when “the con­\nstruction remains insolubly ambiguous.” Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The District Court’s construc­\ntion of “spaced relationship,” Judge Schall maintained,\nwas sufficiently clear: the term means “there is a fixed\nspatial relationship between the live electrode and the\ncommon electrode” on each side of the cylindrical bar.\nIbid. Judge Schall agreed with the majority that the\nintrinsic evidence discloses inherent limits of that spacing.\nBut, unlike the majority, Judge Schall did not “presum[e]\na functional linkage between the ‘spaced relationship’\nlimitation and the removal of EMG signals.” Id., at 906.\nOther limitations of the claim, in his view, and not the\n“ ‘spaced relationship’ limitation itself,” “included a func­\ntional requirement to remove EMG signals.” Ibid.\n    We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nvacate and remand.\n                              III\n                               A\n   Although the parties here disagree on the dispositive\nquestion—does the ’753 patent withstand definiteness\nscrutiny—they are in accord on several aspects of the\n§112, ¶2 inquiry. First, definiteness is to be evaluated\nfrom the perspective of someone skilled in the relevant art.\nSee, e.g., General Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304\nU. S. 364, 371 (1938). See also §112, ¶1 (patent’s specifi­\ncation “shall contain a written description of the invention,\nand of the manner and process of making and using it, in\nsuch full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any\nperson skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which\nit is most nearly connected, to make and use the same”\n(emphasis added)). Second, in assessing definiteness,\nclaims are to be read in light of the patent’s specification\nand prosecution history. See, e.g., United States v. Adams,\n383 U. S. 39, 48–49 (1966) (specification); Festo Corp. v.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

Third, “[d]efiniteness is\nmeasured from the viewpoint of a person skilled in [the]\nart at the time the patent was filed.” Brief for Respondent\n55 (emphasis added). See generally Sarnoff & Manzo, An\nIntroduction to, Premises of, and Problems With Patent\nClaim Construction, in Patent Claim Construction in the\nFederal Circuit 9 (E. Manzo ed. 2014) (“Patent claims . . .\nshould be construed from an objective perspective of a\n[skilled artisan], based on what the applicant actually\nclaimed, disclosed, and stated during the application\nprocess.”).\n   The parties differ, however, in their articulations of just\nhow much imprecision §112, ¶2 tolerates. In Nautilus’\nview, a patent is invalid when a claim is “ambiguous, such\nthat readers could reasonably interpret the claim’s scope\ndifferently.” Brief for Petitioner 37. Biosig and the Solici­\ntor General would require only that the patent provide\nreasonable notice of the scope of the claimed invention.\nSee Brief for Respondent 18; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 9–10.\n   Section 112, we have said, entails a “delicate balance.”\nFesto, 535 U. S., at 731. On the one hand, the definiteness\nrequirement must take into account the inherent limita­\ntions of language. See ibid. Some modicum of uncertainty,\nthe Court has recognized, is the “price of ensuring the\nappropriate incentives for innovation.” Id., at 732. One\nmust bear in mind, moreover, that patents are “not ad­\ndressed to lawyers, or even to the public generally,” but\nrather to those skilled in the relevant art. Carnegie Steel\nCo. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U. S. 403, 437 (1902) (also\nstating that “any description which is sufficient to apprise\n[steel manufacturers] in the language of the art of the\ndefinite feature of the invention, and to serve as a warning\nto others of what the patent claims as a monopoly, is\nsufficiently definite to sustain the patent”).5\n——————\n 5 See   also Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co., 261\n10        NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to\nafford clear notice of what is claimed, thereby “ ‘appris[ing]\nthe public of what is still open to them.’ ” Markman, 517\nU. S., at 373 (quoting McClain v. Ortmayer, 141 U. S. 419,\n424 (1891)).6 Otherwise there would be “[a] zone of uncer­\ntainty which enterprise and experimentation may enter\nonly at the risk of infringement claims.” United Carbon\nCo. v. Binney & Smith Co., 317 U. S. 228, 236 (1942). And\nabsent a meaningful definiteness check, we are told, pa­\ntent applicants face powerful incentives to inject ambigu-\nity into their claims.

Cognizant of the competing concerns,\nwe read §112, ¶2 to require that a patent’s claims, viewed\nin light of the specification and prosecution history, inform\nthose skilled in the art about the scope of the invention\nwith reasonable certainty.

It cannot be\nsufficient that a court can ascribe some meaning to a\npatent’s claims; the definiteness inquiry trains on the\nunderstanding of a skilled artisan at the time of the pa­\ntent application, not that of a court viewing matters\npost hoc. To tolerate imprecision just short of that render­\ning a claim “insolubly ambiguous” would diminish the\ndefiniteness requirement’s public-notice function and\nfoster the innovation-discouraging “zone of uncertainty,”\nUnited Carbon, 317 U. S., at 236, against which this Court\nhas warned.\n   Appreciating that “terms like ‘insolubly ambiguous’ may\nnot be felicitous,” Brief for Respondent 34, Biosig argues\nthe phrase is a shorthand label for a more probing inquiry\nthat the Federal Circuit applies in practice. The Federal\nCircuit’s fuller explications of the term “insolubly ambigu­\nous,” we recognize, may come closer to tracking the statu­\ntory prescription. See, e.g., 715 F. 3d, at 898 (case below)\n(“[I]f reasonable efforts at claim construction result in a\ndefinition that does not provide sufficient particularity\nand clarity to inform skilled artisans of the bounds of the\nclaim, the claim is insolubly ambiguous and invalid for\nindefiniteness.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). But\nalthough this Court does not “micromanag[e] the Federal\nCircuit’s particular word choice” in applying patent-law\ndoctrines, we must ensure that the Federal Circuit’s test is\nat least “probative of the essential inquiry.” Warner-\nJenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17,\n40 (1997). Falling short in that regard, the expressions\n“insolubly ambiguous” and “amenable to construction”\npermeate the Federal Circuit’s recent decisions concerning\n§112, ¶2’s requirement.9 We agree with Nautilus and its\n——————\nambiguity’ required to invalidate the claim”).\n  9 E.g., Hearing Components, Inc. v.

S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 1) (invalidity defenses\nmust be proved by “clear and convincing evidence”). As the parties\nappear to agree, however, this presumption of validity does not alter\nthe degree of clarity that §112, ¶2 demands from patent applicants; to\nthe contrary, it incorporates that definiteness requirement by refer­\nence. See §282, ¶2(3) (defenses to infringement actions include\n“[i]nvalidity of the patent or any claim in suit for failure to comply with\n. . . any requirement of [§112]”).\n    The parties nonetheless dispute whether factual findings subsidiary\nto the ultimate issue of definiteness trigger the clear-and-convincing­\nevidence standard and, relatedly, whether deference is due to the PTO’s\nresolution of disputed issues of fact. We leave these questions for\nanother day. The court below treated definiteness as “a legal issue\n[the] court reviews without deference,” 715 F. 3d, at 897, and Biosig has\nnot called our attention to any contested factual matter—or PTO\ndetermination thereof—pertinent to its infringement claims.\n14       NAUTILUS, INC. v.

Argued April 28, 2014—Decided June 2, 2014\nThe Patent Act requires that a patent specification “conclude with one\n  or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the\n  subject matter which the applicant regards as [the] invention.” 35\n  U. S. C. §112, ¶2. This case concerns the proper reading of the stat­\n  ute’s clarity and precision demand.\n     Assigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., the patent in dis­\n  pute (the ’753 patent) involves a heart-rate monitor used with exer­\n  cise equipment. Prior heart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were\n  often inaccurate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying\n  each heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals) because of the\n  presence of other electrical signals (electromyogram or EMG signals),\n  generated by the user’s skeletal muscles, that can impede ECG signal\n  detection. The invention claims to improve on prior art by detecting\n  and processing ECG signals in a way that filters out the EMG inter­\n  ference.\n     Claim 1 of the ’753 patent, which contains the limitations critical to\n  this dispute, refers to a “heart rate monitor for use by a user in asso­\n  ciation with exercise apparatus and/or exercise procedures.” The\n  claim “comprise[s],” among other elements, a cylindrical bar fitted\n  with a display device; “electronic circuitry including a difference am­\n  plifier”; and, on each half of the cylindrical bar, a “live” electrode and\n  a “common” electrode “mounted . . . in spaced relationship with each\n  other.”\n     Biosig filed this patent infringement suit, alleging that Nautilus,\n  Inc., without obtaining a license, sold exercise machines containing\n  Biosig’s patented technology. The District Court, after conducting a\n  hearing to determine the proper construction of the patent’s claims,\n  granted Nautilus’ motion for summary judgment on the ground that\n2          NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the claim term “in spaced relationship with each other” failed §112,\n    ¶2’s definiteness requirement. The Federal Circuit reversed and re­\n    manded, concluding that a patent claim passes the §112, ¶2 thresh­\n    old so long as the claim is “amenable to construction,” and the claim,\n    as construed, is not “insolubly ambiguous.” Under that standard, the\n    court determined, the ’753 patent survived indefiniteness review.\nHeld:\n    1. A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of\n the patent’s specification and prosecution history, fail to inform, with\n reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the\n invention. The parties agree that definiteness is to be evaluated from\n the perspective of a person skilled in the relevant art, that claims are\n to be read in light of the patent’s specification and prosecution histo­\n ry, and that definiteness is to be measured as of the time of the pa­\n tent application. The parties disagree as to how much imprecision\n §112, ¶2 tolerates.\n    Section 112’s definiteness requirement must take into account the\n inherent limitations of language. See Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzo-\n ku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 731. On the one hand, some\n modicum of uncertainty is the “price of ensuring the appropriate in­\n centives for innovation,” id., at 732; and patents are “not addressed to\n lawyers, or even to the public generally,” but to those skilled in the\n relevant art, Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U. S. 403,\n 437. At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to afford\n clear notice of what is claimed, thereby “ ‘appris[ing] the public of\n what is still open to them,’ ” Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,\n 517 U. S. 370, 373, in a manner that avoids “[a] zone of uncertainty\n which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at the risk of\n infringement claims,” United Carbon Co. v. Binney & Smith Co., 317\n U. S. 228, 236. The standard adopted here mandates clarity, while\n recognizing that absolute precision is unattainable. It also accords\n with opinions of this Court stating that “the certainty which the law\n requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable, having regard\n to their subject-matter.” Minerals Separation, Ltd. v. Hyde, 242 U. S.\n 261, 270. Pp. 8–11.\n    2. The Federal Circuit’s standard, which tolerates some ambiguous\n claims but not others, does not satisfy the statute’s definiteness re­\n quirement. The Court of Appeals inquired whether the ’753 patent’s\n claims were “amenable to construction” or “insolubly ambiguous,” but\n such formulations lack the precision §112, ¶2 demands. To tolerate\n imprecision just short of that rendering a claim “insolubly ambigu­\n ous” would diminish the definiteness requirement’s public-notice\n function and foster the innovation-discouraging “zone of uncertainty,”\n United Carbon, 317 U. S., at 236, against which this Court has\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  warned. While some of the Federal Circuit’s fuller explications of the\n  term “insolubly ambiguous” may come closer to tracking the statuto­\n  ry prescription, this Court must ensure that the Federal Circuit’s test\n  is at least “probative of the essential inquiry.” Warner-Jenkinson Co.\n  v.

The expressions “in­\n  solubly ambiguous” and “amenable to construction,” which permeate\n  the Federal Circuit’s recent decisions concerning §112, ¶2, fall short\n  in this regard and can leave courts and the patent bar at sea without\n  a reliable compass.

Thus, when Congress\nenacted the first Patent Act in 1790, it directed that pa­\ntent grantees file a written specification “containing a\ndescription . . . of the thing or things . . . invented or dis­\ncovered,” which “shall be so particular” as to “distinguish\nthe invention or discovery from other things before known\nand used.” Act of Apr. 10, 1790, §2, 1 Stat. 110.\n   The patent laws have retained this requirement of\ndefiniteness even as the focus of patent construction has\nshifted. Under early patent practice in the United States,\nwe have recounted, it was the written specification that\n“represented the key to the patent.” Markman, 517 U. S.,\nat 379. Eventually, however, patent applicants began to\nset out the invention’s scope in a separate section known\nas the “claim.” See generally 1 R. Moy, Walker on Patents\n§4.2, pp. 4–17 to 4–20 (4th ed. 2012). The Patent Act of\n1870 expressly conditioned the receipt of a patent on the\ninventor’s inclusion of one or more such claims, described\nwith particularity and distinctness. See Act of July 8,\n1870, §26, 16 Stat. 201 (to obtain a patent, the inventor\nmust “particularly point out and distinctly claim the part,\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

Section 112 of the Patent Act of 1952,\napplicable to this case, requires the patent applicant to\nconclude the specification with “one or more claims partic­\nularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject\nmatter which the applicant regards as his invention.” 35\nU. S. C. §112, ¶2 (2006 ed.). A lack of definiteness renders\ninvalid “the patent or any claim in suit.” §282, ¶2(3).1\n                            II\n\n                            A\n\n  The patent in dispute, U. S. Patent No. 5,337,753 (’753\npatent), issued to Dr. Gregory Lekhtman in 1994 and\nassigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., concerns\na heart-rate monitor for use during exercise. Previous\nheart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were often inaccu­\nrate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying\neach heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals). The\ninaccuracy was caused by electrical signals of a different\nsort, known as electromyogram or EMG signals, generated\nby an exerciser’s skeletal muscles when, for example, she\nmoves her arm, or grips an exercise monitor with her\nhand. These EMG signals can “mask” ECG signals and\nthereby impede their detection. App. 52, 147.\n——————\n  1 In the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L. 112–29, 125 Stat.\n284, enacted in 2011, Congress amended several parts of the Patent\nAct. Those amendments modified §§112 and 282 in minor respects not\npertinent here. In any event, the amended versions of those provisions\nare inapplicable to patent applications filed before September 16, 2012,\nand proceedings commenced before September 16, 2011. See §§4(e),\n15(c), 20(l), 125 Stat. 297, 328, 335, notes following 35 U. S. C. §§2, 111,\n119. Here, the application for the patent-in-suit was filed in 1992, and\nthe relevant court proceedings were initiated in 2010. Accordingly, this\nopinion’s citations to the Patent Act refer to the 2006 edition of the\nUnited States Code.\n4         NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Dr. Lekhtman’s invention claims to improve on prior art\nby eliminating that impediment. The invention focuses on\na key difference between EMG and ECG waveforms: while\nECG signals detected from a user’s left hand have a polar­\nity opposite to that of the signals detected from her right\nhand,2 EMG signals from each hand have the same polar-\nity. The patented device works by measuring equalized\nEMG signals detected at each hand and then using cir­\ncuitry to subtract the identical EMG signals from each\nother, thus filtering out the EMG interference.\n   As relevant here, the ’753 patent describes a heart-rate\nmonitor contained in a hollow cylindrical bar that a user\ngrips with both hands, such that each hand comes into\ncontact with two electrodes, one “live” and one “common.”\nThe device is illustrated in figure 1 of the patent, id., at\n41, reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion.\n   Claim 1 of the ’753 patent, which contains the limita­\ntions critical to this dispute, refers to a “heart rate monitor\nfor use by a user in association with exercise apparatus\nand/or exercise procedures.” Id., at 61. The claim “com­\nprise[s],” among other elements, an “elongate member”\n(cylindrical bar) with a display device; “electronic circuitry\nincluding a difference amplifier”; and, on each half of the\ncylindrical bar, a live electrode and a common electrode\n“mounted . . . in spaced relationship with each other.”\nIbid.3 The claim sets forth additional elements, including\nthat the cylindrical bar is to be held in such a way that\neach of the user’s hands “contact[s]” both electrodes on\neach side of the bar. Id., at 62. Further, the EMG signals\ndetected by the two electrode pairs are to be “of substan­\n——————\n  2 This difference in polarity occurs because the heart is not aligned\n\nvertically in relation to the center of the body; the organ tilts leftward\nfrom apex to bottom.

Ibid.\n                              B\n  The dispute between the parties arose in the 1990’s,\nwhen Biosig allegedly disclosed the patented technology to\nStairMaster Sports Medical Products, Inc. According to\nBiosig, StairMaster, without ever obtaining a license, sold\nexercise machines that included Biosig’s patented technol­\nogy, and petitioner Nautilus, Inc., continued to do so after\nacquiring the StairMaster brand. In 2004, based on these\nallegations, Biosig brought a patent infringement suit\nagainst Nautilus in the U. S. District Court for the South­\nern District of New York.\n  With Biosig’s lawsuit launched, Nautilus asked the U. S.\nPatent and Trademark Office (PTO) to reexamine the ’753\npatent.     The reexamination proceedings centered on\nwhether the patent was anticipated or rendered obvious\nby prior art—principally, a patent issued in 1984 to an\ninventor named Fujisaki, which similarly disclosed a\nheart-rate monitor using two pairs of electrodes and a\ndifference amplifier. Endeavoring to distinguish the ’753\npatent from prior art, Biosig submitted a declaration from\nDr. Lekhtman. The declaration attested, among other\nthings, that the ’753 patent sufficiently informed a person\nskilled in the art how to configure the detecting electrodes\nso as “to produce equal EMG [signals] from the left and\nright hands.” Id., at 160. Although the electrodes’ design\nvariables—including spacing, shape, size, and material—\ncannot be standardized across all exercise machines, Dr.\nLekhtman explained, a skilled artisan could undertake a\n“trial and error” process of equalization. This would entail\nexperimentation with different electrode configurations in\norder to optimize EMG signal cancellation. Id., at 155–\n6        NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n156, 158.4 In 2010, the PTO issued a determination con­\nfirming the patentability of the ’753 patent’s claims.\n   Biosig thereafter reinstituted its infringement suit,\nwhich the parties had voluntarily dismissed without prej­\nudice while PTO reexamination was underway. In 2011,\nthe District Court conducted a hearing to determine the\nproper construction of the patent’s claims, see Markman v.\nWestview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370 (1996) (claim\nconstruction is a matter of law reserved for court decision),\nincluding the claim term “in spaced relationship with each\nother.” According to Biosig, that “spaced relationship”\nreferred to the distance between the live electrode and the\ncommon electrode in each electrode pair. Nautilus, seizing\non Biosig’s submissions to the PTO during the reexamina­\ntion, maintained that the “spaced relationship” must be a\ndistance “greater than the width of each electrode.” App.\n245. The District Court ultimately construed the term to\nmean “there is a defined relationship between the live\nelectrode and the common electrode on one side of the\ncylindrical bar and the same or a different defined rela­\ntionship between the live electrode and the common elec­\ntrode on the other side of the cylindrical bar,” without any\nreference to the electrodes’ width. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n43a–44a.\n   Nautilus moved for summary judgment, arguing that\nthe term “spaced relationship,” as construed, was indefi­\nnite under §112, ¶2. The District Court granted the mo­\ntion. Those words, the District Court concluded, “did not\ntell [the court] or anyone what precisely the space should\n——————\n   4 Dr. Lekhtman’s declaration also referred to an expert report pre­\n\npared by Dr. Henrietta Galiana, Chair of the Department of Biomedical\nEngineering at McGill University, for use in the infringement litiga­\ntion. That report described how Dr. Galiana’s laboratory technician,\nequipped with a wooden dowel, wire, metal foil, glue, electrical tape,\nand the drawings from the ’753 patent, was able in two hours to build a\nmonitor that “worked just as described in the . . . patent.” Id., at 226.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Id., at 72a.\n   The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded. A claim is\nindefinite, the majority opinion stated, “only when it is\n‘not amenable to construction’ or ‘insolubly ambiguous.’ ”\n715 F. 3d 891, 898 (2013) (quoting Datamize, LLC v.\nPlumtree Software, Inc., 417 F. 3d 1342, 1347 (CA Fed.\n2005)). Under that standard, the majority determined, the\n’753 patent survived indefiniteness review. Considering\nfirst the “intrinsic evidence”—i.e., the claim language, the\nspecification, and the prosecution history—the majority\ndiscerned “certain inherent parameters of the claimed\napparatus, which to a skilled artisan may be sufficient to\nunderstand the metes and bounds of ‘spaced relation­\nship.’ ” 715 F. 3d, at 899. These sources of meaning, the\nmajority explained, make plain that the distance separat­\ning the live and common electrodes on each half of the bar\n“cannot be greater than the width of a user’s hands”; that\nis so “because claim 1 requires the live and common elec­\ntrodes to independently detect electrical signals at two\ndistinct points of a hand.” Ibid. Furthermore, the major­\nity noted, the intrinsic evidence teaches that this distance\ncannot be “infinitesimally small, effectively merging the\nlive and common electrodes into a single electrode with\none detection point.” Ibid. The claim’s functional provi­\nsions, the majority went on to observe, shed additional\nlight on the meaning of “spaced relationship.” Surveying\nthe record before the PTO on reexamination, the majority\nconcluded that a skilled artisan would know that she could\nattain the indicated functions of equalizing and removing\nEMG signals by adjusting design variables, including\nspacing.\n   In a concurring opinion, Judge Schall reached the ma­\njority’s result employing “a more limited analysis.” Id., at\n905. Judge Schall accepted the majority’s recitation of the\ndefiniteness standard, under which claims amenable to\n8       NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconstruction are nonetheless indefinite when “the con­\nstruction remains insolubly ambiguous.” Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The District Court’s construc­\ntion of “spaced relationship,” Judge Schall maintained,\nwas sufficiently clear: the term means “there is a fixed\nspatial relationship between the live electrode and the\ncommon electrode” on each side of the cylindrical bar.\nIbid. Judge Schall agreed with the majority that the\nintrinsic evidence discloses inherent limits of that spacing.\nBut, unlike the majority, Judge Schall did not “presum[e]\na functional linkage between the ‘spaced relationship’\nlimitation and the removal of EMG signals.” Id., at 906.\nOther limitations of the claim, in his view, and not the\n“ ‘spaced relationship’ limitation itself,” “included a func­\ntional requirement to remove EMG signals.” Ibid.\n    We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nvacate and remand.\n                              III\n                               A\n   Although the parties here disagree on the dispositive\nquestion—does the ’753 patent withstand definiteness\nscrutiny—they are in accord on several aspects of the\n§112, ¶2 inquiry. First, definiteness is to be evaluated\nfrom the perspective of someone skilled in the relevant art.\nSee, e.g., General Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304\nU. S. 364, 371 (1938). See also §112, ¶1 (patent’s specifi­\ncation “shall contain a written description of the invention,\nand of the manner and process of making and using it, in\nsuch full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any\nperson skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which\nit is most nearly connected, to make and use the same”\n(emphasis added)). Second, in assessing definiteness,\nclaims are to be read in light of the patent’s specification\nand prosecution history. See, e.g., United States v. Adams,\n383 U. S. 39, 48–49 (1966) (specification); Festo Corp. v.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

Third, “[d]efiniteness is\nmeasured from the viewpoint of a person skilled in [the]\nart at the time the patent was filed.” Brief for Respondent\n55 (emphasis added). See generally Sarnoff & Manzo, An\nIntroduction to, Premises of, and Problems With Patent\nClaim Construction, in Patent Claim Construction in the\nFederal Circuit 9 (E. Manzo ed. 2014) (“Patent claims . . .\nshould be construed from an objective perspective of a\n[skilled artisan], based on what the applicant actually\nclaimed, disclosed, and stated during the application\nprocess.”).\n   The parties differ, however, in their articulations of just\nhow much imprecision §112, ¶2 tolerates. In Nautilus’\nview, a patent is invalid when a claim is “ambiguous, such\nthat readers could reasonably interpret the claim’s scope\ndifferently.” Brief for Petitioner 37. Biosig and the Solici­\ntor General would require only that the patent provide\nreasonable notice of the scope of the claimed invention.\nSee Brief for Respondent 18; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 9–10.\n   Section 112, we have said, entails a “delicate balance.”\nFesto, 535 U. S., at 731. On the one hand, the definiteness\nrequirement must take into account the inherent limita­\ntions of language. See ibid. Some modicum of uncertainty,\nthe Court has recognized, is the “price of ensuring the\nappropriate incentives for innovation.” Id., at 732. One\nmust bear in mind, moreover, that patents are “not ad­\ndressed to lawyers, or even to the public generally,” but\nrather to those skilled in the relevant art. Carnegie Steel\nCo. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U. S. 403, 437 (1902) (also\nstating that “any description which is sufficient to apprise\n[steel manufacturers] in the language of the art of the\ndefinite feature of the invention, and to serve as a warning\nto others of what the patent claims as a monopoly, is\nsufficiently definite to sustain the patent”).5\n——————\n 5 See   also Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co., 261\n10        NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to\nafford clear notice of what is claimed, thereby “ ‘appris[ing]\nthe public of what is still open to them.’ ” Markman, 517\nU. S., at 373 (quoting McClain v. Ortmayer, 141 U. S. 419,\n424 (1891)).6 Otherwise there would be “[a] zone of uncer­\ntainty which enterprise and experimentation may enter\nonly at the risk of infringement claims.” United Carbon\nCo. v. Binney & Smith Co., 317 U. S. 228, 236 (1942). And\nabsent a meaningful definiteness check, we are told, pa­\ntent applicants face powerful incentives to inject ambigu-\nity into their claims. See Brief for Petitioner 30–32 (citing\npatent treatises and drafting guides). See also Federal\nTrade Commission, The Evolving IP Marketplace: Align­\ning Patent Notice and Remedies With Competition 85\n(2011) (quoting testimony that patent system fosters “an\nincentive to be as vague and ambiguous as you can with\nyour claims” and “defer clarity at all costs”).7 Eliminating\nthat temptation is in order, and “the patent drafter is in\nthe best position to resolve the ambiguity in . . . patent\n——————\nU.

Cognizant of the competing concerns,\nwe read §112, ¶2 to require that a patent’s claims, viewed\nin light of the specification and prosecution history, inform\nthose skilled in the art about the scope of the invention\nwith reasonable certainty. The definiteness requirement,\nso understood, mandates clarity, while recognizing that\nabsolute precision is unattainable.

It cannot be\nsufficient that a court can ascribe some meaning to a\npatent’s claims; the definiteness inquiry trains on the\nunderstanding of a skilled artisan at the time of the pa­\ntent application, not that of a court viewing matters\npost hoc. To tolerate imprecision just short of that render­\ning a claim “insolubly ambiguous” would diminish the\ndefiniteness requirement’s public-notice function and\nfoster the innovation-discouraging “zone of uncertainty,”\nUnited Carbon, 317 U. S., at 236, against which this Court\nhas warned.\n   Appreciating that “terms like ‘insolubly ambiguous’ may\nnot be felicitous,” Brief for Respondent 34, Biosig argues\nthe phrase is a shorthand label for a more probing inquiry\nthat the Federal Circuit applies in practice. The Federal\nCircuit’s fuller explications of the term “insolubly ambigu­\nous,” we recognize, may come closer to tracking the statu­\ntory prescription. See, e.g., 715 F. 3d, at 898 (case below)\n(“[I]f reasonable efforts at claim construction result in a\ndefinition that does not provide sufficient particularity\nand clarity to inform skilled artisans of the bounds of the\nclaim, the claim is insolubly ambiguous and invalid for\nindefiniteness.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). But\nalthough this Court does not “micromanag[e] the Federal\nCircuit’s particular word choice” in applying patent-law\ndoctrines, we must ensure that the Federal Circuit’s test is\nat least “probative of the essential inquiry.” Warner-\nJenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17,\n40 (1997). Falling short in that regard, the expressions\n“insolubly ambiguous” and “amenable to construction”\npermeate the Federal Circuit’s recent decisions concerning\n§112, ¶2’s requirement.9 We agree with Nautilus and its\n——————\nambiguity’ required to invalidate the claim”).\n  9 E.g., Hearing Components, Inc. v.

We leave these questions for\nanother day. The court below treated definiteness as “a legal issue\n[the] court reviews without deference,” 715 F. 3d, at 897, and Biosig has\nnot called our attention to any contested factual matter—or PTO\ndetermination thereof—pertinent to its infringement claims.\n14       NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe patent’s scope, as exemplified by the disagreement\namong the members of the Federal Circuit panel.11 Biosig\nresponds that “spaced relationship,” read in light of the\nspecification and as illustrated in the accompanying draw­\nings, delineates the permissible spacing with sufficient\nprecision.\n   “[M]indful that we are a court of review, not of first\nview,” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005),\nwe decline to apply the standard we have announced to\nthe controversy between Nautilus and Biosig. As we have\nexplained, the Federal Circuit invoked a standard more\namorphous than the statutory definiteness requirement\nallows. We therefore follow our ordinary practice of re­\nmanding so that the Court of Appeals can reconsider,\nunder the proper standard, whether the relevant claims in\nthe ’753 patent are sufficiently definite. See, e.g., Johnson\nv. California, 543 U. S. 499, 515 (2005); Gasperini v. Cen-\nter for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 438 (1996).\n                       *   *      *\n  For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n 11 Notably, however, all three panel members found Nautilus’ argu­\n\nments unavailing.\n                Cite as: 572 U.
