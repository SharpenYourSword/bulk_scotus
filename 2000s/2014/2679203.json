BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 13\u2013369.      Argued April 28, 2014\u2014Decided June 2, 2014\nThe Patent Act requires that a patent specification \u201cconclude with one\n  or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the\n  subject matter which the applicant regards as [the] invention.\u201d 35\n  U. S. C. \u00a7112, \u00b62. This case concerns the proper reading of the stat\u00ad\n  ute\u2019s clarity and precision demand.\n     Assigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., the patent in dis\u00ad\n  pute (the \u2019753 patent) involves a heart-rate monitor used with exer\u00ad\n  cise equipment. Prior heart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were\n  often inaccurate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying\n  each heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals) because of the\n  presence of other electrical signals (electromyogram or EMG signals),\n  generated by the user\u2019s skeletal muscles, that can impede ECG signal\n  detection. The invention claims to improve on prior art by detecting\n  and processing ECG signals in a way that filters out the EMG inter\u00ad\n  ference.\n     Claim 1 of the \u2019753 patent, which contains the limitations critical to\n  this dispute, refers to a \u201cheart rate monitor for use by a user in asso\u00ad\n  ciation with exercise apparatus and/or exercise procedures.\u201d The\n  claim \u201ccomprise[s],\u201d among other elements, a cylindrical bar fitted\n  with a display device; \u201celectronic circuitry including a difference am\u00ad\n  plifier\u201d; and, on each half of the cylindrical bar, a \u201clive\u201d electrode and\n  a \u201ccommon\u201d electrode \u201cmounted . . . in spaced relationship with each\n  other.\u201d\n     Biosig filed this patent infringement suit, alleging that Nautilus,\n  Inc., without obtaining a license, sold exercise machines containing\n  Biosig\u2019s patented technology. The District Court, after conducting a\n  hearing to determine the proper construction of the patent\u2019s claims,\n  granted Nautilus\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that\n2          NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the claim term \u201cin spaced relationship with each other\u201d failed \u00a7112,\n    \u00b62\u2019s definiteness requirement. The Federal Circuit reversed and re\u00ad\n    manded, concluding that a patent claim passes the \u00a7112, \u00b62 thresh\u00ad\n    old so long as the claim is \u201camenable to construction,\u201d and the claim,\n    as construed, is not \u201cinsolubly ambiguous.\u201d Under that standard, the\n    court determined, the \u2019753 patent survived indefiniteness review.\nHeld:\n    1. A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of\n the patent\u2019s specification and prosecution history, fail to inform, with\n reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the\n invention. The parties agree that definiteness is to be evaluated from\n the perspective of a person skilled in the relevant art, that claims are\n to be read in light of the patent\u2019s specification and prosecution histo\u00ad\n ry, and that definiteness is to be measured as of the time of the pa\u00ad\n tent application. The parties disagree as to how much imprecision\n \u00a7112, \u00b62 tolerates.\n    Section 112\u2019s definiteness requirement must take into account the\n inherent limitations of language. See Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzo-\n ku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 731. On the one hand, some\n modicum of uncertainty is the \u201cprice of ensuring the appropriate in\u00ad\n centives for innovation,\u201d id., at 732; and patents are \u201cnot addressed to\n lawyers, or even to the public generally,\u201d but to those skilled in the\n relevant art, Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U. S. 403,\n 437. At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to afford\n clear notice of what is claimed, thereby \u201c \u2018appris[ing] the public of\n what is still open to them,\u2019 \u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,\n 517 U. S. 370, 373, in a manner that avoids \u201c[a] zone of uncertainty\n which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at the risk of\n infringement claims,\u201d United Carbon Co. v. Binney & Smith Co., 317\n U. S. 228, 236. The standard adopted here mandates clarity, while\n recognizing that absolute precision is unattainable. It also accords\n with opinions of this Court stating that \u201cthe certainty which the law\n requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable, having regard\n to their subject-matter.\u201d Minerals Separation, Ltd. v. Hyde, 242 U. S.\n 261, 270. Pp. 8\u201311.\n    2. The Federal Circuit\u2019s standard, which tolerates some ambiguous\n claims but not others, does not satisfy the statute\u2019s definiteness re\u00ad\n quirement. The Court of Appeals inquired whether the \u2019753 patent\u2019s\n claims were \u201camenable to construction\u201d or \u201cinsolubly ambiguous,\u201d but\n such formulations lack the precision \u00a7112, \u00b62 demands. To tolerate\n imprecision just short of that rendering a claim \u201cinsolubly ambigu\u00ad\n ous\u201d would diminish the definiteness requirement\u2019s public-notice\n function and foster the innovation-discouraging \u201czone of uncertainty,\u201d\n United Carbon, 317 U. S., at 236, against which this Court has\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  warned. While some of the Federal Circuit\u2019s fuller explications of the\n  term \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d may come closer to tracking the statuto\u00ad\n  ry prescription, this Court must ensure that the Federal Circuit\u2019s test\n  is at least \u201cprobative of the essential inquiry.\u201d Warner-Jenkinson Co.\n  v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17, 40. The expressions \u201cin\u00ad\n  solubly ambiguous\u201d and \u201camenable to construction,\u201d which permeate\n  the Federal Circuit\u2019s recent decisions concerning \u00a7112, \u00b62, fall short\n  in this regard and can leave courts and the patent bar at sea without\n  a reliable compass. Pp. 11\u201313.\n     3. This Court, as \u201ca court of review, not of first view,\u201d Cutter v. Wil-\n  kinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7, follows its ordinary practice of re\u00ad\n  manding so that the Federal Circuit can reconsider, under the proper\n  standard, whether the relevant claims in the \u2019753 patent are suffi\u00ad\n  ciently definite, see, e.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 515.\n  Pp. 13\u201314.\n715 F. 3d 891, vacated and remanded.\n\n  GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 572 U.

BIOSIG \n\n               INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 2, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Patent Act requires that a patent specification\n\u201cconclude with one or more claims particularly pointing\nout and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the\napplicant regards as [the] invention.\u201d 35 U. S. C. \u00a7112, \u00b62\n(2006 ed.) (emphasis added). This case, involving a heart\u00ad\nrate monitor used with exercise equipment, concerns the\nproper reading of the statute\u2019s clarity and precision de\u00ad\nmand. According to the Federal Circuit, a patent claim\npasses the \u00a7112, \u00b62 threshold so long as the claim is\n\u201camenable to construction,\u201d and the claim, as construed, is\nnot \u201cinsolubly ambiguous.\u201d 715 F. 3d 891, 898\u2013899 (2013).\nWe conclude that the Federal Circuit\u2019s formulation, which\ntolerates some ambiguous claims but not others, does not\nsatisfy the statute\u2019s definiteness requirement. In place of\nthe \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d standard, we hold that a patent\nis invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of\nthe specification delineating the patent, and the prosecu\u00ad\ntion history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty,\nthose skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\nExpressing no opinion on the validity of the patent-in-suit,\n2       NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe remand, instructing the Federal Circuit to decide the\ncase employing the standard we have prescribed.\n                                I\n   Authorized by the Constitution \u201c[t]o promote the Pro\u00ad\ngress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited\nTimes to . . .

I, \u00a78, cl. 8, Congress has enacted patent\nlaws rewarding inventors with a limited monopoly.\n\u201cTh[at] monopoly is a property right,\u201d and \u201clike any prop\u00ad\nerty right, its boundaries should be clear.\u201d Festo Corp. v.\nShoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 730\n(2002). See also Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,\n517 U. S. 370, 373 (1996) (\u201cIt has long been understood\nthat a patent must describe the exact scope of an inven\u00ad\ntion and its manufacture . . . .\u201d). Thus, when Congress\nenacted the first Patent Act in 1790, it directed that pa\u00ad\ntent grantees file a written specification \u201ccontaining a\ndescription . . . of the thing or things . . . invented or dis\u00ad\ncovered,\u201d which \u201cshall be so particular\u201d as to \u201cdistinguish\nthe invention or discovery from other things before known\nand used.\u201d Act of Apr. 10, 1790, \u00a72, 1 Stat. 110.\n   The patent laws have retained this requirement of\ndefiniteness even as the focus of patent construction has\nshifted. Under early patent practice in the United States,\nwe have recounted, it was the written specification that\n\u201crepresented the key to the patent.\u201d Markman, 517 U. S.,\nat 379. Eventually, however, patent applicants began to\nset out the invention\u2019s scope in a separate section known\nas the \u201cclaim.\u201d See generally 1 R. Moy, Walker on Patents\n\u00a74.2, pp. 4\u201317 to 4\u201320 (4th ed. 2012). The Patent Act of\n1870 expressly conditioned the receipt of a patent on the\ninventor\u2019s inclusion of one or more such claims, described\nwith particularity and distinctness. See Act of July 8,\n1870, \u00a726, 16 Stat. 201 (to obtain a patent, the inventor\nmust \u201cparticularly point out and distinctly claim the part,\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

Section 112 of the Patent Act of 1952,\napplicable to this case, requires the patent applicant to\nconclude the specification with \u201cone or more claims partic\u00ad\nularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject\nmatter which the applicant regards as his invention.\u201d 35\nU. S. C. \u00a7112, \u00b62 (2006 ed.). A lack of definiteness renders\ninvalid \u201cthe patent or any claim in suit.\u201d \u00a7282, \u00b62(3).1\n                            II\n\n                            A\n\n  The patent in dispute, U. S. Patent No. 5,337,753 (\u2019753\npatent), issued to Dr. Gregory Lekhtman in 1994 and\nassigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., concerns\na heart-rate monitor for use during exercise. Previous\nheart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were often inaccu\u00ad\nrate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying\neach heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals). The\ninaccuracy was caused by electrical signals of a different\nsort, known as electromyogram or EMG signals, generated\nby an exerciser\u2019s skeletal muscles when, for example, she\nmoves her arm, or grips an exercise monitor with her\nhand. These EMG signals can \u201cmask\u201d ECG signals and\nthereby impede their detection. App. 52, 147.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L. 112\u201329, 125 Stat.\n284, enacted in 2011, Congress amended several parts of the Patent\nAct. Those amendments modified \u00a7\u00a7112 and 282 in minor respects not\npertinent here. In any event, the amended versions of those provisions\nare inapplicable to patent applications filed before September 16, 2012,\nand proceedings commenced before September 16, 2011. See \u00a7\u00a74(e),\n15(c), 20(l), 125 Stat. 297, 328, 335, notes following 35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72, 111,\n119. Here, the application for the patent-in-suit was filed in 1992, and\nthe relevant court proceedings were initiated in 2010. Accordingly, this\nopinion\u2019s citations to the Patent Act refer to the 2006 edition of the\nUnited States Code.\n4         NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Dr. Lekhtman\u2019s invention claims to improve on prior art\nby eliminating that impediment. The invention focuses on\na key difference between EMG and ECG waveforms: while\nECG signals detected from a user\u2019s left hand have a polar\u00ad\nity opposite to that of the signals detected from her right\nhand,2 EMG signals from each hand have the same polar-\nity. The patented device works by measuring equalized\nEMG signals detected at each hand and then using cir\u00ad\ncuitry to subtract the identical EMG signals from each\nother, thus filtering out the EMG interference.\n   As relevant here, the \u2019753 patent describes a heart-rate\nmonitor contained in a hollow cylindrical bar that a user\ngrips with both hands, such that each hand comes into\ncontact with two electrodes, one \u201clive\u201d and one \u201ccommon.\u201d\nThe device is illustrated in figure 1 of the patent, id., at\n41, reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion.\n   Claim 1 of the \u2019753 patent, which contains the limita\u00ad\ntions critical to this dispute, refers to a \u201cheart rate monitor\nfor use by a user in association with exercise apparatus\nand/or exercise procedures.\u201d Id., at 61. The claim \u201ccom\u00ad\nprise[s],\u201d among other elements, an \u201celongate member\u201d\n(cylindrical bar) with a display device; \u201celectronic circuitry\nincluding a difference amplifier\u201d; and, on each half of the\ncylindrical bar, a live electrode and a common electrode\n\u201cmounted . . . in spaced relationship with each other.\u201d\nIbid.3 The claim sets forth additional elements, including\nthat the cylindrical bar is to be held in such a way that\neach of the user\u2019s hands \u201ccontact[s]\u201d both electrodes on\neach side of the bar. Id., at 62. Further, the EMG signals\ndetected by the two electrode pairs are to be \u201cof substan\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 This difference in polarity occurs because the heart is not aligned\n\nvertically in relation to the center of the body; the organ tilts leftward\nfrom apex to bottom. App. 213.\n  3 As depicted in figure 1 of the patent, id., at 41, reproduced in the\n\nAppendix to this opinion, the live electrodes are identified by numbers\n9 and 13, and the common electrodes, by 11 and 15.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntially equal magnitude and phase\u201d so that the difference\namplifier will \u201cproduce a substantially zero [EMG] signal\u201d\nupon subtracting the signals from one another. Ibid.\n                              B\n  The dispute between the parties arose in the 1990\u2019s,\nwhen Biosig allegedly disclosed the patented technology to\nStairMaster Sports Medical Products, Inc. According to\nBiosig, StairMaster, without ever obtaining a license, sold\nexercise machines that included Biosig\u2019s patented technol\u00ad\nogy, and petitioner Nautilus, Inc., continued to do so after\nacquiring the StairMaster brand. In 2004, based on these\nallegations, Biosig brought a patent infringement suit\nagainst Nautilus in the U. S. District Court for the South\u00ad\nern District of New York.\n  With Biosig\u2019s lawsuit launched, Nautilus asked the U. S.\nPatent and Trademark Office (PTO) to reexamine the \u2019753\npatent.     The reexamination proceedings centered on\nwhether the patent was anticipated or rendered obvious\nby prior art\u2014principally, a patent issued in 1984 to an\ninventor named Fujisaki, which similarly disclosed a\nheart-rate monitor using two pairs of electrodes and a\ndifference amplifier. Endeavoring to distinguish the \u2019753\npatent from prior art, Biosig submitted a declaration from\nDr. Lekhtman. The declaration attested, among other\nthings, that the \u2019753 patent sufficiently informed a person\nskilled in the art how to configure the detecting electrodes\nso as \u201cto produce equal EMG [signals] from the left and\nright hands.\u201d Id., at 160. Although the electrodes\u2019 design\nvariables\u2014including spacing, shape, size, and material\u2014\ncannot be standardized across all exercise machines, Dr.\nLekhtman explained, a skilled artisan could undertake a\n\u201ctrial and error\u201d process of equalization. This would entail\nexperimentation with different electrode configurations in\norder to optimize EMG signal cancellation. Id., at 155\u2013\n6        NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n156, 158.4 In 2010, the PTO issued a determination con\u00ad\nfirming the patentability of the \u2019753 patent\u2019s claims.\n   Biosig thereafter reinstituted its infringement suit,\nwhich the parties had voluntarily dismissed without prej\u00ad\nudice while PTO reexamination was underway. In 2011,\nthe District Court conducted a hearing to determine the\nproper construction of the patent\u2019s claims, see Markman v.\nWestview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370 (1996) (claim\nconstruction is a matter of law reserved for court decision),\nincluding the claim term \u201cin spaced relationship with each\nother.\u201d According to Biosig, that \u201cspaced relationship\u201d\nreferred to the distance between the live electrode and the\ncommon electrode in each electrode pair. Nautilus, seizing\non Biosig\u2019s submissions to the PTO during the reexamina\u00ad\ntion, maintained that the \u201cspaced relationship\u201d must be a\ndistance \u201cgreater than the width of each electrode.\u201d App.\n245. The District Court ultimately construed the term to\nmean \u201cthere is a defined relationship between the live\nelectrode and the common electrode on one side of the\ncylindrical bar and the same or a different defined rela\u00ad\ntionship between the live electrode and the common elec\u00ad\ntrode on the other side of the cylindrical bar,\u201d without any\nreference to the electrodes\u2019 width.

Id., at 72a.\n   The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded. A claim is\nindefinite, the majority opinion stated, \u201conly when it is\n\u2018not amenable to construction\u2019 or \u2018insolubly ambiguous.\u2019 \u201d\n715 F. 3d 891, 898 (2013) (quoting Datamize, LLC v.\nPlumtree Software, Inc., 417 F. 3d 1342, 1347 (CA Fed.\n2005)). Under that standard, the majority determined, the\n\u2019753 patent survived indefiniteness review. Considering\nfirst the \u201cintrinsic evidence\u201d\u2014i.e., the claim language, the\nspecification, and the prosecution history\u2014the majority\ndiscerned \u201ccertain inherent parameters of the claimed\napparatus, which to a skilled artisan may be sufficient to\nunderstand the metes and bounds of \u2018spaced relation\u00ad\nship.\u2019 \u201d 715 F. 3d, at 899. These sources of meaning, the\nmajority explained, make plain that the distance separat\u00ad\ning the live and common electrodes on each half of the bar\n\u201ccannot be greater than the width of a user\u2019s hands\u201d; that\nis so \u201cbecause claim 1 requires the live and common elec\u00ad\ntrodes to independently detect electrical signals at two\ndistinct points of a hand.\u201d Ibid. Furthermore, the major\u00ad\nity noted, the intrinsic evidence teaches that this distance\ncannot be \u201cinfinitesimally small, effectively merging the\nlive and common electrodes into a single electrode with\none detection point.\u201d Ibid. The claim\u2019s functional provi\u00ad\nsions, the majority went on to observe, shed additional\nlight on the meaning of \u201cspaced relationship.\u201d Surveying\nthe record before the PTO on reexamination, the majority\nconcluded that a skilled artisan would know that she could\nattain the indicated functions of equalizing and removing\nEMG signals by adjusting design variables, including\nspacing.\n   In a concurring opinion, Judge Schall reached the ma\u00ad\njority\u2019s result employing \u201ca more limited analysis.\u201d Id., at\n905. Judge Schall accepted the majority\u2019s recitation of the\ndefiniteness standard, under which claims amenable to\n8       NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconstruction are nonetheless indefinite when \u201cthe con\u00ad\nstruction remains insolubly ambiguous.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The District Court\u2019s construc\u00ad\ntion of \u201cspaced relationship,\u201d Judge Schall maintained,\nwas sufficiently clear: the term means \u201cthere is a fixed\nspatial relationship between the live electrode and the\ncommon electrode\u201d on each side of the cylindrical bar.\nIbid. Judge Schall agreed with the majority that the\nintrinsic evidence discloses inherent limits of that spacing.\nBut, unlike the majority, Judge Schall did not \u201cpresum[e]\na functional linkage between the \u2018spaced relationship\u2019\nlimitation and the removal of EMG signals.\u201d Id., at 906.\nOther limitations of the claim, in his view, and not the\n\u201c \u2018spaced relationship\u2019 limitation itself,\u201d \u201cincluded a func\u00ad\ntional requirement to remove EMG signals.\u201d Ibid.\n    We granted certiorari, 571 U.

First, definiteness is to be evaluated\nfrom the perspective of someone skilled in the relevant art.\nSee, e.g., General Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304\nU. S. 364, 371 (1938). See also \u00a7112, \u00b61 (patent\u2019s specifi\u00ad\ncation \u201cshall contain a written description of the invention,\nand of the manner and process of making and using it, in\nsuch full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any\nperson skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which\nit is most nearly connected, to make and use the same\u201d\n(emphasis added)). Second, in assessing definiteness,\nclaims are to be read in light of the patent\u2019s specification\nand prosecution history. See, e.g., United States v. Adams,\n383 U. S. 39, 48\u201349 (1966) (specification); Festo Corp. v.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

Third, \u201c[d]efiniteness is\nmeasured from the viewpoint of a person skilled in [the]\nart at the time the patent was filed.\u201d Brief for Respondent\n55 (emphasis added). See generally Sarnoff & Manzo, An\nIntroduction to, Premises of, and Problems With Patent\nClaim Construction, in Patent Claim Construction in the\nFederal Circuit 9 (E. Manzo ed. 2014) (\u201cPatent claims . . .\nshould be construed from an objective perspective of a\n[skilled artisan], based on what the applicant actually\nclaimed, disclosed, and stated during the application\nprocess.\u201d).\n   The parties differ, however, in their articulations of just\nhow much imprecision \u00a7112, \u00b62 tolerates. In Nautilus\u2019\nview, a patent is invalid when a claim is \u201cambiguous, such\nthat readers could reasonably interpret the claim\u2019s scope\ndifferently.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 37. Biosig and the Solici\u00ad\ntor General would require only that the patent provide\nreasonable notice of the scope of the claimed invention.\nSee Brief for Respondent 18; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 9\u201310.\n   Section 112, we have said, entails a \u201cdelicate balance.\u201d\nFesto, 535 U. S., at 731. On the one hand, the definiteness\nrequirement must take into account the inherent limita\u00ad\ntions of language. See ibid. Some modicum of uncertainty,\nthe Court has recognized, is the \u201cprice of ensuring the\nappropriate incentives for innovation.\u201d Id., at 732. One\nmust bear in mind, moreover, that patents are \u201cnot ad\u00ad\ndressed to lawyers, or even to the public generally,\u201d but\nrather to those skilled in the relevant art. Carnegie Steel\nCo. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U. S. 403, 437 (1902) (also\nstating that \u201cany description which is sufficient to apprise\n[steel manufacturers] in the language of the art of the\ndefinite feature of the invention, and to serve as a warning\nto others of what the patent claims as a monopoly, is\nsufficiently definite to sustain the patent\u201d).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 5 See   also Eibel Process Co. v.

BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to\nafford clear notice of what is claimed, thereby \u201c \u2018appris[ing]\nthe public of what is still open to them.\u2019 \u201d Markman, 517\nU. S., at 373 (quoting McClain v. Ortmayer, 141 U.

Binney & Smith Co., 317 U. S. 228, 236 (1942). And\nabsent a meaningful definiteness check, we are told, pa\u00ad\ntent applicants face powerful incentives to inject ambigu-\nity into their claims.

BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthey lack the precision \u00a7112, \u00b62 demands. It cannot be\nsufficient that a court can ascribe some meaning to a\npatent\u2019s claims; the definiteness inquiry trains on the\nunderstanding of a skilled artisan at the time of the pa\u00ad\ntent application, not that of a court viewing matters\npost hoc. To tolerate imprecision just short of that render\u00ad\ning a claim \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d would diminish the\ndefiniteness requirement\u2019s public-notice function and\nfoster the innovation-discouraging \u201czone of uncertainty,\u201d\nUnited Carbon, 317 U. S., at 236, against which this Court\nhas warned.\n   Appreciating that \u201cterms like \u2018insolubly ambiguous\u2019 may\nnot be felicitous,\u201d Brief for Respondent 34, Biosig argues\nthe phrase is a shorthand label for a more probing inquiry\nthat the Federal Circuit applies in practice. The Federal\nCircuit\u2019s fuller explications of the term \u201cinsolubly ambigu\u00ad\nous,\u201d we recognize, may come closer to tracking the statu\u00ad\ntory prescription. See, e.g., 715 F. 3d, at 898 (case below)\n(\u201c[I]f reasonable efforts at claim construction result in a\ndefinition that does not provide sufficient particularity\nand clarity to inform skilled artisans of the bounds of the\nclaim, the claim is insolubly ambiguous and invalid for\nindefiniteness.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). But\nalthough this Court does not \u201cmicromanag[e] the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s particular word choice\u201d in applying patent-law\ndoctrines, we must ensure that the Federal Circuit\u2019s test is\nat least \u201cprobative of the essential inquiry.\u201d Warner-\nJenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17,\n40 (1997). Falling short in that regard, the expressions\n\u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d and \u201camenable to construction\u201d\npermeate the Federal Circuit\u2019s recent decisions concerning\n\u00a7112, \u00b62\u2019s requirement.9 We agree with Nautilus and its\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nambiguity\u2019 required to invalidate the claim\u201d).\n  9 E.g., Hearing Components, Inc. v.

As the parties\nappear to agree, however, this presumption of validity does not alter\nthe degree of clarity that \u00a7112, \u00b62 demands from patent applicants; to\nthe contrary, it incorporates that definiteness requirement by refer\u00ad\nence.

We leave these questions for\nanother day. The court below treated definiteness as \u201ca legal issue\n[the] court reviews without deference,\u201d 715 F. 3d, at 897, and Biosig has\nnot called our attention to any contested factual matter\u2014or PTO\ndetermination thereof\u2014pertinent to its infringement claims.\n14       NAUTILUS, INC. v.

This case concerns the proper reading of the stat\u00ad\n  ute\u2019s clarity and precision demand.\n     Assigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., the patent in dis\u00ad\n  pute (the \u2019753 patent) involves a heart-rate monitor used with exer\u00ad\n  cise equipment. Prior heart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were\n  often inaccurate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying\n  each heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals) because of the\n  presence of other electrical signals (electromyogram or EMG signals),\n  generated by the user\u2019s skeletal muscles, that can impede ECG signal\n  detection. The invention claims to improve on prior art by detecting\n  and processing ECG signals in a way that filters out the EMG inter\u00ad\n  ference.\n     Claim 1 of the \u2019753 patent, which contains the limitations critical to\n  this dispute, refers to a \u201cheart rate monitor for use by a user in asso\u00ad\n  ciation with exercise apparatus and/or exercise procedures.\u201d The\n  claim \u201ccomprise[s],\u201d among other elements, a cylindrical bar fitted\n  with a display device; \u201celectronic circuitry including a difference am\u00ad\n  plifier\u201d; and, on each half of the cylindrical bar, a \u201clive\u201d electrode and\n  a \u201ccommon\u201d electrode \u201cmounted . . . in spaced relationship with each\n  other.\u201d\n     Biosig filed this patent infringement suit, alleging that Nautilus,\n  Inc., without obtaining a license, sold exercise machines containing\n  Biosig\u2019s patented technology. The District Court, after conducting a\n  hearing to determine the proper construction of the patent\u2019s claims,\n  granted Nautilus\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that\n2          NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the claim term \u201cin spaced relationship with each other\u201d failed \u00a7112,\n    \u00b62\u2019s definiteness requirement. The Federal Circuit reversed and re\u00ad\n    manded, concluding that a patent claim passes the \u00a7112, \u00b62 thresh\u00ad\n    old so long as the claim is \u201camenable to construction,\u201d and the claim,\n    as construed, is not \u201cinsolubly ambiguous.\u201d Under that standard, the\n    court determined, the \u2019753 patent survived indefiniteness review.\nHeld:\n    1. A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of\n the patent\u2019s specification and prosecution history, fail to inform, with\n reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the\n invention. The parties agree that definiteness is to be evaluated from\n the perspective of a person skilled in the relevant art, that claims are\n to be read in light of the patent\u2019s specification and prosecution histo\u00ad\n ry, and that definiteness is to be measured as of the time of the pa\u00ad\n tent application. The parties disagree as to how much imprecision\n \u00a7112, \u00b62 tolerates.\n    Section 112\u2019s definiteness requirement must take into account the\n inherent limitations of language. See Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzo-\n ku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 731. On the one hand, some\n modicum of uncertainty is the \u201cprice of ensuring the appropriate in\u00ad\n centives for innovation,\u201d id., at 732; and patents are \u201cnot addressed to\n lawyers, or even to the public generally,\u201d but to those skilled in the\n relevant art, Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U. S. 403,\n 437. At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to afford\n clear notice of what is claimed, thereby \u201c \u2018appris[ing] the public of\n what is still open to them,\u2019 \u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,\n 517 U. S. 370, 373, in a manner that avoids \u201c[a] zone of uncertainty\n which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at the risk of\n infringement claims,\u201d United Carbon Co. v. Binney & Smith Co., 317\n U. S. 228, 236. The standard adopted here mandates clarity, while\n recognizing that absolute precision is unattainable. It also accords\n with opinions of this Court stating that \u201cthe certainty which the law\n requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable, having regard\n to their subject-matter.\u201d Minerals Separation, Ltd. v. Hyde, 242 U. S.\n 261, 270. Pp. 8\u201311.\n    2. The Federal Circuit\u2019s standard, which tolerates some ambiguous\n claims but not others, does not satisfy the statute\u2019s definiteness re\u00ad\n quirement. The Court of Appeals inquired whether the \u2019753 patent\u2019s\n claims were \u201camenable to construction\u201d or \u201cinsolubly ambiguous,\u201d but\n such formulations lack the precision \u00a7112, \u00b62 demands. To tolerate\n imprecision just short of that rendering a claim \u201cinsolubly ambigu\u00ad\n ous\u201d would diminish the definiteness requirement\u2019s public-notice\n function and foster the innovation-discouraging \u201czone of uncertainty,\u201d\n United Carbon, 317 U.

While some of the Federal Circuit\u2019s fuller explications of the\n  term \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d may come closer to tracking the statuto\u00ad\n  ry prescription, this Court must ensure that the Federal Circuit\u2019s test\n  is at least \u201cprobative of the essential inquiry.\u201d Warner-Jenkinson Co.\n  v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17, 40. The expressions \u201cin\u00ad\n  solubly ambiguous\u201d and \u201camenable to construction,\u201d which permeate\n  the Federal Circuit\u2019s recent decisions concerning \u00a7112, \u00b62, fall short\n  in this regard and can leave courts and the patent bar at sea without\n  a reliable compass.

S. C. \u00a7112, \u00b62\n(2006 ed.) (emphasis added). This case, involving a heart\u00ad\nrate monitor used with exercise equipment, concerns the\nproper reading of the statute\u2019s clarity and precision de\u00ad\nmand. According to the Federal Circuit, a patent claim\npasses the \u00a7112, \u00b62 threshold so long as the claim is\n\u201camenable to construction,\u201d and the claim, as construed, is\nnot \u201cinsolubly ambiguous.\u201d 715 F. 3d 891, 898\u2013899 (2013).\nWe conclude that the Federal Circuit\u2019s formulation, which\ntolerates some ambiguous claims but not others, does not\nsatisfy the statute\u2019s definiteness requirement. In place of\nthe \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d standard, we hold that a patent\nis invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of\nthe specification delineating the patent, and the prosecu\u00ad\ntion history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty,\nthose skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\nExpressing no opinion on the validity of the patent-in-suit,\n2       NAUTILUS, INC. v.

Thus, when Congress\nenacted the first Patent Act in 1790, it directed that pa\u00ad\ntent grantees file a written specification \u201ccontaining a\ndescription . . . of the thing or things . . . invented or dis\u00ad\ncovered,\u201d which \u201cshall be so particular\u201d as to \u201cdistinguish\nthe invention or discovery from other things before known\nand used.\u201d Act of Apr. 10, 1790, \u00a72, 1 Stat. 110.\n   The patent laws have retained this requirement of\ndefiniteness even as the focus of patent construction has\nshifted. Under early patent practice in the United States,\nwe have recounted, it was the written specification that\n\u201crepresented the key to the patent.\u201d Markman, 517 U. S.,\nat 379.

Previous\nheart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were often inaccu\u00ad\nrate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying\neach heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals). The\ninaccuracy was caused by electrical signals of a different\nsort, known as electromyogram or EMG signals, generated\nby an exerciser\u2019s skeletal muscles when, for example, she\nmoves her arm, or grips an exercise monitor with her\nhand. These EMG signals can \u201cmask\u201d ECG signals and\nthereby impede their detection. App. 52, 147.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, Pub.

In any event, the amended versions of those provisions\nare inapplicable to patent applications filed before September 16, 2012,\nand proceedings commenced before September 16, 2011.

Here, the application for the patent-in-suit was filed in 1992, and\nthe relevant court proceedings were initiated in 2010. Accordingly, this\nopinion\u2019s citations to the Patent Act refer to the 2006 edition of the\nUnited States Code.\n4         NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Dr. Lekhtman\u2019s invention claims to improve on prior art\nby eliminating that impediment. The invention focuses on\na key difference between EMG and ECG waveforms: while\nECG signals detected from a user\u2019s left hand have a polar\u00ad\nity opposite to that of the signals detected from her right\nhand,2 EMG signals from each hand have the same polar-\nity. The patented device works by measuring equalized\nEMG signals detected at each hand and then using cir\u00ad\ncuitry to subtract the identical EMG signals from each\nother, thus filtering out the EMG interference.\n   As relevant here, the \u2019753 patent describes a heart-rate\nmonitor contained in a hollow cylindrical bar that a user\ngrips with both hands, such that each hand comes into\ncontact with two electrodes, one \u201clive\u201d and one \u201ccommon.\u201d\nThe device is illustrated in figure 1 of the patent, id., at\n41, reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion.\n   Claim 1 of the \u2019753 patent, which contains the limita\u00ad\ntions critical to this dispute, refers to a \u201cheart rate monitor\nfor use by a user in association with exercise apparatus\nand/or exercise procedures.\u201d Id., at 61. The claim \u201ccom\u00ad\nprise[s],\u201d among other elements, an \u201celongate member\u201d\n(cylindrical bar) with a display device; \u201celectronic circuitry\nincluding a difference amplifier\u201d; and, on each half of the\ncylindrical bar, a live electrode and a common electrode\n\u201cmounted . . . in spaced relationship with each other.\u201d\nIbid.3 The claim sets forth additional elements, including\nthat the cylindrical bar is to be held in such a way that\neach of the user\u2019s hands \u201ccontact[s]\u201d both electrodes on\neach side of the bar. Id., at 62. Further, the EMG signals\ndetected by the two electrode pairs are to be \u201cof substan\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 This difference in polarity occurs because the heart is not aligned\n\nvertically in relation to the center of the body; the organ tilts leftward\nfrom apex to bottom. App. 213.\n  3 As depicted in figure 1 of the patent, id., at 41, reproduced in the\n\nAppendix to this opinion, the live electrodes are identified by numbers\n9 and 13, and the common electrodes, by 11 and 15.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Ibid.\n                              B\n  The dispute between the parties arose in the 1990\u2019s,\nwhen Biosig allegedly disclosed the patented technology to\nStairMaster Sports Medical Products, Inc. According to\nBiosig, StairMaster, without ever obtaining a license, sold\nexercise machines that included Biosig\u2019s patented technol\u00ad\nogy, and petitioner Nautilus, Inc., continued to do so after\nacquiring the StairMaster brand. In 2004, based on these\nallegations, Biosig brought a patent infringement suit\nagainst Nautilus in the U. S. District Court for the South\u00ad\nern District of New York.\n  With Biosig\u2019s lawsuit launched, Nautilus asked the U. S.\nPatent and Trademark Office (PTO) to reexamine the \u2019753\npatent.     The reexamination proceedings centered on\nwhether the patent was anticipated or rendered obvious\nby prior art\u2014principally, a patent issued in 1984 to an\ninventor named Fujisaki, which similarly disclosed a\nheart-rate monitor using two pairs of electrodes and a\ndifference amplifier. Endeavoring to distinguish the \u2019753\npatent from prior art, Biosig submitted a declaration from\nDr. Lekhtman. The declaration attested, among other\nthings, that the \u2019753 patent sufficiently informed a person\nskilled in the art how to configure the detecting electrodes\nso as \u201cto produce equal EMG [signals] from the left and\nright hands.\u201d Id., at 160. Although the electrodes\u2019 design\nvariables\u2014including spacing, shape, size, and material\u2014\ncannot be standardized across all exercise machines, Dr.\nLekhtman explained, a skilled artisan could undertake a\n\u201ctrial and error\u201d process of equalization. This would entail\nexperimentation with different electrode configurations in\norder to optimize EMG signal cancellation. Id., at 155\u2013\n6        NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n156, 158.4 In 2010, the PTO issued a determination con\u00ad\nfirming the patentability of the \u2019753 patent\u2019s claims.\n   Biosig thereafter reinstituted its infringement suit,\nwhich the parties had voluntarily dismissed without prej\u00ad\nudice while PTO reexamination was underway. In 2011,\nthe District Court conducted a hearing to determine the\nproper construction of the patent\u2019s claims, see Markman v.\nWestview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370 (1996) (claim\nconstruction is a matter of law reserved for court decision),\nincluding the claim term \u201cin spaced relationship with each\nother.\u201d According to Biosig, that \u201cspaced relationship\u201d\nreferred to the distance between the live electrode and the\ncommon electrode in each electrode pair. Nautilus, seizing\non Biosig\u2019s submissions to the PTO during the reexamina\u00ad\ntion, maintained that the \u201cspaced relationship\u201d must be a\ndistance \u201cgreater than the width of each electrode.\u201d App.\n245. The District Court ultimately construed the term to\nmean \u201cthere is a defined relationship between the live\nelectrode and the common electrode on one side of the\ncylindrical bar and the same or a different defined rela\u00ad\ntionship between the live electrode and the common elec\u00ad\ntrode on the other side of the cylindrical bar,\u201d without any\nreference to the electrodes\u2019 width. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n43a\u201344a.\n   Nautilus moved for summary judgment, arguing that\nthe term \u201cspaced relationship,\u201d as construed, was indefi\u00ad\nnite under \u00a7112, \u00b62. The District Court granted the mo\u00ad\ntion. Those words, the District Court concluded, \u201cdid not\ntell [the court] or anyone what precisely the space should\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Dr. Lekhtman\u2019s declaration also referred to an expert report pre\u00ad\n\npared by Dr. Henrietta Galiana, Chair of the Department of Biomedical\nEngineering at McGill University, for use in the infringement litiga\u00ad\ntion. That report described how Dr. Galiana\u2019s laboratory technician,\nequipped with a wooden dowel, wire, metal foil, glue, electrical tape,\nand the drawings from the \u2019753 patent, was able in two hours to build a\nmonitor that \u201cworked just as described in the . . . patent.\u201d Id., at 226.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Id., at 72a.\n   The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded. A claim is\nindefinite, the majority opinion stated, \u201conly when it is\n\u2018not amenable to construction\u2019 or \u2018insolubly ambiguous.\u2019 \u201d\n715 F. 3d 891, 898 (2013) (quoting Datamize, LLC v.\nPlumtree Software, Inc., 417 F. 3d 1342, 1347 (CA Fed.\n2005)). Under that standard, the majority determined, the\n\u2019753 patent survived indefiniteness review. Considering\nfirst the \u201cintrinsic evidence\u201d\u2014i.e., the claim language, the\nspecification, and the prosecution history\u2014the majority\ndiscerned \u201ccertain inherent parameters of the claimed\napparatus, which to a skilled artisan may be sufficient to\nunderstand the metes and bounds of \u2018spaced relation\u00ad\nship.\u2019 \u201d 715 F. 3d, at 899. These sources of meaning, the\nmajority explained, make plain that the distance separat\u00ad\ning the live and common electrodes on each half of the bar\n\u201ccannot be greater than the width of a user\u2019s hands\u201d; that\nis so \u201cbecause claim 1 requires the live and common elec\u00ad\ntrodes to independently detect electrical signals at two\ndistinct points of a hand.\u201d Ibid. Furthermore, the major\u00ad\nity noted, the intrinsic evidence teaches that this distance\ncannot be \u201cinfinitesimally small, effectively merging the\nlive and common electrodes into a single electrode with\none detection point.\u201d Ibid. The claim\u2019s functional provi\u00ad\nsions, the majority went on to observe, shed additional\nlight on the meaning of \u201cspaced relationship.\u201d Surveying\nthe record before the PTO on reexamination, the majority\nconcluded that a skilled artisan would know that she could\nattain the indicated functions of equalizing and removing\nEMG signals by adjusting design variables, including\nspacing.\n   In a concurring opinion, Judge Schall reached the ma\u00ad\njority\u2019s result employing \u201ca more limited analysis.\u201d Id., at\n905.

BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconstruction are nonetheless indefinite when \u201cthe con\u00ad\nstruction remains insolubly ambiguous.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The District Court\u2019s construc\u00ad\ntion of \u201cspaced relationship,\u201d Judge Schall maintained,\nwas sufficiently clear: the term means \u201cthere is a fixed\nspatial relationship between the live electrode and the\ncommon electrode\u201d on each side of the cylindrical bar.\nIbid. Judge Schall agreed with the majority that the\nintrinsic evidence discloses inherent limits of that spacing.\nBut, unlike the majority, Judge Schall did not \u201cpresum[e]\na functional linkage between the \u2018spaced relationship\u2019\nlimitation and the removal of EMG signals.\u201d Id., at 906.\nOther limitations of the claim, in his view, and not the\n\u201c \u2018spaced relationship\u2019 limitation itself,\u201d \u201cincluded a func\u00ad\ntional requirement to remove EMG signals.\u201d Ibid.\n    We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nvacate and remand.\n                              III\n                               A\n   Although the parties here disagree on the dispositive\nquestion\u2014does the \u2019753 patent withstand definiteness\nscrutiny\u2014they are in accord on several aspects of the\n\u00a7112, \u00b62 inquiry. First, definiteness is to be evaluated\nfrom the perspective of someone skilled in the relevant art.\nSee, e.g., General Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304\nU. S. 364, 371 (1938). See also \u00a7112, \u00b61 (patent\u2019s specifi\u00ad\ncation \u201cshall contain a written description of the invention,\nand of the manner and process of making and using it, in\nsuch full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any\nperson skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which\nit is most nearly connected, to make and use the same\u201d\n(emphasis added)). Second, in assessing definiteness,\nclaims are to be read in light of the patent\u2019s specification\nand prosecution history. See, e.g., United States v. Adams,\n383 U. S. 39, 48\u201349 (1966) (specification); Festo Corp. v.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nShoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 741\n(2002) (prosecution history). Third, \u201c[d]efiniteness is\nmeasured from the viewpoint of a person skilled in [the]\nart at the time the patent was filed.\u201d Brief for Respondent\n55 (emphasis added). See generally Sarnoff & Manzo, An\nIntroduction to, Premises of, and Problems With Patent\nClaim Construction, in Patent Claim Construction in the\nFederal Circuit 9 (E. Manzo ed. 2014) (\u201cPatent claims . . .\nshould be construed from an objective perspective of a\n[skilled artisan], based on what the applicant actually\nclaimed, disclosed, and stated during the application\nprocess.\u201d).\n   The parties differ, however, in their articulations of just\nhow much imprecision \u00a7112, \u00b62 tolerates. In Nautilus\u2019\nview, a patent is invalid when a claim is \u201cambiguous, such\nthat readers could reasonably interpret the claim\u2019s scope\ndifferently.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 37. Biosig and the Solici\u00ad\ntor General would require only that the patent provide\nreasonable notice of the scope of the claimed invention.\nSee Brief for Respondent 18; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 9\u201310.\n   Section 112, we have said, entails a \u201cdelicate balance.\u201d\nFesto, 535 U. S., at 731. On the one hand, the definiteness\nrequirement must take into account the inherent limita\u00ad\ntions of language. See ibid. Some modicum of uncertainty,\nthe Court has recognized, is the \u201cprice of ensuring the\nappropriate incentives for innovation.\u201d Id., at 732. One\nmust bear in mind, moreover, that patents are \u201cnot ad\u00ad\ndressed to lawyers, or even to the public generally,\u201d but\nrather to those skilled in the relevant art. Carnegie Steel\nCo. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U. S. 403, 437 (1902) (also\nstating that \u201cany description which is sufficient to apprise\n[steel manufacturers] in the language of the art of the\ndefinite feature of the invention, and to serve as a warning\nto others of what the patent claims as a monopoly, is\nsufficiently definite to sustain the patent\u201d).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 5 See   also Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co., 261\n10        NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to\nafford clear notice of what is claimed, thereby \u201c \u2018appris[ing]\nthe public of what is still open to them.\u2019 \u201d Markman, 517\nU. S., at 373 (quoting McClain v. Ortmayer, 141 U. S. 419,\n424 (1891)).6 Otherwise there would be \u201c[a] zone of uncer\u00ad\ntainty which enterprise and experimentation may enter\nonly at the risk of infringement claims.\u201d United Carbon\nCo. v. Binney & Smith Co., 317 U. S. 228, 236 (1942). And\nabsent a meaningful definiteness check, we are told, pa\u00ad\ntent applicants face powerful incentives to inject ambigu-\nity into their claims. See Brief for Petitioner 30\u201332 (citing\npatent treatises and drafting guides). See also Federal\nTrade Commission, The Evolving IP Marketplace: Align\u00ad\ning Patent Notice and Remedies With Competition 85\n(2011) (quoting testimony that patent system fosters \u201can\nincentive to be as vague and ambiguous as you can with\nyour claims\u201d and \u201cdefer clarity at all costs\u201d).7 Eliminating\nthat temptation is in order, and \u201cthe patent drafter is in\nthe best position to resolve the ambiguity in . . . patent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nU.

Cognizant of the competing concerns,\nwe read \u00a7112, \u00b62 to require that a patent\u2019s claims, viewed\nin light of the specification and prosecution history, inform\nthose skilled in the art about the scope of the invention\nwith reasonable certainty. The definiteness requirement,\nso understood, mandates clarity, while recognizing that\nabsolute precision is unattainable.

BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthey lack the precision \u00a7112, \u00b62 demands. It cannot be\nsufficient that a court can ascribe some meaning to a\npatent\u2019s claims; the definiteness inquiry trains on the\nunderstanding of a skilled artisan at the time of the pa\u00ad\ntent application, not that of a court viewing matters\npost hoc. To tolerate imprecision just short of that render\u00ad\ning a claim \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d would diminish the\ndefiniteness requirement\u2019s public-notice function and\nfoster the innovation-discouraging \u201czone of uncertainty,\u201d\nUnited Carbon, 317 U. S., at 236, against which this Court\nhas warned.\n   Appreciating that \u201cterms like \u2018insolubly ambiguous\u2019 may\nnot be felicitous,\u201d Brief for Respondent 34, Biosig argues\nthe phrase is a shorthand label for a more probing inquiry\nthat the Federal Circuit applies in practice. The Federal\nCircuit\u2019s fuller explications of the term \u201cinsolubly ambigu\u00ad\nous,\u201d we recognize, may come closer to tracking the statu\u00ad\ntory prescription. See, e.g., 715 F. 3d, at 898 (case below)\n(\u201c[I]f reasonable efforts at claim construction result in a\ndefinition that does not provide sufficient particularity\nand clarity to inform skilled artisans of the bounds of the\nclaim, the claim is insolubly ambiguous and invalid for\nindefiniteness.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). But\nalthough this Court does not \u201cmicromanag[e] the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s particular word choice\u201d in applying patent-law\ndoctrines, we must ensure that the Federal Circuit\u2019s test is\nat least \u201cprobative of the essential inquiry.\u201d Warner-\nJenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17,\n40 (1997). Falling short in that regard, the expressions\n\u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d and \u201camenable to construction\u201d\npermeate the Federal Circuit\u2019s recent decisions concerning\n\u00a7112, \u00b62\u2019s requirement.9 We agree with Nautilus and its\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nambiguity\u2019 required to invalidate the claim\u201d).\n  9 E.g., Hearing Components, Inc. v.

Nautilus maintains that the\nclaim term \u201cspaced relationship\u201d is open to multiple inter\u00ad\npretations reflecting markedly different understandings of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthose terms can be given any reasonable meaning\u201d); Datamize, LLC v.\nPlumtree Software, Inc., 417 F. 3d 1342, 1347 (CA Fed. 2005) (\u201cOnly\nclaims \u2018not amenable to construction\u2019 or \u2018insolubly ambiguous\u2019 are\nindefinite.\u201d); Exxon Research & Engineering Co. v.

S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 1) (invalidity defenses\nmust be proved by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d). As the parties\nappear to agree, however, this presumption of validity does not alter\nthe degree of clarity that \u00a7112, \u00b62 demands from patent applicants; to\nthe contrary, it incorporates that definiteness requirement by refer\u00ad\nence. See \u00a7282, \u00b62(3) (defenses to infringement actions include\n\u201c[i]nvalidity of the patent or any claim in suit for failure to comply with\n. . . any requirement of [\u00a7112]\u201d).\n    The parties nonetheless dispute whether factual findings subsidiary\nto the ultimate issue of definiteness trigger the clear-and-convincing\u00ad\nevidence standard and, relatedly, whether deference is due to the PTO\u2019s\nresolution of disputed issues of fact. We leave these questions for\nanother day. The court below treated definiteness as \u201ca legal issue\n[the] court reviews without deference,\u201d 715 F. 3d, at 897, and Biosig has\nnot called our attention to any contested factual matter\u2014or PTO\ndetermination thereof\u2014pertinent to its infringement claims.\n14       NAUTILUS, INC. v.

Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005),\nwe decline to apply the standard we have announced to\nthe controversy between Nautilus and Biosig. As we have\nexplained, the Federal Circuit invoked a standard more\namorphous than the statutory definiteness requirement\nallows. We therefore follow our ordinary practice of re\u00ad\nmanding so that the Court of Appeals can reconsider,\nunder the proper standard, whether the relevant claims in\nthe \u2019753 patent are sufficiently definite. See, e.g., Johnson\nv. California, 543 U. S. 499, 515 (2005); Gasperini v. Cen-\nter for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.
