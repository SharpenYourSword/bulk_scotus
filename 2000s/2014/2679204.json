FLORIDA\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA\n\n     No. 12\u201310882.       Argued March 3, 2014 \u2014Decided May 27, 2014\nAfter this Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\n  forbid the execution of persons with intellectual disability, see Atkins\n  v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 321, Hall asked a Florida state court to va-\n  cate his sentence, presenting evidence that included an IQ test score\n  of 71. The court denied his motion, determining that a Florida stat-\n  ute mandated that he show an IQ score of 70 or below before being\n  permitted to present any additional intellectual disability evidence.\n  The State Supreme Court rejected Hall\u2019s appeal, finding the State\u2019s\n  70-point threshold constitutional.\nHeld: The State\u2019s threshold requirement, as interpreted by the Florida\n Supreme Court, is unconstitutional. Pp. 5\u201322.\n    (a) The Eighth Amendment, which \u201creaffirms the duty of the gov-\n ernment to respect the dignity of all persons,\u201d Roper v. Simmons, 543\n U. S. 551, 560, prohibits the execution of persons with intellectual\n disability. No legitimate penological purpose is served by executing\n the intellectually disabled. Atkins, 563 U. S., at 317, 320. Prohibit-\n ing such executions also protects the integrity of the trial process for\n individuals who face \u201ca special risk of wrongful execution\u201d because\n they are more likely to give false confessions, are often poor witness-\n es, and are less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel.\n Id., at 320\u2013321. In determining whether Florida\u2019s intellectual disa-\n bility definition implements these principles and Atkins\u2019 holding, it is\n proper to consider the psychiatric and professional studies that elab-\n orate on the purpose and meaning of IQ scores and how the scores re-\n late to Atkins, and to consider how the several States have imple-\n mented Atkins. Pp. 5\u20137.\n    (b) Florida\u2019s rule disregards established medical practice. On its\n face, Florida\u2019s statute could be consistent with the views of the medi-\n cal community discussed in Atkins and with the conclusions reached\n2                            HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    here. It defines intellectual disability as the existence of concurrent\n    deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning, long the defining\n    characteristic of intellectual disability. See Atkins, supra, at 308.\n    And nothing in the statute precludes Florida from considering an IQ\n    test\u2019s standard error of measurement (SEM), a statistical fact reflect-\n    ing the test\u2019s inherent imprecision and acknowledging that an indi-\n    vidual score is best understood as a range, e.g., five points on either\n    side of the recorded score. As interpreted by the Florida Supreme\n    Court, however, Florida\u2019s rule disregards established medical prac-\n    tice in two interrelated ways: It takes an IQ score as final and con-\n    clusive evidence of a defendant\u2019s intellectual capacity, when experts\n    would consider other evidence; and it relies on a purportedly scien-\n    tific measurement of a defendant\u2019s abilities, while refusing to recog-\n    nize that measurement\u2019s inherent imprecision. While professionals\n    have long agreed that IQ test scores should be read as a range, Flori-\n    da uses the test score as a fixed number, thus barring further consid-\n    eration of other relevant evidence, e.g., deficits in adaptive function-\n    ing, including evidence of past performance, environment, and\n    upbringing. Pp. 7\u201312.\n       (c) The rejection of a strict 70-point cutoff in the vast majority of\n    States and a \u201cconsistency in the trend,\u201d Roper, supra, at 567, toward\n    recognizing the SEM provide strong evidence of consensus that socie-\n    ty does not regard this strict cutoff as proper or humane. At most,\n    nine States mandate a strict IQ score cutoff at 70. Thus, in 41\n    States, an individual in Hall\u2019s position would not be deemed automat-\n    ically eligible for the death penalty. The direction of change has been\n    consistent. Since Atkins, many States have passed legislation to\n    comply with the constitutional requirement that persons with intel-\n    lectual disability not be executed. Two of those States appear to set a\n    strict cutoff at 70, but at least 11 others have either abolished the\n    death penalty or passed legislation allowing defendants to present\n    additional intellectual disability evidence when their IQ score is\n    above 70. Every state legislature, save one, to have considered the\n    issue after Atkins and whose law has been interpreted by its courts\n    has taken a position contrary to Florida\u2019s. Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (d) Atkins acknowledges the inherent error in IQ testing and pro-\n    vides substantial guidance on the definition of intellectual disability.\n    The States play a critical role in advancing the protections of Atkins\n    and providing this Court with an understanding of how intellectual\n    disability should be measured and assessed, but Atkins did not give\n    them unfettered discretion to define the full scope of the constitution-\n    al protection. Clinical definitions for intellectual disability which, by\n    their express terms, rejected a strict IQ test score cutoff at 70, and\n    which have long included the SEM, were a fundamental premise of\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Atkins. See 536 U. S., at 309, nn. 3, 5. A fleeting mention of Florida\n  in a citation listing States that had outlawed the execution of the in-\n  tellectually disabled, id., at 315, did not signal the Atkins Court\u2019s ap-\n  proval of the State\u2019s current understanding of its law, which had not\n  yet been interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court to require a strict\n  70-point cutoff. Pp. 16\u201319.\n    (e) When a defendant\u2019s IQ test score falls within the test\u2019s\n  acknowledged and inherent margin of error, the defendant must be\n  able to present additional evidence of intellectual disability, including\n  testimony regarding adaptive deficits. This legal determination of in-\n  tellectual disability is distinct from a medical diagnosis but is in-\n  formed by the medical community\u2019s diagnostic framework, which is of\n  particular help here, where no alternative intellectual disability defi-\n  nition is presented, and where this Court and the States have placed\n  substantial reliance on the medical profession\u2019s expertise.

FLORIDA\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF \n\n                       FLORIDA\n\n                                 [May 27, 2014] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This Court has held that the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution forbid the execution of\npersons with intellectual disability. Atkins v. Virginia,\n536 U. S. 304, 321 (2002). Florida law defines intellectual\ndisability to require an IQ test score of 70 or less. If, from\ntest scores, a prisoner is deemed to have an IQ above 70,\nall further exploration of intellectual disability is fore\u00ad\nclosed. This rigid rule, the Court now holds, creates an\nunacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability\nwill be executed, and thus is unconstitutional.\n                            I\n  On February 21, 1978, Freddie Lee Hall, petitioner here,\nand his accomplice, Mark Ruffin, kidnaped, beat, raped,\nand murdered Karol Hurst, a pregnant, 21-year-old new\u00ad\nlywed. Afterward, Hall and Ruffin drove to a convenience\nstore they planned to rob. In the parking lot of the store,\nthey killed Lonnie Coburn, a sheriff\u2019s deputy who at\u00ad\ntempted to apprehend them. Hall received the death\npenalty for both murders, although his sentence for the\nCoburn murder was later reduced on account of insuffi\u00ad\ncient evidence of premeditation. Hall v. Florida, 403\n2                     HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSo. 2d 1319, 1321 (Fla. 1981) (per curiam).\n   Hall argues that he cannot be executed because of his\nintellectual disability. Previous opinions of this Court\nhave employed the term \u201cmental retardation.\u201d This opin\u00ad\nion uses the term \u201cintellectual disability\u201d to describe the\nidentical phenomenon. See Rosa\u2019s Law, 124 Stat. 2643\n(changing entries in the U. S. Code from \u201cmental retarda\u00ad\ntion\u201d to \u201cintellectual disability\u201d); Schalock et. al, The Re\u00ad\nnaming of Mental Retardation: Understanding the Change\nto the Term Intellectual Disability, 45 Intellectual & De\u00ad\nvelopmental Disabilities 116 (2007). This change in ter\u00ad\nminology is approved and used in the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\none of the basic texts used by psychiatrists and other\nexperts; the manual is often referred to by its initials\n\u201cDSM,\u201d followed by its edition number, e.g., \u201cDSM\u20135.\u201d See\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statisti\u00ad\ncal Manual of Mental Disorders 33 (5th ed. 2013).\n   When Hall was first sentenced, this Court had not yet\nruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits States from\nimposing the death penalty on persons with intellectual\ndisability. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 340\n(1989). And at the time, Florida law did not consider\nintellectual disability as a statutory mitigating factor.\n   After this Court held that capital defendants must be\npermitted to present nonstatutory mitigating evidence in\ndeath penalty proceedings, Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S.\n393, 398\u2013399 (1987), Hall was resentenced. Hall then\npresented substantial and unchallenged evidence of intel\u00ad\nlectual disability. School records indicated that his teach\u00ad\ners identified him on numerous occasions as \u201c[m]entally\nretarded.\u201d App. 482\u2013483. Hall had been prosecuted for a\ndifferent, earlier crime. His lawyer in that matter later\ntestified that the lawyer \u201c[c]ouldn\u2019t really understand\nanything [Hall] said.\u201d Id., at 480. And, with respect to the\nmurder trial given him in this case, Hall\u2019s counsel recalled\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Hall could not assist in his own defense because he\nhad \u201c \u2018a mental . . . level much lower than his age,\u2019 \u201d at best\ncomparable to the lawyer\u2019s 4-year-old daughter. Brief for\nPetitioner 11. A number of medical clinicians testified\nthat, in their professional opinion, Hall was \u201csignificantly\nretarded,\u201d App. 507; was \u201cmentally retarded,\u201d id., at 517;\nand had levels of understanding \u201ctypically [seen] with\ntoddlers,\u201d id., at 523.\n   As explained below in more detail, an individual\u2019s abil\u00ad\nity or lack of ability to adapt or adjust to the requirements\nof daily life, and success or lack of success in doing so, is\ncentral to the framework followed by psychiatrists and\nother professionals in diagnosing intellectual disability.\nSee DSM\u20135, at 37. Hall\u2019s siblings testified that there was\nsomething \u201cvery wrong\u201d with him as a child. App. 466.\nHall was \u201cslow with speech and . . . slow to learn.\u201d Id., at\n490. He \u201cwalked and talked long after his other brothers\nand sisters,\u201d id., at 461, and had \u201cgreat difficulty forming\nhis words,\u201d id., at 467.\n   Hall\u2019s upbringing appeared to make his deficits in adap\u00ad\ntive functioning all the more severe. Hall was raised\u2014in\nthe words of the sentencing judge\u2014\u201cunder the most horri\u00ad\nble family circumstances imaginable.\u201d Id., at 53. Al\u00ad\nthough \u201c[t]eachers and siblings alike immediately recog\u00ad\nnized [Hall] to be significantly mentally retarded . . . [t]his\nretardation did not garner any sympathy from his mother,\nbut rather caused much scorn to befall him.\u201d Id., at 20.\nHall was \u201c[c]onstantly beaten because he was \u2018slow\u2019 or\nbecause he made simple mistakes.\u201d Ibid. His mother\n\u201cwould strap [Hall] to his bed at night, with a rope thrown\nover a rafter. In the morning, she would awaken Hall by\nhoisting him up and whipping him with a belt, rope, or\ncord.\u201d Ibid. Hall was beaten \u201cten or fifteen times a week\nsometimes.\u201d Id., at 477. His mother tied him \u201cin a \u2018croaker\u2019\nsack, swung it over a fire, and beat him,\u201d \u201cburied him\nin the sand up to his neck to \u2018strengthen his legs,\u2019 \u201d and\n4                     HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cheld a gun on Hall . . . while she poked [him] with sticks.\u201d\nHall v. Florida, 614 So. 2d 473, 480 (Fla. 1993) (Barkett,\nC. J., dissenting).\n   The jury, notwithstanding this testimony, voted to\nsentence Hall to death, and the sentencing court adopted\nthe jury\u2019s recommendation. The court found that there\nwas \u201csubstantial evidence in the record\u201d to support the\nfinding that \u201cFreddie Lee Hall has been mentally retarded\nhis entire life.\u201d App. 46. Yet the court also \u201csuspect[ed]\nthat the defense experts [were] guilty of some professional\noverkill,\u201d because \u201c[n]othing of which the experts testified\ncould explain how a psychotic, mentally-retarded, brain\u00ad\ndamaged, learning-disabled, speech-impaired person could\nformulate a plan whereby a car was stolen and a conven\u00ad\nience store was robbed.\u201d Id., at 42. The sentencing court\nwent on to state that, even assuming the expert testimony\nto be accurate, \u201cthe learning disabilities, mental retarda\u00ad\ntion, and other mental difficulties . . . cannot be used to\njustify, excuse or extenuate the moral culpability of the\ndefendant in this cause.\u201d Id., at 56. Hall was again sen\u00ad\ntenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed,\nconcluding that \u201cHall\u2019s argument that his mental retarda\u00ad\ntion provided a pretense of moral or legal justification\u201d\nhad \u201cno merit.\u201d Hall, 614 So. 2d, at 478. Chief Justice\nBarkett dissented, arguing that executing a person with\nintellectual disability violated the State Constitution\u2019s\nprohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Id., at 481\u2013\n482.\n   In 2002, this Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment\nprohibited the execution of persons with intellectual disa\u00ad\nbility. Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S., at 321. On November\n30, 2004, Hall filed a motion claiming that he had intellec\u00ad\ntual disability and could not be executed. More than five\nyears later, Florida held a hearing to consider Hall\u2019s mo\u00ad\ntion. Hall again presented evidence of intellectual disabil\u00ad\nity, including an IQ test score of 71. (Hall had received\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnine IQ evaluations in 40 years, with scores ranging from\n60 to 80, Brief for Respondent 8, but the sentencing court\nexcluded the two scores below 70 for evidentiary reasons,\nleaving only scores between 71 and 80. See App. 107; 109\nSo. 3d 704, 707 (Fla. 2012)). In response, Florida argued\nthat Hall could not be found intellectually disabled be\u00ad\ncause Florida law requires that, as a threshold matter,\nHall show an IQ test score of 70 or below before presenting\nany additional evidence of his intellectual disability. App.\n278\u2013279 (\u201c[U]nder the law, if an I. Q. is above 70, a person\nis not mentally retarded\u201d). The Florida Supreme Court\nrejected Hall\u2019s appeal and held that Florida\u2019s 70-point\nthreshold was constitutional. 109 So. 3d, at 707\u2013708.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 571 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                             II\n   The Eighth Amendment provides that \u201c[e]xcessive bail\nshall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor\ncruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d The Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment applies those restrictions to the\nStates. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 560 (2005);\nFurman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 239\u2013240 (1972) (per\ncuriam). \u201cBy protecting even those convicted of heinous\ncrimes, the Eighth Amendment reaffirms the duty of the\ngovernment to respect the dignity of all persons.\u201d Roper,\nsupra, at 560; see also Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100\n(1958) (plurality opinion) (\u201cThe basic concept underlying\nthe Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of\nman\u201d).\n   The Eighth Amendment \u201cis not fastened to the obsolete\nbut may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes en\u00ad\nlightened by a humane justice.\u201d Weems v. United States,\n217 U. S. 349, 378 (1910). To enforce the Constitution\u2019s\nprotection of human dignity, this Court looks to the \u201cevolv\u00ad\ning standards of decency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society.\u201d Trop, supra, at 101. The Eighth\n6                     HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAmendment\u2019s protection of dignity reflects the Nation we\nhave been, the Nation we are, and the Nation we aspire to\nbe. This is to affirm that the Nation\u2019s constant, unyielding\npurpose must be to transmit the Constitution so that its\nprecepts and guarantees retain their meaning and force.\n   The Eighth Amendment prohibits certain punishments\nas a categorical matter. No natural-born citizen may be\ndenaturalized. Ibid. No person may be sentenced to death\nfor a crime committed as a juvenile. Roper, supra, at 578.\nAnd, as relevant for this case, persons with intellectual\ndisability may not be executed. Atkins, 536 U. S., at 321.\n   No legitimate penological purpose is served by executing\na person with intellectual disability. Id., at 317, 320. To\ndo so contravenes the Eighth Amendment, for to impose\nthe harshest of punishments on an intellectually disabled\nperson violates his or her inherent dignity as a human\nbeing. \u201c[P]unishment is justified under one or more of\nthree principal rationales: rehabilitation, deterrence, and\nretribution.\u201d Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 420\n(2008). Rehabilitation, it is evident, is not an applicable\nrationale for the death penalty. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428\nU. S. 153, 183 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and\nStevens, JJ.). As for deterrence, those with intellectual\ndisability are, by reason of their condition, likely unable to\nmake the calculated judgments that are the premise for\nthe deterrence rationale. They have a \u201cdiminished ability\u201d\nto \u201cprocess information, to learn from experience, to en\u00ad\ngage in logical reasoning, or to control impulses . . .\n[which] make[s] it less likely that they can process the\ninformation of the possibility of execution as a penalty\nand, as a result, control their conduct based upon that\ninformation.\u201d Atkins, 536 U. S., at 320. Retributive val\u00ad\nues are also ill-served by executing those with intellectual\ndisability. The diminished capacity of the intellectually\ndisabled lessens moral culpability and hence the retribu\u00ad\ntive value of the punishment.

These persons face \u201ca special\nrisk of wrongful execution\u201d because they are more likely to\ngive false confessions, are often poor witnesses, and are\nless able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel.\nId., at 320\u2013321. This is not to say that under current law\npersons with intellectual disability who \u201cmeet the law\u2019s\nrequirements for criminal responsibility\u201d may not be tried\nand punished. Id., at 306. They may not, however, re\u00ad\nceive the law\u2019s most severe sentence. Id., at 318.\n   The question this case presents is how intellectual\ndisability must be defined in order to implement these\nprinciples and the holding of Atkins. To determine if\nFlorida\u2019s cutoff rule is valid, it is proper to consider the\npsychiatric and professional studies that elaborate on the\npurpose and meaning of IQ scores to determine how the\nscores relate to the holding of Atkins. This in turn leads to\na better understanding of how the legislative policies of\nvarious States, and the holdings of state courts, imple\u00ad\nment the Atkins rule. That understanding informs our\ndetermination whether there is a consensus that instructs\nhow to decide the specific issue presented here. And, in\nconclusion, this Court must express its own independent\ndetermination reached in light of the instruction found in\nthose sources and authorities.\n                            III\n\n                             A\n\n  That this Court, state courts, and state legislatures\nconsult and are informed by the work of medical experts in\ndetermining intellectual disability is unsurprising. Those\n8                     HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprofessionals use their learning and skills to study and\nconsider the consequences of the classification schemes\nthey devise in the diagnosis of persons with mental or\npsychiatric disorders or disabilities. Society relies upon\nmedical and professional expertise to define and explain\nhow to diagnose the mental condition at issue. And the\ndefinition of intellectual disability by skilled professionals\nhas implications far beyond the confines of the death\npenalty: for it is relevant to education, access to social\nprograms, and medical treatment plans. In determining\nwho qualifies as intellectually disabled, it is proper to\nconsult the medical community\u2019s opinions.\n   As the Court noted in Atkins, the medical community\ndefines intellectual disability according to three criteria:\nsignificantly subaverage intellectual functioning, deficits\nin adaptive functioning (the inability to learn basic skills\nand adjust behavior to changing circumstances), and onset\nof these deficits during the developmental period. See id.,\nat 308, n. 3; DSM\u20135, at 33; Brief for American Psychologi\u00ad\ncal Association et al. as Amici Curiae 12\u201313 (hereinafter\nAPA Brief). This last factor, referred to as \u201cage of onset,\u201d\nis not at issue.\n   The first and second criteria\u2014deficits in intellectual\nfunctioning and deficits in adaptive functioning\u2014are\ncentral here. In the context of a formal assessment, \u201c[t]he\nexistence of concurrent deficits in intellectual and adap\u00ad\ntive functioning has long been the defining characteristic\nof intellectual disability.\u201d Id., at 11.\n   On its face, the Florida statute could be consistent with\nthe views of the medical community noted and discussed\nin Atkins. Florida\u2019s statute defines intellectual disability\nfor purposes of an Atkins proceeding as \u201csignificantly\nsubaverage general intellectual functioning existing con\u00ad\ncurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested\nduring the period from conception to age 18.\u201d Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7921.137(1) (2013). The statute further defines \u201csignifi\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\u201d as\n\u201cperformance that is two or more standard deviations from\nthe mean score on a standardized intelligence test.\u201d Ibid.\nThe mean IQ test score is 100. The concept of standard\ndeviation describes how scores are dispersed in a popula\u00ad\ntion. Standard deviation is distinct from standard error of\nmeasurement, a concept which describes the reliability of\na test and is discussed further below. The standard devia\u00ad\ntion on an IQ test is approximately 15 points, and so two\nstandard deviations is approximately 30 points. Thus a\ntest taker who performs \u201ctwo or more standard deviations\nfrom the mean\u201d will score approximately 30 points below\nthe mean on an IQ test, i.e., a score of approximately 70\npoints.\n   On its face this statute could be interpreted consistently\nwith Atkins and with the conclusions this Court reaches in\nthe instant case. Nothing in the statute precludes Florida\nfrom taking into account the IQ test\u2019s standard error of\nmeasurement, and as discussed below there is evidence\nthat Florida\u2019s Legislature intended to include the meas\u00ad\nurement error in the calculation. But the Florida Su\u00ad\npreme Court has interpreted the provisions more nar\u00ad\nrowly. It has held that a person whose test score is above 70,\nincluding a score within the margin for measurement\nerror, does not have an intellectual disability and is barred\nfrom presenting other evidence that would show his facul\u00ad\nties are limited. See Cherry v. State, 959 So. 2d 702, 712\u2013\n713 (Fla. 2007) (per curiam). That strict IQ test score\ncutoff of 70 is the issue in this case.\n   Pursuant to this mandatory cutoff, sentencing courts\ncannot consider even substantial and weighty evidence of\nintellectual disability as measured and made manifest by\nthe defendant\u2019s failure or inability to adapt to his social\nand cultural environment, including medical histories,\nbehavioral records, school tests and reports, and testimony\nregarding past behavior and family circumstances. This is\n10                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nso even though the medical community accepts that all of\nthis evidence can be probative of intellectual disability,\nincluding for individuals who have an IQ test score above\n70. See APA Brief 15\u201316 (\u201c[T]he relevant clinical authori\u00ad\nties all agree that an individual with an IQ score above 70\nmay properly be diagnosed with intellectual disability if\nsignificant limitations in adaptive functioning also exist\u201d);\nDSM\u20135, at 37 (\u201c[A] person with an IQ score above 70 may\nhave such severe adaptive behavior problems . . . that the\nperson\u2019s actual functioning is comparable to that of indi\u00ad\nviduals with a lower IQ score\u201d).\n   Florida\u2019s rule disregards established medical practice in\ntwo interrelated ways. It takes an IQ score as final and\nconclusive evidence of a defendant\u2019s intellectual capacity,\nwhen experts in the field would consider other evidence.\nIt also relies on a purportedly scientific measurement of\nthe defendant\u2019s abilities, his IQ score, while refusing to\nrecognize that the score is, on its own terms, imprecise.\n   The professionals who design, administer, and interpret\nIQ tests have agreed, for years now, that IQ test scores\nshould be read not as a single fixed number but as a\nrange. See D. Wechsler, The Measurement of Adult Intel\u00ad\nligence 133 (3d ed. 1944) (reporting the range of error on\nan early IQ test). Each IQ test has a \u201cstandard error of\nmeasurement,\u201d ibid., often referred to by the abbreviation\n\u201cSEM.\u201d A test\u2019s SEM is a statistical fact, a reflection of\nthe inherent imprecision of the test itself. See R. Furr &\nV. Bacharach, Psychometrics 118 (2d ed. 2014) (identify\u00ad\ning the SEM as \u201cone of the most important concepts in\nmeasurement theory\u201d). An individual\u2019s IQ test score on\nany given exam may fluctuate for a variety of reasons.\nThese include the test-taker\u2019s health; practice from earlier\ntests; the environment or location of the test; the examin\u00ad\ner\u2019s demeanor; the subjective judgment involved in scoring\ncertain questions on the exam; and simple lucky guessing.\nSee American Association on Intellectual and Develop\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Kaufman, IQ\nTesting 101, pp. 138\u2013139 (2009).\n   The SEM reflects the reality that an individual\u2019s intel\u00ad\nlectual functioning cannot be reduced to a single numeri\u00ad\ncal score. For purposes of most IQ tests, the SEM means\nthat an individual\u2019s score is best understood as a range of\nscores on either side of the recorded score. The SEM\nallows clinicians to calculate a range within which one\nmay say an individual\u2019s true IQ score lies. See APA Brief\n23 (\u201cSEM is a unit of measurement: 1 SEM equates to a\nconfidence of 68% that the measured score falls within a\ngiven score range, while 2 SEM provides a 95% confidence\nlevel that the measured score is within a broader range\u201d).\nA score of 71, for instance, is generally considered to re\u00ad\nflect a range between 66 and 76 with 95% confidence and a\nrange of 68.5 and 73.5 with a 68% confidence. See DSM\u2013\n5, at 37 (\u201cIndividuals with intellectual disability have\nscores of approximately two standard deviations or more\nbelow the population mean, including a margin for meas\u00ad\nurement error (generally +5 points). . . . [T]his involves a\nscore of 65\u201375 (70 \u00b1 5)\u201d); APA Brief 23 (\u201cFor example, the\naverage SEM for the WAIS-IV is 2.16 IQ test points and\nthe average SEM for the Stanford-Binet 5 is 2.30 IQ test\npoints (test manuals report SEMs by different age group\u00ad\nings; these scores are similar, but not identical, often due\nto sampling error)\u201d). Even when a person has taken mul\u00ad\ntiple tests, each separate score must be assessed using the\nSEM, and the analysis of multiple IQ scores jointly is a\ncomplicated endeavor. See Schneider, Principles of As\u00ad\nsessment of Aptitude and Achievement, in The Oxford\nHandbook of Child Psychological Assessment 286, 289\u2013\n291, 318 (D. Saklofske, C. Reynolds, V. Schwean, eds.\n2013). In addition, because the test itself may be flawed,\n12                   HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor administered in a consistently flawed manner, multiple\nexaminations may result in repeated similar scores, so\nthat even a consistent score is not conclusive evidence of\nintellectual functioning.\n  Despite these professional explanations, Florida law\nused the test score as a fixed number, thus barring further\nconsideration of other evidence bearing on the question of\nintellectual disability. For professionals to diagnose\u2014and\nfor the law then to determine\u2014whether an intellectual\ndisability exists once the SEM applies and the individual\u2019s\nIQ score is 75 or below the inquiry would consider factors\nindicating whether the person had deficits in adaptive\nfunctioning. These include evidence of past performance,\nenvironment, and upbringing.\n                               B\n   A significant majority of States implement the protec\u00ad\ntions of Atkins by taking the SEM into account, thus\nacknowledging the error inherent in using a test score\nwithout necessary adjustment. This calculation provides\n\u201cobjective indicia of society\u2019s standards\u201d in the context of\nthe Eighth Amendment. Roper, 543 U. S., at 563. Only\nthe Kentucky and Virginia Legislatures have adopted a\nfixed score cutoff identical to Florida\u2019s. Ky. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a7532.130(2) (Lexis Supp. 2013); Bowling v.

See\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013753(F) (West 2013); Del. Code\nAnn. Tit. 11, \u00a74209(d)(3) (2012 Supp.); Kan. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a776\u201312b01 (2013 Supp.); N. C. Gen. Stat.

Code \u00a710.95.030(2)(c) (2012).\nThat these state laws might be interpreted to require a\nbright-line cutoff does not mean that they will be so inter\u00ad\npreted, however. See, e.g., State v. Vela, 279 Neb. 94, 126,\n137, 777 N. W. 2d 266, 292, 299 (2010) (Although Nebras\u00ad\nka\u2019s statute specifies \u201c[a]n intelligence quotient of seventy\nor below on a reliably administered intelligence quotient\ntest,\u201d \u201c[t]he district court found that [the defendant\u2019s]\nscore of 75 on the [IQ test], considered in light of the\nstandard error of measurement, could be considered as\nsubaverage general intellectual functioning for purposes of\ndiagnosing mental retardation\u201d).\n  Arizona\u2019s statute appears to set a broad statutory cutoff\nat 70, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013753(F) (West 2013), but\nanother provision instructs courts to \u201ctake into account\nthe margin of error for a test administered.\u201d Id. at \u00a714\u00ad\n753(K)(5). How courts are meant to interpret the statute\nin a situation like Hall\u2019s is not altogether clear. The prin\u00ad\ncipal Arizona case on the matter, State v. Roque, 141 P. 3d\n368, (Ariz 2006), states that \u201cthe statute accounts for\nmargin of error by requiring multiple tests,\u201d and that \u201cif\nthe defendant achieves a full-scale score of 70 or below on\nany one of the tests, then the court proceeds to a hearing.\u201d\nId. at 403. But that case also notes that the defendant\nhad an IQ score of 80, well outside the margin of error,\nand that all but one of the sub-parts of the IQ test were\n\u201cabove 75.\u201d Id.\n  Kansas has not had an execution in almost five decades,\n14                   HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand so its laws and jurisprudence on this issue are unlikely\nto receive attention on this specific question. See Atkins,\n536 U. S., at 316 (\u201c[E]ven in those States that allow the\nexecution of mentally retarded offenders, the practice\nis uncommon. Some States . . . continue to authorize\nexecutions, but none have been carried out in decades.\nThus there is little need to pursue legislation barring the\nexecution of the mentally retarded in those States\u201d).\nDelaware has executed three individuals in the past dec\u00ad\nade, while Washington has executed one person, and has\nrecently suspended its death penalty. None of the four\nindividuals executed recently in those States appears to\nhave brought a claim similar to that advanced here.\n   Thus, at most nine States mandate a strict IQ score\ncutoff at 70. Of these, four States (Delaware, Kansas,\nNorth Carolina, and Washington) appear not to have\nconsidered the issue in their courts. On the other side of\nthe ledger stand the 18 States that have abolished the\ndeath penalty, either in full or for new offenses, and Ore\u00ad\ngon, which has suspended the death penalty and executed\nonly two individuals in the past 40 years. See Roper, 543\nU. S., at 574 (\u201c[The] Court should have considered those\nStates that had abandoned the death penalty altogether as\npart of the consensus against the juvenile death penalty\u201d).\nIn those States, of course, a person in Hall\u2019s position\ncould not be executed even without a finding of intellectual\ndisability. Thus in 41 States an individual in Hall\u2019s\nposition\u2014an individual with an IQ score of 71\u2014would not\nbe deemed automatically eligible for the death penalty.\n   These aggregate numbers are not the only considera\u00ad\ntions bearing on a determination of consensus. Consistency\nof the direction of change is also relevant. See id., at\n565\u2013566 (quoting Atkins, supra, at 315). Since Atkins,\nmany States have passed legislation to comply with the\nconstitutional requirement that persons with intellectual\ndisability not be executed. Two of these States, Virginia\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand Delaware, appear to set a strict cutoff at 70, although\nas discussed, Delaware\u2019s courts have yet to interpret the\nlaw. In contrast, at least 11 States have either abolished\nthe death penalty or passed legislation allowing defend\u00ad\nants to present additional evidence of intellectual disabil\u00ad\nity when their IQ test score is above 70.\n   Since Atkins, five States have abolished the death pen\u00ad\nalty through legislation. See 2012 Conn. Pub. Acts no. 12\u2013\n5; Ill. Comp. Stat. ch. 725, \u00a7119\u20131 (West 2012); Md. Cor\u00ad\nrec. Servs. Code Ann. \u00a73\u2013901 et seq. (Lexis 2008); N. J.\nStat.

In addition, the New York Court of\nAppeals invalidated New York\u2019s death penalty under the\nState Constitution in 2004, see People v. LeValle, 3 N. Y.\n3d 88, 817 N. E. 2d 341 (2004), and legislation has not\nbeen passed to reinstate it. And when it did impose the\ndeath penalty, New York did not employ an IQ cutoff in\ndetermining intellectual disability. N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law\nAnn. \u00a7400.27(12)(e) (West 2005).\n   In addition to these States, at least five others have\npassed legislation allowing a defendant to present addi\u00ad\ntional evidence of intellectual disability even when an IQ\ntest score is above 70. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a71376\n(West Supp. 2014) (no IQ cutoff); Idaho Code \u00a719\u20132515A\n(Lexis Supp. 2013) (\u201cseventy (70) or below\u201d); Pizzutto v.\nState, 146 Idaho 720, 729, 202 P. 3d 642, 651 (2008) (\u201cThe\nalleged error in IQ testing is plus or minus five points.\nThe district court was entitled to draw reasonable infer\u00ad\nences from the undisputed facts\u201d); La.

The U. S. Code\nlikewise does not set a strict IQ cutoff. See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73596(c). And no State that previously allowed defendants\nwith an IQ score over 70 to present additional evidence of\nintellectual disability has modified its law to create a\n16                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstrict cutoff at 70. Cf. Roper, supra, at 566 (\u201cSince Stan-\nford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361 (1989), no State that previ\u00ad\nously prohibited capital punishment for juveniles has\nreinstated it\u201d).\n  In summary, every state legislature to have considered\nthe issue after Atkins\u2014save Virginia\u2019s\u2014and whose law\nhas been interpreted by its courts has taken a position\ncontrary to that of Florida. Indeed, the Florida Legisla\u00ad\nture, which passed the relevant legislation prior to Atkins,\nmight well have believed that its law would not create\na fixed cutoff at 70. The staff analysis accompanying\nthe 2001 bill states that it \u201cdoes not contain a set IQ\nlevel . . . . Two standard deviations from these tests is ap\u00ad\nproximately a 70 IQ, although it can be extended up to\n75.\u201d Fla. Senate Staff Analysis and Economic Impact\nStatement, CS/SB 238, p. 11 (Feb. 14, 2001). But the\nFlorida Supreme Court interpreted the law to require a\nbright-line cutoff at 70, see Cherry, 959 So. 2d, at 712\u2013713,\nand the Court is bound by that interpretation.\n  The rejection of the strict 70 cutoff in the vast majority\nof States and the \u201cconsistency in the trend,\u201d Roper, supra,\nat 567, toward recognizing the SEM provide strong evi\u00ad\ndence of consensus that our society does not regard this\nstrict cutoff as proper or humane.\n                              C\n  Atkins itself acknowledges the inherent error in IQ\ntesting. It is true that Atkins \u201cdid not provide definitive\nprocedural or substantive guides for determining when a\nperson who claims mental retardation\u201d falls within the\nprotection of the Eighth Amendment. Bobby v. Bies, 556\nU. S. 825, 831 (2009). \tIn Atkins, the Court stated:\n     \u201cNot all people who claim to be mentally retarded will\n     be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally\n     retarded offenders about whom there is a national\n     consensus.

But\nAtkins did not give the States unfettered discretion to\ndefine the full scope of the constitutional protection.\n   The Atkins Court twice cited definitions of intellectual\ndisability which, by their express terms, rejected a strict\nIQ test score cutoff at 70. Atkins first cited the definition\nprovided in the DSM\u2013IV: \u201c \u2018Mild\u2019 mental retardation is\ntypically used to describe people with an IQ level of 50\u201355\nto approximately 70.\u201d 536 U.

The Court later noted that \u201c \u2018an IQ between 70\nand 75 or lower . . . is typically considered the cutoff IQ\nscore for the intellectual function prong of the mental\nretardation definition.\u2019 \u201d 536 U. S., at 309, n. 5. Further\u00ad\nmore, immediately after the Court declared that it left \u201c \u2018to\nthe States the task of developing appropriate ways to\nenforce the constitutional restriction,\u2019 \u201d id., at 317, the\nCourt stated in an accompanying footnote that \u201c[t]he\n[state] statutory definitions of mental retardation are not\nidentical, but generally conform to the clinical definitions,\u201d\nibid.\n   Thus Atkins itself not only cited clinical definitions for\nintellectual disability but also noted that the States\u2019\nstandards, on which the Court based its own conclusion,\nconformed to those definitions. In the words of Atkins,\nthose persons who meet the \u201cclinical definitions\u201d of intel\u00ad\n18                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlectual disability \u201cby definition . . . have diminished capac\u00ad\nities to understand and process information, to communi\u00ad\ncate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience,\nto engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to\nunderstand the reactions of others.\u201d Id., at 318. Thus,\nthey bear \u201cdiminish[ed] . . . personal culpability.\u201d Ibid.\nThe clinical definitions of intellectual disability, which\ntake into account that IQ scores represent a range, not a\nfixed number, were a fundamental premise of Atkins. And\nthose clinical definitions have long included the SEM. See\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 28\n(rev. 3d ed. 1987) (\u201cSince any measurement is fallible, an\nIQ score is generally thought to involve an error of meas\u00ad\nurement of approximately five points; hence, an IQ of 70 is\nconsidered to represent a band or zone of 65 to 75. Treat\u00ad\ning the IQ with some flexibility permits inclusion in the\nMental Retardation category of people with IQs somewhat\nhigher than 70 who exhibit significant deficits in adaptive\nbehavior\u201d).\n   Respondent argues that the current Florida law was\nfavorably cited by the Atkins Court. See Brief for Re\u00ad\nspondent 18 (\u201cAs evidence of the national consensus, the\nCourt specifically cited Florida\u2019s statute at issue here,\nwhich has not substantively changed\u201d). While Atkins did\nrefer to Florida\u2019s law in a citation listing States which had\noutlawed the execution of the intellectually disabled, 536\nU. S., at 315, that fleeting mention did not signal the\nCourt\u2019s approval of Florida\u2019s current understanding of the\nlaw. As discussed above, when Atkins was decided the\nFlorida Supreme Court had not yet interpreted the law to\nrequire a strict IQ cutoff at 70. That new interpretation\nruns counter to the clinical definition cited throughout\nAtkins and to Florida\u2019s own legislative report indicating\nthis kind of cutoff need not be used.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument also conflicts with the logic of\nAtkins and the Eighth Amendment. If the States were to\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as\nthey wished, the Court\u2019s decision in Atkins could become a\nnullity, and the Eighth Amendment\u2019s protection of human\ndignity would not become a reality. This Court thus reads\nAtkins to provide substantial guidance on the definition of\nintellectual disability.\n                              D\n  The actions of the States and the precedents of this\nCourt \u201cgive us essential instruction,\u201d Roper, 543 U. S., at\n564, but the inquiry must go further. \u201c[T]he Constitution\ncontemplates that in the end our own judgment will be\nbrought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the\ndeath penalty under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Coker v.\nGeorgia, 433 U. S. 584, 597 (1977) (plurality opinion).\nThat exercise of independent judgment is the Court\u2019s\njudicial duty. See Roper, supra, at 574 (\u201c[T]o the extent\nStanford was based on a rejection of the idea that this\nCourt is required to bring its independent judgment to\nbear on the proportionality of the death penalty for a\nparticular class of crimes or offenders, it suffices to note\nthat this rejection was inconsistent with prior Eighth\nAmendment decisions\u201d (citation omitted).\n  In this Court\u2019s independent judgment, the Florida stat\u00ad\nute, as interpreted by its courts, is unconstitutional.\n  In addition to the views of the States and the Court\u2019s\nprecedent, this determination is informed by the views of\nmedical experts. These views do not dictate the Court\u2019s\ndecision, yet the Court does not disregard these informed\nassessments. See Kansas v. Crane, 534 U. S. 407, 413\n(2002) (\u201c[T]he science of psychiatry . . . informs but does\nnot control ultimate legal determinations . . .\u201d). It is the\nCourt\u2019s duty to interpret the Constitution, but it need not\ndo so in isolation. The legal determination of intellectual\ndisability is distinct from a medical diagnosis, but it is\ninformed by the medical community\u2019s diagnostic frame\u00ad\n20                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwork. Atkins itself points to the diagnostic criteria em\u00ad\nployed by psychiatric professionals. And the professional\ncommunity\u2019s teachings are of particular help in this case,\nwhere no alternative definition of intellectual disability is\npresented and where this Court and the States have\nplaced substantial reliance on the expertise of the medical\nprofession.\n   By failing to take into account the SEM and setting a\nstrict cutoff at 70, Florida \u201cgoes against the unanimous\nprofessional consensus.\u201d APA Brief 15. Neither Florida\nnor its amici point to a single medical professional who\nsupports this cutoff. The DSM\u20135 repudiates it: \u201cIQ test\nscores are approximations of conceptual functioning but\nmay be insufficient to assess reasoning in real-life situa\u00ad\ntions and mastery of practical tasks.\u201d DSM\u20135, at 37. This\nstatement well captures the Court\u2019s independent assess\u00ad\nment that an individual with an IQ test score \u201cbetween 70\nand 75 or lower,\u201d Atkins, supra, at 309, n. 5, may show\nintellectual disability by presenting additional evidence\nregarding difficulties in adaptive functioning.\n   The flaws in Florida\u2019s law are the result of the inherent\nerror in IQ tests themselves. An IQ score is an approxi\u00ad\nmation, not a final and infallible assessment of intellectual\nfunctioning. See APA Brief 24 (\u201c[I]t is standard pyscho\u00ad\nmetric practice to report the \u2018estimates of relevant reliabil\u00ad\nities and standard errors of measurement\u2019 when reporting\na test score\u201d); ibid.

See\nDSM\u20135, at 37. Courts must recognize, as does the medical\ncommunity, that the IQ test is imprecise. This is not to\nsay that an IQ test score is unhelpful. It is of considerable\nsignificance, as the medical community recognizes. But in\nusing these scores to assess a defendant\u2019s eligibility for the\ndeath penalty, a State must afford these test scores the\nsame studied skepticism that those who design and use\nthe tests do, and understand that an IQ test score repre\u00ad\nsents a range rather than a fixed number. A State that\nignores the inherent imprecision of these tests risks exe\u00ad\ncuting a person who suffers from intellectual disability.\nSee APA Brief 17 (\u201cUnder the universally accepted clinical\nstandards for diagnosing intellectual disability, the court\u2019s\ndetermination that Mr. Hall is not intellectually disabled\ncannot be considered valid\u201d).\n   This Court agrees with the medical experts that when a\ndefendant\u2019s IQ test score falls within the test\u2019s acknowl\u00ad\nedged and inherent margin of error, the defendant must\nbe able to present additional evidence of intellectual disa\u00ad\nbility, including testimony regarding adaptive deficits.\n   It is not sound to view a single factor as dispositive of a\nconjunctive and interrelated assessment. See DSM\u20135, at\n37 (\u201c[A] person with an IQ score above 70 may have such\nsevere adaptive behavior problems . . . that the person\u2019s\nactual functioning is comparable to that of individuals\nwith a lower IQ score\u201d). The Florida statute, as interpreted\nby its courts, misuses IQ score on its own terms; and\n22                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthis, in turn, bars consideration of evidence that must be\nconsidered in determining whether a defendant in a capi\u00ad\ntal case has intellectual disability. Florida\u2019s rule is invalid\nunder the Constitution\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishments\nClause.\n                               E\n   Florida seeks to execute a man because he scored a 71\ninstead of 70 on an IQ test. Florida is one of just a few\nStates to have this rigid rule. Florida\u2019s rule misconstrues\nthe Court\u2019s statements in Atkins that intellectually dis\u00ad\nability is characterized by an IQ of \u201capproximately 70.\u201d 536\nU. S., at 308, n. 3. Florida\u2019s rule is in direct opposition to\nthe views of those who design, administer, and interpret\nthe IQ test. By failing to take into account the standard\nerror of measurement, Florida\u2019s law not only contradicts\nthe test\u2019s own design but also bars an essential part of a\nsentencing court\u2019s inquiry into adaptive functioning.\nFreddie Lee Hall may or may not be intellectually dis\u00ad\nabled, but the law requires that he have the opportunity to\npresent evidence of his intellectual disability, including\ndeficits in adaptive functioning over his lifetime.\n   The death penalty is the gravest sentence our society\nmay impose. Persons facing that most severe sanction\nmust have a fair opportunity to show that the Constitution\nprohibits their execution. Florida\u2019s law contravenes our\nNation\u2019s commitment to dignity and its duty to teach\nhuman decency as the mark of a civilized world. The\nStates are laboratories for experimentation, but those\nexperiments may not deny the basic dignity the Constitu\u00ad\ntion protects.\n   The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.\n                                                   So ordered.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), the Court\nheld that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a death sen\u00ad\ntence for defendants who are intellectually disabled but\ndoes not mandate the use of a single method for identify\u00ad\ning such defendants. Today, the Court overrules the latter\nholding based largely on the positions adopted by private\nprofessional associations. In taking this step, the Court\nsharply departs from the framework prescribed in prior\nEighth Amendment cases and adopts a uniform national\nrule that is both conceptually unsound and likely to result\nin confusion. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  The Court\u2019s approach in this case marks a new and most\nunwise turn in our Eighth Amendment case law. In At-\nkins and other cases, the Court held that the prohibition of\ncruel and unusual punishment embodies the \u201cevolving\nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing\nsociety,\u201d and the Court explained that \u201cthose evolving\nstandards should be informed by objective factors to the\nmaximum possible extent.\u201d Id., at 312 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In addition, the Court \u201cpinpointed that\nthe clearest and most reliable objective evidence of con\u00ad\ntemporary values is the legislation enacted by the coun\u00ad\n2                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntry\u2019s legislatures.\u201d Ibid.\n  In these prior cases, when the Court referred to the\nevolving standards of a maturing \u201csociety,\u201d the Court\nmeant the standards of American society as a whole. Now,\nhowever, the Court strikes down a state law based on the\nevolving standards of professional societies, most notably\nthe American Psychiatric Association (APA). The Court\nbegins its analysis with the views of those associations,\nsee ante, at 7\u201312, and then, after briefly discussing the\nenactments of state legislatures, see ante, at 12\u201316, re\u00ad\nturns to the associations\u2019 views in interpreting Atkins and\nin exercising the Court\u2019s \u201cindependent judgment\u201d on the\nconstitutionality of Florida\u2019s law, see ante, at 16\u201322. This\napproach cannot be reconciled with the framework pre\u00ad\nscribed by our Eighth Amendment cases.\n                              A\n   Under this Court\u2019s modern Eighth Amendment prece\u00ad\ndents, whether a punishment is \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d de\u00ad\npends on currently prevailing societal norms, and the\nCourt has long held that laws enacted by state legislatures\nprovide the \u201cclearest and most reliable objective evidence\nof contemporary values,\u201d Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302,\n331 (1989). This is so because \u201cin a democratic society[,]\nlegislatures, not courts, are constituted to respond to the\nwill and consequently the moral values of the people,\u201d\nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 175\u2013176 (1976) (joint\nopinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Under this approach, as origi\u00ad\nnally conceived, the Court first asked whether a chal\u00ad\nlenged practice contravened a clear national consensus\nevidenced by state legislation, and only if such a consen\u00ad\nsus was found would the Court go on and ask \u201cwhether\nthere is reason to disagree with [the States\u2019] judgment.\u201d\nAtkins, 536 U.

See id., at 315\u2013316.\nCritical to the Court\u2019s analysis was the conclusion that\n\u201ctoday our society views mentally retarded offenders as\ncategorically less culpable than the average criminal.\u201d Id.,\nat 316. \u201cThis consensus,\u201d the Court continued, \u201cunques\u00ad\ntionably reflects widespread judgment about . . . the rela\u00ad\ntionship between mental retardation and the penological\npurposes served by the death penalty.\u201d Id., at 317.\n   While Atkins identified a consensus against the execu\u00ad\ntion of the intellectually disabled, the Court observed that\nthere was \u201cserious disagreement\u201d among the States with\nrespect to the best method for \u201cdetermining which offend\u00ad\ners are in fact retarded.\u201d Ibid. The Court therefore \u201cle[ft]\nto the States the task of developing appropriate ways\u201d to\nidentify these defendants. Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nand alteration omitted). As we noted just five years ago,\nAtkins \u201cdid not provide definitive procedural or substan\u00ad\ntive guides for determining when a person\u201d is intellectually\ndisabled. Bobby v. Bies, 556 U. S. 825, 831 (2009).\n                              B\n  Consistent with the role that Atkins left for the States,\nFlorida follows the procedure now at issue. As we ex\u00ad\nplained in Atkins, in order for a defendant to qualify as\nintellectually disabled, three separate requirements must\nbe met: It must be shown that a defendant has both\n(1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and\n(2) deficits in adaptive behavior, and that (3) the onset of\nboth factors occurred before the age of 18. See 536 U. S.,\nat 318; ante, at 8. In implementing this framework, Flor\u00ad\nida has determined that the first requirement cannot be\nsatisfied if the defendant scores higher than 70 on IQ\ntests, the long-accepted method of measuring intellectual\n4                         HALL v.

The Court objects that\nFlorida\u2019s approach treats IQ test scores as conclusive and\nignores the fact that an IQ score might not reflect \u201ctrue\u201d\nIQ because of errors in measurement. The Court then\nconcludes that a State must view a defendant\u2019s IQ as a\nrange of potential scores calculated using a statistical\nconcept known as the \u201cstandard error of measurement\u201d or\nSEM. See Part II\u2013B\u20131, infra. The Court holds that if this\nrange includes an IQ of 70 or below (the accepted level for\nintellectual disability), the defendant must be permitted to\nproduce other evidence of intellectual disability in addition\nto IQ scores.\n  I see no support for this holding in our traditional ap\u00ad\nproach for identifying our society\u2019s evolving standards of\ndecency. Under any fair analysis of current state laws,\nthe same absence of a consensus that this Court found in\nAtkins persists today. It is telling that Hall himself does\nnot rely on a consensus among States. He candidly argues\ninstead that \u201cthe precise number of States that share\nFlorida\u2019s approach is immaterial.\u201d Reply Brief 2.\n  The Court\u2019s analysis is more aggressive. According to\nthe Court, a \u201csignificant majority of States\u201d reject Florida\u2019s\n\u201cstrict 70 cutoff \u201d and instead take \u201cthe SEM into account\u201d\nwhen deciding whether a defendant meets the first re\u00ad\nquirement of the intellectual-disability test. Ante, at 12,\n16. On the Court\u2019s count, \u201cat most nine States mandate a\nstrict IQ score cutoff at 70\u201d; 22 States allow defendants to\npresent \u201cadditional evidence\u201d when an individual\u2019s test\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 See, e.g., American Association of Intellectual and Developmental\n\nDisabilities (AAIDD), Intellectual Disability 10\u201311 (11th ed. 2010)\n(hereinafter AAIDD 11th ed.)

Two States have not defined \u201csignificantly subaverage\u201d intel\u00ad\nlectual functioning. See Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a718\u20131.3\u20131101(2) (2013);\nS. C.

Two States have statutes that impose rebuttable presump\u00ad\ntions of intellectual disability if a defendant\u2019s IQ is below 65 or 70 but\nhave not said whether a defendant would be allowed to provide further\nevidence if his IQ were over 70.

It is\ntrue that the Court has counted non-death-penalty States\nin some prior Eighth Amendment cases, but those cases\nconcerned the substantive question whether a class of\nindividuals should be categorically ineligible for the death\npenalty. In Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), for\nexample, the Court counted non-death-penalty States as\npart of the consensus against the imposition of a capital\nsentence for a crime committed by a minor. Id., at 574.\nThe Court reasoned that a State\u2019s decision to abolish the\ndeath penalty necessarily \u201cdemonstrates a judgment that\nthe death penalty is inappropriate for all offenders, includ\u00ad\ning juveniles.\u201d Ibid.\n  No similar reasoning is possible here. The fact that a\nState has abolished the death penalty says nothing about\nhow that State would resolve the evidentiary problem of\nidentifying defendants who are intellectually disabled. As\nI explain below, a State may reasonably conclude that\nFlorida\u2019s approach is fairer than and just as accurate as\nthe approach that the Court now requires, and therefore it\ncannot be inferred that a non-death-penalty State, if\nforced to choose between the two approaches, would neces\u00ad\nsarily select the Court\u2019s. For all these reasons, it is quite\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nmust prove deficits in adaptive behavior despite having an IQ below 70.\n\nSee Stripling v. State, 261 Ga. 1, 3, 401 S. E. 2d 500, 504 (1991). \n\nAnother State\u2019s Supreme Court mentioned the SEM in responding to \n\nan argument by the defendant, but it did not suggest that the SEM was\n\nlegally relevant. See Goodwin v. State, 191 S. W. 3d 20, 30\u201331, and n. 7 \n\n(Mo. 2006). \n\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

Ante, at 16.\n  Not only are the States divided on the question whether\nthe SEM should play a role in determining whether a\ncapital defendant is intellectually disabled, but the States\nthat require consideration of the SEM do not agree on the\nrole that the SEM should play. Those States differ, for\nexample, on the sort of evidence that can be introduced\nwhen IQ testing reveals an IQ over 70. Some require\nfurther evidence of intellectual deficits, while others per\u00ad\nmit the defendant to move on to the second prong of the\ntest and submit evidence of deficits in adaptive behavior.6\nThe fairest assessment of the current situation is that the\nStates have adopted a multitude of approaches to a very\ndifficult question.\n  In light of all this, the resolution of this case should be\nstraightforward: Just as there was no methodological\nconsensus among the States at the time of Atkins, there is\nno such consensus today. And in the absence of such a\nconsensus, we have no basis for holding that Florida\u2019s\nmethod contravenes our society\u2019s standards of decency.\n                            C\n   Perhaps because it recognizes the weakness of its argu\u00ad\nments about a true national consensus, the Court places\nheavy reliance on the views (some only recently an\u00ad\nnounced) of professional organizations, but the Court\nattempts to downplay the degree to which its decision is\ndependent upon the views of these private groups. In a\ngame attempt to shoehorn the views of these associations\ninto the national-consensus calculus, the Court reasons as\nfollows. The views of these associations, the Court states,\nhelp in determining \u201chow [IQ] scores relate to the holding\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Compare Ybarra v.

Under our modern\nEighth Amendment cases, what counts are our society\u2019s\nstandards\u2014which is to say, the standards of the American\npeople\u2014not the standards of professional associations,\nwhich at best represent the views of a small professional\nelite.\n   The Court also mistakenly suggests that its methodol\u00ad\nogy is dictated by Atkins. See ante, at 16\u201319. On the con-\ntrary, Atkins expressly left \u201cto the States\u201d the task of\ndefining intellectual disability. And although the Atkins\nCourt perceived a \u201cprofessional consensus\u201d about the best\nprocedure to be used in identifying the intellectually dis\u00ad\nabled, the Atkins Court declined to import that view into\nthe law. 536 U. S., at 316, n. 21. Instead, the Court made\nclear that this professional consensus was \u201cby no means\ndispositive.\u201d Id., at 317, n. 21; see id., at 317, and n. 22.\n                              D\n  The Court\u2019s reliance on the views of professional associ\u00ad\nations will also lead to serious practical problems. I will\nbriefly note a few.\n  First, because the views of professional associations\noften change,7 tying Eighth Amendment law to these\nviews will lead to instability and continue to fuel pro\u00ad\ntracted litigation. This danger is dramatically illustrated\nby the most recent publication of the APA, on which the\nCourt relies. This publication fundamentally alters the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See Forensic Psychology and Neuropsychology for Criminal and\n\nCivil Cases 57 (H.

In this new publication,\nthe APA discards \u201csignificantly subaverage intellectual\nfunctioning\u201d as an element of the intellectual-disability\ntest.8 Elevating the APA\u2019s current views to constitutional\nsignificance therefore throws into question the basic ap\u00ad\nproach that Atkins approved and that most of the States\nhave followed.\n   It is also noteworthy that changes adopted by profes\u00ad\nsional associations are sometimes rescinded. For example,\nin 1992 the AAIDD extended the baseline \u201cintellectual\nfunctioning cutoff \u201d from an \u201cIQ of 70 or below\u201d to a \u201cscore\nof approximately 70 to 75 or below.\u201d AAIDD 11th ed. 10\n(Table 1.3) (boldface deleted); see 2 Kaplan & Sadock\u2019s\nComprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 3449 (B. Sadock,\nV. Sadock, & P. Ruiz eds., 9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter\nKaplan & Sadock\u2019s). That change \u201cgenerated much con\u00ad\ntroversy\u201d; by 2000, \u201conly 4 states used the 1992 AAIDD\ndefinition, with 44 states continuing to use the 1983 defi\u00ad\nnition.\u201d Ibid. And in the 2002 AAIDD, the baseline \u201cIQ\ncut-off was changed\u201d back to approximately \u201c70 or less.\u201d\nIbid.\n   Second, the Court\u2019s approach implicitly calls upon the\nJudiciary either to follow every new change in the think\u00ad\ning of these professional organizations or to judge the\nvalidity of each new change. Here, for example, the Court\ntacitly makes the judgment that the diagnostic criteria for\nintellectual disability that prevailed at the time when\nAtkins was decided are no longer legitimate. The publica\u00ad\ntions that Atkins cited differ markedly from more recent\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Compare   APA, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor\u00ad\nders 39, 41, 42 (rev. 4th ed. 2000) (hereinafter DSM\u2013IV\u2013TR), with APA,\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 33, 809 (5th\ned. 2013) (hereinafter DSM\u20135).\n10                   HALL v.

S., at 308,\nn. 3.\n   Third, the Court\u2019s approach requires the Judiciary to\ndetermine which professional organizations are entitled to\nspecial deference. And what if professional organizations\ndisagree? The Court provides no guidance for deciding\nwhich organizations\u2019 views should govern.\n   Fourth, the Court binds Eighth Amendment law to\ndefinitions of intellectual disability that are promulgated\nfor use in making a variety of decisions that are quite\ndifferent from the decision whether the imposition of a\ndeath sentence in a particular case would serve a valid\npenological end. In a death-penalty case, intellectual\nfunctioning is important because of its correlation with the\nability to understand the gravity of the crime and the\npurpose of the penalty, as well as the ability to resist a\nmomentary impulse or the influence of others. See id., at\n318, 320. By contrast, in determining eligibility for social\nservices, adaptive functioning may be much more im\u00ad\nportant. Cf. DSM\u2013IV\u2013TR, at xxxvii (clinical \u201cconsidera\u00ad\ntions\u201d may not be \u201crelevant to legal judgments\u201d that turn\non \u201cindividual responsibility\u201d); DSM\u20135, at 20 (similar).\nPractical problems like these call for legislative judg\u00ad\nments, not judicial resolution.\n                              II\n   Because I find no consensus among the States, I would\nnot independently assess the method that Florida has\nadopted for determining intellectual disability. But even\nif it were appropriate for us to look beyond the evidence of\nsocietal standards, I could not conclude that Florida\u2019s\nmethod is unconstitutional. The Court faults Florida for\n\u201ctak[ing] an IQ score as final and conclusive evidence of a\ndefendant\u2019s intellectual capacity\u201d and for failing to recog\u00ad\nnize that an IQ score may be imprecise. Ante, at 10. In\nmy view, however, Florida has adopted a sensible stand\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

And\nalthough the Court entirely ignores this part of the Florida\nscheme, the State takes into account the inevitable risk of\ntesting error by permitting defendants to introduce multi\u00ad\nple scores.\n  In contrast, the Court establishes a standard that\nconflates what have long been understood to be two inde-\npendent requirements for proving intellectual disability:\n(1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and\n(2) deficits in adaptive behavior. The Court also mandates\nuse of an alternative method of dealing with the risk of\ntesting error without any hint that it is more accurate\nthan Florida\u2019s approach.\n                              A\n                              1\n   The first supposed error that the Court identifies is that\nFlorida \u201ctakes an IQ score\u201d as \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d of\nintellectual functioning. Ante, at 10. As an initial matter,\none would get the impression from reading the Court\u2019s\nopinion that Hall introduced only one test score (of 71).\nSee ante, at 14. In truth, the Florida courts considered\nmultiple scores, all above 70, on the particular IQ test that\nHall has dubbed the \u201cgold standard.\u201d See Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 50; App. 107\u2013108.9 Florida\u2019s statute imposes no\nlimit on the number of IQ scores that a defendant may\nintroduce, so the Court is simply wrong to analyze the\nFlorida system as one that views a single IQ score above\n70 as \u201cfinal and conclusive evidence\u201d that a defendant does\nnot suffer from subaverage intellectual functioning. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 See Brief for Petitioner 50 (listing his valid IQ scores of 71, 72, 73,\n\nand 80). Hall alleges that he also scored a 69 on a Wechsler test, but\nthat score was not admitted into evidence because of doubts about its\nvalidity. App. 107. Hall does not allege that any potential \u201cpractice\neffect\u201d skewed his scores.\n12                          HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                            ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nBrief for Respondent 44 (\u201cFlorida\u2019s Rule allows for multi\u00ad\nple evaluations, and if Hall believed a statistical error rate\nprevented any of his tests from reflecting his true score, he\ncould have sought still more testing\u201d).\n   The proper question to ask, therefore, is whether Flor\u00ad\nida\u2019s actual approach falls outside the range of discretion\nallowed by Atkins. The Court offers no persuasive reason\nfor concluding that it does. Indeed, the Court\u2019s opinion\nnever identifies what other evidence of intellectual func\u00ad\ntioning it would require Florida to admit. As we recog\u00ad\nnized in Atkins, the longstanding practices of the States,\nand at least the previous views of professional organiza\u00ad\ntions, seem to reflect the understanding that IQ scores are\nthe best way to measure intellectual functioning. See 536\nU. S., at 316.10 Until its most recent publication, the APA,\nfor example, ranked the severity of intellectual disability\nexclusively by IQ scores, necessarily pinpointing the onset\nof the disability according to IQ. See DSM\u2013IV\u2013TR, at 42.\n   We have been presented with no solid evidence that the\nlongstanding reliance on multiple IQ test scores as a\nmeasure of intellectual functioning is so unreasonable or\noutside the ordinary as to be unconstitutional.

See ante, at 9\u201310, 12, 20. That is a re\u00ad\nmarkable change in what we took to be a universal under\u00ad\nstanding of intellectual disability just 12 years ago.\n   In Atkins, we instructed that \u201cclinical definitions of\nmental retardation require not only [(1)] subaverage intel\u00ad\nlectual functioning, but also [(2)] significant limitations in\nadaptive skills.\u201d 536 U. S., at 318 (emphasis and altera\u00ad\ntions added). That is the approach taken by the vast\nmajority of States.11 As the Court correctly recognizes,\nmost States require \u201cconcurrent deficits\u201d in intellectual\nfunctioning and adaptive behavior, requiring defendants\nto prove both. Ante, at 8 (emphasis added).12\n   Yet the Court now holds that when a defendant\u2019s IQ\nscore is as high as 75, a court must \u201cconsider factors indi\u00ad\ncating whether the person has deficits in adaptive func\u00ad\ntioning.\u201d Ante, at 12; see ante, at 9\u201310, 20. In other\nwords, even when a defendant has failed to show that he\nmeets the first prong of the well-accepted standard for\nintellectual disability (significantly subaverage intellec\u00ad\ntual functioning), evidence of the second prong (deficits in\nadaptive behavior) can establish intellectual disability.\n   The Court offers little explanation for this sea change.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a74209 (2007); Idaho Code \u00a719\u2013\n\n2515A; Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7174.098 (2013); Va. Code Ann. \u00a719.2\u2013264.3:1.1\n(Lexis Cum. Supp. 2013).\n   12 The longstanding views of professional organizations have also\n\nbeen that intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior are independ\u00ad\nent factors. See, e.g., DSM\u2013IV\u2013TR, at 39. These organizations might\nrecommend examining evidence of adaptive behavior even when an IQ\nis above 70, but that sheds no light on what the legal rule should be\ngiven that most States appear to require defendants to prove each\nprong separately by a preponderance of the evidence.\n14                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nIt asserts vaguely that \u201c[i]t is not sound to view a single\nfactor as dispositive of a conjunctive and interrelated\nassessment.\u201d Ante, at 21. But the Court ignores the fact\nthat deficits in adaptive behavior cannot be used to estab\u00ad\nlish deficits in mental functioning because the two prongs\nare meant to show distinct components of intellectual\ndisability. \u201c[I]ntellectual functions\u201d include \u201creasoning,\nproblem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment,\nacademic learning, and learning from experience,\u201d while\nadaptive functioning refers to the ability \u201cto meet devel\u00ad\nopmental and sociocultural standards for personal inde\u00ad\npendence and social responsibility.\u201d          DSM\u20135, at 33.\nStrong evidence of a deficit in adaptive behavior does not\nnecessarily demonstrate a deficit in intellectual function\u00ad\ning. And without the latter, a person simply cannot be\nclassified as intellectually disabled.\n   It is particularly troubling to relax the proof require\u00ad\nments for the intellectual-functioning prong because that\nis the prong that most directly relates to the concerns that\nled to our primary holding in Atkins. There, we explained\nthat \u201cthe diminished ability to understand and process\ninformation, to learn from experience, to engage in logical\nreasoning, or to control impulses\u201d\u2014i.e., diminished intel-\nlectual functioning\u2014\u201cmake it less likely that [a defendant]\ncan process the information of the possibility of execution\nas a penalty\u201d and therefore be deterred from committing\nmurders. 536 U. S., at 320; see also id., at 318 (\u201c[T]hey\noften act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premedi\u00ad\ntated plan . . .\u201d); see also ante, at 6. A defendant who does\nnot display significantly subaverage intellectual function\u00ad\ning is therefore not among the class of defendants we\nidentified in Atkins.\n   Finally, relying primarily on proof of adaptive deficits\nwill produce inequities in the administration of capital\npunishment. As far as I can tell, adaptive behavior is a\nmalleable factor without \u201cfirm theoretical and empirical\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

No consensus\nexists among States or medical practitioners about what\nfacts are most critical in analyzing that factor, and its\nmeasurement relies largely on subjective judgments.\nFlorida\u2019s approach avoids the disparities that reliance on\nsuch a factor tends to produce. It thus promotes con\u00ad\nsistency in the application of the death penalty and confi\u00ad\ndence that it is not being administered haphazardly.\n                               B\n   The Court\u2019s second \u201cinterrelated\u201d objection to Florida\u2019s\nrule is that it fails to account for the risk of error inherent\nin IQ testing. In order to diminish this risk, the Court\nestablishes a rule that if IQ testing reveals an IQ between\n71 and 75, a claim of intellectual disability cannot be\nrejected on the basis of test scores alone. Ante, at 20. The\nCourt both misunderstands how the SEM works and fails\nto explain why Florida\u2019s method of accounting for the risk\nof error (allowing a defendant to take and rely on multiple\ntests) is not as effective as the approach that the Court\ncompels.\n                              1\n  The Court begins with the simple and uncontroversial\nproposition that every testing situation is susceptible to\nerror and thus may result in an imperfect measurement of\n\u201ctrue\u201d IQ. The Court then wades into technical matters\nthat must be understood in order to see where the Court\ngoes wrong.\n  There are various ways to account for error in IQ test\u00ad\ning. One way is Florida\u2019s approach (evaluate multiple test\nresults). Another is to use a mathematical measurement\ncalled the \u201cstandard error of measurement\u201d or SEM. See\nAAMR 10th ed. 67\u201371 (App. 4.1). Of critical importance,\nthere is not a single, uniform SEM across IQ tests or even\nacross test-takers. Rather, \u201cthe [SEM] varies by test,\n16                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsubgroup, and age group.\u201d User\u2019s Guide To Accompany\nAAIDD 11th ed.: Definition, Classification, and Systems of\nSupports 22 (2012).\n   Once we know the SEM for a particular test and a par\u00ad\nticular test-taker, adding one SEM to and subtracting one\nSEM from the obtained score establishes an interval of\nscores known as the 66% confidence interval. See AAMR\n10th ed. 57. That interval represents the range of scores\nwithin which \u201cwe are [66%] sure\u201d that the \u201ctrue\u201d IQ falls.\nSee Oxford Handbook of Child Psychological Assessment\n291 (D. Saklofske, C. Reynolds, & V. Schwean eds. 2013).\nThe interval is centered on the obtained score, and it\nincludes scores that are above and below that score by the\namount of the SEM. Since there is about a 66% chance\nthat the test-taker\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d IQ falls within this range, there\nis about a 34% chance that the \u201ctrue\u201d IQ falls outside the\ninterval, with approximately equal odds that it falls above\nthe interval (17%) or below the interval (17%).\n   An example: If a test-taker scores a 72 on an IQ test\nwith a SEM of 2, the 66% confidence interval is the range\nof 70 to 74 (72 \u00b1 2). In this situation, there is approxi\u00ad\nmately a 66% chance that the test-taker\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d IQ is\nbetween 70 and 74; roughly a 17% chance that it is above\n74; and roughly a 17% chance that it is 70 or below. Thus,\nthere is about an 83% chance that the score is above 70.\n   Similarly, using two SEMs, we can build a 95% confi\u00ad\ndence interval. The process is the same except that we\nadd two SEMs to and subtract two SEMS from the ob\u00ad\ntained score. To illustrate the use of two SEMs, let us\nhypothesize a case in which the defendant\u2019s obtained score\nis 74. With the same SEM of 2 as in the prior example,\nthere would be a 95% chance that the true score is be\u00ad\ntween 70 and 78 (74 \u00b1 4); roughly a 2.5% chance that the\nscore is above 78; and about a 2.5% chance that the score\nis 70 or below. The probability of a true score above 70\nwould be roughly 97.5%. As these two examples show, the\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

See ante, at 20. That\nassumption gives rise to the Court\u2019s holding that a de\u00ad\nfendant must be permitted to introduce additional evi\u00ad\ndence when IQ tests reveal an IQ as high as 75. See ibid.\nSEMs, however, vary by IQ test and test-taker, and there\nis no reason to assume a SEM of 5 points; indeed, it ap\u00ad\npears that the SEM is generally \u201cestimated to be three to\nfive points\u201d for well-standardized IQ tests. AAMR 10th ed.\n57. And we know that the SEM for Hall\u2019s most recent IQ\ntest was 2.16\u2014less than half of the Court\u2019s estimate of 5.\nBrief for Petitioner 40, n. 17.\n   Relatedly, the Court misreads the authorities on which\nit relies to establish this cutoff IQ score of 75. It is true\nthat certain professional organizations have advocated a\ncutoff of 75 and that Atkins cited those organizations\u2019\ncutoff. See ante, at 12, 20. But the Court overlooks a\ncritical fact: Those organizations endorsed a 75 IQ cutoff\nbased on their express understanding that \u201cone standard\nerror of measurement [SEM]\u201d is \u201cthree to five points for\nwell-standardized\u201d IQ tests. AAMR, Mental Retardation\n37 (9th ed. 1992) (hereinafter AAMR 9th ed.); Atkins, 536\nU. S., 309, n. 5 (citing AAMR 9th ed.; 2 Kaplan & Sadock\u2019s\n2592 (B. Sadock & V. Sadock eds., 7th ed. 2000)); see also\nAAMR 10th ed. 57; AAIDD 11th ed. 36. In other words,\nthe number 75 was relevant only to the extent that a\n18                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsingle SEM was \u201cestimated\u201d to be as high as 5 points.\nAAMR 9th ed. 37. Here, by contrast, we know that the\nSEM for Hall\u2019s latest IQ test was less than half of that\nestimate; there is no relevance to the number 75 in this\ncase. To blindly import a five-point margin of error when\nwe know as a matter of fact that the relevant SEM is 2.16\namounts to requiring consideration of more than two\nSEMs\u2014an approach that finds no support in Atkins or\nanywhere else.\n   Because of these factual errors and ambiguities, it is\nunclear to me whether the Court concludes that a defend\u00ad\nant is constitutionally entitled to introduce non-test evi\u00ad\ndence of intellectual disability (1) whenever his score is 75\nor lower, on the mistaken understanding that the SEM for\nmost tests is 5; (2) when the 66% confidence interval\n(using one SEM) includes a score of 70; or (3) when the\n95% confidence interval (using two SEMs) includes a score\nof 70. In my view, none of these approaches is defensible.\n   An approach tied to a fixed score of 75 can be dismissed\nout of hand because, as discussed, every test has a differ\u00ad\nent SEM.\n   The other two approaches would require that a defend\u00ad\nant be permitted to submit additional evidence when his\nIQ is above 70 so long as the 66% or 95% confidence inter\u00ad\nval (using one SEM or two SEMs, respectively) includes a\nscore of 70, but there is no foundation for this in our\nEighth Amendment case law. As Hall concedes, the\nEighth Amendment permits States to assign to a defend\u00ad\nant the burden of establishing intellectual disability by at\nleast a preponderance of the evidence. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n12. In other words, a defendant can be required to prove\nthat the probability of a 70 or sub-70 IQ is greater than\n50%. Under the Court\u2019s approach, by contrast, a defend\u00ad\nant could prove significantly subaverage intellectual func\u00ad\ntioning by showing simply that the probability of a \u201ctrue\u201d\nIQ of 70 or below is as little as 17% (under a one-SEM\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 19\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nrule) or 2.5% (under a two-SEM rule). This totally trans\u00ad\nforms the allocation and nature of the burden of proof.\n   I have referred to the 66% and 95% confidence intervals\nonly because they result from the most straightforward\napplication of the SEM in this context: One SEM estab\u00ad\nlishes the 66% confidence interval; two SEMs establish the\n95% confidence interval. See AAIDD 11th ed. 36. But it\nwould be simple enough to devise a 51% confidence inter\u00ad\nval\u2014or a 99% confidence interval for that matter. There\nis therefore no excuse for mechanically imposing stand\u00ad\nards that are unhinged from legal logic and that over-\nride valid state laws establishing burdens of proof. The\nappropriate confidence level is ultimately a judgment best\nleft to legislatures, and their judgment has been that a\ndefendant must establish that it is more likely than not\nthat he is intellectually disabled. I would defer to that\ndetermination.\n                             3\n  The Court also fails to grasp that Florida\u2019s system al\u00ad\nready accounts for the risk of testing error by allowing the\nintroduction of multiple test scores. The Court never\nexplains why its criticisms of the uncertainty resulting\nfrom the use of a single IQ score apply when a defendant\nconsistently scores above 70 on multiple tests. Contrary to\nthe Court\u2019s evident assumption, the well-accepted view is\nthat multiple consistent scores establish a much higher\ndegree of confidence.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 See Oxford Handbook of Child Psychological Assessment 291\n\n(D.

FLORIDA\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  The Court\u2019s only attempt to address this is to say that\n\u201cthe analysis of multiple IQ scores jointly is a complicated\nendeavor,\u201d ante, at 11, but any evaluation of intellectual\ndisability, whether based on objective tests or subjective\nobservations, is \u201ccomplicated.\u201d If conducting the proper\nanalysis of multiple scores produces an IQ as reliable as\nthe approach mandated by the Court, there is no basis for\nrejecting Florida\u2019s approach.14\n                      *    *     *\n  For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the\nFlorida Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndrop in IQ scores following incarceration can be strong evidence of\nmalingering\u201d); Frances, supra, at 31 (\u201c[H]igher scores are likely to be\nthe more indicative, since there are many reasons why a given score\nmight underestimate a person\u2019s intelligence, but no reason why scores\nshould overestimate it\u201d).\n   14 The Court also states that because IQ testing itself may be flawed,\n\n\u201cmultiple examinations may result in repeated similar scores\u201d that are\n\u201cnot conclusive evidence of intellectual functioning.\u201d Ante, at 12. That\nargument proves too much: If potential flaws in administering multiple\ntests are sufficient to render them inaccurate, the Court should con\u00ad\nclude that even scores of 90 or 100 are not sufficient. The appropriate\nremedy for incorrectly administered tests is for a court to disregard\nthose tests, not to ignore the well-established fact that multiple, prop-\nerly administered tests yielding scores above 70 can give a high degree\nof confidence that an individual is not intellectually disabled.\n",

Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 321, Hall asked a Florida state court to va-\n  cate his sentence, presenting evidence that included an IQ test score\n  of 71. The court denied his motion, determining that a Florida stat-\n  ute mandated that he show an IQ score of 70 or below before being\n  permitted to present any additional intellectual disability evidence.\n  The State Supreme Court rejected Hall\u2019s appeal, finding the State\u2019s\n  70-point threshold constitutional.\nHeld: The State\u2019s threshold requirement, as interpreted by the Florida\n Supreme Court, is unconstitutional. Pp. 5\u201322.\n    (a) The Eighth Amendment, which \u201creaffirms the duty of the gov-\n ernment to respect the dignity of all persons,\u201d Roper v. Simmons, 543\n U. S. 551, 560, prohibits the execution of persons with intellectual\n disability. No legitimate penological purpose is served by executing\n the intellectually disabled. Atkins, 563 U. S., at 317, 320. Prohibit-\n ing such executions also protects the integrity of the trial process for\n individuals who face \u201ca special risk of wrongful execution\u201d because\n they are more likely to give false confessions, are often poor witness-\n es, and are less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel.\n Id., at 320\u2013321. In determining whether Florida\u2019s intellectual disa-\n bility definition implements these principles and Atkins\u2019 holding, it is\n proper to consider the psychiatric and professional studies that elab-\n orate on the purpose and meaning of IQ scores and how the scores re-\n late to Atkins, and to consider how the several States have imple-\n mented Atkins. Pp. 5\u20137.\n    (b) Florida\u2019s rule disregards established medical practice. On its\n face, Florida\u2019s statute could be consistent with the views of the medi-\n cal community discussed in Atkins and with the conclusions reached\n2                            HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    here. It defines intellectual disability as the existence of concurrent\n    deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning, long the defining\n    characteristic of intellectual disability. See Atkins, supra, at 308.\n    And nothing in the statute precludes Florida from considering an IQ\n    test\u2019s standard error of measurement (SEM), a statistical fact reflect-\n    ing the test\u2019s inherent imprecision and acknowledging that an indi-\n    vidual score is best understood as a range, e.g., five points on either\n    side of the recorded score. As interpreted by the Florida Supreme\n    Court, however, Florida\u2019s rule disregards established medical prac-\n    tice in two interrelated ways: It takes an IQ score as final and con-\n    clusive evidence of a defendant\u2019s intellectual capacity, when experts\n    would consider other evidence; and it relies on a purportedly scien-\n    tific measurement of a defendant\u2019s abilities, while refusing to recog-\n    nize that measurement\u2019s inherent imprecision. While professionals\n    have long agreed that IQ test scores should be read as a range, Flori-\n    da uses the test score as a fixed number, thus barring further consid-\n    eration of other relevant evidence, e.g., deficits in adaptive function-\n    ing, including evidence of past performance, environment, and\n    upbringing. Pp. 7\u201312.\n       (c) The rejection of a strict 70-point cutoff in the vast majority of\n    States and a \u201cconsistency in the trend,\u201d Roper, supra, at 567, toward\n    recognizing the SEM provide strong evidence of consensus that socie-\n    ty does not regard this strict cutoff as proper or humane. At most,\n    nine States mandate a strict IQ score cutoff at 70. Thus, in 41\n    States, an individual in Hall\u2019s position would not be deemed automat-\n    ically eligible for the death penalty. The direction of change has been\n    consistent. Since Atkins, many States have passed legislation to\n    comply with the constitutional requirement that persons with intel-\n    lectual disability not be executed. Two of those States appear to set a\n    strict cutoff at 70, but at least 11 others have either abolished the\n    death penalty or passed legislation allowing defendants to present\n    additional intellectual disability evidence when their IQ score is\n    above 70. Every state legislature, save one, to have considered the\n    issue after Atkins and whose law has been interpreted by its courts\n    has taken a position contrary to Florida\u2019s. Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (d) Atkins acknowledges the inherent error in IQ testing and pro-\n    vides substantial guidance on the definition of intellectual disability.\n    The States play a critical role in advancing the protections of Atkins\n    and providing this Court with an understanding of how intellectual\n    disability should be measured and assessed, but Atkins did not give\n    them unfettered discretion to define the full scope of the constitution-\n    al protection. Clinical definitions for intellectual disability which, by\n    their express terms, rejected a strict IQ test score cutoff at 70, and\n    which have long included the SEM, were a fundamental premise of\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

Atkins v. Virginia,\n536 U. S. 304, 321 (2002). Florida law defines intellectual\ndisability to require an IQ test score of 70 or less. If, from\ntest scores, a prisoner is deemed to have an IQ above 70,\nall further exploration of intellectual disability is fore\u00ad\nclosed. This rigid rule, the Court now holds, creates an\nunacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability\nwill be executed, and thus is unconstitutional.\n                            I\n  On February 21, 1978, Freddie Lee Hall, petitioner here,\nand his accomplice, Mark Ruffin, kidnaped, beat, raped,\nand murdered Karol Hurst, a pregnant, 21-year-old new\u00ad\nlywed. Afterward, Hall and Ruffin drove to a convenience\nstore they planned to rob. In the parking lot of the store,\nthey killed Lonnie Coburn, a sheriff\u2019s deputy who at\u00ad\ntempted to apprehend them. Hall received the death\npenalty for both murders, although his sentence for the\nCoburn murder was later reduced on account of insuffi\u00ad\ncient evidence of premeditation. Hall v. Florida, 403\n2                     HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSo. 2d 1319, 1321 (Fla. 1981) (per curiam).\n   Hall argues that he cannot be executed because of his\nintellectual disability. Previous opinions of this Court\nhave employed the term \u201cmental retardation.\u201d This opin\u00ad\nion uses the term \u201cintellectual disability\u201d to describe the\nidentical phenomenon. See Rosa\u2019s Law, 124 Stat. 2643\n(changing entries in the U. S. Code from \u201cmental retarda\u00ad\ntion\u201d to \u201cintellectual disability\u201d); Schalock et. al, The Re\u00ad\nnaming of Mental Retardation: Understanding the Change\nto the Term Intellectual Disability, 45 Intellectual & De\u00ad\nvelopmental Disabilities 116 (2007). This change in ter\u00ad\nminology is approved and used in the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\none of the basic texts used by psychiatrists and other\nexperts; the manual is often referred to by its initials\n\u201cDSM,\u201d followed by its edition number, e.g., \u201cDSM\u20135.\u201d See\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statisti\u00ad\ncal Manual of Mental Disorders 33 (5th ed. 2013).\n   When Hall was first sentenced, this Court had not yet\nruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits States from\nimposing the death penalty on persons with intellectual\ndisability. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 340\n(1989). And at the time, Florida law did not consider\nintellectual disability as a statutory mitigating factor.\n   After this Court held that capital defendants must be\npermitted to present nonstatutory mitigating evidence in\ndeath penalty proceedings, Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S.\n393, 398\u2013399 (1987), Hall was resentenced. Hall then\npresented substantial and unchallenged evidence of intel\u00ad\nlectual disability. School records indicated that his teach\u00ad\ners identified him on numerous occasions as \u201c[m]entally\nretarded.\u201d App. 482\u2013483.

J., dissenting).\n   The jury, notwithstanding this testimony, voted to\nsentence Hall to death, and the sentencing court adopted\nthe jury\u2019s recommendation. The court found that there\nwas \u201csubstantial evidence in the record\u201d to support the\nfinding that \u201cFreddie Lee Hall has been mentally retarded\nhis entire life.\u201d App. 46. Yet the court also \u201csuspect[ed]\nthat the defense experts [were] guilty of some professional\noverkill,\u201d because \u201c[n]othing of which the experts testified\ncould explain how a psychotic, mentally-retarded, brain\u00ad\ndamaged, learning-disabled, speech-impaired person could\nformulate a plan whereby a car was stolen and a conven\u00ad\nience store was robbed.\u201d Id., at 42. The sentencing court\nwent on to state that, even assuming the expert testimony\nto be accurate, \u201cthe learning disabilities, mental retarda\u00ad\ntion, and other mental difficulties . . . cannot be used to\njustify, excuse or extenuate the moral culpability of the\ndefendant in this cause.\u201d Id., at 56. Hall was again sen\u00ad\ntenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed,\nconcluding that \u201cHall\u2019s argument that his mental retarda\u00ad\ntion provided a pretense of moral or legal justification\u201d\nhad \u201cno merit.\u201d Hall, 614 So. 2d, at 478. Chief Justice\nBarkett dissented, arguing that executing a person with\nintellectual disability violated the State Constitution\u2019s\nprohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

On November\n30, 2004, Hall filed a motion claiming that he had intellec\u00ad\ntual disability and could not be executed. More than five\nyears later, Florida held a hearing to consider Hall\u2019s mo\u00ad\ntion. Hall again presented evidence of intellectual disabil\u00ad\nity, including an IQ test score of 71.

In response, Florida argued\nthat Hall could not be found intellectually disabled be\u00ad\ncause Florida law requires that, as a threshold matter,\nHall show an IQ test score of 70 or below before presenting\nany additional evidence of his intellectual disability. App.\n278\u2013279 (\u201c[U]nder the law, if an I. Q. is above 70, a person\nis not mentally retarded\u201d). The Florida Supreme Court\nrejected Hall\u2019s appeal and held that Florida\u2019s 70-point\nthreshold was constitutional. 109 So. 3d, at 707\u2013708.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 571 U.

Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 560 (2005);\nFurman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 239\u2013240 (1972) (per\ncuriam). \u201cBy protecting even those convicted of heinous\ncrimes, the Eighth Amendment reaffirms the duty of the\ngovernment to respect the dignity of all persons.\u201d Roper,\nsupra, at 560; see also Trop v.

The Eighth\n6                     HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAmendment\u2019s protection of dignity reflects the Nation we\nhave been, the Nation we are, and the Nation we aspire to\nbe. This is to affirm that the Nation\u2019s constant, unyielding\npurpose must be to transmit the Constitution so that its\nprecepts and guarantees retain their meaning and force.\n   The Eighth Amendment prohibits certain punishments\nas a categorical matter. No natural-born citizen may be\ndenaturalized. Ibid. No person may be sentenced to death\nfor a crime committed as a juvenile. Roper, supra, at 578.\nAnd, as relevant for this case, persons with intellectual\ndisability may not be executed. Atkins, 536 U. S., at 321.\n   No legitimate penological purpose is served by executing\na person with intellectual disability. Id., at 317, 320. To\ndo so contravenes the Eighth Amendment, for to impose\nthe harshest of punishments on an intellectually disabled\nperson violates his or her inherent dignity as a human\nbeing. \u201c[P]unishment is justified under one or more of\nthree principal rationales: rehabilitation, deterrence, and\nretribution.\u201d Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 420\n(2008). Rehabilitation, it is evident, is not an applicable\nrationale for the death penalty. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428\nU. S. 153, 183 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and\nStevens, JJ.). As for deterrence, those with intellectual\ndisability are, by reason of their condition, likely unable to\nmake the calculated judgments that are the premise for\nthe deterrence rationale. They have a \u201cdiminished ability\u201d\nto \u201cprocess information, to learn from experience, to en\u00ad\ngage in logical reasoning, or to control impulses . . .\n[which] make[s] it less likely that they can process the\ninformation of the possibility of execution as a penalty\nand, as a result, control their conduct based upon that\ninformation.\u201d Atkins, 536 U. S., at 320. Retributive val\u00ad\nues are also ill-served by executing those with intellectual\ndisability. The diminished capacity of the intellectually\ndisabled lessens moral culpability and hence the retribu\u00ad\ntive value of the punishment. See id., at 319 (\u201cIf the cul\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify\nthe most extreme sanction available to the State, the\nlesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely\ndoes not merit that form of retribution\u201d).\n   A further reason for not imposing the death penalty on a\nperson who is intellectually disabled is to protect the\nintegrity of the trial process. These persons face \u201ca special\nrisk of wrongful execution\u201d because they are more likely to\ngive false confessions, are often poor witnesses, and are\nless able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel.\nId., at 320\u2013321. This is not to say that under current law\npersons with intellectual disability who \u201cmeet the law\u2019s\nrequirements for criminal responsibility\u201d may not be tried\nand punished. Id., at 306. They may not, however, re\u00ad\nceive the law\u2019s most severe sentence. Id., at 318.\n   The question this case presents is how intellectual\ndisability must be defined in order to implement these\nprinciples and the holding of Atkins. To determine if\nFlorida\u2019s cutoff rule is valid, it is proper to consider the\npsychiatric and professional studies that elaborate on the\npurpose and meaning of IQ scores to determine how the\nscores relate to the holding of Atkins. This in turn leads to\na better understanding of how the legislative policies of\nvarious States, and the holdings of state courts, imple\u00ad\nment the Atkins rule. That understanding informs our\ndetermination whether there is a consensus that instructs\nhow to decide the specific issue presented here. And, in\nconclusion, this Court must express its own independent\ndetermination reached in light of the instruction found in\nthose sources and authorities.\n                            III\n\n                             A\n\n  That this Court, state courts, and state legislatures\nconsult and are informed by the work of medical experts in\ndetermining intellectual disability is unsurprising. Those\n8                     HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprofessionals use their learning and skills to study and\nconsider the consequences of the classification schemes\nthey devise in the diagnosis of persons with mental or\npsychiatric disorders or disabilities. Society relies upon\nmedical and professional expertise to define and explain\nhow to diagnose the mental condition at issue. And the\ndefinition of intellectual disability by skilled professionals\nhas implications far beyond the confines of the death\npenalty: for it is relevant to education, access to social\nprograms, and medical treatment plans. In determining\nwho qualifies as intellectually disabled, it is proper to\nconsult the medical community\u2019s opinions.\n   As the Court noted in Atkins, the medical community\ndefines intellectual disability according to three criteria:\nsignificantly subaverage intellectual functioning, deficits\nin adaptive functioning (the inability to learn basic skills\nand adjust behavior to changing circumstances), and onset\nof these deficits during the developmental period. See id.,\nat 308, n. 3; DSM\u20135, at 33; Brief for American Psychologi\u00ad\ncal Association et al. as Amici Curiae 12\u201313 (hereinafter\nAPA Brief). This last factor, referred to as \u201cage of onset,\u201d\nis not at issue.\n   The first and second criteria\u2014deficits in intellectual\nfunctioning and deficits in adaptive functioning\u2014are\ncentral here. In the context of a formal assessment, \u201c[t]he\nexistence of concurrent deficits in intellectual and adap\u00ad\ntive functioning has long been the defining characteristic\nof intellectual disability.\u201d Id., at 11.\n   On its face, the Florida statute could be consistent with\nthe views of the medical community noted and discussed\nin Atkins. Florida\u2019s statute defines intellectual disability\nfor purposes of an Atkins proceeding as \u201csignificantly\nsubaverage general intellectual functioning existing con\u00ad\ncurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested\nduring the period from conception to age 18.\u201d Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7921.137(1) (2013). The statute further defines \u201csignifi\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\u201d as\n\u201cperformance that is two or more standard deviations from\nthe mean score on a standardized intelligence test.\u201d Ibid.\nThe mean IQ test score is 100. The concept of standard\ndeviation describes how scores are dispersed in a popula\u00ad\ntion. Standard deviation is distinct from standard error of\nmeasurement, a concept which describes the reliability of\na test and is discussed further below. The standard devia\u00ad\ntion on an IQ test is approximately 15 points, and so two\nstandard deviations is approximately 30 points. Thus a\ntest taker who performs \u201ctwo or more standard deviations\nfrom the mean\u201d will score approximately 30 points below\nthe mean on an IQ test, i.e., a score of approximately 70\npoints.\n   On its face this statute could be interpreted consistently\nwith Atkins and with the conclusions this Court reaches in\nthe instant case. Nothing in the statute precludes Florida\nfrom taking into account the IQ test\u2019s standard error of\nmeasurement, and as discussed below there is evidence\nthat Florida\u2019s Legislature intended to include the meas\u00ad\nurement error in the calculation. But the Florida Su\u00ad\npreme Court has interpreted the provisions more nar\u00ad\nrowly. It has held that a person whose test score is above 70,\nincluding a score within the margin for measurement\nerror, does not have an intellectual disability and is barred\nfrom presenting other evidence that would show his facul\u00ad\nties are limited. See Cherry v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1140944\"><a href=\"/fla/6Ras/cherry-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712\u2013\n713 (Fla. 2007) (per curiam). That strict IQ test score\ncutoff of 70 is the issue in this case.\n   Pursuant to this mandatory cutoff, sentencing courts\ncannot consider even substantial and weighty evidence of\nintellectual disability as measured and made manifest by\nthe defendant\u2019s failure or inability to adapt to his social\nand cultural environment, including medical histories,\nbehavioral records, school tests and reports, and testimony\nregarding past behavior and family circumstances. This is\n10                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nso even though the medical community accepts that all of\nthis evidence can be probative of intellectual disability,\nincluding for individuals who have an IQ test score above\n70. See APA Brief 15\u201316 (\u201c[T]he relevant clinical authori\u00ad\nties all agree that an individual with an IQ score above 70\nmay properly be diagnosed with intellectual disability if\nsignificant limitations in adaptive functioning also exist\u201d);\nDSM\u20135, at 37 (\u201c[A] person with an IQ score above 70 may\nhave such severe adaptive behavior problems . . . that the\nperson\u2019s actual functioning is comparable to that of indi\u00ad\nviduals with a lower IQ score\u201d).\n   Florida\u2019s rule disregards established medical practice in\ntwo interrelated ways. It takes an IQ score as final and\nconclusive evidence of a defendant\u2019s intellectual capacity,\nwhen experts in the field would consider other evidence.\nIt also relies on a purportedly scientific measurement of\nthe defendant\u2019s abilities, his IQ score, while refusing to\nrecognize that the score is, on its own terms, imprecise.\n   The professionals who design, administer, and interpret\nIQ tests have agreed, for years now, that IQ test scores\nshould be read not as a single fixed number but as a\nrange. See D. Wechsler, The Measurement of Adult Intel\u00ad\nligence 133 (3d ed. 1944) (reporting the range of error on\nan early IQ test). Each IQ test has a \u201cstandard error of\nmeasurement,\u201d ibid., often referred to by the abbreviation\n\u201cSEM.\u201d A test\u2019s SEM is a statistical fact, a reflection of\nthe inherent imprecision of the test itself. See R. Furr &\nV. Bacharach, Psychometrics 118 (2d ed. 2014) (identify\u00ad\ning the SEM as \u201cone of the most important concepts in\nmeasurement theory\u201d). An individual\u2019s IQ test score on\nany given exam may fluctuate for a variety of reasons.\nThese include the test-taker\u2019s health; practice from earlier\ntests; the environment or location of the test; the examin\u00ad\ner\u2019s demeanor; the subjective judgment involved in scoring\ncertain questions on the exam; and simple lucky guessing.\nSee American Association on Intellectual and Develop\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Kaufman, IQ\nTesting 101, pp. 138\u2013139 (2009).\n   The SEM reflects the reality that an individual\u2019s intel\u00ad\nlectual functioning cannot be reduced to a single numeri\u00ad\ncal score. For purposes of most IQ tests, the SEM means\nthat an individual\u2019s score is best understood as a range of\nscores on either side of the recorded score. The SEM\nallows clinicians to calculate a range within which one\nmay say an individual\u2019s true IQ score lies. See APA Brief\n23 (\u201cSEM is a unit of measurement: 1 SEM equates to a\nconfidence of 68% that the measured score falls within a\ngiven score range, while 2 SEM provides a 95% confidence\nlevel that the measured score is within a broader range\u201d).\nA score of 71, for instance, is generally considered to re\u00ad\nflect a range between 66 and 76 with 95% confidence and a\nrange of 68.5 and 73.5 with a 68% confidence. See DSM\u2013\n5, at 37 (\u201cIndividuals with intellectual disability have\nscores of approximately two standard deviations or more\nbelow the population mean, including a margin for meas\u00ad\nurement error (generally +5 points). . . . [T]his involves a\nscore of 65\u201375 (70 \u00b1 5)\u201d); APA Brief 23 (\u201cFor example, the\naverage SEM for the WAIS-IV is 2.16 IQ test points and\nthe average SEM for the Stanford-Binet 5 is 2.30 IQ test\npoints (test manuals report SEMs by different age group\u00ad\nings; these scores are similar, but not identical, often due\nto sampling error)\u201d). Even when a person has taken mul\u00ad\ntiple tests, each separate score must be assessed using the\nSEM, and the analysis of multiple IQ scores jointly is a\ncomplicated endeavor. See Schneider, Principles of As\u00ad\nsessment of Aptitude and Achievement, in The Oxford\nHandbook of Child Psychological Assessment 286, 289\u2013\n291, 318 (D. Saklofske, C. Reynolds, V.

FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor administered in a consistently flawed manner, multiple\nexaminations may result in repeated similar scores, so\nthat even a consistent score is not conclusive evidence of\nintellectual functioning.\n  Despite these professional explanations, Florida law\nused the test score as a fixed number, thus barring further\nconsideration of other evidence bearing on the question of\nintellectual disability. For professionals to diagnose\u2014and\nfor the law then to determine\u2014whether an intellectual\ndisability exists once the SEM applies and the individual\u2019s\nIQ score is 75 or below the inquiry would consider factors\nindicating whether the person had deficits in adaptive\nfunctioning. These include evidence of past performance,\nenvironment, and upbringing.\n                               B\n   A significant majority of States implement the protec\u00ad\ntions of Atkins by taking the SEM into account, thus\nacknowledging the error inherent in using a test score\nwithout necessary adjustment.

S., at 316 (\u201c[E]ven in those States that allow the\nexecution of mentally retarded offenders, the practice\nis uncommon. Some States . . . continue to authorize\nexecutions, but none have been carried out in decades.\nThus there is little need to pursue legislation barring the\nexecution of the mentally retarded in those States\u201d).\nDelaware has executed three individuals in the past dec\u00ad\nade, while Washington has executed one person, and has\nrecently suspended its death penalty. None of the four\nindividuals executed recently in those States appears to\nhave brought a claim similar to that advanced here.\n   Thus, at most nine States mandate a strict IQ score\ncutoff at 70. Of these, four States (Delaware, Kansas,\nNorth Carolina, and Washington) appear not to have\nconsidered the issue in their courts. On the other side of\nthe ledger stand the 18 States that have abolished the\ndeath penalty, either in full or for new offenses, and Ore\u00ad\ngon, which has suspended the death penalty and executed\nonly two individuals in the past 40 years. See Roper, 543\nU. S., at 574 (\u201c[The] Court should have considered those\nStates that had abandoned the death penalty altogether as\npart of the consensus against the juvenile death penalty\u201d).\nIn those States, of course, a person in Hall\u2019s position\ncould not be executed even without a finding of intellectual\ndisability. Thus in 41 States an individual in Hall\u2019s\nposition\u2014an individual with an IQ score of 71\u2014would not\nbe deemed automatically eligible for the death penalty.\n   These aggregate numbers are not the only considera\u00ad\ntions bearing on a determination of consensus. Consistency\nof the direction of change is also relevant. See id., at\n565\u2013566 (quoting Atkins, supra, at 315). Since Atkins,\nmany States have passed legislation to comply with the\nconstitutional requirement that persons with intellectual\ndisability not be executed. Two of these States, Virginia\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand Delaware, appear to set a strict cutoff at 70, although\nas discussed, Delaware\u2019s courts have yet to interpret the\nlaw. In contrast, at least 11 States have either abolished\nthe death penalty or passed legislation allowing defend\u00ad\nants to present additional evidence of intellectual disabil\u00ad\nity when their IQ test score is above 70.\n   Since Atkins, five States have abolished the death pen\u00ad\nalty through legislation. See 2012 Conn. Pub. Acts no. 12\u2013\n5; Ill. Comp. Stat. ch. 725, \u00a7119\u20131 (West 2012); Md. Cor\u00ad\nrec. Servs. Code Ann. \u00a73\u2013901 et seq. (Lexis 2008); N. J.\nStat.

In addition, the New York Court of\nAppeals invalidated New York\u2019s death penalty under the\nState Constitution in 2004, see People v. LeValle, 3 N. Y.\n3d 88, 817 N. E. 2d 341 (2004), and legislation has not\nbeen passed to reinstate it. And when it did impose the\ndeath penalty, New York did not employ an IQ cutoff in\ndetermining intellectual disability. N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law\nAnn. \u00a7400.27(12)(e) (West 2005).\n   In addition to these States, at least five others have\npassed legislation allowing a defendant to present addi\u00ad\ntional evidence of intellectual disability even when an IQ\ntest score is above 70. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a71376\n(West Supp. 2014) (no IQ cutoff); Idaho Code \u00a719\u20132515A\n(Lexis Supp. 2013) (\u201cseventy (70) or below\u201d); Pizzutto v.\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 729, 202 P. 3d 642, 651 (2008) (\u201cThe\nalleged error in IQ testing is plus or minus five points.\nThe district court was entitled to draw reasonable infer\u00ad\nences from the undisputed facts\u201d); La.

The U. S. Code\nlikewise does not set a strict IQ cutoff. See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73596(c). And no State that previously allowed defendants\nwith an IQ score over 70 to present additional evidence of\nintellectual disability has modified its law to create a\n16                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstrict cutoff at 70. Cf. Roper, supra, at 566 (\u201cSince Stan-\nford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361 (1989), no State that previ\u00ad\nously prohibited capital punishment for juveniles has\nreinstated it\u201d).\n  In summary, every state legislature to have considered\nthe issue after Atkins\u2014save Virginia\u2019s\u2014and whose law\nhas been interpreted by its courts has taken a position\ncontrary to that of Florida. Indeed, the Florida Legisla\u00ad\nture, which passed the relevant legislation prior to Atkins,\nmight well have believed that its law would not create\na fixed cutoff at 70. The staff analysis accompanying\nthe 2001 bill states that it \u201cdoes not contain a set IQ\nlevel . . . . Two standard deviations from these tests is ap\u00ad\nproximately a 70 IQ, although it can be extended up to\n75.\u201d Fla. Senate Staff Analysis and Economic Impact\nStatement, CS/SB 238, p. 11 (Feb. 14, 2001). But the\nFlorida Supreme Court interpreted the law to require a\nbright-line cutoff at 70, see Cherry, 959 So. 2d, at 712\u2013713,\nand the Court is bound by that interpretation.\n  The rejection of the strict 70 cutoff in the vast majority\nof States and the \u201cconsistency in the trend,\u201d Roper, supra,\nat 567, toward recognizing the SEM provide strong evi\u00ad\ndence of consensus that our society does not regard this\nstrict cutoff as proper or humane.\n                              C\n  Atkins itself acknowledges the inherent error in IQ\ntesting. It is true that Atkins \u201cdid not provide definitive\nprocedural or substantive guides for determining when a\nperson who claims mental retardation\u201d falls within the\nprotection of the Eighth Amendment. Bobby v. Bies, 556\nU. S. 825, 831 (2009). \tIn Atkins, the Court stated:\n     \u201cNot all people who claim to be mentally retarded will\n     be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally\n     retarded offenders about whom there is a national\n     consensus. As was our approach in Ford v. Wain-\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    wright with regard to insanity, \u2018we leave to the\n    State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to en\u00ad\n    force the constitutional restriction upon [their] execu\u00ad\n    tion of sentences.\u2019 \u201d 536 U. S., at 317 (quoting Ford v.\n    Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 416\u2013417 (1986); citation\n    omitted).\nAs discussed above, the States play a critical role in ad\u00ad\nvancing protections and providing the Court with infor\u00ad\nmation that contributes to an understanding of how intel\u00ad\nlectual disability should be measured and assessed. But\nAtkins did not give the States unfettered discretion to\ndefine the full scope of the constitutional protection.\n   The Atkins Court twice cited definitions of intellectual\ndisability which, by their express terms, rejected a strict\nIQ test score cutoff at 70. Atkins first cited the definition\nprovided in the DSM\u2013IV: \u201c \u2018Mild\u2019 mental retardation is\ntypically used to describe people with an IQ level of 50\u201355\nto approximately 70.\u201d 536 U. S., at 308, n. 3 (citing Diag\u00ad\nnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41 (4th\ned. 2000)). The Court later noted that \u201c \u2018an IQ between 70\nand 75 or lower . . . is typically considered the cutoff IQ\nscore for the intellectual function prong of the mental\nretardation definition.\u2019 \u201d 536 U. S., at 309, n. 5. Further\u00ad\nmore, immediately after the Court declared that it left \u201c \u2018to\nthe States the task of developing appropriate ways to\nenforce the constitutional restriction,\u2019 \u201d id., at 317, the\nCourt stated in an accompanying footnote that \u201c[t]he\n[state] statutory definitions of mental retardation are not\nidentical, but generally conform to the clinical definitions,\u201d\nibid.\n   Thus Atkins itself not only cited clinical definitions for\nintellectual disability but also noted that the States\u2019\nstandards, on which the Court based its own conclusion,\nconformed to those definitions. In the words of Atkins,\nthose persons who meet the \u201cclinical definitions\u201d of intel\u00ad\n18                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlectual disability \u201cby definition . . . have diminished capac\u00ad\nities to understand and process information, to communi\u00ad\ncate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience,\nto engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to\nunderstand the reactions of others.\u201d Id., at 318. Thus,\nthey bear \u201cdiminish[ed] . . . personal culpability.\u201d Ibid.\nThe clinical definitions of intellectual disability, which\ntake into account that IQ scores represent a range, not a\nfixed number, were a fundamental premise of Atkins. And\nthose clinical definitions have long included the SEM. See\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 28\n(rev. 3d ed. 1987) (\u201cSince any measurement is fallible, an\nIQ score is generally thought to involve an error of meas\u00ad\nurement of approximately five points; hence, an IQ of 70 is\nconsidered to represent a band or zone of 65 to 75. Treat\u00ad\ning the IQ with some flexibility permits inclusion in the\nMental Retardation category of people with IQs somewhat\nhigher than 70 who exhibit significant deficits in adaptive\nbehavior\u201d).\n   Respondent argues that the current Florida law was\nfavorably cited by the Atkins Court. See Brief for Re\u00ad\nspondent 18 (\u201cAs evidence of the national consensus, the\nCourt specifically cited Florida\u2019s statute at issue here,\nwhich has not substantively changed\u201d). While Atkins did\nrefer to Florida\u2019s law in a citation listing States which had\noutlawed the execution of the intellectually disabled, 536\nU. S., at 315, that fleeting mention did not signal the\nCourt\u2019s approval of Florida\u2019s current understanding of the\nlaw. As discussed above, when Atkins was decided the\nFlorida Supreme Court had not yet interpreted the law to\nrequire a strict IQ cutoff at 70. That new interpretation\nruns counter to the clinical definition cited throughout\nAtkins and to Florida\u2019s own legislative report indicating\nthis kind of cutoff need not be used.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument also conflicts with the logic of\nAtkins and the Eighth Amendment. If the States were to\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

This Court thus reads\nAtkins to provide substantial guidance on the definition of\nintellectual disability.\n                              D\n  The actions of the States and the precedents of this\nCourt \u201cgive us essential instruction,\u201d Roper, 543 U. S., at\n564, but the inquiry must go further. \u201c[T]he Constitution\ncontemplates that in the end our own judgment will be\nbrought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the\ndeath penalty under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Coker v.\nGeorgia, 433 U. S. 584, 597 (1977) (plurality opinion).\nThat exercise of independent judgment is the Court\u2019s\njudicial duty. See Roper, supra, at 574 (\u201c[T]o the extent\nStanford was based on a rejection of the idea that this\nCourt is required to bring its independent judgment to\nbear on the proportionality of the death penalty for a\nparticular class of crimes or offenders, it suffices to note\nthat this rejection was inconsistent with prior Eighth\nAmendment decisions\u201d (citation omitted).\n  In this Court\u2019s independent judgment, the Florida stat\u00ad\nute, as interpreted by its courts, is unconstitutional.\n  In addition to the views of the States and the Court\u2019s\nprecedent, this determination is informed by the views of\nmedical experts. These views do not dictate the Court\u2019s\ndecision, yet the Court does not disregard these informed\nassessments. See Kansas v. Crane, 534 U. S. 407, 413\n(2002) (\u201c[T]he science of psychiatry . . . informs but does\nnot control ultimate legal determinations . . .\u201d). It is the\nCourt\u2019s duty to interpret the Constitution, but it need not\ndo so in isolation. The legal determination of intellectual\ndisability is distinct from a medical diagnosis, but it is\ninformed by the medical community\u2019s diagnostic frame\u00ad\n20                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwork. Atkins itself points to the diagnostic criteria em\u00ad\nployed by psychiatric professionals. And the professional\ncommunity\u2019s teachings are of particular help in this case,\nwhere no alternative definition of intellectual disability is\npresented and where this Court and the States have\nplaced substantial reliance on the expertise of the medical\nprofession.\n   By failing to take into account the SEM and setting a\nstrict cutoff at 70, Florida \u201cgoes against the unanimous\nprofessional consensus.\u201d APA Brief 15. Neither Florida\nnor its amici point to a single medical professional who\nsupports this cutoff. The DSM\u20135 repudiates it: \u201cIQ test\nscores are approximations of conceptual functioning but\nmay be insufficient to assess reasoning in real-life situa\u00ad\ntions and mastery of practical tasks.\u201d DSM\u20135, at 37. This\nstatement well captures the Court\u2019s independent assess\u00ad\nment that an individual with an IQ test score \u201cbetween 70\nand 75 or lower,\u201d Atkins, supra, at 309, n. 5, may show\nintellectual disability by presenting additional evidence\nregarding difficulties in adaptive functioning.\n   The flaws in Florida\u2019s law are the result of the inherent\nerror in IQ tests themselves. An IQ score is an approxi\u00ad\nmation, not a final and infallible assessment of intellectual\nfunctioning. See APA Brief 24 (\u201c[I]t is standard pyscho\u00ad\nmetric practice to report the \u2018estimates of relevant reliabil\u00ad\nities and standard errors of measurement\u2019 when reporting\na test score\u201d); ibid. (the margin of error is \u201cinherent to the\naccuracy of IQ scores\u201d); Furr, Psychometrics, at 119\n(\u201c[T]he standard error of measurement is an important\npsychometric value with implications for applied meas\u00ad\nurement\u201d). SEM is not a concept peculiar to the psychiat\u00ad\nric profession and IQ tests. It is a measure that is recog\u00ad\nnized and relied upon by those who create and devise tests\nof all sorts. Id., at 118 (identifying the SEM as \u201cone of the\nmost important concepts in measurement theory\u201d).\n   This awareness of the IQ test\u2019s limits is of particular\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

See\nDSM\u20135, at 37. Courts must recognize, as does the medical\ncommunity, that the IQ test is imprecise. This is not to\nsay that an IQ test score is unhelpful. It is of considerable\nsignificance, as the medical community recognizes. But in\nusing these scores to assess a defendant\u2019s eligibility for the\ndeath penalty, a State must afford these test scores the\nsame studied skepticism that those who design and use\nthe tests do, and understand that an IQ test score repre\u00ad\nsents a range rather than a fixed number. A State that\nignores the inherent imprecision of these tests risks exe\u00ad\ncuting a person who suffers from intellectual disability.\nSee APA Brief 17 (\u201cUnder the universally accepted clinical\nstandards for diagnosing intellectual disability, the court\u2019s\ndetermination that Mr. Hall is not intellectually disabled\ncannot be considered valid\u201d).\n   This Court agrees with the medical experts that when a\ndefendant\u2019s IQ test score falls within the test\u2019s acknowl\u00ad\nedged and inherent margin of error, the defendant must\nbe able to present additional evidence of intellectual disa\u00ad\nbility, including testimony regarding adaptive deficits.\n   It is not sound to view a single factor as dispositive of a\nconjunctive and interrelated assessment. See DSM\u20135, at\n37 (\u201c[A] person with an IQ score above 70 may have such\nsevere adaptive behavior problems . . . that the person\u2019s\nactual functioning is comparable to that of individuals\nwith a lower IQ score\u201d). The Florida statute, as interpreted\nby its courts, misuses IQ score on its own terms; and\n22                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthis, in turn, bars consideration of evidence that must be\nconsidered in determining whether a defendant in a capi\u00ad\ntal case has intellectual disability. Florida\u2019s rule is invalid\nunder the Constitution\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishments\nClause.\n                               E\n   Florida seeks to execute a man because he scored a 71\ninstead of 70 on an IQ test. Florida is one of just a few\nStates to have this rigid rule. Florida\u2019s rule misconstrues\nthe Court\u2019s statements in Atkins that intellectually dis\u00ad\nability is characterized by an IQ of \u201capproximately 70.\u201d 536\nU. S., at 308, n. 3. Florida\u2019s rule is in direct opposition to\nthe views of those who design, administer, and interpret\nthe IQ test. By failing to take into account the standard\nerror of measurement, Florida\u2019s law not only contradicts\nthe test\u2019s own design but also bars an essential part of a\nsentencing court\u2019s inquiry into adaptive functioning.\nFreddie Lee Hall may or may not be intellectually dis\u00ad\nabled, but the law requires that he have the opportunity to\npresent evidence of his intellectual disability, including\ndeficits in adaptive functioning over his lifetime.\n   The death penalty is the gravest sentence our society\nmay impose. Persons facing that most severe sanction\nmust have a fair opportunity to show that the Constitution\nprohibits their execution. Florida\u2019s law contravenes our\nNation\u2019s commitment to dignity and its duty to teach\nhuman decency as the mark of a civilized world. The\nStates are laboratories for experimentation, but those\nexperiments may not deny the basic dignity the Constitu\u00ad\ntion protects.\n   The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.\n                                                   So ordered.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), the Court\nheld that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a death sen\u00ad\ntence for defendants who are intellectually disabled but\ndoes not mandate the use of a single method for identify\u00ad\ning such defendants. Today, the Court overrules the latter\nholding based largely on the positions adopted by private\nprofessional associations. In taking this step, the Court\nsharply departs from the framework prescribed in prior\nEighth Amendment cases and adopts a uniform national\nrule that is both conceptually unsound and likely to result\nin confusion. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  The Court\u2019s approach in this case marks a new and most\nunwise turn in our Eighth Amendment case law. In At-\nkins and other cases, the Court held that the prohibition of\ncruel and unusual punishment embodies the \u201cevolving\nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing\nsociety,\u201d and the Court explained that \u201cthose evolving\nstandards should be informed by objective factors to the\nmaximum possible extent.\u201d Id., at 312 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In addition, the Court \u201cpinpointed that\nthe clearest and most reliable objective evidence of con\u00ad\ntemporary values is the legislation enacted by the coun\u00ad\n2                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntry\u2019s legislatures.\u201d Ibid.\n  In these prior cases, when the Court referred to the\nevolving standards of a maturing \u201csociety,\u201d the Court\nmeant the standards of American society as a whole. Now,\nhowever, the Court strikes down a state law based on the\nevolving standards of professional societies, most notably\nthe American Psychiatric Association (APA). The Court\nbegins its analysis with the views of those associations,\nsee ante, at 7\u201312, and then, after briefly discussing the\nenactments of state legislatures, see ante, at 12\u201316, re\u00ad\nturns to the associations\u2019 views in interpreting Atkins and\nin exercising the Court\u2019s \u201cindependent judgment\u201d on the\nconstitutionality of Florida\u2019s law, see ante, at 16\u201322. This\napproach cannot be reconciled with the framework pre\u00ad\nscribed by our Eighth Amendment cases.\n                              A\n   Under this Court\u2019s modern Eighth Amendment prece\u00ad\ndents, whether a punishment is \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d de\u00ad\npends on currently prevailing societal norms, and the\nCourt has long held that laws enacted by state legislatures\nprovide the \u201cclearest and most reliable objective evidence\nof contemporary values,\u201d Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302,\n331 (1989). This is so because \u201cin a democratic society[,]\nlegislatures, not courts, are constituted to respond to the\nwill and consequently the moral values of the people,\u201d\nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U.

Under this approach, as origi\u00ad\nnally conceived, the Court first asked whether a chal\u00ad\nlenged practice contravened a clear national consensus\nevidenced by state legislation, and only if such a consen\u00ad\nsus was found would the Court go on and ask \u201cwhether\nthere is reason to disagree with [the States\u2019] judgment.\u201d\nAtkins, 536 U.

The Court therefore \u201cle[ft]\nto the States the task of developing appropriate ways\u201d to\nidentify these defendants. Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nand alteration omitted). As we noted just five years ago,\nAtkins \u201cdid not provide definitive procedural or substan\u00ad\ntive guides for determining when a person\u201d is intellectually\ndisabled. Bobby v. Bies, 556 U. S. 825, 831 (2009).\n                              B\n  Consistent with the role that Atkins left for the States,\nFlorida follows the procedure now at issue. As we ex\u00ad\nplained in Atkins, in order for a defendant to qualify as\nintellectually disabled, three separate requirements must\nbe met: It must be shown that a defendant has both\n(1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and\n(2) deficits in adaptive behavior, and that (3) the onset of\nboth factors occurred before the age of 18. See 536 U. S.,\nat 318; ante, at 8. In implementing this framework, Flor\u00ad\nida has determined that the first requirement cannot be\nsatisfied if the defendant scores higher than 70 on IQ\ntests, the long-accepted method of measuring intellectual\n4                         HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfunctioning.1 The Court today holds that this scheme\noffends the Eighth Amendment. The Court objects that\nFlorida\u2019s approach treats IQ test scores as conclusive and\nignores the fact that an IQ score might not reflect \u201ctrue\u201d\nIQ because of errors in measurement. The Court then\nconcludes that a State must view a defendant\u2019s IQ as a\nrange of potential scores calculated using a statistical\nconcept known as the \u201cstandard error of measurement\u201d or\nSEM. See Part II\u2013B\u20131, infra. The Court holds that if this\nrange includes an IQ of 70 or below (the accepted level for\nintellectual disability), the defendant must be permitted to\nproduce other evidence of intellectual disability in addition\nto IQ scores.\n  I see no support for this holding in our traditional ap\u00ad\nproach for identifying our society\u2019s evolving standards of\ndecency. Under any fair analysis of current state laws,\nthe same absence of a consensus that this Court found in\nAtkins persists today. It is telling that Hall himself does\nnot rely on a consensus among States. He candidly argues\ninstead that \u201cthe precise number of States that share\nFlorida\u2019s approach is immaterial.\u201d Reply Brief 2.\n  The Court\u2019s analysis is more aggressive. According to\nthe Court, a \u201csignificant majority of States\u201d reject Florida\u2019s\n\u201cstrict 70 cutoff \u201d and instead take \u201cthe SEM into account\u201d\nwhen deciding whether a defendant meets the first re\u00ad\nquirement of the intellectual-disability test. Ante, at 12,\n16. On the Court\u2019s count, \u201cat most nine States mandate a\nstrict IQ score cutoff at 70\u201d; 22 States allow defendants to\npresent \u201cadditional evidence\u201d when an individual\u2019s test\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 See, e.g., American Association of Intellectual and Developmental\n\nDisabilities (AAIDD), Intellectual Disability 10\u201311 (11th ed. 2010)\n(hereinafter AAIDD 11th ed.)

From these numbers, the Court\nconcludes that \u201cin 41 States\u201d a defendant \u201cwith an IQ\nscore of 71\u201d would \u201cnot be deemed automatically eligible\nfor the death penalty.\u201d Ibid.3 This analysis is deeply\nflawed.\n   To begin, in addition to the 8 other States that the Court\nrecognizes as having rules similar to Florida\u2019s, 1 more,\nIdaho, does not appear to require courts to take the SEM\ninto account in rejecting a claim of intellectual disability.4\nAnd of the remaining 21 States with the death penalty, 9\nhave either said nothing about the SEM or have not clari\u00ad\nfied whether they require its use.5 Accordingly, of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2I  assume that by \u201cadditional evidence\u201d the Court means evidence\nother than further IQ testing because Florida\u2019s rule already \u201callows for\nmultiple evaluations, and . . .

Two States have not defined \u201csignificantly subaverage\u201d intel\u00ad\nlectual functioning. See Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a718\u20131.3\u20131101(2) (2013);\nS. C.

Two States have statutes that impose rebuttable presump\u00ad\ntions of intellectual disability if a defendant\u2019s IQ is below 65 or 70 but\nhave not said whether a defendant would be allowed to provide further\nevidence if his IQ were over 70.

FLORIDA\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ndeath-penalty states, 10 (including Florida) do not require\nthat the SEM be taken into account, 12 consider the SEM,\nand 9 have not taken a definitive position on this question.\nThese statistics cannot be regarded as establishing a\nnational consensus against Florida\u2019s approach.\n  Attempting to circumvent these statistics, the Court\nincludes in its count the 19 States that never impose the\ndeath penalty, but this maneuver cannot be justified. It is\ntrue that the Court has counted non-death-penalty States\nin some prior Eighth Amendment cases, but those cases\nconcerned the substantive question whether a class of\nindividuals should be categorically ineligible for the death\npenalty. In Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), for\nexample, the Court counted non-death-penalty States as\npart of the consensus against the imposition of a capital\nsentence for a crime committed by a minor. Id., at 574.\nThe Court reasoned that a State\u2019s decision to abolish the\ndeath penalty necessarily \u201cdemonstrates a judgment that\nthe death penalty is inappropriate for all offenders, includ\u00ad\ning juveniles.\u201d Ibid.\n  No similar reasoning is possible here. The fact that a\nState has abolished the death penalty says nothing about\nhow that State would resolve the evidentiary problem of\nidentifying defendants who are intellectually disabled. As\nI explain below, a State may reasonably conclude that\nFlorida\u2019s approach is fairer than and just as accurate as\nthe approach that the Court now requires, and therefore it\ncannot be inferred that a non-death-penalty State, if\nforced to choose between the two approaches, would neces\u00ad\nsarily select the Court\u2019s. For all these reasons, it is quite\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nmust prove deficits in adaptive behavior despite having an IQ below 70.\n\nSee Stripling v.

Ante, at 16.\n  Not only are the States divided on the question whether\nthe SEM should play a role in determining whether a\ncapital defendant is intellectually disabled, but the States\nthat require consideration of the SEM do not agree on the\nrole that the SEM should play. Those States differ, for\nexample, on the sort of evidence that can be introduced\nwhen IQ testing reveals an IQ over 70. Some require\nfurther evidence of intellectual deficits, while others per\u00ad\nmit the defendant to move on to the second prong of the\ntest and submit evidence of deficits in adaptive behavior.6\nThe fairest assessment of the current situation is that the\nStates have adopted a multitude of approaches to a very\ndifficult question.\n  In light of all this, the resolution of this case should be\nstraightforward: Just as there was no methodological\nconsensus among the States at the time of Atkins, there is\nno such consensus today. And in the absence of such a\nconsensus, we have no basis for holding that Florida\u2019s\nmethod contravenes our society\u2019s standards of decency.\n                            C\n   Perhaps because it recognizes the weakness of its argu\u00ad\nments about a true national consensus, the Court places\nheavy reliance on the views (some only recently an\u00ad\nnounced) of professional organizations, but the Court\nattempts to downplay the degree to which its decision is\ndependent upon the views of these private groups. In a\ngame attempt to shoehorn the views of these associations\ninto the national-consensus calculus, the Court reasons as\nfollows. The views of these associations, the Court states,\nhelp in determining \u201chow [IQ] scores relate to the holding\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Compare Ybarra v.

FLORIDA\n\n                        ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nin Atkins\u201d; \u201c[t]his in turn leads to a better understanding\nof how the legislative policies of various States, and the\nholdings of state courts, implement the Atkins rule\u201d; and\n\u201c[t]hat understanding informs our determination whether\nthere is a consensus that instructs how to decide the spe\u00ad\ncific issue presented here.\u201d Ante, at 7.\n   I cannot follow the Court\u2019s logic. Under our modern\nEighth Amendment cases, what counts are our society\u2019s\nstandards\u2014which is to say, the standards of the American\npeople\u2014not the standards of professional associations,\nwhich at best represent the views of a small professional\nelite.\n   The Court also mistakenly suggests that its methodol\u00ad\nogy is dictated by Atkins. See ante, at 16\u201319. On the con-\ntrary, Atkins expressly left \u201cto the States\u201d the task of\ndefining intellectual disability. And although the Atkins\nCourt perceived a \u201cprofessional consensus\u201d about the best\nprocedure to be used in identifying the intellectually dis\u00ad\nabled, the Atkins Court declined to import that view into\nthe law. 536 U. S., at 316, n. 21. Instead, the Court made\nclear that this professional consensus was \u201cby no means\ndispositive.\u201d Id., at 317, n. 21; see id., at 317, and n. 22.\n                              D\n  The Court\u2019s reliance on the views of professional associ\u00ad\nations will also lead to serious practical problems. I will\nbriefly note a few.\n  First, because the views of professional associations\noften change,7 tying Eighth Amendment law to these\nviews will lead to instability and continue to fuel pro\u00ad\ntracted litigation. This danger is dramatically illustrated\nby the most recent publication of the APA, on which the\nCourt relies. This publication fundamentally alters the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See Forensic Psychology and Neuropsychology for Criminal and\n\nCivil Cases 57 (H. Hall ed. 2008) (hereinafter Forensic Psychology).\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  9\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfirst prong of the longstanding, two-pronged definition of\nintellectual disability that was embraced by Atkins and\nhas been adopted by most States. In this new publication,\nthe APA discards \u201csignificantly subaverage intellectual\nfunctioning\u201d as an element of the intellectual-disability\ntest.8 Elevating the APA\u2019s current views to constitutional\nsignificance therefore throws into question the basic ap\u00ad\nproach that Atkins approved and that most of the States\nhave followed.\n   It is also noteworthy that changes adopted by profes\u00ad\nsional associations are sometimes rescinded. For example,\nin 1992 the AAIDD extended the baseline \u201cintellectual\nfunctioning cutoff \u201d from an \u201cIQ of 70 or below\u201d to a \u201cscore\nof approximately 70 to 75 or below.\u201d AAIDD 11th ed. 10\n(Table 1.3) (boldface deleted); see 2 Kaplan & Sadock\u2019s\nComprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 3449 (B. Sadock,\nV. Sadock, & P. Ruiz eds., 9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter\nKaplan & Sadock\u2019s). That change \u201cgenerated much con\u00ad\ntroversy\u201d; by 2000, \u201conly 4 states used the 1992 AAIDD\ndefinition, with 44 states continuing to use the 1983 defi\u00ad\nnition.\u201d Ibid. And in the 2002 AAIDD, the baseline \u201cIQ\ncut-off was changed\u201d back to approximately \u201c70 or less.\u201d\nIbid.\n   Second, the Court\u2019s approach implicitly calls upon the\nJudiciary either to follow every new change in the think\u00ad\ning of these professional organizations or to judge the\nvalidity of each new change. Here, for example, the Court\ntacitly makes the judgment that the diagnostic criteria for\nintellectual disability that prevailed at the time when\nAtkins was decided are no longer legitimate. The publica\u00ad\ntions that Atkins cited differ markedly from more recent\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Compare   APA, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor\u00ad\nders 39, 41, 42 (rev. 4th ed. 2000) (hereinafter DSM\u2013IV\u2013TR), with APA,\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 33, 809 (5th\ned. 2013) (hereinafter DSM\u20135).\n10                   HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\neditions now endorsed by the Court. See 536 U. S., at 308,\nn. 3.\n   Third, the Court\u2019s approach requires the Judiciary to\ndetermine which professional organizations are entitled to\nspecial deference. And what if professional organizations\ndisagree? The Court provides no guidance for deciding\nwhich organizations\u2019 views should govern.\n   Fourth, the Court binds Eighth Amendment law to\ndefinitions of intellectual disability that are promulgated\nfor use in making a variety of decisions that are quite\ndifferent from the decision whether the imposition of a\ndeath sentence in a particular case would serve a valid\npenological end. In a death-penalty case, intellectual\nfunctioning is important because of its correlation with the\nability to understand the gravity of the crime and the\npurpose of the penalty, as well as the ability to resist a\nmomentary impulse or the influence of others. See id., at\n318, 320. By contrast, in determining eligibility for social\nservices, adaptive functioning may be much more im\u00ad\nportant. Cf. DSM\u2013IV\u2013TR, at xxxvii (clinical \u201cconsidera\u00ad\ntions\u201d may not be \u201crelevant to legal judgments\u201d that turn\non \u201cindividual responsibility\u201d); DSM\u20135, at 20 (similar).\nPractical problems like these call for legislative judg\u00ad\nments, not judicial resolution.\n                              II\n   Because I find no consensus among the States, I would\nnot independently assess the method that Florida has\nadopted for determining intellectual disability. But even\nif it were appropriate for us to look beyond the evidence of\nsocietal standards, I could not conclude that Florida\u2019s\nmethod is unconstitutional. The Court faults Florida for\n\u201ctak[ing] an IQ score as final and conclusive evidence of a\ndefendant\u2019s intellectual capacity\u201d and for failing to recog\u00ad\nnize that an IQ score may be imprecise. Ante, at 10. In\nmy view, however, Florida has adopted a sensible stand\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

And\nalthough the Court entirely ignores this part of the Florida\nscheme, the State takes into account the inevitable risk of\ntesting error by permitting defendants to introduce multi\u00ad\nple scores.\n  In contrast, the Court establishes a standard that\nconflates what have long been understood to be two inde-\npendent requirements for proving intellectual disability:\n(1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and\n(2) deficits in adaptive behavior. The Court also mandates\nuse of an alternative method of dealing with the risk of\ntesting error without any hint that it is more accurate\nthan Florida\u2019s approach.\n                              A\n                              1\n   The first supposed error that the Court identifies is that\nFlorida \u201ctakes an IQ score\u201d as \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d of\nintellectual functioning. Ante, at 10. As an initial matter,\none would get the impression from reading the Court\u2019s\nopinion that Hall introduced only one test score (of 71).\nSee ante, at 14. In truth, the Florida courts considered\nmultiple scores, all above 70, on the particular IQ test that\nHall has dubbed the \u201cgold standard.\u201d See Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 50; App. 107\u2013108.9 Florida\u2019s statute imposes no\nlimit on the number of IQ scores that a defendant may\nintroduce, so the Court is simply wrong to analyze the\nFlorida system as one that views a single IQ score above\n70 as \u201cfinal and conclusive evidence\u201d that a defendant does\nnot suffer from subaverage intellectual functioning. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 See Brief for Petitioner 50 (listing his valid IQ scores of 71, 72, 73,\n\nand 80). Hall alleges that he also scored a 69 on a Wechsler test, but\nthat score was not admitted into evidence because of doubts about its\nvalidity. App. 107. Hall does not allege that any potential \u201cpractice\neffect\u201d skewed his scores.\n12                          HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                            ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nBrief for Respondent 44 (\u201cFlorida\u2019s Rule allows for multi\u00ad\nple evaluations, and if Hall believed a statistical error rate\nprevented any of his tests from reflecting his true score, he\ncould have sought still more testing\u201d).\n   The proper question to ask, therefore, is whether Flor\u00ad\nida\u2019s actual approach falls outside the range of discretion\nallowed by Atkins. The Court offers no persuasive reason\nfor concluding that it does. Indeed, the Court\u2019s opinion\nnever identifies what other evidence of intellectual func\u00ad\ntioning it would require Florida to admit. As we recog\u00ad\nnized in Atkins, the longstanding practices of the States,\nand at least the previous views of professional organiza\u00ad\ntions, seem to reflect the understanding that IQ scores are\nthe best way to measure intellectual functioning. See 536\nU. S., at 316.10 Until its most recent publication, the APA,\nfor example, ranked the severity of intellectual disability\nexclusively by IQ scores, necessarily pinpointing the onset\nof the disability according to IQ. See DSM\u2013IV\u2013TR, at 42.\n   We have been presented with no solid evidence that the\nlongstanding reliance on multiple IQ test scores as a\nmeasure of intellectual functioning is so unreasonable or\noutside the ordinary as to be unconstitutional.

See ante, at 9\u201310, 12, 20. That is a re\u00ad\nmarkable change in what we took to be a universal under\u00ad\nstanding of intellectual disability just 12 years ago.\n   In Atkins, we instructed that \u201cclinical definitions of\nmental retardation require not only [(1)] subaverage intel\u00ad\nlectual functioning, but also [(2)] significant limitations in\nadaptive skills.\u201d 536 U. S., at 318 (emphasis and altera\u00ad\ntions added). That is the approach taken by the vast\nmajority of States.11 As the Court correctly recognizes,\nmost States require \u201cconcurrent deficits\u201d in intellectual\nfunctioning and adaptive behavior, requiring defendants\nto prove both. Ante, at 8 (emphasis added).12\n   Yet the Court now holds that when a defendant\u2019s IQ\nscore is as high as 75, a court must \u201cconsider factors indi\u00ad\ncating whether the person has deficits in adaptive func\u00ad\ntioning.\u201d Ante, at 12; see ante, at 9\u201310, 20. In other\nwords, even when a defendant has failed to show that he\nmeets the first prong of the well-accepted standard for\nintellectual disability (significantly subaverage intellec\u00ad\ntual functioning), evidence of the second prong (deficits in\nadaptive behavior) can establish intellectual disability.\n   The Court offers little explanation for this sea change.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a74209 (2007); Idaho Code \u00a719\u2013\n\n2515A; Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7174.098 (2013); Va. Code Ann. \u00a719.2\u2013264.3:1.1\n(Lexis Cum. Supp. 2013).\n   12 The longstanding views of professional organizations have also\n\nbeen that intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior are independ\u00ad\nent factors. See, e.g., DSM\u2013IV\u2013TR, at 39. These organizations might\nrecommend examining evidence of adaptive behavior even when an IQ\nis above 70, but that sheds no light on what the legal rule should be\ngiven that most States appear to require defendants to prove each\nprong separately by a preponderance of the evidence.\n14                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nIt asserts vaguely that \u201c[i]t is not sound to view a single\nfactor as dispositive of a conjunctive and interrelated\nassessment.\u201d Ante, at 21. But the Court ignores the fact\nthat deficits in adaptive behavior cannot be used to estab\u00ad\nlish deficits in mental functioning because the two prongs\nare meant to show distinct components of intellectual\ndisability. \u201c[I]ntellectual functions\u201d include \u201creasoning,\nproblem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment,\nacademic learning, and learning from experience,\u201d while\nadaptive functioning refers to the ability \u201cto meet devel\u00ad\nopmental and sociocultural standards for personal inde\u00ad\npendence and social responsibility.\u201d          DSM\u20135, at 33.\nStrong evidence of a deficit in adaptive behavior does not\nnecessarily demonstrate a deficit in intellectual function\u00ad\ning. And without the latter, a person simply cannot be\nclassified as intellectually disabled.\n   It is particularly troubling to relax the proof require\u00ad\nments for the intellectual-functioning prong because that\nis the prong that most directly relates to the concerns that\nled to our primary holding in Atkins. There, we explained\nthat \u201cthe diminished ability to understand and process\ninformation, to learn from experience, to engage in logical\nreasoning, or to control impulses\u201d\u2014i.e., diminished intel-\nlectual functioning\u2014\u201cmake it less likely that [a defendant]\ncan process the information of the possibility of execution\nas a penalty\u201d and therefore be deterred from committing\nmurders. 536 U. S., at 320; see also id., at 318 (\u201c[T]hey\noften act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premedi\u00ad\ntated plan . . .\u201d); see also ante, at 6. A defendant who does\nnot display significantly subaverage intellectual function\u00ad\ning is therefore not among the class of defendants we\nidentified in Atkins.\n   Finally, relying primarily on proof of adaptive deficits\nwill produce inequities in the administration of capital\npunishment. As far as I can tell, adaptive behavior is a\nmalleable factor without \u201cfirm theoretical and empirical\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

No consensus\nexists among States or medical practitioners about what\nfacts are most critical in analyzing that factor, and its\nmeasurement relies largely on subjective judgments.\nFlorida\u2019s approach avoids the disparities that reliance on\nsuch a factor tends to produce. It thus promotes con\u00ad\nsistency in the application of the death penalty and confi\u00ad\ndence that it is not being administered haphazardly.\n                               B\n   The Court\u2019s second \u201cinterrelated\u201d objection to Florida\u2019s\nrule is that it fails to account for the risk of error inherent\nin IQ testing. In order to diminish this risk, the Court\nestablishes a rule that if IQ testing reveals an IQ between\n71 and 75, a claim of intellectual disability cannot be\nrejected on the basis of test scores alone. Ante, at 20. The\nCourt both misunderstands how the SEM works and fails\nto explain why Florida\u2019s method of accounting for the risk\nof error (allowing a defendant to take and rely on multiple\ntests) is not as effective as the approach that the Court\ncompels.\n                              1\n  The Court begins with the simple and uncontroversial\nproposition that every testing situation is susceptible to\nerror and thus may result in an imperfect measurement of\n\u201ctrue\u201d IQ. The Court then wades into technical matters\nthat must be understood in order to see where the Court\ngoes wrong.\n  There are various ways to account for error in IQ test\u00ad\ning. One way is Florida\u2019s approach (evaluate multiple test\nresults). Another is to use a mathematical measurement\ncalled the \u201cstandard error of measurement\u201d or SEM. See\nAAMR 10th ed. 67\u201371 (App. 4.1). Of critical importance,\nthere is not a single, uniform SEM across IQ tests or even\nacross test-takers. Rather, \u201cthe [SEM] varies by test,\n16                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsubgroup, and age group.\u201d User\u2019s Guide To Accompany\nAAIDD 11th ed.: Definition, Classification, and Systems of\nSupports 22 (2012).\n   Once we know the SEM for a particular test and a par\u00ad\nticular test-taker, adding one SEM to and subtracting one\nSEM from the obtained score establishes an interval of\nscores known as the 66% confidence interval. See AAMR\n10th ed. 57. That interval represents the range of scores\nwithin which \u201cwe are [66%] sure\u201d that the \u201ctrue\u201d IQ falls.\nSee Oxford Handbook of Child Psychological Assessment\n291 (D. Saklofske, C. Reynolds, & V. Schwean eds. 2013).\nThe interval is centered on the obtained score, and it\nincludes scores that are above and below that score by the\namount of the SEM. Since there is about a 66% chance\nthat the test-taker\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d IQ falls within this range, there\nis about a 34% chance that the \u201ctrue\u201d IQ falls outside the\ninterval, with approximately equal odds that it falls above\nthe interval (17%) or below the interval (17%).\n   An example: If a test-taker scores a 72 on an IQ test\nwith a SEM of 2, the 66% confidence interval is the range\nof 70 to 74 (72 \u00b1 2). In this situation, there is approxi\u00ad\nmately a 66% chance that the test-taker\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d IQ is\nbetween 70 and 74; roughly a 17% chance that it is above\n74; and roughly a 17% chance that it is 70 or below. Thus,\nthere is about an 83% chance that the score is above 70.\n   Similarly, using two SEMs, we can build a 95% confi\u00ad\ndence interval. The process is the same except that we\nadd two SEMs to and subtract two SEMS from the ob\u00ad\ntained score. To illustrate the use of two SEMs, let us\nhypothesize a case in which the defendant\u2019s obtained score\nis 74. With the same SEM of 2 as in the prior example,\nthere would be a 95% chance that the true score is be\u00ad\ntween 70 and 78 (74 \u00b1 4); roughly a 2.5% chance that the\nscore is above 78; and about a 2.5% chance that the score\nis 70 or below. The probability of a true score above 70\nwould be roughly 97.5%. As these two examples show, the\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

See ante, at 20. That\nassumption gives rise to the Court\u2019s holding that a de\u00ad\nfendant must be permitted to introduce additional evi\u00ad\ndence when IQ tests reveal an IQ as high as 75. See ibid.\nSEMs, however, vary by IQ test and test-taker, and there\nis no reason to assume a SEM of 5 points; indeed, it ap\u00ad\npears that the SEM is generally \u201cestimated to be three to\nfive points\u201d for well-standardized IQ tests. AAMR 10th ed.\n57. And we know that the SEM for Hall\u2019s most recent IQ\ntest was 2.16\u2014less than half of the Court\u2019s estimate of 5.\nBrief for Petitioner 40, n. 17.\n   Relatedly, the Court misreads the authorities on which\nit relies to establish this cutoff IQ score of 75. It is true\nthat certain professional organizations have advocated a\ncutoff of 75 and that Atkins cited those organizations\u2019\ncutoff. See ante, at 12, 20. But the Court overlooks a\ncritical fact: Those organizations endorsed a 75 IQ cutoff\nbased on their express understanding that \u201cone standard\nerror of measurement [SEM]\u201d is \u201cthree to five points for\nwell-standardized\u201d IQ tests. AAMR, Mental Retardation\n37 (9th ed. 1992) (hereinafter AAMR 9th ed.); Atkins, 536\nU. S., 309, n. 5 (citing AAMR 9th ed.; 2 Kaplan & Sadock\u2019s\n2592 (B. Sadock & V. Sadock eds., 7th ed. 2000)); see also\nAAMR 10th ed. 57; AAIDD 11th ed. 36. In other words,\nthe number 75 was relevant only to the extent that a\n18                    HALL v. FLORIDA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsingle SEM was \u201cestimated\u201d to be as high as 5 points.\nAAMR 9th ed. 37. Here, by contrast, we know that the\nSEM for Hall\u2019s latest IQ test was less than half of that\nestimate; there is no relevance to the number 75 in this\ncase. To blindly import a five-point margin of error when\nwe know as a matter of fact that the relevant SEM is 2.16\namounts to requiring consideration of more than two\nSEMs\u2014an approach that finds no support in Atkins or\nanywhere else.\n   Because of these factual errors and ambiguities, it is\nunclear to me whether the Court concludes that a defend\u00ad\nant is constitutionally entitled to introduce non-test evi\u00ad\ndence of intellectual disability (1) whenever his score is 75\nor lower, on the mistaken understanding that the SEM for\nmost tests is 5; (2) when the 66% confidence interval\n(using one SEM) includes a score of 70; or (3) when the\n95% confidence interval (using two SEMs) includes a score\nof 70. In my view, none of these approaches is defensible.\n   An approach tied to a fixed score of 75 can be dismissed\nout of hand because, as discussed, every test has a differ\u00ad\nent SEM.\n   The other two approaches would require that a defend\u00ad\nant be permitted to submit additional evidence when his\nIQ is above 70 so long as the 66% or 95% confidence inter\u00ad\nval (using one SEM or two SEMs, respectively) includes a\nscore of 70, but there is no foundation for this in our\nEighth Amendment case law. As Hall concedes, the\nEighth Amendment permits States to assign to a defend\u00ad\nant the burden of establishing intellectual disability by at\nleast a preponderance of the evidence. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n12. In other words, a defendant can be required to prove\nthat the probability of a 70 or sub-70 IQ is greater than\n50%. Under the Court\u2019s approach, by contrast, a defend\u00ad\nant could prove significantly subaverage intellectual func\u00ad\ntioning by showing simply that the probability of a \u201ctrue\u201d\nIQ of 70 or below is as little as 17% (under a one-SEM\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 19\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nrule) or 2.5% (under a two-SEM rule). This totally trans\u00ad\nforms the allocation and nature of the burden of proof.\n   I have referred to the 66% and 95% confidence intervals\nonly because they result from the most straightforward\napplication of the SEM in this context: One SEM estab\u00ad\nlishes the 66% confidence interval; two SEMs establish the\n95% confidence interval. See AAIDD 11th ed. 36. But it\nwould be simple enough to devise a 51% confidence inter\u00ad\nval\u2014or a 99% confidence interval for that matter. There\nis therefore no excuse for mechanically imposing stand\u00ad\nards that are unhinged from legal logic and that over-\nride valid state laws establishing burdens of proof. The\nappropriate confidence level is ultimately a judgment best\nleft to legislatures, and their judgment has been that a\ndefendant must establish that it is more likely than not\nthat he is intellectually disabled. I would defer to that\ndetermination.\n                             3\n  The Court also fails to grasp that Florida\u2019s system al\u00ad\nready accounts for the risk of testing error by allowing the\nintroduction of multiple test scores. The Court never\nexplains why its criticisms of the uncertainty resulting\nfrom the use of a single IQ score apply when a defendant\nconsistently scores above 70 on multiple tests. Contrary to\nthe Court\u2019s evident assumption, the well-accepted view is\nthat multiple consistent scores establish a much higher\ndegree of confidence.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 See Oxford Handbook of Child Psychological Assessment 291\n\n(D.

That\nargument proves too much: If potential flaws in administering multiple\ntests are sufficient to render them inaccurate, the Court should con\u00ad\nclude that even scores of 90 or 100 are not sufficient. The appropriate\nremedy for incorrectly administered tests is for a court to disregard\nthose tests, not to ignore the well-established fact that multiple, prop-\nerly administered tests yielding scores above 70 can give a high degree\nof confidence that an individual is not intellectually disabled.\n</pre>",
