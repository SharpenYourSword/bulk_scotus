Argued April 23, 2014\u2014Decided June 19, 2014\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued summonses to respondents\n  for information and records relevant to the tax obligations of Dynamo\n  Holdings L. P. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a77602(a). When respondents failed to\n  comply, the IRS brought an enforcement action in District Court.\n  Respondents challenged the IRS\u2019s motives in issuing the summonses,\n  seeking to question the responsible agents. The District Court denied\n  the request and ordered the summonses enforced, characterizing re-\n  spondents\u2019 arguments as conjecture and incorrect as a matter of law.\n  The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that the District Court\u2019s re-\n  fusal to allow respondents to examine the agents constituted an\n  abuse of discretion, and that Circuit precedent entitled them to con-\n  duct such questioning regardless of whether they had presented any\n  factual support for their claims.\nHeld: A taxpayer has a right to conduct an examination of IRS officials\n regarding their reasons for issuing a summons when he points to spe-\n cific facts or circumstances plausibly raising an inference of bad faith.\n Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (a) A person receiving a summons is entitled to contest it in an ad-\n versarial enforcement proceeding.

The balance struck in this Court\u2019s\n prior cases supports a requirement that a summons objector offer not\n just naked allegations, but some credible evidence to support his\n claim of improper motive. Circumstantial evidence can suffice to\n meet that burden, and a fleshed out case is not demanded: The tax-\n payer need only present a plausible basis for his charge.

MICHAEL \n\n                CLARKE ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 19, 2014] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Internal Revenue Service (IRS or Service) has broad\nstatutory authority to summon a taxpayer to produce\ndocuments or give testimony relevant to determining tax\nliability. If the taxpayer fails to comply, the IRS may\npetition a federal district court to enforce the summons.\nIn an enforcement proceeding, the IRS must show that it\nissued the summons in good faith.\n   This case requires us to consider when a taxpayer, as\npart of such a proceeding, has a right to question IRS\nofficials about their reasons for issuing a summons. We\nhold, contrary to the Court of Appeals below, that a bare\nallegation of improper purpose does not entitle a taxpayer\nto examine IRS officials. Rather, the taxpayer has a right\nto conduct that examination when he points to specific\nfacts or circumstances plausibly raising an inference of\nbad faith.\n                             I\n  Congress has \u201cauthorized and required\u201d the IRS \u201cto\nmake the inquiries, determinations, and assessments of\nall taxes\u201d the Internal Revenue Code imposes. 26 U. S. C.\n2                  UNITED STATES v. CLARKE\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a76201(a). And in support of that authority, Congress has\ngranted the Service broad latitude to issue summonses\n\u201c[f]or the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any\nreturn, making a return where none has been made, de-\ntermining the liability of any person for any internal\nrevenue tax . . . , or collecting any such liability.\u201d\n\u00a77602(a). Such a summons directs a taxpayer (or associ-\nated person1) to appear before an IRS official and to pro-\nvide sworn testimony or produce \u201cbooks, papers, records,\nor other data . . . relevant or material to [a tax] inquiry.\u201d\n\u00a77602(a)(1).\n   If a taxpayer does not comply with a summons, the IRS\nmay bring an enforcement action in district court. See\n\u00a7\u00a77402(b), 7604(a). In that proceeding, we have held, the\nIRS \u201cneed only demonstrate good faith in issuing the\nsummons.\u201d United States v. Stuart, 489 U. S. 353, 359\n(1989). More specifically, that means establishing what\nhave become known as the Powell factors: \u201cthat the inves-\ntigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate pur-\npose, that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose, that\nthe information sought is not already within the [IRS\u2019s]\npossession, and that the administrative steps required by\nthe [Internal Revenue] Code have been followed.\u201d United\nStates v. Powell, 379 U. S. 48, 57\u201358 (1964). To make that\nshowing, the IRS usually files an affidavit from the re-\nsponsible investigating agent. See Stuart, 489 U. S., at\n360. The taxpayer, however, has an opportunity to chal-\nlenge that affidavit, and to urge the court to quash the\n\nsummons \u201con any appropriate ground\u201d\u2014including, as\n\nrelevant here, improper purpose. See Reisman v. Caplin, \n\n375 U. S. 440, 449 (1964). \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n  1 The IRS has authority to summon not only \u201cthe person liable for\n\ntax,\u201d but also \u201cany officer or employee of such person,\u201d any person\nhaving custody of relevant \u201cbooks of account,\u201d and \u201cany other person\nthe [IRS] may deem proper.\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a77602(a)(2). For convenience,\nthis opinion refers only to the \u201ctaxpayer.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The summons dispute in this case arose from an IRS\nexamination of the tax returns of Dynamo Holdings Lim-\nited Partnership (Dynamo) for the 2005\u20132007 tax years.\nThe IRS harbored suspicions about large interest expenses\nthat those returns had reported. As its investigation\nproceeded, the Service persuaded Dynamo to agree to two\nyear-long extensions of the usual 3-year limitations period\nfor assessing tax liability; in 2010, with that period again\ndrawing to a close, Dynamo refused to grant the IRS a\nthird extension. Shortly thereafter, in September and\nOctober 2010, the IRS issued summonses to the respond-\nents here, four individuals associated with Dynamo whom\nthe Service believed had information and records relevant\nto Dynamo\u2019s tax obligations. None of the respondents\ncomplied with those summonses. In December 2010 (still\nwithin the augmented limitations period), the IRS issued a\nFinal Partnership Administrative Adjustment proposing\nchanges to Dynamo\u2019s returns that would result in greater\ntax liability. Dynamo responded in February 2011 by\nfiling suit in the United States Tax Court to challenge the\nadjustments. That litigation remains pending. A few\nmonths later, in April 2011, the IRS instituted proceed-\nings in District Court to compel the respondents to comply\nwith the summonses they had gotten.\n   Those enforcement proceedings developed into a dispute\nabout the IRS\u2019s reasons for issuing the summonses. The\nIRS submitted an investigating agent\u2019s affidavit attesting\nto the Powell factors; among other things, that declaration\nmaintained that the testimony and records sought were\nnecessary to \u201cproperly investigate the correctness of [Dy-\nnamo\u2019s] federal tax reporting\u201d and that the summonses\nwere \u201cnot issued to harass or for any other improper pur-\npose.\u201d App. 26, 34. In reply, the respondents pointed to\ncircumstantial evidence that, in their view, suggested\n\u201culterior motive[s]\u201d of two different kinds. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 72a. First, the respondents asserted that the IRS\n4                UNITED STATES v. CLARKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nissued the summonses to \u201cpunish[ ] [Dynamo] for refusing\nto agree to a further extension of the applicable statute of\nlimitations.\u201d App. 52. More particularly, they stated in\nsworn declarations that immediately after Dynamo de-\nclined to grant a third extension of time, the IRS, \u201cdespite\nhaving not asked for additional information for some time,\n. . . suddenly issued\u201d the summonses. Id., at 95. Second,\nthe respondents averred that the IRS decided to enforce\nthe summonses, subsequent to Dynamo\u2019s filing suit in Tax\nCourt, to \u201cevad[e] the Tax Court[\u2019s] limitations on discov-\nery\u201d and thus gain an unfair advantage in that litigation.\nId., at 53. In support of that charge, the respondents\nsubmitted an affidavit from the attorney of another Dy-\nnamo associate, who had chosen to comply with a sum-\nmons issued at the same time. The attorney reported that\nonly the IRS attorneys handling the Tax Court case, and\nnot the original investigating agents, were present at the\ninterview of his client. In light of those submissions, the\nrespondents asked for an opportunity to question the\nagents about their motives.\n    The District Court denied that request and ordered the\nrespondents to comply with the summonses. According to\nthe court, the respondents \u201cha[d] made no meaningful\nallegations of improper purpose\u201d warranting examination\nof IRS agents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. The court char-\nacterized the respondents\u2019 statute-of-limitations theory as\n\u201cmere conjecture.\u201d Id., at 14a. And it ruled that the re-\nspondents\u2019 evasion-of-discovery-limits claim was \u201cincorrect\nas a matter of law\u201d because \u201c[t]he validity of a summons is\ntested as of the date of issuance,\u201d not enforcement\u2014and\nthe Tax Court proceedings had not yet begun when the\nIRS issued the summonses. Id., at 15a.\n    The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed,\nholding that the District Court\u2019s refusal to allow the re-\nspondents to examine IRS agents constituted an abuse of\ndiscretion. In support of that ruling, the Court of Appeals\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncited binding Circuit precedent holding that a simple\n\u201callegation of improper purpose,\u201d even if lacking any \u201cfac-\ntual support,\u201d entitles a taxpayer to \u201cquestion IRS officials\nconcerning the Service\u2019s reasons for issuing the summons.\u201d\n517 Fed. Appx. 689, 691 (2013) (quoting United States v.\nSoutheast First Nat. Bank of Miami Springs, 655 F. 2d\n661, 667 (CA5 1981)); see Nero Trading, LLC v. United\nStates Dept. of Treasury, 570 F. 3d 1244, 1249 (CA11 2009)\n(reaffirming Southeast).\n   Every other Court of Appeals has rejected the Eleventh\nCircuit\u2019s view that a bare allegation of improper motive\nentitles a person objecting to an IRS summons to examine\nthe responsible officials.2 We granted certiorari to resolve\nthat conflict, 571 U. S. __ (2014), and we now vacate the\nEleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion.\n                              II\n  A person receiving an IRS summons is, as we have often\nheld, entitled to contest it in an enforcement proceeding.\nSee United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U. S. 141, 146 (1975);\nPowell, 379 U. S., at 57\u201358; Reisman, 375 U. S., at 449.\nThe power \u201cvested in tax collectors may be abused, as all\npower\u201d may be abused. Bisceglia, 420 U. S., at 146. In\nrecognition of that possibility, Congress made enforcement\nof an IRS summons contingent on a court\u2019s approval. See\n26 U. S. C. \u00a77604(b). And we have time and again stated\nthat the requisite judicial proceeding is not ex parte but\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See, e.g., Sugarloaf Funding, LLC v. United States Dept. of Treas-\n\nury, 584 F. 3d 340, 350\u2013351 (CA1 2009) (requiring \u201ca sufficient thresh-\nold showing that there was an improper purpose\u201d); Fortney v. United\nStates, 59 F. 3d 117, 121 (CA9 1995) (requiring \u201csome minimal amount\nof evidence\u201d beyond \u201cmere memoranda of law or allegations\u201d (internal\nquotations and alterations omitted)); United States v. Kis, 658 F. 2d\n526, 540 (CA7 1981) (requiring \u201cdevelop[ment] [of] facts from which a\ncourt might infer a possibility of some wrongful conduct\u201d); United\nStates v. Garden State Nat. Bank, 607 F. 2d 61, 71 (CA3 1979) (requir-\ning \u201cfactual[ ] support[ ] by the taxpayer\u2019s affidavits\u201d).\n6               UNITED STATES v. CLARKE\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nadversarial. See Donaldson v. United States, 400 U. S.\n517, 527 (1971); Powell, 379 U. S., at 58; Reisman, 375\nU. S., at 446. The summoned party must receive notice,\nand may present argument and evidence on all matters\nbearing on a summons\u2019s validity. See Powell, 379 U. S.,\nat 58.\n   Yet we have also emphasized that summons enforce-\nment proceedings are to be \u201csummary in nature.\u201d Stuart,\n489 U. S., at 369. The purpose of a summons is \u201cnot to\naccuse,\u201d much less to adjudicate, but only \u201cto inquire.\u201d\nBisceglia, 420 U. S., at 146. And such an investigatory\ntool, we have recognized, is a crucial backstop in a tax\nsystem based on self-reporting. See ibid. (restricting\nsummons authority would enable \u201cdishonest persons [to]\nescap[e] taxation[,] thus shifting heavier burdens to hon-\nest taxpayers\u201d). Accordingly, we long ago held that courts\nmay ask only whether the IRS issued a summons in good\nfaith, and must eschew any broader role of \u201coversee[ing]\nthe [IRS\u2019s] determinations to investigate.\u201d Powell, 379\nU. S., at 56. So too, we stated that absent contrary evi-\ndence, the IRS can satisfy that standard by submitting a\nsimple affidavit from the investigating agent. See Stuart,\n489 U. S., at 359\u2013360. Thus, we have rejected rules that\nwould \u201cthwart and defeat the [Service\u2019s] appropriate\ninvestigatory powers.\u201d Donaldson, 400 U. S., at 533.\n   The balance we have struck in prior cases comports with\nthe following rule, applicable here: As part of the adver-\nsarial process concerning a summons\u2019s validity, the tax-\npayer is entitled to examine an IRS agent when he can\npoint to specific facts or circumstances plausibly raising\nan inference of bad faith. Naked allegations of improper\npurpose are not enough: The taxpayer must offer some\ncredible evidence supporting his charge. But circumstan-\ntial evidence can suffice to meet that burden; after all,\ndirect evidence of another person\u2019s bad faith, at this\nthreshold stage, will rarely if ever be available. And\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nalthough bare assertion or conjecture is not enough, nei-\nther is a fleshed out case demanded: The taxpayer need\nonly make a showing of facts that give rise to a plausible\ninference of improper motive. That standard will ensure\ninquiry where the facts and circumstances make inquiry\nappropriate, without turning every summons dispute into\na fishing expedition for official wrongdoing. And the rule\nis little different from the one that both the respondents\nand the Government have recommended to us.3\n   But that is not the standard the Eleventh Circuit ap-\nplied. Although the respondents gamely try to put an-\nother face on the opinion below, see Brief for Respondents\n24\u201325, and n. 17, we have no doubt that the Court of Appeals\nviewed even bare allegations of improper purpose as enti-\ntling a summons objector to question IRS agents. The\ncourt in fact had some evidence before it pertaining to the\nrespondents\u2019 charges: The respondents, for example, had\nsubmitted one declaration relating the timing of the sum-\nmonses to Dynamo\u2019s refusal to extend the limitations\nperiod, see App. 95, and another aiming to show that the\nIRS was using the summonses to obtain discovery it could\nnot get in Tax Court, see id., at 97\u2013100. But the Eleventh\nCircuit never assessed whether those (or any other) mate-\nrials plausibly supported an inference of improper motive;\nindeed, the court never mentioned the proffered evidence\nat all. Instead, and in line with Circuit precedent, the\ncourt applied a categorical rule, demanding the examina-\ntion of IRS agents even when a taxpayer made only con-\nclusory allegations. See supra, at 4. That was error. On\nremand, the Court of Appeals must consider the respond-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29 (respondents) (The taxpayer is entitled to\n\nquestion the agent \u201cwhen he presents specific facts from which an\nimproper purpose . . . may plausibly be inferred\u201d); id., at 5 (United\nStates) (\u201c[A] summons opponent has to put in enough evidence to at\nleast raise an inference\u201d of improper motive, and \u201c[c]ircumstantial\nevidence is enough\u201d).\n8                UNITED STATES v. CLARKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nents\u2019 submissions in light of the standard we have stated.\n   That consideration must as well give appropriate defer-\nence to the District Court\u2019s ruling. An appellate court, as\nthe Eleventh Circuit noted, reviews for abuse of discretion\na trial court\u2019s decision to order\u2014or not\u2014the questioning of\nIRS agents. See 517 Fed. Appx., at 691, n. 2; Tiffany Fine\nArts, Inc. v. United States, 469 U. S. 310, 324, n. 7 (1985).\nThat standard of review reflects the district court\u2019s supe-\nrior familiarity with, and understanding of, the dispute; and\nit comports with the way appellate courts review related\nmatters of case management, discovery, and trial prac-\ntice. See, e.g., Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493\nU. S. 165, 172\u2013173 (1989); Crawford-El v. Britton, 523\nU. S. 574, 599\u2013601 (1998). Accordingly, the Court of\nAppeals must take into account on remand the District\nCourt\u2019s broad discretion to determine whether a tax-\npayer has shown enough to require the examination of IRS\ninvestigators.\n   But two caveats to that instruction are in order here.\nFirst, the District Court\u2019s decision is entitled to deference\nonly if based on the correct legal standard. See Fox v.\nVice, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11) (\u201cA trial\ncourt has wide discretion when, but only when, it calls the\ngame by the right rules\u201d). We leave to the Court of Ap-\npeals the task of deciding whether the District Court\nasked and answered the relevant question\u2014once again,\nwhether the respondents pointed to specific facts or cir-\ncumstances plausibly raising an inference of improper\nmotive.\n   And second, the District Court\u2019s latitude does not extend\nto legal issues about what counts as an illicit motive.

We state no view on those issues; they\nare not within the question presented for our review. We\nnote only that they are pure questions of law, so if they\narise again on remand, the Court of Appeals has no cause\nto defer to the District Court. Cf. Koon v. United States,\n518 U.

When respondents failed to\n  comply, the IRS brought an enforcement action in District Court.\n  Respondents challenged the IRS\u2019s motives in issuing the summonses,\n  seeking to question the responsible agents. The District Court denied\n  the request and ordered the summonses enforced, characterizing re-\n  spondents\u2019 arguments as conjecture and incorrect as a matter of law.\n  The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that the District Court\u2019s re-\n  fusal to allow respondents to examine the agents constituted an\n  abuse of discretion, and that Circuit precedent entitled them to con-\n  duct such questioning regardless of whether they had presented any\n  factual support for their claims.\nHeld: A taxpayer has a right to conduct an examination of IRS officials\n regarding their reasons for issuing a summons when he points to spe-\n cific facts or circumstances plausibly raising an inference of bad faith.\n Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (a) A person receiving a summons is entitled to contest it in an ad-\n versarial enforcement proceeding.

MICHAEL \n\n                CLARKE ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 19, 2014] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Internal Revenue Service (IRS or Service) has broad\nstatutory authority to summon a taxpayer to produce\ndocuments or give testimony relevant to determining tax\nliability. If the taxpayer fails to comply, the IRS may\npetition a federal district court to enforce the summons.\nIn an enforcement proceeding, the IRS must show that it\nissued the summons in good faith.\n   This case requires us to consider when a taxpayer, as\npart of such a proceeding, has a right to question IRS\nofficials about their reasons for issuing a summons. We\nhold, contrary to the Court of Appeals below, that a bare\nallegation of improper purpose does not entitle a taxpayer\nto examine IRS officials. Rather, the taxpayer has a right\nto conduct that examination when he points to specific\nfacts or circumstances plausibly raising an inference of\nbad faith.\n                             I\n  Congress has \u201cauthorized and required\u201d the IRS \u201cto\nmake the inquiries, determinations, and assessments of\nall taxes\u201d the Internal Revenue Code imposes. 26 U. S. C.\n2                  UNITED STATES v. CLARKE\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a76201(a). And in support of that authority, Congress has\ngranted the Service broad latitude to issue summonses\n\u201c[f]or the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any\nreturn, making a return where none has been made, de-\ntermining the liability of any person for any internal\nrevenue tax . . . , or collecting any such liability.\u201d\n\u00a77602(a). Such a summons directs a taxpayer (or associ-\nated person1) to appear before an IRS official and to pro-\nvide sworn testimony or produce \u201cbooks, papers, records,\nor other data . . . relevant or material to [a tax] inquiry.\u201d\n\u00a77602(a)(1).\n   If a taxpayer does not comply with a summons, the IRS\nmay bring an enforcement action in district court. See\n\u00a7\u00a77402(b), 7604(a). In that proceeding, we have held, the\nIRS \u201cneed only demonstrate good faith in issuing the\nsummons.\u201d United States v. Stuart, 489 U. S. 353, 359\n(1989). More specifically, that means establishing what\nhave become known as the Powell factors: \u201cthat the inves-\ntigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate pur-\npose, that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose, that\nthe information sought is not already within the [IRS\u2019s]\npossession, and that the administrative steps required by\nthe [Internal Revenue] Code have been followed.\u201d United\nStates v. Powell, 379 U. S. 48, 57\u201358 (1964). To make that\nshowing, the IRS usually files an affidavit from the re-\nsponsible investigating agent. See Stuart, 489 U. S., at\n360. The taxpayer, however, has an opportunity to chal-\nlenge that affidavit, and to urge the court to quash the\n\nsummons \u201con any appropriate ground\u201d\u2014including, as\n\nrelevant here, improper purpose. See Reisman v. Caplin, \n\n375 U. S. 440, 449 (1964). \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n  1 The IRS has authority to summon not only \u201cthe person liable for\n\ntax,\u201d but also \u201cany officer or employee of such person,\u201d any person\nhaving custody of relevant \u201cbooks of account,\u201d and \u201cany other person\nthe [IRS] may deem proper.\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a77602(a)(2). For convenience,\nthis opinion refers only to the \u201ctaxpayer.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The summons dispute in this case arose from an IRS\nexamination of the tax returns of Dynamo Holdings Lim-\nited Partnership (Dynamo) for the 2005\u20132007 tax years.\nThe IRS harbored suspicions about large interest expenses\nthat those returns had reported. As its investigation\nproceeded, the Service persuaded Dynamo to agree to two\nyear-long extensions of the usual 3-year limitations period\nfor assessing tax liability; in 2010, with that period again\ndrawing to a close, Dynamo refused to grant the IRS a\nthird extension. Shortly thereafter, in September and\nOctober 2010, the IRS issued summonses to the respond-\nents here, four individuals associated with Dynamo whom\nthe Service believed had information and records relevant\nto Dynamo\u2019s tax obligations. None of the respondents\ncomplied with those summonses. In December 2010 (still\nwithin the augmented limitations period), the IRS issued a\nFinal Partnership Administrative Adjustment proposing\nchanges to Dynamo\u2019s returns that would result in greater\ntax liability. Dynamo responded in February 2011 by\nfiling suit in the United States Tax Court to challenge the\nadjustments. That litigation remains pending. A few\nmonths later, in April 2011, the IRS instituted proceed-\nings in District Court to compel the respondents to comply\nwith the summonses they had gotten.\n   Those enforcement proceedings developed into a dispute\nabout the IRS\u2019s reasons for issuing the summonses. The\nIRS submitted an investigating agent\u2019s affidavit attesting\nto the Powell factors; among other things, that declaration\nmaintained that the testimony and records sought were\nnecessary to \u201cproperly investigate the correctness of [Dy-\nnamo\u2019s] federal tax reporting\u201d and that the summonses\nwere \u201cnot issued to harass or for any other improper pur-\npose.\u201d App. 26, 34. In reply, the respondents pointed to\ncircumstantial evidence that, in their view, suggested\n\u201culterior motive[s]\u201d of two different kinds. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 72a. First, the respondents asserted that the IRS\n4                UNITED STATES v. CLARKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nissued the summonses to \u201cpunish[ ] [Dynamo] for refusing\nto agree to a further extension of the applicable statute of\nlimitations.\u201d App. 52. More particularly, they stated in\nsworn declarations that immediately after Dynamo de-\nclined to grant a third extension of time, the IRS, \u201cdespite\nhaving not asked for additional information for some time,\n. . . suddenly issued\u201d the summonses. Id., at 95. Second,\nthe respondents averred that the IRS decided to enforce\nthe summonses, subsequent to Dynamo\u2019s filing suit in Tax\nCourt, to \u201cevad[e] the Tax Court[\u2019s] limitations on discov-\nery\u201d and thus gain an unfair advantage in that litigation.\nId., at 53. In support of that charge, the respondents\nsubmitted an affidavit from the attorney of another Dy-\nnamo associate, who had chosen to comply with a sum-\nmons issued at the same time. The attorney reported that\nonly the IRS attorneys handling the Tax Court case, and\nnot the original investigating agents, were present at the\ninterview of his client. In light of those submissions, the\nrespondents asked for an opportunity to question the\nagents about their motives.\n    The District Court denied that request and ordered the\nrespondents to comply with the summonses. According to\nthe court, the respondents \u201cha[d] made no meaningful\nallegations of improper purpose\u201d warranting examination\nof IRS agents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. The court char-\nacterized the respondents\u2019 statute-of-limitations theory as\n\u201cmere conjecture.\u201d Id., at 14a. And it ruled that the re-\nspondents\u2019 evasion-of-discovery-limits claim was \u201cincorrect\nas a matter of law\u201d because \u201c[t]he validity of a summons is\ntested as of the date of issuance,\u201d not enforcement\u2014and\nthe Tax Court proceedings had not yet begun when the\nIRS issued the summonses. Id., at 15a.\n    The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed,\nholding that the District Court\u2019s refusal to allow the re-\nspondents to examine IRS agents constituted an abuse of\ndiscretion. In support of that ruling, the Court of Appeals\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

Appx. 689, 691 (2013) (quoting United States v.\nSoutheast First Nat. Bank of Miami Springs, 655 F. 2d\n661, 667 (CA5 1981)); see Nero Trading, LLC v. United\nStates Dept. of Treasury, 570 F. 3d 1244, 1249 (CA11 2009)\n(reaffirming Southeast).\n   Every other Court of Appeals has rejected the Eleventh\nCircuit\u2019s view that a bare allegation of improper motive\nentitles a person objecting to an IRS summons to examine\nthe responsible officials.2 We granted certiorari to resolve\nthat conflict, 571 U. S. __ (2014), and we now vacate the\nEleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion.\n                              II\n  A person receiving an IRS summons is, as we have often\nheld, entitled to contest it in an enforcement proceeding.\nSee United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U. S. 141, 146 (1975);\nPowell, 379 U. S., at 57\u201358; Reisman, 375 U. S., at 449.\nThe power \u201cvested in tax collectors may be abused, as all\npower\u201d may be abused. Bisceglia, 420 U. S., at 146. In\nrecognition of that possibility, Congress made enforcement\nof an IRS summons contingent on a court\u2019s approval. See\n26 U. S. C. \u00a77604(b). And we have time and again stated\nthat the requisite judicial proceeding is not ex parte but\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See, e.g., Sugarloaf Funding, LLC v. United States Dept. of Treas-\n\nury, 584 F. 3d 340, 350\u2013351 (CA1 2009) (requiring \u201ca sufficient thresh-\nold showing that there was an improper purpose\u201d); Fortney v.

Bank, 607 F. 2d 61, 71 (CA3 1979) (requir-\ning \u201cfactual[ ] support[ ] by the taxpayer\u2019s affidavits\u201d).\n6               UNITED STATES v. CLARKE\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nadversarial. See Donaldson v. United States, 400 U. S.\n517, 527 (1971); Powell, 379 U. S., at 58; Reisman, 375\nU. S., at 446. The summoned party must receive notice,\nand may present argument and evidence on all matters\nbearing on a summons\u2019s validity. See Powell, 379 U. S.,\nat 58.\n   Yet we have also emphasized that summons enforce-\nment proceedings are to be \u201csummary in nature.\u201d Stuart,\n489 U. S., at 369. The purpose of a summons is \u201cnot to\naccuse,\u201d much less to adjudicate, but only \u201cto inquire.\u201d\nBisceglia, 420 U. S., at 146. And such an investigatory\ntool, we have recognized, is a crucial backstop in a tax\nsystem based on self-reporting. See ibid. (restricting\nsummons authority would enable \u201cdishonest persons [to]\nescap[e] taxation[,] thus shifting heavier burdens to hon-\nest taxpayers\u201d). Accordingly, we long ago held that courts\nmay ask only whether the IRS issued a summons in good\nfaith, and must eschew any broader role of \u201coversee[ing]\nthe [IRS\u2019s] determinations to investigate.\u201d Powell, 379\nU. S., at 56. So too, we stated that absent contrary evi-\ndence, the IRS can satisfy that standard by submitting a\nsimple affidavit from the investigating agent. See Stuart,\n489 U. S., at 359\u2013360. Thus, we have rejected rules that\nwould \u201cthwart and defeat the [Service\u2019s] appropriate\ninvestigatory powers.\u201d Donaldson, 400 U. S., at 533.\n   The balance we have struck in prior cases comports with\nthe following rule, applicable here: As part of the adver-\nsarial process concerning a summons\u2019s validity, the tax-\npayer is entitled to examine an IRS agent when he can\npoint to specific facts or circumstances plausibly raising\nan inference of bad faith. Naked allegations of improper\npurpose are not enough: The taxpayer must offer some\ncredible evidence supporting his charge. But circumstan-\ntial evidence can suffice to meet that burden; after all,\ndirect evidence of another person\u2019s bad faith, at this\nthreshold stage, will rarely if ever be available. And\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nalthough bare assertion or conjecture is not enough, nei-\nther is a fleshed out case demanded: The taxpayer need\nonly make a showing of facts that give rise to a plausible\ninference of improper motive. That standard will ensure\ninquiry where the facts and circumstances make inquiry\nappropriate, without turning every summons dispute into\na fishing expedition for official wrongdoing. And the rule\nis little different from the one that both the respondents\nand the Government have recommended to us.3\n   But that is not the standard the Eleventh Circuit ap-\nplied. Although the respondents gamely try to put an-\nother face on the opinion below, see Brief for Respondents\n24\u201325, and n. 17, we have no doubt that the Court of Appeals\nviewed even bare allegations of improper purpose as enti-\ntling a summons objector to question IRS agents. The\ncourt in fact had some evidence before it pertaining to the\nrespondents\u2019 charges: The respondents, for example, had\nsubmitted one declaration relating the timing of the sum-\nmonses to Dynamo\u2019s refusal to extend the limitations\nperiod, see App. 95, and another aiming to show that the\nIRS was using the summonses to obtain discovery it could\nnot get in Tax Court, see id., at 97\u2013100. But the Eleventh\nCircuit never assessed whether those (or any other) mate-\nrials plausibly supported an inference of improper motive;\nindeed, the court never mentioned the proffered evidence\nat all. Instead, and in line with Circuit precedent, the\ncourt applied a categorical rule, demanding the examina-\ntion of IRS agents even when a taxpayer made only con-\nclusory allegations. See supra, at 4. That was error. On\nremand, the Court of Appeals must consider the respond-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29 (respondents) (The taxpayer is entitled to\n\nquestion the agent \u201cwhen he presents specific facts from which an\nimproper purpose . . . may plausibly be inferred\u201d); id., at 5 (United\nStates) (\u201c[A] summons opponent has to put in enough evidence to at\nleast raise an inference\u201d of improper motive, and \u201c[c]ircumstantial\nevidence is enough\u201d).\n8                UNITED STATES v. CLARKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nents\u2019 submissions in light of the standard we have stated.\n   That consideration must as well give appropriate defer-\nence to the District Court\u2019s ruling. An appellate court, as\nthe Eleventh Circuit noted, reviews for abuse of discretion\na trial court\u2019s decision to order\u2014or not\u2014the questioning of\nIRS agents. See 517 Fed. Appx., at 691, n. 2; Tiffany Fine\nArts, Inc. v. United States, 469 U. S. 310, 324, n. 7 (1985).\nThat standard of review reflects the district court\u2019s supe-\nrior familiarity with, and understanding of, the dispute; and\nit comports with the way appellate courts review related\nmatters of case management, discovery, and trial prac-\ntice. See, e.g., Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493\nU. S. 165, 172\u2013173 (1989); Crawford-El v. Britton, 523\nU. S. 574, 599\u2013601 (1998). Accordingly, the Court of\nAppeals must take into account on remand the District\nCourt\u2019s broad discretion to determine whether a tax-\npayer has shown enough to require the examination of IRS\ninvestigators.\n   But two caveats to that instruction are in order here.\nFirst, the District Court\u2019s decision is entitled to deference\nonly if based on the correct legal standard. See Fox v.\nVice, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11) (\u201cA trial\ncourt has wide discretion when, but only when, it calls the\ngame by the right rules\u201d). We leave to the Court of Ap-\npeals the task of deciding whether the District Court\nasked and answered the relevant question\u2014once again,\nwhether the respondents pointed to specific facts or cir-\ncumstances plausibly raising an inference of improper\nmotive.\n   And second, the District Court\u2019s latitude does not extend\nto legal issues about what counts as an illicit motive. As\nindicated earlier, one such issue is embedded in the re-\nspondents\u2019 claim that the Government moved to enforce\nthese summonses to gain an unfair advantage in Tax\nCourt litigation. See supra, at 4. The Government re-\nsponds, and the District Court agreed, that any such\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npurpose is irrelevant because \u201cthe validity of a summons is\njudged at the time\u201d the IRS originally issued the sum-\nmons, and here that preceded the Tax Court suit. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 7; see Reply Brief 19\u201320; App. to Pet. for Cert.\n15a. Similarly, with respect to the respondents\u2019 alterna-\ntive theory, the Government briefly suggested at argu-\nment that issuing a summons because \u201ca taxpayer de-\nclined to extend a statute of limitations would [not] be an\nimproper purpose,\u201d even assuming that happened here.\nTr. of Oral Arg. 6. We state no view on those issues; they\nare not within the question presented for our review. We\nnote only that they are pure questions of law, so if they\narise again on remand, the Court of Appeals has no cause\nto defer to the District Court. Cf. Koon v. United States,\n518 U. S. 81, 100 (1996) (\u201cA district court by definition\nabuses its discretion when it makes an error of law\u201d).\n   For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
