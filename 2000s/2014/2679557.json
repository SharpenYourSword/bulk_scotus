FRANKS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n        No. 13\u2013483.      Argued April 28, 2014\u2014Decided June 19, 2014\nAs Director of Community Intensive Training for Youth (CITY), a pro-\n  gram for underprivileged youth operated by Central Alabama Com-\n  munity College (CACC), petitioner Edward Lane conducted an audit\n  of the program\u2019s expenses and discovered that Suzanne Schmitz, an\n  Alabama State Representative on CITY\u2019s payroll, had not been re-\n  porting for work. Lane eventually terminated Schmitz\u2019 employment.\n  Shortly thereafter, federal authorities indicted Schmitz on charges of\n  mail fraud and theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.\n  Lane testified, under subpoena, regarding the events that led to his\n  terminating Schmitz. Schmitz was convicted and sentenced to 30\n  months in prison. Meanwhile, CITY was experiencing significant\n  budget shortfalls. Respondent Franks, then CACC\u2019s president, ter-\n  minated Lane along with 28 other employees in a claimed effort to\n  address the financial difficulties. A few days later, however, Franks\n  rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations\u2014those of Lane and one\n  other employee. Lane sued Franks in his individual and official ca-\n  pacities under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, alleging that Franks had violated\n  the First Amendment by firing him in retaliation for testifying\n  against Schmitz.\n    The District Court granted Franks\u2019 motion for summary judgment,\n  holding that the individual-capacity claims were barred by qualified\n  immunity and the official-capacity claims were barred by the Elev-\n  enth Amendment. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that\n  Lane\u2019s testimony was not entitled to First Amendment protection. It\n  reasoned that Lane spoke as an employee and not as a citizen be-\n  cause he acted pursuant to his official duties when he investigated\n  and terminated Schmitz\u2019 employment.\nHeld:\n2                            LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       1. Lane\u2019s sworn testimony outside the scope of his ordinary job du-\n    ties is entitled to First Amendment protection. Pp. 6\u201313.\n          (a) Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205,\n    Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568, requires balancing \u201cthe interests of the\n    [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public con-\n    cern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the\n    efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d\n    Under the first step of the Pickering analysis, if the speech is made\n    pursuant to the employee\u2019s ordinary job duties, then the employee is\n    not speaking as a citizen for First Amendment purposes, and the in-\n    quiry ends. Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 421. But if the \u201cem-\n    ployee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern,\u201d the inquiry\n    turns to \u201cwhether the relevant government entity had an adequate\n    justification for treating the employee differently from any other\n    member of the general public.\u201d Id., at 418. Pp. 6\u20138.\n          (b) Lane\u2019s testimony is speech as a citizen on a matter of public\n    concern. Pp. 8\u201312.\n             (1) Sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is a quintessential\n    example of citizen speech for the simple reason that anyone who tes-\n    tifies in court bears an obligation, to the court and society at large, to\n    tell the truth. That obligation is distinct and independent from any\n    separate obligations a testifying public employee might have to his\n    employer. The Eleventh Circuit read Garcetti far too broadly in hold-\n    ing that Lane did not speak as a citizen when he testified simply be-\n    cause he learned of the subject matter of that testimony in the course\n    of his employment. Garcetti said nothing about speech that relates to\n    public employment or concerns information learned in the course of\n    that employment. The critical question under Garcetti is whether the\n    speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee\u2019s\n    duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties. Indeed, speech\n    by public employees on subject matter related to their employment\n    holds special value precisely because those employees gain knowledge\n    of matters of public concern through their employment. Pp. 9\u201311.\n             (2) Whether speech is a matter of public concern turns on the\n    \u201ccontent, form, and context\u201d of the speech. Connick v. Myers, 461\n    U. S. 138, 147\u2013148. Here, corruption in a public program and misuse\n    of state funds obviously involve matters of significant public concern.\n    See Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 425. And the form and context of the\n    speech\u2014sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding\u2014fortify that con-\n    clusion. See United States v. Alvarez, 567 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 11\u201312.\n          (c) Turning to Pickering\u2019s second step, the employer\u2019s side of the\n    scale is entirely empty. Respondents do not assert, and cannot\n    demonstrate, any government interest that tips the balance in their\n    favor\u2014for instance, evidence that Lane\u2019s testimony was false or erro-\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  neous or that Lane unnecessarily disclosed sensitive, confidential, or\n  privileged information while testifying. Pp. 12\u201313.\n     2. Franks is entitled to qualified immunity for the claims against\n  him in his individual capacity. The question here is whether Franks\n  reasonably could have believed that, when he fired Lane, a govern-\n  ment employer could fire an employee because of testimony the em-\n  ployee gave, under oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job re-\n  sponsibilities. See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___. At the\n  relevant time, Eleventh Circuit precedent did not preclude Franks\n  from holding that belief, and no decision of this Court was sufficiently\n  clear to cast doubt on controlling Circuit precedent. Any discrepan-\n  cies in Eleventh Circuit precedent only serve to highlight the disposi-\n  tive point that the question was not beyond debate at the time\n  Franks acted. Pp. 13\u201317.\n     3. The Eleventh Circuit declined to consider the District Court\u2019s\n  dismissal of the claims against respondent Burrow in her official ca-\n  pacity as CACC\u2019s acting president, and the parties have not asked\n  this Court to consider them here. The judgment of the Eleventh Cir-\n  cuit as to those claims is reversed, and the case is remanded for fur-\n  ther proceedings. P. 17.\n523 Fed.

Rather, the First Amendment protec-\ntion of a public employee\u2019s speech depends on a careful\nbalance \u201cbetween the interests of the [employee], as a\ncitizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and\nthe interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the\nefficiency of the public services it performs through its\nemployees.\u201d Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High\nSchool Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968). In\nPickering, the Court struck the balance in favor of the\npublic employee, extending First Amendment protection to\na teacher who was fired after writing a letter to the editor\nof a local newspaper criticizing the school board that\nemployed him. Today, we consider whether the First\nAmendment similarly protects a public employee who\n2                      LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprovided truthful sworn testimony, compelled by sub-\npoena, outside the course of his ordinary job responsibilities.\nWe hold that it does.\n                               I\n   In 2006, Central Alabama Community College (CACC)\nhired petitioner Edward Lane to be the Director of Com-\nmunity Intensive Training for Youth (CITY), a statewide\nprogram for underprivileged youth. CACC hired Lane on\na probationary basis. In his capacity as Director, Lane\nwas responsible for overseeing CITY\u2019s day-to-day opera-\ntions, hiring and firing employees, and making decisions\nwith respect to the program\u2019s finances.\n   At the time of Lane\u2019s appointment, CITY faced signifi-\ncant financial difficulties. That prompted Lane to conduct\na comprehensive audit of the program\u2019s expenses. The\naudit revealed that Suzanne Schmitz, an Alabama State\nRepresentative on CITY\u2019s payroll, had not been reporting\nto her CITY office. After unfruitful discussions with\nSchmitz, Lane shared his finding with CACC\u2019s president\nand its attorney. They warned him that firing Schmitz\ncould have negative repercussions for him and CACC.\n   Lane nonetheless contacted Schmitz again and in-\nstructed her to show up to the Huntsville office to serve\nas a counselor. Schmitz refused; she responded that she\nwished to \u201c \u2018continue to serve the CITY program in the\nsame manner as [she had] in the past.\u2019 \u201d Lane v. Central\nAla. Community College, 523 Fed. Appx. 709, 710 (CA11\n2013) (per curiam). Lane fired her shortly thereafter.\nSchmitz told another CITY employee, Charles Foley, that\nshe intended to \u201c \u2018get [Lane] back\u2019 \u201d for firing her. 2012 WL\n5289412, *1 (ND Ala., Oct. 18, 2012). She also said that if\nLane ever requested money from the state legislature for\nthe program, she would tell him, \u201c \u2018[y]ou\u2019re fired.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n   Schmitz\u2019 termination drew the attention of many, in-\ncluding agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich initiated an investigation into Schmitz\u2019 employment\nwith CITY. In November 2006, Lane testified before a\nfederal grand jury about his reasons for firing Schmitz. In\nJanuary 2008, the grand jury indicted Schmitz on four\ncounts of mail fraud and four counts of theft concerning a\nprogram receiving federal funds. See United States v.\nSchmitz, 634 F. 3d 1247, 1256\u20131257 (CA11 2011). The\nindictment alleged that Schmitz had collected $177,251.82\nin federal funds even though she performed \u201c \u2018virtually no\nservices,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018generated virtually no work product,\u2019 \u201d and\n\u201c \u2018rarely even appeared for work at the CITY Program\noffices.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1260. It further alleged that Schmitz had\nsubmitted false statements concerning the hours she\nworked and the nature of the services she performed. Id.,\nat 1257.\n    Schmitz\u2019 trial, which garnered extensive press cover-\nage,1 commenced in August 2008. Lane testified, under\nsubpoena, regarding the events that led to his terminating\nSchmitz. The jury failed to reach a verdict. Roughly six\nmonths later, federal prosecutors retried Schmitz, and\nLane testified once again. This time, the jury convicted\nSchmitz on three counts of mail fraud and four counts\nof theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.\nThe District Court sentenced her to 30 months in prison\nand ordered her to pay $177,251.82 in restitution and\nforfeiture.\n    Meanwhile, CITY continued to experience considerable\nbudget shortfalls. In November 2008, Lane began report-\ning to respondent Steve Franks, who had become presi-\ndent of CACC in January 2008. Lane recommended that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See, e.g., Lawmaker Faces Fraud Charge in June, Montgomery Ad-\n\nvertiser, May 6, 2008, p. 1B; Johnson, State Lawmaker\u2019s Fraud Trial\nStarts Today, Montgomery Advertiser, Aug. 18, 2008, p. 1B; Faulk,\nSchmitz Testifies in Her Defense: Says State Job was Legitimate,\nBirmingham News, Feb. 20, 2009, p. 1A; Faulk, Schmitz Convicted,\nLoses her State Seat, Birmingham News, Feb. 25, 2009, p. 1A.\n4                         LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nFranks consider layoffs to address the financial difficul-\nties. In January 2009, Franks decided to terminate 29\nprobationary CITY employees, including Lane. Shortly\nthereafter, however, Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29\nterminations\u2014those of Lane and one other employee\u2014\nbecause of an \u201cambiguity in [those other employees\u2019] pro-\nbationary service.\u201d Brief for Respondent Franks 11.\nFranks claims that he \u201cdid not rescind Lane\u2019s termina-\ntion . . . because he believed that Lane was in a fundamen-\ntally different category than the other employees: he was\nthe director of the entire CITY program, and not simply an\nemployee.\u201d Ibid. In September 2009, CACC eliminated\nthe CITY program and terminated the program\u2019s remain-\ning employees. Franks later retired, and respondent\nSusan Burrow, the current Acting President of CACC,\nreplaced him while this case was pending before the Elev-\nenth Circuit.\n   In January 2011, Lane sued Franks in his individual\nand official capacities under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71983, alleging that Franks had violated the First\nAmendment by firing him in retaliation for his testimony\nagainst Schmitz.2 Lane sought damages from Franks in\nhis individual capacity and sought equitable relief, includ-\ning reinstatement, from Franks in his official capacity.3\n   The District Court granted Franks\u2019 motion for summary\njudgment. Although the court concluded that the record\nraised \u201cgenuine issues of material fact . . . concerning\n[Franks\u2019] true motivation for terminating [Lane\u2019s] em-\nployment,\u201d 2012 WL 5289412, *6, it held that Franks was\nentitled to qualified immunity as to the damages claims\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Lane also brought claims against CACC, as well as claims under a\n\nstate whistleblower statute, Ala. Code \u00a736\u201326A\u20133 (2013), and 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71985. Those claims are not at issue here.\n  3 Because Burrow replaced Franks as President of CACC during the\n\npendency of this lawsuit, the claims originally filed against Franks in\nhis official capacity are now against Burrow.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause \u201ca reasonable government official in [Franks\u2019]\nposition would not have had reason to believe that the\nConstitution protected [Lane\u2019s] testimony,\u201d id., *12. The\nDistrict Court relied on Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410\n(2006), which held that \u201c \u2018when public employees make\nstatements pursuant to their official duties, the employees\nare not speaking as citizens for First Amendment pur-\nposes.\u2019 \u201d 2012 WL 5289412, *10 (quoting Garcetti, 547 U. S.,\nat 421). The court found no violation of clearly established\nlaw because Lane had \u201clearned of the information that he\ntestified about while working as Director at [CITY],\u201d such\nthat his \u201cspeech [could] still be considered as part of his\nofficial job duties and not made as a citizen on a matter of\npublic concern.\u201d 2012 WL 5289412, *10.\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 523 Fed. Appx., at 710.\nLike the District Court, it relied extensively on Garcetti.\nIt reasoned that, \u201c[e]ven if an employee was not required\nto make the speech as part of his official duties, he enjoys\nno First Amendment protection if his speech \u2018owes its\nexistence to [the] employee\u2019s professional responsibilities\u2019\nand is \u2018a product that the \u201cemployer himself has commis-\nsioned or created.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., at 711 (quoting Abdur-Rahman\nv. Walker, 567 F. 3d 1278, 1283 (CA11 2009)). The court\nconcluded that Lane spoke as an employee and not as a\ncitizen because he was acting pursuant to his official\nduties when he investigated Schmitz\u2019 employment, spoke\nwith Schmitz and CACC officials regarding the issue, and\nterminated Schmitz. 523 Fed. Appx., at 712. \u201cThat Lane\ntestified about his official activities pursuant to a sub-\npoena and in the litigation context,\u201d the court continued,\n\u201cdoes not bring Lane\u2019s speech within the protection of the\nFirst Amendment.\u201d Ibid. The Eleventh Circuit also con-\ncluded that, \u201ceven if . . . a constitutional violation of Lane\u2019s\nFirst Amendment rights occurred in these circumstances,\nFranks would be entitled to qualified immunity in his\npersonal capacity\u201d because the right at issue had not been\n6                     LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclearly established. Id., at 711, n. 2.\n  We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. __ (2014), to resolve\ndiscord among the Courts of Appeals as to whether public\nemployees may be fired\u2014or suffer other adverse employ-\nment consequences\u2014for providing truthful subpoenaed\ntestimony outside the course of their ordinary job respon-\nsibilities. Compare 523 Fed. Appx., at 712 (case below),\nwith, e.g., Reilly v. Atlantic City, 532 F. 3d 216, 231 (CA3\n2008).\n                              II\n  Speech by citizens on matters of public concern lies at\nthe heart of the First Amendment, which \u201cwas fashioned\nto assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing\nabout of political and social changes desired by the peo-\nple,\u201d Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957). This\nremains true when speech concerns information related to\nor learned through public employment. After all, public\nemployees do not renounce their citizenship when they\naccept employment, and this Court has cautioned time\nand again that public employers may not condition em-\nployment on the relinquishment of constitutional rights.\nSee, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of\nN. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605 (1967); Pickering, 391 U. S., at\n568; Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 142 (1983). There is\nconsiderable value, moreover, in encouraging, rather than\ninhibiting, speech by public employees. For \u201c[g]overnment\nemployees are often in the best position to know what ails\nthe agencies for which they work.\u201d Waters v. Churchill,\n511 U. S. 661, 674 (1994) (plurality opinion). \u201cThe interest\nat stake is as much the public\u2019s interest in receiving in-\nformed opinion as it is the employee\u2019s own right to dissem-\ninate it.\u201d San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 82 (2004) (per\ncuriam).\n  Our precedents have also acknowledged the govern-\nment\u2019s countervailing interest in controlling the operation\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof its workplaces. See, e.g., Pickering, 391 U. S., at 568.\n\u201cGovernment employers, like private employers, need a\nsignificant degree of control over their employees\u2019 words\nand actions; without it, there would be little chance for the\nefficient provision of public services.\u201d Garcetti, 547 U. S.,\nat 418.\n   Pickering provides the framework for analyzing whether\nthe employee\u2019s interest or the government\u2019s interest\nshould prevail in cases where the government seeks to\ncurtail the speech of its employees. It requires \u201cbal-\nanc[ing] . . . the interests of the [public employee], as a\ncitizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and\nthe interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the\nefficiency of the public services it performs through its\nemployees.\u201d 391 U. S., at 568. In Pickering, the Court\nheld that a teacher\u2019s letter to the editor of a local news-\npaper concerning a school budget constituted speech on a\nmatter of public concern. Id., at 571. And in balancing\nthe employee\u2019s interest in such speech against the gov-\nernment\u2019s efficiency interest, the Court held that the\npublication of the letter did not \u201cimped[e] the teacher\u2019s\nproper performance of his daily duties in the classroom\u201d or\n\u201cinterfer[e] with the regular operation of the schools gen-\nerally.\u201d Id., at 572\u2013573. The Court therefore held that the\nteacher\u2019s speech could not serve as the basis for his dis-\nmissal. Id., at 574.\n   In Garcetti, we described a two-step inquiry into whether\na public employee\u2019s speech is entitled to protection:\n    \u201cThe first requires determining whether the employee\n    spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern. If the\n    answer is no, the employee has no First Amendment\n    cause of action based on his or her employer\u2019s reaction\n    to the speech. If the answer is yes, then the possibil-\n    ity of a First Amendment claim arises. The question\n    becomes whether the relevant government entity had\n8                          LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     an adequate justification for treating the employee\n     differently from any other member of the general pub-\n     lic.\u201d 547 U. S., at 418 (citations omitted).\n   In describing the first step in this inquiry, Garcetti\ndistinguished between employee speech and citizen\nspeech. Whereas speech as a citizen may trigger protec-\ntion, the Court held that \u201cwhen public employees make\nstatements pursuant to their official duties, the employees\nare not speaking as citizens for First Amendment pur-\nposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communi-\ncations from employer discipline.\u201d Id., at 421. Applying\nthat rule to the facts before it, the Court found that an\ninternal memorandum prepared by a prosecutor in the\ncourse of his ordinary job responsibilities constituted\nunprotected employee speech. Id., at 424.\n                              III\n  Against this backdrop, we turn to the question pre-\nsented: whether the First Amendment protects a public\nemployee who provides truthful sworn testimony, compelled\nby subpoena, outside the scope of his ordinary job respon-\nsibilities.4 We hold that it does.\n                             A\n  The first inquiry is whether the speech in question\u2014\nLane\u2019s testimony at Schmitz\u2019 trials\u2014is speech as a citizen\non a matter of public concern. It clearly is.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 It is undisputed that Lane\u2019s ordinary job responsibilities did not\n\ninclude testifying in court proceedings. See Lane v. Central Ala.\nCommunity College, 523 Fed. Appx. 709, 712 (CA11 2013). For that\nreason, Lane asked the Court to decide only whether truthful sworn\ntestimony that is not a part of an employee\u2019s ordinary job responsibili-\nties is citizen speech on a matter of public concern. Pet. for Cert. i. We\naccordingly need not address in this case whether truthful sworn\ntestimony would constitute citizen speech under Garcetti when given as\npart of a public employee\u2019s ordinary job duties, and express no opinion\non the matter today.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               1\n   Truthful testimony under oath by a public employee\noutside the scope of his ordinary job duties is speech as a\ncitizen for First Amendment purposes. That is so even\nwhen the testimony relates to his public employment or\nconcerns information learned during that employment.\n   In rejecting Lane\u2019s argument that his testimony was\nspeech as a citizen, the Eleventh Circuit gave short shrift\nto the nature of sworn judicial statements and ignored the\nobligation borne by all witnesses testifying under oath.\nSee 523 Fed. Appx., at 712 (finding immaterial the fact\nthat Lane spoke \u201cpursuant to a subpoena and in the litiga-\ntion context\u201d). Sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is\na quintessential example of speech as a citizen for a sim-\nple reason: Anyone who testifies in court bears an obliga-\ntion, to the court and society at large, to tell the truth.\nSee, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a71623 (criminalizing false statements\nunder oath in judicial proceedings); United States v. Man-\ndujano, 425 U. S. 564, 576 (1976) (plurality opinion) (\u201cPer-\njured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the\nbasic concept of judicial proceedings\u201d). When the person\ntestifying is a public employee, he may bear separate\nobligations to his employer\u2014for example, an obligation not\nto show up to court dressed in an unprofessional manner.\nBut any such obligations as an employee are distinct and\nindependent from the obligation, as a citizen, to speak the\ntruth. That independent obligation renders sworn testi-\nmony speech as a citizen and sets it apart from speech\nmade purely in the capacity of an employee.\n   In holding that Lane did not speak as a citizen when\nhe testified, the Eleventh Circuit read Garcetti far too\nbroadly. It reasoned that, because Lane learned of the sub-\nject matter of his testimony in the course of his employ-\nment with CITY, Garcetti requires that his testimony be\ntreated as the speech of an employee rather than that of a\ncitizen. See 523 Fed. Appx., at 712. It does not.\n10                    LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The sworn testimony in this case is far removed from\nthe speech at issue in Garcetti\u2014an internal memorandum\nprepared by a deputy district attorney for his supervisors\nrecommending dismissal of a particular prosecution. The\nGarcetti Court held that such speech was made pursuant\nto the employee\u2019s \u201cofficial responsibilities\u201d because \u201c[w]hen\n[the employee] went to work and performed the tasks he\nwas paid to perform, [he] acted as a government employee.\nThe fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak\nor write does not mean that his supervisors were prohib-\nited from evaluating his performance.\u201d 547 U. S., at 422,\n424.\n   But Garcetti said nothing about speech that simply\nrelates to public employment or concerns information\nlearned in the course of public employment. The Garcetti\nCourt made explicit that its holding did not turn on the\nfact that the memo at issue \u201cconcerned the subject matter\nof [the prosecutor\u2019s] employment,\u201d because \u201c[t]he First\nAmendment protects some expressions related to the\nspeaker\u2019s job.\u201d Id., at 421. In other words, the mere fact\nthat a citizen\u2019s speech concerns information acquired by\nvirtue of his public employment does not transform that\nspeech into employee\u2014rather than citizen\u2014speech. The\ncritical question under Garcetti is whether the speech at\nissue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee\u2019s\nduties, not whether it merely concerns those duties.\n   It bears emphasis that our precedents dating back to\nPickering have recognized that speech by public employees\non subject matter related to their employment holds\nspecial value precisely because those employees gain\nknowledge of matters of public concern through their\nemployment. In Pickering, for example, the Court ob-\nserved that \u201c[t]eachers are . . . the members of a commu-\nnity most likely to have informed and definite opinions as\nto how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should\nbe spent. Accordingly, it is essential that they be able to\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspeak out freely on such questions without fear of retalia-\ntory dismissal.\u201d 391 U. S., at 572; see also Garcetti, 547\nU. S., at 421 (recognizing that \u201c[t]he same is true of many\nother categories of public employees\u201d). Most recently, in\nSan Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S., at 80, the Court again ob-\nserved that public employees \u201care uniquely qualified to\ncomment\u201d on \u201cmatters concerning government policies\nthat are of interest to the public at large.\u201d\n  The importance of public employee speech is especially\nevident in the context of this case: a public corruption\nscandal. The United States, for example, represents that\nbecause \u201c[t]he more than 1000 prosecutions for federal\ncorruption offenses that are brought in a typical year . . .\noften depend on evidence about activities that government\nofficials undertook while in office,\u201d those prosecutions\noften \u201crequire testimony from other government employ-\nees.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20. It\nwould be antithetical to our jurisprudence to conclude that\nthe very kind of speech necessary to prosecute corruption\nby public officials\u2014speech by public employees regarding\ninformation learned through their employment\u2014may\nnever form the basis for a First Amendment retaliation\nclaim. Such a rule would place public employees who\nwitness corruption in an impossible position, torn between\nthe obligation to testify truthfully and the desire to avoid\nretaliation and keep their jobs.\n  Applying these principles, it is clear that Lane\u2019s sworn\ntestimony is speech as a citizen.\n                               2\n   Lane\u2019s testimony is also speech on a matter of public\nconcern. Speech involves matters of public concern \u201cwhen\nit can \u2018be fairly considered as relating to any matter of\npolitical, social, or other concern to the community,\u2019 or\nwhen it \u2018is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a\nsubject of general interest and of value and concern to the\n12                     LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npublic.\u2019 \u201d Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 6\u20137) (citation omitted). The inquiry turns on the\n\u201ccontent, form, and context\u201d of the speech. Connick, 461\nU. S., at 147\u2013148.\n  The content of Lane\u2019s testimony\u2014corruption in a public\nprogram and misuse of state funds\u2014obviously involves a\nmatter of significant public concern. See, e.g., Garcetti,\n547 U. S., at 425 (\u201cExposing governmental inefficiency and\nmisconduct is a matter of considerable significance\u201d). And\nthe form and context of the speech\u2014sworn testimony in a\njudicial proceeding\u2014fortify that conclusion.            \u201cUnlike\nspeech in other contexts, testimony under oath has the\nformality and gravity necessary to remind the witness\nthat his or her statements will be the basis for official\ngovernmental action, action that often affects the rights\nand liberties of others.\u201d United States v. Alvarez, 567\nU. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8\u20139) (plurality opinion).\n                        *     *    *\n   We hold, then, that Lane\u2019s truthful sworn testimony at\nSchmitz\u2019 criminal trials is speech as a citizen on a matter\nof public concern.\n                              B\n  This does not settle the matter, however. A public\nemployee\u2019s sworn testimony is not categorically entitled to\nFirst Amendment protection simply because it is speech as\na citizen on a matter of public concern. Under Pickering, if\nan employee speaks as a citizen on a matter of public\nconcern, the next question is whether the government had\n\u201can adequate justification for treating the employee differ-\nently from any other member of the public\u201d based on the\ngovernment\u2019s needs as an employer. Garcetti, 547 U. S., at\n418.\n  As discussed previously, we have recognized that gov-\nernment employers often have legitimate \u201cinterest[s] in\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

S., at 150\u2013151. We have also cautioned, however,\nthat \u201ca stronger showing [of government interests] may be\nnecessary if the employee\u2019s speech more substantially\ninvolve[s] matters of public concern.\u201d Id., at 152.\n   Here, the employer\u2019s side of the Pickering scale is entirely\nempty: Respondents do not assert, and cannot demon-\nstrate, any government interest that tips the balance in\ntheir favor. There is no evidence, for example, that Lane\u2019s\ntestimony at Schmitz\u2019 trials was false or erroneous or that\nLane unnecessarily disclosed any sensitive, confidential,\nor privileged information while testifying.5 In these cir-\ncumstances, we conclude that Lane\u2019s speech is entitled to\nprotection under the First Amendment. The Eleventh\nCircuit erred in holding otherwise and dismissing Lane\u2019s\nclaim of retaliation on that basis.\n                               IV\n  Respondent Franks argues that even if Lane\u2019s testimony\nis protected under the First Amendment, the claims\nagainst him in his individual capacity should be dismissed\non the basis of qualified immunity. We agree.\n  Qualified immunity \u201cgives government officials breath-\ning room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments\nabout open legal questions.\u201d Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.

Under this doctrine, courts\nmay not award damages against a government official in\nhis personal capacity unless \u201cthe official violated a statu-\ntory or constitutional right,\u201d and \u201cthe right was \u2018clearly\nestablished\u2019 at the time of the challenged conduct.\u201d Id., at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Of course, quite apart from Pickering balancing, wrongdoing that an\n\nemployee admits to while testifying may be a valid basis for termina-\ntion or other discipline.\n14                    LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n___ (slip op., at 3).\n   The relevant question for qualified immunity purposes\nis this: Could Franks reasonably have believed, at the\ntime he fired Lane, that a government employer could fire\nan employee on account of testimony the employee gave,\nunder oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job re-\nsponsibilities? Eleventh Circuit precedent did not pre-\nclude Franks from reasonably holding that belief. And no\ndecision of this Court was sufficiently clear to cast doubt\non the controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent.\n   In dismissing Lane\u2019s claim, the Eleventh Circuit relied\non its 1998 decision in Morris v. Crow, 142 F. 3d 1379 (per\ncuriam). There, a deputy sheriff sued the sheriff and two\nother officials, alleging that he had been fired in retalia-\ntion for statements he made in an accident report and\nlater giving deposition testimony about his investigation of\na fatal car crash between another officer and a citizen.\nId., at 1381. In his accident report, the plaintiff noted that\nthe officer was driving more than 130 mph in a 50 mph\nzone, without using his emergency blue warning light.\nSee ibid. The plaintiff later testified to these facts at a\ndeposition in a wrongful death suit against the sheriff \u2019s\noffice. Ibid. His superiors later fired him. Ibid.\n   The Eleventh Circuit, in a pre-Garcetti decision, con-\ncluded that the plaintiff \u2019s deposition testimony was un-\nprotected. It held that a public employee\u2019s speech is pro-\ntected only when it is \u201c \u2018made primarily in the employee\u2019s\nrole as citizen,\u2019 \u201d rather than \u201c \u2018primarily in the role of\nemployee.\u2019 \u201d Morris, 142 F. 3d, at 1382. And it found the\nplaintiff \u2019s deposition testimony to be speech as an em-\nployee because it \u201creiterated the conclusions regarding\nhis observations of the accident\u201d that he \u201cgenerated in the\nnormal course of [his] duties.\u201d Ibid. Critically, the court\nacknowledged\u2014and was unmoved by\u2014the fact that al-\nthough the plaintiff had investigated the accident and\nprepared the report pursuant to his official duties, there\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwas no \u201cevidence that [he] gave deposition testimony for\nany reason other than in compliance with a subpoena to\ntestify truthfully in the civil suit regarding the . . . acci-\ndent.\u201d Ibid. The court further reasoned that the speech\ncould not \u201cbe characterized as an attempt to make public\ncomment on sheriff \u2019s office policies and procedures, the\ninternal workings of the department, the quality of its\nemployees or upon any issue at all.\u201d Ibid.\n   Lane argues that two other Eleventh Circuit precedents\nput Franks on notice that his conduct violated the First\nAmendment: Martinez v. Opa-Locka, 971 F. 2d 708 (1992)\n(per curiam), and Tindal v. Montgomery Cty. Comm\u2019n, 32\nF. 3d 1535 (1994). Martinez involved a public employee\u2019s\nsubpoenaed testimony before the Opa-Locka City Com-\nmission regarding her employer\u2019s procurement practices.\n971 F. 2d, at 710. The Eleventh Circuit held that her\nspeech was protected, reasoning that it addressed a mat-\nter of public concern and that her interest in speaking\nfreely was not outweighed by her employer\u2019s interest in\nproviding government services. Id., at 712. It held, fur-\nther, that the relevant constitutional rules were so clearly\nestablished at the time that qualified immunity did not\napply. Id., at 713. Tindal, decided two years after Mar-\ntinez, involved a public employee\u2019s subpoenaed testimony\nin her co-worker\u2019s sexual harassment lawsuit. 32 F. 3d, at\n1537\u20131538. The court again ruled in favor of the em-\nployee. It held that the employee\u2019s speech touched upon\na public concern and that her employer had not offered\nany evidence that the speech hindered operations. Id.,\nat 1539\u20131540.\n   Morris, Martinez, and Tindal represent the landscape of\nEleventh Circuit precedent the parties rely on for qualified\nimmunity purposes. If Martinez and Tindal were control-\nling in the Eleventh Circuit in 2009, we would agree with\nLane that Franks could not reasonably have believed that\nit was lawful to fire Lane in retaliation for his testimony.\n16                        LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nBut both cases must be read together with Morris, which\nreasoned\u2014in declining to afford First Amendment protec-\ntion\u2014that the plaintiff \u2019s decision to testify was motivated\nsolely by his desire to comply with a subpoena. The same\ncould be said of Lane\u2019s decision to testify. Franks was\nthus entitled to rely on Morris when he fired Lane.6\n   Lane argues that Morris is inapplicable because it dis-\ntinguished Martinez, suggesting that Martinez survived\nMorris. See Morris, 142 F. 3d, at 1382\u20131383. But this\ndebate over whether Martinez or Morris applies to Lane\u2019s\nclaim only highlights the dispositive point: At the time of\nLane\u2019s termination, Eleventh Circuit precedent did not\nprovide clear notice that subpoenaed testimony concerning\ninformation acquired through public employment is speech\nof a citizen entitled to First Amendment protection. At\nbest, Lane can demonstrate only a discrepancy in Elev-\nenth Circuit precedent, which is insufficient to defeat the\ndefense of qualified immunity.\n   Finally, Lane argues that decisions of the Third and\nSeventh Circuits put Franks on notice that his firing of\nLane was unconstitutional. See Reilly, 532 F. 3d, at 231\n(CA3) (truthful testimony in court is citizen speech pro-\ntected by the First Amendment); Morales v. Jones, 494\nF. 3d 590, 598 (CA7 2007) (similar). But, as the court\nbelow acknowledged, those precedents were in direct\nconflict with Eleventh Circuit precedent. See 523 Fed.\nAppx., at 712, n. 3.\n   There is no doubt that the Eleventh Circuit incorrectly\nconcluded that Lane\u2019s testimony was not entitled to First\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 There is another reason Morris undermines Martinez and Tindal.\n\nIn Martinez and Tindal, the Eleventh Circuit asked only whether the\nspeech at issue addressed a matter of public concern. Morris, which\nappeared to anticipate Garcetti, asked both whether the speech at issue\nwas speech of an employee (and not a citizen) and whether it touched\nupon a matter of public concern. In this respect, one could read Morris\nas cabining Martinez and Tindal.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

But because the question was not\n\u201cbeyond debate\u201d at the time Franks acted, al-Kidd, 563\nU.

Although\nthe District Court dismissed those claims for prospective\nrelief as barred by the Eleventh Amendment, the Eleventh\nCircuit declined to consider that question on appeal, see\n523 Fed.

The petitioner in this case did not speak \u201cpursuant\nto\u201d his ordinary job duties because his responsibilities did\nnot include testifying in court proceedings, see ante, at 8,\nn. 4, and no party has suggested that he was subpoenaed\nas a representative of his employer, see Fed.

For some public\nemployees\u2014such as police officers, crime scene techni-\ncians, and laboratory analysts\u2014testifying is a routine and\ncritical part of their employment duties.

Argued April 28, 2014\u2014Decided June 19, 2014\nAs Director of Community Intensive Training for Youth (CITY), a pro-\n  gram for underprivileged youth operated by Central Alabama Com-\n  munity College (CACC), petitioner Edward Lane conducted an audit\n  of the program\u2019s expenses and discovered that Suzanne Schmitz, an\n  Alabama State Representative on CITY\u2019s payroll, had not been re-\n  porting for work. Lane eventually terminated Schmitz\u2019 employment.\n  Shortly thereafter, federal authorities indicted Schmitz on charges of\n  mail fraud and theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.\n  Lane testified, under subpoena, regarding the events that led to his\n  terminating Schmitz. Schmitz was convicted and sentenced to 30\n  months in prison. Meanwhile, CITY was experiencing significant\n  budget shortfalls. Respondent Franks, then CACC\u2019s president, ter-\n  minated Lane along with 28 other employees in a claimed effort to\n  address the financial difficulties. A few days later, however, Franks\n  rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations\u2014those of Lane and one\n  other employee. Lane sued Franks in his individual and official ca-\n  pacities under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, alleging that Franks had violated\n  the First Amendment by firing him in retaliation for testifying\n  against Schmitz.\n    The District Court granted Franks\u2019 motion for summary judgment,\n  holding that the individual-capacity claims were barred by qualified\n  immunity and the official-capacity claims were barred by the Elev-\n  enth Amendment. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that\n  Lane\u2019s testimony was not entitled to First Amendment protection. It\n  reasoned that Lane spoke as an employee and not as a citizen be-\n  cause he acted pursuant to his official duties when he investigated\n  and terminated Schmitz\u2019 employment.\nHeld:\n2                            LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       1. Lane\u2019s sworn testimony outside the scope of his ordinary job du-\n    ties is entitled to First Amendment protection. Pp. 6\u201313.\n          (a) Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205,\n    Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568, requires balancing \u201cthe interests of the\n    [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public con-\n    cern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the\n    efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d\n    Under the first step of the Pickering analysis, if the speech is made\n    pursuant to the employee\u2019s ordinary job duties, then the employee is\n    not speaking as a citizen for First Amendment purposes, and the in-\n    quiry ends. Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 421. But if the \u201cem-\n    ployee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern,\u201d the inquiry\n    turns to \u201cwhether the relevant government entity had an adequate\n    justification for treating the employee differently from any other\n    member of the general public.\u201d Id., at 418. Pp. 6\u20138.\n          (b) Lane\u2019s testimony is speech as a citizen on a matter of public\n    concern. Pp. 8\u201312.\n             (1) Sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is a quintessential\n    example of citizen speech for the simple reason that anyone who tes-\n    tifies in court bears an obligation, to the court and society at large, to\n    tell the truth. That obligation is distinct and independent from any\n    separate obligations a testifying public employee might have to his\n    employer. The Eleventh Circuit read Garcetti far too broadly in hold-\n    ing that Lane did not speak as a citizen when he testified simply be-\n    cause he learned of the subject matter of that testimony in the course\n    of his employment. Garcetti said nothing about speech that relates to\n    public employment or concerns information learned in the course of\n    that employment. The critical question under Garcetti is whether the\n    speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee\u2019s\n    duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties. Indeed, speech\n    by public employees on subject matter related to their employment\n    holds special value precisely because those employees gain knowledge\n    of matters of public concern through their employment. Pp. 9\u201311.\n             (2) Whether speech is a matter of public concern turns on the\n    \u201ccontent, form, and context\u201d of the speech. Connick v. Myers, 461\n    U. S. 138, 147\u2013148. Here, corruption in a public program and misuse\n    of state funds obviously involve matters of significant public concern.\n    See Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 425. And the form and context of the\n    speech\u2014sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding\u2014fortify that con-\n    clusion. See United States v. Alvarez, 567 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 11\u201312.\n          (c) Turning to Pickering\u2019s second step, the employer\u2019s side of the\n    scale is entirely empty. Respondents do not assert, and cannot\n    demonstrate, any government interest that tips the balance in their\n    favor\u2014for instance, evidence that Lane\u2019s testimony was false or erro-\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Pp. 12\u201313.\n     2. Franks is entitled to qualified immunity for the claims against\n  him in his individual capacity. The question here is whether Franks\n  reasonably could have believed that, when he fired Lane, a govern-\n  ment employer could fire an employee because of testimony the em-\n  ployee gave, under oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job re-\n  sponsibilities. See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___. At the\n  relevant time, Eleventh Circuit precedent did not preclude Franks\n  from holding that belief, and no decision of this Court was sufficiently\n  clear to cast doubt on controlling Circuit precedent. Any discrepan-\n  cies in Eleventh Circuit precedent only serve to highlight the disposi-\n  tive point that the question was not beyond debate at the time\n  Franks acted. Pp. 13\u201317.\n     3. The Eleventh Circuit declined to consider the District Court\u2019s\n  dismissal of the claims against respondent Burrow in her official ca-\n  pacity as CACC\u2019s acting president, and the parties have not asked\n  this Court to consider them here.

Rather, the First Amendment protec-\ntion of a public employee\u2019s speech depends on a careful\nbalance \u201cbetween the interests of the [employee], as a\ncitizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and\nthe interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the\nefficiency of the public services it performs through its\nemployees.\u201d Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High\nSchool Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968). In\nPickering, the Court struck the balance in favor of the\npublic employee, extending First Amendment protection to\na teacher who was fired after writing a letter to the editor\nof a local newspaper criticizing the school board that\nemployed him. Today, we consider whether the First\nAmendment similarly protects a public employee who\n2                      LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprovided truthful sworn testimony, compelled by sub-\npoena, outside the course of his ordinary job responsibilities.\nWe hold that it does.\n                               I\n   In 2006, Central Alabama Community College (CACC)\nhired petitioner Edward Lane to be the Director of Com-\nmunity Intensive Training for Youth (CITY), a statewide\nprogram for underprivileged youth. CACC hired Lane on\na probationary basis. In his capacity as Director, Lane\nwas responsible for overseeing CITY\u2019s day-to-day opera-\ntions, hiring and firing employees, and making decisions\nwith respect to the program\u2019s finances.\n   At the time of Lane\u2019s appointment, CITY faced signifi-\ncant financial difficulties. That prompted Lane to conduct\na comprehensive audit of the program\u2019s expenses. The\naudit revealed that Suzanne Schmitz, an Alabama State\nRepresentative on CITY\u2019s payroll, had not been reporting\nto her CITY office. After unfruitful discussions with\nSchmitz, Lane shared his finding with CACC\u2019s president\nand its attorney. They warned him that firing Schmitz\ncould have negative repercussions for him and CACC.\n   Lane nonetheless contacted Schmitz again and in-\nstructed her to show up to the Huntsville office to serve\nas a counselor. Schmitz refused; she responded that she\nwished to \u201c \u2018continue to serve the CITY program in the\nsame manner as [she had] in the past.\u2019 \u201d Lane v. Central\nAla. Community College, 523 Fed. Appx. 709, 710 (CA11\n2013) (per curiam). Lane fired her shortly thereafter.\nSchmitz told another CITY employee, Charles Foley, that\nshe intended to \u201c \u2018get [Lane] back\u2019 \u201d for firing her. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">5289412</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1 (ND Ala., Oct. 18, 2012). She also said that if\nLane ever requested money from the state legislature for\nthe program, she would tell him, \u201c \u2018[y]ou\u2019re fired.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n   Schmitz\u2019 termination drew the attention of many, in-\ncluding agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich initiated an investigation into Schmitz\u2019 employment\nwith CITY. In November 2006, Lane testified before a\nfederal grand jury about his reasons for firing Schmitz. In\nJanuary 2008, the grand jury indicted Schmitz on four\ncounts of mail fraud and four counts of theft concerning a\nprogram receiving federal funds. See United States v.\nSchmitz, 634 F. 3d 1247, 1256\u20131257 (CA11 2011). The\nindictment alleged that Schmitz had collected $177,251.82\nin federal funds even though she performed \u201c \u2018virtually no\nservices,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018generated virtually no work product,\u2019 \u201d and\n\u201c \u2018rarely even appeared for work at the CITY Program\noffices.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1260. It further alleged that Schmitz had\nsubmitted false statements concerning the hours she\nworked and the nature of the services she performed. Id.,\nat 1257.\n    Schmitz\u2019 trial, which garnered extensive press cover-\nage,1 commenced in August 2008. Lane testified, under\nsubpoena, regarding the events that led to his terminating\nSchmitz. The jury failed to reach a verdict. Roughly six\nmonths later, federal prosecutors retried Schmitz, and\nLane testified once again. This time, the jury convicted\nSchmitz on three counts of mail fraud and four counts\nof theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.\nThe District Court sentenced her to 30 months in prison\nand ordered her to pay $177,251.82 in restitution and\nforfeiture.\n    Meanwhile, CITY continued to experience considerable\nbudget shortfalls. In November 2008, Lane began report-\ning to respondent Steve Franks, who had become presi-\ndent of CACC in January 2008. Lane recommended that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See, e.g., Lawmaker Faces Fraud Charge in June, Montgomery Ad-\n\nvertiser, May 6, 2008, p. 1B; Johnson, State Lawmaker\u2019s Fraud Trial\nStarts Today, Montgomery Advertiser, Aug. 18, 2008, p. 1B; Faulk,\nSchmitz Testifies in Her Defense: Says State Job was Legitimate,\nBirmingham News, Feb. 20, 2009, p. 1A; Faulk, Schmitz Convicted,\nLoses her State Seat, Birmingham News, Feb. 25, 2009, p. 1A.\n4                         LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nFranks consider layoffs to address the financial difficul-\nties. In January 2009, Franks decided to terminate 29\nprobationary CITY employees, including Lane. Shortly\nthereafter, however, Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29\nterminations\u2014those of Lane and one other employee\u2014\nbecause of an \u201cambiguity in [those other employees\u2019] pro-\nbationary service.\u201d Brief for Respondent Franks 11.\nFranks claims that he \u201cdid not rescind Lane\u2019s termina-\ntion . . . because he believed that Lane was in a fundamen-\ntally different category than the other employees: he was\nthe director of the entire CITY program, and not simply an\nemployee.\u201d Ibid. In September 2009, CACC eliminated\nthe CITY program and terminated the program\u2019s remain-\ning employees. Franks later retired, and respondent\nSusan Burrow, the current Acting President of CACC,\nreplaced him while this case was pending before the Elev-\nenth Circuit.\n   In January 2011, Lane sued Franks in his individual\nand official capacities under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71983, alleging that Franks had violated the First\nAmendment by firing him in retaliation for his testimony\nagainst Schmitz.2 Lane sought damages from Franks in\nhis individual capacity and sought equitable relief, includ-\ning reinstatement, from Franks in his official capacity.3\n   The District Court granted Franks\u2019 motion for summary\njudgment. Although the court concluded that the record\nraised \u201cgenuine issues of material fact . . . concerning\n[Franks\u2019] true motivation for terminating [Lane\u2019s] em-\nployment,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5289412</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *6, it held that Franks was\nentitled to qualified immunity as to the damages claims\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Lane also brought claims against CACC, as well as claims under a\n\nstate whistleblower statute, Ala. Code \u00a736\u201326A\u20133 (2013), and 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71985. Those claims are not at issue here.\n  3 Because Burrow replaced Franks as President of CACC during the\n\npendency of this lawsuit, the claims originally filed against Franks in\nhis official capacity are now against Burrow.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause \u201ca reasonable government official in [Franks\u2019]\nposition would not have had reason to believe that the\nConstitution protected [Lane\u2019s] testimony,\u201d id., *12. The\nDistrict Court relied on Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410\n(2006), which held that \u201c \u2018when public employees make\nstatements pursuant to their official duties, the employees\nare not speaking as citizens for First Amendment pur-\nposes.\u2019 \u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5289412</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *10 (quoting Garcetti, 547 U. S.,\nat 421). The court found no violation of clearly established\nlaw because Lane had \u201clearned of the information that he\ntestified about while working as Director at [CITY],\u201d such\nthat his \u201cspeech [could] still be considered as part of his\nofficial job duties and not made as a citizen on a matter of\npublic concern.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5289412</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *10.\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 523 Fed. Appx., at 710.\nLike the District Court, it relied extensively on Garcetti.\nIt reasoned that, \u201c[e]ven if an employee was not required\nto make the speech as part of his official duties, he enjoys\nno First Amendment protection if his speech \u2018owes its\nexistence to [the] employee\u2019s professional responsibilities\u2019\nand is \u2018a product that the \u201cemployer himself has commis-\nsioned or created.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., at 711 (quoting Abdur-Rahman\nv. Walker, 567 F. 3d 1278, 1283 (CA11 2009)). The court\nconcluded that Lane spoke as an employee and not as a\ncitizen because he was acting pursuant to his official\nduties when he investigated Schmitz\u2019 employment, spoke\nwith Schmitz and CACC officials regarding the issue, and\nterminated Schmitz. 523 Fed. Appx., at 712. \u201cThat Lane\ntestified about his official activities pursuant to a sub-\npoena and in the litigation context,\u201d the court continued,\n\u201cdoes not bring Lane\u2019s speech within the protection of the\nFirst Amendment.\u201d Ibid. The Eleventh Circuit also con-\ncluded that, \u201ceven if . . . a constitutional violation of Lane\u2019s\nFirst Amendment rights occurred in these circumstances,\nFranks would be entitled to qualified immunity in his\npersonal capacity\u201d because the right at issue had not been\n6                     LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclearly established. Id., at 711, n. 2.\n  We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. __ (2014), to resolve\ndiscord among the Courts of Appeals as to whether public\nemployees may be fired\u2014or suffer other adverse employ-\nment consequences\u2014for providing truthful subpoenaed\ntestimony outside the course of their ordinary job respon-\nsibilities. Compare 523 Fed. Appx., at 712 (case below),\nwith, e.g., Reilly v. Atlantic City, 532 F. 3d 216, 231 (CA3\n2008).\n                              II\n  Speech by citizens on matters of public concern lies at\nthe heart of the First Amendment, which \u201cwas fashioned\nto assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing\nabout of political and social changes desired by the peo-\nple,\u201d Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957). This\nremains true when speech concerns information related to\nor learned through public employment. After all, public\nemployees do not renounce their citizenship when they\naccept employment, and this Court has cautioned time\nand again that public employers may not condition em-\nployment on the relinquishment of constitutional rights.\nSee, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of\nN. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605 (1967); Pickering, 391 U. S., at\n568; Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 142 (1983). There is\nconsiderable value, moreover, in encouraging, rather than\ninhibiting, speech by public employees.

S., at 568.\n\u201cGovernment employers, like private employers, need a\nsignificant degree of control over their employees\u2019 words\nand actions; without it, there would be little chance for the\nefficient provision of public services.\u201d Garcetti, 547 U. S.,\nat 418.\n   Pickering provides the framework for analyzing whether\nthe employee\u2019s interest or the government\u2019s interest\nshould prevail in cases where the government seeks to\ncurtail the speech of its employees. It requires \u201cbal-\nanc[ing] . . . the interests of the [public employee], as a\ncitizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and\nthe interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the\nefficiency of the public services it performs through its\nemployees.\u201d 391 U. S., at 568. In Pickering, the Court\nheld that a teacher\u2019s letter to the editor of a local news-\npaper concerning a school budget constituted speech on a\nmatter of public concern. Id., at 571. And in balancing\nthe employee\u2019s interest in such speech against the gov-\nernment\u2019s efficiency interest, the Court held that the\npublication of the letter did not \u201cimped[e] the teacher\u2019s\nproper performance of his daily duties in the classroom\u201d or\n\u201cinterfer[e] with the regular operation of the schools gen-\nerally.\u201d Id., at 572\u2013573. The Court therefore held that the\nteacher\u2019s speech could not serve as the basis for his dis-\nmissal. Id., at 574.\n   In Garcetti, we described a two-step inquiry into whether\na public employee\u2019s speech is entitled to protection:\n    \u201cThe first requires determining whether the employee\n    spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern. If the\n    answer is no, the employee has no First Amendment\n    cause of action based on his or her employer\u2019s reaction\n    to the speech. If the answer is yes, then the possibil-\n    ity of a First Amendment claim arises. The question\n    becomes whether the relevant government entity had\n8                          LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     an adequate justification for treating the employee\n     differently from any other member of the general pub-\n     lic.\u201d 547 U. S., at 418 (citations omitted).\n   In describing the first step in this inquiry, Garcetti\ndistinguished between employee speech and citizen\nspeech. Whereas speech as a citizen may trigger protec-\ntion, the Court held that \u201cwhen public employees make\nstatements pursuant to their official duties, the employees\nare not speaking as citizens for First Amendment pur-\nposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communi-\ncations from employer discipline.\u201d Id., at 421. Applying\nthat rule to the facts before it, the Court found that an\ninternal memorandum prepared by a prosecutor in the\ncourse of his ordinary job responsibilities constituted\nunprotected employee speech. Id., at 424.\n                              III\n  Against this backdrop, we turn to the question pre-\nsented: whether the First Amendment protects a public\nemployee who provides truthful sworn testimony, compelled\nby subpoena, outside the scope of his ordinary job respon-\nsibilities.4 We hold that it does.\n                             A\n  The first inquiry is whether the speech in question\u2014\nLane\u2019s testimony at Schmitz\u2019 trials\u2014is speech as a citizen\non a matter of public concern. It clearly is.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 It is undisputed that Lane\u2019s ordinary job responsibilities did not\n\ninclude testifying in court proceedings. See Lane v. Central Ala.\nCommunity College, 523 Fed. Appx. 709, 712 (CA11 2013). For that\nreason, Lane asked the Court to decide only whether truthful sworn\ntestimony that is not a part of an employee\u2019s ordinary job responsibili-\nties is citizen speech on a matter of public concern. Pet. for Cert. i. We\naccordingly need not address in this case whether truthful sworn\ntestimony would constitute citizen speech under Garcetti when given as\npart of a public employee\u2019s ordinary job duties, and express no opinion\non the matter today.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               1\n   Truthful testimony under oath by a public employee\noutside the scope of his ordinary job duties is speech as a\ncitizen for First Amendment purposes. That is so even\nwhen the testimony relates to his public employment or\nconcerns information learned during that employment.\n   In rejecting Lane\u2019s argument that his testimony was\nspeech as a citizen, the Eleventh Circuit gave short shrift\nto the nature of sworn judicial statements and ignored the\nobligation borne by all witnesses testifying under oath.\nSee 523 Fed. Appx., at 712 (finding immaterial the fact\nthat Lane spoke \u201cpursuant to a subpoena and in the litiga-\ntion context\u201d). Sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is\na quintessential example of speech as a citizen for a sim-\nple reason: Anyone who testifies in court bears an obliga-\ntion, to the court and society at large, to tell the truth.\nSee, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a71623 (criminalizing false statements\nunder oath in judicial proceedings); United States v. Man-\ndujano, 425 U. S. 564, 576 (1976) (plurality opinion) (\u201cPer-\njured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the\nbasic concept of judicial proceedings\u201d). When the person\ntestifying is a public employee, he may bear separate\nobligations to his employer\u2014for example, an obligation not\nto show up to court dressed in an unprofessional manner.\nBut any such obligations as an employee are distinct and\nindependent from the obligation, as a citizen, to speak the\ntruth. That independent obligation renders sworn testi-\nmony speech as a citizen and sets it apart from speech\nmade purely in the capacity of an employee.\n   In holding that Lane did not speak as a citizen when\nhe testified, the Eleventh Circuit read Garcetti far too\nbroadly. It reasoned that, because Lane learned of the sub-\nject matter of his testimony in the course of his employ-\nment with CITY, Garcetti requires that his testimony be\ntreated as the speech of an employee rather than that of a\ncitizen. See 523 Fed. Appx., at 712. It does not.\n10                    LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The sworn testimony in this case is far removed from\nthe speech at issue in Garcetti\u2014an internal memorandum\nprepared by a deputy district attorney for his supervisors\nrecommending dismissal of a particular prosecution. The\nGarcetti Court held that such speech was made pursuant\nto the employee\u2019s \u201cofficial responsibilities\u201d because \u201c[w]hen\n[the employee] went to work and performed the tasks he\nwas paid to perform, [he] acted as a government employee.\nThe fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak\nor write does not mean that his supervisors were prohib-\nited from evaluating his performance.\u201d 547 U. S., at 422,\n424.\n   But Garcetti said nothing about speech that simply\nrelates to public employment or concerns information\nlearned in the course of public employment. The Garcetti\nCourt made explicit that its holding did not turn on the\nfact that the memo at issue \u201cconcerned the subject matter\nof [the prosecutor\u2019s] employment,\u201d because \u201c[t]he First\nAmendment protects some expressions related to the\nspeaker\u2019s job.\u201d Id., at 421. In other words, the mere fact\nthat a citizen\u2019s speech concerns information acquired by\nvirtue of his public employment does not transform that\nspeech into employee\u2014rather than citizen\u2014speech. The\ncritical question under Garcetti is whether the speech at\nissue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee\u2019s\nduties, not whether it merely concerns those duties.\n   It bears emphasis that our precedents dating back to\nPickering have recognized that speech by public employees\non subject matter related to their employment holds\nspecial value precisely because those employees gain\nknowledge of matters of public concern through their\nemployment. In Pickering, for example, the Court ob-\nserved that \u201c[t]eachers are . . . the members of a commu-\nnity most likely to have informed and definite opinions as\nto how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should\nbe spent. Accordingly, it is essential that they be able to\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspeak out freely on such questions without fear of retalia-\ntory dismissal.\u201d 391 U. S., at 572; see also Garcetti, 547\nU. S., at 421 (recognizing that \u201c[t]he same is true of many\nother categories of public employees\u201d). Most recently, in\nSan Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S., at 80, the Court again ob-\nserved that public employees \u201care uniquely qualified to\ncomment\u201d on \u201cmatters concerning government policies\nthat are of interest to the public at large.\u201d\n  The importance of public employee speech is especially\nevident in the context of this case: a public corruption\nscandal. The United States, for example, represents that\nbecause \u201c[t]he more than 1000 prosecutions for federal\ncorruption offenses that are brought in a typical year . . .\noften depend on evidence about activities that government\nofficials undertook while in office,\u201d those prosecutions\noften \u201crequire testimony from other government employ-\nees.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20. It\nwould be antithetical to our jurisprudence to conclude that\nthe very kind of speech necessary to prosecute corruption\nby public officials\u2014speech by public employees regarding\ninformation learned through their employment\u2014may\nnever form the basis for a First Amendment retaliation\nclaim. Such a rule would place public employees who\nwitness corruption in an impossible position, torn between\nthe obligation to testify truthfully and the desire to avoid\nretaliation and keep their jobs.\n  Applying these principles, it is clear that Lane\u2019s sworn\ntestimony is speech as a citizen.\n                               2\n   Lane\u2019s testimony is also speech on a matter of public\nconcern. Speech involves matters of public concern \u201cwhen\nit can \u2018be fairly considered as relating to any matter of\npolitical, social, or other concern to the community,\u2019 or\nwhen it \u2018is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a\nsubject of general interest and of value and concern to the\n12                     LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npublic.\u2019 \u201d Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 6\u20137) (citation omitted). The inquiry turns on the\n\u201ccontent, form, and context\u201d of the speech. Connick, 461\nU. S., at 147\u2013148.\n  The content of Lane\u2019s testimony\u2014corruption in a public\nprogram and misuse of state funds\u2014obviously involves a\nmatter of significant public concern. See, e.g., Garcetti,\n547 U. S., at 425 (\u201cExposing governmental inefficiency and\nmisconduct is a matter of considerable significance\u201d). And\nthe form and context of the speech\u2014sworn testimony in a\njudicial proceeding\u2014fortify that conclusion.            \u201cUnlike\nspeech in other contexts, testimony under oath has the\nformality and gravity necessary to remind the witness\nthat his or her statements will be the basis for official\ngovernmental action, action that often affects the rights\nand liberties of others.\u201d United States v. Alvarez, 567\nU. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8\u20139) (plurality opinion).\n                        *     *    *\n   We hold, then, that Lane\u2019s truthful sworn testimony at\nSchmitz\u2019 criminal trials is speech as a citizen on a matter\nof public concern.\n                              B\n  This does not settle the matter, however. A public\nemployee\u2019s sworn testimony is not categorically entitled to\nFirst Amendment protection simply because it is speech as\na citizen on a matter of public concern. Under Pickering, if\nan employee speaks as a citizen on a matter of public\nconcern, the next question is whether the government had\n\u201can adequate justification for treating the employee differ-\nently from any other member of the public\u201d based on the\ngovernment\u2019s needs as an employer. Garcetti, 547 U. S., at\n418.\n  As discussed previously, we have recognized that gov-\nernment employers often have legitimate \u201cinterest[s] in\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

S., at 150\u2013151. We have also cautioned, however,\nthat \u201ca stronger showing [of government interests] may be\nnecessary if the employee\u2019s speech more substantially\ninvolve[s] matters of public concern.\u201d Id., at 152.\n   Here, the employer\u2019s side of the Pickering scale is entirely\nempty: Respondents do not assert, and cannot demon-\nstrate, any government interest that tips the balance in\ntheir favor. There is no evidence, for example, that Lane\u2019s\ntestimony at Schmitz\u2019 trials was false or erroneous or that\nLane unnecessarily disclosed any sensitive, confidential,\nor privileged information while testifying.5 In these cir-\ncumstances, we conclude that Lane\u2019s speech is entitled to\nprotection under the First Amendment. The Eleventh\nCircuit erred in holding otherwise and dismissing Lane\u2019s\nclaim of retaliation on that basis.\n                               IV\n  Respondent Franks argues that even if Lane\u2019s testimony\nis protected under the First Amendment, the claims\nagainst him in his individual capacity should be dismissed\non the basis of qualified immunity. We agree.\n  Qualified immunity \u201cgives government officials breath-\ning room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments\nabout open legal questions.\u201d Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). Under this doctrine, courts\nmay not award damages against a government official in\nhis personal capacity unless \u201cthe official violated a statu-\ntory or constitutional right,\u201d and \u201cthe right was \u2018clearly\nestablished\u2019 at the time of the challenged conduct.\u201d Id., at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Of course, quite apart from Pickering balancing, wrongdoing that an\n\nemployee admits to while testifying may be a valid basis for termina-\ntion or other discipline.\n14                    LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n___ (slip op., at 3).\n   The relevant question for qualified immunity purposes\nis this: Could Franks reasonably have believed, at the\ntime he fired Lane, that a government employer could fire\nan employee on account of testimony the employee gave,\nunder oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job re-\nsponsibilities? Eleventh Circuit precedent did not pre-\nclude Franks from reasonably holding that belief. And no\ndecision of this Court was sufficiently clear to cast doubt\non the controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent.\n   In dismissing Lane\u2019s claim, the Eleventh Circuit relied\non its 1998 decision in Morris v. Crow, 142 F. 3d 1379 (per\ncuriam). There, a deputy sheriff sued the sheriff and two\nother officials, alleging that he had been fired in retalia-\ntion for statements he made in an accident report and\nlater giving deposition testimony about his investigation of\na fatal car crash between another officer and a citizen.\nId., at 1381. In his accident report, the plaintiff noted that\nthe officer was driving more than 130 mph in a 50 mph\nzone, without using his emergency blue warning light.\nSee ibid. The plaintiff later testified to these facts at a\ndeposition in a wrongful death suit against the sheriff \u2019s\noffice. Ibid. His superiors later fired him. Ibid.\n   The Eleventh Circuit, in a pre-Garcetti decision, con-\ncluded that the plaintiff \u2019s deposition testimony was un-\nprotected. It held that a public employee\u2019s speech is pro-\ntected only when it is \u201c \u2018made primarily in the employee\u2019s\nrole as citizen,\u2019 \u201d rather than \u201c \u2018primarily in the role of\nemployee.\u2019 \u201d Morris, 142 F. 3d, at 1382. And it found the\nplaintiff \u2019s deposition testimony to be speech as an em-\nployee because it \u201creiterated the conclusions regarding\nhis observations of the accident\u201d that he \u201cgenerated in the\nnormal course of [his] duties.\u201d Ibid. Critically, the court\nacknowledged\u2014and was unmoved by\u2014the fact that al-\nthough the plaintiff had investigated the accident and\nprepared the report pursuant to his official duties, there\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwas no \u201cevidence that [he] gave deposition testimony for\nany reason other than in compliance with a subpoena to\ntestify truthfully in the civil suit regarding the . . . acci-\ndent.\u201d Ibid. The court further reasoned that the speech\ncould not \u201cbe characterized as an attempt to make public\ncomment on sheriff \u2019s office policies and procedures, the\ninternal workings of the department, the quality of its\nemployees or upon any issue at all.\u201d Ibid.\n   Lane argues that two other Eleventh Circuit precedents\nput Franks on notice that his conduct violated the First\nAmendment: Martinez v. Opa-Locka, 971 F. 2d 708 (1992)\n(per curiam), and Tindal v. Montgomery Cty. Comm\u2019n, 32\nF. 3d 1535 (1994). Martinez involved a public employee\u2019s\nsubpoenaed testimony before the Opa-Locka City Com-\nmission regarding her employer\u2019s procurement practices.\n971 F. 2d, at 710. The Eleventh Circuit held that her\nspeech was protected, reasoning that it addressed a mat-\nter of public concern and that her interest in speaking\nfreely was not outweighed by her employer\u2019s interest in\nproviding government services. Id., at 712. It held, fur-\nther, that the relevant constitutional rules were so clearly\nestablished at the time that qualified immunity did not\napply. Id., at 713. Tindal, decided two years after Mar-\ntinez, involved a public employee\u2019s subpoenaed testimony\nin her co-worker\u2019s sexual harassment lawsuit. 32 F. 3d, at\n1537\u20131538. The court again ruled in favor of the em-\nployee. It held that the employee\u2019s speech touched upon\na public concern and that her employer had not offered\nany evidence that the speech hindered operations. Id.,\nat 1539\u20131540.\n   Morris, Martinez, and Tindal represent the landscape of\nEleventh Circuit precedent the parties rely on for qualified\nimmunity purposes. If Martinez and Tindal were control-\nling in the Eleventh Circuit in 2009, we would agree with\nLane that Franks could not reasonably have believed that\nit was lawful to fire Lane in retaliation for his testimony.\n16                        LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nBut both cases must be read together with Morris, which\nreasoned\u2014in declining to afford First Amendment protec-\ntion\u2014that the plaintiff \u2019s decision to testify was motivated\nsolely by his desire to comply with a subpoena. The same\ncould be said of Lane\u2019s decision to testify. Franks was\nthus entitled to rely on Morris when he fired Lane.6\n   Lane argues that Morris is inapplicable because it dis-\ntinguished Martinez, suggesting that Martinez survived\nMorris. See Morris, 142 F. 3d, at 1382\u20131383. But this\ndebate over whether Martinez or Morris applies to Lane\u2019s\nclaim only highlights the dispositive point: At the time of\nLane\u2019s termination, Eleventh Circuit precedent did not\nprovide clear notice that subpoenaed testimony concerning\ninformation acquired through public employment is speech\nof a citizen entitled to First Amendment protection. At\nbest, Lane can demonstrate only a discrepancy in Elev-\nenth Circuit precedent, which is insufficient to defeat the\ndefense of qualified immunity.\n   Finally, Lane argues that decisions of the Third and\nSeventh Circuits put Franks on notice that his firing of\nLane was unconstitutional. See Reilly, 532 F. 3d, at 231\n(CA3) (truthful testimony in court is citizen speech pro-\ntected by the First Amendment); Morales v. Jones, 494\nF. 3d 590, 598 (CA7 2007) (similar). But, as the court\nbelow acknowledged, those precedents were in direct\nconflict with Eleventh Circuit precedent. See 523 Fed.\nAppx., at 712, n. 3.\n   There is no doubt that the Eleventh Circuit incorrectly\nconcluded that Lane\u2019s testimony was not entitled to First\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 There is another reason Morris undermines Martinez and Tindal.\n\nIn Martinez and Tindal, the Eleventh Circuit asked only whether the\nspeech at issue addressed a matter of public concern. Morris, which\nappeared to anticipate Garcetti, asked both whether the speech at issue\nwas speech of an employee (and not a citizen) and whether it touched\nupon a matter of public concern. In this respect, one could read Morris\nas cabining Martinez and Tindal.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

S. 410, 418 (2006),\nwhen the employee gives \u201c[t]ruthful testimony under oath\n. . . outside the scope of his ordinary job duties,\u201d ante, at 9.\nAnswering that question requires little more than a\nstraightforward application of Garcetti. There, we held\nthat when a public employee speaks \u201cpursuant to\u201d his\nofficial duties, he is not speaking \u201cas a citizen,\u201d and First\nAmendment protection is unavailable. 547 U. S., at 421\u2013\n422. The petitioner in this case did not speak \u201cpursuant\nto\u201d his ordinary job duties because his responsibilities did\nnot include testifying in court proceedings, see ante, at 8,\nn. 4, and no party has suggested that he was subpoenaed\nas a representative of his employer, see Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 30(b)(6) (requiring subpoenaed organizations to\ndesignate witnesses to testify on their behalf). Because\npetitioner did not testify to \u201cfulfil[l] a [work] responsibil-\nity,\u201d Garcetti, supra, at 421, he spoke \u201cas a citizen,\u201d not as\n2                     LANE v. FRANKS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nan employee.\n   We accordingly have no occasion to address the quite\ndifferent question whether a public employee speaks \u201cas a\ncitizen\u201d when he testifies in the course of his ordinary job\nresponsibilities. See ante, at 8, n. 4. For some public\nemployees\u2014such as police officers, crime scene techni-\ncians, and laboratory analysts\u2014testifying is a routine and\ncritical part of their employment duties. Others may be\ncalled to testify in the context of particular litigation as\nthe designated representatives of their employers. See\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 30(b)(6). The Court properly leaves\nthe constitutional questions raised by these scenarios for\nanother day.\n</pre>",
