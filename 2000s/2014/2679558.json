Argued March 31, 2014\u2014Decided June 19, 2014\nPetitioner Alice Corporation is the assignee of several patents that dis-\n  close a scheme for mitigating \u201csettlement risk,\u201d i.e., the risk that only\n  one party to an agreed-upon financial exchange will satisfy its obliga-\n  tion. In particular, the patent claims are designed to facilitate the\n  exchange of financial obligations between two parties by using a\n  computer system as a third-party intermediary. The patents in suit\n  claim (1) a method for exchanging financial obligations, (2) a comput-\n  er system configured to carry out the method for exchanging obliga-\n  tions, and (3) a computer-readable medium containing program code\n  for performing the method of exchanging obligations.\n     Respondents (together, CLS Bank), who operate a global network\n  that facilitates currency transactions, filed suit against petitioner,\n  arguing that the patent claims at issue are invalid, unenforceable, or\n  not infringed. Petitioner counterclaimed, alleging infringement. Af-\n  ter Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. 593, was decided, the District Court\n  held that all of the claims were ineligible for patent protection under\n  35 U. S. C. \u00a7101 because they are directed to an abstract idea. The\n  en banc Federal Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the claims are drawn to a patent-ineligible abstract idea,\n they are not patent eligible under \u00a7101. Pp. 5\u201317.\n    (a) The Court has long held that \u00a7101, which defines the subject\n matter eligible for patent protection, contains an implicit exception\n for \u2018 \u201c[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.\u2019 \u201d As-\n sociation for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569 U. S.\n ___, ___. In applying the \u00a7101 exception, this Court must distinguish\n patents that claim the \u201c \u2018buildin[g] block[s]\u2019 \u201d of human ingenuity,\n which are ineligible for patent protection, from those that integrate\n2                    ALICE CORP. v.

S. ___, ___, thereby\n    \u201ctransform[ing]\u201d them into a patent-eligible invention, id., at ___.\n    Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (b) Using this framework, the Court must first determine whether\n    the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept. 566\n    U. S., at ___. If so, the Court then asks whether the claim\u2019s elements,\n    considered both individually and \u201cas an ordered combination,\u201d \u201ctrans-\n    form the nature of the claim\u201d into a patent-eligible application. Id.,\n    at ___. Pp. 7\u201317.\n         (1) The claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept:\n    the abstract idea of intermediated settlement. Under \u201cthe longstand-\n    ing rule that \u2018[a]n idea of itself is not patentable,\u2019 \u201d Gottschalk v. Ben-\n    son, 409 U. S. 63, 67, this Court has found ineligible patent claims\n    involving an algorithm for converting binary-coded decimal numerals\n    into pure binary form, id., at 71\u201372; a mathematical formula for com-\n    puting \u201calarm limits\u201d in a catalytic conversion process, Parker v.\n    Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 594\u2013595; and, most recently, a method for hedg-\n    ing against the financial risk of price fluctuations, Bilski, 561 U. S, at\n    599. It follows from these cases, and Bilski in particular, that the\n    claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea. On their face, they\n    are drawn to the concept of intermediated settlement, i.e., the use of\n    a third party to mitigate settlement risk. Like the risk hedging in\n    Bilski, the concept of intermediated settlement is \u201c \u2018a fundamental\n    economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce,\u2019 \u201d ibid.,\n    and the use of a third-party intermediary (or \u201cclearing house\u201d) is a\n    building block of the modern economy. Thus, intermediated settle-\n    ment, like hedging, is an \u201cabstract idea\u201d beyond \u00a7101\u2019s scope. Pp. 7\u2013\n    10.\n         (2) Turning to the second step of Mayo\u2019s framework: The method\n    claims, which merely require generic computer implementation, fail\n    to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\n    Pp. 10\u201316.\n            (i) \u201cSimply appending conventional steps, specified at a high\n    level of generality,\u201d to a method already \u201cwell known in the art\u201d is not\n    \u201cenough\u201d to supply the \u201c \u2018inventive concept\u2019 \u201d needed to make this\n    transformation. Mayo, supra, at ___, ___. The introduction of a com-\n    puter into the claims does not alter the analysis. Neither stating an\n    abstract idea \u201cwhile adding the words \u2018apply it,\u2019 \u201d Mayo, supra, at ___,\n    nor limiting the use of an abstract idea \u201c \u2018to a particular technological\n    environment,\u2019 \u201d Bilski, supra, at 610\u2013611, is enough for patent eligi-\n    bility. Stating an abstract idea while adding the words \u201capply it with\n    a computer\u201d simply combines those two steps, with the same deficient\n    result. Wholly generic computer implementation is not generally the\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  sort of \u201cadditional featur[e]\u201d that provides any \u201cpractical assurance\n  that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize\n  the [abstract idea] itself.\u201d Mayo, supra, at ___. Pp. 11\u201314.\n         (ii) Here, the representative method claim does no more than\n  simply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract idea of in-\n  termediated settlement on a generic computer. Taking the claim el-\n  ements separately, the function performed by the computer at each\n  step\u2014creating and maintaining \u201cshadow\u201d accounts, obtaining data,\n  adjusting account balances, and issuing automated instructions\u2014is\n  \u201c[p]urely \u2018conventional. \u2019 \u201d Mayo, 566 U. S., at ___. Considered \u201cas an\n  ordered combination,\u201d these computer components \u201cad[d] nothing . . .\n  that is not already present when the steps are considered separate-\n  ly.\u201d Id., at ___. Viewed as a whole, these method claims simply recite\n  the concept of intermediated settlement as performed by a generic\n  computer. They do not, for example, purport to improve the function-\n  ing of the computer itself or effect an improvement in any other tech-\n  nology or technical field. An instruction to apply the abstract idea of\n  intermediated settlement using some unspecified, generic computer\n  is not \u201cenough\u201d to transform the abstract idea into a patent-eligible\n  invention. Id., at ___. Pp. 14\u201316.\n       (3) Because petitioner\u2019s system and media claims add nothing of\n  substance to the underlying abstract idea, they too are patent ineligi-\n  ble under \u00a7101. Petitioner conceded below that its media claims rise\n  or fall with its method claims. And the system claims are no differ-\n  ent in substance from the method claims. The method claims recite\n  the abstract idea implemented on a generic computer; the system\n  claims recite a handful of generic computer components configured to\n  implement the same idea. This Court has long \u201cwarn[ed] . . . against\u201d\n  interpreting \u00a7101 \u201cin ways that make patent eligibility \u2018depend simp-\n  ly on the draftsman\u2019s art.\u2019 \u201d Mayo, supra, at ___. Holding that the\n  system claims are patent eligible would have exactly that result.\n  Pp. 16\u201317.\n717 F. 3d 1269, affirmed.\n\n  THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

LTD, PETITIONER v. CLS\n         BANK INTERNATIONAL ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 19, 2014] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The patents at issue in this case disclose a computer-\nimplemented scheme for mitigating \u201csettlement risk\u201d (i.e.,\nthe risk that only one party to a financial transaction will\npay what it owes) by using a third-party intermediary.\nThe question presented is whether these claims are patent\neligible under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101, or are instead drawn to a\npatent-ineligible abstract idea. We hold that the claims at\nissue are drawn to the abstract idea of intermediated\nsettlement, and that merely requiring generic computer\nimplementation fails to transform that abstract idea into a\npatent-eligible invention. We therefore affirm the judg-\nment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Petitioner Alice Corporation is the assignee of several\npatents that disclose schemes to manage certain forms of\nfinancial risk.1 According to the specification largely\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 The   patents at issue are United States Patent Nos. 5,970,479 (the\n2                  ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nshared by the patents, the invention \u201cenabl[es] the man-\nagement of risk relating to specified, yet unknown, future\nevents.\u201d App. 248. The specification further explains that\nthe \u201cinvention relates to methods and apparatus, includ-\ning electrical computers and data processing systems\napplied to financial matters and risk management.\u201d Id.,\nat 243.\n  The claims at issue relate to a computerized scheme for\nmitigating \u201csettlement risk\u201d\u2014i.e., the risk that only one\nparty to an agreed-upon financial exchange will satisfy its\nobligation. In particular, the claims are designed to facili-\ntate the exchange of financial obligations between two\nparties by using a computer system as a third-party in-\ntermediary. Id., at 383\u2013384.2 The intermediary creates\n\u201cshadow\u201d credit and debit records (i.e., account ledgers)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2019479 patent), 6,912,510, 7,149,720, and 7,725,375.\n   2 The parties agree that claim 33 of the \u2019479 patent is representative\n\nof the method claims. Claim 33 recites:\n   \u201cA method of exchanging obligations as between parties, each party\nholding a credit record and a debit record with an exchange institution,\nthe credit records and debit records for exchange of predetermined\nobligations, the method comprising the steps of:\n   \u201c(a) creating a shadow credit record and a shadow debit record for\neach stakeholder party to be held independently by a supervisory\ninstitution from the exchange institutions;\n   \u201c(b) obtaining from each exchange institution a start-of-day balance\nfor each shadow credit record and shadow debit record;\n   \u201c(c) for every transaction resulting in an exchange obligation, the\nsupervisory institution adjusting each respective party\u2019s shadow credit\nrecord or shadow debit record, allowing only these transactions that do\nnot result in the value of the shadow debit record being less than the\nvalue of the shadow credit record at any time, each said adjustment\ntaking place in chronological order, and\n   \u201c(d) at the end-of-day, the supervisory institution instructing on[e] of\nthe exchange institutions to exchange credits or debits to the credit\nrecord and debit record of the respective parties in accordance with the\nadjustments of the said permitted transactions, the credits and debits\nbeing irrevocable, time invariant obligations placed on the exchange\ninstitutions.\u201d App. 383\u2013384.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat mirror the balances in the parties\u2019 real-world ac-\ncounts at \u201cexchange institutions\u201d (e.g., banks). The inter-\nmediary updates the shadow records in real time as trans-\nactions are entered, allowing \u201conly those transactions for\nwhich the parties\u2019 updated shadow records indicate suffi-\ncient resources to satisfy their mutual obligations.\u201d 717\nF. 3d 1269, 1285 (CA Fed. 2013) (Lourie, J., concurring).\nAt the end of the day, the intermediary instructs the\nrelevant financial institutions to carry out the \u201cpermitted\u201d\ntransactions in accordance with the updated shadow\nrecords, ibid., thus mitigating the risk that only one party\nwill perform the agreed-upon exchange.\n  In sum, the patents in suit claim (1) the foregoing method\nfor exchanging obligations (the method claims), (2) a\ncomputer system configured to carry out the method for\nexchanging obligations (the system claims), and (3) a\ncomputer-readable medium containing program code for\nperforming the method of exchanging obligations (the\nmedia claims). All of the claims are implemented using a\ncomputer; the system and media claims expressly recite a\ncomputer, and the parties have stipulated that the method\nclaims require a computer as well.\n                              B\n   Respondents CLS Bank International and CLS Services\nLtd. (together, CLS Bank) operate a global network that\nfacilitates currency transactions. In 2007, CLS Bank filed\nsuit against petitioner, seeking a declaratory judgment\nthat the claims at issue are invalid, unenforceable, or not\ninfringed. Petitioner counterclaimed, alleging infringe-\nment. Following this Court\u2019s decision in Bilski v. Kappos,\n561 U. S. 593 (2010), the parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment on whether the asserted claims are\neligible for patent protection under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101. The\nDistrict Court held that all of the claims are patent ineli-\ngible because they are directed to the abstract idea of\n4              ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cemploying a neutral intermediary to facilitate simultane-\nous exchange of obligations in order to minimize risk.\u201d\n768 F. Supp. 2d 221, 252 (DC 2011).\n   A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit reversed, holding that it was not\n\u201cmanifestly evident\u201d that petitioner\u2019s claims are directed\nto an abstract idea. 685 F. 3d 1341, 1352, 1356 (2012).\nThe Federal Circuit granted rehearing en banc, vacated\nthe panel opinion, and affirmed the judgment of the Dis-\ntrict Court in a one-paragraph per curiam opinion. 717\nF. 3d, at 1273. Seven of the ten participating judges\nagreed that petitioner\u2019s method and media claims are\npatent ineligible. See id., at 1274 (Lourie, J., concurring);\nid., at 1312\u20131313 (Rader, C. J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). With respect to petitioner\u2019s system\nclaims, the en banc Federal Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment by an equally divided vote. Id., at 1273.\n   Writing for a five-member plurality, Judge Lourie con-\ncluded that all of the claims at issue are patent ineligible.\nIn the plurality\u2019s view, under this Court\u2019s decision in Mayo\nCollaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.,\n566 U. S. ___ (2012), a court must first \u201cidentif[y] the\nabstract idea represented in the claim,\u201d and then deter-\nmine \u201cwhether the balance of the claim adds \u2018significantly\nmore.\u2019 \u201d 717 F. 3d, at 1286. The plurality concluded that\npetitioner\u2019s claims \u201cdraw on the abstract idea of reducing\nsettlement risk by effecting trades through a third-party\nintermediary,\u201d and that the use of a computer to maintain,\nadjust, and reconcile shadow accounts added nothing of\nsubstance to that abstract idea. Ibid.\n   Chief Judge Rader concurred in part and dissented in\npart. In a part of the opinion joined only by Judge Moore,\nChief Judge Rader agreed with the plurality that petition-\ner\u2019s method and media claims are drawn to an abstract\nidea. Id., at 1312\u20131313. In a part of the opinion joined by\nJudges Linn, Moore, and O\u2019Malley, Chief Judge Rader\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould have held that the system claims are patent eligible\nbecause they involve computer \u201chardware\u201d that is \u201cspecifi-\ncally programmed to solve a complex problem.\u201d Id., at\n1307. Judge Moore wrote a separate opinion dissenting in\npart, arguing that the system claims are patent eligible.\nId., at 1313\u20131314. Judge Newman filed an opinion con-\ncurring in part and dissenting in part, arguing that all of\npetitioner\u2019s claims are patent eligible. Id., at 1327. Judges\nLinn and O\u2019Malley filed a separate dissenting opinion\nreaching that same conclusion. Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), and now\naffirm.\n                              II\n   Section 101 of the Patent Act defines the subject matter\neligible for patent protection. It provides:\n      \u201cWhoever invents or discovers any new and useful\n    process, machine, manufacture, or composition of\n    matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof,\n    may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions\n    and requirements of this title.\u201d 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101.\n\u201cWe have long held that this provision contains an im-\nportant implicit exception: Laws of nature, natural phe-\nnomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable.\u201d Associa-\ntion for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). We have interpreted \u00a7101\nand its predecessors in light of this exception for more\nthan 150 years. Bilski, supra, at 601\u2013602; see also\nO\u2019Reilly v.

See, e.g., Bilski,\nsupra, at 611\u2013612 (upholding the patent \u201cwould pre-empt\nuse of this approach in all fields, and would effectively\n6               ALICE CORP. v.

At some level, \u201call\ninventions . . . embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply\nlaws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas.\u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 2). Thus, an invention is not ren-\ndered ineligible for patent simply because it involves an\nabstract concept. See Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175,\n187 (1981). \u201c[A]pplication[s]\u201d of such concepts \u201c \u2018to a new\nand useful end,\u2019 \u201d we have said, remain eligible for patent\nprotection. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972).\n   Accordingly, in applying the \u00a7101 exception, we must\ndistinguish between patents that claim the \u201c \u2018buildin[g]\nblock[s]\u2019 \u201d of human ingenuity and those that integrate the\nbuilding blocks into something more, Mayo, 566 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 20), thereby \u201ctransform[ing]\u201d them into a\npatent-eligible invention, id., at ___ (slip op., at 3). The\nformer \u201cwould risk disproportionately tying up the use of\nthe underlying\u201d ideas, id., at ___ (slip op., at 4), and are\ntherefore ineligible for patent protection. The latter pose\nno comparable risk of pre-emption, and therefore remain\neligible for the monopoly granted under our patent laws.\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

Prometheus Laborato-\nries, Inc., 566 U. S. ___ (2012), we set forth a framework\nfor distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natu-\nral phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim\npatent-eligible applications of those concepts. First, we\ndetermine whether the claims at issue are directed to one\nof those patent-ineligible concepts. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). If so, we then ask, \u201c[w]hat else is there in the claims\nbefore us?\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). To answer that\nquestion, we consider the elements of each claim both\nindividually and \u201cas an ordered combination\u201d to determine\nwhether the additional elements \u201ctransform the nature of\nthe claim\u201d into a patent-eligible application. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 10, 9). We have described step two of this\nanalysis as a search for an \u201c \u2018inventive concept\u2019 \u201d\u2014i.e., an\nelement or combination of elements that is \u201csufficient to\nensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly\nmore than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.\u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 3).3\n                              A\n  We must first determine whether the claims at issue are\ndirected to a patent-ineligible concept. We conclude that\nthey are: These claims are drawn to the abstract idea of\nintermediated settlement.\n  The \u201cabstract ideas\u201d category embodies \u201cthe longstand-\ning rule that \u2018[a]n idea of itself is not patentable.\u2019 \u201d Ben-\nson, supra, at 67 (quoting Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. How-\nard, 20 Wall. 498, 507 (1874)); see also Le Roy, supra, at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Because the approach we made explicit in Mayo considers all claim\n\nelements, both individually and in combination, it is consistent with the\ngeneral rule that patent claims \u201cmust be considered as a whole.\u201d\nDiamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 188 (1981); see Parker v. Flook, 437\nU. S. 584, 594 (1978) (\u201cOur approach . . . is . . . not at all inconsistent\nwith the view that a patent claim must be considered as a whole\u201d).\n8              ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n175 (\u201cA principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth;\nan original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as\nno one can claim in either of them an exclusive right \u201d). In\nBenson, for example, this Court rejected as ineligible\npatent claims involving an algorithm for converting binary-\ncoded decimal numerals into pure binary form, holding\nthat the claimed patent was \u201cin practical effect . . . a pat-\nent on the algorithm itself.\u201d 409 U. S., at 71\u201372. And in\nParker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 594\u2013595 (1978), we held\nthat a mathematical formula for computing \u201calarm limits\u201d\nin a catalytic conversion process was also a patent-\nineligible abstract idea.\n  We most recently addressed the category of abstract\nideas in Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. 593 (2010). The claims\nat issue in Bilski described a method for hedging against\nthe financial risk of price fluctuations. Claim 1 recited a\nseries of steps for hedging risk, including: (1) initiating a\nseries of financial transactions between providers and\nconsumers of a commodity; (2) identifying market partici-\npants that have a counterrisk for the same commodity;\nand (3) initiating a series of transactions between those\nmarket participants and the commodity provider to bal-\nance the risk position of the first series of consumer trans-\nactions. Id., at 599. Claim 4 \u201cpu[t] the concept articulated\nin claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.\u201d Ibid. The\nremaining claims were drawn to examples of hedging in\ncommodities and energy markets.\n  \u201c[A]ll members of the Court agree[d]\u201d that the patent at\nissue in Bilski claimed an \u201cabstract idea.\u201d Id., at 609; see\nalso id., at 619 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).\nSpecifically, the claims described \u201cthe basic concept of\nhedging, or protecting against risk.\u201d Id., at 611. The\nCourt explained that \u201c \u2018[h]edging is a fundamental economic\npractice long prevalent in our system of commerce and\ntaught in any introductory finance class.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. \u201cThe\nconcept of hedging\u201d as recited by the claims in suit was\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntherefore a patent-ineligible \u201cabstract idea, just like the\nalgorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.\u201d Ibid.\n   It follows from our prior cases, and Bilski in particular,\nthat the claims at issue here are directed to an abstract\nidea. Petitioner\u2019s claims involve a method of exchanging\nfinancial obligations between two parties using a third-\nparty intermediary to mitigate settlement risk. The in-\ntermediary creates and updates \u201cshadow\u201d records to re-\nflect the value of each party\u2019s actual accounts held at\n\u201cexchange institutions,\u201d thereby permitting only those\ntransactions for which the parties have sufficient re-\nsources. At the end of each day, the intermediary issues\nirrevocable instructions to the exchange institutions to\ncarry out the permitted transactions.\n   On their face, the claims before us are drawn to the\nconcept of intermediated settlement, i.e., the use of a third\nparty to mitigate settlement risk. Like the risk hedging in\nBilski, the concept of intermediated settlement is \u201c \u2018a\nfundamental economic practice long prevalent in our\nsystem of commerce.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.; see, e.g., Emery, Speculation\non the Stock and Produce Exchanges of the United States,\nin 7 Studies in History, Economics and Public Law 283,\n346\u2013356 (1896) (discussing the use of a \u201cclearing-house\u201d as\nan intermediary to reduce settlement risk). The use of a\nthird-party intermediary (or \u201cclearing house\u201d) is also a\nbuilding block of the modern economy. See, e.g., Yadav,\nThe Problematic Case of Clearinghouses in Complex Mar-\nkets, 101 Geo. L. J. 387, 406\u2013412 (2013); J. Hull, Risk\nManagement and Financial Institutions 103\u2013104 (3d ed.\n2012). Thus, intermediated settlement, like hedging, is an\n\u201cabstract idea\u201d beyond the scope of \u00a7101.\n   Petitioner acknowledges that its claims describe inter-\nmediated settlement, see Brief for Petitioner 4, but rejects\nthe conclusion that its claims recite an \u201cabstract idea.\u201d\nDrawing on the presence of mathematical formulas in\nsome of our abstract-ideas precedents, petitioner contends\n10             ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the abstract-ideas category is confined to \u201cpreexist-\ning, fundamental truth[s]\u201d that \u201c \u2018exis[t ] in principle apart\nfrom any human action.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 23, 26 (quoting Mayo,\n566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8)).\n   Bilski belies petitioner\u2019s assertion. The concept of risk\nhedging we identified as an abstract idea in that case\ncannot be described as a \u201cpreexisting, fundamental truth.\u201d\nThe patent in Bilski simply involved a \u201cseries of steps\ninstructing how to hedge risk.\u201d 561 U. S., at 599. Al-\nthough hedging is a longstanding commercial practice, id.,\nat 599, it is a method of organizing human activity, not a\n\u201ctruth\u201d about the natural world \u201c \u2018that has always existed,\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 22 (quoting Flook, supra, at 593,\nn. 15). One of the claims in Bilski reduced hedging to a\nmathematical formula, but the Court did not assign any\nspecial significance to that fact, much less the sort of\ntalismanic significance petitioner claims. Instead, the\nCourt grounded its conclusion that all of the claims at\nissue were abstract ideas in the understanding that risk\nhedging was a \u201c \u2018fundamental economic practice.\u2019 \u201d 561\nU. S., at 611.\n   In any event, we need not labor to delimit the precise\ncontours of the \u201cabstract ideas\u201d category in this case. It is\nenough to recognize that there is no meaningful distinc-\ntion between the concept of risk hedging in Bilski and the\nconcept of intermediated settlement at issue here. Both\nare squarely within the realm of \u201cabstract ideas\u201d as we\nhave used that term.\n                             B\n   Because the claims at issue are directed to the abstract\nidea of intermediated settlement, we turn to the second\nstep in Mayo\u2019s framework. We conclude that the method\nclaims, which merely require generic computer implemen-\ntation, fail to transform that abstract idea into a patent-\neligible invention.\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n                                1\n   At Mayo step two, we must examine the elements of the\nclaim to determine whether it contains an \u201c \u2018inventive\nconcept\u2019 \u201d sufficient to \u201ctransform\u201d the claimed abstract\nidea into a patent-eligible application. 566 U. S., at ___,\n___ (slip op., at 3, 11). A claim that recites an abstract\nidea must include \u201cadditional features\u201d to ensure \u201cthat the\n[claim] is more than a drafting effort designed to monopo-\nlize the [abstract idea].\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8\u20139). Mayo\nmade clear that transformation into a patent-eligible\napplication requires \u201cmore than simply stat[ing] the [ab-\nstract idea] while adding the words \u2018apply it.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 3).\n   Mayo itself is instructive. The patents at issue in Mayo\nclaimed a method for measuring metabolites in the blood-\nstream in order to calibrate the appropriate dosage of\nthiopurine drugs in the treatment of autoimmune dis-\neases. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4\u20136). The respondent in that\ncase contended that the claimed method was a patent-\neligible application of natural laws that describe the rela-\ntionship between the concentration of certain metabolites\nand the likelihood that the drug dosage will be harmful or\nineffective. But methods for determining metabolite levels\nwere already \u201cwell known in the art,\u201d and the process at\nissue amounted to \u201cnothing significantly more than an\ninstruction to doctors to apply the applicable laws when\ntreating their patients.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n\u201cSimply appending conventional steps, specified at a high\nlevel of generality,\u201d was not \u201cenough\u201d to supply an \u201c \u2018in-\nventive concept.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___, ___, ___ (slip op., at 14, 8, 3).\n   The introduction of a computer into the claims does not\nalter the analysis at Mayo step two. In Benson, for exam-\nple, we considered a patent that claimed an algorithm\nimplemented on \u201ca general-purpose digital computer.\u201d 409\nU. S., at 64. Because the algorithm was an abstract idea,\nsee supra, at 8, the claim had to supply a \u201c \u2018new and use-\n12             ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nful\u2019 \u201d application of the idea in order to be patent eligible.\n409 U. S., at 67. But the computer implementation did\nnot supply the necessary inventive concept; the process\ncould be \u201ccarried out in existing computers long in use.\u201d\nIbid. We accordingly \u201cheld that simply implementing a\nmathematical principle on a physical machine, namely a\ncomputer, [i]s not a patentable application of that princi-\nple.\u201d Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (citing Benson,\nsupra, at 64).\n   Flook is to the same effect. There, we examined a com-\nputerized method for using a mathematical formula to\nadjust alarm limits for certain operating conditions (e.g.,\ntemperature and pressure) that could signal inefficiency or\ndanger in a catalytic conversion process. 437 U. S., at\n585\u2013586. Once again, the formula itself was an abstract\nidea, see supra, at 8, and the computer implementation\nwas purely conventional. 437 U. S., at 594 (noting that\nthe \u201cuse of computers for \u2018automatic monitoring-\nalarming\u2019 \u201d was \u201cwell known\u201d). In holding that the process\nwas patent ineligible, we rejected the argument that\n\u201cimplement[ing] a principle in some specific fashion\u201d will\n\u201cautomatically fal[l] within the patentable subject matter\nof \u00a7101.\u201d Id., at 593. Thus, \u201cFlook stands for the proposi-\ntion that the prohibition against patenting abstract ideas\ncannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of\n[the idea] to a particular technological environment.\u201d\nBilski, 561 U. S., at 610\u2013611 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   In Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, by contrast, we held that a\ncomputer-implemented process for curing rubber was\npatent eligible, but not because it involved a computer.\nThe claim employed a \u201cwell-known\u201d mathematical equa-\ntion, but it used that equation in a process designed to\nsolve a technological problem in \u201cconventional industry\npractice.\u201d Id., at 177, 178. The invention in Diehr used a\n\u201cthermocouple\u201d to record constant temperature measure-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nments inside the rubber mold\u2014something \u201cthe industry\nha[d] not been able to obtain.\u201d Id., at 178, and n. 3. The\ntemperature measurements were then fed into a computer,\nwhich repeatedly recalculated the remaining cure time\nby using the mathematical equation. Id., at 178\u2013179.\nThese additional steps, we recently explained, \u201ctrans-\nformed the process into an inventive application of the\nformula.\u201d Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12). In other\nwords, the claims in Diehr were patent eligible because\nthey improved an existing technological process, not be-\ncause they were implemented on a computer.\n  These cases demonstrate that the mere recitation of a\ngeneric computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible\nabstract idea into a patent-eligible invention. Stating an\nabstract idea \u201cwhile adding the words \u2018apply it\u2019 \u201d is not\nenough for patent eligibility. Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 3). Nor is limiting the use of an abstract idea \u201c \u2018to a\nparticular technological environment.\u2019 \u201d Bilski, supra, at\n610\u2013611. Stating an abstract idea while adding the words\n\u201capply it with a computer\u201d simply combines those two\nsteps, with the same deficient result. Thus, if a patent\u2019s\nrecitation of a computer amounts to a mere instruction to\n\u201cimplemen[t]\u201d an abstract idea \u201con . . . a computer,\u201d Mayo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 16), that addition cannot impart\npatent eligibility. This conclusion accords with the pre-\nemption concern that undergirds our \u00a7101 jurisprudence.\nGiven the ubiquity of computers, see 717 F. 3d, at 1286\n(Lourie, J., concurring), wholly generic computer imple-\nmentation is not generally the sort of \u201cadditional featur[e]\u201d\nthat provides any \u201cpractical assurance that the process is\nmore than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the\n[abstract idea] itself.\u201d Mayo, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8\u20139).\n  The fact that a computer \u201cnecessarily exist[s] in the\nphysical, rather than purely conceptual, realm,\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 39, is beside the point. There is no dispute that\n14             ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na computer is a tangible system (in \u00a7101 terms, a \u201cma-\nchine\u201d), or that many computer-implemented claims are\nformally addressed to patent-eligible subject matter. But\nif that were the end of the \u00a7101 inquiry, an applicant could\nclaim any principle of the physical or social sciences by\nreciting a computer system configured to implement the\nrelevant concept. Such a result would make the determi-\nnation of patent eligibility \u201cdepend simply on the drafts-\nman\u2019s art,\u201d Flook, supra, at 593, thereby eviscerating the\nrule that \u201c \u2018[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and\nabstract ideas are not patentable,\u2019 \u201d Myriad, 569 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 11).\n                              2\n   The representative method claim in this case recites the\nfollowing steps: (1) \u201ccreating\u201d shadow records for each\ncounterparty to a transaction; (2) \u201cobtaining\u201d start-of-day\nbalances based on the parties\u2019 real-world accounts at\nexchange institutions; (3) \u201cadjusting\u201d the shadow records\nas transactions are entered, allowing only those transac-\ntions for which the parties have sufficient resources; and\n(4) issuing irrevocable end-of-day instructions to the ex-\nchange institutions to carry out the permitted transac-\ntions. See n. 2, supra. Petitioner principally contends that\nthe claims are patent eligible because these steps \u201crequire\na substantial and meaningful role for the computer.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 48. As stipulated, the claimed method\nrequires the use of a computer to create electronic records,\ntrack multiple transactions, and issue simultaneous in-\nstructions; in other words, \u201c[t]he computer is itself the\nintermediary.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis deleted).\n   In light of the foregoing, see supra, at 11\u201314, the rele-\nvant question is whether the claims here do more than\nsimply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract\nidea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer.\nThey do not.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Taking the claim elements separately, the function\nperformed by the computer at each step of the process is\n\u201c[p]urely conventional.\u201d Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n10) (internal quotation marks omitted). Using a computer\nto create and maintain \u201cshadow\u201d accounts amounts to\nelectronic recordkeeping\u2014one of the most basic functions\nof a computer. See, e.g., Benson, 409 U. S., at 65 (noting\nthat a computer \u201coperates . . . upon both new and previ-\nously stored data\u201d). The same is true with respect to the\nuse of a computer to obtain data, adjust account balances,\nand issue automated instructions; all of these computer\nfunctions are \u201cwell-understood, routine, conventional\nactivit[ies]\u201d previously known to the industry. Mayo, 566\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). In short, each step does no\nmore than require a generic computer to perform generic\ncomputer functions.\n  Considered \u201cas an ordered combination,\u201d the computer\ncomponents of petitioner\u2019s method \u201cad[d] nothing . . . that\nis not already present when the steps are considered\nseparately.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). Viewed as a\nwhole, petitioner\u2019s method claims simply recite the concept\nof intermediated settlement as performed by a generic\ncomputer. See 717 F. 3d, at 1286 (Lourie, J., concurring)\n(noting that the representative method claim \u201clacks any\nexpress language to define the computer\u2019s participation\u201d).\nThe method claims do not, for example, purport to improve\nthe functioning of the computer itself. See ibid. (\u201cThere is\nno specific or limiting recitation of . . . improved computer\ntechnology . . . \u201d); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n28\u201330. Nor do they effect an improvement in any other\ntechnology or technical field. See, e.g., Diehr, 450 U. S., at\n177\u2013178. Instead, the claims at issue amount to \u201cnothing\nsignificantly more\u201d than an instruction to apply the ab-\nstract idea of intermediated settlement using some un-\nspecified, generic computer. Mayo, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10). Under our precedents, that is not \u201cenough\u201d to\n16             ALICE CORP. v.

Petitioner conceded below that its media claims rise\nor fall with its method claims. En Banc Response Brief for\nDefendant-Appellant in No. 11\u20131301 (CA Fed.) p. 50, n. 3.\nAs to its system claims, petitioner emphasizes that those\nclaims recite \u201cspecific hardware\u201d configured to perform\n\u201cspecific computerized functions.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 53.\nBut what petitioner characterizes as specific hardware\u2014a\n\u201cdata processing system\u201d with a \u201ccommunications control-\nler\u201d and \u201cdata storage unit,\u201d for example, see App. 954,\n958, 1257\u2014is purely functional and generic. Nearly every\ncomputer will include a \u201ccommunications controller\u201d and\n\u201cdata storage unit\u201d capable of performing the basic calcu-\nlation, storage, and transmission functions required by the\nmethod claims. See 717 F. 3d, at 1290 (Lourie, J., concur-\nring). As a result, none of the hardware recited by the\nsystem claims \u201coffers a meaningful limitation beyond\ngenerally linking \u2018the use of the [method] to a particular\ntechnological environment,\u2019 that is, implementation via\ncomputers.\u201d Id., at 1291 (quoting Bilski, 561 U.

Argued March 31, 2014\u2014Decided June 19, 2014\nPetitioner Alice Corporation is the assignee of several patents that dis-\n  close a scheme for mitigating \u201csettlement risk,\u201d i.e., the risk that only\n  one party to an agreed-upon financial exchange will satisfy its obliga-\n  tion. In particular, the patent claims are designed to facilitate the\n  exchange of financial obligations between two parties by using a\n  computer system as a third-party intermediary. The patents in suit\n  claim (1) a method for exchanging financial obligations, (2) a comput-\n  er system configured to carry out the method for exchanging obliga-\n  tions, and (3) a computer-readable medium containing program code\n  for performing the method of exchanging obligations.\n     Respondents (together, CLS Bank), who operate a global network\n  that facilitates currency transactions, filed suit against petitioner,\n  arguing that the patent claims at issue are invalid, unenforceable, or\n  not infringed. Petitioner counterclaimed, alleging infringement. Af-\n  ter Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. 593, was decided, the District Court\n  held that all of the claims were ineligible for patent protection under\n  35 U. S. C. \u00a7101 because they are directed to an abstract idea. The\n  en banc Federal Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the claims are drawn to a patent-ineligible abstract idea,\n they are not patent eligible under \u00a7101. Pp. 5\u201317.\n    (a) The Court has long held that \u00a7101, which defines the subject\n matter eligible for patent protection, contains an implicit exception\n for \u2018 \u201c[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.\u2019 \u201d As-\n sociation for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569 U. S.\n ___, ___. In applying the \u00a7101 exception, this Court must distinguish\n patents that claim the \u201c \u2018buildin[g] block[s]\u2019 \u201d of human ingenuity,\n which are ineligible for patent protection, from those that integrate\n2                    ALICE CORP. v.

S., at ___. If so, the Court then asks whether the claim\u2019s elements,\n    considered both individually and \u201cas an ordered combination,\u201d \u201ctrans-\n    form the nature of the claim\u201d into a patent-eligible application. Id.,\n    at ___. Pp. 7\u201317.\n         (1) The claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept:\n    the abstract idea of intermediated settlement. Under \u201cthe longstand-\n    ing rule that \u2018[a]n idea of itself is not patentable,\u2019 \u201d Gottschalk v. Ben-\n    son, 409 U. S. 63, 67, this Court has found ineligible patent claims\n    involving an algorithm for converting binary-coded decimal numerals\n    into pure binary form, id., at 71\u201372; a mathematical formula for com-\n    puting \u201calarm limits\u201d in a catalytic conversion process, Parker v.\n    Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 594\u2013595; and, most recently, a method for hedg-\n    ing against the financial risk of price fluctuations, Bilski, 561 U. S, at\n    599. It follows from these cases, and Bilski in particular, that the\n    claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea. On their face, they\n    are drawn to the concept of intermediated settlement, i.e., the use of\n    a third party to mitigate settlement risk. Like the risk hedging in\n    Bilski, the concept of intermediated settlement is \u201c \u2018a fundamental\n    economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce,\u2019 \u201d ibid.,\n    and the use of a third-party intermediary (or \u201cclearing house\u201d) is a\n    building block of the modern economy. Thus, intermediated settle-\n    ment, like hedging, is an \u201cabstract idea\u201d beyond \u00a7101\u2019s scope. Pp. 7\u2013\n    10.\n         (2) Turning to the second step of Mayo\u2019s framework: The method\n    claims, which merely require generic computer implementation, fail\n    to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\n    Pp. 10\u201316.\n            (i) \u201cSimply appending conventional steps, specified at a high\n    level of generality,\u201d to a method already \u201cwell known in the art\u201d is not\n    \u201cenough\u201d to supply the \u201c \u2018inventive concept\u2019 \u201d needed to make this\n    transformation. Mayo, supra, at ___, ___. The introduction of a com-\n    puter into the claims does not alter the analysis. Neither stating an\n    abstract idea \u201cwhile adding the words \u2018apply it,\u2019 \u201d Mayo, supra, at ___,\n    nor limiting the use of an abstract idea \u201c \u2018to a particular technological\n    environment,\u2019 \u201d Bilski, supra, at 610\u2013611, is enough for patent eligi-\n    bility. Stating an abstract idea while adding the words \u201capply it with\n    a computer\u201d simply combines those two steps, with the same deficient\n    result. Wholly generic computer implementation is not generally the\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Pp. 11\u201314.\n         (ii) Here, the representative method claim does no more than\n  simply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract idea of in-\n  termediated settlement on a generic computer. Taking the claim el-\n  ements separately, the function performed by the computer at each\n  step\u2014creating and maintaining \u201cshadow\u201d accounts, obtaining data,\n  adjusting account balances, and issuing automated instructions\u2014is\n  \u201c[p]urely \u2018conventional. \u2019 \u201d Mayo, 566 U. S., at ___. Considered \u201cas an\n  ordered combination,\u201d these computer components \u201cad[d] nothing . . .\n  that is not already present when the steps are considered separate-\n  ly.\u201d Id., at ___. Viewed as a whole, these method claims simply recite\n  the concept of intermediated settlement as performed by a generic\n  computer. They do not, for example, purport to improve the function-\n  ing of the computer itself or effect an improvement in any other tech-\n  nology or technical field. An instruction to apply the abstract idea of\n  intermediated settlement using some unspecified, generic computer\n  is not \u201cenough\u201d to transform the abstract idea into a patent-eligible\n  invention. Id., at ___. Pp. 14\u201316.\n       (3) Because petitioner\u2019s system and media claims add nothing of\n  substance to the underlying abstract idea, they too are patent ineligi-\n  ble under \u00a7101. Petitioner conceded below that its media claims rise\n  or fall with its method claims. And the system claims are no differ-\n  ent in substance from the method claims. The method claims recite\n  the abstract idea implemented on a generic computer; the system\n  claims recite a handful of generic computer components configured to\n  implement the same idea. This Court has long \u201cwarn[ed] . . . against\u201d\n  interpreting \u00a7101 \u201cin ways that make patent eligibility \u2018depend simp-\n  ly on the draftsman\u2019s art.\u2019 \u201d Mayo, supra, at ___.

S. C. \u00a7101, or are instead drawn to a\npatent-ineligible abstract idea. We hold that the claims at\nissue are drawn to the abstract idea of intermediated\nsettlement, and that merely requiring generic computer\nimplementation fails to transform that abstract idea into a\npatent-eligible invention. We therefore affirm the judg-\nment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Petitioner Alice Corporation is the assignee of several\npatents that disclose schemes to manage certain forms of\nfinancial risk.1 According to the specification largely\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 The   patents at issue are United States Patent Nos. 5,970,479 (the\n2                  ALICE CORP. v.

The specification further explains that\nthe \u201cinvention relates to methods and apparatus, includ-\ning electrical computers and data processing systems\napplied to financial matters and risk management.\u201d Id.,\nat 243.\n  The claims at issue relate to a computerized scheme for\nmitigating \u201csettlement risk\u201d\u2014i.e., the risk that only one\nparty to an agreed-upon financial exchange will satisfy its\nobligation. In particular, the claims are designed to facili-\ntate the exchange of financial obligations between two\nparties by using a computer system as a third-party in-\ntermediary. Id., at 383\u2013384.2 The intermediary creates\n\u201cshadow\u201d credit and debit records (i.e., account ledgers)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2019479 patent), 6,912,510, 7,149,720, and 7,725,375.\n   2 The parties agree that claim 33 of the \u2019479 patent is representative\n\nof the method claims. Claim 33 recites:\n   \u201cA method of exchanging obligations as between parties, each party\nholding a credit record and a debit record with an exchange institution,\nthe credit records and debit records for exchange of predetermined\nobligations, the method comprising the steps of:\n   \u201c(a) creating a shadow credit record and a shadow debit record for\neach stakeholder party to be held independently by a supervisory\ninstitution from the exchange institutions;\n   \u201c(b) obtaining from each exchange institution a start-of-day balance\nfor each shadow credit record and shadow debit record;\n   \u201c(c) for every transaction resulting in an exchange obligation, the\nsupervisory institution adjusting each respective party\u2019s shadow credit\nrecord or shadow debit record, allowing only these transactions that do\nnot result in the value of the shadow debit record being less than the\nvalue of the shadow credit record at any time, each said adjustment\ntaking place in chronological order, and\n   \u201c(d) at the end-of-day, the supervisory institution instructing on[e] of\nthe exchange institutions to exchange credits or debits to the credit\nrecord and debit record of the respective parties in accordance with the\nadjustments of the said permitted transactions, the credits and debits\nbeing irrevocable, time invariant obligations placed on the exchange\ninstitutions.\u201d App. 383\u2013384.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

See, e.g., Bilski,\nsupra, at 611\u2013612 (upholding the patent \u201cwould pre-empt\nuse of this approach in all fields, and would effectively\n6               ALICE CORP. v.

Laws of nature,\nnatural phenomena, and abstract ideas are \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe basic\ntools of scientific and technological work.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Myriad,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 11). \u201c[M]onopolization of those\ntools through the grant of a patent might tend to impede\ninnovation more than it would tend to promote it,\u201d thereby\nthwarting the primary object of the patent laws. Mayo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 2); see U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl.\n8 (Congress \u201cshall have Power . . . To promote the Pro-\ngress of Science and useful Arts\u201d). We have \u201crepeatedly\nemphasized this . . . concern that patent law not inhibit\nfurther discovery by improperly tying up the future use\nof \u201d these building blocks of human ingenuity. Mayo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (citing Morse, supra, at 113).\n   At the same time, we tread carefully in construing this\nexclusionary principle lest it swallow all of patent law.\nMayo, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). At some level, \u201call\ninventions . . . embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply\nlaws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas.\u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 2). Thus, an invention is not ren-\ndered ineligible for patent simply because it involves an\nabstract concept. See Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175,\n187 (1981). \u201c[A]pplication[s]\u201d of such concepts \u201c \u2018to a new\nand useful end,\u2019 \u201d we have said, remain eligible for patent\nprotection. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972).\n   Accordingly, in applying the \u00a7101 exception, we must\ndistinguish between patents that claim the \u201c \u2018buildin[g]\nblock[s]\u2019 \u201d of human ingenuity and those that integrate the\nbuilding blocks into something more, Mayo, 566 U.

The\nformer \u201cwould risk disproportionately tying up the use of\nthe underlying\u201d ideas, id., at ___ (slip op., at 4), and are\ntherefore ineligible for patent protection. The latter pose\nno comparable risk of pre-emption, and therefore remain\neligible for the monopoly granted under our patent laws.\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

Prometheus Laborato-\nries, Inc., 566 U. S. ___ (2012), we set forth a framework\nfor distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natu-\nral phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim\npatent-eligible applications of those concepts. First, we\ndetermine whether the claims at issue are directed to one\nof those patent-ineligible concepts. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). If so, we then ask, \u201c[w]hat else is there in the claims\nbefore us?\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). To answer that\nquestion, we consider the elements of each claim both\nindividually and \u201cas an ordered combination\u201d to determine\nwhether the additional elements \u201ctransform the nature of\nthe claim\u201d into a patent-eligible application. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 10, 9). We have described step two of this\nanalysis as a search for an \u201c \u2018inventive concept\u2019 \u201d\u2014i.e., an\nelement or combination of elements that is \u201csufficient to\nensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly\nmore than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.\u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 3).3\n                              A\n  We must first determine whether the claims at issue are\ndirected to a patent-ineligible concept. We conclude that\nthey are: These claims are drawn to the abstract idea of\nintermediated settlement.\n  The \u201cabstract ideas\u201d category embodies \u201cthe longstand-\ning rule that \u2018[a]n idea of itself is not patentable.\u2019 \u201d Ben-\nson, supra, at 67 (quoting Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v.

Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 188 (1981); see Parker v. Flook, 437\nU. S. 584, 594 (1978) (\u201cOur approach . . . is . . . not at all inconsistent\nwith the view that a patent claim must be considered as a whole\u201d).\n8              ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n175 (\u201cA principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth;\nan original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as\nno one can claim in either of them an exclusive right \u201d). In\nBenson, for example, this Court rejected as ineligible\npatent claims involving an algorithm for converting binary-\ncoded decimal numerals into pure binary form, holding\nthat the claimed patent was \u201cin practical effect . . . a pat-\nent on the algorithm itself.\u201d 409 U. S., at 71\u201372. And in\nParker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 594\u2013595 (1978), we held\nthat a mathematical formula for computing \u201calarm limits\u201d\nin a catalytic conversion process was also a patent-\nineligible abstract idea.\n  We most recently addressed the category of abstract\nideas in Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. 593 (2010). The claims\nat issue in Bilski described a method for hedging against\nthe financial risk of price fluctuations. Claim 1 recited a\nseries of steps for hedging risk, including: (1) initiating a\nseries of financial transactions between providers and\nconsumers of a commodity; (2) identifying market partici-\npants that have a counterrisk for the same commodity;\nand (3) initiating a series of transactions between those\nmarket participants and the commodity provider to bal-\nance the risk position of the first series of consumer trans-\nactions. Id., at 599. Claim 4 \u201cpu[t] the concept articulated\nin claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.\u201d Ibid. The\nremaining claims were drawn to examples of hedging in\ncommodities and energy markets.\n  \u201c[A]ll members of the Court agree[d]\u201d that the patent at\nissue in Bilski claimed an \u201cabstract idea.\u201d Id., at 609; see\nalso id., at 619 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).\nSpecifically, the claims described \u201cthe basic concept of\nhedging, or protecting against risk.\u201d Id., at 611. The\nCourt explained that \u201c \u2018[h]edging is a fundamental economic\npractice long prevalent in our system of commerce and\ntaught in any introductory finance class.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. \u201cThe\nconcept of hedging\u201d as recited by the claims in suit was\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntherefore a patent-ineligible \u201cabstract idea, just like the\nalgorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.\u201d Ibid.\n   It follows from our prior cases, and Bilski in particular,\nthat the claims at issue here are directed to an abstract\nidea. Petitioner\u2019s claims involve a method of exchanging\nfinancial obligations between two parties using a third-\nparty intermediary to mitigate settlement risk. The in-\ntermediary creates and updates \u201cshadow\u201d records to re-\nflect the value of each party\u2019s actual accounts held at\n\u201cexchange institutions,\u201d thereby permitting only those\ntransactions for which the parties have sufficient re-\nsources. At the end of each day, the intermediary issues\nirrevocable instructions to the exchange institutions to\ncarry out the permitted transactions.\n   On their face, the claims before us are drawn to the\nconcept of intermediated settlement, i.e., the use of a third\nparty to mitigate settlement risk. Like the risk hedging in\nBilski, the concept of intermediated settlement is \u201c \u2018a\nfundamental economic practice long prevalent in our\nsystem of commerce.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.; see, e.g., Emery, Speculation\non the Stock and Produce Exchanges of the United States,\nin 7 Studies in History, Economics and Public Law 283,\n346\u2013356 (1896) (discussing the use of a \u201cclearing-house\u201d as\nan intermediary to reduce settlement risk). The use of a\nthird-party intermediary (or \u201cclearing house\u201d) is also a\nbuilding block of the modern economy. See, e.g., Yadav,\nThe Problematic Case of Clearinghouses in Complex Mar-\nkets, 101 Geo. L. J. 387, 406\u2013412 (2013); J. Hull, Risk\nManagement and Financial Institutions 103\u2013104 (3d ed.\n2012). Thus, intermediated settlement, like hedging, is an\n\u201cabstract idea\u201d beyond the scope of \u00a7101.\n   Petitioner acknowledges that its claims describe inter-\nmediated settlement, see Brief for Petitioner 4, but rejects\nthe conclusion that its claims recite an \u201cabstract idea.\u201d\nDrawing on the presence of mathematical formulas in\nsome of our abstract-ideas precedents, petitioner contends\n10             ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the abstract-ideas category is confined to \u201cpreexist-\ning, fundamental truth[s]\u201d that \u201c \u2018exis[t ] in principle apart\nfrom any human action.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 23, 26 (quoting Mayo,\n566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8)).\n   Bilski belies petitioner\u2019s assertion. The concept of risk\nhedging we identified as an abstract idea in that case\ncannot be described as a \u201cpreexisting, fundamental truth.\u201d\nThe patent in Bilski simply involved a \u201cseries of steps\ninstructing how to hedge risk.\u201d 561 U. S., at 599. Al-\nthough hedging is a longstanding commercial practice, id.,\nat 599, it is a method of organizing human activity, not a\n\u201ctruth\u201d about the natural world \u201c \u2018that has always existed,\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 22 (quoting Flook, supra, at 593,\nn. 15). One of the claims in Bilski reduced hedging to a\nmathematical formula, but the Court did not assign any\nspecial significance to that fact, much less the sort of\ntalismanic significance petitioner claims. Instead, the\nCourt grounded its conclusion that all of the claims at\nissue were abstract ideas in the understanding that risk\nhedging was a \u201c \u2018fundamental economic practice.\u2019 \u201d 561\nU. S., at 611.\n   In any event, we need not labor to delimit the precise\ncontours of the \u201cabstract ideas\u201d category in this case. It is\nenough to recognize that there is no meaningful distinc-\ntion between the concept of risk hedging in Bilski and the\nconcept of intermediated settlement at issue here. Both\nare squarely within the realm of \u201cabstract ideas\u201d as we\nhave used that term.\n                             B\n   Because the claims at issue are directed to the abstract\nidea of intermediated settlement, we turn to the second\nstep in Mayo\u2019s framework. We conclude that the method\nclaims, which merely require generic computer implemen-\ntation, fail to transform that abstract idea into a patent-\neligible invention.\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n                                1\n   At Mayo step two, we must examine the elements of the\nclaim to determine whether it contains an \u201c \u2018inventive\nconcept\u2019 \u201d sufficient to \u201ctransform\u201d the claimed abstract\nidea into a patent-eligible application. 566 U. S., at ___,\n___ (slip op., at 3, 11). A claim that recites an abstract\nidea must include \u201cadditional features\u201d to ensure \u201cthat the\n[claim] is more than a drafting effort designed to monopo-\nlize the [abstract idea].\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8\u20139). Mayo\nmade clear that transformation into a patent-eligible\napplication requires \u201cmore than simply stat[ing] the [ab-\nstract idea] while adding the words \u2018apply it.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 3).\n   Mayo itself is instructive. The patents at issue in Mayo\nclaimed a method for measuring metabolites in the blood-\nstream in order to calibrate the appropriate dosage of\nthiopurine drugs in the treatment of autoimmune dis-\neases. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4\u20136). The respondent in that\ncase contended that the claimed method was a patent-\neligible application of natural laws that describe the rela-\ntionship between the concentration of certain metabolites\nand the likelihood that the drug dosage will be harmful or\nineffective. But methods for determining metabolite levels\nwere already \u201cwell known in the art,\u201d and the process at\nissue amounted to \u201cnothing significantly more than an\ninstruction to doctors to apply the applicable laws when\ntreating their patients.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n\u201cSimply appending conventional steps, specified at a high\nlevel of generality,\u201d was not \u201cenough\u201d to supply an \u201c \u2018in-\nventive concept.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___, ___, ___ (slip op., at 14, 8, 3).\n   The introduction of a computer into the claims does not\nalter the analysis at Mayo step two. In Benson, for exam-\nple, we considered a patent that claimed an algorithm\nimplemented on \u201ca general-purpose digital computer.\u201d 409\nU. S., at 64. Because the algorithm was an abstract idea,\nsee supra, at 8, the claim had to supply a \u201c \u2018new and use-\n12             ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nful\u2019 \u201d application of the idea in order to be patent eligible.\n409 U. S., at 67. But the computer implementation did\nnot supply the necessary inventive concept; the process\ncould be \u201ccarried out in existing computers long in use.\u201d\nIbid. We accordingly \u201cheld that simply implementing a\nmathematical principle on a physical machine, namely a\ncomputer, [i]s not a patentable application of that princi-\nple.\u201d Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (citing Benson,\nsupra, at 64).\n   Flook is to the same effect. There, we examined a com-\nputerized method for using a mathematical formula to\nadjust alarm limits for certain operating conditions (e.g.,\ntemperature and pressure) that could signal inefficiency or\ndanger in a catalytic conversion process. 437 U. S., at\n585\u2013586. Once again, the formula itself was an abstract\nidea, see supra, at 8, and the computer implementation\nwas purely conventional. 437 U. S., at 594 (noting that\nthe \u201cuse of computers for \u2018automatic monitoring-\nalarming\u2019 \u201d was \u201cwell known\u201d). In holding that the process\nwas patent ineligible, we rejected the argument that\n\u201cimplement[ing] a principle in some specific fashion\u201d will\n\u201cautomatically fal[l] within the patentable subject matter\nof \u00a7101.\u201d Id., at 593. Thus, \u201cFlook stands for the proposi-\ntion that the prohibition against patenting abstract ideas\ncannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of\n[the idea] to a particular technological environment.\u201d\nBilski, 561 U. S., at 610\u2013611 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   In Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, by contrast, we held that a\ncomputer-implemented process for curing rubber was\npatent eligible, but not because it involved a computer.\nThe claim employed a \u201cwell-known\u201d mathematical equa-\ntion, but it used that equation in a process designed to\nsolve a technological problem in \u201cconventional industry\npractice.\u201d Id., at 177, 178. The invention in Diehr used a\n\u201cthermocouple\u201d to record constant temperature measure-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nments inside the rubber mold\u2014something \u201cthe industry\nha[d] not been able to obtain.\u201d Id., at 178, and n. 3. The\ntemperature measurements were then fed into a computer,\nwhich repeatedly recalculated the remaining cure time\nby using the mathematical equation. Id., at 178\u2013179.\nThese additional steps, we recently explained, \u201ctrans-\nformed the process into an inventive application of the\nformula.\u201d Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12). In other\nwords, the claims in Diehr were patent eligible because\nthey improved an existing technological process, not be-\ncause they were implemented on a computer.\n  These cases demonstrate that the mere recitation of a\ngeneric computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible\nabstract idea into a patent-eligible invention. Stating an\nabstract idea \u201cwhile adding the words \u2018apply it\u2019 \u201d is not\nenough for patent eligibility. Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 3). Nor is limiting the use of an abstract idea \u201c \u2018to a\nparticular technological environment.\u2019 \u201d Bilski, supra, at\n610\u2013611. Stating an abstract idea while adding the words\n\u201capply it with a computer\u201d simply combines those two\nsteps, with the same deficient result. Thus, if a patent\u2019s\nrecitation of a computer amounts to a mere instruction to\n\u201cimplemen[t]\u201d an abstract idea \u201con . . . a computer,\u201d Mayo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 16), that addition cannot impart\npatent eligibility. This conclusion accords with the pre-\nemption concern that undergirds our \u00a7101 jurisprudence.\nGiven the ubiquity of computers, see 717 F. 3d, at 1286\n(Lourie, J., concurring), wholly generic computer imple-\nmentation is not generally the sort of \u201cadditional featur[e]\u201d\nthat provides any \u201cpractical assurance that the process is\nmore than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the\n[abstract idea] itself.\u201d Mayo, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8\u20139).\n  The fact that a computer \u201cnecessarily exist[s] in the\nphysical, rather than purely conceptual, realm,\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 39, is beside the point. There is no dispute that\n14             ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na computer is a tangible system (in \u00a7101 terms, a \u201cma-\nchine\u201d), or that many computer-implemented claims are\nformally addressed to patent-eligible subject matter. But\nif that were the end of the \u00a7101 inquiry, an applicant could\nclaim any principle of the physical or social sciences by\nreciting a computer system configured to implement the\nrelevant concept. Such a result would make the determi-\nnation of patent eligibility \u201cdepend simply on the drafts-\nman\u2019s art,\u201d Flook, supra, at 593, thereby eviscerating the\nrule that \u201c \u2018[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and\nabstract ideas are not patentable,\u2019 \u201d Myriad, 569 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 11).\n                              2\n   The representative method claim in this case recites the\nfollowing steps: (1) \u201ccreating\u201d shadow records for each\ncounterparty to a transaction; (2) \u201cobtaining\u201d start-of-day\nbalances based on the parties\u2019 real-world accounts at\nexchange institutions; (3) \u201cadjusting\u201d the shadow records\nas transactions are entered, allowing only those transac-\ntions for which the parties have sufficient resources; and\n(4) issuing irrevocable end-of-day instructions to the ex-\nchange institutions to carry out the permitted transac-\ntions. See n. 2, supra. Petitioner principally contends that\nthe claims are patent eligible because these steps \u201crequire\na substantial and meaningful role for the computer.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 48. As stipulated, the claimed method\nrequires the use of a computer to create electronic records,\ntrack multiple transactions, and issue simultaneous in-\nstructions; in other words, \u201c[t]he computer is itself the\nintermediary.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis deleted).\n   In light of the foregoing, see supra, at 11\u201314, the rele-\nvant question is whether the claims here do more than\nsimply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract\nidea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer.\nThey do not.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Taking the claim elements separately, the function\nperformed by the computer at each step of the process is\n\u201c[p]urely conventional.\u201d Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n10) (internal quotation marks omitted). Using a computer\nto create and maintain \u201cshadow\u201d accounts amounts to\nelectronic recordkeeping\u2014one of the most basic functions\nof a computer. See, e.g., Benson, 409 U. S., at 65 (noting\nthat a computer \u201coperates . . . upon both new and previ-\nously stored data\u201d). The same is true with respect to the\nuse of a computer to obtain data, adjust account balances,\nand issue automated instructions; all of these computer\nfunctions are \u201cwell-understood, routine, conventional\nactivit[ies]\u201d previously known to the industry. Mayo, 566\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). In short, each step does no\nmore than require a generic computer to perform generic\ncomputer functions.\n  Considered \u201cas an ordered combination,\u201d the computer\ncomponents of petitioner\u2019s method \u201cad[d] nothing . . . that\nis not already present when the steps are considered\nseparately.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). Viewed as a\nwhole, petitioner\u2019s method claims simply recite the concept\nof intermediated settlement as performed by a generic\ncomputer. See 717 F. 3d, at 1286 (Lourie, J., concurring)\n(noting that the representative method claim \u201clacks any\nexpress language to define the computer\u2019s participation\u201d).\nThe method claims do not, for example, purport to improve\nthe functioning of the computer itself. See ibid. (\u201cThere is\nno specific or limiting recitation of . . . improved computer\ntechnology . . . \u201d); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n28\u201330. Nor do they effect an improvement in any other\ntechnology or technical field. See, e.g., Diehr, 450 U. S., at\n177\u2013178. Instead, the claims at issue amount to \u201cnothing\nsignificantly more\u201d than an instruction to apply the ab-\nstract idea of intermediated settlement using some un-\nspecified, generic computer. Mayo, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10). Under our precedents, that is not \u201cenough\u201d to\n16             ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT\u2019L\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntransform an abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\n                              C\n  Petitioner\u2019s claims to a computer system and a computer-\nreadable medium fail for substantially the same rea-\nsons. Petitioner conceded below that its media claims rise\nor fall with its method claims. En Banc Response Brief for\nDefendant-Appellant in No. 11\u20131301 (CA Fed.) p. 50, n. 3.\nAs to its system claims, petitioner emphasizes that those\nclaims recite \u201cspecific hardware\u201d configured to perform\n\u201cspecific computerized functions.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 53.\nBut what petitioner characterizes as specific hardware\u2014a\n\u201cdata processing system\u201d with a \u201ccommunications control-\nler\u201d and \u201cdata storage unit,\u201d for example, see App. 954,\n958, 1257\u2014is purely functional and generic. Nearly every\ncomputer will include a \u201ccommunications controller\u201d and\n\u201cdata storage unit\u201d capable of performing the basic calcu-\nlation, storage, and transmission functions required by the\nmethod claims. See 717 F. 3d, at 1290 (Lourie, J., concur-\nring). As a result, none of the hardware recited by the\nsystem claims \u201coffers a meaningful limitation beyond\ngenerally linking \u2018the use of the [method] to a particular\ntechnological environment,\u2019 that is, implementation via\ncomputers.\u201d Id., at 1291 (quoting Bilski, 561 U. S., at\n610\u2013611).\n  Put another way, the system claims are no different\nfrom the method claims in substance. The method claims\nrecite the abstract idea implemented on a generic computer;\nthe system claims recite a handful of generic computer\ncomponents configured to implement the same idea. This\nCourt has long \u201cwarn[ed] . . . against\u201d interpreting \u00a7101\n\u201cin ways that make patent eligibility \u2018depend simply on\nthe draftsman\u2019s art.\u2019 \u201d Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3)\n(quoting Flook, 437 U. S., at 593); see id., at 590 (\u201cThe\nconcept of patentable subject matter under \u00a7101 is not\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Holding that the system claims are\npatent eligible would have exactly that result.\n   Because petitioner\u2019s system and media claims add noth-\ning of substance to the underlying abstract idea, we hold\nthat they too are patent ineligible under \u00a7101.\n                       *    *      *\n For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit is affirmed.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

As in Bilski, however, I further believe that the\nmethod claims at issue are drawn to an abstract idea. Cf.\n561 U. S., at 619 (opinion of Stevens, J.). I therefore join\nthe opinion of the Court.\n</pre>",
