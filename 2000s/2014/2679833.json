Argued April 1, 2014—Decided June 23, 2014\nA part of the federal bank fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. §1344(2), makes it\n  a crime to “knowingly execut[e] a scheme . . . to obtain” property\n  owned by, or under the custody of, a bank “by means of false or\n  fraudulent pretenses.” Petitioner Kevin Loughrin was charged with\n  bank fraud after he was caught forging stolen checks, using them to\n  buy goods at a Target store, and then returning the goods for cash.\n  The District Court declined to give Loughrin’s proposed jury instruc-\n  tion that a conviction under §1344(2) required proof of “intent to de-\n  fraud a financial institution.” The jury convicted Loughrin, and the\n  Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Section 1344(2) does not require the Government to prove that a\n defendant intended to defraud a financial institution. Pp. 4–15.\n    (a) Section 1344(2) requires only that the defendant intend to ob-\n tain bank property and that this end is accomplished “by means of” a\n false statement. No additional requirement of intent to defraud a\n bank appears in the statute’s text. And imposing that requirement\n would prevent §1344(2) from applying to cases falling within the\n statute’s clear terms, such as frauds directed against a third-party\n custodian of bank-owned property. Loughrin’s construction would al-\n so make §1344(2) a mere subset of §1344(1), which prohibits any\n scheme “to defraud a financial institution.” That view is untenable\n because those clauses are separated by the disjunctive “or,” signaling\n that each is intended to have separate meaning. And to read clause\n (1) as fully encompassing clause (2) contravenes two related interpre-\n tive canons: that different language signals different meaning, and\n that no part of a statute should be superfluous. Pp. 4–6.\n    (b) Loughrin claims that his view is supported by similar language\n in the federal mail fraud statute and by federalism principles, but his\n2                    LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    arguments are unpersuasive. Pp. 7–15.\n         (1) In McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, this Court inter-\n    preted similar language in the mail fraud statute, §1341—which\n    served as a model for §1344—to set forth just one offense, despite the\n    use of the word “or.” But the two statutes have notable textual dif-\n    ferences. The mail fraud law contains two phrases strung together in\n    a single, unbroken sentence, whereas §1344’s two clauses have sepa-\n    rate numbering, line breaks, and equivalent indentation—all indica-\n    tions of separate meaning. Moreover, Congress likely did not intend\n    to adopt McNally’s interpretation when it enacted §1344, because at\n    that time (three years before McNally) every Court of Appeals had in-\n    terpreted the word “or” in the mail fraud statute in its usual, disjunc-\n    tive sense. And while McNally found that unique features of the mail\n    fraud statute’s history supported its view, the legislative history sur-\n    rounding the adoption of §1344 points the other way. Pp. 7–9.\n         (2) Loughrin also contends that without an element of intent to\n    defraud a bank, §1344(2) would apply to every minor fraud in which\n    the victim happens to pay by check. This, he says, would unduly ex-\n    pand the reach of federal criminal law into an area traditionally left\n    to the States. But this argument ignores a significant textual limit\n    on §1344(2)’s reach: The criminal must acquire (or attempt to ac-\n    quire) the bank property “by means of” the misrepresentation. That\n    language limits §1344(2)’s application to cases (like this one) in which\n    the misrepresentation has some real connection to a federally insured\n    bank, and thus to the pertinent federal interest.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 23, 2014]\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A provision of the federal bank fraud statute, 18 U. S. C.\n§1344(2), makes criminal a knowing scheme to obtain\nproperty owned by, or in the custody of, a bank “by means\nof false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or prom-\nises.” The question presented is whether the Government\nmust prove that a defendant charged with violating that\nprovision intended to defraud a bank. We hold that the\nGovernment need not make that showing.\n                              I\n   Petitioner Kevin Loughrin executed a scheme to convert\naltered or forged checks into cash. Pretending to be a\nMormon missionary going door-to-door in a neighborhood\nin Salt Lake City, he rifled through residential mailboxes\nand stole any checks he found. Sometimes, he washed,\nbleached, ironed, and dried the checks to remove the\nexisting writing, and then filled them out as he wanted;\nother times, he did nothing more than cross out the name\nof the original payee and add another. And when he was\nlucky enough to stumble upon a blank check, he completed\nit and forged the accountholder’s signature. Over several\nmonths, Loughrin made out six of these checks to the\n2                     LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nretailer Target, for amounts of up to $250. His modus\noperandi was to go to a local store and, posing as the\naccountholder, present an altered check to a cashier to\npurchase merchandise. After the cashier accepted the\ncheck (which, remarkably enough, happened time after\ntime), Loughrin would leave the store, then turn around\nand walk back inside to return the goods for cash.\n  Each of the six checks that Loughrin presented to Tar-\nget was drawn on an account at a federally insured bank,\nincluding Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Employees\nin Target’s back office identified three of the checks as\nfraudulent, and so declined to submit them for payment.\nTarget deposited the other three checks. The bank refused\npayment on one, after the accountholder notified the bank\nthat she had seen a man steal her mail. Target appears to\nhave received payment for the other two checks, though\nthe record does not conclusively establish that fact. See\nBrief for United States 6, 7, n. 3.\n  The Federal Government eventually caught up with\nLoughrin and charged him with six counts of committing\nbank fraud—one for each of the altered checks presented\nto Target. The federal bank fraud statute, 18 U. S. C.\n§1344, provides as follows:\n         “Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute,\n         a scheme or artifice—\n           (1) to defraud a financial institution; or\n           (2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, as-\n           sets, securities, or other property owned by, or un-\n           der the custody or control of, a financial institution,\n           by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, represen-\n           tations, or promises;\n         shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned\n         not more than 30 years, or both.”1\n\n——————\n    1A   “financial institution,” as defined in 18 U. S. C. §20, includes a\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nRuling (for a reason not material here) that Circuit prece-\ndent precluded convicting Loughrin under the statute’s\nfirst clause, §1344(1), the District Court allowed the case\nto go to the jury on the statute’s second, §1344(2).\n   The court instructed the jury that it could convict\nLoughrin under that clause if, in offering the fraudulent\nchecks to Target, he had “knowingly executed or at-\ntempted to execute a scheme or artifice to obtain money or\nproperty from the [banks on which the checks were drawn]\nby means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations,\nor promises.” App. 7. Loughrin asked as well for another\ninstruction: The jury, he argued, must also find that he\nacted with “intent to defraud a financial institution.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 43a. The court, however, declined to give\nthat charge, and the jury convicted Loughrin on all six\ncounts.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Cir-\ncuit affirmed. See 710 F. 3d 1111 (2013). As relevant\nhere, it rejected Loughrin’s argument that “a conviction\nunder §1344(2) requires proof that he intended to defraud\nthe banks on which the [altered] checks had been drawn.”\nId., at 1115. That intent, the court reasoned, is necessary\nonly under the bank fraud law’s first clause. The court\nacknowledged that under its interpretation, §1344(2)\n“cast[s] a wide net for bank fraud liability,” but concluded\nthat such a result is “dictated by the plain language of the\nstatute.” Id., at 1117.\n   We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), to resolve a\nCircuit split on whether §1344(2) requires the Government\nto show that a defendant intended to defraud a federally\ninsured bank or other financial institution.2 We now\n——————\nfederally insured bank of the kind involved here.\n  2 Compare 710 F. 3d 1111, 1116 (CA10 2013) (case below) (§1344(2)\n\ndoes not require intent to defraud a bank); United States v. Everett, 270\nF. 3d 986, 991 (CA6 2001) (same), with United States v. Thomas, 315\nF. 3d 190, 197 (CA3 2002) (§1344(2) requires such intent); United\n4                  LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\naffirm the Tenth Circuit’s decision.\n                              II\n   We begin with common ground. All parties agree, as do\nwe and the Courts of Appeals, that §1344(2) requires that\na defendant “knowingly execute[ ], or attempt[ ] to exe-\ncute, a scheme or artifice” with at least two elements.\nFirst, the clause requires that the defendant intend “to\nobtain any of the moneys . . . or other property owned by,\nor under the custody or control of, a financial institution.”\n(We refer to that element, more briefly, as intent “to ob-\ntain bank property.”) Brief for United States 11, 17, 20,\n22, 32; Brief for Petitioner 30–31. And second, the clause\nrequires that the envisioned result—i.e., the obtaining of\nbank property—occur “by means of false or fraudulent\npretenses, representations, or promises.” See Brief for\nUnited States 21–22; Reply Brief 18–19. Loughrin does\nnot contest the jury instructions on either of those two\nelements. Nor does he properly challenge the sufficiency\nof the evidence supporting them here.3\n   The single question presented is whether the Govern-\nment must prove yet another element: that the defendant\n——————\nStates v. Kenrick, 221 F. 3d 19, 29 (CA1 2000) (same); United States v.\nJacobs, 117 F. 3d 82, 92–93 (CA2 1997) (same).\n   3 Loughrin argued to the jury that the evidence failed to show that he\n\nintended to obtain bank property: He claimed that once he “obtained\ncash from Target, . . . he was indifferent to whether Target ever sub-\nmitted the check to a bank or whether a bank ever made payment on\nit.” Brief for Petitioner 32; see Tr. 233–235; App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.\nThe jury rejected that contention, as did the District Court on a motion\nfor judgment of acquittal. See Record 168. In his appeal, Loughrin\nwaived the argument by conceding that if the District Court correctly\ninstructed the jury on §1344(2)’s elements, “then there was sufficient\nevidence to convict.” Appellant’s Opening Brief in No. 11–4158 (CA10),\np. 34. And although Loughrin’s briefs to this Court attempt to cast\ndoubt on the jury’s finding that he intended to obtain bank property,\nsee Brief for Petitioner 30–32, that issue is not “fairly included” in the\nquestion his certiorari petition presented, Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(a).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nintended to defraud a bank. As Loughrin describes it, that\nelement would compel the Government to show not just\nthat a defendant intended to obtain bank property (as the\njury here found), but also that he specifically intended to\ndeceive a bank. See Reply Brief 17. And that difference,\nLoughrin claims, would have mattered in this case, be-\ncause his intent to deceive ran only to Target, and not to\nany of the banks on which his altered checks were drawn.\n  But the text of §1344(2) precludes Loughrin’s argument.\nThat clause focuses, first, on the scheme’s goal (obtaining\nbank property) and, second, on the scheme’s means (a\nfalse representation). We will later address how the\n“means” component of §1344(2) imposes certain inherent\nlimits on its reach. See infra, at 11–14. But nothing in\nthe clause additionally demands that a defendant have a\nspecific intent to deceive a bank. And indeed, imposing\nthat requirement would prevent §1344(2) from applying to\na host of cases falling within its clear terms. In particular,\nthe clause covers property “owned by” the bank but in\nsomeone else’s custody and control (say, a home that the\nbank entrusted to a real estate company after foreclosure);\nthus, a person violates §1344(2)’s plain text by deceiving a\nnon-bank custodian into giving up bank property that it\nholds. Yet under Loughrin’s view, the clause would not\napply to such a case except in the (presumably rare) cir-\ncumstance in which the fraudster’s intent to deceive ex-\ntended beyond the custodian to the bank itself. His pro-\nposed inquiry would thus function as an extra-textual\nlimit on the clause’s compass.\n   And Loughrin’s construction of §1344(2) becomes yet\nmore untenable in light of the rest of the bank fraud stat-\nute. That is because the first clause of §1344, as all agree,\nincludes the requirement that a defendant intend to “de-\nfraud a financial institution”; indeed, that is §1344(1)’s\nwhole sum and substance. See Brief for United States 18;\nBrief for Petitioner 8. To read the next clause, following\n6                 LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe word “or,” as somehow repeating that requirement,\neven while using different words, is to disregard what “or”\ncustomarily means. As we have recognized, that term’s\n“ordinary use is almost always disjunctive, that is, the\nwords it connects are to be given separate meanings.”\nUnited States v. Woods, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,\nat 14). Yet Loughrin would have us construe the two\nentirely distinct statutory phrases that the word “or” joins\nas containing an identical element. And in doing so, his\ninterpretation would make §1344’s second clause a mere\nsubset of its first: If, that is, §1344(2) implicitly required\nintent to defraud a bank, it would apply only to conduct\nalready falling within §1344(1). Loughrin’s construction\nthus effectively reads “or” to mean “including”—a defini-\ntion foreign to any dictionary we know of.\n   As that account suggests, Loughrin’s view collides as\nwell with more general canons of statutory interpretation.\nWe have often noted that when “Congress includes partic-\nular language in one section of a statute but omits it in\nanother”—let alone in the very next provision—this Court\n“presume[s]” that Congress intended a difference in mean-\ning. Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(citation omitted). And here, as just stated, overriding\nthat presumption would render §1344’s second clause\nsuperfluous. Loughrin’s view thus runs afoul of the “car-\ndinal principle” of interpretation that courts “must give\neffect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.”\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 404 (2000) (citation\nomitted).4\n——————\n  4 Loughrin responds that our interpretation of the statute creates a\n\nconverse problem of superfluity: Clause (2), he says, would emerge so\nbroad as to wholly swallow Clause (1). See Reply Brief 7. But that is\nnot right. The Courts of Appeals, for example, have unanimously\nagreed that the Government can prosecute check kiting (i.e., writing\nchecks against an account with insufficient funds in a way designed to\nkeep them from bouncing) only under Clause (1), because such schemes\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014) \n                7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             III\n\n   Loughrin makes two principal arguments to avoid the\nimport of the statute’s plain text. First, he relies on this\nCourt’s construction of comparable language in the federal\nmail fraud statute to assert that Congress intended\n§1344(2) merely to explicate the scope of §1344(1)’s prohi-\nbition on scheming to defraud a bank, rather than to cover\nany additional conduct. And second, he contends that\nunless we read the second clause in that duplicative way,\nits coverage would extend to a vast range of fraudulent\nschemes, thus intruding on the historic criminal jurisdic-\ntion of the States. Neither argument is without force, but\nin the end, neither carries the day.\n                             A\n  “[D]espite appearances,” Loughrin avers, §1344(2) has\nno independent meaning: It merely specifies part of what\n§1344(1) already encompasses. Brief for Petitioner 8. To\nsupport that concededly counterintuitive argument,\nLoughrin invokes our decision in McNally v. United\nStates, 483 U. S. 350 (1987), interpreting similar language\nin the mail fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. §1341. That law,\nwhich served as a model for §1344, see Neder v. United\nStates, 527 U. S. 1, 20–21 (1999), prohibits using the mail\nto further “any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtain-\ning money or property by means of false or fraudulent\npretenses, representations, or promises.” Loughrin rightly\nexplains that, despite the word “or,” McNally understood\nthat provision as setting forth just one offense—using the\nmails to advance a scheme to defraud. The provision’s\n——————\ndo not involve any false representations. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46–47;\nsee, e.g., United States v. Doherty, 969 F. 2d 425, 427–428 (CA7 1992)\n(citing Williams v. United States, 458 U. S. 279, 284–285 (1982)). No\ndoubt, the overlap between the two clauses is substantial on our read-\ning, but that is not uncommon in criminal statutes. See, e.g., Hubbard\nv. United States, 514 U. S. 695, 714, n. 14 (1995).\n8               LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nback half, we held, merely codified a prior judicial decision\napplying the front half: In other words, the back clarified\nthat the front included certain conduct, rather than doing\nindependent work. 483 U. S., at 358–359. According to\nLoughrin, we should read the bank fraud statute in the\nsame way.\n   But the two statutes, as an initial matter, have notable\ntextual differences. The mail fraud law contains two\nphrases strung together in a single, unbroken sentence.\nBy contrast, §1344’s two clauses have separate numbers,\nline breaks before, between, and after them, and equiva-\nlent indentation—thus placing the clauses visually on an\nequal footing and indicating that they have separate\nmeanings. The legislative structure thus reinforces the\nusual (even if not McNally’s) understanding of the word\n“or” as meaning . . . well, “or”—rather than, as Loughrin\nwould have it, “including.”\n   Moreover, Loughrin’s reliance on McNally encounters a\nserious chronological problem. Congress passed the bank\nfraud statute in 1984, three years before we decided that\ncase. And at that time, every Court of Appeals to have\naddressed the issue had concluded that the two relevant\nphrases of the mail fraud law must be read “in the dis-\njunctive” and “construed independently.” 483 U. S., at 358\n(citing, e.g., United States v. Clapps, 732 F. 2d 1148, 1152\n(CA3 1984); United States v. States, 488 F. 2d 761, 764\n(CA8 1973)). McNally disagreed, eschewing the most\nnatural reading of the text in favor of evidence it found in\nthe drafting history of the statute’s money-or-property\nclause. But the Congress that passed the bank fraud\nstatute could hardly have predicted that McNally would\noverturn the lower courts’ uniform reading. We thus see\nno reason to doubt that in enacting §1344, Congress said\nwhat it meant and meant what it said, see Connecticut\nNat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 254 (1992)—i.e., that\nit both said “or” and meant “or” in the usual sense.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   And a peek at history, of the kind McNally found deci-\nsive, only cuts against Loughrin’s reading of the bank\nfraud statute. According to McNally, Congress added the\nmail fraud statute’s second, money-or-property clause\nmerely to affirm a decision of ours interpreting the ban on\nschemes “to defraud”: The second clause, McNally rea-\nsoned, thus worked no substantive change in the law. See\n483 U. S., at 356–359 (discussing Congress’s codification of\nDurland v. United States, 161 U. S. 306 (1896)). By con-\ntrast, Congress passed the bank fraud statute to disap-\nprove prior judicial rulings and thereby expand federal\ncriminal law’s scope—and indeed, partly to cover cases\nlike Loughrin’s. One of the decisions prompting enact-\nment of the bank fraud law, United States v. Maze, 414\nU. S. 395 (1974), involved a defendant who used a stolen\ncredit card to obtain food and lodging. (Substitute a check\nfor a credit card and Maze becomes Loughrin.) The Gov-\nernment brought charges of mail fraud, relying on post-\npurchase mailings between the merchants and issuing\nbank to satisfy the statute’s mailing element. But the\nCourt held those mailings insufficiently integral to the\nfraudulent scheme to support the conviction. See id., at\n402. Hence, Maze created a “serious gap[ ] . . . in Federal\njurisdiction over frauds against banks.” S. Rep. No. 98–\n225, p. 377 (1983). Congress passed §1344 to fill that gap,\nenabling the Federal Government to prosecute fraudsters\nlike Maze and Loughrin. We will not deprive that enact-\nment of its full effect because McNally relied on different\nhistory to adopt a counter-textual reading of a similar\nprovision.\n                            B\n  Loughrin also appeals to principles of federalism to\nsupport his proffered construction.     Unless we read\n§1344(2) as requiring intent to defraud a bank, Loughrin\ncontends, the provision will extend to every fraud, no\n10                 LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nmatter how prosaic, happening to involve payment with a\ncheck—even when that check is perfectly valid. Consider,\nfor example, a garden-variety con: A fraudster sells some-\nthing to a customer, misrepresenting its value. There are\ncountless variations, but let’s say the fraudster passes off\na cheap knock-off as a Louis Vuitton handbag. The victim\npays for the bag with a good check, which the criminal\ncashes. Voila!, Loughrin says, bank fraud has just hap-\npened—unless we adopt his narrowing construction. After\nall, the criminal has intended to “obtain . . . property . . .\nunder the custody or control of ” the bank (the money in\nthe victim’s checking account), and has made “false or\nfraudulent . . . representations” (the lies to the victim\nabout the handbag).5 But if the bank fraud statute were\nto encompass all such schemes, Loughrin continues, it\nwould interfere with matters “squarely within the tradi-\ntional criminal jurisdiction of the state courts.” Brief for\nPetitioner 29. We should avoid such a “sweeping expan-\nsion of federal criminal” law, he concludes, by reading\n§1344(2), just like §1344(1), as requiring intent to defraud\na bank. Reply Brief 3 (quoting Cleveland v. United States,\n531 U. S. 12, 24 (2000)).\n   We agree with this much of what Loughrin argues:\nUnless the text requires us to do so, we should not con-\nstrue §1344(2) as a plenary ban on fraud, contingent only\non use of a check (rather than cash). As we have often\n(and recently) repeated, “we will not be quick to assume\n——————\n  5 One might think the Federal Government would never use the bank\n\nfraud statute to prosecute such ordinary frauds just because they\nhappen to involve payment by check rather than cash. But in fact, the\nGovernment has brought a number of cases alleging violations of\n§1344(2) on that theory (so far, it appears, unsuccessfully). See, e.g.,\nThomas, 315 F. 3d 190 (a home health care worker got a valid check\nfrom a patient to buy groceries, but then cashed the check and pocketed\nthe money); United States v. Rodriguez, 140 F. 3d 163 (CA2 1998) (an\nemployee filed fake invoices with her employer, causing the company to\nissue valid checks to her friend for services never rendered).\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Congress has meant to effect a significant change in\nthe sensitive relation between federal and state criminal\njurisdiction.” Bond v. United States, 572 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 13) (quoting United States v. Bass, 404\nU. S. 336, 349 (1971)); see Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 24 (“We\nresist the Government’s reading . . . because it invites us\nto approve a sweeping expansion of federal criminal juris-\ndiction in the absence of a clear statement by Congress”);\nJones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 858 (2000) (similar).\nJust such a rebalancing of criminal jurisdiction would\nfollow from interpreting §1344(2) to cover every pedestrian\nswindle happening to involve payment by check, but in no\nother way affecting financial institutions. Indeed, even\nthe Government expresses some mild discomfort with\n“federalizing frauds that are only tangentially related to\nthe banking system.” Brief for United States 41.\n   But in claiming that we must therefore recognize an\ninvisible element, Loughrin fails to take account of a\nsignificant textual limitation on §1344(2)’s reach. Under\nthat clause, it is not enough that a fraudster scheme to\nobtain money from a bank and that he make a false\nstatement. The provision as well includes a relational\ncomponent: The criminal must acquire (or attempt to\nacquire) bank property “by means of ” the misrepresenta-\ntion. That phrase typically indicates that the given result\n(the “end”) is achieved, at least in part, through the speci-\nfied action, instrument, or method (the “means”), such\nthat the connection between the two is something more\nthan oblique, indirect, and incidental. See, e.g., Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 1399 (2002) (defining\n“by means of ” as “through the instrumentality of: by the\nuse of as a means”); 9 Oxford English Dictionary 516 (2d\ned. 1989) (defining “means” as “[a]n instrument, agency,\nmethod, or course of action, by the employment of which\nsome object is or may be attained, or which is concerned in\nbringing about some result”). In other words, not every\n12                LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbut-for cause will do. If, to pick an example out of a hat,\nJane traded in her car for money to take a bike trip cross-\ncountry, no one would say she “crossed the Rockies by\nmeans of a car,” even though her sale of the car somehow\nfigured in the trip she took. The relation between those\nthings would be (as the Government puts it) too “tangen-\ntial[ ]” to make use of the phrase at all appropriate. Brief\nfor United States 41.\n   Section 1344(2)’s “by means of ” language is satisfied\nwhen, as here, the defendant’s false statement is the\nmechanism naturally inducing a bank (or custodian of\nbank property) to part with money in its control. That\noccurs, most clearly, when a defendant makes a misrepre-\nsentation to the bank itself—say, when he attempts to\ncash, at the teller’s window, a forged or altered check. In\nthat event, the defendant seeks to obtain bank property by\nmeans of presenting the forgery directly to a bank em-\nployee. But no less is the counterfeit check the “means” of\nobtaining bank funds when a defendant like Loughrin\noffers it as payment to a third party like Target.6 After\nall, a merchant accepts a check only to pass it along to a\nbank for payment; and upon receipt from the merchant,\nthat check triggers the disbursement of bank funds just as\nif presented by the fraudster himself. So in either case,\nthe forged or altered check—i.e., the false statement—\nserves in the ordinary course as the means (or to use other\nwords, the mechanism or instrumentality) of obtaining\nbank property. To be sure, a merchant might detect the\n——————\n  6 The  Government in such a case may, of course, face the separate\nclaim that the defendant did not intend to obtain bank property at all:\nAs noted earlier, Loughrin argued this point to the jury, contending\n(unsuccessfully) that he merely wanted to get cash from Target. See\nn. 3, supra. All we say here, for the reasons next stated, is that when\nthe defendant has the requisite intent to acquire bank property, his\npresentation of a forged or altered check to a third party satisfies\n§1344(2)’s “means” requirement.\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

But that is to say only\nthat the defendant’s scheme to obtain bank property by\nmeans of a false statement may not succeed. And we have\nlong made clear that such failure is irrelevant in a bank\nfraud case, because §1344 punishes not “completed\nfrauds,” but instead fraudulent “scheme[s].” Neder, 527\nU. S., at 25.\n  By contrast, the cases Loughrin hopes will unnerve us—\nexemplified by the handbag swindle—do not satisfy\n§1344(2)’s “means” requirement.7 Recall that in such a\ncase the check is perfectly valid; so the check itself is not\n(as it was here) a false or fraudulent means of obtaining\nbank money. And the false pretense that has led, say, the\nhandbag buyer to give a check to the fraudster has noth-\ning to do with the bank that will cash it: No one would\ndream of passing on to the bank (as Target would forward\na forged check) the lie that a knock-off is a Louis Vuitton.\nThe bank’s involvement in the scheme is, indeed, wholly\nfortuitous—a function of the victim’s paying the fraudster\nby (valid) check rather than cash. Of course, the bank\nwould not have disbursed funds had the misrepresentation\nnever occurred, and in that sense, the lie counts as a but-\nfor cause of the bank’s payment. But as we have said,\n§1344(2)’s “by means of ” language requires more, see\nsupra, at 11–12: It demands that the defendant’s false\nstatement is the mechanism naturally inducing a bank (or\ncustodian) to part with its money. And in cases like the\nhandbag swindle, where no false statement will ever go to\na financial institution, the fraud is not the means of ob-\ntaining bank property.8\n——————\n  7 Even the Government, we note, acknowledges that §1344(2) is rea-\n\nsonably read to exclude such cases from its coverage. See Brief for\nUnited States 40–44; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43–47.\n  8 JUSTICE SCALIA takes issue with our limitation of §1344(2), contend-\n\ning first that the fraudster’s “indifferen[ce] to the victim’s method of\n14                 LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The premise of Loughrin’s federalism argument thus\ncollapses. He claims that we must import an unstated\nelement into §1344(2) to avoid covering run-of-the-mill\nfrauds, properly of concern only to States. But in fact, the\ntext of §1344(2) already limits its scope to deceptions that\nhave some real connection to a federally insured bank, and\nthus implicate the pertinent federal interest. See S. Rep.\nNo. 98–225, at 378 (noting that federal “jurisdiction is\nbased on the fact that the victim of the offense is a federally\n\n——————\npayment” does not “cause what is a means not to be a means.” Post, at\n2–3 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (emphasis\ndeleted). To illustrate the point, he offers an example: Someone “ob-\ntain[s] 7-Eleven coffee by means of [his] two dollars” even if he went to\n7-Eleven rather than Sheetz only because it happened to be the closest.\nPost, at 3. But that objection is based on a misunderstanding of our\nopinion. The “by means of” phrase calls for an inquiry into the direct-\nness of the relationship between means and ends, not the fraudster’s\nsubjective intent. (We take it JUSTICE SCALIA agrees; he recognizes that\n“not every but-for cause of an act is a cause ‘by means of’ which the act\nhas occurred.” Post, at 2.) And we concur with the bottom line of\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s example: There, the means (the two dollars) is the\nthing that achieves the specified end (getting the cup of 7-Eleven\ncoffee). By contrast, for the reasons elaborated above, the misstate-\nment in our handbag hypothetical is not the mechanism by which the\nfraudster obtains bank property, given that the lie will never reach the\nbank.\n  And so JUSTICE SCALIA tries another example, this one (involving\nLittle Bobby) contesting our view of directness. Post, at 3–4. But such\nhypotheticals mostly show that what relationships count as close\nenough to satisfy the phrase “by means of” will depend almost entirely\non context. (We might counter with some examples of our own, but we\nfear that would take us down an endless rabbit hole.) Language like\n“by means of” is inherently elastic: It does not mean one thing as to all\nfact patterns—and certainly not in all statutes, given differences in\ncontext and purpose. All we say here is that the phrase, as used in\n§1344(2), is best read, for the federalism-related reasons we have given,\nsee supra, at 9–11, as drawing a line at frauds that have some real\nconnection to a federally insured bank—namely, frauds in which a false\nstatement will naturally reach such a bank (or a custodian of the bank’s\nproperty).\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

And Loughrin’s own\ncrime, as we have explained, is one such scheme, because\nhe made false statements, in the form of forged and al-\ntered checks, that a merchant would, in the ordinary\ncourse of business, forward to a bank for payment. See\nsupra, at 12–13. We therefore reject Loughrin’s reading of\n§1344(2) and his challenge to his conviction.9\n  For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the\nTenth Circuit.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  9 As a last-gasp argument, Loughrin briefly asserts that §1344(2) at\nleast requires the Government to prove that the defendant’s scheme\ncreated a risk of financial loss to the bank. See Brief for Petitioner 36–\n40. But once again, nothing like that element appears in the clause's\ntext. Indeed, the broad language in §1344(2) describing the property at\nissue—“property owned by or under the custody or control of” a bank—\nappears calculated to avoid entangling courts in technical issues of\nbanking law about whether the financial institution or, alternatively, a\ndepositor would suffer the loss from a successful fraud. See United\nStates v. Nkansah, 699 F. 3d 743, 754 (CA2 2012) (Lynch, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment in part). And Loughrin’s argument\nfits poorly with our prior holding that the gravamen of §1344 is the\n“scheme,” rather than “the completed fraud,” and that the offense\ntherefore does not require “damage” or “reliance.” Neder v.

C. §1344(2). But I am\ndubitante on the point that one obtains bank property “by\nmeans of ” a fraudulent statement only if that statement is\n“the mechanism naturally inducing a bank (or custodian of\nbank property) to part with money in its control,” ante, at\n12. The Government suggested that test, but only briefly\nclaimed it was to be found in the “by means of ” language,\nBrief for United States 40–41—so briefly that Loughrin\nresponded that “[t]he Government does not claim any\ntextual basis for this [naturally inducing] rule,” Reply\nBrief 13. We have heard scant argument (nothing but the\nGovernment’s bare-bones assertion) in favor of the “by\nmeans of ” textual limitation, and no adversary presenta-\ntion whatever opposing it. The Court’s opinion raises the\nsubject in order to reply to Loughrin’s argument that,\nunless we adopt his proposed nontextual limitations, all\nfrauds effected by receipt of a check will become federal\ncrimes. It seems to me enough to say that Loughrin’s\nsolutions to the problem of the statute’s sweep are, for the\n2              LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nreasons well explained by the Court’s opinion, not correct.\nWhat the proper solution may be should in my view be left\nfor another day. I discuss below my difficulties with the\n“by means of ” solution.\n   Recall the Court’s hypothetical garden-variety con. “A\nfraudster [makes a statement] pass[ing] off a cheap knock-\noff as a Louis Vuitton handbag. The victim pays for the\nbag with a good check, which the criminal cashes.” Ante,\nat 10. The fraudster unquestionably has obtained bank\nproperty. But how? By presenting the check to a bank\nteller, yes. But also by duping the buyer. Yet according to\nthe Court, the fraudster’s deceit was not a “means” of\nobtaining the cash, because tricking a buyer into swapping\na check for a counterfeit carryall is not a “mechanism\nnaturally inducing a bank . . . to part with money in its\ncontrol.” Ante, at 12. The bank’s involvement, it says, is\nmere happenstance.\n   I do not know where the Court’s crabbed definition of\n“means” comes from. Certainly not the dictionary entries\nthat it quotes. Quite the contrary, those suggest that the\nhandbag fraudster’s deceitful statement was a “means”:\nUndoubtedly, the trickery was a “ ‘method, or course of\naction, by the employment of which [bank property was]\nattained.’ ” Ante, at 11. Though the dictionaries do not\nappear to add that the connection between “means” and\nend must be “something more than oblique, indirect, and\nincidental,” ibid., I agree that, in common usage, not every\nbut-for cause of an act is a cause “by means of ” which the\nact has occurred. No one would say, for example, that the\nhandbag fraudster obtained bank property by means of his\nancestors’ emigration to the United States. But all would\nsay, I think, that he obtained the property by means of the\nlie. His deceit is far from merely incidental to, or an\noblique or indirect way of, obtaining the money. That was\nthe lie’s very purpose.\n   That the fraudster likely was indifferent to the victim’s\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Indeed, saying\nthat indifference is disqualifying comes close to requiring\nthe intent to defraud a bank that the Court properly re-\njects. In any case, indifference certainly does not cause\nwhat is a means not to be a means. Suppose I resolve to\npurchase (with the two dollars in my billfold) a coffee at\nthe first convenience store I pass on my way to work. I am\nindifferent to what store that might be. I catch sight of a\n7-Eleven, pull in, and, with my cash, buy the drink. That\nit is a 7-Eleven coffee rather than a Sheetz coffee is “wholly\nfortuitous,” ibid. Still, no one would say that I had not\nobtained 7-Eleven coffee by means of my two dollars. So\ntoo with the handbag swindler: Regardless of whether the\ncash is the victim’s or, technically, the bank’s, and regard-\nless of whether the swindler cared which it was, would we\nnot say that the fraudster has obtained it by means of the\ntrick?\n   The majority responds that the measure of “means” is\nnot indifference or the absence of fortuity but rather di-\nrectness. And not just proximate-cause-like directness—\nthe fraudulent statement literally must “reach the bank,”\nante, at 14, n. 8. Once again, it seems to me the Court’s\ndefinition does not accord with common usage. Suppose\nlittle Bobby falsely tells his mother that he got an A on his\nweekly spelling test and so deserves an extra cookie after\ndinner. Mother will not be home for dinner, but she leaves\na note for Father: “Bobby gets an extra cookie after dinner\ntonight.” (Much like the handbag buyer’s note to the\nbank: “Pay $2,000 to the order of Mr. Handbag Fraud-\nster.”) Dinner wraps up, and Bobby gets his second cookie.\nHas he obtained it by means of the fib to his mother?\nPlainly yes, an ordinary English speaker would say. But\nplainly no under the Court’s definition, since the lie did\n4               LOUGHRIN v.

If “Jane traded in her car for\nmoney to take a bike trip cross-country, no one would say\nshe ‘crossed the Rockies by means of a car.’ ” Ante, at 12.\nOf course. By using two vehicles of conveyance, and de-\nscribing the end in question as “crossing the Rockies,” the\nstatement that the car was the “means” of achieving that\nend invites one to think that Jill traveled by automobile.\nBut the proper question—the one parallel to the question\nwhether the fraudster obtained bank funds by means of\nfraudulently selling the counterfeit—is not whether Jill\ncrossed the Rockies by means of the car, but whether she\nfunded her trip by means of selling the car. Which she\nassuredly did. Just as the handbag swindler, in the Louis\nVuitton example, obtained money by means of his false\nrepresentation.\n  I certainly agree that this statute must be interpreted, if\npossible, in a manner that will not make every fraud\neffected by receipt of a check a federal offense. But decid-\ning this case does not require us to identify that manner,\nand I would leave that for another case.\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

S. C.\n§1344(2) requires neither intent to defraud a bank nor the\ncreation of a risk of financial loss to a bank, but I must\nwrite separately to express disagreement with some dicta\nin the opinion of the Court.\n  In a few passages, the Court suggests that §1344(2)\nrequires a mens rea of purpose. See ante, at 4 (“[T]he\nclause requires that the defendant intend ‘to obtain any of\nthe moneys . . . or other property owned by, or under the\ncustody or control of, a financial institution’ ” (ellipsis in\noriginal)); ante, at 12, n. 6 (“[W]hen the defendant has the\nrequisite intent to acquire bank property, his presentation\nof a forged or altered check to a third party satisfies\n§1344(2)’s ‘means’ requirement”).* That is incorrect.\n  Congress expressly denoted the mens rea a defendant\nmust have to violate §1344(2), and it is not purpose.\nInstead, §1344(2) imposes liability on “[w]hoever knowingly\nexecutes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice” to\nobtain bank property. (Emphasis added.) It is hard to\nimagine how Congress could have been clearer as to the\nmental state required for liability.\n——————\n  * Cf. ante, at 5 (§1344(1) “includes the requirement that a defendant\nintend to ‘defraud a financial institution’ ”).\n2               LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n    The Court’s contrary statements apparently derive from\nthe fact that the criminal venture that a defendant must\nknowingly execute or attempt to execute must be a scheme\nor artifice “to obtain . . . property owned by . . . a financial\ninstitution.” §1344(2). A defendant must have the pur-\npose to obtain bank property, so the argument goes, be-\ncause he must execute a scheme the purpose of which is to\nobtain bank property.\n    This argument confuses the design of the scheme with\nthe mens rea of the defendant. The statute requires only\nthat the objective of the scheme must be the obtaining of\nbank property, not that the defendant must have such an\nobjective. Of course, in many cases a scheme’s objective\nwill be the same as an individual defendant’s. Where the\ndefendant acts alone, for instance, his objective will almost\ncertainly be the same as that of the scheme, and the in-\nquiry into the defendant’s mens rea and the scheme’s\nobjective will accordingly merge. But in some cases, such\nas those involving large, complex criminal ventures, a\ngiven defendant’s purpose may diverge from the scheme’s\nobjective. For instance, a defendant who is paid by a large\nring of check forgers to present one of their forged checks\nto a bank for payment has executed “a scheme or artifice\n. . . to obtain” bank property, even if he only presents the\ncheck because he is paid to do so and personally does not\ncare whether the forged check is honored. That is because\nthe objective of the scheme as a whole is to obtain bank\nproperty, and the defendant knowingly executes that\nscheme.\n    The majority reads the word “knowingly” out of the\nstatute.

Argued April 1, 2014—Decided June 23, 2014\nA part of the federal bank fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. §1344(2), makes it\n  a crime to “knowingly execut[e] a scheme . . . to obtain” property\n  owned by, or under the custody of, a bank “by means of false or\n  fraudulent pretenses.” Petitioner Kevin Loughrin was charged with\n  bank fraud after he was caught forging stolen checks, using them to\n  buy goods at a Target store, and then returning the goods for cash.\n  The District Court declined to give Loughrin’s proposed jury instruc-\n  tion that a conviction under §1344(2) required proof of “intent to de-\n  fraud a financial institution.” The jury convicted Loughrin, and the\n  Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Section 1344(2) does not require the Government to prove that a\n defendant intended to defraud a financial institution. Pp. 4–15.\n    (a) Section 1344(2) requires only that the defendant intend to ob-\n tain bank property and that this end is accomplished “by means of” a\n false statement. No additional requirement of intent to defraud a\n bank appears in the statute’s text. And imposing that requirement\n would prevent §1344(2) from applying to cases falling within the\n statute’s clear terms, such as frauds directed against a third-party\n custodian of bank-owned property. Loughrin’s construction would al-\n so make §1344(2) a mere subset of §1344(1), which prohibits any\n scheme “to defraud a financial institution.” That view is untenable\n because those clauses are separated by the disjunctive “or,” signaling\n that each is intended to have separate meaning. And to read clause\n (1) as fully encompassing clause (2) contravenes two related interpre-\n tive canons: that different language signals different meaning, and\n that no part of a statute should be superfluous. Pp. 4–6.\n    (b) Loughrin claims that his view is supported by similar language\n in the federal mail fraud statute and by federalism principles, but his\n2                    LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    arguments are unpersuasive. Pp. 7–15.\n         (1) In McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, this Court inter-\n    preted similar language in the mail fraud statute, §1341—which\n    served as a model for §1344—to set forth just one offense, despite the\n    use of the word “or.” But the two statutes have notable textual dif-\n    ferences. The mail fraud law contains two phrases strung together in\n    a single, unbroken sentence, whereas §1344’s two clauses have sepa-\n    rate numbering, line breaks, and equivalent indentation—all indica-\n    tions of separate meaning. Moreover, Congress likely did not intend\n    to adopt McNally’s interpretation when it enacted §1344, because at\n    that time (three years before McNally) every Court of Appeals had in-\n    terpreted the word “or” in the mail fraud statute in its usual, disjunc-\n    tive sense. And while McNally found that unique features of the mail\n    fraud statute’s history supported its view, the legislative history sur-\n    rounding the adoption of §1344 points the other way. Pp. 7–9.\n         (2) Loughrin also contends that without an element of intent to\n    defraud a bank, §1344(2) would apply to every minor fraud in which\n    the victim happens to pay by check. This, he says, would unduly ex-\n    pand the reach of federal criminal law into an area traditionally left\n    to the States. But this argument ignores a significant textual limit\n    on §1344(2)’s reach: The criminal must acquire (or attempt to ac-\n    quire) the bank property “by means of” the misrepresentation. That\n    language limits §1344(2)’s application to cases (like this one) in which\n    the misrepresentation has some real connection to a federally insured\n    bank, and thus to the pertinent federal interest.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 23, 2014]\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A provision of the federal bank fraud statute, 18 U. S. C.\n§1344(2), makes criminal a knowing scheme to obtain\nproperty owned by, or in the custody of, a bank “by means\nof false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or prom-\nises.” The question presented is whether the Government\nmust prove that a defendant charged with violating that\nprovision intended to defraud a bank. We hold that the\nGovernment need not make that showing.\n                              I\n   Petitioner Kevin Loughrin executed a scheme to convert\naltered or forged checks into cash. Pretending to be a\nMormon missionary going door-to-door in a neighborhood\nin Salt Lake City, he rifled through residential mailboxes\nand stole any checks he found. Sometimes, he washed,\nbleached, ironed, and dried the checks to remove the\nexisting writing, and then filled them out as he wanted;\nother times, he did nothing more than cross out the name\nof the original payee and add another. And when he was\nlucky enough to stumble upon a blank check, he completed\nit and forged the accountholder’s signature. Over several\nmonths, Loughrin made out six of these checks to the\n2                     LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nretailer Target, for amounts of up to $250. His modus\noperandi was to go to a local store and, posing as the\naccountholder, present an altered check to a cashier to\npurchase merchandise. After the cashier accepted the\ncheck (which, remarkably enough, happened time after\ntime), Loughrin would leave the store, then turn around\nand walk back inside to return the goods for cash.\n  Each of the six checks that Loughrin presented to Tar-\nget was drawn on an account at a federally insured bank,\nincluding Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Employees\nin Target’s back office identified three of the checks as\nfraudulent, and so declined to submit them for payment.\nTarget deposited the other three checks. The bank refused\npayment on one, after the accountholder notified the bank\nthat she had seen a man steal her mail. Target appears to\nhave received payment for the other two checks, though\nthe record does not conclusively establish that fact. See\nBrief for United States 6, 7, n. 3.\n  The Federal Government eventually caught up with\nLoughrin and charged him with six counts of committing\nbank fraud—one for each of the altered checks presented\nto Target. The federal bank fraud statute, 18 U. S. C.\n§1344, provides as follows:\n         “Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute,\n         a scheme or artifice—\n           (1) to defraud a financial institution; or\n           (2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, as-\n           sets, securities, or other property owned by, or un-\n           der the custody or control of, a financial institution,\n           by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, represen-\n           tations, or promises;\n         shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned\n         not more than 30 years, or both.”1\n\n——————\n    1A   “financial institution,” as defined in 18 U. S. C. §20, includes a\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Loughrin asked as well for another\ninstruction: The jury, he argued, must also find that he\nacted with “intent to defraud a financial institution.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 43a. The court, however, declined to give\nthat charge, and the jury convicted Loughrin on all six\ncounts.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Cir-\ncuit affirmed. See 710 F. 3d 1111 (2013). As relevant\nhere, it rejected Loughrin’s argument that “a conviction\nunder §1344(2) requires proof that he intended to defraud\nthe banks on which the [altered] checks had been drawn.”\nId., at 1115. That intent, the court reasoned, is necessary\nonly under the bank fraud law’s first clause. The court\nacknowledged that under its interpretation, §1344(2)\n“cast[s] a wide net for bank fraud liability,” but concluded\nthat such a result is “dictated by the plain language of the\nstatute.” Id., at 1117.\n   We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), to resolve a\nCircuit split on whether §1344(2) requires the Government\nto show that a defendant intended to defraud a federally\ninsured bank or other financial institution.2 We now\n——————\nfederally insured bank of the kind involved here.\n  2 Compare 710 F. 3d 1111, 1116 (CA10 2013) (case below) (§1344(2)\n\ndoes not require intent to defraud a bank); United States v. Everett, 270\nF. 3d 986, 991 (CA6 2001) (same), with United States v. Thomas, 315\nF. 3d 190, 197 (CA3 2002) (§1344(2) requires such intent); United\n4                  LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\naffirm the Tenth Circuit’s decision.\n                              II\n   We begin with common ground. All parties agree, as do\nwe and the Courts of Appeals, that §1344(2) requires that\na defendant “knowingly execute[ ], or attempt[ ] to exe-\ncute, a scheme or artifice” with at least two elements.\nFirst, the clause requires that the defendant intend “to\nobtain any of the moneys . . . or other property owned by,\nor under the custody or control of, a financial institution.”\n(We refer to that element, more briefly, as intent “to ob-\ntain bank property.”) Brief for United States 11, 17, 20,\n22, 32; Brief for Petitioner 30–31. And second, the clause\nrequires that the envisioned result—i.e., the obtaining of\nbank property—occur “by means of false or fraudulent\npretenses, representations, or promises.” See Brief for\nUnited States 21–22; Reply Brief 18–19. Loughrin does\nnot contest the jury instructions on either of those two\nelements. Nor does he properly challenge the sufficiency\nof the evidence supporting them here.3\n   The single question presented is whether the Govern-\nment must prove yet another element: that the defendant\n——————\nStates v. Kenrick, 221 F. 3d 19, 29 (CA1 2000) (same); United States v.\nJacobs, 117 F. 3d 82, 92–93 (CA2 1997) (same).\n   3 Loughrin argued to the jury that the evidence failed to show that he\n\nintended to obtain bank property: He claimed that once he “obtained\ncash from Target, . . . he was indifferent to whether Target ever sub-\nmitted the check to a bank or whether a bank ever made payment on\nit.” Brief for Petitioner 32; see Tr. 233–235; App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.\nThe jury rejected that contention, as did the District Court on a motion\nfor judgment of acquittal. See Record 168. In his appeal, Loughrin\nwaived the argument by conceding that if the District Court correctly\ninstructed the jury on §1344(2)’s elements, “then there was sufficient\nevidence to convict.” Appellant’s Opening Brief in No. 11–4158 (CA10),\np. 34. And although Loughrin’s briefs to this Court attempt to cast\ndoubt on the jury’s finding that he intended to obtain bank property,\nsee Brief for Petitioner 30–32, that issue is not “fairly included” in the\nquestion his certiorari petition presented, Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(a).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nintended to defraud a bank. As Loughrin describes it, that\nelement would compel the Government to show not just\nthat a defendant intended to obtain bank property (as the\njury here found), but also that he specifically intended to\ndeceive a bank. See Reply Brief 17. And that difference,\nLoughrin claims, would have mattered in this case, be-\ncause his intent to deceive ran only to Target, and not to\nany of the banks on which his altered checks were drawn.\n  But the text of §1344(2) precludes Loughrin’s argument.\nThat clause focuses, first, on the scheme’s goal (obtaining\nbank property) and, second, on the scheme’s means (a\nfalse representation). We will later address how the\n“means” component of §1344(2) imposes certain inherent\nlimits on its reach. See infra, at 11–14. But nothing in\nthe clause additionally demands that a defendant have a\nspecific intent to deceive a bank. And indeed, imposing\nthat requirement would prevent §1344(2) from applying to\na host of cases falling within its clear terms. In particular,\nthe clause covers property “owned by” the bank but in\nsomeone else’s custody and control (say, a home that the\nbank entrusted to a real estate company after foreclosure);\nthus, a person violates §1344(2)’s plain text by deceiving a\nnon-bank custodian into giving up bank property that it\nholds. Yet under Loughrin’s view, the clause would not\napply to such a case except in the (presumably rare) cir-\ncumstance in which the fraudster’s intent to deceive ex-\ntended beyond the custodian to the bank itself. His pro-\nposed inquiry would thus function as an extra-textual\nlimit on the clause’s compass.\n   And Loughrin’s construction of §1344(2) becomes yet\nmore untenable in light of the rest of the bank fraud stat-\nute. That is because the first clause of §1344, as all agree,\nincludes the requirement that a defendant intend to “de-\nfraud a financial institution”; indeed, that is §1344(1)’s\nwhole sum and substance. See Brief for United States 18;\nBrief for Petitioner 8. To read the next clause, following\n6                 LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe word “or,” as somehow repeating that requirement,\neven while using different words, is to disregard what “or”\ncustomarily means. As we have recognized, that term’s\n“ordinary use is almost always disjunctive, that is, the\nwords it connects are to be given separate meanings.”\nUnited States v. Woods, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,\nat 14). Yet Loughrin would have us construe the two\nentirely distinct statutory phrases that the word “or” joins\nas containing an identical element. And in doing so, his\ninterpretation would make §1344’s second clause a mere\nsubset of its first: If, that is, §1344(2) implicitly required\nintent to defraud a bank, it would apply only to conduct\nalready falling within §1344(1). Loughrin’s construction\nthus effectively reads “or” to mean “including”—a defini-\ntion foreign to any dictionary we know of.\n   As that account suggests, Loughrin’s view collides as\nwell with more general canons of statutory interpretation.\nWe have often noted that when “Congress includes partic-\nular language in one section of a statute but omits it in\nanother”—let alone in the very next provision—this Court\n“presume[s]” that Congress intended a difference in mean-\ning. Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(citation omitted). And here, as just stated, overriding\nthat presumption would render §1344’s second clause\nsuperfluous. Loughrin’s view thus runs afoul of the “car-\ndinal principle” of interpretation that courts “must give\neffect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.”\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 404 (2000) (citation\nomitted).4\n——————\n  4 Loughrin responds that our interpretation of the statute creates a\n\nconverse problem of superfluity: Clause (2), he says, would emerge so\nbroad as to wholly swallow Clause (1). See Reply Brief 7. But that is\nnot right. The Courts of Appeals, for example, have unanimously\nagreed that the Government can prosecute check kiting (i.e., writing\nchecks against an account with insufficient funds in a way designed to\nkeep them from bouncing) only under Clause (1), because such schemes\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014) \n                7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             III\n\n   Loughrin makes two principal arguments to avoid the\nimport of the statute’s plain text. First, he relies on this\nCourt’s construction of comparable language in the federal\nmail fraud statute to assert that Congress intended\n§1344(2) merely to explicate the scope of §1344(1)’s prohi-\nbition on scheming to defraud a bank, rather than to cover\nany additional conduct. And second, he contends that\nunless we read the second clause in that duplicative way,\nits coverage would extend to a vast range of fraudulent\nschemes, thus intruding on the historic criminal jurisdic-\ntion of the States. Neither argument is without force, but\nin the end, neither carries the day.\n                             A\n  “[D]espite appearances,” Loughrin avers, §1344(2) has\nno independent meaning: It merely specifies part of what\n§1344(1) already encompasses. Brief for Petitioner 8. To\nsupport that concededly counterintuitive argument,\nLoughrin invokes our decision in McNally v. United\nStates, 483 U. S. 350 (1987), interpreting similar language\nin the mail fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. §1341. That law,\nwhich served as a model for §1344, see Neder v. United\nStates, 527 U. S. 1, 20–21 (1999), prohibits using the mail\nto further “any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtain-\ning money or property by means of false or fraudulent\npretenses, representations, or promises.” Loughrin rightly\nexplains that, despite the word “or,” McNally understood\nthat provision as setting forth just one offense—using the\nmails to advance a scheme to defraud. The provision’s\n——————\ndo not involve any false representations. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46–47;\nsee, e.g., United States v. Doherty, 969 F. 2d 425, 427–428 (CA7 1992)\n(citing Williams v. United States, 458 U. S. 279, 284–285 (1982)). No\ndoubt, the overlap between the two clauses is substantial on our read-\ning, but that is not uncommon in criminal statutes. See, e.g., Hubbard\nv. United States, 514 U. S. 695, 714, n. 14 (1995).\n8               LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nback half, we held, merely codified a prior judicial decision\napplying the front half: In other words, the back clarified\nthat the front included certain conduct, rather than doing\nindependent work. 483 U. S., at 358–359. According to\nLoughrin, we should read the bank fraud statute in the\nsame way.\n   But the two statutes, as an initial matter, have notable\ntextual differences. The mail fraud law contains two\nphrases strung together in a single, unbroken sentence.\nBy contrast, §1344’s two clauses have separate numbers,\nline breaks before, between, and after them, and equiva-\nlent indentation—thus placing the clauses visually on an\nequal footing and indicating that they have separate\nmeanings. The legislative structure thus reinforces the\nusual (even if not McNally’s) understanding of the word\n“or” as meaning . . . well, “or”—rather than, as Loughrin\nwould have it, “including.”\n   Moreover, Loughrin’s reliance on McNally encounters a\nserious chronological problem. Congress passed the bank\nfraud statute in 1984, three years before we decided that\ncase. And at that time, every Court of Appeals to have\naddressed the issue had concluded that the two relevant\nphrases of the mail fraud law must be read “in the dis-\njunctive” and “construed independently.” 483 U. S., at 358\n(citing, e.g., United States v. Clapps, 732 F. 2d 1148, 1152\n(CA3 1984); United States v. States, 488 F. 2d 761, 764\n(CA8 1973)). McNally disagreed, eschewing the most\nnatural reading of the text in favor of evidence it found in\nthe drafting history of the statute’s money-or-property\nclause. But the Congress that passed the bank fraud\nstatute could hardly have predicted that McNally would\noverturn the lower courts’ uniform reading. We thus see\nno reason to doubt that in enacting §1344, Congress said\nwhat it meant and meant what it said, see Connecticut\nNat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 254 (1992)—i.e., that\nit both said “or” and meant “or” in the usual sense.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

According to McNally, Congress added the\nmail fraud statute’s second, money-or-property clause\nmerely to affirm a decision of ours interpreting the ban on\nschemes “to defraud”: The second clause, McNally rea-\nsoned, thus worked no substantive change in the law. See\n483 U. S., at 356–359 (discussing Congress’s codification of\nDurland v. United States, 161 U. S. 306 (1896)). By con-\ntrast, Congress passed the bank fraud statute to disap-\nprove prior judicial rulings and thereby expand federal\ncriminal law’s scope—and indeed, partly to cover cases\nlike Loughrin’s. One of the decisions prompting enact-\nment of the bank fraud law, United States v. Maze, 414\nU. S. 395 (1974), involved a defendant who used a stolen\ncredit card to obtain food and lodging. (Substitute a check\nfor a credit card and Maze becomes Loughrin.) The Gov-\nernment brought charges of mail fraud, relying on post-\npurchase mailings between the merchants and issuing\nbank to satisfy the statute’s mailing element. But the\nCourt held those mailings insufficiently integral to the\nfraudulent scheme to support the conviction. See id., at\n402. Hence, Maze created a “serious gap[ ] . . . in Federal\njurisdiction over frauds against banks.” S. Rep. No. 98–\n225, p. 377 (1983). Congress passed §1344 to fill that gap,\nenabling the Federal Government to prosecute fraudsters\nlike Maze and Loughrin. We will not deprive that enact-\nment of its full effect because McNally relied on different\nhistory to adopt a counter-textual reading of a similar\nprovision.\n                            B\n  Loughrin also appeals to principles of federalism to\nsupport his proffered construction.     Unless we read\n§1344(2) as requiring intent to defraud a bank, Loughrin\ncontends, the provision will extend to every fraud, no\n10                 LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nmatter how prosaic, happening to involve payment with a\ncheck—even when that check is perfectly valid. Consider,\nfor example, a garden-variety con: A fraudster sells some-\nthing to a customer, misrepresenting its value. There are\ncountless variations, but let’s say the fraudster passes off\na cheap knock-off as a Louis Vuitton handbag. The victim\npays for the bag with a good check, which the criminal\ncashes. Voila!, Loughrin says, bank fraud has just hap-\npened—unless we adopt his narrowing construction. After\nall, the criminal has intended to “obtain . . . property . . .\nunder the custody or control of ” the bank (the money in\nthe victim’s checking account), and has made “false or\nfraudulent . . . representations” (the lies to the victim\nabout the handbag).5 But if the bank fraud statute were\nto encompass all such schemes, Loughrin continues, it\nwould interfere with matters “squarely within the tradi-\ntional criminal jurisdiction of the state courts.” Brief for\nPetitioner 29. We should avoid such a “sweeping expan-\nsion of federal criminal” law, he concludes, by reading\n§1344(2), just like §1344(1), as requiring intent to defraud\na bank. Reply Brief 3 (quoting Cleveland v. United States,\n531 U. S. 12, 24 (2000)).\n   We agree with this much of what Loughrin argues:\nUnless the text requires us to do so, we should not con-\nstrue §1344(2) as a plenary ban on fraud, contingent only\non use of a check (rather than cash). As we have often\n(and recently) repeated, “we will not be quick to assume\n——————\n  5 One might think the Federal Government would never use the bank\n\nfraud statute to prosecute such ordinary frauds just because they\nhappen to involve payment by check rather than cash. But in fact, the\nGovernment has brought a number of cases alleging violations of\n§1344(2) on that theory (so far, it appears, unsuccessfully). See, e.g.,\nThomas, 315 F. 3d 190 (a home health care worker got a valid check\nfrom a patient to buy groceries, but then cashed the check and pocketed\nthe money); United States v. Rodriguez, 140 F. 3d 163 (CA2 1998) (an\nemployee filed fake invoices with her employer, causing the company to\nissue valid checks to her friend for services never rendered).\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Congress has meant to effect a significant change in\nthe sensitive relation between federal and state criminal\njurisdiction.” Bond v. United States, 572 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 13) (quoting United States v. Bass, 404\nU. S. 336, 349 (1971)); see Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 24 (“We\nresist the Government’s reading . . . because it invites us\nto approve a sweeping expansion of federal criminal juris-\ndiction in the absence of a clear statement by Congress”);\nJones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 858 (2000) (similar).\nJust such a rebalancing of criminal jurisdiction would\nfollow from interpreting §1344(2) to cover every pedestrian\nswindle happening to involve payment by check, but in no\nother way affecting financial institutions. Indeed, even\nthe Government expresses some mild discomfort with\n“federalizing frauds that are only tangentially related to\nthe banking system.” Brief for United States 41.\n   But in claiming that we must therefore recognize an\ninvisible element, Loughrin fails to take account of a\nsignificant textual limitation on §1344(2)’s reach. Under\nthat clause, it is not enough that a fraudster scheme to\nobtain money from a bank and that he make a false\nstatement. The provision as well includes a relational\ncomponent: The criminal must acquire (or attempt to\nacquire) bank property “by means of ” the misrepresenta-\ntion. That phrase typically indicates that the given result\n(the “end”) is achieved, at least in part, through the speci-\nfied action, instrument, or method (the “means”), such\nthat the connection between the two is something more\nthan oblique, indirect, and incidental. See, e.g., Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 1399 (2002) (defining\n“by means of ” as “through the instrumentality of: by the\nuse of as a means”); 9 Oxford English Dictionary 516 (2d\ned. 1989) (defining “means” as “[a]n instrument, agency,\nmethod, or course of action, by the employment of which\nsome object is or may be attained, or which is concerned in\nbringing about some result”). In other words, not every\n12                LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbut-for cause will do. If, to pick an example out of a hat,\nJane traded in her car for money to take a bike trip cross-\ncountry, no one would say she “crossed the Rockies by\nmeans of a car,” even though her sale of the car somehow\nfigured in the trip she took. The relation between those\nthings would be (as the Government puts it) too “tangen-\ntial[ ]” to make use of the phrase at all appropriate. Brief\nfor United States 41.\n   Section 1344(2)’s “by means of ” language is satisfied\nwhen, as here, the defendant’s false statement is the\nmechanism naturally inducing a bank (or custodian of\nbank property) to part with money in its control. That\noccurs, most clearly, when a defendant makes a misrepre-\nsentation to the bank itself—say, when he attempts to\ncash, at the teller’s window, a forged or altered check. In\nthat event, the defendant seeks to obtain bank property by\nmeans of presenting the forgery directly to a bank em-\nployee. But no less is the counterfeit check the “means” of\nobtaining bank funds when a defendant like Loughrin\noffers it as payment to a third party like Target.6 After\nall, a merchant accepts a check only to pass it along to a\nbank for payment; and upon receipt from the merchant,\nthat check triggers the disbursement of bank funds just as\nif presented by the fraudster himself. So in either case,\nthe forged or altered check—i.e., the false statement—\nserves in the ordinary course as the means (or to use other\nwords, the mechanism or instrumentality) of obtaining\nbank property. To be sure, a merchant might detect the\n——————\n  6 The  Government in such a case may, of course, face the separate\nclaim that the defendant did not intend to obtain bank property at all:\nAs noted earlier, Loughrin argued this point to the jury, contending\n(unsuccessfully) that he merely wanted to get cash from Target. See\nn. 3, supra. All we say here, for the reasons next stated, is that when\nthe defendant has the requisite intent to acquire bank property, his\npresentation of a forged or altered check to a third party satisfies\n§1344(2)’s “means” requirement.\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

But that is to say only\nthat the defendant’s scheme to obtain bank property by\nmeans of a false statement may not succeed. And we have\nlong made clear that such failure is irrelevant in a bank\nfraud case, because §1344 punishes not “completed\nfrauds,” but instead fraudulent “scheme[s].” Neder, 527\nU. S., at 25.\n  By contrast, the cases Loughrin hopes will unnerve us—\nexemplified by the handbag swindle—do not satisfy\n§1344(2)’s “means” requirement.7 Recall that in such a\ncase the check is perfectly valid; so the check itself is not\n(as it was here) a false or fraudulent means of obtaining\nbank money. And the false pretense that has led, say, the\nhandbag buyer to give a check to the fraudster has noth-\ning to do with the bank that will cash it: No one would\ndream of passing on to the bank (as Target would forward\na forged check) the lie that a knock-off is a Louis Vuitton.\nThe bank’s involvement in the scheme is, indeed, wholly\nfortuitous—a function of the victim’s paying the fraudster\nby (valid) check rather than cash. Of course, the bank\nwould not have disbursed funds had the misrepresentation\nnever occurred, and in that sense, the lie counts as a but-\nfor cause of the bank’s payment. But as we have said,\n§1344(2)’s “by means of ” language requires more, see\nsupra, at 11–12: It demands that the defendant’s false\nstatement is the mechanism naturally inducing a bank (or\ncustodian) to part with its money. And in cases like the\nhandbag swindle, where no false statement will ever go to\na financial institution, the fraud is not the means of ob-\ntaining bank property.8\n——————\n  7 Even the Government, we note, acknowledges that §1344(2) is rea-\n\nsonably read to exclude such cases from its coverage. See Brief for\nUnited States 40–44; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43–47.\n  8 JUSTICE SCALIA takes issue with our limitation of §1344(2), contend-\n\ning first that the fraudster’s “indifferen[ce] to the victim’s method of\n14                 LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The premise of Loughrin’s federalism argument thus\ncollapses. He claims that we must import an unstated\nelement into §1344(2) to avoid covering run-of-the-mill\nfrauds, properly of concern only to States. But in fact, the\ntext of §1344(2) already limits its scope to deceptions that\nhave some real connection to a federally insured bank, and\nthus implicate the pertinent federal interest. See S. Rep.\nNo. 98–225, at 378 (noting that federal “jurisdiction is\nbased on the fact that the victim of the offense is a federally\n\n——————\npayment” does not “cause what is a means not to be a means.” Post, at\n2–3 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (emphasis\ndeleted). To illustrate the point, he offers an example: Someone “ob-\ntain[s] 7-Eleven coffee by means of [his] two dollars” even if he went to\n7-Eleven rather than Sheetz only because it happened to be the closest.\nPost, at 3. But that objection is based on a misunderstanding of our\nopinion. The “by means of” phrase calls for an inquiry into the direct-\nness of the relationship between means and ends, not the fraudster’s\nsubjective intent. (We take it JUSTICE SCALIA agrees; he recognizes that\n“not every but-for cause of an act is a cause ‘by means of’ which the act\nhas occurred.” Post, at 2.) And we concur with the bottom line of\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s example: There, the means (the two dollars) is the\nthing that achieves the specified end (getting the cup of 7-Eleven\ncoffee). By contrast, for the reasons elaborated above, the misstate-\nment in our handbag hypothetical is not the mechanism by which the\nfraudster obtains bank property, given that the lie will never reach the\nbank.\n  And so JUSTICE SCALIA tries another example, this one (involving\nLittle Bobby) contesting our view of directness. Post, at 3–4. But such\nhypotheticals mostly show that what relationships count as close\nenough to satisfy the phrase “by means of” will depend almost entirely\non context. (We might counter with some examples of our own, but we\nfear that would take us down an endless rabbit hole.) Language like\n“by means of” is inherently elastic: It does not mean one thing as to all\nfact patterns—and certainly not in all statutes, given differences in\ncontext and purpose. All we say here is that the phrase, as used in\n§1344(2), is best read, for the federalism-related reasons we have given,\nsee supra, at 9–11, as drawing a line at frauds that have some real\nconnection to a federally insured bank—namely, frauds in which a false\nstatement will naturally reach such a bank (or a custodian of the bank’s\nproperty).\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

And Loughrin’s own\ncrime, as we have explained, is one such scheme, because\nhe made false statements, in the form of forged and al-\ntered checks, that a merchant would, in the ordinary\ncourse of business, forward to a bank for payment. See\nsupra, at 12–13. We therefore reject Loughrin’s reading of\n§1344(2) and his challenge to his conviction.9\n  For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the\nTenth Circuit.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  9 As a last-gasp argument, Loughrin briefly asserts that §1344(2) at\nleast requires the Government to prove that the defendant’s scheme\ncreated a risk of financial loss to the bank. See Brief for Petitioner 36–\n40. But once again, nothing like that element appears in the clause's\ntext. Indeed, the broad language in §1344(2) describing the property at\nissue—“property owned by or under the custody or control of” a bank—\nappears calculated to avoid entangling courts in technical issues of\nbanking law about whether the financial institution or, alternatively, a\ndepositor would suffer the loss from a successful fraud. See United\nStates v. Nkansah, 699 F. 3d 743, 754 (CA2 2012) (Lynch, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment in part). And Loughrin’s argument\nfits poorly with our prior holding that the gravamen of §1344 is the\n“scheme,” rather than “the completed fraud,” and that the offense\ntherefore does not require “damage” or “reliance.” Neder v.

But I am\ndubitante on the point that one obtains bank property “by\nmeans of ” a fraudulent statement only if that statement is\n“the mechanism naturally inducing a bank (or custodian of\nbank property) to part with money in its control,” ante, at\n12. The Government suggested that test, but only briefly\nclaimed it was to be found in the “by means of ” language,\nBrief for United States 40–41—so briefly that Loughrin\nresponded that “[t]he Government does not claim any\ntextual basis for this [naturally inducing] rule,” Reply\nBrief 13. We have heard scant argument (nothing but the\nGovernment’s bare-bones assertion) in favor of the “by\nmeans of ” textual limitation, and no adversary presenta-\ntion whatever opposing it. The Court’s opinion raises the\nsubject in order to reply to Loughrin’s argument that,\nunless we adopt his proposed nontextual limitations, all\nfrauds effected by receipt of a check will become federal\ncrimes. It seems to me enough to say that Loughrin’s\nsolutions to the problem of the statute’s sweep are, for the\n2              LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nreasons well explained by the Court’s opinion, not correct.\nWhat the proper solution may be should in my view be left\nfor another day. I discuss below my difficulties with the\n“by means of ” solution.\n   Recall the Court’s hypothetical garden-variety con. “A\nfraudster [makes a statement] pass[ing] off a cheap knock-\noff as a Louis Vuitton handbag. The victim pays for the\nbag with a good check, which the criminal cashes.” Ante,\nat 10. The fraudster unquestionably has obtained bank\nproperty. But how? By presenting the check to a bank\nteller, yes. But also by duping the buyer. Yet according to\nthe Court, the fraudster’s deceit was not a “means” of\nobtaining the cash, because tricking a buyer into swapping\na check for a counterfeit carryall is not a “mechanism\nnaturally inducing a bank . . . to part with money in its\ncontrol.” Ante, at 12. The bank’s involvement, it says, is\nmere happenstance.\n   I do not know where the Court’s crabbed definition of\n“means” comes from. Certainly not the dictionary entries\nthat it quotes. Quite the contrary, those suggest that the\nhandbag fraudster’s deceitful statement was a “means”:\nUndoubtedly, the trickery was a “ ‘method, or course of\naction, by the employment of which [bank property was]\nattained.’ ” Ante, at 11. Though the dictionaries do not\nappear to add that the connection between “means” and\nend must be “something more than oblique, indirect, and\nincidental,” ibid., I agree that, in common usage, not every\nbut-for cause of an act is a cause “by means of ” which the\nact has occurred. No one would say, for example, that the\nhandbag fraudster obtained bank property by means of his\nancestors’ emigration to the United States. But all would\nsay, I think, that he obtained the property by means of the\nlie. His deceit is far from merely incidental to, or an\noblique or indirect way of, obtaining the money. That was\nthe lie’s very purpose.\n   That the fraudster likely was indifferent to the victim’s\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Indeed, saying\nthat indifference is disqualifying comes close to requiring\nthe intent to defraud a bank that the Court properly re-\njects. In any case, indifference certainly does not cause\nwhat is a means not to be a means. Suppose I resolve to\npurchase (with the two dollars in my billfold) a coffee at\nthe first convenience store I pass on my way to work. I am\nindifferent to what store that might be. I catch sight of a\n7-Eleven, pull in, and, with my cash, buy the drink. That\nit is a 7-Eleven coffee rather than a Sheetz coffee is “wholly\nfortuitous,” ibid. Still, no one would say that I had not\nobtained 7-Eleven coffee by means of my two dollars. So\ntoo with the handbag swindler: Regardless of whether the\ncash is the victim’s or, technically, the bank’s, and regard-\nless of whether the swindler cared which it was, would we\nnot say that the fraudster has obtained it by means of the\ntrick?\n   The majority responds that the measure of “means” is\nnot indifference or the absence of fortuity but rather di-\nrectness. And not just proximate-cause-like directness—\nthe fraudulent statement literally must “reach the bank,”\nante, at 14, n. 8. Once again, it seems to me the Court’s\ndefinition does not accord with common usage. Suppose\nlittle Bobby falsely tells his mother that he got an A on his\nweekly spelling test and so deserves an extra cookie after\ndinner. Mother will not be home for dinner, but she leaves\na note for Father: “Bobby gets an extra cookie after dinner\ntonight.” (Much like the handbag buyer’s note to the\nbank: “Pay $2,000 to the order of Mr. Handbag Fraud-\nster.”) Dinner wraps up, and Bobby gets his second cookie.\nHas he obtained it by means of the fib to his mother?\nPlainly yes, an ordinary English speaker would say. But\nplainly no under the Court’s definition, since the lie did\n4               LOUGHRIN v.

If “Jane traded in her car for\nmoney to take a bike trip cross-country, no one would say\nshe ‘crossed the Rockies by means of a car.’ ” Ante, at 12.\nOf course. By using two vehicles of conveyance, and de-\nscribing the end in question as “crossing the Rockies,” the\nstatement that the car was the “means” of achieving that\nend invites one to think that Jill traveled by automobile.\nBut the proper question—the one parallel to the question\nwhether the fraudster obtained bank funds by means of\nfraudulently selling the counterfeit—is not whether Jill\ncrossed the Rockies by means of the car, but whether she\nfunded her trip by means of selling the car. Which she\nassuredly did. Just as the handbag swindler, in the Louis\nVuitton example, obtained money by means of his false\nrepresentation.\n  I certainly agree that this statute must be interpreted, if\npossible, in a manner that will not make every fraud\neffected by receipt of a check a federal offense. But decid-\ning this case does not require us to identify that manner,\nand I would leave that for another case.\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

S. C.\n§1344(2) requires neither intent to defraud a bank nor the\ncreation of a risk of financial loss to a bank, but I must\nwrite separately to express disagreement with some dicta\nin the opinion of the Court.\n  In a few passages, the Court suggests that §1344(2)\nrequires a mens rea of purpose. See ante, at 4 (“[T]he\nclause requires that the defendant intend ‘to obtain any of\nthe moneys . . . or other property owned by, or under the\ncustody or control of, a financial institution’ ” (ellipsis in\noriginal)); ante, at 12, n. 6 (“[W]hen the defendant has the\nrequisite intent to acquire bank property, his presentation\nof a forged or altered check to a third party satisfies\n§1344(2)’s ‘means’ requirement”).* That is incorrect.\n  Congress expressly denoted the mens rea a defendant\nmust have to violate §1344(2), and it is not purpose.\nInstead, §1344(2) imposes liability on “[w]hoever knowingly\nexecutes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice” to\nobtain bank property. (Emphasis added.) It is hard to\nimagine how Congress could have been clearer as to the\nmental state required for liability.\n——————\n  * Cf. ante, at 5 (§1344(1) “includes the requirement that a defendant\nintend to ‘defraud a financial institution’ ”).\n2               LOUGHRIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n    The Court’s contrary statements apparently derive from\nthe fact that the criminal venture that a defendant must\nknowingly execute or attempt to execute must be a scheme\nor artifice “to obtain . . . property owned by . . . a financial\ninstitution.” §1344(2). A defendant must have the pur-\npose to obtain bank property, so the argument goes, be-\ncause he must execute a scheme the purpose of which is to\nobtain bank property.\n    This argument confuses the design of the scheme with\nthe mens rea of the defendant. The statute requires only\nthat the objective of the scheme must be the obtaining of\nbank property, not that the defendant must have such an\nobjective. Of course, in many cases a scheme’s objective\nwill be the same as an individual defendant’s. Where the\ndefendant acts alone, for instance, his objective will almost\ncertainly be the same as that of the scheme, and the in-\nquiry into the defendant’s mens rea and the scheme’s\nobjective will accordingly merge. But in some cases, such\nas those involving large, complex criminal ventures, a\ngiven defendant’s purpose may diverge from the scheme’s\nobjective. For instance, a defendant who is paid by a large\nring of check forgers to present one of their forged checks\nto a bank for payment has executed “a scheme or artifice\n. . . to obtain” bank property, even if he only presents the\ncheck because he is paid to do so and personally does not\ncare whether the forged check is honored. That is because\nthe objective of the scheme as a whole is to obtain bank\nproperty, and the defendant knowingly executes that\nscheme.\n    The majority reads the word “knowingly” out of the\nstatute. That term “ ‘requires proof of knowledge of the\nfacts that constitute the offense.’ ” Dixon v. United States,\n548 U. S. 1, 5 (2006). If the majority is correct that the\nlanguage “a scheme or artifice . . . to obtain” bank property\ndemands that the defendant intend to obtain bank prop-\nerty, then the word “knowingly” is superfluous, because a\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ndefendant whose purpose is to obtain bank property will\nalways know that his purpose is to obtain bank property.\nWhy would Congress expressly specify a lesser mens rea\nelement if elsewhere in the statute it commands a greater,\nsubsuming one?\n   Proof that a defendant acted knowingly very often gives\nrise to a reasonable inference that the defendant also\nacted purposely, and therefore the Court’s dicta may not\nhave much practical effect. But if the issue is presented in\na future case, the Court’s statements must be regarded as\ndicta. The Court’s statements that a defendant must\nintend to obtain bank property to be convicted under\n§1344(2) are unnecessary to its conclusion that a defend-\nant may be convicted under this provision without proof\nthat he either intended to defraud a bank or created a risk\nof loss to a bank. Furthermore, as the Court makes clear,\npetitioner waived any challenge to his conviction arising\nfrom an asserted statutory requirement that he must have\nintended to obtain bank property.
