Argued February 24, 2014\u2014Decided June 23, 2014 *\nThe Clean Air Act imposes permitting requirements on stationary\n  sources, such as factories and powerplants. The Act\u2019s \u201cPrevention of\n  Significant Deterioration\u201d (PSD) provisions make it unlawful to con-\n  struct or modify a \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d in \u201cany area to which [the\n  PSD program] applies\u201d without a permit. \u00a7\u00a77475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C). A\n  \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d is a stationary source with the potential to\n  emit 250 tons per year of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d (or 100 tons per year for\n  certain types of sources). \u00a77479(1). Facilities seeking to qualify for a\n  PSD permit must, inter alia, comply with emissions limitations that\n  reflect the \u201cbest available control technology\u201d (BACT) for \u201ceach pollu-\n  tant subject to regulation under\u201d the Act. \u00a77475(a)(4). In addition,\n  Title V of the Act makes it unlawful to operate any \u201cmajor source,\u201d\n  wherever located, without a permit. \u00a77661a(a). A \u201cmajor source\u201d is a\n  stationary source with the potential to emit 100 tons per year of \u201cany\n  air pollutant.\u201d \u00a7\u00a77661(2)(B), 7602(j).\n     In response to Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, EPA promul-\n  gated greenhouse-gas emission standards for new motor vehicles, and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 12\u20131248, American Chemistry Council et al. v.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency et al., No. 12\u20131254, Energy-Intensive\nManufacturers Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Regulation et al. v.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency et al., No. 12\u20131268, Southeastern Le-\ngal Foundation, Inc., et al. v.

EPA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    made stationary sources subject to the PSD program and Title V on\n    the basis of their potential to emit greenhouse gases. It recognized,\n    however, that requiring permits for all sources with greenhouse-gas\n    emissions above the statutory thresholds would radically expand\n    those programs and render them unadministrable. So EPA purport-\n    ed to \u201ctailor\u201d the programs to accommodate greenhouse gases by\n    providing, among other things, that sources would not become newly\n    subject to PSD or Title V permitting on the basis of their potential to\n    emit greenhouse gases in amounts less than 100,000 tons per year.\n       Numerous parties, including several States, challenged EPA\u2019s ac-\n    tions in the D. C. Circuit, which dismissed some of the petitions for\n    lack of jurisdiction and denied the remainder.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n684 F. 3d 102, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I and II, concluding:\n    1. The Act neither compels nor permits EPA to adopt an interpre-\n  tation of the Act requiring a source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit\n  on the sole basis of its potential greenhouse-gas emissions. Pp. 10\u2013\n  24.\n       (a) The Act does not compel EPA\u2019s interpretation. Massachusetts\n  held that the Act-wide definition of \u201cair pollutant\u201d includes green-\n  house gases, 549 U. S., at 529, but where the term \u201cair pollutant\u201d ap-\n  pears in the Act\u2019s operative provisions, including the PSD and Title V\n  permitting provisions, EPA has routinely given it a narrower, con-\n  text-appropriate meaning. Massachusetts did not invalidate those\n  longstanding constructions. The Act-wide definition is not a com-\n  mand to regulate, but a description of the universe of substances EPA\n  may consider regulating under the Act\u2019s operative provisions.\n  Though Congress\u2019s profligate use of \u201cair pollutant\u201d is not conducive to\n  clarity, the presumption of consistent usage \u201c \u2018readily yields\u2019 \u201d to con-\n  text, and a statutory term \u201cmay take on distinct characters from as-\n  sociation with distinct statutory objects calling for different imple-\n  mentation strategies.\u201d Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp.,\n  549 U. S. 561, 574. Pp. 10\u201316.\n       (b) Nor does the Act permit EPA\u2019s interpretation. Agencies em-\n  powered to resolve statutory ambiguities must operate \u201cwithin the\n  bounds of reasonable interpretation,\u201d Arlington v. FCC, 569 U. S. ___,\n  ___. EPA has repeatedly acknowledged that applying the PSD and\n  Title V permitting requirements to greenhouse gases would be incon-\n  sistent with the Act\u2019s structure and design. A review of the relevant\n  statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD program and Title\n  V are designed to apply to, and cannot rationally be extended beyond,\n  a relative handful of large sources capable of shouldering heavy sub-\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  stantive and procedural burdens. EPA\u2019s interpretation would also\n  bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in EPA\u2019s\n  regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization. FDA\n  v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 160. Pp. 16\u201320.\n        (c) EPA lacked authority to \u201ctailor\u201d the Act\u2019s unambiguous nu-\n  merical thresholds of 100 or 250 tons per year to accommodate its\n  greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the permitting triggers.\n  Agencies must always \u201c \u2018give effect to the unambiguously expressed\n  intent of Congress.\u2019 \u201d National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders\n  of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 665. The power to execute the laws does\n  not include a power to revise clear statutory terms that turn out not\n  to work in practice. Pp. 20\u201324.\n     2. EPA reasonably interpreted the Act to require sources that\n  would need permits based on their emission of conventional pollu-\n  tants to comply with BACT for greenhouse gases. Pp. 24\u201329.\n        (a) Concerns that BACT, which has traditionally been about end-\n  of-stack controls, is fundamentally unsuited to greenhouse-gas regu-\n  lation, which is more about energy use, are not unfounded. But an\n  EPA guidance document states that BACT analysis should consider\n  options other than energy efficiency, including \u201ccarbon capture and\n  storage,\u201d which EPA contends is reasonably comparable to more tra-\n  ditional, end-of-stack BACT technologies. Moreover, assuming that\n  BACT may be used to force improvements in energy efficiency, im-\n  portant limitations on BACT may work to mitigate concerns about\n  \u201cunbounded\u201d regulatory authority. Pp. 24\u201327.\n        (b) EPA\u2019s decision to require BACT for greenhouse gases emitted\n  by sources otherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a\n  permissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron U. S. A. Inc.\n  v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. The specif-\n  ic phrasing of the BACT provision\u2014which requires BACT \u201cfor each\n  pollutant subject to regulation under\u201d the Act, \u00a77475(a)(4)\u2014does not\n  suggest that the provision can bear a narrowing construction. And\n  even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to greenhouse gases is\n  not so disastrously unworkable, and need not result in such a dra-\n  matic expansion of agency authority, as to make EPA\u2019s interpretation\n  unreasonable.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a77401\u20137671q, the Environmental\nProtection Agency recently set standards for emissions of\n\u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (substances it believes contribute to\n\u201cglobal climate change\u201d) from new motor vehicles. We\nmust decide whether it was permissible for EPA to deter-\nmine that its motor-vehicle greenhouse-gas regulations\nautomatically triggered permitting requirements under\nthe Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases.\n                       I. Background\n              A. Stationary-Source Permitting\n   The Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating emis-\nsions from both stationary sources, such as factories and\npowerplants, and moving sources, such as cars, trucks,\nand aircraft. This litigation concerns permitting obliga-\ntions imposed on stationary sources under Titles I and V\nof the Act.\n   Title I charges EPA with formulating national ambient\nair quality standards (NAAQS) for air pollutants. \u00a7\u00a77408\u2013\n7409. To date, EPA has issued NAAQS for six pollutants:\nsulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon\nmonoxide, ozone, and lead. Clean Air Act Handbook 125\n(J. Domike & A. Zacaroli eds., 3d ed. 2011); see generally\n40 CFR pt. 50 (2013). States have primary responsibility\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor implementing the NAAQS by developing \u201cState imple-\nmentation plans.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77410. A State must desig-\nnate every area within its borders as \u201cattainment,\u201d \u201cnon-\nattainment,\u201d or \u201cunclassifiable\u201d with respect to each\nNAAQS, \u00a77407(d), and the State\u2019s implementation plan\nmust include permitting programs for stationary sources\nthat vary according to the classification of the area where\nthe source is or is proposed to be located. \u00a77410(a)(2)(C),\n(I).\n   Stationary sources in areas designated attainment or\nunclassifiable are subject to the Act\u2019s provisions relating to\n\u201cPrevention of Significant Deterioration\u201d (PSD). \u00a7\u00a77470\u2013\n7492. EPA interprets the PSD provisions to apply to\nsources located in areas that are designated attainment or\nunclassifiable for any NAAQS pollutant, regardless of\nwhether the source emits that specific pollutant. Since the\ninception of the PSD program, every area of the country\nhas been designated attainment or unclassifiable for at\nleast one NAAQS pollutant; thus, on EPA\u2019s view, all sta-\ntionary sources are potentially subject to PSD review.\n   It is unlawful to construct or modify a \u201cmajor emitting\nfacility\u201d in \u201cany area to which [the PSD program] applies\u201d\nwithout first obtaining a permit. \u00a7\u00a77475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C).\nTo qualify for a permit, the facility must not cause or\ncontribute to the violation of any applicable air-quality\nstandard, \u00a77475(a)(3), and it must comply with emissions\nlimitations that reflect the \u201cbest available control technol-\nogy\u201d (or BACT) for \u201ceach pollutant subject to regulation\nunder\u201d the Act. \u00a77475(a)(4). The Act defines a \u201cmajor\nemitting facility\u201d as any stationary source with the poten-\ntial to emit 250 tons per year of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d (or 100\ntons per year for certain types of sources). \u00a77479(1). It\ndefines \u201cmodification\u201d as a physical or operational change\nthat causes the facility to emit more of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d\n4                UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a77411(a)(4).1\n  In addition to the PSD permitting requirements for\nconstruction and modification, Title V of the Act makes it\nunlawful to operate any \u201cmajor source,\u201d wherever located,\nwithout a comprehensive operating permit. \u00a77661a(a).\nUnlike the PSD program, Title V generally does not im-\npose any substantive pollution-control requirements.\nInstead, it is designed to facilitate compliance and en-\nforcement by consolidating into a single document all of a\nfacility\u2019s obligations under the Act. The permit must\ninclude all \u201cemissions limitations and standards\u201d that\napply to the source, as well as associated inspection, moni-\ntoring, and reporting requirements. \u00a77661c(a)\u2013(c). Title V\ndefines a \u201cmajor source\u201d by reference to the Act-wide\ndefinition of \u201cmajor stationary source,\u201d which in turn\nmeans any stationary source with the potential to emit\n100 tons per year of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d \u00a7\u00a77661(2)(B),\n7602( j).\n          B. EPA\u2019s Greenhouse-Gas Regulations\n  In 2007, the Court held that Title II of the Act \u201cauthor-\nize[d] EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new\nmotor vehicles\u201d if the Agency \u201cform[ed] a \u2018judgment\u2019 that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Although the statute sets numerical thresholds (100 or 250 tons per\nyear) for emissions that will make a facility \u201cmajor,\u201d it does not specify\nby how much a physical or operational change must increase emissions\nto constitute a permit-requiring \u201cmodification.\u201d Nor does it say how\nmuch of a given regulated pollutant a \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d must\nemit before it is subject to BACT for that pollutant. EPA, however, has\nestablished pollutant-specific numerical thresholds below which a\nfacility\u2019s emissions of a pollutant, and increases therein, are considered\nde minimis for those purposes. See 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a751.166(b)(2)(i), (23), (39),\n(j)(2)\u2013(3), 52.21(b)(2)(i), (23), (40), (j)(2)\u2013(3); see also Alabama Power Co.\nv.

S. 497, 528 (quoting \u00a77521(a)(1)). In\nresponse to that decision, EPA embarked on a course of\nregulation resulting in \u201cthe single largest expansion in the\nscope of the [Act] in its history.\u201d Clean Air Act Handbook,\nat xxi.\n   EPA first asked the public, in a notice of proposed rule-\nmaking, to comment on how the Agency should respond to\nMassachusetts. In doing so, it explained that regulating\ngreenhouse-gas emissions from motor vehicles could have\nfar-reaching consequences for stationary sources. Under\nEPA\u2019s view, once greenhouse gases became regulated\nunder any part of the Act, the PSD and Title V permitting\nrequirements would apply to all stationary sources with\nthe potential to emit greenhouse gases in excess of the\nstatutory thresholds: 100 tons per year under Title V, and\n100 or 250 tons per year under the PSD program depend-\ning on the type of source. 73 Fed. Reg. 44420, 44498,\n44511 (2008). Because greenhouse-gas emissions tend to\nbe \u201corders of magnitude greater\u201d than emissions of con-\nventional pollutants, EPA projected that numerous small\nsources not previously regulated under the Act would be\nswept into the PSD program and Title V, including \u201csmaller\nindustrial sources,\u201d \u201clarge office and residential build-\nings, hotels, large retail establishments, and similar facili-\nties.\u201d Id., at 44498\u201344499. The Agency warned that this\nwould constitute an \u201cunprecedented expansion of EPA\nauthority that would have a profound effect on virtually\nevery sector of the economy and touch every household in\nthe land,\u201d yet still be \u201crelatively ineffective at reducing\ngreenhouse gas concentrations.\u201d Id., at 44355.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Comments from other Executive Branch agencies reprinted in the\n\nnotice echoed those concerns.

Those steps were\nnecessary, it said, because the PSD program and Title V\nwere designed to regulate \u201ca relatively small number of\nlarge industrial sources,\u201d and requiring permits for all\nsources with greenhouse-gas emissions above the statu-\ntory thresholds would radically expand those programs,\nmaking them both unadministrable and \u201cunrecognizable\nto the Congress that designed\u201d them. Id., at 31555, 31562.\nEPA nonetheless rejected calls to exclude greenhouse\ngases entirely from those programs, asserting that the Act\nis not \u201cambiguous with respect to the need to cover\n[greenhouse-gas] sources under either the PSD or title V\nprogram.\u201d Id., at 31548, n. 31. Instead, EPA adopted a\n\u201cphase-in approach\u201d that it said would \u201cappl[y] PSD and\ntitle V at threshold levels that are as close to the statutory\nlevels as possible, and do so as quickly as possible, at least\nto a certain point.\u201d Id., at 31523.\n   The phase-in, EPA said, would consist of at least three\nsteps. During Step 1, from January 2 through June 30,\n2011, no source would become newly subject to the PSD\nprogram or Title V solely on the basis of its greenhouse-\ngas emissions; however, sources required to obtain permits\nanyway because of their emission of conventional pollu-\ntants (so-called \u201canyway\u201d sources) would need to comply\nwith BACT for greenhouse gases if they emitted those\ngases in significant amounts, defined as at least 75,000\ntons per year CO2e. Ibid. During Step 2, from July 1,\n2011, through June 30, 2012, sources with the potential to\nemit at least 100,000 tons per year CO2e of greenhouse\ngases would be subject to PSD and Title V permitting for\ntheir construction and operation and to PSD permitting\n8           UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

Id., at 31524. Beyond Step 3, EPA\npromised to complete another round of rulemaking by\nApril 30, 2016, in which it would \u201ctake further action to\naddress small sources,\u201d which might (or might not) include\nestablishing permanent exemptions.

First, we must decide whether EPA permissibly\ndetermined that a source may be subject to the PSD and\nTitle V permitting requirements on the sole basis of the\nsource\u2019s potential to emit greenhouse gases. Second, we\nmust decide whether EPA permissibly determined that a\nsource already subject to the PSD program because of its\nemission of conventional pollutants (an \u201canyway\u201d source)\nmay be required to limit its greenhouse-gas emissions by\nemploying the \u201cbest available control technology\u201d for\ngreenhouse gases.

Under Chevron, we presume that when\nan agency-administered statute is ambiguous with respect\nto what it prescribes, Congress has empowered the agency\nto resolve the ambiguity.

The PSD and Title V Triggers\n  We first decide whether EPA permissibly interpreted\nthe statute to provide that a source may be required to\nobtain a PSD or Title V permit on the sole basis of its\npotential greenhouse-gas emissions.\n                            1\n   EPA thought its conclusion that a source\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas emissions may necessitate a PSD or Title V permit\nfollowed from the Act\u2019s unambiguous language. The Court\nof Appeals agreed and held that the statute \u201ccompelled\u201d\nEPA\u2019s interpretation. 684 F. 3d, at 134. We disagree.\nThe statute compelled EPA\u2019s greenhouse-gas-inclusive\ninterpretation with respect to neither the PSD program\nnor Title V.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Court of Appeals held that petitioners\u2019 arguments applied only\n\nto the PSD program and that petitioners had therefore \u201cforfeited any\nchallenges to EPA\u2019s greenhouse gas-inclusive interpretation of Title V.\u201d\n684 F. 3d, at 136.

S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals reasoned by way of a flawed syllo-\ngism: Under Massachusetts, the general, Act-wide defini-\ntion of \u201cair pollutant\u201d includes greenhouse gases; the Act\nrequires permits for major emitters of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d;\ntherefore, the Act requires permits for major emitters of\ngreenhouse gases. The conclusion follows from the prem-\nises only if the air pollutants referred to in the permit-\nrequiring provisions (the minor premise) are the same air\npollutants encompassed by the Act-wide definition as\ninterpreted in Massachusetts (the major premise). Yet no\none\u2014least of all EPA\u2014endorses that proposition, and it is\nobviously untenable.\n   The Act-wide definition says that an air pollutant is\n\u201cany air pollution agent or combination of such agents,\nincluding any physical, chemical, biological, [or] radioac-\ntive . . . substance or matter which is emitted into or oth-\nerwise enters the ambient air.\u201d \u00a77602(g). In Massachu\u00ad\nsetts, the Court held that the Act-wide definition includes\ngreenhouse gases because it is all-encompassing; it \u201cem-\nbraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe.\u201d 549\nU. S., at 529. But where the term \u201cair pollutant\u201d appears\nin the Act\u2019s operative provisions, EPA has routinely given\nit a narrower, context-appropriate meaning.\n   That is certainly true of the provisions that require PSD\nand Title V permitting for major emitters of \u201cany air pollu-\ntant.\u201d Since 1978, EPA\u2019s regulations have interpreted \u201cair\npollutant\u201d in the PSD permitting trigger as limited to\nregulated air pollutants, 43 Fed.

See Brief for Federal Respondents 56. We agree,\n\nand we are satisfied that those arguments were also made below. See,\n\ne.g., Brief for State Petitioners et al. in No. 10\u20131073 etc. (CADC), pp.\n\n59\u201373; Brief for Non-State Petitioners et al. in No. 10\u20131073 etc.\n\n(CADC), pp. 46\u201347. \n\n12         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhatever stripe,\u201d 549 U. S., at 529. And since 1993 EPA\nhas informally taken the same position with regard to the\nTitle V permitting trigger, a position the Agency ultimately\nincorporated into some of the regulations at issue here.\nSee Memorandum from Lydia N. Wegman, Deputy Direc-\ntor, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to Air\nDivision Director, Regions I\u2013X, pp. 4\u20135 (Apr. 26, 1993);\nTailoring Rule 31607\u201331608 (amending 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a770.2,\n71.2). Those interpretations were appropriate: It is plain\nas day that the Act does not envision an elaborate, bur-\ndensome permitting process for major emitters of steam,\noxygen, or other harmless airborne substances. It takes\nsome cheek for EPA to insist that it cannot possibly give\n\u201cair pollutant\u201d a reasonable, context-appropriate meaning\nin the PSD and Title V contexts when it has been doing\nprecisely that for decades.\n  Nor are those the only places in the Act where EPA has\ninferred from statutory context that a generic reference to\nair pollutants does not encompass every substance falling\nwithin the Act-wide definition. Other examples abound:\n\n     \uf0b7\t The Act authorizes EPA to enforce new source per-\n        formance standards (NSPS) against a pre-existing\n        source if, after promulgation of the standards, the\n        source undergoes a physical or operational change\n        that increases its emission of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d\n        \u00a77411(a)(2), (4), (b)(1)(B).

Reg. 39160\n      (2005), codified at 40 CFR pt. 51, App. Y, \u00a7II.A.3.\n\nAlthough these limitations are nowhere to be found in the\nAct-wide definition, in each instance EPA has concluded\u2014\nas it has in the PSD and Title V context\u2014that the statute\nis not using \u201cair pollutant\u201d in Massachusetts\u2019 broad sense\nto mean any airborne substance whatsoever.\n   Massachusetts did not invalidate all these longstanding\nconstructions. That case did not hold that EPA must\nalways regulate greenhouse gases as an \u201cair pollutant\u201d\neverywhere that term appears in the statute, but only that\nEPA must \u201cground its reasons for action or inaction in the\nstatute,\u201d 549 U. S., at 535 (emphasis added), rather than\non \u201creasoning divorced from the statutory text,\u201d id., at\n532. EPA\u2019s inaction with regard to Title II was not suffi-\nciently grounded in the statute, the Court said, in part\n14          UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause nothing in the Act suggested that regulating\ngreenhouse gases under that Title would conflict with the\nstatutory design. Title II would not compel EPA to regu-\nlate in any way that would be \u201cextreme,\u201d \u201ccounterintui-\ntive,\u201d or contrary to \u201c \u2018common sense.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 531. At\nmost, it would require EPA to take the modest step of\nadding greenhouse-gas standards to the roster of new-\nmotor-vehicle emission regulations. Ibid.\n   Massachusetts does not strip EPA of authority to ex-\nclude greenhouse gases from the class of regulable air\npollutants under other parts of the Act where their inclu-\nsion would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme. The\nAct-wide definition to which the Court gave a \u201csweeping\u201d\nand \u201ccapacious\u201d interpretation, id., at 528, 532, is not a\ncommand to regulate, but a description of the universe of\nsubstances EPA may consider regulating under the Act\u2019s\noperative provisions. Massachusetts does not foreclose the\nAgency\u2019s use of statutory context to infer that certain of\nthe Act\u2019s provisions use \u201cair pollutant\u201d to denote not every\nconceivable airborne substance, but only those that may\nsensibly be encompassed within the particular regulatory\nprogram. As certain amici felicitously put it, while Mas\u00ad\nsachusetts \u201crejected EPA\u2019s categorical contention that\ngreenhouse gases could not be \u2018air pollutants\u2019 for any\npurposes of the Act,\u201d it did not \u201cembrace EPA\u2019s current,\nequally categorical position that greenhouse gases must be\nair pollutants for all purposes\u201d regardless of the statutory\ncontext.

But we, and EPA, must do our best, bearing in mind\nthe \u201c \u2018fundamental canon of statutory construction that the\nwords of a statute must be read in their context and with a\nview to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d FDA\nv.

As we reiterated the same day we decided Massa\u00ad\nchusetts, the presumption of consistent usage \u201c \u2018readily\nyields\u2019 \u201d to context, and a statutory term\u2014even one defined\nin the statute\u2014\u201cmay take on distinct characters from\nassociation with distinct statutory objects calling for dif-\nferent implementation strategies.\u201d Duke Energy, supra, at\n574.\n   We need not, and do not, pass on the validity of all the\nlimiting constructions EPA has given the term \u201cair pollu-\ntant\u201d throughout the Act. We merely observe that taken\ntogether, they belie EPA\u2019s rigid insistence that when\ninterpreting the PSD and Title V permitting requirements\nit is bound by the Act-wide definition\u2019s inclusion of green-\nhouse gases, no matter how incompatible that inclusion is\nwith those programs\u2019 regulatory structure.\n   In sum, there is no insuperable textual barrier to EPA\u2019s\ninterpreting \u201cany air pollutant\u201d in the permitting triggers\nof PSD and Title V to encompass only pollutants emitted\nin quantities that enable them to be sensibly regulated at\nthe statutory thresholds, and to exclude those atypical\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nnot at issue here and one that no party in American Electric Power\n\nargued was ill suited to accommodating greenhouse gases. \n\n16           UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

Judge Kavanaugh\nargued below that it would be plausible for EPA to read \u201cany air pollu-\ntant\u201d in the PSD context as limited to the six NAAQS pollutants. See\nCoalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc. v.

Some petitioners\nmake a slightly different argument: that because PSD permitting is\nrequired only for major emitting facilities \u201cin any area to which [the\nPSD program] applies,\u201d \u00a77475(a), the relevant pollutants are only those\nNAAQS pollutants for which the area in question is designated attain-\nment or unclassifiable. That approach would bring EPA\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of the PSD trigger in line with its longstanding interpretation of\nthe permitting requirements for nonattainment areas. Others main-\ntain that \u201cany air pollutant\u201d in the PSD provision should be limited to\nair pollutants with localized effects on air quality. We do not foreclose\nEPA or the courts from considering those constructions in the future,\nbut we need not do so today.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

In the Tailor-\ning Rule, EPA described the calamitous consequences of\ninterpreting the Act in that way. Under the PSD program,\nannual permit applications would jump from about 800 to\nnearly 82,000; annual administrative costs would swell\nfrom $12 million to over $1.5 billion; and decade-long\ndelays in issuing permits would become common, causing\nconstruction projects to grind to a halt nationwide. Tailor-\ning Rule 31557. The picture under Title V was equally\nbleak: The number of sources required to have permits\nwould jump from fewer than 15,000 to about 6.1 million;\nannual administrative costs would balloon from $62 mil-\nlion to $21 billion; and collectively the newly covered\nsources would face permitting costs of $147 billion. Id., at\n31562\u201331563. Moreover, \u201cthe great majority of additional\nsources brought into the PSD and title V programs would\nbe small sources that Congress did not expect would need\nto undergo permitting.\u201d Id., at 31533. EPA stated that\nthese results would be so \u201ccontrary to congressional in-\ntent,\u201d and would so \u201cseverely undermine what Congress\nsought to accomplish,\u201d that they necessitated as much as a\n1,000-fold increase in the permitting thresholds set forth\nin the statute. Id., at 31554, 31562.\n18        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Like EPA, we think it beyond reasonable debate that\nrequiring permits for sources based solely on their emis-\nsion of greenhouse gases at the 100- and 250-tons-per-year\nlevels set forth in the statute would be \u201cincompatible\u201d with\n\u201cthe substance of Congress\u2019 regulatory scheme.\u201d Brown &\nWilliamson, 529 U. S., at 156. A brief review of the rele-\nvant statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD\nprogram and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot\nrationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large\nsources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and\nprocedural burdens.\n  Start with the PSD program, which imposes numerous\nand costly requirements on those sources that are required\nto apply for permits. Among other things, the applicant\nmust make available a detailed scientific analysis of the\nsource\u2019s potential pollution-related impacts, demonstrate\nthat the source will not contribute to the violation of any\napplicable pollution standard, and identify and use the\n\u201cbest available control technology\u201d for each regulated\npollutant it emits. \u00a77475(a)(3), (4), (6), (e). The permitting\nauthority (the State, usually) also bears its share of the\nburden: It must grant or deny a permit within a year,\nduring which time it must hold a public hearing on the\napplication. \u00a77475(a)(2), (c).      Not surprisingly, EPA\nacknowledges that PSD review is a \u201ccomplicated, resource-\nintensive, time-consuming, and sometimes contentious\nprocess\u201d suitable for \u201chundreds of larger sources,\u201d not\n\u201ctens of thousands of smaller sources.\u201d 74 Fed. Reg.\n55304, 55321\u201355322.\n  Title V contains no comparable substantive require-\nments but imposes elaborate procedural mandates. It\nrequires the applicant to submit, within a year of becom-\ning subject to Title V, a permit application and a \u201ccompli-\nance plan\u201d describing how it will comply with \u201call applica-\nble requirements\u201d under the Act; to certify its compliance\nannually; and to submit to \u201cinspection, entry, monitoring,\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

The procedural burdens on the permitting\nauthority and EPA are also significant. The permitting\nauthority must hold a public hearing on the application,\n\u00a77661a(b)(6), and it must forward the application and any\nproposed permit to EPA and neighboring States and re-\nspond in writing to their comments, \u00a77661d(a), (b)(1). If it\nfails to issue or deny the permit within 18 months, any\ninterested party can sue to require a decision \u201cwithout\nadditional delay.\u201d \u00a7\u00a77661a(b)(7), 7661b(c). An interested\nparty also can petition EPA to block issuance of the per-\nmit; EPA must grant or deny the petition within 60 days,\nand its decision may be challenged in federal court.\n\u00a77661d(b)(2)\u2013(3). As EPA wrote, Title V is \u201cfinely crafted\nfor thousands,\u201d not millions, of sources. Tailoring Rule\n31563.\n    The fact that EPA\u2019s greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpre-\ntation of the PSD and Title V triggers would place plainly\nexcessive demands on limited governmental resources is\nalone a good reason for rejecting it; but that is not the only\nreason. EPA\u2019s interpretation is also unreasonable because\nit would bring about an enormous and transformative\nexpansion in EPA\u2019s regulatory authority without clear\ncongressional authorization. When an agency claims to\ndiscover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to\nregulate \u201ca significant portion of the American economy,\u201d\nBrown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159, we typically greet\nits announcement with a measure of skepticism. We\nexpect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to\nan agency decisions of vast \u201ceconomic and political signifi-\ncance.\u201d Id., at 160; see also MCI Telecommunications\nCorp. v.

The power to require permits\nfor the construction and modification of tens of thousands,\n20          UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nand the operation of millions, of small sources nationwide\nfalls comfortably within the class of authorizations that we\nhave been reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory text.\nMoreover, in EPA\u2019s assertion of that authority, we con-\nfront a singular situation: an agency laying claim to ex-\ntravagant statutory power over the national economy\nwhile at the same time strenuously asserting that the\nauthority claimed would render the statute \u201cunrecogniza-\nble to the Congress that designed\u201d it. Tailoring Rule\n31555. Since, as we hold above, the statute does not com-\npel EPA\u2019s interpretation, it would be patently unreason-\nable\u2014not to say outrageous\u2014for EPA to insist on seizing\nexpansive power that it admits the statute is not designed\nto grant.7\n                             3\n  EPA thought that despite the foregoing problems, it\ncould make its interpretation reasonable by adjusting the\nlevels at which a source\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 A few additional points bear mentioning.      The Solicitor General\nconjectures that EPA might eventually alter its longstanding interpre-\ntation of \u201cpotential to emit\u201d in order to reduce the number of sources\nrequired to have permits at the statutory thresholds. But neither he\nnor the Agency has given us any reason to believe that there exists a\nplausible reading of \u201cpotential to emit\u201d that EPA would willingly adopt\nand that would eliminate the unreasonableness of EPA\u2019s interpretation.\nNor have we been given any information about the ability of other\npossible \u201cstreamlining\u201d techniques alluded to by EPA\u2014such as \u201cgen-\neral\u201d or \u201celectronic\u201d permitting\u2014to reduce the administrability prob-\nlems identified above; and in any event, none of those techniques would\naddress the more fundamental problem of EPA\u2019s claiming regulatory\nauthority over millions of small entities that it acknowledges the Act\ndoes not seek to regulate. Finally, the Solicitor General suggests that\nthe incompatibility of greenhouse gases with the PSD program and\nTitle V results chiefly from the inclusion of carbon dioxide in the\n\u201caggregate pollutant\u201d defined by EPA. We decide these cases on the\nbasis of the pollutant \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d as EPA has defined and\nregulated it, and we express no view on how our analysis might change\nwere EPA to define it differently.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noblige it to undergo PSD and Title V permitting. Although\nthe Act, in no uncertain terms, requires permits for\nsources with the potential to emit more than 100 or 250\ntons per year of a relevant pollutant, EPA in its Tailoring\nRule wrote a new threshold of 100,000 tons per year for\ngreenhouse gases. Since the Court of Appeals thought the\nstatute unambiguously made greenhouse gases capable of\ntriggering PSD and Title V, it held that petitioners lacked\nArticle III standing to challenge the Tailoring Rule be-\ncause that rule did not injure petitioners but merely re-\nlaxed the pre-existing statutory requirements. Because\nwe, however, hold that EPA\u2019s greenhouse-gas-inclusive\ninterpretation of the triggers was not compelled, and\nbecause EPA has essentially admitted that its interpreta-\ntion would be unreasonable without \u201ctailoring,\u201d we consider\nthe validity of the Tailoring Rule.\n   We conclude that EPA\u2019s rewriting of the statutory\nthresholds was impermissible and therefore could not\nvalidate the Agency\u2019s interpretation of the triggering\nprovisions. An agency has no power to \u201ctailor\u201d legislation\nto bureaucratic policy goals by rewriting unambiguous\nstatutory terms. Agencies exercise discretion only in the\ninterstices created by statutory silence or ambiguity; they\nmust always \u201c \u2018give effect to the unambiguously expressed\nintent of Congress.\u2019 \u201d National Assn. of Home Builders v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 665 (2007) (quoting\nChevron, 467 U. S., at 843). It is hard to imagine a statu-\ntory term less ambiguous than the precise numerical\nthresholds at which the Act requires PSD and Title V\npermitting. When EPA replaced those numbers with\nothers of its own choosing, it went well beyond the \u201cbounds\nof its statutory authority.\u201d Arlington, 569 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 5) (emphasis deleted).\n   The Solicitor General does not, and cannot, defend the\nTailoring Rule as an exercise of EPA\u2019s enforcement discre-\ntion. The Tailoring Rule is not just an announcement of\n22        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nEPA\u2019s refusal to enforce the statutory permitting require-\nments; it purports to alter those requirements and to\nestablish with the force of law that otherwise-prohibited\nconduct will not violate the Act. This alteration of the\nstatutory requirements was crucial to EPA\u2019s \u201ctailoring\u201d\nefforts. Without it, small entities with the potential to\nemit greenhouse gases in amounts exceeding the statutory\nthresholds would have remained subject to citizen suits\u2014\nauthorized by the Act\u2014to enjoin their construction, modi-\nfication, or operation and to impose civil penalties of up to\n$37,500 per day of violation. \u00a7\u00a77413(b), 7604(a), (f)(4); 40\nCFR \u00a719.4. EPA itself has recently affirmed that the\n\u201cindependent enforcement authority\u201d furnished by the\ncitizen-suit provision cannot be displaced by a permitting\nauthority\u2019s decision not to pursue enforcement. 78 Fed.\nReg. 12477, 12486\u201312487 (2013). The Solicitor General is\ntherefore quite right to acknowledge that the availability\nof citizen suits made it necessary for EPA, in seeking\nto mitigate the unreasonableness of its greenhouse-gas-\ninclusive interpretation, to go beyond merely exercising its\nenforcement discretion. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 87\u201388.\n   For similar reasons, Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199\n(1974)\u2014to which the Solicitor General points as the best\ncase supporting the Tailoring Rule, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 71,\n80\u201381\u2014is irrelevant. In Ruiz, Congress had appropriated\nfunds for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to spend on provid-\ning assistance to \u201c \u2018Indians throughout the United States\u2019 \u201d\nand had not \u201cimpose[d] any geographical limitation on the\navailability of general assistance benefits.\u201d Id., at 206\u2013\n207, and n. 7. Although we held the Bureau could not\ndeny benefits to off-reservation Indians because it had not\npublished its eligibility criteria, we stated in dictum that\nthe Bureau could, if it followed proper administrative\nprocedures, \u201ccreate reasonable classifications and eligibil-\nity requirements in order to allocate the limited funds\navailable.\u201d Id., at 230\u2013231.

See also Lincoln v. Vigil, 508\nU. S. 182, 192\u2013193 (1993). Nothing in Ruiz remotely\nauthorizes an agency to modify unambiguous require-\nments imposed by a federal statute. An agency confront-\ning resource constraints may change its own conduct, but\nit cannot change the law.\n   Were we to recognize the authority claimed by EPA in\nthe Tailoring Rule, we would deal a severe blow to the\nConstitution\u2019s separation of powers. Under our system of\ngovernment, Congress makes laws and the President,\nacting at times through agencies like EPA, \u201cfaithfully\nexecute[s]\u201d them. U. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a73; see Medell\u00edn v.\nTexas, 552 U. S. 491, 526\u2013527 (2008). The power of exe-\ncuting the laws necessarily includes both authority and\nresponsibility to resolve some questions left open by Con-\ngress that arise during the law\u2019s administration. But it\ndoes not include a power to revise clear statutory terms\nthat turn out not to work in practice. See, e.g., Barnhart\nv. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002) (agency\nlacked authority \u201cto develop new guidelines or to assign\nliability in a manner inconsistent with\u201d an \u201cunambiguous\nstatute\u201d).\n   In the Tailoring Rule, EPA asserts newfound authority\nto regulate millions of small sources\u2014including retail\nstores, offices, apartment buildings, shopping centers,\nschools, and churches\u2014and to decide, on an ongoing basis\nand without regard for the thresholds prescribed by Con-\ngress, how many of those sources to regulate. We are not\nwilling to stand on the dock and wave goodbye as EPA\nembarks on this multiyear voyage of discovery. We reaf-\nfirm the core administrative-law principle that an agency\nmay not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense\nof how the statute should operate. EPA therefore lacked\nauthority to \u201ctailor\u201d the Act\u2019s unambiguous numerical\n24            UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

We are aware of no principle of administrative law that would\nallow an agency to rewrite such a clear statutory term, and we shudder\nto contemplate the effect that such a principle would have on demo-\ncratic governance.\n  JUSTICE BREYER, however, claims to perceive no difference between\n(a) reading the statute to exclude greenhouse gases from the term \u201cany\nair pollutant\u201d in the permitting triggers, and (b) reading the statute to\nexclude sources emitting less than 100,000 tons per year from the\nstatutory phrase \u201cany . . . source with the potential to emit two hundred\nand fifty tons per year or more.\u201d See post, at 7. The two could scarcely\nbe further apart. As we have explained (and as EPA agrees), statutory\ncontext makes plain that the Act\u2019s operative provisions use \u201cair pollu-\ntant\u201d to denote less than the full range of pollutants covered by the Act-\nwide definition. See Part II\u2013A\u20131, supra. It is therefore incumbent on\nEPA to specify the pollutants encompassed by that term in the context\nof a particular program, and to do so reasonably in light of that pro-\ngram\u2019s overall regulatory scheme. But there is no ambiguity whatso-\never in the specific, numerical permitting thresholds, and thus no room\nfor EPA to exercise discretion in selecting a different threshold.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

BACT, they say,\nhas traditionally been about end-of-stack controls \u201csuch as\ncatalytic converters or particle collectors\u201d; but applying it\nto greenhouse gases will make it more about regulating\nenergy use, which will enable regulators to control \u201cevery\naspect of a facility\u2019s operation and design,\u201d right down to\nthe \u201clight bulbs in the factory cafeteria.\u201d Brief for Peti-\ntioner Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on\nGreenhouse Gas Regulation et al. in No. 12\u20131254, p. 7; see\nJoint Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 12\u20131248 etc., pp.\n26        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

Reg.\n51947 (1979); accordingly, EPA acknowledges that BACT\nmay not be used to require \u201creductions in a facility\u2019s de-\nmand for energy from the electric grid.\u201d Guidance 24.\nFinally, EPA\u2019s guidance suggests that BACT should not\nrequire every conceivable change that could result in\nminor improvements in energy efficiency, such as the\naforementioned light bulbs. Id., at 31. The guidance\nexplains that permitting authorities should instead con-\nsider whether a proposed regulatory burden outweighs\nany reduction in emissions to be achieved, and should\nconcentrate on the facility\u2019s equipment that uses the\nlargest amounts of energy. Ibid.\n                             2\n   The question before us is whether EPA\u2019s decision to\nrequire BACT for greenhouse gases emitted by sources\notherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a\npermissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron.\nWe conclude that it is.\n   The text of the BACT provision is far less open-ended\nthan the text of the PSD and Title V permitting triggers.\nIt states that BACT is required \u201cfor each pollutant subject\nto regulation under this chapter\u201d (i.e., the entire Act),\n\u00a77475(a)(4), a phrase that\u2014as the D. C. Circuit wrote 35\nyears ago\u2014\u201cwould not seem readily susceptible [of] misin-\nterpretation.\u201d Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F. 2d 323,\n404 (1979). Whereas the dubious breadth of \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d in the permitting triggers suggests a role for\nagency judgment in identifying the subset of pollutants\ncovered by the particular regulatory program at issue, the\nmore specific phrasing of the BACT provision suggests\nthat the necessary judgment has already been made by\nCongress. The wider statutory context likewise does not\n28        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuggest that the BACT provision can bear a narrowing\nconstruction: There is no indication that the Act elsewhere\nuses, or that EPA has interpreted, \u201ceach pollutant subject\nto regulation under this chapter\u201d to mean anything other\nthan what it says.\n   Even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to\ngreenhouse gases is not so disastrously unworkable, and\nneed not result in such a dramatic expansion of agency\nauthority, as to convince us that EPA\u2019s interpretation is\nunreasonable. We are not talking about extending EPA\njurisdiction over millions of previously unregulated enti-\nties, but about moderately increasing the demands EPA\n(or a state permitting authority) can make of entities\nalready subject to its regulation. And it is not yet clear\nthat EPA\u2019s demands will be of a significantly different\ncharacter from those traditionally associated with PSD\nreview. In short, the record before us does not establish\nthat the BACT provision as written is incapable of being\nsensibly applied to greenhouse gases.\n   We acknowledge the potential for greenhouse-gas BACT\nto lead to an unreasonable and unanticipated degree of\nregulation, and our decision should not be taken as an\nendorsement of all aspects of EPA\u2019s current approach, nor\nas a free rein for any future regulatory application of\nBACT in this distinct context. Our narrow holding is that\nnothing in the statute categorically prohibits EPA from\ninterpreting the BACT provision to apply to greenhouse\ngases emitted by \u201canyway\u201d sources.\n   However, EPA may require an \u201canyway\u201d source to com-\nply with greenhouse-gas BACT only if the source emits\nmore than a de minimis amount of greenhouse gases. As\nnoted above, the Tailoring Rule applies BACT only if a\nsource emits greenhouse gases in excess of 75,000 tons per\nyear CO2e, but the Rule makes clear that EPA did not\narrive at that number by identifying the de minimis level.\nSee nn. 1, 3, supra.

We do not hold that\n75,000 tons per year CO2e necessarily exceeds a true de\nminimis level, only that EPA must justify its selection on\nproper grounds. Cf. Alabama Power, supra, at 405.9\n                        *     *    *\n   To sum up: We hold that EPA exceeded its statutory\nauthority when it interpreted the Clean Air Act to require\nPSD and Title V permitting for stationary sources based\non their greenhouse-gas emissions. Specifically, the Agency\nmay not treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant for pur-\nposes of defining a \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d (or a \u201cmodifi-\ncation\u201d thereof) in the PSD context or a \u201cmajor source\u201d in\nthe Title V context. To the extent its regulations purport\nto do so, they are invalid. EPA may, however, continue to\ntreat greenhouse gases as a \u201cpollutant subject to regula-\ntion under this chapter\u201d for purposes of requiring BACT\nfor \u201canyway\u201d sources. The judgment of the Court of Ap-\npeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 JUSTICE ALITO argues that BACT is \u201cfundamentally incompatible\u201d\n\nwith greenhouse gases for two reasons. Post, at 4 (opinion concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). First, BACT requires consideration of\n\u201cambient air quality at the proposed site and in areas which may be\naffected by emissions from [the proposed] facility for each pollutant\nsubject to regulation under this chapter,\u201d \u00a77475(e)(1); see also\n\u00a77475(e)(3)(B); and it is not obvious how that requirement should apply,\nor even whether it can apply, to greenhouse gases. Post, at 4\u20135. But\nthe possibility that that requirement may be inoperative as to green-\nhouse gases does not convince us that they must be categorically\nexcluded from BACT even though they are indisputably a \u201cpollutant\nsubject to regulation.\u201d Second, JUSTICE ALITO argues that EPA\u2019s\nguidance on how to implement greenhouse-gas BACT is a recipe for\n\u201carbitrary and inconsistent decisionmaking.\u201d Post, at 8. But we are not\nreviewing EPA\u2019s guidance in these cases, and we cannot say that it is\nimpossible for EPA and state permitting authorities to devise rational\nways of complying with the statute\u2019s directive to determine BACT for\ngreenhouse gases \u201con a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy,\nenvironmental, and economic impacts and other costs.\u201d \u00a77479(3).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), we held\nthat greenhouse gases fall within the Clean Air Act\u2019s\ngeneral definition of the term \u201cair pollutant,\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a77602(g). 549 U. S., at 528\u2013529. We also held, conse-\nquently, that the Environmental Protection Agency is\nempowered and required by Title II of the Act to regulate\ngreenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources (such as\ncars and trucks) if it decides that greenhouse gases \u201ccon-\ntribute to . . . air pollution which may reasonably be antic-\nipated to endanger public health or welfare,\u201d \u00a77521(a)(1).\n549 U. S., at 532\u2013533. The EPA determined that green-\nhouse gases endanger human health and welfare, 74 Fed.\nReg. 66496 (2009) (Endangerment Finding), and so it\nissued regulations for mobile emissions, 75 Fed. Reg.\n25324 (2010) (Tailpipe Rule).\n   These cases take as a given our decision in Massachu-\nsetts that the Act\u2019s general definition of \u201cair pollutant\u201d\nincludes greenhouse gases. One of the questions posed by\nthese cases is whether those gases fall within the scope of\nthe phrase \u201cany air pollutant\u201d as that phrase is used in the\nmore specific provisions of the Act here at issue. The\nCourt\u2019s answer is \u201cno.\u201d Ante, at 10\u201324. I disagree.\n   The Clean Air Act provisions at issue here are Title I\u2019s\nPrevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program,\n\u00a77470 et seq., and Title V\u2019s permitting regime, \u00a77661 et\nseq. By contrast to Title II, Titles I and V apply to sta-\ntionary sources, such as power plants and factories. Un-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nder the PSD program, \u201cmajor emitting facilities\u201d con-\nstructed in the United States must meet certain require-\nments, including obtaining a permit that imposes emis-\nsions limitations, \u00a77475(a)(1), and using \u201cthe best\navailable control technology for each pollutant subject to\nregulation under [the Act] emitted from\u201d the facility,\n\u00a77475(a)(4). Title V requires each \u201cmajor source\u201d to obtain\nan operating permit. \u00a77661a(a).\n  These cases concern the definitions of \u201cmajor emitting\nfacility\u201d and \u201cmajor source,\u201d each of which is defined to\nmean any stationary source that emits more than a\nthreshold quantity of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d See \u00a77479(1)\n(\u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d); \u00a7\u00a77602(j), 7661(2)(B) (\u201cmajor\nsource\u201d). To simplify the exposition, I will refer only to the\nPSD program and its definition of \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d;\na parallel analysis applies to Title V.\n  As it is used in the PSD provisions,\n    \u201c[t]he term \u2018major emitting facility\u2019 means any of [a\n    list of specific categories of] stationary sources of air\n    pollutants which emit, or have the potential to emit,\n    one hundred tons per year or more of any air pollutant\n    . . . . Such term also includes any other source with\n    the potential to emit two hundred and fifty tons per\n    year or more of any air pollutant.\u201d \u00a77479(1).\nTo simplify further, I will ignore the reference to specific\ntypes of source that emit at least 100 tons per year (tpy) of\nany air pollutant. In effect, we are dealing with a statute\nthat says that the PSD program\u2019s regulatory requirements\nmust be applied to\n    \u201cany stationary source that has the potential to emit\n    two hundred fifty tons per year or more of any air\n    pollutant.\u201d\n  The interpretive difficulty in these cases arises out of\nthe definition\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ctwo hundred fifty tons\n4         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nper year or more,\u201d which I will call the \u201c250 tpy threshold.\u201d\nWhen applied to greenhouse gases, 250 tpy is far too low a\nthreshold. As the Court explains, tens of thousands of\nstationary sources emit large quantities of one greenhouse\ngas, carbon dioxide. See ante, at 17\u201320, and n. 7. To\napply the programs at issue here to all those sources\nwould be extremely expensive and burdensome, counter-\nproductive, and perhaps impossible; it would also contra-\nvene Congress\u2019s intent that the programs\u2019 coverage be\nlimited to those large sources whose emissions are sub-\nstantial enough to justify the regulatory burdens. Ibid.\nThe EPA recognized as much, and it addressed the prob-\nlem by issuing a regulation\u2014the Tailoring Rule\u2014that\npurports to raise the coverage threshold for greenhouse\ngases from the statutory figure of 250 tpy to 100,000 tpy\nin order to keep the programs\u2019 coverage limited to \u201ca rela-\ntively small number of large industrial sources.\u201d 75 Fed.\nReg. 31514, 31555 (2010); see id., at 31523\u201331524.\n   The Tailoring Rule solves the practical problems that\nwould have been caused by the 250 tpy threshold. But\nwhat are we to do about the statute\u2019s language? The\nstatute specifies a definite number\u2014250, not 100,000\u2014\nand it says that facilities that are covered by that number\nmust meet the program\u2019s requirements. The statute says\nnothing about agency discretion to change that number.\nWhat is to be done? How, given the statute\u2019s language,\ncan the EPA exempt from regulation sources that emit\nmore than 250 but less than 100,000 tpy of greenhouse\ngases (and that also do not emit other regulated pollutants\nat threshold levels)?\n   The Court answers by (1) pointing out that regulation at\nthe 250 tpy threshold would produce absurd results, (2)\nrefusing to read the statute as compelling such results,\nand (3) consequently interpreting the phrase \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d as containing an implicit exception for green-\nhouse gases.

FCC v. NextWave Personal Communications\nInc., 537 U. S. 293, 311 (2003) (BREYER, J., dissenting)\n(\u201c \u2018Tell all customers that . . .\u2019 does not refer to every cus-\ntomer of every business in the world\u201d). Rather, \u201c[g]eneral\nterms as used on particular occasions often carry with\nthem implied restrictions as to scope,\u201d ibid., and so courts\nmust interpret the word \u201cany,\u201d like all other words, in\ncontext. As Judge Learned Hand pointed out when inter-\npreting another statute many years ago, \u201c[w]e can best\nreach the meaning here, as always, by recourse to the\nunderlying purpose, and, with that as a guide, by trying to\nproject upon the specific occasion how we think persons,\nactuated by such a purpose, would have dealt with it, if it\nhad been presented to them at the time.\u201d Borella v. Bor-\nden Co., 145 F. 2d 63, 64 (CA2 1944). The pursuit of that\nunderlying purpose may sometimes require us to \u201caban-\ndon\u201d a \u201cliteral interpretation\u201d of a word like \u201cany.\u201d Id., at\n64\u201365.\n6         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

Legal\nphilosophers like to point out that a statute providing that\n\u201c \u2018[w]hoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be\npunished by death\u2019 \u201d need not encompass a man who kills\nin self-defense; nor must an ordinance imposing fines upon\nthose who occupy a public parking spot for more than two\nhours penalize a driver who is unable to move because of a\nparade. See Fuller, The Case of the Speluncean Explorers,\n62 Harv. L. Rev. 616, 619, 624 (1949); see also United\nStates v. Kirby, 7 Wall. 482, 485\u2013487 (1869) (holding that\na statute forbidding knowing and willful obstruction of the\nmail contains an implicit exception permitting a local\nsheriff to arrest a mail carrier). The maxim cessante\nratione legis cessat ipse lex\u2014where a law\u2019s rationale ceases\nto apply, so does the law itself\u2014is not of recent origin.\nSee, e.g., Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.

(\u201ccessante ratione, cessat ipsa\nlex\u201d).\n    I also agree with the Court\u2019s point that \u201ca generic refer-\nence to air pollutants\u201d in the Clean Air Act need not \u201cen-\ncompass every substance falling within the Act-wide\ndefinition\u201d that we construed in Massachusetts, \u00a77602(g).\nSee ante, at 12\u201313. As the Court notes, the EPA has\ninterpreted the phrase \u201cany air pollutant,\u201d which is used\nseveral times in the Act, as limited to \u201cair pollutants for\nwhich EPA has promulgated [new source performance\nstandards]\u201d in the portion of the Act dealing with those\nstandards, as limited to \u201cvisibility-impairing air pollu-\ntants\u201d in the part of the Act concerned with deleterious\neffects on visibility, and as limited to \u201cpollutants for which\nthe area is designated nonattainment\u201d in the part of the\nAct aimed at regions that fail to attain air quality stand-\nards.

As a linguistic matter, one can just as\neasily read an implicit exception for small-scale green-\nhouse gas emissions into the phrase \u201cany source\u201d as into\nthe phrase \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d And given the purposes of\nthe PSD program and the Act as a whole, as well as the\nspecific roles of the different parts of the statutory defini-\ntion, finding flexibility in \u201cany source\u201d is far more sensible\nthan the Court\u2019s route of finding it in \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d\n   The implicit exception I propose reads almost word for\nword the same as the Court\u2019s, except that the location of\nthe exception has shifted. To repeat, the Court reads the\ndefinition of \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d as if it referred to\n\u201cany source with the potential to emit two hundred fifty\ntons per year or more of any air pollutant except for those\nair pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, with respect to\nwhich regulation at that threshold would be impractical or\nabsurd or would sweep in smaller sources that Congress\ndid not mean to cover.\u201d I would simply move the implicit\nexception, which I\u2019ve italicized, so that it applies to\n\u201csource\u201d rather than \u201cair pollutant\u201d: \u201cany source with the\npotential to emit two hundred fifty tons per year or more\nof any air pollutant except for those sources, such as those\nemitting unmanageably small amounts of greenhouse\ngases, with respect to which regulation at that threshold\nwould be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller\nsources that Congress did not mean to cover.\u201d\n   From a legal, administrative, and functional perspec-\ntive\u2014that is, from a perspective that assumes that Con-\ngress was not merely trying to arrange words on paper but\n8         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

For one\nthing, my reading is consistent with the specific purpose\nunderlying the 250 tpy threshold specified by the statute.\nThe purpose of that number was not to prevent the regula-\ntion of dangerous air pollutants that cannot be sensibly\nregulated at that particular threshold, though that is the\neffect that the Court\u2019s reading gives the threshold. Ra-\nther, the purpose was to limit the PSD program\u2019s obliga-\ntions to larger sources while exempting the many small\nsources whose emissions are low enough that imposing\nburdensome regulatory requirements on them would be\nsenseless.\n   Thus, the accompanying Senate Report explains that\nthe PSD program \u201cis reasonable and necessary for very\nlarge sources, such as new electrical generating plants or\nnew steel mills. But the procedure would prove costly and\npotentially unreasonable if imposed on construction of\nstorage facilities for a small gasoline jobber or on the\nconstruction of a new heating plant at a junior college.\u201d\nS.

Congress\u2019s mecha-\n    nism for limiting PSD was the 100/250 tpy threshold\n    limitations. Focused as it was primarily on NAAQS\n    pollutants [that is, those air pollutants for which the\n    EPA has issued a national ambient air quality stand-\n    ard under Title I of the Act, see EPA v. EME Homer\n    City Generation, L. P., 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\n    op., at 4)], Congress considered sources that emit\n    NAAQS pollutants in those quantities generally to be\n    the large industrial sources to which it intended PSD\n    to be limited.\u201d Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. 31555.\n   The Court similarly acknowledges that \u201cthe PSD pro-\ngram and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot\nrationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large\nsources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and\nprocedural burdens.\u201d Ante, at 18; see also Alabama Power\nCo. v. Costle, 636 F. 2d 323, 353 (CADC 1979) (\u201cCongress\u2019s\nintention was to identify facilities which, due to their size,\nare financially able to bear the substantial regulatory\ncosts imposed by the PSD provisions and which, as a\ngroup, are primarily responsible for emission of the delete-\nrious pollutants that befoul our nation\u2019s air\u201d).\n   An implicit source-related exception would serve this\nstatutory purpose while going no further. The implicit\nexception that the Court reads into the phrase \u201cany air\npollutant,\u201d by contrast, goes well beyond the limited con-\ngressional objective. Nothing in the statutory text, the\nlegislative history, or common sense suggests that Con-\ngress, when it imposed the 250 tpy threshold, was trying\nto undermine its own deliberate decision to use the broad\nlanguage \u201cany air pollutant\u201d by removing some substances\n(rather than some facilities) from the PSD program\u2019s\ncoverage.\n   For another thing, a source-related exception serves the\nflexible nature of the Clean Air Act. We observed in Mas-\n10        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nsachusetts that \u201c[w]hile the Congresses that drafted\u201d the\nAct \u201cmight not have appreciated the possibility that burn-\ning fossil fuels could lead to global warming, they did\nunderstand that without regulatory flexibility, changing\ncircumstances and scientific developments would soon\nrender the Clean Air Act obsolete.\u201d 549 U. S., at 532. We\nrecognized that \u201c[t]he broad language of \u201d the Act-wide\ndefinition of \u201cair pollutant\u201d \u201creflects an intentional effort\nto confer the flexibility necessary to forestall such obsoles-\ncence.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court\u2019s decision to read greenhouse gases out of the\nPSD program drains the Act of its flexibility and chips\naway at our decision in Massachusetts. What sense does it\nmake to read the Act as generally granting the EPA the\nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and then\nto read it as denying that power with respect to the pro-\ngrams for large stationary sources at issue here? It is\nanomalous to read the Act to require the EPA to regulate\nair pollutants that pose previously unforeseen threats to\nhuman health and welfare where \u201c250 tons per year\u201d is a\nsensible regulatory line but not where, by chemical or\nregulatory happenstance, a higher line must be drawn.\nAnd it is anomalous to read an unwritten exception into\nthe more important phrase of the statutory definition\n(\u201cany air pollutant\u201d) when a similar unwritten exception to\nless important language (the particular number used by\nthe statute) will do just as well. The implicit exception\npreferred by the Court produces all of these anomalies,\nwhile the source-related exception I propose creates none\nof them.\n   In addition, the interpretation I propose leaves the EPA\nwith the sort of discretion as to interstitial matters that\nCongress likely intended it to retain. My interpretation\ngives the EPA nothing more than the authority to exempt\nsources from regulation insofar as the Agency reasonably\ndetermines that applying the PSD program to them would\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

That sort of decision, which involves the Agency\u2019s\ntechnical expertise and administrative experience, is the\nkind of decision that Congress typically leaves to the\nagencies to make. Cf. Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212,\n222 (2002) (enumerating factors that we take to indicate\nthat Congress intends the agency to exercise the discre-\ntion provided by Chevron). To read the Act to grant that\ndiscretion here is to read it as furthering Congress\u2019s (and\nthe public\u2019s) interest in more effective, less wasteful\nregulation.\n   Last, but by no means least, a source-related exception\nadvances the Act\u2019s overall purpose. That broad purpose,\nas set forth at the beginning of the statute, is \u201cto protect\nand enhance the quality of the Nation\u2019s air resources so as\nto promote the public health and welfare and the produc-\ntive capacity of its population.\u201d \u00a77401(b)(1); see also\n\u00a77470(1) (A purpose of the PSD program in particular\nis \u201cto protect public health and welfare from any actual\nor potential adverse effect which in the Administra-\ntor\u2019s judgment may reasonably be anticipate[d] to occur\nfrom air pollution\u201d); \u00a77602(h) (\u201cAll language [in the Act]\nreferring to effects on welfare includes . . . effects on . . .\nweather . . . and climate\u201d). The expert agency charged\nwith administering the Act has determined in its En-\ndangerment Finding that greenhouse gases endanger\nhuman health and welfare, and so sensible regulation of\nindustrial emissions of those pollutants is at the core of\nthe purpose behind the Act. The broad \u201cno greenhouse\ngases\u201d exception that the Court reads into the statute\nunnecessarily undercuts that purpose, while my narrow\nsource-related exception would leave the Agency with the\ntools it needs to further it.\n                      *     *     *\n  I agree with the Court\u2019s holding that stationary sources\n12        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), this\nCourt considered whether greenhouse gases fall within the\nClean Air Act\u2019s general definition of an air \u201cpollutant.\u201d\nId., at 528\u2013529. The Environmental Protection Agency\ncautioned us that \u201ckey provisions of the [Act] cannot co-\ngently be applied to [greenhouse gas] emissions,\u201d Brief for\nFederal Respondent in Massachusetts v. EPA, O. T. 2006,\nNo. 05\u20131120, p. 22, but the Court brushed the warning\naside and had \u201clittle trouble\u201d concluding that the Act\u2019s\n\u201csweeping definition\u201d of a pollutant encompasses green-\nhouse gases. 549 U. S., at 528\u2013529. I believed Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA was wrongly decided at the time, and these\ncases further expose the flaws with that decision.\n                              I\n  As the present cases now show, trying to fit greenhouse\ngases into \u201ckey provisions\u201d of the Clean Air Act involves\nmore than a \u201clittle trouble.\u201d These cases concern the\nprovisions of the Act relating to the \u201cPrevention of Signifi-\ncant Deterioration\u201d (PSD), 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77470\u20137492, as\nwell as Title V of the Act, \u00a77661. And in order to make\nthose provisions apply to greenhouse gases in a way that\ndoes not produce absurd results, the EPA effectively\namended the Act. The Act contains specific emissions\nthresholds that trigger PSD and Title V coverage, but the\nEPA crossed out the figures enacted by Congress and\nsubstituted figures of its own.\n  I agree with the Court that the EPA is neither required\nnor permitted to take this extraordinary step, and I there-\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Neither is\nconvincing.\n                              A\n   With respect to the text, it is curious that the Court,\nhaving departed from a literal interpretation of the term\n\u201cpollutant\u201d in Part II\u2013A, turns on its heels and adopts a\nliteral interpretation in Part II\u2013B. The coverage thresh-\nolds at issue in Part II\u2013A apply to any \u201cpollutant.\u201d The\nAct\u2019s general definition of this term is broad, and in Mas-\nsachusetts v. EPA, supra, the Court held that this defini-\ntion covers greenhouse gases. The Court does not disturb\nthat holding, but it nevertheless concludes that, as used in\nthe provision triggering PSD coverage, the term \u201cpollu-\ntant\u201d actually means \u201cpollutant, other than a greenhouse\ngas.\u201d\n   In Part II\u2013B, the relevant statutory provision says\nthat BACT must be installed for any \u201cpollutant subject\nto regulation under [the Act].\u201d \u00a77475(a)(4). If the term\n\u201cpollutant\u201d means \u201cpollutant, other than a greenhouse\ngas,\u201d as the Court effectively concludes in Part II\u2013A, the\nterm \u201cpollutant subject to regulation under [the Act]\u201d in\n\u00a77475(a)(4) should mean \u201cpollutant, other than a green-\n4         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nhouse gas, subject to regulation under [the Act], and that\nis subject to regulation under [the Act].\u201d The Court\u2019s\nliteralism is selective, and it results in a strange and\ndisjointed regulatory scheme.\n   Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, a source can emit an\nunlimited quantity of greenhouse gases without triggering\nthe need for a PSD permit. Why might Congress have\nwanted to allow this? The most likely explanation is that\nthe PSD permitting process is simply not suited for use in\nregulating this particular pollutant. And if that is so, it\nmakes little sense to require the installation of BACT for\ngreenhouse gases in those instances in which a source\nhappens to be required to obtain a permit due to the emis-\nsion of a qualifying quantity of some other pollutant that\nis regulated under the Act.\n                             B\n  The Court\u2019s second reason for holding that BACT ap-\nplies to \u201canyway\u201d sources is its belief that this can be done\nwithout disastrous consequences. Only time will tell\nwhether this hope is well founded, but it seems clear that\nBACT analysis is fundamentally incompatible with the\nregulation of greenhouse-gas emissions for at least two\nimportant reasons.\n                             1\n  First, BACT looks to the effects of covered pollutants in\nthe area in which a source is located. The PSD program is\nimplemented through \u201cemission limitations and such\nother measures\u201d as are \u201cnecessary . . . to prevent signifi-\ncant deterioration of air quality in each region.\u201d \u00a77471\n(emphasis added). The Clean Air Act provides that BACT\nmust be identified \u201con a case-by-case basis,\u201d \u00a77479(3), and\nthis necessarily means that local conditions must be taken\ninto account. For this reason, the Act instructs the EPA to\nissue regulations requiring an analysis of \u201cthe ambient air\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nquality . . . at the site of the proposed major emitting facil-\nity and in the area potentially affected by the emissions\nfrom such facility for each pollutant regulated under [the\nAct].\u201d \u00a77475(e)(3)(B) (emphasis added). The Act also\nrequires a public hearing on \u201cthe air quality at the pro-\nposed site and in areas which may be affected by emissions\nfrom such facility for each pollutant subject to regulation\nunder [the Act] which will be emitted from such facility.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a77475(a)(2), (e)(1) (emphasis added). Accordingly, if\nBACT is required for greenhouse gases, the Act demands\nthat the impact of these gases in the area surrounding a\nsite must be monitored, explored at a public hearing, and\nconsidered as part of the permitting process. The effects of\ngreenhouse gases, however, are global, not local. See PSD\nand Title V Permitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases\n41\u201342 (Mar. 2011) (hereinafter Guidance). As a result, the\nEPA has declared that PSD permit applicants and permit-\nting officials may disregard these provisions of the Act. 75\nFed. Reg. 31520 (2010).\n                             2\n  Second, as part of the case-by-case analysis required by\nBACT, a permitting authority must balance the environ-\nmental benefit expected to result from the installation of\nan available control measure against adverse consequences\nthat may result, including any negative impact on the\nenvironment, energy conservation, and the economy. And\nthe EPA itself has admitted that this cannot be done on a\ncase-by-case basis with respect to greenhouse gases.\n  The Clean Air Act makes it clear that BACT must be\ndetermined on a \u201ccase-by-case basis, taking into account\nenergy, environmental, and economic impacts and other\ncosts.\u201d \u00a77479(3). To implement this directive, the EPA\nadopted a five-step framework for making a BACT deter-\nmination. See New Source Review Workshop Manual:\nPrevention of Significant Deterioration and Nonattain-\n6            UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nment Area Permitting (Oct. 1990).1 Under the fourth step\nof this analysis, potentially applicable and feasible control\ntechnologies that are candidates for selection as BACT for\na particular source are eliminated from consideration\nbased on their \u201ccollateral impacts,\u201d such as any adverse\nenvironmental effects or adverse effects on energy con-\nsumption or the economy.\n   More recently, the EPA provided guidance to permitting\nauthorities regarding the treatment of greenhouse-gas\nemissions under this framework, and the EPA\u2019s guidance\ndemonstrates the insuperable problem that results when\nan attempt is made to apply this framework to greenhouse\ngas emissions. As noted above, at step 4 of the framework,\na permitting authority must balance the positive effect\nlikely to result from requiring a particular source to install\na particular technology against a variety of negative ef-\nfects that are likely to occur if that step is taken. But\nin the case of greenhouse gases, how can a permit-\nting authority make this individualized, source-specific\ndetermination?\n   The EPA instructs permitting authorities to take into\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        EPA describes these steps as follows:\n  (1) The applicant must identify all available control options that are\npotentially applicable by consulting EPA\u2019s BACT clearinghouse along\nwith other reliable sources.\n  (2) The technical feasibility of the control options identified in step 1\nare eliminated based on technical infeasibility.\n  (3) The control technologies are ranked based on control effective-\nness, by considering: the percentage of the pollutant removed; expected\nemission rate for each new source review (NSR) pollutant; expected\nemission reduction for each regulated NSR pollutant; and output based\nemissions limit.\n  (4) Control technologies are eliminated based on collateral impacts,\nsuch as: energy impacts; other environmental impacts; solid or hazard-\nous waste; water discharge from control device; emissions of air toxics\nand other non-NSR regulated pollutants; and economic impacts.\n  (5) The most effective control option not eliminated in step 4 is\nproposed as BACT for the pollutant and emission unit under review.\n                   Cite as: 573 U.

These include an increased risk\nof dangerous heat waves, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and\ndrought, as well as risks to agriculture, forestry, and\nwater resources. Guidance 40\u201341. But the EPA admits\nthat it is simply not possible for a permitting authority to\ncalculate in any meaningful way the degree to which any\npotential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from any\nindividual source might reduce these risks. And without\nmaking such a calculation in even a very rough way, a\npermitting authority cannot do what the Clean Air Act\nand the EPA\u2019s framework demand\u2014compare the benefits\nof some specified reduction in the emission of greenhouse\ngases from a particular source with any adverse environ-\nmental or economic effects that might result from mandat-\ning such a reduction.\n   Suppose, for example, that a permitting authority must\ndecide whether to mandate a change that both decreases a\nsource\u2019s emission of greenhouse gases and increases its\nemission of a conventional pollutant that has a negative\neffect on public health. How should a permitting authority\ndecide whether to require this change? Here is the EPA\u2019s\nadvice:\n    \u201c[W]hen considering the trade-offs between the envi-\n    ronmental impacts of a particular level of GHG\n    [greenhouse gas] reduction and a collateral increase in\n    another regulated NSR pollutant,[2] rather than at-\n    tempting to determine or characterize specific envi-\n    ronmental impacts from GHGs emitted at particular\n    locations, EPA recommends that permitting authori-\n    ties focus on the amount of GHG emission reductions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 \u201cNew source review pollutants\u201d are those pollutants for which a\n\nNational Ambient Air Quality standard has been set and a few others,\nsuch as sulphur dioxide. See 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxvii) (2013).\n8             UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n       that may be gained or lost by employing a particular\n       control strategy and how that compares to the envi-\n       ronmental or other impacts resulting from the collat-\n       eral emissions increase of other regulated NSR pollu-\n       tants.\u201d Guidance 42.\n   As best I can make out, what this means is that permit-\nting authorities should not even try to assess the net\nimpact on public health. Instead of comparing the positive\nand negative public health effects of a particular option,\npermitting authorities are instructed to compare the\nadverse public health effects of increasing the emissions of\nthe conventional pollutants with the amount of the reduc-\ntion of the source\u2019s emissions of greenhouse gases. But\nwithout knowing the positive effects of the latter, this is a\nmeaningless comparison.\n   The EPA tries to ameliorate this problem by noting that\npermitting authorities are entitled to \u201ca great deal of\ndiscretion,\u201d Guidance 41, but without a comprehensible\nstandard, what this will mean is arbitrary and incon-\nsistent decisionmaking.

The Act\u2019s \u201cPrevention of\n  Significant Deterioration\u201d (PSD) provisions make it unlawful to con-\n  struct or modify a \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d in \u201cany area to which [the\n  PSD program] applies\u201d without a permit. \u00a7\u00a77475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C). A\n  \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d is a stationary source with the potential to\n  emit 250 tons per year of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d (or 100 tons per year for\n  certain types of sources). \u00a77479(1). Facilities seeking to qualify for a\n  PSD permit must, inter alia, comply with emissions limitations that\n  reflect the \u201cbest available control technology\u201d (BACT) for \u201ceach pollu-\n  tant subject to regulation under\u201d the Act. \u00a77475(a)(4). In addition,\n  Title V of the Act makes it unlawful to operate any \u201cmajor source,\u201d\n  wherever located, without a permit. \u00a77661a(a). A \u201cmajor source\u201d is a\n  stationary source with the potential to emit 100 tons per year of \u201cany\n  air pollutant.\u201d \u00a7\u00a77661(2)(B), 7602(j).\n     In response to Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, EPA promul-\n  gated greenhouse-gas emission standards for new motor vehicles, and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 12\u20131248, American Chemistry Council et al. v.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency et al., No. 12\u20131254, Energy-Intensive\nManufacturers Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Regulation et al. v.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency et al., No. 12\u20131268, Southeastern Le-\ngal Foundation, Inc., et al. v.

EPA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    made stationary sources subject to the PSD program and Title V on\n    the basis of their potential to emit greenhouse gases. It recognized,\n    however, that requiring permits for all sources with greenhouse-gas\n    emissions above the statutory thresholds would radically expand\n    those programs and render them unadministrable. So EPA purport-\n    ed to \u201ctailor\u201d the programs to accommodate greenhouse gases by\n    providing, among other things, that sources would not become newly\n    subject to PSD or Title V permitting on the basis of their potential to\n    emit greenhouse gases in amounts less than 100,000 tons per year.\n       Numerous parties, including several States, challenged EPA\u2019s ac-\n    tions in the D. C. Circuit, which dismissed some of the petitions for\n    lack of jurisdiction and denied the remainder.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n684 F. 3d 102, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I and II, concluding:\n    1. The Act neither compels nor permits EPA to adopt an interpre-\n  tation of the Act requiring a source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit\n  on the sole basis of its potential greenhouse-gas emissions. Pp. 10\u2013\n  24.\n       (a) The Act does not compel EPA\u2019s interpretation. Massachusetts\n  held that the Act-wide definition of \u201cair pollutant\u201d includes green-\n  house gases, 549 U. S., at 529, but where the term \u201cair pollutant\u201d ap-\n  pears in the Act\u2019s operative provisions, including the PSD and Title V\n  permitting provisions, EPA has routinely given it a narrower, con-\n  text-appropriate meaning. Massachusetts did not invalidate those\n  longstanding constructions. The Act-wide definition is not a com-\n  mand to regulate, but a description of the universe of substances EPA\n  may consider regulating under the Act\u2019s operative provisions.\n  Though Congress\u2019s profligate use of \u201cair pollutant\u201d is not conducive to\n  clarity, the presumption of consistent usage \u201c \u2018readily yields\u2019 \u201d to con-\n  text, and a statutory term \u201cmay take on distinct characters from as-\n  sociation with distinct statutory objects calling for different imple-\n  mentation strategies.\u201d Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp.,\n  549 U. S. 561, 574. Pp. 10\u201316.\n       (b) Nor does the Act permit EPA\u2019s interpretation. Agencies em-\n  powered to resolve statutory ambiguities must operate \u201cwithin the\n  bounds of reasonable interpretation,\u201d Arlington v. FCC, 569 U. S. ___,\n  ___. EPA has repeatedly acknowledged that applying the PSD and\n  Title V permitting requirements to greenhouse gases would be incon-\n  sistent with the Act\u2019s structure and design. A review of the relevant\n  statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD program and Title\n  V are designed to apply to, and cannot rationally be extended beyond,\n  a relative handful of large sources capable of shouldering heavy sub-\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

EPA\u2019s interpretation would also\n  bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in EPA\u2019s\n  regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization. FDA\n  v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 160. Pp. 16\u201320.\n        (c) EPA lacked authority to \u201ctailor\u201d the Act\u2019s unambiguous nu-\n  merical thresholds of 100 or 250 tons per year to accommodate its\n  greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the permitting triggers.\n  Agencies must always \u201c \u2018give effect to the unambiguously expressed\n  intent of Congress.\u2019 \u201d National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders\n  of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 665. The power to execute the laws does\n  not include a power to revise clear statutory terms that turn out not\n  to work in practice. Pp. 20\u201324.\n     2. EPA reasonably interpreted the Act to require sources that\n  would need permits based on their emission of conventional pollu-\n  tants to comply with BACT for greenhouse gases. Pp. 24\u201329.\n        (a) Concerns that BACT, which has traditionally been about end-\n  of-stack controls, is fundamentally unsuited to greenhouse-gas regu-\n  lation, which is more about energy use, are not unfounded. But an\n  EPA guidance document states that BACT analysis should consider\n  options other than energy efficiency, including \u201ccarbon capture and\n  storage,\u201d which EPA contends is reasonably comparable to more tra-\n  ditional, end-of-stack BACT technologies. Moreover, assuming that\n  BACT may be used to force improvements in energy efficiency, im-\n  portant limitations on BACT may work to mitigate concerns about\n  \u201cunbounded\u201d regulatory authority. Pp. 24\u201327.\n        (b) EPA\u2019s decision to require BACT for greenhouse gases emitted\n  by sources otherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a\n  permissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron U. S. A. Inc.\n  v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. The specif-\n  ic phrasing of the BACT provision\u2014which requires BACT \u201cfor each\n  pollutant subject to regulation under\u201d the Act, \u00a77475(a)(4)\u2014does not\n  suggest that the provision can bear a narrowing construction. And\n  even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to greenhouse gases is\n  not so disastrously unworkable, and need not result in such a dra-\n  matic expansion of agency authority, as to make EPA\u2019s interpretation\n  unreasonable.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a77401\u20137671q, the Environmental\nProtection Agency recently set standards for emissions of\n\u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (substances it believes contribute to\n\u201cglobal climate change\u201d) from new motor vehicles. We\nmust decide whether it was permissible for EPA to deter-\nmine that its motor-vehicle greenhouse-gas regulations\nautomatically triggered permitting requirements under\nthe Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases.\n                       I. Background\n              A. Stationary-Source Permitting\n   The Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating emis-\nsions from both stationary sources, such as factories and\npowerplants, and moving sources, such as cars, trucks,\nand aircraft. This litigation concerns permitting obliga-\ntions imposed on stationary sources under Titles I and V\nof the Act.\n   Title I charges EPA with formulating national ambient\nair quality standards (NAAQS) for air pollutants. \u00a7\u00a77408\u2013\n7409. To date, EPA has issued NAAQS for six pollutants:\nsulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon\nmonoxide, ozone, and lead. Clean Air Act Handbook 125\n(J. Domike & A. Zacaroli eds., 3d ed. 2011); see generally\n40 CFR pt. 50 (2013). States have primary responsibility\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor implementing the NAAQS by developing \u201cState imple-\nmentation plans.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77410. A State must desig-\nnate every area within its borders as \u201cattainment,\u201d \u201cnon-\nattainment,\u201d or \u201cunclassifiable\u201d with respect to each\nNAAQS, \u00a77407(d), and the State\u2019s implementation plan\nmust include permitting programs for stationary sources\nthat vary according to the classification of the area where\nthe source is or is proposed to be located. \u00a77410(a)(2)(C),\n(I).\n   Stationary sources in areas designated attainment or\nunclassifiable are subject to the Act\u2019s provisions relating to\n\u201cPrevention of Significant Deterioration\u201d (PSD). \u00a7\u00a77470\u2013\n7492. EPA interprets the PSD provisions to apply to\nsources located in areas that are designated attainment or\nunclassifiable for any NAAQS pollutant, regardless of\nwhether the source emits that specific pollutant. Since the\ninception of the PSD program, every area of the country\nhas been designated attainment or unclassifiable for at\nleast one NAAQS pollutant; thus, on EPA\u2019s view, all sta-\ntionary sources are potentially subject to PSD review.\n   It is unlawful to construct or modify a \u201cmajor emitting\nfacility\u201d in \u201cany area to which [the PSD program] applies\u201d\nwithout first obtaining a permit. \u00a7\u00a77475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C).\nTo qualify for a permit, the facility must not cause or\ncontribute to the violation of any applicable air-quality\nstandard, \u00a77475(a)(3), and it must comply with emissions\nlimitations that reflect the \u201cbest available control technol-\nogy\u201d (or BACT) for \u201ceach pollutant subject to regulation\nunder\u201d the Act. \u00a77475(a)(4). The Act defines a \u201cmajor\nemitting facility\u201d as any stationary source with the poten-\ntial to emit 250 tons per year of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d (or 100\ntons per year for certain types of sources). \u00a77479(1). It\ndefines \u201cmodification\u201d as a physical or operational change\nthat causes the facility to emit more of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d\n4                UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a77411(a)(4).1\n  In addition to the PSD permitting requirements for\nconstruction and modification, Title V of the Act makes it\nunlawful to operate any \u201cmajor source,\u201d wherever located,\nwithout a comprehensive operating permit. \u00a77661a(a).\nUnlike the PSD program, Title V generally does not im-\npose any substantive pollution-control requirements.\nInstead, it is designed to facilitate compliance and en-\nforcement by consolidating into a single document all of a\nfacility\u2019s obligations under the Act. The permit must\ninclude all \u201cemissions limitations and standards\u201d that\napply to the source, as well as associated inspection, moni-\ntoring, and reporting requirements. \u00a77661c(a)\u2013(c). Title V\ndefines a \u201cmajor source\u201d by reference to the Act-wide\ndefinition of \u201cmajor stationary source,\u201d which in turn\nmeans any stationary source with the potential to emit\n100 tons per year of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d \u00a7\u00a77661(2)(B),\n7602( j).\n          B. EPA\u2019s Greenhouse-Gas Regulations\n  In 2007, the Court held that Title II of the Act \u201cauthor-\nize[d] EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new\nmotor vehicles\u201d if the Agency \u201cform[ed] a \u2018judgment\u2019 that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Although the statute sets numerical thresholds (100 or 250 tons per\nyear) for emissions that will make a facility \u201cmajor,\u201d it does not specify\nby how much a physical or operational change must increase emissions\nto constitute a permit-requiring \u201cmodification.\u201d Nor does it say how\nmuch of a given regulated pollutant a \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d must\nemit before it is subject to BACT for that pollutant. EPA, however, has\nestablished pollutant-specific numerical thresholds below which a\nfacility\u2019s emissions of a pollutant, and increases therein, are considered\nde minimis for those purposes. See 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a751.166(b)(2)(i), (23), (39),\n(j)(2)\u2013(3), 52.21(b)(2)(i), (23), (40), (j)(2)\u2013(3); see also Alabama Power Co.\nv.

S. 497, 528 (quoting \u00a77521(a)(1)). In\nresponse to that decision, EPA embarked on a course of\nregulation resulting in \u201cthe single largest expansion in the\nscope of the [Act] in its history.\u201d Clean Air Act Handbook,\nat xxi.\n   EPA first asked the public, in a notice of proposed rule-\nmaking, to comment on how the Agency should respond to\nMassachusetts. In doing so, it explained that regulating\ngreenhouse-gas emissions from motor vehicles could have\nfar-reaching consequences for stationary sources. Under\nEPA\u2019s view, once greenhouse gases became regulated\nunder any part of the Act, the PSD and Title V permitting\nrequirements would apply to all stationary sources with\nthe potential to emit greenhouse gases in excess of the\nstatutory thresholds: 100 tons per year under Title V, and\n100 or 250 tons per year under the PSD program depend-\ning on the type of source. 73 Fed. Reg. 44420, 44498,\n44511 (2008). Because greenhouse-gas emissions tend to\nbe \u201corders of magnitude greater\u201d than emissions of con-\nventional pollutants, EPA projected that numerous small\nsources not previously regulated under the Act would be\nswept into the PSD program and Title V, including \u201csmaller\nindustrial sources,\u201d \u201clarge office and residential build-\nings, hotels, large retail establishments, and similar facili-\nties.\u201d Id., at 44498\u201344499. The Agency warned that this\nwould constitute an \u201cunprecedented expansion of EPA\nauthority that would have a profound effect on virtually\nevery sector of the economy and touch every household in\nthe land,\u201d yet still be \u201crelatively ineffective at reducing\ngreenhouse gas concentrations.\u201d Id., at 44355.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Comments from other Executive Branch agencies reprinted in the\n\nnotice echoed those concerns.

EPA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 2009, EPA announced its determination regarding\nthe danger posed by motor-vehicle greenhouse-gas emis-\nsions. EPA found that greenhouse-gas emissions from\nnew motor vehicles contribute to elevated atmospheric\nconcentrations of greenhouse gases, which endanger pub-\nlic health and welfare by fostering global \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n74 Fed. Reg. 66523, 66537 (hereinafter Endangerment\nFinding). It denominated a \u201csingle air pollutant\u201d the\n\u201ccombined mix\u201d of six greenhouse gases that it identified\nas \u201cthe root cause of human-induced climate change\u201d:\ncarbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocar-\nbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Id., at\n66516, 66537. A source\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions would\nbe measured in \u201ccarbon dioxide equivalent units\u201d (CO2e),\nwhich would be calculated based on each gas\u2019s \u201cglobal\nwarming potential.\u201d Id., at 66499, n. 4.\n   Next, EPA issued its \u201cfinal decision\u201d regarding the\nprospect that motor-vehicle greenhouse-gas standards\nwould trigger stationary-source permitting requirements.\n75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (2010) (hereinafter Triggering Rule).\nEPA announced that beginning on the effective date of its\ngreenhouse-gas standards for motor vehicles, stationary\nsources would be subject to the PSD program and Title V\non the basis of their potential to emit greenhouse gases.\nAs expected, EPA in short order promulgated greenhouse-\ngas emission standards for passenger cars, light-duty\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe construction of schools, hospitals, and commercial and residential\ndevelopment\u201d); id., at 44383 (Council of Economic Advisers and Office\nof Science and Technology Policy stating that \u201c[s]mall manufacturing\nfacilities, schools, and shopping centers\u201d would be subject to \u201cfull major\nsource permitting\u201d); id., at 44385 (Council on Environmental Quality\nnoting \u201cthe prospect of essentially automatic and immediate regulation\nover a vast range of community and business activity\u201d); id., at 44391\n(Small Business Administration finding it \u201cdifficult to overemphasize\nhow potentially disruptive and burdensome such a new regulatory\nregime would be to small entities\u201d such as \u201coffice buildings, retail\nestablishments, hotels, . . . schools, prisons, and private hospitals\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Those steps were\nnecessary, it said, because the PSD program and Title V\nwere designed to regulate \u201ca relatively small number of\nlarge industrial sources,\u201d and requiring permits for all\nsources with greenhouse-gas emissions above the statu-\ntory thresholds would radically expand those programs,\nmaking them both unadministrable and \u201cunrecognizable\nto the Congress that designed\u201d them. Id., at 31555, 31562.\nEPA nonetheless rejected calls to exclude greenhouse\ngases entirely from those programs, asserting that the Act\nis not \u201cambiguous with respect to the need to cover\n[greenhouse-gas] sources under either the PSD or title V\nprogram.\u201d Id., at 31548, n. 31. Instead, EPA adopted a\n\u201cphase-in approach\u201d that it said would \u201cappl[y] PSD and\ntitle V at threshold levels that are as close to the statutory\nlevels as possible, and do so as quickly as possible, at least\nto a certain point.\u201d Id., at 31523.\n   The phase-in, EPA said, would consist of at least three\nsteps. During Step 1, from January 2 through June 30,\n2011, no source would become newly subject to the PSD\nprogram or Title V solely on the basis of its greenhouse-\ngas emissions; however, sources required to obtain permits\nanyway because of their emission of conventional pollu-\ntants (so-called \u201canyway\u201d sources) would need to comply\nwith BACT for greenhouse gases if they emitted those\ngases in significant amounts, defined as at least 75,000\ntons per year CO2e. Ibid. During Step 2, from July 1,\n2011, through June 30, 2012, sources with the potential to\nemit at least 100,000 tons per year CO2e of greenhouse\ngases would be subject to PSD and Title V permitting for\ntheir construction and operation and to PSD permitting\n8           UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

Id., at\n31523\u201331524.3 At Step 3, beginning on July 1, 2013, EPA\nsaid it might (or might not) further reduce the permitting\nthresholds (though not below 50,000 tons per year CO2e),\nand it might (or might not) establish permanent exemp-\ntions for some sources. Id., at 31524. Beyond Step 3, EPA\npromised to complete another round of rulemaking by\nApril 30, 2016, in which it would \u201ctake further action to\naddress small sources,\u201d which might (or might not) include\nestablishing permanent exemptions.

See Tailoring Rule\n31606\u201331608.

First, we must decide whether EPA permissibly\ndetermined that a source may be subject to the PSD and\nTitle V permitting requirements on the sole basis of the\nsource\u2019s potential to emit greenhouse gases. Second, we\nmust decide whether EPA permissibly determined that a\nsource already subject to the PSD program because of its\nemission of conventional pollutants (an \u201canyway\u201d source)\nmay be required to limit its greenhouse-gas emissions by\nemploying the \u201cbest available control technology\u201d for\ngreenhouse gases.

Under Chevron, we presume that when\nan agency-administered statute is ambiguous with respect\nto what it prescribes, Congress has empowered the agency\nto resolve the ambiguity.

The PSD and Title V Triggers\n  We first decide whether EPA permissibly interpreted\nthe statute to provide that a source may be required to\nobtain a PSD or Title V permit on the sole basis of its\npotential greenhouse-gas emissions.\n                            1\n   EPA thought its conclusion that a source\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas emissions may necessitate a PSD or Title V permit\nfollowed from the Act\u2019s unambiguous language. The Court\nof Appeals agreed and held that the statute \u201ccompelled\u201d\nEPA\u2019s interpretation. 684 F. 3d, at 134.

S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals reasoned by way of a flawed syllo-\ngism: Under Massachusetts, the general, Act-wide defini-\ntion of \u201cair pollutant\u201d includes greenhouse gases; the Act\nrequires permits for major emitters of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d;\ntherefore, the Act requires permits for major emitters of\ngreenhouse gases. The conclusion follows from the prem-\nises only if the air pollutants referred to in the permit-\nrequiring provisions (the minor premise) are the same air\npollutants encompassed by the Act-wide definition as\ninterpreted in Massachusetts (the major premise). Yet no\none\u2014least of all EPA\u2014endorses that proposition, and it is\nobviously untenable.\n   The Act-wide definition says that an air pollutant is\n\u201cany air pollution agent or combination of such agents,\nincluding any physical, chemical, biological, [or] radioac-\ntive . . . substance or matter which is emitted into or oth-\nerwise enters the ambient air.\u201d \u00a77602(g). In Massachu\u00ad\nsetts, the Court held that the Act-wide definition includes\ngreenhouse gases because it is all-encompassing; it \u201cem-\nbraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe.\u201d 549\nU. S., at 529. But where the term \u201cair pollutant\u201d appears\nin the Act\u2019s operative provisions, EPA has routinely given\nit a narrower, context-appropriate meaning.\n   That is certainly true of the provisions that require PSD\nand Title V permitting for major emitters of \u201cany air pollu-\ntant.\u201d Since 1978, EPA\u2019s regulations have interpreted \u201cair\npollutant\u201d in the PSD permitting trigger as limited to\nregulated air pollutants, 43 Fed.

See Brief for Federal Respondents 56. We agree,\n\nand we are satisfied that those arguments were also made below. See,\n\ne.g., Brief for State Petitioners et al. in No. 10\u20131073 etc. (CADC), pp.\n\n59\u201373; Brief for Non-State Petitioners et al. in No. 10\u20131073 etc.\n\n(CADC), pp. 46\u201347. \n\n12         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhatever stripe,\u201d 549 U. S., at 529. And since 1993 EPA\nhas informally taken the same position with regard to the\nTitle V permitting trigger, a position the Agency ultimately\nincorporated into some of the regulations at issue here.\nSee Memorandum from Lydia N. Wegman, Deputy Direc-\ntor, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to Air\nDivision Director, Regions I\u2013X, pp. 4\u20135 (Apr. 26, 1993);\nTailoring Rule 31607\u201331608 (amending 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a770.2,\n71.2). Those interpretations were appropriate: It is plain\nas day that the Act does not envision an elaborate, bur-\ndensome permitting process for major emitters of steam,\noxygen, or other harmless airborne substances. It takes\nsome cheek for EPA to insist that it cannot possibly give\n\u201cair pollutant\u201d a reasonable, context-appropriate meaning\nin the PSD and Title V contexts when it has been doing\nprecisely that for decades.\n  Nor are those the only places in the Act where EPA has\ninferred from statutory context that a generic reference to\nair pollutants does not encompass every substance falling\nwithin the Act-wide definition. Other examples abound:\n\n     \uf0b7\t The Act authorizes EPA to enforce new source per-\n        formance standards (NSPS) against a pre-existing\n        source if, after promulgation of the standards, the\n        source undergoes a physical or operational change\n        that increases its emission of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d\n        \u00a77411(a)(2), (4), (b)(1)(B).

Reg. 39160\n      (2005), codified at 40 CFR pt. 51, App. Y, \u00a7II.A.3.\n\nAlthough these limitations are nowhere to be found in the\nAct-wide definition, in each instance EPA has concluded\u2014\nas it has in the PSD and Title V context\u2014that the statute\nis not using \u201cair pollutant\u201d in Massachusetts\u2019 broad sense\nto mean any airborne substance whatsoever.\n   Massachusetts did not invalidate all these longstanding\nconstructions. That case did not hold that EPA must\nalways regulate greenhouse gases as an \u201cair pollutant\u201d\neverywhere that term appears in the statute, but only that\nEPA must \u201cground its reasons for action or inaction in the\nstatute,\u201d 549 U. S., at 535 (emphasis added), rather than\non \u201creasoning divorced from the statutory text,\u201d id., at\n532. EPA\u2019s inaction with regard to Title II was not suffi-\nciently grounded in the statute, the Court said, in part\n14          UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause nothing in the Act suggested that regulating\ngreenhouse gases under that Title would conflict with the\nstatutory design. Title II would not compel EPA to regu-\nlate in any way that would be \u201cextreme,\u201d \u201ccounterintui-\ntive,\u201d or contrary to \u201c \u2018common sense.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 531. At\nmost, it would require EPA to take the modest step of\nadding greenhouse-gas standards to the roster of new-\nmotor-vehicle emission regulations. Ibid.\n   Massachusetts does not strip EPA of authority to ex-\nclude greenhouse gases from the class of regulable air\npollutants under other parts of the Act where their inclu-\nsion would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme. The\nAct-wide definition to which the Court gave a \u201csweeping\u201d\nand \u201ccapacious\u201d interpretation, id., at 528, 532, is not a\ncommand to regulate, but a description of the universe of\nsubstances EPA may consider regulating under the Act\u2019s\noperative provisions. Massachusetts does not foreclose the\nAgency\u2019s use of statutory context to infer that certain of\nthe Act\u2019s provisions use \u201cair pollutant\u201d to denote not every\nconceivable airborne substance, but only those that may\nsensibly be encompassed within the particular regulatory\nprogram. As certain amici felicitously put it, while Mas\u00ad\nsachusetts \u201crejected EPA\u2019s categorical contention that\ngreenhouse gases could not be \u2018air pollutants\u2019 for any\npurposes of the Act,\u201d it did not \u201cembrace EPA\u2019s current,\nequally categorical position that greenhouse gases must be\nair pollutants for all purposes\u201d regardless of the statutory\ncontext.

But we, and EPA, must do our best, bearing in mind\nthe \u201c \u2018fundamental canon of statutory construction that the\nwords of a statute must be read in their context and with a\nview to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d FDA\nv.

As we reiterated the same day we decided Massa\u00ad\nchusetts, the presumption of consistent usage \u201c \u2018readily\nyields\u2019 \u201d to context, and a statutory term\u2014even one defined\nin the statute\u2014\u201cmay take on distinct characters from\nassociation with distinct statutory objects calling for dif-\nferent implementation strategies.\u201d Duke Energy, supra, at\n574.\n   We need not, and do not, pass on the validity of all the\nlimiting constructions EPA has given the term \u201cair pollu-\ntant\u201d throughout the Act. We merely observe that taken\ntogether, they belie EPA\u2019s rigid insistence that when\ninterpreting the PSD and Title V permitting requirements\nit is bound by the Act-wide definition\u2019s inclusion of green-\nhouse gases, no matter how incompatible that inclusion is\nwith those programs\u2019 regulatory structure.\n   In sum, there is no insuperable textual barrier to EPA\u2019s\ninterpreting \u201cany air pollutant\u201d in the permitting triggers\nof PSD and Title V to encompass only pollutants emitted\nin quantities that enable them to be sensibly regulated at\nthe statutory thresholds, and to exclude those atypical\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nnot at issue here and one that no party in American Electric Power\n\nargued was ill suited to accommodating greenhouse gases. \n\n16           UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

Others main-\ntain that \u201cany air pollutant\u201d in the PSD provision should be limited to\nair pollutants with localized effects on air quality.

S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 13), does not merit deference.\n   EPA itself has repeatedly acknowledged that applying\nthe PSD and Title V permitting requirements to green-\nhouse gases would be inconsistent with\u2014in fact, would\noverthrow\u2014the Act\u2019s structure and design. In the Tailor-\ning Rule, EPA described the calamitous consequences of\ninterpreting the Act in that way. Under the PSD program,\nannual permit applications would jump from about 800 to\nnearly 82,000; annual administrative costs would swell\nfrom $12 million to over $1.5 billion; and decade-long\ndelays in issuing permits would become common, causing\nconstruction projects to grind to a halt nationwide. Tailor-\ning Rule 31557. The picture under Title V was equally\nbleak: The number of sources required to have permits\nwould jump from fewer than 15,000 to about 6.1 million;\nannual administrative costs would balloon from $62 mil-\nlion to $21 billion; and collectively the newly covered\nsources would face permitting costs of $147 billion. Id., at\n31562\u201331563. Moreover, \u201cthe great majority of additional\nsources brought into the PSD and title V programs would\nbe small sources that Congress did not expect would need\nto undergo permitting.\u201d Id., at 31533. EPA stated that\nthese results would be so \u201ccontrary to congressional in-\ntent,\u201d and would so \u201cseverely undermine what Congress\nsought to accomplish,\u201d that they necessitated as much as a\n1,000-fold increase in the permitting thresholds set forth\nin the statute. Id., at 31554, 31562.\n18        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Like EPA, we think it beyond reasonable debate that\nrequiring permits for sources based solely on their emis-\nsion of greenhouse gases at the 100- and 250-tons-per-year\nlevels set forth in the statute would be \u201cincompatible\u201d with\n\u201cthe substance of Congress\u2019 regulatory scheme.\u201d Brown &\nWilliamson, 529 U. S., at 156. A brief review of the rele-\nvant statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD\nprogram and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot\nrationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large\nsources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and\nprocedural burdens.\n  Start with the PSD program, which imposes numerous\nand costly requirements on those sources that are required\nto apply for permits. Among other things, the applicant\nmust make available a detailed scientific analysis of the\nsource\u2019s potential pollution-related impacts, demonstrate\nthat the source will not contribute to the violation of any\napplicable pollution standard, and identify and use the\n\u201cbest available control technology\u201d for each regulated\npollutant it emits. \u00a77475(a)(3), (4), (6), (e). The permitting\nauthority (the State, usually) also bears its share of the\nburden: It must grant or deny a permit within a year,\nduring which time it must hold a public hearing on the\napplication. \u00a77475(a)(2), (c).      Not surprisingly, EPA\nacknowledges that PSD review is a \u201ccomplicated, resource-\nintensive, time-consuming, and sometimes contentious\nprocess\u201d suitable for \u201chundreds of larger sources,\u201d not\n\u201ctens of thousands of smaller sources.\u201d 74 Fed. Reg.\n55304, 55321\u201355322.\n  Title V contains no comparable substantive require-\nments but imposes elaborate procedural mandates. It\nrequires the applicant to submit, within a year of becom-\ning subject to Title V, a permit application and a \u201ccompli-\nance plan\u201d describing how it will comply with \u201call applica-\nble requirements\u201d under the Act; to certify its compliance\nannually; and to submit to \u201cinspection, entry, monitoring,\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

The procedural burdens on the permitting\nauthority and EPA are also significant. The permitting\nauthority must hold a public hearing on the application,\n\u00a77661a(b)(6), and it must forward the application and any\nproposed permit to EPA and neighboring States and re-\nspond in writing to their comments, \u00a77661d(a), (b)(1). If it\nfails to issue or deny the permit within 18 months, any\ninterested party can sue to require a decision \u201cwithout\nadditional delay.\u201d \u00a7\u00a77661a(b)(7), 7661b(c). An interested\nparty also can petition EPA to block issuance of the per-\nmit; EPA must grant or deny the petition within 60 days,\nand its decision may be challenged in federal court.\n\u00a77661d(b)(2)\u2013(3). As EPA wrote, Title V is \u201cfinely crafted\nfor thousands,\u201d not millions, of sources. Tailoring Rule\n31563.\n    The fact that EPA\u2019s greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpre-\ntation of the PSD and Title V triggers would place plainly\nexcessive demands on limited governmental resources is\nalone a good reason for rejecting it; but that is not the only\nreason. EPA\u2019s interpretation is also unreasonable because\nit would bring about an enormous and transformative\nexpansion in EPA\u2019s regulatory authority without clear\ncongressional authorization. When an agency claims to\ndiscover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to\nregulate \u201ca significant portion of the American economy,\u201d\nBrown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159, we typically greet\nits announcement with a measure of skepticism. We\nexpect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to\nan agency decisions of vast \u201ceconomic and political signifi-\ncance.\u201d Id., at 160; see also MCI Telecommunications\nCorp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S.\n218, 231 (1994); Industrial Union Dept., AFL\u2013CIO v.\nAmerican Petroleum Institute, 448 U. S. 607, 645\u2013646\n(1980) (plurality opinion). The power to require permits\nfor the construction and modification of tens of thousands,\n20          UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nand the operation of millions, of small sources nationwide\nfalls comfortably within the class of authorizations that we\nhave been reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory text.\nMoreover, in EPA\u2019s assertion of that authority, we con-\nfront a singular situation: an agency laying claim to ex-\ntravagant statutory power over the national economy\nwhile at the same time strenuously asserting that the\nauthority claimed would render the statute \u201cunrecogniza-\nble to the Congress that designed\u201d it. Tailoring Rule\n31555. Since, as we hold above, the statute does not com-\npel EPA\u2019s interpretation, it would be patently unreason-\nable\u2014not to say outrageous\u2014for EPA to insist on seizing\nexpansive power that it admits the statute is not designed\nto grant.7\n                             3\n  EPA thought that despite the foregoing problems, it\ncould make its interpretation reasonable by adjusting the\nlevels at which a source\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 A few additional points bear mentioning.      The Solicitor General\nconjectures that EPA might eventually alter its longstanding interpre-\ntation of \u201cpotential to emit\u201d in order to reduce the number of sources\nrequired to have permits at the statutory thresholds. But neither he\nnor the Agency has given us any reason to believe that there exists a\nplausible reading of \u201cpotential to emit\u201d that EPA would willingly adopt\nand that would eliminate the unreasonableness of EPA\u2019s interpretation.\nNor have we been given any information about the ability of other\npossible \u201cstreamlining\u201d techniques alluded to by EPA\u2014such as \u201cgen-\neral\u201d or \u201celectronic\u201d permitting\u2014to reduce the administrability prob-\nlems identified above; and in any event, none of those techniques would\naddress the more fundamental problem of EPA\u2019s claiming regulatory\nauthority over millions of small entities that it acknowledges the Act\ndoes not seek to regulate. Finally, the Solicitor General suggests that\nthe incompatibility of greenhouse gases with the PSD program and\nTitle V results chiefly from the inclusion of carbon dioxide in the\n\u201caggregate pollutant\u201d defined by EPA. We decide these cases on the\nbasis of the pollutant \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d as EPA has defined and\nregulated it, and we express no view on how our analysis might change\nwere EPA to define it differently.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noblige it to undergo PSD and Title V permitting. Although\nthe Act, in no uncertain terms, requires permits for\nsources with the potential to emit more than 100 or 250\ntons per year of a relevant pollutant, EPA in its Tailoring\nRule wrote a new threshold of 100,000 tons per year for\ngreenhouse gases. Since the Court of Appeals thought the\nstatute unambiguously made greenhouse gases capable of\ntriggering PSD and Title V, it held that petitioners lacked\nArticle III standing to challenge the Tailoring Rule be-\ncause that rule did not injure petitioners but merely re-\nlaxed the pre-existing statutory requirements. Because\nwe, however, hold that EPA\u2019s greenhouse-gas-inclusive\ninterpretation of the triggers was not compelled, and\nbecause EPA has essentially admitted that its interpreta-\ntion would be unreasonable without \u201ctailoring,\u201d we consider\nthe validity of the Tailoring Rule.\n   We conclude that EPA\u2019s rewriting of the statutory\nthresholds was impermissible and therefore could not\nvalidate the Agency\u2019s interpretation of the triggering\nprovisions. An agency has no power to \u201ctailor\u201d legislation\nto bureaucratic policy goals by rewriting unambiguous\nstatutory terms. Agencies exercise discretion only in the\ninterstices created by statutory silence or ambiguity; they\nmust always \u201c \u2018give effect to the unambiguously expressed\nintent of Congress.\u2019 \u201d National Assn. of Home Builders v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 665 (2007) (quoting\nChevron, 467 U. S., at 843). It is hard to imagine a statu-\ntory term less ambiguous than the precise numerical\nthresholds at which the Act requires PSD and Title V\npermitting. When EPA replaced those numbers with\nothers of its own choosing, it went well beyond the \u201cbounds\nof its statutory authority.\u201d Arlington, 569 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 5) (emphasis deleted).\n   The Solicitor General does not, and cannot, defend the\nTailoring Rule as an exercise of EPA\u2019s enforcement discre-\ntion. The Tailoring Rule is not just an announcement of\n22        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nEPA\u2019s refusal to enforce the statutory permitting require-\nments; it purports to alter those requirements and to\nestablish with the force of law that otherwise-prohibited\nconduct will not violate the Act. This alteration of the\nstatutory requirements was crucial to EPA\u2019s \u201ctailoring\u201d\nefforts. Without it, small entities with the potential to\nemit greenhouse gases in amounts exceeding the statutory\nthresholds would have remained subject to citizen suits\u2014\nauthorized by the Act\u2014to enjoin their construction, modi-\nfication, or operation and to impose civil penalties of up to\n$37,500 per day of violation. \u00a7\u00a77413(b), 7604(a), (f)(4); 40\nCFR \u00a719.4. EPA itself has recently affirmed that the\n\u201cindependent enforcement authority\u201d furnished by the\ncitizen-suit provision cannot be displaced by a permitting\nauthority\u2019s decision not to pursue enforcement. 78 Fed.\nReg. 12477, 12486\u201312487 (2013). The Solicitor General is\ntherefore quite right to acknowledge that the availability\nof citizen suits made it necessary for EPA, in seeking\nto mitigate the unreasonableness of its greenhouse-gas-\ninclusive interpretation, to go beyond merely exercising its\nenforcement discretion. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 87\u201388.\n   For similar reasons, Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199\n(1974)\u2014to which the Solicitor General points as the best\ncase supporting the Tailoring Rule, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 71,\n80\u201381\u2014is irrelevant. In Ruiz, Congress had appropriated\nfunds for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to spend on provid-\ning assistance to \u201c \u2018Indians throughout the United States\u2019 \u201d\nand had not \u201cimpose[d] any geographical limitation on the\navailability of general assistance benefits.\u201d Id., at 206\u2013\n207, and n. 7. Although we held the Bureau could not\ndeny benefits to off-reservation Indians because it had not\npublished its eligibility criteria, we stated in dictum that\nthe Bureau could, if it followed proper administrative\nprocedures, \u201ccreate reasonable classifications and eligibil-\nity requirements in order to allocate the limited funds\navailable.\u201d Id., at 230\u2013231.

See also Lincoln v. Vigil, 508\nU. S. 182, 192\u2013193 (1993). Nothing in Ruiz remotely\nauthorizes an agency to modify unambiguous require-\nments imposed by a federal statute. An agency confront-\ning resource constraints may change its own conduct, but\nit cannot change the law.\n   Were we to recognize the authority claimed by EPA in\nthe Tailoring Rule, we would deal a severe blow to the\nConstitution\u2019s separation of powers. Under our system of\ngovernment, Congress makes laws and the President,\nacting at times through agencies like EPA, \u201cfaithfully\nexecute[s]\u201d them. U. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a73; see Medell\u00edn v.\nTexas, 552 U. S. 491, 526\u2013527 (2008). The power of exe-\ncuting the laws necessarily includes both authority and\nresponsibility to resolve some questions left open by Con-\ngress that arise during the law\u2019s administration. But it\ndoes not include a power to revise clear statutory terms\nthat turn out not to work in practice. See, e.g., Barnhart\nv. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002) (agency\nlacked authority \u201cto develop new guidelines or to assign\nliability in a manner inconsistent with\u201d an \u201cunambiguous\nstatute\u201d).\n   In the Tailoring Rule, EPA asserts newfound authority\nto regulate millions of small sources\u2014including retail\nstores, offices, apartment buildings, shopping centers,\nschools, and churches\u2014and to decide, on an ongoing basis\nand without regard for the thresholds prescribed by Con-\ngress, how many of those sources to regulate. We are not\nwilling to stand on the dock and wave goodbye as EPA\nembarks on this multiyear voyage of discovery. We reaf-\nfirm the core administrative-law principle that an agency\nmay not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense\nof how the statute should operate. EPA therefore lacked\nauthority to \u201ctailor\u201d the Act\u2019s unambiguous numerical\n24            UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

We are aware of no principle of administrative law that would\nallow an agency to rewrite such a clear statutory term, and we shudder\nto contemplate the effect that such a principle would have on demo-\ncratic governance.\n  JUSTICE BREYER, however, claims to perceive no difference between\n(a) reading the statute to exclude greenhouse gases from the term \u201cany\nair pollutant\u201d in the permitting triggers, and (b) reading the statute to\nexclude sources emitting less than 100,000 tons per year from the\nstatutory phrase \u201cany . . . source with the potential to emit two hundred\nand fifty tons per year or more.\u201d See post, at 7. The two could scarcely\nbe further apart. As we have explained (and as EPA agrees), statutory\ncontext makes plain that the Act\u2019s operative provisions use \u201cair pollu-\ntant\u201d to denote less than the full range of pollutants covered by the Act-\nwide definition. See Part II\u2013A\u20131, supra. It is therefore incumbent on\nEPA to specify the pollutants encompassed by that term in the context\nof a particular program, and to do so reasonably in light of that pro-\ngram\u2019s overall regulatory scheme. But there is no ambiguity whatso-\never in the specific, numerical permitting thresholds, and thus no room\nfor EPA to exercise discretion in selecting a different threshold.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

But what about \u201canyway\u201d\nsources, those that would need permits based on their\nemissions of more conventional pollutants (such as partic-\nulate matter)? We now consider whether EPA reasonably\ninterpreted the Act to require those sources to comply with\n\u201cbest available control technology\u201d emission standards for\ngreenhouse gases.\n                               1\n   To obtain a PSD permit, a source must be \u201csubject to the\nbest available control technology\u201d for \u201ceach pollutant\nsubject to regulation under [the Act]\u201d that it emits.\n\u00a77475(a)(4).

BACT, they say,\nhas traditionally been about end-of-stack controls \u201csuch as\ncatalytic converters or particle collectors\u201d; but applying it\nto greenhouse gases will make it more about regulating\nenergy use, which will enable regulators to control \u201cevery\naspect of a facility\u2019s operation and design,\u201d right down to\nthe \u201clight bulbs in the factory cafeteria.\u201d Brief for Peti-\ntioner Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on\nGreenhouse Gas Regulation et al. in No. 12\u20131254, p. 7; see\nJoint Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 12\u20131248 etc., pp.\n26        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

Ibid.\n                             2\n   The question before us is whether EPA\u2019s decision to\nrequire BACT for greenhouse gases emitted by sources\notherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a\npermissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron.\nWe conclude that it is.\n   The text of the BACT provision is far less open-ended\nthan the text of the PSD and Title V permitting triggers.\nIt states that BACT is required \u201cfor each pollutant subject\nto regulation under this chapter\u201d (i.e., the entire Act),\n\u00a77475(a)(4), a phrase that\u2014as the D.

EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuggest that the BACT provision can bear a narrowing\nconstruction: There is no indication that the Act elsewhere\nuses, or that EPA has interpreted, \u201ceach pollutant subject\nto regulation under this chapter\u201d to mean anything other\nthan what it says.\n   Even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to\ngreenhouse gases is not so disastrously unworkable, and\nneed not result in such a dramatic expansion of agency\nauthority, as to convince us that EPA\u2019s interpretation is\nunreasonable. We are not talking about extending EPA\njurisdiction over millions of previously unregulated enti-\nties, but about moderately increasing the demands EPA\n(or a state permitting authority) can make of entities\nalready subject to its regulation. And it is not yet clear\nthat EPA\u2019s demands will be of a significantly different\ncharacter from those traditionally associated with PSD\nreview. In short, the record before us does not establish\nthat the BACT provision as written is incapable of being\nsensibly applied to greenhouse gases.\n   We acknowledge the potential for greenhouse-gas BACT\nto lead to an unreasonable and unanticipated degree of\nregulation, and our decision should not be taken as an\nendorsement of all aspects of EPA\u2019s current approach, nor\nas a free rein for any future regulatory application of\nBACT in this distinct context. Our narrow holding is that\nnothing in the statute categorically prohibits EPA from\ninterpreting the BACT provision to apply to greenhouse\ngases emitted by \u201canyway\u201d sources.\n   However, EPA may require an \u201canyway\u201d source to com-\nply with greenhouse-gas BACT only if the source emits\nmore than a de minimis amount of greenhouse gases. As\nnoted above, the Tailoring Rule applies BACT only if a\nsource emits greenhouse gases in excess of 75,000 tons per\nyear CO2e, but the Rule makes clear that EPA did not\narrive at that number by identifying the de minimis level.\nSee nn. 1, 3, supra.

We do not hold that\n75,000 tons per year CO2e necessarily exceeds a true de\nminimis level, only that EPA must justify its selection on\nproper grounds. Cf. Alabama Power, supra, at 405.9\n                        *     *    *\n   To sum up: We hold that EPA exceeded its statutory\nauthority when it interpreted the Clean Air Act to require\nPSD and Title V permitting for stationary sources based\non their greenhouse-gas emissions. Specifically, the Agency\nmay not treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant for pur-\nposes of defining a \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d (or a \u201cmodifi-\ncation\u201d thereof) in the PSD context or a \u201cmajor source\u201d in\nthe Title V context. To the extent its regulations purport\nto do so, they are invalid. EPA may, however, continue to\ntreat greenhouse gases as a \u201cpollutant subject to regula-\ntion under this chapter\u201d for purposes of requiring BACT\nfor \u201canyway\u201d sources. The judgment of the Court of Ap-\npeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 JUSTICE ALITO argues that BACT is \u201cfundamentally incompatible\u201d\n\nwith greenhouse gases for two reasons. Post, at 4 (opinion concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). First, BACT requires consideration of\n\u201cambient air quality at the proposed site and in areas which may be\naffected by emissions from [the proposed] facility for each pollutant\nsubject to regulation under this chapter,\u201d \u00a77475(e)(1); see also\n\u00a77475(e)(3)(B); and it is not obvious how that requirement should apply,\nor even whether it can apply, to greenhouse gases. Post, at 4\u20135. But\nthe possibility that that requirement may be inoperative as to green-\nhouse gases does not convince us that they must be categorically\nexcluded from BACT even though they are indisputably a \u201cpollutant\nsubject to regulation.\u201d Second, JUSTICE ALITO argues that EPA\u2019s\nguidance on how to implement greenhouse-gas BACT is a recipe for\n\u201carbitrary and inconsistent decisionmaking.\u201d Post, at 8. But we are not\nreviewing EPA\u2019s guidance in these cases, and we cannot say that it is\nimpossible for EPA and state permitting authorities to devise rational\nways of complying with the statute\u2019s directive to determine BACT for\ngreenhouse gases \u201con a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy,\nenvironmental, and economic impacts and other costs.\u201d \u00a77479(3).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

We also held, conse-\nquently, that the Environmental Protection Agency is\nempowered and required by Title II of the Act to regulate\ngreenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources (such as\ncars and trucks) if it decides that greenhouse gases \u201ccon-\ntribute to . . . air pollution which may reasonably be antic-\nipated to endanger public health or welfare,\u201d \u00a77521(a)(1).\n549 U. S., at 532\u2013533. The EPA determined that green-\nhouse gases endanger human health and welfare, 74 Fed.\nReg. 66496 (2009) (Endangerment Finding), and so it\nissued regulations for mobile emissions, 75 Fed. Reg.\n25324 (2010) (Tailpipe Rule).\n   These cases take as a given our decision in Massachu-\nsetts that the Act\u2019s general definition of \u201cair pollutant\u201d\nincludes greenhouse gases. One of the questions posed by\nthese cases is whether those gases fall within the scope of\nthe phrase \u201cany air pollutant\u201d as that phrase is used in the\nmore specific provisions of the Act here at issue. The\nCourt\u2019s answer is \u201cno.\u201d Ante, at 10\u201324. I disagree.\n   The Clean Air Act provisions at issue here are Title I\u2019s\nPrevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program,\n\u00a77470 et seq., and Title V\u2019s permitting regime, \u00a77661 et\nseq.

Title V requires each \u201cmajor source\u201d to obtain\nan operating permit. \u00a77661a(a).\n  These cases concern the definitions of \u201cmajor emitting\nfacility\u201d and \u201cmajor source,\u201d each of which is defined to\nmean any stationary source that emits more than a\nthreshold quantity of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d See \u00a77479(1)\n(\u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d); \u00a7\u00a77602(j), 7661(2)(B) (\u201cmajor\nsource\u201d). To simplify the exposition, I will refer only to the\nPSD program and its definition of \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d;\na parallel analysis applies to Title V.\n  As it is used in the PSD provisions,\n    \u201c[t]he term \u2018major emitting facility\u2019 means any of [a\n    list of specific categories of] stationary sources of air\n    pollutants which emit, or have the potential to emit,\n    one hundred tons per year or more of any air pollutant\n    . . . . Such term also includes any other source with\n    the potential to emit two hundred and fifty tons per\n    year or more of any air pollutant.\u201d \u00a77479(1).\nTo simplify further, I will ignore the reference to specific\ntypes of source that emit at least 100 tons per year (tpy) of\nany air pollutant. In effect, we are dealing with a statute\nthat says that the PSD program\u2019s regulatory requirements\nmust be applied to\n    \u201cany stationary source that has the potential to emit\n    two hundred fifty tons per year or more of any air\n    pollutant.\u201d\n  The interpretive difficulty in these cases arises out of\nthe definition\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ctwo hundred fifty tons\n4         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nper year or more,\u201d which I will call the \u201c250 tpy threshold.\u201d\nWhen applied to greenhouse gases, 250 tpy is far too low a\nthreshold. As the Court explains, tens of thousands of\nstationary sources emit large quantities of one greenhouse\ngas, carbon dioxide. See ante, at 17\u201320, and n. 7. To\napply the programs at issue here to all those sources\nwould be extremely expensive and burdensome, counter-\nproductive, and perhaps impossible; it would also contra-\nvene Congress\u2019s intent that the programs\u2019 coverage be\nlimited to those large sources whose emissions are sub-\nstantial enough to justify the regulatory burdens. Ibid.\nThe EPA recognized as much, and it addressed the prob-\nlem by issuing a regulation\u2014the Tailoring Rule\u2014that\npurports to raise the coverage threshold for greenhouse\ngases from the statutory figure of 250 tpy to 100,000 tpy\nin order to keep the programs\u2019 coverage limited to \u201ca rela-\ntively small number of large industrial sources.\u201d 75 Fed.\nReg. 31514, 31555 (2010); see id., at 31523\u201331524.\n   The Tailoring Rule solves the practical problems that\nwould have been caused by the 250 tpy threshold. But\nwhat are we to do about the statute\u2019s language? The\nstatute specifies a definite number\u2014250, not 100,000\u2014\nand it says that facilities that are covered by that number\nmust meet the program\u2019s requirements. The statute says\nnothing about agency discretion to change that number.\nWhat is to be done? How, given the statute\u2019s language,\ncan the EPA exempt from regulation sources that emit\nmore than 250 but less than 100,000 tpy of greenhouse\ngases (and that also do not emit other regulated pollutants\nat threshold levels)?\n   The Court answers by (1) pointing out that regulation at\nthe 250 tpy threshold would produce absurd results, (2)\nrefusing to read the statute as compelling such results,\nand (3) consequently interpreting the phrase \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d as containing an implicit exception for green-\nhouse gases.

Legal\nphilosophers like to point out that a statute providing that\n\u201c \u2018[w]hoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be\npunished by death\u2019 \u201d need not encompass a man who kills\nin self-defense; nor must an ordinance imposing fines upon\nthose who occupy a public parking spot for more than two\nhours penalize a driver who is unable to move because of a\nparade.

As the Court notes, the EPA has\ninterpreted the phrase \u201cany air pollutant,\u201d which is used\nseveral times in the Act, as limited to \u201cair pollutants for\nwhich EPA has promulgated [new source performance\nstandards]\u201d in the portion of the Act dealing with those\nstandards, as limited to \u201cvisibility-impairing air pollu-\ntants\u201d in the part of the Act concerned with deleterious\neffects on visibility, and as limited to \u201cpollutants for which\nthe area is designated nonattainment\u201d in the part of the\nAct aimed at regions that fail to attain air quality stand-\nards.

As a linguistic matter, one can just as\neasily read an implicit exception for small-scale green-\nhouse gas emissions into the phrase \u201cany source\u201d as into\nthe phrase \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d And given the purposes of\nthe PSD program and the Act as a whole, as well as the\nspecific roles of the different parts of the statutory defini-\ntion, finding flexibility in \u201cany source\u201d is far more sensible\nthan the Court\u2019s route of finding it in \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d\n   The implicit exception I propose reads almost word for\nword the same as the Court\u2019s, except that the location of\nthe exception has shifted. To repeat, the Court reads the\ndefinition of \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d as if it referred to\n\u201cany source with the potential to emit two hundred fifty\ntons per year or more of any air pollutant except for those\nair pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, with respect to\nwhich regulation at that threshold would be impractical or\nabsurd or would sweep in smaller sources that Congress\ndid not mean to cover.\u201d I would simply move the implicit\nexception, which I\u2019ve italicized, so that it applies to\n\u201csource\u201d rather than \u201cair pollutant\u201d: \u201cany source with the\npotential to emit two hundred fifty tons per year or more\nof any air pollutant except for those sources, such as those\nemitting unmanageably small amounts of greenhouse\ngases, with respect to which regulation at that threshold\nwould be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller\nsources that Congress did not mean to cover.\u201d\n   From a legal, administrative, and functional perspec-\ntive\u2014that is, from a perspective that assumes that Con-\ngress was not merely trying to arrange words on paper but\n8         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nwas seeking to achieve a real-world purpose\u2014my way of\nreading the statute is the more sensible one. For one\nthing, my reading is consistent with the specific purpose\nunderlying the 250 tpy threshold specified by the statute.\nThe purpose of that number was not to prevent the regula-\ntion of dangerous air pollutants that cannot be sensibly\nregulated at that particular threshold, though that is the\neffect that the Court\u2019s reading gives the threshold. Ra-\nther, the purpose was to limit the PSD program\u2019s obliga-\ntions to larger sources while exempting the many small\nsources whose emissions are low enough that imposing\nburdensome regulatory requirements on them would be\nsenseless.\n   Thus, the accompanying Senate Report explains that\nthe PSD program \u201cis reasonable and necessary for very\nlarge sources, such as new electrical generating plants or\nnew steel mills. But the procedure would prove costly and\npotentially unreasonable if imposed on construction of\nstorage facilities for a small gasoline jobber or on the\nconstruction of a new heating plant at a junior college.\u201d\nS.

EME Homer\n    City Generation, L. P., 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\n    op., at 4)], Congress considered sources that emit\n    NAAQS pollutants in those quantities generally to be\n    the large industrial sources to which it intended PSD\n    to be limited.\u201d Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. 31555.\n   The Court similarly acknowledges that \u201cthe PSD pro-\ngram and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot\nrationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large\nsources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and\nprocedural burdens.\u201d Ante, at 18; see also Alabama Power\nCo. v. Costle, 636 F. 2d 323, 353 (CADC 1979) (\u201cCongress\u2019s\nintention was to identify facilities which, due to their size,\nare financially able to bear the substantial regulatory\ncosts imposed by the PSD provisions and which, as a\ngroup, are primarily responsible for emission of the delete-\nrious pollutants that befoul our nation\u2019s air\u201d).\n   An implicit source-related exception would serve this\nstatutory purpose while going no further. The implicit\nexception that the Court reads into the phrase \u201cany air\npollutant,\u201d by contrast, goes well beyond the limited con-\ngressional objective. Nothing in the statutory text, the\nlegislative history, or common sense suggests that Con-\ngress, when it imposed the 250 tpy threshold, was trying\nto undermine its own deliberate decision to use the broad\nlanguage \u201cany air pollutant\u201d by removing some substances\n(rather than some facilities) from the PSD program\u2019s\ncoverage.\n   For another thing, a source-related exception serves the\nflexible nature of the Clean Air Act. We observed in Mas-\n10        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nsachusetts that \u201c[w]hile the Congresses that drafted\u201d the\nAct \u201cmight not have appreciated the possibility that burn-\ning fossil fuels could lead to global warming, they did\nunderstand that without regulatory flexibility, changing\ncircumstances and scientific developments would soon\nrender the Clean Air Act obsolete.\u201d 549 U. S., at 532. We\nrecognized that \u201c[t]he broad language of \u201d the Act-wide\ndefinition of \u201cair pollutant\u201d \u201creflects an intentional effort\nto confer the flexibility necessary to forestall such obsoles-\ncence.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court\u2019s decision to read greenhouse gases out of the\nPSD program drains the Act of its flexibility and chips\naway at our decision in Massachusetts. What sense does it\nmake to read the Act as generally granting the EPA the\nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and then\nto read it as denying that power with respect to the pro-\ngrams for large stationary sources at issue here? It is\nanomalous to read the Act to require the EPA to regulate\nair pollutants that pose previously unforeseen threats to\nhuman health and welfare where \u201c250 tons per year\u201d is a\nsensible regulatory line but not where, by chemical or\nregulatory happenstance, a higher line must be drawn.\nAnd it is anomalous to read an unwritten exception into\nthe more important phrase of the statutory definition\n(\u201cany air pollutant\u201d) when a similar unwritten exception to\nless important language (the particular number used by\nthe statute) will do just as well. The implicit exception\npreferred by the Court produces all of these anomalies,\nwhile the source-related exception I propose creates none\nof them.\n   In addition, the interpretation I propose leaves the EPA\nwith the sort of discretion as to interstitial matters that\nCongress likely intended it to retain. My interpretation\ngives the EPA nothing more than the authority to exempt\nsources from regulation insofar as the Agency reasonably\ndetermines that applying the PSD program to them would\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

That sort of decision, which involves the Agency\u2019s\ntechnical expertise and administrative experience, is the\nkind of decision that Congress typically leaves to the\nagencies to make. Cf. Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212,\n222 (2002) (enumerating factors that we take to indicate\nthat Congress intends the agency to exercise the discre-\ntion provided by Chevron). To read the Act to grant that\ndiscretion here is to read it as furthering Congress\u2019s (and\nthe public\u2019s) interest in more effective, less wasteful\nregulation.\n   Last, but by no means least, a source-related exception\nadvances the Act\u2019s overall purpose. That broad purpose,\nas set forth at the beginning of the statute, is \u201cto protect\nand enhance the quality of the Nation\u2019s air resources so as\nto promote the public health and welfare and the produc-\ntive capacity of its population.\u201d \u00a77401(b)(1); see also\n\u00a77470(1) (A purpose of the PSD program in particular\nis \u201cto protect public health and welfare from any actual\nor potential adverse effect which in the Administra-\ntor\u2019s judgment may reasonably be anticipate[d] to occur\nfrom air pollution\u201d); \u00a77602(h) (\u201cAll language [in the Act]\nreferring to effects on welfare includes . . . effects on . . .\nweather . . . and climate\u201d). The expert agency charged\nwith administering the Act has determined in its En-\ndangerment Finding that greenhouse gases endanger\nhuman health and welfare, and so sensible regulation of\nindustrial emissions of those pollutants is at the core of\nthe purpose behind the Act. The broad \u201cno greenhouse\ngases\u201d exception that the Court reads into the statute\nunnecessarily undercuts that purpose, while my narrow\nsource-related exception would leave the Agency with the\ntools it needs to further it.\n                      *     *     *\n  I agree with the Court\u2019s holding that stationary sources\n12        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

I therefore join Part\nII\u2013B\u20132 of the Court\u2019s opinion. But as for the Court\u2019s hold-\ning that the EPA cannot interpret the language at issue\nhere to cover facilities that emit more than 100,000 tpy of\ngreenhouse gases by virtue of those emissions, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), this\nCourt considered whether greenhouse gases fall within the\nClean Air Act\u2019s general definition of an air \u201cpollutant.\u201d\nId., at 528\u2013529. The Environmental Protection Agency\ncautioned us that \u201ckey provisions of the [Act] cannot co-\ngently be applied to [greenhouse gas] emissions,\u201d Brief for\nFederal Respondent in Massachusetts v. EPA, O. T. 2006,\nNo. 05\u20131120, p. 22, but the Court brushed the warning\naside and had \u201clittle trouble\u201d concluding that the Act\u2019s\n\u201csweeping definition\u201d of a pollutant encompasses green-\nhouse gases. 549 U. S., at 528\u2013529. I believed Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA was wrongly decided at the time, and these\ncases further expose the flaws with that decision.\n                              I\n  As the present cases now show, trying to fit greenhouse\ngases into \u201ckey provisions\u201d of the Clean Air Act involves\nmore than a \u201clittle trouble.\u201d These cases concern the\nprovisions of the Act relating to the \u201cPrevention of Signifi-\ncant Deterioration\u201d (PSD), 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77470\u20137492, as\nwell as Title V of the Act, \u00a77661. And in order to make\nthose provisions apply to greenhouse gases in a way that\ndoes not produce absurd results, the EPA effectively\namended the Act. The Act contains specific emissions\nthresholds that trigger PSD and Title V coverage, but the\nEPA crossed out the figures enacted by Congress and\nsubstituted figures of its own.\n  I agree with the Court that the EPA is neither required\nnor permitted to take this extraordinary step, and I there-\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Neither is\nconvincing.\n                              A\n   With respect to the text, it is curious that the Court,\nhaving departed from a literal interpretation of the term\n\u201cpollutant\u201d in Part II\u2013A, turns on its heels and adopts a\nliteral interpretation in Part II\u2013B. The coverage thresh-\nolds at issue in Part II\u2013A apply to any \u201cpollutant.\u201d The\nAct\u2019s general definition of this term is broad, and in Mas-\nsachusetts v. EPA, supra, the Court held that this defini-\ntion covers greenhouse gases. The Court does not disturb\nthat holding, but it nevertheless concludes that, as used in\nthe provision triggering PSD coverage, the term \u201cpollu-\ntant\u201d actually means \u201cpollutant, other than a greenhouse\ngas.\u201d\n   In Part II\u2013B, the relevant statutory provision says\nthat BACT must be installed for any \u201cpollutant subject\nto regulation under [the Act].\u201d \u00a77475(a)(4). If the term\n\u201cpollutant\u201d means \u201cpollutant, other than a greenhouse\ngas,\u201d as the Court effectively concludes in Part II\u2013A, the\nterm \u201cpollutant subject to regulation under [the Act]\u201d in\n\u00a77475(a)(4) should mean \u201cpollutant, other than a green-\n4         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nhouse gas, subject to regulation under [the Act], and that\nis subject to regulation under [the Act].\u201d The Court\u2019s\nliteralism is selective, and it results in a strange and\ndisjointed regulatory scheme.\n   Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, a source can emit an\nunlimited quantity of greenhouse gases without triggering\nthe need for a PSD permit. Why might Congress have\nwanted to allow this? The most likely explanation is that\nthe PSD permitting process is simply not suited for use in\nregulating this particular pollutant. And if that is so, it\nmakes little sense to require the installation of BACT for\ngreenhouse gases in those instances in which a source\nhappens to be required to obtain a permit due to the emis-\nsion of a qualifying quantity of some other pollutant that\nis regulated under the Act.\n                             B\n  The Court\u2019s second reason for holding that BACT ap-\nplies to \u201canyway\u201d sources is its belief that this can be done\nwithout disastrous consequences. Only time will tell\nwhether this hope is well founded, but it seems clear that\nBACT analysis is fundamentally incompatible with the\nregulation of greenhouse-gas emissions for at least two\nimportant reasons.\n                             1\n  First, BACT looks to the effects of covered pollutants in\nthe area in which a source is located. The PSD program is\nimplemented through \u201cemission limitations and such\nother measures\u201d as are \u201cnecessary . . . to prevent signifi-\ncant deterioration of air quality in each region.\u201d \u00a77471\n(emphasis added). The Clean Air Act provides that BACT\nmust be identified \u201con a case-by-case basis,\u201d \u00a77479(3), and\nthis necessarily means that local conditions must be taken\ninto account. For this reason, the Act instructs the EPA to\nissue regulations requiring an analysis of \u201cthe ambient air\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nquality . . . at the site of the proposed major emitting facil-\nity and in the area potentially affected by the emissions\nfrom such facility for each pollutant regulated under [the\nAct].\u201d \u00a77475(e)(3)(B) (emphasis added). The Act also\nrequires a public hearing on \u201cthe air quality at the pro-\nposed site and in areas which may be affected by emissions\nfrom such facility for each pollutant subject to regulation\nunder [the Act] which will be emitted from such facility.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a77475(a)(2), (e)(1) (emphasis added). Accordingly, if\nBACT is required for greenhouse gases, the Act demands\nthat the impact of these gases in the area surrounding a\nsite must be monitored, explored at a public hearing, and\nconsidered as part of the permitting process. The effects of\ngreenhouse gases, however, are global, not local. See PSD\nand Title V Permitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases\n41\u201342 (Mar. 2011) (hereinafter Guidance). As a result, the\nEPA has declared that PSD permit applicants and permit-\nting officials may disregard these provisions of the Act. 75\nFed. Reg. 31520 (2010).\n                             2\n  Second, as part of the case-by-case analysis required by\nBACT, a permitting authority must balance the environ-\nmental benefit expected to result from the installation of\nan available control measure against adverse consequences\nthat may result, including any negative impact on the\nenvironment, energy conservation, and the economy. And\nthe EPA itself has admitted that this cannot be done on a\ncase-by-case basis with respect to greenhouse gases.\n  The Clean Air Act makes it clear that BACT must be\ndetermined on a \u201ccase-by-case basis, taking into account\nenergy, environmental, and economic impacts and other\ncosts.\u201d \u00a77479(3). To implement this directive, the EPA\nadopted a five-step framework for making a BACT deter-\nmination. See New Source Review Workshop Manual:\nPrevention of Significant Deterioration and Nonattain-\n6            UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nment Area Permitting (Oct. 1990).1 Under the fourth step\nof this analysis, potentially applicable and feasible control\ntechnologies that are candidates for selection as BACT for\na particular source are eliminated from consideration\nbased on their \u201ccollateral impacts,\u201d such as any adverse\nenvironmental effects or adverse effects on energy con-\nsumption or the economy.\n   More recently, the EPA provided guidance to permitting\nauthorities regarding the treatment of greenhouse-gas\nemissions under this framework, and the EPA\u2019s guidance\ndemonstrates the insuperable problem that results when\nan attempt is made to apply this framework to greenhouse\ngas emissions. As noted above, at step 4 of the framework,\na permitting authority must balance the positive effect\nlikely to result from requiring a particular source to install\na particular technology against a variety of negative ef-\nfects that are likely to occur if that step is taken. But\nin the case of greenhouse gases, how can a permit-\nting authority make this individualized, source-specific\ndetermination?\n   The EPA instructs permitting authorities to take into\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        EPA describes these steps as follows:\n  (1) The applicant must identify all available control options that are\npotentially applicable by consulting EPA\u2019s BACT clearinghouse along\nwith other reliable sources.\n  (2) The technical feasibility of the control options identified in step 1\nare eliminated based on technical infeasibility.\n  (3) The control technologies are ranked based on control effective-\nness, by considering: the percentage of the pollutant removed; expected\nemission rate for each new source review (NSR) pollutant; expected\nemission reduction for each regulated NSR pollutant; and output based\nemissions limit.\n  (4) Control technologies are eliminated based on collateral impacts,\nsuch as: energy impacts; other environmental impacts; solid or hazard-\nous waste; water discharge from control device; emissions of air toxics\nand other non-NSR regulated pollutants; and economic impacts.\n  (5) The most effective control option not eliminated in step 4 is\nproposed as BACT for the pollutant and emission unit under review.\n                   Cite as: 573 U.

These include an increased risk\nof dangerous heat waves, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and\ndrought, as well as risks to agriculture, forestry, and\nwater resources. Guidance 40\u201341. But the EPA admits\nthat it is simply not possible for a permitting authority to\ncalculate in any meaningful way the degree to which any\npotential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from any\nindividual source might reduce these risks. And without\nmaking such a calculation in even a very rough way, a\npermitting authority cannot do what the Clean Air Act\nand the EPA\u2019s framework demand\u2014compare the benefits\nof some specified reduction in the emission of greenhouse\ngases from a particular source with any adverse environ-\nmental or economic effects that might result from mandat-\ning such a reduction.\n   Suppose, for example, that a permitting authority must\ndecide whether to mandate a change that both decreases a\nsource\u2019s emission of greenhouse gases and increases its\nemission of a conventional pollutant that has a negative\neffect on public health. How should a permitting authority\ndecide whether to require this change? Here is the EPA\u2019s\nadvice:\n    \u201c[W]hen considering the trade-offs between the envi-\n    ronmental impacts of a particular level of GHG\n    [greenhouse gas] reduction and a collateral increase in\n    another regulated NSR pollutant,[2] rather than at-\n    tempting to determine or characterize specific envi-\n    ronmental impacts from GHGs emitted at particular\n    locations, EPA recommends that permitting authori-\n    ties focus on the amount of GHG emission reductions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 \u201cNew source review pollutants\u201d are those pollutants for which a\n\nNational Ambient Air Quality standard has been set and a few others,\nsuch as sulphur dioxide. See 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxvii) (2013).\n8             UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n       that may be gained or lost by employing a particular\n       control strategy and how that compares to the envi-\n       ronmental or other impacts resulting from the collat-\n       eral emissions increase of other regulated NSR pollu-\n       tants.\u201d Guidance 42.\n   As best I can make out, what this means is that permit-\nting authorities should not even try to assess the net\nimpact on public health. Instead of comparing the positive\nand negative public health effects of a particular option,\npermitting authorities are instructed to compare the\nadverse public health effects of increasing the emissions of\nthe conventional pollutants with the amount of the reduc-\ntion of the source\u2019s emissions of greenhouse gases. But\nwithout knowing the positive effects of the latter, this is a\nmeaningless comparison.\n   The EPA tries to ameliorate this problem by noting that\npermitting authorities are entitled to \u201ca great deal of\ndiscretion,\u201d Guidance 41, but without a comprehensible\nstandard, what this will mean is arbitrary and incon-\nsistent decisionmaking. That is not what the Clean Air\nAct contemplates.3\n                       *     *    *\n   BACT analysis, like the rest of the Clean Air Act, was\ndeveloped for use in regulating the emission of conven-\ntional pollutants and is simply not suited for use with\nrespect to greenhouse gases.
