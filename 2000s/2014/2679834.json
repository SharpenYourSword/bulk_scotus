Argued February 24, 2014—Decided June 23, 2014 *\nThe Clean Air Act imposes permitting requirements on stationary\n  sources, such as factories and powerplants. The Act’s “Prevention of\n  Significant Deterioration” (PSD) provisions make it unlawful to con-\n  struct or modify a “major emitting facility” in “any area to which [the\n  PSD program] applies” without a permit. §§7475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C). A\n  “major emitting facility” is a stationary source with the potential to\n  emit 250 tons per year of “any air pollutant” (or 100 tons per year for\n  certain types of sources). §7479(1). Facilities seeking to qualify for a\n  PSD permit must, inter alia, comply with emissions limitations that\n  reflect the “best available control technology” (BACT) for “each pollu-\n  tant subject to regulation under” the Act. §7475(a)(4). In addition,\n  Title V of the Act makes it unlawful to operate any “major source,”\n  wherever located, without a permit. §7661a(a). A “major source” is a\n  stationary source with the potential to emit 100 tons per year of “any\n  air pollutant.” §§7661(2)(B), 7602(j).\n     In response to Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.

EPA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    made stationary sources subject to the PSD program and Title V on\n    the basis of their potential to emit greenhouse gases. It recognized,\n    however, that requiring permits for all sources with greenhouse-gas\n    emissions above the statutory thresholds would radically expand\n    those programs and render them unadministrable. So EPA purport-\n    ed to “tailor” the programs to accommodate greenhouse gases by\n    providing, among other things, that sources would not become newly\n    subject to PSD or Title V permitting on the basis of their potential to\n    emit greenhouse gases in amounts less than 100,000 tons per year.\n       Numerous parties, including several States, challenged EPA’s ac-\n    tions in the D. C. Circuit, which dismissed some of the petitions for\n    lack of jurisdiction and denied the remainder.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n684 F. 3d 102, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I and II, concluding:\n    1. The Act neither compels nor permits EPA to adopt an interpre-\n  tation of the Act requiring a source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit\n  on the sole basis of its potential greenhouse-gas emissions. Pp. 10–\n  24.\n       (a) The Act does not compel EPA’s interpretation. Massachusetts\n  held that the Act-wide definition of “air pollutant” includes green-\n  house gases, 549 U. S., at 529, but where the term “air pollutant” ap-\n  pears in the Act’s operative provisions, including the PSD and Title V\n  permitting provisions, EPA has routinely given it a narrower, con-\n  text-appropriate meaning. Massachusetts did not invalidate those\n  longstanding constructions. The Act-wide definition is not a com-\n  mand to regulate, but a description of the universe of substances EPA\n  may consider regulating under the Act’s operative provisions.\n  Though Congress’s profligate use of “air pollutant” is not conducive to\n  clarity, the presumption of consistent usage “ ‘readily yields’ ” to con-\n  text, and a statutory term “may take on distinct characters from as-\n  sociation with distinct statutory objects calling for different imple-\n  mentation strategies.” Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp.,\n  549 U. S. 561, 574. Pp. 10–16.\n       (b) Nor does the Act permit EPA’s interpretation. Agencies em-\n  powered to resolve statutory ambiguities must operate “within the\n  bounds of reasonable interpretation,” Arlington v. FCC, 569 U. S. ___,\n  ___. EPA has repeatedly acknowledged that applying the PSD and\n  Title V permitting requirements to greenhouse gases would be incon-\n  sistent with the Act’s structure and design. A review of the relevant\n  statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD program and Title\n  V are designed to apply to, and cannot rationally be extended beyond,\n  a relative handful of large sources capable of shouldering heavy sub-\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

EPA’s interpretation would also\n  bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in EPA’s\n  regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization. FDA\n  v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 160. Pp. 16–20.\n        (c) EPA lacked authority to “tailor” the Act’s unambiguous nu-\n  merical thresholds of 100 or 250 tons per year to accommodate its\n  greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the permitting triggers.\n  Agencies must always “ ‘give effect to the unambiguously expressed\n  intent of Congress.’ ” National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders\n  of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 665. The power to execute the laws does\n  not include a power to revise clear statutory terms that turn out not\n  to work in practice. Pp. 20–24.\n     2. EPA reasonably interpreted the Act to require sources that\n  would need permits based on their emission of conventional pollu-\n  tants to comply with BACT for greenhouse gases. Pp. 24–29.\n        (a) Concerns that BACT, which has traditionally been about end-\n  of-stack controls, is fundamentally unsuited to greenhouse-gas regu-\n  lation, which is more about energy use, are not unfounded. But an\n  EPA guidance document states that BACT analysis should consider\n  options other than energy efficiency, including “carbon capture and\n  storage,” which EPA contends is reasonably comparable to more tra-\n  ditional, end-of-stack BACT technologies. Moreover, assuming that\n  BACT may be used to force improvements in energy efficiency, im-\n  portant limitations on BACT may work to mitigate concerns about\n  “unbounded” regulatory authority. Pp. 24–27.\n        (b) EPA’s decision to require BACT for greenhouse gases emitted\n  by sources otherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a\n  permissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron U. S. A. Inc.\n  v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. The specif-\n  ic phrasing of the BACT provision—which requires BACT “for each\n  pollutant subject to regulation under” the Act, §7475(a)(4)—does not\n  suggest that the provision can bear a narrowing construction. And\n  even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to greenhouse gases is\n  not so disastrously unworkable, and need not result in such a dra-\n  matic expansion of agency authority, as to make EPA’s interpretation\n  unreasonable.

S. C. §§7401–7671q, the Environmental\nProtection Agency recently set standards for emissions of\n“greenhouse gases” (substances it believes contribute to\n“global climate change”) from new motor vehicles. We\nmust decide whether it was permissible for EPA to deter-\nmine that its motor-vehicle greenhouse-gas regulations\nautomatically triggered permitting requirements under\nthe Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases.\n                       I. Background\n              A. Stationary-Source Permitting\n   The Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating emis-\nsions from both stationary sources, such as factories and\npowerplants, and moving sources, such as cars, trucks,\nand aircraft. This litigation concerns permitting obliga-\ntions imposed on stationary sources under Titles I and V\nof the Act.\n   Title I charges EPA with formulating national ambient\nair quality standards (NAAQS) for air pollutants. §§7408–\n7409. To date, EPA has issued NAAQS for six pollutants:\nsulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon\nmonoxide, ozone, and lead. Clean Air Act Handbook 125\n(J. Domike & A. Zacaroli eds., 3d ed. 2011); see generally\n40 CFR pt. 50 (2013). States have primary responsibility\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor implementing the NAAQS by developing “State imple-\nmentation plans.” 42 U. S. C. §7410. A State must desig-\nnate every area within its borders as “attainment,” “non-\nattainment,” or “unclassifiable” with respect to each\nNAAQS, §7407(d), and the State’s implementation plan\nmust include permitting programs for stationary sources\nthat vary according to the classification of the area where\nthe source is or is proposed to be located. §7410(a)(2)(C),\n(I).\n   Stationary sources in areas designated attainment or\nunclassifiable are subject to the Act’s provisions relating to\n“Prevention of Significant Deterioration” (PSD). §§7470–\n7492. EPA interprets the PSD provisions to apply to\nsources located in areas that are designated attainment or\nunclassifiable for any NAAQS pollutant, regardless of\nwhether the source emits that specific pollutant. Since the\ninception of the PSD program, every area of the country\nhas been designated attainment or unclassifiable for at\nleast one NAAQS pollutant; thus, on EPA’s view, all sta-\ntionary sources are potentially subject to PSD review.\n   It is unlawful to construct or modify a “major emitting\nfacility” in “any area to which [the PSD program] applies”\nwithout first obtaining a permit. §§7475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C).\nTo qualify for a permit, the facility must not cause or\ncontribute to the violation of any applicable air-quality\nstandard, §7475(a)(3), and it must comply with emissions\nlimitations that reflect the “best available control technol-\nogy” (or BACT) for “each pollutant subject to regulation\nunder” the Act. §7475(a)(4). The Act defines a “major\nemitting facility” as any stationary source with the poten-\ntial to emit 250 tons per year of “any air pollutant” (or 100\ntons per year for certain types of sources). §7479(1). It\ndefines “modification” as a physical or operational change\nthat causes the facility to emit more of “any air pollutant.”\n4                UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n§7411(a)(4).1\n  In addition to the PSD permitting requirements for\nconstruction and modification, Title V of the Act makes it\nunlawful to operate any “major source,” wherever located,\nwithout a comprehensive operating permit. §7661a(a).\nUnlike the PSD program, Title V generally does not im-\npose any substantive pollution-control requirements.\nInstead, it is designed to facilitate compliance and en-\nforcement by consolidating into a single document all of a\nfacility’s obligations under the Act. The permit must\ninclude all “emissions limitations and standards” that\napply to the source, as well as associated inspection, moni-\ntoring, and reporting requirements. §7661c(a)–(c). Title V\ndefines a “major source” by reference to the Act-wide\ndefinition of “major stationary source,” which in turn\nmeans any stationary source with the potential to emit\n100 tons per year of “any air pollutant.” §§7661(2)(B),\n7602( j).\n          B. EPA’s Greenhouse-Gas Regulations\n  In 2007, the Court held that Title II of the Act “author-\nize[d] EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new\nmotor vehicles” if the Agency “form[ed] a ‘judgment’ that\n——————\n    1 Although the statute sets numerical thresholds (100 or 250 tons per\nyear) for emissions that will make a facility “major,” it does not specify\nby how much a physical or operational change must increase emissions\nto constitute a permit-requiring “modification.” Nor does it say how\nmuch of a given regulated pollutant a “major emitting facility” must\nemit before it is subject to BACT for that pollutant. EPA, however, has\nestablished pollutant-specific numerical thresholds below which a\nfacility’s emissions of a pollutant, and increases therein, are considered\nde minimis for those purposes. See 40 CFR §§51.166(b)(2)(i), (23), (39),\n(j)(2)–(3), 52.21(b)(2)(i), (23), (40), (j)(2)–(3); see also Alabama Power Co.\nv.

S. 214, 231 (1992) (“[D]e minimis non curat lex\n. . . is part of the established background of legal principles against\nwhich all enactments are adopted”).\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

In\nresponse to that decision, EPA embarked on a course of\nregulation resulting in “the single largest expansion in the\nscope of the [Act] in its history.” Clean Air Act Handbook,\nat xxi.\n   EPA first asked the public, in a notice of proposed rule-\nmaking, to comment on how the Agency should respond to\nMassachusetts. In doing so, it explained that regulating\ngreenhouse-gas emissions from motor vehicles could have\nfar-reaching consequences for stationary sources. Under\nEPA’s view, once greenhouse gases became regulated\nunder any part of the Act, the PSD and Title V permitting\nrequirements would apply to all stationary sources with\nthe potential to emit greenhouse gases in excess of the\nstatutory thresholds: 100 tons per year under Title V, and\n100 or 250 tons per year under the PSD program depend-\ning on the type of source. 73 Fed. Reg. 44420, 44498,\n44511 (2008). Because greenhouse-gas emissions tend to\nbe “orders of magnitude greater” than emissions of con-\nventional pollutants, EPA projected that numerous small\nsources not previously regulated under the Act would be\nswept into the PSD program and Title V, including “smaller\nindustrial sources,” “large office and residential build-\nings, hotels, large retail establishments, and similar facili-\nties.” Id., at 44498–44499. The Agency warned that this\nwould constitute an “unprecedented expansion of EPA\nauthority that would have a profound effect on virtually\nevery sector of the economy and touch every household in\nthe land,” yet still be “relatively ineffective at reducing\ngreenhouse gas concentrations.” Id., at 44355.2\n——————\n  2 Comments from other Executive Branch agencies reprinted in the\n\nnotice echoed those concerns. See, e.g., 73 Fed. Reg. 44360 (Depart-\nments of Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation, and Energy noting\nEPA would “exercis[e] de facto zoning authority through control over\nthousands of what formerly were local or private decisions, impacting\n6            UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 2009, EPA announced its determination regarding\nthe danger posed by motor-vehicle greenhouse-gas emis-\nsions. EPA found that greenhouse-gas emissions from\nnew motor vehicles contribute to elevated atmospheric\nconcentrations of greenhouse gases, which endanger pub-\nlic health and welfare by fostering global “climate change.”\n74 Fed. Reg. 66523, 66537 (hereinafter Endangerment\nFinding). It denominated a “single air pollutant” the\n“combined mix” of six greenhouse gases that it identified\nas “the root cause of human-induced climate change”:\ncarbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocar-\nbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Id., at\n66516, 66537. A source’s greenhouse-gas emissions would\nbe measured in “carbon dioxide equivalent units” (CO2e),\nwhich would be calculated based on each gas’s “global\nwarming potential.” Id., at 66499, n. 4.\n   Next, EPA issued its “final decision” regarding the\nprospect that motor-vehicle greenhouse-gas standards\nwould trigger stationary-source permitting requirements.\n75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (2010) (hereinafter Triggering Rule).\nEPA announced that beginning on the effective date of its\ngreenhouse-gas standards for motor vehicles, stationary\nsources would be subject to the PSD program and Title V\non the basis of their potential to emit greenhouse gases.\nAs expected, EPA in short order promulgated greenhouse-\ngas emission standards for passenger cars, light-duty\n——————\nthe construction of schools, hospitals, and commercial and residential\ndevelopment”); id., at 44383 (Council of Economic Advisers and Office\nof Science and Technology Policy stating that “[s]mall manufacturing\nfacilities, schools, and shopping centers” would be subject to “full major\nsource permitting”); id., at 44385 (Council on Environmental Quality\nnoting “the prospect of essentially automatic and immediate regulation\nover a vast range of community and business activity”); id., at 44391\n(Small Business Administration finding it “difficult to overemphasize\nhow potentially disruptive and burdensome such a new regulatory\nregime would be to small entities” such as “office buildings, retail\nestablishments, hotels, . . . schools, prisons, and private hospitals”).\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Reg. 25324 (hereinafter\nTailpipe Rule).\n   EPA then announced steps it was taking to “tailor” the\nPSD program and Title V to greenhouse gases. 75 Fed.\nReg. 31514 (hereinafter Tailoring Rule). Those steps were\nnecessary, it said, because the PSD program and Title V\nwere designed to regulate “a relatively small number of\nlarge industrial sources,” and requiring permits for all\nsources with greenhouse-gas emissions above the statu-\ntory thresholds would radically expand those programs,\nmaking them both unadministrable and “unrecognizable\nto the Congress that designed” them. Id., at 31555, 31562.\nEPA nonetheless rejected calls to exclude greenhouse\ngases entirely from those programs, asserting that the Act\nis not “ambiguous with respect to the need to cover\n[greenhouse-gas] sources under either the PSD or title V\nprogram.” Id., at 31548, n. 31. Instead, EPA adopted a\n“phase-in approach” that it said would “appl[y] PSD and\ntitle V at threshold levels that are as close to the statutory\nlevels as possible, and do so as quickly as possible, at least\nto a certain point.” Id., at 31523.\n   The phase-in, EPA said, would consist of at least three\nsteps. During Step 1, from January 2 through June 30,\n2011, no source would become newly subject to the PSD\nprogram or Title V solely on the basis of its greenhouse-\ngas emissions; however, sources required to obtain permits\nanyway because of their emission of conventional pollu-\ntants (so-called “anyway” sources) would need to comply\nwith BACT for greenhouse gases if they emitted those\ngases in significant amounts, defined as at least 75,000\ntons per year CO2e. Ibid. During Step 2, from July 1,\n2011, through June 30, 2012, sources with the potential to\nemit at least 100,000 tons per year CO2e of greenhouse\ngases would be subject to PSD and Title V permitting for\ntheir construction and operation and to PSD permitting\n8           UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

Id., at\n31523–31524.3 At Step 3, beginning on July 1, 2013, EPA\nsaid it might (or might not) further reduce the permitting\nthresholds (though not below 50,000 tons per year CO2e),\nand it might (or might not) establish permanent exemp-\ntions for some sources. Id., at 31524. Beyond Step 3, EPA\npromised to complete another round of rulemaking by\nApril 30, 2016, in which it would “take further action to\naddress small sources,” which might (or might not) include\nestablishing permanent exemptions.

Second, we\nmust decide whether EPA permissibly determined that a\nsource already subject to the PSD program because of its\nemission of conventional pollutants (an “anyway” source)\nmay be required to limit its greenhouse-gas emissions by\nemploying the “best available control technology” for\ngreenhouse gases. The Solicitor General joins issue on\nboth points but evidently regards the second as more\nimportant; he informs us that “anyway” sources account\n10          UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

Under Chevron, we presume that when\nan agency-administered statute is ambiguous with respect\nto what it prescribes, Congress has empowered the agency\nto resolve the ambiguity. The question for a reviewing\ncourt is whether in doing so the agency has acted reasona-\nbly and thus has “stayed within the bounds of its statutory\nauthority.” Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.

The PSD and Title V Triggers\n  We first decide whether EPA permissibly interpreted\nthe statute to provide that a source may be required to\nobtain a PSD or Title V permit on the sole basis of its\npotential greenhouse-gas emissions.\n                            1\n   EPA thought its conclusion that a source’s greenhouse-\ngas emissions may necessitate a PSD or Title V permit\nfollowed from the Act’s unambiguous language.

S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals reasoned by way of a flawed syllo-\ngism: Under Massachusetts, the general, Act-wide defini-\ntion of “air pollutant” includes greenhouse gases; the Act\nrequires permits for major emitters of “any air pollutant”;\ntherefore, the Act requires permits for major emitters of\ngreenhouse gases. The conclusion follows from the prem-\nises only if the air pollutants referred to in the permit-\nrequiring provisions (the minor premise) are the same air\npollutants encompassed by the Act-wide definition as\ninterpreted in Massachusetts (the major premise). Yet no\none—least of all EPA—endorses that proposition, and it is\nobviously untenable.\n   The Act-wide definition says that an air pollutant is\n“any air pollution agent or combination of such agents,\nincluding any physical, chemical, biological, [or] radioac-\ntive . . . substance or matter which is emitted into or oth-\nerwise enters the ambient air.” §7602(g). In Massachu­\nsetts, the Court held that the Act-wide definition includes\ngreenhouse gases because it is all-encompassing; it “em-\nbraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe.” 549\nU. S., at 529. But where the term “air pollutant” appears\nin the Act’s operative provisions, EPA has routinely given\nit a narrower, context-appropriate meaning.\n   That is certainly true of the provisions that require PSD\nand Title V permitting for major emitters of “any air pollu-\ntant.” Since 1978, EPA’s regulations have interpreted “air\npollutant” in the PSD permitting trigger as limited to\nregulated air pollutants, 43 Fed. Reg. 26403, codified, as\namended, 40 CFR §52.21(b)(1)–(2), (50)—a class much\nnarrower than Massachusetts’ “all airborne compounds of\n—————— \n\nments petitioners have made before this Court apply to Title V as well\n\nas the PSD program. See Brief for Federal Respondents 56. We agree,\n\nand we are satisfied that those arguments were also made below. See,\n\ne.g., Brief for State Petitioners et al. in No. 10–1073 etc. (CADC), pp.\n\n59–73; Brief for Non-State Petitioners et al. in No. 10–1073 etc.\n\n(CADC), pp. 46–47. \n\n12         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhatever stripe,” 549 U. S., at 529. And since 1993 EPA\nhas informally taken the same position with regard to the\nTitle V permitting trigger, a position the Agency ultimately\nincorporated into some of the regulations at issue here.\nSee Memorandum from Lydia N. Wegman, Deputy Direc-\ntor, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to Air\nDivision Director, Regions I–X, pp. 4–5 (Apr. 26, 1993);\nTailoring Rule 31607–31608 (amending 40 CFR §§70.2,\n71.2). Those interpretations were appropriate: It is plain\nas day that the Act does not envision an elaborate, bur-\ndensome permitting process for major emitters of steam,\noxygen, or other harmless airborne substances. It takes\nsome cheek for EPA to insist that it cannot possibly give\n“air pollutant” a reasonable, context-appropriate meaning\nin the PSD and Title V contexts when it has been doing\nprecisely that for decades.\n  Nor are those the only places in the Act where EPA has\ninferred from statutory context that a generic reference to\nair pollutants does not encompass every substance falling\nwithin the Act-wide definition. Other examples abound:\n\n     \t The Act authorizes EPA to enforce new source per-\n        formance standards (NSPS) against a pre-existing\n        source if, after promulgation of the standards, the\n        source undergoes a physical or operational change\n        that increases its emission of “any air pollutant.”\n        §7411(a)(2), (4), (b)(1)(B). EPA interprets that pro-\n        vision as limited to air pollutants for which EPA\n        has promulgated new source performance stand­\n        ards. 36 Fed. Reg. 24877 (1971), codified, as\n        amended, 40 CFR §60.2; 40 Fed. Reg. 58419 (1975),\n        codified, as amended, 40 CFR §60.14(a).\n\n     \t The Act requires a permit for the construction or\n        operation in a nonattainment area of a source with\n        the potential to emit 100 tons per year of “any air\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

EPA interprets\n      that provision as limited to pollutants for which the\n      area is designated nonattainment. 45 Fed. Reg.\n      52745 (1980), promulgating 40 CFR §51.18(j)(2), as\n      amended, §51.165(a)(2).\n\n   \t The Act directs EPA to require “enhanced monitor-\n      ing and submission of compliance certifications” for\n      any source with the potential to emit 100 tons per\n      year of “any air pollutant.” §§7414(a)(3), 7602(j).\n      EPA interprets that provision as limited to regulated\n      pollutants. 62 Fed. Reg. 54941 (1997), codified\n      at 40 CFR §§64.1, 64.2.\n\n   \t The Act requires certain sources of air pollutants\n      that interfere with visibility to undergo retrofitting\n      if they have the potential to emit 250 tons per year\n      of “any pollutant.” §7491(b)(2)(A), (g)(7). EPA in-\n      terprets that provision as limited to visibility­\n      impairing air pollutants. 70 Fed. Reg. 39160\n      (2005), codified at 40 CFR pt. 51, App. Y, §II.A.3.\n\nAlthough these limitations are nowhere to be found in the\nAct-wide definition, in each instance EPA has concluded—\nas it has in the PSD and Title V context—that the statute\nis not using “air pollutant” in Massachusetts’ broad sense\nto mean any airborne substance whatsoever.\n   Massachusetts did not invalidate all these longstanding\nconstructions. That case did not hold that EPA must\nalways regulate greenhouse gases as an “air pollutant”\neverywhere that term appears in the statute, but only that\nEPA must “ground its reasons for action or inaction in the\nstatute,” 549 U. S., at 535 (emphasis added), rather than\non “reasoning divorced from the statutory text,” id., at\n532. EPA’s inaction with regard to Title II was not suffi-\nciently grounded in the statute, the Court said, in part\n14          UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause nothing in the Act suggested that regulating\ngreenhouse gases under that Title would conflict with the\nstatutory design. Title II would not compel EPA to regu-\nlate in any way that would be “extreme,” “counterintui-\ntive,” or contrary to “ ‘common sense.’ ” Id., at 531. At\nmost, it would require EPA to take the modest step of\nadding greenhouse-gas standards to the roster of new-\nmotor-vehicle emission regulations. Ibid.\n   Massachusetts does not strip EPA of authority to ex-\nclude greenhouse gases from the class of regulable air\npollutants under other parts of the Act where their inclu-\nsion would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme. The\nAct-wide definition to which the Court gave a “sweeping”\nand “capacious” interpretation, id., at 528, 532, is not a\ncommand to regulate, but a description of the universe of\nsubstances EPA may consider regulating under the Act’s\noperative provisions. Massachusetts does not foreclose the\nAgency’s use of statutory context to infer that certain of\nthe Act’s provisions use “air pollutant” to denote not every\nconceivable airborne substance, but only those that may\nsensibly be encompassed within the particular regulatory\nprogram. As certain amici felicitously put it, while Mas­\nsachusetts “rejected EPA’s categorical contention that\ngreenhouse gases could not be ‘air pollutants’ for any\npurposes of the Act,” it did not “embrace EPA’s current,\nequally categorical position that greenhouse gases must be\nair pollutants for all purposes” regardless of the statutory\ncontext. Brief for Administrative Law Professors et al. as\nAmici Curiae 17.5\n——————\n  5 Our decision in American Elec. Power Co. v. Connecticut, 564 U. S.\n\n___ (2011), does not suggest otherwise.

S. ____ (2014)               15\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   To be sure, Congress’s profligate use of “air pollutant”\nwhere what is meant is obviously narrower than the Act-\nwide definition is not conducive to clarity. One ordinarily\nassumes “ ‘that identical words used in different parts of\nthe same act are intended to have the same meaning.’ ”\nEnvironmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp., 549 U. S.\n561, 574 (2007). In this respect (as in countless others),\nthe Act is far from a chef d’oeuvre of legislative draftsman-\nship. But we, and EPA, must do our best, bearing in mind\nthe “ ‘fundamental canon of statutory construction that the\nwords of a statute must be read in their context and with a\nview to their place in the overall statutory scheme.’ ” FDA\nv. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133\n(2000). As we reiterated the same day we decided Massa­\nchusetts, the presumption of consistent usage “ ‘readily\nyields’ ” to context, and a statutory term—even one defined\nin the statute—“may take on distinct characters from\nassociation with distinct statutory objects calling for dif-\nferent implementation strategies.” Duke Energy, supra, at\n574.\n   We need not, and do not, pass on the validity of all the\nlimiting constructions EPA has given the term “air pollu-\ntant” throughout the Act. We merely observe that taken\ntogether, they belie EPA’s rigid insistence that when\ninterpreting the PSD and Title V permitting requirements\nit is bound by the Act-wide definition’s inclusion of green-\nhouse gases, no matter how incompatible that inclusion is\nwith those programs’ regulatory structure.\n   In sum, there is no insuperable textual barrier to EPA’s\ninterpreting “any air pollutant” in the permitting triggers\nof PSD and Title V to encompass only pollutants emitted\nin quantities that enable them to be sensibly regulated at\nthe statutory thresholds, and to exclude those atypical\n—————— \n\nnot at issue here and one that no party in American Electric Power\n\nargued was ill suited to accommodating greenhouse gases. \n\n16           UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). And\nreasonable statutory interpretation must account for both\n“the specific context in which . . . language is used” and\n“the broader context of the statute as a whole.” Robinson\nv. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997). A statutory\n——————\n  6 During  the course of this litigation, several possible limiting con-\nstructions for the PSD trigger have been proposed. Judge Kavanaugh\nargued below that it would be plausible for EPA to read “any air pollu-\ntant” in the PSD context as limited to the six NAAQS pollutants. See\nCoalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc. v. EPA, No. 09–1322 etc.\n(CADC, Dec. 20, 2012), App. 171–180, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6621785</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *15–*18\n(opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Some petitioners\nmake a slightly different argument: that because PSD permitting is\nrequired only for major emitting facilities “in any area to which [the\nPSD program] applies,” §7475(a), the relevant pollutants are only those\nNAAQS pollutants for which the area in question is designated attain-\nment or unclassifiable. That approach would bring EPA’s interpreta-\ntion of the PSD trigger in line with its longstanding interpretation of\nthe permitting requirements for nonattainment areas. Others main-\ntain that “any air pollutant” in the PSD provision should be limited to\nair pollutants with localized effects on air quality. We do not foreclose\nEPA or the courts from considering those constructions in the future,\nbut we need not do so today.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often\nclarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme . . .\nbecause only one of the permissible meanings produces a\nsubstantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the\nlaw.” United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood\nForest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988). Thus,\nan agency interpretation that is “inconsisten[t] with the\ndesign and structure of the statute as a whole,” University\nof Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 13), does not merit deference.\n   EPA itself has repeatedly acknowledged that applying\nthe PSD and Title V permitting requirements to green-\nhouse gases would be inconsistent with—in fact, would\noverthrow—the Act’s structure and design. In the Tailor-\ning Rule, EPA described the calamitous consequences of\ninterpreting the Act in that way. Under the PSD program,\nannual permit applications would jump from about 800 to\nnearly 82,000; annual administrative costs would swell\nfrom $12 million to over $1.5 billion; and decade-long\ndelays in issuing permits would become common, causing\nconstruction projects to grind to a halt nationwide. Tailor-\ning Rule 31557. The picture under Title V was equally\nbleak: The number of sources required to have permits\nwould jump from fewer than 15,000 to about 6.1 million;\nannual administrative costs would balloon from $62 mil-\nlion to $21 billion; and collectively the newly covered\nsources would face permitting costs of $147 billion. Id., at\n31562–31563. Moreover, “the great majority of additional\nsources brought into the PSD and title V programs would\nbe small sources that Congress did not expect would need\nto undergo permitting.” Id., at 31533. EPA stated that\nthese results would be so “contrary to congressional in-\ntent,” and would so “severely undermine what Congress\nsought to accomplish,” that they necessitated as much as a\n1,000-fold increase in the permitting thresholds set forth\nin the statute. Id., at 31554, 31562.\n18        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Like EPA, we think it beyond reasonable debate that\nrequiring permits for sources based solely on their emis-\nsion of greenhouse gases at the 100- and 250-tons-per-year\nlevels set forth in the statute would be “incompatible” with\n“the substance of Congress’ regulatory scheme.” Brown &\nWilliamson, 529 U. S., at 156. A brief review of the rele-\nvant statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD\nprogram and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot\nrationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large\nsources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and\nprocedural burdens.\n  Start with the PSD program, which imposes numerous\nand costly requirements on those sources that are required\nto apply for permits. Among other things, the applicant\nmust make available a detailed scientific analysis of the\nsource’s potential pollution-related impacts, demonstrate\nthat the source will not contribute to the violation of any\napplicable pollution standard, and identify and use the\n“best available control technology” for each regulated\npollutant it emits. §7475(a)(3), (4), (6), (e). The permitting\nauthority (the State, usually) also bears its share of the\nburden: It must grant or deny a permit within a year,\nduring which time it must hold a public hearing on the\napplication. §7475(a)(2), (c).      Not surprisingly, EPA\nacknowledges that PSD review is a “complicated, resource-\nintensive, time-consuming, and sometimes contentious\nprocess” suitable for “hundreds of larger sources,” not\n“tens of thousands of smaller sources.” 74 Fed. Reg.\n55304, 55321–55322.\n  Title V contains no comparable substantive require-\nments but imposes elaborate procedural mandates. It\nrequires the applicant to submit, within a year of becom-\ning subject to Title V, a permit application and a “compli-\nance plan” describing how it will comply with “all applica-\nble requirements” under the Act; to certify its compliance\nannually; and to submit to “inspection, entry, monitoring,\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n. . . and reporting requirements.”            §§7661b(b)–(c),\n7661c(a)–(c). The procedural burdens on the permitting\nauthority and EPA are also significant. The permitting\nauthority must hold a public hearing on the application,\n§7661a(b)(6), and it must forward the application and any\nproposed permit to EPA and neighboring States and re-\nspond in writing to their comments, §7661d(a), (b)(1). If it\nfails to issue or deny the permit within 18 months, any\ninterested party can sue to require a decision “without\nadditional delay.” §§7661a(b)(7), 7661b(c). An interested\nparty also can petition EPA to block issuance of the per-\nmit; EPA must grant or deny the petition within 60 days,\nand its decision may be challenged in federal court.\n§7661d(b)(2)–(3). As EPA wrote, Title V is “finely crafted\nfor thousands,” not millions, of sources. Tailoring Rule\n31563.\n    The fact that EPA’s greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpre-\ntation of the PSD and Title V triggers would place plainly\nexcessive demands on limited governmental resources is\nalone a good reason for rejecting it; but that is not the only\nreason. EPA’s interpretation is also unreasonable because\nit would bring about an enormous and transformative\nexpansion in EPA’s regulatory authority without clear\ncongressional authorization. When an agency claims to\ndiscover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to\nregulate “a significant portion of the American economy,”\nBrown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159, we typically greet\nits announcement with a measure of skepticism. We\nexpect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to\nan agency decisions of vast “economic and political signifi-\ncance.” Id., at 160; see also MCI Telecommunications\nCorp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S.\n218, 231 (1994); Industrial Union Dept., AFL–CIO v.\nAmerican Petroleum Institute, 448 U. S. 607, 645–646\n(1980) (plurality opinion).

EPA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nand the operation of millions, of small sources nationwide\nfalls comfortably within the class of authorizations that we\nhave been reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory text.\nMoreover, in EPA’s assertion of that authority, we con-\nfront a singular situation: an agency laying claim to ex-\ntravagant statutory power over the national economy\nwhile at the same time strenuously asserting that the\nauthority claimed would render the statute “unrecogniza-\nble to the Congress that designed” it. Tailoring Rule\n31555. Since, as we hold above, the statute does not com-\npel EPA’s interpretation, it would be patently unreason-\nable—not to say outrageous—for EPA to insist on seizing\nexpansive power that it admits the statute is not designed\nto grant.7\n                             3\n  EPA thought that despite the foregoing problems, it\ncould make its interpretation reasonable by adjusting the\nlevels at which a source’s greenhouse-gas emissions would\n——————\n  7 A few additional points bear mentioning.      The Solicitor General\nconjectures that EPA might eventually alter its longstanding interpre-\ntation of “potential to emit” in order to reduce the number of sources\nrequired to have permits at the statutory thresholds. But neither he\nnor the Agency has given us any reason to believe that there exists a\nplausible reading of “potential to emit” that EPA would willingly adopt\nand that would eliminate the unreasonableness of EPA’s interpretation.\nNor have we been given any information about the ability of other\npossible “streamlining” techniques alluded to by EPA—such as “gen-\neral” or “electronic” permitting—to reduce the administrability prob-\nlems identified above; and in any event, none of those techniques would\naddress the more fundamental problem of EPA’s claiming regulatory\nauthority over millions of small entities that it acknowledges the Act\ndoes not seek to regulate. Finally, the Solicitor General suggests that\nthe incompatibility of greenhouse gases with the PSD program and\nTitle V results chiefly from the inclusion of carbon dioxide in the\n“aggregate pollutant” defined by EPA. We decide these cases on the\nbasis of the pollutant “greenhouse gases” as EPA has defined and\nregulated it, and we express no view on how our analysis might change\nwere EPA to define it differently.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noblige it to undergo PSD and Title V permitting. Although\nthe Act, in no uncertain terms, requires permits for\nsources with the potential to emit more than 100 or 250\ntons per year of a relevant pollutant, EPA in its Tailoring\nRule wrote a new threshold of 100,000 tons per year for\ngreenhouse gases. Since the Court of Appeals thought the\nstatute unambiguously made greenhouse gases capable of\ntriggering PSD and Title V, it held that petitioners lacked\nArticle III standing to challenge the Tailoring Rule be-\ncause that rule did not injure petitioners but merely re-\nlaxed the pre-existing statutory requirements. Because\nwe, however, hold that EPA’s greenhouse-gas-inclusive\ninterpretation of the triggers was not compelled, and\nbecause EPA has essentially admitted that its interpreta-\ntion would be unreasonable without “tailoring,” we consider\nthe validity of the Tailoring Rule.\n   We conclude that EPA’s rewriting of the statutory\nthresholds was impermissible and therefore could not\nvalidate the Agency’s interpretation of the triggering\nprovisions. An agency has no power to “tailor” legislation\nto bureaucratic policy goals by rewriting unambiguous\nstatutory terms. Agencies exercise discretion only in the\ninterstices created by statutory silence or ambiguity; they\nmust always “ ‘give effect to the unambiguously expressed\nintent of Congress.’ ” National Assn. of Home Builders v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 665 (2007) (quoting\nChevron, 467 U. S., at 843). It is hard to imagine a statu-\ntory term less ambiguous than the precise numerical\nthresholds at which the Act requires PSD and Title V\npermitting. When EPA replaced those numbers with\nothers of its own choosing, it went well beyond the “bounds\nof its statutory authority.” Arlington, 569 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 5) (emphasis deleted).\n   The Solicitor General does not, and cannot, defend the\nTailoring Rule as an exercise of EPA’s enforcement discre-\ntion. The Tailoring Rule is not just an announcement of\n22        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nEPA’s refusal to enforce the statutory permitting require-\nments; it purports to alter those requirements and to\nestablish with the force of law that otherwise-prohibited\nconduct will not violate the Act. This alteration of the\nstatutory requirements was crucial to EPA’s “tailoring”\nefforts. Without it, small entities with the potential to\nemit greenhouse gases in amounts exceeding the statutory\nthresholds would have remained subject to citizen suits—\nauthorized by the Act—to enjoin their construction, modi-\nfication, or operation and to impose civil penalties of up to\n$37,500 per day of violation. §§7413(b), 7604(a), (f)(4); 40\nCFR §19.4. EPA itself has recently affirmed that the\n“independent enforcement authority” furnished by the\ncitizen-suit provision cannot be displaced by a permitting\nauthority’s decision not to pursue enforcement. 78 Fed.\nReg. 12477, 12486–12487 (2013). The Solicitor General is\ntherefore quite right to acknowledge that the availability\nof citizen suits made it necessary for EPA, in seeking\nto mitigate the unreasonableness of its greenhouse-gas-\ninclusive interpretation, to go beyond merely exercising its\nenforcement discretion. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 87–88.\n   For similar reasons, Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199\n(1974)—to which the Solicitor General points as the best\ncase supporting the Tailoring Rule, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 71,\n80–81—is irrelevant. In Ruiz, Congress had appropriated\nfunds for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to spend on provid-\ning assistance to “ ‘Indians throughout the United States’ ”\nand had not “impose[d] any geographical limitation on the\navailability of general assistance benefits.” Id., at 206–\n207, and n. 7. Although we held the Bureau could not\ndeny benefits to off-reservation Indians because it had not\npublished its eligibility criteria, we stated in dictum that\nthe Bureau could, if it followed proper administrative\nprocedures, “create reasonable classifications and eligibil-\nity requirements in order to allocate the limited funds\navailable.” Id., at 230–231. That dictum stands only for\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe unremarkable proposition that an agency may adopt\npolicies to prioritize its expenditures within the bounds\nestablished by Congress. See also Lincoln v. Vigil, 508\nU. S. 182, 192–193 (1993). Nothing in Ruiz remotely\nauthorizes an agency to modify unambiguous require-\nments imposed by a federal statute. An agency confront-\ning resource constraints may change its own conduct, but\nit cannot change the law.\n   Were we to recognize the authority claimed by EPA in\nthe Tailoring Rule, we would deal a severe blow to the\nConstitution’s separation of powers. Under our system of\ngovernment, Congress makes laws and the President,\nacting at times through agencies like EPA, “faithfully\nexecute[s]” them. U. S. Const., Art. II, §3; see Medellín v.\nTexas, 552 U. S. 491, 526–527 (2008). The power of exe-\ncuting the laws necessarily includes both authority and\nresponsibility to resolve some questions left open by Con-\ngress that arise during the law’s administration. But it\ndoes not include a power to revise clear statutory terms\nthat turn out not to work in practice. See, e.g., Barnhart\nv. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002) (agency\nlacked authority “to develop new guidelines or to assign\nliability in a manner inconsistent with” an “unambiguous\nstatute”).\n   In the Tailoring Rule, EPA asserts newfound authority\nto regulate millions of small sources—including retail\nstores, offices, apartment buildings, shopping centers,\nschools, and churches—and to decide, on an ongoing basis\nand without regard for the thresholds prescribed by Con-\ngress, how many of those sources to regulate. We are not\nwilling to stand on the dock and wave goodbye as EPA\nembarks on this multiyear voyage of discovery. We reaf-\nfirm the core administrative-law principle that an agency\nmay not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense\nof how the statute should operate. EPA therefore lacked\nauthority to “tailor” the Act’s unambiguous numerical\n24            UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

BACT for “Anyway” Sources\n  For the reasons we have given, EPA overstepped its\nstatutory authority when it decided that a source could\n——————\n  8 JUSTICE BREYER argues, post, at 10 (opinion concurring in part and\ndissenting in part), that when the statutory permitting thresholds of\n100 or 250 tons per year do not provide a “sensible regulatory line,”\nEPA is entitled to “read an unwritten exception” into “the particular\nnumber used by the statute”—by which he apparently means that the\nAgency is entitled to substitute a dramatically higher number, such as\n100,000. We are aware of no principle of administrative law that would\nallow an agency to rewrite such a clear statutory term, and we shudder\nto contemplate the effect that such a principle would have on demo-\ncratic governance.\n  JUSTICE BREYER, however, claims to perceive no difference between\n(a) reading the statute to exclude greenhouse gases from the term “any\nair pollutant” in the permitting triggers, and (b) reading the statute to\nexclude sources emitting less than 100,000 tons per year from the\nstatutory phrase “any . . . source with the potential to emit two hundred\nand fifty tons per year or more.” See post, at 7. The two could scarcely\nbe further apart. As we have explained (and as EPA agrees), statutory\ncontext makes plain that the Act’s operative provisions use “air pollu-\ntant” to denote less than the full range of pollutants covered by the Act-\nwide definition. See Part II–A–1, supra. It is therefore incumbent on\nEPA to specify the pollutants encompassed by that term in the context\nof a particular program, and to do so reasonably in light of that pro-\ngram’s overall regulatory scheme. But there is no ambiguity whatso-\never in the specific, numerical permitting thresholds, and thus no room\nfor EPA to exercise discretion in selecting a different threshold.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

But what about “anyway”\nsources, those that would need permits based on their\nemissions of more conventional pollutants (such as partic-\nulate matter)? We now consider whether EPA reasonably\ninterpreted the Act to require those sources to comply with\n“best available control technology” emission standards for\ngreenhouse gases.\n                               1\n   To obtain a PSD permit, a source must be “subject to the\nbest available control technology” for “each pollutant\nsubject to regulation under [the Act]” that it emits.\n§7475(a)(4). The Act defines BACT as “an emission limita-\ntion based on the maximum degree of reduction of each\npollutant subject to regulation” that is “achievable . . .\nthrough application of production processes and available\nmethods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning,\nclean fuels, or treatment or innovative fuel combustion\ntechniques.” §7479(3). BACT is determined “on a case-by-\ncase basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and\neconomic impacts and other costs.” Ibid.\n   Some petitioners urge us to hold that EPA may never\nrequire BACT for greenhouse gases—even when a source\nmust undergo PSD review based on its emissions of con-\nventional pollutants—because BACT is fundamentally\nunsuited to greenhouse-gas regulation. BACT, they say,\nhas traditionally been about end-of-stack controls “such as\ncatalytic converters or particle collectors”; but applying it\nto greenhouse gases will make it more about regulating\nenergy use, which will enable regulators to control “every\naspect of a facility’s operation and design,” right down to\nthe “light bulbs in the factory cafeteria.” Brief for Peti-\ntioner Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on\nGreenhouse Gas Regulation et al. in No. 12–1254, p. 7; see\nJoint Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 12–1248 etc., pp.\n26        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n14–15 (“BACT for [greenhouse gases] becomes an un-\nbounded exercise in command-and-control regulation” of\neverything from “efficient light bulbs” to “basic industrial\nprocesses”). But see Brief for Calpine Corp. as Amicus\nCuriae 10 (“[I]n Calpine’s experience with ‘anyway’\nsources, the [greenhouse-gas] analysis was only a small\npart of the overall permitting process”).\n  EPA has published a guidance document that lends\nsome credence to petitioners’ fears. It states that at least\ninitially, compulsory improvements in energy efficiency\nwill be the “foundation” of greenhouse-gas BACT, with\nmore traditional end-of-stack controls either not used or\n“added as they become more available.” PSD and Title V\nPermitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases 29 (Mar. 2011)\n(hereinafter Guidance); see Peloso & Dobbins, Greenhouse\nGas PSD Permitting: The Year in Review, 42 Tex. Env.\nL. J. 233, 247 (2012) (“Because [other controls] tend to\nprove infeasible, energy efficiency measures dominate the\n[greenhouse-gas] BACT controls approved by the states\nand EPA”). But EPA’s guidance also states that BACT\nanalysis should consider options other than energy effi-\nciency, such as “carbon capture and storage.” Guidance\n29, 32, 35–36, 42–43. EPA argues that carbon capture is\nreasonably comparable to more traditional, end-of-stack\nBACT technologies, id., at 32, n. 86, and petitioners do not\ndispute that.\n  Moreover, assuming without deciding that BACT may\nbe used to force some improvements in energy efficiency,\nthere are important limitations on BACT that may work\nto mitigate petitioners’ concerns about “unbounded” regu-\nlatory authority. For one, BACT is based on “control\ntechnology” for the applicant’s “proposed facility,”\n§7475(a)(4); therefore, it has long been held that BACT\ncannot be used to order a fundamental redesign of the\nfacility. See, e.g., Sierra Club v. EPA, 499 F. 3d 653, 654–\n655 (CA7 2007); In re Pennsauken Cty., N. J., Resource\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

For\nanother, EPA has long interpreted BACT as required only\nfor pollutants that the source itself emits, see 44 Fed. Reg.\n51947 (1979); accordingly, EPA acknowledges that BACT\nmay not be used to require “reductions in a facility’s de-\nmand for energy from the electric grid.” Guidance 24.\nFinally, EPA’s guidance suggests that BACT should not\nrequire every conceivable change that could result in\nminor improvements in energy efficiency, such as the\naforementioned light bulbs. Id., at 31. The guidance\nexplains that permitting authorities should instead con-\nsider whether a proposed regulatory burden outweighs\nany reduction in emissions to be achieved, and should\nconcentrate on the facility’s equipment that uses the\nlargest amounts of energy. Ibid.\n                             2\n   The question before us is whether EPA’s decision to\nrequire BACT for greenhouse gases emitted by sources\notherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a\npermissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron.\nWe conclude that it is.\n   The text of the BACT provision is far less open-ended\nthan the text of the PSD and Title V permitting triggers.\nIt states that BACT is required “for each pollutant subject\nto regulation under this chapter” (i.e., the entire Act),\n§7475(a)(4), a phrase that—as the D. C. Circuit wrote 35\nyears ago—“would not seem readily susceptible [of] misin-\nterpretation.” Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F. 2d 323,\n404 (1979). Whereas the dubious breadth of “any air\npollutant” in the permitting triggers suggests a role for\nagency judgment in identifying the subset of pollutants\ncovered by the particular regulatory program at issue, the\nmore specific phrasing of the BACT provision suggests\nthat the necessary judgment has already been made by\nCongress. The wider statutory context likewise does not\n28        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuggest that the BACT provision can bear a narrowing\nconstruction: There is no indication that the Act elsewhere\nuses, or that EPA has interpreted, “each pollutant subject\nto regulation under this chapter” to mean anything other\nthan what it says.\n   Even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to\ngreenhouse gases is not so disastrously unworkable, and\nneed not result in such a dramatic expansion of agency\nauthority, as to convince us that EPA’s interpretation is\nunreasonable. We are not talking about extending EPA\njurisdiction over millions of previously unregulated enti-\nties, but about moderately increasing the demands EPA\n(or a state permitting authority) can make of entities\nalready subject to its regulation. And it is not yet clear\nthat EPA’s demands will be of a significantly different\ncharacter from those traditionally associated with PSD\nreview. In short, the record before us does not establish\nthat the BACT provision as written is incapable of being\nsensibly applied to greenhouse gases.\n   We acknowledge the potential for greenhouse-gas BACT\nto lead to an unreasonable and unanticipated degree of\nregulation, and our decision should not be taken as an\nendorsement of all aspects of EPA’s current approach, nor\nas a free rein for any future regulatory application of\nBACT in this distinct context. Our narrow holding is that\nnothing in the statute categorically prohibits EPA from\ninterpreting the BACT provision to apply to greenhouse\ngases emitted by “anyway” sources.\n   However, EPA may require an “anyway” source to com-\nply with greenhouse-gas BACT only if the source emits\nmore than a de minimis amount of greenhouse gases. As\nnoted above, the Tailoring Rule applies BACT only if a\nsource emits greenhouse gases in excess of 75,000 tons per\nyear CO2e, but the Rule makes clear that EPA did not\narrive at that number by identifying the de minimis level.\nSee nn. 1, 3, supra.

We do not hold that\n75,000 tons per year CO2e necessarily exceeds a true de\nminimis level, only that EPA must justify its selection on\nproper grounds. Cf. Alabama Power, supra, at 405.9\n                        *     *    *\n   To sum up: We hold that EPA exceeded its statutory\nauthority when it interpreted the Clean Air Act to require\nPSD and Title V permitting for stationary sources based\non their greenhouse-gas emissions. Specifically, the Agency\nmay not treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant for pur-\nposes of defining a “major emitting facility” (or a “modifi-\ncation” thereof) in the PSD context or a “major source” in\nthe Title V context. To the extent its regulations purport\nto do so, they are invalid. EPA may, however, continue to\ntreat greenhouse gases as a “pollutant subject to regula-\ntion under this chapter” for purposes of requiring BACT\nfor “anyway” sources. The judgment of the Court of Ap-\npeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n——————\n  9 JUSTICE ALITO argues that BACT is “fundamentally incompatible”\n\nwith greenhouse gases for two reasons. Post, at 4 (opinion concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). First, BACT requires consideration of\n“ambient air quality at the proposed site and in areas which may be\naffected by emissions from [the proposed] facility for each pollutant\nsubject to regulation under this chapter,” §7475(e)(1); see also\n§7475(e)(3)(B); and it is not obvious how that requirement should apply,\nor even whether it can apply, to greenhouse gases. Post, at 4–5. But\nthe possibility that that requirement may be inoperative as to green-\nhouse gases does not convince us that they must be categorically\nexcluded from BACT even though they are indisputably a “pollutant\nsubject to regulation.” Second, JUSTICE ALITO argues that EPA’s\nguidance on how to implement greenhouse-gas BACT is a recipe for\n“arbitrary and inconsistent decisionmaking.” Post, at 8. But we are not\nreviewing EPA’s guidance in these cases, and we cannot say that it is\nimpossible for EPA and state permitting authorities to devise rational\nways of complying with the statute’s directive to determine BACT for\ngreenhouse gases “on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy,\nenvironmental, and economic impacts and other costs.” §7479(3).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), we held\nthat greenhouse gases fall within the Clean Air Act’s\ngeneral definition of the term “air pollutant,” 42 U. S. C.\n§7602(g). 549 U. S., at 528–529. We also held, conse-\nquently, that the Environmental Protection Agency is\nempowered and required by Title II of the Act to regulate\ngreenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources (such as\ncars and trucks) if it decides that greenhouse gases “con-\ntribute to . . . air pollution which may reasonably be antic-\nipated to endanger public health or welfare,” §7521(a)(1).\n549 U. S., at 532–533. The EPA determined that green-\nhouse gases endanger human health and welfare, 74 Fed.\nReg. 66496 (2009) (Endangerment Finding), and so it\nissued regulations for mobile emissions, 75 Fed. Reg.\n25324 (2010) (Tailpipe Rule).\n   These cases take as a given our decision in Massachu-\nsetts that the Act’s general definition of “air pollutant”\nincludes greenhouse gases. One of the questions posed by\nthese cases is whether those gases fall within the scope of\nthe phrase “any air pollutant” as that phrase is used in the\nmore specific provisions of the Act here at issue. The\nCourt’s answer is “no.” Ante, at 10–24. I disagree.\n   The Clean Air Act provisions at issue here are Title I’s\nPrevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program,\n§7470 et seq., and Title V’s permitting regime, §7661 et\nseq. By contrast to Title II, Titles I and V apply to sta-\ntionary sources, such as power plants and factories. Un-\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Title V requires each “major source” to obtain\nan operating permit. §7661a(a).\n  These cases concern the definitions of “major emitting\nfacility” and “major source,” each of which is defined to\nmean any stationary source that emits more than a\nthreshold quantity of “any air pollutant.” See §7479(1)\n(“major emitting facility”); §§7602(j), 7661(2)(B) (“major\nsource”). To simplify the exposition, I will refer only to the\nPSD program and its definition of “major emitting facility”;\na parallel analysis applies to Title V.\n  As it is used in the PSD provisions,\n    “[t]he term ‘major emitting facility’ means any of [a\n    list of specific categories of] stationary sources of air\n    pollutants which emit, or have the potential to emit,\n    one hundred tons per year or more of any air pollutant\n    . . . . Such term also includes any other source with\n    the potential to emit two hundred and fifty tons per\n    year or more of any air pollutant.” §7479(1).\nTo simplify further, I will ignore the reference to specific\ntypes of source that emit at least 100 tons per year (tpy) of\nany air pollutant. In effect, we are dealing with a statute\nthat says that the PSD program’s regulatory requirements\nmust be applied to\n    “any stationary source that has the potential to emit\n    two hundred fifty tons per year or more of any air\n    pollutant.”\n  The interpretive difficulty in these cases arises out of\nthe definition’s use of the phrase “two hundred fifty tons\n4         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nper year or more,” which I will call the “250 tpy threshold.”\nWhen applied to greenhouse gases, 250 tpy is far too low a\nthreshold. As the Court explains, tens of thousands of\nstationary sources emit large quantities of one greenhouse\ngas, carbon dioxide. See ante, at 17–20, and n. 7. To\napply the programs at issue here to all those sources\nwould be extremely expensive and burdensome, counter-\nproductive, and perhaps impossible; it would also contra-\nvene Congress’s intent that the programs’ coverage be\nlimited to those large sources whose emissions are sub-\nstantial enough to justify the regulatory burdens. Ibid.\nThe EPA recognized as much, and it addressed the prob-\nlem by issuing a regulation—the Tailoring Rule—that\npurports to raise the coverage threshold for greenhouse\ngases from the statutory figure of 250 tpy to 100,000 tpy\nin order to keep the programs’ coverage limited to “a rela-\ntively small number of large industrial sources.” 75 Fed.\nReg. 31514, 31555 (2010); see id., at 31523–31524.\n   The Tailoring Rule solves the practical problems that\nwould have been caused by the 250 tpy threshold. But\nwhat are we to do about the statute’s language? The\nstatute specifies a definite number—250, not 100,000—\nand it says that facilities that are covered by that number\nmust meet the program’s requirements. The statute says\nnothing about agency discretion to change that number.\nWhat is to be done? How, given the statute’s language,\ncan the EPA exempt from regulation sources that emit\nmore than 250 but less than 100,000 tpy of greenhouse\ngases (and that also do not emit other regulated pollutants\nat threshold levels)?\n   The Court answers by (1) pointing out that regulation at\nthe 250 tpy threshold would produce absurd results, (2)\nrefusing to read the statute as compelling such results,\nand (3) consequently interpreting the phrase “any air\npollutant” as containing an implicit exception for green-\nhouse gases.

FCC v. NextWave Personal Communications\nInc., 537 U. S. 293, 311 (2003) (BREYER, J., dissenting)\n(“ ‘Tell all customers that . . .’ does not refer to every cus-\ntomer of every business in the world”). Rather, “[g]eneral\nterms as used on particular occasions often carry with\nthem implied restrictions as to scope,” ibid., and so courts\nmust interpret the word “any,” like all other words, in\ncontext. As Judge Learned Hand pointed out when inter-\npreting another statute many years ago, “[w]e can best\nreach the meaning here, as always, by recourse to the\nunderlying purpose, and, with that as a guide, by trying to\nproject upon the specific occasion how we think persons,\nactuated by such a purpose, would have dealt with it, if it\nhad been presented to them at the time.” Borella v. Bor-\nden Co., 145 F. 2d 63, 64 (CA2 1944). The pursuit of that\nunderlying purpose may sometimes require us to “aban-\ndon” a “literal interpretation” of a word like “any.” Id., at\n64–65.\n6         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n    The law has long recognized that terms such as “any”\nadmit of unwritten limitations and exceptions. Legal\nphilosophers like to point out that a statute providing that\n“ ‘[w]hoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be\npunished by death’ ” need not encompass a man who kills\nin self-defense; nor must an ordinance imposing fines upon\nthose who occupy a public parking spot for more than two\nhours penalize a driver who is unable to move because of a\nparade. See Fuller, The Case of the Speluncean Explorers,\n62 Harv. L. Rev. 616, 619, 624 (1949); see also United\nStates v.

The maxim cessante\nratione legis cessat ipse lex—where a law’s rationale ceases\nto apply, so does the law itself—is not of recent origin.\nSee, e.g., Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 699 (2001)\n(citing 1 E. Coke, Institutes *70b); Green v. Liter, 8 Cranch\n229, 249 (1814) (Story, J.) (“cessante ratione, cessat ipsa\nlex”).\n    I also agree with the Court’s point that “a generic refer-\nence to air pollutants” in the Clean Air Act need not “en-\ncompass every substance falling within the Act-wide\ndefinition” that we construed in Massachusetts, §7602(g).\nSee ante, at 12–13. As the Court notes, the EPA has\ninterpreted the phrase “any air pollutant,” which is used\nseveral times in the Act, as limited to “air pollutants for\nwhich EPA has promulgated [new source performance\nstandards]” in the portion of the Act dealing with those\nstandards, as limited to “visibility-impairing air pollu-\ntants” in the part of the Act concerned with deleterious\neffects on visibility, and as limited to “pollutants for which\nthe area is designated nonattainment” in the part of the\nAct aimed at regions that fail to attain air quality stand-\nards. Ibid.\n    But I do not agree with the Court that the only way to\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\navoid an absurd or otherwise impermissible result in these\ncases is to create an atextual greenhouse gas exception to\nthe phrase “any air pollutant.” After all, the word “any”\nmakes an earlier appearance in the definitional provision,\nwhich defines “major emitting facility” to mean “any . . .\nsource with the potential to emit two hundred and fifty\ntons per year or more of any air pollutant.” §7479(1)\n(emphasis added). As a linguistic matter, one can just as\neasily read an implicit exception for small-scale green-\nhouse gas emissions into the phrase “any source” as into\nthe phrase “any air pollutant.” And given the purposes of\nthe PSD program and the Act as a whole, as well as the\nspecific roles of the different parts of the statutory defini-\ntion, finding flexibility in “any source” is far more sensible\nthan the Court’s route of finding it in “any air pollutant.”\n   The implicit exception I propose reads almost word for\nword the same as the Court’s, except that the location of\nthe exception has shifted. To repeat, the Court reads the\ndefinition of “major emitting facility” as if it referred to\n“any source with the potential to emit two hundred fifty\ntons per year or more of any air pollutant except for those\nair pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, with respect to\nwhich regulation at that threshold would be impractical or\nabsurd or would sweep in smaller sources that Congress\ndid not mean to cover.” I would simply move the implicit\nexception, which I’ve italicized, so that it applies to\n“source” rather than “air pollutant”: “any source with the\npotential to emit two hundred fifty tons per year or more\nof any air pollutant except for those sources, such as those\nemitting unmanageably small amounts of greenhouse\ngases, with respect to which regulation at that threshold\nwould be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller\nsources that Congress did not mean to cover.”\n   From a legal, administrative, and functional perspec-\ntive—that is, from a perspective that assumes that Con-\ngress was not merely trying to arrange words on paper but\n8         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nwas seeking to achieve a real-world purpose—my way of\nreading the statute is the more sensible one. For one\nthing, my reading is consistent with the specific purpose\nunderlying the 250 tpy threshold specified by the statute.\nThe purpose of that number was not to prevent the regula-\ntion of dangerous air pollutants that cannot be sensibly\nregulated at that particular threshold, though that is the\neffect that the Court’s reading gives the threshold. Ra-\nther, the purpose was to limit the PSD program’s obliga-\ntions to larger sources while exempting the many small\nsources whose emissions are low enough that imposing\nburdensome regulatory requirements on them would be\nsenseless.\n   Thus, the accompanying Senate Report explains that\nthe PSD program “is reasonable and necessary for very\nlarge sources, such as new electrical generating plants or\nnew steel mills. But the procedure would prove costly and\npotentially unreasonable if imposed on construction of\nstorage facilities for a small gasoline jobber or on the\nconstruction of a new heating plant at a junior college.”\nS. Rep. No. 95–127, p. 96 (1977). And the principal spon-\nsor of the Clean Air Act amendments at issue here, Sena-\ntor Edmund Muskie, told the Senate that the program\nwould not cover “houses, dairies, farms, highways, hospi-\ntals, schools, grocery stores, and other such sources.” 123\nCong. Rec. 18013, 18021 (1977).\n   The EPA, exercising the legal authority to which it is\nentitled under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), understood the\nthreshold’s purpose in the same light. It explained that\nCongress’s objective was\n    “to limit the PSD program to large industrial sources\n    because it was those sources that were the primary\n    cause of the pollution problems in question and be-\n    cause those sources would have the resources to com-\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Congress’s mecha-\n    nism for limiting PSD was the 100/250 tpy threshold\n    limitations. Focused as it was primarily on NAAQS\n    pollutants [that is, those air pollutants for which the\n    EPA has issued a national ambient air quality stand-\n    ard under Title I of the Act, see EPA v. EME Homer\n    City Generation, L. P., 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\n    op., at 4)], Congress considered sources that emit\n    NAAQS pollutants in those quantities generally to be\n    the large industrial sources to which it intended PSD\n    to be limited.” Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. 31555.\n   The Court similarly acknowledges that “the PSD pro-\ngram and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot\nrationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large\nsources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and\nprocedural burdens.” Ante, at 18; see also Alabama Power\nCo. v. Costle, 636 F. 2d 323, 353 (CADC 1979) (“Congress’s\nintention was to identify facilities which, due to their size,\nare financially able to bear the substantial regulatory\ncosts imposed by the PSD provisions and which, as a\ngroup, are primarily responsible for emission of the delete-\nrious pollutants that befoul our nation’s air”).\n   An implicit source-related exception would serve this\nstatutory purpose while going no further. The implicit\nexception that the Court reads into the phrase “any air\npollutant,” by contrast, goes well beyond the limited con-\ngressional objective. Nothing in the statutory text, the\nlegislative history, or common sense suggests that Con-\ngress, when it imposed the 250 tpy threshold, was trying\nto undermine its own deliberate decision to use the broad\nlanguage “any air pollutant” by removing some substances\n(rather than some facilities) from the PSD program’s\ncoverage.\n   For another thing, a source-related exception serves the\nflexible nature of the Clean Air Act. We observed in Mas-\n10        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nsachusetts that “[w]hile the Congresses that drafted” the\nAct “might not have appreciated the possibility that burn-\ning fossil fuels could lead to global warming, they did\nunderstand that without regulatory flexibility, changing\ncircumstances and scientific developments would soon\nrender the Clean Air Act obsolete.” 549 U. S., at 532. We\nrecognized that “[t]he broad language of ” the Act-wide\ndefinition of “air pollutant” “reflects an intentional effort\nto confer the flexibility necessary to forestall such obsoles-\ncence.” Ibid.\n   The Court’s decision to read greenhouse gases out of the\nPSD program drains the Act of its flexibility and chips\naway at our decision in Massachusetts. What sense does it\nmake to read the Act as generally granting the EPA the\nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and then\nto read it as denying that power with respect to the pro-\ngrams for large stationary sources at issue here? It is\nanomalous to read the Act to require the EPA to regulate\nair pollutants that pose previously unforeseen threats to\nhuman health and welfare where “250 tons per year” is a\nsensible regulatory line but not where, by chemical or\nregulatory happenstance, a higher line must be drawn.\nAnd it is anomalous to read an unwritten exception into\nthe more important phrase of the statutory definition\n(“any air pollutant”) when a similar unwritten exception to\nless important language (the particular number used by\nthe statute) will do just as well. The implicit exception\npreferred by the Court produces all of these anomalies,\nwhile the source-related exception I propose creates none\nof them.\n   In addition, the interpretation I propose leaves the EPA\nwith the sort of discretion as to interstitial matters that\nCongress likely intended it to retain. My interpretation\ngives the EPA nothing more than the authority to exempt\nsources from regulation insofar as the Agency reasonably\ndetermines that applying the PSD program to them would\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nexpand the program so much as to contravene Congress’s\nintent. That sort of decision, which involves the Agency’s\ntechnical expertise and administrative experience, is the\nkind of decision that Congress typically leaves to the\nagencies to make. Cf. Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212,\n222 (2002) (enumerating factors that we take to indicate\nthat Congress intends the agency to exercise the discre-\ntion provided by Chevron). To read the Act to grant that\ndiscretion here is to read it as furthering Congress’s (and\nthe public’s) interest in more effective, less wasteful\nregulation.\n   Last, but by no means least, a source-related exception\nadvances the Act’s overall purpose. That broad purpose,\nas set forth at the beginning of the statute, is “to protect\nand enhance the quality of the Nation’s air resources so as\nto promote the public health and welfare and the produc-\ntive capacity of its population.” §7401(b)(1); see also\n§7470(1) (A purpose of the PSD program in particular\nis “to protect public health and welfare from any actual\nor potential adverse effect which in the Administra-\ntor’s judgment may reasonably be anticipate[d] to occur\nfrom air pollution”); §7602(h) (“All language [in the Act]\nreferring to effects on welfare includes . . . effects on . . .\nweather . . . and climate”). The expert agency charged\nwith administering the Act has determined in its En-\ndangerment Finding that greenhouse gases endanger\nhuman health and welfare, and so sensible regulation of\nindustrial emissions of those pollutants is at the core of\nthe purpose behind the Act. The broad “no greenhouse\ngases” exception that the Court reads into the statute\nunnecessarily undercuts that purpose, while my narrow\nsource-related exception would leave the Agency with the\ntools it needs to further it.\n                      *     *     *\n  I agree with the Court’s holding that stationary sources\n12        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat are subject to the PSD program because they emit\nother (non-greenhouse-gas) pollutants in quantities above\nthe statutory threshold—those facilities that the Court\nrefers to as “anyway” sources—must meet the “best avail-\nable control technology” requirement of §7475(a)(4) with\nrespect to greenhouse gas emissions. I therefore join Part\nII–B–2 of the Court’s opinion. But as for the Court’s hold-\ning that the EPA cannot interpret the language at issue\nhere to cover facilities that emit more than 100,000 tpy of\ngreenhouse gases by virtue of those emissions, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), this\nCourt considered whether greenhouse gases fall within the\nClean Air Act’s general definition of an air “pollutant.”\nId., at 528–529. The Environmental Protection Agency\ncautioned us that “key provisions of the [Act] cannot co-\ngently be applied to [greenhouse gas] emissions,” Brief for\nFederal Respondent in Massachusetts v. EPA, O. T. 2006,\nNo. 05–1120, p. 22, but the Court brushed the warning\naside and had “little trouble” concluding that the Act’s\n“sweeping definition” of a pollutant encompasses green-\nhouse gases. 549 U. S., at 528–529. I believed Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA was wrongly decided at the time, and these\ncases further expose the flaws with that decision.\n                              I\n  As the present cases now show, trying to fit greenhouse\ngases into “key provisions” of the Clean Air Act involves\nmore than a “little trouble.” These cases concern the\nprovisions of the Act relating to the “Prevention of Signifi-\ncant Deterioration” (PSD), 42 U. S. C. §§7470–7492, as\nwell as Title V of the Act, §7661. And in order to make\nthose provisions apply to greenhouse gases in a way that\ndoes not produce absurd results, the EPA effectively\namended the Act. The Act contains specific emissions\nthresholds that trigger PSD and Title V coverage, but the\nEPA crossed out the figures enacted by Congress and\nsubstituted figures of its own.\n  I agree with the Court that the EPA is neither required\nnor permitted to take this extraordinary step, and I there-\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Neither is\nconvincing.\n                              A\n   With respect to the text, it is curious that the Court,\nhaving departed from a literal interpretation of the term\n“pollutant” in Part II–A, turns on its heels and adopts a\nliteral interpretation in Part II–B. The coverage thresh-\nolds at issue in Part II–A apply to any “pollutant.” The\nAct’s general definition of this term is broad, and in Mas-\nsachusetts v. EPA, supra, the Court held that this defini-\ntion covers greenhouse gases. The Court does not disturb\nthat holding, but it nevertheless concludes that, as used in\nthe provision triggering PSD coverage, the term “pollu-\ntant” actually means “pollutant, other than a greenhouse\ngas.”\n   In Part II–B, the relevant statutory provision says\nthat BACT must be installed for any “pollutant subject\nto regulation under [the Act].” §7475(a)(4). If the term\n“pollutant” means “pollutant, other than a greenhouse\ngas,” as the Court effectively concludes in Part II–A, the\nterm “pollutant subject to regulation under [the Act]” in\n§7475(a)(4) should mean “pollutant, other than a green-\n4         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nhouse gas, subject to regulation under [the Act], and that\nis subject to regulation under [the Act].” The Court’s\nliteralism is selective, and it results in a strange and\ndisjointed regulatory scheme.\n   Under the Court’s interpretation, a source can emit an\nunlimited quantity of greenhouse gases without triggering\nthe need for a PSD permit. Why might Congress have\nwanted to allow this? The most likely explanation is that\nthe PSD permitting process is simply not suited for use in\nregulating this particular pollutant. And if that is so, it\nmakes little sense to require the installation of BACT for\ngreenhouse gases in those instances in which a source\nhappens to be required to obtain a permit due to the emis-\nsion of a qualifying quantity of some other pollutant that\nis regulated under the Act.\n                             B\n  The Court’s second reason for holding that BACT ap-\nplies to “anyway” sources is its belief that this can be done\nwithout disastrous consequences. Only time will tell\nwhether this hope is well founded, but it seems clear that\nBACT analysis is fundamentally incompatible with the\nregulation of greenhouse-gas emissions for at least two\nimportant reasons.\n                             1\n  First, BACT looks to the effects of covered pollutants in\nthe area in which a source is located. The PSD program is\nimplemented through “emission limitations and such\nother measures” as are “necessary . . . to prevent signifi-\ncant deterioration of air quality in each region.” §7471\n(emphasis added). The Clean Air Act provides that BACT\nmust be identified “on a case-by-case basis,” §7479(3), and\nthis necessarily means that local conditions must be taken\ninto account. For this reason, the Act instructs the EPA to\nissue regulations requiring an analysis of “the ambient air\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nquality . . . at the site of the proposed major emitting facil-\nity and in the area potentially affected by the emissions\nfrom such facility for each pollutant regulated under [the\nAct].” §7475(e)(3)(B) (emphasis added). The Act also\nrequires a public hearing on “the air quality at the pro-\nposed site and in areas which may be affected by emissions\nfrom such facility for each pollutant subject to regulation\nunder [the Act] which will be emitted from such facility.”\n§§7475(a)(2), (e)(1) (emphasis added). Accordingly, if\nBACT is required for greenhouse gases, the Act demands\nthat the impact of these gases in the area surrounding a\nsite must be monitored, explored at a public hearing, and\nconsidered as part of the permitting process. The effects of\ngreenhouse gases, however, are global, not local. See PSD\nand Title V Permitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases\n41–42 (Mar. 2011) (hereinafter Guidance). As a result, the\nEPA has declared that PSD permit applicants and permit-\nting officials may disregard these provisions of the Act. 75\nFed. Reg. 31520 (2010).\n                             2\n  Second, as part of the case-by-case analysis required by\nBACT, a permitting authority must balance the environ-\nmental benefit expected to result from the installation of\nan available control measure against adverse consequences\nthat may result, including any negative impact on the\nenvironment, energy conservation, and the economy. And\nthe EPA itself has admitted that this cannot be done on a\ncase-by-case basis with respect to greenhouse gases.\n  The Clean Air Act makes it clear that BACT must be\ndetermined on a “case-by-case basis, taking into account\nenergy, environmental, and economic impacts and other\ncosts.” §7479(3). To implement this directive, the EPA\nadopted a five-step framework for making a BACT deter-\nmination. See New Source Review Workshop Manual:\nPrevention of Significant Deterioration and Nonattain-\n6            UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nment Area Permitting (Oct. 1990).1 Under the fourth step\nof this analysis, potentially applicable and feasible control\ntechnologies that are candidates for selection as BACT for\na particular source are eliminated from consideration\nbased on their “collateral impacts,” such as any adverse\nenvironmental effects or adverse effects on energy con-\nsumption or the economy.\n   More recently, the EPA provided guidance to permitting\nauthorities regarding the treatment of greenhouse-gas\nemissions under this framework, and the EPA’s guidance\ndemonstrates the insuperable problem that results when\nan attempt is made to apply this framework to greenhouse\ngas emissions. As noted above, at step 4 of the framework,\na permitting authority must balance the positive effect\nlikely to result from requiring a particular source to install\na particular technology against a variety of negative ef-\nfects that are likely to occur if that step is taken. But\nin the case of greenhouse gases, how can a permit-\nting authority make this individualized, source-specific\ndetermination?\n   The EPA instructs permitting authorities to take into\n——————\n    1 The\n        EPA describes these steps as follows:\n  (1) The applicant must identify all available control options that are\npotentially applicable by consulting EPA’s BACT clearinghouse along\nwith other reliable sources.\n  (2) The technical feasibility of the control options identified in step 1\nare eliminated based on technical infeasibility.\n  (3) The control technologies are ranked based on control effective-\nness, by considering: the percentage of the pollutant removed; expected\nemission rate for each new source review (NSR) pollutant; expected\nemission reduction for each regulated NSR pollutant; and output based\nemissions limit.\n  (4) Control technologies are eliminated based on collateral impacts,\nsuch as: energy impacts; other environmental impacts; solid or hazard-\nous waste; water discharge from control device; emissions of air toxics\nand other non-NSR regulated pollutants; and economic impacts.\n  (5) The most effective control option not eliminated in step 4 is\nproposed as BACT for the pollutant and emission unit under review.\n                   Cite as: 573 U.

These include an increased risk\nof dangerous heat waves, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and\ndrought, as well as risks to agriculture, forestry, and\nwater resources. Guidance 40–41. But the EPA admits\nthat it is simply not possible for a permitting authority to\ncalculate in any meaningful way the degree to which any\npotential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from any\nindividual source might reduce these risks. And without\nmaking such a calculation in even a very rough way, a\npermitting authority cannot do what the Clean Air Act\nand the EPA’s framework demand—compare the benefits\nof some specified reduction in the emission of greenhouse\ngases from a particular source with any adverse environ-\nmental or economic effects that might result from mandat-\ning such a reduction.\n   Suppose, for example, that a permitting authority must\ndecide whether to mandate a change that both decreases a\nsource’s emission of greenhouse gases and increases its\nemission of a conventional pollutant that has a negative\neffect on public health. How should a permitting authority\ndecide whether to require this change? Here is the EPA’s\nadvice:\n    “[W]hen considering the trade-offs between the envi-\n    ronmental impacts of a particular level of GHG\n    [greenhouse gas] reduction and a collateral increase in\n    another regulated NSR pollutant,[2] rather than at-\n    tempting to determine or characterize specific envi-\n    ronmental impacts from GHGs emitted at particular\n    locations, EPA recommends that permitting authori-\n    ties focus on the amount of GHG emission reductions\n——————\n  2 “New source review pollutants” are those pollutants for which a\n\nNational Ambient Air Quality standard has been set and a few others,\nsuch as sulphur dioxide. See 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxvii) (2013).\n8             UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n       that may be gained or lost by employing a particular\n       control strategy and how that compares to the envi-\n       ronmental or other impacts resulting from the collat-\n       eral emissions increase of other regulated NSR pollu-\n       tants.” Guidance 42.\n   As best I can make out, what this means is that permit-\nting authorities should not even try to assess the net\nimpact on public health. Instead of comparing the positive\nand negative public health effects of a particular option,\npermitting authorities are instructed to compare the\nadverse public health effects of increasing the emissions of\nthe conventional pollutants with the amount of the reduc-\ntion of the source’s emissions of greenhouse gases. But\nwithout knowing the positive effects of the latter, this is a\nmeaningless comparison.\n   The EPA tries to ameliorate this problem by noting that\npermitting authorities are entitled to “a great deal of\ndiscretion,” Guidance 41, but without a comprehensible\nstandard, what this will mean is arbitrary and incon-\nsistent decisionmaking. That is not what the Clean Air\nAct contemplates.3\n                       *     *    *\n   BACT analysis, like the rest of the Clean Air Act, was\ndeveloped for use in regulating the emission of conven-\ntional pollutants and is simply not suited for use with\nrespect to greenhouse gases.

Argued February 24, 2014—Decided June 23, 2014 *\nThe Clean Air Act imposes permitting requirements on stationary\n  sources, such as factories and powerplants. The Act’s “Prevention of\n  Significant Deterioration” (PSD) provisions make it unlawful to con-\n  struct or modify a “major emitting facility” in “any area to which [the\n  PSD program] applies” without a permit. §§7475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C). A\n  “major emitting facility” is a stationary source with the potential to\n  emit 250 tons per year of “any air pollutant” (or 100 tons per year for\n  certain types of sources). §7479(1). Facilities seeking to qualify for a\n  PSD permit must, inter alia, comply with emissions limitations that\n  reflect the “best available control technology” (BACT) for “each pollu-\n  tant subject to regulation under” the Act. §7475(a)(4). In addition,\n  Title V of the Act makes it unlawful to operate any “major source,”\n  wherever located, without a permit. §7661a(a). A “major source” is a\n  stationary source with the potential to emit 100 tons per year of “any\n  air pollutant.” §§7661(2)(B), 7602(j).\n     In response to Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.

It recognized,\n    however, that requiring permits for all sources with greenhouse-gas\n    emissions above the statutory thresholds would radically expand\n    those programs and render them unadministrable. So EPA purport-\n    ed to “tailor” the programs to accommodate greenhouse gases by\n    providing, among other things, that sources would not become newly\n    subject to PSD or Title V permitting on the basis of their potential to\n    emit greenhouse gases in amounts less than 100,000 tons per year.\n       Numerous parties, including several States, challenged EPA’s ac-\n    tions in the D. C. Circuit, which dismissed some of the petitions for\n    lack of jurisdiction and denied the remainder.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n684 F. 3d 102, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I and II, concluding:\n    1. The Act neither compels nor permits EPA to adopt an interpre-\n  tation of the Act requiring a source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit\n  on the sole basis of its potential greenhouse-gas emissions. Pp. 10–\n  24.\n       (a) The Act does not compel EPA’s interpretation. Massachusetts\n  held that the Act-wide definition of “air pollutant” includes green-\n  house gases, 549 U. S., at 529, but where the term “air pollutant” ap-\n  pears in the Act’s operative provisions, including the PSD and Title V\n  permitting provisions, EPA has routinely given it a narrower, con-\n  text-appropriate meaning. Massachusetts did not invalidate those\n  longstanding constructions. The Act-wide definition is not a com-\n  mand to regulate, but a description of the universe of substances EPA\n  may consider regulating under the Act’s operative provisions.\n  Though Congress’s profligate use of “air pollutant” is not conducive to\n  clarity, the presumption of consistent usage “ ‘readily yields’ ” to con-\n  text, and a statutory term “may take on distinct characters from as-\n  sociation with distinct statutory objects calling for different imple-\n  mentation strategies.” Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp.,\n  549 U. S. 561, 574. Pp. 10–16.\n       (b) Nor does the Act permit EPA’s interpretation. Agencies em-\n  powered to resolve statutory ambiguities must operate “within the\n  bounds of reasonable interpretation,” Arlington v. FCC, 569 U. S. ___,\n  ___. EPA has repeatedly acknowledged that applying the PSD and\n  Title V permitting requirements to greenhouse gases would be incon-\n  sistent with the Act’s structure and design. A review of the relevant\n  statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD program and Title\n  V are designed to apply to, and cannot rationally be extended beyond,\n  a relative handful of large sources capable of shouldering heavy sub-\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

EPA’s interpretation would also\n  bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in EPA’s\n  regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization. FDA\n  v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 160. Pp. 16–20.\n        (c) EPA lacked authority to “tailor” the Act’s unambiguous nu-\n  merical thresholds of 100 or 250 tons per year to accommodate its\n  greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the permitting triggers.\n  Agencies must always “ ‘give effect to the unambiguously expressed\n  intent of Congress.’ ” National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders\n  of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 665. The power to execute the laws does\n  not include a power to revise clear statutory terms that turn out not\n  to work in practice. Pp. 20–24.\n     2. EPA reasonably interpreted the Act to require sources that\n  would need permits based on their emission of conventional pollu-\n  tants to comply with BACT for greenhouse gases. Pp. 24–29.\n        (a) Concerns that BACT, which has traditionally been about end-\n  of-stack controls, is fundamentally unsuited to greenhouse-gas regu-\n  lation, which is more about energy use, are not unfounded. But an\n  EPA guidance document states that BACT analysis should consider\n  options other than energy efficiency, including “carbon capture and\n  storage,” which EPA contends is reasonably comparable to more tra-\n  ditional, end-of-stack BACT technologies. Moreover, assuming that\n  BACT may be used to force improvements in energy efficiency, im-\n  portant limitations on BACT may work to mitigate concerns about\n  “unbounded” regulatory authority. Pp. 24–27.\n        (b) EPA’s decision to require BACT for greenhouse gases emitted\n  by sources otherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a\n  permissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron U. S. A. Inc.\n  v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. The specif-\n  ic phrasing of the BACT provision—which requires BACT “for each\n  pollutant subject to regulation under” the Act, §7475(a)(4)—does not\n  suggest that the provision can bear a narrowing construction. And\n  even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to greenhouse gases is\n  not so disastrously unworkable, and need not result in such a dra-\n  matic expansion of agency authority, as to make EPA’s interpretation\n  unreasonable.

S. C. §§7401–7671q, the Environmental\nProtection Agency recently set standards for emissions of\n“greenhouse gases” (substances it believes contribute to\n“global climate change”) from new motor vehicles. We\nmust decide whether it was permissible for EPA to deter-\nmine that its motor-vehicle greenhouse-gas regulations\nautomatically triggered permitting requirements under\nthe Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases.\n                       I. Background\n              A. Stationary-Source Permitting\n   The Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating emis-\nsions from both stationary sources, such as factories and\npowerplants, and moving sources, such as cars, trucks,\nand aircraft. This litigation concerns permitting obliga-\ntions imposed on stationary sources under Titles I and V\nof the Act.\n   Title I charges EPA with formulating national ambient\nair quality standards (NAAQS) for air pollutants. §§7408–\n7409. To date, EPA has issued NAAQS for six pollutants:\nsulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon\nmonoxide, ozone, and lead. Clean Air Act Handbook 125\n(J. Domike & A. Zacaroli eds., 3d ed. 2011); see generally\n40 CFR pt. 50 (2013). States have primary responsibility\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor implementing the NAAQS by developing “State imple-\nmentation plans.” 42 U. S. C. §7410. A State must desig-\nnate every area within its borders as “attainment,” “non-\nattainment,” or “unclassifiable” with respect to each\nNAAQS, §7407(d), and the State’s implementation plan\nmust include permitting programs for stationary sources\nthat vary according to the classification of the area where\nthe source is or is proposed to be located. §7410(a)(2)(C),\n(I).\n   Stationary sources in areas designated attainment or\nunclassifiable are subject to the Act’s provisions relating to\n“Prevention of Significant Deterioration” (PSD). §§7470–\n7492. EPA interprets the PSD provisions to apply to\nsources located in areas that are designated attainment or\nunclassifiable for any NAAQS pollutant, regardless of\nwhether the source emits that specific pollutant. Since the\ninception of the PSD program, every area of the country\nhas been designated attainment or unclassifiable for at\nleast one NAAQS pollutant; thus, on EPA’s view, all sta-\ntionary sources are potentially subject to PSD review.\n   It is unlawful to construct or modify a “major emitting\nfacility” in “any area to which [the PSD program] applies”\nwithout first obtaining a permit. §§7475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C).\nTo qualify for a permit, the facility must not cause or\ncontribute to the violation of any applicable air-quality\nstandard, §7475(a)(3), and it must comply with emissions\nlimitations that reflect the “best available control technol-\nogy” (or BACT) for “each pollutant subject to regulation\nunder” the Act. §7475(a)(4). The Act defines a “major\nemitting facility” as any stationary source with the poten-\ntial to emit 250 tons per year of “any air pollutant” (or 100\ntons per year for certain types of sources). §7479(1). It\ndefines “modification” as a physical or operational change\nthat causes the facility to emit more of “any air pollutant.”\n4                UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n§7411(a)(4).1\n  In addition to the PSD permitting requirements for\nconstruction and modification, Title V of the Act makes it\nunlawful to operate any “major source,” wherever located,\nwithout a comprehensive operating permit. §7661a(a).\nUnlike the PSD program, Title V generally does not im-\npose any substantive pollution-control requirements.\nInstead, it is designed to facilitate compliance and en-\nforcement by consolidating into a single document all of a\nfacility’s obligations under the Act. The permit must\ninclude all “emissions limitations and standards” that\napply to the source, as well as associated inspection, moni-\ntoring, and reporting requirements. §7661c(a)–(c). Title V\ndefines a “major source” by reference to the Act-wide\ndefinition of “major stationary source,” which in turn\nmeans any stationary source with the potential to emit\n100 tons per year of “any air pollutant.” §§7661(2)(B),\n7602( j).\n          B. EPA’s Greenhouse-Gas Regulations\n  In 2007, the Court held that Title II of the Act “author-\nize[d] EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new\nmotor vehicles” if the Agency “form[ed] a ‘judgment’ that\n——————\n    1 Although the statute sets numerical thresholds (100 or 250 tons per\nyear) for emissions that will make a facility “major,” it does not specify\nby how much a physical or operational change must increase emissions\nto constitute a permit-requiring “modification.” Nor does it say how\nmuch of a given regulated pollutant a “major emitting facility” must\nemit before it is subject to BACT for that pollutant. EPA, however, has\nestablished pollutant-specific numerical thresholds below which a\nfacility’s emissions of a pollutant, and increases therein, are considered\nde minimis for those purposes. See 40 CFR §§51.166(b)(2)(i), (23), (39),\n(j)(2)–(3), 52.21(b)(2)(i), (23), (40), (j)(2)–(3); see also Alabama Power Co.\nv.

In\nresponse to that decision, EPA embarked on a course of\nregulation resulting in “the single largest expansion in the\nscope of the [Act] in its history.” Clean Air Act Handbook,\nat xxi.\n   EPA first asked the public, in a notice of proposed rule-\nmaking, to comment on how the Agency should respond to\nMassachusetts. In doing so, it explained that regulating\ngreenhouse-gas emissions from motor vehicles could have\nfar-reaching consequences for stationary sources. Under\nEPA’s view, once greenhouse gases became regulated\nunder any part of the Act, the PSD and Title V permitting\nrequirements would apply to all stationary sources with\nthe potential to emit greenhouse gases in excess of the\nstatutory thresholds: 100 tons per year under Title V, and\n100 or 250 tons per year under the PSD program depend-\ning on the type of source. 73 Fed. Reg. 44420, 44498,\n44511 (2008). Because greenhouse-gas emissions tend to\nbe “orders of magnitude greater” than emissions of con-\nventional pollutants, EPA projected that numerous small\nsources not previously regulated under the Act would be\nswept into the PSD program and Title V, including “smaller\nindustrial sources,” “large office and residential build-\nings, hotels, large retail establishments, and similar facili-\nties.” Id., at 44498–44499. The Agency warned that this\nwould constitute an “unprecedented expansion of EPA\nauthority that would have a profound effect on virtually\nevery sector of the economy and touch every household in\nthe land,” yet still be “relatively ineffective at reducing\ngreenhouse gas concentrations.” Id., at 44355.2\n——————\n  2 Comments from other Executive Branch agencies reprinted in the\n\nnotice echoed those concerns. See, e.g., 73 Fed.

Reg. 25324 (hereinafter\nTailpipe Rule).\n   EPA then announced steps it was taking to “tailor” the\nPSD program and Title V to greenhouse gases. 75 Fed.\nReg. 31514 (hereinafter Tailoring Rule). Those steps were\nnecessary, it said, because the PSD program and Title V\nwere designed to regulate “a relatively small number of\nlarge industrial sources,” and requiring permits for all\nsources with greenhouse-gas emissions above the statu-\ntory thresholds would radically expand those programs,\nmaking them both unadministrable and “unrecognizable\nto the Congress that designed” them. Id., at 31555, 31562.\nEPA nonetheless rejected calls to exclude greenhouse\ngases entirely from those programs, asserting that the Act\nis not “ambiguous with respect to the need to cover\n[greenhouse-gas] sources under either the PSD or title V\nprogram.” Id., at 31548, n. 31. Instead, EPA adopted a\n“phase-in approach” that it said would “appl[y] PSD and\ntitle V at threshold levels that are as close to the statutory\nlevels as possible, and do so as quickly as possible, at least\nto a certain point.” Id., at 31523.\n   The phase-in, EPA said, would consist of at least three\nsteps. During Step 1, from January 2 through June 30,\n2011, no source would become newly subject to the PSD\nprogram or Title V solely on the basis of its greenhouse-\ngas emissions; however, sources required to obtain permits\nanyway because of their emission of conventional pollu-\ntants (so-called “anyway” sources) would need to comply\nwith BACT for greenhouse gases if they emitted those\ngases in significant amounts, defined as at least 75,000\ntons per year CO2e. Ibid. During Step 2, from July 1,\n2011, through June 30, 2012, sources with the potential to\nemit at least 100,000 tons per year CO2e of greenhouse\ngases would be subject to PSD and Title V permitting for\ntheir construction and operation and to PSD permitting\n8           UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

Id., at 31524. Beyond Step 3, EPA\npromised to complete another round of rulemaking by\nApril 30, 2016, in which it would “take further action to\naddress small sources,” which might (or might not) include\nestablishing permanent exemptions. Id., at 31525.\n   EPA codified Steps 1 and 2 at 40 CFR §§51.166(b)(48)\nand 52.21(b)(49) for PSD and at §§70.2 and 71.2 for Title\nV, and it codified its commitments regarding Step 3 and\nbeyond at §§52.22, 70.12, and 71.13.

First, we must decide whether EPA permissibly\ndetermined that a source may be subject to the PSD and\nTitle V permitting requirements on the sole basis of the\nsource’s potential to emit greenhouse gases. Second, we\nmust decide whether EPA permissibly determined that a\nsource already subject to the PSD program because of its\nemission of conventional pollutants (an “anyway” source)\nmay be required to limit its greenhouse-gas emissions by\nemploying the “best available control technology” for\ngreenhouse gases. The Solicitor General joins issue on\nboth points but evidently regards the second as more\nimportant; he informs us that “anyway” sources account\n10          UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v.

S. 837,\n842–843 (1984). Under Chevron, we presume that when\nan agency-administered statute is ambiguous with respect\nto what it prescribes, Congress has empowered the agency\nto resolve the ambiguity. The question for a reviewing\ncourt is whether in doing so the agency has acted reasona-\nbly and thus has “stayed within the bounds of its statutory\nauthority.” Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.

The PSD and Title V Triggers\n  We first decide whether EPA permissibly interpreted\nthe statute to provide that a source may be required to\nobtain a PSD or Title V permit on the sole basis of its\npotential greenhouse-gas emissions.\n                            1\n   EPA thought its conclusion that a source’s greenhouse-\ngas emissions may necessitate a PSD or Title V permit\nfollowed from the Act’s unambiguous language. The Court\nof Appeals agreed and held that the statute “compelled”\nEPA’s interpretation. 684 F. 3d, at 134.

S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals reasoned by way of a flawed syllo-\ngism: Under Massachusetts, the general, Act-wide defini-\ntion of “air pollutant” includes greenhouse gases; the Act\nrequires permits for major emitters of “any air pollutant”;\ntherefore, the Act requires permits for major emitters of\ngreenhouse gases. The conclusion follows from the prem-\nises only if the air pollutants referred to in the permit-\nrequiring provisions (the minor premise) are the same air\npollutants encompassed by the Act-wide definition as\ninterpreted in Massachusetts (the major premise). Yet no\none—least of all EPA—endorses that proposition, and it is\nobviously untenable.\n   The Act-wide definition says that an air pollutant is\n“any air pollution agent or combination of such agents,\nincluding any physical, chemical, biological, [or] radioac-\ntive . . . substance or matter which is emitted into or oth-\nerwise enters the ambient air.” §7602(g). In Massachu­\nsetts, the Court held that the Act-wide definition includes\ngreenhouse gases because it is all-encompassing; it “em-\nbraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe.” 549\nU. S., at 529. But where the term “air pollutant” appears\nin the Act’s operative provisions, EPA has routinely given\nit a narrower, context-appropriate meaning.\n   That is certainly true of the provisions that require PSD\nand Title V permitting for major emitters of “any air pollu-\ntant.” Since 1978, EPA’s regulations have interpreted “air\npollutant” in the PSD permitting trigger as limited to\nregulated air pollutants, 43 Fed. Reg. 26403, codified, as\namended, 40 CFR §52.21(b)(1)–(2), (50)—a class much\nnarrower than Massachusetts’ “all airborne compounds of\n—————— \n\nments petitioners have made before this Court apply to Title V as well\n\nas the PSD program. See Brief for Federal Respondents 56. We agree,\n\nand we are satisfied that those arguments were also made below. See,\n\ne.g., Brief for State Petitioners et al. in No. 10–1073 etc. (CADC), pp.\n\n59–73; Brief for Non-State Petitioners et al. in No. 10–1073 etc.\n\n(CADC), pp. 46–47. \n\n12         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhatever stripe,” 549 U. S., at 529. And since 1993 EPA\nhas informally taken the same position with regard to the\nTitle V permitting trigger, a position the Agency ultimately\nincorporated into some of the regulations at issue here.\nSee Memorandum from Lydia N. Wegman, Deputy Direc-\ntor, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to Air\nDivision Director, Regions I–X, pp. 4–5 (Apr. 26, 1993);\nTailoring Rule 31607–31608 (amending 40 CFR §§70.2,\n71.2). Those interpretations were appropriate: It is plain\nas day that the Act does not envision an elaborate, bur-\ndensome permitting process for major emitters of steam,\noxygen, or other harmless airborne substances. It takes\nsome cheek for EPA to insist that it cannot possibly give\n“air pollutant” a reasonable, context-appropriate meaning\nin the PSD and Title V contexts when it has been doing\nprecisely that for decades.\n  Nor are those the only places in the Act where EPA has\ninferred from statutory context that a generic reference to\nair pollutants does not encompass every substance falling\nwithin the Act-wide definition. Other examples abound:\n\n     \t The Act authorizes EPA to enforce new source per-\n        formance standards (NSPS) against a pre-existing\n        source if, after promulgation of the standards, the\n        source undergoes a physical or operational change\n        that increases its emission of “any air pollutant.”\n        §7411(a)(2), (4), (b)(1)(B). EPA interprets that pro-\n        vision as limited to air pollutants for which EPA\n        has promulgated new source performance stand­\n        ards. 36 Fed. Reg. 24877 (1971), codified, as\n        amended, 40 CFR §60.2; 40 Fed. Reg. 58419 (1975),\n        codified, as amended, 40 CFR §60.14(a).\n\n     \t The Act requires a permit for the construction or\n        operation in a nonattainment area of a source with\n        the potential to emit 100 tons per year of “any air\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

EPA interprets\n      that provision as limited to pollutants for which the\n      area is designated nonattainment. 45 Fed. Reg.\n      52745 (1980), promulgating 40 CFR §51.18(j)(2), as\n      amended, §51.165(a)(2).\n\n   \t The Act directs EPA to require “enhanced monitor-\n      ing and submission of compliance certifications” for\n      any source with the potential to emit 100 tons per\n      year of “any air pollutant.” §§7414(a)(3), 7602(j).\n      EPA interprets that provision as limited to regulated\n      pollutants. 62 Fed. Reg. 54941 (1997), codified\n      at 40 CFR §§64.1, 64.2.\n\n   \t The Act requires certain sources of air pollutants\n      that interfere with visibility to undergo retrofitting\n      if they have the potential to emit 250 tons per year\n      of “any pollutant.” §7491(b)(2)(A), (g)(7). EPA in-\n      terprets that provision as limited to visibility­\n      impairing air pollutants. 70 Fed. Reg. 39160\n      (2005), codified at 40 CFR pt. 51, App. Y, §II.A.3.\n\nAlthough these limitations are nowhere to be found in the\nAct-wide definition, in each instance EPA has concluded—\nas it has in the PSD and Title V context—that the statute\nis not using “air pollutant” in Massachusetts’ broad sense\nto mean any airborne substance whatsoever.\n   Massachusetts did not invalidate all these longstanding\nconstructions. That case did not hold that EPA must\nalways regulate greenhouse gases as an “air pollutant”\neverywhere that term appears in the statute, but only that\nEPA must “ground its reasons for action or inaction in the\nstatute,” 549 U. S., at 535 (emphasis added), rather than\non “reasoning divorced from the statutory text,” id., at\n532. EPA’s inaction with regard to Title II was not suffi-\nciently grounded in the statute, the Court said, in part\n14          UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause nothing in the Act suggested that regulating\ngreenhouse gases under that Title would conflict with the\nstatutory design. Title II would not compel EPA to regu-\nlate in any way that would be “extreme,” “counterintui-\ntive,” or contrary to “ ‘common sense.’ ” Id., at 531. At\nmost, it would require EPA to take the modest step of\nadding greenhouse-gas standards to the roster of new-\nmotor-vehicle emission regulations. Ibid.\n   Massachusetts does not strip EPA of authority to ex-\nclude greenhouse gases from the class of regulable air\npollutants under other parts of the Act where their inclu-\nsion would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme. The\nAct-wide definition to which the Court gave a “sweeping”\nand “capacious” interpretation, id., at 528, 532, is not a\ncommand to regulate, but a description of the universe of\nsubstances EPA may consider regulating under the Act’s\noperative provisions. Massachusetts does not foreclose the\nAgency’s use of statutory context to infer that certain of\nthe Act’s provisions use “air pollutant” to denote not every\nconceivable airborne substance, but only those that may\nsensibly be encompassed within the particular regulatory\nprogram. As certain amici felicitously put it, while Mas­\nsachusetts “rejected EPA’s categorical contention that\ngreenhouse gases could not be ‘air pollutants’ for any\npurposes of the Act,” it did not “embrace EPA’s current,\nequally categorical position that greenhouse gases must be\nair pollutants for all purposes” regardless of the statutory\ncontext.

One ordinarily\nassumes “ ‘that identical words used in different parts of\nthe same act are intended to have the same meaning.’ ”\nEnvironmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp., 549 U. S.\n561, 574 (2007). In this respect (as in countless others),\nthe Act is far from a chef d’oeuvre of legislative draftsman-\nship. But we, and EPA, must do our best, bearing in mind\nthe “ ‘fundamental canon of statutory construction that the\nwords of a statute must be read in their context and with a\nview to their place in the overall statutory scheme.’ ” FDA\nv. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133\n(2000). As we reiterated the same day we decided Massa­\nchusetts, the presumption of consistent usage “ ‘readily\nyields’ ” to context, and a statutory term—even one defined\nin the statute—“may take on distinct characters from\nassociation with distinct statutory objects calling for dif-\nferent implementation strategies.” Duke Energy, supra, at\n574.\n   We need not, and do not, pass on the validity of all the\nlimiting constructions EPA has given the term “air pollu-\ntant” throughout the Act. We merely observe that taken\ntogether, they belie EPA’s rigid insistence that when\ninterpreting the PSD and Title V permitting requirements\nit is bound by the Act-wide definition’s inclusion of green-\nhouse gases, no matter how incompatible that inclusion is\nwith those programs’ regulatory structure.\n   In sum, there is no insuperable textual barrier to EPA’s\ninterpreting “any air pollutant” in the permitting triggers\nof PSD and Title V to encompass only pollutants emitted\nin quantities that enable them to be sensibly regulated at\nthe statutory thresholds, and to exclude those atypical\n—————— \n\nnot at issue here and one that no party in American Electric Power\n\nargued was ill suited to accommodating greenhouse gases. \n\n16           UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npollutants that, like greenhouse gases, are emitted in such\nvast quantities that their inclusion would radically trans-\nform those programs and render them unworkable as\nwritten.6\n                              2\n   Having determined that EPA was mistaken in thinking\nthe Act compelled a greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpreta-\ntion of the PSD and Title V triggers, we next consider the\nAgency’s alternative position that its interpretation was\njustified as an exercise of its “discretion” to adopt “a rea-\nsonable construction of the statute.” Tailoring Rule 31517.\nWe conclude that EPA’s interpretation is not permissible.\n   Even under Chevron’s deferential framework, agencies\nmust operate “within the bounds of reasonable interpreta-\ntion.” Arlington, 569 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). And\nreasonable statutory interpretation must account for both\n“the specific context in which . . . language is used” and\n“the broader context of the statute as a whole.” Robinson\nv. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997). A statutory\n——————\n  6 During  the course of this litigation, several possible limiting con-\nstructions for the PSD trigger have been proposed. Judge Kavanaugh\nargued below that it would be plausible for EPA to read “any air pollu-\ntant” in the PSD context as limited to the six NAAQS pollutants. See\nCoalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc. v. EPA, No. 09–1322 etc.\n(CADC, Dec. 20, 2012), App. 171–180, 2012 WL 6621785, *15–*18\n(opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Some petitioners\nmake a slightly different argument: that because PSD permitting is\nrequired only for major emitting facilities “in any area to which [the\nPSD program] applies,” §7475(a), the relevant pollutants are only those\nNAAQS pollutants for which the area in question is designated attain-\nment or unclassifiable. That approach would bring EPA’s interpreta-\ntion of the PSD trigger in line with its longstanding interpretation of\nthe permitting requirements for nonattainment areas. Others main-\ntain that “any air pollutant” in the PSD provision should be limited to\nair pollutants with localized effects on air quality. We do not foreclose\nEPA or the courts from considering those constructions in the future,\nbut we need not do so today.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often\nclarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme . . .\nbecause only one of the permissible meanings produces a\nsubstantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the\nlaw.” United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood\nForest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988). Thus,\nan agency interpretation that is “inconsisten[t] with the\ndesign and structure of the statute as a whole,” University\nof Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 13), does not merit deference.\n   EPA itself has repeatedly acknowledged that applying\nthe PSD and Title V permitting requirements to green-\nhouse gases would be inconsistent with—in fact, would\noverthrow—the Act’s structure and design. In the Tailor-\ning Rule, EPA described the calamitous consequences of\ninterpreting the Act in that way. Under the PSD program,\nannual permit applications would jump from about 800 to\nnearly 82,000; annual administrative costs would swell\nfrom $12 million to over $1.5 billion; and decade-long\ndelays in issuing permits would become common, causing\nconstruction projects to grind to a halt nationwide. Tailor-\ning Rule 31557. The picture under Title V was equally\nbleak: The number of sources required to have permits\nwould jump from fewer than 15,000 to about 6.1 million;\nannual administrative costs would balloon from $62 mil-\nlion to $21 billion; and collectively the newly covered\nsources would face permitting costs of $147 billion. Id., at\n31562–31563. Moreover, “the great majority of additional\nsources brought into the PSD and title V programs would\nbe small sources that Congress did not expect would need\nto undergo permitting.” Id., at 31533. EPA stated that\nthese results would be so “contrary to congressional in-\ntent,” and would so “severely undermine what Congress\nsought to accomplish,” that they necessitated as much as a\n1,000-fold increase in the permitting thresholds set forth\nin the statute. Id., at 31554, 31562.\n18        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Like EPA, we think it beyond reasonable debate that\nrequiring permits for sources based solely on their emis-\nsion of greenhouse gases at the 100- and 250-tons-per-year\nlevels set forth in the statute would be “incompatible” with\n“the substance of Congress’ regulatory scheme.” Brown &\nWilliamson, 529 U. S., at 156. A brief review of the rele-\nvant statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD\nprogram and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot\nrationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large\nsources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and\nprocedural burdens.\n  Start with the PSD program, which imposes numerous\nand costly requirements on those sources that are required\nto apply for permits. Among other things, the applicant\nmust make available a detailed scientific analysis of the\nsource’s potential pollution-related impacts, demonstrate\nthat the source will not contribute to the violation of any\napplicable pollution standard, and identify and use the\n“best available control technology” for each regulated\npollutant it emits. §7475(a)(3), (4), (6), (e). The permitting\nauthority (the State, usually) also bears its share of the\nburden: It must grant or deny a permit within a year,\nduring which time it must hold a public hearing on the\napplication. §7475(a)(2), (c).      Not surprisingly, EPA\nacknowledges that PSD review is a “complicated, resource-\nintensive, time-consuming, and sometimes contentious\nprocess” suitable for “hundreds of larger sources,” not\n“tens of thousands of smaller sources.” 74 Fed. Reg.\n55304, 55321–55322.\n  Title V contains no comparable substantive require-\nments but imposes elaborate procedural mandates. It\nrequires the applicant to submit, within a year of becom-\ning subject to Title V, a permit application and a “compli-\nance plan” describing how it will comply with “all applica-\nble requirements” under the Act; to certify its compliance\nannually; and to submit to “inspection, entry, monitoring,\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n. . . and reporting requirements.”            §§7661b(b)–(c),\n7661c(a)–(c). The procedural burdens on the permitting\nauthority and EPA are also significant. The permitting\nauthority must hold a public hearing on the application,\n§7661a(b)(6), and it must forward the application and any\nproposed permit to EPA and neighboring States and re-\nspond in writing to their comments, §7661d(a), (b)(1). If it\nfails to issue or deny the permit within 18 months, any\ninterested party can sue to require a decision “without\nadditional delay.” §§7661a(b)(7), 7661b(c). An interested\nparty also can petition EPA to block issuance of the per-\nmit; EPA must grant or deny the petition within 60 days,\nand its decision may be challenged in federal court.\n§7661d(b)(2)–(3). As EPA wrote, Title V is “finely crafted\nfor thousands,” not millions, of sources. Tailoring Rule\n31563.\n    The fact that EPA’s greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpre-\ntation of the PSD and Title V triggers would place plainly\nexcessive demands on limited governmental resources is\nalone a good reason for rejecting it; but that is not the only\nreason. EPA’s interpretation is also unreasonable because\nit would bring about an enormous and transformative\nexpansion in EPA’s regulatory authority without clear\ncongressional authorization. When an agency claims to\ndiscover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to\nregulate “a significant portion of the American economy,”\nBrown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159, we typically greet\nits announcement with a measure of skepticism. We\nexpect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to\nan agency decisions of vast “economic and political signifi-\ncance.” Id., at 160; see also MCI Telecommunications\nCorp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S.\n218, 231 (1994); Industrial Union Dept., AFL–CIO v.\nAmerican Petroleum Institute, 448 U. S. 607, 645–646\n(1980) (plurality opinion). The power to require permits\nfor the construction and modification of tens of thousands,\n20          UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nand the operation of millions, of small sources nationwide\nfalls comfortably within the class of authorizations that we\nhave been reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory text.\nMoreover, in EPA’s assertion of that authority, we con-\nfront a singular situation: an agency laying claim to ex-\ntravagant statutory power over the national economy\nwhile at the same time strenuously asserting that the\nauthority claimed would render the statute “unrecogniza-\nble to the Congress that designed” it. Tailoring Rule\n31555. Since, as we hold above, the statute does not com-\npel EPA’s interpretation, it would be patently unreason-\nable—not to say outrageous—for EPA to insist on seizing\nexpansive power that it admits the statute is not designed\nto grant.7\n                             3\n  EPA thought that despite the foregoing problems, it\ncould make its interpretation reasonable by adjusting the\nlevels at which a source’s greenhouse-gas emissions would\n——————\n  7 A few additional points bear mentioning.      The Solicitor General\nconjectures that EPA might eventually alter its longstanding interpre-\ntation of “potential to emit” in order to reduce the number of sources\nrequired to have permits at the statutory thresholds. But neither he\nnor the Agency has given us any reason to believe that there exists a\nplausible reading of “potential to emit” that EPA would willingly adopt\nand that would eliminate the unreasonableness of EPA’s interpretation.\nNor have we been given any information about the ability of other\npossible “streamlining” techniques alluded to by EPA—such as “gen-\neral” or “electronic” permitting—to reduce the administrability prob-\nlems identified above; and in any event, none of those techniques would\naddress the more fundamental problem of EPA’s claiming regulatory\nauthority over millions of small entities that it acknowledges the Act\ndoes not seek to regulate. Finally, the Solicitor General suggests that\nthe incompatibility of greenhouse gases with the PSD program and\nTitle V results chiefly from the inclusion of carbon dioxide in the\n“aggregate pollutant” defined by EPA. We decide these cases on the\nbasis of the pollutant “greenhouse gases” as EPA has defined and\nregulated it, and we express no view on how our analysis might change\nwere EPA to define it differently.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noblige it to undergo PSD and Title V permitting. Although\nthe Act, in no uncertain terms, requires permits for\nsources with the potential to emit more than 100 or 250\ntons per year of a relevant pollutant, EPA in its Tailoring\nRule wrote a new threshold of 100,000 tons per year for\ngreenhouse gases. Since the Court of Appeals thought the\nstatute unambiguously made greenhouse gases capable of\ntriggering PSD and Title V, it held that petitioners lacked\nArticle III standing to challenge the Tailoring Rule be-\ncause that rule did not injure petitioners but merely re-\nlaxed the pre-existing statutory requirements. Because\nwe, however, hold that EPA’s greenhouse-gas-inclusive\ninterpretation of the triggers was not compelled, and\nbecause EPA has essentially admitted that its interpreta-\ntion would be unreasonable without “tailoring,” we consider\nthe validity of the Tailoring Rule.\n   We conclude that EPA’s rewriting of the statutory\nthresholds was impermissible and therefore could not\nvalidate the Agency’s interpretation of the triggering\nprovisions. An agency has no power to “tailor” legislation\nto bureaucratic policy goals by rewriting unambiguous\nstatutory terms. Agencies exercise discretion only in the\ninterstices created by statutory silence or ambiguity; they\nmust always “ ‘give effect to the unambiguously expressed\nintent of Congress.’ ” National Assn. of Home Builders v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 665 (2007) (quoting\nChevron, 467 U. S., at 843). It is hard to imagine a statu-\ntory term less ambiguous than the precise numerical\nthresholds at which the Act requires PSD and Title V\npermitting. When EPA replaced those numbers with\nothers of its own choosing, it went well beyond the “bounds\nof its statutory authority.” Arlington, 569 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 5) (emphasis deleted).\n   The Solicitor General does not, and cannot, defend the\nTailoring Rule as an exercise of EPA’s enforcement discre-\ntion. The Tailoring Rule is not just an announcement of\n22        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nEPA’s refusal to enforce the statutory permitting require-\nments; it purports to alter those requirements and to\nestablish with the force of law that otherwise-prohibited\nconduct will not violate the Act. This alteration of the\nstatutory requirements was crucial to EPA’s “tailoring”\nefforts. Without it, small entities with the potential to\nemit greenhouse gases in amounts exceeding the statutory\nthresholds would have remained subject to citizen suits—\nauthorized by the Act—to enjoin their construction, modi-\nfication, or operation and to impose civil penalties of up to\n$37,500 per day of violation. §§7413(b), 7604(a), (f)(4); 40\nCFR §19.4. EPA itself has recently affirmed that the\n“independent enforcement authority” furnished by the\ncitizen-suit provision cannot be displaced by a permitting\nauthority’s decision not to pursue enforcement. 78 Fed.\nReg. 12477, 12486–12487 (2013). The Solicitor General is\ntherefore quite right to acknowledge that the availability\nof citizen suits made it necessary for EPA, in seeking\nto mitigate the unreasonableness of its greenhouse-gas-\ninclusive interpretation, to go beyond merely exercising its\nenforcement discretion. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 87–88.\n   For similar reasons, Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199\n(1974)—to which the Solicitor General points as the best\ncase supporting the Tailoring Rule, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 71,\n80–81—is irrelevant. In Ruiz, Congress had appropriated\nfunds for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to spend on provid-\ning assistance to “ ‘Indians throughout the United States’ ”\nand had not “impose[d] any geographical limitation on the\navailability of general assistance benefits.” Id., at 206–\n207, and n. 7. Although we held the Bureau could not\ndeny benefits to off-reservation Indians because it had not\npublished its eligibility criteria, we stated in dictum that\nthe Bureau could, if it followed proper administrative\nprocedures, “create reasonable classifications and eligibil-\nity requirements in order to allocate the limited funds\navailable.” Id., at 230–231. That dictum stands only for\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe unremarkable proposition that an agency may adopt\npolicies to prioritize its expenditures within the bounds\nestablished by Congress. See also Lincoln v. Vigil, 508\nU. S. 182, 192–193 (1993). Nothing in Ruiz remotely\nauthorizes an agency to modify unambiguous require-\nments imposed by a federal statute. An agency confront-\ning resource constraints may change its own conduct, but\nit cannot change the law.\n   Were we to recognize the authority claimed by EPA in\nthe Tailoring Rule, we would deal a severe blow to the\nConstitution’s separation of powers. Under our system of\ngovernment, Congress makes laws and the President,\nacting at times through agencies like EPA, “faithfully\nexecute[s]” them. U. S. Const., Art. II, §3; see Medellín v.\nTexas, 552 U. S. 491, 526–527 (2008). The power of exe-\ncuting the laws necessarily includes both authority and\nresponsibility to resolve some questions left open by Con-\ngress that arise during the law’s administration. But it\ndoes not include a power to revise clear statutory terms\nthat turn out not to work in practice. See, e.g., Barnhart\nv. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002) (agency\nlacked authority “to develop new guidelines or to assign\nliability in a manner inconsistent with” an “unambiguous\nstatute”).\n   In the Tailoring Rule, EPA asserts newfound authority\nto regulate millions of small sources—including retail\nstores, offices, apartment buildings, shopping centers,\nschools, and churches—and to decide, on an ongoing basis\nand without regard for the thresholds prescribed by Con-\ngress, how many of those sources to regulate. We are not\nwilling to stand on the dock and wave goodbye as EPA\nembarks on this multiyear voyage of discovery. We reaf-\nfirm the core administrative-law principle that an agency\nmay not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense\nof how the statute should operate. EPA therefore lacked\nauthority to “tailor” the Act’s unambiguous numerical\n24            UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthresholds to accommodate its greenhouse-gas-inclusive\ninterpretation of the permitting triggers. Instead, the\nneed to rewrite clear provisions of the statute should have\nalerted EPA that it had taken a wrong interpretive turn.\nAgencies are not free to “adopt . . . unreasonable interpre-\ntations of statutory provisions and then edit other statu-\ntory provisions to mitigate the unreasonableness.” App. 175,\n2012 WL 6621785, *16 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc). Because the Tailoring Rule\ncannot save EPA’s interpretation of the triggers, that\ninterpretation was impermissible under Chevron.8\n             B. BACT for “Anyway” Sources\n  For the reasons we have given, EPA overstepped its\nstatutory authority when it decided that a source could\n——————\n  8 JUSTICE BREYER argues, post, at 10 (opinion concurring in part and\ndissenting in part), that when the statutory permitting thresholds of\n100 or 250 tons per year do not provide a “sensible regulatory line,”\nEPA is entitled to “read an unwritten exception” into “the particular\nnumber used by the statute”—by which he apparently means that the\nAgency is entitled to substitute a dramatically higher number, such as\n100,000. We are aware of no principle of administrative law that would\nallow an agency to rewrite such a clear statutory term, and we shudder\nto contemplate the effect that such a principle would have on demo-\ncratic governance.\n  JUSTICE BREYER, however, claims to perceive no difference between\n(a) reading the statute to exclude greenhouse gases from the term “any\nair pollutant” in the permitting triggers, and (b) reading the statute to\nexclude sources emitting less than 100,000 tons per year from the\nstatutory phrase “any . . . source with the potential to emit two hundred\nand fifty tons per year or more.” See post, at 7. The two could scarcely\nbe further apart. As we have explained (and as EPA agrees), statutory\ncontext makes plain that the Act’s operative provisions use “air pollu-\ntant” to denote less than the full range of pollutants covered by the Act-\nwide definition. See Part II–A–1, supra. It is therefore incumbent on\nEPA to specify the pollutants encompassed by that term in the context\nof a particular program, and to do so reasonably in light of that pro-\ngram’s overall regulatory scheme. But there is no ambiguity whatso-\never in the specific, numerical permitting thresholds, and thus no room\nfor EPA to exercise discretion in selecting a different threshold.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

But what about “anyway”\nsources, those that would need permits based on their\nemissions of more conventional pollutants (such as partic-\nulate matter)? We now consider whether EPA reasonably\ninterpreted the Act to require those sources to comply with\n“best available control technology” emission standards for\ngreenhouse gases.\n                               1\n   To obtain a PSD permit, a source must be “subject to the\nbest available control technology” for “each pollutant\nsubject to regulation under [the Act]” that it emits.\n§7475(a)(4). The Act defines BACT as “an emission limita-\ntion based on the maximum degree of reduction of each\npollutant subject to regulation” that is “achievable . . .\nthrough application of production processes and available\nmethods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning,\nclean fuels, or treatment or innovative fuel combustion\ntechniques.” §7479(3). BACT is determined “on a case-by-\ncase basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and\neconomic impacts and other costs.” Ibid.\n   Some petitioners urge us to hold that EPA may never\nrequire BACT for greenhouse gases—even when a source\nmust undergo PSD review based on its emissions of con-\nventional pollutants—because BACT is fundamentally\nunsuited to greenhouse-gas regulation. BACT, they say,\nhas traditionally been about end-of-stack controls “such as\ncatalytic converters or particle collectors”; but applying it\nto greenhouse gases will make it more about regulating\nenergy use, which will enable regulators to control “every\naspect of a facility’s operation and design,” right down to\nthe “light bulbs in the factory cafeteria.” Brief for Peti-\ntioner Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on\nGreenhouse Gas Regulation et al. in No. 12–1254, p. 7; see\nJoint Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 12–1248 etc., pp.\n26        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n14–15 (“BACT for [greenhouse gases] becomes an un-\nbounded exercise in command-and-control regulation” of\neverything from “efficient light bulbs” to “basic industrial\nprocesses”). But see Brief for Calpine Corp. as Amicus\nCuriae 10 (“[I]n Calpine’s experience with ‘anyway’\nsources, the [greenhouse-gas] analysis was only a small\npart of the overall permitting process”).\n  EPA has published a guidance document that lends\nsome credence to petitioners’ fears. It states that at least\ninitially, compulsory improvements in energy efficiency\nwill be the “foundation” of greenhouse-gas BACT, with\nmore traditional end-of-stack controls either not used or\n“added as they become more available.” PSD and Title V\nPermitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases 29 (Mar. 2011)\n(hereinafter Guidance); see Peloso & Dobbins, Greenhouse\nGas PSD Permitting: The Year in Review, 42 Tex. Env.\nL. J. 233, 247 (2012) (“Because [other controls] tend to\nprove infeasible, energy efficiency measures dominate the\n[greenhouse-gas] BACT controls approved by the states\nand EPA”). But EPA’s guidance also states that BACT\nanalysis should consider options other than energy effi-\nciency, such as “carbon capture and storage.” Guidance\n29, 32, 35–36, 42–43. EPA argues that carbon capture is\nreasonably comparable to more traditional, end-of-stack\nBACT technologies, id., at 32, n. 86, and petitioners do not\ndispute that.\n  Moreover, assuming without deciding that BACT may\nbe used to force some improvements in energy efficiency,\nthere are important limitations on BACT that may work\nto mitigate petitioners’ concerns about “unbounded” regu-\nlatory authority. For one, BACT is based on “control\ntechnology” for the applicant’s “proposed facility,”\n§7475(a)(4); therefore, it has long been held that BACT\ncannot be used to order a fundamental redesign of the\nfacility. See, e.g., Sierra Club v. EPA, 499 F. 3d 653, 654–\n655 (CA7 2007); In re Pennsauken Cty., N. J., Resource\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

For\nanother, EPA has long interpreted BACT as required only\nfor pollutants that the source itself emits, see 44 Fed. Reg.\n51947 (1979); accordingly, EPA acknowledges that BACT\nmay not be used to require “reductions in a facility’s de-\nmand for energy from the electric grid.” Guidance 24.\nFinally, EPA’s guidance suggests that BACT should not\nrequire every conceivable change that could result in\nminor improvements in energy efficiency, such as the\naforementioned light bulbs. Id., at 31. The guidance\nexplains that permitting authorities should instead con-\nsider whether a proposed regulatory burden outweighs\nany reduction in emissions to be achieved, and should\nconcentrate on the facility’s equipment that uses the\nlargest amounts of energy. Ibid.\n                             2\n   The question before us is whether EPA’s decision to\nrequire BACT for greenhouse gases emitted by sources\notherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a\npermissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron.\nWe conclude that it is.\n   The text of the BACT provision is far less open-ended\nthan the text of the PSD and Title V permitting triggers.\nIt states that BACT is required “for each pollutant subject\nto regulation under this chapter” (i.e., the entire Act),\n§7475(a)(4), a phrase that—as the D. C. Circuit wrote 35\nyears ago—“would not seem readily susceptible [of] misin-\nterpretation.” Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F. 2d 323,\n404 (1979). Whereas the dubious breadth of “any air\npollutant” in the permitting triggers suggests a role for\nagency judgment in identifying the subset of pollutants\ncovered by the particular regulatory program at issue, the\nmore specific phrasing of the BACT provision suggests\nthat the necessary judgment has already been made by\nCongress. The wider statutory context likewise does not\n28        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuggest that the BACT provision can bear a narrowing\nconstruction: There is no indication that the Act elsewhere\nuses, or that EPA has interpreted, “each pollutant subject\nto regulation under this chapter” to mean anything other\nthan what it says.\n   Even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to\ngreenhouse gases is not so disastrously unworkable, and\nneed not result in such a dramatic expansion of agency\nauthority, as to convince us that EPA’s interpretation is\nunreasonable. We are not talking about extending EPA\njurisdiction over millions of previously unregulated enti-\nties, but about moderately increasing the demands EPA\n(or a state permitting authority) can make of entities\nalready subject to its regulation. And it is not yet clear\nthat EPA’s demands will be of a significantly different\ncharacter from those traditionally associated with PSD\nreview. In short, the record before us does not establish\nthat the BACT provision as written is incapable of being\nsensibly applied to greenhouse gases.\n   We acknowledge the potential for greenhouse-gas BACT\nto lead to an unreasonable and unanticipated degree of\nregulation, and our decision should not be taken as an\nendorsement of all aspects of EPA’s current approach, nor\nas a free rein for any future regulatory application of\nBACT in this distinct context. Our narrow holding is that\nnothing in the statute categorically prohibits EPA from\ninterpreting the BACT provision to apply to greenhouse\ngases emitted by “anyway” sources.\n   However, EPA may require an “anyway” source to com-\nply with greenhouse-gas BACT only if the source emits\nmore than a de minimis amount of greenhouse gases. As\nnoted above, the Tailoring Rule applies BACT only if a\nsource emits greenhouse gases in excess of 75,000 tons per\nyear CO2e, but the Rule makes clear that EPA did not\narrive at that number by identifying the de minimis level.\nSee nn. 1, 3, supra.

We do not hold that\n75,000 tons per year CO2e necessarily exceeds a true de\nminimis level, only that EPA must justify its selection on\nproper grounds. Cf. Alabama Power, supra, at 405.9\n                        *     *    *\n   To sum up: We hold that EPA exceeded its statutory\nauthority when it interpreted the Clean Air Act to require\nPSD and Title V permitting for stationary sources based\non their greenhouse-gas emissions. Specifically, the Agency\nmay not treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant for pur-\nposes of defining a “major emitting facility” (or a “modifi-\ncation” thereof) in the PSD context or a “major source” in\nthe Title V context. To the extent its regulations purport\nto do so, they are invalid. EPA may, however, continue to\ntreat greenhouse gases as a “pollutant subject to regula-\ntion under this chapter” for purposes of requiring BACT\nfor “anyway” sources. The judgment of the Court of Ap-\npeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n——————\n  9 JUSTICE ALITO argues that BACT is “fundamentally incompatible”\n\nwith greenhouse gases for two reasons. Post, at 4 (opinion concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). First, BACT requires consideration of\n“ambient air quality at the proposed site and in areas which may be\naffected by emissions from [the proposed] facility for each pollutant\nsubject to regulation under this chapter,” §7475(e)(1); see also\n§7475(e)(3)(B); and it is not obvious how that requirement should apply,\nor even whether it can apply, to greenhouse gases. Post, at 4–5. But\nthe possibility that that requirement may be inoperative as to green-\nhouse gases does not convince us that they must be categorically\nexcluded from BACT even though they are indisputably a “pollutant\nsubject to regulation.” Second, JUSTICE ALITO argues that EPA’s\nguidance on how to implement greenhouse-gas BACT is a recipe for\n“arbitrary and inconsistent decisionmaking.” Post, at 8. But we are not\nreviewing EPA’s guidance in these cases, and we cannot say that it is\nimpossible for EPA and state permitting authorities to devise rational\nways of complying with the statute’s directive to determine BACT for\ngreenhouse gases “on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy,\nenvironmental, and economic impacts and other costs.” §7479(3).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), we held\nthat greenhouse gases fall within the Clean Air Act’s\ngeneral definition of the term “air pollutant,” 42 U. S. C.\n§7602(g). 549 U. S., at 528–529. We also held, conse-\nquently, that the Environmental Protection Agency is\nempowered and required by Title II of the Act to regulate\ngreenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources (such as\ncars and trucks) if it decides that greenhouse gases “con-\ntribute to . . . air pollution which may reasonably be antic-\nipated to endanger public health or welfare,” §7521(a)(1).\n549 U. S., at 532–533. The EPA determined that green-\nhouse gases endanger human health and welfare, 74 Fed.\nReg. 66496 (2009) (Endangerment Finding), and so it\nissued regulations for mobile emissions, 75 Fed. Reg.\n25324 (2010) (Tailpipe Rule).\n   These cases take as a given our decision in Massachu-\nsetts that the Act’s general definition of “air pollutant”\nincludes greenhouse gases. One of the questions posed by\nthese cases is whether those gases fall within the scope of\nthe phrase “any air pollutant” as that phrase is used in the\nmore specific provisions of the Act here at issue. The\nCourt’s answer is “no.” Ante, at 10–24. I disagree.\n   The Clean Air Act provisions at issue here are Title I’s\nPrevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program,\n§7470 et seq., and Title V’s permitting regime, §7661 et\nseq. By contrast to Title II, Titles I and V apply to sta-\ntionary sources, such as power plants and factories. Un-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nder the PSD program, “major emitting facilities” con-\nstructed in the United States must meet certain require-\nments, including obtaining a permit that imposes emis-\nsions limitations, §7475(a)(1), and using “the best\navailable control technology for each pollutant subject to\nregulation under [the Act] emitted from” the facility,\n§7475(a)(4). Title V requires each “major source” to obtain\nan operating permit. §7661a(a).\n  These cases concern the definitions of “major emitting\nfacility” and “major source,” each of which is defined to\nmean any stationary source that emits more than a\nthreshold quantity of “any air pollutant.” See §7479(1)\n(“major emitting facility”); §§7602(j), 7661(2)(B) (“major\nsource”). To simplify the exposition, I will refer only to the\nPSD program and its definition of “major emitting facility”;\na parallel analysis applies to Title V.\n  As it is used in the PSD provisions,\n    “[t]he term ‘major emitting facility’ means any of [a\n    list of specific categories of] stationary sources of air\n    pollutants which emit, or have the potential to emit,\n    one hundred tons per year or more of any air pollutant\n    . . . . Such term also includes any other source with\n    the potential to emit two hundred and fifty tons per\n    year or more of any air pollutant.” §7479(1).\nTo simplify further, I will ignore the reference to specific\ntypes of source that emit at least 100 tons per year (tpy) of\nany air pollutant. In effect, we are dealing with a statute\nthat says that the PSD program’s regulatory requirements\nmust be applied to\n    “any stationary source that has the potential to emit\n    two hundred fifty tons per year or more of any air\n    pollutant.”\n  The interpretive difficulty in these cases arises out of\nthe definition’s use of the phrase “two hundred fifty tons\n4         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nper year or more,” which I will call the “250 tpy threshold.”\nWhen applied to greenhouse gases, 250 tpy is far too low a\nthreshold. As the Court explains, tens of thousands of\nstationary sources emit large quantities of one greenhouse\ngas, carbon dioxide. See ante, at 17–20, and n. 7. To\napply the programs at issue here to all those sources\nwould be extremely expensive and burdensome, counter-\nproductive, and perhaps impossible; it would also contra-\nvene Congress’s intent that the programs’ coverage be\nlimited to those large sources whose emissions are sub-\nstantial enough to justify the regulatory burdens. Ibid.\nThe EPA recognized as much, and it addressed the prob-\nlem by issuing a regulation—the Tailoring Rule—that\npurports to raise the coverage threshold for greenhouse\ngases from the statutory figure of 250 tpy to 100,000 tpy\nin order to keep the programs’ coverage limited to “a rela-\ntively small number of large industrial sources.” 75 Fed.\nReg. 31514, 31555 (2010); see id., at 31523–31524.\n   The Tailoring Rule solves the practical problems that\nwould have been caused by the 250 tpy threshold. But\nwhat are we to do about the statute’s language? The\nstatute specifies a definite number—250, not 100,000—\nand it says that facilities that are covered by that number\nmust meet the program’s requirements. The statute says\nnothing about agency discretion to change that number.\nWhat is to be done? How, given the statute’s language,\ncan the EPA exempt from regulation sources that emit\nmore than 250 but less than 100,000 tpy of greenhouse\ngases (and that also do not emit other regulated pollutants\nat threshold levels)?\n   The Court answers by (1) pointing out that regulation at\nthe 250 tpy threshold would produce absurd results, (2)\nrefusing to read the statute as compelling such results,\nand (3) consequently interpreting the phrase “any air\npollutant” as containing an implicit exception for green-\nhouse gases. (Emphasis added.) Put differently, the\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nCourt reads the statute as defining “major emitting facility”\nto mean “stationary sources that have the potential to\nemit two hundred fifty tons per year or more of any air\npollutant except for those air pollutants, such as carbon\ndioxide, with respect to which regulation at that threshold\nwould be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller\nsources that Congress did not mean to cover.” See ante, at\n15–16 (“[T]here is no insuperable textual barrier to EPA’s\ninterpreting ‘any air pollutant’ in the permitting triggers\nof PSD and Title V to encompass only pollutants emitted\nin quantities that enable them to be sensibly regulated at\nthe statutory thresholds, and to exclude those atypical\npollutants that, like greenhouse gases, are emitted in such\nvast quantities that their inclusion would radically trans-\nform those programs and render them unworkable as\nwritten”).\n    I agree with the Court that the word “any,” when used\nin a statute, does not normally mean “any in the uni-\nverse.” Cf. FCC v. NextWave Personal Communications\nInc., 537 U. S. 293, 311 (2003) (BREYER, J., dissenting)\n(“ ‘Tell all customers that . . .’ does not refer to every cus-\ntomer of every business in the world”). Rather, “[g]eneral\nterms as used on particular occasions often carry with\nthem implied restrictions as to scope,” ibid., and so courts\nmust interpret the word “any,” like all other words, in\ncontext. As Judge Learned Hand pointed out when inter-\npreting another statute many years ago, “[w]e can best\nreach the meaning here, as always, by recourse to the\nunderlying purpose, and, with that as a guide, by trying to\nproject upon the specific occasion how we think persons,\nactuated by such a purpose, would have dealt with it, if it\nhad been presented to them at the time.” Borella v. Bor-\nden Co., 145 F. 2d 63, 64 (CA2 1944). The pursuit of that\nunderlying purpose may sometimes require us to “aban-\ndon” a “literal interpretation” of a word like “any.” Id., at\n64–65.\n6         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n    The law has long recognized that terms such as “any”\nadmit of unwritten limitations and exceptions. Legal\nphilosophers like to point out that a statute providing that\n“ ‘[w]hoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be\npunished by death’ ” need not encompass a man who kills\nin self-defense; nor must an ordinance imposing fines upon\nthose who occupy a public parking spot for more than two\nhours penalize a driver who is unable to move because of a\nparade. See Fuller, The Case of the Speluncean Explorers,\n62 Harv. L. Rev. 616, 619, 624 (1949); see also United\nStates v. Kirby, 7 Wall. 482, 485–487 (1869) (holding that\na statute forbidding knowing and willful obstruction of the\nmail contains an implicit exception permitting a local\nsheriff to arrest a mail carrier). The maxim cessante\nratione legis cessat ipse lex—where a law’s rationale ceases\nto apply, so does the law itself—is not of recent origin.\nSee, e.g., Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 699 (2001)\n(citing 1 E. Coke, Institutes *70b); Green v. Liter, 8 Cranch\n229, 249 (1814) (Story, J.) (“cessante ratione, cessat ipsa\nlex”).\n    I also agree with the Court’s point that “a generic refer-\nence to air pollutants” in the Clean Air Act need not “en-\ncompass every substance falling within the Act-wide\ndefinition” that we construed in Massachusetts, §7602(g).\nSee ante, at 12–13. As the Court notes, the EPA has\ninterpreted the phrase “any air pollutant,” which is used\nseveral times in the Act, as limited to “air pollutants for\nwhich EPA has promulgated [new source performance\nstandards]” in the portion of the Act dealing with those\nstandards, as limited to “visibility-impairing air pollu-\ntants” in the part of the Act concerned with deleterious\neffects on visibility, and as limited to “pollutants for which\nthe area is designated nonattainment” in the part of the\nAct aimed at regions that fail to attain air quality stand-\nards. Ibid.\n    But I do not agree with the Court that the only way to\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\navoid an absurd or otherwise impermissible result in these\ncases is to create an atextual greenhouse gas exception to\nthe phrase “any air pollutant.” After all, the word “any”\nmakes an earlier appearance in the definitional provision,\nwhich defines “major emitting facility” to mean “any . . .\nsource with the potential to emit two hundred and fifty\ntons per year or more of any air pollutant.” §7479(1)\n(emphasis added). As a linguistic matter, one can just as\neasily read an implicit exception for small-scale green-\nhouse gas emissions into the phrase “any source” as into\nthe phrase “any air pollutant.” And given the purposes of\nthe PSD program and the Act as a whole, as well as the\nspecific roles of the different parts of the statutory defini-\ntion, finding flexibility in “any source” is far more sensible\nthan the Court’s route of finding it in “any air pollutant.”\n   The implicit exception I propose reads almost word for\nword the same as the Court’s, except that the location of\nthe exception has shifted. To repeat, the Court reads the\ndefinition of “major emitting facility” as if it referred to\n“any source with the potential to emit two hundred fifty\ntons per year or more of any air pollutant except for those\nair pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, with respect to\nwhich regulation at that threshold would be impractical or\nabsurd or would sweep in smaller sources that Congress\ndid not mean to cover.” I would simply move the implicit\nexception, which I’ve italicized, so that it applies to\n“source” rather than “air pollutant”: “any source with the\npotential to emit two hundred fifty tons per year or more\nof any air pollutant except for those sources, such as those\nemitting unmanageably small amounts of greenhouse\ngases, with respect to which regulation at that threshold\nwould be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller\nsources that Congress did not mean to cover.”\n   From a legal, administrative, and functional perspec-\ntive—that is, from a perspective that assumes that Con-\ngress was not merely trying to arrange words on paper but\n8         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nwas seeking to achieve a real-world purpose—my way of\nreading the statute is the more sensible one. For one\nthing, my reading is consistent with the specific purpose\nunderlying the 250 tpy threshold specified by the statute.\nThe purpose of that number was not to prevent the regula-\ntion of dangerous air pollutants that cannot be sensibly\nregulated at that particular threshold, though that is the\neffect that the Court’s reading gives the threshold. Ra-\nther, the purpose was to limit the PSD program’s obliga-\ntions to larger sources while exempting the many small\nsources whose emissions are low enough that imposing\nburdensome regulatory requirements on them would be\nsenseless.\n   Thus, the accompanying Senate Report explains that\nthe PSD program “is reasonable and necessary for very\nlarge sources, such as new electrical generating plants or\nnew steel mills. But the procedure would prove costly and\npotentially unreasonable if imposed on construction of\nstorage facilities for a small gasoline jobber or on the\nconstruction of a new heating plant at a junior college.”\nS. Rep. No. 95–127, p. 96 (1977). And the principal spon-\nsor of the Clean Air Act amendments at issue here, Sena-\ntor Edmund Muskie, told the Senate that the program\nwould not cover “houses, dairies, farms, highways, hospi-\ntals, schools, grocery stores, and other such sources.” 123\nCong. Rec. 18013, 18021 (1977).\n   The EPA, exercising the legal authority to which it is\nentitled under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), understood the\nthreshold’s purpose in the same light. It explained that\nCongress’s objective was\n    “to limit the PSD program to large industrial sources\n    because it was those sources that were the primary\n    cause of the pollution problems in question and be-\n    cause those sources would have the resources to com-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n    ply with the PSD requirements. Congress’s mecha-\n    nism for limiting PSD was the 100/250 tpy threshold\n    limitations. Focused as it was primarily on NAAQS\n    pollutants [that is, those air pollutants for which the\n    EPA has issued a national ambient air quality stand-\n    ard under Title I of the Act, see EPA v. EME Homer\n    City Generation, L. P., 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\n    op., at 4)], Congress considered sources that emit\n    NAAQS pollutants in those quantities generally to be\n    the large industrial sources to which it intended PSD\n    to be limited.” Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. 31555.\n   The Court similarly acknowledges that “the PSD pro-\ngram and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot\nrationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large\nsources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and\nprocedural burdens.” Ante, at 18; see also Alabama Power\nCo. v. Costle, 636 F. 2d 323, 353 (CADC 1979) (“Congress’s\nintention was to identify facilities which, due to their size,\nare financially able to bear the substantial regulatory\ncosts imposed by the PSD provisions and which, as a\ngroup, are primarily responsible for emission of the delete-\nrious pollutants that befoul our nation’s air”).\n   An implicit source-related exception would serve this\nstatutory purpose while going no further. The implicit\nexception that the Court reads into the phrase “any air\npollutant,” by contrast, goes well beyond the limited con-\ngressional objective. Nothing in the statutory text, the\nlegislative history, or common sense suggests that Con-\ngress, when it imposed the 250 tpy threshold, was trying\nto undermine its own deliberate decision to use the broad\nlanguage “any air pollutant” by removing some substances\n(rather than some facilities) from the PSD program’s\ncoverage.\n   For another thing, a source-related exception serves the\nflexible nature of the Clean Air Act. We observed in Mas-\n10        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nsachusetts that “[w]hile the Congresses that drafted” the\nAct “might not have appreciated the possibility that burn-\ning fossil fuels could lead to global warming, they did\nunderstand that without regulatory flexibility, changing\ncircumstances and scientific developments would soon\nrender the Clean Air Act obsolete.” 549 U. S., at 532. We\nrecognized that “[t]he broad language of ” the Act-wide\ndefinition of “air pollutant” “reflects an intentional effort\nto confer the flexibility necessary to forestall such obsoles-\ncence.” Ibid.\n   The Court’s decision to read greenhouse gases out of the\nPSD program drains the Act of its flexibility and chips\naway at our decision in Massachusetts. What sense does it\nmake to read the Act as generally granting the EPA the\nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and then\nto read it as denying that power with respect to the pro-\ngrams for large stationary sources at issue here? It is\nanomalous to read the Act to require the EPA to regulate\nair pollutants that pose previously unforeseen threats to\nhuman health and welfare where “250 tons per year” is a\nsensible regulatory line but not where, by chemical or\nregulatory happenstance, a higher line must be drawn.\nAnd it is anomalous to read an unwritten exception into\nthe more important phrase of the statutory definition\n(“any air pollutant”) when a similar unwritten exception to\nless important language (the particular number used by\nthe statute) will do just as well. The implicit exception\npreferred by the Court produces all of these anomalies,\nwhile the source-related exception I propose creates none\nof them.\n   In addition, the interpretation I propose leaves the EPA\nwith the sort of discretion as to interstitial matters that\nCongress likely intended it to retain. My interpretation\ngives the EPA nothing more than the authority to exempt\nsources from regulation insofar as the Agency reasonably\ndetermines that applying the PSD program to them would\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nexpand the program so much as to contravene Congress’s\nintent. That sort of decision, which involves the Agency’s\ntechnical expertise and administrative experience, is the\nkind of decision that Congress typically leaves to the\nagencies to make. Cf. Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212,\n222 (2002) (enumerating factors that we take to indicate\nthat Congress intends the agency to exercise the discre-\ntion provided by Chevron). To read the Act to grant that\ndiscretion here is to read it as furthering Congress’s (and\nthe public’s) interest in more effective, less wasteful\nregulation.\n   Last, but by no means least, a source-related exception\nadvances the Act’s overall purpose. That broad purpose,\nas set forth at the beginning of the statute, is “to protect\nand enhance the quality of the Nation’s air resources so as\nto promote the public health and welfare and the produc-\ntive capacity of its population.” §7401(b)(1); see also\n§7470(1) (A purpose of the PSD program in particular\nis “to protect public health and welfare from any actual\nor potential adverse effect which in the Administra-\ntor’s judgment may reasonably be anticipate[d] to occur\nfrom air pollution”); §7602(h) (“All language [in the Act]\nreferring to effects on welfare includes . . . effects on . . .\nweather . . . and climate”). The expert agency charged\nwith administering the Act has determined in its En-\ndangerment Finding that greenhouse gases endanger\nhuman health and welfare, and so sensible regulation of\nindustrial emissions of those pollutants is at the core of\nthe purpose behind the Act. The broad “no greenhouse\ngases” exception that the Court reads into the statute\nunnecessarily undercuts that purpose, while my narrow\nsource-related exception would leave the Agency with the\ntools it needs to further it.\n                      *     *     *\n  I agree with the Court’s holding that stationary sources\n12        UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat are subject to the PSD program because they emit\nother (non-greenhouse-gas) pollutants in quantities above\nthe statutory threshold—those facilities that the Court\nrefers to as “anyway” sources—must meet the “best avail-\nable control technology” requirement of §7475(a)(4) with\nrespect to greenhouse gas emissions. I therefore join Part\nII–B–2 of the Court’s opinion. But as for the Court’s hold-\ning that the EPA cannot interpret the language at issue\nhere to cover facilities that emit more than 100,000 tpy of\ngreenhouse gases by virtue of those emissions, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

The Environmental Protection Agency\ncautioned us that “key provisions of the [Act] cannot co-\ngently be applied to [greenhouse gas] emissions,” Brief for\nFederal Respondent in Massachusetts v. EPA, O. T. 2006,\nNo. 05–1120, p. 22, but the Court brushed the warning\naside and had “little trouble” concluding that the Act’s\n“sweeping definition” of a pollutant encompasses green-\nhouse gases. 549 U.

S. C. §§7470–7492, as\nwell as Title V of the Act, §7661. And in order to make\nthose provisions apply to greenhouse gases in a way that\ndoes not produce absurd results, the EPA effectively\namended the Act. The Act contains specific emissions\nthresholds that trigger PSD and Title V coverage, but the\nEPA crossed out the figures enacted by Congress and\nsubstituted figures of its own.\n  I agree with the Court that the EPA is neither required\nnor permitted to take this extraordinary step, and I there-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nfore join Parts I and II–A of the Court’s opinion.\n                             II\n  I do not agree, however, with the Court’s conclusion that\nwhat it terms “anyway sources,” i.e., sources that are\nsubject to PSD and Title V permitting as the result of the\nemission of conventional pollutants, must install “best\navailable control technology” (BACT) for greenhouse gases.\nAs is the case with the PSD and Title V thresholds,\ntrying to fit greenhouse gases into the BACT analysis\nbadly distorts the scheme that Congress adopted.\n  The Court gives two main reasons for concluding that\nBACT applies to “anyway” sources, one based on text\nand one based on practical considerations. Neither is\nconvincing.\n                              A\n   With respect to the text, it is curious that the Court,\nhaving departed from a literal interpretation of the term\n“pollutant” in Part II–A, turns on its heels and adopts a\nliteral interpretation in Part II–B. The coverage thresh-\nolds at issue in Part II–A apply to any “pollutant.” The\nAct’s general definition of this term is broad, and in Mas-\nsachusetts v. EPA, supra, the Court held that this defini-\ntion covers greenhouse gases. The Court does not disturb\nthat holding, but it nevertheless concludes that, as used in\nthe provision triggering PSD coverage, the term “pollu-\ntant” actually means “pollutant, other than a greenhouse\ngas.”\n   In Part II–B, the relevant statutory provision says\nthat BACT must be installed for any “pollutant subject\nto regulation under [the Act].” §7475(a)(4). If the term\n“pollutant” means “pollutant, other than a greenhouse\ngas,” as the Court effectively concludes in Part II–A, the\nterm “pollutant subject to regulation under [the Act]” in\n§7475(a)(4) should mean “pollutant, other than a green-\n4         UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nhouse gas, subject to regulation under [the Act], and that\nis subject to regulation under [the Act].” The Court’s\nliteralism is selective, and it results in a strange and\ndisjointed regulatory scheme.\n   Under the Court’s interpretation, a source can emit an\nunlimited quantity of greenhouse gases without triggering\nthe need for a PSD permit. Why might Congress have\nwanted to allow this? The most likely explanation is that\nthe PSD permitting process is simply not suited for use in\nregulating this particular pollutant. And if that is so, it\nmakes little sense to require the installation of BACT for\ngreenhouse gases in those instances in which a source\nhappens to be required to obtain a permit due to the emis-\nsion of a qualifying quantity of some other pollutant that\nis regulated under the Act.\n                             B\n  The Court’s second reason for holding that BACT ap-\nplies to “anyway” sources is its belief that this can be done\nwithout disastrous consequences. Only time will tell\nwhether this hope is well founded, but it seems clear that\nBACT analysis is fundamentally incompatible with the\nregulation of greenhouse-gas emissions for at least two\nimportant reasons.\n                             1\n  First, BACT looks to the effects of covered pollutants in\nthe area in which a source is located. The PSD program is\nimplemented through “emission limitations and such\nother measures” as are “necessary . . . to prevent signifi-\ncant deterioration of air quality in each region.” §7471\n(emphasis added). The Clean Air Act provides that BACT\nmust be identified “on a case-by-case basis,” §7479(3), and\nthis necessarily means that local conditions must be taken\ninto account. For this reason, the Act instructs the EPA to\nissue regulations requiring an analysis of “the ambient air\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nquality . . . at the site of the proposed major emitting facil-\nity and in the area potentially affected by the emissions\nfrom such facility for each pollutant regulated under [the\nAct].” §7475(e)(3)(B) (emphasis added). The Act also\nrequires a public hearing on “the air quality at the pro-\nposed site and in areas which may be affected by emissions\nfrom such facility for each pollutant subject to regulation\nunder [the Act] which will be emitted from such facility.”\n§§7475(a)(2), (e)(1) (emphasis added). Accordingly, if\nBACT is required for greenhouse gases, the Act demands\nthat the impact of these gases in the area surrounding a\nsite must be monitored, explored at a public hearing, and\nconsidered as part of the permitting process. The effects of\ngreenhouse gases, however, are global, not local. See PSD\nand Title V Permitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases\n41–42 (Mar. 2011) (hereinafter Guidance). As a result, the\nEPA has declared that PSD permit applicants and permit-\nting officials may disregard these provisions of the Act. 75\nFed. Reg. 31520 (2010).\n                             2\n  Second, as part of the case-by-case analysis required by\nBACT, a permitting authority must balance the environ-\nmental benefit expected to result from the installation of\nan available control measure against adverse consequences\nthat may result, including any negative impact on the\nenvironment, energy conservation, and the economy. And\nthe EPA itself has admitted that this cannot be done on a\ncase-by-case basis with respect to greenhouse gases.\n  The Clean Air Act makes it clear that BACT must be\ndetermined on a “case-by-case basis, taking into account\nenergy, environmental, and economic impacts and other\ncosts.” §7479(3). To implement this directive, the EPA\nadopted a five-step framework for making a BACT deter-\nmination. See New Source Review Workshop Manual:\nPrevention of Significant Deterioration and Nonattain-\n6            UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nment Area Permitting (Oct. 1990).1 Under the fourth step\nof this analysis, potentially applicable and feasible control\ntechnologies that are candidates for selection as BACT for\na particular source are eliminated from consideration\nbased on their “collateral impacts,” such as any adverse\nenvironmental effects or adverse effects on energy con-\nsumption or the economy.\n   More recently, the EPA provided guidance to permitting\nauthorities regarding the treatment of greenhouse-gas\nemissions under this framework, and the EPA’s guidance\ndemonstrates the insuperable problem that results when\nan attempt is made to apply this framework to greenhouse\ngas emissions. As noted above, at step 4 of the framework,\na permitting authority must balance the positive effect\nlikely to result from requiring a particular source to install\na particular technology against a variety of negative ef-\nfects that are likely to occur if that step is taken. But\nin the case of greenhouse gases, how can a permit-\nting authority make this individualized, source-specific\ndetermination?\n   The EPA instructs permitting authorities to take into\n——————\n    1 The\n        EPA describes these steps as follows:\n  (1) The applicant must identify all available control options that are\npotentially applicable by consulting EPA’s BACT clearinghouse along\nwith other reliable sources.\n  (2) The technical feasibility of the control options identified in step 1\nare eliminated based on technical infeasibility.\n  (3) The control technologies are ranked based on control effective-\nness, by considering: the percentage of the pollutant removed; expected\nemission rate for each new source review (NSR) pollutant; expected\nemission reduction for each regulated NSR pollutant; and output based\nemissions limit.\n  (4) Control technologies are eliminated based on collateral impacts,\nsuch as: energy impacts; other environmental impacts; solid or hazard-\nous waste; water discharge from control device; emissions of air toxics\nand other non-NSR regulated pollutants; and economic impacts.\n  (5) The most effective control option not eliminated in step 4 is\nproposed as BACT for the pollutant and emission unit under review.\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                 7\n\n                        Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nconsideration all the adverse effects that the EPA has\nfound to result from the overall increase in greenhouse\ngases in the atmosphere. These include an increased risk\nof dangerous heat waves, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and\ndrought, as well as risks to agriculture, forestry, and\nwater resources. Guidance 40–41. But the EPA admits\nthat it is simply not possible for a permitting authority to\ncalculate in any meaningful way the degree to which any\npotential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from any\nindividual source might reduce these risks. And without\nmaking such a calculation in even a very rough way, a\npermitting authority cannot do what the Clean Air Act\nand the EPA’s framework demand—compare the benefits\nof some specified reduction in the emission of greenhouse\ngases from a particular source with any adverse environ-\nmental or economic effects that might result from mandat-\ning such a reduction.\n   Suppose, for example, that a permitting authority must\ndecide whether to mandate a change that both decreases a\nsource’s emission of greenhouse gases and increases its\nemission of a conventional pollutant that has a negative\neffect on public health. How should a permitting authority\ndecide whether to require this change? Here is the EPA’s\nadvice:\n    “[W]hen considering the trade-offs between the envi-\n    ronmental impacts of a particular level of GHG\n    [greenhouse gas] reduction and a collateral increase in\n    another regulated NSR pollutant,[2] rather than at-\n    tempting to determine or characterize specific envi-\n    ronmental impacts from GHGs emitted at particular\n    locations, EPA recommends that permitting authori-\n    ties focus on the amount of GHG emission reductions\n——————\n  2 “New source review pollutants” are those pollutants for which a\n\nNational Ambient Air Quality standard has been set and a few others,\nsuch as sulphur dioxide. See 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xxxvii) (2013).\n8             UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. EPA\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n       that may be gained or lost by employing a particular\n       control strategy and how that compares to the envi-\n       ronmental or other impacts resulting from the collat-\n       eral emissions increase of other regulated NSR pollu-\n       tants.” Guidance 42.\n   As best I can make out, what this means is that permit-\nting authorities should not even try to assess the net\nimpact on public health. Instead of comparing the positive\nand negative public health effects of a particular option,\npermitting authorities are instructed to compare the\nadverse public health effects of increasing the emissions of\nthe conventional pollutants with the amount of the reduc-\ntion of the source’s emissions of greenhouse gases. But\nwithout knowing the positive effects of the latter, this is a\nmeaningless comparison.\n   The EPA tries to ameliorate this problem by noting that\npermitting authorities are entitled to “a great deal of\ndiscretion,” Guidance 41, but without a comprehensible\nstandard, what this will mean is arbitrary and incon-\nsistent decisionmaking. That is not what the Clean Air\nAct contemplates.3\n                       *     *    *\n   BACT analysis, like the rest of the Clean Air Act, was\ndeveloped for use in regulating the emission of conven-\ntional pollutants and is simply not suited for use with\nrespect to greenhouse gases. I therefore respectfully\ndissent from Part II–B–2 of the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n    3 WhileI do not think that BACT applies at all to “anyway sources,” if\nit is to apply, the limitations suggested in Part II–B–1 might lessen the\ninconsistencies highlighted in Part II of this opinion, and on that\nunderstanding I join Part II–B–1.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2679834/", "sha1": "2c7f8efafc88a9d11388df00c7e128e02fb1fb7c", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-063", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-23T08:01:52.504616"}
