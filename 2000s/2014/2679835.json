JOHN FUND, \n\n     INC., FKA ARCHDIOCESE OF MILWAUKEE\n\n             SUPPORTING FUND, INC. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 13–317.     Argued March 5, 2014—Decided June 23, 2014\nInvestors can recover damages in a private securities fraud action only\n  if they prove that they relied on the defendant’s misrepresentation in\n  deciding to buy or sell a company’s stock. In Basic Inc. v. Levinson,\n  485 U. S. 224, this Court held that investors could satisfy this reli-\n  ance requirement by invoking a presumption that the price of stock\n  traded in an efficient market reflects all public, material infor-\n  mation—including material misrepresentations. The Court also held,\n  however, that a defendant could rebut this presumption by showing\n  that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock\n  price—that is, that it had no “price impact.”\n     Respondent Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), filed a putative\n  class action against Halliburton and one of its executives (collectively\n  Halliburton), alleging that they made misrepresentations designed to\n  inflate Halliburton’s stock price, in violation of section 10(b) of the\n  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Com-\n  mission Rule 10b–5. The District Court initially denied EPJ Fund’s\n  class certification motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed. But this\n  Court vacated that judgment, concluding that securities fraud plain-\n  tiffs need not prove loss causation—a causal connection between the\n  defendants’ alleged misrepresentations and the plaintiffs’ economic\n  losses—at the class certification stage in order to invoke Basic’s pre-\n  sumption of reliance. On remand, Halliburton argued that class cer-\n  tification was nonetheless inappropriate because the evidence it had\n  earlier introduced to disprove loss causation also showed that its al-\n  leged misrepresentations had not affected its stock price. By demon-\n  strating the absence of any “price impact,” Halliburton contended, it\n2         HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    had rebutted the Basic presumption. And without the benefit of that\n    presumption, investors would have to prove reliance on an individual\n    basis, meaning that individual issues would predominate over com-\n    mon ones and class certification would be inappropriate under Fed-\n    eral Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). The District Court rejected Hal-\n    liburton’s argument and certified the class. The Fifth Circuit\n    affirmed, concluding that Halliburton could use its price impact evi-\n    dence to rebut the Basic presumption only at trial, not at the class\n    certification stage.\nHeld:\n    1. Halliburton has not shown a “special justification,” Dickerson v.\n United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443, for overruling Basic’s presumption\n of reliance. Pp. 4–16.\n       (a) To recover damages under section 10(b) and Rule 10b–5, a\n plaintiff must prove, as relevant here, “ ‘reliance upon the misrepre-\n sentation or omission.’ ” Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans\n and Trust Funds, 568 U. S. ___, ___. The Court recognized in Basic,\n however, that requiring direct proof of reliance from every individual\n plaintiff “would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary bur-\n den on the . . . plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market,”\n 485 U. S., at 245, and “effectively would” prevent plaintiffs “from pro-\n ceeding with a class action” in Rule 10b–5 suits, id., at 242. To ad-\n dress these concerns, the Court held that plaintiffs could satisfy the\n reliance element of a Rule 10b–5 action by invoking a rebuttable pre-\n sumption of reliance. The Court based that presumption on what is\n known as the “fraud-on-the-market” theory, which holds that “the\n market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all\n publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepre-\n sentations.” Id., at 246. The Court also noted that the typical “inves-\n tor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in\n reliance on the integrity of that price.” Id., at 247. As a result,\n whenever an investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his “re-\n liance on any public material misrepresentations . . . may be pre-\n sumed for purposes of a Rule 10b–5 action.” Id. at 247. Basic also\n emphasized that the presumption of reliance was rebuttable rather\n than conclusive. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) None of Halliburton’s arguments for overruling Basic so dis-\n credit the decision as to constitute a “special justification.” Pp. 7–12.\n         (1) Halliburton first argues that the Basic presumption is in-\n consistent with Congress’s intent in passing the 1934 Exchange Act—\n the same argument made by the dissenting Justices in Basic. The\n Basic majority did not find that argument persuasive then, and Hal-\n liburton has given no new reason to endorse it now. Pp. 7–8.\n         (2) Halliburton also contends that Basic rested on two premis-\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                       3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nes that have been undermined by developments in economic theory.\nFirst, it argues that the Basic Court espoused “a robust view of mar-\nket efficiency” that is no longer tenable in light of empirical evidence\nostensibly showing that material, public information often is not\nquickly incorporated into stock prices. The Court in Basic acknowl-\nedged, however, the debate among economists about the efficiency of\ncapital markets and refused to endorse “any particular theory of how\nquickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in\nmarket price.” 485 U. S., at 248, n. 28. The Court instead based the\npresumption of reliance on the fairly modest premise that “market\nprofessionals generally consider most publicly announced material\nstatements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.”\nId., at 247, n. 24. Moreover, in making the presumption rebuttable,\nBasic recognized that market efficiency is a matter of degree and ac-\ncordingly made it a matter of proof. Halliburton has not identified\nthe kind of fundamental shift in economic theory that could justify\noverruling a precedent on the ground that it misunderstood, or has\nsince been overtaken by, economic realities.\n   Halliburton also contests the premise that investors “invest ‘in re-\nliance on the integrity of [the market] price,’ ” id., at 247, identifying\na number of classes of investors for whom “price integrity” is suppos-\nedly “marginal or irrelevant.” But Basic never denied the existence\nof such investors, who in any event rely at least on the facts that\nmarket prices will incorporate public information within a reasonable\nperiod and that market prices, however inaccurate, are not distorted\nby fraud. Pp. 8–12.\n     (c) The principle of stare decisis has “ ‘special force’ ” “in respect\nto statutory interpretation” because “ ‘Congress remains free to alter\nwhat [the Court has] done.’ ” John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 130, 139. So too with Basic’s presumption of reli-\nance. The presumption is not inconsistent with this Court’s more re-\ncent decisions construing the Rule 10b–5 cause of action. In Central\nBank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511\nU. S. 164, and Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-\nAtlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, the Court declined to effectively elimi-\nnate the reliance element by extending liability to entirely new cate-\ngories of defendants who themselves had not made any material,\npublic misrepresentation. The Basic presumption, by contrast, mere-\nly provides an alternative means of satisfying the reliance element.\nNor is the Basic presumption inconsistent with the Court’s recent de-\ncisions governing class action certification, which require plaintiffs to\nprove—not simply plead—that their proposed class satisfies each re-\nquirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, including, if appli-\ncable, the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). See, e.g., Wal-\n4         HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___. The Basic presumption\n    does not relieve plaintiffs of that burden but rather sets forth what\n    plaintiffs must prove to demonstrate predominance. Finally, Halli-\n    burton emphasizes the possible harmful consequences of the securi-\n    ties class actions facilitated by the Basic presumption, but such con-\n    cerns are more appropriately addressed to Congress, which has in\n    fact responded, to some extent, to many of them. Pp. 12–16.\n       2. For the same reasons the Court declines to overrule Basic’s pre-\n    sumption of reliance, it also declines to modify the prerequisites for\n    invoking the presumption by requiring plaintiffs to prove “price im-\n    pact” directly at the class certification stage. The Basic presumption\n    incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff shows\n    that the defendant’s misrepresentation was public and material and\n    that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, he is entitled to\n    a presumption that the misrepresentation affected the stock price.\n    Second, if the plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the\n    market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further\n    presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defend-\n    ant’s misrepresentation. Requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact\n    directly would take away the first constituent presumption. Halli-\n    burton’s argument for doing so is the same as its argument for over-\n    ruling the Basic presumption altogether, and it meets the same fate.\n    Pp. 16–18.\n       3. The Court agrees with Halliburton, however, that defendants\n    must be afforded an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reliance\n    before class certification with evidence of a lack of price impact. De-\n    fendants may already introduce such evidence at the merits stage to\n    rebut the Basic presumption, as well as at the class certification\n    stage to counter a plaintiff’s showing of market efficiency. Forbid-\n    ding defendants to rely on the same evidence prior to class certifica-\n    tion for the particular purpose of rebutting the presumption altogeth-\n    er makes no sense, and can readily lead to results that are\n    inconsistent with Basic’s own logic. Basic allows plaintiffs to estab-\n    lish price impact indirectly, by showing that a stock traded in an effi-\n    cient market and that a defendant’s misrepresentations were public\n    and material. But an indirect proxy should not preclude considera-\n    tion of a defendant’s direct, more salient evidence showing that an al-\n    leged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock’s price and,\n    consequently, that the Basic presumption does not apply. Amgen\n    does not require a different result. There, the Court held that mate-\n    riality, though a prerequisite for invoking the Basic presumption,\n    should be left to the merits stage because it does not bear on the pre-\n    dominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). In contrast, the fact that a\n    misrepresentation has price impact is “Basic’s fundamental premise.”\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

It\n  thus has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class\n  certification stage. That is why, if reliance is to be shown through\n  the Basic presumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequi-\n  sites must be proved before class certification. Given that such indi-\n  rect evidence of price impact will be before the court at the class certi-\n  fication stage in any event, there is no reason to artificially limit the\n  inquiry at that stage by excluding direct evidence of price impact.\n  Pp. 18–23.\n718 F. 3d 423, vacated and remanded.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the\nlead plaintiff in a putative class action against Halliburton\nand one of its executives (collectively Halliburton) alleging\nviolations of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b), and Securities\nand Exchange Commission Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5\n(2013). According to EPJ Fund, between June 3, 1999,\nand December 7, 2001, Halliburton made a series of mis-\nrepresentations regarding its potential liability in asbestos\nlitigation, its expected revenue from certain construction\ncontracts, and the anticipated benefits of its merger with\nanother company—all in an attempt to inflate the price of\nits stock. Halliburton subsequently made a number of\ncorrective disclosures, which, EPJ Fund contends, caused\nthe company’s stock price to drop and investors to lose\nmoney.\n   EPJ Fund moved to certify a class comprising all inves-\ntors who purchased Halliburton common stock during the\nclass period. The District Court found that the proposed\nclass satisfied all the threshold requirements of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(a): It was sufficiently numer-\nous, there were common questions of law or fact, the rep-\nresentative parties’ claims were typical of the class claims,\nand the representatives could fairly and adequately pro-\ntect the interests of the class. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a.\nAnd except for one difficulty, the court would have also\nconcluded that the class satisfied the requirement of Rule\n23(b)(3) that “the questions of law or fact common to class\nmembers predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members.” See id., at 55a, 98a. The difficulty\nwas that Circuit precedent required securities fraud plain-\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Because EPJ Fund\nhad not demonstrated such a connection for any of Halli-\nburton’s alleged misrepresentations, the District Court\nrefused to certify the proposed class. Id., at 55a, 98a. The\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit af-\nfirmed the denial of class certification on the same ground.\nArchdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting Fund, Inc. v. Halli-\nburton Co., 597 F. 3d 330 (2010).\n   We granted certiorari and vacated the judgment, finding\nnothing in “Basic or its logic” to justify the Fifth Circuit’s\nrequirement that securities fraud plaintiffs prove loss\ncausation at the class certification stage in order to invoke\nBasic’s presumption of reliance. Erica P. John Fund, Inc.\nv. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (Halliburton\nI ) (slip op., at 6). “Loss causation,” we explained, “ad-\ndresses a matter different from whether an investor relied\non a misrepresentation, presumptively or otherwise, when\nbuying or selling a stock.” Ibid. We remanded the case for\nthe lower courts to consider “any further arguments\nagainst class certification” that Halliburton had preserved.\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n   On remand, Halliburton argued that class certification\nwas inappropriate because the evidence it had earlier\nintroduced to disprove loss causation also showed that\nnone of its alleged misrepresentations had actually af-\nfected its stock price. By demonstrating the absence of any\n“price impact,” Halliburton contended, it had rebutted\nBasic’s presumption that the members of the proposed\nclass had relied on its alleged misrepresentations simply\nby buying or selling its stock at the market price. And\nwithout the benefit of the Basic presumption, investors\nwould have to prove reliance on an individual basis, mean-\n4      HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning that individual issues would predominate over com-\nmon ones. The District Court declined to consider Halli-\nburton’s argument, holding that the Basic presumption\napplied and certifying the class under Rule 23(b)(3). App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 30a.\n   The Fifth Circuit affirmed. 718 F. 3d 423 (2013). The\ncourt found that Halliburton had preserved its price im-\npact argument, but to no avail. Id., at 435–436. While\nacknowledging that “Halliburton’s price impact evidence\ncould be used at the trial on the merits to refute the pre-\nsumption of reliance,” id., at 433, the court held that\nHalliburton could not use such evidence for that purpose\nat the class certification stage, id., at 435. “[P]rice impact\nevidence,” the court explained, “does not bear on the ques-\ntion of common question predominance [under Rule\n23(b)(3)], and is thus appropriately considered only on the\nmerits after the class has been certified.” Ibid.\n   We once again granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013),\nthis time to resolve a conflict among the Circuits over\nwhether securities fraud defendants may attempt to rebut\nthe Basic presumption at the class certification stage with\nevidence of a lack of price impact. We also accepted Halli-\nburton’s invitation to reconsider the presumption of reli-\nance for securities fraud claims that we adopted in Basic.\n                              II\n   Halliburton urges us to overrule Basic’s presumption of\nreliance and to instead require every securities fraud\nplaintiff to prove that he actually relied on the defendant’s\nmisrepresentation in deciding to buy or sell a company’s\nstock. Before overturning a long-settled precedent, how-\never, we require “special justification,” not just an argu-\nment that the precedent was wrongly decided. Dickerson\nv. United States, 530 U.

See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor\nDrug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 730 (1975). To recover damages\nfor violations of section 10(b) and Rule 10b–5, a plaintiff\nmust prove “ ‘(1) a material misrepresentation or omission\nby the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the\nmisrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of\na security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or\nomission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.’ ”\nAmgen Inc. v.

S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 9)).\n   The reliance element “ ‘ensures that there is a proper\nconnection between a defendant’s misrepresentation and a\nplaintiff ’s injury.’ ” 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quot-\ning Halliburton I, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)). “The\ntraditional (and most direct) way a plaintiff can demon-\nstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware of a com-\npany’s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction—\ne.g., purchasing common stock—based on that specific\nmisrepresentation.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   In Basic, however, we recognized that requiring such\ndirect proof of reliance “would place an unnecessarily\nunrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 10b–5 plaintiff\nwho has traded on an impersonal market.” 485 U. S., at\n245. That is because, even assuming an investor could\nprove that he was aware of the misrepresentation, he\nwould still have to “show a speculative state of facts, i.e.,\n6      HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhow he would have acted . . . if the misrepresentation had\nnot been made.” Ibid.\n   We also noted that “[r]equiring proof of individualized\nreliance” from every securities fraud plaintiff “effectively\nwould . . . prevent[ ] [plaintiffs] from proceeding with a\nclass action” in Rule 10b–5 suits. Id., at 242. If every\nplaintiff had to prove direct reliance on the defendant’s\nmisrepresentation, “individual issues then would . . .\noverwhelm[ ] the common ones,” making certification\nunder Rule 23(b)(3) inappropriate. Ibid.\n   To address these concerns, Basic held that securities\nfraud plaintiffs can in certain circumstances satisfy the\nreliance element of a Rule 10b–5 action by invoking a\nrebuttable presumption of reliance, rather than proving\ndirect reliance on a misrepresentation. The Court based\nthat presumption on what is known as the “fraud-on-the-\nmarket” theory, which holds that “the market price of\nshares traded on well-developed markets reflects all pub-\nlicly available information, and, hence, any material mis-\nrepresentations.” Id., at 246. The Court also noted that,\nrather than scrutinize every piece of public information\nabout a company for himself, the typical “investor who\nbuys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in\nreliance on the integrity of that price”—the belief that it\nreflects all public, material information. Id., at 247. As a\nresult, whenever the investor buys or sells stock at the\nmarket price, his “reliance on any public material misrep-\nresentations . . . may be presumed for purposes of a Rule\n10b–5 action.” Ibid.\n   Based on this theory, a plaintiff must make the follow-\ning showings to demonstrate that the presumption of\nreliance applies in a given case: (1) that the alleged mis-\nrepresentations were publicly known, (2) that they were\nmaterial, (3) that the stock traded in an efficient market,\nand (4) that the plaintiff traded the stock between the\ntime the misrepresentations were made and when the\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntruth was revealed. See id., at 248, n. 27; Halliburton I,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 5–6).\n   At the same time, Basic emphasized that the presump-\ntion of reliance was rebuttable rather than conclusive.\nSpecifically, “[a]ny showing that severs the link between\nthe alleged misrepresentation and either the price re-\nceived (or paid) by the plaintiff, or his decision to trade at\na fair market price, will be sufficient to rebut the pre-\nsumption of reliance.” 485 U. S., at 248. So for example, if\na defendant could show that the alleged misrepresentation\ndid not, for whatever reason, actually affect the market\nprice, or that a plaintiff would have bought or sold the\nstock even had he been aware that the stock’s price was\ntainted by fraud, then the presumption of reliance would\nnot apply. Id., at 248–249. In either of those cases, a\nplaintiff would have to prove that he directly relied on the\ndefendant’s misrepresentation in buying or selling the\nstock.\n                              B\n   Halliburton contends that securities fraud plaintiffs\nshould always have to prove direct reliance and that the\nBasic Court erred in allowing them to invoke a presump-\ntion of reliance instead. According to Halliburton, the\nBasic presumption contravenes congressional intent and\nhas been undermined by subsequent developments in\neconomic theory. Neither argument, however, so discred-\nits Basic as to constitute “special justification” for overrul-\ning the decision.\n                             1\n   Halliburton first argues that the Basic presumption is\ninconsistent with Congress’s intent in passing the 1934\nExchange Act. Because “[t]he Section 10(b) action is a\n‘judicial construct that Congress did not enact,’ ” this\nCourt, Halliburton insists, “must identify—and borrow\n8      HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom—the express provision that is ‘most analogous to the\nprivate 10b–5 right of action.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 12\n(quoting Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-\nAtlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 164 (2008); Musick, Peeler\n& Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 294\n(1993)). According to Halliburton, the closest analogue\nto section 10(b) is section 18(a) of the Act, which cre-\nates an express private cause of action allowing inves-\ntors to recover damages based on misrepresentations\nmade in certain regulatory filings. 15 U. S. C. §78r(a).\nThat provision requires an investor to prove that he\nbought or sold stock “in reliance upon” the defendant’s\nmisrepresentation. Ibid. In ignoring this direct reliance\nrequirement, the argument goes, the Basic Court relieved\nRule 10b–5 plaintiffs of a burden that Congress would\nhave imposed had it created the cause of action.\n  EPJ Fund contests both premises of Halliburton’s ar-\ngument, arguing that Congress has affirmed Basic’s con-\nstruction of section 10(b) and that, in any event, the clos-\nest analogue to section 10(b) is not section 18(a) but\nsection 9, 15 U. S. C. §78i—a provision that does not re-\nquire actual reliance.\n  We need not settle this dispute. In Basic, the dissenting\nJustices made the same argument based on section 18(a)\nthat Halliburton presses here. See 485 U. S., at 257–258\n(White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The\nBasic majority did not find that argument persuasive\nthen, and Halliburton has given us no new reason to\nendorse it now.\n                              2\n  Halliburton’s primary argument for overruling Basic is\nthat the decision rested on two premises that can no longer\nwithstand scrutiny. The first premise concerns what is\nknown as the “efficient capital markets hypothesis.” Basic\nstated that “the market price of shares traded on well-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeveloped markets reflects all publicly available infor-\nmation, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.”\nId., at 246. From that statement, Halliburton concludes\nthat the Basic Court espoused “a robust view of market\nefficiency” that is no longer tenable, for “ ‘overwhelming\nempirical evidence’ now ‘suggests that capital markets are\nnot fundamentally efficient.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 14–16\n(quoting Lev & de Villiers, Stock Price Crashes and 10b–5\nDamages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis, 47\nStan. L. Rev 7, 20 (1994)). To support this contention,\nHalliburton cites studies purporting to show that “public\ninformation is often not incorporated immediately (much\nless rationally) into market prices.” Brief for Petitioners\n17; see id., at 16–20. See also Brief for Law Professors as\nAmici Curiae 15–18.\n   Halliburton does not, of course, maintain that capital\nmarkets are always inefficient. Rather, in its view, Basic’s\nfundamental error was to ignore the fact that “ ‘efficiency\nis not a binary, yes or no question.’ ” Brief for Petitioners\n20 (quoting Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking\nFraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 167)). The\nmarkets for some securities are more efficient than the\nmarkets for others, and even a single market can process\ndifferent kinds of information more or less efficiently,\ndepending on how widely the information is disseminated\nand how easily it is understood. Brief for Petitioners at\n20–21. Yet Basic, Halliburton asserts, glossed over these\nnuances, assuming a false dichotomy that renders the\npresumption of reliance both underinclusive and overin-\nclusive: A misrepresentation can distort a stock’s market\nprice even in a generally inefficient market, and a misrep-\nresentation can leave a stock’s market price unaffected\neven in a generally efficient one. Brief for Petitioners at\n21.\n   Halliburton’s criticisms fail to take Basic on its own\nterms. Halliburton focuses on the debate among econo-\n10     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmists about the degree to which the market price of a\ncompany’s stock reflects public information about the\ncompany—and thus the degree to which an investor can\nearn an abnormal, above-market return by trading on\nsuch information. See Brief for Financial Economists as\nAmici Curiae 4–10 (describing the debate). That debate is\nnot new. Indeed, the Basic Court acknowledged it and\ndeclined to enter the fray, declaring that “[w]e need not\ndetermine by adjudication what economists and social\nscientists have debated through the use of sophisticated\nstatistical analysis and the application of economic the-\nory.” 485 U. S., at 246–247, n. 24. To recognize the pre-\nsumption of reliance, the Court explained, was not “con-\nclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly and\ncompletely publicly available information is reflected in\nmarket price.” Id., at 248, n. 28. The Court instead based\nthe presumption on the fairly modest premise that “mar-\nket professionals generally consider most publicly an-\nnounced material statements about companies, thereby\naffecting stock market prices.” Id., at 247, n. 24. Basic’s\npresumption of reliance thus does not rest on a “binary”\nview of market efficiency. Indeed, in making the pre-\nsumption rebuttable, Basic recognized that market effi-\nciency is a matter of degree and accordingly made it a\nmatter of proof.\n  The academic debates discussed by Halliburton have not\nrefuted the modest premise underlying the presumption of\nreliance. Even the foremost critics of the efficient-capital-\nmarkets hypothesis acknowledge that public information\ngenerally affects stock prices. See, e.g., Shiller, We’ll\nShare the Honors, and Agree to Disagree, N. Y. Times,\nOct. 27, 2013, p. BU6 (“Of course, prices reflect available\ninformation”). Halliburton also conceded as much in its\nreply brief and at oral argument. See Reply Brief 13\n(“market prices generally respond to new, material infor-\nmation”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Debates about the precise\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Wendt,\n618 F. 3d 679, 685 (CA7 2010) (Easterbrook, C. J.). Even\nthough the efficient capital markets hypothesis may have\n“garnered substantial criticism since Basic,” post, at 6\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), Halliburton has not\nidentified the kind of fundamental shift in economic the-\nory that could justify overruling a precedent on the ground\nthat it misunderstood, or has since been overtaken by,\neconomic realities. Contrast State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522\nU. S. 3 (1997), unanimously overruling Albrecht v. Herald\nCo., 390 U. S. 145 (1968).\n   Halliburton also contests a second premise underlying\nthe Basic presumption: the notion that investors “invest\n‘in reliance on the integrity of [the market] price.’ ” Reply\nBrief 14 (quoting 485 U. S., at 247; alteration in original).\nHalliburton identifies a number of classes of investors for\nwhom “price integrity” is supposedly “marginal or irrele-\nvant.” Reply Brief 14. The primary example is the value\ninvestor, who believes that certain stocks are undervalued\nor overvalued and attempts to “beat the market” by buying\nthe undervalued stocks and selling the overvalued ones.\nBrief for Petitioners 15–16 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). See also Brief for Vivendi S. A. as Amicus Curiae\n3–10 (describing the investment strategies of day trad-\ners, volatility arbitragers, and value investors). If many\ninvestors “are indifferent to prices,” Halliburton contends,\nthen courts should not presume that investors rely on the\nintegrity of those prices and any misrepresentations in-\ncorporated into them. Reply Brief 14.\n   But Basic never denied the existence of such investors.\nAs we recently explained, Basic concluded only that “it is\nreasonable to presume that most investors—knowing that\n12     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthey have little hope of outperforming the market in the\nlong run based solely on their analysis of publicly availa-\nble information—will rely on the security’s market price as\nan unbiased assessment of the security’s value in light of\nall public information.” Amgen, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 5) (emphasis added).\n   In any event, there is no reason to suppose that even\nHalliburton’s main counterexample—the value investor—\nis as indifferent to the integrity of market prices as Halli-\nburton suggests. Such an investor implicitly relies on the\nfact that a stock’s market price will eventually reflect\nmaterial information—how else could the market correc-\ntion on which his profit depends occur? To be sure, the\nvalue investor “does not believe that the market price\naccurately reflects public information at the time he trans-\nacts.” Post, at 11. But to indirectly rely on a misstate-\nment in the sense relevant for the Basic presumption, he\nneed only trade stock based on the belief that the market\nprice will incorporate public information within a reason-\nable period. The value investor also presumably tries to\nestimate how undervalued or overvalued a particular\nstock is, and such estimates can be skewed by a market\nprice tainted by fraud.\n                               C\n  The principle of stare decisis has “ ‘special force’ ” “in\nrespect to statutory interpretation” because “ ‘Congress\nremains free to alter what we have done.’ ” John R. Sand\n& Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 139 (2008)\n(quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,\n172–173 (1989)). So too with Basic’s presumption of reli-\nance. Although the presumption is a judicially created\ndoctrine designed to implement a judicially created cause\nof action, we have described the presumption as “a sub-\nstantive doctrine of federal securities-fraud law.” Amgen,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). That is because it provides a\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nway of satisfying the reliance element of the Rule 10b–5\ncause of action. See, e.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.\nBroudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341–342 (2005). As with any other\nelement of that cause of action, Congress may overturn\nor modify any aspect of our interpretations of the reli-\nance requirement, including the Basic presumption it-\nself. Given that possibility, we see no reason to exempt\nthe Basic presumption from ordinary principles of stare\ndecisis.\n   To buttress its case for overruling Basic, Halliburton\ncontends that, in addition to being wrongly decided, the\ndecision is inconsistent with our more recent decisions\nconstruing the Rule 10b–5 cause of action. As Halliburton\nnotes, we have held that “we must give ‘narrow dimen-\nsions . . . to a right of action Congress did not authorize\nwhen it first enacted the statute and did not expand when\nit revisited the law.’ ” Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First\nDerivative Traders, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 167); see, e.g., Central\nBank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver,\nN. A., 511 U. S. 164 (1994) (refusing to recognize aiding-\nand-abetting liability under the Rule 10b–5 cause of ac-\ntion); Stoneridge, supra (refusing to extend Rule 10b–5\nliability to certain secondary actors who did not them-\nselves make material misstatements). Yet the Basic\npresumption, Halliburton asserts, does just the opposite,\nexpanding the Rule 10b–5 cause of action. Brief for Peti-\ntioners 27–29.\n   Not so. In Central Bank and Stoneridge, we declined to\nextend Rule 10b–5 liability to entirely new categories of\ndefendants who themselves had not made any material,\npublic misrepresentation. Such an extension, we ex-\nplained, would have eviscerated the requirement that a\nplaintiff prove that he relied on a misrepresentation made\nby the defendant. See Central Bank, supra, at 180; Stone-\nridge, supra, at 157, 159. The Basic presumption does\n14     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot eliminate that requirement but rather provides an\nalternative means of satisfying it. While the presumption\nmakes it easier for plaintiffs to prove reliance, it does not\nalter the elements of the Rule 10b–5 cause of action and\nthus maintains the action’s original legal scope.\n   Halliburton also argues that the Basic presumption\ncannot be reconciled with our recent decisions governing\nclass action certification under Federal Rule of Civil Pro-\ncedure 23. Those decisions have made clear that plaintiffs\nwishing to proceed through a class action must actually\nprove—not simply plead—that their proposed class satis-\nfies each requirement of Rule 23, including (if applicable)\nthe predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). See Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 10); Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 5–6). According to Halliburton, Basic\nrelieves Rule 10b–5 plaintiffs of that burden, allowing\ncourts to presume that common issues of reliance predom-\ninate over individual ones.\n   That is not the effect of the Basic presumption. In\nsecurities class action cases, the crucial requirement for\nclass certification will usually be the predominance re-\nquirement of Rule 23(b)(3). The Basic presumption does\nnot relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving—before class\ncertification—that this requirement is met. Basic instead\nestablishes that a plaintiff satisfies that burden by prov-\ning the prerequisites for invoking the presumption—\nnamely, publicity, materiality, market efficiency, and\nmarket timing. The burden of proving those prerequisites\nstill rests with plaintiffs and (with the exception of mate-\nriality) must be satisfied before class certification. Basic\ndoes not, in other words, allow plaintiffs simply to plead\nthat common questions of reliance predominate over indi-\nvidual ones, but rather sets forth what they must prove to\ndemonstrate such predominance.\n   Basic does afford defendants an opportunity to rebut the\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npresumption of reliance with respect to an individual\nplaintiff by showing that he did not rely on the integrity of\nthe market price in trading stock. While this has the\neffect of “leav[ing] individualized questions of reliance in\nthe case,” post, at 12, there is no reason to think that these\nquestions will overwhelm common ones and render class\ncertification inappropriate under Rule 23(b)(3). That the\ndefendant might attempt to pick off the occasional class\nmember here or there through individualized rebuttal\ndoes not cause individual questions to predominate.\n   Finally, Halliburton and its amici contend that, by\nfacilitating securities class actions, the Basic presumption\nproduces a number of serious and harmful consequences.\nSuch class actions, they say, allow plaintiffs to extort large\nsettlements from defendants for meritless claims; punish\ninnocent shareholders, who end up having to pay settle-\nments and judgments; impose excessive costs on businesses;\nand consume a disproportionately large share of judicial\nresources. Brief for Petitioners 39–45.\n   These concerns are more appropriately addressed to\nCongress, which has in fact responded, to some extent, to\nmany of the issues raised by Halliburton and its amici.\nCongress has, for example, enacted the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737,\nwhich sought to combat perceived abuses in securities\nlitigation with heightened pleading requirements, limits\non damages and attorney’s fees, a “safe harbor” for certain\nkinds of statements, restrictions on the selection of lead\nplaintiffs in securities class actions, sanctions for frivolous\nlitigation, and stays of discovery pending motions to dis-\nmiss. See Amgen, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20).\nAnd to prevent plaintiffs from circumventing these re-\nstrictions by bringing securities class actions under state\nlaw in state court, Congress also enacted the Securities\nLitigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3227,\nwhich precludes many state law class actions alleging\n16     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsecurities fraud. See Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20).\nSuch legislation demonstrates Congress’s willingness to\nconsider policy concerns of the sort that Halliburton says\nshould lead us to overrule Basic.\n                             III\n   Halliburton proposes two alternatives to overruling\nBasic that would alleviate what it regards as the decision’s\nmost serious flaws. The first alternative would require\nplaintiffs to prove that a defendant’s misrepresentation\nactually affected the stock price—so-called “price im-\npact”—in order to invoke the Basic presumption. It should\nnot be enough, Halliburton contends, for plaintiffs to\ndemonstrate the general efficiency of the market in which\nthe stock traded. Halliburton’s second proposed alterna-\ntive would allow defendants to rebut the presumption of\nreliance with evidence of a lack of price impact, not only at\nthe merits stage—which all agree defendants may already\ndo—but also before class certification.\n                             A\n   As noted, to invoke the Basic presumption, a plaintiff\nmust prove that: (1) the alleged misrepresentations were\npublicly known, (2) they were material, (3) the stock traded\nin an efficient market, and (4) the plaintiff traded the\nstock between when the misrepresentations were made\nand when the truth was revealed. See Basic, 485 U. S., at\n248, n. 27; Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15). Each of\nthese requirements follows from the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory underlying the presumption. If the misrepresenta-\ntion was not publicly known, then it could not have dis-\ntorted the stock’s market price. So too if the misrepresen-\ntation was immaterial—that is, if it would not have “ ‘been\nviewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly\naltered the “total mix” of information made available,’ ”\nBasic, supra, at 231–232 (quoting TSC Industries, Inc. v.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nNorthway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 449 (1976))—or if the mar-\nket in which the stock traded was inefficient. And if the\nplaintiff did not buy or sell the stock after the misrepre-\nsentation was made but before the truth was revealed,\nthen he could not be said to have acted in reliance on a\nfraud-tainted price.\n   The first three prerequisites are directed at price im-\npact—“whether the alleged misrepresentations affected\nthe market price in the first place.” Halliburton I, 563\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). In the absence of price impact,\nBasic’s fraud-on-the-market theory and presumption of\nreliance collapse. The “fundamental premise” underlying\nthe presumption is “that an investor presumptively relies\non a misrepresentation so long as it was reflected in the\nmarket price at the time of his transaction.” 563 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 7). If it was not, then there is “no ground-\ning for any contention that [the] investor[ ] indirectly\nrelied on th[at] misrepresentation[ ] through [his] reliance\non the integrity of the market price.” Amgen, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 17).\n   Halliburton argues that since the Basic presumption\nhinges on price impact, plaintiffs should be required to\nprove it directly in order to invoke the presumption.\nProving the presumption’s prerequisites, which are at best\nan imperfect proxy for price impact, should not suffice.\n   Far from a modest refinement of the Basic presumption,\nthis proposal would radically alter the required showing\nfor the reliance element of the Rule 10b–5 cause of action.\nWhat is called the Basic presumption actually incorpo-\nrates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff\nshows that the defendant’s misrepresentation was public\nand material and that the stock traded in a generally\nefficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the\nmisrepresentation affected the stock price. Second, if the\nplaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the\nmarket price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a\n18     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfurther presumption that he purchased the stock in reli-\nance on the defendant’s misrepresentation.\n  By requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly,\nHalliburton’s proposal would take away the first constitu-\nent presumption. Halliburton’s argument for doing so is\nthe same as its primary argument for overruling the Basic\npresumption altogether: Because market efficiency is not a\nyes-or-no proposition, a public, material misrepresentation\nmight not affect a stock’s price even in a generally efficient\nmarket. But as explained, Basic never suggested other-\nwise; that is why it affords defendants an opportunity to\nrebut the presumption by showing, among other things,\nthat the particular misrepresentation at issue did not\naffect the stock’s market price. For the same reasons we\ndeclined to completely jettison the Basic presumption, we\ndecline to effectively jettison half of it by revising the\nprerequisites for invoking it.\n                             B\n  Even if plaintiffs need not directly prove price impact to\ninvoke the Basic presumption, Halliburton contends that\ndefendants should at least be allowed to defeat the pre-\nsumption at the class certification stage through evidence\nthat the misrepresentation did not in fact affect the stock\nprice. We agree.\n                              1\n   There is no dispute that defendants may introduce such\nevidence at the merits stage to rebut the Basic presump-\ntion. Basic itself “made clear that the presumption was\njust that, and could be rebutted by appropriate evidence,”\nincluding evidence that the asserted misrepresentation (or\nits correction) did not affect the market price of the de-\nfendant’s stock. Halliburton I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n5); see Basic, supra, at 248.\n   Nor is there any dispute that defendants may introduce\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprice impact evidence at the class certification stage, so\nlong as it is for the purpose of countering a plaintiff’s\nshowing of market efficiency, rather than directly rebut-\nting the presumption. As EPJ Fund acknowledges, “[o]f\ncourse . . . defendants can introduce evidence at class\ncertification of lack of price impact as some evidence that\nthe market is not efficient.” Brief for Respondent 53. See\nalso Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26.\n   After all, plaintiffs themselves can and do introduce\nevidence of the existence of price impact in connection with\n“event studies”—regression analyses that seek to show\nthat the market price of the defendant’s stock tends to\nrespond to pertinent publicly reported events. See Brief\nfor Law Professors as Amici Curiae 25–28. In this case,\nfor example, EPJ Fund submitted an event study of vari-\nous episodes that might have been expected to affect the\nprice of Halliburton’s stock, in order to demonstrate that\nthe market for that stock takes account of material, public\ninformation about the company. See App. 217–230 (de-\nscribing the results of the study). The episodes examined\nby EPJ Fund’s event study included one of the alleged\nmisrepresentations that form the basis of the Fund’s suit.\nSee id., at 230, 343–344. See also In re Xcelera.com Secu-\nrities Litigation, 430 F. 3d 503, 513 (CA1 2005) (event\nstudy included effect of misrepresentation challenged in\nthe case).\n   Defendants—like plaintiffs—may accordingly submit\nprice impact evidence prior to class certification. What\ndefendants may not do, EPJ Fund insists and the Court of\nAppeals held, is rely on that same evidence prior to class\ncertification for the particular purpose of rebutting the\npresumption altogether.\n   This restriction makes no sense, and can readily lead to\nbizarre results. Suppose a defendant at the certification\nstage submits an event study looking at the impact on the\nprice of its stock from six discrete events, in an effort to\n20     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrefute the plaintiffs’ claim of general market efficiency.\nAll agree the defendant may do this. Suppose one of the\nsix events is the specific misrepresentation asserted by the\nplaintiffs. All agree that this too is perfectly acceptable.\nNow suppose the district court determines that, despite\nthe defendant’s study, the plaintiff has carried its burden\nto prove market efficiency, but that the evidence shows no\nprice impact with respect to the specific misrepresentation\nchallenged in the suit. The evidence at the certification\nstage thus shows an efficient market, on which the alleged\nmisrepresentation had no price impact. And yet under\nEPJ Fund’s view, the plaintiffs’ action should be certified\nand proceed as a class action (with all that entails), even\nthough the fraud-on-the-market theory does not apply and\ncommon reliance thus cannot be presumed.\n  Such a result is inconsistent with Basic’s own logic.\nUnder Basic’s fraud-on-the-market theory, market effi-\nciency and the other prerequisites for invoking the pre-\nsumption constitute an indirect way of showing price\nimpact. As explained, it is appropriate to allow plaintiffs\nto rely on this indirect proxy for price impact, rather than\nrequiring them to prove price impact directly, given\nBasic’s rationales for recognizing a presumption of reli-\nance in the first place. See supra, at 6–7, 16–17.\n  But an indirect proxy should not preclude direct evi-\ndence when such evidence is available. As we explained in\nBasic, “[a]ny showing that severs the link between the\nalleged misrepresentation and . . . the price received (or\npaid) by the plaintiff . . . will be sufficient to rebut the\npresumption of reliance” because “the basis for finding\nthat the fraud had been transmitted through market price\nwould be gone.” 485 U. S., at 248. And without the pre-\nsumption of reliance, a Rule 10b–5 suit cannot proceed as\na class action: Each plaintiff would have to prove reliance\nindividually, so common issues would not “predominate”\nover individual ones, as required by Rule 23(b)(3). Id., at\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n242. Price impact is thus an essential precondition for any\nRule 10b–5 class action. While Basic allows plaintiffs to\nestablish that precondition indirectly, it does not require\ncourts to ignore a defendant’s direct, more salient evidence\nshowing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually\naffect the stock’s market price and, consequently, that\nthe Basic presumption does not apply.\n                                2\n   The Court of Appeals relied on our decision in Amgen in\nholding that Halliburton could not introduce evidence of\nlack of price impact at the class certification stage. The\nquestion in Amgen was whether plaintiffs could be re-\nquired to prove (or defendants be permitted to disprove)\nmateriality before class certification. Even though mate-\nriality is a prerequisite for invoking the Basic presump-\ntion, we held that it should be left to the merits stage,\nbecause it does not bear on the predominance requirement\nof Rule 23(b)(3). We reasoned that materiality is an objec-\ntive issue susceptible to common, classwide proof. 568\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). We also noted that a failure\nto prove materiality would necessarily defeat every plain-\ntiff ’s claim on the merits; it would not simply preclude\ninvocation of the presumption and thereby cause individual\nquestions of reliance to predominate over common ones.\nIbid. See also id., at ___ (slip op., at 17–18). In this latter\nrespect, we explained, materiality differs from the publicity\nand market efficiency prerequisites, neither of which is\nnecessary to prove a Rule 10b–5 claim on the merits. Id.,\nat ___–___ (slip op., at 16–18).\n   EPJ Fund argues that much of the foregoing could be\nsaid of price impact as well. Fair enough. But price im-\npact differs from materiality in a crucial respect. Given\nthat the other Basic prerequisites must still be proved at\nthe class certification stage, the common issue of material-\nity can be left to the merits stage without risking the\n22     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncertification of classes in which individual issues will end\nup overwhelming common ones. And because materiality\nis a discrete issue that can be resolved in isolation from\nthe other prerequisites, it can be wholly confined to the\nmerits stage.\n   Price impact is different. The fact that a misrepresenta-\ntion “was reflected in the market price at the time of [the]\ntransaction”—that it had price impact—is “Basic’s funda-\nmental premise.” Halliburton I, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7). It thus has everything to do with the issue of pre-\ndominance at the class certification stage. That is why, if\nreliance is to be shown through the Basic presumption,\nthe publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be\nproved before class certification. Without proof of those\nprerequisites, the fraud-on-the-market theory underlying\nthe presumption completely collapses, rendering class\ncertification inappropriate.\n   But as explained, publicity and market efficiency are\nnothing more than prerequisites for an indirect showing of\nprice impact. There is no dispute that at least such indi-\nrect proof of price impact “is needed to ensure that the\nquestions of law or fact common to the class will ‘predomi-\nnate.’ ” Amgen, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis\ndeleted); see id., at ___ (slip op., at 16–17). That is so even\nthough such proof is also highly relevant at the merits\nstage.\n   Our choice in this case, then, is not between allowing\nprice impact evidence at the class certification stage or\nrelegating it to the merits. Evidence of price impact will\nbe before the court at the certification stage in any event.\nThe choice, rather, is between limiting the price impact\ninquiry before class certification to indirect evidence, or\nallowing consideration of direct evidence as well. As\nexplained, we see no reason to artificially limit the inquiry\nat the certification stage to indirect evidence of price\nimpact.

We adhere to that\ndecision and decline to modify the prerequisites for invok-\ning the presumption of reliance.

Basic presented the ques­\ntion how investors must prove the reliance element of the\nimplied Rule 10b–5 cause of action—the requirement that\nthe plaintiff buy or sell stock in reliance on the defendant’s\nmisstatement—when they transact on modern, impersonal\nsecurities exchanges. Were the Rule 10b–5 action statu-\ntory, the Court could have resolved this question by inter­\npreting the statutory language. Without a statute to\n2          HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninterpret for guidance, however, the Court began instead\nwith a particular policy “problem”: for investors in imper­\nsonal markets, the traditional reliance requirement was\nhard to prove and impossible to prove as common among\nplaintiffs bringing 10b–5 class-action suits. Id., at 242,\n245. With the task thus framed as “resol[ving]” that\n“ ‘problem’ ” rather than interpreting statutory text, id., at\n242, the Court turned to nascent economic theory and\nnaked intuitions about investment behavior in its efforts\nto fashion a new, easier way to meet the reliance require­\nment. The result was an evidentiary presumption, based\non a “fraud on the market” theory, that paved the way for\nclass actions under Rule 10b–5.\n   Today we are asked to determine whether Basic was\ncorrectly decided. The Court suggests that it was, and\nthat stare decisis demands that we preserve it. I disagree.\nLogic, economic realities, and our subsequent jurispru­\ndence have undermined the foundations of the Basic pre­\nsumption, and stare decisis cannot prop up the façade that\nremains. Basic should be overruled.\n                              I\n  Understanding where Basic went wrong requires an\nexplanation of the “reliance” requirement as traditionally\nunderstood.\n  “Reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant’s deceptive\nacts is an essential element” of the implied 10b–5 private\ncause of action.1 Stoneridge, supra, at 159. To prove\n\n——————\n    1 As\n       the private Rule 10b–5 action has evolved, the Court has drawn\non the common-law action of deceit to identify six elements a private\nplaintiff must prove: “ ‘(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by\nthe defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresenta­\ntion or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon\nthe misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss\ncausation.’ ” Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust\nFunds, 568 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2013) (slip op., at 3–4).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nreliance, the plaintiff must show “ ‘transaction causation,’ ”\ni.e., that the specific misstatement induced “the investor’s\ndecision to engage in the transaction.” Erica P. John\nFund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___–___\n(2011) (slip op., at 6–7). Such proof “ensures that there is\na proper ‘connection between a defendant’s misrepresenta­\ntion and a plaintiff ’s injury’ ”—namely, that the plaintiff\nhas not just lost money as a result of the misstatement,\nbut that he was actually defrauded by it. Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 4); see also Dirks v. SEC, 463 U. S. 646, 666–667, n.\n27 (1983) (“[T]o constitute a violation of Rule 10b–5, there\nmust be fraud. . . . [T]here always are winners and losers;\nbut those who have ‘lost’ have not necessarily been de­\nfrauded”). Without that connection, Rule 10b–5 is reduced\nto a “ ‘scheme of investor’s insurance,’ ” because a plaintiff\ncould recover whenever the defendant’s misstatement\ndistorted the stock price—regardless of whether the mis­\nstatement had actually tricked the plaintiff into buying (or\nselling) the stock in the first place. Dura Pharmaceuti-\ncals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 345 (2005) (quoting\nBasic, supra, at 252 (White, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part)).\n   The “traditional” reliance element requires a plaintiff to\n“sho[w] that he was aware of a company’s statement and\nengaged in a relevant transaction . . . based on that spe-\ncific misrepresentation.” Erica P. John Fund, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 4). But investors who purchase stock from\nthird parties on impersonal exchanges (e.g., the New York\nStock Exchange) often will not be aware of any particular\nstatement made by the issuer of the security, and there­\nfore cannot establish that they transacted based on a\nspecific misrepresentation. Nor is the traditional reliance\nrequirement amenable to class treatment; the inherently\nindividualized nature of the reliance inquiry renders it\nimpossible for a 10b–5 plaintiff to prove that common\nquestions predominate over individual ones, making class\n4       HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncertification improper. See Basic, supra, at 242; Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 23(b)(3).\n    Citing these difficulties of proof and class certification,\n485 U. S., at 242, 245, the Basic Court dispensed with the\ntraditional reliance requirement in favor of a new one\nbased on the fraud-on-the-market theory.2 The new ver­\nsion of reliance had two related parts.\n    First, Basic suggested that plaintiffs could meet the\nreliance requirement “ ‘indirectly,’ ” id., at 245. The Court\nreasoned that “ ‘ideally, [the market] transmits infor­\nmation to the investor in the processed form of a market\nprice.’ ” Id., at 244. An investor could thus be said to have\n“relied” on a specific misstatement if (1) the market had\nincorporated that statement into the market price of the\nsecurity, and (2) the investor then bought or sold that\nsecurity “in reliance on the integrity of the [market] price,”\nid., at 247, i.e., based on his belief that the market price\n“ ‘reflect[ed]’ ” the stock’s underlying “ ‘value,’ ” id., at 244.\n    Second, Basic created a presumption that this “indirect”\nform of “reliance” had been proved. Based primarily on\ncertain assumptions about economic theory and investor\nbehavior, Basic afforded plaintiffs who traded in efficient\nmarkets an evidentiary presumption that both steps of the\nnovel reliance requirement had been satisfied—that (1)\nthe market had incorporated the specific misstatement\ninto the market price of the security, and (2) the plaintiff\n\n——————\n   2 In the years preceding Basic, lower courts and commentators exper­\n\nimented with various ways to facilitate 10b–5 class actions by relaxing\nor eliminating the reliance element of the implied 10b–5 action. See,\ne.g., Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F. 2d 891 (CA9 1975); Note, The Fraud-on­\nthe-Market Theory, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1143 (1982); Note, The Reliance\nRequirement in Private Actions under SEC Rule 10b–5, 88 Harv. L.\nRev. 584, 592–606 (1975). The “fraud-on-the-market theory” is an\numbrella term for those varied efforts.

Id., at 248.\n                              II\n  Basic’s reimagined reliance requirement was a mistake,\nand the passage of time has compounded its failings.\nFirst, the Court based both parts of the presumption of\nreliance on a questionable understanding of disputed\neconomic theory and flawed intuitions about investor\nbehavior. Second, Basic’s rebuttable presumption is at\nodds with our subsequent Rule 23 cases, which require\nplaintiffs seeking class certification to “ ‘affirmatively\ndemonstrate’ ” certification requirements like the predom­\ninance of common questions. Comcast Corp. v. Behrend,\n569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n10)). Finally, Basic’s presumption that investors rely on\nthe integrity of the market price is virtually irrebuttable\nin practice, which means that the “essential” reliance\nelement effectively exists in name only.\n                             A\n   Basic based the presumption of reliance on two factual\nassumptions. The first assumption was that, in a “well­\ndeveloped market,” public statements are generally “re­\nflected” in the market price of securities. 485 U. S., at\n247. The second was that investors in such markets\ntransact “in reliance on the integrity of that price.” Ibid.\n\n——————\n  3 An investor could invoke this presumption by demonstrating certain\n\npredicates: (1) a public statement; (2) an efficient market; (3) that the\nshares were traded after the statement was made but before the truth\nwas revealed; and (4) that the statement was material. Basic, 485\nU. S., at 248, n. 27.\n6       HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nIn other words, the Court created a presumption that a\nplaintiff had met the two-part, fraud-on-the-market ver­\nsion of the reliance requirement because, in the Court’s\nview, “common sense and probability” suggested that each\nof those parts would be met. Id., at 246.\n   In reality, both of the Court’s key assumptions are\nhighly contestable and do not provide the necessary sup­\nport for Basic’s presumption of reliance. The first assump­\ntion—that public statements are “reflected” in the market\nprice—was grounded in an economic theory that has\ngarnered substantial criticism since Basic. The second as-\nsumption—that investors categorically rely on the integrity\nof the market price—is simply wrong.\n                             1\n   The Court’s first assumption was that “most publicly\navailable information”—including public misstatements—\n“is reflected in [the] market price” of a security. Id., at\n247. The Court grounded that assumption in “empirical\nstudies” testing a then-nascent economic theory known as\nthe efficient capital markets hypothesis. Id., at 246–247.\nSpecifically, the Court relied upon the “semi-strong” ver­\nsion of that theory, which posits that the average investor\ncannot earn above-market returns (i.e., “beat the market”)\nin an efficient market by trading on the basis of publicly\navailable information. See, e.g., Stout, The Mechanisms of\nMarket Inefficiency: An Introduction to the New Finance,\n28 J. Corp.

At the time of Basic,\nthis version of the efficient capital markets hypothesis was\n“widely accepted.” See Dunbar & Heller 463–464.\n   This view of market efficiency has since lost its luster.\nSee, e.g., Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking Fraud\non the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 175 (“Doubts about\nthe strength and pervasiveness of market efficiency are\nmuch greater today than they were in the mid-1980s”). As\nit turns out, even “well-developed” markets (like the New\nYork Stock Exchange) do not uniformly incorporate infor­\nmation into market prices with high speed. “[F]riction in\naccessing public information” and the presence of “pro­\ncessing costs” means that “not all public information will\nbe impounded in a security’s price with the same alacrity,\nor perhaps with any quickness at all.” Cox, Understand­\ning Causation in Private Securities Lawsuits: Building on\nAmgen, 66 Vand. L. Rev. 1719, 1732 (2013) (hereinafter\nCox). For example, information that is easily digestible\n(merger announcements or stock splits) or especially\nprominent (Wall Street Journal articles) may be incorpo­\nrated quickly, while information that is broadly applicable\nor technical (Securities and Exchange Commission filings)\nmay be incorporated slowly or even ignored. See Stout,\nsupra, at 653–656; see e.g., In re Merck & Co.

Such anomalies\nmake it difficult to tell whether, at any given moment, a\nstock’s price accurately reflects its value as indicated by\nall publicly available information. In sum, economists\nnow understand that the price impact Basic assumed\nwould happen reflexively is actually far from certain even\nin “well-developed” markets. Thus, Basic’s claim that\n“common sense and probability” support a presumption of\nreliance rests on shaky footing.\n                                2\n   The Basic Court also grounded the presumption of\nreliance in a second assumption: that “[a]n investor who\nbuys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in\nreliance on the integrity of that price.” 485 U. S., at 247.\nIn other words, the Court assumed that investors transact\nbased on the belief that the market price accurately re­\nflects the underlying “ ‘value’ ” of the security. See id., at\n244 (“ ‘[P]urchasers generally rely on the price of the stock\nas a reflection of its value’ ”). The Basic Court appears to\nhave adopted this assumption about investment behavior\nbased only on what it believed to be “common sense.” Id.,\nat 246. The Court found it “ ‘hard to imagine that there\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\never is a buyer or seller who does not rely on market in­\ntegrity. Who would knowingly roll the dice in a crooked\ncrap game?’ ” Id., at 246–247.\n   The Court’s rather superficial analysis does not with­\nstand scrutiny. It cannot be seriously disputed that a\ngreat many investors do not buy or sell stock based on a\nbelief that the stock’s price accurately reflects its value.\nMany investors in fact trade for the opposite reason—that\nis, because they think the market has under- or overval­\nued the stock, and they believe they can profit from that\nmispricing. Id., at 256 (opinion of White, J.); see, e.g.,\nMacey, The Fraud on the Market Theory: Some Prelimi­\nnary Issues, 74 Cornell L. Rev. 923, 925 (1989) (The “op­\nposite” of Basic’s assumption appears to be true; some\ninvestors “attempt to locate undervalued stocks in an\neffort to ‘beat the market’ . . . in essence betting that the\nmarket . . . is in fact inefficient”). Indeed, securities\ntransactions often take place because the transacting\nparties disagree on the security’s value. See, e.g., Stout,\nAre Stock Markets Costly Casinos? Disagreement, Mar-\nket Failure, and Securities Regulation, 81 Va. L. Rev.\n611, 619 (1995) (“[A]vailable evidence suggests that . . . in-\nvestor disagreement inspires the lion’s share of equities\ntransactions”).\n   Other investors trade for reasons entirely unrelated to\nprice—for instance, to address changing liquidity needs,\ntax concerns, or portfolio balancing requirements. See id.,\nat 657–658; see also Cox 1739 (investors may purchase\n“due to portfolio rebalancing arising from its obeisance to\nan indexing strategy”). These investment decisions—\nmade with indifference to price and thus without regard\nfor price “integrity”—are at odds with Basic’s understand­\ning of what motivates investment decisions. In short,\nBasic’s assumption that all investors rely in common on\n10       HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n“price integrity” is simply wrong.5\n   The majority tries (but fails) to reconcile Basic’s as­\nsumption about investor behavior with the reality that\nmany investors do not behave in the way Basic assumed.\nIt first asserts that Basic rested only on the more modest\nview that “ ‘most investors’ ” rely on the integrity of a\nsecurity’s market price. Ante, at 12 (quoting not Basic, but\nAmgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust\nFunds, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5) (emphasis\nadded)). That gloss is difficult to square with Basic’s plain\nlanguage: “An investor who buys or sells stock at the price\nset by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of\nthat price.” Basic, 458 U. S., at 247; see also id., at 246–\n247 (“ ‘[I]t is hard to imagine that there ever is a buyer or\nseller who does not rely on market integrity’ ”). In any\nevent, neither Basic nor the majority offers anything more\nthan a judicial hunch as evidence that even “most” inves­\ntors rely on price integrity.\n   The majority also suggests that “there is no reason to\nsuppose” that investors who buy stock they believe to be\nundervalued are “indifferent to the integrity of market\nprices.” Ante, at 12. Such “value investor[s],” according to\nthe majority, “implicitly rel[y] on the fact that a stock’s\nmarket price will eventually reflect material information”\n——————\n  5 The Basic Court’s mistaken intuition about investor behavior ap­\n\npears to involve a category mistake: the Court invoked a hypothesis\nmeant to describe markets, but then used it “in the one way it is not\nmeant to be used: as a predictor of the behavior of individual investors.”\nLangevoort, Theories, Assumptions, and Securities Regulation: Market\nEfficiency Revisited, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 851, 895 (1992). The efficient\ncapital markets hypothesis does not describe “how investors behave; [it]\nonly suggests the consequences of their collective behavior.” Cox 1736.\n“Nothing in the hypothesis denies what most popular accounts assume:\nthat much information searching and trading by investors, from insti­\ntutions on down, is done in the (perhaps erroneous) belief that under­\nvalued or overvalued stocks exist and can systematically be discovered.”\nLangevoort, Theories, supra, at 895.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand “presumably tr[y] to estimate how undervalued or\novervalued a particular stock is” by reference to the mar­\nket price. Ibid. Whether the majority’s unsupported\nclaims about the thought processes of hypothetical inves­\ntors are accurate or not, they are surely beside the point.\nWhatever else an investor believes about the market, he\nsimply does not “rely on the integrity of the market price”\nif he does not believe that the market price accurately\nreflects public information at the time he transacts. That\nis, an investor cannot claim that a public misstatement\ninduced his transaction by distorting the market price if\nhe did not buy at that price while believing that it accu­\nrately incorporated that public information. For that sort\nof investor, Basic’s critical fiction falls apart.\n                               B\n    Basic’s presumption of reliance also conflicts with our\nmore recent cases clarifying Rule 23’s class-certification\nrequirements. Those cases instruct that “a party seeking\nto maintain a class action ‘must affirmatively demonstrate\nhis compliance’ with Rule 23.” Comcast, 569 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 5) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10). To prevail on a motion for class certification, a\nparty must demonstrate through “evidentiary proof ” that\n“ ‘questions of law or fact common to class members pre­\ndominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers.’ ” 569 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5–6) (quoting\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3)).\n    Basic permits plaintiffs to bypass that requirement of\nevidentiary proof. Under Basic, plaintiffs who invoke the\npresumption of reliance (by proving its predicates) are\ndeemed to have met the predominance requirement of\nRule 23(b)(3). See ante, at 14; Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (Basic “facilitates class certification by recogniz­\ning a rebuttable presumption of classwide reliance”);\nBasic, 485 U. S., at 242, 250 (holding that the District\n12       HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCourt appropriately certified the class based on the pre­\nsumption of reliance). But, invoking the Basic presump­\ntion does not actually prove that individual questions of\nreliance will not overwhelm the common questions in the\ncase. Basic still requires a showing that the individual\ninvestor bought or sold in reliance on the integrity of the\nmarket price and, crucially, permits defendants to rebut\nthe presumption by producing evidence that individual\nplaintiffs do not meet that description. See id., at 249\n(“Petitioners . . . could rebut the presumption of reliance\nas to plaintiffs who would have divested themselves of\ntheir Basic shares without relying on the integrity of the\nmarket”). Thus, by its own terms, Basic entitles defend­\nants to ask each class member whether he traded in reli­\nance on the integrity of the market price. That inquiry,\nlike the traditional reliance inquiry, is inherently individ­\nualized; questions about the trading strategies of individ­\nual investors will not generate “ ‘common answers apt to\ndrive the resolution of the litigation,’ ” Wal-Mart Stores,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 10). See supra, at 8–9; see also\nCox 1736, n. 55 (Basic’s recognition that defendants could\nrebut the presumption “by proof the investor would have\ntraded anyway appears to require individual inquiries into\nreliance”).\n   Basic thus exempts Rule 10b–5 plaintiffs from Rule 23’s\nproof requirement. Plaintiffs who invoke the presumption\nof reliance are deemed to have shown predominance as a\nmatter of law, even though the resulting rebuttable pre­\nsumption leaves individualized questions of reliance in the\ncase and predominance still unproved. Needless to say,\nthat exemption was beyond the Basic Court’s power to\ngrant.6\n——————\n  6 The majority suggests that Basic squares with Comcast Corp. v.\n\nBehrend, 569 U. S. ___ (2013), and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564\nU. S. ___ (2011), because it does not “relieve plaintiffs of the burden of\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

But in practice, the so-called “rebut­\ntable presumption” is largely irrebuttable.\n   The Basic Court ostensibly afforded defendants an\nopportunity to rebut the presumption by providing evi­\ndence that either aspect of a plaintiff ’s fraud-on-the­\nmarket reliance—price impact, or reliance on the integrity\nof the market price—is missing. 485 U. S., at 248–249. As\nit turns out, however, the realities of class-action proce­\ndure make rebuttal based on an individual plaintiff ’s lack\nof reliance virtually impossible. At the class-certification\nstage, rebuttal is only directed at the class representa­\ntives, which means that counsel only needs to find one\nclass member who can withstand the challenge. See\nGrundfest, Damages and Reliance Under Section 10(b) of\nthe Exchange Act, 69 Bus. Lawyer 307, 362 (2014). After\nclass certification, courts have refused to allow defendants\nto challenge any plaintiff ’s reliance on the integrity of the\nmarket price prior to a determination on classwide liabil­\nity. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United\nStates of America et al. as Amici Curiae 13–14 (collecting\ncases rejecting postcertification attempts to rebut individ­\nual class members’ reliance on price integrity as not perti­\nnent to classwide liability). One search for rebuttals on\nindividual-reliance grounds turned up only six cases out of\nthe thousands of Rule 10b–5 actions brought since Basic. \n\nGrundfest, supra, at 360.7\n\n—————— \n\nproving . . . predominance” but “rather sets forth what they must prove\nto demonstrate such predominance.” Ante, at 14–15. This argument\nmisses the point. Because Basic offers defendants a chance to rebut the\npresumption on individualized grounds, the predicates that Basic sets\nforth as sufficient to invoke the presumption do not necessarily prove\npredominance.\n  7 The absence of postcertification rebuttal is likely attributable in\n\npart to the substantial in terrorem settlement pressures brought to bear\n14       HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                   THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n    The apparent unavailability of this form of rebuttal has\ntroubling implications. Because the presumption is con­\nclusive in practice with respect to investors’ reliance on\nprice integrity, even Basic’s watered-down reliance re­\nquirement has been effectively eliminated. Once the\npresumption attaches, the reliance element is no longer an\nobstacle to prevailing on the claim, even though many\nclass members will not have transacted in reliance on\nprice integrity, see supra, at 8–9. And without a func-\ntional reliance requirement, the “essential element” that\nensures the plaintiff has actually been defrauded, see\nStoneridge, 552 U. S., at 159, Rule 10b–5 becomes the very\n“ ‘scheme of investor’s insurance’ ” the rebuttable presump­\ntion was supposed to prevent. See Basic, supra, at 252\n(opinion of White, J.).8\n                         *   *     *\n   For these reasons, Basic should be overruled in favor of\nthe straightforward rule that “[r]eliance by the plaintiff\nupon the defendant’s deceptive acts”—actual reliance, not\nthe fictional “fraud-on-the-market” version—“is an essen­\ntial element of the §10(b) private cause of action.” Stone-\nridge, 552 U. S., at 159.\n——————\nby certification. See, e.g., Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of\nAggregate Proof, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 97, 99 (2009) (“With vanishingly\nrare exception, class certification sets the litigation on a path toward res­\nolution by way of settlement, not full-fledged testing of the plaintiffs’ case\nby trial”); see also Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.

S. 148, 163 (2008) (“[E]xtensive discovery and\nthe potential for uncertainty and disruption in a lawsuit allow plaintiffs\nwith weak claims to extort settlements from innocent companies”).\n  8 Of course, today’s decision makes clear that a defendant may rebut\n\nthe presumption by producing evidence that the misstatement at issue\nfailed to affect the market price of the security, see ante, at 17–22. But\nboth parts of Basic’s version of reliance are key to its fiction that an\ninvestor has “indirectly” relied on the misstatement; the unavailability\nof rebuttal with respect to one of those parts still functionally removes\nreliance as an element of proof.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

We have\nnot hesitated to overrule decisions when they are “un­\nworkable or are badly reasoned,” Payne v. Tennessee, 501\nU. S. 808, 827 (1991); when “the theoretical underpinnings\nof those decisions are called into serious question,” State\nOil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 21 (1997); when the decisions\nhave become “irreconcilable” with intervening develop­\nments in “competing legal doctrines or policies,” Patterson\nv. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989); or\nwhen they are otherwise “a positive detriment to coher­\nence and consistency in the law,” ibid. Just one of these\ncircumstances can justify our correction of bad precedent;\nBasic checks all the boxes.\n   In support of its decision to preserve Basic, the majority\ncontends that stare decisis “has ‘special force’ ‘in respect to\nstatutory interpretation’ because ‘Congress remains free to\nalter what we have done.’ ” Ante, at 12 (quoting John R.\nSand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 139\n(2008); some internal quotation marks omitted). But\nBasic, of course, has nothing to do with statutory interpre­\ntation. The case concerned a judge-made evidentiary\npresumption for a judge-made element of the implied\n10b−5 private cause of action, itself “a judicial construct\nthat Congress did not enact in the text of the relevant\nstatutes.” Stoneridge, supra, at 164. We have not afforded\nstare decisis “special force” outside the context of statu-\ntory interpretation, see Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian\nCommunity, 572 U. S. ___, ___, n. 6 (2014) (THOMAS, J.\ndissenting) (slip op., at 15, n. 6 and for good reason. In\nstatutory cases, it is perhaps plausible that Congress\nwatches over its enactments and will step in to fix our\nmistakes, so we may leave to Congress the judgment\nwhether the interpretive question is better left “ ‘settled’ ”\nor “ ‘settled right,’ ” Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier\n16     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nTariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986). But this\nrationale is untenable when it comes to judge-made law\nlike “implied” private causes of action, which we retain a\nduty to superintend. See, e.g., Exxon Shipping Co. v.\nBaker, 554 U. S. 471, 507 (2008) (“[T]he judiciary [cannot]\nwash its hands of a problem it created . . . simply by call­\ning [the judicial doctrine] legislative”). Thus, when we err\nin areas of judge-made law, we ought to presume that\nCongress expects us to correct our own mistakes—not the\nother way around. That duty is especially clear in the\nRule 10b–5 context, where we have said that “[t]he federal\ncourts have accepted and exercised the principal responsi­\nbility for the continuing elaboration of the scope of the\n10b–5 right and the definition of the duties it imposes.”\nMusick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508\nU. S. 286, 292 (1993).\n   Basic’s presumption of reliance remains our mistake to\ncorrect. Since Basic, Congress has enacted two major\nsecurities laws: the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737, and the Securities\nLitigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), 112\nStat. 3227. The PSLRA “sought to combat perceived\nabuses in securities litigation,” ante, at 15, and SLUSA\nprevented plaintiffs from avoiding the PSLRA’s re­\nstrictions by bringing class actions in state court, ibid.\nNeither of these Acts touched the reliance element of the\nimplied Rule 10b–5 private cause of action or the Basic\npresumption.\n   Contrary to respondent’s argument (the majority wisely\nskips this next line of defense), we cannot draw from\nCongress’ silence on this matter an inference that Con­\ngress approved of Basic. To begin with, it is inappropriate\nto give weight to “Congress’ unenacted opinion” when\nconstruing judge-made doctrines, because doing so allows\nthe Court to create law and then “effectively codif[y]” it\n“based only on Congress’ failure to address it.” Bay Mills,\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

U. S. Const.,\nArt. I, §7. Adherence to Basic based on congressional\ninaction would invert that requirement by insulating error\nfrom correction merely because Congress failed to pass a\nlaw on the subject. Cf. Patterson, supra, at 175, n. 1\n(“Congressional inaction cannot amend a duly enacted\nstatute”).\n   At any rate, arguments from legislative inaction are\nspeculative at best. “[I]t is ‘ “impossible to assert with any\ndegree of assurance that congressional failure to act rep­\nresents” affirmative congressional approval of ’ one of this\nCourt’s decisions.” Bay Mills, supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Patterson, supra, at\n175, n. 1). “ ‘Congressional inaction lacks persuasive\nsignificance’ ” because it is indeterminate; “ ‘several equally\ntenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction.’ ”\nCentral Bank of Denver, N.

Therefore, “[i]t does not follow . . . that Con­\ngress’ failure to overturn a . . . precedent is reason for this\nCourt to adhere to it.” Patterson, supra, at 175, n. 1.\n   That is especially true here, because Congress passed a\nlaw to tell us not to draw any inference from its inaction.\nThe PSLRA expressly states that “[n]othing in this Act . . .\nshall be deemed to create or ratify any implied private\nright of action.” Notes following 15 U.

Argued March 5, 2014—Decided June 23, 2014\nInvestors can recover damages in a private securities fraud action only\n  if they prove that they relied on the defendant’s misrepresentation in\n  deciding to buy or sell a company’s stock. In Basic Inc. v. Levinson,\n  485 U. S. 224, this Court held that investors could satisfy this reli-\n  ance requirement by invoking a presumption that the price of stock\n  traded in an efficient market reflects all public, material infor-\n  mation—including material misrepresentations. The Court also held,\n  however, that a defendant could rebut this presumption by showing\n  that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock\n  price—that is, that it had no “price impact.”\n     Respondent Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), filed a putative\n  class action against Halliburton and one of its executives (collectively\n  Halliburton), alleging that they made misrepresentations designed to\n  inflate Halliburton’s stock price, in violation of section 10(b) of the\n  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Com-\n  mission Rule 10b–5. The District Court initially denied EPJ Fund’s\n  class certification motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed. But this\n  Court vacated that judgment, concluding that securities fraud plain-\n  tiffs need not prove loss causation—a causal connection between the\n  defendants’ alleged misrepresentations and the plaintiffs’ economic\n  losses—at the class certification stage in order to invoke Basic’s pre-\n  sumption of reliance. On remand, Halliburton argued that class cer-\n  tification was nonetheless inappropriate because the evidence it had\n  earlier introduced to disprove loss causation also showed that its al-\n  leged misrepresentations had not affected its stock price. By demon-\n  strating the absence of any “price impact,” Halliburton contended, it\n2         HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    had rebutted the Basic presumption. And without the benefit of that\n    presumption, investors would have to prove reliance on an individual\n    basis, meaning that individual issues would predominate over com-\n    mon ones and class certification would be inappropriate under Fed-\n    eral Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). The District Court rejected Hal-\n    liburton’s argument and certified the class. The Fifth Circuit\n    affirmed, concluding that Halliburton could use its price impact evi-\n    dence to rebut the Basic presumption only at trial, not at the class\n    certification stage.\nHeld:\n    1. Halliburton has not shown a “special justification,” Dickerson v.\n United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443, for overruling Basic’s presumption\n of reliance. Pp. 4–16.\n       (a) To recover damages under section 10(b) and Rule 10b–5, a\n plaintiff must prove, as relevant here, “ ‘reliance upon the misrepre-\n sentation or omission.’ ” Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans\n and Trust Funds, 568 U. S. ___, ___. The Court recognized in Basic,\n however, that requiring direct proof of reliance from every individual\n plaintiff “would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary bur-\n den on the . . . plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market,”\n 485 U. S., at 245, and “effectively would” prevent plaintiffs “from pro-\n ceeding with a class action” in Rule 10b–5 suits, id., at 242. To ad-\n dress these concerns, the Court held that plaintiffs could satisfy the\n reliance element of a Rule 10b–5 action by invoking a rebuttable pre-\n sumption of reliance. The Court based that presumption on what is\n known as the “fraud-on-the-market” theory, which holds that “the\n market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all\n publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepre-\n sentations.” Id., at 246. The Court also noted that the typical “inves-\n tor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in\n reliance on the integrity of that price.” Id., at 247. As a result,\n whenever an investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his “re-\n liance on any public material misrepresentations . . . may be pre-\n sumed for purposes of a Rule 10b–5 action.” Id. at 247.

Pp. 7–8.\n         (2) Halliburton also contends that Basic rested on two premis-\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

The Court in Basic acknowl-\nedged, however, the debate among economists about the efficiency of\ncapital markets and refused to endorse “any particular theory of how\nquickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in\nmarket price.” 485 U. S., at 248, n. 28. The Court instead based the\npresumption of reliance on the fairly modest premise that “market\nprofessionals generally consider most publicly announced material\nstatements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.”\nId., at 247, n. 24. Moreover, in making the presumption rebuttable,\nBasic recognized that market efficiency is a matter of degree and ac-\ncordingly made it a matter of proof. Halliburton has not identified\nthe kind of fundamental shift in economic theory that could justify\noverruling a precedent on the ground that it misunderstood, or has\nsince been overtaken by, economic realities.\n   Halliburton also contests the premise that investors “invest ‘in re-\nliance on the integrity of [the market] price,’ ” id., at 247, identifying\na number of classes of investors for whom “price integrity” is suppos-\nedly “marginal or irrelevant.” But Basic never denied the existence\nof such investors, who in any event rely at least on the facts that\nmarket prices will incorporate public information within a reasonable\nperiod and that market prices, however inaccurate, are not distorted\nby fraud. Pp. 8–12.\n     (c) The principle of stare decisis has “ ‘special force’ ” “in respect\nto statutory interpretation” because “ ‘Congress remains free to alter\nwhat [the Court has] done.’ ” John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 130, 139. So too with Basic’s presumption of reli-\nance. The presumption is not inconsistent with this Court’s more re-\ncent decisions construing the Rule 10b–5 cause of action. In Central\nBank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511\nU. S. 164, and Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-\nAtlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, the Court declined to effectively elimi-\nnate the reliance element by extending liability to entirely new cate-\ngories of defendants who themselves had not made any material,\npublic misrepresentation. The Basic presumption, by contrast, mere-\nly provides an alternative means of satisfying the reliance element.\nNor is the Basic presumption inconsistent with the Court’s recent de-\ncisions governing class action certification, which require plaintiffs to\nprove—not simply plead—that their proposed class satisfies each re-\nquirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, including, if appli-\ncable, the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). See, e.g., Wal-\n4         HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___. The Basic presumption\n    does not relieve plaintiffs of that burden but rather sets forth what\n    plaintiffs must prove to demonstrate predominance. Finally, Halli-\n    burton emphasizes the possible harmful consequences of the securi-\n    ties class actions facilitated by the Basic presumption, but such con-\n    cerns are more appropriately addressed to Congress, which has in\n    fact responded, to some extent, to many of them. Pp. 12–16.\n       2. For the same reasons the Court declines to overrule Basic’s pre-\n    sumption of reliance, it also declines to modify the prerequisites for\n    invoking the presumption by requiring plaintiffs to prove “price im-\n    pact” directly at the class certification stage. The Basic presumption\n    incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff shows\n    that the defendant’s misrepresentation was public and material and\n    that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, he is entitled to\n    a presumption that the misrepresentation affected the stock price.\n    Second, if the plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the\n    market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further\n    presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defend-\n    ant’s misrepresentation. Requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact\n    directly would take away the first constituent presumption. Halli-\n    burton’s argument for doing so is the same as its argument for over-\n    ruling the Basic presumption altogether, and it meets the same fate.\n    Pp. 16–18.\n       3. The Court agrees with Halliburton, however, that defendants\n    must be afforded an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reliance\n    before class certification with evidence of a lack of price impact. De-\n    fendants may already introduce such evidence at the merits stage to\n    rebut the Basic presumption, as well as at the class certification\n    stage to counter a plaintiff’s showing of market efficiency. Forbid-\n    ding defendants to rely on the same evidence prior to class certifica-\n    tion for the particular purpose of rebutting the presumption altogeth-\n    er makes no sense, and can readily lead to results that are\n    inconsistent with Basic’s own logic. Basic allows plaintiffs to estab-\n    lish price impact indirectly, by showing that a stock traded in an effi-\n    cient market and that a defendant’s misrepresentations were public\n    and material. But an indirect proxy should not preclude considera-\n    tion of a defendant’s direct, more salient evidence showing that an al-\n    leged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock’s price and,\n    consequently, that the Basic presumption does not apply. Amgen\n    does not require a different result. There, the Court held that mate-\n    riality, though a prerequisite for invoking the Basic presumption,\n    should be left to the merits stage because it does not bear on the pre-\n    dominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). In contrast, the fact that a\n    misrepresentation has price impact is “Basic’s fundamental premise.”\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

It\n  thus has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class\n  certification stage. That is why, if reliance is to be shown through\n  the Basic presumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequi-\n  sites must be proved before class certification. Given that such indi-\n  rect evidence of price impact will be before the court at the class certi-\n  fication stage in any event, there is no reason to artificially limit the\n  inquiry at that stage by excluding direct evidence of price impact.\n  Pp. 18–23.\n718 F. 3d 423, vacated and remanded.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

In Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224\n(1988), we held that investors could satisfy this reliance\nrequirement by invoking a presumption that the price of\nstock traded in an efficient market reflects all public,\nmaterial information—including material misstatements.\nIn such a case, we concluded, anyone who buys or sells the\nstock at the market price may be considered to have relied\non those misstatements.\n  We also held, however, that a defendant could rebut this\npresumption in a number of ways, including by showing\nthat the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect\nthe stock’s price—that is, that the misrepresentation had\nno “price impact.” The questions presented are whether\nwe should overrule or modify Basic’s presumption of reli-\nance and, if not, whether defendants should nonetheless\n2      HALLIBURTON CO. v.

John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the\nlead plaintiff in a putative class action against Halliburton\nand one of its executives (collectively Halliburton) alleging\nviolations of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b), and Securities\nand Exchange Commission Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5\n(2013). According to EPJ Fund, between June 3, 1999,\nand December 7, 2001, Halliburton made a series of mis-\nrepresentations regarding its potential liability in asbestos\nlitigation, its expected revenue from certain construction\ncontracts, and the anticipated benefits of its merger with\nanother company—all in an attempt to inflate the price of\nits stock. Halliburton subsequently made a number of\ncorrective disclosures, which, EPJ Fund contends, caused\nthe company’s stock price to drop and investors to lose\nmoney.\n   EPJ Fund moved to certify a class comprising all inves-\ntors who purchased Halliburton common stock during the\nclass period. The District Court found that the proposed\nclass satisfied all the threshold requirements of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(a): It was sufficiently numer-\nous, there were common questions of law or fact, the rep-\nresentative parties’ claims were typical of the class claims,\nand the representatives could fairly and adequately pro-\ntect the interests of the class. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a.\nAnd except for one difficulty, the court would have also\nconcluded that the class satisfied the requirement of Rule\n23(b)(3) that “the questions of law or fact common to class\nmembers predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members.” See id., at 55a, 98a.

Because EPJ Fund\nhad not demonstrated such a connection for any of Halli-\nburton’s alleged misrepresentations, the District Court\nrefused to certify the proposed class. Id., at 55a, 98a. The\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit af-\nfirmed the denial of class certification on the same ground.\nArchdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting Fund, Inc. v. Halli-\nburton Co., 597 F. 3d 330 (2010).\n   We granted certiorari and vacated the judgment, finding\nnothing in “Basic or its logic” to justify the Fifth Circuit’s\nrequirement that securities fraud plaintiffs prove loss\ncausation at the class certification stage in order to invoke\nBasic’s presumption of reliance. Erica P. John Fund, Inc.\nv. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (Halliburton\nI ) (slip op., at 6). “Loss causation,” we explained, “ad-\ndresses a matter different from whether an investor relied\non a misrepresentation, presumptively or otherwise, when\nbuying or selling a stock.” Ibid. We remanded the case for\nthe lower courts to consider “any further arguments\nagainst class certification” that Halliburton had preserved.\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n   On remand, Halliburton argued that class certification\nwas inappropriate because the evidence it had earlier\nintroduced to disprove loss causation also showed that\nnone of its alleged misrepresentations had actually af-\nfected its stock price. By demonstrating the absence of any\n“price impact,” Halliburton contended, it had rebutted\nBasic’s presumption that the members of the proposed\nclass had relied on its alleged misrepresentations simply\nby buying or selling its stock at the market price. And\nwithout the benefit of the Basic presumption, investors\nwould have to prove reliance on an individual basis, mean-\n4      HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P.

The District Court declined to consider Halli-\nburton’s argument, holding that the Basic presumption\napplied and certifying the class under Rule 23(b)(3). App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 30a.\n   The Fifth Circuit affirmed. 718 F. 3d 423 (2013). The\ncourt found that Halliburton had preserved its price im-\npact argument, but to no avail. Id., at 435–436. While\nacknowledging that “Halliburton’s price impact evidence\ncould be used at the trial on the merits to refute the pre-\nsumption of reliance,” id., at 433, the court held that\nHalliburton could not use such evidence for that purpose\nat the class certification stage, id., at 435. “[P]rice impact\nevidence,” the court explained, “does not bear on the ques-\ntion of common question predominance [under Rule\n23(b)(3)], and is thus appropriately considered only on the\nmerits after the class has been certified.” Ibid.\n   We once again granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013),\nthis time to resolve a conflict among the Circuits over\nwhether securities fraud defendants may attempt to rebut\nthe Basic presumption at the class certification stage with\nevidence of a lack of price impact.

To recover damages\nfor violations of section 10(b) and Rule 10b–5, a plaintiff\nmust prove “ ‘(1) a material misrepresentation or omission\nby the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the\nmisrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of\na security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or\nomission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.’ ”\nAmgen Inc. v.

S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 9)).\n   The reliance element “ ‘ensures that there is a proper\nconnection between a defendant’s misrepresentation and a\nplaintiff ’s injury.’ ” 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quot-\ning Halliburton I, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)). “The\ntraditional (and most direct) way a plaintiff can demon-\nstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware of a com-\npany’s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction—\ne.g., purchasing common stock—based on that specific\nmisrepresentation.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   In Basic, however, we recognized that requiring such\ndirect proof of reliance “would place an unnecessarily\nunrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 10b–5 plaintiff\nwho has traded on an impersonal market.” 485 U. S., at\n245. That is because, even assuming an investor could\nprove that he was aware of the misrepresentation, he\nwould still have to “show a speculative state of facts, i.e.,\n6      HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhow he would have acted . . . if the misrepresentation had\nnot been made.” Ibid.\n   We also noted that “[r]equiring proof of individualized\nreliance” from every securities fraud plaintiff “effectively\nwould . . . prevent[ ] [plaintiffs] from proceeding with a\nclass action” in Rule 10b–5 suits. Id., at 242. If every\nplaintiff had to prove direct reliance on the defendant’s\nmisrepresentation, “individual issues then would . . .\noverwhelm[ ] the common ones,” making certification\nunder Rule 23(b)(3) inappropriate. Ibid.\n   To address these concerns, Basic held that securities\nfraud plaintiffs can in certain circumstances satisfy the\nreliance element of a Rule 10b–5 action by invoking a\nrebuttable presumption of reliance, rather than proving\ndirect reliance on a misrepresentation. The Court based\nthat presumption on what is known as the “fraud-on-the-\nmarket” theory, which holds that “the market price of\nshares traded on well-developed markets reflects all pub-\nlicly available information, and, hence, any material mis-\nrepresentations.” Id., at 246. The Court also noted that,\nrather than scrutinize every piece of public information\nabout a company for himself, the typical “investor who\nbuys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in\nreliance on the integrity of that price”—the belief that it\nreflects all public, material information. Id., at 247. As a\nresult, whenever the investor buys or sells stock at the\nmarket price, his “reliance on any public material misrep-\nresentations . . . may be presumed for purposes of a Rule\n10b–5 action.” Ibid.\n   Based on this theory, a plaintiff must make the follow-\ning showings to demonstrate that the presumption of\nreliance applies in a given case: (1) that the alleged mis-\nrepresentations were publicly known, (2) that they were\nmaterial, (3) that the stock traded in an efficient market,\nand (4) that the plaintiff traded the stock between the\ntime the misrepresentations were made and when the\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntruth was revealed. See id., at 248, n. 27; Halliburton I,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 5–6).\n   At the same time, Basic emphasized that the presump-\ntion of reliance was rebuttable rather than conclusive.\nSpecifically, “[a]ny showing that severs the link between\nthe alleged misrepresentation and either the price re-\nceived (or paid) by the plaintiff, or his decision to trade at\na fair market price, will be sufficient to rebut the pre-\nsumption of reliance.” 485 U. S., at 248. So for example, if\na defendant could show that the alleged misrepresentation\ndid not, for whatever reason, actually affect the market\nprice, or that a plaintiff would have bought or sold the\nstock even had he been aware that the stock’s price was\ntainted by fraud, then the presumption of reliance would\nnot apply. Id., at 248–249. In either of those cases, a\nplaintiff would have to prove that he directly relied on the\ndefendant’s misrepresentation in buying or selling the\nstock.\n                              B\n   Halliburton contends that securities fraud plaintiffs\nshould always have to prove direct reliance and that the\nBasic Court erred in allowing them to invoke a presump-\ntion of reliance instead. According to Halliburton, the\nBasic presumption contravenes congressional intent and\nhas been undermined by subsequent developments in\neconomic theory. Neither argument, however, so discred-\nits Basic as to constitute “special justification” for overrul-\ning the decision.\n                             1\n   Halliburton first argues that the Basic presumption is\ninconsistent with Congress’s intent in passing the 1934\nExchange Act. Because “[t]he Section 10(b) action is a\n‘judicial construct that Congress did not enact,’ ” this\nCourt, Halliburton insists, “must identify—and borrow\n8      HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom—the express provision that is ‘most analogous to the\nprivate 10b–5 right of action.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 12\n(quoting Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-\nAtlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 164 (2008); Musick, Peeler\n& Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 294\n(1993)). According to Halliburton, the closest analogue\nto section 10(b) is section 18(a) of the Act, which cre-\nates an express private cause of action allowing inves-\ntors to recover damages based on misrepresentations\nmade in certain regulatory filings. 15 U. S. C. §78r(a).\nThat provision requires an investor to prove that he\nbought or sold stock “in reliance upon” the defendant’s\nmisrepresentation. Ibid. In ignoring this direct reliance\nrequirement, the argument goes, the Basic Court relieved\nRule 10b–5 plaintiffs of a burden that Congress would\nhave imposed had it created the cause of action.\n  EPJ Fund contests both premises of Halliburton’s ar-\ngument, arguing that Congress has affirmed Basic’s con-\nstruction of section 10(b) and that, in any event, the clos-\nest analogue to section 10(b) is not section 18(a) but\nsection 9, 15 U. S. C. §78i—a provision that does not re-\nquire actual reliance.\n  We need not settle this dispute. In Basic, the dissenting\nJustices made the same argument based on section 18(a)\nthat Halliburton presses here. See 485 U. S., at 257–258\n(White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The\nBasic majority did not find that argument persuasive\nthen, and Halliburton has given us no new reason to\nendorse it now.\n                              2\n  Halliburton’s primary argument for overruling Basic is\nthat the decision rested on two premises that can no longer\nwithstand scrutiny. The first premise concerns what is\nknown as the “efficient capital markets hypothesis.” Basic\nstated that “the market price of shares traded on well-\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

From that statement, Halliburton concludes\nthat the Basic Court espoused “a robust view of market\nefficiency” that is no longer tenable, for “ ‘overwhelming\nempirical evidence’ now ‘suggests that capital markets are\nnot fundamentally efficient.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 14–16\n(quoting Lev & de Villiers, Stock Price Crashes and 10b–5\nDamages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis, 47\nStan. L. Rev 7, 20 (1994)). To support this contention,\nHalliburton cites studies purporting to show that “public\ninformation is often not incorporated immediately (much\nless rationally) into market prices.” Brief for Petitioners\n17; see id., at 16–20. See also Brief for Law Professors as\nAmici Curiae 15–18.\n   Halliburton does not, of course, maintain that capital\nmarkets are always inefficient. Rather, in its view, Basic’s\nfundamental error was to ignore the fact that “ ‘efficiency\nis not a binary, yes or no question.’ ” Brief for Petitioners\n20 (quoting Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking\nFraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 167)). The\nmarkets for some securities are more efficient than the\nmarkets for others, and even a single market can process\ndifferent kinds of information more or less efficiently,\ndepending on how widely the information is disseminated\nand how easily it is understood. Brief for Petitioners at\n20–21. Yet Basic, Halliburton asserts, glossed over these\nnuances, assuming a false dichotomy that renders the\npresumption of reliance both underinclusive and overin-\nclusive: A misrepresentation can distort a stock’s market\nprice even in a generally inefficient market, and a misrep-\nresentation can leave a stock’s market price unaffected\neven in a generally efficient one.

JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmists about the degree to which the market price of a\ncompany’s stock reflects public information about the\ncompany—and thus the degree to which an investor can\nearn an abnormal, above-market return by trading on\nsuch information. See Brief for Financial Economists as\nAmici Curiae 4–10 (describing the debate). That debate is\nnot new. Indeed, the Basic Court acknowledged it and\ndeclined to enter the fray, declaring that “[w]e need not\ndetermine by adjudication what economists and social\nscientists have debated through the use of sophisticated\nstatistical analysis and the application of economic the-\nory.” 485 U. S., at 246–247, n. 24. To recognize the pre-\nsumption of reliance, the Court explained, was not “con-\nclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly and\ncompletely publicly available information is reflected in\nmarket price.” Id., at 248, n. 28. The Court instead based\nthe presumption on the fairly modest premise that “mar-\nket professionals generally consider most publicly an-\nnounced material statements about companies, thereby\naffecting stock market prices.” Id., at 247, n. 24. Basic’s\npresumption of reliance thus does not rest on a “binary”\nview of market efficiency. Indeed, in making the pre-\nsumption rebuttable, Basic recognized that market effi-\nciency is a matter of degree and accordingly made it a\nmatter of proof.\n  The academic debates discussed by Halliburton have not\nrefuted the modest premise underlying the presumption of\nreliance. Even the foremost critics of the efficient-capital-\nmarkets hypothesis acknowledge that public information\ngenerally affects stock prices. See, e.g., Shiller, We’ll\nShare the Honors, and Agree to Disagree, N. Y. Times,\nOct. 27, 2013, p. BU6 (“Of course, prices reflect available\ninformation”). Halliburton also conceded as much in its\nreply brief and at oral argument. See Reply Brief 13\n(“market prices generally respond to new, material infor-\nmation”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.

Wendt,\n618 F. 3d 679, 685 (CA7 2010) (Easterbrook, C. J.). Even\nthough the efficient capital markets hypothesis may have\n“garnered substantial criticism since Basic,” post, at 6\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), Halliburton has not\nidentified the kind of fundamental shift in economic the-\nory that could justify overruling a precedent on the ground\nthat it misunderstood, or has since been overtaken by,\neconomic realities. Contrast State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522\nU. S. 3 (1997), unanimously overruling Albrecht v. Herald\nCo., 390 U. S. 145 (1968).\n   Halliburton also contests a second premise underlying\nthe Basic presumption: the notion that investors “invest\n‘in reliance on the integrity of [the market] price.’ ” Reply\nBrief 14 (quoting 485 U. S., at 247; alteration in original).\nHalliburton identifies a number of classes of investors for\nwhom “price integrity” is supposedly “marginal or irrele-\nvant.” Reply Brief 14. The primary example is the value\ninvestor, who believes that certain stocks are undervalued\nor overvalued and attempts to “beat the market” by buying\nthe undervalued stocks and selling the overvalued ones.\nBrief for Petitioners 15–16 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). See also Brief for Vivendi S. A. as Amicus Curiae\n3–10 (describing the investment strategies of day trad-\ners, volatility arbitragers, and value investors). If many\ninvestors “are indifferent to prices,” Halliburton contends,\nthen courts should not presume that investors rely on the\nintegrity of those prices and any misrepresentations in-\ncorporated into them. Reply Brief 14.\n   But Basic never denied the existence of such investors.\nAs we recently explained, Basic concluded only that “it is\nreasonable to presume that most investors—knowing that\n12     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthey have little hope of outperforming the market in the\nlong run based solely on their analysis of publicly availa-\nble information—will rely on the security’s market price as\nan unbiased assessment of the security’s value in light of\nall public information.” Amgen, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 5) (emphasis added).\n   In any event, there is no reason to suppose that even\nHalliburton’s main counterexample—the value investor—\nis as indifferent to the integrity of market prices as Halli-\nburton suggests. Such an investor implicitly relies on the\nfact that a stock’s market price will eventually reflect\nmaterial information—how else could the market correc-\ntion on which his profit depends occur? To be sure, the\nvalue investor “does not believe that the market price\naccurately reflects public information at the time he trans-\nacts.” Post, at 11. But to indirectly rely on a misstate-\nment in the sense relevant for the Basic presumption, he\nneed only trade stock based on the belief that the market\nprice will incorporate public information within a reason-\nable period. The value investor also presumably tries to\nestimate how undervalued or overvalued a particular\nstock is, and such estimates can be skewed by a market\nprice tainted by fraud.\n                               C\n  The principle of stare decisis has “ ‘special force’ ” “in\nrespect to statutory interpretation” because “ ‘Congress\nremains free to alter what we have done.’ ” John R.

Although the presumption is a judicially created\ndoctrine designed to implement a judicially created cause\nof action, we have described the presumption as “a sub-\nstantive doctrine of federal securities-fraud law.” Amgen,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). That is because it provides a\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

See, e.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.\nBroudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341–342 (2005). As with any other\nelement of that cause of action, Congress may overturn\nor modify any aspect of our interpretations of the reli-\nance requirement, including the Basic presumption it-\nself. Given that possibility, we see no reason to exempt\nthe Basic presumption from ordinary principles of stare\ndecisis.\n   To buttress its case for overruling Basic, Halliburton\ncontends that, in addition to being wrongly decided, the\ndecision is inconsistent with our more recent decisions\nconstruing the Rule 10b–5 cause of action. As Halliburton\nnotes, we have held that “we must give ‘narrow dimen-\nsions . . . to a right of action Congress did not authorize\nwhen it first enacted the statute and did not expand when\nit revisited the law.’ ” Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First\nDerivative Traders, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 167); see, e.g., Central\nBank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver,\nN. A., 511 U. S. 164 (1994) (refusing to recognize aiding-\nand-abetting liability under the Rule 10b–5 cause of ac-\ntion); Stoneridge, supra (refusing to extend Rule 10b–5\nliability to certain secondary actors who did not them-\nselves make material misstatements). Yet the Basic\npresumption, Halliburton asserts, does just the opposite,\nexpanding the Rule 10b–5 cause of action. Brief for Peti-\ntioners 27–29.\n   Not so. In Central Bank and Stoneridge, we declined to\nextend Rule 10b–5 liability to entirely new categories of\ndefendants who themselves had not made any material,\npublic misrepresentation. Such an extension, we ex-\nplained, would have eviscerated the requirement that a\nplaintiff prove that he relied on a misrepresentation made\nby the defendant. See Central Bank, supra, at 180; Stone-\nridge, supra, at 157, 159. The Basic presumption does\n14     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot eliminate that requirement but rather provides an\nalternative means of satisfying it. While the presumption\nmakes it easier for plaintiffs to prove reliance, it does not\nalter the elements of the Rule 10b–5 cause of action and\nthus maintains the action’s original legal scope.\n   Halliburton also argues that the Basic presumption\ncannot be reconciled with our recent decisions governing\nclass action certification under Federal Rule of Civil Pro-\ncedure 23. Those decisions have made clear that plaintiffs\nwishing to proceed through a class action must actually\nprove—not simply plead—that their proposed class satis-\nfies each requirement of Rule 23, including (if applicable)\nthe predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). See Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 10); Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 5–6). According to Halliburton, Basic\nrelieves Rule 10b–5 plaintiffs of that burden, allowing\ncourts to presume that common issues of reliance predom-\ninate over individual ones.\n   That is not the effect of the Basic presumption. In\nsecurities class action cases, the crucial requirement for\nclass certification will usually be the predominance re-\nquirement of Rule 23(b)(3). The Basic presumption does\nnot relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving—before class\ncertification—that this requirement is met. Basic instead\nestablishes that a plaintiff satisfies that burden by prov-\ning the prerequisites for invoking the presumption—\nnamely, publicity, materiality, market efficiency, and\nmarket timing. The burden of proving those prerequisites\nstill rests with plaintiffs and (with the exception of mate-\nriality) must be satisfied before class certification. Basic\ndoes not, in other words, allow plaintiffs simply to plead\nthat common questions of reliance predominate over indi-\nvidual ones, but rather sets forth what they must prove to\ndemonstrate such predominance.\n   Basic does afford defendants an opportunity to rebut the\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npresumption of reliance with respect to an individual\nplaintiff by showing that he did not rely on the integrity of\nthe market price in trading stock. While this has the\neffect of “leav[ing] individualized questions of reliance in\nthe case,” post, at 12, there is no reason to think that these\nquestions will overwhelm common ones and render class\ncertification inappropriate under Rule 23(b)(3). That the\ndefendant might attempt to pick off the occasional class\nmember here or there through individualized rebuttal\ndoes not cause individual questions to predominate.\n   Finally, Halliburton and its amici contend that, by\nfacilitating securities class actions, the Basic presumption\nproduces a number of serious and harmful consequences.\nSuch class actions, they say, allow plaintiffs to extort large\nsettlements from defendants for meritless claims; punish\ninnocent shareholders, who end up having to pay settle-\nments and judgments; impose excessive costs on businesses;\nand consume a disproportionately large share of judicial\nresources. Brief for Petitioners 39–45.\n   These concerns are more appropriately addressed to\nCongress, which has in fact responded, to some extent, to\nmany of the issues raised by Halliburton and its amici.\nCongress has, for example, enacted the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737,\nwhich sought to combat perceived abuses in securities\nlitigation with heightened pleading requirements, limits\non damages and attorney’s fees, a “safe harbor” for certain\nkinds of statements, restrictions on the selection of lead\nplaintiffs in securities class actions, sanctions for frivolous\nlitigation, and stays of discovery pending motions to dis-\nmiss. See Amgen, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20).\nAnd to prevent plaintiffs from circumventing these re-\nstrictions by bringing securities class actions under state\nlaw in state court, Congress also enacted the Securities\nLitigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3227,\nwhich precludes many state law class actions alleging\n16     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsecurities fraud. See Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20).\nSuch legislation demonstrates Congress’s willingness to\nconsider policy concerns of the sort that Halliburton says\nshould lead us to overrule Basic.\n                             III\n   Halliburton proposes two alternatives to overruling\nBasic that would alleviate what it regards as the decision’s\nmost serious flaws. The first alternative would require\nplaintiffs to prove that a defendant’s misrepresentation\nactually affected the stock price—so-called “price im-\npact”—in order to invoke the Basic presumption. It should\nnot be enough, Halliburton contends, for plaintiffs to\ndemonstrate the general efficiency of the market in which\nthe stock traded. Halliburton’s second proposed alterna-\ntive would allow defendants to rebut the presumption of\nreliance with evidence of a lack of price impact, not only at\nthe merits stage—which all agree defendants may already\ndo—but also before class certification.\n                             A\n   As noted, to invoke the Basic presumption, a plaintiff\nmust prove that: (1) the alleged misrepresentations were\npublicly known, (2) they were material, (3) the stock traded\nin an efficient market, and (4) the plaintiff traded the\nstock between when the misrepresentations were made\nand when the truth was revealed. See Basic, 485 U. S., at\n248, n. 27; Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15). Each of\nthese requirements follows from the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory underlying the presumption. If the misrepresenta-\ntion was not publicly known, then it could not have dis-\ntorted the stock’s market price. So too if the misrepresen-\ntation was immaterial—that is, if it would not have “ ‘been\nviewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly\naltered the “total mix” of information made available,’ ”\nBasic, supra, at 231–232 (quoting TSC Industries, Inc. v.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nNorthway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 449 (1976))—or if the mar-\nket in which the stock traded was inefficient. And if the\nplaintiff did not buy or sell the stock after the misrepre-\nsentation was made but before the truth was revealed,\nthen he could not be said to have acted in reliance on a\nfraud-tainted price.\n   The first three prerequisites are directed at price im-\npact—“whether the alleged misrepresentations affected\nthe market price in the first place.” Halliburton I, 563\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). In the absence of price impact,\nBasic’s fraud-on-the-market theory and presumption of\nreliance collapse. The “fundamental premise” underlying\nthe presumption is “that an investor presumptively relies\non a misrepresentation so long as it was reflected in the\nmarket price at the time of his transaction.” 563 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 7). If it was not, then there is “no ground-\ning for any contention that [the] investor[ ] indirectly\nrelied on th[at] misrepresentation[ ] through [his] reliance\non the integrity of the market price.” Amgen, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 17).\n   Halliburton argues that since the Basic presumption\nhinges on price impact, plaintiffs should be required to\nprove it directly in order to invoke the presumption.\nProving the presumption’s prerequisites, which are at best\nan imperfect proxy for price impact, should not suffice.\n   Far from a modest refinement of the Basic presumption,\nthis proposal would radically alter the required showing\nfor the reliance element of the Rule 10b–5 cause of action.\nWhat is called the Basic presumption actually incorpo-\nrates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff\nshows that the defendant’s misrepresentation was public\nand material and that the stock traded in a generally\nefficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the\nmisrepresentation affected the stock price. Second, if the\nplaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the\nmarket price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a\n18     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfurther presumption that he purchased the stock in reli-\nance on the defendant’s misrepresentation.\n  By requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly,\nHalliburton’s proposal would take away the first constitu-\nent presumption. Halliburton’s argument for doing so is\nthe same as its primary argument for overruling the Basic\npresumption altogether: Because market efficiency is not a\nyes-or-no proposition, a public, material misrepresentation\nmight not affect a stock’s price even in a generally efficient\nmarket. But as explained, Basic never suggested other-\nwise; that is why it affords defendants an opportunity to\nrebut the presumption by showing, among other things,\nthat the particular misrepresentation at issue did not\naffect the stock’s market price. For the same reasons we\ndeclined to completely jettison the Basic presumption, we\ndecline to effectively jettison half of it by revising the\nprerequisites for invoking it.\n                             B\n  Even if plaintiffs need not directly prove price impact to\ninvoke the Basic presumption, Halliburton contends that\ndefendants should at least be allowed to defeat the pre-\nsumption at the class certification stage through evidence\nthat the misrepresentation did not in fact affect the stock\nprice. We agree.\n                              1\n   There is no dispute that defendants may introduce such\nevidence at the merits stage to rebut the Basic presump-\ntion. Basic itself “made clear that the presumption was\njust that, and could be rebutted by appropriate evidence,”\nincluding evidence that the asserted misrepresentation (or\nits correction) did not affect the market price of the de-\nfendant’s stock. Halliburton I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n5); see Basic, supra, at 248.\n   Nor is there any dispute that defendants may introduce\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprice impact evidence at the class certification stage, so\nlong as it is for the purpose of countering a plaintiff’s\nshowing of market efficiency, rather than directly rebut-\nting the presumption. As EPJ Fund acknowledges, “[o]f\ncourse . . . defendants can introduce evidence at class\ncertification of lack of price impact as some evidence that\nthe market is not efficient.” Brief for Respondent 53. See\nalso Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26.\n   After all, plaintiffs themselves can and do introduce\nevidence of the existence of price impact in connection with\n“event studies”—regression analyses that seek to show\nthat the market price of the defendant’s stock tends to\nrespond to pertinent publicly reported events. See Brief\nfor Law Professors as Amici Curiae 25–28. In this case,\nfor example, EPJ Fund submitted an event study of vari-\nous episodes that might have been expected to affect the\nprice of Halliburton’s stock, in order to demonstrate that\nthe market for that stock takes account of material, public\ninformation about the company. See App. 217–230 (de-\nscribing the results of the study). The episodes examined\nby EPJ Fund’s event study included one of the alleged\nmisrepresentations that form the basis of the Fund’s suit.\nSee id., at 230, 343–344. See also In re Xcelera.com Secu-\nrities Litigation, 430 F. 3d 503, 513 (CA1 2005) (event\nstudy included effect of misrepresentation challenged in\nthe case).\n   Defendants—like plaintiffs—may accordingly submit\nprice impact evidence prior to class certification. What\ndefendants may not do, EPJ Fund insists and the Court of\nAppeals held, is rely on that same evidence prior to class\ncertification for the particular purpose of rebutting the\npresumption altogether.\n   This restriction makes no sense, and can readily lead to\nbizarre results. Suppose a defendant at the certification\nstage submits an event study looking at the impact on the\nprice of its stock from six discrete events, in an effort to\n20     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrefute the plaintiffs’ claim of general market efficiency.\nAll agree the defendant may do this. Suppose one of the\nsix events is the specific misrepresentation asserted by the\nplaintiffs. All agree that this too is perfectly acceptable.\nNow suppose the district court determines that, despite\nthe defendant’s study, the plaintiff has carried its burden\nto prove market efficiency, but that the evidence shows no\nprice impact with respect to the specific misrepresentation\nchallenged in the suit. The evidence at the certification\nstage thus shows an efficient market, on which the alleged\nmisrepresentation had no price impact. And yet under\nEPJ Fund’s view, the plaintiffs’ action should be certified\nand proceed as a class action (with all that entails), even\nthough the fraud-on-the-market theory does not apply and\ncommon reliance thus cannot be presumed.\n  Such a result is inconsistent with Basic’s own logic.\nUnder Basic’s fraud-on-the-market theory, market effi-\nciency and the other prerequisites for invoking the pre-\nsumption constitute an indirect way of showing price\nimpact. As explained, it is appropriate to allow plaintiffs\nto rely on this indirect proxy for price impact, rather than\nrequiring them to prove price impact directly, given\nBasic’s rationales for recognizing a presumption of reli-\nance in the first place. See supra, at 6–7, 16–17.\n  But an indirect proxy should not preclude direct evi-\ndence when such evidence is available. As we explained in\nBasic, “[a]ny showing that severs the link between the\nalleged misrepresentation and . . . the price received (or\npaid) by the plaintiff . . . will be sufficient to rebut the\npresumption of reliance” because “the basis for finding\nthat the fraud had been transmitted through market price\nwould be gone.” 485 U. S., at 248. And without the pre-\nsumption of reliance, a Rule 10b–5 suit cannot proceed as\na class action: Each plaintiff would have to prove reliance\nindividually, so common issues would not “predominate”\nover individual ones, as required by Rule 23(b)(3). Id., at\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n242. Price impact is thus an essential precondition for any\nRule 10b–5 class action. While Basic allows plaintiffs to\nestablish that precondition indirectly, it does not require\ncourts to ignore a defendant’s direct, more salient evidence\nshowing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually\naffect the stock’s market price and, consequently, that\nthe Basic presumption does not apply.\n                                2\n   The Court of Appeals relied on our decision in Amgen in\nholding that Halliburton could not introduce evidence of\nlack of price impact at the class certification stage. The\nquestion in Amgen was whether plaintiffs could be re-\nquired to prove (or defendants be permitted to disprove)\nmateriality before class certification. Even though mate-\nriality is a prerequisite for invoking the Basic presump-\ntion, we held that it should be left to the merits stage,\nbecause it does not bear on the predominance requirement\nof Rule 23(b)(3). We reasoned that materiality is an objec-\ntive issue susceptible to common, classwide proof. 568\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). We also noted that a failure\nto prove materiality would necessarily defeat every plain-\ntiff ’s claim on the merits; it would not simply preclude\ninvocation of the presumption and thereby cause individual\nquestions of reliance to predominate over common ones.\nIbid. See also id., at ___ (slip op., at 17–18). In this latter\nrespect, we explained, materiality differs from the publicity\nand market efficiency prerequisites, neither of which is\nnecessary to prove a Rule 10b–5 claim on the merits. Id.,\nat ___–___ (slip op., at 16–18).\n   EPJ Fund argues that much of the foregoing could be\nsaid of price impact as well. Fair enough. But price im-\npact differs from materiality in a crucial respect. Given\nthat the other Basic prerequisites must still be proved at\nthe class certification stage, the common issue of material-\nity can be left to the merits stage without risking the\n22     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncertification of classes in which individual issues will end\nup overwhelming common ones. And because materiality\nis a discrete issue that can be resolved in isolation from\nthe other prerequisites, it can be wholly confined to the\nmerits stage.\n   Price impact is different. The fact that a misrepresenta-\ntion “was reflected in the market price at the time of [the]\ntransaction”—that it had price impact—is “Basic’s funda-\nmental premise.” Halliburton I, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7). It thus has everything to do with the issue of pre-\ndominance at the class certification stage. That is why, if\nreliance is to be shown through the Basic presumption,\nthe publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be\nproved before class certification. Without proof of those\nprerequisites, the fraud-on-the-market theory underlying\nthe presumption completely collapses, rendering class\ncertification inappropriate.\n   But as explained, publicity and market efficiency are\nnothing more than prerequisites for an indirect showing of\nprice impact. There is no dispute that at least such indi-\nrect proof of price impact “is needed to ensure that the\nquestions of law or fact common to the class will ‘predomi-\nnate.’ ” Amgen, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis\ndeleted); see id., at ___ (slip op., at 16–17). That is so even\nthough such proof is also highly relevant at the merits\nstage.\n   Our choice in this case, then, is not between allowing\nprice impact evidence at the class certification stage or\nrelegating it to the merits. Evidence of price impact will\nbe before the court at the certification stage in any event.\nThe choice, rather, is between limiting the price impact\ninquiry before class certification to indirect evidence, or\nallowing consideration of direct evidence as well. As\nexplained, we see no reason to artificially limit the inquiry\nat the certification stage to indirect evidence of price\nimpact. Defendants may seek to defeat the Basic pre-\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

We adhere to that\ndecision and decline to modify the prerequisites for invok-\ning the presumption of reliance. But to maintain the\nconsistency of the presumption with the class certification\nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, de-\nfendants must be afforded an opportunity before class\ncertification to defeat the presumption through evidence\nthat an alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect\nthe market price of the stock.\n  Because the courts below denied Halliburton that oppor-\ntunity, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for\nthe Fifth Circuit and remand the case for further proceed-\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 75 (2001)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring); see, e.g., J. I. Case Co. v. Borak,\n377 U. S. 426, 433 (1964). We have since ended that\npractice because the authority to fashion private remedies\nto enforce federal law belongs to Congress alone. Stone-\nridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,\n552 U. S. 148, 164 (2008). Absent statutory authorization\nfor a cause of action, “courts may not create one, no matter\nhow desirable that might be as a policy matter.” Alexan-\nder v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286–287 (2001).\n   Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224 (1988), demon­\nstrates the wisdom of this rule. Basic presented the ques­\ntion how investors must prove the reliance element of the\nimplied Rule 10b–5 cause of action—the requirement that\nthe plaintiff buy or sell stock in reliance on the defendant’s\nmisstatement—when they transact on modern, impersonal\nsecurities exchanges. Were the Rule 10b–5 action statu-\ntory, the Court could have resolved this question by inter­\npreting the statutory language. Without a statute to\n2          HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninterpret for guidance, however, the Court began instead\nwith a particular policy “problem”: for investors in imper­\nsonal markets, the traditional reliance requirement was\nhard to prove and impossible to prove as common among\nplaintiffs bringing 10b–5 class-action suits. Id., at 242,\n245. With the task thus framed as “resol[ving]” that\n“ ‘problem’ ” rather than interpreting statutory text, id., at\n242, the Court turned to nascent economic theory and\nnaked intuitions about investment behavior in its efforts\nto fashion a new, easier way to meet the reliance require­\nment. The result was an evidentiary presumption, based\non a “fraud on the market” theory, that paved the way for\nclass actions under Rule 10b–5.\n   Today we are asked to determine whether Basic was\ncorrectly decided. The Court suggests that it was, and\nthat stare decisis demands that we preserve it. I disagree.\nLogic, economic realities, and our subsequent jurispru­\ndence have undermined the foundations of the Basic pre­\nsumption, and stare decisis cannot prop up the façade that\nremains. Basic should be overruled.\n                              I\n  Understanding where Basic went wrong requires an\nexplanation of the “reliance” requirement as traditionally\nunderstood.\n  “Reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant’s deceptive\nacts is an essential element” of the implied 10b–5 private\ncause of action.1 Stoneridge, supra, at 159. To prove\n\n——————\n    1 As\n       the private Rule 10b–5 action has evolved, the Court has drawn\non the common-law action of deceit to identify six elements a private\nplaintiff must prove: “ ‘(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by\nthe defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresenta­\ntion or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon\nthe misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss\ncausation.’ ” Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust\nFunds, 568 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2013) (slip op., at 3–4).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nreliance, the plaintiff must show “ ‘transaction causation,’ ”\ni.e., that the specific misstatement induced “the investor’s\ndecision to engage in the transaction.” Erica P. John\nFund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___–___\n(2011) (slip op., at 6–7). Such proof “ensures that there is\na proper ‘connection between a defendant’s misrepresenta­\ntion and a plaintiff ’s injury’ ”—namely, that the plaintiff\nhas not just lost money as a result of the misstatement,\nbut that he was actually defrauded by it. Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 4); see also Dirks v. SEC, 463 U. S. 646, 666–667, n.\n27 (1983) (“[T]o constitute a violation of Rule 10b–5, there\nmust be fraud. . . . [T]here always are winners and losers;\nbut those who have ‘lost’ have not necessarily been de­\nfrauded”). Without that connection, Rule 10b–5 is reduced\nto a “ ‘scheme of investor’s insurance,’ ” because a plaintiff\ncould recover whenever the defendant’s misstatement\ndistorted the stock price—regardless of whether the mis­\nstatement had actually tricked the plaintiff into buying (or\nselling) the stock in the first place. Dura Pharmaceuti-\ncals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 345 (2005) (quoting\nBasic, supra, at 252 (White, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part)).\n   The “traditional” reliance element requires a plaintiff to\n“sho[w] that he was aware of a company’s statement and\nengaged in a relevant transaction . . . based on that spe-\ncific misrepresentation.” Erica P. John Fund, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 4). But investors who purchase stock from\nthird parties on impersonal exchanges (e.g., the New York\nStock Exchange) often will not be aware of any particular\nstatement made by the issuer of the security, and there­\nfore cannot establish that they transacted based on a\nspecific misrepresentation. Nor is the traditional reliance\nrequirement amenable to class treatment; the inherently\nindividualized nature of the reliance inquiry renders it\nimpossible for a 10b–5 plaintiff to prove that common\nquestions predominate over individual ones, making class\n4       HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncertification improper. See Basic, supra, at 242; Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 23(b)(3).\n    Citing these difficulties of proof and class certification,\n485 U. S., at 242, 245, the Basic Court dispensed with the\ntraditional reliance requirement in favor of a new one\nbased on the fraud-on-the-market theory.2 The new ver­\nsion of reliance had two related parts.\n    First, Basic suggested that plaintiffs could meet the\nreliance requirement “ ‘indirectly,’ ” id., at 245. The Court\nreasoned that “ ‘ideally, [the market] transmits infor­\nmation to the investor in the processed form of a market\nprice.’ ” Id., at 244. An investor could thus be said to have\n“relied” on a specific misstatement if (1) the market had\nincorporated that statement into the market price of the\nsecurity, and (2) the investor then bought or sold that\nsecurity “in reliance on the integrity of the [market] price,”\nid., at 247, i.e., based on his belief that the market price\n“ ‘reflect[ed]’ ” the stock’s underlying “ ‘value,’ ” id., at 244.\n    Second, Basic created a presumption that this “indirect”\nform of “reliance” had been proved. Based primarily on\ncertain assumptions about economic theory and investor\nbehavior, Basic afforded plaintiffs who traded in efficient\nmarkets an evidentiary presumption that both steps of the\nnovel reliance requirement had been satisfied—that (1)\nthe market had incorporated the specific misstatement\ninto the market price of the security, and (2) the plaintiff\n\n——————\n   2 In the years preceding Basic, lower courts and commentators exper­\n\nimented with various ways to facilitate 10b–5 class actions by relaxing\nor eliminating the reliance element of the implied 10b–5 action. See,\ne.g., Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F. 2d 891 (CA9 1975); Note, The Fraud-on­\nthe-Market Theory, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1143 (1982); Note, The Reliance\nRequirement in Private Actions under SEC Rule 10b–5, 88 Harv. L.\nRev. 584, 592–606 (1975). The “fraud-on-the-market theory” is an\numbrella term for those varied efforts.

A defendant was ostensibly entitled to rebut the\npresumption by putting forth evidence that either of those\nsteps was absent. Id., at 248.\n                              II\n  Basic’s reimagined reliance requirement was a mistake,\nand the passage of time has compounded its failings.\nFirst, the Court based both parts of the presumption of\nreliance on a questionable understanding of disputed\neconomic theory and flawed intuitions about investor\nbehavior. Second, Basic’s rebuttable presumption is at\nodds with our subsequent Rule 23 cases, which require\nplaintiffs seeking class certification to “ ‘affirmatively\ndemonstrate’ ” certification requirements like the predom­\ninance of common questions. Comcast Corp. v. Behrend,\n569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n10)). Finally, Basic’s presumption that investors rely on\nthe integrity of the market price is virtually irrebuttable\nin practice, which means that the “essential” reliance\nelement effectively exists in name only.\n                             A\n   Basic based the presumption of reliance on two factual\nassumptions. The first assumption was that, in a “well­\ndeveloped market,” public statements are generally “re­\nflected” in the market price of securities. 485 U. S., at\n247. The second was that investors in such markets\ntransact “in reliance on the integrity of that price.” Ibid.\n\n——————\n  3 An investor could invoke this presumption by demonstrating certain\n\npredicates: (1) a public statement; (2) an efficient market; (3) that the\nshares were traded after the statement was made but before the truth\nwas revealed; and (4) that the statement was material. Basic, 485\nU. S., at 248, n. 27.\n6       HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nIn other words, the Court created a presumption that a\nplaintiff had met the two-part, fraud-on-the-market ver­\nsion of the reliance requirement because, in the Court’s\nview, “common sense and probability” suggested that each\nof those parts would be met. Id., at 246.\n   In reality, both of the Court’s key assumptions are\nhighly contestable and do not provide the necessary sup­\nport for Basic’s presumption of reliance. The first assump­\ntion—that public statements are “reflected” in the market\nprice—was grounded in an economic theory that has\ngarnered substantial criticism since Basic. The second as-\nsumption—that investors categorically rely on the integrity\nof the market price—is simply wrong.\n                             1\n   The Court’s first assumption was that “most publicly\navailable information”—including public misstatements—\n“is reflected in [the] market price” of a security. Id., at\n247. The Court grounded that assumption in “empirical\nstudies” testing a then-nascent economic theory known as\nthe efficient capital markets hypothesis. Id., at 246–247.\nSpecifically, the Court relied upon the “semi-strong” ver­\nsion of that theory, which posits that the average investor\ncannot earn above-market returns (i.e., “beat the market”)\nin an efficient market by trading on the basis of publicly\navailable information. See, e.g., Stout, The Mechanisms of\nMarket Inefficiency: An Introduction to the New Finance,\n28 J. Corp. L. 635, 640, and n. 24 (2003) (citing Fama,\nEfficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empir­\nical Work, 25 J. Finance 383, 388 (1970)).4 The upshot of\n——————\n  4 The “weak form” of the hypothesis provides that an investor cannot\n\nearn an above-market return by trading on historical price data. See\nDunbar & Heller, Fraud on the Market Meets Behavioral Finance, 31\nDel. J. Corporate L. 455, 463–464 (2006) (hereinafter Dunbar & Heller).\nThe “strong form” provides that investors cannot achieve above-market\nreturns even by trading on nonpublic information. See ibid.

At the time of Basic,\nthis version of the efficient capital markets hypothesis was\n“widely accepted.” See Dunbar & Heller 463–464.\n   This view of market efficiency has since lost its luster.\nSee, e.g., Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking Fraud\non the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 175 (“Doubts about\nthe strength and pervasiveness of market efficiency are\nmuch greater today than they were in the mid-1980s”). As\nit turns out, even “well-developed” markets (like the New\nYork Stock Exchange) do not uniformly incorporate infor­\nmation into market prices with high speed. “[F]riction in\naccessing public information” and the presence of “pro­\ncessing costs” means that “not all public information will\nbe impounded in a security’s price with the same alacrity,\nor perhaps with any quickness at all.” Cox, Understand­\ning Causation in Private Securities Lawsuits: Building on\nAmgen, 66 Vand. L. Rev. 1719, 1732 (2013) (hereinafter\nCox). For example, information that is easily digestible\n(merger announcements or stock splits) or especially\nprominent (Wall Street Journal articles) may be incorpo­\nrated quickly, while information that is broadly applicable\nor technical (Securities and Exchange Commission filings)\nmay be incorporated slowly or even ignored. See Stout,\nsupra, at 653–656; see e.g., In re Merck & Co. Securities\nLitigation, 432 F. 3d 261, 263–265 (CA3 2005) (a Wall\nStreet Journal article caused a steep decline in the com­\npany’s stock price even though the same information was\ncontained in an earlier SEC disclosure).\n   Further, and more importantly, “overwhelming empiri­\ncal evidence” now suggests that even when markets do\nincorporate public information, they often fail to do so\n—————— \n\nform is generally accepted; the strong form is not. See ibid.\n\n8      HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\naccurately. Lev and de Villiers, Stock Price Crashes and\n10b–5 Damages: A Legal, Economic and Policy Analysis,\n47 Stan. L. Rev. 7, 20–21 (1994); see also id., at 21 (“That\nmany share price movements seem unrelated to specific\ninformation strongly suggests that capital markets are not\nfundamentally efficient, and that wide deviations from\nfundamentals . . . can occur”(footnote omitted)). “Scores”\nof “efficiency-defying anomalies”—such as market swings\nin the absence of new information and prolonged devia­\ntions from underlying asset values—make market efficiency\n“more contestable than ever.” Langevoort, Taming the\nAnimal Spirits of the Stock Markets: A Behavioral Ap­\nproach to Securities Regulation, 97 Nw. U. L. Rev. 135,\n141 (2002); Dunbar & Heller 476–483. Such anomalies\nmake it difficult to tell whether, at any given moment, a\nstock’s price accurately reflects its value as indicated by\nall publicly available information. In sum, economists\nnow understand that the price impact Basic assumed\nwould happen reflexively is actually far from certain even\nin “well-developed” markets. Thus, Basic’s claim that\n“common sense and probability” support a presumption of\nreliance rests on shaky footing.\n                                2\n   The Basic Court also grounded the presumption of\nreliance in a second assumption: that “[a]n investor who\nbuys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in\nreliance on the integrity of that price.” 485 U. S., at 247.\nIn other words, the Court assumed that investors transact\nbased on the belief that the market price accurately re­\nflects the underlying “ ‘value’ ” of the security. See id., at\n244 (“ ‘[P]urchasers generally rely on the price of the stock\nas a reflection of its value’ ”). The Basic Court appears to\nhave adopted this assumption about investment behavior\nbased only on what it believed to be “common sense.” Id.,\nat 246. The Court found it “ ‘hard to imagine that there\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\never is a buyer or seller who does not rely on market in­\ntegrity. Who would knowingly roll the dice in a crooked\ncrap game?’ ” Id., at 246–247.\n   The Court’s rather superficial analysis does not with­\nstand scrutiny. It cannot be seriously disputed that a\ngreat many investors do not buy or sell stock based on a\nbelief that the stock’s price accurately reflects its value.\nMany investors in fact trade for the opposite reason—that\nis, because they think the market has under- or overval­\nued the stock, and they believe they can profit from that\nmispricing. Id., at 256 (opinion of White, J.); see, e.g.,\nMacey, The Fraud on the Market Theory: Some Prelimi­\nnary Issues, 74 Cornell L. Rev. 923, 925 (1989) (The “op­\nposite” of Basic’s assumption appears to be true; some\ninvestors “attempt to locate undervalued stocks in an\neffort to ‘beat the market’ . . . in essence betting that the\nmarket . . . is in fact inefficient”). Indeed, securities\ntransactions often take place because the transacting\nparties disagree on the security’s value. See, e.g., Stout,\nAre Stock Markets Costly Casinos? Disagreement, Mar-\nket Failure, and Securities Regulation, 81 Va. L. Rev.\n611, 619 (1995) (“[A]vailable evidence suggests that . . . in-\nvestor disagreement inspires the lion’s share of equities\ntransactions”).\n   Other investors trade for reasons entirely unrelated to\nprice—for instance, to address changing liquidity needs,\ntax concerns, or portfolio balancing requirements. See id.,\nat 657–658; see also Cox 1739 (investors may purchase\n“due to portfolio rebalancing arising from its obeisance to\nan indexing strategy”). These investment decisions—\nmade with indifference to price and thus without regard\nfor price “integrity”—are at odds with Basic’s understand­\ning of what motivates investment decisions. In short,\nBasic’s assumption that all investors rely in common on\n10       HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n“price integrity” is simply wrong.5\n   The majority tries (but fails) to reconcile Basic’s as­\nsumption about investor behavior with the reality that\nmany investors do not behave in the way Basic assumed.\nIt first asserts that Basic rested only on the more modest\nview that “ ‘most investors’ ” rely on the integrity of a\nsecurity’s market price. Ante, at 12 (quoting not Basic, but\nAmgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust\nFunds, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5) (emphasis\nadded)). That gloss is difficult to square with Basic’s plain\nlanguage: “An investor who buys or sells stock at the price\nset by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of\nthat price.” Basic, 458 U. S., at 247; see also id., at 246–\n247 (“ ‘[I]t is hard to imagine that there ever is a buyer or\nseller who does not rely on market integrity’ ”). In any\nevent, neither Basic nor the majority offers anything more\nthan a judicial hunch as evidence that even “most” inves­\ntors rely on price integrity.\n   The majority also suggests that “there is no reason to\nsuppose” that investors who buy stock they believe to be\nundervalued are “indifferent to the integrity of market\nprices.” Ante, at 12. Such “value investor[s],” according to\nthe majority, “implicitly rel[y] on the fact that a stock’s\nmarket price will eventually reflect material information”\n——————\n  5 The Basic Court’s mistaken intuition about investor behavior ap­\n\npears to involve a category mistake: the Court invoked a hypothesis\nmeant to describe markets, but then used it “in the one way it is not\nmeant to be used: as a predictor of the behavior of individual investors.”\nLangevoort, Theories, Assumptions, and Securities Regulation: Market\nEfficiency Revisited, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 851, 895 (1992). The efficient\ncapital markets hypothesis does not describe “how investors behave; [it]\nonly suggests the consequences of their collective behavior.” Cox 1736.\n“Nothing in the hypothesis denies what most popular accounts assume:\nthat much information searching and trading by investors, from insti­\ntutions on down, is done in the (perhaps erroneous) belief that under­\nvalued or overvalued stocks exist and can systematically be discovered.”\nLangevoort, Theories, supra, at 895.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand “presumably tr[y] to estimate how undervalued or\novervalued a particular stock is” by reference to the mar­\nket price. Ibid. Whether the majority’s unsupported\nclaims about the thought processes of hypothetical inves­\ntors are accurate or not, they are surely beside the point.\nWhatever else an investor believes about the market, he\nsimply does not “rely on the integrity of the market price”\nif he does not believe that the market price accurately\nreflects public information at the time he transacts. That\nis, an investor cannot claim that a public misstatement\ninduced his transaction by distorting the market price if\nhe did not buy at that price while believing that it accu­\nrately incorporated that public information. For that sort\nof investor, Basic’s critical fiction falls apart.\n                               B\n    Basic’s presumption of reliance also conflicts with our\nmore recent cases clarifying Rule 23’s class-certification\nrequirements. Those cases instruct that “a party seeking\nto maintain a class action ‘must affirmatively demonstrate\nhis compliance’ with Rule 23.” Comcast, 569 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 5) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10). To prevail on a motion for class certification, a\nparty must demonstrate through “evidentiary proof ” that\n“ ‘questions of law or fact common to class members pre­\ndominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers.’ ” 569 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5–6) (quoting\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3)).\n    Basic permits plaintiffs to bypass that requirement of\nevidentiary proof. Under Basic, plaintiffs who invoke the\npresumption of reliance (by proving its predicates) are\ndeemed to have met the predominance requirement of\nRule 23(b)(3). See ante, at 14; Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (Basic “facilitates class certification by recogniz­\ning a rebuttable presumption of classwide reliance”);\nBasic, 485 U. S., at 242, 250 (holding that the District\n12       HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCourt appropriately certified the class based on the pre­\nsumption of reliance). But, invoking the Basic presump­\ntion does not actually prove that individual questions of\nreliance will not overwhelm the common questions in the\ncase. Basic still requires a showing that the individual\ninvestor bought or sold in reliance on the integrity of the\nmarket price and, crucially, permits defendants to rebut\nthe presumption by producing evidence that individual\nplaintiffs do not meet that description. See id., at 249\n(“Petitioners . . . could rebut the presumption of reliance\nas to plaintiffs who would have divested themselves of\ntheir Basic shares without relying on the integrity of the\nmarket”). Thus, by its own terms, Basic entitles defend­\nants to ask each class member whether he traded in reli­\nance on the integrity of the market price. That inquiry,\nlike the traditional reliance inquiry, is inherently individ­\nualized; questions about the trading strategies of individ­\nual investors will not generate “ ‘common answers apt to\ndrive the resolution of the litigation,’ ” Wal-Mart Stores,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 10). See supra, at 8–9; see also\nCox 1736, n. 55 (Basic’s recognition that defendants could\nrebut the presumption “by proof the investor would have\ntraded anyway appears to require individual inquiries into\nreliance”).\n   Basic thus exempts Rule 10b–5 plaintiffs from Rule 23’s\nproof requirement. Plaintiffs who invoke the presumption\nof reliance are deemed to have shown predominance as a\nmatter of law, even though the resulting rebuttable pre­\nsumption leaves individualized questions of reliance in the\ncase and predominance still unproved. Needless to say,\nthat exemption was beyond the Basic Court’s power to\ngrant.6\n——————\n  6 The majority suggests that Basic squares with Comcast Corp. v.\n\nBehrend, 569 U.

But in practice, the so-called “rebut­\ntable presumption” is largely irrebuttable.\n   The Basic Court ostensibly afforded defendants an\nopportunity to rebut the presumption by providing evi­\ndence that either aspect of a plaintiff ’s fraud-on-the­\nmarket reliance—price impact, or reliance on the integrity\nof the market price—is missing. 485 U. S., at 248–249. As\nit turns out, however, the realities of class-action proce­\ndure make rebuttal based on an individual plaintiff ’s lack\nof reliance virtually impossible. At the class-certification\nstage, rebuttal is only directed at the class representa­\ntives, which means that counsel only needs to find one\nclass member who can withstand the challenge. See\nGrundfest, Damages and Reliance Under Section 10(b) of\nthe Exchange Act, 69 Bus. Lawyer 307, 362 (2014). After\nclass certification, courts have refused to allow defendants\nto challenge any plaintiff ’s reliance on the integrity of the\nmarket price prior to a determination on classwide liabil­\nity. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United\nStates of America et al. as Amici Curiae 13–14 (collecting\ncases rejecting postcertification attempts to rebut individ­\nual class members’ reliance on price integrity as not perti­\nnent to classwide liability). One search for rebuttals on\nindividual-reliance grounds turned up only six cases out of\nthe thousands of Rule 10b–5 actions brought since Basic. \n\nGrundfest, supra, at 360.7\n\n—————— \n\nproving . . . predominance” but “rather sets forth what they must prove\nto demonstrate such predominance.” Ante, at 14–15. This argument\nmisses the point. Because Basic offers defendants a chance to rebut the\npresumption on individualized grounds, the predicates that Basic sets\nforth as sufficient to invoke the presumption do not necessarily prove\npredominance.\n  7 The absence of postcertification rebuttal is likely attributable in\n\npart to the substantial in terrorem settlement pressures brought to bear\n14       HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n                   THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n    The apparent unavailability of this form of rebuttal has\ntroubling implications. Because the presumption is con­\nclusive in practice with respect to investors’ reliance on\nprice integrity, even Basic’s watered-down reliance re­\nquirement has been effectively eliminated. Once the\npresumption attaches, the reliance element is no longer an\nobstacle to prevailing on the claim, even though many\nclass members will not have transacted in reliance on\nprice integrity, see supra, at 8–9. And without a func-\ntional reliance requirement, the “essential element” that\nensures the plaintiff has actually been defrauded, see\nStoneridge, 552 U. S., at 159, Rule 10b–5 becomes the very\n“ ‘scheme of investor’s insurance’ ” the rebuttable presump­\ntion was supposed to prevent. See Basic, supra, at 252\n(opinion of White, J.).8\n                         *   *     *\n   For these reasons, Basic should be overruled in favor of\nthe straightforward rule that “[r]eliance by the plaintiff\nupon the defendant’s deceptive acts”—actual reliance, not\nthe fictional “fraud-on-the-market” version—“is an essen­\ntial element of the §10(b) private cause of action.” Stone-\nridge, 552 U. S., at 159.\n——————\nby certification. See, e.g., Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of\nAggregate Proof, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 97, 99 (2009) (“With vanishingly\nrare exception, class certification sets the litigation on a path toward res­\nolution by way of settlement, not full-fledged testing of the plaintiffs’ case\nby trial”); see also Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-\nAtlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 163 (2008) (“[E]xtensive discovery and\nthe potential for uncertainty and disruption in a lawsuit allow plaintiffs\nwith weak claims to extort settlements from innocent companies”).\n  8 Of course, today’s decision makes clear that a defendant may rebut\n\nthe presumption by producing evidence that the misstatement at issue\nfailed to affect the market price of the security, see ante, at 17–22. But\nboth parts of Basic’s version of reliance are key to its fiction that an\ninvestor has “indirectly” relied on the misstatement; the unavailability\nof rebuttal with respect to one of those parts still functionally removes\nreliance as an element of proof.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

We have\nnot hesitated to overrule decisions when they are “un­\nworkable or are badly reasoned,” Payne v. Tennessee, 501\nU. S. 808, 827 (1991); when “the theoretical underpinnings\nof those decisions are called into serious question,” State\nOil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 21 (1997); when the decisions\nhave become “irreconcilable” with intervening develop­\nments in “competing legal doctrines or policies,” Patterson\nv. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989); or\nwhen they are otherwise “a positive detriment to coher­\nence and consistency in the law,” ibid. Just one of these\ncircumstances can justify our correction of bad precedent;\nBasic checks all the boxes.\n   In support of its decision to preserve Basic, the majority\ncontends that stare decisis “has ‘special force’ ‘in respect to\nstatutory interpretation’ because ‘Congress remains free to\nalter what we have done.’ ” Ante, at 12 (quoting John R.\nSand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 139\n(2008); some internal quotation marks omitted). But\nBasic, of course, has nothing to do with statutory interpre­\ntation. The case concerned a judge-made evidentiary\npresumption for a judge-made element of the implied\n10b−5 private cause of action, itself “a judicial construct\nthat Congress did not enact in the text of the relevant\nstatutes.” Stoneridge, supra, at 164. We have not afforded\nstare decisis “special force” outside the context of statu-\ntory interpretation, see Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian\nCommunity, 572 U. S. ___, ___, n. 6 (2014) (THOMAS, J.\ndissenting) (slip op., at 15, n. 6 and for good reason. In\nstatutory cases, it is perhaps plausible that Congress\nwatches over its enactments and will step in to fix our\nmistakes, so we may leave to Congress the judgment\nwhether the interpretive question is better left “ ‘settled’ ”\nor “ ‘settled right,’ ” Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier\n16     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nTariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986). But this\nrationale is untenable when it comes to judge-made law\nlike “implied” private causes of action, which we retain a\nduty to superintend. See, e.g., Exxon Shipping Co. v.\nBaker, 554 U. S. 471, 507 (2008) (“[T]he judiciary [cannot]\nwash its hands of a problem it created . . . simply by call­\ning [the judicial doctrine] legislative”). Thus, when we err\nin areas of judge-made law, we ought to presume that\nCongress expects us to correct our own mistakes—not the\nother way around. That duty is especially clear in the\nRule 10b–5 context, where we have said that “[t]he federal\ncourts have accepted and exercised the principal responsi­\nbility for the continuing elaboration of the scope of the\n10b–5 right and the definition of the duties it imposes.”\nMusick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508\nU. S. 286, 292 (1993).\n   Basic’s presumption of reliance remains our mistake to\ncorrect. Since Basic, Congress has enacted two major\nsecurities laws: the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737, and the Securities\nLitigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), 112\nStat. 3227. The PSLRA “sought to combat perceived\nabuses in securities litigation,” ante, at 15, and SLUSA\nprevented plaintiffs from avoiding the PSLRA’s re­\nstrictions by bringing class actions in state court, ibid.\nNeither of these Acts touched the reliance element of the\nimplied Rule 10b–5 private cause of action or the Basic\npresumption.\n   Contrary to respondent’s argument (the majority wisely\nskips this next line of defense), we cannot draw from\nCongress’ silence on this matter an inference that Con­\ngress approved of Basic. To begin with, it is inappropriate\nto give weight to “Congress’ unenacted opinion” when\nconstruing judge-made doctrines, because doing so allows\nthe Court to create law and then “effectively codif[y]” it\n“based only on Congress’ failure to address it.” Bay Mills,\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            17\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsupra, at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 14).\nOur Constitution, however, demands that laws be passed\nby Congress and signed by the President. U. S. Const.,\nArt. I, §7. Adherence to Basic based on congressional\ninaction would invert that requirement by insulating error\nfrom correction merely because Congress failed to pass a\nlaw on the subject. Cf. Patterson, supra, at 175, n. 1\n(“Congressional inaction cannot amend a duly enacted\nstatute”).\n   At any rate, arguments from legislative inaction are\nspeculative at best. “[I]t is ‘ “impossible to assert with any\ndegree of assurance that congressional failure to act rep­\nresents” affirmative congressional approval of ’ one of this\nCourt’s decisions.” Bay Mills, supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Patterson, supra, at\n175, n. 1). “ ‘Congressional inaction lacks persuasive\nsignificance’ ” because it is indeterminate; “ ‘several equally\ntenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction.’ ”\nCentral Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 187 (1994) (quoting Pension\nBenefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633,\n650 (1990)). Therefore, “[i]t does not follow . . . that Con­\ngress’ failure to overturn a . . . precedent is reason for this\nCourt to adhere to it.” Patterson, supra, at 175, n. 1.\n   That is especially true here, because Congress passed a\nlaw to tell us not to draw any inference from its inaction.\nThe PSLRA expressly states that “[n]othing in this Act . . .\nshall be deemed to create or ratify any implied private\nright of action.” Notes following 15 U. S. C. §78j–1, p. 430.\nIf the Act did not ratify even the Rule 10b–5 private cause\nof action, it cannot be read to ratify sub silentio the pre­\nsumption of reliance this Court affixed to that action.\nFurther, the PSLRA and SLUSA operate to curtail abuses\nof various private causes of action under our securities\nlaws—hardly an indication that Congress approved of\nBasic’s expansion of the 10b–5 private cause of action.\n18     HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCongress’ failure to overturn Basic does not permit us to\n“place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the\nCourt’s own error.” Girouard v.

The result was an unrecognizably broad cause\nof action ready made for class certification. Time and\nexperience have pointed up the error of that decision,\nmaking it all too clear that the Court’s attempt to revise\nsecurities law to fit the alleged “new realities of financial\nmarkets” should have been left to Congress. 485 U.
