Argued April 2, 2014—Decided June 25, 2014\nPetitioner Fifth Third Bancorp maintains a defined-contribution re-\n  tirement savings plan for its employees. Plan participants may di-\n  rect their contributions into any of a number of investment options,\n  including an “employee stock ownership plan” (ESOP), which invests\n  its funds primarily in Fifth Third stock. Respondents, former Fifth\n  Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this lawsuit against\n  petitioners, Fifth Third and several of its officers who are alleged to\n  be fiduciaries of the ESOP. The complaint alleges that petitioners\n  breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee\n  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C.\n  §1104(a)(1)(B). Specifically, the complaint alleges that petitioners\n  should have known—on the basis of both publicly available infor-\n  mation and inside information available to petitioners because they\n  were Fifth Third officers—that Fifth Third stock was overpriced and\n  excessively risky. It further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in peti-\n  tioners’ position would have responded to this information by selling\n  off the ESOP’s holdings of Fifth Third stock, refraining from purchas-\n  ing more Fifth Third stock, or disclosing the negative inside infor-\n  mation so that the market could correct the stock’s price downward.\n  According to the complaint, petitioners did none of these things, and\n  the price of Fifth Third stock ultimately fell, reducing respondents’\n  retirement savings. The District Court dismissed the complaint for\n  failure to state a claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed. It concluded\n  that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a “presumption of prudence”\n  that does not apply to other ERISA fiduciaries but that the presump-\n  tion is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the plead-\n  ing stage. The court went on to hold that the complaint stated a\n2            FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    claim for breach of fiduciary duty.\nHeld:\n    1. ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of\n prudence. Rather, they are subject to the same duty of prudence that\n applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, §1104(a)(1)(B), except that\n they need not diversify the fund’s assets, §1104(a)(2). This conclusion\n follows from the relevant provisions of ERISA. Section 1104(a)(1)(B)\n “imposes a ‘prudent person’ standard by which to measure fiduciar-\n ies’ investment decisions and disposition of assets.” Massachusetts\n Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 143, n. 10. Section\n 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets.\n And §1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loos-\n ened in the ESOP context by providing that “the diversification re-\n quirement of [§1104(a)(1)(C)] and the prudence requirement (only to\n the extent that it requires diversification) of [§1104(a)(1)(B)] [are] not\n violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].” Section\n 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special “presumption” in favor of\n ESOP fiduciaries and does not require plaintiffs to allege that the\n employer was, e.g., on the “brink of collapse.” It simply modifies the\n duties imposed by §1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way. Thus,\n aside from the fact that ESOP fiduciaries are not liable for losses that\n result from a failure to diversify, they are subject to the duty of pru-\n dence like other ERISA fiduciaries. Pp. 4–15.\n    2. On remand, the Sixth Circuit should reconsider whether the\n complaint states a claim by applying the pleading standard as dis-\n cussed in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 677–680, and Bell Atlantic\n Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 554–563, in light of the following\n considerations. Pp. 15–20.\n       (a) Where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary\n should have recognized on the basis of publicly available information\n that the market was overvaluing or undervaluing the stock are gen-\n erally implausible and thus insufficient to state a claim under\n Twombly and Iqbal. Pp. 16–18.\n       (b) To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence, a com-\n plaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant\n could have taken, that would have been legal, and that a prudent fi-\n duciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more\n likely to harm the fund than to help it. Where the complaint alleges\n that a fiduciary was imprudent in failing to act on the basis of inside\n information, the analysis is informed by the following points. First,\n ERISA’s duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law,\n and so a fiduciary cannot be imprudent for failing to buy or sell stock\n in violation of the insider trading laws. Second, where a complaint\n faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, based on negative inside infor-\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  mation, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for fail-\n  ing to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no\n  longer be overvalued, courts should consider the extent to which im-\n  posing an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain from making a\n  planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could\n  conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure re-\n  quirements set forth by the federal securities laws or with the objec-\n  tives of those laws. Third, courts confronted with such claims should\n  consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent\n  fiduciary in the defendant’s position could not have concluded that\n  stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would\n  do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock\n  price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by\n  the fund.

S. C. §1001 et\nseq., requires the fiduciary of a pension plan to act pru-\ndently in managing the plan’s assets. §1104(a)(1)(B). This\ncase focuses upon that duty of prudence as applied to the\nfiduciary of an “employee stock ownership plan” (ESOP), a\ntype of pension plan that invests primarily in the stock of\nthe company that employs the plan participants.\n   We consider whether, when an ESOP fiduciary’s deci-\nsion to buy or hold the employer’s stock is challenged in\ncourt, the fiduciary is entitled to a defense-friendly stand-\nard that the lower courts have called a “presumption of\nprudence.” The Courts of Appeals that have considered\nthe question have held that such a presumption does\napply, with the presumption generally defined as a re-\nquirement that the plaintiff make a showing that would\nnot be required in an ordinary duty-of-prudence case, such\nas that the employer was on the brink of collapse.\n   We hold that no such presumption applies. Instead,\nESOP fiduciaries are subject to the same duty of prudence\n2        FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, except that\nthey need not diversify the fund’s assets. §1104(a)(2).\n                             I\n   Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp, a large financial ser-\nvices firm, maintains for its employees a defined-\ncontribution retirement savings plan. Employees may\nchoose to contribute a portion of their compensation to the\nPlan as retirement savings, and Fifth Third provides\nmatching contributions of up to 4% of an employee’s com-\npensation. The Plan’s assets are invested in 20 separate\nfunds, including mutual funds and an ESOP. Plan partic-\nipants can allocate their contributions among the funds\nhowever they like; Fifth Third’s matching contributions,\non the other hand, are always invested initially in the\nESOP, though the participant can then choose to move\nthem to another fund. The Plan requires the ESOP’s\nfunds to be “invested primarily in shares of common stock\nof Fifth Third.” App. 350.\n   Respondents, who are former Fifth Third employees and\nESOP participants, filed this putative class action in\nFederal District Court in Ohio. They claim that petition-\ners, Fifth Third and various Fifth Third officers, were\nfiduciaries of the Plan and violated the duties of loyalty\nand prudence imposed by ERISA.             See §§1109(a),\n1132(a)(2). We limit our review to the duty-of-prudence\nclaims.\n   The complaint alleges that by July 2007, the fiduciaries\nknew or should have known that Fifth Third’s stock was\novervalued and excessively risky for two separate reasons.\nFirst, publicly available information such as newspaper\narticles provided early warning signs that subprime lend-\ning, which formed a large part of Fifth Third’s business,\nwould soon leave creditors high and dry as the housing\nmarket collapsed and subprime borrowers became unable\nto pay off their mortgages. Second, nonpublic information\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(which petitioners knew because they were Fifth Third\ninsiders) indicated that Fifth Third officers had deceived\nthe market by making material misstatements about the\ncompany’s financial prospects. Those misstatements led\nthe market to overvalue Fifth Third stock—the ESOP’s\nprimary investment—and so petitioners, using the partic-\nipants’ money, were consequently paying more for that\nstock than it was worth.\n   The complaint further alleges that a prudent fiduciary\nin petitioners’ position would have responded to this in-\nformation in one or more of the following ways: (1) by\nselling the ESOP’s holdings of Fifth Third stock before the\nvalue of those holdings declined, (2) by refraining from\npurchasing any more Fifth Third stock, (3) by canceling\nthe Plan’s ESOP option, and (4) by disclosing the inside\ninformation so that the market would adjust its valuation\nof Fifth Third stock downward and the ESOP would no\nlonger be overpaying for it.\n   Rather than follow any of these courses of action, peti-\ntioners continued to hold and buy Fifth Third stock. Then\nthe market crashed, and Fifth Third’s stock price fell by\n74% between July 2007 and September 2009, when the\ncomplaint was filed. Since the ESOP’s funds were invested\nprimarily in Fifth Third stock, this fall in price elimi-\nnated a large part of the retirement savings that the\nparticipants had invested in the ESOP. (The stock has\nsince made a partial recovery to around half of its July\n2007 price.)\n   The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to\nstate a claim. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2469525\"><a href=\"/ohsd/dE72/dudenhoeffer-v-fifth-third-bancorp/\"><span class=\"volume\">757</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The\ncourt began from the premise that where a lawsuit chal-\nlenges ESOP fiduciaries’ investment decisions, “the plan\nfiduciaries start with a presumption that their ‘decision to\nremain invested in employer securities was reasonable.’ ”\nId., at 758 (quoting Kuper v.

Supp. 2d, at 758–759, 760–762.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. 692\nF. 3d 410 (2012). Although it agreed that ESOP fiduciar-\nies are entitled to a presumption of prudence, it took the\nview that the presumption is evidentiary only and there-\nfore does not apply at the pleading stage. Id., at 418–419.\nThus, the Sixth Circuit simply asked whether the allega-\ntions in the complaint were sufficient to state a claim for\nbreach of fiduciary duty. Id., at 419. It held that they\nwere. Id., at 419–420.\n   In light of differences among the Courts of Appeals as to\nthe nature of the presumption of prudence applicable to\nESOP fiduciaries, we granted the fiduciaries’ petition for\ncertiorari.

On\nthe one hand, ERISA itself subjects pension plan fiduciar-\nies to a duty of prudence. In a section titled “Fiduciary\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559,\n570 (1985) (Section 1104(a)(1) imposes “strict standards of\ntrustee conduct . . . derived from the common law of\ntrusts—most prominently, a standard of loyalty and a\nstandard of care”).\n  On the other hand, Congress recognizes that ESOPs are\n“designed to invest primarily in” the stock of the partici-\npants’ employer, §1107(d)(6)(A), meaning that they are not\nprudently diversified. And it has written into law its\n6        FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“interest in encouraging” their use. One statutory provi-\nsion says:\n      “INTENT OF CONGRESS CONCERNING EMPLOYEE\n    STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS.—The Congress, in a series\n    of laws [including ERISA] has made clear its interest\n    in encouraging [ESOPs] as a bold and innovative\n    method of strengthening the free private enterprise\n    system which will solve the dual problems of securing\n    capital funds for necessary capital growth and of\n    bringing about stock ownership by all corporate em-\n    ployees. The Congress is deeply concerned that the\n    objectives sought by this series of laws will be made\n    unattainable by regulations and rulings which treat\n    [ESOPs] as conventional retirement plans, which re-\n    duce the freedom of the employee trusts and employ-\n    ers to take the necessary steps to implement the\n    plans, and which otherwise block the establishment\n    and success of these plans.” Tax Reform Act of 1976,\n    §803(h), 90 Stat. 1590.\n   In addition, and in keeping with this statement of in-\ntent, Congress has given ESOP fiduciaries a statutory\nexemption from some of the duties imposed on ERISA\nfiduciaries. ERISA specifically provides that, in the case\nof ESOPs and other eligible individual account plans,\n    “the diversification requirement of [§1104(a)(1)(C)]\n    and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that\n    it requires diversification) of [§1104(a)(1)(B)] [are] not\n    violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].”\n    §1104(a)(2).\nThus, an ESOP fiduciary is not obliged under\n§1104(a)(1)(C) to “diversif[y] the investments of the plan\nso as to minimize the risk of large losses” or under\n§1104(a)(1)(B) to act “with the care, skill, prudence, and\ndiligence” of a “prudent man” insofar as that duty “re-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nquires diversification.”\n                              B\n   Several Courts of Appeals have gone beyond ERISA’s\nexpress provision that ESOP fiduciaries need not diversify\nby giving ESOP fiduciaries a “presumption of prudence”\nwhen their decisions to hold or buy employer stock are\nchallenged as imprudent. Thus, the Third Circuit has\nheld that “an ESOP fiduciary who invests the [ESOP’s]\nassets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that\nit acted consistently with ERISA” in doing so. Moench v.\nRobertson, 62 F. 3d 553, 571 (1995). The Ninth Circuit\nhas said that to “overcome the presumption of prudent\ninvestment, plaintiffs must . . . make allegations that\nclearly implicate the company’s viability as an ongoing\nconcern or show a precipitous decline in the employer’s\nstock . . . combined with evidence that the company is on\nthe brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanage-\nment.” Quan v. Computer Sciences Corp., 623 F. 3d 870,\n882 (2010) (brackets and internal quotation marks omit-\nted). And the Seventh Circuit has described the presump-\ntion as requiring plaintiffs to “allege and ultimately prove\nthat the company faced ‘impending collapse’ or ‘dire cir-\ncumstances’ that could not have been foreseen by the\nfounder of the plan.” White v. Marshall & Ilsley Corp., 714\nF. 3d 980, 989 (2013).\n   The Sixth Circuit agreed that some sort of presumption\nfavoring an ESOP fiduciary’s purchase of employer stock\nis appropriate. But it held that this presumption is an\nevidentiary rule that does not apply at the pleading stage.\nIt further held that, to overcome the presumption, a plain-\ntiff need not show that the employer was on the “brink of\ncollapse” or the like. Rather, the plaintiff need only show\nthat “ ‘a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circum-\nstances would have made a different investment deci-\nsion.’ ” 692 F. 3d, at 418 (quoting Kuper, 66 F. 3d, at\n8        FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1459).\n  Petitioners argue that the lower courts are right to\napply a presumption of prudence, that it should apply\nfrom the pleading stage onward, and that the presumption\nshould be strongly in favor of ESOP fiduciaries’ purchas-\ning and holding of employer stock.\n  In particular, petitioners propose a rule that a challenge\nto an ESOP fiduciary’s decision to hold or buy company\nstock “cannot prevail unless extraordinary circumstances,\nsuch as a serious threat to the employer’s viability, mean\nthat continued investment would substantially impair the\npurpose of the plan.” Brief for Petitioners 16. In petition-\ners’ view, the “purpose of the plan,” in the case of an\nESOP, is promoting employee ownership of the employer’s\nstock over the long term. And, petitioners assert, that\npurpose is “substantially impair[ed]”—rendering contin-\nued investment imprudent—only when “a serious threat to\nthe employer’s viability” makes it likely that the employer\nwill go out of business. This is because the goal of employee\nownership will be substantially impaired only if the em-\nployer goes out of business, leaving the employees with\nno company to own. Id., at 24.\n  We must decide whether ERISA contains some such\npresumption.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   In our view, the law does not create a special presump-\ntion favoring ESOP fiduciaries. Rather, the same stand-\nard of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, including\nESOP fiduciaries, except that an ESOP fiduciary is under\nno duty to diversify the ESOP’s holdings. This conclusion\nfollows from the pertinent provisions of ERISA, which are\nset forth above.\n   Section 1104(a)(1)(B) “imposes a ‘prudent person’ stand-\nard by which to measure fiduciaries’ investment decisions\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand disposition of assets.” Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins.\nCo. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 143, n. 10 (1985). Section\n1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan\nassets. And §1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which\nthose duties are loosened in the ESOP context to ensure\nthat employers are permitted and encouraged to offer\nESOPs. Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special\n“presumption” in favor of ESOP fiduciaries. It does not\nrequire plaintiffs to allege that the employer was on the\n“brink of collapse,” under “extraordinary circumstances,”\nor the like. Instead, §1104(a)(2) simply modifies the duties\nimposed by §1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way: It\nprovides that an ESOP fiduciary is exempt from\n§1104(a)(1)(C)’s diversification requirement and also from\n§1104(a)(1)(B)’s duty of prudence, but “only to the extent\nthat it requires diversification.” §1104(a)(2) (emphasis\nadded).\n   Thus, ESOP fiduciaries, unlike ERISA fiduciaries gen-\nerally, are not liable for losses that result from a failure to\ndiversify. But aside from that distinction, because ESOP\nfiduciaries are ERISA fiduciaries and because\n§1104(a)(1)(B)’s duty of prudence applies to all ERISA\nfiduciaries, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the duty of\nprudence just as other ERISA fiduciaries are.\n                           B\n  Petitioners make several arguments to the contrary.\nFirst, petitioners argue that the special purpose of an\nESOP—investing participants’ savings in the stock of\ntheir employer—calls for a presumption that such invest-\nments are prudent. Their argument is as follows: ERISA\ndefines the duty of prudence in terms of what a prudent\nperson would do “in the conduct of an enterprise of a like\ncharacter and with like aims.” §1104(a)(1)(B). The “char-\nacter” and “aims” of an ESOP differ from those of an ordi-\nnary retirement investment, such as a diversified mutual\n10       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfund. An ordinary plan seeks (1) to maximize retirement\nsavings for participants while (2) avoiding excessive risk.\nBut an ESOP also seeks (3) to promote employee owner-\nship of employer stock. For instance, Fifth Third’s Plan\nrequires the ESOP’s assets to be “invested primarily in\nshares of common stock of Fifth Third.” App. 350. In light\nof this additional goal, an ESOP fiduciary’s decision to buy\nmore shares of employer stock, even if it would be impru-\ndent were it viewed solely as an attempt to secure finan-\ncial retirement benefits while avoiding excessive risk,\nmight nonetheless be prudent if understood as an attempt\nto promote employee ownership of employer stock, a goal\nthat Congress views as important. See Tax Reform Act of\n1976, §803(h), 90 Stat. 1590. Thus, a claim that an ESOP\nfiduciary’s investment in employer stock was imprudent\nas a way of securing retirement savings should be viewed\nunfavorably because, unless the company was about to go\nout of business, that investment was advancing the addi-\ntional goal of employee ownership of employer stock.\n   We cannot accept the claim that underlies this argu-\nment, namely, that the content of ERISA’s duty of pru-\ndence varies depending upon the specific nonpecuniary\ngoal set out in an ERISA plan, such as what petitioners\nclaim is the nonpecuniary goal here. Taken in context,\n§1104(a)(1)(B)’s reference to “an enterprise of a like char-\nacter and with like aims” means an enterprise with what\nthe immediately preceding provision calls the “exclusive\npurpose” to be pursued by all ERISA fiduciaries: “provid-\ning benefits to participants and their beneficiaries” while\n“defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.”\n§§1104(a)(1)(A)(i), (ii). Read in the context of ERISA as a\nwhole, the term “benefits” in the provision just quoted\nmust be understood to refer to the sort of financial bene-\nfits (such as retirement income) that trustees who manage\ninvestments typically seek to secure for the trust’s benefi-\nciaries. Cf. §1002(2)(A) (defining “employee pension bene-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfit plan” and “pension plan” to mean plans that provide\nemployees with “retirement income” or other “deferral of\nincome”). The term does not cover nonpecuniary benefits\nlike those supposed to arise from employee ownership of\nemployer stock.\n    Consider the statute’s requirement that fiduciaries act\n“in accordance with the documents and instruments gov-\nerning the plan insofar as such documents and instru-\nments are consistent with the provisions of this subchap-\nter.” §1104(a)(1)(D) (emphasis added). This provision\nmakes clear that the duty of prudence trumps the instruc-\ntions of a plan document, such as an instruction to invest\nexclusively in employer stock even if financial goals de-\nmand the contrary. See also §1110(a) (With irrelevant\nexceptions, “any provision in an agreement or instrument\nwhich purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility\n. . . for any . . . duty under this part shall be void as\nagainst public policy”). This rule would make little sense\nif, as petitioners argue, the duty of prudence is defined by\nthe aims of the particular plan as set out in the plan doc-\numents, since in that case the duty of prudence could\nnever conflict with a plan document.\n    Consider also §1104(a)(2), which exempts an ESOP\nfiduciary from §1104(a)(1)(B)’s duty of prudence but “only\nto the extent that it requires diversification.” What need\nwould there be for this specific provision were the nature\nof §1104(a)(1)(B)’s duty of prudence altered anyway in the\ncase of an ESOP in light of the ESOP’s aim of promoting\nemployee ownership of employer stock? Cf. Arlington\nCentral School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U. S. 291,\n299, n. 1 (2006) (“[I]t is generally presumed that statutes\ndo not contain surplusage”).\n    Petitioners are right to point out that Congress, in seek-\ning to permit and promote ESOPs, was pursuing purposes\nother than the financial security of plan participants. See,\ne.g., Tax Reform Act of 1976, §803(h), 90 Stat. 1590 (Con-\n12       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngress intended ESOPs to help “secur[e] capital funds for\nnecessary capital growth and . . . brin[g] about stock own-\nership by all corporate employees”). Congress pursued\nthose purposes by promoting ESOPs with tax incentives.\nSee 26 U. S. C. §§402(e)(4), 404(k), 1042. And it also\npursued them by exempting ESOPs from ERISA’s diversi-\nfication requirement, which otherwise would have pre-\ncluded their creation. 29 U. S. C. §1104(a)(2). But we are\nnot convinced that Congress also sought to promote\nESOPs by further relaxing the duty of prudence as ap-\nplied to ESOPs with the sort of presumption proposed by\npetitioners.\n   Second, and relatedly, petitioners contend that the duty\nof prudence should be read in light of the rule under the\ncommon law of trusts that “the settlor can reduce or waive\nthe prudent man standard of care by specific language in\nthe trust instrument.” G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of\nTrusts and Trustees §541, p. 172 (rev. 2d ed. 1993); see\nalso Restatement (Second) of Trusts §174, Comment d\n(1957) (“By the terms of the trust the requirement of care\nand skill may be relaxed or modified”). The argument is\nthat, by commanding the ESOP fiduciary to invest primar-\nily in Fifth Third stock, the plan documents waived the\nduty of prudence to the extent that it comes into conflict\nwith investment in Fifth Third stock—at least unless\n“extraordinary circumstances” arise that so threaten the\ngoal of employee ownership of Fifth Third stock that the\nfiduciaries must assume that the settlor would want them\nto depart from that goal under the common-law “deviation\ndoctrine.” See id., §167. This argument fails, however, in\nlight of this Court’s holding that, by contrast to the rule at\ncommon law, “trust documents cannot excuse trustees\nfrom their duties under ERISA.” Central States, South-\neast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund, 472 U. S., at 568;\nsee also 29 U. S. C. §§1104(a)(1)(D), 1110(a).\n   Third, petitioners argue that subjecting ESOP fiduciar-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nies to a duty of prudence without the protection of a spe-\ncial presumption will lead to conflicts with the legal prohi-\nbition on insider trading. The potential for conflict arises\nbecause ESOP fiduciaries often are company insiders and\nbecause suits against insider fiduciaries frequently allege,\nas the complaint in this case alleges, that the fiduciaries\nwere imprudent in failing to act on inside information they\nhad about the value of the employer’s stock.\n   This concern is a legitimate one. But an ESOP-specific\nrule that a fiduciary does not act imprudently in buying or\nholding company stock unless the company is on the brink\nof collapse (or the like) is an ill-fitting means of addressing\nit. While ESOP fiduciaries may be more likely to have\ninsider information about a company that the fund is\ninvesting in than are other ERISA fiduciaries, the poten-\ntial for conflict with the securities laws would be the same\nfor a non-ESOP fiduciary who had relevant inside infor-\nmation about a potential investment. And the potential\nfor conflict is the same for an ESOP fiduciary whose com-\npany is on the brink of collapse as for a fiduciary who is\ninvested in a healthier company. (Surely a fiduciary is not\nobligated to break the insider trading laws even if his\ncompany is about to fail.) The potential for conflict there-\nfore does not persuade us to accept a presumption of the\nsort adopted by the lower courts and proposed by petition-\ners. We discuss alternative means of dealing with the\npotential for conflict in Part IV, infra.\n   Finally, petitioners argue that, without some sort of\nspecial presumption, the threat of costly duty-of-prudence\nlawsuits will deter companies from offering ESOPs to\ntheir employees, contrary to the stated intent of Congress.\nCf. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 473 U. S., at 148, n.\n17 (“Congress was concerned lest the cost of federal stand-\nards discourage the growth of private pension plans”).\nESOP plans instruct their fiduciaries to invest in company\nstock, and §1104(a)(1)(D) requires fiduciaries to follow\n14       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplan documents so long as they do not conflict with\nERISA. Thus, in many cases an ESOP fiduciary who fears\nthat continuing to invest in company stock may be impru-\ndent finds himself between a rock and a hard place: If he\nkeeps investing and the stock goes down he may be sued\nfor acting imprudently in violation of §1104(a)(1)(B), but\nif he stops investing and the stock goes up he may be\nsued for disobeying the plan documents in violation of\n§1104(a)(1)(D).     See, e.g., White, 714 F. 3d, at 987\n(“[F]iduciaries could be liable either for the company\nstock’s poor performance if they continue to invest in\nemployer stock, or for missing the opportunity to benefit\nfrom good performance if they do not. . . . Such a high\nexposure to litigation risks in either direction could dis-\ncourage employers from offering ESOPs, which are fa-\nvored by Congress”); Evans v. Akers, 534 F. 3d 65, 68 (CA1\n2008) (describing two lawsuits challenging the decisions of\na plan’s fiduciaries with “diametrically opposed theor[ies]\nof liability”: one arguing that the fiduciaries acted impru-\ndently by continuing to invest in company stock, and the\nother contending that they acted imprudently by divesting\n“despite the company’s solid potential to emerge from\nbankruptcy with substantial value for shareholders”).\nPetitioners argue that, given the threat of such expensive\nlitigation, ESOPs cannot thrive unless their fiduciaries are\ngranted a defense-friendly presumption.\n   Petitioners are basically seeking relief from what they\nbelieve are meritless, economically burdensome lawsuits.\nWe agree that Congress sought to encourage the creation\nof ESOPs. And we have recognized that “ERISA repre-\nsents a ‘ “careful balancing” between ensuring fair and\nprompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the en-\ncouragement of the creation of such plans.’ ” Conkright v.\nFrommert, 559 U. S. 506, 517 (2010) (quoting Aetna\nHealth Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 215 (2004)); see also\nVarity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996) (In “inter-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npret[ing] ERISA’s fiduciary duties,” “courts may have to\ntake account of competing congressional purposes, such as\nCongress’ desire to offer employees enhanced protection\nfor their benefits, on the one hand, and, on the other, its\ndesire not to create a system that is so complex that ad-\nministrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discour-\nage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the\nfirst place”).\n   At the same time, we do not believe that the presump-\ntion at issue here is an appropriate way to weed out merit-\nless lawsuits or to provide the requisite “balancing.” The\nproposed presumption makes it impossible for a plaintiff\nto state a duty-of-prudence claim, no matter how meritori-\nous, unless the employer is in very bad economic circum-\nstances. Such a rule does not readily divide the plausible\nsheep from the meritless goats. That important task can\nbe better accomplished through careful, context-sensitive\nscrutiny of a complaint’s allegations. We consequently\nstand by our conclusion that the law does not create a\nspecial presumption of prudence for ESOP fiduciaries.\n                             IV\n  We consider more fully one important mechanism for\nweeding out meritless claims, the motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim. That mechanism, which gave rise\nto the lower court decisions at issue here, requires careful\njudicial consideration of whether the complaint states a\nclaim that the defendant has acted imprudently. See Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662,\n677–680 (2009); Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S.\n544, 554–563 (2007). Because the content of the duty of\nprudence turns on “the circumstances . . . prevailing” at\nthe time the fiduciary acts, §1104(a)(1)(B), the appropriate\ninquiry will necessarily be context specific.\n  The District Court in this case granted petitioners’\nmotion to dismiss the complaint because it held that re-\n16       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspondents could not overcome the presumption of pru-\ndence. The Court of Appeals, by contrast, concluded that\nno presumption applied. And we agree with that conclu-\nsion. The Court of Appeals, however, went on to hold that\nrespondents had stated a plausible duty-of-prudence\nclaim. 692 F. 3d, at 419–420. The arguments made here,\nalong with our review of the record, convince us that the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals should be vacated and\nthe case remanded. On remand, the Court of Appeals\nshould apply the pleading standard as discussed in\nTwombly and Iqbal in light of the following considerations.\n                              A\n  Respondents allege that, as of July 2007, petitioners\nknew or should have known in light of publicly available\ninformation, such as newspaper articles, that continuing\nto hold and purchase Fifth Third stock was imprudent.\nApp. 48–53. The complaint alleges, among other things,\nthat petitioners “continued to allow the Plan’s investment\nin Fifth Third Stock even during the time that the stock\nprice was declining in value as a result of [the] collapse of\nthe housing market” and that “[a] prudent fiduciary facing\nsimilar circumstances would not have stood idly by as the\nPlan’s assets were decimated.” Id., at 53.\n  In our view, where a stock is publicly traded, allegations\nthat a fiduciary should have recognized from publicly\navailable information alone that the market was over- or\nundervaluing the stock are implausible as a general rule,\nat least in the absence of special circumstances. Many\ninvestors take the view that “ ‘they have little hope of\noutperforming the market in the long run based solely on\ntheir analysis of publicly available information,’ ” and\naccordingly they “ ‘rely on the security’s market price as an\nunbiased assessment of the security’s value in light of all\npublic information.’ ” Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John\nFund, Inc. ___ U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11–12)\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(quoting Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and\nTrust Funds, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5)).\nERISA fiduciaries, who likewise could reasonably see\n“little hope of outperforming the market . . . based solely\non their analysis of publicly available information,” ibid.,\nmay, as a general matter, likewise prudently rely on the\nmarket price.\n   In other words, a fiduciary usually “is not imprudent to\nassume that a major stock market . . . provides the best\nestimate of the value of the stocks traded on it that is\navailable to him.” Summers v. State Street Bank & Trust\nCo., 453 F. 3d 404, 408 (CA7 2006); see also White, 714\nF. 3d, at 992 (A fiduciary’s “fail[ure] to outsmart a pre-\nsumptively efficient market . . . is . . . not a sound basis for\nimposing liability”); cf. Quan, 623 F. 3d, at 881 (“Fiduciar-\nies are not expected to predict the future of the company\nstock’s performance”).\n   We do not here consider whether a plaintiff could none-\ntheless plausibly allege imprudence on the basis of pub-\nlicly available information by pointing to a special circum-\nstance affecting the reliability of the market price as “ ‘an\nunbiased assessment of the security’s value in light of all\npublic information,’ ” Halliburton Co., supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 12) (quoting Amgen Inc., supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n5)), that would make reliance on the market’s valuation\nimprudent. In this case, the Court of Appeals held that\nthe complaint stated a claim because respondents “allege\nthat Fifth Third engaged in lending practices that were\nequivalent to participation in the subprime lending mar-\nket, that Defendants were aware of the risks of such in-\nvestments by the start of the class period, and that such\nrisks made Fifth Third stock an imprudent investment.”\n692 F. 3d, at 419–420. The Court of Appeals did not point\nto any special circumstance rendering reliance on the\nmarket price imprudent. The court’s decision to deny\ndismissal therefore appears to have been based on an\n18       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nerroneous understanding of the prudence of relying on\nmarket prices.\n                              B\n   Respondents also claim that petitioners behaved impru-\ndently by failing to act on the basis of nonpublic infor-\nmation that was available to them because they were Fifth\nThird insiders. In particular, the complaint alleges that\npetitioners had inside information indicating that the\nmarket was overvaluing Fifth Third stock and that they\ncould have used this information to prevent losses to the\nfund by (1) selling the ESOP’s holdings of Fifth Third\nstock; (2) refraining from future stock purchases (includ-\ning by removing the Plan’s ESOP option altogether); or (3)\npublicly disclosing the inside information so that the\nmarket would correct the stock price downward, with the\nresult that the ESOP could continue to buy Fifth Third\nstock without paying an inflated price for it. See App. 17,\n88–89, 113.\n   To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence on\nthe basis of inside information, a plaintiff must plausibly\nallege an alternative action that the defendant could have\ntaken that would have been consistent with the securities\nlaws and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circum-\nstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the\nfund than to help it. The following three points inform the\nrequisite analysis.\n   First, in deciding whether the complaint states a claim\nupon which relief can be granted, courts must bear in\nmind that the duty of prudence, under ERISA as under\nthe common law of trusts, does not require a fiduciary to\nbreak the law. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts §166,\nComment a (“The trustee is not under a duty to the bene-\nficiary to do an act which is criminal or tortious”). Federal\nsecurities laws “are violated when a corporate insider\ntrades in the securities of his corporation on the basis of\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmaterial, nonpublic information.”         United States v.\nO’Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651–652 (1997). As every Court\nof Appeals to address the question has held, ERISA’s duty\nof prudence cannot require an ESOP fiduciary to perform\nan action—such as divesting the fund’s holdings of the\nemployer’s stock on the basis of inside information—that\nwould violate the securities laws. See, e.g., Rinehart v.\nAkers, 722 F. 3d 137, 146–147 (CA2 2013); Kirschbaum v.\nReliant Energy, Inc., 526 F. 3d 243, 256 (CA5 2008); White,\nsupra, at 992; Quan, supra, at 881–882, and n. 8; Lanfear\nv. Home Depot, Inc., 679 F. 3d 1267, 1282 (CA11 2012). To\nthe extent that the Sixth Circuit denied dismissal based\non the theory that the duty of prudence required petition-\ners to sell the ESOP’s holdings of Fifth Third stock, its\ndenial of dismissal was erroneous.\n   Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing\nto decide, on the basis of the inside information, to refrain\nfrom making additional stock purchases or for failing to\ndisclose that information to the public so that the stock\nwould no longer be overvalued, additional considerations\narise. The courts should consider the extent to which an\nERISA-based obligation either to refrain on the basis of\ninside information from making a planned trade or to\ndisclose inside information to the public could conflict with\nthe complex insider trading and corporate disclosure\nrequirements imposed by the federal securities laws or\nwith the objectives of those laws. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1144(d)\n(“Nothing in this subchapter [which includes §1104] shall\nbe construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair,\nor supersede any law of the United States . . . or any rule\nor regulation issued under any such law”); Black & Decker\nDisability Plan v. Nord, 538 U. S. 822, 831 (2003)\n(“Although Congress ‘expect[ed]’ courts would develop ‘a fed-\neral common law of rights and obligations under ERISA-\nregulated plans,’ the scope of permissible judicial innova-\ntion is narrower in areas where other federal actors are\n20       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v.

Securities and Exchange Commission has not\nadvised us of its views on these matters, and we believe\nthose views may well be relevant.\n  Third, lower courts faced with such claims should also\nconsider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that\na prudent fiduciary in the defendant’s position could not\nhave concluded that stopping purchases—which the mar-\nket might take as a sign that insider fiduciaries viewed\nthe employer’s stock as a bad investment—or publicly\ndisclosing negative information would do more harm than\ngood to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a\nconcomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by\nthe fund.\n                        *     *    *\n  We leave it to the courts below to apply the foregoing to\nthe complaint in this case in the first instance.

Argued April 2, 2014—Decided June 25, 2014\nPetitioner Fifth Third Bancorp maintains a defined-contribution re-\n  tirement savings plan for its employees. Plan participants may di-\n  rect their contributions into any of a number of investment options,\n  including an “employee stock ownership plan” (ESOP), which invests\n  its funds primarily in Fifth Third stock. Respondents, former Fifth\n  Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this lawsuit against\n  petitioners, Fifth Third and several of its officers who are alleged to\n  be fiduciaries of the ESOP. The complaint alleges that petitioners\n  breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee\n  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C.\n  §1104(a)(1)(B). Specifically, the complaint alleges that petitioners\n  should have known—on the basis of both publicly available infor-\n  mation and inside information available to petitioners because they\n  were Fifth Third officers—that Fifth Third stock was overpriced and\n  excessively risky. It further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in peti-\n  tioners’ position would have responded to this information by selling\n  off the ESOP’s holdings of Fifth Third stock, refraining from purchas-\n  ing more Fifth Third stock, or disclosing the negative inside infor-\n  mation so that the market could correct the stock’s price downward.\n  According to the complaint, petitioners did none of these things, and\n  the price of Fifth Third stock ultimately fell, reducing respondents’\n  retirement savings. The District Court dismissed the complaint for\n  failure to state a claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed. It concluded\n  that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a “presumption of prudence”\n  that does not apply to other ERISA fiduciaries but that the presump-\n  tion is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the plead-\n  ing stage. The court went on to hold that the complaint stated a\n2            FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    claim for breach of fiduciary duty.\nHeld:\n    1. ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of\n prudence. Rather, they are subject to the same duty of prudence that\n applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, §1104(a)(1)(B), except that\n they need not diversify the fund’s assets, §1104(a)(2). This conclusion\n follows from the relevant provisions of ERISA. Section 1104(a)(1)(B)\n “imposes a ‘prudent person’ standard by which to measure fiduciar-\n ies’ investment decisions and disposition of assets.” Massachusetts\n Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 143, n. 10. Section\n 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets.\n And §1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loos-\n ened in the ESOP context by providing that “the diversification re-\n quirement of [§1104(a)(1)(C)] and the prudence requirement (only to\n the extent that it requires diversification) of [§1104(a)(1)(B)] [are] not\n violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].” Section\n 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special “presumption” in favor of\n ESOP fiduciaries and does not require plaintiffs to allege that the\n employer was, e.g., on the “brink of collapse.” It simply modifies the\n duties imposed by §1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way. Thus,\n aside from the fact that ESOP fiduciaries are not liable for losses that\n result from a failure to diversify, they are subject to the duty of pru-\n dence like other ERISA fiduciaries. Pp. 4–15.\n    2. On remand, the Sixth Circuit should reconsider whether the\n complaint states a claim by applying the pleading standard as dis-\n cussed in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 677–680, and Bell Atlantic\n Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 554–563, in light of the following\n considerations. Pp. 15–20.\n       (a) Where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary\n should have recognized on the basis of publicly available information\n that the market was overvaluing or undervaluing the stock are gen-\n erally implausible and thus insufficient to state a claim under\n Twombly and Iqbal. Pp. 16–18.\n       (b) To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence, a com-\n plaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant\n could have taken, that would have been legal, and that a prudent fi-\n duciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more\n likely to harm the fund than to help it. Where the complaint alleges\n that a fiduciary was imprudent in failing to act on the basis of inside\n information, the analysis is informed by the following points. First,\n ERISA’s duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law,\n and so a fiduciary cannot be imprudent for failing to buy or sell stock\n in violation of the insider trading laws. Second, where a complaint\n faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, based on negative inside infor-\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  mation, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for fail-\n  ing to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no\n  longer be overvalued, courts should consider the extent to which im-\n  posing an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain from making a\n  planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could\n  conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure re-\n  quirements set forth by the federal securities laws or with the objec-\n  tives of those laws. Third, courts confronted with such claims should\n  consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent\n  fiduciary in the defendant’s position could not have concluded that\n  stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would\n  do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock\n  price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by\n  the fund.

S. C. §1001 et\nseq., requires the fiduciary of a pension plan to act pru-\ndently in managing the plan’s assets. §1104(a)(1)(B). This\ncase focuses upon that duty of prudence as applied to the\nfiduciary of an “employee stock ownership plan” (ESOP), a\ntype of pension plan that invests primarily in the stock of\nthe company that employs the plan participants.\n   We consider whether, when an ESOP fiduciary’s deci-\nsion to buy or hold the employer’s stock is challenged in\ncourt, the fiduciary is entitled to a defense-friendly stand-\nard that the lower courts have called a “presumption of\nprudence.” The Courts of Appeals that have considered\nthe question have held that such a presumption does\napply, with the presumption generally defined as a re-\nquirement that the plaintiff make a showing that would\nnot be required in an ordinary duty-of-prudence case, such\nas that the employer was on the brink of collapse.\n   We hold that no such presumption applies. Instead,\nESOP fiduciaries are subject to the same duty of prudence\n2        FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, except that\nthey need not diversify the fund’s assets. §1104(a)(2).\n                             I\n   Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp, a large financial ser-\nvices firm, maintains for its employees a defined-\ncontribution retirement savings plan. Employees may\nchoose to contribute a portion of their compensation to the\nPlan as retirement savings, and Fifth Third provides\nmatching contributions of up to 4% of an employee’s com-\npensation. The Plan’s assets are invested in 20 separate\nfunds, including mutual funds and an ESOP. Plan partic-\nipants can allocate their contributions among the funds\nhowever they like; Fifth Third’s matching contributions,\non the other hand, are always invested initially in the\nESOP, though the participant can then choose to move\nthem to another fund. The Plan requires the ESOP’s\nfunds to be “invested primarily in shares of common stock\nof Fifth Third.” App. 350.\n   Respondents, who are former Fifth Third employees and\nESOP participants, filed this putative class action in\nFederal District Court in Ohio. They claim that petition-\ners, Fifth Third and various Fifth Third officers, were\nfiduciaries of the Plan and violated the duties of loyalty\nand prudence imposed by ERISA.             See §§1109(a),\n1132(a)(2). We limit our review to the duty-of-prudence\nclaims.\n   The complaint alleges that by July 2007, the fiduciaries\nknew or should have known that Fifth Third’s stock was\novervalued and excessively risky for two separate reasons.\nFirst, publicly available information such as newspaper\narticles provided early warning signs that subprime lend-\ning, which formed a large part of Fifth Third’s business,\nwould soon leave creditors high and dry as the housing\nmarket collapsed and subprime borrowers became unable\nto pay off their mortgages. Second, nonpublic information\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(which petitioners knew because they were Fifth Third\ninsiders) indicated that Fifth Third officers had deceived\nthe market by making material misstatements about the\ncompany’s financial prospects. Those misstatements led\nthe market to overvalue Fifth Third stock—the ESOP’s\nprimary investment—and so petitioners, using the partic-\nipants’ money, were consequently paying more for that\nstock than it was worth.\n   The complaint further alleges that a prudent fiduciary\nin petitioners’ position would have responded to this in-\nformation in one or more of the following ways: (1) by\nselling the ESOP’s holdings of Fifth Third stock before the\nvalue of those holdings declined, (2) by refraining from\npurchasing any more Fifth Third stock, (3) by canceling\nthe Plan’s ESOP option, and (4) by disclosing the inside\ninformation so that the market would adjust its valuation\nof Fifth Third stock downward and the ESOP would no\nlonger be overpaying for it.\n   Rather than follow any of these courses of action, peti-\ntioners continued to hold and buy Fifth Third stock. Then\nthe market crashed, and Fifth Third’s stock price fell by\n74% between July 2007 and September 2009, when the\ncomplaint was filed. Since the ESOP’s funds were invested\nprimarily in Fifth Third stock, this fall in price elimi-\nnated a large part of the retirement savings that the\nparticipants had invested in the ESOP. (The stock has\nsince made a partial recovery to around half of its July\n2007 price.)\n   The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to\nstate a claim. 757 F. Supp. 2d 753 (SD Ohio 2010). The\ncourt began from the premise that where a lawsuit chal-\nlenges ESOP fiduciaries’ investment decisions, “the plan\nfiduciaries start with a presumption that their ‘decision to\nremain invested in employer securities was reasonable.’ ”\nId., at 758 (quoting Kuper v. Iovenko, 66 F. 3d 1447, 1459\n(CA6 1995)). The court next held that this rule is applica-\n4        FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nble at the pleading stage and then concluded that the\ncomplaint’s allegations were insufficient to overcome it.\n757 F. Supp. 2d, at 758–759, 760–762.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. 692\nF. 3d 410 (2012). Although it agreed that ESOP fiduciar-\nies are entitled to a presumption of prudence, it took the\nview that the presumption is evidentiary only and there-\nfore does not apply at the pleading stage. Id., at 418–419.\nThus, the Sixth Circuit simply asked whether the allega-\ntions in the complaint were sufficient to state a claim for\nbreach of fiduciary duty. Id., at 419. It held that they\nwere. Id., at 419–420.\n   In light of differences among the Courts of Appeals as to\nthe nature of the presumption of prudence applicable to\nESOP fiduciaries, we granted the fiduciaries’ petition for\ncertiorari. Compare In re Citigroup ERISA Litigation, 662\nF. 3d 128, 139–140 (CA2 2011) (presumption of prudence\napplies at the pleading stage and requires the plaintiff to\nestablish that the employer was “in a ‘dire situation’ that\nwas objectively unforeseeable by the settlor” (quoting\nEdgar v.

Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559,\n570 (1985) (Section 1104(a)(1) imposes “strict standards of\ntrustee conduct . . . derived from the common law of\ntrusts—most prominently, a standard of loyalty and a\nstandard of care”).\n  On the other hand, Congress recognizes that ESOPs are\n“designed to invest primarily in” the stock of the partici-\npants’ employer, §1107(d)(6)(A), meaning that they are not\nprudently diversified. And it has written into law its\n6        FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“interest in encouraging” their use. One statutory provi-\nsion says:\n      “INTENT OF CONGRESS CONCERNING EMPLOYEE\n    STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS.—The Congress, in a series\n    of laws [including ERISA] has made clear its interest\n    in encouraging [ESOPs] as a bold and innovative\n    method of strengthening the free private enterprise\n    system which will solve the dual problems of securing\n    capital funds for necessary capital growth and of\n    bringing about stock ownership by all corporate em-\n    ployees. The Congress is deeply concerned that the\n    objectives sought by this series of laws will be made\n    unattainable by regulations and rulings which treat\n    [ESOPs] as conventional retirement plans, which re-\n    duce the freedom of the employee trusts and employ-\n    ers to take the necessary steps to implement the\n    plans, and which otherwise block the establishment\n    and success of these plans.” Tax Reform Act of 1976,\n    §803(h), 90 Stat. 1590.\n   In addition, and in keeping with this statement of in-\ntent, Congress has given ESOP fiduciaries a statutory\nexemption from some of the duties imposed on ERISA\nfiduciaries. ERISA specifically provides that, in the case\nof ESOPs and other eligible individual account plans,\n    “the diversification requirement of [§1104(a)(1)(C)]\n    and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that\n    it requires diversification) of [§1104(a)(1)(B)] [are] not\n    violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].”\n    §1104(a)(2).\nThus, an ESOP fiduciary is not obliged under\n§1104(a)(1)(C) to “diversif[y] the investments of the plan\nso as to minimize the risk of large losses” or under\n§1104(a)(1)(B) to act “with the care, skill, prudence, and\ndiligence” of a “prudent man” insofar as that duty “re-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nquires diversification.”\n                              B\n   Several Courts of Appeals have gone beyond ERISA’s\nexpress provision that ESOP fiduciaries need not diversify\nby giving ESOP fiduciaries a “presumption of prudence”\nwhen their decisions to hold or buy employer stock are\nchallenged as imprudent. Thus, the Third Circuit has\nheld that “an ESOP fiduciary who invests the [ESOP’s]\nassets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that\nit acted consistently with ERISA” in doing so. Moench v.\nRobertson, 62 F. 3d 553, 571 (1995). The Ninth Circuit\nhas said that to “overcome the presumption of prudent\ninvestment, plaintiffs must . . . make allegations that\nclearly implicate the company’s viability as an ongoing\nconcern or show a precipitous decline in the employer’s\nstock . . . combined with evidence that the company is on\nthe brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanage-\nment.” Quan v. Computer Sciences Corp., 623 F. 3d 870,\n882 (2010) (brackets and internal quotation marks omit-\nted). And the Seventh Circuit has described the presump-\ntion as requiring plaintiffs to “allege and ultimately prove\nthat the company faced ‘impending collapse’ or ‘dire cir-\ncumstances’ that could not have been foreseen by the\nfounder of the plan.” White v. Marshall & Ilsley Corp., 714\nF. 3d 980, 989 (2013).\n   The Sixth Circuit agreed that some sort of presumption\nfavoring an ESOP fiduciary’s purchase of employer stock\nis appropriate. But it held that this presumption is an\nevidentiary rule that does not apply at the pleading stage.\nIt further held that, to overcome the presumption, a plain-\ntiff need not show that the employer was on the “brink of\ncollapse” or the like. Rather, the plaintiff need only show\nthat “ ‘a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circum-\nstances would have made a different investment deci-\nsion.’ ” 692 F. 3d, at 418 (quoting Kuper, 66 F. 3d, at\n8        FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1459).\n  Petitioners argue that the lower courts are right to\napply a presumption of prudence, that it should apply\nfrom the pleading stage onward, and that the presumption\nshould be strongly in favor of ESOP fiduciaries’ purchas-\ning and holding of employer stock.\n  In particular, petitioners propose a rule that a challenge\nto an ESOP fiduciary’s decision to hold or buy company\nstock “cannot prevail unless extraordinary circumstances,\nsuch as a serious threat to the employer’s viability, mean\nthat continued investment would substantially impair the\npurpose of the plan.” Brief for Petitioners 16. In petition-\ners’ view, the “purpose of the plan,” in the case of an\nESOP, is promoting employee ownership of the employer’s\nstock over the long term. And, petitioners assert, that\npurpose is “substantially impair[ed]”—rendering contin-\nued investment imprudent—only when “a serious threat to\nthe employer’s viability” makes it likely that the employer\nwill go out of business. This is because the goal of employee\nownership will be substantially impaired only if the em-\nployer goes out of business, leaving the employees with\nno company to own. Id., at 24.\n  We must decide whether ERISA contains some such\npresumption.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   In our view, the law does not create a special presump-\ntion favoring ESOP fiduciaries. Rather, the same stand-\nard of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, including\nESOP fiduciaries, except that an ESOP fiduciary is under\nno duty to diversify the ESOP’s holdings. This conclusion\nfollows from the pertinent provisions of ERISA, which are\nset forth above.\n   Section 1104(a)(1)(B) “imposes a ‘prudent person’ stand-\nard by which to measure fiduciaries’ investment decisions\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand disposition of assets.” Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins.\nCo. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 143, n. 10 (1985). Section\n1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan\nassets. And §1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which\nthose duties are loosened in the ESOP context to ensure\nthat employers are permitted and encouraged to offer\nESOPs. Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special\n“presumption” in favor of ESOP fiduciaries. It does not\nrequire plaintiffs to allege that the employer was on the\n“brink of collapse,” under “extraordinary circumstances,”\nor the like. Instead, §1104(a)(2) simply modifies the duties\nimposed by §1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way: It\nprovides that an ESOP fiduciary is exempt from\n§1104(a)(1)(C)’s diversification requirement and also from\n§1104(a)(1)(B)’s duty of prudence, but “only to the extent\nthat it requires diversification.” §1104(a)(2) (emphasis\nadded).\n   Thus, ESOP fiduciaries, unlike ERISA fiduciaries gen-\nerally, are not liable for losses that result from a failure to\ndiversify. But aside from that distinction, because ESOP\nfiduciaries are ERISA fiduciaries and because\n§1104(a)(1)(B)’s duty of prudence applies to all ERISA\nfiduciaries, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the duty of\nprudence just as other ERISA fiduciaries are.\n                           B\n  Petitioners make several arguments to the contrary.\nFirst, petitioners argue that the special purpose of an\nESOP—investing participants’ savings in the stock of\ntheir employer—calls for a presumption that such invest-\nments are prudent. Their argument is as follows: ERISA\ndefines the duty of prudence in terms of what a prudent\nperson would do “in the conduct of an enterprise of a like\ncharacter and with like aims.” §1104(a)(1)(B). The “char-\nacter” and “aims” of an ESOP differ from those of an ordi-\nnary retirement investment, such as a diversified mutual\n10       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfund. An ordinary plan seeks (1) to maximize retirement\nsavings for participants while (2) avoiding excessive risk.\nBut an ESOP also seeks (3) to promote employee owner-\nship of employer stock. For instance, Fifth Third’s Plan\nrequires the ESOP’s assets to be “invested primarily in\nshares of common stock of Fifth Third.” App. 350. In light\nof this additional goal, an ESOP fiduciary’s decision to buy\nmore shares of employer stock, even if it would be impru-\ndent were it viewed solely as an attempt to secure finan-\ncial retirement benefits while avoiding excessive risk,\nmight nonetheless be prudent if understood as an attempt\nto promote employee ownership of employer stock, a goal\nthat Congress views as important. See Tax Reform Act of\n1976, §803(h), 90 Stat. 1590. Thus, a claim that an ESOP\nfiduciary’s investment in employer stock was imprudent\nas a way of securing retirement savings should be viewed\nunfavorably because, unless the company was about to go\nout of business, that investment was advancing the addi-\ntional goal of employee ownership of employer stock.\n   We cannot accept the claim that underlies this argu-\nment, namely, that the content of ERISA’s duty of pru-\ndence varies depending upon the specific nonpecuniary\ngoal set out in an ERISA plan, such as what petitioners\nclaim is the nonpecuniary goal here. Taken in context,\n§1104(a)(1)(B)’s reference to “an enterprise of a like char-\nacter and with like aims” means an enterprise with what\nthe immediately preceding provision calls the “exclusive\npurpose” to be pursued by all ERISA fiduciaries: “provid-\ning benefits to participants and their beneficiaries” while\n“defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.”\n§§1104(a)(1)(A)(i), (ii). Read in the context of ERISA as a\nwhole, the term “benefits” in the provision just quoted\nmust be understood to refer to the sort of financial bene-\nfits (such as retirement income) that trustees who manage\ninvestments typically seek to secure for the trust’s benefi-\nciaries. Cf. §1002(2)(A) (defining “employee pension bene-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfit plan” and “pension plan” to mean plans that provide\nemployees with “retirement income” or other “deferral of\nincome”). The term does not cover nonpecuniary benefits\nlike those supposed to arise from employee ownership of\nemployer stock.\n    Consider the statute’s requirement that fiduciaries act\n“in accordance with the documents and instruments gov-\nerning the plan insofar as such documents and instru-\nments are consistent with the provisions of this subchap-\nter.” §1104(a)(1)(D) (emphasis added). This provision\nmakes clear that the duty of prudence trumps the instruc-\ntions of a plan document, such as an instruction to invest\nexclusively in employer stock even if financial goals de-\nmand the contrary. See also §1110(a) (With irrelevant\nexceptions, “any provision in an agreement or instrument\nwhich purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility\n. . . for any . . . duty under this part shall be void as\nagainst public policy”). This rule would make little sense\nif, as petitioners argue, the duty of prudence is defined by\nthe aims of the particular plan as set out in the plan doc-\numents, since in that case the duty of prudence could\nnever conflict with a plan document.\n    Consider also §1104(a)(2), which exempts an ESOP\nfiduciary from §1104(a)(1)(B)’s duty of prudence but “only\nto the extent that it requires diversification.” What need\nwould there be for this specific provision were the nature\nof §1104(a)(1)(B)’s duty of prudence altered anyway in the\ncase of an ESOP in light of the ESOP’s aim of promoting\nemployee ownership of employer stock? Cf. Arlington\nCentral School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U. S. 291,\n299, n. 1 (2006) (“[I]t is generally presumed that statutes\ndo not contain surplusage”).\n    Petitioners are right to point out that Congress, in seek-\ning to permit and promote ESOPs, was pursuing purposes\nother than the financial security of plan participants. See,\ne.g., Tax Reform Act of 1976, §803(h), 90 Stat. 1590 (Con-\n12       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngress intended ESOPs to help “secur[e] capital funds for\nnecessary capital growth and . . . brin[g] about stock own-\nership by all corporate employees”). Congress pursued\nthose purposes by promoting ESOPs with tax incentives.\nSee 26 U. S. C. §§402(e)(4), 404(k), 1042. And it also\npursued them by exempting ESOPs from ERISA’s diversi-\nfication requirement, which otherwise would have pre-\ncluded their creation. 29 U. S. C. §1104(a)(2). But we are\nnot convinced that Congress also sought to promote\nESOPs by further relaxing the duty of prudence as ap-\nplied to ESOPs with the sort of presumption proposed by\npetitioners.\n   Second, and relatedly, petitioners contend that the duty\nof prudence should be read in light of the rule under the\ncommon law of trusts that “the settlor can reduce or waive\nthe prudent man standard of care by specific language in\nthe trust instrument.” G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of\nTrusts and Trustees §541, p. 172 (rev. 2d ed. 1993); see\nalso Restatement (Second) of Trusts §174, Comment d\n(1957) (“By the terms of the trust the requirement of care\nand skill may be relaxed or modified”). The argument is\nthat, by commanding the ESOP fiduciary to invest primar-\nily in Fifth Third stock, the plan documents waived the\nduty of prudence to the extent that it comes into conflict\nwith investment in Fifth Third stock—at least unless\n“extraordinary circumstances” arise that so threaten the\ngoal of employee ownership of Fifth Third stock that the\nfiduciaries must assume that the settlor would want them\nto depart from that goal under the common-law “deviation\ndoctrine.” See id., §167. This argument fails, however, in\nlight of this Court’s holding that, by contrast to the rule at\ncommon law, “trust documents cannot excuse trustees\nfrom their duties under ERISA.” Central States, South-\neast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund, 472 U. S., at 568;\nsee also 29 U. S. C. §§1104(a)(1)(D), 1110(a).\n   Third, petitioners argue that subjecting ESOP fiduciar-\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nies to a duty of prudence without the protection of a spe-\ncial presumption will lead to conflicts with the legal prohi-\nbition on insider trading. The potential for conflict arises\nbecause ESOP fiduciaries often are company insiders and\nbecause suits against insider fiduciaries frequently allege,\nas the complaint in this case alleges, that the fiduciaries\nwere imprudent in failing to act on inside information they\nhad about the value of the employer’s stock.\n   This concern is a legitimate one. But an ESOP-specific\nrule that a fiduciary does not act imprudently in buying or\nholding company stock unless the company is on the brink\nof collapse (or the like) is an ill-fitting means of addressing\nit. While ESOP fiduciaries may be more likely to have\ninsider information about a company that the fund is\ninvesting in than are other ERISA fiduciaries, the poten-\ntial for conflict with the securities laws would be the same\nfor a non-ESOP fiduciary who had relevant inside infor-\nmation about a potential investment. And the potential\nfor conflict is the same for an ESOP fiduciary whose com-\npany is on the brink of collapse as for a fiduciary who is\ninvested in a healthier company. (Surely a fiduciary is not\nobligated to break the insider trading laws even if his\ncompany is about to fail.) The potential for conflict there-\nfore does not persuade us to accept a presumption of the\nsort adopted by the lower courts and proposed by petition-\ners. We discuss alternative means of dealing with the\npotential for conflict in Part IV, infra.\n   Finally, petitioners argue that, without some sort of\nspecial presumption, the threat of costly duty-of-prudence\nlawsuits will deter companies from offering ESOPs to\ntheir employees, contrary to the stated intent of Congress.\nCf. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 473 U. S., at 148, n.\n17 (“Congress was concerned lest the cost of federal stand-\nards discourage the growth of private pension plans”).\nESOP plans instruct their fiduciaries to invest in company\nstock, and §1104(a)(1)(D) requires fiduciaries to follow\n14       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplan documents so long as they do not conflict with\nERISA. Thus, in many cases an ESOP fiduciary who fears\nthat continuing to invest in company stock may be impru-\ndent finds himself between a rock and a hard place: If he\nkeeps investing and the stock goes down he may be sued\nfor acting imprudently in violation of §1104(a)(1)(B), but\nif he stops investing and the stock goes up he may be\nsued for disobeying the plan documents in violation of\n§1104(a)(1)(D).     See, e.g., White, 714 F. 3d, at 987\n(“[F]iduciaries could be liable either for the company\nstock’s poor performance if they continue to invest in\nemployer stock, or for missing the opportunity to benefit\nfrom good performance if they do not. . . . Such a high\nexposure to litigation risks in either direction could dis-\ncourage employers from offering ESOPs, which are fa-\nvored by Congress”); Evans v. Akers, 534 F. 3d 65, 68 (CA1\n2008) (describing two lawsuits challenging the decisions of\na plan’s fiduciaries with “diametrically opposed theor[ies]\nof liability”: one arguing that the fiduciaries acted impru-\ndently by continuing to invest in company stock, and the\nother contending that they acted imprudently by divesting\n“despite the company’s solid potential to emerge from\nbankruptcy with substantial value for shareholders”).\nPetitioners argue that, given the threat of such expensive\nlitigation, ESOPs cannot thrive unless their fiduciaries are\ngranted a defense-friendly presumption.\n   Petitioners are basically seeking relief from what they\nbelieve are meritless, economically burdensome lawsuits.\nWe agree that Congress sought to encourage the creation\nof ESOPs. And we have recognized that “ERISA repre-\nsents a ‘ “careful balancing” between ensuring fair and\nprompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the en-\ncouragement of the creation of such plans.’ ” Conkright v.\nFrommert, 559 U. S. 506, 517 (2010) (quoting Aetna\nHealth Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 215 (2004)); see also\nVarity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996) (In “inter-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npret[ing] ERISA’s fiduciary duties,” “courts may have to\ntake account of competing congressional purposes, such as\nCongress’ desire to offer employees enhanced protection\nfor their benefits, on the one hand, and, on the other, its\ndesire not to create a system that is so complex that ad-\nministrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discour-\nage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the\nfirst place”).\n   At the same time, we do not believe that the presump-\ntion at issue here is an appropriate way to weed out merit-\nless lawsuits or to provide the requisite “balancing.” The\nproposed presumption makes it impossible for a plaintiff\nto state a duty-of-prudence claim, no matter how meritori-\nous, unless the employer is in very bad economic circum-\nstances. Such a rule does not readily divide the plausible\nsheep from the meritless goats. That important task can\nbe better accomplished through careful, context-sensitive\nscrutiny of a complaint’s allegations. We consequently\nstand by our conclusion that the law does not create a\nspecial presumption of prudence for ESOP fiduciaries.\n                             IV\n  We consider more fully one important mechanism for\nweeding out meritless claims, the motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim. That mechanism, which gave rise\nto the lower court decisions at issue here, requires careful\njudicial consideration of whether the complaint states a\nclaim that the defendant has acted imprudently. See Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662,\n677–680 (2009); Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S.\n544, 554–563 (2007). Because the content of the duty of\nprudence turns on “the circumstances . . . prevailing” at\nthe time the fiduciary acts, §1104(a)(1)(B), the appropriate\ninquiry will necessarily be context specific.\n  The District Court in this case granted petitioners’\nmotion to dismiss the complaint because it held that re-\n16       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspondents could not overcome the presumption of pru-\ndence. The Court of Appeals, by contrast, concluded that\nno presumption applied. And we agree with that conclu-\nsion. The Court of Appeals, however, went on to hold that\nrespondents had stated a plausible duty-of-prudence\nclaim. 692 F. 3d, at 419–420. The arguments made here,\nalong with our review of the record, convince us that the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals should be vacated and\nthe case remanded. On remand, the Court of Appeals\nshould apply the pleading standard as discussed in\nTwombly and Iqbal in light of the following considerations.\n                              A\n  Respondents allege that, as of July 2007, petitioners\nknew or should have known in light of publicly available\ninformation, such as newspaper articles, that continuing\nto hold and purchase Fifth Third stock was imprudent.\nApp. 48–53. The complaint alleges, among other things,\nthat petitioners “continued to allow the Plan’s investment\nin Fifth Third Stock even during the time that the stock\nprice was declining in value as a result of [the] collapse of\nthe housing market” and that “[a] prudent fiduciary facing\nsimilar circumstances would not have stood idly by as the\nPlan’s assets were decimated.” Id., at 53.\n  In our view, where a stock is publicly traded, allegations\nthat a fiduciary should have recognized from publicly\navailable information alone that the market was over- or\nundervaluing the stock are implausible as a general rule,\nat least in the absence of special circumstances. Many\ninvestors take the view that “ ‘they have little hope of\noutperforming the market in the long run based solely on\ntheir analysis of publicly available information,’ ” and\naccordingly they “ ‘rely on the security’s market price as an\nunbiased assessment of the security’s value in light of all\npublic information.’ ” Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John\nFund, Inc. ___ U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11–12)\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(quoting Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and\nTrust Funds, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5)).\nERISA fiduciaries, who likewise could reasonably see\n“little hope of outperforming the market . . . based solely\non their analysis of publicly available information,” ibid.,\nmay, as a general matter, likewise prudently rely on the\nmarket price.\n   In other words, a fiduciary usually “is not imprudent to\nassume that a major stock market . . . provides the best\nestimate of the value of the stocks traded on it that is\navailable to him.” Summers v. State Street Bank & Trust\nCo., 453 F. 3d 404, 408 (CA7 2006); see also White, 714\nF. 3d, at 992 (A fiduciary’s “fail[ure] to outsmart a pre-\nsumptively efficient market . . . is . . . not a sound basis for\nimposing liability”); cf. Quan, 623 F. 3d, at 881 (“Fiduciar-\nies are not expected to predict the future of the company\nstock’s performance”).\n   We do not here consider whether a plaintiff could none-\ntheless plausibly allege imprudence on the basis of pub-\nlicly available information by pointing to a special circum-\nstance affecting the reliability of the market price as “ ‘an\nunbiased assessment of the security’s value in light of all\npublic information,’ ” Halliburton Co., supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 12) (quoting Amgen Inc., supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n5)), that would make reliance on the market’s valuation\nimprudent. In this case, the Court of Appeals held that\nthe complaint stated a claim because respondents “allege\nthat Fifth Third engaged in lending practices that were\nequivalent to participation in the subprime lending mar-\nket, that Defendants were aware of the risks of such in-\nvestments by the start of the class period, and that such\nrisks made Fifth Third stock an imprudent investment.”\n692 F. 3d, at 419–420. The Court of Appeals did not point\nto any special circumstance rendering reliance on the\nmarket price imprudent. The court’s decision to deny\ndismissal therefore appears to have been based on an\n18       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nerroneous understanding of the prudence of relying on\nmarket prices.\n                              B\n   Respondents also claim that petitioners behaved impru-\ndently by failing to act on the basis of nonpublic infor-\nmation that was available to them because they were Fifth\nThird insiders. In particular, the complaint alleges that\npetitioners had inside information indicating that the\nmarket was overvaluing Fifth Third stock and that they\ncould have used this information to prevent losses to the\nfund by (1) selling the ESOP’s holdings of Fifth Third\nstock; (2) refraining from future stock purchases (includ-\ning by removing the Plan’s ESOP option altogether); or (3)\npublicly disclosing the inside information so that the\nmarket would correct the stock price downward, with the\nresult that the ESOP could continue to buy Fifth Third\nstock without paying an inflated price for it. See App. 17,\n88–89, 113.\n   To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence on\nthe basis of inside information, a plaintiff must plausibly\nallege an alternative action that the defendant could have\ntaken that would have been consistent with the securities\nlaws and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circum-\nstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the\nfund than to help it. The following three points inform the\nrequisite analysis.\n   First, in deciding whether the complaint states a claim\nupon which relief can be granted, courts must bear in\nmind that the duty of prudence, under ERISA as under\nthe common law of trusts, does not require a fiduciary to\nbreak the law. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts §166,\nComment a (“The trustee is not under a duty to the bene-\nficiary to do an act which is criminal or tortious”). Federal\nsecurities laws “are violated when a corporate insider\ntrades in the securities of his corporation on the basis of\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmaterial, nonpublic information.”         United States v.\nO’Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651–652 (1997). As every Court\nof Appeals to address the question has held, ERISA’s duty\nof prudence cannot require an ESOP fiduciary to perform\nan action—such as divesting the fund’s holdings of the\nemployer’s stock on the basis of inside information—that\nwould violate the securities laws. See, e.g., Rinehart v.\nAkers, 722 F. 3d 137, 146–147 (CA2 2013); Kirschbaum v.\nReliant Energy, Inc., 526 F. 3d 243, 256 (CA5 2008); White,\nsupra, at 992; Quan, supra, at 881–882, and n. 8; Lanfear\nv. Home Depot, Inc., 679 F. 3d 1267, 1282 (CA11 2012). To\nthe extent that the Sixth Circuit denied dismissal based\non the theory that the duty of prudence required petition-\ners to sell the ESOP’s holdings of Fifth Third stock, its\ndenial of dismissal was erroneous.\n   Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing\nto decide, on the basis of the inside information, to refrain\nfrom making additional stock purchases or for failing to\ndisclose that information to the public so that the stock\nwould no longer be overvalued, additional considerations\narise. The courts should consider the extent to which an\nERISA-based obligation either to refrain on the basis of\ninside information from making a planned trade or to\ndisclose inside information to the public could conflict with\nthe complex insider trading and corporate disclosure\nrequirements imposed by the federal securities laws or\nwith the objectives of those laws. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1144(d)\n(“Nothing in this subchapter [which includes §1104] shall\nbe construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair,\nor supersede any law of the United States . . . or any rule\nor regulation issued under any such law”); Black & Decker\nDisability Plan v. Nord, 538 U. S. 822, 831 (2003)\n(“Although Congress ‘expect[ed]’ courts would develop ‘a fed-\neral common law of rights and obligations under ERISA-\nregulated plans,’ the scope of permissible judicial innova-\ntion is narrower in areas where other federal actors are\n20       FIFTH THIRD BANCORP v. DUDENHOEFFER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nengaged” (quoting Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S.\n41, 56 (1987); citation omitted)); Varity Corp., 516 U. S., at\n506 (reserving the question “whether ERISA fiduciaries\nhave any fiduciary duty to disclose truthful information on\ntheir own initiative, or in response to employee inquiries”).\nThe U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not\nadvised us of its views on these matters, and we believe\nthose views may well be relevant.\n  Third, lower courts faced with such claims should also\nconsider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that\na prudent fiduciary in the defendant’s position could not\nhave concluded that stopping purchases—which the mar-\nket might take as a sign that insider fiduciaries viewed\nthe employer’s stock as a bad investment—or publicly\ndisclosing negative information would do more harm than\ngood to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a\nconcomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by\nthe fund.\n                        *     *    *\n  We leave it to the courts below to apply the foregoing to\nthe complaint in this case in the first instance. The judg-\nment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is va-\ncated and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2680438/", "sha1": "c74d0709ddf84dde899ced8a4837b740ee06f54d", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-066", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-25T08:01:06.908707"}
