Argued January 13, 2014\u2014Decided June 26, 2014\nRespondent Noel Canning, a Pepsi-Cola distributor, asked the D. C.\n  Circuit to set aside an order of the National Labor Relations Board,\n  claiming that the Board lacked a quorum because three of the five\n  Board members had been invalidly appointed. The nominations of\n  the three members in question were pending in the Senate when it\n  passed a December 17, 2011, resolution providing for a series of \u201cpro\n  forma session[s],\u201d with \u201cno business . . . transacted,\u201d every Tuesday\n  and Friday through January 20, 2012. S. J., 112th Cong., 1st Sess.,\n  923. Invoking the Recess Appointments Clause\u2014which gives the\n  President the power \u201cto fill up all Vacancies that may happen during\n  the Recess of the Senate,\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 3\u2014the President appointed\n  the three members in question between the January 3 and January 6\n  pro forma sessions. Noel Canning argued primarily that the ap-\n  pointments were invalid because the 3-day adjournment between\n  those two sessions was not long enough to trigger the Recess Ap-\n  pointments Clause. The D. C. Circuit agreed that the appointments\n  fell outside the scope of the Clause, but on different grounds. It held\n  that the phrase \u201cthe recess,\u201d as used in the Clause, does not include\n  intra-session recesses, and that the phrase \u201cvacancies that may hap-\n  pen during the recess\u201d applies only to vacancies that first come into\n  existence during a recess.\nHeld:\n    1. The Recess Appointments Clause empowers the President to fill\n any existing vacancy during any recess\u2014intra-session or inter-\n session\u2014of sufficient length. Pp. 5\u201333.\n       (a) Two background considerations are relevant to the questions\n here. First, the Recess Appointments Clause is a subsidiary method\n2                        NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    for appointing officers of the United States. The Founders intended\n    the norm to be the method of appointment in Article II, \u00a72, cl. 2,\n    which requires Senate approval of Presidential nominations, at least\n    for principal officers. The Recess Appointments Clause reflects the\n    tension between the President\u2019s continuous need for \u201cthe assistance\n    of subordinates,\u201d Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 117, and the\n    Senate\u2019s early practice of meeting for a single brief session each year.\n    The Clause should be interpreted as granting the President the pow-\n    er to make appointments during a recess but not offering the Presi-\n    dent the authority routinely to avoid the need for Senate confirma-\n    tion.\n       Second, in interpreting the Clause, the Court puts significant\n    weight upon historical practice. The longstanding \u201cpractice of the\n    government,\u201d McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401, can inform\n    this Court\u2019s determination of \u201cwhat the law is\u201d in a separation-of-\n    powers case, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176. See also, e.g.,\n    Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 401; The Pocket Veto Case,\n    279 U. S. 655, 689\u2013690. There is a great deal of history to consider\n    here, for Presidents have made recess appointments since the begin-\n    ning of the Republic. Their frequency suggests that the Senate and\n    President have recognized that such appointments can be both neces-\n    sary and appropriate in certain circumstances. The Court, in inter-\n    preting the Clause for the first time, must hesitate to upset the com-\n    promises and working arrangements that the elected branches of\n    Government themselves have reached. Pp. 5\u20139.\n         (b) The phrase \u201cthe recess of the Senate\u201d applies to both inter-\n    session recess (i.e., breaks between formal sessions of the Senate) and\n    intra-session recesses (i.e., breaks in the midst of a formal session) of\n    substantial length. The constitutional text is ambiguous. Founding-\n    era dictionaries and usages show that the phrase \u201cthe recess\u201d can en-\n    compass intra-session breaks. And this broader interpretation is\n    demanded by the purpose of the Clause, which is to allow the Presi-\n    dent to make appointments so as to ensure the continued functioning\n    of the Government while the Senate is away. The Senate is equally\n    away and unavailable to participate in the appointments process dur-\n    ing both an inter-session and an intra-session recess. History offers\n    further support for this interpretation. From the founding until the\n    Great Depression, every time the Senate took a substantial, non-\n    holiday intra-session recess, the President made recess appoint-\n    ments. President Andrew Johnson made the first documented intra-\n    session recess appointments in 1867 and 1868, and Presidents made\n    similar appointments in 1921 and 1929. Since 1929, and particularly\n    since the end of World War II, Congress has shortened its inter-\n    session breaks and taken longer and more frequent intra-session\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nbreaks; Presidents accordingly have made more intra-session recess\nappointments. Meanwhile, the Senate has never taken any formal\naction to deny the validity of intra-session recess appointments. In\n1905, the Senate Judiciary Committee defined \u201cthe recess\u201d as \u201cthe\nperiod of time when the Senate\u201d is absent and cannot \u201cparticipate as\na body in making appointments,\u201d S. Rep. No. 4389, 58th Cong., 3d\nSess., p. 2, and that functional definition encompasses both intra-\nsession and inter-session recesses. A 1940 law regulating the pay-\nment of recess appointees has also been interpreted functionally by\nthe Comptroller General (an officer of the Legislative Branch). In\nsum, Presidents have made intra-session recess appointments for a\ncentury and a half, and the Senate has never taken formal action to\noppose them. That practice is long enough to entitle it to \u201cgreat\nweight in a proper interpretation\u201d of the constitutional provision.\nThe Pocket Veto Case, supra, at 689.\n   The Clause does not say how long a recess must be in order to fall\nwithin the Clause, but even the Solicitor General concedes that a 3-\nday recess would be too short. The Adjournments Clause, Art. I, \u00a75,\ncl. 4, reflects the fact that a 3-day break is not a significant interrup-\ntion of legislative business. A Senate recess that is so short that it\ndoes not require the consent of the House under that Clause is not\nlong enough to trigger the President\u2019s recess-appointment power.\nMoreover, the Court has not found a single example of a recess ap-\npointment made during an intra-session recess that was shorter than\n10 days. There are a few examples of inter-session recess appoint-\nments made during recesses of less than 10 days, but these are\nanomalies. In light of historical practice, a recess of more than 3\ndays but less than 10 days is presumptively too short to fall within\nthe Clause. The word \u201cpresumptively\u201d leaves open the possibility\nthat a very unusual circumstance could demand the exercise of the\nrecess-appointment power during a shorter break. Pp. 9\u201321.\n     (c) The phrase \u201cvacancies that may happen during the recess of\nthe Senate,\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 3, applies both to vacancies that first come\ninto existence during a recess and to vacancies that initially occur be-\nfore a recess but continue to exist during the recess. Again, the text\nis ambiguous. As Thomas Jefferson observed, the Clause is \u201ccertain-\nly susceptible of [two] constructions.\u201d Letter to Wilson Cary Nicholas\n(Jan. 26, 1802), in 36 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 433. It \u201cmay mean\n\u2018vacancies that may happen to be\u2019 or \u2018may happen to fall\u2019 \u201d during a\nrecess. Ibid. And, as Attorney General Wirt wrote in 1821, the\nbroader reading is more consonant with the \u201creason and spirit\u201d of the\nClause. 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 632. The purpose of the Clause is to permit\nthe President, who is always acting to execute the law, to obtain the\nassistance of subordinate officers while the Senate, which acts only in\n4                       NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    intervals, is unavailable to confirm them. If a vacancy arises too late\n    in the session for the President and Senate to have an opportunity to\n    select a replacement, the narrower reading could paralyze important\n    functions of the Federal Government, particularly at the time of the\n    founding. The broader interpretation ensures that offices needing to\n    be filled can be filled. It does raise a danger that the President may\n    attempt to use the recess-appointment power to circumvent the Sen-\n    ate\u2019s advice and consent role. But the narrower interpretation risks\n    undermining constitutionally conferred powers more seriously and\n    more often. It would prevent a President from making any recess\n    appointment to fill a vacancy that arose before a recess, no matter\n    who the official, how dire the need, how uncontroversial the appoint-\n    ment, and how late in the session the office fell vacant.\n       Historical practice also strongly favors the broader interpretation.\n    The tradition of applying the Clause to pre-recess vacancies dates at\n    least to President Madison. Nearly every Attorney General to con-\n    sider the question has approved the practice, and every President\n    since James Buchanan has made recess appointments to pre-existing\n    vacancies. It is a fair inference from the historical data that a large\n    proportion of recess appointments over our Nation\u2019s history have\n    filled pre-recess vacancies. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1863\n    did issue a report disagreeing with the broader interpretation, and\n    Congress passed a law known as the Pay Act prohibiting payment of\n    recess appointments to pre-recess vacancies soon after. However, the\n    Senate subsequently abandoned its hostility. In 1940, the Senate\n    amended the Pay Act to permit payment of recess appointees in cir-\n    cumstances that would be unconstitutional under the narrower in-\n    terpretation. In short, Presidents have made recess appointments to\n    preexisting vacancies for two centuries, and the Senate as a body has\n    not countered this practice for nearly three-quarters of a century,\n    perhaps longer. The Court is reluctant to upset this traditional prac-\n    tice where doing so would seriously shrink the authority that Presi-\n    dents have believed existed and have exercised for so long. Pp. 21\u2013\n    33.\n       2. For purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is\n    in session when it says that it is, provided that, under its own rules,\n    it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.\n       This standard is consistent with the Constitution\u2019s broad delega-\n    tion of authority to the Senate to determine how and when to conduct\n    its business, as recognized by this Court\u2019s precedents. See Art. I, \u00a75,\n    cl. 2; Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 672; United States\n    v. Ballin, 144 U. S. 1, 5, 9. Although the Senate\u2019s own determination\n    of when it is and is not in session should be given great weight, the\n    Court\u2019s deference cannot be absolute. When the Senate is without\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  the capacity to act, under its own rules, it is not in session even if it\n  so declares.\n    Under the standard set forth here, the Senate was in session dur-\n  ing the pro forma sessions at issue. It said it was in session, and\n  Senate rules make clear that the Senate retained the power to con-\n  duct business. The Senate could have conducted business simply by\n  passing a unanimous consent agreement. In fact, it did so; it passed\n  a bill by unanimous consent during its pro forma session on Decem-\n  ber 23, 2011. See 2011 S. J. 924; Pub. L. 112\u201378. The Court will not,\n  as the Solicitor General urges, engage in an in-depth factual apprais-\n  al of what the Senate actually did during its pro forma sessions in or-\n  der to determine whether it was in recess or in session for purposes of\n  the Recess Appointments Clause.\n    Because the Senate was in session during its pro forma sessions,\n  the President made the recess appointments at issue during a 3-day\n  recess. Three days is too short a time to bring a recess within the\n  scope of the Clause, so the President lacked the authority to make\n  those appointments.

NOEL CANNING, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 26, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Ordinarily the President must obtain \u201cthe Advice and\nConsent of the Senate\u201d before appointing an \u201cOffice[r] of\nthe United States.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. But the\nRecess Appointments Clause creates an exception. It\ngives the President alone the power \u201cto fill up all Vacan\u00ad\ncies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by\ngranting Commissions which shall expire at the End of\ntheir next Session.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 3. We here consider\nthree questions about the application of this Clause.\n  The first concerns the scope of the words \u201crecess of the\nSenate.\u201d Does that phrase refer only to an inter-session\nrecess (i.e., a break between formal sessions of Congress),\nor does it also include an intra-session recess, such as a\nsummer recess in the midst of a session? We conclude\nthat the Clause applies to both kinds of recess.\n  The second question concerns the scope of the words\n\u201cvacancies that may happen.\u201d Does that phrase refer only\nto vacancies that first come into existence during a recess,\nor does it also include vacancies that arise prior to a recess\nbut continue to exist during the recess? We conclude that\n2                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nthe Clause applies to both kinds of vacancy.\n  The third question concerns calculation of the length of\na \u201crecess.\u201d The President made the appointments here at\nissue on January 4, 2012. At that time the Senate was in\nrecess pursuant to a December 17, 2011, resolution provid\u00ad\ning for a series of brief recesses punctuated by \u201cpro forma\nsession[s],\u201d with \u201cno business . . . transacted,\u201d every Tues\u00ad\nday and Friday through January 20, 2012. S. J., 112th\nCong., 1st Sess., 923 (2011) (hereinafter 2011 S. J.). In\ncalculating the length of a recess are we to ignore the pro\nforma sessions, thereby treating the series of brief recesses\nas a single, month-long recess? We conclude that we\ncannot ignore these pro forma sessions.\n  Our answer to the third question means that, when the\nappointments before us took place, the Senate was in the\nmidst of a 3-day recess. Three days is too short a time to\nbring a recess within the scope of the Clause. Thus we\nconclude that the President lacked the power to make the\nrecess appointments here at issue.\n                             I\n  The case before us arises out of a labor dispute. The\nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found that a\nPepsi-Cola distributor, Noel Canning, had unlawfully\nrefused to reduce to writing and execute a collective\u00ad\nbargaining agreement with a labor union. The Board\nordered the distributor to execute the agreement and to\nmake employees whole for any losses. Noel Canning, 358\nN. L. R. B. No. 4 (2012).\n  The Pepsi-Cola distributor subsequently asked the\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to set\nthe Board\u2019s order aside. It claimed that three of the five\nBoard members had been invalidly appointed, leaving the\nBoard without the three lawfully appointed members\nnecessary for it to act. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7160(f) (providing\nfor judicial review); \u00a7153(a) (providing for a 5-member\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nBoard); \u00a7153(b) (providing for a 3-member quorum); New\nProcess Steel, L. P. v. NLRB, 560 U. S. 674, 687\u2013688\n(2010) (in the absence of a lawfully appointed quorum, the\nBoard cannot exercise its powers).\n  The three members in question were Sharon Block,\nRichard Griffin, and Terence Flynn. In 2011 the President\nhad nominated each of them to the Board. As of January\n2012, Flynn\u2019s nomination had been pending in the Senate\nawaiting confirmation for approximately a year. The\nnominations of each of the other two had been pending for\na few weeks. On January 4, 2012, the President, invoking\nthe Recess Appointments Clause, appointed all three to\nthe Board.\n  The distributor argued that the Recess Appointments\nClause did not authorize those appointments. It pointed\nout that on December 17, 2011, the Senate, by unanimous\nconsent, had adopted a resolution providing that it would\ntake a series of brief recesses beginning the following day.\nSee 2011 S. J. 923. Pursuant to that resolution, the Sen\u00ad\nate held pro forma sessions every Tuesday and Friday\nuntil it returned for ordinary business on January 23,\n2012. Ibid.; 158 Cong. Rec. S1\u2013S11 (Jan. 3\u201320, 2012). The\nPresident\u2019s January 4 appointments were made between\nthe January 3 and January 6 pro forma sessions. In the\ndistributor\u2019s view, each pro forma session terminated the\nimmediately preceding recess. Accordingly, the appoint\u00ad\nments were made during a 3-day adjournment, which is\nnot long enough to trigger the Recess Appointments\nClause.\n  The Court of Appeals agreed that the appointments fell\noutside the scope of the Clause. But the court set forth\ndifferent reasons. It held that the Clause\u2019s words \u201cthe\nrecess of the Senate\u201d do not include recesses that occur\nwithin a formal session of Congress, i.e., intra-session\nrecesses. Rather those words apply only to recesses be-\ntween those formal sessions, i.e., inter-session recesses.\n4                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nSince the second session of the 112th Congress began on\nJanuary 3, 2012, the day before the President\u2019s appoint\u00ad\nments, those appointments occurred during an intra\u00ad\nsession recess, and the appointments consequently fell\noutside the scope of the Clause. 705 F. 3d 490, 499\u2013507\n(CADC 2013).\n   The Court of Appeals added that, in any event, the\nphrase \u201cvacancies that may happen during the recess\u201d\napplies only to vacancies that come into existence during a\nrecess. Id., at 507\u2013512. The vacancies that Members\nBlock, Griffin, and Flynn were appointed to fill had arisen\nbefore the beginning of the recess during which they were\nappointed. For this reason too the President\u2019s appoint\u00ad\nments were invalid. And, because the Board lacked a\nquorum of validly appointed members when it issued its\norder, the order was invalid. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7153(b); New\nProcess Steel, supra.\n   We granted the Solicitor General\u2019s petition for certio\u00ad\nrari. We asked the parties to address not only the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 interpretation of the Clause but also the distribu\u00ad\ntor\u2019s initial argument, namely, \u201c[w]hether the President\u2019s\nrecess-appointment power may be exercised when the\nSenate is convening every three days in pro forma ses\u00ad\nsions.\u201d 570 U. S. ___ (2013).\n   We shall answer all three questions presented. We\nrecognize that the President has nominated others to fill\nthe positions once occupied by Members Block, Griffin,\nand Flynn, and that the Senate has confirmed these suc\u00ad\ncessors. But, as the parties recognize, the fact that the\nBoard now unquestionably has a quorum does not moot\nthe controversy about the validity of the previously en\u00ad\ntered Board order.

Bearden,\nThe Noel Canning Decision and Recess Appointments\nMade from 1981\u20132013, p. 28 (Feb. 4, 2013) (hereinaf\u00ad\nter The Noel Canning Decision); NLRB, Members of\nthe NLRB since 1935, online at http://www.nlrb.gov/\nwho-we-are/board/members-nlrb-1935 (all Internet mate\u00ad\nrials as visited June 24, 2014, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file). Other cases involving similar challenges\nare also pending in the Courts of Appeals. E.g., NLRB v.\nNew Vista Nursing & Rehabilitation, No. 11\u20133440 etc.\n(CA3). Thus, we believe it is important to answer all three\nquestions that this case presents.\n                             II\n  Before turning to the specific questions presented, we\nshall mention two background considerations that we find\nrelevant to all three. First, the Recess Appointments\nClause sets forth a subsidiary, not a primary, method for\nappointing officers of the United States. The immediately\npreceding Clause\u2014Article II, Section 2, Clause 2\u2014\nprovides the primary method of appointment. It says that\nthe President \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice\nand Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors,\nother public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme\nCourt, and all other Officers of the United States\u201d (empha\u00ad\nsis added).\n  The Federalist Papers make clear that the Founders\nintended this method of appointment, requiring Senate\napproval, to be the norm (at least for principal officers).\nAlexander Hamilton wrote that the Constitution vests the\npower of nomination in the President alone because \u201cone\nman of discernment is better fitted to analise and estimate\nthe peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices, than a\nbody of men of equal, or perhaps even of superior discern\u00ad\n6                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nment.\u201d The Federalist No. 76, p. 510 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).\nAt the same time, the need to secure Senate approval\nprovides \u201can excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in\nthe President, and would tend greatly to preventing the\nappointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from\nfamily connection, from personal attachment, or from a\nview to popularity.\u201d Id., at 513. Hamilton further ex\u00ad\nplained that the\n    \u201cordinary power of appointment is confided to the\n    President and Senate jointly, and can therefore only\n    be exercised during the session of the Senate; but as it\n    would have been improper to oblige this body to be\n    continually in session for the appointment of officers;\n    and as vacancies might happen in their recess, which\n    it might be necessary for the public service to fill\n    without delay, the succeeding clause is evidently in\u00ad\n    tended to authorise the President singly to make tem\u00ad\n    porary appointments.\u201d Id., No. 67, at 455.\n   Thus the Recess Appointments Clause reflects the ten\u00ad\nsion between, on the one hand, the President\u2019s continuous\nneed for \u201cthe assistance of subordinates,\u201d Myers v. United\nStates, 272 U. S. 52, 117 (1926), and, on the other, the\nSenate\u2019s practice, particularly during the Republic\u2019s early\nyears, of meeting for a single brief session each year, see\nArt. I, \u00a74, cl. 2; Amdt. 20, \u00a72 (requiring the Senate to\n\u201cassemble\u201d only \u201conce in every year\u201d); 3 J. Story, Commen\u00ad\ntaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71551, p.\n410 (1833) (it would be \u201cburthensome to the senate, and\nexpensive to the public\u201d to require the Senate to be \u201cper\u00ad\npetually in session\u201d). We seek to interpret the Clause as\ngranting the President the power to make appointments\nduring a recess but not offering the President the author\u00ad\nity routinely to avoid the need for Senate confirmation.\n   Second, in interpreting the Clause, we put significant\nweight upon historical practice. For one thing, the inter\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Long ago\nChief Justice Marshall wrote that\n    \u201ca doubtful question, one on which human reason may\n    pause, and the human judgment be suspended, in the\n    decision of which the great principles of liberty are not\n    concerned, but the respective powers of those who are\n    equally the representatives of the people, are to be ad-\n    justed; if not put at rest by the practice of the gov-\n    ernment, ought to receive a considerable impression\n    from that practice.\u201d McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat.\n    316, 401 (1819).\nAnd we later confirmed that \u201c[l]ong settled and estab-\nlished practice is a consideration of great weight in a\nproper interpretation of constitutional provisions\u201d regulat-\ning the relationship between Congress and the President.\nThe Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S. 655, 689 (1929); see also\nid., at 690 (\u201c[A] practice of at least twenty years duration\n\u2018on the part of the executive department, acquiesced in by\nthe legislative department, . . . is entitled to great regard\nin determining the true construction of a constitutional\nprovision the phraseology of which is in any respect of\ndoubtful meaning\u2019 \u201d (quoting State v. South Norwalk, 77\nConn. 257, 264, 58 A. 759, 761 (1904))).\n   We recognize, of course, that the separation of powers\ncan serve to safeguard individual liberty, Clinton v. City of\nNew York, 524 U. S. 417, 449\u2013450 (1998) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring), and that it is the \u201cduty of the judicial depart-\nment\u201d\u2014in a separation-of-powers case as in any other\u2014\u201cto\nsay what the law is,\u201d Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n177 (1803). But it is equally true that the longstanding\n\u201cpractice of the government,\u201d McCulloch, supra, at 401,\ncan inform our determination of \u201cwhat the law is,\u201d Mar-\nbury, supra, at 177.\n   That principle is neither new nor controversial. As\n8                    NLRB v.

And our cases have continually confirmed\nMadison\u2019s view. E.g., Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.\n361, 401 (1989); Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654,\n686 (1981); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343\nU. S. 579, 610\u2013611 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring);\nThe Pocket Veto Case, supra, at 689\u2013690; Ex parte Gross-\nman, 267 U. S. 87, 118\u2013119 (1925); United States v. Mid-\nwest Oil Co., 236 U. S. 459, 472\u2013474 (1915); McPherson v.\nBlacker, 146 U. S. 1, 27 (1892); McCulloch, supra; Stuart\nv. Laird, 1 Cranch 299 (1803).\n   These precedents show that this Court has treated\npractice as an important interpretive factor even when the\nnature or longevity of that practice is subject to dispute,\nand even when that practice began after the founding era.\nSee Mistretta, supra, 400\u2013401 (\u201cWhile these [practices]\nspawned spirited discussion and frequent criticism, . . .\n\u2018traditional ways of conducting government . . . give mean\u00ad\ning\u2019 to the Constitution\u201d (quoting Youngstown, supra, at\n610) (Frankfurter, J., concurring)); Regan, supra, at 684\n(\u201c[E]ven if the pre-1952 [practice] should be disregarded,\ncongressional acquiescence in [a practice] since that time\nsupports the President\u2019s power to act here\u201d); The Pocket\nVeto Case, supra, at 689\u2013690 (postfounding practice is\nentitled to \u201cgreat weight\u201d); Grossman, supra, at 118\u2013119\n(postfounding practice \u201cstrongly sustains\u201d a \u201cconstruction\u201d\nof the Constitution).\n   There is a great deal of history to consider here.

S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nand President have recognized that recess appointments\ncan be both necessary and appropriate in certain circum\u00ad\nstances. We have not previously interpreted the Clause,\nand, when doing so for the first time in more than 200\nyears, we must hesitate to upset the compromises and\nworking arrangements that the elected branches of Gov\u00ad\nernment themselves have reached.\n                               III\n   The first question concerns the scope of the phrase \u201cthe\nrecess of the Senate.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 3 (emphasis added).\nThe Constitution provides for congressional elections\nevery two years. And the 2-year life of each elected Con\u00ad\ngress typically consists of two formal 1-year sessions, each\nseparated from the next by an \u201cinter-session recess.\u201d\nCongressional Research Service, H. Hogue, Recess Ap\u00ad\npointments: Frequently Asked Questions 2 (2013). The\nSenate or the House of Representatives announces an\ninter-session recess by approving a resolution stating that\nit will \u201cadjourn sine die,\u201d i.e., without specifying a date to\nreturn (in which case Congress will reconvene when the\nnext formal session is scheduled to begin).\n   The Senate and the House also take breaks in the midst\nof a session. The Senate or the House announces any such\n\u201cintra-session recess\u201d by adopting a resolution stating that\nit will \u201cadjourn\u201d to a fixed date, a few days or weeks or\neven months later. All agree that the phrase \u201cthe recess of\nthe Senate\u201d covers inter-session recesses. The question is\nwhether it includes intra-session recesses as well.\n   In our view, the phrase \u201cthe recess\u201d includes an intra\u00ad\nsession recess of substantial length. Its words taken\nliterally can refer to both types of recess. Founding-era\ndictionaries define the word \u201crecess,\u201d much as we do today,\nsimply as \u201ca period of cessation from usual work.\u201d 13 The\nOxford English Dictionary 322\u2013323 (2d ed. 1989) (herein\u00ad\nafter OED) (citing 18th- and 19th-century sources for that\n10                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\ndefinition of \u201crecess\u201d); 2 N. Webster, An American Diction\u00ad\nary of the English Language (1828) (\u201c[r]emission or sus\u00ad\npension of business or procedure\u201d); 2 S. Johnson, A Dic\u00ad\ntionary of the English Language 1602\u20131603 (4th ed. 1773)\n(hereinafter Johnson) (same). The Founders themselves\nused the word to refer to intra-session, as well as to inter\u00ad\nsession, breaks. See, e.g., 3 Records of the Federal Con\u00ad\nvention of 1787, p. 76 (M. Farrand rev. 1966) (hereinafter\nFarrand) (letter from George Washington to John Jay\nusing \u201cthe recess\u201d to refer to an intra-session break of the\nConstitutional Convention); id., at 191 (speech of Luther\nMartin with a similar usage); 1 T. Jefferson, A Manual\nof Parliamentary Practice \u00a7LI, p. 165 (2d ed. 1812) (de\u00ad\nscribing a \u201crecess by adjournment\u201d which did not end a\nsession).\n   We recognize that the word \u201cthe\u201d in \u201cthe recess\u201d might\nsuggest that the phrase refers to the single break separat\u00ad\ning formal sessions of Congress. That is because the word\n\u201cthe\u201d frequently (but not always) indicates \u201ca particular\nthing.\u201d 2 Johnson 2003. But the word can also refer \u201cto a\nterm used generically or universally.\u201d 17 OED 879. The\nConstitution, for example, directs the Senate to choose a\nPresident pro tempore \u201cin the Absence of the Vice-\nPresident.\u201d Art. I, \u00a73, cl. 5 (emphasis added). And the\nFederalist Papers refer to the chief magistrate of an an\u00ad\ncient Achaean league who \u201cadministered the government\nin the recess of the Senate.\u201d The Federalist No. 18, at 113\n(J. Madison) (emphasis added). Reading \u201cthe\u201d generically\nin this way, there is no linguistic problem applying the\nClause\u2019s phrase to both kinds of recess. And, in fact, the\nphrase \u201cthe recess\u201d was used to refer to intra-session\nrecesses at the time of the founding. See, e.g., 3 Farrand\n76 (letter from Washington to Jay); New Jersey Legislative-\nCouncil Journal, 5th Sess., 1st Sitting 70, 2d Sitting 9\n(1781) (twice referring to a 4-month, intra-session break\nas \u201cthe Recess\u201d); see also Brief for Petitioner 14\u201316 (listing\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nexamples).\n   The constitutional text is thus ambiguous. And we\nbelieve the Clause\u2019s purpose demands the broader inter\u00ad\npretation. The Clause gives the President authority to\nmake appointments during \u201cthe recess of the Senate\u201d so\nthat the President can ensure the continued functioning of\nthe Federal Government when the Senate is away. The\nSenate is equally away during both an inter-session and\nan intra-session recess, and its capacity to participate in\nthe appointments process has nothing to do with the\nwords it uses to signal its departure.\n   History also offers strong support for the broad interpre\u00ad\ntation. We concede that pre-Civil War history is not help\u00ad\nful. But it shows only that Congress generally took long\nbreaks between sessions, while taking no significant intra\u00ad\nsession breaks at all (five times it took a break of a week\nor so at Christmas). See Appendix A, infra. Obviously, if\nthere are no significant intra-session recesses, there will\nbe no intra-session recess appointments. In 1867 and\n1868, Congress for the first time took substantial, non\u00ad\nholiday intra-session breaks, and President Andrew John\u00ad\nson made dozens of recess appointments. The Federal\nCourt of Claims upheld one of those specific appointments,\nwriting \u201c[w]e have no doubt that a vacancy occurring while\nthe Senate was thus temporarily adjourned\u201d during the\n\u201cfirst session of the Fortieth Congress\u201d was \u201clegally filled\nby appointment of the President alone.\u201d Gould v. United\nStates, 19 Ct. Cl. 593, 595\u2013596 (1884) (emphasis added).\nAttorney General Evarts also issued three opinions con\u00ad\ncerning the constitutionality of President Johnson\u2019s ap\u00ad\npointments, and it apparently did not occur to him that\nthe distinction between intra-session and inter-session\nrecesses was significant. See 12 Op. Atty. Gen. 449 (1868);\n12 Op. Atty. Gen. 455 (1868); 12 Op. Atty. Gen. 469 (1868).\nSimilarly, though the 40th Congress impeached President\nJohnson on charges relating to his appointment power, he\n12                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n                Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                      Opinion of the of the\n\nwas not accused of violating the Constitution by mak\u00ad\ning intra-session recess appointments. Hartnett, Recess\nAppointments of Article III Judges: Three Constitutional\nQuestions, 26 Cardozo L. Rev. 377, 409 (2005).\n   In all, between the founding and the Great Depression,\nCongress took substantial intra-session breaks (other than\nholiday breaks) in four years: 1867, 1868, 1921, and 1929.\nAppendix A, infra. And in each of those years the Presi\u00ad\ndent made intra-session recess appointments. See App. to\nBrief for Petitioner 1a\u201311a.\n   Since 1929, and particularly since the end of World War\nII, Congress has shortened its inter-session breaks as it\nhas taken longer and more frequent intra-session breaks;\nPresidents have correspondingly made more intra-session\nrecess appointments. Indeed, if we include military ap\u00ad\npointments, Presidents have made thousands of intra\u00ad\nsession recess appointments. Id., at 11a\u201364a. President\nFranklin Roosevelt, for example, commissioned Dwight\nEisenhower as a permanent Major General during an\nintra-session recess; President Truman made Dean Ache\u00ad\nson Under Secretary of State; and President George H. W.\nBush reappointed Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the\nFederal Reserve Board. Id., at 11a, 12a, 40a. JUSTICE\nSCALIA does not dispute any of these facts.\n   Not surprisingly, the publicly available opinions of\nPresidential legal advisers that we have found are nearly\nunanimous in determining that the Clause authorizes\nthese appointments. In 1921, for example, Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral Daugherty advised President Harding that he could\nmake intra-session recess appointments. He reasoned:\n     \u201cIf the President\u2019s power of appointment is to be de\u00ad\n     feated because the Senate takes an adjournment to a\n     specified date, the painful and inevitable result will be\n     measurably to prevent the exercise of governmental\n     functions.

Gen. 463,\n466 (1960).\n  We must note one contrary opinion authored by Presi\u00ad\ndent Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Attorney General Philander\nKnox. Knox advised the President that the Clause did not\ncover a 19\u2013day intra-session Christmas recess. 23 Op.\nAtty. Gen. 599 (1901). But in doing so he relied heavily\nupon the use of the word \u201cthe,\u201d a linguistic point that we\ndo not find determinative. See supra, at 10. And Knox all\nbut confessed that his interpretation ran contrary to the\nbasic purpose of the Clause. For it would permit the\nSenate to adjourn for \u201cseveral months,\u201d to a fixed date,\nand thereby \u201cseriously curtail the President\u2019s power of\nmaking recess appointments.\u201d 23 Op. Atty. Gen., at 603.\nMoreover, only three days before Knox gave his opinion,\nthe Solicitor of the Treasury came to the opposite conclu\u00ad\nsion. Reply Brief 7, n. 5. We therefore do not think Knox\u2019s\nisolated opinion can disturb the consensus advice within\nthe Executive Branch taking the opposite position.\n  What about the Senate? Since Presidents began making\nintra-session recess appointments, individual Senators\nhave taken differing views about the proper definition of\n\u201cthe recess.\u201d See, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec. 23234 (1984) (reso\u00ad\nlution introduced by Senator Byrd urging limits on the\nlength of applicable intra-session recesses); Brief for Sen.\nMitch McConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 26 (an intra\u00ad\n14                   NLRB v.

Rep. No. 4389, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 2 (hereinafter\n1905 Senate Report). At noon on December 7, 1903, the\nSenate President pro tempore had \u201cdeclare[d]\u201d a formal,\n\u201cextraordinary session\u201d of the Senate \u201cadjourned without\nday,\u201d and the next formal Senate session began immedi\u00ad\nately afterwards. 37 Cong. Rec. 544 (1903). President\nRoosevelt made over 160 recess appointments during the\ninstantaneous inter-session interval. The Judiciary Com\u00ad\nmittee, when stating its strong objection, defined \u201crecess\u201d\nin functional terms as\n     \u201cthe period of time when the Senate is not sitting in\n     regular or extraordinary session as a branch of the\n     Congress . . . ; when its members owe no duty of at\u00ad\n     tendance; when its Chamber is empty; when, because\n     of its absence, it can not receive communications from\n     the President or participate as a body in making ap\u00ad\n     pointments.\u201d 1905 Senate Report, at 2 (emphasis\n     deleted).\nThat functional definition encompasses intra-session, as\nwell as inter-session, recesses.

An earlier 1863 statute had denied\npay to individuals appointed to fill up vacancies first\narising prior to the beginning of a recess. The Senate\nJudiciary Committee then believed that those vacancies\nfell outside the scope of the Clause. See infra, at 30. In\n1940, however, the Senate amended the law to permit\nmany of those recess appointees to be paid. Act of July 11,\n54 Stat. 751. Interpreting the amendments in 1948, the\nComptroller General\u2014who, unlike the Attorney General,\nis an \u201cofficer of the Legislative Branch,\u201d Bowsher v. Synar,\n478 U. S. 714, 731 (1986)\u2014wrote:\n    \u201cI think it is clear that [the Pay Act amendments\u2019]\n    primary purpose was to relieve \u2018recess appointees\u2019 of\n    the burden of serving without compensation during\n    periods when the Senate is not actually sitting and is\n    not available to give its advice and consent in respect\n    to the appointment, irrespective of whether the recess\n    of the Senate is attributable to a final adjournment\n    sine die or to an adjournment to a specified date.\u201d 28\n    Comp. Gen. 30, 37.\n  We recognize that the Senate cannot easily register\nopposition as a body to every governmental action that\nmany, perhaps most, Senators oppose. But the Senate has\nnot been silent or passive regarding the meaning of the\nClause: A Senate Committee did register opposition to\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s use of the Clause, and the\n16                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nSenate as a whole has legislated in an effort to discourage\ncertain kinds of recess appointments. And yet we are not\naware of any formal action it has taken to call into ques\u00ad\ntion the broad and functional definition of \u201crecess\u201d first\nset out in the 1905 Senate Report and followed by the\nExecutive Branch since at least 1921. Nor has JUSTICE\nSCALIA identified any. All the while, the President has\nmade countless recess appointments during intra-session\nrecesses.\n   The upshot is that restricting the Clause to inter-session\nrecesses would frustrate its purpose. It would make the\nPresident\u2019s recess-appointment power dependent on a\nformalistic distinction of Senate procedure. Moreover, the\nPresident has consistently and frequently interpreted the\nword \u201crecess\u201d to apply to intra-session recesses, and has\nacted on that interpretation. The Senate as a body has\ndone nothing to deny the validity of this practice for at\nleast three-quarters of a century. And three-quarters of a\ncentury of settled practice is long enough to entitle a\npractice to \u201cgreat weight in a proper interpretation\u201d of the\nconstitutional provision. The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S.,\nat 689.\n   We are aware of, but we are not persuaded by, three\nimportant arguments to the contrary. First, some argue\nthat the Founders would likely have intended the Clause\nto apply only to inter-session recesses, for they hardly\nknew any other. See, e.g., Brief for Originalist Scholars as\nAmici Curiae 27\u201329. Indeed, from the founding until the\nCivil War inter-session recesses were the only kind of\nsignificant recesses that Congress took. The problem with\nthis argument, however, is that it does not fully describe\nthe relevant founding intent. The question is not: Did the\nFounders at the time think about intra-session recesses?\nPerhaps they did not. The question is: Did the Founders\nintend to restrict the scope of the Clause to the form of\ncongressional recess then prevalent, or did they intend a\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nbroader scope permitting the Clause to apply, where ap\u00ad\npropriate, to somewhat changed circumstances? The\nFounders knew they were writing a document designed to\napply to ever-changing circumstances over centuries.\nAfter all, a Constitution is \u201cintended to endure for ages to\ncome,\u201d and must adapt itself to a future that can only be\n\u201cseen dimly,\u201d if at all. McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415. We\ntherefore think the Framers likely did intend the Clause\nto apply to a new circumstance that so clearly falls within\nits essential purposes, where doing so is consistent with\nthe Clause\u2019s language.\n   Second, some argue that the intra-session interpretation\npermits the President to make \u201cillogic[ally]\u201d long recess\nappointments. Brief for Respondent Noel Canning 13;\npost, at 10 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). A recess\nappointment made between Congress\u2019 annual sessions\nwould permit the appointee to serve for about a year, i.e.,\nuntil the \u201cend\u201d of the \u201cnext\u201d Senate \u201csession.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72,\ncl. 3. But an intra-session appointment made at the be\u00ad\nginning or in the middle of a formal session could permit\nthe appointee to serve for 1\u00bd or almost 2 years (until the\nend of the following formal session).\n   We agree that the intra-session interpretation permits\nsomewhat longer recess appointments, but we do not agree\nthat this consequence is \u201cillogical.\u201d A President who\nmakes a recess appointment will often also seek to make a\nregular appointment, nominating the appointee and secur\u00ad\ning ordinary Senate confirmation. And the Clause ensures\nthat the President and Senate always have at least a full\nsession to go through the nomination and confirmation\nprocess. That process may take several months. See\nO\u2019Connell, Vacant Offices: Delays in Staffing Top Agency\nPositions, 82 S. Cal. L. Rev. 913, 967 (2009) (from 1987 to\n2005 the nomination and confirmation process took an\naverage of 236 days for noncabinet agency heads). A\nrecess appointment that lasts somewhat longer than a\n18                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nyear will ensure the President the continued assistance of\nsubordinates that the Clause permits him to obtain while\nhe and the Senate select a regular appointee. An ap\u00ad\npointment should last until the Senate has \u201can opportu\u00ad\nnity to act on the subject,\u201d Story, \u00a71551, at 410, and the\nClause embodies a determination that a full session is\nneeded to select and vet a replacement.\n  Third, the Court of Appeals believed that application of\nthe Clause to intra-session recesses would introduce\n\u201cvagueness\u201d into a Clause that was otherwise clear. 705\nF. 3d, at 504. One can find problems of uncertainty, how\u00ad\never, either way. In 1867, for example, President Andrew\nJohnson called a special session of Congress, which took\nplace during a lengthy intra-session recess. Consider the\nperiod of time that fell just after the conclusion of that\nspecial session. Did that period remain an intra-session\nrecess, or did it become an inter-session recess? Histori\u00ad\nans disagree about the answer. Compare Hartnett, 26\nCardozo L. Rev., at 408\u2013409, with Brief for Constitutional\nLaw Scholars as Amici Curiae 23\u201324.\n  Or suppose that Congress adjourns sine die, but it does\nso conditionally, so that the leadership can call the mem\u00ad\nbers back into session when \u201cthe public interest shall\nwarrant it.\u201d E.g., 155 Cong. Rec. 33429 (2009); 152 Cong.\nRec. 23731\u201323732 (2006); 150 Cong. Rec. 25925\u201325926\n(2004). If the Senate Majority Leader were to reconvene\nthe Senate, how would we characterize the preceding\nrecess? Is it still inter-session? On the narrower interpre\u00ad\ntation the label matters; on the broader it does not.\n  The greater interpretive problem is determining how\nlong a recess must be in order to fall within the Clause. Is\na break of a week, or a day, or an hour too short to count\nas a \u201crecess\u201d? The Clause itself does not say. And\nJUSTICE SCALIA claims that this silence itself shows that\nthe Framers intended the Clause to apply only to an inter\u00ad\nsession recess. Post, at 12\u201313.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          19\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\n  We disagree. For one thing, the most likely reason the\nFramers did not place a textual floor underneath the word\n\u201crecess\u201d is that they did not foresee the need for one. They\nmight have expected that the Senate would meet for a\nsingle session lasting at most half a year. The Federalist\nNo. 84, at 596 (A. Hamilton). And they might not have\nanticipated that intra-session recesses would become\nlengthier and more significant than inter-session ones.\nThe Framers\u2019 lack of clairvoyance on that point is not\ndispositive. Unlike JUSTICE SCALIA, we think it most\nconsistent with our constitutional structure to presume\nthat the Framers would have allowed intra-session recess\nappointments where there was a long history of such\npractice.\n  Moreover, the lack of a textual floor raises a problem\nthat plagues both interpretations\u2014JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s and\nours. Today a brief inter-session recess is just as possible\nas a brief intra-session recess. And though JUSTICE\nSCALIA says that the \u201cnotion that the Constitution em\u00ad\npowers the President to make unilateral appointments\nevery time the Senate takes a half-hour lunch break is so\nabsurd as to be self-refuting,\u201d he must immediately con\u00ad\ncede (in a footnote) that the President \u201ccan make recess\nappointments during any break between sessions, no\nmatter how short.\u201d Post, at 11, 15, n. 4 (emphasis added).\n  Even the Solicitor General, arguing for a broader inter\u00ad\npretation, acknowledges that there is a lower limit appli\u00ad\ncable to both kinds of recess. He argues that the lower\nlimit should be three days by analogy to the Adjournments\nClause of the Constitution. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. That\nClause says: \u201cNeither House, during the Session of Con\u00ad\ngress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for\nmore than three days.\u201d Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 4.\n  We agree with the Solicitor General that a 3-day recess\nwould be too short. (Under Senate practice, \u201cSunday is\ngenerally not considered a day,\u201d and so is not counted for\n20                   NLRB v.

Frumin, Riddick\u2019s Senate Procedure:\nPrecedents and Practices 1265 (hereinafter Riddick\u2019s).)\nThe Adjournments Clause reflects the fact that a 3-day\nbreak is not a significant interruption of legislative busi\u00ad\nness. As the Solicitor General says, it is constitutionally\nde minimis. Brief for Petitioner 18. A Senate recess that\nis so short that it does not require the consent of the\nHouse is not long enough to trigger the President\u2019s recess\u00ad\nappointment power.\n   That is not to say that the President may make recess\nappointments during any recess that is \u201cmore than three\ndays.\u201d Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 4. The Recess Appointments Clause\nseeks to permit the Executive Branch to function smoothly\nwhen Congress is unavailable. And though Congress has\ntaken short breaks for almost 200 years, and there have\nbeen many thousands of recess appointments in that time,\nwe have not found a single example of a recess ap\u00ad\npointment made during an intra-session recess that was\nshorter than 10 days. Nor has the Solicitor General. Reply\nBrief 23. Indeed, the Office of Legal Counsel once infor\u00ad\nmally advised against making a recess appointment dur\u00ad\ning a 6-day intra-session recess. 3 Op. OLC, at 315\u2013316.\nThe lack of examples suggests that the recess\u00ad\nappointment power is not needed in that context. (The\nlength of a recess is \u201cordinarily calculated by counting the\ncalendar days running from the day after the recess begins\nand including the day the recess ends.\u201d 36 Op. OLC, at\n___, n. 1 (citation omitted).)\n   There are a few historical examples of recess appoint\u00ad\nments made during inter-session recesses shorter than 10\ndays. We have already discussed President Theodore\nRoosevelt\u2019s appointments during the instantaneous, \u201cficti\u00ad\ntious\u201d recess. President Truman also made a recess ap\u00ad\npointment to the Civil Aeronautics Board during a 3-day\ninter-session recess. Hogue, Recess Appointments: Fre\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

President Taft made a\nfew appointments during a 9-day recess following his\ninauguration, and President Lyndon Johnson made sev-\neral appointments during an 8-day recess several weeks\nafter assuming office. Hogue, The Law: Recess Appoint-\nments to Article III Courts, 34 Presidential Studies Q.\n656, 671 (2004); 106 S. Exec. J. 2 (1964); 40 S. Exec. J. 12\n(1909). There may be others of which we are unaware.\nBut when considered against 200 years of settled practice,\nwe regard these few scattered examples as anomalies. We\ntherefore conclude, in light of historical practice, that a\nrecess of more than 3 days but less than 10 days is pre-\nsumptively too short to fall within the Clause. We add the\nword \u201cpresumptively\u201d to leave open the possibility that\nsome very unusual circumstance\u2014a national catastrophe,\nfor instance, that renders the Senate unavailable but calls\nfor an urgent response\u2014could demand the exercise of the\nrecess-appointment power during a shorter break. (It\nshould go without saying\u2014except that JUSTICE SCALIA\ncompels us to say it\u2014that political opposition in the Sen-\nate would not qualify as an unusual circumstance.)\n  In sum, we conclude that the phrase \u201cthe recess\u201d applies\nto both intra-session and inter-session recesses. If a Sen-\nate recess is so short that it does not require the consent of\nthe House, it is too short to trigger the Recess Appoint-\nments Clause. See Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 4. And a recess lasting\nless than 10 days is presumptively too short as well.\n                              IV\n  The second question concerns the scope of the phrase\n\u201cvacancies that may happen during the recess of the Sen-\nate.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 3 (emphasis added). All agree that the\nphrase applies to vacancies that initially occur during a\nrecess. But does it also apply to vacancies that initially\noccur before a recess and continue to exist during the\nrecess? In our view the phrase applies to both kinds of\n22                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nvacancy.\n   We believe that the Clause\u2019s language, read literally,\npermits, though it does not naturally favor, our broader\ninterpretation. We concede that the most natural mean\u00ad\ning of \u201chappens\u201d as applied to a \u201cvacancy\u201d (at least to a\nmodern ear) is that the vacancy \u201chappens\u201d when it ini\u00ad\ntially occurs. See 1 Johnson 913 (defining \u201chappen\u201d in\nrelevant part as meaning \u201c[t]o fall out; to chance; to come\nto pass\u201d). But that is not the only possible way to use the\nword.\n   Thomas Jefferson wrote that the Clause is \u201ccertainly\nsusceptible of [two] constructions.\u201d Letter to Wilson Cary\nNicholas (Jan. 26, 1802), in 36 Papers of Thomas Jefferson\n433 (B. Oberg ed., 2009). It \u201cmay mean \u2018vacancies that\nmay happen to be\u2019 or \u2018may happen to fall\u2019 \u201d during a recess.\nIbid. Jefferson used the phrase in the first sense when he\nwrote to a job seeker that a particular position was una\u00ad\nvailable, but that he (Jefferson) was \u201chappy that another\nvacancy happens wherein I can . . . avail the public of your\nintegrity & talents,\u201d for \u201cthe office of Treasurer of the US.\nis vacant by the resignation of mr Meredith.\u201d Letter to\nThomas Tudor Tucker (Oct. 31, 1801), in 35 id., at 530 (B.\nOberg ed. 2008) (emphasis added).

The\nbroader interpretation, he added, is \u201cmost accordant with\u201d\nthe Constitution\u2019s \u201creason and spirit.\u201d Id., at 632.\n    We can still understand this earlier use of \u201chappen\u201d if\nwe think of it used together with another word that, like\n\u201cvacancy,\u201d can refer to a continuing state, say, a financial\ncrisis. A statute that gives the President authority to act\nin respect to \u201cany financial crisis that may happen during\nhis term\u201d can easily be interpreted to include crises that\narise before, and continue during, that term. Perhaps that\nis why the Oxford English Dictionary defines \u201chappen\u201d in\npart as \u201cchance to be,\u201d rather than \u201cchance to occur.\u201d 6\nOED 1096 (emphasis added); see also 19 OED 383 (defin\u00ad\ning \u201cvacancy\u201d as the \u201ccondition of an office or post being\n. . . vacant\u201d).\n    In any event, the linguistic question here is not whether\nthe phrase can be, but whether it must be, read more\nnarrowly. The question is whether the Clause is ambigu\u00ad\nous. The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S., at 690. And the\nbroader reading, we believe, is at least a permissible\nreading of a \u201c \u2018doubtful\u2019 \u201d phrase. Ibid. We consequently go\non to consider the Clause\u2019s purpose and historical practice.\n    The Clause\u2019s purpose strongly supports the broader\ninterpretation. That purpose is to permit the President to\nobtain the assistance of subordinate officers when the\nSenate, due to its recess, cannot confirm them. Attorney\nGeneral Wirt clearly described how the narrower interpre\u00ad\ntation would undermine this purpose:\n    \u201cPut the case of a vacancy occurring in an office, held\n    in a distant part of the country, on the last day of the\n    Senate\u2019s session. Before the vacancy is made known\n    to the President, the Senate rises. The office may be\n    an important one; the vacancy may paralyze a whole\n    line of action in some essential branch of our internal\n    police; the public interests may imperiously demand\n24                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\n     that it shall be immediately filled. But the vacancy\n     happened to occur during the session of the Senate;\n     and if the President\u2019s power is to be limited to such\n     vacancies only as happen to occur during the recess of\n     the Senate, the vacancy in the case put must continue,\n     however ruinous the consequences may be to the pub\u00ad\n     lic.\u201d 1 Op. Atty. Gen., at 632.\nExamples are not difficult to imagine: An ambassadorial\npost falls vacant too soon before the recess begins for the\nPresident to appoint a replacement; the Senate rejects a\nPresident\u2019s nominee just before a recess, too late to select\nanother. Wirt explained that the \u201csubstantial purpose of\nthe constitution was to keep these offices filled,\u201d and \u201cif\nthe President shall not have the power to fill a vacancy\nthus circumstanced, . . . the substance of the constitution\nwill be sacrificed to a dubious construction of its letter.\u201d\nIbid. Thus the broader construction, encompassing vacan\u00ad\ncies that initially occur before the beginning of a recess, is\nthe \u201conly construction of the constitution which is compat\u00ad\nible with its spirit, reason, and purposes; while, at the\nsame time, it offers no violence to its language.\u201d Id., at\n633.\n  We do not agree with JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s suggestion that\nthe Framers would have accepted the catastrophe envi\u00ad\nsioned by Wirt because Congress can always provide for\nacting officers, see 5 U. S. C. \u00a73345, and the President can\nalways convene a special session of Congress, see U. S.\nConst., Art. II, \u00a73. Acting officers may have less authority\nthan Presidential appointments. 6 Op. OLC 119, 121\n(1982). Moreover, to rely on acting officers would lessen\nthe President\u2019s ability to staff the Executive Branch with\npeople of his own choosing, and thereby limit the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s control and political accountability.

The point of the Recess Appoint\u00ad\nments Clause was to avoid reliance on these inadequate\nexpedients.\n  At the same time, we recognize one important purpose\u00ad\nrelated consideration that argues in the opposite direction.\nA broad interpretation might permit a President to avoid\nSenate confirmations as a matter of course. If the Clause\ngives the President the power to \u201cfill up all vacancies\u201d that\noccur before, and continue to exist during, the Senate\u2019s\nrecess, a President might not submit any nominations to\nthe Senate. He might simply wait for a recess and then\nprovide all potential nominees with recess appointments.\nHe might thereby routinely avoid the constitutional need\nto obtain the Senate\u2019s \u201cadvice and consent.\u201d\n  Wirt thought considerations of character and politics\nwould prevent Presidents from abusing the Clause in this\nway. 1 Op. Atty. Gen., at 634. He might have added that\nsuch temptations should not often arise. It is often less\ndesirable for a President to make a recess appointment. A\nrecess appointee only serves a limited term. That, com\u00ad\nbined with the lack of Senate approval, may diminish the\nrecess appointee\u2019s ability, as a practical matter, to get a\ncontroversial job done. And even where the President and\nSenate are at odds over politically sensitive appointments,\ncompromise is normally possible. Indeed, the 1940 Pay\nAct amendments represent a general compromise, for they\nforesee payment of salaries to recess appointees where\nvacancies occur before the recess began but not too long\nbefore (namely, within 30 days before).           5 U.

Moreover, the Senate, like\nthe President, has institutional \u201cresources,\u201d including\npolitical resources, \u201cavailable to protect and assert its\ninterests.\u201d Goldwater v.

See Part V,\ninfra. In any event, the Executive Branch has adhered to\nthe broader interpretation for two centuries, and Senate\nconfirmation has always remained the norm for officers\nthat require it.\n   While we concede that both interpretations carry with\nthem some risk of undesirable consequences, we believe\nthe narrower interpretation risks undermining constitu-\ntionally conferred powers more seriously and more often.\nIt would prevent the President from making any recess\nappointment that arose before a recess, no matter who the\nofficial, no matter how dire the need, no matter how un-\ncontroversial the appointment, and no matter how late in\nthe session the office fell vacant. Overall, like Attorney\nGeneral Wirt, we believe the broader interpretation more\nconsistent with the Constitution\u2019s \u201creason and spirit.\u201d 1\nOp. Atty. Gen., at 632.\n   Historical practice over the past 200 years strongly\nfavors the broader interpretation. The tradition of apply-\ning the Clause to pre-recess vacancies dates at least to\nPresident James Madison. There is no undisputed record\nof Presidents George Washington, John Adams, or Thomas\nJefferson making such an appointment, though the Solici-\ntor General believes he has found records showing that\nPresidents Washington and Jefferson did so. We know\nthat Edmund Randolph, Washington\u2019s Attorney General,\nfavored a narrow reading of the Clause. Randolph be-\nlieved that the \u201cSpirit of the Constitution favors the par-\nticipation of the Senate in all appointments,\u201d though he\ndid not address\u2014let alone answer\u2014the powerful purpos-\nive and structural arguments subsequently made by At-\ntorney General Wirt. See Edmund Randolph\u2019s Opinion on\nRecess Appointments (July 7, 1792), in 24 Papers of\nThomas Jefferson 166 (J. Catanzariti ed. 1990).\n   President Adams seemed to endorse the broader view of\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

See\nLetter to J. McHenry (Apr. 16, 1799), in 8 Works of John\nAdams 632\u2013633 (C. Adams ed. 1853). His Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral, Charles Lee, later informed Jefferson that, in the\nAdams administration, \u201cwhenever an office became vacant\nso short a time before Congress rose, as not to give an\nopportunity of enquiring for a proper character, they let it\nlie always till recess.\u201d 36 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 433.\nWe know that President Jefferson thought that the broad\ninterpretation was linguistically supportable, though his\nactual practice is not clear. But the evidence suggests\nthat James Madison\u2014as familiar as anyone with the\nworkings of the Constitutional Convention\u2014appointed\nTheodore Gaillard to replace a district judge who had left\noffice before a recess began. Hartnett, 26 Cardozo L. Rev.,\nat 400\u2013401. It also appears that in 1815 Madison signed a\nbill that created two new offices prior to a recess which he\nthen filled later during the recess. See Act of Mar. 3, ch.\n95, 3 Stat. 235; S. J. 13th Cong., 3d Sess., 689\u2013690 (1815);\n3 S. Exec. J. 19 (1828) (for Monday, Jan. 8, 1816). He also\nmade recess appointments to \u201cterritorial\u201d United States\nattorney and marshal positions, both of which had been\ncreated when the Senate was in session more than two\nyears before. Act of Feb. 27, 1813, ch. 35, 2 Stat. 806; 3 S.\nExec. J. 19. JUSTICE SCALIA refers to \u201cwritten evidence of\nMadison\u2019s own beliefs,\u201d post, at 36, but in fact we have no\ndirect evidence of what President Madison believed. We\nonly know that he declined to make one appointment to a\npre-recess vacancy after his Secretary of War advised him\nthat he lacked the power. On the other hand, he did\napparently make at least five other appointments to pre\u00ad\nrecess vacancies, as JUSTICE SCALIA does not dispute.\n   The next President, James Monroe, received and pre\u00ad\nsumably acted upon Attorney General Wirt\u2019s advice,\nnamely that \u201call vacancies which, from any casualty,\n28                     NLRB v.

Atty. Gen., at 633. Nearly every\nsubsequent Attorney General to consider the question\nthroughout the Nation\u2019s history has thought the same.\nE.g., 2 Op. Atty. Gen. 525, 528 (1832); 7 Op. Atty. Gen.\n186, 223 (1855); 10 Op. Atty. Gen. 356, 356\u2013357 (1862); 12\nOp. Atty. Gen. 32, 33 (1866); 12 Op. Atty. Gen., at 452; 14\nOp. Atty. Gen. 562, 564 (1875); 15 Op. Atty.

OLC 124, 161 (1996); 36 Op.\nOLC ___ (2012). Indeed, as early as 1862, Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral Bates advised President Lincoln that his power to fill\npre-recess vacancies was \u201csettled . . . as far . . . as a consti\u00ad\ntutional question can be settled,\u201d 10 Op. Atty. Gen., at\n356, and a century later Acting Attorney General Walsh\ngave President Eisenhower the same advice \u201cwithout any\ndoubt,\u201d 41 Op. Atty. Gen., at 466.\n  This power is important. The Congressional Research\nService is \u201cunaware of any official source of information\ntracking the dates of vacancies in federal offices.\u201d The\nNoel Canning Decision 3, n. 6. Nonetheless, we have\nenough information to believe that the Presidents since\nMadison have made many recess appointments filling\nvacancies that initially occurred prior to a recess. As we\nhave just said, nearly every 19th- and 20th-century Attor\u00ad\nney General expressing a view on the matter has agreed\nwith William Wirt, and Presidents tend to follow the legal\nadvice of their chief legal officers. Moreover, the Solicitor\nGeneral has compiled a list of 102 (mostly uncontested)\nrecess appointments made by Presidents going back to the\nfounding. App. to Brief for Petitioner 65a\u201389a. Given the\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          29\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\ndifficulty of finding accurate information about vacancy\ndates, that list is undoubtedly far smaller than the actual\nnumber. No one disputes that every President since\nJames Buchanan has made recess appointments to pre\u00ad\nexisting vacancies.\n   Common sense also suggests that many recess appoin\u00ad\ntees filled vacancies that arose before the recess began.\nWe have compared the list of intra-session recess ap\u00ad\npointments in the Solicitor General\u2019s brief with the chart\nof congressional recesses. Where a specific date of ap\u00ad\npointment can be ascertained, more than half of those\nintra-session appointments were made within two weeks\nof the beginning of a recess. That short window strongly\nsuggests that many of the vacancies initially arose prior to\nthe recess. See App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a\u201364a; Ap\u00ad\npendix A, infra. Thus, it is not surprising that the Con\u00ad\ngressional Research Service, after examining the vacancy\ndates associated with a random sample of 24 inter-session\nrecess appointments since 1981, concluded that \u201c[i]n most\nof the 24 cases, the preponderance of evidence indicated\nthat the vacancy arose prior to the recess during which the\nappointment was made.\u201d The Noel Canning Decision 3.\nFurther, with research assistance from the Supreme Court\nLibrary, we have examined a random sample of the recess\nappointments made by our two most recent Presidents,\nand have found that almost all of those appointments\nfilled pre-recess vacancies: Of a sample of 21 recess ap\u00ad\npointments, 18 filled pre-recess vacancies and only 1 filled\na vacancy that arose during the recess in which he was\nappointed. The precise date on which 2 of the vacancies\narose could not be determined. See Appendix B, infra.\nTaken together, we think it is a fair inference that a large\nproportion of the recess appointments in the history of the\nNation have filled pre-existing vacancies.\n   Did the Senate object? Early on, there was some spo\u00ad\nradic disagreement with the broad interpretation. In 1814\n30                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nSenator Gore said that if \u201cthe vacancy happen at another\ntime, it is not the case described by the Constitution.\u201d 26\nAnnals of Cong. 653. In 1822 a Senate committee, while\nfocusing on the President\u2019s power to fill a new vacancy\ncreated by statute, used language to the same effect. 38\nid., at 489, 500. And early Congresses enacted statutes\nauthorizing certain recess appointments, see post, at 31, a\nfact that may or may not suggest they accepted the nar\u00ad\nrower interpretation of the Clause. Most of those stat\u00ad\nutes\u2014including the one passed by the First Congress\u2014\nauthorized appointments to newly created offices, and may\nhave been addressed to the separate question of whether\nnew offices are vacancies within the meaning of the\nClause. See Letter from Alexander Hamilton to James\nMcHenry (May 3, 1799), in 23 Papers of Alexander Hamil\u00ad\nton 94 (H. Syrett ed. 1976) (\u201cVacancy is a relative term,\nand presupposes that the Office has been once filled\u201d);\nReply Brief 17. In any event, by 1862 Attorney General\nBates could still refer to \u201cthe unbroken acquiescence of the\nSenate\u201d in support of the broad interpretation. 10 Op.\nAtty. Gen., at 356.\n    Then in 1863 the Senate Judiciary Committee disagreed\nwith the broad interpretation. It issued a report conclud\u00ad\ning that a vacancy \u201cmust have its inceptive point after one\nsession has closed and before another session has begun.\u201d\nS. Rep. No. 80, 37th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 3. And the Senate\nthen passed the Pay Act, which provided that \u201cno money\nshall be paid . . . as a salary, to any person appointed\nduring the recess of the Senate, to fill a vacancy . . . which\n. . . existed while the Senate was in session.\u201d Act of Feb. 9,\n1863, \u00a72, 12 Stat. 646. Relying upon the floor statement of\na single Senator, JUSTICE SCALIA suggests that the pas\u00ad\nsage of the Pay Act indicates that the Senate as a whole\nendorsed the position in the 1863 Report. But the circum\u00ad\nstances are more equivocal. During the floor debate on the\nbill, not a single Senator referred to the Report. Cong.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Indeed, Sena\u00ad\ntor Trumbull, who introduced the Pay Act, acknowledged\nthat there was disagreement about the underlying consti\u00ad\ntutional question. Id., at 565 (\u201c[S]ome other persons think\nhe has that power\u201d). Further, if a majority of the Senate\nhad believed appointments to pre-recess vacancies were\nunconstitutional, it could have attempted to do far more\nthan temporarily dock the appointees\u2019 pay. Cf. Tenure of\nOffice Act of 1867, \u00a75, 14 Stat. 431 (making it a federal\ncrime for \u201cany person\u201d to \u201caccept any appointment\u201d in\ncertain circumstances).\n   In any event, the Senate subsequently abandoned its\nhostility. In the debate preceding the 1905 Senate Report\nregarding President Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cconstructive\u201d recess\nappointments, Senator Tillman\u2014who chaired the Com\u00ad\nmittee that authored the 1905 Report\u2014brought up the\n1863 Report, and another Senator responded: \u201cWhatever\nthat report may have said in 1863, I do not think that has\nbeen the view the Senate has taken\u201d of the issue. 38 Cong.\nRec. 1606 (1904). Senator Tillman then agreed that \u201cthe\nSenate has acquiesced\u201d in the President\u2019s \u201cpower to fill\u201d\npre-recess vacancies. Ibid. And Senator Tillman\u2019s 1905\nReport described the Clause\u2019s purpose in terms closely\nechoing Attorney General Wirt. 1905 Senate Report, at 2\n(\u201cIts sole purpose was to render it certain that at all times\nthere should be, whether the Senate was in session or not,\nan officer for every office\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   In 1916 the Senate debated whether to pay a recess\nappointee who had filled a pre-recess vacancy and had not\nsubsequently been confirmed. Both Senators to address\nthe question\u2014one on each side of the payment debate\u2014\nagreed that the President had the constitutional power to\nmake the appointment, and the Senate voted to pay the\nappointee for his service. 53 Cong. Rec. 4291\u20134299; 39\nStat. 818\u2013819. In 1927 the Comptroller General, a legisla\u00ad\ntive officer, wrote that \u201cthere is no question but that the\n32                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nPresident has authority to make a recess appointment to\nfill any vacancy,\u201d including those that \u201cexisted while the\nSenate was in session.\u201d 7 Comp. Gen. 10, 11 (emphasis\nadded). Meanwhile, Presidents continued to make ap\u00ad\npointments to pre-recess vacancies. The Solicitor General\nhas identified 40 between 1863 and 1940, but that number\nis clearly not comprehensive. See, e.g., 32 Op. Atty. Gen.\n271\u2013272 (1920) (listing 5 appointments that are not in the\nSolicitor General\u2019s appendix); Recess Appointments,\nWashington Post, July 7, 1880, p. 1 (noting that President\nHayes had made \u201cquite a number of appointments\u201d to pre\u00ad\nrecess vacancies).\n   Then in 1940 Congress amended the Pay Act to author\u00ad\nize salary payments (with some exceptions) where (1) the\n\u201cvacancy arose within thirty days prior to the termination\nof the session,\u201d (2) \u201cat the termination of the session\u201d a\nnomination was \u201cpending,\u201d or (3) a nominee was \u201crejected\nby the Senate within thirty days prior to the termination\nof the session.\u201d Act of July 11, 54 Stat. 751 (codified, as\namended, at 5 U. S. C. \u00a75503). All three circumstances\nconcern a vacancy that did not initially occur during a\nrecess but happened to exist during that recess. By pay\u00ad\ning salaries to this kind of recess appointee, the 1940\nSenate (and later Senates) in effect supported the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s interpretation of the Clause.\n   The upshot is that the President has consistently and\nfrequently interpreted the Recess Appointments Clause to\napply to vacancies that initially occur before, but continue\nto exist during, a recess of the Senate. The Senate as a\nbody has not countered this practice for nearly three\u00ad\nquarters of a century, perhaps longer. See A. Amar, The\nUnwritten Constitution 576\u2013577, n. 16 (2012) (for nearly\n200 years \u201cthe overwhelming mass of actual practice\u201d\nsupports the President\u2019s interpretation); Mistretta v.\nUnited States, 488 U.

The tradition is long enough to entitle the\npractice \u201cto great regard in determining the true construc-\ntion\u201d of the constitutional provision. The Pocket Veto Case,\n279 U. S., at 690. And we are reluctant to upset this\ntraditional practice where doing so would seriously shrink\nthe authority that Presidents have believed existed and\nhave exercised for so long.\n   In light of some linguistic ambiguity, the basic purpose\nof the Clause, and the historical practice we have de-\nscribed, we conclude that the phrase \u201call vacancies\u201d in-\ncludes vacancies that come into existence while the Senate\nis in session.\n                              V\n  The third question concerns the calculation of the length\nof the Senate\u2019s \u201crecess.\u201d On December 17, 2011, the Sen-\nate by unanimous consent adopted a resolution to convene\n\u201cpro forma session[s]\u201d only, with \u201cno business . . . trans-\nacted,\u201d on every Tuesday and Friday from December 20,\n2011, through January 20, 2012. 2011 S. J. 923. At the\nend of each pro forma session, the Senate would \u201cadjourn\nuntil\u201d the following pro forma session. Ibid. During that\nperiod, the Senate convened and adjourned as agreed. It\nheld pro forma sessions on December 20, 23, 27, and 30,\nand on January 3, 6, 10, 13, 17, and 20; and at the end of\neach pro forma session, it adjourned until the time and\ndate of the next. Id., at 923\u2013924; 158 Cong. Rec. S1\u2013S11.\n  The President made the recess appointments before us\non January 4, 2012, in between the January 3 and the\nJanuary 6 pro forma sessions. We must determine the\nsignificance of these sessions\u2014that is, whether, for pur-\nposes of the Clause, we should treat them as periods when\nthe Senate was in session or as periods when it was in\nrecess. If the former, the period between January 3 and\nJanuary 6 was a 3-day recess, which is too short to trigger\n34                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nthe President\u2019s recess-appointment power, see supra, at\n19\u201321. If the latter, however, then the 3-day period was\npart of a much longer recess during which the President\ndid have the power to make recess appointments, see ibid.\n   The Solicitor General argues that we must treat the\npro forma sessions as periods of recess. He says that these\n\u201csessions\u201d were sessions in name only because the Senate\nwas in recess as a functional matter. The Senate, he\ncontends, remained in a single, unbroken recess from\nJanuary 3, when the second session of the 112th Congress\nbegan by operation of the Twentieth Amendment, until\nJanuary 23, when the Senate reconvened to do regular\nbusiness.\n   In our view, however, the pro forma sessions count as\nsessions, not as periods of recess. We hold that, for pur\u00ad\nposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in\nsession when it says it is, provided that, under its own\nrules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.\nThe Senate met that standard here.\n   The standard we apply is consistent with the Constitu\u00ad\ntion\u2019s broad delegation of authority to the Senate to de\u00ad\ntermine how and when to conduct its business. The Con\u00ad\nstitution explicitly empowers the Senate to \u201cdetermine the\nRules of its Proceedings.\u201d Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 2. And we have\nheld that \u201call matters of method are open to the determi\u00ad\nnation\u201d of the Senate, as long as there is \u201ca reasonable\nrelation between the mode or method of proceeding estab\u00ad\nlished by the rule and the result which is sought to be\nattained\u201d and the rule does not \u201cignore constitutional\nrestraints or violate fundamental rights.\u201d United States v.\nBallin, 144 U. S. 1, 5 (1892).\n   In addition, the Constitution provides the Senate with\nextensive control over its schedule. There are only limited\nexceptions. See Amdt. 20, \u00a72 (Congress must meet once a\nyear on January 3, unless it specifies another day by law);\nArt. II, \u00a73 (Senate must meet if the President calls it into\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           35\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nspecial session); Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 4 (neither House may ad\u00ad\njourn for more than three days without consent of the\nother). See also Art. II, \u00a73 (\u201c[I]n Case of Disagreement\nbetween [the Houses], with Respect to the Time of Ad\u00ad\njournment, [the President] may adjourn them to such\nTime as he shall think proper\u201d). The Constitution thus\ngives the Senate wide latitude to determine whether and\nwhen to have a session, as well as how to conduct the\nsession. This suggests that the Senate\u2019s determination\nabout what constitutes a session should merit great\nrespect.\n   Furthermore, this Court\u2019s precedents reflect the breadth\nof the power constitutionally delegated to the Senate. We\ngenerally take at face value the Senate\u2019s own report of its\nactions. When, for example, \u201cthe presiding officers\u201d of the\nHouse and Senate sign an enrolled bill (and the President\n\u201capprove[s]\u201d it), \u201cits authentication as a bill that has\npassed Congress should be deemed complete and unim\u00ad\npeachable.\u201d Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649,\n672 (1892). By the same principle, when the Journal of\nthe Senate indicates that a quorum was present, under a\nvalid Senate rule, at the time the Senate passed a bill, we\nwill not consider an argument that a quorum was not, in\nfact, present. Ballin, supra, at 9. The Constitution re\u00ad\nquires the Senate to keep its Journal, Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 3\n(\u201cEach House shall keep a Journal of its proceedings . . .\u201d),\nand \u201cif reference may be had to\u201d it, \u201cit must be assumed to\nspeak the truth,\u201d Ballin, supra, at 4.\n   For these reasons, we conclude that we must give great\nweight to the Senate\u2019s own determination of when it is and\nwhen it is not in session. But our deference to the Senate\ncannot be absolute. When the Senate is without the ca-\npacity to act, under its own rules, it is not in session even\nif it so declares. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 69 (acknowledgment\nby counsel for amici Senators that if the Senate had left\nthe Capitol and \u201ceffectively given up . . . the business of\n36                    NLRB v.

In that circumstance, the Senate is not simply un\u00ad\nlikely or unwilling to act upon nominations of the Presi\u00ad\ndent. It is unable to do so. The purpose of the Clause is to\nensure the continued functioning of the Federal Govern\u00ad\nment while the Senate is unavailable. See supra, at 5\u20136.\nThis purpose would count for little were we to treat the\nSenate as though it were in session even when it lacks the\nability to provide its \u201cadvice and consent.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2.\nAccordingly, we conclude that when the Senate declares\nthat it is in session and possesses the capacity, under its\nown rules, to conduct business, it is in session for purposes\nof the Clause.\n   Applying this standard, we find that the pro forma\nsessions were sessions for purposes of the Clause. First,\nthe Senate said it was in session. The Journal of the\nSenate and the Congressional Record indicate that the\nSenate convened for a series of twice-weekly \u201csessions\u201d\nfrom December 20 through January 20. 2011 S. J. 923\u2013\n924; 158 Cong. Rec. S1\u2013S11. (The Journal of the Senate\nfor 2012 has not yet been published.) And these reports of\nthe Senate \u201cmust be assumed to speak the truth.\u201d Ballin,\nsupra, at 4.\n   Second, the Senate\u2019s rules make clear that during its\npro forma sessions, despite its resolution that it would\nconduct no business, the Senate retained the power to\nconduct business. During any pro forma session, the\nSenate could have conducted business simply by passing a\nunanimous consent agreement. See Riddick\u2019s 1313. The\nSenate in fact conducts much of its business through\nunanimous consent. Id., at 1311\u20131312. Senate rules\npresume that a quorum is present unless a present Sena\u00ad\ntor questions it. Id., at 1041\u20131042. And when the Senate\nhas a quorum, an agreement is unanimously passed if,\nupon its proposal, no present Senator objects. Id., at\n1329\u20131330. It is consequently unsurprising that the\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           37\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nSenate has enacted legislation during pro forma sessions\neven when it has said that no business will be transacted.\nIndeed, the Senate passed a bill by unanimous consent\nduring the second pro forma session after its December 17\nadjournment. 2011 S. J. 924. And that bill quickly be\u00ad\ncame law. Pub. L. 112\u201378, 125 Stat. 1280.\n  By way of contrast, we do not see how the Senate could\nconduct business during a recess. It could terminate the\nrecess and then, when in session, pass a bill. But in that\ncase, of course, the Senate would no longer be in recess. It\nwould be in session. And that is the crucial point. Senate\nrules make clear that, once in session, the Senate can act\neven if it has earlier said that it would not.\n  The Solicitor General argues that more is required. He\ncontends that what counts is not the Senate\u2019s capacity to\nconduct business but what the Senate actually does (or\nhere, did) during its pro forma sessions. And he looks for\nsupport to the functional definition of \u201crecess\u201d set forth in\nthe 1905 Senate Report discussed above. See supra, at 14.\nThat Report describes a \u201crecess\u201d of the Senate as\n    \u201cthe period of time . . . when its members owe no duty\n    of attendance; when its Chamber is empty; when, be\u00ad\n    cause of its absence, it can not receive communica\u00ad\n    tions from the President or participate as a body in\n    making appointments.\u201d 1905 Senate Report, at 2.\n  Even were we, for argument\u2019s sake, to accept all of these\ncriteria as authoritative, they would here be met. Taking\nthe last criterion first, could the Senate, during its pro\nforma sessions, \u201cparticipate as a body in making appoint\u00ad\nments\u201d? It could. It could confirm nominees by unani\u00ad\nmous consent, just as it passed the bill mentioned above.\nSee Riddick\u2019s 1313.\n  Could the Senate \u201creceive communications from the\nPresident\u201d? It could. The Congressional Record indicates\nthat the Senate \u201creceived\u201d a message from the President\n38                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\non January 12, during a 3-day adjournment between two\npro forma sessions. See 158 Cong. Rec. S37 (Jan. 23,\n2012). If the Senate could receive Presidential messages\nbetween two pro forma sessions, it could receive them\nduring a pro forma session.\n   Was the Senate\u2019s Chamber \u201cempty\u201d? It was not. By its\nofficial rules, the Senate operates under the presumption\nthat a quorum is present until a present Senator suggests\nthe absence of a quorum, Riddick\u2019s 1041\u20131042, and noth\u00ad\ning in the Journal of the Senate or the Congressional\nRecord reflects any such suggestion.\n   Did Senators \u201cowe [a] duty of attendance\u201d? They did.\nThe Senate\u2019s rules dictate that Senators are under a duty\nto attend every session. See Riddick\u2019s 214; Standing Rule\nof the Senate VI(2), S. Doc. No. 112\u20131, p. 5 (2011) (\u201cNo\nSenator shall absent himself from the service of the Sen\u00ad\nate without leave\u201d). Nothing excused the Senators from\nthis duty during the Senate\u2019s pro forma sessions. If any\npresent Senator had raised a question as to the presence\nof a quorum, and by roll call it had become clear that a\nquorum was missing, the Senators in attendance could\nhave directed the Sergeant at Arms to bring in the missing\nSenators. Rule VI(4).\n   The Solicitor General asks us to engage in a more realis\u00ad\ntic appraisal of what the Senate actually did. He argues\nthat, during the relevant pro forma sessions, business was\nnot in fact conducted; messages from the President could\nnot be received in any meaningful way because they could\nnot be placed before the Senate; the Senate Chamber was,\naccording to C-SPAN coverage, almost empty; and in\npractice attendance was not required. See Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 48\u201349, 54\u201355.\n   We do not believe, however, that engaging in the kind of\nfactual appraisal that the Solicitor General suggests is\neither legally or practically appropriate. From a legal\nperspective, this approach would run contrary to prece\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            39\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndent instructing us to \u201crespect . . . coequal and independ-\nent departments\u201d by, for example, taking the Senate\u2019s\nreport of its official action at its word. Field, 143 U. S., at\n672; see Ballin, 144 U. S., at 4. From a practical perspec-\ntive, judges cannot easily determine such matters as who\nis, and who is not, in fact present on the floor during a\nparticular Senate session. Judicial efforts to engage in\nthese kinds of inquiries would risk undue judicial interfer-\nence with the functioning of the Legislative Branch.\n   Finally, the Solicitor General warns that our holding\nmay \u201c \u2018disrup[t] the proper balance between the coordinate\nbranches by preventing the Executive Branch from ac-\ncomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 64 (quoting Morrison v. Olson, 487\nU. S. 654, 695 (1988); alteration in original). We do not\nsee, however, how our holding could significantly alter the\nconstitutional balance. Most appointments are not contro-\nversial and do not produce friction between the branches.\nWhere political controversy is serious, the Senate unques-\ntionably has other methods of preventing recess appoint-\nments. As the Solicitor General concedes, the Senate\ncould preclude the President from making recess appoint-\nments by holding a series of twice-a-week ordinary (not\npro forma) sessions. And the nature of the business con-\nducted at those ordinary sessions\u2014whether, for example,\nSenators must vote on nominations, or may return to\ntheir home States to meet with their constituents\u2014is a\nmatter for the Senate to decide. The Constitution also\ngives the President (if he has enough allies in Congress) a\nway to force a recess. Art. II, \u00a73 (\u201c[I]n Case of Disagree-\nment between [the Houses], with Respect to the Time of\nAdjournment, [the President] may adjourn them to such\nTime as he shall think proper\u201d). Moreover, the President\nand Senators engage with each other in many different\nways and have a variety of methods of encouraging each\nother to accept their points of view.\n40                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\n  Regardless, the Recess Appointments Clause is not\ndesigned to overcome serious institutional friction. It\nsimply provides a subsidiary method for appointing offi\u00ad\ncials when the Senate is away during a recess. Here, as in\nother contexts, friction between the branches is an inevi\u00ad\ntable consequence of our constitutional structure. See\nMyers, 272 U. S., at 293 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). That\nstructure foresees resolution not only through judicial\ninterpretation and compromise among the branches but\nalso by the ballot box.\n                             VI\n   The Recess Appointments Clause responds to a struc\u00ad\ntural difference between the Executive and Legislative\nBranches: The Executive Branch is perpetually in opera\u00ad\ntion, while the Legislature only acts in intervals separated\nby recesses. The purpose of the Clause is to allow the\nExecutive to continue operating while the Senate is una\u00ad\nvailable. We believe that the Clause\u2019s text, standing\nalone, is ambiguous. It does not resolve whether the\nPresident may make appointments during intra-session\nrecesses, or whether he may fill pre-recess vacancies. But\nthe broader reading better serves the Clause\u2019s structural\nfunction. Moreover, that broader reading is reinforced by\ncenturies of history, which we are hesitant to disturb. We\nthus hold that the Constitution empowers the President to\nfill any existing vacancy during any recess\u2014intra-session\nor inter-session\u2014of sufficient length.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA would render illegitimate thousands of\nrecess appointments reaching all the way back to the\nfounding era. More than that: Calling the Clause an\n\u201canachronism,\u201d he would basically read it out of the Con\u00ad\nstitution. Post, at 12. He performs this act of judicial\nexcision in the name of liberty. We fail to see how excising\nthe Recess Appointments Clause preserves freedom. In\nfact, Alexander Hamilton observed in the very first Feder\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

And\nthe Framers included the Recess Appointments Clause to\npreserve the \u201cvigour of government\u201d at times when an\nimportant organ of Government, the United States Senate,\nis in recess. JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s interpretation of the Clause\nwould defeat the power of the Clause to achieve that\nobjective.\n   The foregoing discussion should refute JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\nclaim that we have \u201cembrace[d]\u201d an \u201cadverse-possession\ntheory of executive power.\u201d Post, at 48. Instead, as in\nall cases, we interpret the Constitution in light of its\ntext, purposes, and \u201cour whole experience\u201d as a Nation.\nMissouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 433 (1920). And we\nlook to the actual practice of Government to inform our\ninterpretation.\n   Given our answer to the last question before us, we\nconclude that the Recess Appointments Clause does not\ngive the President the constitutional authority to make\nthe appointments here at issue. Because the Court of\nAppeals reached the same ultimate conclusion (though for\nreasons we reject), its judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n42                                  NLRB v.

On occasion, both chambers have\nheld one or more pro forma sessions because of this constitutional obligation or for other purposes. Treated\nhere as recesses, usually no business is conducted during these time periods.

S. Const., Art. II,\n\u00a72, cl. 2. That general rule is subject to an exception: \u201cThe\nPresident shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that\nmay happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting\nCommissions which shall expire at the End of their next\nSession.\u201d Id., \u00a72, cl. 3. This case requires us to decide\nwhether the Recess Appointments Clause authorized three\nappointments made by President Obama to the National\nLabor Relations Board in January 2012 without the Sen\u00ad\nate\u2019s consent.\n  To prevent the President\u2019s recess-appointment power\nfrom nullifying the Senate\u2019s role in the appointment pro\u00ad\ncess, the Constitution cabins that power in two significant\nways. First, it may be exercised only in \u201cthe Recess of the\nSenate,\u201d that is, the intermission between two formal\nlegislative sessions. Second, it may be used to fill only\nthose vacancies that \u201chappen during the Recess,\u201d that is,\noffices that become vacant during that intermission. Both\nconditions are clear from the Constitution\u2019s text and struc\u00ad\n2                 NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nture, and both were well understood at the founding. The\nCourt of Appeals correctly held that the appointments\nhere at issue are invalid because they did not meet either\ncondition.\n   Today\u2019s Court agrees that the appointments were in\u00ad\nvalid, but for the far narrower reason that they were made\nduring a 3-day break in the Senate\u2019s session. On its way\nto that result, the majority sweeps away the key textual\nlimitations on the recess-appointment power. It holds,\nfirst, that the President can make appointments without\nthe Senate\u2019s participation even during short breaks in the\nmiddle of the Senate\u2019s session, and second, that those\nappointments can fill offices that became vacant long\nbefore the break in which they were filled. The majority\njustifies those atextual results on an adverse-possession\ntheory of executive authority: Presidents have long\nclaimed the powers in question, and the Senate has not\ndisputed those claims with sufficient vigor, so the Court\nshould not \u201cupset the compromises and working arrange\u00ad\nments that the elected branches of Government them\u00ad\nselves have reached.\u201d Ante, at 9.\n   The Court\u2019s decision transforms the recess-appointment\npower from a tool carefully designed to fill a narrow and\nspecific need into a weapon to be wielded by future Presi\u00ad\ndents against future Senates. To reach that result, the\nmajority casts aside the plain, original meaning of the\nconstitutional text in deference to late-arising historical\npractices that are ambiguous at best. The majority\u2019s\ninsistence on deferring to the Executive\u2019s untenably broad\ninterpretation of the power is in clear conflict with our\nprecedent and forebodes a diminution of this Court\u2019s role\nin controversies involving the separation of powers and\nthe structure of government. I concur in the judgment\nonly.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                    I. Our Responsibility\n   Today\u2019s majority disregards two overarching principles\nthat ought to guide our consideration of the questions\npresented here.\n   First, the Constitution\u2019s core, government-structuring\nprovisions are no less critical to preserving liberty than\nare the later adopted provisions of the Bill of Rights.\nIndeed, \u201c[s]o convinced were the Framers that liberty of\nthe person inheres in structure that at first they did not\nconsider a Bill of Rights necessary.\u201d Clinton v. City of\nNew York, 524 U. S. 417, 450 (1998) (KENNEDY, J., concur\u00ad\nring). Those structural provisions reflect the founding\ngeneration\u2019s deep conviction that \u201cchecks and balances\nwere the foundation of a structure of government that\nwould protect liberty.\u201d Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714,\n722 (1986). It is for that reason that \u201cthe claims of indi\u00ad\nviduals\u2014not of Government departments\u2014have been the\nprincipal source of judicial decisions concerning separation\nof powers and checks and balances.\u201d Bond v. United\nStates, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10); see, e.g.,\nFree Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting\nOversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477 (2010); Clinton, supra; Plaut\nv. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211 (1995); Bowsher,\nsupra; INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983); Northern\nPipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S.\n50 (1982). Those decisions all rest on the bedrock princi\u00ad\nple that \u201cthe constitutional structure of our Government\u201d\nis designed first and foremost not to look after the inter\u00ad\nests of the respective branches, but to \u201cprotec[t] individual\nliberty.\u201d Bond, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11).\n   Second and relatedly, when questions involving the\nConstitution\u2019s government-structuring provisions are\npresented in a justiciable case, it is the solemn responsibil\u00ad\nity of the Judicial Branch \u201c \u2018to say what the law is.\u2019 \u201d Zivo\u00ad\ntofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7)\n(quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)).\n4                 NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nThis Court does not defer to the other branches\u2019 resolution\nof such controversies; as JUSTICE KENNEDY has previously\nwritten, our role is in no way \u201clessened\u201d because it might\nbe said that \u201cthe two political branches are adjusting their\nown powers between themselves.\u201d Clinton, supra, at 449\n(concurring opinion). Since the separation of powers exists\nfor the protection of individual liberty, its vitality \u201cdoes\nnot depend\u201d on \u201cwhether \u2018the encroached-upon branch\napproves the encroachment.\u2019 \u201d        Free Enterprise Fund,\nsupra, at 497 (quoting New York v. United States, 505\nU. S. 144, 182 (1992)); see also Freytag v. Commissioner,\n501 U. S. 868, 879\u2013880 (1991); Metropolitan Washington\nAirports Authority v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft\nNoise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 276\u2013277 (1991). Rather, polic\u00ad\ning the \u201cenduring structure\u201d of constitutional government\nwhen the political branches fail to do so is \u201cone of the most\nvital functions of this Court.\u201d Public Citizen v. Depart\u00ad\nment of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 468 (1989) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Our decision in Chadha illustrates that principle.\nThere, we held that a statutory provision authorizing one\nHouse of Congress to cancel an executive action taken\npursuant to statutory authority\u2014a so-called \u201clegislative\nveto\u201d\u2014exceeded the bounds of Congress\u2019s authority under\nthe Constitution. 462 U. S., at 957\u2013959. We did not hesi\u00ad\ntate to hold the legislative veto unconstitutional even\nthough Congress had enacted, and the President had\nsigned, nearly 300 similar provisions over the course of 50\nyears. Id., at 944\u2013945. Just the opposite: We said the\nother branches\u2019 enthusiasm for the legislative veto \u201csharp\u00ad\nened rather than blunted\u201d our review. Id., at 944. Like\u00ad\nwise, when the charge is made that a practice \u201cenhances\nthe President\u2019s powers beyond\u201d what the Constitution\npermits, \u201c[i]t is no answer . . . to say that Congress sur\u00ad\nrendered its authority by its own hand.\u201d Clinton, 524\nU. S., at 451 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). \u201c[O]ne Congress\n                   Cite as: 573 U.

Abdication of responsibility is not\npart of the constitutional design.\u201d Id., at 452 (citations\nomitted).\n   Of course, where a governmental practice has been\nopen, widespread, and unchallenged since the early days\nof the Republic, the practice should guide our interpreta\u00ad\ntion of an ambiguous constitutional provision.

That is a necessary corollary of the\nprinciple that the political branches cannot by agreement\nalter the constitutional structure. Plainly, then, a self\u00ad\naggrandizing practice adopted by one branch well after the\nfounding, often challenged, and never before blessed by\nthis Court\u2014in other words, the sort of practice on which\nthe majority relies in this case\u2014does not relieve us of our\nduty to interpret the Constitution in light of its text, struc\u00ad\nture, and original understanding.\n   Ignoring our more recent precedent in this area, which\nis extensive, the majority relies on The Pocket Veto Case,\n279 U. S. 655, 689 (1929), for the proposition that when\ninterpreting a constitutional provision \u201cregulating the\nrelationship between Congress and the President,\u201d we\nmust defer to the settled practice of the political branches\nif the provision is \u201c \u2018 \u201cin any respect of doubtful meaning.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n6                     NLRB v.

The\nPocket Veto Court had to decide whether a bill passed by\nthe House and Senate and presented to the President less\nthan 10 days before the adjournment of the first session of\na particular Congress, but neither signed nor vetoed by\nthe President, became a law. Most of the opinion analyzed\nthat issue like any other legal question and concluded that\ntreating the bill as a law would have been inconsistent\nwith the text and structure of the Constitution. Only near\nthe end of the opinion did the Court add that its conclu\u00ad\nsion was \u201cconfirmed\u201d by longstanding Presidential practice\nin which Congress appeared to have acquiesced. 279\nU.

Nearly all involved venerable and\nunchallenged practices, and constitutional provisions that were either\ndeeply ambiguous or plainly supportive of the practice. See Dames &\nMoore v. Regan, 453 U.

Intra-Session Breaks\n   The first question presented is whether \u201cthe Recess of\nthe Senate,\u201d during which the President\u2019s recess\u00ad\nappointment power is active, is (a) the period between two\nof the Senate\u2019s formal sessions, or (b) any break in the\nSenate\u2019s proceedings. I would hold that \u201cthe Recess\u201d is the\ngap between sessions and that the appointments at issue\nhere are invalid because they undisputedly were made\nduring the Senate\u2019s session. The Court\u2019s contrary conclu\u00ad\nsion\u2014that \u201cthe Recess\u201d includes \u201cbreaks in the midst of a\nsession,\u201d ante, at 9\u2014is inconsistent with the Constitution\u2019s\ntext and structure, and it requires judicial fabrication of\nvague, unadministrable limits on the recess-appointment\npower (thus defined) that overstep the judicial role. And\nalthough the majority relies heavily on \u201chistorical prac\u00ad\ntice,\u201d no practice worthy of our deference supports the\nmajority\u2019s conclusion on this issue.\n                   A. Plain Meaning\n  A sensible interpretation of the Recess Appointments\nClause should start by recognizing that the Clause uses\nthe term \u201cRecess\u201d in contradistinction to the term \u201cSes\u00ad\nsion.\u201d As Alexander Hamilton wrote: \u201cThe time within\nwhich the power is to operate \u2018during the recess of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ngress elected under the present constitution,\u201d \u201crecognized by many\nsuccessive legislatures, and . . . acted upon by the judicial department,\u201d\nin support of the conclusion that the Necessary and Proper Clause\nallowed Congress to incorporate a bank); Stuart v.

Even Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.

The life of each elected Congress typically\nconsisted (as it still does) of two or more formal sessions\nseparated by adjournments \u201csine die,\u201d that is, without a\nspecified return date. See GPO, Congressional Directory,\n113th Cong., pp. 524\u2013542 (2013\u20132014) (hereinafter Con\u00ad\ngressional Directory) (listing sessions of Congress from\n1789 through 2013); 705 F. 3d 490, 512, and nn. 1\u20132\n(CADC 2013) (case below); ante, at 9. The period between\ntwo sessions was known as \u201cthe recess.\u201d See 26 Annals of\nCong. 748 (1814) (Sen. Gore) (\u201cThe time of the Senate\nconsists of two periods, viz: their session and their re\u00ad\ncess\u201d). As one scholar has thoroughly demonstrated, \u201cin\ngovernment practice the phrase \u2018the Recess\u2019 always re\u00ad\nferred to the gap between sessions.\u201d Natelson, The Ori\u00ad\ngins and Meaning of \u201cVacancies that May Happen During\nthe Recess\u201d in the Constitution\u2019s Recess Appointments\nClause, 37 Harv.

By contrast, other provisions of the Constitu\u00ad\ntion use the verb \u201cadjourn\u201d rather than \u201crecess\u201d to refer to\nthe commencement of breaks during a formal legislative\nsession. See, e.g., Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 1; id., \u00a75, cl. 4.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Themajority claims that \u201cthe phrase \u2018the recess\u2019 was used to refer to\nintra-session recesses at the time of the founding,\u201d ante, at 10, but it\noffers strikingly little support for that assertion. It first cites a letter\nfrom George Washington that is quite obviously an example of impre\u00ad\ncise, colloquial usage. See 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787,\np. 76 (M. Farrand rev. 1966) (\u201cI had put my carriage in the hands of a\nworkman to be repaired and had not the means of mooving [sic] during\nthe recess\u201d). It next cites an example from the New Jersey Legislature\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    9\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   To be sure, in colloquial usage both words, \u201crecess\u201d and\n\u201csession,\u201d could take on alternative, less precise meanings.\nA session could include any short period when a legisla\u00ad\nture\u2019s members were \u201cassembled for business,\u201d and a\nrecess could refer to any brief \u201csuspension\u201d of legislative\n\u201cbusiness.\u201d 2 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language (1828). So the Continental Congress\ncould complain of the noise from passing carriages dis\u00ad\nrupting its \u201cdaily Session,\u201d 29 Journals of the Continental\nCongress 1774\u20131789, p. 561 (1785) (J. Fitzpatrick ed.\n1933), and the House could \u201ctake a recess\u201d from 4 o\u2019clock\nto 6 o\u2019clock, Journal of the House of Representatives, 17th\nCong., 2d Sess., p. 259 (1823). But as even the majority\nacknowledges, the Constitution\u2019s use of \u201cthe word \u2018the\u2019 in\n\u2018the [R]ecess\u2019 \u201d tends to suggest \u201cthat the phrase refers to\nthe single break separating formal sessions.\u201d Ante, at 10.\n   More importantly, neither the Solicitor General nor the\nmajority argues that the Clause uses \u201csession\u201d in its loose,\ncolloquial sense. And if \u201cthe next Session\u201d denotes a for\u00ad\nmal session, then \u201cthe Recess\u201d must mean the break be\u00ad\ntween formal sessions. As every commentator on the\nClause until the 20th century seems to have understood,\nthe \u201cRecess\u201d and the \u201cSession\u201d to which the Clause refers\nare mutually exclusive, alternating states. See, e.g., The\nFederalist No. 67, at 455 (explaining that appointments\nwould require Senatorial consent \u201cduring the session of\nthe Senate\u201d and would be made by the President alone \u201cin\ntheir recess\u201d); 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 631 (1823) (contrasting\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat simply reflects that body\u2019s practice of dividing its time not only\ninto \u201csessions\u201d but also into distinct, formal \u201csittings\u201d within each\nsession, with \u201cthe recess\u201d denoting the period between sittings. See\nBrief for Respondent Noel Canning 23; see also Natelson 207. Finally,\nthe majority cites three pages from the Solicitor General\u2019s brief without\nacknowledging the arguments offered in response to the Solicitor\nGeneral\u2019s few supposed counterexamples. See, e.g., Brief for Respond\u00ad\nent Noel Canning 21\u201324; Natelson 222, n. 120.\n10                NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvacancies occurring \u201cduring the recess of the Senate\u201d with\nthose occurring \u201cduring the session of the Senate\u201d); 2 Op.\nAtty Gen. 525, 527 (1832) (discussing a vacancy that \u201ctook\nplace while the Senate was in session, and not during the\nrecess\u201d). It is linguistically implausible to suppose\u2014as the\nmajority does\u2014that the Clause uses one of those terms\n(\u201cRecess\u201d) informally and the other (\u201cSession\u201d) formally in\na single sentence, with the result that an event can occur\nduring both the \u201cRecess\u201d and the \u201cSession.\u201d\n   Besides being linguistically unsound, the majority\u2019s\nreading yields the strange result that an appointment\nmade during a short break near the beginning of one\nofficial session will not terminate until the end of the\nfollowing official session, enabling the appointment to last\nfor up to two years. The majority justifies that result by\nobserving that the process of confirming a nominee \u201cmay\ntake several months.\u201d Ante, at 17. But the average dura\u00ad\ntion of the confirmation process is irrelevant. The Clause\u2019s\nself-evident design is to have the President\u2019s unilateral\nappointment last only until the Senate has \u201chad an oppor\u00ad\ntunity to act on the subject.\u201d 3 J. Story, Commentaries on\nthe Constitution of the United States \u00a71551, p. 410 (1833)\n(emphasis added).\n   One way to avoid the linguistic incongruity of the major\u00ad\nity\u2019s reading would be to read both \u201cthe Recess\u201d and \u201cthe\nnext Session\u201d colloquially, so that the recess-appointment\npower would be activated during any temporary suspen\u00ad\nsion of Senate proceedings, but appointments made pur\u00ad\nsuant to that power would last only until the beginning of\nthe next suspension (which would end the next colloquial\nsession). See, e.g., Rappaport, The Original Meaning of\nthe Recess Appointments Clause, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1487,\n1569 (2005) (hereinafter Rappaport, Original Meaning).\nThat approach would be more linguistically defensible\nthan the majority\u2019s. But it would not cure the most fun\u00ad\ndamental problem with giving \u201cRecess\u201d its colloquial,\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nrather than its formal, meaning: Doing so leaves the re\u00ad\ncess-appointment power without a textually grounded\nprinciple limiting the time of its exercise.\n   The dictionary definitions of \u201crecess\u201d on which the ma\u00ad\njority relies provide no such principle. On the contrary,\nthey make clear that in colloquial usage, a recess could\ninclude any suspension of legislative business, no\nmatter how short. See 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 1602 (4th ed. 1773). Webster even\nprovides a stark illustration: \u201c[T]he house of representa\u00ad\ntives had a recess of half an hour.\u201d 2 Webster, supra. The\nnotion that the Constitution empowers the President to\nmake unilateral appointments every time the Senate\ntakes a half-hour lunch break is so absurd as to be self\u00ad\nrefuting. But that, in the majority\u2019s view, is what the text\nauthorizes.\n   The boundlessness of the colloquial reading of \u201cthe\nRecess\u201d thus refutes the majority\u2019s assertion that the\nClause\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d of \u201censur[ing] the continued function\u00ad\ning of the Federal Government\u201d demands that it apply to\nintra-session breaks as well as inter-session recesses.\nAnte, at 11. The majority disregards another self-evident\npurpose of the Clause: to preserve the Senate\u2019s role in the\nappointment process\u2014which the founding generation\nregarded as a critical protection against \u201c \u2018despotism,\u2019 \u201d\nFreytag, 501 U. S., at 883\u2014by clearly delineating the\ntimes when the President can appoint officers without the\nSenate\u2019s consent. Today\u2019s decision seriously undercuts\nthat purpose. In doing so, it demonstrates the folly of\ninterpreting constitutional provisions designed to estab\u00ad\nlish \u201ca structure of government that would protect liberty,\u201d\nBowsher, 478 U. S., at 722, on the narrow-minded as\u00ad\nsumption that their only purpose is to make the govern\u00ad\nment run as efficiently as possible. \u201cConvenience and\nefficiency,\u201d we have repeatedly recognized, \u201care not the\nprimary objectives\u201d of our constitutional framework. Free\n12                 NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nEnterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at 499 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n  Relatedly, the majority contends that the Clause\u2019s sup\u00ad\nposed purpose of keeping the wheels of government turn\u00ad\ning demands that we interpret the Clause to maintain its\nrelevance in light of the \u201cnew circumstance\u201d of the Sen\u00ad\nate\u2019s taking an increasing number of intra-session breaks\nthat exceed three days. Ante, at 17. Even if I accepted the\ncanard that courts can alter the Constitution\u2019s meaning to\naccommodate changed circumstances, I would be hard\npressed to see the relevance of that notion here. The rise\nof intra-session adjournments has occurred in tandem\nwith the development of modern forms of communication\nand transportation that mean the Senate \u201cis always avail\u00ad\nable\u201d to consider nominations, even when its Members are\ntemporarily dispersed for an intra-session break. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 21 (GINSBURG, J.). The Recess Appointments\nClause therefore is, or rather, should be, an anachro\u00ad\nnism\u2014\u201cessentially an historic relic, something whose\noriginal purpose has disappeared.\u201d Id., at 19 (KAGAN, J.).\nThe need it was designed to fill no longer exists, and its\nonly remaining use is the ignoble one of enabling the\nPresident to circumvent the Senate\u2019s role in the appoint\u00ad\nment process. That does not justify \u201cread[ing] it out of the\nConstitution\u201d and, contra the majority, ante, at 40, I would\nnot do so; but neither would I distort the Clause\u2019s original\nmeaning, as the majority does, to ensure a prominent role\nfor the recess-appointment power in an era when its influ\u00ad\nence is far more pernicious than beneficial.\n  To avoid the absurd results that follow from its collo\u00ad\nquial reading of \u201cthe Recess,\u201d the majority is forced to declare\nthat some intra-session breaks\u2014though undisputedly\nwithin the phrase\u2019s colloquial meaning\u2014are simply \u201ctoo\nshort to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause.\u201d Ante,\nat 21.

It is\ninconceivable that the Framers would have left the cir\u00ad\ncumstances in which the President could exercise such a\nsignificant and potentially dangerous power so utterly\nindeterminate. Other structural provisions of the Consti\u00ad\ntution that turn on duration are quite specific: Neither\nHouse can adjourn \u201cfor more than three days\u201d without the\nother\u2019s consent. Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 4. The President must\nreturn a passed bill to Congress \u201cwithin ten Days (Sun\u00ad\ndays excepted),\u201d lest it become a law. Id., \u00a77, cl. 2. Yet on\nthe majority\u2019s view, when the first Senate considered\ntaking a 1-month break, a 3-day weekend, or a half-hour\nsiesta, it had no way of knowing whether the President\nwould be constitutionally authorized to appoint officers in\nits absence. And any officers appointed in those circum\u00ad\nstances would have served under a cloud, unable to de\u00ad\ntermine with any degree of confidence whether their ap\u00ad\npointments were valid.3\n   Fumbling for some textually grounded standard, the\nmajority seizes on the Adjournments Clause, which bars\neither House from adjourning for more than three days\nwithout the other\u2019s consent. Id., \u00a75, cl. 4. According to the\nmajority, that clause establishes that a 3-day break is\nalways \u201ctoo short\u201d to trigger the Recess Appointments\nClause. Ante, at 19. It goes without saying that nothing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The majority insists that \u201cthe most likely reason the Framers did\n\nnot place a textual floor underneath the word \u2018recess\u2019 is that they did\nnot foresee the need for one\u201d because they did not anticipate that intra\u00ad\nsession breaks \u201cwould become lengthier and more significant than\ninter-session ones.\u201d Ante, at 19. The majority\u2019s logic escapes me. The\nFramers\u2019 supposed failure to anticipate \u201clength[y]\u201d intra-session breaks\nmight explain why (as I maintain) they did not bother to authorize\nrecess appointments during intra-session breaks at all; but it cannot\nexplain why (as the majority holds) they would have enacted a text that\nauthorizes appointments during all intra-session breaks\u2014even the\nshort ones the majority says they did anticipate\u2014without placing a\ntemporal limitation on that power.\n14                NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nin the constitutional text supports that disposition. If (as\nthe majority concludes) \u201cthe Recess\u201d means a recess in the\ncolloquial sense, then it necessarily includes breaks shorter\nthan three days. And the fact that the Constitution in\u00ad\ncludes a 3-day limit in one clause but omits it from the\nother weighs strongly against finding such a limit to be\nimplicit in the clause in which it does not appear. In all\nevents, the dramatically different contexts in which the\ntwo clauses operate make importing the 3-day limit from\nthe Adjournments Clause into the Recess Appointments\nClause \u201cboth arbitrary and mistaken.\u201d Rappaport, Origi\u00ad\nnal Meaning 1556.\n   And what about breaks longer than three days? The\nmajority says that a break of four to nine days is \u201cpre\u00ad\nsumptively too short\u201d but that the presumption may be\nrebutted in an \u201cunusual circumstance,\u201d such as a \u201cnational\ncatastrophe . . . that renders the Senate unavailable but\ncalls for an urgent response.\u201d Ante, at 21. The majority\nmust hope that the in terrorem effect of its \u201cpresumptively\ntoo short\u201d pronouncement will deter future Presidents\nfrom making any recess appointments during 4-to-9-day\nbreaks and thus save us from the absurd spectacle of\nunelected judges evaluating (after an evidentiary hear\u00ad\ning?) whether an alleged \u201ccatastrophe\u201d was sufficiently\n\u201curgent\u201d to trigger the recess-appointment power. The\nmajority also says that \u201cpolitical opposition in the Senate\nwould not qualify as an unusual circumstance.\u201d Ibid. So\nif the Senate should refuse to confirm a nominee whom the\nPresident considers highly qualified; or even if it should\nrefuse to confirm any nominee for an office, thinking the\noffice better left vacant for the time being; the President\u2019s\npower would not be triggered during a 4-to-9-day break, no\nmatter how \u201curgent\u201d the President\u2019s perceived need for the\nofficer\u2019s assistance. (The majority protests that this\n\u201cshould go without saying\u2014except that JUSTICE SCALIA\ncompels us to say it,\u201d ibid., seemingly forgetting that the\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Or can litigants seek\ninvalidation of an appointment made during a 10-day\nbreak by pointing to an absence of \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201curgent\u201d\ncircumstances necessitating an immediate appointment,\nalbeit without the aid of a \u201cpresumpt[ion]\u201d in their favor?\nOr, to put the question as it will present itself to lawyers\nin the Executive Branch: Can the President make an\nappointment during a 10-day break simply to overcome\n\u201cpolitical opposition in the Senate\u201d despite the absence of\nany \u201cnational catastrophe,\u201d even though it \u201cgo[es] without\nsaying\u201d that he cannot do so during a 9-day break? Who\nknows? The majority does not say, and neither does the\nConstitution.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority erroneously suggests that the \u201clack of a textual floor\nraises a problem that plagues\u201d both interpretations of \u201cthe Recess.\u201d\nAnte, at 19. Not so. If the Clause is given its plain meaning, the\nPresident cannot make recess appointments during the session but can\nmake recess appointments during any break between sessions, no\nmatter how short. Contra the majority, that is not a \u201cproblem.\u201d True,\nthe recess-appointment power applies even during very short inter\u00ad\nsession breaks. But inter-session breaks typically occur at most a few\ntimes a year, and the recess-appointment power is of limited utility\nduring very short inter-session breaks since, as explained below, the\nPresident can fill only those vacancies that arise during the break. See\nPart III, infra. Of course, as the Senate Judiciary Committee has\nargued, the break must be actual and not \u201cconstructive\u201d; the Senate\nmust adjourn for some measurable period of time between the two\nsessions. See infra, at 20\u201322. But the requirement that there actually\nbe a recess does not involve anywhere near the level of indeterminacy\nentailed by the majority\u2019s requirement that the recess be long enough\n(or the circumstances unusual enough), as determined by a court, to\n16                   NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Even if the many questions raised by the majority\u2019s\nfailure to articulate a standard could be answered, a\nlarger question would remain: If the Constitution\u2019s text\nempowers the President to make appointments during any\nbreak in the Senate\u2019s proceedings, by what right does the\nmajority subject the President\u2019s exercise of that power to\nvague, court-crafted limitations with no textual basis?\nThe majority claims its temporal guideposts are informed\nby executive practice, but a President\u2019s self-restraint\ncannot \u201cbind his successors by diminishing their powers.\u201d\nFree Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at 497; cf. Clinton v.\nJones, 520 U. S. 681, 718 (1997) (BREYER, J., concurring in\njudgment) (\u201cvoluntary actions\u201d by past Presidents \u201ctel[l] us\nlittle about what the Constitution commands\u201d).\n   An interpretation that calls for this kind of judicial\nadventurism cannot be correct. Indeed, if the Clause\nreally did use \u201cRecess\u201d in its colloquial sense, then there\nwould be no \u201cjudicially discoverable and manageable\nstandard for resolving\u201d whether a particular break was\nlong enough to trigger the recess-appointment power,\nmaking that a nonjusticiable political question.

Historical Practice\n  For the foregoing reasons, the Constitution\u2019s text and\nstructure unambiguously refute the majority\u2019s freewheel\u00ad\ning interpretation of \u201cthe Recess.\u201d It is not plausible that\nthe Constitution uses that term in a sense that authorizes\nthe President to make unilateral appointments during any\nbreak in Senate proceedings, subject only to hazy, atextual\nlimits crafted by this Court centuries after ratification.\nThe majority, however, insists that history \u201coffers strong\nsupport\u201d for its interpretation.

S. ____ (2014)                  17\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\npractice of the political branches is, of course, irrelevant\nwhen the Constitution is clear. But even if the Constitu\u00ad\ntion were thought ambiguous on this point, history does\nnot support the majority\u2019s interpretation.\n                       1. 1789 to 1866\n  To begin, the majority dismisses the 78 years of history\nfrom the founding through 1866 as \u201cnot helpful\u201d because\nduring that time Congress took hardly any \u201csignificant\u201d\nintra-session breaks, by which the majority evidently\nmeans breaks longer than three days. Ibid. (citing table in\nAppendix A, which does not include breaks of three or\nfewer days). In fact, Congress took 11 intra-session breaks\nof more than three days during that time, see Congres\u00ad\nsional Directory 524\u2013527, and it appears Presidents made\nrecess appointments during none of them.\n  More importantly, during those eight decades, Congress\nmust have taken thousands of breaks that were three days\nor shorter. On the majority\u2019s reading, every one of those\nbreaks would have been within the Clause\u2019s text\u2014the\nmajority\u2019s newly minted limitation not yet having been\nannounced. Yet there is no record of anyone, ever, having\nso much as mentioned the possibility that the recess\u00ad\nappointment power was activated during those breaks.\nThat would be surprising indeed if the text meant what\nthe majority thinks it means. Cf. Printz v. United States,\n521 U. S. 898, 907\u2013908 (1997).\n                      2. 1867 and 1868\n  The first intra-session recess appointments in our his\u00ad\ntory almost certainly were made by President Andrew John\u00ad\nson in 1867 and 1868.5 That was, of course, a period of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority does not contend otherwise. The Solicitor General\nclaims that President Lincoln appointed a handful of brigadier generals\nduring intra-session breaks in 1862 and 1863, but he does not include\nthose appointments in his list of known intra-session recess appoint\u00ad\n18                    NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndramatic conflict between the Executive and Congress\nthat saw the first-ever impeachment of a sitting President.\nThe Solicitor General counts 57 intra-session recess ap\u00ad\npointments during those two years. App. to Brief for\nPetitioner 1a\u20139a. But the precise nature and historical\nunderstanding of many of those appointments is subject to\ndebate. See, e.g., Brief for Constitutional Law Scholars as\nAmici Curiae 23\u201324; Rappaport, Nonoriginalism 27\u201333. It\nseems likely that at least 36 of the 57 appointments were\nmade with the understanding that they took place during\na recess between sessions. See id., at 27\u201331.\n   As for the remainder, the historical record reveals noth\u00ad\ning about how they were justified, if at all. There is no\nindication that Johnson\u2019s Attorney General or anyone else\nconsidered at the time whether those appointments were\nmade between or during formal legislative sessions or, if\nthe latter, how they could be squared with the constitu\u00ad\ntional text. The majority drives that point home by citing\na judicial opinion that upheld one of the appointments\nnearly two decades later with no analysis of the question\npresented here. See ante, at 11 (citing Gould v. United\nStates, 19 Ct. Cl. 593 (1884)). Johnson\u2019s intra-session\nappointments were disavowed by the first Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral to address that question, see infra, at 20, and were\nnot followed as precedent by the Executive Branch for\nmore than 50 years, see infra, at 22. Thus, the relevance\nof those appointments to our constitutional inquiry is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nments. Compare Brief for Petitioner 22 with App. to Brief for Petitioner\n1a. Noel Canning convincingly argues that the generals were not given\nrecess appointments but only unofficial \u201cacting appointments\u201d for\nwhich they received no commissions.

For one thing, the Senate adjourned for\nmore than 3 days 45 times during that period, and 43 of\nthose adjournments exceeded 10 days (and thus would not\neven be subject to the majority\u2019s \u201cpresumption\u201d against\nthe availability of recess appointments). See Congres\u00ad\nsional Directory 527\u2013529. Yet there is no evidence that a\nsingle appointment was made during any of those ad\u00ad\njournments or that any President before the 20th century\neven considered making such appointments.\n  In 1901 Philander Knox, the first Attorney General\nknown to have opined on the question, explicitly stated\nthat the recess-appointment power was limited to the\nperiod between formal sessions. 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 599.\nKnox advised President Theodore Roosevelt that he could\nnot appoint an appraiser of merchandise during an intra\u00ad\nsession adjournment. He explained:\n    \u201c[T]he Constitution and laws make it clear that in our\n    legislative practice an adjournment during a session\n    of Congress means a merely temporary suspension of\n    business from day to day . . . whereas the recess means\n    the period after the final adjournment of Congress for\n    the session, and before the next session begins. . . . It\n    is this period following the final adjournment for the\n    session which is the recess during which the President\n    has power to fill vacancies . . . . Any intermediate\n    temporary adjournment is not such recess, although it\n20                    NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n     may be a recess in the general and ordinary use of\n     that term.\u201d Id., at 601.6\nKnox went on to observe that none of the \u201cmany elaborate\nopinions\u201d of previous Attorneys General concerning the\nrecess-appointment power had asserted that the power\ncould be exercised \u201cduring a temporary adjournment of the\nSenate,\u201d rather than \u201cduring the recess of the Senate\nbetween two sessions of Congress.\u201d Id., at 602. He\nacknowledged the contrary example furnished by John\u00ad\nson\u2019s appointments in 1867 and 1868, but noted (with\nperhaps too much tact) that \u201c[t]he public circumstances\nproducing this state of affairs were unusual and involved\nresults which should not be viewed as precedents.\u201d Id.,\nat 603.\n  That was where things stood when, in 1903, Roosevelt\nmade a number of controversial recess appointments. At\nnoon on December 7, the Senate moved seamlessly from a\nspecial session into a regular one scheduled to begin at\nthat hour. See 37 Cong. Rec. 544; 38 Cong. Rec. 1. Roose\u00ad\nvelt claimed to have made the appointments in a \u201ccon\u00ad\nstructive\u201d recess between the two sessions. See Special\nSession Is Merged Into Regular, N. Y. Times, Dec. 8, 1903,\np. 1. He and his allies in the Senate justified the ap\u00ad\npointments on the theory that \u201cat the moment the gavel\nfalls to summon the regular session into being there is an\ninfinitesimal fraction of a second, which is the recess\nbetween the two sessions.\u201d Extra Session Muddle, N. Y.\nTimes, Dec. 7, 1903, p. 3. In 1905, the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee published a report criticizing the appointments\non the ground that \u201cthe Constitution means a real recess,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The majority dismisses Knox\u2019s opinion as overly formalistic because\n\nit \u201crelied heavily upon the use of the word \u2018the\u2019 \u201d in the phrase \u201cthe\nRecess.\u201d Ante, at 13. It did not. As the passage quoted above makes\nclear, Knox was relying on the common understanding of what \u201cthe\nRecess\u201d meant in the context of marking out legislative time.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

The report explained that the recess is \u201cthe\nperiod of time when the Senate is not sitting in regular or\nextraordinary session . . . when its members owe no duty\nof attendance; when its Chamber is empty; when, because\nof its absence, it can not receive communications from the\nPresident or participate as a body in making appoint\u00ad\nments.\u201d Id., at 2 (emphasis deleted).\n   The majority seeks support in this episode, claiming\nthat the Judiciary Committee embraced a \u201cbroad and\nfunctional definition of \u2018recess\u2019 \u201d consistent with the one\nthe majority adopts. Ante, at 16. On the contrary, the\nepisode powerfully refutes the majority\u2019s theory. Roosevelt\u2019s\nlegal justification for his appointments was extremely\naggressive, but even he recognized that \u201cthe Recess of\nthe Senate\u201d could take place only between formal sessions.\nIf the majority\u2019s view of the Clause had been considered\nplausible, Roosevelt could have strengthened his position\nconsiderably by making the appointments during an intra\u00ad\nsession break of a few days, or at least a few hours. (Just\n10 minutes after the new session began on December 7,\nthe Senate took \u201ca recess for one hour.\u201d 38 Cong. Rec. 2.)\nThat he instead strained to declare a dubious inter-session\nrecess of an \u201cinfinitesimal fraction of a second\u201d is powerful\nevidence that the majority\u2019s view of \u201cthe Recess\u201d was not\ntaken seriously even as late as the beginning of the 20th\ncentury.\n   Yet the majority contends that \u201cto the extent that the\nSenate or a Senate committee has expressed a view, that\nview has favored a functional definition of \u2018recess\u2019 [that]\nencompasses intra-session recesses.\u201d Ante, at 14. It rests\nthat contention entirely on the 1905 Judiciary Committee\nReport. This distorts what the committee said when it\ndenied Roosevelt\u2019s claim that there had been a recess. If\nsomeone avers that a catfish is a cat, and I respond by\npointing out that a catfish lives in water and does not have\n22                NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfour legs, I have not endorsed the proposition that every\nland-dwelling quadruped is a cat. Likewise, when the\nJudiciary Committee explained that an instantaneous\ntransition from one session to another is not a recess\nbecause the Senate is never absent, it did not suggest that\nthe Senate\u2019s absence is enough to create a recess. To\nassume otherwise, as the majority does, is to commit the\nfallacy of the inverse (otherwise known as denying the\nantecedent): the incorrect assumption that if P implies Q,\nthen not-P implies not-Q. Contrary to that fallacious\nassumption, the Judiciary Committee surely believed,\nconsistent with the Executive\u2019s clear position at the time,\nthat \u201cthe Recess\u201d was limited to (actual, not constructive)\nbreaks between sessions.\n                    4. 1921 to the Present\n   It is necessary to skip over the first 13 decades of our\nNation\u2019s history in order to find a Presidential legal ad\u00ad\nviser arguably embracing the majority\u2019s interpretation of\n\u201cthe Recess.\u201d In 1921 President Harding\u2019s Attorney General,\nHarry Daugherty, advised Harding that he could make\nrecess appointments while the Senate stood adjourned for\n28 days during the session because \u201cthe term \u2018recess\u2019 must\nbe given a practical construction.\u201d 33 Op. Atty. Gen. 20,\n25. Daugherty acknowledged Knox\u2019s 1901 opinion to the\ncontrary, id., at 21, but he (committing the same fallacy as\ntoday\u2019s majority) thought the 1905 Judiciary Committee\nreport had come to the opposite conclusion, id., at 23\u201324.\nHe also recognized the fundamental flaw in this interpre\u00ad\ntation: that it would be impossible to \u201caccurately dra[w]\u201d a\nline between intra-session breaks that constitute \u201cthe\nRecess\u201d and those that do not. Id., at 25. But he thought\nthe absence of a standard gave the President \u201cdiscretion to\ndetermine when there is a real and genuine recess.\u201d Ibid.\nWhile a \u201cpalpable abuse of discretion might subject his\nappointment to review,\u201d Daugherty thought that \u201c[e]very\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

The Solicitor General has\nidentified 22 such appointments made by Presidents\nHarding, Coolidge, Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt be\u00ad\ntween 1921 and 1944. App. to Brief for Petitioner 9a\u201312a.\nIntra-session recess appointments experienced a brief\nheyday after World War II, with President Truman mak\u00ad\ning about 150 such appointments to civilian positions and\nseveral thousand to military posts from 1945 through\n1950. Id., at 12a\u201327a. (The majority\u2019s impressive\u00ad\nsounding claim that \u201cPresidents have made thousands of\nintra-session recess appointments,\u201d ante, at 12, depends\nentirely on post-war military appointments that Truman\nmade in just two years, 1947 and 1948.) President Eisen\u00ad\nhower made only 43 intra-session recess appointments,\nid., at 27a\u201330a, after which the practice sank back into\nrelative obscurity. Presidents Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson,\nand Ford made none, while Nixon made just 7. Id., at\n30a\u201331a. The practice rose again in the last decades of\nthe 20th century: President Carter made 17 intra-session\nrecess appointments, Reagan 72, George H. W. Bush 37,\nClinton 53, and George W. Bush 135. Id., at 31a\u201361a.\nWhen the Solicitor General filed his brief, President\nObama had made 26. Id., at 62a\u201364a.

NOEL CANNING\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Legal advisers in the Executive Branch during this\nperiod typically endorsed the President\u2019s authority to\nmake intra-session recess appointments by citing Daugh\u00ad\nerty\u2019s opinion with little or no additional analysis. See,\ne.g., 20 Opinions of Office of Legal Counsel (Op.

The majority\u2019s contention that \u201copinions of\nPresidential legal advisers . . . are nearly unanimous in\ndetermining that the Clause authorizes [intra-session\nrecess] appointments,\u201d ante, at 12, is thus true but mis\u00ad\nleading: No Presidential legal adviser approved that prac\u00ad\ntice before 1921, and subsequent approvals have rested\nmore on precedent than on independent examination.\n   The majority is correct that during this period, the\nSenate \u201cas a body\u201d did not formally repudiate the emerg\u00ad\ning executive practice.

But the rise of intra-session recess\nappointments in the latter half of the 20th century drew\nsharp criticism from a number of Senators on both sides of\nthe aisle. At first, their objections focused on the length of\nthe intra-session breaks at issue. See, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec.\n22774\u201322776 (1984) (Sen.

Rec. 15266\u201315267. The brief argued that \u201cthe\nrecess[-appointment] power is limited to Congress\u2019 annual\nrecess between sessions,\u201d that no contrary executive prac\u00ad\ntice \u201cof any appreciable magnitude\u201d had existed before\n\u201cthe past fifty years,\u201d and that the Senate had not \u201cacqui\u00ad\nesced in this steady expansion of presidential power.\u201d Id.,\nat 15268, 15270. It explained that some Senators had\nlimited their objections to shorter intra-session breaks out\nof a desire \u201cto coexist with the Executive\u201d but that \u201cthe\nExecutive\u2019s subsequent, steady chipping away at the\nlength of recess sufficient for making recess appointments\nha[d] demonstrated the need to return to the Framers\u2019\noriginal intent and limit the power to intersession ad\u00ad\njournments.\u201d Id., at 15267, 15272. Senator Kennedy\nreiterated that position in a brief to this Court in 2004.\nBrief for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as Amicus Curiae in\nFranklin v. United States, O. T. 2004, No. 04\u20135858, p. 5.\nToday the partisan tables are turned, and that position is\nurged on us by the Senate\u2019s Republican Members. See\nBrief for Sen. McConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 26.\n                        *     *    *\n   What does all this amount to? In short: Intra-session\nrecess appointments were virtually unheard of for the first\n130 years of the Republic, were deemed unconstitutional\nby the first Attorney General to address them, were not\nopenly defended by the Executive until 1921, were not\nmade in significant numbers until after World War II, and\nhave been repeatedly criticized as unconstitutional by\nSenators of both parties. It is astonishing for the majority\nto assert that this history lends \u201cstrong support,\u201d ante, at\n11, to its interpretation of the Recess Appointments\nClause. And the majority\u2019s contention that recent execu\u00ad\ntive practice in this area merits deference because the\n26                NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nSenate has not done more to oppose it is utterly divorced\nfrom our precedent. \u201cThe structural interests protected by\nthe Appointments Clause are not those of any one branch\nof Government but of the entire Republic,\u201d Freytag, 501\nU. S., at 880, and the Senate could not give away those\nprotections even if it wanted to. See Chadha, 462 U. S., at\n957\u2013958; Clinton, 524 U. S., at 451\u2013452 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring).\n   Moreover, the majority\u2019s insistence that the Senate\ngainsay an executive practice \u201cas a body\u201d in order to pre\u00ad\nvent the Executive from acquiring power by adverse pos\u00ad\nsession, ante, at 14, will systematically favor the expansion\nof executive power at the expense of Congress. In any con\u00ad\ntroversy between the political branches over a separation\u00ad\nof-powers question, staking out a position and defending\nit over time is far easier for the Executive Branch than\nfor the Legislative Branch. See generally Bradley and\nMorrison, Historical Gloss and the Separation of Powers,\n126 Harv. L. Rev. 411, 439\u2013447 (2012). All Presidents\nhave a high interest in expanding the powers of their\noffice, since the more power the President can wield, the\nmore effectively he can implement his political agenda;\nwhereas individual Senators may have little interest in\nopposing Presidential encroachment on legislative prerog\u00ad\natives, especially when the encroacher is a President who\nis the leader of their own party. (The majority would not\nbe able to point to a lack of \u201cformal action\u201d by the Senate\n\u201cas a body\u201d challenging intra-session recess appointments,\nante, at 15\u201316, had the appointing President\u2019s party in the\nSenate not blocked such action on multiple occasions.)\nAnd when the President wants to assert a power and\nestablish a precedent, he faces neither the collective-action\nproblems nor the procedural inertia inherent in the legis\u00ad\nlative process. The majority\u2019s methodology thus all but\nguarantees the continuing aggrandizement of the Execu\u00ad\ntive Branch.\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

Pre-Recess Vacancies\n  The second question presented is whether vacancies\nthat \u201chappen during the Recess of the Senate,\u201d which the\nPresident is empowered to fill with recess appointments,\nare (a) vacancies that arise during the recess, or (b) all\nvacancies that exist during the recess, regardless of when\nthey arose. I would hold that the recess-appointment\npower is limited to vacancies that arise during the recess\nin which they are filled, and I would hold that the ap\u00ad\npointments at issue here\u2014which undisputedly filled pre\u00ad\nrecess vacancies\u2014are invalid for that reason as well as for\nthe reason that they were made during the session. The\nCourt\u2019s contrary conclusion is inconsistent with the Con\u00ad\nstitution\u2019s text and structure, and it further undermines\nthe balance the Framers struck between Presidential and\nSenatorial power. Historical practice also fails to support\nthe majority\u2019s conclusion on this issue.\n                       A. Plain Meaning\n   As the majority concedes, \u201cthe most natural meaning of\n\u2018happens\u2019 as applied to a \u2018vacancy\u2019 . . . is that the vacancy\n\u2018happens\u2019 when it initially occurs.\u201d Ante, at 22. The ma\u00ad\njority adds that this meaning is most natural \u201cto a modern\near,\u201d ibid., but it fails to show that founding-era ears\nheard it differently. \u201cHappen\u201d meant then, as it does now,\n\u201c[t]o fall out; to chance; to come to pass.\u201d 1 Johnson, Dic\u00ad\ntionary of the English Language 913. Thus, a vacancy\nthat happened during the Recess was most reasonably\nunderstood as one that arose during the recess. It was, of\ncourse, possible in certain contexts for the word \u201chappen\u201d\nto mean \u201chappen to be\u201d rather than \u201chappen to occur,\u201d as\nin the idiom \u201cit so happens.\u201d But that meaning is not at\nall natural when the subject is a vacancy, a state of affairs\nthat comes into existence at a particular moment in time.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 8 Despite   initially admitting that the text \u201cdoes not naturally favor\u201d\n28                     NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   In any event, no reasonable reader would have under\u00ad\nstood the Recess Appointments Clause to use the word\n\u201chappen\u201d in the majority\u2019s \u201chappen to be\u201d sense, and thus\nto empower the President to fill all vacancies that might\nexist during a recess, regardless of when they arose. For\none thing, the Clause\u2019s language would have been a sur\u00ad\npassingly odd way of giving the President that power. The\nClause easily could have been written to convey that\nmeaning clearly: It could have referred to \u201call Vacancies\nthat may exist during the Recess,\u201d or it could have omitted\nthe qualifying phrase entirely and simply authorized the\nPresident to \u201cfill up all Vacancies during the Recess.\u201d\nGiven those readily available alternative phrasings, the\nreasonable reader might have wondered, why would any\nintelligent drafter intending the majority\u2019s reading have\ninserted the words \u201cthat may happen\u201d\u2014words that, as the\nmajority admits, make the majority\u2019s desired reading\nawkward and unnatural, and that must be effectively read\nout of the Clause to achieve that reading?\n   For another thing, the majority\u2019s reading not only\nstrains the Clause\u2019s language but distorts its constitutional\nrole, which was meant to be subordinate. As Hamilton\nexplained, appointment with the advice and consent of the\nSenate was to be \u201cthe general mode of appointing officers\nof the United States.\u201d The Federalist No. 67, at 455. The\nSenate\u2019s check on the President\u2019s appointment power was\nseen as vital because \u201c \u2018manipulation of official appoint\u00ad\nments\u2019 had long been one of the American revolutionary\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nits interpretation, the majority halfheartedly suggests that the \u201c \u2018hap\u00ad\npen to be\u2019 \u201d reading may be admissible when the subject, like \u201cvacancy,\u201d\ndenotes a \u201ccontinuing state.\u201d Ante, at 22\u201323. That suggestion distorts\nordinary English usage. It is indeed natural to say that an ongoing\nactivity or event, like a war, a parade, or a financial crisis, is \u201chappen\u00ad\ning\u201d for as long as it continues. But the same is not true when the\nsubject is a settled state of affairs, like death, marriage, or vacancy, all\nof which \u201chappen\u201d when they come into being.\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

The unilateral power conferred\non the President by the Recess Appointments Clause was\ntherefore understood to be \u201cnothing more than a supple\u00ad\nment\u201d to the \u201cgeneral method\u201d of advice and consent. The\nFederalist No. 67, at 455.\n   If, however, the Clause had allowed the President to fill\nall pre-existing vacancies during the recess by granting\ncommissions that would last throughout the following\nsession, it would have been impossible to regard it\u2014as the\nFramers plainly did\u2014as a mere codicil to the Constitu\u00ad\ntion\u2019s principal, power-sharing scheme for filling federal\noffices. On the majority\u2019s reading, the President would\nhave had no need ever to seek the Senate\u2019s advice and\nconsent for his appointments: Whenever there was a fair\nprospect of the Senate\u2019s rejecting his preferred nominee,\nthe President could have appointed that individual unilat\u00ad\nerally during the recess, allowed the appointment to ex\u00ad\npire at the end of the next session, renewed the appoint\u00ad\nment the following day, and so on ad infinitum.\n(Circumvention would have been especially easy if, as the\nmajority also concludes, the President was authorized to\nmake such appointments during any intra-session break of\nmore than a few days.) It is unthinkable that such an\nobvious means for the Executive to expand its power\nwould have been overlooked during the ratification\ndebates.9\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The majority insists that \u201ccharacter and politics\u201d will ordinarily\n\nprevent the President from circumventing the Senate, and that the\nSenate has \u201cpolitical resources\u201d to respond to attempts at circumven\u00ad\ntion. Ante, at 25. Neither character nor politics prevented Theodore\nRoosevelt from proclaiming a fictitious recess lasting an \u201cinfinitesimal\nfraction of a second.\u201d In any event, the Constitution does not entrust\nthe Senate\u2019s role in the appointments process to the vagaries of charac\u00ad\nter and politics. See, e.g., Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 879\u2013\n880 (1991).\n30                   NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n    The original understanding of the Clause was consistent\nwith what the majority concedes is the text\u2019s \u201cmost natu\u00ad\nral meaning.\u201d Ante, at 22. In 1792, Attorney General\nEdmund Randolph, who had been a leading member of the\nConstitutional Convention, provided the Executive\nBranch\u2019s first formal interpretation of the Clause. He\nadvised President Washington that the Constitution did\nnot authorize a recess appointment to fill the office of\nChief Coiner of the United States Mint, which had been\ncreated by Congress on April 2, 1792, during the Senate\u2019s\nsession. Randolph wrote: \u201c[I]s it a vacancy which has\nhappened during the recess of the Senate? It is now the\nsame and no other vacancy, than that, which existed on\nthe 2nd. of April 1792. It commenced therefore on that\nday or may be said to have happened on that day.\u201d Opin\u00ad\nion on Recess Appointments (July 7, 1792), in 24 Papers of\nThomas Jefferson 165\u2013166 (J. Catanzariti ed. 1990).\nRandolph added that his interpretation was the most\ncongruent with the Constitution\u2019s structure, which made\nthe recess-appointment power \u201can exception to the general\nparticipation of the Senate.\u201d Ibid. (footnote omitted).\n    President John Adams\u2019 Attorney General, Charles Lee,\nwas in agreement.

See 1 St.\nGeorge Tucker, Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, App. 342\u2013343\n(1803) (assuming the President could appoint during the\nrecess only if \u201cthe office became vacant during the recess\u201d).\n  Early Congresses seem to have shared Randolph\u2019s and\nLee\u2019s view. A statute passed by the First Congress author\u00ad\nized the President to appoint customs inspectors \u201cwith the\nadvice and consent of the Senate\u201d and provided that \u201cif the\nappointment . . . shall not be made during the present\nsession of Congress, the President . . . is hereby empow\u00ad\nered to make such appointments during the recess of the\nSenate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the\nend of their next session.\u201d Act of Mar. 3, 1791, \u00a74, 1 Stat.\n200. That authorization would have been superfluous if\nthe Recess Appointments Clause had been understood to\napply to pre-existing vacancies. We have recognized that\nan action taken by the First Congress \u201cprovides \u2018contem\u00ad\nporaneous and weighty evidence\u2019 of the Constitution\u2019s\nmeaning.\u201d Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 723\u2013724. And other\nstatutes passed in the early years of the Republic con\u00ad\ntained similar authorizations. See App. to Brief for Re\u00ad\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nadministration, \u2018whenever an office became vacant, so short a time\nbefore Congress rose, as not to give an opportunity of enquiring for a\nproper character, they let it lie always till recess.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 27 (quoting\nLetter from Jefferson to Wilson Cary Nicholas (Jan. 26, 1802), in 36\nPapers of Thomas Jefferson 433 (B. Oberg ed. 2009) (hereinafter 1802\nJefferson Letter)). Assuming Lee in fact made the statement attributed\nto him by Jefferson, and further assuming that Lee endorsed the\nconstitutionality of the practice described in that statement (which\nJefferson does not say), that practice could only have been regarded as\na pragmatic exception to the general view of the Clause that Lee, like\nRandolph, espoused. And the practice must not have been extensive,\nsince the Solicitor General has been unable to identify even a single\nappointment made by Adams that filled a pre-recess vacancy. See\ninfra, at 36.\n32                     NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nspondent Noel Canning 1a\u201317a.11\n  Also illuminating is the way the Third Congress inter\u00ad\npreted the Constitution\u2019s Senate Vacancies Clause, which\nuses language similar to that of the Recess Appointments\nClause. Before the passage of the Seventeenth Amend\u00ad\nment, the Constitution provided that \u201cif Vacancies [in the\nSenate] happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the\nRecess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive\nthereof may make temporary Appointments until the next\nMeeting of the Legislature.\u201d Art. I, \u00a73, cl. 2. Senator\nGeorge Read of Delaware resigned in December 1793; the\nstate legislature met in January and February 1794; and\nthe Governor appointed Kensey Johns to fill the seat in\nMarch 1794. The Senate refused to seat Johns, resolving\nthat he was \u201cnot entitled to a seat in the Senate of the\nUnited States; a session of the Legislature of the said\nState having intervened, between the resignation . . . and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The majority suggests that these statutes may have reflected, not a\n\nbelief that the recess-appointment power was limited to vacancies\narising during the recess, but a \u201cseparate\u201d belief that the power could\nnot be used for \u201cnew offices\u201d created by Congress and not previously\nfilled. Ante, at 30. But the latter view (which the majority does not\nendorse) was inseparably linked with the former (which the majority\nrejects), as is made clear by the very source the majority cites. See\nLetter from Alexander Hamilton to James McHenry (May 3, 1799), in\n23 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 94 (H. Syrett ed. 1976) (\u201c[T]he power\nto fill the vacancy is not the power to make an original appointment.\nThe phrase \u2018Which may have happened\u2019 serves to confirm this construc\u00ad\ntion. . . .

Rawle, A View of the\nConstitution of the United States of America 163 (2d ed. 1829) (reprint\n2009) (\u201cIt has been held by [the Senate], that if new offices are created\nby congress, the president cannot, after the adjournment of the senate,\nmake appointments to fill them. The vacancies do not happen during\nthe recess of the senate\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

It is\nthus clear that the phrase \u201chappen . . . during the Recess\u201d\nin the Senate Vacancies Clause was understood to refer to\nvacancies that arose, not merely existed, during the recess\nin which the appointment was made. It is not apparent\nwhy the nearly identical language of the Recess Appoint\u00ad\nments Clause would have been understood differently.\n   The majority, however, relies heavily on a contrary\naccount of the Clause given by Attorney General William\nWirt in 1823. See 1 Op. Atty. Gen 631. Wirt notably\nbegan\u2014as does the majority\u2014by acknowledging that his\npredecessors\u2019 reading was \u201cmost accordant with the letter\nof the constitution.\u201d Id., at 632. But he thought the \u201cmost\nnatural\u201d reading had to be rejected because it would inter\u00ad\nfere with the \u201csubstantial purpose of the constitution,\u201d\nnamely, \u201ckeep[ing] . . . offices filled.\u201d Id., at 631\u2013632. He\nwas chiefly concerned that giving the Clause its plain\nmeaning would produce \u201cembarrassing inconveniences\u201d if\na distant office were to become vacant during the Senate\u2019s\nsession, but news of the vacancy were not to reach the\nPresident until the recess. Id., at 632, 634. The majority\nfully embraces Wirt\u2019s reasoning. Ante, at 22\u201325.\n   Wirt\u2019s argument is doubly flawed. To begin, the Consti\u00ad\ntution provides ample means, short of rewriting its text,\nfor dealing with the hypothetical dilemma Wirt posed.\nCongress can authorize \u201cacting\u201d officers to perform the\nduties associated with a temporarily vacant office\u2014and\nhas done that, in one form or another, since 1792. See 5\nU. S. C. \u00a73345; Act of May 8, 1792, ch. 37, \u00a78, 1 Stat. 281;\n705 F. 3d, at 511; Rappaport, Original Meaning 1514\u2013\n1517. And on \u201cextraordinary Occasions\u201d the President can\ncall the Senate back into session to consider a nomination.\nArt. II, \u00a73. If the Framers had thought those options\ninsufficient and preferred to authorize the President to\nmake recess appointments to fill vacancies arising late in\nthe session, they would have known how to do so.

OLC 119, 121 (1982). But just a few\nlines later, the majority says that \u201cthe lack of Senate\napproval . . . may diminish the recess appointee\u2019s ability,\nas a practical matter, to get a controversial job done.\u201d\nAnte, at 25. The majority does not explain why an acting\nofficer would have less authority \u201cas a practical matter\u201d\nthan a recess appointee. The majority also objects that\nrequiring the President to rely on acting officers would\n\u201clessen the President\u2019s ability to staff the Executive\nBranch with people of his own choosing,\u201d ante, at 24\u2014a\nsurprising charge, since that is the very purpose of the\nConstitution\u2019s advice-and-consent requirement.

S., at\n957, 959. Wirt\u2019s and the majority\u2019s argumentum ab incon\u00ad\nvenienti thus proves far too much. There are many cir\u00ad\ncumstances other than a vacancy that can produce similar\ninconveniences if they arise late in the session: For exam\u00ad\nple, a natural disaster might occur to which the Executive\ncannot respond effectively without a supplemental appro\u00ad\npriation. But in those circumstances, the Constitution\nwould not permit the President to appropriate funds him\u00ad\nself. See Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 7. Congress must either anticipate\nsuch eventualities or be prepared to be haled back into\nsession. The troublesome need to do so is not a bug to be\nfixed by this Court, but a calculated feature of the consti\u00ad\ntutional framework. As we have recognized, while the\nConstitution\u2019s government-structuring provisions can\nseem \u201cclumsy\u201d and \u201cinefficient,\u201d they reflect \u201chard choices\n. . . consciously made by men who had lived under a form\nof government that permitted arbitrary governmental acts\nto go unchecked.\u201d Chadha, supra, at 959.\n                   B. Historical Practice\n   For the reasons just given, it is clear that the Constitu\u00ad\ntion authorizes the President to fill unilaterally only those\nvacancies that arise during a recess, not every vacancy\nthat happens to exist during a recess. Again, however, the\nmajority says \u201c[h]istorical practice\u201d requires the broader\ninterpretation. Ante, at 26. And again the majority\nis mistaken. Even if the Constitution were wrongly\nthought to be ambiguous on this point, a fair recounting\nof the relevant history does not support the majority\u2019s\ninterpretation.\n                    1. 1789 to 1822\n  The majority correctly admits that there is \u201cno undis\u00ad\nputed record of Presidents George Washington, John\n36                    NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nAdams, or Thomas Jefferson\u201d using a recess appointment\nto fill a pre-recess vacancy. Ibid. That is not surprising in\nlight of Randolph\u2019s early conclusion that doing so would be\nunconstitutional. Adams on one occasion contemplated\nfilling pre-recess vacancies but was dissuaded by, among\nothers, Attorney General Lee, who said the Constitution\ndid not permit him to do so. See 1799 McHenry Letter.12\nAnd the Solicitor General does not allege that even a\nsingle appointment made by Adams filled a pre-recess\nvacancy. Jefferson, too, at one point thought the Clause\n\u201csusceptible of \u201d the majority\u2019s reading, 1802 Jefferson\nLetter, but his administration, like Adams\u2019, appears never\nto have adopted that reading.\n   James Madison\u2019s administration seems to have rejected\nthe majority\u2019s reading as well. In 1814, Madison wanted\nto appoint Andrew Jackson to a vacant major-generalship\nin the Army during the Senate\u2019s recess, but he accepted,\nwithout contradiction or reservation, his Secretary of\nWar\u2019s advice that he lacked the power to do so because the\npost\u2019s previous occupant had resigned before the recess.\nHe therefore ordered that Jackson be given a \u201cbrevet of\nMajor General,\u201d i.e., a warrant conferring the nominal\nrank without the salary thereof.

Before advising Adams, McHenry also\nconsulted Alexander Hamilton, who agreed that the appointments\nwould be unlawful. See Letter from McHenry to Hamilton (Apr. 26,\n1799), in 23 Papers of Alexander Hamilton, at 69, 70 (\u201cIt would seem\nthat, under this Constitutional power, the President cannot alone . . .\nfill up vacancies that may happen during a session of the senate\u201d);\nLetter from Hamilton to McHenry (May 3, 1799), in id., at 94 (\u201cIt is\nclear, that independent of the authority of a special law, the President\ncannot fill a vacancy which happens during a session of the Senate\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

In conveying the brevet, Mad\u00ad\nison\u2019s Secretary of War explained to Jackson that \u201c \u2018[t]he\nvacancy produced by General Hampton\u2019s resignation, not\nhaving been filled during the late session of the Senate,\ncannot be supplied constitutionally, during the recess.\u2019 \u201d\nLetter from Armstrong to Jackson (May 22, 1814). A week\nlater, when Madison learned that a different major gen\u00ad\neral had resigned during the recess, he thought that de\u00ad\nvelopment would enable him to appoint Jackson \u201cat once.\u201d\nLetter from Madison to Armstrong (May 24, 1814); see\nLetter from Armstrong to Madison (May 20, 1814) (report\u00ad\ning the resignation).13\n   The majority discounts that evidence of an occasion\nwhen Madison and his advisers actually considered the\nprecise constitutional question presented here. It does so\napparently because Madison, in acting on the advice he\nwas given without questioning the interpretation of the\nrecess-appointment power that was offered as the reason\nfor that advice, did not explicitly say \u201cI agree.\u201d The major\u00ad\nity prefers to focus on five appointments by Madison,\nunremarked by anyone at the time, that \u201cthe evidence\nsuggests\u201d filled pre-recess vacancies. Ante, at 27. Even if\nthe majority is correct about those appointments, there is\nno indication that any thought was given to their constitu\u00ad\ntionality, either within or outside the Executive Branch. A\nhandful of appointments that appear to contravene the\nwritten opinions of Attorneys General Randolph and Lee\nand the written evidence of Madison\u2019s own beliefs about\nwhat the Constitution authorized, and that lack any con\u00ad\ntemporaneous explanation, are not convincing evidence of\nthe Constitution\u2019s original meaning.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 All the letters cited in this paragraph are available online\n\ncourtesy of the Library of Congress.

NOEL CANNING\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  If Madison or his predecessors made any appointments\nin reliance on the broader reading, those appointments\nmust have escaped general notice. In 1822, the Senate\nCommittee on Military Affairs declared that the President\nhad \u201cno power to make [appointments] in the recess\u201d\nwhere \u201cthe vacancies did not happen in the recess.\u201d 38\nAnnals of Cong. 500. The Committee believed its con\u00ad\nstruction had been \u201cheretofore observed\u201d and that \u201cno\ninstance ha[d] before occurred . . . where the President\nha[d] felt himself authorized to fill such vacancies, without\nspecial authority by law.\u201d Ibid.; see also T. Sergeant,\nConstitutional Law 373 (2d ed. 1830) (\u201c[I]t seemed dis\u00ad\ntinctly understood to be the sense of the senate, that [it]\nis only in offices that become vacant during the recess,\nthat the president is authorised to exercise the right of\nappointing\u201d).\n                      2. 1823 to 1862\n   The Executive Branch did not openly depart from Ran\u00ad\ndolph and Lee\u2019s interpretation until 1823, when Wirt\nissued the opinion discussed earlier. Even within that\nbranch, Wirt\u2019s view was hotly contested: William Craw\u00ad\nford, Monroe\u2019s Treasury Secretary, argued \u201cwith great\npertinacity\u201d that the Clause authorized the President to\nfill only \u201cvacancies which happen during the recess\u201d and\nnot those \u201cwhich happen while Congress are in session.\u201d 5\nMemoirs of John Quincy Adams 486\u2013487 (C.

Noel Canning disputes that claim, point\u00ad\ning out that Washington told the Senate the offices in question had\n\u201c \u2018fallen vacant during the recess\u2019 \u201d and arguing that Jefferson may have\nremoved the incumbent officers during the recess. Brief for Respondent\nNoel Canning 44. Suffice it to say that if either Washington or Jeffer\u00ad\nson had adopted the broader reading, against the written advice of\nAttorneys General Randolph and Lee, one would expect a good deal\nmore evidence of that fact.\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

Atty. Gen. 333, 334. Two years\nlater, Attorney General Taney endorsed Wirt\u2019s view al\u00ad\nthough doing so was, as he acknowledged, unnecessary to\nresolve the issue before him: whether the President could,\nduring the recess, fill a vacancy resulting from the expira\u00ad\ntion of a prior recess appointment at the end of the Sen\u00ad\nate\u2019s session. 2 Op. Atty Gen. 525, 528 (1832). Addressing\nthe same issue in 1841, Attorney General Legar\u00e9 appeared\nto believe the dispositive question was whether the office\ncould be said to have \u201cbecom[e] vacant\u201d during the recess.\n3 Op. Atty. Gen. 673, 674. And in 1845, Attorney General\nMason thought it \u201cwell established\u201d that \u201c[i]f vacancies are\nknown to exist during the session of the Senate, and nom\u00ad\ninations are not then made, they cannot be filled by execu\u00ad\ntive appointments in the recess.\u201d 4 Op. Atty. Gen. 361,\n363.15\n   The tide seemed to turn\u2014as far as the Executive\nBranch was concerned\u2014in the mid-19th century: Attorney\nGeneral Cushing in 1855 and Attorney General Bates in\n1862 both treated Wirt\u2019s position as settled without sub\u00ad\njecting it to additional analysis. 7 Op.

In reaching that conclusion, Mason reiterated that the\nrecess-appointment power \u201cdepends on the happening of vacancies\nwhen the Senate is not in session\u201d and said the vacancy at issue was\n\u201cwithin the meaning of\u201d the Clause because the happening of the\nvacancy and the termination of the session had \u201coccurred eo instanti.\u201d\n4 Op.

And as one 19th\u00ad\ncentury court shrewdly observed in rejecting Wirt\u2019s inter\u00ad\npretation, the frequency with which Attorneys General\nduring this period were called upon to opine on the ques\u00ad\ntion likely \u201cindicate[s] that no settled administrative\nusage had been . . . established.\u201d In re District Attorney of\nUnited States, 7 F.

App. to\nBrief for Petitioner 68a\u201371a. That is hardly an impressive\nnumber, and most of the appointments were to minor\noffices (like Deputy Postmaster for Janesville, Wisconsin,\nid., at 70a) unlikely to have gotten the Senate\u2019s attention.\nBut the Senate did notice when, in 1862, President Lin\u00ad\ncoln recess-appointed David Davis to fill a seat on this\nCourt that had become vacant before the recess, id., at\n71a\u2014and it reacted with vigor.\n                       3. 1863 to 1939\n  Two months after Lincoln\u2019s recess appointment of Davis,\nthe Senate directed the Judiciary Committee \u201cto inquire\nwhether the practice . . . of appointing officers to fill va\u00ad\ncancies which have not occurred during the recess of Con\u00ad\ngress, but which existed at the preceding session of Con\u00ad\ngress, is in accordance with the Constitution; and if not,\nwhat remedy shall be applied.\u201d Cong. Globe, 37th Cong.,\n3d Sess., 100 (1862). The committee responded with a\nreport denouncing Wirt\u2019s interpretation of the Clause as\n\u201cartificial,\u201d \u201cforced and unnatural,\u201d \u201cunfounded,\u201d and a\n\u201cperversion of language.\u201d S. Rep. No. 80, 37th Cong., 3d\nSess., pp. 4\u20136 (1863). Because the majority all but ignores\nthis evidence of the Senate\u2019s views, it is worth quoting the\nreport at some length:\n       \u201cWhen must the vacancy . . . accrue or spring into\n     existence?

Once in existence, it has\n    happened, and the mere continuance of the condition\n    of things which the occurrence produces, cannot,\n    without confounding the most obvious distinctions, be\n    taken or treated as the occurrence itself, as Mr. Wirt\n    seems to have done. . . .\n       \u201cAgain, we see no propriety in forcing the language\n    from its popular meaning in order to meet and fulfill\n    one confessedly great purpose, (the keeping the office\n    filled,) while there is plainly another purpose of equal\n    magnitude and importance (fitting qualifications)\n    attached to and inseparable from the former.\u201d Id.,\n    at 3\u20136.\nThe Committee acknowledged that the broad reading\n\u201cha[d] been, from time to time, sanctioned by Attorneys\nGeneral . . . and that the Executive ha[d], from time to\ntime, practiced upon it,\u201d but it said the Executive\u2019s prac\u00ad\ntice was entitled to no weight because the Constitution\u2019s\ntext was \u201ctoo plain to admit of a doubt or to need interpre\u00ad\ntation.\u201d Id., at 7.\n   On the same day the Committee published its scathing\n42                 NLRB v.

It may not be in our\n     power to prevent the appointment, but it is in our\n     power to prevent the payment; and when payment is\n     prevented, I think that will probably put an end to the\n     habit of making such appointments.\u201d Id., at 565.\nThe amendment was adopted by the Senate, ibid., and\nafter passing the House became the Pay Act, which pro\u00ad\nvided that \u201cno money shall be paid . . . out of the Treasury,\nas salary, to any person appointed during the recess of the\nSenate, to fill a vacancy . . . which . . . existed while the\nSenate was in session.\u201d Act of Feb. 9, 1863, \u00a72, 12 Stat.\n646 (codified at Rev.

Even more\nremarkably, the majority goes on to claim that the Sen\u00ad\nate\u2019s passage of the Pay Act on the same day the commit\u00ad\ntee issued its report was not a strong enough statement to\nimpede the constitutionalization-by-adverse-possession of\nthe power asserted by the Executive. Why not? Because,\nthe majority says, some Senators may have disagreed with\nthe report, and because the Senate did not go so far as to\nmake acceptance of a recess appointment that filled a pre\u00ad\nrecess vacancy \u201ca federal crime.\u201d Ante, at 30\u201331. That\nreasoning starkly illustrates the excessive burden the\nmajority places on the Legislative Branch in contests with\nthe Executive over the separation of powers. See supra,\nat 26.\n   Despite its minimization by subsequent Attorneys Gen\u00ad\neral and by today\u2019s majority, there is no reason to doubt\nthat the Pay Act had a deterrent effect. The Solicitor\nGeneral has identified just 40 recess appointments that\nfilled pre-recess vacancies during the nearly eight decades\nbetween the Act\u2019s passage in 1863 and its amendment in\n1940.

And in 1916, Senators Robinson and Sutherland accepted the\nmajority\u2019s reading without analysis. 53 Cong. Rec. 4298.

See Act of July 11, 1940, ch.\n580, 54 Stat. 751, now codified with nonsubstantive\namendments at 5 U. S. C. \u00a75503. Under the current ver\u00ad\nsion of the Act, \u201c[p]ayment for services may not be made\nfrom the Treasury of the United States to an individual\nappointed during a recess of the Senate to fill a vacancy\u201d\nthat \u201cexisted while the Senate was in session\u201d unless\neither the vacancy arose, or a different individual\u2019s nomi\u00ad\nnation to fill the vacancy was rejected, \u201cwithin 30 days\nbefore the end of the session\u201d; or a nomination was pend\u00ad\ning before the Senate at the end of the session, and the\nindividual nominated was not himself a recess appointee.\n\u00a75503(a)(1)\u2013(3). And if the President fills a pre-recess\nvacancy under one of the circumstances specified in the\nAct, the law requires that he submit a nomination for that\noffice to the Senate \u201cnot later than 40 days after the be\u00ad\nginning of the next session.\u201d \u00a75503(b).\n   The majority says that by allowing salaries to be paid to\nrecess appointees in these narrow circumstances, \u201cthe\n1940 Senate (and later Senates) in effect supported\u201d the\nmajority\u2019s interpretation of the Clause. Ante, at 32. Non\u00ad\nsense. Even as amended, the Act strictly regulates pay\u00ad\nment to recess appointees who fill pre-recess vacancies,\nand it still forbids payment to many officers whose ap\u00ad\npointments are constitutional under the majority\u2019s inter\u00ad\npretation. As amici Senators observe, the 1940 amend\u00ad\nments \u201creflect at most a desire not to punish public\nservants caught in the crossfire\u201d of interbranch conflict.\nBrief for Sen. McConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 30. Surely\nthat inference is more reasonable than the majority\u2019s\nsupposition that Congress, by permitting some of the\nappointees covered by the Act to be paid, meant to signal\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

There is a colorable argu\u00ad\nment\u2014which is routinely made by lawyers in the Execu\u00ad\ntive Branch\u2014that Congress \u201c \u2018cannot use the appropria\u00ad\ntions power to control a Presidential power that is beyond\nits direct control.\u2019 \u201d 33 Op. OLC ___, ___ (2009), online\nat http://www.justice.gov/olc/opiniondocs/section7054.pdf\n(quoting 20 Op. OLC 253, 267 (1996)). Consistent with\nthat view, the Office of Legal Counsel has maintained that\nCongress could not \u201ccondition . . . the funding of an of\u00ad\nficer\u2019s salary on being allowed to appoint the officer.\u201d 13\nOp. OLC 258, 261 (1989).\n   If that is correct, then the Pay Act\u2019s attempt to control\nthe President\u2019s exercise of the recess-appointment power\nat least raises a substantial constitutional question under\nthe majority\u2019s reading of the Recess Appointments Clause.\nSee Rappaport, Original Meaning 1544\u20131546. The Execu\u00ad\ntive has not challenged the Act\u2019s constitutionality in this\ncase, and I express no opinion on whether such a challenge\nwould succeed. I simply point out that it is impossible to\nregard the amended Pay Act as evidence of Senatorial\nacquiescence in the majority\u2019s reading when that reading\nhas the potential to invalidate the Act.\n   Since the Pay Act was amended, individual Senators\n46                     NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nhave continued to maintain that recess appointments may\nnot constitutionally be used to fill pre-recess vacancies.\nSee, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec. 22780 (statement of seven Sena\u00ad\ntors that a recess appointment to the Federal Reserve\nBoard in 1984 was unconstitutional because the vacancy\n\u201cdid not happen during the recess\u201d); Brief for Sen.\nMcConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 26 (45 Senators taking\nthat view of the Clause). And there is no evidence that the\nwatering-down of the Pay Act produced an immediate\nflood of recess appointments filling pre-recess vacancies.\nThe Solicitor General has pointed us to only 40 such ap\u00ad\npointments between 1940 and the present. App. to Brief\nfor Petitioner 79a\u201389a.\n   The majority, however, finds it significant that in two\nsmall \u201crandom sample[s]\u201d of contemporary recess ap\u00ad\npointments\u201424 since 1981 and 21 since 2000\u2014the bulk of\nthe appointments appear to have filled pre-existing vacan\u00ad\ncies. Ante, at 29. Based on that evidence, the majority\nthinks it \u201ca fair inference that a large proportion of the\nrecess appointments in the history of the Nation have\nfilled pre-existing vacancies.\u201d Ibid. The extrapolation of\nthat sweeping conclusion from a small set of recent data\ndoes not bear even the slightest scrutiny. The majority\nignores two salient facts: First, from the founding until the\nmid-19th century, the President\u2019s authority to make such\nappointments was far from settled even within the Execu\u00ad\ntive Branch. Second, from 1863 until 1940, it was illegal\nto pay any recess appointee who filled a pre-recess va\u00ad\ncancy, which surely discouraged Presidents from making,\nand nominees from accepting, such appointments. Conse\u00ad\nquently, there is no reason to assume that the majority\u2019s\nsampling\u2014even if it accurately reflects practices during\nthe last three decades\u2014is at all typical of practices that\nprevailed throughout \u201cthe history of the Nation.\u201d17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 17 The   majority also notes that many of the intra-session recess ap\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   47\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                        *     *     *\n   In sum: Washington\u2019s and Adams\u2019 Attorneys General\nread the Constitution to restrict recess appointments to\nvacancies arising during the recess, and there is no evi\u00ad\ndence that any of the first four Presidents consciously\ndeparted from that reading. The contrary reading was\nfirst defended by an executive official in 1823, was vehe\u00ad\nmently rejected by the Senate in 1863, was vigorously\nresisted by legislation in place from 1863 until 1940, and\nis arguably inconsistent with legislation in place from\n1940 to the present. The Solicitor General has identified\nonly about 100 appointments that have ever been made\nunder the broader reading, and while it seems likely that\na good deal more have been made in the last few decades,\nthere is good reason to doubt that many were made before\n1940 (since the appointees could not have been compen\u00ad\nsated). I can conceive of no sane constitutional theory\nunder which this evidence of \u201chistorical practice\u201d\u2014which\nis actually evidence of a long-simmering inter-branch\nconflict\u2014would require us to defer to the views of the\nExecutive Branch.\n                   IV. Conclusion\n What the majority needs to sustain its judgment is an\nambiguous text and a clear historical practice. What it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npointments identified by the Solicitor General were made \u201cwithin two\nweeks of the beginning of the recess,\u201d which, according to the majority,\n\u201cstrongly suggests that many of the vacancies initially arose prior to\nthe recess.\u201d Ante, at 29. The inference is unwarranted, since there are\nmany circumstances other than random chance that could cause a\nvacancy to arise early in the recess: For example, the prior officeholder\nmay have been another recess appointee whose commission expired at\nthe end of the Senate\u2019s session, or he may have waited until the recess\nto resign so that his successor could be compensated without violating\nthe Pay Act. In any event, the overwhelming majority of the intra\u00ad\nsession recess appointments on the Solicitor General\u2019s list occurred\nafter 1945 and do not shed light on earlier practices.\n48                NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nhas is a clear text and an at-best-ambiguous historical\npractice. Even if the Executive could accumulate power\nthrough adverse possession by engaging in a consistent\nand unchallenged practice over a long period of time, the\noft-disputed practices at issue here would not meet that\nstandard. Nor have those practices created any justifiable\nexpectations that could be disappointed by enforcing the\nConstitution\u2019s original meaning. There is thus no ground\nfor the majority\u2019s deference to the unconstitutional recess\u00ad\nappointment practices of the Executive Branch.\n   The majority replaces the Constitution\u2019s text with a new\nset of judge-made rules to govern recess appointments.\nHenceforth, the Senate can avoid triggering the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s now-vast recess-appointment power by the odd\ncontrivance of never adjourning for more than three days\nwithout holding a pro forma session at which it is under\u00ad\nstood that no business will be conducted. Ante, at 33\u201334.\nHow this new regime will work in practice remains to be\nseen. Perhaps it will reduce the prevalence of recess\nappointments. But perhaps not: Members of the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s party in Congress may be able to prevent the Sen\u00ad\nate from holding pro forma sessions with the necessary\nfrequency, and if the House and Senate disagree, the\nPresident may be able to adjourn both \u201cto such Time as he\nshall think proper.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a73. In any event,\nthe limitation upon the President\u2019s appointment power is\nthere not for the benefit of the Senate, but for the protec\u00ad\ntion of the people; it should not be dependent on Senate\naction for its existence.\n   The real tragedy of today\u2019s decision is not simply the\nabolition of the Constitution\u2019s limits on the recess\u00ad\nappointment power and the substitution of a novel frame\u00ad\nwork invented by this Court. It is the damage done to our\nseparation-of-powers jurisprudence more generally. It is\nnot every day that we encounter a proper case or contro\u00ad\nversy requiring interpretation of the Constitution\u2019s struc\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           49\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntural provisions. Most of the time, the interpretation of\nthose provisions is left to the political branches\u2014which, in\ndeciding how much respect to afford the constitutional\ntext, often take their cues from this Court. We should\ntherefore take every opportunity to affirm the primacy of\nthe Constitution\u2019s enduring principles over the politics of\nthe moment. Our failure to do so today will resonate well\nbeyond the particular dispute at hand. Sad, but true: The\nCourt\u2019s embrace of the adverse-possession theory of execu\u00ad\ntive power (a characterization the majority resists but\ndoes not refute) will be cited in diverse contexts, including\nthose presently unimagined, and will have the effect of\naggrandizing the Presidency beyond its constitutional\nbounds and undermining respect for the separation of\npowers.\n   I concur in the judgment only.\n",

II, \u00a72, cl. 3\u2014the President appointed\n  the three members in question between the January 3 and January 6\n  pro forma sessions. Noel Canning argued primarily that the ap-\n  pointments were invalid because the 3-day adjournment between\n  those two sessions was not long enough to trigger the Recess Ap-\n  pointments Clause. The D. C. Circuit agreed that the appointments\n  fell outside the scope of the Clause, but on different grounds. It held\n  that the phrase \u201cthe recess,\u201d as used in the Clause, does not include\n  intra-session recesses, and that the phrase \u201cvacancies that may hap-\n  pen during the recess\u201d applies only to vacancies that first come into\n  existence during a recess.\nHeld:\n    1. The Recess Appointments Clause empowers the President to fill\n any existing vacancy during any recess\u2014intra-session or inter-\n session\u2014of sufficient length. Pp. 5\u201333.\n       (a) Two background considerations are relevant to the questions\n here. First, the Recess Appointments Clause is a subsidiary method\n2                        NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    for appointing officers of the United States. The Founders intended\n    the norm to be the method of appointment in Article II, \u00a72, cl. 2,\n    which requires Senate approval of Presidential nominations, at least\n    for principal officers. The Recess Appointments Clause reflects the\n    tension between the President\u2019s continuous need for \u201cthe assistance\n    of subordinates,\u201d Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 117, and the\n    Senate\u2019s early practice of meeting for a single brief session each year.\n    The Clause should be interpreted as granting the President the pow-\n    er to make appointments during a recess but not offering the Presi-\n    dent the authority routinely to avoid the need for Senate confirma-\n    tion.\n       Second, in interpreting the Clause, the Court puts significant\n    weight upon historical practice. The longstanding \u201cpractice of the\n    government,\u201d McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 401, can inform\n    this Court\u2019s determination of \u201cwhat the law is\u201d in a separation-of-\n    powers case, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176. See also, e.g.,\n    Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 401; The Pocket Veto Case,\n    279 U. S. 655, 689\u2013690. There is a great deal of history to consider\n    here, for Presidents have made recess appointments since the begin-\n    ning of the Republic. Their frequency suggests that the Senate and\n    President have recognized that such appointments can be both neces-\n    sary and appropriate in certain circumstances. The Court, in inter-\n    preting the Clause for the first time, must hesitate to upset the com-\n    promises and working arrangements that the elected branches of\n    Government themselves have reached. Pp. 5\u20139.\n         (b) The phrase \u201cthe recess of the Senate\u201d applies to both inter-\n    session recess (i.e., breaks between formal sessions of the Senate) and\n    intra-session recesses (i.e., breaks in the midst of a formal session) of\n    substantial length. The constitutional text is ambiguous. Founding-\n    era dictionaries and usages show that the phrase \u201cthe recess\u201d can en-\n    compass intra-session breaks. And this broader interpretation is\n    demanded by the purpose of the Clause, which is to allow the Presi-\n    dent to make appointments so as to ensure the continued functioning\n    of the Government while the Senate is away. The Senate is equally\n    away and unavailable to participate in the appointments process dur-\n    ing both an inter-session and an intra-session recess. History offers\n    further support for this interpretation. From the founding until the\n    Great Depression, every time the Senate took a substantial, non-\n    holiday intra-session recess, the President made recess appoint-\n    ments. President Andrew Johnson made the first documented intra-\n    session recess appointments in 1867 and 1868, and Presidents made\n    similar appointments in 1921 and 1929. Since 1929, and particularly\n    since the end of World War II, Congress has shortened its inter-\n    session breaks and taken longer and more frequent intra-session\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nbreaks; Presidents accordingly have made more intra-session recess\nappointments. Meanwhile, the Senate has never taken any formal\naction to deny the validity of intra-session recess appointments. In\n1905, the Senate Judiciary Committee defined \u201cthe recess\u201d as \u201cthe\nperiod of time when the Senate\u201d is absent and cannot \u201cparticipate as\na body in making appointments,\u201d S. Rep. No. 4389, 58th Cong., 3d\nSess., p. 2, and that functional definition encompasses both intra-\nsession and inter-session recesses. A 1940 law regulating the pay-\nment of recess appointees has also been interpreted functionally by\nthe Comptroller General (an officer of the Legislative Branch). In\nsum, Presidents have made intra-session recess appointments for a\ncentury and a half, and the Senate has never taken formal action to\noppose them. That practice is long enough to entitle it to \u201cgreat\nweight in a proper interpretation\u201d of the constitutional provision.\nThe Pocket Veto Case, supra, at 689.\n   The Clause does not say how long a recess must be in order to fall\nwithin the Clause, but even the Solicitor General concedes that a 3-\nday recess would be too short. The Adjournments Clause, Art. I, \u00a75,\ncl. 4, reflects the fact that a 3-day break is not a significant interrup-\ntion of legislative business. A Senate recess that is so short that it\ndoes not require the consent of the House under that Clause is not\nlong enough to trigger the President\u2019s recess-appointment power.\nMoreover, the Court has not found a single example of a recess ap-\npointment made during an intra-session recess that was shorter than\n10 days. There are a few examples of inter-session recess appoint-\nments made during recesses of less than 10 days, but these are\nanomalies. In light of historical practice, a recess of more than 3\ndays but less than 10 days is presumptively too short to fall within\nthe Clause. The word \u201cpresumptively\u201d leaves open the possibility\nthat a very unusual circumstance could demand the exercise of the\nrecess-appointment power during a shorter break. Pp. 9\u201321.\n     (c) The phrase \u201cvacancies that may happen during the recess of\nthe Senate,\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 3, applies both to vacancies that first come\ninto existence during a recess and to vacancies that initially occur be-\nfore a recess but continue to exist during the recess. Again, the text\nis ambiguous. As Thomas Jefferson observed, the Clause is \u201ccertain-\nly susceptible of [two] constructions.\u201d Letter to Wilson Cary Nicholas\n(Jan. 26, 1802), in 36 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 433. It \u201cmay mean\n\u2018vacancies that may happen to be\u2019 or \u2018may happen to fall\u2019 \u201d during a\nrecess. Ibid. And, as Attorney General Wirt wrote in 1821, the\nbroader reading is more consonant with the \u201creason and spirit\u201d of the\nClause. 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 632. The purpose of the Clause is to permit\nthe President, who is always acting to execute the law, to obtain the\nassistance of subordinate officers while the Senate, which acts only in\n4                       NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    intervals, is unavailable to confirm them. If a vacancy arises too late\n    in the session for the President and Senate to have an opportunity to\n    select a replacement, the narrower reading could paralyze important\n    functions of the Federal Government, particularly at the time of the\n    founding. The broader interpretation ensures that offices needing to\n    be filled can be filled. It does raise a danger that the President may\n    attempt to use the recess-appointment power to circumvent the Sen-\n    ate\u2019s advice and consent role. But the narrower interpretation risks\n    undermining constitutionally conferred powers more seriously and\n    more often. It would prevent a President from making any recess\n    appointment to fill a vacancy that arose before a recess, no matter\n    who the official, how dire the need, how uncontroversial the appoint-\n    ment, and how late in the session the office fell vacant.\n       Historical practice also strongly favors the broader interpretation.\n    The tradition of applying the Clause to pre-recess vacancies dates at\n    least to President Madison. Nearly every Attorney General to con-\n    sider the question has approved the practice, and every President\n    since James Buchanan has made recess appointments to pre-existing\n    vacancies. It is a fair inference from the historical data that a large\n    proportion of recess appointments over our Nation\u2019s history have\n    filled pre-recess vacancies. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1863\n    did issue a report disagreeing with the broader interpretation, and\n    Congress passed a law known as the Pay Act prohibiting payment of\n    recess appointments to pre-recess vacancies soon after. However, the\n    Senate subsequently abandoned its hostility. In 1940, the Senate\n    amended the Pay Act to permit payment of recess appointees in cir-\n    cumstances that would be unconstitutional under the narrower in-\n    terpretation. In short, Presidents have made recess appointments to\n    preexisting vacancies for two centuries, and the Senate as a body has\n    not countered this practice for nearly three-quarters of a century,\n    perhaps longer. The Court is reluctant to upset this traditional prac-\n    tice where doing so would seriously shrink the authority that Presi-\n    dents have believed existed and have exercised for so long. Pp. 21\u2013\n    33.\n       2. For purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is\n    in session when it says that it is, provided that, under its own rules,\n    it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.\n       This standard is consistent with the Constitution\u2019s broad delega-\n    tion of authority to the Senate to determine how and when to conduct\n    its business, as recognized by this Court\u2019s precedents. See Art. I, \u00a75,\n    cl. 2; Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 672; United States\n    v. Ballin, 144 U. S. 1, 5, 9. Although the Senate\u2019s own determination\n    of when it is and is not in session should be given great weight, the\n    Court\u2019s deference cannot be absolute. When the Senate is without\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

It said it was in session, and\n  Senate rules make clear that the Senate retained the power to con-\n  duct business. The Senate could have conducted business simply by\n  passing a unanimous consent agreement. In fact, it did so; it passed\n  a bill by unanimous consent during its pro forma session on Decem-\n  ber 23, 2011. See 2011 S. J. 924; Pub. L. 112\u201378. The Court will not,\n  as the Solicitor General urges, engage in an in-depth factual apprais-\n  al of what the Senate actually did during its pro forma sessions in or-\n  der to determine whether it was in recess or in session for purposes of\n  the Recess Appointments Clause.\n    Because the Senate was in session during its pro forma sessions,\n  the President made the recess appointments at issue during a 3-day\n  recess. Three days is too short a time to bring a recess within the\n  scope of the Clause, so the President lacked the authority to make\n  those appointments.

S. Const., Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. But the\nRecess Appointments Clause creates an exception. It\ngives the President alone the power \u201cto fill up all Vacan\u00ad\ncies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by\ngranting Commissions which shall expire at the End of\ntheir next Session.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 3. We here consider\nthree questions about the application of this Clause.\n  The first concerns the scope of the words \u201crecess of the\nSenate.\u201d Does that phrase refer only to an inter-session\nrecess (i.e., a break between formal sessions of Congress),\nor does it also include an intra-session recess, such as a\nsummer recess in the midst of a session? We conclude\nthat the Clause applies to both kinds of recess.\n  The second question concerns the scope of the words\n\u201cvacancies that may happen.\u201d Does that phrase refer only\nto vacancies that first come into existence during a recess,\nor does it also include vacancies that arise prior to a recess\nbut continue to exist during the recess? We conclude that\n2                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nthe Clause applies to both kinds of vacancy.\n  The third question concerns calculation of the length of\na \u201crecess.\u201d The President made the appointments here at\nissue on January 4, 2012. At that time the Senate was in\nrecess pursuant to a December 17, 2011, resolution provid\u00ad\ning for a series of brief recesses punctuated by \u201cpro forma\nsession[s],\u201d with \u201cno business . . . transacted,\u201d every Tues\u00ad\nday and Friday through January 20, 2012. S. J., 112th\nCong., 1st Sess., 923 (2011) (hereinafter 2011 S. J.). In\ncalculating the length of a recess are we to ignore the pro\nforma sessions, thereby treating the series of brief recesses\nas a single, month-long recess? We conclude that we\ncannot ignore these pro forma sessions.\n  Our answer to the third question means that, when the\nappointments before us took place, the Senate was in the\nmidst of a 3-day recess. Three days is too short a time to\nbring a recess within the scope of the Clause. Thus we\nconclude that the President lacked the power to make the\nrecess appointments here at issue.\n                             I\n  The case before us arises out of a labor dispute. The\nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found that a\nPepsi-Cola distributor, Noel Canning, had unlawfully\nrefused to reduce to writing and execute a collective\u00ad\nbargaining agreement with a labor union. The Board\nordered the distributor to execute the agreement and to\nmake employees whole for any losses. Noel Canning, 358\nN. L. R. B. No. 4 (2012).\n  The Pepsi-Cola distributor subsequently asked the\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to set\nthe Board\u2019s order aside. It claimed that three of the five\nBoard members had been invalidly appointed, leaving the\nBoard without the three lawfully appointed members\nnecessary for it to act. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7160(f) (providing\nfor judicial review); \u00a7153(a) (providing for a 5-member\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nBoard); \u00a7153(b) (providing for a 3-member quorum); New\nProcess Steel, L. P. v. NLRB, 560 U. S. 674, 687\u2013688\n(2010) (in the absence of a lawfully appointed quorum, the\nBoard cannot exercise its powers).\n  The three members in question were Sharon Block,\nRichard Griffin, and Terence Flynn. In 2011 the President\nhad nominated each of them to the Board. As of January\n2012, Flynn\u2019s nomination had been pending in the Senate\nawaiting confirmation for approximately a year. The\nnominations of each of the other two had been pending for\na few weeks. On January 4, 2012, the President, invoking\nthe Recess Appointments Clause, appointed all three to\nthe Board.\n  The distributor argued that the Recess Appointments\nClause did not authorize those appointments. It pointed\nout that on December 17, 2011, the Senate, by unanimous\nconsent, had adopted a resolution providing that it would\ntake a series of brief recesses beginning the following day.\nSee 2011 S. J. 923. Pursuant to that resolution, the Sen\u00ad\nate held pro forma sessions every Tuesday and Friday\nuntil it returned for ordinary business on January 23,\n2012. Ibid.; 158 Cong. Rec. S1\u2013S11 (Jan. 3\u201320, 2012). The\nPresident\u2019s January 4 appointments were made between\nthe January 3 and January 6 pro forma sessions. In the\ndistributor\u2019s view, each pro forma session terminated the\nimmediately preceding recess. Accordingly, the appoint\u00ad\nments were made during a 3-day adjournment, which is\nnot long enough to trigger the Recess Appointments\nClause.\n  The Court of Appeals agreed that the appointments fell\noutside the scope of the Clause. But the court set forth\ndifferent reasons. It held that the Clause\u2019s words \u201cthe\nrecess of the Senate\u201d do not include recesses that occur\nwithin a formal session of Congress, i.e., intra-session\nrecesses. Rather those words apply only to recesses be-\ntween those formal sessions, i.e., inter-session recesses.\n4                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nSince the second session of the 112th Congress began on\nJanuary 3, 2012, the day before the President\u2019s appoint\u00ad\nments, those appointments occurred during an intra\u00ad\nsession recess, and the appointments consequently fell\noutside the scope of the Clause. 705 F. 3d 490, 499\u2013507\n(CADC 2013).\n   The Court of Appeals added that, in any event, the\nphrase \u201cvacancies that may happen during the recess\u201d\napplies only to vacancies that come into existence during a\nrecess. Id., at 507\u2013512. The vacancies that Members\nBlock, Griffin, and Flynn were appointed to fill had arisen\nbefore the beginning of the recess during which they were\nappointed. For this reason too the President\u2019s appoint\u00ad\nments were invalid. And, because the Board lacked a\nquorum of validly appointed members when it issued its\norder, the order was invalid. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7153(b); New\nProcess Steel, supra.\n   We granted the Solicitor General\u2019s petition for certio\u00ad\nrari. We asked the parties to address not only the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 interpretation of the Clause but also the distribu\u00ad\ntor\u2019s initial argument, namely, \u201c[w]hether the President\u2019s\nrecess-appointment power may be exercised when the\nSenate is convening every three days in pro forma ses\u00ad\nsions.\u201d 570 U. S. ___ (2013).\n   We shall answer all three questions presented. We\nrecognize that the President has nominated others to fill\nthe positions once occupied by Members Block, Griffin,\nand Flynn, and that the Senate has confirmed these suc\u00ad\ncessors. But, as the parties recognize, the fact that the\nBoard now unquestionably has a quorum does not moot\nthe controversy about the validity of the previously en\u00ad\ntered Board order. And there are pending before us peti\u00ad\ntions from decisions in other cases involving challenges to\nthe appointment of Board Member Craig Becker. The\nPresident appointed Member Becker during an intra\u00ad\nsession recess that was not punctuated by pro forma ses\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

See Congressional Research\nService, H. Hogue, M. Carey, M. Greene, & M. Bearden,\nThe Noel Canning Decision and Recess Appointments\nMade from 1981\u20132013, p. 28 (Feb. 4, 2013) (hereinaf\u00ad\nter The Noel Canning Decision); NLRB, Members of\nthe NLRB since 1935, online at http://www.nlrb.gov/\nwho-we-are/board/members-nlrb-1935 (all Internet mate\u00ad\nrials as visited June 24, 2014, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file). Other cases involving similar challenges\nare also pending in the Courts of Appeals. E.g., NLRB v.\nNew Vista Nursing & Rehabilitation, No. 11\u20133440 etc.\n(CA3). Thus, we believe it is important to answer all three\nquestions that this case presents.\n                             II\n  Before turning to the specific questions presented, we\nshall mention two background considerations that we find\nrelevant to all three. First, the Recess Appointments\nClause sets forth a subsidiary, not a primary, method for\nappointing officers of the United States. The immediately\npreceding Clause\u2014Article II, Section 2, Clause 2\u2014\nprovides the primary method of appointment. It says that\nthe President \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice\nand Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors,\nother public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme\nCourt, and all other Officers of the United States\u201d (empha\u00ad\nsis added).\n  The Federalist Papers make clear that the Founders\nintended this method of appointment, requiring Senate\napproval, to be the norm (at least for principal officers).\nAlexander Hamilton wrote that the Constitution vests the\npower of nomination in the President alone because \u201cone\nman of discernment is better fitted to analise and estimate\nthe peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices, than a\nbody of men of equal, or perhaps even of superior discern\u00ad\n6                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nment.\u201d The Federalist No. 76, p. 510 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).\nAt the same time, the need to secure Senate approval\nprovides \u201can excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in\nthe President, and would tend greatly to preventing the\nappointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from\nfamily connection, from personal attachment, or from a\nview to popularity.\u201d Id., at 513. Hamilton further ex\u00ad\nplained that the\n    \u201cordinary power of appointment is confided to the\n    President and Senate jointly, and can therefore only\n    be exercised during the session of the Senate; but as it\n    would have been improper to oblige this body to be\n    continually in session for the appointment of officers;\n    and as vacancies might happen in their recess, which\n    it might be necessary for the public service to fill\n    without delay, the succeeding clause is evidently in\u00ad\n    tended to authorise the President singly to make tem\u00ad\n    porary appointments.\u201d Id., No. 67, at 455.\n   Thus the Recess Appointments Clause reflects the ten\u00ad\nsion between, on the one hand, the President\u2019s continuous\nneed for \u201cthe assistance of subordinates,\u201d Myers v. United\nStates, 272 U. S. 52, 117 (1926), and, on the other, the\nSenate\u2019s practice, particularly during the Republic\u2019s early\nyears, of meeting for a single brief session each year, see\nArt. I, \u00a74, cl. 2; Amdt. 20, \u00a72 (requiring the Senate to\n\u201cassemble\u201d only \u201conce in every year\u201d); 3 J. Story, Commen\u00ad\ntaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71551, p.\n410 (1833) (it would be \u201cburthensome to the senate, and\nexpensive to the public\u201d to require the Senate to be \u201cper\u00ad\npetually in session\u201d). We seek to interpret the Clause as\ngranting the President the power to make appointments\nduring a recess but not offering the President the author\u00ad\nity routinely to avoid the need for Senate confirmation.\n   Second, in interpreting the Clause, we put significant\nweight upon historical practice. For one thing, the inter\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

S. 655, 689 (1929); see also\nid., at 690 (\u201c[A] practice of at least twenty years duration\n\u2018on the part of the executive department, acquiesced in by\nthe legislative department, . . . is entitled to great regard\nin determining the true construction of a constitutional\nprovision the phraseology of which is in any respect of\ndoubtful meaning\u2019 \u201d (quoting State v.

City of\nNew York, 524 U.

Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n177 (1803). But it is equally true that the longstanding\n\u201cpractice of the government,\u201d McCulloch, supra, at 401,\ncan inform our determination of \u201cwhat the law is,\u201d Mar-\nbury, supra, at 177.\n   That principle is neither new nor controversial. As\n8                    NLRB v.

And our cases have continually confirmed\nMadison\u2019s view. E.g., Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.\n361, 401 (1989); Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.

We have not previously interpreted the Clause,\nand, when doing so for the first time in more than 200\nyears, we must hesitate to upset the compromises and\nworking arrangements that the elected branches of Gov\u00ad\nernment themselves have reached.\n                               III\n   The first question concerns the scope of the phrase \u201cthe\nrecess of the Senate.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 3 (emphasis added).\nThe Constitution provides for congressional elections\nevery two years. And the 2-year life of each elected Con\u00ad\ngress typically consists of two formal 1-year sessions, each\nseparated from the next by an \u201cinter-session recess.\u201d\nCongressional Research Service, H. Hogue, Recess Ap\u00ad\npointments: Frequently Asked Questions 2 (2013). The\nSenate or the House of Representatives announces an\ninter-session recess by approving a resolution stating that\nit will \u201cadjourn sine die,\u201d i.e., without specifying a date to\nreturn (in which case Congress will reconvene when the\nnext formal session is scheduled to begin).\n   The Senate and the House also take breaks in the midst\nof a session. The Senate or the House announces any such\n\u201cintra-session recess\u201d by adopting a resolution stating that\nit will \u201cadjourn\u201d to a fixed date, a few days or weeks or\neven months later. All agree that the phrase \u201cthe recess of\nthe Senate\u201d covers inter-session recesses. The question is\nwhether it includes intra-session recesses as well.\n   In our view, the phrase \u201cthe recess\u201d includes an intra\u00ad\nsession recess of substantial length. Its words taken\nliterally can refer to both types of recess. Founding-era\ndictionaries define the word \u201crecess,\u201d much as we do today,\nsimply as \u201ca period of cessation from usual work.\u201d 13 The\nOxford English Dictionary 322\u2013323 (2d ed. 1989) (herein\u00ad\nafter OED) (citing 18th- and 19th-century sources for that\n10                    NLRB v.

Webster, An American Diction\u00ad\nary of the English Language (1828) (\u201c[r]emission or sus\u00ad\npension of business or procedure\u201d); 2 S. Johnson, A Dic\u00ad\ntionary of the English Language 1602\u20131603 (4th ed. 1773)\n(hereinafter Johnson) (same). The Founders themselves\nused the word to refer to intra-session, as well as to inter\u00ad\nsession, breaks. See, e.g., 3 Records of the Federal Con\u00ad\nvention of 1787, p. 76 (M. Farrand rev. 1966) (hereinafter\nFarrand) (letter from George Washington to John Jay\nusing \u201cthe recess\u201d to refer to an intra-session break of the\nConstitutional Convention); id., at 191 (speech of Luther\nMartin with a similar usage); 1 T. Jefferson, A Manual\nof Parliamentary Practice \u00a7LI, p. 165 (2d ed. 1812) (de\u00ad\nscribing a \u201crecess by adjournment\u201d which did not end a\nsession).\n   We recognize that the word \u201cthe\u201d in \u201cthe recess\u201d might\nsuggest that the phrase refers to the single break separat\u00ad\ning formal sessions of Congress. That is because the word\n\u201cthe\u201d frequently (but not always) indicates \u201ca particular\nthing.\u201d 2 Johnson 2003. But the word can also refer \u201cto a\nterm used generically or universally.\u201d 17 OED 879. The\nConstitution, for example, directs the Senate to choose a\nPresident pro tempore \u201cin the Absence of the Vice-\nPresident.\u201d Art. I, \u00a73, cl. 5 (emphasis added). And the\nFederalist Papers refer to the chief magistrate of an an\u00ad\ncient Achaean league who \u201cadministered the government\nin the recess of the Senate.\u201d The Federalist No. 18, at 113\n(J. Madison) (emphasis added). Reading \u201cthe\u201d generically\nin this way, there is no linguistic problem applying the\nClause\u2019s phrase to both kinds of recess. And, in fact, the\nphrase \u201cthe recess\u201d was used to refer to intra-session\nrecesses at the time of the founding. See, e.g., 3 Farrand\n76 (letter from Washington to Jay); New Jersey Legislative-\nCouncil Journal, 5th Sess., 1st Sitting 70, 2d Sitting 9\n(1781) (twice referring to a 4-month, intra-session break\nas \u201cthe Recess\u201d); see also Brief for Petitioner 14\u201316 (listing\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

And we\nbelieve the Clause\u2019s purpose demands the broader inter\u00ad\npretation. The Clause gives the President authority to\nmake appointments during \u201cthe recess of the Senate\u201d so\nthat the President can ensure the continued functioning of\nthe Federal Government when the Senate is away. The\nSenate is equally away during both an inter-session and\nan intra-session recess, and its capacity to participate in\nthe appointments process has nothing to do with the\nwords it uses to signal its departure.\n   History also offers strong support for the broad interpre\u00ad\ntation. We concede that pre-Civil War history is not help\u00ad\nful. But it shows only that Congress generally took long\nbreaks between sessions, while taking no significant intra\u00ad\nsession breaks at all (five times it took a break of a week\nor so at Christmas). See Appendix A, infra. Obviously, if\nthere are no significant intra-session recesses, there will\nbe no intra-session recess appointments. In 1867 and\n1868, Congress for the first time took substantial, non\u00ad\nholiday intra-session breaks, and President Andrew John\u00ad\nson made dozens of recess appointments. The Federal\nCourt of Claims upheld one of those specific appointments,\nwriting \u201c[w]e have no doubt that a vacancy occurring while\nthe Senate was thus temporarily adjourned\u201d during the\n\u201cfirst session of the Fortieth Congress\u201d was \u201clegally filled\nby appointment of the President alone.\u201d Gould v.

See 12 Op. Atty. Gen. 449 (1868);\n12 Op. Atty. Gen. 455 (1868); 12 Op. Atty. Gen. 469 (1868).\nSimilarly, though the 40th Congress impeached President\nJohnson on charges relating to his appointment power, he\n12                    NLRB v.

Hartnett, Recess\nAppointments of Article III Judges: Three Constitutional\nQuestions, 26 Cardozo L. Rev. 377, 409 (2005).\n   In all, between the founding and the Great Depression,\nCongress took substantial intra-session breaks (other than\nholiday breaks) in four years: 1867, 1868, 1921, and 1929.\nAppendix A, infra. And in each of those years the Presi\u00ad\ndent made intra-session recess appointments. See App. to\nBrief for Petitioner 1a\u201311a.\n   Since 1929, and particularly since the end of World War\nII, Congress has shortened its inter-session breaks as it\nhas taken longer and more frequent intra-session breaks;\nPresidents have correspondingly made more intra-session\nrecess appointments. Indeed, if we include military ap\u00ad\npointments, Presidents have made thousands of intra\u00ad\nsession recess appointments. Id., at 11a\u201364a. President\nFranklin Roosevelt, for example, commissioned Dwight\nEisenhower as a permanent Major General during an\nintra-session recess; President Truman made Dean Ache\u00ad\nson Under Secretary of State; and President George H. W.\nBush reappointed Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the\nFederal Reserve Board. Id., at 11a, 12a, 40a. JUSTICE\nSCALIA does not dispute any of these facts.\n   Not surprisingly, the publicly available opinions of\nPresidential legal advisers that we have found are nearly\nunanimous in determining that the Clause authorizes\nthese appointments. In 1921, for example, Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral Daugherty advised President Harding that he could\nmake intra-session recess appointments. He reasoned:\n     \u201cIf the President\u2019s power of appointment is to be de\u00ad\n     feated because the Senate takes an adjournment to a\n     specified date, the painful and inevitable result will be\n     measurably to prevent the exercise of governmental\n     functions.

Gen. 463,\n466 (1960).\n  We must note one contrary opinion authored by Presi\u00ad\ndent Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Attorney General Philander\nKnox. Knox advised the President that the Clause did not\ncover a 19\u2013day intra-session Christmas recess. 23 Op.\nAtty. Gen. 599 (1901). But in doing so he relied heavily\nupon the use of the word \u201cthe,\u201d a linguistic point that we\ndo not find determinative. See supra, at 10. And Knox all\nbut confessed that his interpretation ran contrary to the\nbasic purpose of the Clause. For it would permit the\nSenate to adjourn for \u201cseveral months,\u201d to a fixed date,\nand thereby \u201cseriously curtail the President\u2019s power of\nmaking recess appointments.\u201d 23 Op. Atty. Gen., at 603.\nMoreover, only three days before Knox gave his opinion,\nthe Solicitor of the Treasury came to the opposite conclu\u00ad\nsion. Reply Brief 7, n. 5. We therefore do not think Knox\u2019s\nisolated opinion can disturb the consensus advice within\nthe Executive Branch taking the opposite position.\n  What about the Senate? Since Presidents began making\nintra-session recess appointments, individual Senators\nhave taken differing views about the proper definition of\n\u201cthe recess.\u201d See, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec. 23234 (1984) (reso\u00ad\nlution introduced by Senator Byrd urging limits on the\nlength of applicable intra-session recesses); Brief for Sen.\nMitch McConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 26 (an intra\u00ad\n14                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nsession adjournment does not count as \u201cthe recess\u201d); Brief\nfor Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as Amicus Curiae in Frank-\nlin v. United States, O. T. 2004, No. 04\u20135858, p. 5 (same).\nBut neither the Senate considered as a body nor its com\u00ad\nmittees, despite opportunities to express opposition to the\npractice of intra-session recess appointments, has done so.\nRather, to the extent that the Senate or a Senate commit\u00ad\ntee has expressed a view, that view has favored a func\u00ad\ntional definition of \u201crecess,\u201d and a functional definition\nencompasses intra-session recesses.\n   Most notably, in 1905 the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary objected strongly to President Theodore Roose\u00ad\nvelt\u2019s use of the Clause to make more than 160 recess\nappointments during a \u201cfictitious\u201d inter-session recess.\nS. Rep. No. 4389, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 2 (hereinafter\n1905 Senate Report). At noon on December 7, 1903, the\nSenate President pro tempore had \u201cdeclare[d]\u201d a formal,\n\u201cextraordinary session\u201d of the Senate \u201cadjourned without\nday,\u201d and the next formal Senate session began immedi\u00ad\nately afterwards. 37 Cong. Rec. 544 (1903). President\nRoosevelt made over 160 recess appointments during the\ninstantaneous inter-session interval. The Judiciary Com\u00ad\nmittee, when stating its strong objection, defined \u201crecess\u201d\nin functional terms as\n     \u201cthe period of time when the Senate is not sitting in\n     regular or extraordinary session as a branch of the\n     Congress . . . ; when its members owe no duty of at\u00ad\n     tendance; when its Chamber is empty; when, because\n     of its absence, it can not receive communications from\n     the President or participate as a body in making ap\u00ad\n     pointments.\u201d 1905 Senate Report, at 2 (emphasis\n     deleted).\nThat functional definition encompasses intra-session, as\nwell as inter-session, recesses. JUSTICE SCALIA is right\nthat the 1905 Report did not specifically address the dis\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntinction between inter-session and intra-session recesses.\nBut the animating principle of the Report\u2014that \u201crecess\u201d\nshould be practically construed to mean a time when the\nSenate is unavailable to participate in the appointments\nprocess\u2014is inconsistent with the formalistic approach that\nJUSTICE SCALIA endorses.\n   Similarly, in 1940 the Senate helped to enact a law\nregulating the payment of recess appointees, and the\nComptroller General of the United States has interpreted\nthat law functionally. An earlier 1863 statute had denied\npay to individuals appointed to fill up vacancies first\narising prior to the beginning of a recess. The Senate\nJudiciary Committee then believed that those vacancies\nfell outside the scope of the Clause. See infra, at 30. In\n1940, however, the Senate amended the law to permit\nmany of those recess appointees to be paid. Act of July 11,\n54 Stat. 751. Interpreting the amendments in 1948, the\nComptroller General\u2014who, unlike the Attorney General,\nis an \u201cofficer of the Legislative Branch,\u201d Bowsher v. Synar,\n478 U. S. 714, 731 (1986)\u2014wrote:\n    \u201cI think it is clear that [the Pay Act amendments\u2019]\n    primary purpose was to relieve \u2018recess appointees\u2019 of\n    the burden of serving without compensation during\n    periods when the Senate is not actually sitting and is\n    not available to give its advice and consent in respect\n    to the appointment, irrespective of whether the recess\n    of the Senate is attributable to a final adjournment\n    sine die or to an adjournment to a specified date.\u201d 28\n    Comp. Gen. 30, 37.\n  We recognize that the Senate cannot easily register\nopposition as a body to every governmental action that\nmany, perhaps most, Senators oppose. But the Senate has\nnot been silent or passive regarding the meaning of the\nClause: A Senate Committee did register opposition to\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s use of the Clause, and the\n16                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nSenate as a whole has legislated in an effort to discourage\ncertain kinds of recess appointments. And yet we are not\naware of any formal action it has taken to call into ques\u00ad\ntion the broad and functional definition of \u201crecess\u201d first\nset out in the 1905 Senate Report and followed by the\nExecutive Branch since at least 1921. Nor has JUSTICE\nSCALIA identified any. All the while, the President has\nmade countless recess appointments during intra-session\nrecesses.\n   The upshot is that restricting the Clause to inter-session\nrecesses would frustrate its purpose. It would make the\nPresident\u2019s recess-appointment power dependent on a\nformalistic distinction of Senate procedure. Moreover, the\nPresident has consistently and frequently interpreted the\nword \u201crecess\u201d to apply to intra-session recesses, and has\nacted on that interpretation. The Senate as a body has\ndone nothing to deny the validity of this practice for at\nleast three-quarters of a century. And three-quarters of a\ncentury of settled practice is long enough to entitle a\npractice to \u201cgreat weight in a proper interpretation\u201d of the\nconstitutional provision. The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S.,\nat 689.\n   We are aware of, but we are not persuaded by, three\nimportant arguments to the contrary. First, some argue\nthat the Founders would likely have intended the Clause\nto apply only to inter-session recesses, for they hardly\nknew any other. See, e.g., Brief for Originalist Scholars as\nAmici Curiae 27\u201329. Indeed, from the founding until the\nCivil War inter-session recesses were the only kind of\nsignificant recesses that Congress took. The problem with\nthis argument, however, is that it does not fully describe\nthe relevant founding intent. The question is not: Did the\nFounders at the time think about intra-session recesses?\nPerhaps they did not. The question is: Did the Founders\nintend to restrict the scope of the Clause to the form of\ncongressional recess then prevalent, or did they intend a\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nbroader scope permitting the Clause to apply, where ap\u00ad\npropriate, to somewhat changed circumstances? The\nFounders knew they were writing a document designed to\napply to ever-changing circumstances over centuries.\nAfter all, a Constitution is \u201cintended to endure for ages to\ncome,\u201d and must adapt itself to a future that can only be\n\u201cseen dimly,\u201d if at all. McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415. We\ntherefore think the Framers likely did intend the Clause\nto apply to a new circumstance that so clearly falls within\nits essential purposes, where doing so is consistent with\nthe Clause\u2019s language.\n   Second, some argue that the intra-session interpretation\npermits the President to make \u201cillogic[ally]\u201d long recess\nappointments. Brief for Respondent Noel Canning 13;\npost, at 10 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). A recess\nappointment made between Congress\u2019 annual sessions\nwould permit the appointee to serve for about a year, i.e.,\nuntil the \u201cend\u201d of the \u201cnext\u201d Senate \u201csession.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72,\ncl. 3. But an intra-session appointment made at the be\u00ad\nginning or in the middle of a formal session could permit\nthe appointee to serve for 1\u00bd or almost 2 years (until the\nend of the following formal session).\n   We agree that the intra-session interpretation permits\nsomewhat longer recess appointments, but we do not agree\nthat this consequence is \u201cillogical.\u201d A President who\nmakes a recess appointment will often also seek to make a\nregular appointment, nominating the appointee and secur\u00ad\ning ordinary Senate confirmation. And the Clause ensures\nthat the President and Senate always have at least a full\nsession to go through the nomination and confirmation\nprocess. That process may take several months. See\nO\u2019Connell, Vacant Offices: Delays in Staffing Top Agency\nPositions, 82 S. Cal. L. Rev. 913, 967 (2009) (from 1987 to\n2005 the nomination and confirmation process took an\naverage of 236 days for noncabinet agency heads).

CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nyear will ensure the President the continued assistance of\nsubordinates that the Clause permits him to obtain while\nhe and the Senate select a regular appointee. An ap\u00ad\npointment should last until the Senate has \u201can opportu\u00ad\nnity to act on the subject,\u201d Story, \u00a71551, at 410, and the\nClause embodies a determination that a full session is\nneeded to select and vet a replacement.\n  Third, the Court of Appeals believed that application of\nthe Clause to intra-session recesses would introduce\n\u201cvagueness\u201d into a Clause that was otherwise clear. 705\nF. 3d, at 504. One can find problems of uncertainty, how\u00ad\never, either way. In 1867, for example, President Andrew\nJohnson called a special session of Congress, which took\nplace during a lengthy intra-session recess. Consider the\nperiod of time that fell just after the conclusion of that\nspecial session. Did that period remain an intra-session\nrecess, or did it become an inter-session recess? Histori\u00ad\nans disagree about the answer. Compare Hartnett, 26\nCardozo L. Rev., at 408\u2013409, with Brief for Constitutional\nLaw Scholars as Amici Curiae 23\u201324.\n  Or suppose that Congress adjourns sine die, but it does\nso conditionally, so that the leadership can call the mem\u00ad\nbers back into session when \u201cthe public interest shall\nwarrant it.\u201d E.g., 155 Cong. Rec. 33429 (2009); 152 Cong.\nRec. 23731\u201323732 (2006); 150 Cong. Rec. 25925\u201325926\n(2004). If the Senate Majority Leader were to reconvene\nthe Senate, how would we characterize the preceding\nrecess? Is it still inter-session? On the narrower interpre\u00ad\ntation the label matters; on the broader it does not.\n  The greater interpretive problem is determining how\nlong a recess must be in order to fall within the Clause. Is\na break of a week, or a day, or an hour too short to count\nas a \u201crecess\u201d? The Clause itself does not say. And\nJUSTICE SCALIA claims that this silence itself shows that\nthe Framers intended the Clause to apply only to an inter\u00ad\nsession recess. Post, at 12\u201313.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          19\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\n  We disagree. For one thing, the most likely reason the\nFramers did not place a textual floor underneath the word\n\u201crecess\u201d is that they did not foresee the need for one. They\nmight have expected that the Senate would meet for a\nsingle session lasting at most half a year. The Federalist\nNo. 84, at 596 (A. Hamilton). And they might not have\nanticipated that intra-session recesses would become\nlengthier and more significant than inter-session ones.\nThe Framers\u2019 lack of clairvoyance on that point is not\ndispositive. Unlike JUSTICE SCALIA, we think it most\nconsistent with our constitutional structure to presume\nthat the Framers would have allowed intra-session recess\nappointments where there was a long history of such\npractice.\n  Moreover, the lack of a textual floor raises a problem\nthat plagues both interpretations\u2014JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s and\nours. Today a brief inter-session recess is just as possible\nas a brief intra-session recess. And though JUSTICE\nSCALIA says that the \u201cnotion that the Constitution em\u00ad\npowers the President to make unilateral appointments\nevery time the Senate takes a half-hour lunch break is so\nabsurd as to be self-refuting,\u201d he must immediately con\u00ad\ncede (in a footnote) that the President \u201ccan make recess\nappointments during any break between sessions, no\nmatter how short.\u201d Post, at 11, 15, n. 4 (emphasis added).\n  Even the Solicitor General, arguing for a broader inter\u00ad\npretation, acknowledges that there is a lower limit appli\u00ad\ncable to both kinds of recess. He argues that the lower\nlimit should be three days by analogy to the Adjournments\nClause of the Constitution. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. That\nClause says: \u201cNeither House, during the Session of Con\u00ad\ngress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for\nmore than three days.\u201d Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 4.\n  We agree with the Solicitor General that a 3-day recess\nwould be too short.

Frumin, Riddick\u2019s Senate Procedure:\nPrecedents and Practices 1265 (hereinafter Riddick\u2019s).)\nThe Adjournments Clause reflects the fact that a 3-day\nbreak is not a significant interruption of legislative busi\u00ad\nness. As the Solicitor General says, it is constitutionally\nde minimis. Brief for Petitioner 18. A Senate recess that\nis so short that it does not require the consent of the\nHouse is not long enough to trigger the President\u2019s recess\u00ad\nappointment power.\n   That is not to say that the President may make recess\nappointments during any recess that is \u201cmore than three\ndays.\u201d Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 4. The Recess Appointments Clause\nseeks to permit the Executive Branch to function smoothly\nwhen Congress is unavailable. And though Congress has\ntaken short breaks for almost 200 years, and there have\nbeen many thousands of recess appointments in that time,\nwe have not found a single example of a recess ap\u00ad\npointment made during an intra-session recess that was\nshorter than 10 days. Nor has the Solicitor General. Reply\nBrief 23. Indeed, the Office of Legal Counsel once infor\u00ad\nmally advised against making a recess appointment dur\u00ad\ning a 6-day intra-session recess. 3 Op. OLC, at 315\u2013316.\nThe lack of examples suggests that the recess\u00ad\nappointment power is not needed in that context. (The\nlength of a recess is \u201cordinarily calculated by counting the\ncalendar days running from the day after the recess begins\nand including the day the recess ends.\u201d 36 Op. OLC, at\n___, n. 1 (citation omitted).)\n   There are a few historical examples of recess appoint\u00ad\nments made during inter-session recesses shorter than 10\ndays. We have already discussed President Theodore\nRoosevelt\u2019s appointments during the instantaneous, \u201cficti\u00ad\ntious\u201d recess. President Truman also made a recess ap\u00ad\npointment to the Civil Aeronautics Board during a 3-day\ninter-session recess. Hogue, Recess Appointments: Fre\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

President Taft made a\nfew appointments during a 9-day recess following his\ninauguration, and President Lyndon Johnson made sev-\neral appointments during an 8-day recess several weeks\nafter assuming office.

There may be others of which we are unaware.\nBut when considered against 200 years of settled practice,\nwe regard these few scattered examples as anomalies. We\ntherefore conclude, in light of historical practice, that a\nrecess of more than 3 days but less than 10 days is pre-\nsumptively too short to fall within the Clause. We add the\nword \u201cpresumptively\u201d to leave open the possibility that\nsome very unusual circumstance\u2014a national catastrophe,\nfor instance, that renders the Senate unavailable but calls\nfor an urgent response\u2014could demand the exercise of the\nrecess-appointment power during a shorter break. (It\nshould go without saying\u2014except that JUSTICE SCALIA\ncompels us to say it\u2014that political opposition in the Sen-\nate would not qualify as an unusual circumstance.)\n  In sum, we conclude that the phrase \u201cthe recess\u201d applies\nto both intra-session and inter-session recesses. If a Sen-\nate recess is so short that it does not require the consent of\nthe House, it is too short to trigger the Recess Appoint-\nments Clause. See Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 4. And a recess lasting\nless than 10 days is presumptively too short as well.\n                              IV\n  The second question concerns the scope of the phrase\n\u201cvacancies that may happen during the recess of the Sen-\nate.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 3 (emphasis added). All agree that the\nphrase applies to vacancies that initially occur during a\nrecess. But does it also apply to vacancies that initially\noccur before a recess and continue to exist during the\nrecess? In our view the phrase applies to both kinds of\n22                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nvacancy.\n   We believe that the Clause\u2019s language, read literally,\npermits, though it does not naturally favor, our broader\ninterpretation. We concede that the most natural mean\u00ad\ning of \u201chappens\u201d as applied to a \u201cvacancy\u201d (at least to a\nmodern ear) is that the vacancy \u201chappens\u201d when it ini\u00ad\ntially occurs. See 1 Johnson 913 (defining \u201chappen\u201d in\nrelevant part as meaning \u201c[t]o fall out; to chance; to come\nto pass\u201d). But that is not the only possible way to use the\nword.\n   Thomas Jefferson wrote that the Clause is \u201ccertainly\nsusceptible of [two] constructions.\u201d Letter to Wilson Cary\nNicholas (Jan. 26, 1802), in 36 Papers of Thomas Jefferson\n433 (B. Oberg ed., 2009). It \u201cmay mean \u2018vacancies that\nmay happen to be\u2019 or \u2018may happen to fall\u2019 \u201d during a recess.\nIbid. Jefferson used the phrase in the first sense when he\nwrote to a job seeker that a particular position was una\u00ad\nvailable, but that he (Jefferson) was \u201chappy that another\nvacancy happens wherein I can . . . avail the public of your\nintegrity & talents,\u201d for \u201cthe office of Treasurer of the US.\nis vacant by the resignation of mr Meredith.\u201d Letter to\nThomas Tudor Tucker (Oct. 31, 1801), in 35 id., at 530 (B.\nOberg ed. 2008) (emphasis added).

The\nbroader interpretation, he added, is \u201cmost accordant with\u201d\nthe Constitution\u2019s \u201creason and spirit.\u201d Id., at 632.\n    We can still understand this earlier use of \u201chappen\u201d if\nwe think of it used together with another word that, like\n\u201cvacancy,\u201d can refer to a continuing state, say, a financial\ncrisis. A statute that gives the President authority to act\nin respect to \u201cany financial crisis that may happen during\nhis term\u201d can easily be interpreted to include crises that\narise before, and continue during, that term. Perhaps that\nis why the Oxford English Dictionary defines \u201chappen\u201d in\npart as \u201cchance to be,\u201d rather than \u201cchance to occur.\u201d 6\nOED 1096 (emphasis added); see also 19 OED 383 (defin\u00ad\ning \u201cvacancy\u201d as the \u201ccondition of an office or post being\n. . . vacant\u201d).\n    In any event, the linguistic question here is not whether\nthe phrase can be, but whether it must be, read more\nnarrowly. The question is whether the Clause is ambigu\u00ad\nous. The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S., at 690. And the\nbroader reading, we believe, is at least a permissible\nreading of a \u201c \u2018doubtful\u2019 \u201d phrase. Ibid. We consequently go\non to consider the Clause\u2019s purpose and historical practice.\n    The Clause\u2019s purpose strongly supports the broader\ninterpretation. That purpose is to permit the President to\nobtain the assistance of subordinate officers when the\nSenate, due to its recess, cannot confirm them. Attorney\nGeneral Wirt clearly described how the narrower interpre\u00ad\ntation would undermine this purpose:\n    \u201cPut the case of a vacancy occurring in an office, held\n    in a distant part of the country, on the last day of the\n    Senate\u2019s session. Before the vacancy is made known\n    to the President, the Senate rises. The office may be\n    an important one; the vacancy may paralyze a whole\n    line of action in some essential branch of our internal\n    police; the public interests may imperiously demand\n24                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\n     that it shall be immediately filled. But the vacancy\n     happened to occur during the session of the Senate;\n     and if the President\u2019s power is to be limited to such\n     vacancies only as happen to occur during the recess of\n     the Senate, the vacancy in the case put must continue,\n     however ruinous the consequences may be to the pub\u00ad\n     lic.\u201d 1 Op. Atty. Gen., at 632.\nExamples are not difficult to imagine: An ambassadorial\npost falls vacant too soon before the recess begins for the\nPresident to appoint a replacement; the Senate rejects a\nPresident\u2019s nominee just before a recess, too late to select\nanother. Wirt explained that the \u201csubstantial purpose of\nthe constitution was to keep these offices filled,\u201d and \u201cif\nthe President shall not have the power to fill a vacancy\nthus circumstanced, . . . the substance of the constitution\nwill be sacrificed to a dubious construction of its letter.\u201d\nIbid. Thus the broader construction, encompassing vacan\u00ad\ncies that initially occur before the beginning of a recess, is\nthe \u201conly construction of the constitution which is compat\u00ad\nible with its spirit, reason, and purposes; while, at the\nsame time, it offers no violence to its language.\u201d Id., at\n633.\n  We do not agree with JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s suggestion that\nthe Framers would have accepted the catastrophe envi\u00ad\nsioned by Wirt because Congress can always provide for\nacting officers, see 5 U. S. C. \u00a73345, and the President can\nalways convene a special session of Congress, see U. S.\nConst., Art. II, \u00a73. Acting officers may have less authority\nthan Presidential appointments. 6 Op. OLC 119, 121\n(1982). Moreover, to rely on acting officers would lessen\nthe President\u2019s ability to staff the Executive Branch with\npeople of his own choosing, and thereby limit the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s control and political accountability. Cf. Free Enter-\nprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,\n561 U. S. 477, 497\u2013498 (2010). Special sessions are\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

The point of the Recess Appoint\u00ad\nments Clause was to avoid reliance on these inadequate\nexpedients.\n  At the same time, we recognize one important purpose\u00ad\nrelated consideration that argues in the opposite direction.\nA broad interpretation might permit a President to avoid\nSenate confirmations as a matter of course. If the Clause\ngives the President the power to \u201cfill up all vacancies\u201d that\noccur before, and continue to exist during, the Senate\u2019s\nrecess, a President might not submit any nominations to\nthe Senate. He might simply wait for a recess and then\nprovide all potential nominees with recess appointments.\nHe might thereby routinely avoid the constitutional need\nto obtain the Senate\u2019s \u201cadvice and consent.\u201d\n  Wirt thought considerations of character and politics\nwould prevent Presidents from abusing the Clause in this\nway. 1 Op. Atty. Gen., at 634. He might have added that\nsuch temptations should not often arise. It is often less\ndesirable for a President to make a recess appointment. A\nrecess appointee only serves a limited term. That, com\u00ad\nbined with the lack of Senate approval, may diminish the\nrecess appointee\u2019s ability, as a practical matter, to get a\ncontroversial job done. And even where the President and\nSenate are at odds over politically sensitive appointments,\ncompromise is normally possible. Indeed, the 1940 Pay\nAct amendments represent a general compromise, for they\nforesee payment of salaries to recess appointees where\nvacancies occur before the recess began but not too long\nbefore (namely, within 30 days before).           5 U. S. C.\n\u00a75503(a)(1); see infra, at 32. Moreover, the Senate, like\nthe President, has institutional \u201cresources,\u201d including\npolitical resources, \u201cavailable to protect and assert its\ninterests.\u201d Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U. S. 996, 1004 (1979)\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). In an unusual\ninstance, where a matter is important enough to the Sen\u00ad\n26                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nate, that body can remain in session, preventing recess\nappointments by refusing to take a recess. See Part V,\ninfra. In any event, the Executive Branch has adhered to\nthe broader interpretation for two centuries, and Senate\nconfirmation has always remained the norm for officers\nthat require it.\n   While we concede that both interpretations carry with\nthem some risk of undesirable consequences, we believe\nthe narrower interpretation risks undermining constitu-\ntionally conferred powers more seriously and more often.\nIt would prevent the President from making any recess\nappointment that arose before a recess, no matter who the\nofficial, no matter how dire the need, no matter how un-\ncontroversial the appointment, and no matter how late in\nthe session the office fell vacant. Overall, like Attorney\nGeneral Wirt, we believe the broader interpretation more\nconsistent with the Constitution\u2019s \u201creason and spirit.\u201d 1\nOp. Atty. Gen., at 632.\n   Historical practice over the past 200 years strongly\nfavors the broader interpretation. The tradition of apply-\ning the Clause to pre-recess vacancies dates at least to\nPresident James Madison. There is no undisputed record\nof Presidents George Washington, John Adams, or Thomas\nJefferson making such an appointment, though the Solici-\ntor General believes he has found records showing that\nPresidents Washington and Jefferson did so. We know\nthat Edmund Randolph, Washington\u2019s Attorney General,\nfavored a narrow reading of the Clause. Randolph be-\nlieved that the \u201cSpirit of the Constitution favors the par-\nticipation of the Senate in all appointments,\u201d though he\ndid not address\u2014let alone answer\u2014the powerful purpos-\nive and structural arguments subsequently made by At-\ntorney General Wirt. See Edmund Randolph\u2019s Opinion on\nRecess Appointments (July 7, 1792), in 24 Papers of\nThomas Jefferson 166 (J. Catanzariti ed. 1990).\n   President Adams seemed to endorse the broader view of\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           27\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nthe Clause in writing, though we are not aware of any\nappointments he made in keeping with that view. See\nLetter to J. McHenry (Apr. 16, 1799), in 8 Works of John\nAdams 632\u2013633 (C. Adams ed. 1853). His Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral, Charles Lee, later informed Jefferson that, in the\nAdams administration, \u201cwhenever an office became vacant\nso short a time before Congress rose, as not to give an\nopportunity of enquiring for a proper character, they let it\nlie always till recess.\u201d 36 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 433.\nWe know that President Jefferson thought that the broad\ninterpretation was linguistically supportable, though his\nactual practice is not clear. But the evidence suggests\nthat James Madison\u2014as familiar as anyone with the\nworkings of the Constitutional Convention\u2014appointed\nTheodore Gaillard to replace a district judge who had left\noffice before a recess began. Hartnett, 26 Cardozo L. Rev.,\nat 400\u2013401. It also appears that in 1815 Madison signed a\nbill that created two new offices prior to a recess which he\nthen filled later during the recess. See Act of Mar. 3, ch.\n95, 3 Stat. 235; S. J. 13th Cong., 3d Sess., 689\u2013690 (1815);\n3 S. Exec. J. 19 (1828) (for Monday, Jan. 8, 1816). He also\nmade recess appointments to \u201cterritorial\u201d United States\nattorney and marshal positions, both of which had been\ncreated when the Senate was in session more than two\nyears before. Act of Feb. 27, 1813, ch. 35, 2 Stat. 806; 3 S.\nExec. J. 19. JUSTICE SCALIA refers to \u201cwritten evidence of\nMadison\u2019s own beliefs,\u201d post, at 36, but in fact we have no\ndirect evidence of what President Madison believed. We\nonly know that he declined to make one appointment to a\npre-recess vacancy after his Secretary of War advised him\nthat he lacked the power. On the other hand, he did\napparently make at least five other appointments to pre\u00ad\nrecess vacancies, as JUSTICE SCALIA does not dispute.\n   The next President, James Monroe, received and pre\u00ad\nsumably acted upon Attorney General Wirt\u2019s advice,\nnamely that \u201call vacancies which, from any casualty,\n28                     NLRB v.

Atty. Gen., at 633. Nearly every\nsubsequent Attorney General to consider the question\nthroughout the Nation\u2019s history has thought the same.\nE.g., 2 Op. Atty. Gen. 525, 528 (1832); 7 Op. Atty. Gen.\n186, 223 (1855); 10 Op. Atty. Gen. 356, 356\u2013357 (1862); 12\nOp. Atty. Gen. 32, 33 (1866); 12 Op. Atty. Gen., at 452; 14\nOp. Atty. Gen. 562, 564 (1875); 15 Op. Atty.

OLC 124, 161 (1996); 36 Op.\nOLC ___ (2012). Indeed, as early as 1862, Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral Bates advised President Lincoln that his power to fill\npre-recess vacancies was \u201csettled . . . as far . . . as a consti\u00ad\ntutional question can be settled,\u201d 10 Op. Atty. Gen., at\n356, and a century later Acting Attorney General Walsh\ngave President Eisenhower the same advice \u201cwithout any\ndoubt,\u201d 41 Op. Atty. Gen., at 466.\n  This power is important. The Congressional Research\nService is \u201cunaware of any official source of information\ntracking the dates of vacancies in federal offices.\u201d The\nNoel Canning Decision 3, n. 6. Nonetheless, we have\nenough information to believe that the Presidents since\nMadison have made many recess appointments filling\nvacancies that initially occurred prior to a recess. As we\nhave just said, nearly every 19th- and 20th-century Attor\u00ad\nney General expressing a view on the matter has agreed\nwith William Wirt, and Presidents tend to follow the legal\nadvice of their chief legal officers. Moreover, the Solicitor\nGeneral has compiled a list of 102 (mostly uncontested)\nrecess appointments made by Presidents going back to the\nfounding. App. to Brief for Petitioner 65a\u201389a. Given the\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          29\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\ndifficulty of finding accurate information about vacancy\ndates, that list is undoubtedly far smaller than the actual\nnumber. No one disputes that every President since\nJames Buchanan has made recess appointments to pre\u00ad\nexisting vacancies.\n   Common sense also suggests that many recess appoin\u00ad\ntees filled vacancies that arose before the recess began.\nWe have compared the list of intra-session recess ap\u00ad\npointments in the Solicitor General\u2019s brief with the chart\nof congressional recesses. Where a specific date of ap\u00ad\npointment can be ascertained, more than half of those\nintra-session appointments were made within two weeks\nof the beginning of a recess. That short window strongly\nsuggests that many of the vacancies initially arose prior to\nthe recess. See App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a\u201364a; Ap\u00ad\npendix A, infra. Thus, it is not surprising that the Con\u00ad\ngressional Research Service, after examining the vacancy\ndates associated with a random sample of 24 inter-session\nrecess appointments since 1981, concluded that \u201c[i]n most\nof the 24 cases, the preponderance of evidence indicated\nthat the vacancy arose prior to the recess during which the\nappointment was made.\u201d The Noel Canning Decision 3.\nFurther, with research assistance from the Supreme Court\nLibrary, we have examined a random sample of the recess\nappointments made by our two most recent Presidents,\nand have found that almost all of those appointments\nfilled pre-recess vacancies: Of a sample of 21 recess ap\u00ad\npointments, 18 filled pre-recess vacancies and only 1 filled\na vacancy that arose during the recess in which he was\nappointed. The precise date on which 2 of the vacancies\narose could not be determined. See Appendix B, infra.\nTaken together, we think it is a fair inference that a large\nproportion of the recess appointments in the history of the\nNation have filled pre-existing vacancies.\n   Did the Senate object? Early on, there was some spo\u00ad\nradic disagreement with the broad interpretation. In 1814\n30                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nSenator Gore said that if \u201cthe vacancy happen at another\ntime, it is not the case described by the Constitution.\u201d 26\nAnnals of Cong. 653. In 1822 a Senate committee, while\nfocusing on the President\u2019s power to fill a new vacancy\ncreated by statute, used language to the same effect. 38\nid., at 489, 500. And early Congresses enacted statutes\nauthorizing certain recess appointments, see post, at 31, a\nfact that may or may not suggest they accepted the nar\u00ad\nrower interpretation of the Clause. Most of those stat\u00ad\nutes\u2014including the one passed by the First Congress\u2014\nauthorized appointments to newly created offices, and may\nhave been addressed to the separate question of whether\nnew offices are vacancies within the meaning of the\nClause. See Letter from Alexander Hamilton to James\nMcHenry (May 3, 1799), in 23 Papers of Alexander Hamil\u00ad\nton 94 (H. Syrett ed. 1976) (\u201cVacancy is a relative term,\nand presupposes that the Office has been once filled\u201d);\nReply Brief 17. In any event, by 1862 Attorney General\nBates could still refer to \u201cthe unbroken acquiescence of the\nSenate\u201d in support of the broad interpretation. 10 Op.\nAtty. Gen., at 356.\n    Then in 1863 the Senate Judiciary Committee disagreed\nwith the broad interpretation. It issued a report conclud\u00ad\ning that a vacancy \u201cmust have its inceptive point after one\nsession has closed and before another session has begun.\u201d\nS. Rep. No. 80, 37th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 3. And the Senate\nthen passed the Pay Act, which provided that \u201cno money\nshall be paid . . . as a salary, to any person appointed\nduring the recess of the Senate, to fill a vacancy . . . which\n. . . existed while the Senate was in session.\u201d Act of Feb. 9,\n1863, \u00a72, 12 Stat. 646. Relying upon the floor statement of\na single Senator, JUSTICE SCALIA suggests that the pas\u00ad\nsage of the Pay Act indicates that the Senate as a whole\nendorsed the position in the 1863 Report. But the circum\u00ad\nstances are more equivocal. During the floor debate on the\nbill, not a single Senator referred to the Report. Cong.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Indeed, Sena\u00ad\ntor Trumbull, who introduced the Pay Act, acknowledged\nthat there was disagreement about the underlying consti\u00ad\ntutional question. Id., at 565 (\u201c[S]ome other persons think\nhe has that power\u201d). Further, if a majority of the Senate\nhad believed appointments to pre-recess vacancies were\nunconstitutional, it could have attempted to do far more\nthan temporarily dock the appointees\u2019 pay. Cf. Tenure of\nOffice Act of 1867, \u00a75, 14 Stat. 431 (making it a federal\ncrime for \u201cany person\u201d to \u201caccept any appointment\u201d in\ncertain circumstances).\n   In any event, the Senate subsequently abandoned its\nhostility. In the debate preceding the 1905 Senate Report\nregarding President Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cconstructive\u201d recess\nappointments, Senator Tillman\u2014who chaired the Com\u00ad\nmittee that authored the 1905 Report\u2014brought up the\n1863 Report, and another Senator responded: \u201cWhatever\nthat report may have said in 1863, I do not think that has\nbeen the view the Senate has taken\u201d of the issue. 38 Cong.\nRec. 1606 (1904). Senator Tillman then agreed that \u201cthe\nSenate has acquiesced\u201d in the President\u2019s \u201cpower to fill\u201d\npre-recess vacancies. Ibid. And Senator Tillman\u2019s 1905\nReport described the Clause\u2019s purpose in terms closely\nechoing Attorney General Wirt. 1905 Senate Report, at 2\n(\u201cIts sole purpose was to render it certain that at all times\nthere should be, whether the Senate was in session or not,\nan officer for every office\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   In 1916 the Senate debated whether to pay a recess\nappointee who had filled a pre-recess vacancy and had not\nsubsequently been confirmed. Both Senators to address\nthe question\u2014one on each side of the payment debate\u2014\nagreed that the President had the constitutional power to\nmake the appointment, and the Senate voted to pay the\nappointee for his service. 53 Cong. Rec. 4291\u20134299; 39\nStat. 818\u2013819. In 1927 the Comptroller General, a legisla\u00ad\ntive officer, wrote that \u201cthere is no question but that the\n32                   NLRB v.

The Solicitor General\nhas identified 40 between 1863 and 1940, but that number\nis clearly not comprehensive. See, e.g., 32 Op. Atty. Gen.\n271\u2013272 (1920) (listing 5 appointments that are not in the\nSolicitor General\u2019s appendix); Recess Appointments,\nWashington Post, July 7, 1880, p. 1 (noting that President\nHayes had made \u201cquite a number of appointments\u201d to pre\u00ad\nrecess vacancies).\n   Then in 1940 Congress amended the Pay Act to author\u00ad\nize salary payments (with some exceptions) where (1) the\n\u201cvacancy arose within thirty days prior to the termination\nof the session,\u201d (2) \u201cat the termination of the session\u201d a\nnomination was \u201cpending,\u201d or (3) a nominee was \u201crejected\nby the Senate within thirty days prior to the termination\nof the session.\u201d Act of July 11, 54 Stat. 751 (codified, as\namended, at 5 U. S. C. \u00a75503). All three circumstances\nconcern a vacancy that did not initially occur during a\nrecess but happened to exist during that recess. By pay\u00ad\ning salaries to this kind of recess appointee, the 1940\nSenate (and later Senates) in effect supported the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s interpretation of the Clause.\n   The upshot is that the President has consistently and\nfrequently interpreted the Recess Appointments Clause to\napply to vacancies that initially occur before, but continue\nto exist during, a recess of the Senate. The Senate as a\nbody has not countered this practice for nearly three\u00ad\nquarters of a century, perhaps longer. See A. Amar, The\nUnwritten Constitution 576\u2013577, n. 16 (2012) (for nearly\n200 years \u201cthe overwhelming mass of actual practice\u201d\nsupports the President\u2019s interpretation); Mistretta v.\nUnited States, 488 U.

The tradition is long enough to entitle the\npractice \u201cto great regard in determining the true construc-\ntion\u201d of the constitutional provision. The Pocket Veto Case,\n279 U. S., at 690. And we are reluctant to upset this\ntraditional practice where doing so would seriously shrink\nthe authority that Presidents have believed existed and\nhave exercised for so long.\n   In light of some linguistic ambiguity, the basic purpose\nof the Clause, and the historical practice we have de-\nscribed, we conclude that the phrase \u201call vacancies\u201d in-\ncludes vacancies that come into existence while the Senate\nis in session.\n                              V\n  The third question concerns the calculation of the length\nof the Senate\u2019s \u201crecess.\u201d On December 17, 2011, the Sen-\nate by unanimous consent adopted a resolution to convene\n\u201cpro forma session[s]\u201d only, with \u201cno business . . . trans-\nacted,\u201d on every Tuesday and Friday from December 20,\n2011, through January 20, 2012. 2011 S. J. 923. At the\nend of each pro forma session, the Senate would \u201cadjourn\nuntil\u201d the following pro forma session. Ibid. During that\nperiod, the Senate convened and adjourned as agreed. It\nheld pro forma sessions on December 20, 23, 27, and 30,\nand on January 3, 6, 10, 13, 17, and 20; and at the end of\neach pro forma session, it adjourned until the time and\ndate of the next. Id., at 923\u2013924; 158 Cong. Rec. S1\u2013S11.\n  The President made the recess appointments before us\non January 4, 2012, in between the January 3 and the\nJanuary 6 pro forma sessions. We must determine the\nsignificance of these sessions\u2014that is, whether, for pur-\nposes of the Clause, we should treat them as periods when\nthe Senate was in session or as periods when it was in\nrecess. If the former, the period between January 3 and\nJanuary 6 was a 3-day recess, which is too short to trigger\n34                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\nthe President\u2019s recess-appointment power, see supra, at\n19\u201321. If the latter, however, then the 3-day period was\npart of a much longer recess during which the President\ndid have the power to make recess appointments, see ibid.\n   The Solicitor General argues that we must treat the\npro forma sessions as periods of recess. He says that these\n\u201csessions\u201d were sessions in name only because the Senate\nwas in recess as a functional matter. The Senate, he\ncontends, remained in a single, unbroken recess from\nJanuary 3, when the second session of the 112th Congress\nbegan by operation of the Twentieth Amendment, until\nJanuary 23, when the Senate reconvened to do regular\nbusiness.\n   In our view, however, the pro forma sessions count as\nsessions, not as periods of recess. We hold that, for pur\u00ad\nposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in\nsession when it says it is, provided that, under its own\nrules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.\nThe Senate met that standard here.\n   The standard we apply is consistent with the Constitu\u00ad\ntion\u2019s broad delegation of authority to the Senate to de\u00ad\ntermine how and when to conduct its business. The Con\u00ad\nstitution explicitly empowers the Senate to \u201cdetermine the\nRules of its Proceedings.\u201d Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 2. And we have\nheld that \u201call matters of method are open to the determi\u00ad\nnation\u201d of the Senate, as long as there is \u201ca reasonable\nrelation between the mode or method of proceeding estab\u00ad\nlished by the rule and the result which is sought to be\nattained\u201d and the rule does not \u201cignore constitutional\nrestraints or violate fundamental rights.\u201d United States v.\nBallin, 144 U. S. 1, 5 (1892).\n   In addition, the Constitution provides the Senate with\nextensive control over its schedule. There are only limited\nexceptions. See Amdt. 20, \u00a72 (Congress must meet once a\nyear on January 3, unless it specifies another day by law);\nArt. II, \u00a73 (Senate must meet if the President calls it into\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           35\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nspecial session); Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 4 (neither House may ad\u00ad\njourn for more than three days without consent of the\nother). See also Art. II, \u00a73 (\u201c[I]n Case of Disagreement\nbetween [the Houses], with Respect to the Time of Ad\u00ad\njournment, [the President] may adjourn them to such\nTime as he shall think proper\u201d). The Constitution thus\ngives the Senate wide latitude to determine whether and\nwhen to have a session, as well as how to conduct the\nsession. This suggests that the Senate\u2019s determination\nabout what constitutes a session should merit great\nrespect.\n   Furthermore, this Court\u2019s precedents reflect the breadth\nof the power constitutionally delegated to the Senate. We\ngenerally take at face value the Senate\u2019s own report of its\nactions. When, for example, \u201cthe presiding officers\u201d of the\nHouse and Senate sign an enrolled bill (and the President\n\u201capprove[s]\u201d it), \u201cits authentication as a bill that has\npassed Congress should be deemed complete and unim\u00ad\npeachable.\u201d Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649,\n672 (1892). By the same principle, when the Journal of\nthe Senate indicates that a quorum was present, under a\nvalid Senate rule, at the time the Senate passed a bill, we\nwill not consider an argument that a quorum was not, in\nfact, present. Ballin, supra, at 9. The Constitution re\u00ad\nquires the Senate to keep its Journal, Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 3\n(\u201cEach House shall keep a Journal of its proceedings . . .\u201d),\nand \u201cif reference may be had to\u201d it, \u201cit must be assumed to\nspeak the truth,\u201d Ballin, supra, at 4.\n   For these reasons, we conclude that we must give great\nweight to the Senate\u2019s own determination of when it is and\nwhen it is not in session. But our deference to the Senate\ncannot be absolute. When the Senate is without the ca-\npacity to act, under its own rules, it is not in session even\nif it so declares. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 69 (acknowledgment\nby counsel for amici Senators that if the Senate had left\nthe Capitol and \u201ceffectively given up . . . the business of\n36                    NLRB v. CANNING\n\n                Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                      Opinion of the of the\n\nlegislating\u201d then it might be in recess, even if it said it was\nnot). In that circumstance, the Senate is not simply un\u00ad\nlikely or unwilling to act upon nominations of the Presi\u00ad\ndent. It is unable to do so. The purpose of the Clause is to\nensure the continued functioning of the Federal Govern\u00ad\nment while the Senate is unavailable. See supra, at 5\u20136.\nThis purpose would count for little were we to treat the\nSenate as though it were in session even when it lacks the\nability to provide its \u201cadvice and consent.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2.\nAccordingly, we conclude that when the Senate declares\nthat it is in session and possesses the capacity, under its\nown rules, to conduct business, it is in session for purposes\nof the Clause.\n   Applying this standard, we find that the pro forma\nsessions were sessions for purposes of the Clause. First,\nthe Senate said it was in session. The Journal of the\nSenate and the Congressional Record indicate that the\nSenate convened for a series of twice-weekly \u201csessions\u201d\nfrom December 20 through January 20. 2011 S. J. 923\u2013\n924; 158 Cong. Rec. S1\u2013S11. (The Journal of the Senate\nfor 2012 has not yet been published.) And these reports of\nthe Senate \u201cmust be assumed to speak the truth.\u201d Ballin,\nsupra, at 4.\n   Second, the Senate\u2019s rules make clear that during its\npro forma sessions, despite its resolution that it would\nconduct no business, the Senate retained the power to\nconduct business. During any pro forma session, the\nSenate could have conducted business simply by passing a\nunanimous consent agreement. See Riddick\u2019s 1313. The\nSenate in fact conducts much of its business through\nunanimous consent. Id., at 1311\u20131312. Senate rules\npresume that a quorum is present unless a present Sena\u00ad\ntor questions it. Id., at 1041\u20131042. And when the Senate\nhas a quorum, an agreement is unanimously passed if,\nupon its proposal, no present Senator objects. Id., at\n1329\u20131330. It is consequently unsurprising that the\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           37\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\nSenate has enacted legislation during pro forma sessions\neven when it has said that no business will be transacted.\nIndeed, the Senate passed a bill by unanimous consent\nduring the second pro forma session after its December 17\nadjournment. 2011 S. J. 924. And that bill quickly be\u00ad\ncame law. Pub. L. 112\u201378, 125 Stat. 1280.\n  By way of contrast, we do not see how the Senate could\nconduct business during a recess. It could terminate the\nrecess and then, when in session, pass a bill. But in that\ncase, of course, the Senate would no longer be in recess. It\nwould be in session. And that is the crucial point. Senate\nrules make clear that, once in session, the Senate can act\neven if it has earlier said that it would not.\n  The Solicitor General argues that more is required. He\ncontends that what counts is not the Senate\u2019s capacity to\nconduct business but what the Senate actually does (or\nhere, did) during its pro forma sessions. And he looks for\nsupport to the functional definition of \u201crecess\u201d set forth in\nthe 1905 Senate Report discussed above. See supra, at 14.\nThat Report describes a \u201crecess\u201d of the Senate as\n    \u201cthe period of time . . . when its members owe no duty\n    of attendance; when its Chamber is empty; when, be\u00ad\n    cause of its absence, it can not receive communica\u00ad\n    tions from the President or participate as a body in\n    making appointments.\u201d 1905 Senate Report, at 2.\n  Even were we, for argument\u2019s sake, to accept all of these\ncriteria as authoritative, they would here be met. Taking\nthe last criterion first, could the Senate, during its pro\nforma sessions, \u201cparticipate as a body in making appoint\u00ad\nments\u201d? It could. It could confirm nominees by unani\u00ad\nmous consent, just as it passed the bill mentioned above.\nSee Riddick\u2019s 1313.\n  Could the Senate \u201creceive communications from the\nPresident\u201d? It could. The Congressional Record indicates\nthat the Senate \u201creceived\u201d a message from the President\n38                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\non January 12, during a 3-day adjournment between two\npro forma sessions. See 158 Cong. Rec. S37 (Jan. 23,\n2012). If the Senate could receive Presidential messages\nbetween two pro forma sessions, it could receive them\nduring a pro forma session.\n   Was the Senate\u2019s Chamber \u201cempty\u201d? It was not. By its\nofficial rules, the Senate operates under the presumption\nthat a quorum is present until a present Senator suggests\nthe absence of a quorum, Riddick\u2019s 1041\u20131042, and noth\u00ad\ning in the Journal of the Senate or the Congressional\nRecord reflects any such suggestion.\n   Did Senators \u201cowe [a] duty of attendance\u201d? They did.\nThe Senate\u2019s rules dictate that Senators are under a duty\nto attend every session. See Riddick\u2019s 214; Standing Rule\nof the Senate VI(2), S. Doc. No. 112\u20131, p. 5 (2011) (\u201cNo\nSenator shall absent himself from the service of the Sen\u00ad\nate without leave\u201d). Nothing excused the Senators from\nthis duty during the Senate\u2019s pro forma sessions. If any\npresent Senator had raised a question as to the presence\nof a quorum, and by roll call it had become clear that a\nquorum was missing, the Senators in attendance could\nhave directed the Sergeant at Arms to bring in the missing\nSenators. Rule VI(4).\n   The Solicitor General asks us to engage in a more realis\u00ad\ntic appraisal of what the Senate actually did. He argues\nthat, during the relevant pro forma sessions, business was\nnot in fact conducted; messages from the President could\nnot be received in any meaningful way because they could\nnot be placed before the Senate; the Senate Chamber was,\naccording to C-SPAN coverage, almost empty; and in\npractice attendance was not required. See Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 48\u201349, 54\u201355.\n   We do not believe, however, that engaging in the kind of\nfactual appraisal that the Solicitor General suggests is\neither legally or practically appropriate. From a legal\nperspective, this approach would run contrary to prece\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Field, 143 U. S., at\n672; see Ballin, 144 U. S., at 4. From a practical perspec-\ntive, judges cannot easily determine such matters as who\nis, and who is not, in fact present on the floor during a\nparticular Senate session. Judicial efforts to engage in\nthese kinds of inquiries would risk undue judicial interfer-\nence with the functioning of the Legislative Branch.\n   Finally, the Solicitor General warns that our holding\nmay \u201c \u2018disrup[t] the proper balance between the coordinate\nbranches by preventing the Executive Branch from ac-\ncomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 64 (quoting Morrison v. Olson, 487\nU. S. 654, 695 (1988); alteration in original). We do not\nsee, however, how our holding could significantly alter the\nconstitutional balance. Most appointments are not contro-\nversial and do not produce friction between the branches.\nWhere political controversy is serious, the Senate unques-\ntionably has other methods of preventing recess appoint-\nments. As the Solicitor General concedes, the Senate\ncould preclude the President from making recess appoint-\nments by holding a series of twice-a-week ordinary (not\npro forma) sessions. And the nature of the business con-\nducted at those ordinary sessions\u2014whether, for example,\nSenators must vote on nominations, or may return to\ntheir home States to meet with their constituents\u2014is a\nmatter for the Senate to decide. The Constitution also\ngives the President (if he has enough allies in Congress) a\nway to force a recess. Art. II, \u00a73 (\u201c[I]n Case of Disagree-\nment between [the Houses], with Respect to the Time of\nAdjournment, [the President] may adjourn them to such\nTime as he shall think proper\u201d). Moreover, the President\nand Senators engage with each other in many different\nways and have a variety of methods of encouraging each\nother to accept their points of view.\n40                   NLRB v. CANNING\n\n               Appendix A to opinionCourt Court\n                     Opinion of the of the\n\n  Regardless, the Recess Appointments Clause is not\ndesigned to overcome serious institutional friction. It\nsimply provides a subsidiary method for appointing offi\u00ad\ncials when the Senate is away during a recess. Here, as in\nother contexts, friction between the branches is an inevi\u00ad\ntable consequence of our constitutional structure. See\nMyers, 272 U. S., at 293 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). That\nstructure foresees resolution not only through judicial\ninterpretation and compromise among the branches but\nalso by the ballot box.\n                             VI\n   The Recess Appointments Clause responds to a struc\u00ad\ntural difference between the Executive and Legislative\nBranches: The Executive Branch is perpetually in opera\u00ad\ntion, while the Legislature only acts in intervals separated\nby recesses. The purpose of the Clause is to allow the\nExecutive to continue operating while the Senate is una\u00ad\nvailable. We believe that the Clause\u2019s text, standing\nalone, is ambiguous. It does not resolve whether the\nPresident may make appointments during intra-session\nrecesses, or whether he may fill pre-recess vacancies. But\nthe broader reading better serves the Clause\u2019s structural\nfunction. Moreover, that broader reading is reinforced by\ncenturies of history, which we are hesitant to disturb. We\nthus hold that the Constitution empowers the President to\nfill any existing vacancy during any recess\u2014intra-session\nor inter-session\u2014of sufficient length.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA would render illegitimate thousands of\nrecess appointments reaching all the way back to the\nfounding era. More than that: Calling the Clause an\n\u201canachronism,\u201d he would basically read it out of the Con\u00ad\nstitution. Post, at 12. He performs this act of judicial\nexcision in the name of liberty. We fail to see how excising\nthe Recess Appointments Clause preserves freedom.

And we\nlook to the actual practice of Government to inform our\ninterpretation.\n   Given our answer to the last question before us, we\nconclude that the Recess Appointments Clause does not\ngive the President the constitutional authority to make\nthe appointments here at issue.

On occasion, both chambers have\nheld one or more pro forma sessions because of this constitutional obligation or for other purposes. Treated\nhere as recesses, usually no business is conducted during these time periods.

S. Const., Art. II,\n\u00a72, cl. 2. That general rule is subject to an exception: \u201cThe\nPresident shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that\nmay happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting\nCommissions which shall expire at the End of their next\nSession.\u201d Id., \u00a72, cl. 3. This case requires us to decide\nwhether the Recess Appointments Clause authorized three\nappointments made by President Obama to the National\nLabor Relations Board in January 2012 without the Sen\u00ad\nate\u2019s consent.\n  To prevent the President\u2019s recess-appointment power\nfrom nullifying the Senate\u2019s role in the appointment pro\u00ad\ncess, the Constitution cabins that power in two significant\nways. First, it may be exercised only in \u201cthe Recess of the\nSenate,\u201d that is, the intermission between two formal\nlegislative sessions. Second, it may be used to fill only\nthose vacancies that \u201chappen during the Recess,\u201d that is,\noffices that become vacant during that intermission. Both\nconditions are clear from the Constitution\u2019s text and struc\u00ad\n2                 NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nture, and both were well understood at the founding. The\nCourt of Appeals correctly held that the appointments\nhere at issue are invalid because they did not meet either\ncondition.\n   Today\u2019s Court agrees that the appointments were in\u00ad\nvalid, but for the far narrower reason that they were made\nduring a 3-day break in the Senate\u2019s session. On its way\nto that result, the majority sweeps away the key textual\nlimitations on the recess-appointment power. It holds,\nfirst, that the President can make appointments without\nthe Senate\u2019s participation even during short breaks in the\nmiddle of the Senate\u2019s session, and second, that those\nappointments can fill offices that became vacant long\nbefore the break in which they were filled. The majority\njustifies those atextual results on an adverse-possession\ntheory of executive authority: Presidents have long\nclaimed the powers in question, and the Senate has not\ndisputed those claims with sufficient vigor, so the Court\nshould not \u201cupset the compromises and working arrange\u00ad\nments that the elected branches of Government them\u00ad\nselves have reached.\u201d Ante, at 9.\n   The Court\u2019s decision transforms the recess-appointment\npower from a tool carefully designed to fill a narrow and\nspecific need into a weapon to be wielded by future Presi\u00ad\ndents against future Senates. To reach that result, the\nmajority casts aside the plain, original meaning of the\nconstitutional text in deference to late-arising historical\npractices that are ambiguous at best. The majority\u2019s\ninsistence on deferring to the Executive\u2019s untenably broad\ninterpretation of the power is in clear conflict with our\nprecedent and forebodes a diminution of this Court\u2019s role\nin controversies involving the separation of powers and\nthe structure of government. I concur in the judgment\nonly.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                    I. Our Responsibility\n   Today\u2019s majority disregards two overarching principles\nthat ought to guide our consideration of the questions\npresented here.\n   First, the Constitution\u2019s core, government-structuring\nprovisions are no less critical to preserving liberty than\nare the later adopted provisions of the Bill of Rights.\nIndeed, \u201c[s]o convinced were the Framers that liberty of\nthe person inheres in structure that at first they did not\nconsider a Bill of Rights necessary.\u201d Clinton v. City of\nNew York, 524 U. S. 417, 450 (1998) (KENNEDY, J., concur\u00ad\nring). Those structural provisions reflect the founding\ngeneration\u2019s deep conviction that \u201cchecks and balances\nwere the foundation of a structure of government that\nwould protect liberty.\u201d Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714,\n722 (1986). It is for that reason that \u201cthe claims of indi\u00ad\nviduals\u2014not of Government departments\u2014have been the\nprincipal source of judicial decisions concerning separation\nof powers and checks and balances.\u201d Bond v. United\nStates, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10); see, e.g.,\nFree Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting\nOversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477 (2010); Clinton, supra; Plaut\nv. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211 (1995); Bowsher,\nsupra; INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983); Northern\nPipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S.\n50 (1982). Those decisions all rest on the bedrock princi\u00ad\nple that \u201cthe constitutional structure of our Government\u201d\nis designed first and foremost not to look after the inter\u00ad\nests of the respective branches, but to \u201cprotec[t] individual\nliberty.\u201d Bond, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11).\n   Second and relatedly, when questions involving the\nConstitution\u2019s government-structuring provisions are\npresented in a justiciable case, it is the solemn responsibil\u00ad\nity of the Judicial Branch \u201c \u2018to say what the law is.\u2019 \u201d Zivo\u00ad\ntofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7)\n(quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)).\n4                 NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nThis Court does not defer to the other branches\u2019 resolution\nof such controversies; as JUSTICE KENNEDY has previously\nwritten, our role is in no way \u201clessened\u201d because it might\nbe said that \u201cthe two political branches are adjusting their\nown powers between themselves.\u201d Clinton, supra, at 449\n(concurring opinion). Since the separation of powers exists\nfor the protection of individual liberty, its vitality \u201cdoes\nnot depend\u201d on \u201cwhether \u2018the encroached-upon branch\napproves the encroachment.\u2019 \u201d        Free Enterprise Fund,\nsupra, at 497 (quoting New York v. United States, 505\nU. S. 144, 182 (1992)); see also Freytag v. Commissioner,\n501 U. S. 868, 879\u2013880 (1991); Metropolitan Washington\nAirports Authority v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft\nNoise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 276\u2013277 (1991). Rather, polic\u00ad\ning the \u201cenduring structure\u201d of constitutional government\nwhen the political branches fail to do so is \u201cone of the most\nvital functions of this Court.\u201d Public Citizen v. Depart\u00ad\nment of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 468 (1989) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Our decision in Chadha illustrates that principle.\nThere, we held that a statutory provision authorizing one\nHouse of Congress to cancel an executive action taken\npursuant to statutory authority\u2014a so-called \u201clegislative\nveto\u201d\u2014exceeded the bounds of Congress\u2019s authority under\nthe Constitution. 462 U. S., at 957\u2013959. We did not hesi\u00ad\ntate to hold the legislative veto unconstitutional even\nthough Congress had enacted, and the President had\nsigned, nearly 300 similar provisions over the course of 50\nyears. Id., at 944\u2013945. Just the opposite: We said the\nother branches\u2019 enthusiasm for the legislative veto \u201csharp\u00ad\nened rather than blunted\u201d our review. Id., at 944. Like\u00ad\nwise, when the charge is made that a practice \u201cenhances\nthe President\u2019s powers beyond\u201d what the Constitution\npermits, \u201c[i]t is no answer . . . to say that Congress sur\u00ad\nrendered its authority by its own hand.\u201d Clinton, 524\nU. S., at 451 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). \u201c[O]ne Congress\n                   Cite as: 573 U.

Abdication of responsibility is not\npart of the constitutional design.\u201d Id., at 452 (citations\nomitted).\n   Of course, where a governmental practice has been\nopen, widespread, and unchallenged since the early days\nof the Republic, the practice should guide our interpreta\u00ad\ntion of an ambiguous constitutional provision.

That is a necessary corollary of the\nprinciple that the political branches cannot by agreement\nalter the constitutional structure. Plainly, then, a self\u00ad\naggrandizing practice adopted by one branch well after the\nfounding, often challenged, and never before blessed by\nthis Court\u2014in other words, the sort of practice on which\nthe majority relies in this case\u2014does not relieve us of our\nduty to interpret the Constitution in light of its text, struc\u00ad\nture, and original understanding.\n   Ignoring our more recent precedent in this area, which\nis extensive, the majority relies on The Pocket Veto Case,\n279 U. S. 655, 689 (1929), for the proposition that when\ninterpreting a constitutional provision \u201cregulating the\nrelationship between Congress and the President,\u201d we\nmust defer to the settled practice of the political branches\nif the provision is \u201c \u2018 \u201cin any respect of doubtful meaning.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n6                     NLRB v.

The\nPocket Veto Court had to decide whether a bill passed by\nthe House and Senate and presented to the President less\nthan 10 days before the adjournment of the first session of\na particular Congress, but neither signed nor vetoed by\nthe President, became a law. Most of the opinion analyzed\nthat issue like any other legal question and concluded that\ntreating the bill as a law would have been inconsistent\nwith the text and structure of the Constitution. Only near\nthe end of the opinion did the Court add that its conclu\u00ad\nsion was \u201cconfirmed\u201d by longstanding Presidential practice\nin which Congress appeared to have acquiesced. 279\nU.

Nearly all involved venerable and\nunchallenged practices, and constitutional provisions that were either\ndeeply ambiguous or plainly supportive of the practice. See Dames &\nMoore v. Regan, 453 U.

Intra-Session Breaks\n   The first question presented is whether \u201cthe Recess of\nthe Senate,\u201d during which the President\u2019s recess\u00ad\nappointment power is active, is (a) the period between two\nof the Senate\u2019s formal sessions, or (b) any break in the\nSenate\u2019s proceedings. I would hold that \u201cthe Recess\u201d is the\ngap between sessions and that the appointments at issue\nhere are invalid because they undisputedly were made\nduring the Senate\u2019s session. The Court\u2019s contrary conclu\u00ad\nsion\u2014that \u201cthe Recess\u201d includes \u201cbreaks in the midst of a\nsession,\u201d ante, at 9\u2014is inconsistent with the Constitution\u2019s\ntext and structure, and it requires judicial fabrication of\nvague, unadministrable limits on the recess-appointment\npower (thus defined) that overstep the judicial role. And\nalthough the majority relies heavily on \u201chistorical prac\u00ad\ntice,\u201d no practice worthy of our deference supports the\nmajority\u2019s conclusion on this issue.\n                   A. Plain Meaning\n  A sensible interpretation of the Recess Appointments\nClause should start by recognizing that the Clause uses\nthe term \u201cRecess\u201d in contradistinction to the term \u201cSes\u00ad\nsion.\u201d As Alexander Hamilton wrote: \u201cThe time within\nwhich the power is to operate \u2018during the recess of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ngress elected under the present constitution,\u201d \u201crecognized by many\nsuccessive legislatures, and . . . acted upon by the judicial department,\u201d\nin support of the conclusion that the Necessary and Proper Clause\nallowed Congress to incorporate a bank); Stuart v.

Even Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.

The life of each elected Congress typically\nconsisted (as it still does) of two or more formal sessions\nseparated by adjournments \u201csine die,\u201d that is, without a\nspecified return date. See GPO, Congressional Directory,\n113th Cong., pp. 524\u2013542 (2013\u20132014) (hereinafter Con\u00ad\ngressional Directory) (listing sessions of Congress from\n1789 through 2013); 705 F. 3d 490, 512, and nn. 1\u20132\n(CADC 2013) (case below); ante, at 9. The period between\ntwo sessions was known as \u201cthe recess.\u201d See 26 Annals of\nCong. 748 (1814) (Sen. Gore) (\u201cThe time of the Senate\nconsists of two periods, viz: their session and their re\u00ad\ncess\u201d). As one scholar has thoroughly demonstrated, \u201cin\ngovernment practice the phrase \u2018the Recess\u2019 always re\u00ad\nferred to the gap between sessions.\u201d Natelson, The Ori\u00ad\ngins and Meaning of \u201cVacancies that May Happen During\nthe Recess\u201d in the Constitution\u2019s Recess Appointments\nClause, 37 Harv.

By contrast, other provisions of the Constitu\u00ad\ntion use the verb \u201cadjourn\u201d rather than \u201crecess\u201d to refer to\nthe commencement of breaks during a formal legislative\nsession. See, e.g., Art.

It first cites a letter\nfrom George Washington that is quite obviously an example of impre\u00ad\ncise, colloquial usage. See 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787,\np. 76 (M. Farrand rev. 1966) (\u201cI had put my carriage in the hands of a\nworkman to be repaired and had not the means of mooving [sic] during\nthe recess\u201d). It next cites an example from the New Jersey Legislature\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    9\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   To be sure, in colloquial usage both words, \u201crecess\u201d and\n\u201csession,\u201d could take on alternative, less precise meanings.\nA session could include any short period when a legisla\u00ad\nture\u2019s members were \u201cassembled for business,\u201d and a\nrecess could refer to any brief \u201csuspension\u201d of legislative\n\u201cbusiness.\u201d 2 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language (1828). So the Continental Congress\ncould complain of the noise from passing carriages dis\u00ad\nrupting its \u201cdaily Session,\u201d 29 Journals of the Continental\nCongress 1774\u20131789, p. 561 (1785) (J. Fitzpatrick ed.\n1933), and the House could \u201ctake a recess\u201d from 4 o\u2019clock\nto 6 o\u2019clock, Journal of the House of Representatives, 17th\nCong., 2d Sess., p. 259 (1823). But as even the majority\nacknowledges, the Constitution\u2019s use of \u201cthe word \u2018the\u2019 in\n\u2018the [R]ecess\u2019 \u201d tends to suggest \u201cthat the phrase refers to\nthe single break separating formal sessions.\u201d Ante, at 10.\n   More importantly, neither the Solicitor General nor the\nmajority argues that the Clause uses \u201csession\u201d in its loose,\ncolloquial sense. And if \u201cthe next Session\u201d denotes a for\u00ad\nmal session, then \u201cthe Recess\u201d must mean the break be\u00ad\ntween formal sessions. As every commentator on the\nClause until the 20th century seems to have understood,\nthe \u201cRecess\u201d and the \u201cSession\u201d to which the Clause refers\nare mutually exclusive, alternating states. See, e.g., The\nFederalist No. 67, at 455 (explaining that appointments\nwould require Senatorial consent \u201cduring the session of\nthe Senate\u201d and would be made by the President alone \u201cin\ntheir recess\u201d); 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 631 (1823) (contrasting\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat simply reflects that body\u2019s practice of dividing its time not only\ninto \u201csessions\u201d but also into distinct, formal \u201csittings\u201d within each\nsession, with \u201cthe recess\u201d denoting the period between sittings. See\nBrief for Respondent Noel Canning 23; see also Natelson 207. Finally,\nthe majority cites three pages from the Solicitor General\u2019s brief without\nacknowledging the arguments offered in response to the Solicitor\nGeneral\u2019s few supposed counterexamples. See, e.g., Brief for Respond\u00ad\nent Noel Canning 21\u201324; Natelson 222, n. 120.\n10                NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvacancies occurring \u201cduring the recess of the Senate\u201d with\nthose occurring \u201cduring the session of the Senate\u201d); 2 Op.\nAtty Gen. 525, 527 (1832) (discussing a vacancy that \u201ctook\nplace while the Senate was in session, and not during the\nrecess\u201d). It is linguistically implausible to suppose\u2014as the\nmajority does\u2014that the Clause uses one of those terms\n(\u201cRecess\u201d) informally and the other (\u201cSession\u201d) formally in\na single sentence, with the result that an event can occur\nduring both the \u201cRecess\u201d and the \u201cSession.\u201d\n   Besides being linguistically unsound, the majority\u2019s\nreading yields the strange result that an appointment\nmade during a short break near the beginning of one\nofficial session will not terminate until the end of the\nfollowing official session, enabling the appointment to last\nfor up to two years. The majority justifies that result by\nobserving that the process of confirming a nominee \u201cmay\ntake several months.\u201d Ante, at 17. But the average dura\u00ad\ntion of the confirmation process is irrelevant. The Clause\u2019s\nself-evident design is to have the President\u2019s unilateral\nappointment last only until the Senate has \u201chad an oppor\u00ad\ntunity to act on the subject.\u201d 3 J. Story, Commentaries on\nthe Constitution of the United States \u00a71551, p. 410 (1833)\n(emphasis added).\n   One way to avoid the linguistic incongruity of the major\u00ad\nity\u2019s reading would be to read both \u201cthe Recess\u201d and \u201cthe\nnext Session\u201d colloquially, so that the recess-appointment\npower would be activated during any temporary suspen\u00ad\nsion of Senate proceedings, but appointments made pur\u00ad\nsuant to that power would last only until the beginning of\nthe next suspension (which would end the next colloquial\nsession). See, e.g., Rappaport, The Original Meaning of\nthe Recess Appointments Clause, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1487,\n1569 (2005) (hereinafter Rappaport, Original Meaning).\nThat approach would be more linguistically defensible\nthan the majority\u2019s. But it would not cure the most fun\u00ad\ndamental problem with giving \u201cRecess\u201d its colloquial,\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nrather than its formal, meaning: Doing so leaves the re\u00ad\ncess-appointment power without a textually grounded\nprinciple limiting the time of its exercise.\n   The dictionary definitions of \u201crecess\u201d on which the ma\u00ad\njority relies provide no such principle. On the contrary,\nthey make clear that in colloquial usage, a recess could\ninclude any suspension of legislative business, no\nmatter how short. See 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 1602 (4th ed. 1773). Webster even\nprovides a stark illustration: \u201c[T]he house of representa\u00ad\ntives had a recess of half an hour.\u201d 2 Webster, supra. The\nnotion that the Constitution empowers the President to\nmake unilateral appointments every time the Senate\ntakes a half-hour lunch break is so absurd as to be self\u00ad\nrefuting. But that, in the majority\u2019s view, is what the text\nauthorizes.\n   The boundlessness of the colloquial reading of \u201cthe\nRecess\u201d thus refutes the majority\u2019s assertion that the\nClause\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d of \u201censur[ing] the continued function\u00ad\ning of the Federal Government\u201d demands that it apply to\nintra-session breaks as well as inter-session recesses.\nAnte, at 11. The majority disregards another self-evident\npurpose of the Clause: to preserve the Senate\u2019s role in the\nappointment process\u2014which the founding generation\nregarded as a critical protection against \u201c \u2018despotism,\u2019 \u201d\nFreytag, 501 U. S., at 883\u2014by clearly delineating the\ntimes when the President can appoint officers without the\nSenate\u2019s consent. Today\u2019s decision seriously undercuts\nthat purpose. In doing so, it demonstrates the folly of\ninterpreting constitutional provisions designed to estab\u00ad\nlish \u201ca structure of government that would protect liberty,\u201d\nBowsher, 478 U. S., at 722, on the narrow-minded as\u00ad\nsumption that their only purpose is to make the govern\u00ad\nment run as efficiently as possible. \u201cConvenience and\nefficiency,\u201d we have repeatedly recognized, \u201care not the\nprimary objectives\u201d of our constitutional framework. Free\n12                 NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nEnterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at 499 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n  Relatedly, the majority contends that the Clause\u2019s sup\u00ad\nposed purpose of keeping the wheels of government turn\u00ad\ning demands that we interpret the Clause to maintain its\nrelevance in light of the \u201cnew circumstance\u201d of the Sen\u00ad\nate\u2019s taking an increasing number of intra-session breaks\nthat exceed three days. Ante, at 17. Even if I accepted the\ncanard that courts can alter the Constitution\u2019s meaning to\naccommodate changed circumstances, I would be hard\npressed to see the relevance of that notion here. The rise\nof intra-session adjournments has occurred in tandem\nwith the development of modern forms of communication\nand transportation that mean the Senate \u201cis always avail\u00ad\nable\u201d to consider nominations, even when its Members are\ntemporarily dispersed for an intra-session break. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 21 (GINSBURG, J.). The Recess Appointments\nClause therefore is, or rather, should be, an anachro\u00ad\nnism\u2014\u201cessentially an historic relic, something whose\noriginal purpose has disappeared.\u201d Id., at 19 (KAGAN, J.).\nThe need it was designed to fill no longer exists, and its\nonly remaining use is the ignoble one of enabling the\nPresident to circumvent the Senate\u2019s role in the appoint\u00ad\nment process. That does not justify \u201cread[ing] it out of the\nConstitution\u201d and, contra the majority, ante, at 40, I would\nnot do so; but neither would I distort the Clause\u2019s original\nmeaning, as the majority does, to ensure a prominent role\nfor the recess-appointment power in an era when its influ\u00ad\nence is far more pernicious than beneficial.\n  To avoid the absurd results that follow from its collo\u00ad\nquial reading of \u201cthe Recess,\u201d the majority is forced to declare\nthat some intra-session breaks\u2014though undisputedly\nwithin the phrase\u2019s colloquial meaning\u2014are simply \u201ctoo\nshort to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause.\u201d Ante,\nat 21.

It is\ninconceivable that the Framers would have left the cir\u00ad\ncumstances in which the President could exercise such a\nsignificant and potentially dangerous power so utterly\nindeterminate. Other structural provisions of the Consti\u00ad\ntution that turn on duration are quite specific: Neither\nHouse can adjourn \u201cfor more than three days\u201d without the\nother\u2019s consent. Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 4. The President must\nreturn a passed bill to Congress \u201cwithin ten Days (Sun\u00ad\ndays excepted),\u201d lest it become a law. Id., \u00a77, cl. 2. Yet on\nthe majority\u2019s view, when the first Senate considered\ntaking a 1-month break, a 3-day weekend, or a half-hour\nsiesta, it had no way of knowing whether the President\nwould be constitutionally authorized to appoint officers in\nits absence. And any officers appointed in those circum\u00ad\nstances would have served under a cloud, unable to de\u00ad\ntermine with any degree of confidence whether their ap\u00ad\npointments were valid.3\n   Fumbling for some textually grounded standard, the\nmajority seizes on the Adjournments Clause, which bars\neither House from adjourning for more than three days\nwithout the other\u2019s consent. Id., \u00a75, cl. 4. According to the\nmajority, that clause establishes that a 3-day break is\nalways \u201ctoo short\u201d to trigger the Recess Appointments\nClause. Ante, at 19. It goes without saying that nothing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The majority insists that \u201cthe most likely reason the Framers did\n\nnot place a textual floor underneath the word \u2018recess\u2019 is that they did\nnot foresee the need for one\u201d because they did not anticipate that intra\u00ad\nsession breaks \u201cwould become lengthier and more significant than\ninter-session ones.\u201d Ante, at 19. The majority\u2019s logic escapes me. The\nFramers\u2019 supposed failure to anticipate \u201clength[y]\u201d intra-session breaks\nmight explain why (as I maintain) they did not bother to authorize\nrecess appointments during intra-session breaks at all; but it cannot\nexplain why (as the majority holds) they would have enacted a text that\nauthorizes appointments during all intra-session breaks\u2014even the\nshort ones the majority says they did anticipate\u2014without placing a\ntemporal limitation on that power.\n14                NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nin the constitutional text supports that disposition. If (as\nthe majority concludes) \u201cthe Recess\u201d means a recess in the\ncolloquial sense, then it necessarily includes breaks shorter\nthan three days. And the fact that the Constitution in\u00ad\ncludes a 3-day limit in one clause but omits it from the\nother weighs strongly against finding such a limit to be\nimplicit in the clause in which it does not appear. In all\nevents, the dramatically different contexts in which the\ntwo clauses operate make importing the 3-day limit from\nthe Adjournments Clause into the Recess Appointments\nClause \u201cboth arbitrary and mistaken.\u201d Rappaport, Origi\u00ad\nnal Meaning 1556.\n   And what about breaks longer than three days? The\nmajority says that a break of four to nine days is \u201cpre\u00ad\nsumptively too short\u201d but that the presumption may be\nrebutted in an \u201cunusual circumstance,\u201d such as a \u201cnational\ncatastrophe . . . that renders the Senate unavailable but\ncalls for an urgent response.\u201d Ante, at 21. The majority\nmust hope that the in terrorem effect of its \u201cpresumptively\ntoo short\u201d pronouncement will deter future Presidents\nfrom making any recess appointments during 4-to-9-day\nbreaks and thus save us from the absurd spectacle of\nunelected judges evaluating (after an evidentiary hear\u00ad\ning?) whether an alleged \u201ccatastrophe\u201d was sufficiently\n\u201curgent\u201d to trigger the recess-appointment power. The\nmajority also says that \u201cpolitical opposition in the Senate\nwould not qualify as an unusual circumstance.\u201d Ibid. So\nif the Senate should refuse to confirm a nominee whom the\nPresident considers highly qualified; or even if it should\nrefuse to confirm any nominee for an office, thinking the\noffice better left vacant for the time being; the President\u2019s\npower would not be triggered during a 4-to-9-day break, no\nmatter how \u201curgent\u201d the President\u2019s perceived need for the\nofficer\u2019s assistance. (The majority protests that this\n\u201cshould go without saying\u2014except that JUSTICE SCALIA\ncompels us to say it,\u201d ibid., seemingly forgetting that the\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Or can litigants seek\ninvalidation of an appointment made during a 10-day\nbreak by pointing to an absence of \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201curgent\u201d\ncircumstances necessitating an immediate appointment,\nalbeit without the aid of a \u201cpresumpt[ion]\u201d in their favor?\nOr, to put the question as it will present itself to lawyers\nin the Executive Branch: Can the President make an\nappointment during a 10-day break simply to overcome\n\u201cpolitical opposition in the Senate\u201d despite the absence of\nany \u201cnational catastrophe,\u201d even though it \u201cgo[es] without\nsaying\u201d that he cannot do so during a 9-day break? Who\nknows? The majority does not say, and neither does the\nConstitution.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority erroneously suggests that the \u201clack of a textual floor\nraises a problem that plagues\u201d both interpretations of \u201cthe Recess.\u201d\nAnte, at 19. Not so. If the Clause is given its plain meaning, the\nPresident cannot make recess appointments during the session but can\nmake recess appointments during any break between sessions, no\nmatter how short. Contra the majority, that is not a \u201cproblem.\u201d True,\nthe recess-appointment power applies even during very short inter\u00ad\nsession breaks. But inter-session breaks typically occur at most a few\ntimes a year, and the recess-appointment power is of limited utility\nduring very short inter-session breaks since, as explained below, the\nPresident can fill only those vacancies that arise during the break. See\nPart III, infra. Of course, as the Senate Judiciary Committee has\nargued, the break must be actual and not \u201cconstructive\u201d; the Senate\nmust adjourn for some measurable period of time between the two\nsessions. See infra, at 20\u201322. But the requirement that there actually\nbe a recess does not involve anywhere near the level of indeterminacy\nentailed by the majority\u2019s requirement that the recess be long enough\n(or the circumstances unusual enough), as determined by a court, to\n16                   NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Even if the many questions raised by the majority\u2019s\nfailure to articulate a standard could be answered, a\nlarger question would remain: If the Constitution\u2019s text\nempowers the President to make appointments during any\nbreak in the Senate\u2019s proceedings, by what right does the\nmajority subject the President\u2019s exercise of that power to\nvague, court-crafted limitations with no textual basis?\nThe majority claims its temporal guideposts are informed\nby executive practice, but a President\u2019s self-restraint\ncannot \u201cbind his successors by diminishing their powers.\u201d\nFree Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at 497; cf. Clinton v.\nJones, 520 U. S. 681, 718 (1997) (BREYER, J., concurring in\njudgment) (\u201cvoluntary actions\u201d by past Presidents \u201ctel[l] us\nlittle about what the Constitution commands\u201d).\n   An interpretation that calls for this kind of judicial\nadventurism cannot be correct. Indeed, if the Clause\nreally did use \u201cRecess\u201d in its colloquial sense, then there\nwould be no \u201cjudicially discoverable and manageable\nstandard for resolving\u201d whether a particular break was\nlong enough to trigger the recess-appointment power,\nmaking that a nonjusticiable political question.

Historical Practice\n  For the foregoing reasons, the Constitution\u2019s text and\nstructure unambiguously refute the majority\u2019s freewheel\u00ad\ning interpretation of \u201cthe Recess.\u201d It is not plausible that\nthe Constitution uses that term in a sense that authorizes\nthe President to make unilateral appointments during any\nbreak in Senate proceedings, subject only to hazy, atextual\nlimits crafted by this Court centuries after ratification.\nThe majority, however, insists that history \u201coffers strong\nsupport\u201d for its interpretation.

S. ____ (2014)                  17\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\npractice of the political branches is, of course, irrelevant\nwhen the Constitution is clear. But even if the Constitu\u00ad\ntion were thought ambiguous on this point, history does\nnot support the majority\u2019s interpretation.\n                       1. 1789 to 1866\n  To begin, the majority dismisses the 78 years of history\nfrom the founding through 1866 as \u201cnot helpful\u201d because\nduring that time Congress took hardly any \u201csignificant\u201d\nintra-session breaks, by which the majority evidently\nmeans breaks longer than three days. Ibid. (citing table in\nAppendix A, which does not include breaks of three or\nfewer days). In fact, Congress took 11 intra-session breaks\nof more than three days during that time, see Congres\u00ad\nsional Directory 524\u2013527, and it appears Presidents made\nrecess appointments during none of them.\n  More importantly, during those eight decades, Congress\nmust have taken thousands of breaks that were three days\nor shorter. On the majority\u2019s reading, every one of those\nbreaks would have been within the Clause\u2019s text\u2014the\nmajority\u2019s newly minted limitation not yet having been\nannounced. Yet there is no record of anyone, ever, having\nso much as mentioned the possibility that the recess\u00ad\nappointment power was activated during those breaks.\nThat would be surprising indeed if the text meant what\nthe majority thinks it means. Cf. Printz v. United States,\n521 U. S. 898, 907\u2013908 (1997).\n                      2. 1867 and 1868\n  The first intra-session recess appointments in our his\u00ad\ntory almost certainly were made by President Andrew John\u00ad\nson in 1867 and 1868.5 That was, of course, a period of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority does not contend otherwise. The Solicitor General\nclaims that President Lincoln appointed a handful of brigadier generals\nduring intra-session breaks in 1862 and 1863, but he does not include\nthose appointments in his list of known intra-session recess appoint\u00ad\n18                    NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndramatic conflict between the Executive and Congress\nthat saw the first-ever impeachment of a sitting President.\nThe Solicitor General counts 57 intra-session recess ap\u00ad\npointments during those two years. App. to Brief for\nPetitioner 1a\u20139a. But the precise nature and historical\nunderstanding of many of those appointments is subject to\ndebate. See, e.g., Brief for Constitutional Law Scholars as\nAmici Curiae 23\u201324; Rappaport, Nonoriginalism 27\u201333. It\nseems likely that at least 36 of the 57 appointments were\nmade with the understanding that they took place during\na recess between sessions. See id., at 27\u201331.\n   As for the remainder, the historical record reveals noth\u00ad\ning about how they were justified, if at all. There is no\nindication that Johnson\u2019s Attorney General or anyone else\nconsidered at the time whether those appointments were\nmade between or during formal legislative sessions or, if\nthe latter, how they could be squared with the constitu\u00ad\ntional text. The majority drives that point home by citing\na judicial opinion that upheld one of the appointments\nnearly two decades later with no analysis of the question\npresented here. See ante, at 11 (citing Gould v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1884)). Johnson\u2019s intra-session\nappointments were disavowed by the first Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral to address that question, see infra, at 20, and were\nnot followed as precedent by the Executive Branch for\nmore than 50 years, see infra, at 22. Thus, the relevance\nof those appointments to our constitutional inquiry is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nments. Compare Brief for Petitioner 22 with App. to Brief for Petitioner\n1a.

For one thing, the Senate adjourned for\nmore than 3 days 45 times during that period, and 43 of\nthose adjournments exceeded 10 days (and thus would not\neven be subject to the majority\u2019s \u201cpresumption\u201d against\nthe availability of recess appointments). See Congres\u00ad\nsional Directory 527\u2013529. Yet there is no evidence that a\nsingle appointment was made during any of those ad\u00ad\njournments or that any President before the 20th century\neven considered making such appointments.\n  In 1901 Philander Knox, the first Attorney General\nknown to have opined on the question, explicitly stated\nthat the recess-appointment power was limited to the\nperiod between formal sessions. 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 599.\nKnox advised President Theodore Roosevelt that he could\nnot appoint an appraiser of merchandise during an intra\u00ad\nsession adjournment. He explained:\n    \u201c[T]he Constitution and laws make it clear that in our\n    legislative practice an adjournment during a session\n    of Congress means a merely temporary suspension of\n    business from day to day . . . whereas the recess means\n    the period after the final adjournment of Congress for\n    the session, and before the next session begins. . . . It\n    is this period following the final adjournment for the\n    session which is the recess during which the President\n    has power to fill vacancies . . . . Any intermediate\n    temporary adjournment is not such recess, although it\n20                    NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n     may be a recess in the general and ordinary use of\n     that term.\u201d Id., at 601.6\nKnox went on to observe that none of the \u201cmany elaborate\nopinions\u201d of previous Attorneys General concerning the\nrecess-appointment power had asserted that the power\ncould be exercised \u201cduring a temporary adjournment of the\nSenate,\u201d rather than \u201cduring the recess of the Senate\nbetween two sessions of Congress.\u201d Id., at 602. He\nacknowledged the contrary example furnished by John\u00ad\nson\u2019s appointments in 1867 and 1868, but noted (with\nperhaps too much tact) that \u201c[t]he public circumstances\nproducing this state of affairs were unusual and involved\nresults which should not be viewed as precedents.\u201d Id.,\nat 603.\n  That was where things stood when, in 1903, Roosevelt\nmade a number of controversial recess appointments. At\nnoon on December 7, the Senate moved seamlessly from a\nspecial session into a regular one scheduled to begin at\nthat hour. See 37 Cong. Rec. 544; 38 Cong. Rec. 1. Roose\u00ad\nvelt claimed to have made the appointments in a \u201ccon\u00ad\nstructive\u201d recess between the two sessions. See Special\nSession Is Merged Into Regular, N. Y. Times, Dec. 8, 1903,\np. 1. He and his allies in the Senate justified the ap\u00ad\npointments on the theory that \u201cat the moment the gavel\nfalls to summon the regular session into being there is an\ninfinitesimal fraction of a second, which is the recess\nbetween the two sessions.\u201d Extra Session Muddle, N. Y.\nTimes, Dec. 7, 1903, p. 3. In 1905, the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee published a report criticizing the appointments\non the ground that \u201cthe Constitution means a real recess,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The majority dismisses Knox\u2019s opinion as overly formalistic because\n\nit \u201crelied heavily upon the use of the word \u2018the\u2019 \u201d in the phrase \u201cthe\nRecess.\u201d Ante, at 13. It did not. As the passage quoted above makes\nclear, Knox was relying on the common understanding of what \u201cthe\nRecess\u201d meant in the context of marking out legislative time.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

The report explained that the recess is \u201cthe\nperiod of time when the Senate is not sitting in regular or\nextraordinary session . . . when its members owe no duty\nof attendance; when its Chamber is empty; when, because\nof its absence, it can not receive communications from the\nPresident or participate as a body in making appoint\u00ad\nments.\u201d Id., at 2 (emphasis deleted).\n   The majority seeks support in this episode, claiming\nthat the Judiciary Committee embraced a \u201cbroad and\nfunctional definition of \u2018recess\u2019 \u201d consistent with the one\nthe majority adopts. Ante, at 16. On the contrary, the\nepisode powerfully refutes the majority\u2019s theory. Roosevelt\u2019s\nlegal justification for his appointments was extremely\naggressive, but even he recognized that \u201cthe Recess of\nthe Senate\u201d could take place only between formal sessions.\nIf the majority\u2019s view of the Clause had been considered\nplausible, Roosevelt could have strengthened his position\nconsiderably by making the appointments during an intra\u00ad\nsession break of a few days, or at least a few hours. (Just\n10 minutes after the new session began on December 7,\nthe Senate took \u201ca recess for one hour.\u201d 38 Cong. Rec. 2.)\nThat he instead strained to declare a dubious inter-session\nrecess of an \u201cinfinitesimal fraction of a second\u201d is powerful\nevidence that the majority\u2019s view of \u201cthe Recess\u201d was not\ntaken seriously even as late as the beginning of the 20th\ncentury.\n   Yet the majority contends that \u201cto the extent that the\nSenate or a Senate committee has expressed a view, that\nview has favored a functional definition of \u2018recess\u2019 [that]\nencompasses intra-session recesses.\u201d Ante, at 14. It rests\nthat contention entirely on the 1905 Judiciary Committee\nReport. This distorts what the committee said when it\ndenied Roosevelt\u2019s claim that there had been a recess. If\nsomeone avers that a catfish is a cat, and I respond by\npointing out that a catfish lives in water and does not have\n22                NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfour legs, I have not endorsed the proposition that every\nland-dwelling quadruped is a cat. Likewise, when the\nJudiciary Committee explained that an instantaneous\ntransition from one session to another is not a recess\nbecause the Senate is never absent, it did not suggest that\nthe Senate\u2019s absence is enough to create a recess. To\nassume otherwise, as the majority does, is to commit the\nfallacy of the inverse (otherwise known as denying the\nantecedent): the incorrect assumption that if P implies Q,\nthen not-P implies not-Q. Contrary to that fallacious\nassumption, the Judiciary Committee surely believed,\nconsistent with the Executive\u2019s clear position at the time,\nthat \u201cthe Recess\u201d was limited to (actual, not constructive)\nbreaks between sessions.\n                    4. 1921 to the Present\n   It is necessary to skip over the first 13 decades of our\nNation\u2019s history in order to find a Presidential legal ad\u00ad\nviser arguably embracing the majority\u2019s interpretation of\n\u201cthe Recess.\u201d In 1921 President Harding\u2019s Attorney General,\nHarry Daugherty, advised Harding that he could make\nrecess appointments while the Senate stood adjourned for\n28 days during the session because \u201cthe term \u2018recess\u2019 must\nbe given a practical construction.\u201d 33 Op. Atty. Gen. 20,\n25. Daugherty acknowledged Knox\u2019s 1901 opinion to the\ncontrary, id., at 21, but he (committing the same fallacy as\ntoday\u2019s majority) thought the 1905 Judiciary Committee\nreport had come to the opposite conclusion, id., at 23\u201324.\nHe also recognized the fundamental flaw in this interpre\u00ad\ntation: that it would be impossible to \u201caccurately dra[w]\u201d a\nline between intra-session breaks that constitute \u201cthe\nRecess\u201d and those that do not. Id., at 25. But he thought\nthe absence of a standard gave the President \u201cdiscretion to\ndetermine when there is a real and genuine recess.\u201d Ibid.\nWhile a \u201cpalpable abuse of discretion might subject his\nappointment to review,\u201d Daugherty thought that \u201c[e]very\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

The Solicitor General has\nidentified 22 such appointments made by Presidents\nHarding, Coolidge, Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt be\u00ad\ntween 1921 and 1944. App. to Brief for Petitioner 9a\u201312a.\nIntra-session recess appointments experienced a brief\nheyday after World War II, with President Truman mak\u00ad\ning about 150 such appointments to civilian positions and\nseveral thousand to military posts from 1945 through\n1950. Id., at 12a\u201327a. (The majority\u2019s impressive\u00ad\nsounding claim that \u201cPresidents have made thousands of\nintra-session recess appointments,\u201d ante, at 12, depends\nentirely on post-war military appointments that Truman\nmade in just two years, 1947 and 1948.) President Eisen\u00ad\nhower made only 43 intra-session recess appointments,\nid., at 27a\u201330a, after which the practice sank back into\nrelative obscurity. Presidents Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson,\nand Ford made none, while Nixon made just 7. Id., at\n30a\u201331a. The practice rose again in the last decades of\nthe 20th century: President Carter made 17 intra-session\nrecess appointments, Reagan 72, George H. W. Bush 37,\nClinton 53, and George W. Bush 135. Id., at 31a\u201361a.\nWhen the Solicitor General filed his brief, President\nObama had made 26. Id., at 62a\u201364a.

NOEL CANNING\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Legal advisers in the Executive Branch during this\nperiod typically endorsed the President\u2019s authority to\nmake intra-session recess appointments by citing Daugh\u00ad\nerty\u2019s opinion with little or no additional analysis. See,\ne.g., 20 Opinions of Office of Legal Counsel (Op. OLC) 124,\n161 (1996) (finding the question to have been \u201csettled\nwithin the executive branch\u201d by Daugherty\u2019s \u201coften-cited\nopinion\u201d). The majority\u2019s contention that \u201copinions of\nPresidential legal advisers . . . are nearly unanimous in\ndetermining that the Clause authorizes [intra-session\nrecess] appointments,\u201d ante, at 12, is thus true but mis\u00ad\nleading: No Presidential legal adviser approved that prac\u00ad\ntice before 1921, and subsequent approvals have rested\nmore on precedent than on independent examination.\n   The majority is correct that during this period, the\nSenate \u201cas a body\u201d did not formally repudiate the emerg\u00ad\ning executive practice.

But the rise of intra-session recess\nappointments in the latter half of the 20th century drew\nsharp criticism from a number of Senators on both sides of\nthe aisle. At first, their objections focused on the length of\nthe intra-session breaks at issue. See, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec.\n22774\u201322776 (1984) (Sen.

Rec. 15266\u201315267. The brief argued that \u201cthe\nrecess[-appointment] power is limited to Congress\u2019 annual\nrecess between sessions,\u201d that no contrary executive prac\u00ad\ntice \u201cof any appreciable magnitude\u201d had existed before\n\u201cthe past fifty years,\u201d and that the Senate had not \u201cacqui\u00ad\nesced in this steady expansion of presidential power.\u201d Id.,\nat 15268, 15270. It explained that some Senators had\nlimited their objections to shorter intra-session breaks out\nof a desire \u201cto coexist with the Executive\u201d but that \u201cthe\nExecutive\u2019s subsequent, steady chipping away at the\nlength of recess sufficient for making recess appointments\nha[d] demonstrated the need to return to the Framers\u2019\noriginal intent and limit the power to intersession ad\u00ad\njournments.\u201d Id., at 15267, 15272. Senator Kennedy\nreiterated that position in a brief to this Court in 2004.\nBrief for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as Amicus Curiae in\nFranklin v. United States, O. T. 2004, No. 04\u20135858, p. 5.\nToday the partisan tables are turned, and that position is\nurged on us by the Senate\u2019s Republican Members. See\nBrief for Sen. McConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 26.\n                        *     *    *\n   What does all this amount to? In short: Intra-session\nrecess appointments were virtually unheard of for the first\n130 years of the Republic, were deemed unconstitutional\nby the first Attorney General to address them, were not\nopenly defended by the Executive until 1921, were not\nmade in significant numbers until after World War II, and\nhave been repeatedly criticized as unconstitutional by\nSenators of both parties. It is astonishing for the majority\nto assert that this history lends \u201cstrong support,\u201d ante, at\n11, to its interpretation of the Recess Appointments\nClause. And the majority\u2019s contention that recent execu\u00ad\ntive practice in this area merits deference because the\n26                NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nSenate has not done more to oppose it is utterly divorced\nfrom our precedent. \u201cThe structural interests protected by\nthe Appointments Clause are not those of any one branch\nof Government but of the entire Republic,\u201d Freytag, 501\nU. S., at 880, and the Senate could not give away those\nprotections even if it wanted to. See Chadha, 462 U. S., at\n957\u2013958; Clinton, 524 U. S., at 451\u2013452 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring).\n   Moreover, the majority\u2019s insistence that the Senate\ngainsay an executive practice \u201cas a body\u201d in order to pre\u00ad\nvent the Executive from acquiring power by adverse pos\u00ad\nsession, ante, at 14, will systematically favor the expansion\nof executive power at the expense of Congress. In any con\u00ad\ntroversy between the political branches over a separation\u00ad\nof-powers question, staking out a position and defending\nit over time is far easier for the Executive Branch than\nfor the Legislative Branch. See generally Bradley and\nMorrison, Historical Gloss and the Separation of Powers,\n126 Harv. L. Rev. 411, 439\u2013447 (2012). All Presidents\nhave a high interest in expanding the powers of their\noffice, since the more power the President can wield, the\nmore effectively he can implement his political agenda;\nwhereas individual Senators may have little interest in\nopposing Presidential encroachment on legislative prerog\u00ad\natives, especially when the encroacher is a President who\nis the leader of their own party. (The majority would not\nbe able to point to a lack of \u201cformal action\u201d by the Senate\n\u201cas a body\u201d challenging intra-session recess appointments,\nante, at 15\u201316, had the appointing President\u2019s party in the\nSenate not blocked such action on multiple occasions.)\nAnd when the President wants to assert a power and\nestablish a precedent, he faces neither the collective-action\nproblems nor the procedural inertia inherent in the legis\u00ad\nlative process. The majority\u2019s methodology thus all but\nguarantees the continuing aggrandizement of the Execu\u00ad\ntive Branch.\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                  27\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                  III. Pre-Recess Vacancies\n  The second question presented is whether vacancies\nthat \u201chappen during the Recess of the Senate,\u201d which the\nPresident is empowered to fill with recess appointments,\nare (a) vacancies that arise during the recess, or (b) all\nvacancies that exist during the recess, regardless of when\nthey arose. I would hold that the recess-appointment\npower is limited to vacancies that arise during the recess\nin which they are filled, and I would hold that the ap\u00ad\npointments at issue here\u2014which undisputedly filled pre\u00ad\nrecess vacancies\u2014are invalid for that reason as well as for\nthe reason that they were made during the session. The\nCourt\u2019s contrary conclusion is inconsistent with the Con\u00ad\nstitution\u2019s text and structure, and it further undermines\nthe balance the Framers struck between Presidential and\nSenatorial power. Historical practice also fails to support\nthe majority\u2019s conclusion on this issue.\n                       A. Plain Meaning\n   As the majority concedes, \u201cthe most natural meaning of\n\u2018happens\u2019 as applied to a \u2018vacancy\u2019 . . . is that the vacancy\n\u2018happens\u2019 when it initially occurs.\u201d Ante, at 22. The ma\u00ad\njority adds that this meaning is most natural \u201cto a modern\near,\u201d ibid., but it fails to show that founding-era ears\nheard it differently. \u201cHappen\u201d meant then, as it does now,\n\u201c[t]o fall out; to chance; to come to pass.\u201d 1 Johnson, Dic\u00ad\ntionary of the English Language 913. Thus, a vacancy\nthat happened during the Recess was most reasonably\nunderstood as one that arose during the recess. It was, of\ncourse, possible in certain contexts for the word \u201chappen\u201d\nto mean \u201chappen to be\u201d rather than \u201chappen to occur,\u201d as\nin the idiom \u201cit so happens.\u201d But that meaning is not at\nall natural when the subject is a vacancy, a state of affairs\nthat comes into existence at a particular moment in time.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 8 Despite   initially admitting that the text \u201cdoes not naturally favor\u201d\n28                     NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   In any event, no reasonable reader would have under\u00ad\nstood the Recess Appointments Clause to use the word\n\u201chappen\u201d in the majority\u2019s \u201chappen to be\u201d sense, and thus\nto empower the President to fill all vacancies that might\nexist during a recess, regardless of when they arose. For\none thing, the Clause\u2019s language would have been a sur\u00ad\npassingly odd way of giving the President that power. The\nClause easily could have been written to convey that\nmeaning clearly: It could have referred to \u201call Vacancies\nthat may exist during the Recess,\u201d or it could have omitted\nthe qualifying phrase entirely and simply authorized the\nPresident to \u201cfill up all Vacancies during the Recess.\u201d\nGiven those readily available alternative phrasings, the\nreasonable reader might have wondered, why would any\nintelligent drafter intending the majority\u2019s reading have\ninserted the words \u201cthat may happen\u201d\u2014words that, as the\nmajority admits, make the majority\u2019s desired reading\nawkward and unnatural, and that must be effectively read\nout of the Clause to achieve that reading?\n   For another thing, the majority\u2019s reading not only\nstrains the Clause\u2019s language but distorts its constitutional\nrole, which was meant to be subordinate. As Hamilton\nexplained, appointment with the advice and consent of the\nSenate was to be \u201cthe general mode of appointing officers\nof the United States.\u201d The Federalist No. 67, at 455. The\nSenate\u2019s check on the President\u2019s appointment power was\nseen as vital because \u201c \u2018manipulation of official appoint\u00ad\nments\u2019 had long been one of the American revolutionary\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nits interpretation, the majority halfheartedly suggests that the \u201c \u2018hap\u00ad\npen to be\u2019 \u201d reading may be admissible when the subject, like \u201cvacancy,\u201d\ndenotes a \u201ccontinuing state.\u201d Ante, at 22\u201323. That suggestion distorts\nordinary English usage. It is indeed natural to say that an ongoing\nactivity or event, like a war, a parade, or a financial crisis, is \u201chappen\u00ad\ning\u201d for as long as it continues. But the same is not true when the\nsubject is a settled state of affairs, like death, marriage, or vacancy, all\nof which \u201chappen\u201d when they come into being.\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   29\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ngeneration\u2019s greatest grievances against executive power.\u201d\nFreytag, 501 U. S., at 883. The unilateral power conferred\non the President by the Recess Appointments Clause was\ntherefore understood to be \u201cnothing more than a supple\u00ad\nment\u201d to the \u201cgeneral method\u201d of advice and consent. The\nFederalist No. 67, at 455.\n   If, however, the Clause had allowed the President to fill\nall pre-existing vacancies during the recess by granting\ncommissions that would last throughout the following\nsession, it would have been impossible to regard it\u2014as the\nFramers plainly did\u2014as a mere codicil to the Constitu\u00ad\ntion\u2019s principal, power-sharing scheme for filling federal\noffices. On the majority\u2019s reading, the President would\nhave had no need ever to seek the Senate\u2019s advice and\nconsent for his appointments: Whenever there was a fair\nprospect of the Senate\u2019s rejecting his preferred nominee,\nthe President could have appointed that individual unilat\u00ad\nerally during the recess, allowed the appointment to ex\u00ad\npire at the end of the next session, renewed the appoint\u00ad\nment the following day, and so on ad infinitum.\n(Circumvention would have been especially easy if, as the\nmajority also concludes, the President was authorized to\nmake such appointments during any intra-session break of\nmore than a few days.) It is unthinkable that such an\nobvious means for the Executive to expand its power\nwould have been overlooked during the ratification\ndebates.9\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The majority insists that \u201ccharacter and politics\u201d will ordinarily\n\nprevent the President from circumventing the Senate, and that the\nSenate has \u201cpolitical resources\u201d to respond to attempts at circumven\u00ad\ntion. Ante, at 25. Neither character nor politics prevented Theodore\nRoosevelt from proclaiming a fictitious recess lasting an \u201cinfinitesimal\nfraction of a second.\u201d In any event, the Constitution does not entrust\nthe Senate\u2019s role in the appointments process to the vagaries of charac\u00ad\nter and politics. See, e.g., Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 879\u2013\n880 (1991).\n30                   NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n    The original understanding of the Clause was consistent\nwith what the majority concedes is the text\u2019s \u201cmost natu\u00ad\nral meaning.\u201d Ante, at 22. In 1792, Attorney General\nEdmund Randolph, who had been a leading member of the\nConstitutional Convention, provided the Executive\nBranch\u2019s first formal interpretation of the Clause. He\nadvised President Washington that the Constitution did\nnot authorize a recess appointment to fill the office of\nChief Coiner of the United States Mint, which had been\ncreated by Congress on April 2, 1792, during the Senate\u2019s\nsession. Randolph wrote: \u201c[I]s it a vacancy which has\nhappened during the recess of the Senate? It is now the\nsame and no other vacancy, than that, which existed on\nthe 2nd. of April 1792. It commenced therefore on that\nday or may be said to have happened on that day.\u201d Opin\u00ad\nion on Recess Appointments (July 7, 1792), in 24 Papers of\nThomas Jefferson 165\u2013166 (J. Catanzariti ed. 1990).\nRandolph added that his interpretation was the most\ncongruent with the Constitution\u2019s structure, which made\nthe recess-appointment power \u201can exception to the general\nparticipation of the Senate.\u201d Ibid. (footnote omitted).\n    President John Adams\u2019 Attorney General, Charles Lee,\nwas in agreement. See Letter to George Washington (July\n7, 1796) (the President may \u201cfill for a limited time an old\noffice become vacant during [the] recess\u201d (emphasis add\u00ad\ned)), online at http://founders.archives.gov/documents/\nWashington/99-01-02-00702; Letter from James McHenry\nto John Adams (May 7, 1799) (hereinafter 1799 McHenry\nLetter) (conveying Lee\u2019s advice that certain offices were\n\u201c \u2018vacanc[ies] happening during the session, which the\nPresident cannot fill, during the recess, by the powers\nvested in him by the constitution\u2019 \u201d), online at http://\nwardepartmentpapers.org/document.php?id=31766.10 One\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The majority does not deny that Lee took those positions, but it\n\nclaims he also \u201clater informed [Thomas] Jefferson that, in the Adams\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      31\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof the most prominent early academic commenters on the\nConstitution read the Clause the same way. See 1 St.\nGeorge Tucker, Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, App. 342\u2013343\n(1803) (assuming the President could appoint during the\nrecess only if \u201cthe office became vacant during the recess\u201d).\n  Early Congresses seem to have shared Randolph\u2019s and\nLee\u2019s view. A statute passed by the First Congress author\u00ad\nized the President to appoint customs inspectors \u201cwith the\nadvice and consent of the Senate\u201d and provided that \u201cif the\nappointment . . . shall not be made during the present\nsession of Congress, the President . . . is hereby empow\u00ad\nered to make such appointments during the recess of the\nSenate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the\nend of their next session.\u201d Act of Mar. 3, 1791, \u00a74, 1 Stat.\n200. That authorization would have been superfluous if\nthe Recess Appointments Clause had been understood to\napply to pre-existing vacancies. We have recognized that\nan action taken by the First Congress \u201cprovides \u2018contem\u00ad\nporaneous and weighty evidence\u2019 of the Constitution\u2019s\nmeaning.\u201d Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 723\u2013724. And other\nstatutes passed in the early years of the Republic con\u00ad\ntained similar authorizations. See App. to Brief for Re\u00ad\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nadministration, \u2018whenever an office became vacant, so short a time\nbefore Congress rose, as not to give an opportunity of enquiring for a\nproper character, they let it lie always till recess.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 27 (quoting\nLetter from Jefferson to Wilson Cary Nicholas (Jan. 26, 1802), in 36\nPapers of Thomas Jefferson 433 (B. Oberg ed. 2009) (hereinafter 1802\nJefferson Letter)). Assuming Lee in fact made the statement attributed\nto him by Jefferson, and further assuming that Lee endorsed the\nconstitutionality of the practice described in that statement (which\nJefferson does not say), that practice could only have been regarded as\na pragmatic exception to the general view of the Clause that Lee, like\nRandolph, espoused. And the practice must not have been extensive,\nsince the Solicitor General has been unable to identify even a single\nappointment made by Adams that filled a pre-recess vacancy. See\ninfra, at 36.\n32                     NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nspondent Noel Canning 1a\u201317a.11\n  Also illuminating is the way the Third Congress inter\u00ad\npreted the Constitution\u2019s Senate Vacancies Clause, which\nuses language similar to that of the Recess Appointments\nClause. Before the passage of the Seventeenth Amend\u00ad\nment, the Constitution provided that \u201cif Vacancies [in the\nSenate] happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the\nRecess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive\nthereof may make temporary Appointments until the next\nMeeting of the Legislature.\u201d Art. I, \u00a73, cl. 2. Senator\nGeorge Read of Delaware resigned in December 1793; the\nstate legislature met in January and February 1794; and\nthe Governor appointed Kensey Johns to fill the seat in\nMarch 1794. The Senate refused to seat Johns, resolving\nthat he was \u201cnot entitled to a seat in the Senate of the\nUnited States; a session of the Legislature of the said\nState having intervened, between the resignation . . . and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The majority suggests that these statutes may have reflected, not a\n\nbelief that the recess-appointment power was limited to vacancies\narising during the recess, but a \u201cseparate\u201d belief that the power could\nnot be used for \u201cnew offices\u201d created by Congress and not previously\nfilled. Ante, at 30. But the latter view (which the majority does not\nendorse) was inseparably linked with the former (which the majority\nrejects), as is made clear by the very source the majority cites. See\nLetter from Alexander Hamilton to James McHenry (May 3, 1799), in\n23 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 94 (H. Syrett ed. 1976) (\u201c[T]he power\nto fill the vacancy is not the power to make an original appointment.\nThe phrase \u2018Which may have happened\u2019 serves to confirm this construc\u00ad\ntion. . . . [I]ndependent of the authority of a special law, the President\ncannot fill a vacancy which happens during a session of the Senate\u201d);\nsee also 2 Op. Atty. Gen., at 334 (\u201cIf the vacancy exist during the\nsession of the Senate, as in the first creation of an office by law, it has\nbeen held that the President cannot appoint during the recess, unless\nhe is specially authorized so to do by law\u201d); W. Rawle, A View of the\nConstitution of the United States of America 163 (2d ed. 1829) (reprint\n2009) (\u201cIt has been held by [the Senate], that if new offices are created\nby congress, the president cannot, after the adjournment of the senate,\nmake appointments to fill them. The vacancies do not happen during\nthe recess of the senate\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           33\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe appointment.\u201d 4 Annals of Cong. 77\u201378 (1794). It is\nthus clear that the phrase \u201chappen . . . during the Recess\u201d\nin the Senate Vacancies Clause was understood to refer to\nvacancies that arose, not merely existed, during the recess\nin which the appointment was made. It is not apparent\nwhy the nearly identical language of the Recess Appoint\u00ad\nments Clause would have been understood differently.\n   The majority, however, relies heavily on a contrary\naccount of the Clause given by Attorney General William\nWirt in 1823. See 1 Op. Atty. Gen 631. Wirt notably\nbegan\u2014as does the majority\u2014by acknowledging that his\npredecessors\u2019 reading was \u201cmost accordant with the letter\nof the constitution.\u201d Id., at 632. But he thought the \u201cmost\nnatural\u201d reading had to be rejected because it would inter\u00ad\nfere with the \u201csubstantial purpose of the constitution,\u201d\nnamely, \u201ckeep[ing] . . . offices filled.\u201d Id., at 631\u2013632. He\nwas chiefly concerned that giving the Clause its plain\nmeaning would produce \u201cembarrassing inconveniences\u201d if\na distant office were to become vacant during the Senate\u2019s\nsession, but news of the vacancy were not to reach the\nPresident until the recess. Id., at 632, 634. The majority\nfully embraces Wirt\u2019s reasoning. Ante, at 22\u201325.\n   Wirt\u2019s argument is doubly flawed. To begin, the Consti\u00ad\ntution provides ample means, short of rewriting its text,\nfor dealing with the hypothetical dilemma Wirt posed.\nCongress can authorize \u201cacting\u201d officers to perform the\nduties associated with a temporarily vacant office\u2014and\nhas done that, in one form or another, since 1792. See 5\nU. S. C. \u00a73345; Act of May 8, 1792, ch. 37, \u00a78, 1 Stat. 281;\n705 F. 3d, at 511; Rappaport, Original Meaning 1514\u2013\n1517. And on \u201cextraordinary Occasions\u201d the President can\ncall the Senate back into session to consider a nomination.\nArt. II, \u00a73. If the Framers had thought those options\ninsufficient and preferred to authorize the President to\nmake recess appointments to fill vacancies arising late in\nthe session, they would have known how to do so.

NOEL CANNING\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nchusetts, for example, had authorized its Governor to\nmake certain recess appointments \u201cin case a vacancy shall\nhappen . . . in the recess of the General Court [i.e., the\nstate legislature], or at so late a period in any session of\nthe same Court, that the vacancy . . . shall not be supplied\nin the same session thereof.\u201d 1783 Mass. Acts ch. 12, in\nActs and Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\n523 (1890) (emphasis added).\n   The majority protests that acting appointments, unlike\nrecess appointments, are an \u201cinadequate\u201d solution to\nWirt\u2019s hypothetical dilemma because acting officers \u201cmay\nhave less authority than Presidential appointments.\u201d\nAnte, at 24\u201325. It cites an OLC opinion which states that\n\u201can acting officer . . . is frequently considered merely a\ncaretaker without a mandate to take far-reaching\nmeasures.\u201d 6 Op. OLC 119, 121 (1982). But just a few\nlines later, the majority says that \u201cthe lack of Senate\napproval . . . may diminish the recess appointee\u2019s ability,\nas a practical matter, to get a controversial job done.\u201d\nAnte, at 25. The majority does not explain why an acting\nofficer would have less authority \u201cas a practical matter\u201d\nthan a recess appointee. The majority also objects that\nrequiring the President to rely on acting officers would\n\u201clessen the President\u2019s ability to staff the Executive\nBranch with people of his own choosing,\u201d ante, at 24\u2014a\nsurprising charge, since that is the very purpose of the\nConstitution\u2019s advice-and-consent requirement. As for\nspecial sessions, the majority thinks it a sufficient answer\nto say that they are \u201cburdensome,\u201d ibid., an observation\nthat fails to distinguish them from many procedures re\u00ad\nquired by our structural Constitution.\n   More fundamentally, Wirt and the majority are mistaken\nto say that the Constitution\u2019s \u201c \u2018substantial purpose\u2019 \u201d is\nto \u201c \u2018keep . . . offices filled.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.

S., at\n957, 959. Wirt\u2019s and the majority\u2019s argumentum ab incon\u00ad\nvenienti thus proves far too much. There are many cir\u00ad\ncumstances other than a vacancy that can produce similar\ninconveniences if they arise late in the session: For exam\u00ad\nple, a natural disaster might occur to which the Executive\ncannot respond effectively without a supplemental appro\u00ad\npriation. But in those circumstances, the Constitution\nwould not permit the President to appropriate funds him\u00ad\nself. See Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 7. Congress must either anticipate\nsuch eventualities or be prepared to be haled back into\nsession. The troublesome need to do so is not a bug to be\nfixed by this Court, but a calculated feature of the consti\u00ad\ntutional framework. As we have recognized, while the\nConstitution\u2019s government-structuring provisions can\nseem \u201cclumsy\u201d and \u201cinefficient,\u201d they reflect \u201chard choices\n. . . consciously made by men who had lived under a form\nof government that permitted arbitrary governmental acts\nto go unchecked.\u201d Chadha, supra, at 959.\n                   B. Historical Practice\n   For the reasons just given, it is clear that the Constitu\u00ad\ntion authorizes the President to fill unilaterally only those\nvacancies that arise during a recess, not every vacancy\nthat happens to exist during a recess. Again, however, the\nmajority says \u201c[h]istorical practice\u201d requires the broader\ninterpretation. Ante, at 26. And again the majority\nis mistaken. Even if the Constitution were wrongly\nthought to be ambiguous on this point, a fair recounting\nof the relevant history does not support the majority\u2019s\ninterpretation.\n                    1. 1789 to 1822\n  The majority correctly admits that there is \u201cno undis\u00ad\nputed record of Presidents George Washington, John\n36                    NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nAdams, or Thomas Jefferson\u201d using a recess appointment\nto fill a pre-recess vacancy. Ibid. That is not surprising in\nlight of Randolph\u2019s early conclusion that doing so would be\nunconstitutional. Adams on one occasion contemplated\nfilling pre-recess vacancies but was dissuaded by, among\nothers, Attorney General Lee, who said the Constitution\ndid not permit him to do so. See 1799 McHenry Letter.12\nAnd the Solicitor General does not allege that even a\nsingle appointment made by Adams filled a pre-recess\nvacancy. Jefferson, too, at one point thought the Clause\n\u201csusceptible of \u201d the majority\u2019s reading, 1802 Jefferson\nLetter, but his administration, like Adams\u2019, appears never\nto have adopted that reading.\n   James Madison\u2019s administration seems to have rejected\nthe majority\u2019s reading as well. In 1814, Madison wanted\nto appoint Andrew Jackson to a vacant major-generalship\nin the Army during the Senate\u2019s recess, but he accepted,\nwithout contradiction or reservation, his Secretary of\nWar\u2019s advice that he lacked the power to do so because the\npost\u2019s previous occupant had resigned before the recess.\nHe therefore ordered that Jackson be given a \u201cbrevet of\nMajor General,\u201d i.e., a warrant conferring the nominal\nrank without the salary thereof.

In conveying the brevet, Mad\u00ad\nison\u2019s Secretary of War explained to Jackson that \u201c \u2018[t]he\nvacancy produced by General Hampton\u2019s resignation, not\nhaving been filled during the late session of the Senate,\ncannot be supplied constitutionally, during the recess.\u2019 \u201d\nLetter from Armstrong to Jackson (May 22, 1814). A week\nlater, when Madison learned that a different major gen\u00ad\neral had resigned during the recess, he thought that de\u00ad\nvelopment would enable him to appoint Jackson \u201cat once.\u201d\nLetter from Madison to Armstrong (May 24, 1814); see\nLetter from Armstrong to Madison (May 20, 1814) (report\u00ad\ning the resignation).13\n   The majority discounts that evidence of an occasion\nwhen Madison and his advisers actually considered the\nprecise constitutional question presented here. It does so\napparently because Madison, in acting on the advice he\nwas given without questioning the interpretation of the\nrecess-appointment power that was offered as the reason\nfor that advice, did not explicitly say \u201cI agree.\u201d The major\u00ad\nity prefers to focus on five appointments by Madison,\nunremarked by anyone at the time, that \u201cthe evidence\nsuggests\u201d filled pre-recess vacancies. Ante, at 27. Even if\nthe majority is correct about those appointments, there is\nno indication that any thought was given to their constitu\u00ad\ntionality, either within or outside the Executive Branch. A\nhandful of appointments that appear to contravene the\nwritten opinions of Attorneys General Randolph and Lee\nand the written evidence of Madison\u2019s own beliefs about\nwhat the Constitution authorized, and that lack any con\u00ad\ntemporaneous explanation, are not convincing evidence of\nthe Constitution\u2019s original meaning.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 All the letters cited in this paragraph are available online\n\ncourtesy of the Library of Congress.

NOEL CANNING\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  If Madison or his predecessors made any appointments\nin reliance on the broader reading, those appointments\nmust have escaped general notice. In 1822, the Senate\nCommittee on Military Affairs declared that the President\nhad \u201cno power to make [appointments] in the recess\u201d\nwhere \u201cthe vacancies did not happen in the recess.\u201d 38\nAnnals of Cong. 500. The Committee believed its con\u00ad\nstruction had been \u201cheretofore observed\u201d and that \u201cno\ninstance ha[d] before occurred . . . where the President\nha[d] felt himself authorized to fill such vacancies, without\nspecial authority by law.\u201d Ibid.; see also T. Sergeant,\nConstitutional Law 373 (2d ed. 1830) (\u201c[I]t seemed dis\u00ad\ntinctly understood to be the sense of the senate, that [it]\nis only in offices that become vacant during the recess,\nthat the president is authorised to exercise the right of\nappointing\u201d).\n                      2. 1823 to 1862\n   The Executive Branch did not openly depart from Ran\u00ad\ndolph and Lee\u2019s interpretation until 1823, when Wirt\nissued the opinion discussed earlier. Even within that\nbranch, Wirt\u2019s view was hotly contested: William Craw\u00ad\nford, Monroe\u2019s Treasury Secretary, argued \u201cwith great\npertinacity\u201d that the Clause authorized the President to\nfill only \u201cvacancies which happen during the recess\u201d and\nnot those \u201cwhich happen while Congress are in session.\u201d 5\nMemoirs of John Quincy Adams 486\u2013487 (C.

Noel Canning disputes that claim, point\u00ad\ning out that Washington told the Senate the offices in question had\n\u201c \u2018fallen vacant during the recess\u2019 \u201d and arguing that Jefferson may have\nremoved the incumbent officers during the recess. Brief for Respondent\nNoel Canning 44. Suffice it to say that if either Washington or Jeffer\u00ad\nson had adopted the broader reading, against the written advice of\nAttorneys General Randolph and Lee, one would expect a good deal\nmore evidence of that fact.\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

Atty. Gen. 333, 334. Two years\nlater, Attorney General Taney endorsed Wirt\u2019s view al\u00ad\nthough doing so was, as he acknowledged, unnecessary to\nresolve the issue before him: whether the President could,\nduring the recess, fill a vacancy resulting from the expira\u00ad\ntion of a prior recess appointment at the end of the Sen\u00ad\nate\u2019s session. 2 Op. Atty Gen. 525, 528 (1832). Addressing\nthe same issue in 1841, Attorney General Legar\u00e9 appeared\nto believe the dispositive question was whether the office\ncould be said to have \u201cbecom[e] vacant\u201d during the recess.\n3 Op. Atty. Gen. 673, 674. And in 1845, Attorney General\nMason thought it \u201cwell established\u201d that \u201c[i]f vacancies are\nknown to exist during the session of the Senate, and nom\u00ad\ninations are not then made, they cannot be filled by execu\u00ad\ntive appointments in the recess.\u201d 4 Op.

In reaching that conclusion, Mason reiterated that the\nrecess-appointment power \u201cdepends on the happening of vacancies\nwhen the Senate is not in session\u201d and said the vacancy at issue was\n\u201cwithin the meaning of\u201d the Clause because the happening of the\nvacancy and the termination of the session had \u201coccurred eo instanti.\u201d\n4 Op.

That is hardly an impressive\nnumber, and most of the appointments were to minor\noffices (like Deputy Postmaster for Janesville, Wisconsin,\nid., at 70a) unlikely to have gotten the Senate\u2019s attention.\nBut the Senate did notice when, in 1862, President Lin\u00ad\ncoln recess-appointed David Davis to fill a seat on this\nCourt that had become vacant before the recess, id., at\n71a\u2014and it reacted with vigor.\n                       3. 1863 to 1939\n  Two months after Lincoln\u2019s recess appointment of Davis,\nthe Senate directed the Judiciary Committee \u201cto inquire\nwhether the practice . . . of appointing officers to fill va\u00ad\ncancies which have not occurred during the recess of Con\u00ad\ngress, but which existed at the preceding session of Con\u00ad\ngress, is in accordance with the Constitution; and if not,\nwhat remedy shall be applied.\u201d Cong.

It may not be in our\n     power to prevent the appointment, but it is in our\n     power to prevent the payment; and when payment is\n     prevented, I think that will probably put an end to the\n     habit of making such appointments.\u201d Id., at 565.\nThe amendment was adopted by the Senate, ibid., and\nafter passing the House became the Pay Act, which pro\u00ad\nvided that \u201cno money shall be paid . . . out of the Treasury,\nas salary, to any person appointed during the recess of the\nSenate, to fill a vacancy . . . which . . . existed while the\nSenate was in session.\u201d Act of Feb. 9, 1863, \u00a72, 12 Stat.\n646 (codified at Rev.

Even more\nremarkably, the majority goes on to claim that the Sen\u00ad\nate\u2019s passage of the Pay Act on the same day the commit\u00ad\ntee issued its report was not a strong enough statement to\nimpede the constitutionalization-by-adverse-possession of\nthe power asserted by the Executive.

Because,\nthe majority says, some Senators may have disagreed with\nthe report, and because the Senate did not go so far as to\nmake acceptance of a recess appointment that filled a pre\u00ad\nrecess vacancy \u201ca federal crime.\u201d Ante, at 30\u201331.

And if the President fills a pre-recess\nvacancy under one of the circumstances specified in the\nAct, the law requires that he submit a nomination for that\noffice to the Senate \u201cnot later than 40 days after the be\u00ad\nginning of the next session.\u201d \u00a75503(b).\n   The majority says that by allowing salaries to be paid to\nrecess appointees in these narrow circumstances, \u201cthe\n1940 Senate (and later Senates) in effect supported\u201d the\nmajority\u2019s interpretation of the Clause. Ante, at 32. Non\u00ad\nsense. Even as amended, the Act strictly regulates pay\u00ad\nment to recess appointees who fill pre-recess vacancies,\nand it still forbids payment to many officers whose ap\u00ad\npointments are constitutional under the majority\u2019s inter\u00ad\npretation. As amici Senators observe, the 1940 amend\u00ad\nments \u201creflect at most a desire not to punish public\nservants caught in the crossfire\u201d of interbranch conflict.\nBrief for Sen. McConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 30. Surely\nthat inference is more reasonable than the majority\u2019s\nsupposition that Congress, by permitting some of the\nappointees covered by the Act to be paid, meant to signal\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           45\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat it now believed all of the covered appointments were\nvalid.\n   Moreover, given the majority\u2019s interpretation of the\nRecess Appointments Clause, it is fairly debatable whether\nthe current version of the Pay Act is constitutional (and\na fortiori, whether the pre-1940 version was constitutional).\nEven as amended, the Act seeks to limit and channel\nthe President\u2019s exercise of the recess-appointment power\nby prohibiting payment to officers whose appointments\nare (per the majority) within the President\u2019s sole constitu\u00ad\ntional authority if those appointments do not comply with\nconditions imposed by Congress, and by requiring the\nPresident to submit a nominee to the Senate in the first 40\ndays of the ensuing session. There is a colorable argu\u00ad\nment\u2014which is routinely made by lawyers in the Execu\u00ad\ntive Branch\u2014that Congress \u201c \u2018cannot use the appropria\u00ad\ntions power to control a Presidential power that is beyond\nits direct control.\u2019 \u201d 33 Op. OLC ___, ___ (2009), online\nat http://www.justice.gov/olc/opiniondocs/section7054.pdf\n(quoting 20 Op. OLC 253, 267 (1996)). Consistent with\nthat view, the Office of Legal Counsel has maintained that\nCongress could not \u201ccondition . . . the funding of an of\u00ad\nficer\u2019s salary on being allowed to appoint the officer.\u201d 13\nOp. OLC 258, 261 (1989).\n   If that is correct, then the Pay Act\u2019s attempt to control\nthe President\u2019s exercise of the recess-appointment power\nat least raises a substantial constitutional question under\nthe majority\u2019s reading of the Recess Appointments Clause.\nSee Rappaport, Original Meaning 1544\u20131546. The Execu\u00ad\ntive has not challenged the Act\u2019s constitutionality in this\ncase, and I express no opinion on whether such a challenge\nwould succeed. I simply point out that it is impossible to\nregard the amended Pay Act as evidence of Senatorial\nacquiescence in the majority\u2019s reading when that reading\nhas the potential to invalidate the Act.\n   Since the Pay Act was amended, individual Senators\n46                     NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nhave continued to maintain that recess appointments may\nnot constitutionally be used to fill pre-recess vacancies.\nSee, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec. 22780 (statement of seven Sena\u00ad\ntors that a recess appointment to the Federal Reserve\nBoard in 1984 was unconstitutional because the vacancy\n\u201cdid not happen during the recess\u201d); Brief for Sen.\nMcConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 26 (45 Senators taking\nthat view of the Clause). And there is no evidence that the\nwatering-down of the Pay Act produced an immediate\nflood of recess appointments filling pre-recess vacancies.\nThe Solicitor General has pointed us to only 40 such ap\u00ad\npointments between 1940 and the present. App. to Brief\nfor Petitioner 79a\u201389a.\n   The majority, however, finds it significant that in two\nsmall \u201crandom sample[s]\u201d of contemporary recess ap\u00ad\npointments\u201424 since 1981 and 21 since 2000\u2014the bulk of\nthe appointments appear to have filled pre-existing vacan\u00ad\ncies. Ante, at 29. Based on that evidence, the majority\nthinks it \u201ca fair inference that a large proportion of the\nrecess appointments in the history of the Nation have\nfilled pre-existing vacancies.\u201d Ibid. The extrapolation of\nthat sweeping conclusion from a small set of recent data\ndoes not bear even the slightest scrutiny. The majority\nignores two salient facts: First, from the founding until the\nmid-19th century, the President\u2019s authority to make such\nappointments was far from settled even within the Execu\u00ad\ntive Branch. Second, from 1863 until 1940, it was illegal\nto pay any recess appointee who filled a pre-recess va\u00ad\ncancy, which surely discouraged Presidents from making,\nand nominees from accepting, such appointments. Conse\u00ad\nquently, there is no reason to assume that the majority\u2019s\nsampling\u2014even if it accurately reflects practices during\nthe last three decades\u2014is at all typical of practices that\nprevailed throughout \u201cthe history of the Nation.\u201d17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 17 The   majority also notes that many of the intra-session recess ap\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   47\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                        *     *     *\n   In sum: Washington\u2019s and Adams\u2019 Attorneys General\nread the Constitution to restrict recess appointments to\nvacancies arising during the recess, and there is no evi\u00ad\ndence that any of the first four Presidents consciously\ndeparted from that reading. The contrary reading was\nfirst defended by an executive official in 1823, was vehe\u00ad\nmently rejected by the Senate in 1863, was vigorously\nresisted by legislation in place from 1863 until 1940, and\nis arguably inconsistent with legislation in place from\n1940 to the present. The Solicitor General has identified\nonly about 100 appointments that have ever been made\nunder the broader reading, and while it seems likely that\na good deal more have been made in the last few decades,\nthere is good reason to doubt that many were made before\n1940 (since the appointees could not have been compen\u00ad\nsated). I can conceive of no sane constitutional theory\nunder which this evidence of \u201chistorical practice\u201d\u2014which\nis actually evidence of a long-simmering inter-branch\nconflict\u2014would require us to defer to the views of the\nExecutive Branch.\n                   IV. Conclusion\n What the majority needs to sustain its judgment is an\nambiguous text and a clear historical practice. What it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npointments identified by the Solicitor General were made \u201cwithin two\nweeks of the beginning of the recess,\u201d which, according to the majority,\n\u201cstrongly suggests that many of the vacancies initially arose prior to\nthe recess.\u201d Ante, at 29. The inference is unwarranted, since there are\nmany circumstances other than random chance that could cause a\nvacancy to arise early in the recess: For example, the prior officeholder\nmay have been another recess appointee whose commission expired at\nthe end of the Senate\u2019s session, or he may have waited until the recess\nto resign so that his successor could be compensated without violating\nthe Pay Act. In any event, the overwhelming majority of the intra\u00ad\nsession recess appointments on the Solicitor General\u2019s list occurred\nafter 1945 and do not shed light on earlier practices.\n48                NLRB v. NOEL CANNING\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nhas is a clear text and an at-best-ambiguous historical\npractice. Even if the Executive could accumulate power\nthrough adverse possession by engaging in a consistent\nand unchallenged practice over a long period of time, the\noft-disputed practices at issue here would not meet that\nstandard. Nor have those practices created any justifiable\nexpectations that could be disappointed by enforcing the\nConstitution\u2019s original meaning. There is thus no ground\nfor the majority\u2019s deference to the unconstitutional recess\u00ad\nappointment practices of the Executive Branch.\n   The majority replaces the Constitution\u2019s text with a new\nset of judge-made rules to govern recess appointments.\nHenceforth, the Senate can avoid triggering the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s now-vast recess-appointment power by the odd\ncontrivance of never adjourning for more than three days\nwithout holding a pro forma session at which it is under\u00ad\nstood that no business will be conducted. Ante, at 33\u201334.\nHow this new regime will work in practice remains to be\nseen. Perhaps it will reduce the prevalence of recess\nappointments. But perhaps not: Members of the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s party in Congress may be able to prevent the Sen\u00ad\nate from holding pro forma sessions with the necessary\nfrequency, and if the House and Senate disagree, the\nPresident may be able to adjourn both \u201cto such Time as he\nshall think proper.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a73. In any event,\nthe limitation upon the President\u2019s appointment power is\nthere not for the benefit of the Senate, but for the protec\u00ad\ntion of the people; it should not be dependent on Senate\naction for its existence.\n   The real tragedy of today\u2019s decision is not simply the\nabolition of the Constitution\u2019s limits on the recess\u00ad\nappointment power and the substitution of a novel frame\u00ad\nwork invented by this Court. It is the damage done to our\nseparation-of-powers jurisprudence more generally. It is\nnot every day that we encounter a proper case or contro\u00ad\nversy requiring interpretation of the Constitution\u2019s struc\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           49\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntural provisions. Most of the time, the interpretation of\nthose provisions is left to the political branches\u2014which, in\ndeciding how much respect to afford the constitutional\ntext, often take their cues from this Court. We should\ntherefore take every opportunity to affirm the primacy of\nthe Constitution\u2019s enduring principles over the politics of\nthe moment. Our failure to do so today will resonate well\nbeyond the particular dispute at hand. Sad, but true: The\nCourt\u2019s embrace of the adverse-possession theory of execu\u00ad\ntive power (a characterization the majority resists but\ndoes not refute) will be cited in diverse contexts, including\nthose presently unimagined, and will have the effect of\naggrandizing the Presidency beyond its constitutional\nbounds and undermining respect for the separation of\npowers.\n   I concur in the judgment only.\n</pre>",
