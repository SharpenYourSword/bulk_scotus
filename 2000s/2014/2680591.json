COAKLEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n         OF MASSACHUSETTS, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12–1168. Argued January 15, 2014—Decided June 26, 2014\nIn 2007, Massachusetts amended its Reproductive Health Care Facili­\n  ties Act, which had been enacted in 2000 to address clashes between\n  abortion opponents and advocates of abortion rights outside clinics\n  where abortions were performed. The amended version of the Act\n  makes it a crime to knowingly stand on a “public way or sidewalk”\n  within 35 feet of an entrance or driveway to any “reproductive health\n  care facility,” defined as “a place, other than within or upon the\n  grounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered or performed.”\n  Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §§120E½(a), (b). The Act exempts from\n  this prohibition four classes of individuals, including “employees or\n  agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment.”\n  §120E½(b)(2). Another provision of the Act proscribes the knowing\n  obstruction of access to an abortion clinic. §120E½(e).\n     McCullen and the other petitioners are individuals who attempt to\n  engage women approaching Massachusetts abortion clinics in “side­\n  walk counseling,” which involves offering information about alterna­\n  tives to abortion and help pursuing those options. They claim that\n  the 35-foot buffer zones have displaced them from their previous po­\n  sitions outside the clinics, considerably hampering their counseling\n  efforts. Their attempts to communicate with patients are further\n  thwarted, they claim, by clinic “escorts,” who accompany arriving pa­\n  tients through the buffer zones to the clinic entrances.\n     Petitioners sued Attorney General Coakley and other Common­\n  wealth officials, seeking to enjoin the Act’s enforcement on the\n  ground that it violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, both\n  on its face and as applied to them. The District Court denied both\n  challenges, and the First Circuit affirmed. With regard to petition­\n2                        McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ers’ facial challenge, the First Circuit held that the Act was a reason­\n    able “time, place, and manner” regulation under the test set forth in\n    Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781.\nHeld: The Massachusetts Act violates the First Amendment. Pp. 8–30.\n    (a) By its very terms, the Act restricts access to “public way[s]” and\n “sidewalk[s],” places that have traditionally been open for speech ac­\n tivities and that the Court has accordingly labeled “traditional public\n fora,” Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 469. The gov­\n ernment’s ability to regulate speech in such locations is “very lim­\n ited.” United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177. “[E]ven in a public\n forum,” however, “the government may impose reasonable re­\n strictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided\n the restrictions ‘are justified without reference to the content of the\n regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a signifi­\n cant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alterna­\n tive channels for communication of the information,’ ” Ward, supra,\n at 791. Pp. 8–10.\n    (b) Because the Act is neither content nor viewpoint based, it need\n not be analyzed under strict scrutiny. Pp. 10–18.\n       (1) The Act is not content based simply because it establishes\n buffer zones only at abortion clinics, as opposed to other kinds of fa­\n cilities. First, the Act does not draw content-based distinctions on its\n face. Whether petitioners violate the Act “depends” not “on what\n they say,” Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U. S. 1, 27, but\n on where they say it. Second, even if a facially neutral law dispropor­\n tionately affects speech on certain topics, it remains content neutral\n so long as it is “ ‘justified without reference to the content of the regu­\n lated speech.’ ” Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48.\n The Act’s purposes include protecting public safety, patient access to\n healthcare, and unobstructed use of public sidewalks and streets.\n The Court has previously deemed all these concerns to be content\n neutral. See Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321. An intent to single\n out for regulation speech about abortion cannot be inferred from the\n Act’s limited scope. “States adopt laws to address the problems that\n confront them.” Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 207. There was a\n record of crowding, obstruction, and even violence outside Massachu­\n setts abortion clinics but not at other kinds of facilities in the Com­\n monwealth. Pp. 11–15.\n       (2) The Act’s exemption for clinic employees and agents acting\n within the scope of their employment does not appear to be an at­\n tempt to favor one viewpoint about abortion over the other. City of\n Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 51, distinguished. Given that some\n kind of exemption was necessary to allow individuals who work at\n the clinics to enter or remain within the buffer zones, the “scope of\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nemployment” qualification simply ensures that the exemption is lim­\nited to its purpose of allowing the employees to do their jobs. Even\nassuming that some clinic escorts have expressed their views on\nabortion inside the zones, the record does not suggest that such\nspeech was within the scope of the escorts’ employment. If it turned\nout that a particular clinic authorized its employees to speak about\nabortion in the buffer zones, that would support an as-applied chal­\nlenge to the zones at that clinic. Pp. 15–18.\n   (c) Although the Act is content neutral, it is not “narrowly tailored”\nbecause it “burden[s] substantially more speech than is necessary to\nfurther the government’s legitimate interests.” Ward, 491 U. S., at\n799. Pp. 18–29.\n      (1) The buffer zones serve the Commonwealth’s legitimate inter­\nests in maintaining public safety on streets and sidewalks and in\npreserving access to adjacent reproductive healthcare facilities. See\nSchenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y., 519 U. S. 357, 376.\nAt the same time, however, they impose serious burdens on petition­\ners’ speech, depriving them of their two primary methods of com­\nmunicating with arriving patients: close, personal conversations and\ndistribution of literature. Those forms of expression have historically\nbeen closely associated with the transmission of ideas. While the Act\nmay allow petitioners to “protest” outside the buffer zones, petition­\ners are not protestors; they seek not merely to express their opposi­\ntion to abortion, but to engage in personal, caring, consensual conver­\nsations with women about various alternatives. It is thus no answer\nto say that petitioners can still be seen and heard by women within\nthe buffer zones. If all that the women can see and hear are vocifer­\nous opponents of abortion, then the buffer zones have effectively sti­\nfled petitioners’ message. Pp. 19–23.\n      (2) The buffer zones burden substantially more speech than nec­\nessary to achieve the Commonwealth’s asserted interests. Subsection\n(e) of the Act already prohibits deliberate obstruction of clinic en­\ntrances. Massachusetts could also enact legislation similar to the\nfederal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, 18 U. S. C.\n§248(a)(1), which imposes criminal and civil sanctions for obstruct­\ning, intimidating, or interfering with persons obtaining or providing\nreproductive health services. Obstruction of clinic driveways can\nreadily be addressed through existing local traffic ordinances. While\nthe Commonwealth contends that individuals can inadvertently ob­\nstruct access to clinics simply by gathering in large numbers, that\nproblem could be addressed through a law requiring crowds blocking\na clinic entrance to disperse for a limited period when ordered to do\nso by the police. In any event, crowding appears to be a problem only\nat the Boston clinic, and even there, only on Saturday mornings.\n4                        McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       The Commonwealth has not shown that it seriously undertook to\n    address these various problems with the less intrusive tools readily\n    available to it. It identifies not a single prosecution or injunction\n    against individuals outside abortion clinics since the 1990s. The\n    Commonwealth responds that the problems are too widespread for\n    individual prosecutions and injunctions to be effective. But again,\n    the record indicates that the problems are limited principally to the\n    Boston clinic on Saturday mornings, and the police there appear per­\n    fectly capable of singling out lawbreakers. The Commonwealth also\n    claims that it would be difficult to prove intentional or deliberate ob­\n    struction or intimidation and that the buffer zones accordingly make\n    the police’s job easier. To meet the narrow tailoring requirement,\n    however, the government must demonstrate that alternative\n    measures that burden substantially less speech would fail to achieve\n    the government’s interests, not simply that the chosen route is easier.\n    In any event, to determine whether someone intends to block access\n    to a clinic, a police officer need only order him to move; if he refuses,\n    then there is no question that his continued conduct is knowing or in­\n    tentional. For similar reasons, the Commonwealth’s reliance on Bur-\n    son v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, is misplaced. There, the Court upheld\n    a law establishing buffer zones outside polling places on the ground\n    that less restrictive measures were inadequate. But whereas “[v]oter\n    intimidation and election fraud” are “difficult to detect,” id., at 208,\n    obstruction and harassment at abortion clinics are anything but sub­\n    tle. And while the police “generally are barred from the vicinity of\n    the polls to avoid any appearance of coercion in the electoral process,”\n    id., at 207, they maintain a significant presence outside Massachu­\n    setts abortion clinics. In short, given the vital First Amendment in­\n    terests at stake, it is not enough for Massachusetts simply to say that\n    other approaches have not worked.

Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266,\n§§120E½(a), (b) (West 2012). Petitioners are individuals\nwho approach and talk to women outside such facilities,\nattempting to dissuade them from having abortions. The\nstatute prevents petitioners from doing so near the facili­\nties’ entrances. The question presented is whether the\nstatute violates the First Amendment.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  In 2000, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted the\nMassachusetts Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act,\nMass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½ (West 2000). The law\nwas designed to address clashes between abortion oppo­\nnents and advocates of abortion rights that were occurring\noutside clinics where abortions were performed. The Act\n2                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nestablished a defined area with an 18-foot radius around\nthe entrances and driveways of such facilities. §120E½(b).\nAnyone could enter that area, but once within it, no one\n(other than certain exempt individuals) could knowingly\napproach within six feet of another person—unless that\nperson consented—“for the purpose of passing a leaflet or\nhandbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral pro­\ntest, education, or counseling with such other person.”\nIbid. A separate provision subjected to criminal punish­\nment anyone who “knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders,\nimpedes or blocks another person’s entry to or exit from a\nreproductive health care facility.” §120E½(e).\n   The statute was modeled on a similar Colorado law that\nthis Court had upheld in Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703\n(2000). Relying on Hill, the United States Court of Ap­\npeals for the First Circuit sustained the Massachusetts\nstatute against a First Amendment challenge. McGuire v.\nReilly, 386 F. 3d 45 (2004) (McGuire II), cert. denied, 544\nU. S. 974 (2005); McGuire v. Reilly, 260 F. 3d 36 (2001)\n(McGuire I).\n   By 2007, some Massachusetts legislators and law en­\nforcement officials had come to regard the 2000 statute as\ninadequate. At legislative hearings, multiple witnesses\nrecounted apparent violations of the law. Massachusetts\nAttorney General Martha Coakley, for example, testified\nthat protestors violated the statute “on a routine basis.”\nApp. 78. To illustrate this claim, she played a video de­\npicting protestors approaching patients and clinic staff\nwithin the buffer zones, ostensibly without the latter\nindividuals’ consent. Clinic employees and volunteers also\ntestified that protestors congregated near the doors and in\nthe driveways of the clinics, with the result that prospec­\ntive patients occasionally retreated from the clinics rather\nthan try to make their way to the clinic entrances or park­\ning lots.\n   Captain William B. Evans of the Boston Police Depart­\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment, however, testified that his officers had made “no\nmore than five or so arrests” at the Planned Parenthood\nclinic in Boston and that what few prosecutions had been\nbrought were unsuccessful. Id., at 68–69. Witnesses\nattributed the dearth of enforcement to the difficulty of\npolicing the six-foot no-approach zones. Captain Evans\ntestified that the 18-foot zones were so crowded with\nprotestors that they resembled “a goalie’s crease,” making\nit hard to determine whether a protestor had deliberately\napproached a patient or, if so, whether the patient had\nconsented. Id., at 69–71. For similar reasons, Attorney\nGeneral Coakley concluded that the six-foot no-approach\nzones were “unenforceable.” Id., at 79. What the police\nneeded, she said, was a fixed buffer zone around clinics\nthat protestors could not enter. Id., at 74, 76. Captain\nEvans agreed, explaining that such a zone would “make\nour job so much easier.” Id., at 68.\n   To address these concerns, the Massachusetts Legisla­\nture amended the statute in 2007, replacing the six-foot\nno-approach zones (within the 18-foot area) with a 35-foot\nfixed buffer zone from which individuals are categorically\nexcluded. The statute now provides:\n    “No person shall knowingly enter or remain on a pub­\n    lic way or sidewalk adjacent to a reproductive health\n    care facility within a radius of 35 feet of any portion of\n    an entrance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health\n    care facility or within the area within a rectangle cre­\n    ated by extending the outside boundaries of any en­\n    trance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health care\n    facility in straight lines to the point where such lines\n    intersect the sideline of the street in front of such en­\n    trance, exit or driveway.” Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266,\n    §120E½(b) (West 2012).\nA “reproductive health care facility,” in turn, is defined as\n“a place, other than within or upon the grounds of a hospi­\n4                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntal, where abortions are offered or performed.” §120E½(a).\n  The 35-foot buffer zone applies only “during a facility’s\nbusiness hours,” and the area must be “clearly marked\nand posted.” §120E½(c). In practice, facilities typically\nmark the zones with painted arcs and posted signs on\nadjacent sidewalks and streets. A first violation of the\nstatute is punishable by a fine of up to $500, up to three\nmonths in prison, or both, while a subsequent offense is\npunishable by a fine of between $500 and $5,000, up to\ntwo and a half years in prison, or both. §120E½(d).\n  The Act exempts four classes of individuals: (1) “persons\nentering or leaving such facility”; (2) “employees or agents\nof such facility acting within the scope of their employ­\nment”; (3) “law enforcement, ambulance, firefighting,\nconstruction, utilities, public works and other municipal\nagents acting within the scope of their employment”; and\n(4) “persons using the public sidewalk or street right-\nof-way adjacent to such facility solely for the purpose\nof reaching a destination other than such facility.”\n§120E½(b)(1)–(4). The legislature also retained the sepa­\nrate provision from the 2000 version that proscribes the\nknowing obstruction of access to a facility. §120E½(e).\n                              B\n   Some of the individuals who stand outside Massachu­\nsetts abortion clinics are fairly described as protestors,\nwho express their moral or religious opposition to abortion\nthrough signs and chants or, in some cases, more aggres­\nsive methods such as face-to-face confrontation. Petition­\ners take a different tack. They attempt to engage women\napproaching the clinics in what they call “sidewalk coun­\nseling,” which involves offering information about alterna­\ntives to abortion and help pursuing those options. Peti­\ntioner Eleanor McCullen, for instance, will typically\ninitiate a conversation this way: “Good morning, may I\ngive you my literature? Is there anything I can do for you?\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nI’m available if you have any questions.” App. 138. If the\nwoman seems receptive, McCullen will provide additional\ninformation. McCullen and the other petitioners consider\nit essential to maintain a caring demeanor, a calm tone of\nvoice, and direct eye contact during these exchanges.\nSuch interactions, petitioners believe, are a much more\neffective means of dissuading women from having abor­\ntions than confrontational methods such as shouting or\nbrandishing signs, which in petitioners’ view tend only to\nantagonize their intended audience. In unrefuted testi­\nmony, petitioners say they have collectively persuaded\nhundreds of women to forgo abortions.\n   The buffer zones have displaced petitioners from their\nprevious positions outside the clinics. McCullen offers\ncounseling outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Boston,\nas do petitioners Jean Zarrella and Eric Cadin. Petitioner\nGregory Smith prays the rosary there. The clinic occupies\nits own building on a street corner. Its main door is re­\ncessed into an open foyer, approximately 12 feet back from\nthe public sidewalk. Before the Act was amended to cre­\nate the buffer zones, petitioners stood near the entryway\nto the foyer. Now a buffer zone—marked by a painted arc\nand a sign—surrounds the entrance. This zone extends 23\nfeet down the sidewalk in one direction, 26 feet in the\nother, and outward just one foot short of the curb. The\nclinic’s entrance adds another seven feet to the width of\nthe zone. Id., at 293–295. The upshot is that petitioners\nare effectively excluded from a 56-foot-wide expanse of the\npublic sidewalk in front of the clinic.1\n   Petitioners Mark Bashour and Nancy Clark offer coun­\nseling and information outside a Planned Parenthood\nclinic in Worcester. Unlike the Boston clinic, the Worces­\n——————\n  1 The zone could have extended an additional 21 feet in width under\n\nthe Act. Only the smaller area was marked off, however, so only that\narea has legal effect. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(c).\n6                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nter clinic sits well back from the public street and side­\nwalks. Patients enter the clinic in one of two ways. Those\narriving on foot turn off the public sidewalk and walk\ndown a nearly 54-foot-long private walkway to the main\nentrance. More than 85% of patients, however, arrive by\ncar, turning onto the clinic’s driveway from the street,\nparking in a private lot, and walking to the main entrance\non a private walkway.\n   Bashour and Clark would like to stand where the pri­\nvate walkway or driveway intersects the sidewalk and\noffer leaflets to patients as they walk or drive by. But a\npainted arc extends from the private walkway 35 feet\ndown the sidewalk in either direction and outward nearly\nto the curb on the opposite side of the street. Another arc\nsurrounds the driveway’s entrance, covering more than 93\nfeet of the sidewalk (including the width of the driveway)\nand extending across the street and nearly six feet onto\nthe sidewalk on the opposite side. Id., at 295–297. Bash­\nour and Clark must now stand either some distance down\nthe sidewalk from the private walkway and driveway or\nacross the street.\n   Petitioner Cyril Shea stands outside a Planned\nParenthood clinic in Springfield, which, like the Worcester\nclinic, is set back from the public streets. Approximately\n90% of patients arrive by car and park in the private lots\nsurrounding the clinic. Shea used to position himself at\nan entrance to one of the five driveways leading to the\nparking lots. Painted arcs now surround the entrances,\neach spanning approximately 100 feet of the sidewalk\nparallel to the street (again, including the width of the\ndriveways) and extending outward well into the street.\nId., at 297–299. Like petitioners at the Worcester clinic,\nShea now stands far down the sidewalk from the driveway\nentrances.\n   Petitioners at all three clinics claim that the buffer\nzones have considerably hampered their counseling ef­\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforts. Although they have managed to conduct some coun­\nseling and to distribute some literature outside the buffer\nzones—particularly at the Boston clinic—they say they\nhave had many fewer conversations and distributed many\nfewer leaflets since the zones went into effect. Id., at 136–\n137, 180, 200.\n  The second statutory exemption allows clinic employees\nand agents acting within the scope of their employment to\nenter the buffer zones. Relying on this exemption, the\nBoston clinic uses “escorts” to greet women as they ap­\nproach the clinic, accompanying them through the zones to\nthe clinic entrance. Petitioners claim that the escorts\nsometimes thwart petitioners’ attempts to communicate\nwith patients by blocking petitioners from handing litera­\nture to patients, telling patients not to “pay any attention”\nor “listen to” petitioners, and disparaging petitioners as\n“crazy.” Id., at 165, 178.\n                             C\n   In January 2008, petitioners sued Attorney General\nCoakley and other Commonwealth officials.

Gen.\nLaws, ch. 266, §120E½(b) (Supp. 2007). Such areas occupy\na “special position in terms of First Amendment protec­\ntion” because of their historic role as sites for discussion\nand debate. United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 180\n(1983). These places—which we have labeled “traditional\npublic fora”—“ ‘have immemorially been held in trust for\nthe use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used\nfor purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts be­\ntween citizens, and discussing public questions.’ ” Pleas-\nant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 469 (2009)\n(quoting Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators’ Assn.,\n460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983)).\n   It is no accident that public streets and sidewalks have\ndeveloped as venues for the exchange of ideas. Even\ntoday, they remain one of the few places where a speaker\ncan be confident that he is not simply preaching to the\nchoir. With respect to other means of communication, an\nindividual confronted with an uncomfortable message can\nalways turn the page, change the channel, or leave the\nWeb site. Not so on public streets and sidewalks. There, a\nlistener often encounters speech he might otherwise tune\nout. In light of the First Amendment’s purpose “to pre­\nserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwill ultimately prevail,” FCC v. League of Women Voters of\nCal., 468 U. S. 364, 377 (1984) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), this aspect of traditional public fora is a virtue,\nnot a vice.\n    In short, traditional public fora are areas that have\nhistorically been open to the public for speech activities.\nThus, even though the Act says nothing about speech on\nits face, there is no doubt—and respondents do not dis­\npute—that it restricts access to traditional public fora and\nis therefore subject to First Amendment scrutiny. See\nBrief for Respondents 26 (although “[b]y its terms, the Act\nregulates only conduct,” it “incidentally regulates the\nplace and time of protected speech”).\n    Consistent with the traditionally open character of\npublic streets and sidewalks, we have held that the gov­\nernment’s ability to restrict speech in such locations is\n“very limited.” Grace, supra, at 177. In particular, the\nguiding First Amendment principle that the “government\nhas no power to restrict expression because of its message,\nits ideas, its subject matter, or its content” applies with\nfull force in a traditional public forum. Police Dept. of\nChicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972). As a general\nrule, in such a forum the government may not “selectively\n. . . shield the public from some kinds of speech on the\nground that they are more offensive than others.”\nErznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 209 (1975).\n    We have, however, afforded the government somewhat\nwider leeway to regulate features of speech unrelated to\nits content. “[E]ven in a public forum the government may\nimpose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or man­\nner of protected speech, provided the restrictions ‘are\njustified without reference to the content of the regulated\nspeech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a signifi­\ncant governmental interest, and that they leave open\nample alternative channels for communication of the\ninformation.’ ” Ward, 491 U. S., at 791 (quoting Clark v.\n10                     McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCommunity for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293\n(1984)).2\n  While the parties agree that this test supplies the\nproper framework for assessing the constitutionality of the\nMassachusetts Act, they disagree about whether the Act\nsatisfies the test’s three requirements.\n                             III\n   Petitioners contend that the Act is not content neutral\nfor two independent reasons: First, they argue that it\ndiscriminates against abortion-related speech because it\nestablishes buffer zones only at clinics that perform abor­\ntions. Second, petitioners contend that the Act, by ex­\nempting clinic employees and agents, favors one viewpoint\nabout abortion over the other. If either of these argu­\nments is correct, then the Act must satisfy strict scruti­\nny—that is, it must be the least restrictive means of\nachieving a compelling state interest. See United States v.\nPlayboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813\n(2000). Respondents do not argue that the Act can survive\nthis exacting standard.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA objects to our decision to consider\nwhether the statute is content based and thus subject to\nstrict scrutiny, given that we ultimately conclude that it is\nnot narrowly tailored. Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). But we think it unexceptional to perform the\nfirst part of a multipart constitutional analysis first. The\ncontent-neutrality prong of the Ward test is logically\nantecedent to the narrow-tailoring prong, because it de­\ntermines the appropriate level of scrutiny. It is not unu­\nsual for the Court to proceed sequentially in applying a\n——————\n  2 A different analysis would of course be required if the government\n\nproperty at issue were not a traditional public forum but instead “a\nforum that is limited to use by certain groups or dedicated solely to the\ndiscussion of certain subjects.” Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555\nU. S. 460, 470 (2009).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstitutional test, even when the preliminary steps turn\nout not to be dispositive. See, e.g., Bartnicki v. Vopper,\n532 U. S. 514, 526–527 (2001); Holder v. Humanitarian\nLaw Project, 561 U. S. 1, 25–28 (2010) (concluding that a\nlaw was content based even though it ultimately survived\nstrict scrutiny).\n   The Court does sometimes assume, without deciding,\nthat a law is subject to a less stringent level of scrutiny, as\nwe did earlier this Term in McCutcheon v. Federal Elec-\ntion Commission, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (plurality opin­\nion) (slip op., at 10). But the distinction between that case\nand this one seems clear: Applying any standard of review\nother than intermediate scrutiny in McCutcheon—the\nstandard that was assumed to apply—would have re­\nquired overruling a precedent. There is no similar reason\nto forgo the ordinary order of operations in this case.\n   At the same time, there is good reason to address con­\ntent neutrality. In discussing whether the Act is narrowly\ntailored, see Part IV, infra, we identify a number of less­\nrestrictive alternative measures that the Massachusetts\nLegislature might have adopted. Some apply only at\nabortion clinics, which raises the question whether those\nprovisions are content neutral. See infra, at 12–15. While\nwe need not (and do not) endorse any of those measures, it\nwould be odd to consider them as possible alternatives if\nthey were presumptively unconstitutional because they\nwere content based and thus subject to strict scrutiny.\n                                A\n  The Act applies only at a “reproductive health care\nfacility,” defined as “a place, other than within or upon the\ngrounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered or per­\nformed.” Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(a). Given\nthis definition, petitioners argue, “virtually all speech\naffected by the Act is speech concerning abortion,” thus\nrendering the Act content based. Brief for Petitioners 23.\n12                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   We disagree. To begin, the Act does not draw content­\nbased distinctions on its face. Contrast Boos v. Barry, 485\nU. S. 312, 315 (1988) (ordinance prohibiting the display\nwithin 500 feet of a foreign embassy of any sign that tends\nto bring the foreign government into “ ‘public odium’ ” or\n“ ‘public disrepute’ ”); Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 465\n(1980) (statute prohibiting all residential picketing except\n“peaceful labor picketing”). The Act would be content\nbased if it required “enforcement authorities” to “examine\nthe content of the message that is conveyed to determine\nwhether” a violation has occurred. League of Women\nVoters of Cal., supra, at 383. But it does not. Whether\npetitioners violate the Act “depends” not “on what they\nsay,” Humanitarian Law Project, supra, at 27, but simply\non where they say it. Indeed, petitioners can violate the\nAct merely by standing in a buffer zone, without display­\ning a sign or uttering a word.\n   It is true, of course, that by limiting the buffer zones to\nabortion clinics, the Act has the “inevitable effect” of re­\nstricting abortion-related speech more than speech on\nother subjects. Brief for Petitioners 24 (quoting United\nStates v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 384 (1968)). But a facially\nneutral law does not become content based simply be-\ncause it may disproportionately affect speech on certain\ntopics. On the contrary, “[a] regulation that serves pur­\nposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed\nneutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speak­\ners or messages but not others.” Ward, supra, at 791. The\nquestion in such a case is whether the law is “ ‘justified\nwithout reference to the content of the regulated speech.’ ”\nRenton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48 (1986)\n(quoting Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens\nConsumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976); empha­\nsis deleted).\n   The Massachusetts Act is. Its stated purpose is to “in­\ncrease forthwith public safety at reproductive health care\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfacilities.” 2007 Mass. Acts p. 660. Respondents have\narticulated similar purposes before this Court—namely,\n“public safety, patient access to healthcare, and the unob­\nstructed use of public sidewalks and roadways.” Brief for\nRespondents 27; see, e.g., App. 51 (testimony of Attorney\nGeneral Coakley); id., at 67–70 (testimony of Captain\nWilliam B. Evans of the Boston Police); id., at 79–80 (tes­\ntimony of Mary Beth Heffernan, Undersecretary for Crim­\ninal Justice); id., at 122–124 (affidavit of Captain Evans).\nIt is not the case that “[e]very objective indication shows\nthat the provision’s primary purpose is to restrict speech\nthat opposes abortion.” Post, at 7.\n   We have previously deemed the foregoing concerns to be\ncontent neutral. See Boos, 485 U. S., at 321 (identifying\n“congestion,” “interference with ingress or egress,” and\n“the need to protect . . . security” as content-neutral con­\ncerns). Obstructed access and congested sidewalks are\nproblems no matter what caused them. A group of indi­\nviduals can obstruct clinic access and clog sidewalks just\nas much when they loiter as when they protest abortion or\ncounsel patients.\n   To be clear, the Act would not be content neutral if it\nwere concerned with undesirable effects that arise from\n“the direct impact of speech on its audience” or “[l]isteners’\nreactions to speech.” Ibid. If, for example, the speech\noutside Massachusetts abortion clinics caused offense or\nmade listeners uncomfortable, such offense or discomfort\nwould not give the Commonwealth a content-neutral\njustification to restrict the speech. All of the problems\nidentified by the Commonwealth here, however, arise\nirrespective of any listener’s reactions. Whether or not a\nsingle person reacts to abortion protestors’ chants or peti­\ntioners’ counseling, large crowds outside abortion clinics\ncan still compromise public safety, impede access, and\nobstruct sidewalks.\n   Petitioners do not really dispute that the Common­\n14                McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwealth’s interests in ensuring safety and preventing ob­\nstruction are, as a general matter, content neutral. But\npetitioners note that these interests “apply outside every\nbuilding in the State that hosts any activity that might\noccasion protest or comment,” not just abortion clinics.\nBrief for Petitioners 24. By choosing to pursue these\ninterests only at abortion clinics, petitioners argue, the\nMassachusetts Legislature evinced a purpose to “single[ ]\nout for regulation speech about one particular topic: abor­\ntion.” Reply Brief 9.\n   We cannot infer such a purpose from the Act’s limited\nscope. The broad reach of a statute can help confirm that\nit was not enacted to burden a narrower category of disfa­\nvored speech. See Kagan, Private Speech, Public Purpose:\nThe Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment\nDoctrine, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 413, 451–452 (1996). At the\nsame time, however, “States adopt laws to address the\nproblems that confront them. The First Amendment does\nnot require States to regulate for problems that do not\nexist.” Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 207 (1992)\n(plurality opinion).       The Massachusetts Legislature\namended the Act in 2007 in response to a problem that\nwas, in its experience, limited to abortion clinics. There\nwas a record of crowding, obstruction, and even violence\noutside such clinics. There were apparently no similar\nrecurring problems associated with other kinds of\nhealthcare facilities, let alone with “every building in the\nState that hosts any activity that might occasion protest\nor comment.” Brief for Petitioners 24. In light of the\nlimited nature of the problem, it was reasonable for the\nMassachusetts Legislature to enact a limited solution.\nWhen selecting among various options for combating a\nparticular problem, legislatures should be encouraged to\nchoose the one that restricts less speech, not more.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA objects that the statute does restrict\nmore speech than necessary, because “only one [Massa­\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchusetts abortion clinic] is known to have been beset by\nthe problems that the statute supposedly addresses.”\nPost, at 7. But there are no grounds for inferring content­\nbased discrimination here simply because the legislature\nacted with respect to abortion facilities generally rather\nthan proceeding on a facility-by-facility basis. On these\nfacts, the poor fit noted by JUSTICE SCALIA goes to the\nquestion of narrow tailoring, which we consider below.\nSee infra, at 26–28.\n                              B\n   Petitioners also argue that the Act is content based\nbecause it exempts four classes of individuals, Mass. Gen.\nLaws, ch. 266, §§120E½(b)(1)–(4), one of which comprises\n“employees or agents of [a reproductive healthcare] facil-\nity acting within the scope of their employment.”\n§120E½(b)(2). This exemption, petitioners say, favors one\nside in the abortion debate and thus constitutes viewpoint\ndiscrimination—an “egregious form of content discrimina­\ntion,” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,\n515 U. S. 819, 829 (1995). In particular, petitioners argue\nthat the exemption allows clinic employees and agents—\nincluding the volunteers who “escort” patients arriving at\nthe Boston clinic—to speak inside the buffer zones.\n   It is of course true that “an exemption from an other­\nwise permissible regulation of speech may represent a\ngovernmental ‘attempt to give one side of a debatable\npublic question an advantage in expressing its views to\nthe people.’ ” City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 51\n(1994) (quoting First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435\nU. S. 765, 785–786 (1978)). At least on the record before\nus, however, the statutory exemption for clinic employees\nand agents acting within the scope of their employment\ndoes not appear to be such an attempt.\n   There is nothing inherently suspect about providing\nsome kind of exemption to allow individuals who work at\n16                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe clinics to enter or remain within the buffer zones. In\nparticular, the exemption cannot be regarded as simply a\ncarve-out for the clinic escorts; it also covers employees\nsuch as the maintenance worker shoveling a snowy side­\nwalk or the security guard patrolling a clinic entrance, see\nApp. 95 (affidavit of Michael T. Baniukiewicz).\n   Given the need for an exemption for clinic employees,\nthe “scope of their employment” qualification simply en­\nsures that the exemption is limited to its purpose of allow­\ning the employees to do their jobs. It performs the same\nfunction as the identical “scope of their employment”\nrestriction on the exemption for “law enforcement, ambu­\nlance, fire-fighting, construction, utilities, public works\nand other municipal agents.” §120E½(b)(3). Contrary to\nthe suggestion of JUSTICE SCALIA, post, at 11–12, there is\nlittle reason to suppose that the Massachusetts Legisla­\nture intended to incorporate a common law doctrine devel­\noped for determining vicarious liability in tort when it\nused the phrase “scope of their employment” for the wholly\ndifferent purpose of defining the scope of an exemption to\na criminal statute. The limitation instead makes clear—\nwith respect to both clinic employees and municipal\nagents—that exempted individuals are allowed inside the\nzones only to perform those acts authorized by their em­\nployers. There is no suggestion in the record that any of\nthe clinics authorize their employees to speak about abor­\ntion in the buffer zones. The “scope of their employment”\nlimitation thus seems designed to protect against exactly\nthe sort of conduct that petitioners and JUSTICE SCALIA\nfear.\n   Petitioners did testify in this litigation about instances\nin which escorts at the Boston clinic had expressed views\nabout abortion to the women they were accompanying,\nthwarted petitioners’ attempts to speak and hand litera­\nture to the women, and disparaged petitioners in various\nways. See App. 165, 168–169, 177–178, 189–190. It is\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nunclear from petitioners’ testimony whether these alleged\nincidents occurred within the buffer zones. There is no\nviewpoint discrimination problem if the incidents occurred\noutside the zones because petitioners are equally free to\nsay whatever they would like in that area.\n  Even assuming the incidents occurred inside the zones,\nthe record does not suggest that they involved speech\nwithin the scope of the escorts’ employment. If the speech\nwas beyond the scope of their employment, then each of\nthe alleged incidents would violate the Act’s express\nterms. Petitioners’ complaint would then be that the\npolice were failing to enforce the Act equally against clinic\nescorts. Cf. Hoye v. City of Oakland, 653 F. 3d 835, 849–\n852 (CA9 2011) (finding selective enforcement of a similar\nordinance in Oakland, California). While such allegations\nmight state a claim of official viewpoint discrimination,\nthat would not go to the validity of the Act. In any event,\npetitioners nowhere allege selective enforcement.\n  It would be a very different question if it turned out that\na clinic authorized escorts to speak about abortion inside\nthe buffer zones. See post, at 1–2 (ALITO, J., concurring in\njudgment). In that case, the escorts would not seem to be\nviolating the Act because the speech would be within the\nscope of their employment.3 The Act’s exemption for clinic\n——————\n  3 Less than two weeks after the instant litigation was initiated, the\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General’s Office issued a guidance letter\nclarifying the application of the four exemptions. The letter interpreted\nthe exemptions as not permitting clinic employees or agents, municipal\nemployees or agents, or individuals passing by clinics “to express their\nviews about abortion or to engage in any other partisan speech within\nthe buffer zone.” App. 93, 93–94. While this interpretation supports\nour conclusion that the employee exemption does not render the Act\nviewpoint based, we do not consider it in our analysis because it ap­\npears to broaden the scope of the Act—a criminal statute—rather than\nto adopt a “ ‘limiting construction.’ ” Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491\nU. S. 781, 796 (1989) (quoting Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman\nEstates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 494, n. 5 (1982)).\n18                     McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nemployees would then facilitate speech on only one side of\nthe abortion debate—a clear form of viewpoint discrimina­\ntion that would support an as-applied challenge to the\nbuffer zone at that clinic. But the record before us con­\ntains insufficient evidence to show that the exemption\noperates in this way at any of the clinics, perhaps because\nthe clinics do not want to doom the Act by allowing their\nemployees to speak about abortion within the buffer\nzones.4\n   We thus conclude that the Act is neither content nor\nviewpoint based and therefore need not be analyzed under\nstrict scrutiny.\n                            IV\n   Even though the Act is content neutral, it still must be\n“narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental\ninterest.” Ward, 491 U. S., at 796 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The tailoring requirement does not sim­\nply guard against an impermissible desire to censor. The\ngovernment may attempt to suppress speech not only\nbecause it disagrees with the message being expressed,\nbut also for mere convenience. Where certain speech is\nassociated with particular problems, silencing the speech\nis sometimes the path of least resistance. But by demand­\n——————\n   4 Of course we do not hold that “[s]peech restrictions favoring one\n\nviewpoint over another are not content based unless it can be shown\nthat the favored viewpoint has actually been expressed.” Post, at 13.\nWe instead apply an uncontroversial principle of constitutional adjudi­\ncation: that a plaintiff generally cannot prevail on an as-applied chal­\nlenge without showing that the law has in fact been (or is sufficiently\nlikely to be) unconstitutionally applied to him. Specifically, when\nsomeone challenges a law as viewpoint discriminatory but it is not clear\nfrom the face of the law which speakers will be allowed to speak, he\nmust show that he was prevented from speaking while someone espous­\ning another viewpoint was permitted to do so. JUSTICE SCALIA can\ndecry this analysis as “astonishing” only by quoting a sentence that is\nexplicitly limited to as-applied challenges and treating it as relevant to\nfacial challenges. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning a close fit between ends and means, the tailoring\nrequirement prevents the government from too readily\n“sacrific[ing] speech for efficiency.” Riley v. National\nFederation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 795\n(1988).\n   For a content-neutral time, place, or manner regulation\nto be narrowly tailored, it must not “burden substantially\nmore speech than is necessary to further the government’s\nlegitimate interests.” Ward, 491 U. S., at 799. Such a\nregulation, unlike a content-based restriction of speech,\n“need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means\nof ” serving the government’s interests. Id., at 798. But\nthe government still “may not regulate expression in such\na manner that a substantial portion of the burden on\nspeech does not serve to advance its goals.” Id., at 799.\n                             A\n   As noted, respondents claim that the Act promotes\n“public safety, patient access to healthcare, and the unob­\nstructed use of public sidewalks and roadways.” Brief for\nRespondents 27. Petitioners do not dispute the signifi­\ncance of these interests. We have, moreover, previously\nrecognized the legitimacy of the government’s interests in\n“ensuring public safety and order, promoting the free flow\nof traffic on streets and sidewalks, protecting property\nrights, and protecting a woman’s freedom to seek pregnancy­\nrelated services.”     Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of\nWestern N. Y., 519 U. S. 357, 376 (1997). See also Madsen\nv. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 767–768\n(1994). The buffer zones clearly serve these interests.\n   At the same time, the buffer zones impose serious bur­\ndens on petitioners’ speech. At each of the three Planned\nParenthood clinics where petitioners attempt to counsel\npatients, the zones carve out a significant portion of the\nadjacent public sidewalks, pushing petitioners well back\nfrom the clinics’ entrances and driveways. The zones\n20                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthereby compromise petitioners’ ability to initiate the\nclose, personal conversations that they view as essential to\n“sidewalk counseling.”\n   For example, in uncontradicted testimony, McCullen\nexplained that she often cannot distinguish patients from\npassersby outside the Boston clinic in time to initiate a\nconversation before they enter the buffer zone. App. 135.\nAnd even when she does manage to begin a discussion\noutside the zone, she must stop abruptly at its painted\nborder, which she believes causes her to appear “untrust­\nworthy” or “suspicious.” Id., at 135, 152. Given these\nlimitations, McCullen is often reduced to raising her voice\nat patients from outside the zone—a mode of communica­\ntion sharply at odds with the compassionate message she\nwishes to convey. Id., at 133, 152–153. Clark gave similar\ntestimony about her experience at the Worcester clinic.\nId., at 243–244.\n   These burdens on petitioners’ speech have clearly taken\ntheir toll. Although McCullen claims that she has per­\nsuaded about 80 women not to terminate their pregnan­\ncies since the 2007 amendment, App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a,\nshe also says that she reaches “far fewer people” than she\ndid before the amendment, App. 137. Zarrella reports an\neven more precipitous decline in her success rate: She\nestimated having about 100 successful interactions over\nthe years before the 2007 amendment, but not a single one\nsince. Id., at 180. And as for the Worcester clinic, Clark\ntestified that “only one woman out of 100 will make the\neffort to walk across [the street] to speak with [her].” Id.,\nat 217.\n   The buffer zones have also made it substantially more\ndifficult for petitioners to distribute literature to arriving\npatients. As explained, because petitioners in Boston\ncannot readily identify patients before they enter the zone,\nthey often cannot approach them in time to place litera­\nture near their hands—the most effective means of getting\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

In Worcester and\nSpringfield, the zones have pushed petitioners so far back\nfrom the clinics’ driveways that they can no longer even\nattempt to offer literature as drivers turn into the parking\nlots. Id., at 213, 218, 252–253. In short, the Act operates\nto deprive petitioners of their two primary methods of\ncommunicating with patients.\n  The Court of Appeals and respondents are wrong to\ndownplay these burdens on petitioners’ speech. As the\nCourt of Appeals saw it, the Constitution does not accord\n“special protection” to close conversations or “handbilling.”\n571 F. 3d, at 180. But while the First Amendment does\nnot guarantee a speaker the right to any particular form of\nexpression, some forms—such as normal conversation and\nleafletting on a public sidewalk—have historically been\nmore closely associated with the transmission of ideas\nthan others.\n  In the context of petition campaigns, we have observed\nthat “one-on-one communication” is “the most effective,\nfundamental, and perhaps economical avenue of political\ndiscourse.” Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 424 (1988). See\nalso Schenck, supra, at 377 (invalidating a “floating”\nbuffer zone around people entering an abortion clinic\npartly on the ground that it prevented protestors “from\ncommunicating a message from a normal conversational\ndistance or handing leaflets to people entering or leaving\nthe clinics who are walking on the public sidewalks”). And\n“handing out leaflets in the advocacy of a politically con­\ntroversial viewpoint . . . is the essence of First Amendment\nexpression”; “[n]o form of speech is entitled to greater\nconstitutional protection.” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections\nComm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 347 (1995). See also Schenck,\nsupra, at 377 (“Leafletting and commenting on matters of\npublic concern are classic forms of speech that lie at the\nheart of the First Amendment”). When the government\nmakes it more difficult to engage in these modes of com­\n22                    McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nmunication, it imposes an especially significant First\nAmendment burden.5\n   Respondents also emphasize that the Act does not pre­\nvent petitioners from engaging in various forms of “pro­\ntest”—such as chanting slogans and displaying signs—\noutside the buffer zones. Brief for Respondents 50–54.\nThat misses the point. Petitioners are not protestors.\nThey seek not merely to express their opposition to abor­\ntion, but to inform women of various alternatives and to\nprovide help in pursuing them. Petitioners believe that\nthey can accomplish this objective only through personal,\ncaring, consensual conversations. And for good reason: It\nis easier to ignore a strained voice or a waving hand than\na direct greeting or an outstretched arm. While the record\nindicates that petitioners have been able to have a number\nof quiet conversations outside the buffer zones, respond­\nents have not refuted petitioners’ testimony that the con­\nversations have been far less frequent and far less success­\nful since the buffer zones were instituted. It is thus no\nanswer to say that petitioners can still be “seen and\nheard” by women within the buffer zones. Id., at 51–53. If\nall that the women can see and hear are vociferous oppo­\nnents of abortion, then the buffer zones have effectively\nstifled petitioners’ message.\n   Finally, respondents suggest that, at the Worcester and\nSpringfield clinics, petitioners are prevented from com­\nmunicating with patients not by the buffer zones but by\nthe fact that most patients arrive by car and park in the\n——————\n  5 As a leading historian has noted:\n  “It was in this form—as pamphlets—that much of the most important\nand characteristic writing of the American Revolution appeared.

It is true that the layout of\nthe two clinics would prevent petitioners from approach­\ning the clinics’ doorways, even without the buffer zones.\nBut petitioners do not claim a right to trespass on the\nclinics’ property. They instead claim a right to stand on\nthe public sidewalks by the driveway as cars turn into the\nparking lot. Before the buffer zones, they could do so.\nNow they must stand a substantial distance away. The\nAct alone is responsible for that restriction on their ability\nto convey their message.\n                             B\n                             1\n   The buffer zones burden substantially more speech than\nnecessary to achieve the Commonwealth’s asserted inter­\nests. At the outset, we note that the Act is truly excep­\ntional: Respondents and their amici identify no other\nState with a law that creates fixed buffer zones around\nabortion clinics.6 That of course does not mean that the\nlaw is invalid. It does, however, raise concern that the\nCommonwealth has too readily forgone options that could\nserve its interests just as well, without substantially\nburdening the kind of speech in which petitioners wish to\nengage.\n   That is the case here. The Commonwealth’s interests\ninclude ensuring public safety outside abortion clinics,\npreventing harassment and intimidation of patients and\nclinic staff, and combating deliberate obstruction of clinic\nentrances. The Act itself contains a separate provision,\nsubsection (e)—unchallenged by petitioners—that prohib­\nits much of this conduct. That provision subjects to crimi­\nnal punishment “[a]ny person who knowingly obstructs,\ndetains, hinders, impedes or blocks another person’s entry\n\n——————\n  6 Amici do identify five localities with laws similar to the Act here.\n\nBrief for State of New York et al. as Amici Curiae 14, n. 7.\n24                     McCULLEN v.

Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(e).7 If Massachusetts deter­\nmines that broader prohibitions along the same lines are\nnecessary, it could enact legislation similar to the federal\nFreedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 (FACE\nAct), 18 U. S. C. §248(a)(1), which subjects to both crimi­\nnal and civil penalties anyone who “by force or threat of\nforce or by physical obstruction, intentionally injures,\nintimidates or interferes with or attempts to injure, intim­\nidate or interfere with any person because that person is\nor has been, or in order to intimidate such person or any\nother person or any class of persons from, obtaining or\nproviding reproductive health services.” Some dozen other\nStates have done so. See Brief for State of New York et al.\nas Amici Curiae 13, and n. 6. If the Commonwealth is\nparticularly concerned about harassment, it could also\nconsider an ordinance such as the one adopted in New\nYork City that not only prohibits obstructing access to a\nclinic, but also makes it a crime “to follow and harass\nanother person within 15 feet of the premises of a repro­\nductive health care facility.” N. Y. C. Admin. Code §8–\n803(a)(3) (2014).8\n   The Commonwealth points to a substantial public safety\nrisk created when protestors obstruct driveways leading to\nthe clinics.

We merely suggest that a law like the New\nYork City ordinance could in principle constitute a permissible alterna­\ntive. Whether such a law would pass constitutional muster would\ndepend on a number of other factors, such as whether the term “har­\nassment” had been authoritatively construed to avoid vagueness and\noverbreadth problems of the sort noted by JUSTICE SCALIA.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Any such obstruc­\ntion can readily be addressed through existing local ordi­\nnances. See, e.g., Worcester, Mass., Revised Ordinances of\n2008, ch. 12, §25(b) (“No person shall stand, or place any\nobstruction of any kind, upon any street, sidewalk or\ncrosswalk in such a manner as to obstruct a free passage\nfor travelers thereon”); Boston, Mass., Municipal Code, ch.\n16–41.2(d) (2013) (“No person shall solicit while walking\non, standing on or going into any street or highway used\nfor motor vehicle travel, or any area appurtenant thereto\n(including medians, shoulder areas, bicycle lanes, ramps\nand exit ramps)”).\n   All of the foregoing measures are, of course, in addition\nto available generic criminal statutes forbidding assault,\nbreach of the peace, trespass, vandalism, and the like.\n   In addition, subsection (e) of the Act, the FACE Act, and\nthe New York City anti-harassment ordinance are all\nenforceable not only through criminal prosecutions but\nalso through public and private civil actions for injunc­\ntions and other equitable relief. See Mass. Gen. Laws\n§120E½(f); 18 U. S. C. §248(c)(1); N. Y. C. Admin. Code\n§§8–804, 8–805. We have previously noted the First\nAmendment virtues of targeted injunctions as alternatives\nto broad, prophylactic measures. Such an injunction\n“regulates the activities, and perhaps the speech, of a\ngroup,” but only “because of the group’s past actions in the\ncontext of a specific dispute between real parties.” Mad-\nsen, 512 U. S., at 762 (emphasis added). Moreover, given\nthe equitable nature of injunctive relief, courts can tailor a\nremedy to ensure that it restricts no more speech than\nnecessary. See, e.g., id., at 770; Schenck, 519 U. S., at\n380–381. In short, injunctive relief focuses on the precise\nindividuals and the precise conduct causing a particular\nproblem. The Act, by contrast, categorically excludes non­\nexempt individuals from the buffer zones, unnecessarily\nsweeping in innocent individuals and their speech.\n26                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Commonwealth also asserts an interest in prevent­\ning congestion in front of abortion clinics. According to\nrespondents, even when individuals do not deliberately\nobstruct access to clinics, they can inadvertently do so\nsimply by gathering in large numbers. But the Common­\nwealth could address that problem through more targeted\nmeans. Some localities, for example, have ordinances that\nrequire crowds blocking a clinic entrance to disperse when\nordered to do so by the police, and that forbid the individ­\nuals to reassemble within a certain distance of the clinic\nfor a certain period. See Brief for State of New York et al.\nas Amici Curiae 14–15, and n. 10. We upheld a similar\nlaw forbidding three or more people “ ‘to congregate within\n500 feet of [a foreign embassy], and refuse to disperse\nafter having been ordered so to do by the police,’ ” Boos,\n485 U. S., at 316 (quoting D. C. Code §22–1115 (1938))—\nan order the police could give only when they “ ‘reasonably\nbelieve[d] that a threat to the security or peace of the\nembassy [was] present,’ ” 485 U. S., at 330 (quoting Finzer\nv. Barry, 798 F. 2d 1450, 1471 (CADC 1986)).\n   And to the extent the Commonwealth argues that even\nthese types of laws are ineffective, it has another problem.\nThe portions of the record that respondents cite to support\nthe anticongestion interest pertain mainly to one place at\none time: the Boston Planned Parenthood clinic on Satur­\nday mornings. App. 69–71, 88–89, 96, 123. Respondents\npoint us to no evidence that individuals regularly gather\nat other clinics, or at other times in Boston, in sufficiently\nlarge groups to obstruct access. For a problem shown to\narise only once a week in one city at one clinic, creating\n35-foot buffer zones at every clinic across the Common­\nwealth is hardly a narrowly tailored solution.\n   The point is not that Massachusetts must enact all or\neven any of the proposed measures discussed above. The\npoint is instead that the Commonwealth has available to it\na variety of approaches that appear capable of serving its\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterests, without excluding individuals from areas histor­\nically open for speech and debate.\n                               2\n   Respondents have but one reply: “We have tried other\napproaches, but they do not work.” Respondents empha­\nsize the history in Massachusetts of obstruction at abor­\ntion clinics, and the Commonwealth’s allegedly failed\nattempts to combat such obstruction with injunctions and\nindividual prosecutions. They also point to the Common­\nwealth’s experience under the 2000 version of the Act,\nduring which the police found it difficult to enforce the six­\nfoot no-approach zones given the “frenetic” activity in front\nof clinic entrances. Brief for Respondents 43. According to\nrespondents, this history shows that Massachusetts has\ntried less restrictive alternatives to the buffer zones, to no\navail.\n   We cannot accept that contention. Although respond­\nents claim that Massachusetts “tried other laws already\non the books,” id., at 41, they identify not a single prosecu­\ntion brought under those laws within at least the last 17\nyears. And while they also claim that the Commonwealth\n“tried injunctions,” ibid., the last injunctions they cite date\nto the 1990s, see id., at 42 (citing Planned Parenthood\nLeague of Mass., Inc. v. Bell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 677 N.

E. 2d 1361\n(1990)). In short, the Commonwealth has not shown that\nit seriously undertook to address the problem with less\nintrusive tools readily available to it. Nor has it shown\nthat it considered different methods that other jurisdic­\ntions have found effective.\n   Respondents contend that the alternatives we have\ndiscussed suffer from two defects: First, given the “wide­\nspread” nature of the problem, it is simply not “practica­\nble” to rely on individual prosecutions and injunctions.\n28                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Respondents 45. But far from being “wide­\nspread,” the problem appears from the record to be limited\nprincipally to the Boston clinic on Saturday mornings.\nMoreover, by their own account, the police appear per-\nfectly capable of singling out lawbreakers. The legislative\ntestimony preceding the 2007 Act revealed substantial\npolice and video monitoring at the clinics, especially when\nlarge gatherings were anticipated. Captain Evans testi­\nfied that his officers are so familiar with the scene outside\nthe Boston clinic that they “know all the players down\nthere.” App. 69. And Attorney General Coakley relied on\nvideo surveillance to show legislators conduct she thought\nwas “clearly against the law.” Id., at 78. If Common­\nwealth officials can compile an extensive record of obstruc­\ntion and harassment to support their preferred legislation,\nwe do not see why they cannot do the same to support\ninjunctions and prosecutions against those who might\ndeliberately flout the law.\n   The second supposed defect in the alternatives we have\nidentified is that laws like subsection (e) of the Act and the\nfederal FACE Act require a showing of intentional or\ndeliberate obstruction, intimidation, or harassment, which\nis often difficult to prove. Brief for Respondents 45–47.\nAs Captain Evans predicted in his legislative testimony,\nfixed buffer zones would “make our job so much easier.”\nApp. 68.\n   Of course they would. But that is not enough to satisfy\nthe First Amendment. To meet the requirement of narrow\ntailoring, the government must demonstrate that alterna­\ntive measures that burden substantially less speech would\nfail to achieve the government’s interests, not simply that\nthe chosen route is easier. A painted line on the sidewalk\nis easy to enforce, but the prime objective of the First\nAmendment is not efficiency. In any case, we do not think\nthat showing intentional obstruction is nearly so difficult\nin this context as respondents suggest. To determine\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                 29\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether a protestor intends to block access to a clinic, a\npolice officer need only order him to move. If he refuses,\nthen there is no question that his continued conduct is\nknowing or intentional.\n   For similar reasons, respondents’ reliance on our deci­\nsion in Burson v. Freeman is misplaced. There, we upheld\na state statute that established 100-foot buffer zones\noutside polling places on election day within which no one\ncould display or distribute campaign materials or solicit\nvotes. 504 U. S., at 193–194. We approved the buffer\nzones as a valid prophylactic measure, noting that existing\n“[i]ntimidation and interference laws fall short of serving a\nState’s compelling interests because they ‘deal with only\nthe most blatant and specific attempts’ to impede elec­\ntions.” Id., at 206–207 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.\n1, 28 (1976) (per curiam)). Such laws were insufficient\nbecause “[v]oter intimidation and election fraud are . . .\ndifficult to detect.” Burson, 504 U. S., at 208. Obstruction\nof abortion clinics and harassment of patients, by contrast,\nare anything but subtle.\n   We also noted in Burson that under state law, “law\nenforcement officers generally are barred from the vicinity\nof the polls to avoid any appearance of coercion in the\nelectoral process,” with the result that “many acts of inter­\nference would go undetected.” Id., at 207. Not so here.\nAgain, the police maintain a significant presence outside\nMassachusetts abortion clinics. The buffer zones in Bur-\nson were justified because less restrictive measures were\ninadequate. Respondents have not shown that to be the\ncase here.\n   Given the vital First Amendment interests at stake, it is\nnot enough for Massachusetts simply to say that other\napproaches have not worked.9\n——————\n  9 Because we find that the Act is not narrowly tailored, we need not\n\nconsider whether the Act leaves open ample alternative channels of\n30                   McCULLEN v.

With a dart here and a\npleat there, such regulations are sure to satisfy the tailor­\ning standards applied in Part IV of the majority’s opinion.\n   The Court cites two cases for the proposition that “[i]t is\nnot unusual for the Court to proceed sequentially in apply­\ning a constitutional test, even when the preliminary steps\nturn out not to be dispositive.” Ante, at 10–11 (citing\nBartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U. S. 514, 526–527 (2001); Holder\nv. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U. S. 1, 25–28 (2010)).\nThose cases provide little cover. In both, there was no\ndisagreement among the Members of the Court about\nwhether the statutes in question discriminated on the\nbasis of content.3 There was thus little harm in answering\nthe constitutional question that was “logically antecedent.”\nAnte, at 10. In the present case, however, content neutral­\nity is far from clear (the Court is divided 5-to-4), and the\nparties vigorously dispute the point, see ibid. One would\nhave thought that the Court would avoid the issue by\nsimply assuming without deciding the logically antecedent\npoint. We have done that often before. See, e.g., Herrera\nv. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 417 (1993); Regents of Univ. of\nMich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 222–223 (1985); Board of\nCurators of Univ. of Mo. v. Horowitz, 435 U. S. 78, 91–92\n(1978).\n   The Court points out that its opinion goes on to suggest\n——————\n   3 See Bartnicki, 532 U. S., at 526 (“We agree with petitioners that\n\n§2511(1)(c), as well as its Pennsylvania analog, is in fact a content­\nneutral law of general applicability”); id., at 544 (Rehnquist, C. J.,\ndissenting) (“The Court correctly observes that these are ‘content­\nneutral law[s] of general applicability’ ” (brackets in original)); Humani-\ntarian Law Project, 561 U. S., at 27 (“[Section] 2339B regulates speech\non the basis of its content”); id., at 45 (BREYER, J., dissenting)\n(“[W]here, as here, a statute applies criminal penalties and at least\narguably does so on the basis of content-based distinctions, I should\nthink we would scrutinize the statute and justifications ‘strictly’ ”).\n4                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(in Part IV) possible alternatives that apply only at abor­\ntion clinics, which therefore “raises the question whether\nthose provisions are content neutral.” Ante, at 11. Of\ncourse, the Court has no obligation to provide advice on\nalternative speech restrictions, and appending otherwise\nunnecessary constitutional pronouncements to such advice\nproduces nothing but an impermissible advisory opinion.\n   By the way, there is dictum favorable to advocates of\nabortion rights even in Part IV. The Court invites Massa­\nchusetts, as a means of satisfying the tailoring require­\nment, to “consider an ordinance such as the one adopted in\nNew York City that . . . makes it a crime ‘to follow and\nharass another person within 15 feet of the premises of a\nreproductive health care facility.’ ” Ante, at 24 (quoting\nN. Y. C. Admin. Code §8–803(a)(3) (2014)). Is it harass­\nment, one wonders, for Eleanor McCullen to ask a woman,\nquietly and politely, two times, whether she will take\nliterature or whether she has any questions? Three times?\nFour times? It seems to me far from certain that First\nAmendment rights can be imperiled by threatening jail\ntime (only at “reproductive health care facilit[ies],” of\ncourse) for so vague an offense as “follow[ing] and har­\nass[ing].” It is wrong for the Court to give its approval to\nsuch legislation without benefit of briefing and argument.\nII. The Statute Is Content Based and Fails Strict Scrutiny\n   Having eagerly volunteered to take on the level-of­\nscrutiny question, the Court provides the wrong answer.\nPetitioners argue for two reasons that subsection (b) ar­\nticulates a content-based speech restriction—and that\nwe must therefore evaluate it through the lens of strict\nscrutiny.\n          A. Application to Abortion Clinics Only\n  First, petitioners maintain that the Act targets abortion­\nrelated—for practical purposes, abortion-opposing—speech\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbecause it applies outside abortion clinics only (rather\nthan outside other buildings as well).\n   Public streets and sidewalks are traditional forums for\nspeech on matters of public concern. Therefore, as the\nCourt acknowledges, they hold a “ ‘special position in\nterms of First Amendment protection.’ ” Ante, at 8 (quot­\ning United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 180 (1983)).\nMoreover, “the public spaces outside of [abortion­\nproviding] facilities . . . ha[ve] become, by necessity and by\nvirtue of this Court’s decisions, a forum of last resort for\nthose who oppose abortion.” Hill, 530 U. S., at 763\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). It blinks reality to say, as the\nmajority does, that a blanket prohibition on the use of\nstreets and sidewalks where speech on only one politically\ncontroversial topic is likely to occur—and where that\nspeech can most effectively be communicated—is not\ncontent based. Would the Court exempt from strict scru­\ntiny a law banning access to the streets and sidewalks\nsurrounding the site of the Republican National Conven­\ntion? Or those used annually to commemorate the 1965\nSelma-to-Montgomery civil rights marches? Or those\noutside the Internal Revenue Service? Surely not.\n   The majority says, correctly enough, that a facially\nneutral speech restriction escapes strict scrutiny, even\nwhen it “may disproportionately affect speech on certain\ntopics,” so long as it is “justified without reference to the\ncontent of the regulated speech.” Ante, at 12 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But the cases in which the\nCourt has previously found that standard satisfied—in\nparticular, Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41\n(1986), and Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781\n(1989), both of which the majority cites—are a far cry from\nwhat confronts us here.\n   Renton upheld a zoning ordinance prohibiting adult\nmotion-picture theaters within 1,000 feet of residential\nneighborhoods, churches, parks, and schools. The ordi­\n6                  McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnance was content neutral, the Court held, because its\npurpose was not to suppress pornographic speech qua\nspeech but, rather, to mitigate the “secondary effects” of\nadult theaters—including by “prevent[ing] crime, pro­\ntect[ing] the city’s retail trade, [and] maintain[ing] prop­\nerty values.” 475 U. S., at 47, 48. The Court reasoned that\nif the city “ ‘had been concerned with restricting the mes­\nsage purveyed by adult theaters, it would have tried to\nclose them or restrict their number rather than circum­\nscribe their choice as to location.’ ” Id., at 48 (quoting\nYoung v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 82,\nn. 4 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in part)). Ward, in turn,\ninvolved a New York City regulation requiring the use of\nthe city’s own sound equipment and technician for events\nat a bandshell in Central Park. The Court held the regu­\nlation content neutral because its “principal justification\n[was] the city’s desire to control noise levels,” a justifica­\ntion that “ ‘ha[d] nothing to do with [the] content’ ” of re­\nspondent’s rock concerts or of music more generally. 491\nU. S., at 792. The regulation “ha[d] no material impact on\nany performer’s ability to exercise complete artistic control\nover sound quality.” Id., at 802; see also id., at 792–793.\n   Compare these cases’ reasons for concluding that the\nregulations in question were “justified without reference to\nthe content of the regulated speech” with the feeble rea­\nsons for the majority’s adoption of that conclusion in the\npresent case. The majority points only to the statute’s\nstated purpose of increasing “ ‘public safety’ ” at abortion\nclinics, ante, at 12–13 (quoting 2007 Mass. Acts p. 660),\nand to the additional aims articulated by respondents\nbefore this Court—namely, protecting “ ‘patient access to\nhealthcare . . . and the unobstructed use of public side­\nwalks and roadways,’ ” ante, at 13 (quoting Brief for Re­\nspondents 27). Really? Does a statute become “justified\nwithout reference to the content of the regulated speech”\nsimply because the statute itself and those defending it in\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncourt say that it is? Every objective indication shows that\nthe provision’s primary purpose is to restrict speech that\nopposes abortion.\n  I begin, as suggested above, with the fact that the Act\nburdens only the public spaces outside abortion clinics.\nOne might have expected the majority to defend the stat­\nute’s peculiar targeting by arguing that those locations\nregularly face the safety and access problems that it says\nthe Act was designed to solve. But the majority does not\nmake that argument because it would be untrue. As the\nCourt belatedly discovers in Part IV of its opinion, al­\nthough the statute applies to all abortion clinics in Massa­\nchusetts, only one is known to have been beset by the\nproblems that the statute supposedly addresses. See ante,\nat 26, 28. The Court uses this striking fact (a smoking\ngun, so to speak) as a basis for concluding that the law is\ninsufficiently “tailored” to safety and access concerns (Part\nIV) rather than as a basis for concluding that it is not\ndirected to those concerns at all, but to the suppression of\nantiabortion speech. That is rather like invoking the eight\nmissed human targets of a shooter who has killed one\nvictim to prove, not that he is guilty of attempted mass\nmurder, but that he has bad aim.\n   Whether the statute “restrict[s] more speech than\nnecessary” in light of the problems that it allegedly ad­\ndresses, ante, at 14–15, is, to be sure, relevant to the\ntailoring component of the First Amendment analysis (the\nshooter doubtless did have bad aim), but it is also rele­\nvant—powerfully relevant—to whether the law is really\ndirected to safety and access concerns or rather to the\nsuppression of a particular type of speech. Showing that a\nlaw that suppresses speech on a specific subject is so far­\nreaching that it applies even when the asserted non­\nspeech-related problems are not present is persuasive\nevidence that the law is content based. In its zeal to treat\nabortion-related speech as a special category, the majority\n8                  McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndistorts not only the First Amendment but also the ordi­\nnary logic of probative inferences.\n   The structure of the Act also indicates that it rests on\ncontent-based concerns. The goals of “public safety, pa­\ntient access to healthcare, and the unobstructed use of\npublic sidewalks and roadways,” Brief for Respondents 27,\nare already achieved by an earlier-enacted subsection of\nthe statute, which provides criminal penalties for “[a]ny\nperson who knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders, im­\npedes or blocks another person’s entry to or exit from a\nreproductive health care facility.” §120E½(e). As the\nmajority recognizes, that provision is easy to enforce. See\nante, at 28–29. Thus, the speech-free zones carved out by\nsubsection (b) add nothing to safety and access; what they\nachieve, and what they were obviously designed to\nachieve, is the suppression of speech opposing abortion.\n   Further contradicting the Court’s fanciful defense of the\nAct is the fact that subsection (b) was enacted as a more\neasily enforceable substitute for a prior provision. That pro­\nvision did not exclude people entirely from the restricted\nareas around abortion clinics; rather, it forbade people\nin those areas to approach within six feet of another per­\nson without that person’s consent “for the purpose of pass­\ning a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engag­\ning in oral protest, education or counseling with such\nother person.” §120E½(b) (West 2000). As the majority\nacknowledges, that provision was “modeled on a . . . Colo­\nrado law that this Court had upheld in Hill.” Ante, at 2.\nAnd in that case, the Court recognized that the statute in\nquestion was directed at the suppression of unwelcome\nspeech, vindicating what Hill called “[t]he unwilling lis­\ntener’s interest in avoiding unwanted communication.”\n530 U. S., at 716. The Court held that interest to be con­\ntent neutral. Id., at 719–725.\n   The provision at issue here was indisputably meant to\nserve the same interest in protecting citizens’ supposed\n                       Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                         9\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nright to avoid speech that they would rather not hear. For\nthat reason, we granted a second question for review in\nthis case (though one would not know that from the\nCourt’s opinion, which fails to mention it): whether Hill\nshould be cut back or cast aside. See Pet. for Cert. i. (stat­\ning second question presented as “If Hill . . . permits en­\nforcement of this law, whether Hill should be limited or\noverruled”); 570 U. S. ___ (2013) (granting certiorari with­\nout reservation). The majority avoids that question by\ndeclaring the Act content neutral on other (entirely unper­\nsuasive) grounds. In concluding that the statute is con­\ntent based and therefore subject to strict scrutiny, I neces­\nsarily conclude that Hill should be overruled. Reasons for\ndoing so are set forth in the dissents in that case, see 530\nU. S., at 741–765 (SCALIA, J.); id., at 765–790 (KENNEDY,\nJ.), and in the abundance of scathing academic commen­\ntary describing how Hill stands in contradiction to our\nFirst Amendment jurisprudence.4 Protecting people from\nspeech they do not want to hear is not a function that the\nFirst Amendment allows the government to undertake in\nthe public streets and sidewalks.\n   One final thought regarding Hill: It can be argued, and\nit should be argued in the next case, that by stating that\n“the Act would not be content neutral if it were concerned\nwith undesirable effects that arise from . . . ‘[l]isteners’\nreactions to speech,’ ” ante, at 13 (quoting Boos v. Barry,\n485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988) (brackets in original)), and then\nholding the Act unconstitutional for being insufficiently\ntailored to safety and access concerns, the Court itself has\n——————\n   4 “Hill . . . is inexplicable on standard free-speech grounds[,] and . . . it\n\nis shameful the Supreme Court would have upheld this piece of legisla­\ntion on the reasoning that it gave.” Constitutional Law Symposium,\nProfessor Michael W. McConnell’s Response, 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 747\n(2001). “I don’t think [Hill] was a difficult case. I think it was slam­\ndunk simple and slam-dunk wrong.” Id., at 750 (remarks of Laurence\nTribe). The list could go on.\n10                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsub silentio (and perhaps inadvertently) overruled Hill.\nThe unavoidable implication of that holding is that protec­\ntion against unwelcome speech cannot justify restrictions\non the use of public streets and sidewalks.\n   B. Exemption for Abortion-Clinic Employees or Agents\n   Petitioners contend that the Act targets speech opposing\nabortion (and thus constitutes a presumptively invalid\nviewpoint-discriminatory restriction) for another reason\nas well: It exempts “employees or agents” of an abortion\nclinic “acting within the scope of their employment,”\n§120E½(b)(2).\n   It goes without saying that “[g]ranting waivers to fa­\nvored speakers (or . . . denying them to disfavored speak­\ners) would of course be unconstitutional.” Thomas v.\nChicago Park Dist., 534 U. S. 316, 325 (2002). The major­\nity opinion sets forth a two-part inquiry for assessing\nwhether a regulation is content based, but when it comes\nto assessing the exemption for abortion-clinic employees or\nagents, the Court forgets its own teaching. Its opinion\njumps right over the prong that asks whether the provi­\nsion “draw[s] . . . distinctions on its face,” ante, at 12, and\ninstead proceeds directly to the purpose-related prong, see\nibid., asking whether the exemption “represent[s] a gov­\nernmental attempt to give one side of a debatable public\nquestion an advantage in expressing its views to the peo­\nple,” ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted). I\ndisagree with the majority’s negative answer to that ques­\ntion, but that is beside the point if the text of the statute—\nwhatever its purposes might have been—“license[s] one\nside of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other\nto follow Marquis of Queensberry rules.” R. A. V. v. St.\nPaul, 505 U. S. 377, 392 (1992).\n   Is there any serious doubt that abortion-clinic employees\nor agents “acting within the scope of their employment”\nnear clinic entrances may—indeed, often will—speak in\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfavor of abortion (“You are doing the right thing”)? Or\nspeak in opposition to the message of abortion oppo­\nnents—saying, for example, that “this is a safe facility” to\nrebut the statement that it is not? See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n37–38. The Court’s contrary assumption is simply incred­\nible. And the majority makes no attempt to establish the\nfurther necessary proposition that abortion-clinic employ­\nees and agents do not engage in nonspeech activities\ndirected to the suppression of antiabortion speech by\nhampering the efforts of counselors to speak to prospective\nclients. Are we to believe that a clinic employee sent out\nto “escort” prospective clients into the building would not\nseek to prevent a counselor like Eleanor McCullen from\ncommunicating with them? He could pull a woman away\nfrom an approaching counselor, cover her ears, or make\nloud noises to drown out the counselor’s pleas.\n   The Court points out that the exemption may allow into\nthe speech-free zones clinic employees other than escorts,\nsuch as “the maintenance worker shoveling a snowy side­\nwalk or the security guard patrolling a clinic entrance.”\nAnte, at 16. I doubt that Massachusetts legislators had\nthose people in mind, but whether they did is in any event\nirrelevant. Whatever other activity is permitted, so long\nas the statute permits speech favorable to abortion rights\nwhile excluding antiabortion speech, it discriminates on\nthe basis of viewpoint.\n   The Court takes the peculiar view that, so long as the\nclinics have not specifically authorized their employees to\nspeak in favor of abortion (or, presumably, to impede\nantiabortion speech), there is no viewpoint discrimination.\nSee ibid. But it is axiomatic that “where words are em­\nployed in a statute which had at the time a well-known\nmeaning at common law or in the law of this country[,]\nthey are presumed to have been used in that sense unless\nthe context compels to the contrary.” Standard Oil Co. of\nN. J. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, 59 (1911). The phrase\n12                McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n“scope of employment” is a well-known common-law con­\ncept that includes “[t]he range of reasonable and foresee­\nable activities that an employee engages in while carrying\nout the employer’s business.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1465\n(9th ed. 2009). The employer need not specifically direct\nor sanction each aspect of an employee’s conduct for it to\nqualify. See Restatement (Second) of Agency §229 (1957);\nsee also Restatement (Third) of Agency §7.07(2), and\nComment b (2005). Indeed, employee conduct can qualify\neven if the employer specifically forbids it. See Restate­\nment (Second) §230. In any case, it is implausible that\nclinics would bar escorts from engaging in the sort of\nactivity mentioned above. Moreover, a statute that forbids\none side but not the other to convey its message does not\nbecome viewpoint neutral simply because the favored side\nchooses voluntarily to abstain from activity that the stat­\nute permits.\n   There is not a shadow of a doubt that the assigned or\nforeseeable conduct of a clinic employee or agent can\ninclude both speaking in favor of abortion rights and\ncountering the speech of people like petitioners. See post,\nat 1–2 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). Indeed, as the\nmajority acknowledges, the trial record includes testimony\nthat escorts at the Boston clinic “expressed views about\nabortion to the women they were accompanying, thwarted\npetitioners’ attempts to speak and hand literature to the\nwomen, and disparaged petitioners in various ways,”\nincluding by calling them “ ‘crazy.’ ”     Ante, at 7, 16\n(citing App. 165, 168–169, 177–178, 189–190). What a\nsurprise! The Web site for the Planned Parenthood\nLeague of Massachusetts (which operates the three\nabortion facilities where petitioners attempt to counsel\nwomen), urges readers to “Become a Clinic Escort Vol­\nunteer” in order to “provide a safe space for patients\nby escorting them through protestors to the health center.”\nVolunteer and Internship Opportunities, online at https://\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   13\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nplannedparenthoodvolunteer.hire.com /viewjob.html?optlink-\nview=view-28592&ERFormID=newjoblist&ERFormCode=any\n(as visited June 24, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). The dangers that the Web site attributes to\n“protestors” are related entirely to speech, not to safety or\naccess. “Protestors,” it reports, “hold signs, try to speak to\npatients entering the building, and distribute literature\nthat can be misleading.” Ibid. The “safe space” provided\nby escorts is protection from that speech.\n   Going from bad to worse, the majority’s opinion con­\ntends that “the record before us contains insufficient\nevidence to show” that abortion-facility escorts have actu­\nally spoken in favor of abortion (or, presumably, hindered\nantiabortion speech) while acting within the scope of their\nemployment. Ante, at 18. Here is a brave new First\nAmendment test: Speech restrictions favoring one view­\npoint over another are not content based unless it can be\nshown that the favored viewpoint has actually been ex­\npressed. A city ordinance closing a park adjoining the\nRepublican National Convention to all speakers except\nthose whose remarks have been approved by the Repub­\nlican National Committee is thus not subject to strict\nscrutiny unless it can be shown that someone has given\ncommittee-endorsed remarks. For this Court to suggest\nsuch a test is astonishing.5\n——————\n   5 The Court states that I can make this assertion “only by quoting a\n\nsentence that is explicitly limited to as-applied challenges and treating\nit as relevant to facial challenges.” Ante, at 18, n. 4. That is not so.\nThe sentence in question appears in a paragraph immediately following\nrejection of the facial challenge, which begins: “It would be a very\ndifferent question if it turned out that a clinic authorized escorts to\nspeak about abortion inside the buffer zones.” Ante, at 17. And the\nprior discussion regarding the facial challenge points to the fact that\n“[t]here is no suggestion in the record that any of the clinics authorize\ntheir employees to speak about abortion in the buffer zones.” Ante, at\n16. To be sure, the paragraph in question then goes on to concede only\nthat the statute’s constitutionality as applied would depend upon\n14                   McCULLEN v.

Conclusion\n  In sum, the Act should be reviewed under the strict­\nscrutiny standard applicable to content-based legislation.\nThat standard requires that a regulation represent “the\nleast restrictive means” of furthering “a compelling Gov­\nernment interest.” United States v. Playboy Entertain-\nment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Respondents do not even at­\ntempt to argue that subsection (b) survives this test. See\nante, at 10. “Suffice it to say that if protecting people from\nunwelcome communications”—the actual purpose of the\nprovision—“is a compelling state interest, the First\nAmendment is a dead letter.” Hill, 530 U. S., at 748–749\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n                   III. Narrow Tailoring\n  Having determined that the Act is content based and\ndoes not withstand strict scrutiny, I need not pursue the\ninquiry conducted in Part IV of the Court’s opinion—\nwhether the statute is “ ‘narrowly tailored to serve a signif­\nicant governmental interest,’ ” ante, at 18 (quoting Ward,\n491 U. S., at 796 (internal quotation marks omitted)). I\nsuppose I could do so, taking as a given the Court’s erro­\nneous content-neutrality conclusion in Part III; and if I\ndid, I suspect I would agree with the majority that the\nlegislation is not narrowly tailored to advance the inter­\nests asserted by respondents. But I prefer not to take part\nin the assembling of an apparent but specious unanimity.\nI leave both the plainly unnecessary and erroneous half\n——————\nexplicit clinic authorization. Even that seems to me wrong. Saying\nthat voluntary action by a third party can cause an otherwise valid\nstatute to violate the First Amendment as applied seems to me little\nbetter than saying it can cause such a statute to violate the First\nAmendment facially. A statute that punishes me for speaking unless x\nchooses to speak is unconstitutional facially and as applied, without\nreference to x’s action.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(b) (West 2012),\nviolates the First Amendment. As the Court recognizes, if\nthe Massachusetts law discriminates on the basis of view­\npoint, it is unconstitutional, see ante, at 10, and I believe\nthe law clearly discriminates on this ground.\n   The Massachusetts statute generally prohibits any\nperson from entering a buffer zone around an abortion\nclinic during the clinic’s business hours, §120E½(c), but\nthe law contains an exemption for “employees or agents of\nsuch facility acting within the scope of their employment.”\n§120E½(b)(2). Thus, during business hours, individuals\nwho wish to counsel against abortion or to criticize the\nparticular clinic may not do so within the buffer zone. If\nthey engage in such conduct, they commit a crime. See\n§120E½(d). By contrast, employees and agents of the\nclinic may enter the zone and engage in any conduct that\nfalls within the scope of their employment. A clinic may\ndirect or authorize an employee or agent, while within the\nzone, to express favorable views about abortion or the\nclinic, and if the employee exercises that authority, the\nemployee’s conduct is perfectly lawful. In short, petition­\ners and other critics of a clinic are silenced, while the\n2                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nclinic may authorize its employees to express speech in\nsupport of the clinic and its work.\n   Consider this entirely realistic situation. A woman\nenters a buffer zone and heads haltingly toward the en­\ntrance. A sidewalk counselor, such as petitioners, enters\nthe buffer zone, approaches the woman and says, “If you\nhave doubts about an abortion, let me try to answer any\nquestions you may have. The clinic will not give you good\ninformation.” At the same time, a clinic employee, as\ninstructed by the management, approaches the same\nwoman and says, “Come inside and we will give you hon­\nest answers to all your questions.” The sidewalk counselor\nand the clinic employee expressed opposing viewpoints,\nbut only the first violated the statute.\n   Or suppose that the issue is not abortion but the safety\nof a particular facility. Suppose that there was a recent\nreport of a botched abortion at the clinic. A nonemployee\nmay not enter the buffer zone to warn about the clinic’s\nhealth record, but an employee may enter and tell pro­\nspective clients that the clinic is safe.\n   It is clear on the face of the Massachusetts law that it\ndiscriminates based on viewpoint. Speech in favor of the\nclinic and its work by employees and agents is permitted;\nspeech criticizing the clinic and its work is a crime. This\nis blatant viewpoint discrimination.\n   The Court holds not only that the Massachusetts law is\nviewpoint neutral but also that it does not discriminate\nbased on content. See ante, at 11–15. The Court treats\nthe Massachusetts law like one that bans all speech\nwithin the buffer zone. While such a law would be content\nneutral on its face, there are circumstances in which a law\nforbidding all speech at a particular location would not be\ncontent neutral in fact. Suppose, for example, that a\nfacially content-neutral law is enacted for the purpose of\nsuppressing speech on a particular topic. Such a law\nwould not be content neutral. See, e.g., Turner Broadcast-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ning System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 645–646 (1994).\n  In this case, I do not think that it is possible to reach a\njudgment about the intent of the Massachusetts Legisla­\nture without taking into account the fact that the law that\nthe legislature enacted blatantly discriminates based on\nviewpoint. In light of this feature, as well as the over­\nbreadth that the Court identifies, see ante, at 23–27, it\ncannot be said, based on the present record, that the law\nwould be content neutral even if the exemption for clinic\nemployees and agents were excised. However, if the law\nwere truly content neutral, I would agree with the Court\nthat the law would still be unconstitutional on the ground\nthat it burdens more speech than is necessary to serve the\nCommonwealth’s asserted interests.\n</pre>", "id": 2680591, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/06/26/mccullen_v._coakley.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

COAKLEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n         OF MASSACHUSETTS, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12–1168. Argued January 15, 2014—Decided June 26, 2014\nIn 2007, Massachusetts amended its Reproductive Health Care Facili­\n  ties Act, which had been enacted in 2000 to address clashes between\n  abortion opponents and advocates of abortion rights outside clinics\n  where abortions were performed. The amended version of the Act\n  makes it a crime to knowingly stand on a “public way or sidewalk”\n  within 35 feet of an entrance or driveway to any “reproductive health\n  care facility,” defined as “a place, other than within or upon the\n  grounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered or performed.”\n  Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §§120E½(a), (b). The Act exempts from\n  this prohibition four classes of individuals, including “employees or\n  agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment.”\n  §120E½(b)(2). Another provision of the Act proscribes the knowing\n  obstruction of access to an abortion clinic. §120E½(e).\n     McCullen and the other petitioners are individuals who attempt to\n  engage women approaching Massachusetts abortion clinics in “side­\n  walk counseling,” which involves offering information about alterna­\n  tives to abortion and help pursuing those options. They claim that\n  the 35-foot buffer zones have displaced them from their previous po­\n  sitions outside the clinics, considerably hampering their counseling\n  efforts. Their attempts to communicate with patients are further\n  thwarted, they claim, by clinic “escorts,” who accompany arriving pa­\n  tients through the buffer zones to the clinic entrances.\n     Petitioners sued Attorney General Coakley and other Common­\n  wealth officials, seeking to enjoin the Act’s enforcement on the\n  ground that it violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, both\n  on its face and as applied to them. The District Court denied both\n  challenges, and the First Circuit affirmed. With regard to petition­\n2                        McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ers’ facial challenge, the First Circuit held that the Act was a reason­\n    able “time, place, and manner” regulation under the test set forth in\n    Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781.\nHeld: The Massachusetts Act violates the First Amendment. Pp. 8–30.\n    (a) By its very terms, the Act restricts access to “public way[s]” and\n “sidewalk[s],” places that have traditionally been open for speech ac­\n tivities and that the Court has accordingly labeled “traditional public\n fora,” Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 469. The gov­\n ernment’s ability to regulate speech in such locations is “very lim­\n ited.” United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177. “[E]ven in a public\n forum,” however, “the government may impose reasonable re­\n strictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided\n the restrictions ‘are justified without reference to the content of the\n regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a signifi­\n cant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alterna­\n tive channels for communication of the information,’ ” Ward, supra,\n at 791. Pp. 8–10.\n    (b) Because the Act is neither content nor viewpoint based, it need\n not be analyzed under strict scrutiny. Pp. 10–18.\n       (1) The Act is not content based simply because it establishes\n buffer zones only at abortion clinics, as opposed to other kinds of fa­\n cilities. First, the Act does not draw content-based distinctions on its\n face. Whether petitioners violate the Act “depends” not “on what\n they say,” Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U. S. 1, 27, but\n on where they say it. Second, even if a facially neutral law dispropor­\n tionately affects speech on certain topics, it remains content neutral\n so long as it is “ ‘justified without reference to the content of the regu­\n lated speech.’ ” Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48.\n The Act’s purposes include protecting public safety, patient access to\n healthcare, and unobstructed use of public sidewalks and streets.\n The Court has previously deemed all these concerns to be content\n neutral. See Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321. An intent to single\n out for regulation speech about abortion cannot be inferred from the\n Act’s limited scope. “States adopt laws to address the problems that\n confront them.” Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 207. There was a\n record of crowding, obstruction, and even violence outside Massachu­\n setts abortion clinics but not at other kinds of facilities in the Com­\n monwealth. Pp. 11–15.\n       (2) The Act’s exemption for clinic employees and agents acting\n within the scope of their employment does not appear to be an at­\n tempt to favor one viewpoint about abortion over the other. City of\n Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 51, distinguished. Given that some\n kind of exemption was necessary to allow individuals who work at\n the clinics to enter or remain within the buffer zones, the “scope of\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nemployment” qualification simply ensures that the exemption is lim­\nited to its purpose of allowing the employees to do their jobs. Even\nassuming that some clinic escorts have expressed their views on\nabortion inside the zones, the record does not suggest that such\nspeech was within the scope of the escorts’ employment. If it turned\nout that a particular clinic authorized its employees to speak about\nabortion in the buffer zones, that would support an as-applied chal­\nlenge to the zones at that clinic. Pp. 15–18.\n   (c) Although the Act is content neutral, it is not “narrowly tailored”\nbecause it “burden[s] substantially more speech than is necessary to\nfurther the government’s legitimate interests.” Ward, 491 U. S., at\n799. Pp. 18–29.\n      (1) The buffer zones serve the Commonwealth’s legitimate inter­\nests in maintaining public safety on streets and sidewalks and in\npreserving access to adjacent reproductive healthcare facilities. See\nSchenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y., 519 U. S. 357, 376.\nAt the same time, however, they impose serious burdens on petition­\ners’ speech, depriving them of their two primary methods of com­\nmunicating with arriving patients: close, personal conversations and\ndistribution of literature. Those forms of expression have historically\nbeen closely associated with the transmission of ideas. While the Act\nmay allow petitioners to “protest” outside the buffer zones, petition­\ners are not protestors; they seek not merely to express their opposi­\ntion to abortion, but to engage in personal, caring, consensual conver­\nsations with women about various alternatives. It is thus no answer\nto say that petitioners can still be seen and heard by women within\nthe buffer zones. If all that the women can see and hear are vocifer­\nous opponents of abortion, then the buffer zones have effectively sti­\nfled petitioners’ message. Pp. 19–23.\n      (2) The buffer zones burden substantially more speech than nec­\nessary to achieve the Commonwealth’s asserted interests. Subsection\n(e) of the Act already prohibits deliberate obstruction of clinic en­\ntrances. Massachusetts could also enact legislation similar to the\nfederal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, 18 U. S. C.\n§248(a)(1), which imposes criminal and civil sanctions for obstruct­\ning, intimidating, or interfering with persons obtaining or providing\nreproductive health services. Obstruction of clinic driveways can\nreadily be addressed through existing local traffic ordinances. While\nthe Commonwealth contends that individuals can inadvertently ob­\nstruct access to clinics simply by gathering in large numbers, that\nproblem could be addressed through a law requiring crowds blocking\na clinic entrance to disperse for a limited period when ordered to do\nso by the police. In any event, crowding appears to be a problem only\nat the Boston clinic, and even there, only on Saturday mornings.\n4                        McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       The Commonwealth has not shown that it seriously undertook to\n    address these various problems with the less intrusive tools readily\n    available to it. It identifies not a single prosecution or injunction\n    against individuals outside abortion clinics since the 1990s. The\n    Commonwealth responds that the problems are too widespread for\n    individual prosecutions and injunctions to be effective. But again,\n    the record indicates that the problems are limited principally to the\n    Boston clinic on Saturday mornings, and the police there appear per­\n    fectly capable of singling out lawbreakers. The Commonwealth also\n    claims that it would be difficult to prove intentional or deliberate ob­\n    struction or intimidation and that the buffer zones accordingly make\n    the police’s job easier. To meet the narrow tailoring requirement,\n    however, the government must demonstrate that alternative\n    measures that burden substantially less speech would fail to achieve\n    the government’s interests, not simply that the chosen route is easier.\n    In any event, to determine whether someone intends to block access\n    to a clinic, a police officer need only order him to move; if he refuses,\n    then there is no question that his continued conduct is knowing or in­\n    tentional. For similar reasons, the Commonwealth’s reliance on Bur-\n    son v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, is misplaced. There, the Court upheld\n    a law establishing buffer zones outside polling places on the ground\n    that less restrictive measures were inadequate. But whereas “[v]oter\n    intimidation and election fraud” are “difficult to detect,” id., at 208,\n    obstruction and harassment at abortion clinics are anything but sub­\n    tle. And while the police “generally are barred from the vicinity of\n    the polls to avoid any appearance of coercion in the electoral process,”\n    id., at 207, they maintain a significant presence outside Massachu­\n    setts abortion clinics. In short, given the vital First Amendment in­\n    terests at stake, it is not enough for Massachusetts simply to say that\n    other approaches have not worked.

Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266,\n§§120E½(a), (b) (West 2012). Petitioners are individuals\nwho approach and talk to women outside such facilities,\nattempting to dissuade them from having abortions. The\nstatute prevents petitioners from doing so near the facili­\nties’ entrances. The question presented is whether the\nstatute violates the First Amendment.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  In 2000, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted the\nMassachusetts Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act,\nMass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½ (West 2000). The law\nwas designed to address clashes between abortion oppo­\nnents and advocates of abortion rights that were occurring\noutside clinics where abortions were performed. The Act\n2                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nestablished a defined area with an 18-foot radius around\nthe entrances and driveways of such facilities. §120E½(b).\nAnyone could enter that area, but once within it, no one\n(other than certain exempt individuals) could knowingly\napproach within six feet of another person—unless that\nperson consented—“for the purpose of passing a leaflet or\nhandbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral pro­\ntest, education, or counseling with such other person.”\nIbid. A separate provision subjected to criminal punish­\nment anyone who “knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders,\nimpedes or blocks another person’s entry to or exit from a\nreproductive health care facility.” §120E½(e).\n   The statute was modeled on a similar Colorado law that\nthis Court had upheld in Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703\n(2000). Relying on Hill, the United States Court of Ap­\npeals for the First Circuit sustained the Massachusetts\nstatute against a First Amendment challenge. McGuire v.\nReilly, 386 F. 3d 45 (2004) (McGuire II), cert. denied, 544\nU. S. 974 (2005); McGuire v. Reilly, 260 F. 3d 36 (2001)\n(McGuire I).\n   By 2007, some Massachusetts legislators and law en­\nforcement officials had come to regard the 2000 statute as\ninadequate. At legislative hearings, multiple witnesses\nrecounted apparent violations of the law. Massachusetts\nAttorney General Martha Coakley, for example, testified\nthat protestors violated the statute “on a routine basis.”\nApp. 78. To illustrate this claim, she played a video de­\npicting protestors approaching patients and clinic staff\nwithin the buffer zones, ostensibly without the latter\nindividuals’ consent. Clinic employees and volunteers also\ntestified that protestors congregated near the doors and in\nthe driveways of the clinics, with the result that prospec­\ntive patients occasionally retreated from the clinics rather\nthan try to make their way to the clinic entrances or park­\ning lots.\n   Captain William B. Evans of the Boston Police Depart­\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment, however, testified that his officers had made “no\nmore than five or so arrests” at the Planned Parenthood\nclinic in Boston and that what few prosecutions had been\nbrought were unsuccessful. Id., at 68–69. Witnesses\nattributed the dearth of enforcement to the difficulty of\npolicing the six-foot no-approach zones. Captain Evans\ntestified that the 18-foot zones were so crowded with\nprotestors that they resembled “a goalie’s crease,” making\nit hard to determine whether a protestor had deliberately\napproached a patient or, if so, whether the patient had\nconsented. Id., at 69–71. For similar reasons, Attorney\nGeneral Coakley concluded that the six-foot no-approach\nzones were “unenforceable.” Id., at 79. What the police\nneeded, she said, was a fixed buffer zone around clinics\nthat protestors could not enter. Id., at 74, 76. Captain\nEvans agreed, explaining that such a zone would “make\nour job so much easier.” Id., at 68.\n   To address these concerns, the Massachusetts Legisla­\nture amended the statute in 2007, replacing the six-foot\nno-approach zones (within the 18-foot area) with a 35-foot\nfixed buffer zone from which individuals are categorically\nexcluded. The statute now provides:\n    “No person shall knowingly enter or remain on a pub­\n    lic way or sidewalk adjacent to a reproductive health\n    care facility within a radius of 35 feet of any portion of\n    an entrance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health\n    care facility or within the area within a rectangle cre­\n    ated by extending the outside boundaries of any en­\n    trance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health care\n    facility in straight lines to the point where such lines\n    intersect the sideline of the street in front of such en­\n    trance, exit or driveway.” Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266,\n    §120E½(b) (West 2012).\nA “reproductive health care facility,” in turn, is defined as\n“a place, other than within or upon the grounds of a hospi­\n4                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntal, where abortions are offered or performed.” §120E½(a).\n  The 35-foot buffer zone applies only “during a facility’s\nbusiness hours,” and the area must be “clearly marked\nand posted.” §120E½(c). In practice, facilities typically\nmark the zones with painted arcs and posted signs on\nadjacent sidewalks and streets. A first violation of the\nstatute is punishable by a fine of up to $500, up to three\nmonths in prison, or both, while a subsequent offense is\npunishable by a fine of between $500 and $5,000, up to\ntwo and a half years in prison, or both. §120E½(d).\n  The Act exempts four classes of individuals: (1) “persons\nentering or leaving such facility”; (2) “employees or agents\nof such facility acting within the scope of their employ­\nment”; (3) “law enforcement, ambulance, firefighting,\nconstruction, utilities, public works and other municipal\nagents acting within the scope of their employment”; and\n(4) “persons using the public sidewalk or street right-\nof-way adjacent to such facility solely for the purpose\nof reaching a destination other than such facility.”\n§120E½(b)(1)–(4). The legislature also retained the sepa­\nrate provision from the 2000 version that proscribes the\nknowing obstruction of access to a facility. §120E½(e).\n                              B\n   Some of the individuals who stand outside Massachu­\nsetts abortion clinics are fairly described as protestors,\nwho express their moral or religious opposition to abortion\nthrough signs and chants or, in some cases, more aggres­\nsive methods such as face-to-face confrontation. Petition­\ners take a different tack. They attempt to engage women\napproaching the clinics in what they call “sidewalk coun­\nseling,” which involves offering information about alterna­\ntives to abortion and help pursuing those options. Peti­\ntioner Eleanor McCullen, for instance, will typically\ninitiate a conversation this way: “Good morning, may I\ngive you my literature? Is there anything I can do for you?\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nI’m available if you have any questions.” App. 138. If the\nwoman seems receptive, McCullen will provide additional\ninformation. McCullen and the other petitioners consider\nit essential to maintain a caring demeanor, a calm tone of\nvoice, and direct eye contact during these exchanges.\nSuch interactions, petitioners believe, are a much more\neffective means of dissuading women from having abor­\ntions than confrontational methods such as shouting or\nbrandishing signs, which in petitioners’ view tend only to\nantagonize their intended audience. In unrefuted testi­\nmony, petitioners say they have collectively persuaded\nhundreds of women to forgo abortions.\n   The buffer zones have displaced petitioners from their\nprevious positions outside the clinics. McCullen offers\ncounseling outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Boston,\nas do petitioners Jean Zarrella and Eric Cadin. Petitioner\nGregory Smith prays the rosary there. The clinic occupies\nits own building on a street corner. Its main door is re­\ncessed into an open foyer, approximately 12 feet back from\nthe public sidewalk. Before the Act was amended to cre­\nate the buffer zones, petitioners stood near the entryway\nto the foyer. Now a buffer zone—marked by a painted arc\nand a sign—surrounds the entrance. This zone extends 23\nfeet down the sidewalk in one direction, 26 feet in the\nother, and outward just one foot short of the curb. The\nclinic’s entrance adds another seven feet to the width of\nthe zone. Id., at 293–295. The upshot is that petitioners\nare effectively excluded from a 56-foot-wide expanse of the\npublic sidewalk in front of the clinic.1\n   Petitioners Mark Bashour and Nancy Clark offer coun­\nseling and information outside a Planned Parenthood\nclinic in Worcester. Unlike the Boston clinic, the Worces­\n——————\n  1 The zone could have extended an additional 21 feet in width under\n\nthe Act. Only the smaller area was marked off, however, so only that\narea has legal effect. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(c).\n6                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nter clinic sits well back from the public street and side­\nwalks. Patients enter the clinic in one of two ways. Those\narriving on foot turn off the public sidewalk and walk\ndown a nearly 54-foot-long private walkway to the main\nentrance. More than 85% of patients, however, arrive by\ncar, turning onto the clinic’s driveway from the street,\nparking in a private lot, and walking to the main entrance\non a private walkway.\n   Bashour and Clark would like to stand where the pri­\nvate walkway or driveway intersects the sidewalk and\noffer leaflets to patients as they walk or drive by. But a\npainted arc extends from the private walkway 35 feet\ndown the sidewalk in either direction and outward nearly\nto the curb on the opposite side of the street. Another arc\nsurrounds the driveway’s entrance, covering more than 93\nfeet of the sidewalk (including the width of the driveway)\nand extending across the street and nearly six feet onto\nthe sidewalk on the opposite side. Id., at 295–297. Bash­\nour and Clark must now stand either some distance down\nthe sidewalk from the private walkway and driveway or\nacross the street.\n   Petitioner Cyril Shea stands outside a Planned\nParenthood clinic in Springfield, which, like the Worcester\nclinic, is set back from the public streets. Approximately\n90% of patients arrive by car and park in the private lots\nsurrounding the clinic. Shea used to position himself at\nan entrance to one of the five driveways leading to the\nparking lots. Painted arcs now surround the entrances,\neach spanning approximately 100 feet of the sidewalk\nparallel to the street (again, including the width of the\ndriveways) and extending outward well into the street.\nId., at 297–299. Like petitioners at the Worcester clinic,\nShea now stands far down the sidewalk from the driveway\nentrances.\n   Petitioners at all three clinics claim that the buffer\nzones have considerably hampered their counseling ef­\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Although they have managed to conduct some coun­\nseling and to distribute some literature outside the buffer\nzones—particularly at the Boston clinic—they say they\nhave had many fewer conversations and distributed many\nfewer leaflets since the zones went into effect. Id., at 136–\n137, 180, 200.\n  The second statutory exemption allows clinic employees\nand agents acting within the scope of their employment to\nenter the buffer zones. Relying on this exemption, the\nBoston clinic uses “escorts” to greet women as they ap­\nproach the clinic, accompanying them through the zones to\nthe clinic entrance. Petitioners claim that the escorts\nsometimes thwart petitioners’ attempts to communicate\nwith patients by blocking petitioners from handing litera­\nture to patients, telling patients not to “pay any attention”\nor “listen to” petitioners, and disparaging petitioners as\n“crazy.” Id., at 165, 178.\n                             C\n   In January 2008, petitioners sued Attorney General\nCoakley and other Commonwealth officials. They sought\nto enjoin enforcement of the Act, alleging that it violates\nthe First and Fourteenth Amendments, both on its face\nand as applied to them. The District Court denied peti­\ntioners’ facial challenge after a bench trial based on a\nstipulated record. 573 F. Supp. 2d 382 (Mass. 2008).\n   The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. 571\nF. 3d 167 (2009). Relying extensively on its previous\ndecisions upholding the 2000 version of the Act, see\nMcGuire II, 386 F. 3d 45; McGuire I, 260 F. 3d 36, the\ncourt upheld the 2007 version as a reasonable “time, place,\nand manner” regulation under the test set forth in Ward v.\nRock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781 (1989). 571 F. 3d, at\n174–181. It also rejected petitioners’ arguments that the\nAct was substantially overbroad, void for vagueness, and\nan impermissible prior restraint. Id., at 181–184.\n8                  McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The case then returned to the District Court, which held\nthat the First Circuit’s decision foreclosed all but one of\npetitioners’ as-applied challenges. 759 F. Supp. 2d 133\n(2010). After another bench trial, it denied the remain-\ning as-applied challenge, finding that the Act left petition­\ners ample alternative channels of communication. 844\nF. Supp. 2d 206 (2012). The Court of Appeals once again\naffirmed. 708 F. 3d 1 (2013).\n  We granted certiorari. 570 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                              II\n   By its very terms, the Massachusetts Act regulates\naccess to “public way[s]” and “sidewalk[s].” Mass. Gen.\nLaws, ch. 266, §120E½(b) (Supp. 2007). Such areas occupy\na “special position in terms of First Amendment protec­\ntion” because of their historic role as sites for discussion\nand debate. United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 180\n(1983). These places—which we have labeled “traditional\npublic fora”—“ ‘have immemorially been held in trust for\nthe use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used\nfor purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts be­\ntween citizens, and discussing public questions.’ ” Pleas-\nant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 469 (2009)\n(quoting Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators’ Assn.,\n460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983)).\n   It is no accident that public streets and sidewalks have\ndeveloped as venues for the exchange of ideas. Even\ntoday, they remain one of the few places where a speaker\ncan be confident that he is not simply preaching to the\nchoir. With respect to other means of communication, an\nindividual confronted with an uncomfortable message can\nalways turn the page, change the channel, or leave the\nWeb site. Not so on public streets and sidewalks. There, a\nlistener often encounters speech he might otherwise tune\nout. In light of the First Amendment’s purpose “to pre­\nserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwill ultimately prevail,” FCC v. League of Women Voters of\nCal., 468 U. S. 364, 377 (1984) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), this aspect of traditional public fora is a virtue,\nnot a vice.\n    In short, traditional public fora are areas that have\nhistorically been open to the public for speech activities.\nThus, even though the Act says nothing about speech on\nits face, there is no doubt—and respondents do not dis­\npute—that it restricts access to traditional public fora and\nis therefore subject to First Amendment scrutiny. See\nBrief for Respondents 26 (although “[b]y its terms, the Act\nregulates only conduct,” it “incidentally regulates the\nplace and time of protected speech”).\n    Consistent with the traditionally open character of\npublic streets and sidewalks, we have held that the gov­\nernment’s ability to restrict speech in such locations is\n“very limited.” Grace, supra, at 177. In particular, the\nguiding First Amendment principle that the “government\nhas no power to restrict expression because of its message,\nits ideas, its subject matter, or its content” applies with\nfull force in a traditional public forum. Police Dept. of\nChicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972). As a general\nrule, in such a forum the government may not “selectively\n. . . shield the public from some kinds of speech on the\nground that they are more offensive than others.”\nErznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 209 (1975).\n    We have, however, afforded the government somewhat\nwider leeway to regulate features of speech unrelated to\nits content. “[E]ven in a public forum the government may\nimpose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or man­\nner of protected speech, provided the restrictions ‘are\njustified without reference to the content of the regulated\nspeech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a signifi­\ncant governmental interest, and that they leave open\nample alternative channels for communication of the\ninformation.’ ” Ward, 491 U. S., at 791 (quoting Clark v.\n10                     McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCommunity for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293\n(1984)).2\n  While the parties agree that this test supplies the\nproper framework for assessing the constitutionality of the\nMassachusetts Act, they disagree about whether the Act\nsatisfies the test’s three requirements.\n                             III\n   Petitioners contend that the Act is not content neutral\nfor two independent reasons: First, they argue that it\ndiscriminates against abortion-related speech because it\nestablishes buffer zones only at clinics that perform abor­\ntions. Second, petitioners contend that the Act, by ex­\nempting clinic employees and agents, favors one viewpoint\nabout abortion over the other. If either of these argu­\nments is correct, then the Act must satisfy strict scruti­\nny—that is, it must be the least restrictive means of\nachieving a compelling state interest. See United States v.\nPlayboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813\n(2000). Respondents do not argue that the Act can survive\nthis exacting standard.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA objects to our decision to consider\nwhether the statute is content based and thus subject to\nstrict scrutiny, given that we ultimately conclude that it is\nnot narrowly tailored. Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). But we think it unexceptional to perform the\nfirst part of a multipart constitutional analysis first. The\ncontent-neutrality prong of the Ward test is logically\nantecedent to the narrow-tailoring prong, because it de­\ntermines the appropriate level of scrutiny. It is not unu­\nsual for the Court to proceed sequentially in applying a\n——————\n  2 A different analysis would of course be required if the government\n\nproperty at issue were not a traditional public forum but instead “a\nforum that is limited to use by certain groups or dedicated solely to the\ndiscussion of certain subjects.” Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555\nU. S. 460, 470 (2009).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstitutional test, even when the preliminary steps turn\nout not to be dispositive. See, e.g., Bartnicki v. Vopper,\n532 U. S. 514, 526–527 (2001); Holder v. Humanitarian\nLaw Project, 561 U. S. 1, 25–28 (2010) (concluding that a\nlaw was content based even though it ultimately survived\nstrict scrutiny).\n   The Court does sometimes assume, without deciding,\nthat a law is subject to a less stringent level of scrutiny, as\nwe did earlier this Term in McCutcheon v. Federal Elec-\ntion Commission, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (plurality opin­\nion) (slip op., at 10). But the distinction between that case\nand this one seems clear: Applying any standard of review\nother than intermediate scrutiny in McCutcheon—the\nstandard that was assumed to apply—would have re­\nquired overruling a precedent. There is no similar reason\nto forgo the ordinary order of operations in this case.\n   At the same time, there is good reason to address con­\ntent neutrality. In discussing whether the Act is narrowly\ntailored, see Part IV, infra, we identify a number of less­\nrestrictive alternative measures that the Massachusetts\nLegislature might have adopted. Some apply only at\nabortion clinics, which raises the question whether those\nprovisions are content neutral. See infra, at 12–15. While\nwe need not (and do not) endorse any of those measures, it\nwould be odd to consider them as possible alternatives if\nthey were presumptively unconstitutional because they\nwere content based and thus subject to strict scrutiny.\n                                A\n  The Act applies only at a “reproductive health care\nfacility,” defined as “a place, other than within or upon the\ngrounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered or per­\nformed.” Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(a). Given\nthis definition, petitioners argue, “virtually all speech\naffected by the Act is speech concerning abortion,” thus\nrendering the Act content based. Brief for Petitioners 23.\n12                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   We disagree. To begin, the Act does not draw content­\nbased distinctions on its face. Contrast Boos v. Barry, 485\nU. S. 312, 315 (1988) (ordinance prohibiting the display\nwithin 500 feet of a foreign embassy of any sign that tends\nto bring the foreign government into “ ‘public odium’ ” or\n“ ‘public disrepute’ ”); Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 465\n(1980) (statute prohibiting all residential picketing except\n“peaceful labor picketing”). The Act would be content\nbased if it required “enforcement authorities” to “examine\nthe content of the message that is conveyed to determine\nwhether” a violation has occurred. League of Women\nVoters of Cal., supra, at 383. But it does not. Whether\npetitioners violate the Act “depends” not “on what they\nsay,” Humanitarian Law Project, supra, at 27, but simply\non where they say it. Indeed, petitioners can violate the\nAct merely by standing in a buffer zone, without display­\ning a sign or uttering a word.\n   It is true, of course, that by limiting the buffer zones to\nabortion clinics, the Act has the “inevitable effect” of re­\nstricting abortion-related speech more than speech on\nother subjects. Brief for Petitioners 24 (quoting United\nStates v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 384 (1968)). But a facially\nneutral law does not become content based simply be-\ncause it may disproportionately affect speech on certain\ntopics. On the contrary, “[a] regulation that serves pur­\nposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed\nneutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speak­\ners or messages but not others.” Ward, supra, at 791. The\nquestion in such a case is whether the law is “ ‘justified\nwithout reference to the content of the regulated speech.’ ”\nRenton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48 (1986)\n(quoting Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens\nConsumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976); empha­\nsis deleted).\n   The Massachusetts Act is. Its stated purpose is to “in­\ncrease forthwith public safety at reproductive health care\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfacilities.” 2007 Mass. Acts p. 660. Respondents have\narticulated similar purposes before this Court—namely,\n“public safety, patient access to healthcare, and the unob­\nstructed use of public sidewalks and roadways.” Brief for\nRespondents 27; see, e.g., App. 51 (testimony of Attorney\nGeneral Coakley); id., at 67–70 (testimony of Captain\nWilliam B. Evans of the Boston Police); id., at 79–80 (tes­\ntimony of Mary Beth Heffernan, Undersecretary for Crim­\ninal Justice); id., at 122–124 (affidavit of Captain Evans).\nIt is not the case that “[e]very objective indication shows\nthat the provision’s primary purpose is to restrict speech\nthat opposes abortion.” Post, at 7.\n   We have previously deemed the foregoing concerns to be\ncontent neutral. See Boos, 485 U. S., at 321 (identifying\n“congestion,” “interference with ingress or egress,” and\n“the need to protect . . . security” as content-neutral con­\ncerns). Obstructed access and congested sidewalks are\nproblems no matter what caused them. A group of indi­\nviduals can obstruct clinic access and clog sidewalks just\nas much when they loiter as when they protest abortion or\ncounsel patients.\n   To be clear, the Act would not be content neutral if it\nwere concerned with undesirable effects that arise from\n“the direct impact of speech on its audience” or “[l]isteners’\nreactions to speech.” Ibid. If, for example, the speech\noutside Massachusetts abortion clinics caused offense or\nmade listeners uncomfortable, such offense or discomfort\nwould not give the Commonwealth a content-neutral\njustification to restrict the speech. All of the problems\nidentified by the Commonwealth here, however, arise\nirrespective of any listener’s reactions. Whether or not a\nsingle person reacts to abortion protestors’ chants or peti­\ntioners’ counseling, large crowds outside abortion clinics\ncan still compromise public safety, impede access, and\nobstruct sidewalks.\n   Petitioners do not really dispute that the Common­\n14                McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwealth’s interests in ensuring safety and preventing ob­\nstruction are, as a general matter, content neutral. But\npetitioners note that these interests “apply outside every\nbuilding in the State that hosts any activity that might\noccasion protest or comment,” not just abortion clinics.\nBrief for Petitioners 24. By choosing to pursue these\ninterests only at abortion clinics, petitioners argue, the\nMassachusetts Legislature evinced a purpose to “single[ ]\nout for regulation speech about one particular topic: abor­\ntion.” Reply Brief 9.\n   We cannot infer such a purpose from the Act’s limited\nscope. The broad reach of a statute can help confirm that\nit was not enacted to burden a narrower category of disfa­\nvored speech. See Kagan, Private Speech, Public Purpose:\nThe Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment\nDoctrine, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 413, 451–452 (1996). At the\nsame time, however, “States adopt laws to address the\nproblems that confront them. The First Amendment does\nnot require States to regulate for problems that do not\nexist.” Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 207 (1992)\n(plurality opinion).       The Massachusetts Legislature\namended the Act in 2007 in response to a problem that\nwas, in its experience, limited to abortion clinics. There\nwas a record of crowding, obstruction, and even violence\noutside such clinics. There were apparently no similar\nrecurring problems associated with other kinds of\nhealthcare facilities, let alone with “every building in the\nState that hosts any activity that might occasion protest\nor comment.” Brief for Petitioners 24. In light of the\nlimited nature of the problem, it was reasonable for the\nMassachusetts Legislature to enact a limited solution.\nWhen selecting among various options for combating a\nparticular problem, legislatures should be encouraged to\nchoose the one that restricts less speech, not more.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA objects that the statute does restrict\nmore speech than necessary, because “only one [Massa­\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchusetts abortion clinic] is known to have been beset by\nthe problems that the statute supposedly addresses.”\nPost, at 7. But there are no grounds for inferring content­\nbased discrimination here simply because the legislature\nacted with respect to abortion facilities generally rather\nthan proceeding on a facility-by-facility basis. On these\nfacts, the poor fit noted by JUSTICE SCALIA goes to the\nquestion of narrow tailoring, which we consider below.\nSee infra, at 26–28.\n                              B\n   Petitioners also argue that the Act is content based\nbecause it exempts four classes of individuals, Mass. Gen.\nLaws, ch. 266, §§120E½(b)(1)–(4), one of which comprises\n“employees or agents of [a reproductive healthcare] facil-\nity acting within the scope of their employment.”\n§120E½(b)(2). This exemption, petitioners say, favors one\nside in the abortion debate and thus constitutes viewpoint\ndiscrimination—an “egregious form of content discrimina­\ntion,” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,\n515 U. S. 819, 829 (1995). In particular, petitioners argue\nthat the exemption allows clinic employees and agents—\nincluding the volunteers who “escort” patients arriving at\nthe Boston clinic—to speak inside the buffer zones.\n   It is of course true that “an exemption from an other­\nwise permissible regulation of speech may represent a\ngovernmental ‘attempt to give one side of a debatable\npublic question an advantage in expressing its views to\nthe people.’ ” City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 51\n(1994) (quoting First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435\nU. S. 765, 785–786 (1978)). At least on the record before\nus, however, the statutory exemption for clinic employees\nand agents acting within the scope of their employment\ndoes not appear to be such an attempt.\n   There is nothing inherently suspect about providing\nsome kind of exemption to allow individuals who work at\n16                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe clinics to enter or remain within the buffer zones. In\nparticular, the exemption cannot be regarded as simply a\ncarve-out for the clinic escorts; it also covers employees\nsuch as the maintenance worker shoveling a snowy side­\nwalk or the security guard patrolling a clinic entrance, see\nApp. 95 (affidavit of Michael T. Baniukiewicz).\n   Given the need for an exemption for clinic employees,\nthe “scope of their employment” qualification simply en­\nsures that the exemption is limited to its purpose of allow­\ning the employees to do their jobs. It performs the same\nfunction as the identical “scope of their employment”\nrestriction on the exemption for “law enforcement, ambu­\nlance, fire-fighting, construction, utilities, public works\nand other municipal agents.” §120E½(b)(3). Contrary to\nthe suggestion of JUSTICE SCALIA, post, at 11–12, there is\nlittle reason to suppose that the Massachusetts Legisla­\nture intended to incorporate a common law doctrine devel­\noped for determining vicarious liability in tort when it\nused the phrase “scope of their employment” for the wholly\ndifferent purpose of defining the scope of an exemption to\na criminal statute. The limitation instead makes clear—\nwith respect to both clinic employees and municipal\nagents—that exempted individuals are allowed inside the\nzones only to perform those acts authorized by their em­\nployers. There is no suggestion in the record that any of\nthe clinics authorize their employees to speak about abor­\ntion in the buffer zones. The “scope of their employment”\nlimitation thus seems designed to protect against exactly\nthe sort of conduct that petitioners and JUSTICE SCALIA\nfear.\n   Petitioners did testify in this litigation about instances\nin which escorts at the Boston clinic had expressed views\nabout abortion to the women they were accompanying,\nthwarted petitioners’ attempts to speak and hand litera­\nture to the women, and disparaged petitioners in various\nways. See App. 165, 168–169, 177–178, 189–190. It is\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nunclear from petitioners’ testimony whether these alleged\nincidents occurred within the buffer zones. There is no\nviewpoint discrimination problem if the incidents occurred\noutside the zones because petitioners are equally free to\nsay whatever they would like in that area.\n  Even assuming the incidents occurred inside the zones,\nthe record does not suggest that they involved speech\nwithin the scope of the escorts’ employment. If the speech\nwas beyond the scope of their employment, then each of\nthe alleged incidents would violate the Act’s express\nterms. Petitioners’ complaint would then be that the\npolice were failing to enforce the Act equally against clinic\nescorts. Cf. Hoye v. City of Oakland, 653 F. 3d 835, 849–\n852 (CA9 2011) (finding selective enforcement of a similar\nordinance in Oakland, California). While such allegations\nmight state a claim of official viewpoint discrimination,\nthat would not go to the validity of the Act. In any event,\npetitioners nowhere allege selective enforcement.\n  It would be a very different question if it turned out that\na clinic authorized escorts to speak about abortion inside\nthe buffer zones. See post, at 1–2 (ALITO, J., concurring in\njudgment). In that case, the escorts would not seem to be\nviolating the Act because the speech would be within the\nscope of their employment.3 The Act’s exemption for clinic\n——————\n  3 Less than two weeks after the instant litigation was initiated, the\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General’s Office issued a guidance letter\nclarifying the application of the four exemptions. The letter interpreted\nthe exemptions as not permitting clinic employees or agents, municipal\nemployees or agents, or individuals passing by clinics “to express their\nviews about abortion or to engage in any other partisan speech within\nthe buffer zone.” App. 93, 93–94. While this interpretation supports\nour conclusion that the employee exemption does not render the Act\nviewpoint based, we do not consider it in our analysis because it ap­\npears to broaden the scope of the Act—a criminal statute—rather than\nto adopt a “ ‘limiting construction.’ ” Ward v.

COAKLEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nemployees would then facilitate speech on only one side of\nthe abortion debate—a clear form of viewpoint discrimina­\ntion that would support an as-applied challenge to the\nbuffer zone at that clinic. But the record before us con­\ntains insufficient evidence to show that the exemption\noperates in this way at any of the clinics, perhaps because\nthe clinics do not want to doom the Act by allowing their\nemployees to speak about abortion within the buffer\nzones.4\n   We thus conclude that the Act is neither content nor\nviewpoint based and therefore need not be analyzed under\nstrict scrutiny.\n                            IV\n   Even though the Act is content neutral, it still must be\n“narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental\ninterest.” Ward, 491 U. S., at 796 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The tailoring requirement does not sim­\nply guard against an impermissible desire to censor. The\ngovernment may attempt to suppress speech not only\nbecause it disagrees with the message being expressed,\nbut also for mere convenience. Where certain speech is\nassociated with particular problems, silencing the speech\nis sometimes the path of least resistance. But by demand­\n——————\n   4 Of course we do not hold that “[s]peech restrictions favoring one\n\nviewpoint over another are not content based unless it can be shown\nthat the favored viewpoint has actually been expressed.” Post, at 13.\nWe instead apply an uncontroversial principle of constitutional adjudi­\ncation: that a plaintiff generally cannot prevail on an as-applied chal­\nlenge without showing that the law has in fact been (or is sufficiently\nlikely to be) unconstitutionally applied to him. Specifically, when\nsomeone challenges a law as viewpoint discriminatory but it is not clear\nfrom the face of the law which speakers will be allowed to speak, he\nmust show that he was prevented from speaking while someone espous­\ning another viewpoint was permitted to do so. JUSTICE SCALIA can\ndecry this analysis as “astonishing” only by quoting a sentence that is\nexplicitly limited to as-applied challenges and treating it as relevant to\nfacial challenges.

National\nFederation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 795\n(1988).\n   For a content-neutral time, place, or manner regulation\nto be narrowly tailored, it must not “burden substantially\nmore speech than is necessary to further the government’s\nlegitimate interests.” Ward, 491 U. S., at 799. Such a\nregulation, unlike a content-based restriction of speech,\n“need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means\nof ” serving the government’s interests. Id., at 798. But\nthe government still “may not regulate expression in such\na manner that a substantial portion of the burden on\nspeech does not serve to advance its goals.” Id., at 799.\n                             A\n   As noted, respondents claim that the Act promotes\n“public safety, patient access to healthcare, and the unob­\nstructed use of public sidewalks and roadways.” Brief for\nRespondents 27. Petitioners do not dispute the signifi­\ncance of these interests. We have, moreover, previously\nrecognized the legitimacy of the government’s interests in\n“ensuring public safety and order, promoting the free flow\nof traffic on streets and sidewalks, protecting property\nrights, and protecting a woman’s freedom to seek pregnancy­\nrelated services.”     Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of\nWestern N. Y., 519 U. S. 357, 376 (1997). See also Madsen\nv. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 767–768\n(1994). The buffer zones clearly serve these interests.\n   At the same time, the buffer zones impose serious bur­\ndens on petitioners’ speech. At each of the three Planned\nParenthood clinics where petitioners attempt to counsel\npatients, the zones carve out a significant portion of the\nadjacent public sidewalks, pushing petitioners well back\nfrom the clinics’ entrances and driveways. The zones\n20                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthereby compromise petitioners’ ability to initiate the\nclose, personal conversations that they view as essential to\n“sidewalk counseling.”\n   For example, in uncontradicted testimony, McCullen\nexplained that she often cannot distinguish patients from\npassersby outside the Boston clinic in time to initiate a\nconversation before they enter the buffer zone. App. 135.\nAnd even when she does manage to begin a discussion\noutside the zone, she must stop abruptly at its painted\nborder, which she believes causes her to appear “untrust­\nworthy” or “suspicious.” Id., at 135, 152. Given these\nlimitations, McCullen is often reduced to raising her voice\nat patients from outside the zone—a mode of communica­\ntion sharply at odds with the compassionate message she\nwishes to convey. Id., at 133, 152–153. Clark gave similar\ntestimony about her experience at the Worcester clinic.\nId., at 243–244.\n   These burdens on petitioners’ speech have clearly taken\ntheir toll. Although McCullen claims that she has per­\nsuaded about 80 women not to terminate their pregnan­\ncies since the 2007 amendment, App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a,\nshe also says that she reaches “far fewer people” than she\ndid before the amendment, App. 137. Zarrella reports an\neven more precipitous decline in her success rate: She\nestimated having about 100 successful interactions over\nthe years before the 2007 amendment, but not a single one\nsince. Id., at 180. And as for the Worcester clinic, Clark\ntestified that “only one woman out of 100 will make the\neffort to walk across [the street] to speak with [her].” Id.,\nat 217.\n   The buffer zones have also made it substantially more\ndifficult for petitioners to distribute literature to arriving\npatients. As explained, because petitioners in Boston\ncannot readily identify patients before they enter the zone,\nthey often cannot approach them in time to place litera­\nture near their hands—the most effective means of getting\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

In Worcester and\nSpringfield, the zones have pushed petitioners so far back\nfrom the clinics’ driveways that they can no longer even\nattempt to offer literature as drivers turn into the parking\nlots. Id., at 213, 218, 252–253. In short, the Act operates\nto deprive petitioners of their two primary methods of\ncommunicating with patients.\n  The Court of Appeals and respondents are wrong to\ndownplay these burdens on petitioners’ speech. As the\nCourt of Appeals saw it, the Constitution does not accord\n“special protection” to close conversations or “handbilling.”\n571 F. 3d, at 180. But while the First Amendment does\nnot guarantee a speaker the right to any particular form of\nexpression, some forms—such as normal conversation and\nleafletting on a public sidewalk—have historically been\nmore closely associated with the transmission of ideas\nthan others.\n  In the context of petition campaigns, we have observed\nthat “one-on-one communication” is “the most effective,\nfundamental, and perhaps economical avenue of political\ndiscourse.” Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 424 (1988). See\nalso Schenck, supra, at 377 (invalidating a “floating”\nbuffer zone around people entering an abortion clinic\npartly on the ground that it prevented protestors “from\ncommunicating a message from a normal conversational\ndistance or handing leaflets to people entering or leaving\nthe clinics who are walking on the public sidewalks”). And\n“handing out leaflets in the advocacy of a politically con­\ntroversial viewpoint . . . is the essence of First Amendment\nexpression”; “[n]o form of speech is entitled to greater\nconstitutional protection.” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections\nComm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 347 (1995). See also Schenck,\nsupra, at 377 (“Leafletting and commenting on matters of\npublic concern are classic forms of speech that lie at the\nheart of the First Amendment”). When the government\nmakes it more difficult to engage in these modes of com­\n22                    McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nmunication, it imposes an especially significant First\nAmendment burden.5\n   Respondents also emphasize that the Act does not pre­\nvent petitioners from engaging in various forms of “pro­\ntest”—such as chanting slogans and displaying signs—\noutside the buffer zones. Brief for Respondents 50–54.\nThat misses the point. Petitioners are not protestors.\nThey seek not merely to express their opposition to abor­\ntion, but to inform women of various alternatives and to\nprovide help in pursuing them. Petitioners believe that\nthey can accomplish this objective only through personal,\ncaring, consensual conversations. And for good reason: It\nis easier to ignore a strained voice or a waving hand than\na direct greeting or an outstretched arm. While the record\nindicates that petitioners have been able to have a number\nof quiet conversations outside the buffer zones, respond­\nents have not refuted petitioners’ testimony that the con­\nversations have been far less frequent and far less success­\nful since the buffer zones were instituted. It is thus no\nanswer to say that petitioners can still be “seen and\nheard” by women within the buffer zones. Id., at 51–53. If\nall that the women can see and hear are vociferous oppo­\nnents of abortion, then the buffer zones have effectively\nstifled petitioners’ message.\n   Finally, respondents suggest that, at the Worcester and\nSpringfield clinics, petitioners are prevented from com­\nmunicating with patients not by the buffer zones but by\nthe fact that most patients arrive by car and park in the\n——————\n  5 As a leading historian has noted:\n  “It was in this form—as pamphlets—that much of the most important\nand characteristic writing of the American Revolution appeared.

It is true that the layout of\nthe two clinics would prevent petitioners from approach­\ning the clinics’ doorways, even without the buffer zones.\nBut petitioners do not claim a right to trespass on the\nclinics’ property. They instead claim a right to stand on\nthe public sidewalks by the driveway as cars turn into the\nparking lot. Before the buffer zones, they could do so.\nNow they must stand a substantial distance away. The\nAct alone is responsible for that restriction on their ability\nto convey their message.\n                             B\n                             1\n   The buffer zones burden substantially more speech than\nnecessary to achieve the Commonwealth’s asserted inter­\nests. At the outset, we note that the Act is truly excep­\ntional: Respondents and their amici identify no other\nState with a law that creates fixed buffer zones around\nabortion clinics.6 That of course does not mean that the\nlaw is invalid. It does, however, raise concern that the\nCommonwealth has too readily forgone options that could\nserve its interests just as well, without substantially\nburdening the kind of speech in which petitioners wish to\nengage.\n   That is the case here. The Commonwealth’s interests\ninclude ensuring public safety outside abortion clinics,\npreventing harassment and intimidation of patients and\nclinic staff, and combating deliberate obstruction of clinic\nentrances. The Act itself contains a separate provision,\nsubsection (e)—unchallenged by petitioners—that prohib­\nits much of this conduct. That provision subjects to crimi­\nnal punishment “[a]ny person who knowingly obstructs,\ndetains, hinders, impedes or blocks another person’s entry\n\n——————\n  6 Amici do identify five localities with laws similar to the Act here.\n\nBrief for State of New York et al. as Amici Curiae 14, n. 7.\n24                     McCULLEN v.

Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(e).7 If Massachusetts deter­\nmines that broader prohibitions along the same lines are\nnecessary, it could enact legislation similar to the federal\nFreedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 (FACE\nAct), 18 U. S. C. §248(a)(1), which subjects to both crimi­\nnal and civil penalties anyone who “by force or threat of\nforce or by physical obstruction, intentionally injures,\nintimidates or interferes with or attempts to injure, intim­\nidate or interfere with any person because that person is\nor has been, or in order to intimidate such person or any\nother person or any class of persons from, obtaining or\nproviding reproductive health services.” Some dozen other\nStates have done so. See Brief for State of New York et al.\nas Amici Curiae 13, and n. 6. If the Commonwealth is\nparticularly concerned about harassment, it could also\nconsider an ordinance such as the one adopted in New\nYork City that not only prohibits obstructing access to a\nclinic, but also makes it a crime “to follow and harass\nanother person within 15 feet of the premises of a repro­\nductive health care facility.” N. Y. C. Admin. Code §8–\n803(a)(3) (2014).8\n   The Commonwealth points to a substantial public safety\nrisk created when protestors obstruct driveways leading to\nthe clinics.

Whether such a law would pass constitutional muster would\ndepend on a number of other factors, such as whether the term “har­\nassment” had been authoritatively construed to avoid vagueness and\noverbreadth problems of the sort noted by JUSTICE SCALIA.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Any such obstruc­\ntion can readily be addressed through existing local ordi­\nnances. See, e.g., Worcester, Mass., Revised Ordinances of\n2008, ch. 12, §25(b) (“No person shall stand, or place any\nobstruction of any kind, upon any street, sidewalk or\ncrosswalk in such a manner as to obstruct a free passage\nfor travelers thereon”); Boston, Mass., Municipal Code, ch.\n16–41.2(d) (2013) (“No person shall solicit while walking\non, standing on or going into any street or highway used\nfor motor vehicle travel, or any area appurtenant thereto\n(including medians, shoulder areas, bicycle lanes, ramps\nand exit ramps)”).\n   All of the foregoing measures are, of course, in addition\nto available generic criminal statutes forbidding assault,\nbreach of the peace, trespass, vandalism, and the like.\n   In addition, subsection (e) of the Act, the FACE Act, and\nthe New York City anti-harassment ordinance are all\nenforceable not only through criminal prosecutions but\nalso through public and private civil actions for injunc­\ntions and other equitable relief. See Mass. Gen. Laws\n§120E½(f); 18 U. S. C. §248(c)(1); N. Y. C. Admin. Code\n§§8–804, 8–805. We have previously noted the First\nAmendment virtues of targeted injunctions as alternatives\nto broad, prophylactic measures. Such an injunction\n“regulates the activities, and perhaps the speech, of a\ngroup,” but only “because of the group’s past actions in the\ncontext of a specific dispute between real parties.” Mad-\nsen, 512 U. S., at 762 (emphasis added). Moreover, given\nthe equitable nature of injunctive relief, courts can tailor a\nremedy to ensure that it restricts no more speech than\nnecessary. See, e.g., id., at 770; Schenck, 519 U. S., at\n380–381. In short, injunctive relief focuses on the precise\nindividuals and the precise conduct causing a particular\nproblem. The Act, by contrast, categorically excludes non­\nexempt individuals from the buffer zones, unnecessarily\nsweeping in innocent individuals and their speech.\n26                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Commonwealth also asserts an interest in prevent­\ning congestion in front of abortion clinics. According to\nrespondents, even when individuals do not deliberately\nobstruct access to clinics, they can inadvertently do so\nsimply by gathering in large numbers. But the Common­\nwealth could address that problem through more targeted\nmeans. Some localities, for example, have ordinances that\nrequire crowds blocking a clinic entrance to disperse when\nordered to do so by the police, and that forbid the individ­\nuals to reassemble within a certain distance of the clinic\nfor a certain period. See Brief for State of New York et al.\nas Amici Curiae 14–15, and n. 10. We upheld a similar\nlaw forbidding three or more people “ ‘to congregate within\n500 feet of [a foreign embassy], and refuse to disperse\nafter having been ordered so to do by the police,’ ” Boos,\n485 U. S., at 316 (quoting D. C. Code §22–1115 (1938))—\nan order the police could give only when they “ ‘reasonably\nbelieve[d] that a threat to the security or peace of the\nembassy [was] present,’ ” 485 U. S., at 330 (quoting Finzer\nv. Barry, 798 F. 2d 1450, 1471 (CADC 1986)).\n   And to the extent the Commonwealth argues that even\nthese types of laws are ineffective, it has another problem.\nThe portions of the record that respondents cite to support\nthe anticongestion interest pertain mainly to one place at\none time: the Boston Planned Parenthood clinic on Satur­\nday mornings. App. 69–71, 88–89, 96, 123. Respondents\npoint us to no evidence that individuals regularly gather\nat other clinics, or at other times in Boston, in sufficiently\nlarge groups to obstruct access. For a problem shown to\narise only once a week in one city at one clinic, creating\n35-foot buffer zones at every clinic across the Common­\nwealth is hardly a narrowly tailored solution.\n   The point is not that Massachusetts must enact all or\neven any of the proposed measures discussed above. The\npoint is instead that the Commonwealth has available to it\na variety of approaches that appear capable of serving its\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

They also point to the Common­\nwealth’s experience under the 2000 version of the Act,\nduring which the police found it difficult to enforce the six­\nfoot no-approach zones given the “frenetic” activity in front\nof clinic entrances. Brief for Respondents 43. According to\nrespondents, this history shows that Massachusetts has\ntried less restrictive alternatives to the buffer zones, to no\navail.\n   We cannot accept that contention. Although respond­\nents claim that Massachusetts “tried other laws already\non the books,” id., at 41, they identify not a single prosecu­\ntion brought under those laws within at least the last 17\nyears. And while they also claim that the Commonwealth\n“tried injunctions,” ibid., the last injunctions they cite date\nto the 1990s, see id., at 42 (citing Planned Parenthood\nLeague of Mass., Inc. v. Bell, 424 Mass. 573, 677 N. E. 2d\n204 (1997); Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. v.\nOperation Rescue, 406 Mass. 701, 550 N. E. 2d 1361\n(1990)). In short, the Commonwealth has not shown that\nit seriously undertook to address the problem with less\nintrusive tools readily available to it. Nor has it shown\nthat it considered different methods that other jurisdic­\ntions have found effective.\n   Respondents contend that the alternatives we have\ndiscussed suffer from two defects: First, given the “wide­\nspread” nature of the problem, it is simply not “practica­\nble” to rely on individual prosecutions and injunctions.\n28                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Respondents 45. But far from being “wide­\nspread,” the problem appears from the record to be limited\nprincipally to the Boston clinic on Saturday mornings.\nMoreover, by their own account, the police appear per-\nfectly capable of singling out lawbreakers. The legislative\ntestimony preceding the 2007 Act revealed substantial\npolice and video monitoring at the clinics, especially when\nlarge gatherings were anticipated. Captain Evans testi­\nfied that his officers are so familiar with the scene outside\nthe Boston clinic that they “know all the players down\nthere.” App. 69. And Attorney General Coakley relied on\nvideo surveillance to show legislators conduct she thought\nwas “clearly against the law.” Id., at 78. If Common­\nwealth officials can compile an extensive record of obstruc­\ntion and harassment to support their preferred legislation,\nwe do not see why they cannot do the same to support\ninjunctions and prosecutions against those who might\ndeliberately flout the law.\n   The second supposed defect in the alternatives we have\nidentified is that laws like subsection (e) of the Act and the\nfederal FACE Act require a showing of intentional or\ndeliberate obstruction, intimidation, or harassment, which\nis often difficult to prove. Brief for Respondents 45–47.\nAs Captain Evans predicted in his legislative testimony,\nfixed buffer zones would “make our job so much easier.”\nApp. 68.\n   Of course they would. But that is not enough to satisfy\nthe First Amendment. To meet the requirement of narrow\ntailoring, the government must demonstrate that alterna­\ntive measures that burden substantially less speech would\nfail to achieve the government’s interests, not simply that\nthe chosen route is easier. A painted line on the sidewalk\nis easy to enforce, but the prime objective of the First\nAmendment is not efficiency. In any case, we do not think\nthat showing intentional obstruction is nearly so difficult\nin this context as respondents suggest. To determine\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                 29\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether a protestor intends to block access to a clinic, a\npolice officer need only order him to move. If he refuses,\nthen there is no question that his continued conduct is\nknowing or intentional.\n   For similar reasons, respondents’ reliance on our deci­\nsion in Burson v. Freeman is misplaced. There, we upheld\na state statute that established 100-foot buffer zones\noutside polling places on election day within which no one\ncould display or distribute campaign materials or solicit\nvotes. 504 U. S., at 193–194. We approved the buffer\nzones as a valid prophylactic measure, noting that existing\n“[i]ntimidation and interference laws fall short of serving a\nState’s compelling interests because they ‘deal with only\nthe most blatant and specific attempts’ to impede elec­\ntions.” Id., at 206–207 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.\n1, 28 (1976) (per curiam)). Such laws were insufficient\nbecause “[v]oter intimidation and election fraud are . . .\ndifficult to detect.” Burson, 504 U. S., at 208. Obstruction\nof abortion clinics and harassment of patients, by contrast,\nare anything but subtle.\n   We also noted in Burson that under state law, “law\nenforcement officers generally are barred from the vicinity\nof the polls to avoid any appearance of coercion in the\nelectoral process,” with the result that “many acts of inter­\nference would go undetected.” Id., at 207. Not so here.\nAgain, the police maintain a significant presence outside\nMassachusetts abortion clinics. The buffer zones in Bur-\nson were justified because less restrictive measures were\ninadequate. Respondents have not shown that to be the\ncase here.\n   Given the vital First Amendment interests at stake, it is\nnot enough for Massachusetts simply to say that other\napproaches have not worked.9\n——————\n  9 Because we find that the Act is not narrowly tailored, we need not\n\nconsider whether the Act leaves open ample alternative channels of\n30                   McCULLEN v.

See,\ne.g., Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703 (2000); Madsen v.\nWomen’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753 (1994).\n   The second half of the Court’s analysis today, invalidat­\ning the law at issue because of inadequate “tailoring,” is\ncertainly attractive to those of us who oppose an abortion­\nspeech edition of the First Amendment. But think again.\nThis is an opinion that has Something for Everyone, and\nthe more significant portion continues the onward march\nof abortion-speech-only jurisprudence. That is the first\nhalf of the Court’s analysis, which concludes that a statute\nof this sort is not content based and hence not subject to\nso-called strict scrutiny. The Court reaches out to decide\nthat question unnecessarily—or at least unnecessarily\ninsofar as legal analysis is concerned.\n   I disagree with the Court’s dicta (Part III) and hence see\nno reason to opine on its holding (Part IV).\n2                      McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n        I. The Court’s Content-Neutrality Discussion \n\n                        Is Unnecessary \n\n   The gratuitous portion of today’s opinion is Part III,\nwhich concludes—in seven pages of the purest dicta—that\nsubsection (b) of the Massachusetts Reproductive Health\nCare Facilities Act is not specifically directed at speech\nopposing (or even concerning) abortion and hence need not\nmeet the strict-scrutiny standard applicable to content­\nbased speech regulations.1 Inasmuch as Part IV holds\nthat the Act is unconstitutional because it does not survive\nthe lesser level of scrutiny associated with content-neutral\n“time, place, and manner” regulations, there is no princi­\npled reason for the majority to decide whether the statute\nis subject to strict scrutiny.\n   Just a few months past, the Court found it unnecessary\nto “parse the differences between . . . two [available]\nstandards” where a statute challenged on First Amend­\nment grounds “fail[s] even under the [less demanding]\ntest.” McCutcheon v. Federal Election Comm’n, 572 U. S.\n___, ___ (2014) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 10). What\nhas changed since then? Quite simple: This is an abortion\ncase, and McCutcheon was not.2 By engaging in constitu­\ntional dictum here (and reaching the wrong result), the\n——————\n  1 To reiterate, the challenged provision states that “[n]o person shall\n\nknowingly enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk adjacent to a\nreproductive health care facility within a radius of 35 feet of any\nportion of an entrance, exit or driveway” of such a facility or within an\nalternative rectangular area. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(b)\n(West 2012). And the statute defines a “reproductive health care\nfacility” as “a place, other than within or upon the grounds of a hospi­\ntal, where abortions are offered or performed.” §120E½(a).\n  2 The Court claims that McCutcheon declined to consider the more\n\nrigorous standard of review because applying it “would have required\noverruling a precedent.” Ante, at 11. That hardly distinguishes the\npresent case, since, as discussed later in text, the conclusion that this\nlegislation escapes strict scrutiny does violence to a great swath of our\nFirst Amendment jurisprudence.\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

With a dart here and a\npleat there, such regulations are sure to satisfy the tailor­\ning standards applied in Part IV of the majority’s opinion.\n   The Court cites two cases for the proposition that “[i]t is\nnot unusual for the Court to proceed sequentially in apply­\ning a constitutional test, even when the preliminary steps\nturn out not to be dispositive.” Ante, at 10–11 (citing\nBartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U. S. 514, 526–527 (2001); Holder\nv. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U. S. 1, 25–28 (2010)).\nThose cases provide little cover. In both, there was no\ndisagreement among the Members of the Court about\nwhether the statutes in question discriminated on the\nbasis of content.3 There was thus little harm in answering\nthe constitutional question that was “logically antecedent.”\nAnte, at 10. In the present case, however, content neutral­\nity is far from clear (the Court is divided 5-to-4), and the\nparties vigorously dispute the point, see ibid. One would\nhave thought that the Court would avoid the issue by\nsimply assuming without deciding the logically antecedent\npoint. We have done that often before. See, e.g., Herrera\nv. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 417 (1993); Regents of Univ. of\nMich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 222–223 (1985); Board of\nCurators of Univ. of Mo. v. Horowitz, 435 U. S. 78, 91–92\n(1978).\n   The Court points out that its opinion goes on to suggest\n——————\n   3 See Bartnicki, 532 U. S., at 526 (“We agree with petitioners that\n\n§2511(1)(c), as well as its Pennsylvania analog, is in fact a content­\nneutral law of general applicability”); id., at 544 (Rehnquist, C. J.,\ndissenting) (“The Court correctly observes that these are ‘content­\nneutral law[s] of general applicability’ ” (brackets in original)); Humani-\ntarian Law Project, 561 U. S., at 27 (“[Section] 2339B regulates speech\non the basis of its content”); id., at 45 (BREYER, J., dissenting)\n(“[W]here, as here, a statute applies criminal penalties and at least\narguably does so on the basis of content-based distinctions, I should\nthink we would scrutinize the statute and justifications ‘strictly’ ”).\n4                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(in Part IV) possible alternatives that apply only at abor­\ntion clinics, which therefore “raises the question whether\nthose provisions are content neutral.” Ante, at 11. Of\ncourse, the Court has no obligation to provide advice on\nalternative speech restrictions, and appending otherwise\nunnecessary constitutional pronouncements to such advice\nproduces nothing but an impermissible advisory opinion.\n   By the way, there is dictum favorable to advocates of\nabortion rights even in Part IV. The Court invites Massa­\nchusetts, as a means of satisfying the tailoring require­\nment, to “consider an ordinance such as the one adopted in\nNew York City that . . . makes it a crime ‘to follow and\nharass another person within 15 feet of the premises of a\nreproductive health care facility.’ ” Ante, at 24 (quoting\nN. Y. C. Admin. Code §8–803(a)(3) (2014)). Is it harass­\nment, one wonders, for Eleanor McCullen to ask a woman,\nquietly and politely, two times, whether she will take\nliterature or whether she has any questions? Three times?\nFour times? It seems to me far from certain that First\nAmendment rights can be imperiled by threatening jail\ntime (only at “reproductive health care facilit[ies],” of\ncourse) for so vague an offense as “follow[ing] and har­\nass[ing].” It is wrong for the Court to give its approval to\nsuch legislation without benefit of briefing and argument.\nII. The Statute Is Content Based and Fails Strict Scrutiny\n   Having eagerly volunteered to take on the level-of­\nscrutiny question, the Court provides the wrong answer.\nPetitioners argue for two reasons that subsection (b) ar­\nticulates a content-based speech restriction—and that\nwe must therefore evaluate it through the lens of strict\nscrutiny.\n          A. Application to Abortion Clinics Only\n  First, petitioners maintain that the Act targets abortion­\nrelated—for practical purposes, abortion-opposing—speech\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbecause it applies outside abortion clinics only (rather\nthan outside other buildings as well).\n   Public streets and sidewalks are traditional forums for\nspeech on matters of public concern. Therefore, as the\nCourt acknowledges, they hold a “ ‘special position in\nterms of First Amendment protection.’ ” Ante, at 8 (quot­\ning United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 180 (1983)).\nMoreover, “the public spaces outside of [abortion­\nproviding] facilities . . . ha[ve] become, by necessity and by\nvirtue of this Court’s decisions, a forum of last resort for\nthose who oppose abortion.” Hill, 530 U. S., at 763\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). It blinks reality to say, as the\nmajority does, that a blanket prohibition on the use of\nstreets and sidewalks where speech on only one politically\ncontroversial topic is likely to occur—and where that\nspeech can most effectively be communicated—is not\ncontent based. Would the Court exempt from strict scru­\ntiny a law banning access to the streets and sidewalks\nsurrounding the site of the Republican National Conven­\ntion? Or those used annually to commemorate the 1965\nSelma-to-Montgomery civil rights marches? Or those\noutside the Internal Revenue Service? Surely not.\n   The majority says, correctly enough, that a facially\nneutral speech restriction escapes strict scrutiny, even\nwhen it “may disproportionately affect speech on certain\ntopics,” so long as it is “justified without reference to the\ncontent of the regulated speech.” Ante, at 12 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But the cases in which the\nCourt has previously found that standard satisfied—in\nparticular, Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41\n(1986), and Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781\n(1989), both of which the majority cites—are a far cry from\nwhat confronts us here.\n   Renton upheld a zoning ordinance prohibiting adult\nmotion-picture theaters within 1,000 feet of residential\nneighborhoods, churches, parks, and schools. The ordi­\n6                  McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnance was content neutral, the Court held, because its\npurpose was not to suppress pornographic speech qua\nspeech but, rather, to mitigate the “secondary effects” of\nadult theaters—including by “prevent[ing] crime, pro­\ntect[ing] the city’s retail trade, [and] maintain[ing] prop­\nerty values.” 475 U. S., at 47, 48. The Court reasoned that\nif the city “ ‘had been concerned with restricting the mes­\nsage purveyed by adult theaters, it would have tried to\nclose them or restrict their number rather than circum­\nscribe their choice as to location.’ ” Id., at 48 (quoting\nYoung v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 82,\nn. 4 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in part)). Ward, in turn,\ninvolved a New York City regulation requiring the use of\nthe city’s own sound equipment and technician for events\nat a bandshell in Central Park. The Court held the regu­\nlation content neutral because its “principal justification\n[was] the city’s desire to control noise levels,” a justifica­\ntion that “ ‘ha[d] nothing to do with [the] content’ ” of re­\nspondent’s rock concerts or of music more generally. 491\nU. S., at 792. The regulation “ha[d] no material impact on\nany performer’s ability to exercise complete artistic control\nover sound quality.” Id., at 802; see also id., at 792–793.\n   Compare these cases’ reasons for concluding that the\nregulations in question were “justified without reference to\nthe content of the regulated speech” with the feeble rea­\nsons for the majority’s adoption of that conclusion in the\npresent case. The majority points only to the statute’s\nstated purpose of increasing “ ‘public safety’ ” at abortion\nclinics, ante, at 12–13 (quoting 2007 Mass. Acts p. 660),\nand to the additional aims articulated by respondents\nbefore this Court—namely, protecting “ ‘patient access to\nhealthcare . . . and the unobstructed use of public side­\nwalks and roadways,’ ” ante, at 13 (quoting Brief for Re­\nspondents 27). Really? Does a statute become “justified\nwithout reference to the content of the regulated speech”\nsimply because the statute itself and those defending it in\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncourt say that it is? Every objective indication shows that\nthe provision’s primary purpose is to restrict speech that\nopposes abortion.\n  I begin, as suggested above, with the fact that the Act\nburdens only the public spaces outside abortion clinics.\nOne might have expected the majority to defend the stat­\nute’s peculiar targeting by arguing that those locations\nregularly face the safety and access problems that it says\nthe Act was designed to solve. But the majority does not\nmake that argument because it would be untrue. As the\nCourt belatedly discovers in Part IV of its opinion, al­\nthough the statute applies to all abortion clinics in Massa­\nchusetts, only one is known to have been beset by the\nproblems that the statute supposedly addresses. See ante,\nat 26, 28. The Court uses this striking fact (a smoking\ngun, so to speak) as a basis for concluding that the law is\ninsufficiently “tailored” to safety and access concerns (Part\nIV) rather than as a basis for concluding that it is not\ndirected to those concerns at all, but to the suppression of\nantiabortion speech. That is rather like invoking the eight\nmissed human targets of a shooter who has killed one\nvictim to prove, not that he is guilty of attempted mass\nmurder, but that he has bad aim.\n   Whether the statute “restrict[s] more speech than\nnecessary” in light of the problems that it allegedly ad­\ndresses, ante, at 14–15, is, to be sure, relevant to the\ntailoring component of the First Amendment analysis (the\nshooter doubtless did have bad aim), but it is also rele­\nvant—powerfully relevant—to whether the law is really\ndirected to safety and access concerns or rather to the\nsuppression of a particular type of speech. Showing that a\nlaw that suppresses speech on a specific subject is so far­\nreaching that it applies even when the asserted non­\nspeech-related problems are not present is persuasive\nevidence that the law is content based. In its zeal to treat\nabortion-related speech as a special category, the majority\n8                  McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndistorts not only the First Amendment but also the ordi­\nnary logic of probative inferences.\n   The structure of the Act also indicates that it rests on\ncontent-based concerns. The goals of “public safety, pa­\ntient access to healthcare, and the unobstructed use of\npublic sidewalks and roadways,” Brief for Respondents 27,\nare already achieved by an earlier-enacted subsection of\nthe statute, which provides criminal penalties for “[a]ny\nperson who knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders, im­\npedes or blocks another person’s entry to or exit from a\nreproductive health care facility.” §120E½(e). As the\nmajority recognizes, that provision is easy to enforce. See\nante, at 28–29. Thus, the speech-free zones carved out by\nsubsection (b) add nothing to safety and access; what they\nachieve, and what they were obviously designed to\nachieve, is the suppression of speech opposing abortion.\n   Further contradicting the Court’s fanciful defense of the\nAct is the fact that subsection (b) was enacted as a more\neasily enforceable substitute for a prior provision. That pro­\nvision did not exclude people entirely from the restricted\nareas around abortion clinics; rather, it forbade people\nin those areas to approach within six feet of another per­\nson without that person’s consent “for the purpose of pass­\ning a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engag­\ning in oral protest, education or counseling with such\nother person.” §120E½(b) (West 2000). As the majority\nacknowledges, that provision was “modeled on a . . . Colo­\nrado law that this Court had upheld in Hill.” Ante, at 2.\nAnd in that case, the Court recognized that the statute in\nquestion was directed at the suppression of unwelcome\nspeech, vindicating what Hill called “[t]he unwilling lis­\ntener’s interest in avoiding unwanted communication.”\n530 U. S., at 716. The Court held that interest to be con­\ntent neutral. Id., at 719–725.\n   The provision at issue here was indisputably meant to\nserve the same interest in protecting citizens’ supposed\n                       Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                         9\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nright to avoid speech that they would rather not hear. For\nthat reason, we granted a second question for review in\nthis case (though one would not know that from the\nCourt’s opinion, which fails to mention it): whether Hill\nshould be cut back or cast aside. See Pet. for Cert. i. (stat­\ning second question presented as “If Hill . . . permits en­\nforcement of this law, whether Hill should be limited or\noverruled”); 570 U. S. ___ (2013) (granting certiorari with­\nout reservation). The majority avoids that question by\ndeclaring the Act content neutral on other (entirely unper­\nsuasive) grounds. In concluding that the statute is con­\ntent based and therefore subject to strict scrutiny, I neces­\nsarily conclude that Hill should be overruled. Reasons for\ndoing so are set forth in the dissents in that case, see 530\nU. S., at 741–765 (SCALIA, J.); id., at 765–790 (KENNEDY,\nJ.), and in the abundance of scathing academic commen­\ntary describing how Hill stands in contradiction to our\nFirst Amendment jurisprudence.4 Protecting people from\nspeech they do not want to hear is not a function that the\nFirst Amendment allows the government to undertake in\nthe public streets and sidewalks.\n   One final thought regarding Hill: It can be argued, and\nit should be argued in the next case, that by stating that\n“the Act would not be content neutral if it were concerned\nwith undesirable effects that arise from . . . ‘[l]isteners’\nreactions to speech,’ ” ante, at 13 (quoting Boos v. Barry,\n485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988) (brackets in original)), and then\nholding the Act unconstitutional for being insufficiently\ntailored to safety and access concerns, the Court itself has\n——————\n   4 “Hill . . . is inexplicable on standard free-speech grounds[,] and . . . it\n\nis shameful the Supreme Court would have upheld this piece of legisla­\ntion on the reasoning that it gave.” Constitutional Law Symposium,\nProfessor Michael W. McConnell’s Response, 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 747\n(2001). “I don’t think [Hill] was a difficult case. I think it was slam­\ndunk simple and slam-dunk wrong.” Id., at 750 (remarks of Laurence\nTribe). The list could go on.\n10                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsub silentio (and perhaps inadvertently) overruled Hill.\nThe unavoidable implication of that holding is that protec­\ntion against unwelcome speech cannot justify restrictions\non the use of public streets and sidewalks.\n   B. Exemption for Abortion-Clinic Employees or Agents\n   Petitioners contend that the Act targets speech opposing\nabortion (and thus constitutes a presumptively invalid\nviewpoint-discriminatory restriction) for another reason\nas well: It exempts “employees or agents” of an abortion\nclinic “acting within the scope of their employment,”\n§120E½(b)(2).\n   It goes without saying that “[g]ranting waivers to fa­\nvored speakers (or . . . denying them to disfavored speak­\ners) would of course be unconstitutional.” Thomas v.\nChicago Park Dist., 534 U. S. 316, 325 (2002). The major­\nity opinion sets forth a two-part inquiry for assessing\nwhether a regulation is content based, but when it comes\nto assessing the exemption for abortion-clinic employees or\nagents, the Court forgets its own teaching. Its opinion\njumps right over the prong that asks whether the provi­\nsion “draw[s] . . . distinctions on its face,” ante, at 12, and\ninstead proceeds directly to the purpose-related prong, see\nibid., asking whether the exemption “represent[s] a gov­\nernmental attempt to give one side of a debatable public\nquestion an advantage in expressing its views to the peo­\nple,” ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted). I\ndisagree with the majority’s negative answer to that ques­\ntion, but that is beside the point if the text of the statute—\nwhatever its purposes might have been—“license[s] one\nside of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other\nto follow Marquis of Queensberry rules.” R. A. V. v. St.\nPaul, 505 U. S. 377, 392 (1992).\n   Is there any serious doubt that abortion-clinic employees\nor agents “acting within the scope of their employment”\nnear clinic entrances may—indeed, often will—speak in\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfavor of abortion (“You are doing the right thing”)? Or\nspeak in opposition to the message of abortion oppo­\nnents—saying, for example, that “this is a safe facility” to\nrebut the statement that it is not? See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n37–38. The Court’s contrary assumption is simply incred­\nible. And the majority makes no attempt to establish the\nfurther necessary proposition that abortion-clinic employ­\nees and agents do not engage in nonspeech activities\ndirected to the suppression of antiabortion speech by\nhampering the efforts of counselors to speak to prospective\nclients. Are we to believe that a clinic employee sent out\nto “escort” prospective clients into the building would not\nseek to prevent a counselor like Eleanor McCullen from\ncommunicating with them? He could pull a woman away\nfrom an approaching counselor, cover her ears, or make\nloud noises to drown out the counselor’s pleas.\n   The Court points out that the exemption may allow into\nthe speech-free zones clinic employees other than escorts,\nsuch as “the maintenance worker shoveling a snowy side­\nwalk or the security guard patrolling a clinic entrance.”\nAnte, at 16. I doubt that Massachusetts legislators had\nthose people in mind, but whether they did is in any event\nirrelevant. Whatever other activity is permitted, so long\nas the statute permits speech favorable to abortion rights\nwhile excluding antiabortion speech, it discriminates on\nthe basis of viewpoint.\n   The Court takes the peculiar view that, so long as the\nclinics have not specifically authorized their employees to\nspeak in favor of abortion (or, presumably, to impede\nantiabortion speech), there is no viewpoint discrimination.\nSee ibid. But it is axiomatic that “where words are em­\nployed in a statute which had at the time a well-known\nmeaning at common law or in the law of this country[,]\nthey are presumed to have been used in that sense unless\nthe context compels to the contrary.” Standard Oil Co. of\nN. J. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, 59 (1911). The phrase\n12                McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n“scope of employment” is a well-known common-law con­\ncept that includes “[t]he range of reasonable and foresee­\nable activities that an employee engages in while carrying\nout the employer’s business.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1465\n(9th ed. 2009). The employer need not specifically direct\nor sanction each aspect of an employee’s conduct for it to\nqualify. See Restatement (Second) of Agency §229 (1957);\nsee also Restatement (Third) of Agency §7.07(2), and\nComment b (2005). Indeed, employee conduct can qualify\neven if the employer specifically forbids it. See Restate­\nment (Second) §230. In any case, it is implausible that\nclinics would bar escorts from engaging in the sort of\nactivity mentioned above. Moreover, a statute that forbids\none side but not the other to convey its message does not\nbecome viewpoint neutral simply because the favored side\nchooses voluntarily to abstain from activity that the stat­\nute permits.\n   There is not a shadow of a doubt that the assigned or\nforeseeable conduct of a clinic employee or agent can\ninclude both speaking in favor of abortion rights and\ncountering the speech of people like petitioners. See post,\nat 1–2 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). Indeed, as the\nmajority acknowledges, the trial record includes testimony\nthat escorts at the Boston clinic “expressed views about\nabortion to the women they were accompanying, thwarted\npetitioners’ attempts to speak and hand literature to the\nwomen, and disparaged petitioners in various ways,”\nincluding by calling them “ ‘crazy.’ ”     Ante, at 7, 16\n(citing App. 165, 168–169, 177–178, 189–190). What a\nsurprise! The Web site for the Planned Parenthood\nLeague of Massachusetts (which operates the three\nabortion facilities where petitioners attempt to counsel\nwomen), urges readers to “Become a Clinic Escort Vol­\nunteer” in order to “provide a safe space for patients\nby escorting them through protestors to the health center.”\nVolunteer and Internship Opportunities, online at https://\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

The “safe space” provided\nby escorts is protection from that speech.\n   Going from bad to worse, the majority’s opinion con­\ntends that “the record before us contains insufficient\nevidence to show” that abortion-facility escorts have actu­\nally spoken in favor of abortion (or, presumably, hindered\nantiabortion speech) while acting within the scope of their\nemployment. Ante, at 18. Here is a brave new First\nAmendment test: Speech restrictions favoring one view­\npoint over another are not content based unless it can be\nshown that the favored viewpoint has actually been ex­\npressed. A city ordinance closing a park adjoining the\nRepublican National Convention to all speakers except\nthose whose remarks have been approved by the Repub­\nlican National Committee is thus not subject to strict\nscrutiny unless it can be shown that someone has given\ncommittee-endorsed remarks. For this Court to suggest\nsuch a test is astonishing.5\n——————\n   5 The Court states that I can make this assertion “only by quoting a\n\nsentence that is explicitly limited to as-applied challenges and treating\nit as relevant to facial challenges.” Ante, at 18, n. 4. That is not so.\nThe sentence in question appears in a paragraph immediately following\nrejection of the facial challenge, which begins: “It would be a very\ndifferent question if it turned out that a clinic authorized escorts to\nspeak about abortion inside the buffer zones.” Ante, at 17. And the\nprior discussion regarding the facial challenge points to the fact that\n“[t]here is no suggestion in the record that any of the clinics authorize\ntheir employees to speak about abortion in the buffer zones.” Ante, at\n16. To be sure, the paragraph in question then goes on to concede only\nthat the statute’s constitutionality as applied would depend upon\n14                   McCULLEN v.

Conclusion\n  In sum, the Act should be reviewed under the strict­\nscrutiny standard applicable to content-based legislation.\nThat standard requires that a regulation represent “the\nleast restrictive means” of furthering “a compelling Gov­\nernment interest.” United States v. Playboy Entertain-\nment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Respondents do not even at­\ntempt to argue that subsection (b) survives this test. See\nante, at 10. “Suffice it to say that if protecting people from\nunwelcome communications”—the actual purpose of the\nprovision—“is a compelling state interest, the First\nAmendment is a dead letter.” Hill, 530 U. S., at 748–749\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n                   III. Narrow Tailoring\n  Having determined that the Act is content based and\ndoes not withstand strict scrutiny, I need not pursue the\ninquiry conducted in Part IV of the Court’s opinion—\nwhether the statute is “ ‘narrowly tailored to serve a signif­\nicant governmental interest,’ ” ante, at 18 (quoting Ward,\n491 U. S., at 796 (internal quotation marks omitted)). I\nsuppose I could do so, taking as a given the Court’s erro­\nneous content-neutrality conclusion in Part III; and if I\ndid, I suspect I would agree with the majority that the\nlegislation is not narrowly tailored to advance the inter­\nests asserted by respondents. But I prefer not to take part\nin the assembling of an apparent but specious unanimity.\nI leave both the plainly unnecessary and erroneous half\n——————\nexplicit clinic authorization. Even that seems to me wrong. Saying\nthat voluntary action by a third party can cause an otherwise valid\nstatute to violate the First Amendment as applied seems to me little\nbetter than saying it can cause such a statute to violate the First\nAmendment facially. A statute that punishes me for speaking unless x\nchooses to speak is unconstitutional facially and as applied, without\nreference to x’s action.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

The provision is thus unconstitutional root\nand branch and cannot be saved, as the majority suggests,\nby limiting its application to the single facility that has\nexperienced the safety and access problems to which it is\nquite obviously not addressed. I concur only in the judg­\nment that the statute is unconstitutional under the First\nAmendment.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(b) (West 2012),\nviolates the First Amendment. As the Court recognizes, if\nthe Massachusetts law discriminates on the basis of view­\npoint, it is unconstitutional, see ante, at 10, and I believe\nthe law clearly discriminates on this ground.\n   The Massachusetts statute generally prohibits any\nperson from entering a buffer zone around an abortion\nclinic during the clinic’s business hours, §120E½(c), but\nthe law contains an exemption for “employees or agents of\nsuch facility acting within the scope of their employment.”\n§120E½(b)(2). Thus, during business hours, individuals\nwho wish to counsel against abortion or to criticize the\nparticular clinic may not do so within the buffer zone. If\nthey engage in such conduct, they commit a crime. See\n§120E½(d). By contrast, employees and agents of the\nclinic may enter the zone and engage in any conduct that\nfalls within the scope of their employment. A clinic may\ndirect or authorize an employee or agent, while within the\nzone, to express favorable views about abortion or the\nclinic, and if the employee exercises that authority, the\nemployee’s conduct is perfectly lawful. In short, petition­\ners and other critics of a clinic are silenced, while the\n2                 McCULLEN v. COAKLEY\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nclinic may authorize its employees to express speech in\nsupport of the clinic and its work.\n   Consider this entirely realistic situation. A woman\nenters a buffer zone and heads haltingly toward the en­\ntrance. A sidewalk counselor, such as petitioners, enters\nthe buffer zone, approaches the woman and says, “If you\nhave doubts about an abortion, let me try to answer any\nquestions you may have. The clinic will not give you good\ninformation.” At the same time, a clinic employee, as\ninstructed by the management, approaches the same\nwoman and says, “Come inside and we will give you hon­\nest answers to all your questions.” The sidewalk counselor\nand the clinic employee expressed opposing viewpoints,\nbut only the first violated the statute.\n   Or suppose that the issue is not abortion but the safety\nof a particular facility. Suppose that there was a recent\nreport of a botched abortion at the clinic. A nonemployee\nmay not enter the buffer zone to warn about the clinic’s\nhealth record, but an employee may enter and tell pro­\nspective clients that the clinic is safe.\n   It is clear on the face of the Massachusetts law that it\ndiscriminates based on viewpoint. Speech in favor of the\nclinic and its work by employees and agents is permitted;\nspeech criticizing the clinic and its work is a crime. This\nis blatant viewpoint discrimination.\n   The Court holds not only that the Massachusetts law is\nviewpoint neutral but also that it does not discriminate\nbased on content. See ante, at 11–15. The Court treats\nthe Massachusetts law like one that bans all speech\nwithin the buffer zone. While such a law would be content\nneutral on its face, there are circumstances in which a law\nforbidding all speech at a particular location would not be\ncontent neutral in fact. Suppose, for example, that a\nfacially content-neutral law is enacted for the purpose of\nsuppressing speech on a particular topic. Such a law\nwould not be content neutral. See, e.g., Turner Broadcast-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ning System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 645–646 (1994).\n  In this case, I do not think that it is possible to reach a\njudgment about the intent of the Massachusetts Legisla­\nture without taking into account the fact that the law that\nthe legislature enacted blatantly discriminates based on\nviewpoint. In light of this feature, as well as the over­\nbreadth that the Court identifies, see ante, at 23–27, it\ncannot be said, based on the present record, that the law\nwould be content neutral even if the exemption for clinic\nemployees and agents were excised. However, if the law\nwere truly content neutral, I would agree with the Court\nthat the law would still be unconstitutional on the ground\nthat it burdens more speech than is necessary to serve the\nCommonwealth’s asserted interests.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2680591/", "sha1": "04235e0eed0c6aeb9b2a5efe88c2f78a31f04dc7", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-068", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-26T08:01:40.479022"}
