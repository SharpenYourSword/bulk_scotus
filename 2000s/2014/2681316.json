S. ____ (2014)            1\n\n                     Statement of ALITO, J.\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n   MOUNT SOLEDAD MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION v.\n\n            STEVE TRUNK, ET AL. \n\nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI BEFORE JUDGMENT \n\nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH \n\n                        CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 13\u20131061. Decided June 30, 2014\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment is\ndenied.\n  Statement of JUSTICE ALITO respecting the denial of the\npetition for a writ of certiorari before judgment.\n  This case came before us two years ago, see 567 U. S.\n___ (2012), and at that time I issued a statement respect-\ning the denial of certiorari. I noted that although the\n\u201cCourt\u2019s Establishment Clause jurisprudence is undoubt-\nedly in need of clarity,\u201d certiorari was not yet warranted in\nthis case \u201c[b]ecause no final judgment has been rendered\nand it remains unclear precisely what action the Federal\nGovernment will be required to take.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 2, 3).\n  Since that time, the District Court has issued an order\nrequiring the memorial to be removed, but it has stayed\nthat order pending appeal. The Court of Appeals has not\nyet reviewed that order on appeal. Seeking to bypass that\nstep, petitioner seeks certiorari before judgment. In my\nview, it has not met the very demanding standard we\nrequire in order to grant certiorari at that stage. In light\nof the stay, any review by this Court can await the deci-\nsion of the Court of Appeals. I therefore agree with the\nCourt\u2019s decision to deny the petition.\n",
