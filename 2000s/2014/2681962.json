SYLVIA BURWELL,\n\n      SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN\n\n              SERVICES, ET AL. \n\n            ON APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION\n                         [July 3, 2014]\n\n  The application for an injunction having been submitted\nto JUSTICE KAGAN and by her referred to the Court, the\nCourt orders: If the applicant informs the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services in writing that it is a non-\nprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and\nhas religious objections to providing coverage for contra-\nceptive services, the respondents are enjoined from enforc-\ning against the applicant the challenged provisions of the\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related\nregulations pending final disposition of appellate review.\nTo meet the condition for injunction pending appeal, the\napplicant need not use the form prescribed by the Gov-\nernment, EBSA Form 700, and need not send copies to\nhealth insurance issuers or third-party administrators.\n  The Circuit Courts have divided on whether to enjoin\nthe requirement that religious nonprofit organizations use\nEBSA Form 700. Such division is a traditional ground for\ncertiorari. See S. Ct. Rule 10(a).\n  Nothing in this interim order affects the ability of the\napplicant\u2019s employees and students to obtain, without cost,\nthe full range of FDA approved contraceptives. The Gov-\nernment contends that the applicant\u2019s health insurance\nissuer and third-party administrator are required by\nfederal law to provide full contraceptive coverage regard-\nless whether the applicant completes EBSA Form 700.\n2             WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nThe applicant contends, by contrast, that the obligations of\nits health insurance issuer and third-party administrator\nare dependent on their receipt of notice that the applicant\nobjects to the contraceptive coverage requirement. But\nthe applicant has already notified the Government\u2014\nwithout using EBSA Form 700\u2014that it meets the re-\nquirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage\nrequirement on religious grounds. Nothing in this order\nprecludes the Government from relying on this notice, to\nthe extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provi-\nsion of full contraceptive coverage under the Act.\n   In light of the foregoing, this order should not be con-\nstrued as an expression of the Court\u2019s views on the merits.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA concurs in the result.\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG\nand JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.\n   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 124\nStat. 119, through its implementing regulations, requires\nemployer group health insurance plans to cover contracep-\ntive services without cost sharing. Recognizing that peo-\nple of religious faith may sincerely oppose the provision of\ncontraceptives, the Government has created certain excep-\ntions to this requirement. Churches are categorically\nexempt. Any religious nonprofit is also exempt, as long as\nit signs a form certifying that it is a religious nonprofit\nthat objects to the provision of contraceptive services, and\nprovides a copy of that form to its insurance issuer or\nthird-party administrator. The form is simple. The front\nasks the applicant to attest to the foregoing representa-\ntions; the back notifies third-party administrators of their\nregulatory obligations.\n   The matter before us is an application for an emergency\ninjunction filed by Wheaton College, a nonprofit liberal\narts college in Illinois. There is no dispute that Wheaton\nis entitled to the religious-nonprofit exemption from the\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncontraceptive coverage requirement. Wheaton nonethe-\nless asserts that the exemption itself impermissibly bur-\ndens Wheaton\u2019s free exercise of its religion in violation of\nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA),\n107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000bb et seq., on the theory\nthat its filing of a self-certification form will make it com-\nplicit in the provision of contraceptives by triggering the\nobligation for someone else to provide the services to\nwhich it objects. Wheaton has not stated a viable claim\nunder RFRA. Its claim ignores that the provision of con-\ntraceptive coverage is triggered not by its completion of\nthe self-certification form, but by federal law.\n  Even assuming that the accommodation somehow bur-\ndens Wheaton\u2019s religious exercise, the accommodation is\npermissible under RFRA because it is the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering the Government\u2019s compelling inter-\nests in public health and women\u2019s well-being. Indeed, just\nearlier this week in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.,\nante, at ___, the Court described the accommodation as \u201ca\nsystem that seeks to respect the religious liberty of reli-\ngious nonprofit corporations while ensuring that the em-\nployees of these entities have precisely the same access to\nall [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]-approved con-\ntraceptives as employees of companies whose owners have\nno religious objections to providing such coverage.\u201d Ante,\nat 3. And the Court concluded that the accommodation\n\u201cconstitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Gov-\nernment\u2019s aims while providing greater respect for reli-\ngious liberty.\u201d Ibid. Those who are bound by our decisions\nusually believe they can take us at our word. Not so to-\nday. After expressly relying on the availability of the\nreligious-nonprofit accommodation to hold that the contra-\nceptive coverage requirement violates RFRA as applied to\nclosely held for-profit corporations, the Court now, as the\ndissent in Hobby Lobby feared it might, see ante, at 29\u201330\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting), retreats from that position.\n4             WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nThat action evinces disregard for even the newest of this\nCourt\u2019s precedents and undermines confidence in this\ninstitution.\n   Even if one accepts Wheaton\u2019s view that the self-\ncertification procedure violates RFRA, that would not\njustify the Court\u2019s action today.       The Court grants\nWheaton a form of relief as rare as it is extreme: an inter-\nlocutory injunction under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71651, blocking the operation of a duly enacted law and\nregulations, in a case in which the courts below have not\nyet adjudicated the merits of the applicant\u2019s claims and in\nwhich those courts have declined requests for similar\ninjunctive relief. Injunctions of this nature are proper\nonly where \u201cthe legal rights at issue are indisputably\nclear.\u201d Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 507\nU. S. 1301, 1303 (1993) (Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Yet the Court today\norders this extraordinary relief even though no one could\ncredibly claim Wheaton\u2019s right to relief is indisputably\nclear.\n   The sincerity of Wheaton\u2019s deeply held religious beliefs\nis beyond refute. But as a legal matter, Wheaton\u2019s appli-\ncation comes nowhere near the high bar necessary to\nwarrant an emergency injunction from this Court. For\nthat reason, I respectfully dissent.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Affordable Care Act requires certain employer\ngroup health insurance plans to cover a number of preven-\ntative-health services without cost sharing. These services\ninclude \u201c[a]ll Food and Drug Administration . . . approved\ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and pa-\ntient education and counseling for all women with repro-\nductive capacity, as prescribed by a provider.\u201d 77 Fed.\nReg. 8725 (2012) (brackets and internal quotation marks\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   5\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nomitted). As a practical matter, the provision ensures that\nwomen have access to contraception at no cost beyond\ntheir insurance premiums. Employers that do not comply\nwith the mandate are subject to civil penalties.\n   Recognizing that some religions disapprove of contra-\nceptives, the Government has sought to implement the\nmandate in a manner consistent with the freedom of\nconscience. It has categorically exempted any group\nhealth plan of a \u201creligious employer,\u201d as defined by refer-\nence to the Tax Code provision governing churches. See\n45 CFR \u00a7147.131(a); http://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (as\nvisited July 2, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile). And it has extended a further accommodation to\nreligious nonprofits that do not satisfy the categorical\nexemption. All agree that Wheaton qualifies as a religious\nnonprofit.\n   To invoke the accommodation and avoid civil penalties,\na religious nonprofit need only file a self-certification form\nstating (1) that it \u201copposes providing coverage for some or\nall of any contraceptive services required to be covered\nunder [the regulation] on account of religious objections,\u201d\n(2) that it \u201cis organized and operates as a nonprofit en-\ntity,\u201d and (3) that it \u201cholds itself out as a religious organiza-\ntion.\u201d \u00a7147.131(b). The form is reprinted in an appendix\nto this opinion. Any organization that completes the form\nand provides a copy to its insurance issuer or third-party\nadministrator1 need not \u201ccontract, arrange, pay, or refer\nfor contraceptive coverage\u201d to which it objects. 78 Fed.\nReg. 39874 (2013); see 29 CFR \u00a72590.715\u20132713A(b)(1) and\n(c)(1). Instead, the insurance issuer or third-party admin-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Typically, an employer contracts to pay a health insurer to provide\n\ncoverage; the insurer both covers the cost of medical claims and man-\nages the process for administering those claims. Employers who\nmaintain self-insured plans cover the cost of claims for medical treat-\nment directly. Such employers often contract with third-party adminis-\ntrators to administer the claims process.\n6               WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nistrator must provide contraceptive coverage for the organ-\nization\u2019s employees and may not charge the organization\nany premium or other fee related to those services. The\nback of the self-certification form reminds third-party\nadministrators that receipt of the form constitutes notice\nthat they must comply with their regulatory obligations.\nSee Appendix, infra.\n                              B\n   Rather than availing itself of this simple accommoda-\ntion, Wheaton filed suit, asserting that completing the\nform and submitting it to its third-party administrator\nwould make it complicit in the provision of contraceptive\ncoverage, in violation of its religious beliefs. On that\nbasis, it sought a preliminary injunction, claiming that the\nlaw and regulations at issue violate RFRA, which provides\nthat the Government may not \u201csubstantially burden a\nperson\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d unless the application of that\nburden \u201cis the least restrictive means of furthering [a]\ncompelling governmental interest.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72000bb\u2013\n1(a) and (b).2\n   The District Court denied a preliminary injunction on\nthe ground that the regulations exempting Wheaton from\nthe contraceptive coverage requirement do not substan-\ntially burden its exercise of religion. App. to Emergency\nApplication for Injunction Pending Appellate Review 1\u201320.\nUnder Circuit precedent, the court reasoned, Wheaton\u2019s\nact of \u201cfilling out the form and sending it to the [third-\nparty administrator]\u201d in no way \u201ctriggers\u201d coverage of\ncontraception costs. Id., at 9 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Seventh Circuit in turn denied Wheaton\u2019s\nmotion for an injunction pending appeal. See Order in No.\n14\u20132396 (CA7, June 30, 2014). In doing so, it relied on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Wheaton also raised claims under the First Amendment and the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act. Because it does not press those claims\nin this Court as a basis for injunctive relief, I do not discuss them.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

She referred the\nmatter to the Conference, which entered a temporary\ninjunction and called for a response from the Government.\nSee ante, at ___. After receipt of the Government\u2019s re-\nsponse, the Court today enters an order granting injunc-\ntive relief.\n                               II\n\n                                A\n\n   I disagree strongly with what the Court has done.\nWheaton asks us to enjoin the enforcement of a duly en-\nacted law and duly promulgated regulations before the\ncourts below have passed on the merits of its legal chal-\nlenge. Relief of this nature is extraordinary and reserved\nfor the rarest of cases. With good reason. The only source\nof authority for this Court to issue an injunction pending\nreview in the lower courts is the All Writs Act, which\nprovides that this Court \u201cmay issue all writs necessary or\nappropriate in aid of [its] . . . jurisdictio[n] and agreeable\nto the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71651(a).\nThis grant of equitable power is a failsafe, \u201cto be used\n\u2018sparingly and only in the most critical and exigent cir-\ncumstances.\u2019 \u201d      Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy,\nInc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (SCALIA, J., in\nchambers).\n   Under our precedents, \u201c[a]n injunction is appropriate\nonly if (1) it is necessary or appropriate in aid of our juris-\ndiction, and (2) the legal rights at issue are indisputably\n8                WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nclear.\u201d Turner Broadcasting System, 507 U. S., at 1303\n(brackets, internal quotation marks, and citations omit-\nted).3 To understand how high a bar that second prong is,\nconsider that this Court has previously pointed to differ-\nences of opinion among lower courts as proof positive that\nthe standard has not been met. See Lux v. Rodrigues, 561\nU. S. 1306, 1308 (2010) (ROBERTS, C. J., in chambers)\n(observing that \u201cthe courts of appeals appear to be reach-\ning divergent results\u201d respecting the applicant\u2019s claim, and\nthat, \u201c[a]ccordingly, . . . it cannot be said that his right to\nrelief is \u2018indisputably clear\u2019 \u201d). Neutral application of this\nprinciple would compel the denial of Wheaton\u2019s application\nwithout any need to examine the merits, for two Courts of\nAppeals that have addressed similar claims have rejected\nthem. See Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F. 3d 547 (CA7\n2014); Michigan Catholic Conference and Catholic Family\nServices v. Burwell, ___ F. 3d ___, 2014 WL 2596753 (CA6,\nJune 11, 2014).4 Remarkably, the Court uses division\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Indeed,some of my colleagues who act to grant relief in this case\nhave themselves emphasized the exceedingly high burden that an\napplicant must surmount to obtain an interlocutory injunction under\nthe All Writs Act. See Lux v. Rodrigues, 561 U. S. 1306, 1307 (2010)\n(ROBERTS, C. J., in chambers) (an applicant must demonstrate that \u201cthe\nlegal rights at issue are indisputably clear\u201d in order to obtain such\ninjunctive relief) (internal quotation marks omitted); Respect Maine\nPAC v. McKee, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (unlike a stay of a lower court\u2019s\norder, a request for an injunction against the enforcement of a law\n\u201c \u2018does not simply suspend judicial alteration of the status quo but\ngrants judicial intervention that has been withheld by lower courts\u2019 \u201d)\n(quoting Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S.\n1312, 1313 (1986) (SCALIA, J., in chambers)).\n   4 To be sure, two other Courts of Appeals have recently granted tem-\n\nporary injunctions similar to the one Wheaton seeks here. See Order in\nEternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Secretary, U. S.

But a petition for writ of certio-\nrari is not before us. Rather, given the posture of this appli-\ncation\u2014for an emergency injunction under the All Writs\nAct\u2014division of authority is reason not to grant relief.\n                               B\n   Wheaton\u2019s RFRA claim plainly does not satisfy our\ndemanding standard for the extraordinary relief it seeks.\n   For one thing, the merits of this case are not before this\nCourt for full review; adjudication of the merits is still\npending in the District Court. So nothing necessitates\nintervention in order to \u201c \u2018aid . . . our jurisdiction,\u2019 \u201d Turner\nBroadcasting System, 507 U. S., at 1301 (alterations omit-\nted), over any eventual certiorari petition from a decision\nrendered below. If the Government is allowed to enforce\nthe law, either Wheaton will file the self-certification form,\nor it will not. Either way, there will remain a live contro-\nversy that this Court could adjudicate after the case is\ndecided on the merits below. And either way, if Wheaton\nis correct in its challenge to the law, its rights will be\nvindicated and it will obtain the relief it seeks.\n   As to the merits, Wheaton\u2019s claim is likely to fail under\nany standard, let alone the standard that its entitlement\nto relief be \u201c \u2018indisputably clear,\u2019 \u201d ibid. Wheaton asserts\nthat filing the self-certification form might ultimately\nresult in the provision of contraceptive services to its\nemployees, thereby burdening its religious exercise. And\nit points out that if it does not file the form, it will face\ncivil penalties. But it is difficult to understand how these\narguments make out a viable RFRA claim.\n   RFRA requires Wheaton to show that the accommoda-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nto deny this one. Moreover, while uniformity certainly is important,\n\nuniform error is not. \n\n10            WHEATON COLLEGE v.

S., at ___ (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 20).\nWheaton, for religious reasons, categorically opposes the\nprovision of contraceptive services. The Government has\ngiven it a simple means to opt out of the contraceptive\ncoverage mandate\u2014and thus avoid any civil penalties for\nfailing to provide contraceptive services\u2014and a simple\nmeans to tell its third-party administrator of its claimed\nexemption.\n   Yet Wheaton maintains that taking these steps to avail\nitself of the accommodation would substantially burden its\nreligious exercise. Wheaton is \u201creligiously opposed to\nemergency contraceptives because they may act by killing\na human embryo.\u201d Emergency Application for Injunction\nPending Appellate Review 11. And it \u201cbelieves that au-\nthorizing its [third-party administrator] to provide these\ndrugs in [its] place makes it complicit in grave moral evil.\u201d\nIbid. Wheaton is mistaken\u2014not as a matter of religious\nfaith, in which it is undoubtedly sincere, but as a matter of\nlaw: Not every sincerely felt \u201cburden\u201d is a \u201csubstantial\u201d\none, and it is for courts, not litigants, to identify which\nare. See Hobby Lobby, 573 U. S., at ___ (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 21\u201322). Any provision of contra-\nceptive coverage by Wheaton\u2019s third-party administrator\nwould not result from any action by Wheaton; rather, in\nevery meaningful sense, it would result from the relevant\nlaw and regulations. The law and regulations require, in\nessence, that some entity provide contraceptive coverage.\nA religious nonprofit\u2019s choice not to be that entity may\nleave someone else obligated to provide coverage instead\u2014\nbut the obligation is created by the contraceptive coverage\nmandate imposed by law, not by the religious nonprofit\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                  11\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nchoice to opt out of it.5\n   Let me be absolutely clear: I do not doubt that Wheaton\ngenuinely believes that signing the self-certification form\nis contrary to its religious beliefs. But thinking one\u2019s\nreligious beliefs are substantially burdened\u2014no matter\nhow sincere or genuine that belief may be\u2014does not make\nit so.\n   An analogy used by the Seventh Circuit may help to\nexplain why Wheaton\u2019s complicity theory cannot be legally\nsound:\n     \u201cSuppose it is wartime, there is a draft, and a Quaker\n     is called up. Many Quakers are pacifists, and their\n     pacifism is a tenet of their religion. Suppose the\n     Quaker who\u2019s been called up tells the selective service\n     system that he\u2019s a conscientious objector. The selec-\n     tive service officer to whom he makes this pitch ac-\n     cepts the sincerity of his refusal to bear arms and ex-\n     cuses him.

Because\n     his religion teaches that no one should bear arms,\n     drafting another person in his place would make him\n     responsible for the military activities of his replace-\n     ment, and by doing so would substantially burden his\n     own sincere religious beliefs.

That notice is merely an instruction to third-\nparty administrators; it is not a part of any of the representations\nrequired on the front of the form. No statement to which Wheaton\nmust assent in any way reflects agreement with or endorsement of the\nnotice.\n12            WHEATON COLLEGE v.

If a religious nonprofit chooses not to pay\nfor contraceptive services, it is true that someone else may\nhave a legal obligation to pay for them, just as someone\nmay have to go to war in place of the conscientious objec-\ntor. But the obligation to provide contraceptive services,\nlike the obligation to serve in the Armed Forces, arises not\nfrom the filing of the form but from the underlying law\nand regulations.\n   It may be that what troubles Wheaton is that it must\nparticipate in any process the end result of which might be\nthe provision of contraceptives to its employees. But that\nis far from a substantial burden on its free exercise of\nreligion.\n   Even if one were to conclude that Wheaton meets the\nsubstantial burden requirement, the Government has\nshown that application of the burden is \u201cthe least restric-\ntive means\u201d to further a \u201ccompelling governmental inter-\nest,\u201d \u00a72000bb\u20131(b)(2).

Today\u2019s grant of injunctive relief sim-\nply does not square with the Court\u2019s reasoning in Hobby\nLobby.\n   It should by now be clear just how far the Court has\nstrayed in granting Wheaton an interlocutory injunction\nagainst the enforcement of the law and regulations before\nthe courts below have adjudicated Wheaton\u2019s RFRA claim.\nTo warrant an injunction under the All Writs Act, the\nCourt must have more than a bare desire to suspend the\nexisting state of affairs; Wheaton\u2019s entitlement to relief\nmust be indisputably clear. While Wheaton\u2019s religious\nconviction is undoubtedly entitled to respect, it does not\ncome close to affording a basis for relief under the law.\n                          C\n  The Court\u2019s approach imposes an unwarranted and\nunprecedented burden on the Government\u2019s ability to\nadminister an important regulatory scheme. The Execu-\n14            WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntive is tasked with enforcing Congress\u2019 mandate that\npreventative care be available to citizens at no cost beyond\nthat of insurance. In providing the accommodation for\nwhich Wheaton is eligible, the Government has done a\nsalutary thing: exempt religious organizations from a\nrequirement that might otherwise burden them. Wheaton\nobjects, however, to the minimally burdensome paperwork\nnecessary for the Government to administer this ac-\ncommodation. If the Government cannot require or-\nganizations to attest to their views by way of a simple\nself-certification form and notify their third-party admin-\nistrators of their claimed exemption, how can it ever iden-\ntify the organizations eligible for the accommodation and\nperform the administrative tasks necessary to make the\naccommodation work? The self-certification form is the\nleast intrusive way for the Government to administer the\naccommodation. All that a religious organization must do\nis attest to the views that it holds and notify its third-\nparty administrator that it is exempt. The Government\nrightly accepts that attestation at face value; it does not\nquestion whether an organization\u2019s views are sincere. It is\nnot at all clear to me how the Government could adminis-\nter the religious nonprofit accommodation if Wheaton\nwere to prevail.\n   The Court has different ideas, however. Stepping into\nthe shoes of HHS, the Court sets out to craft a new admin-\nistrative regime. Its order grants injunctive relief so long\nas Wheaton \u201cinforms the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices in writing that it is a non-profit organization that\nholds itself out as religious and has religious objections to\nproviding coverage for contraceptive services.\u201d Supra, at\n1. And it goes further\u2014\u201c[t]o meet the condition for injunc-\ntion pending appeal,\u201d the Court continues, Wheaton \u201cneed\nnot use the [self-certification] form prescribed by the\nGovernment . . . and need not send copies to health insur-\nance issuers or third-party administrators.\u201d Ibid.

Yet, without pause, the Court essentially does just\nthat.6\n   It is unclear why the Court goes to the lengths it does to\nrewrite HHS\u2019s regulations. Presumably the Court intends\nto leave to the agency the task of forwarding whatever\nnotification it receives to the respective insurer or third-\nparty administrator. But the Court does not even require\nthe religious nonprofit to identify its third-party adminis-\ntrator, and it neglects to explain how HHS is to identify\nthat entity. Of course, HHS is aware of Wheaton\u2019s third-\nparty administrator in this case. But what about other\ncases? Does the Court intend for HHS to rely on the filing\nof lawsuits by every entity claiming an exemption, such\nthat the identity of the third-party administrator will\nemerge in the pleadings or in discovery? Is HHS to under-\ntake the daunting\u2014if not impossible\u2014task of creating a\ndatabase that tracks every employer\u2019s insurer or third-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 This case is crucially unlike Little Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius, 571\n\nU. S. ___ (2014). There, the Court issued a comparable order \u201cbased on\nall the circumstances of the case\u201d\u2014in particular, the fact that the\napplicants\u2019 third-party administrator was a \u201cchurch plan\u201d that had no\nlegal obligation or intention to provide contraceptive coverage. See\nLittle Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius, 2013 WL 6839900, *10\u2013*11, *13 (D\nColo., Dec. 27, 2013). As a consequence, whatever the merits of that\nunusual order, it did not affect any individual\u2019s access to contraceptive\ncoverage. Not so here. Wheaton\u2019s third-party administrator bears the\nlegal obligation to provide contraceptive coverage only upon receipt of a\nvalid self-certification. See 26 CFR \u00a754.9815\u20132713A(b)(2) (2013); 29\nCFR \u00a72510.3\u201316(b) (2013). Today\u2019s injunction thus risks depriving\nhundreds of Wheaton\u2019s employees and students of their legal entitle-\nment to contraceptive coverage. In addition, because Wheaton is\nmaterially indistinguishable from other nonprofits that object to the\nGovernment\u2019s accommodation, the issuance of an injunction in this case\nwill presumably entitle hundreds or thousands of other objectors to the\nsame remedy. The Court has no reason to think that the administra-\ntive scheme it foists on the Government today is workable or effective\non a national scale.\n16            WHEATON COLLEGE v.

And, putting that aside,\nwhy wouldn\u2019t Wheaton\u2019s claim be exactly the same under\nthe Court\u2019s newly-fashioned system? Either way, the end\nresult will be that a third-party administrator will provide\ncontraceptive coverage. Surely the Court and Wheaton\nare not just objecting to the use of one stamp instead of\ntwo in order to avail itself of the accommodation.\n   The Court\u2019s actions in this case create unnecessary costs\nand layers of bureaucracy, and they ignore a simple truth:\nThe Government must be allowed to handle the basic\ntasks of public administration in a manner that comports\nwith common sense. It is not the business of this Court to\nensnare itself in the Government\u2019s ministerial handling of\nits affairs in the manner it does here.\n                         *    *     *\n   I have deep respect for religious faith, for the important\nand selfless work performed by religious organizations,\nand for the values of pluralism protected by RFRA and the\nFree Exercise Clause. But the Court\u2019s grant of an injunc-\ntion in this case allows Wheaton\u2019s beliefs about the effects\nof its actions to trump the democratic interest in allowing\nthe Government to enforce the law. In granting an injunc-\ntion concerning this religious nonprofit accommodation,\nthe availability of which served as the premise for the\nCourt\u2019s decision in Hobby Lobby, the Court cannot possibly\nbe applying our longstanding requirement that a party\u2019s\nentitlement to relief be indisputably clear.\n   Our jurisprudence has over the years drawn a careful\nboundary between majoritarian democracy and the right\nof every American to practice his or her religion freely.\nWe should not use the extraordinary vehicle of an injunc-\ntion under the All Writs Act to work so fundamental a\nshift in that boundary. Because Wheaton cannot justify\nthe relief it seeks, I would deny its application for an\ninjunction, and I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s\nrefusal to do so.\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Such division is a traditional ground for\ncertiorari. See S. Ct. Rule 10(a).\n  Nothing in this interim order affects the ability of the\napplicant\u2019s employees and students to obtain, without cost,\nthe full range of FDA approved contraceptives. The Gov-\nernment contends that the applicant\u2019s health insurance\nissuer and third-party administrator are required by\nfederal law to provide full contraceptive coverage regard-\nless whether the applicant completes EBSA Form 700.\n2             WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nThe applicant contends, by contrast, that the obligations of\nits health insurance issuer and third-party administrator\nare dependent on their receipt of notice that the applicant\nobjects to the contraceptive coverage requirement. But\nthe applicant has already notified the Government\u2014\nwithout using EBSA Form 700\u2014that it meets the re-\nquirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage\nrequirement on religious grounds. Nothing in this order\nprecludes the Government from relying on this notice, to\nthe extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provi-\nsion of full contraceptive coverage under the Act.\n   In light of the foregoing, this order should not be con-\nstrued as an expression of the Court\u2019s views on the merits.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA concurs in the result.\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG\nand JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.\n   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 124\nStat. 119, through its implementing regulations, requires\nemployer group health insurance plans to cover contracep-\ntive services without cost sharing. Recognizing that peo-\nple of religious faith may sincerely oppose the provision of\ncontraceptives, the Government has created certain excep-\ntions to this requirement. Churches are categorically\nexempt. Any religious nonprofit is also exempt, as long as\nit signs a form certifying that it is a religious nonprofit\nthat objects to the provision of contraceptive services, and\nprovides a copy of that form to its insurance issuer or\nthird-party administrator. The form is simple. The front\nasks the applicant to attest to the foregoing representa-\ntions; the back notifies third-party administrators of their\nregulatory obligations.\n   The matter before us is an application for an emergency\ninjunction filed by Wheaton College, a nonprofit liberal\narts college in Illinois. There is no dispute that Wheaton\nis entitled to the religious-nonprofit exemption from the\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncontraceptive coverage requirement. Wheaton nonethe-\nless asserts that the exemption itself impermissibly bur-\ndens Wheaton\u2019s free exercise of its religion in violation of\nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA),\n107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000bb et seq., on the theory\nthat its filing of a self-certification form will make it com-\nplicit in the provision of contraceptives by triggering the\nobligation for someone else to provide the services to\nwhich it objects. Wheaton has not stated a viable claim\nunder RFRA. Its claim ignores that the provision of con-\ntraceptive coverage is triggered not by its completion of\nthe self-certification form, but by federal law.\n  Even assuming that the accommodation somehow bur-\ndens Wheaton\u2019s religious exercise, the accommodation is\npermissible under RFRA because it is the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering the Government\u2019s compelling inter-\nests in public health and women\u2019s well-being. Indeed, just\nearlier this week in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.,\nante, at ___, the Court described the accommodation as \u201ca\nsystem that seeks to respect the religious liberty of reli-\ngious nonprofit corporations while ensuring that the em-\nployees of these entities have precisely the same access to\nall [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]-approved con-\ntraceptives as employees of companies whose owners have\nno religious objections to providing such coverage.\u201d Ante,\nat 3. And the Court concluded that the accommodation\n\u201cconstitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Gov-\nernment\u2019s aims while providing greater respect for reli-\ngious liberty.\u201d Ibid. Those who are bound by our decisions\nusually believe they can take us at our word. Not so to-\nday. After expressly relying on the availability of the\nreligious-nonprofit accommodation to hold that the contra-\nceptive coverage requirement violates RFRA as applied to\nclosely held for-profit corporations, the Court now, as the\ndissent in Hobby Lobby feared it might, see ante, at 29\u201330\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting), retreats from that position.\n4             WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nThat action evinces disregard for even the newest of this\nCourt\u2019s precedents and undermines confidence in this\ninstitution.\n   Even if one accepts Wheaton\u2019s view that the self-\ncertification procedure violates RFRA, that would not\njustify the Court\u2019s action today.       The Court grants\nWheaton a form of relief as rare as it is extreme: an inter-\nlocutory injunction under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71651, blocking the operation of a duly enacted law and\nregulations, in a case in which the courts below have not\nyet adjudicated the merits of the applicant\u2019s claims and in\nwhich those courts have declined requests for similar\ninjunctive relief. Injunctions of this nature are proper\nonly where \u201cthe legal rights at issue are indisputably\nclear.\u201d Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 507\nU. S. 1301, 1303 (1993) (Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Yet the Court today\norders this extraordinary relief even though no one could\ncredibly claim Wheaton\u2019s right to relief is indisputably\nclear.\n   The sincerity of Wheaton\u2019s deeply held religious beliefs\nis beyond refute. But as a legal matter, Wheaton\u2019s appli-\ncation comes nowhere near the high bar necessary to\nwarrant an emergency injunction from this Court. For\nthat reason, I respectfully dissent.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Affordable Care Act requires certain employer\ngroup health insurance plans to cover a number of preven-\ntative-health services without cost sharing. These services\ninclude \u201c[a]ll Food and Drug Administration . . . approved\ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and pa-\ntient education and counseling for all women with repro-\nductive capacity, as prescribed by a provider.\u201d 77 Fed.\nReg. 8725 (2012) (brackets and internal quotation marks\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

As a practical matter, the provision ensures that\nwomen have access to contraception at no cost beyond\ntheir insurance premiums. Employers that do not comply\nwith the mandate are subject to civil penalties.\n   Recognizing that some religions disapprove of contra-\nceptives, the Government has sought to implement the\nmandate in a manner consistent with the freedom of\nconscience. It has categorically exempted any group\nhealth plan of a \u201creligious employer,\u201d as defined by refer-\nence to the Tax Code provision governing churches. See\n45 CFR \u00a7147.131(a); http://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (as\nvisited July 2, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile). And it has extended a further accommodation to\nreligious nonprofits that do not satisfy the categorical\nexemption. All agree that Wheaton qualifies as a religious\nnonprofit.\n   To invoke the accommodation and avoid civil penalties,\na religious nonprofit need only file a self-certification form\nstating (1) that it \u201copposes providing coverage for some or\nall of any contraceptive services required to be covered\nunder [the regulation] on account of religious objections,\u201d\n(2) that it \u201cis organized and operates as a nonprofit en-\ntity,\u201d and (3) that it \u201cholds itself out as a religious organiza-\ntion.\u201d \u00a7147.131(b). The form is reprinted in an appendix\nto this opinion. Any organization that completes the form\nand provides a copy to its insurance issuer or third-party\nadministrator1 need not \u201ccontract, arrange, pay, or refer\nfor contraceptive coverage\u201d to which it objects. 78 Fed.\nReg. 39874 (2013); see 29 CFR \u00a72590.715\u20132713A(b)(1) and\n(c)(1).

Employers who\nmaintain self-insured plans cover the cost of claims for medical treat-\nment directly. Such employers often contract with third-party adminis-\ntrators to administer the claims process.\n6               WHEATON COLLEGE v.

The\nback of the self-certification form reminds third-party\nadministrators that receipt of the form constitutes notice\nthat they must comply with their regulatory obligations.\nSee Appendix, infra.\n                              B\n   Rather than availing itself of this simple accommoda-\ntion, Wheaton filed suit, asserting that completing the\nform and submitting it to its third-party administrator\nwould make it complicit in the provision of contraceptive\ncoverage, in violation of its religious beliefs. On that\nbasis, it sought a preliminary injunction, claiming that the\nlaw and regulations at issue violate RFRA, which provides\nthat the Government may not \u201csubstantially burden a\nperson\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d unless the application of that\nburden \u201cis the least restrictive means of furthering [a]\ncompelling governmental interest.\u201d 42 U.

After receipt of the Government\u2019s re-\nsponse, the Court today enters an order granting injunc-\ntive relief.\n                               II\n\n                                A\n\n   I disagree strongly with what the Court has done.\nWheaton asks us to enjoin the enforcement of a duly en-\nacted law and duly promulgated regulations before the\ncourts below have passed on the merits of its legal chal-\nlenge. Relief of this nature is extraordinary and reserved\nfor the rarest of cases. With good reason. The only source\nof authority for this Court to issue an injunction pending\nreview in the lower courts is the All Writs Act, which\nprovides that this Court \u201cmay issue all writs necessary or\nappropriate in aid of [its] . . . jurisdictio[n] and agreeable\nto the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 U.

Neutral application of this\nprinciple would compel the denial of Wheaton\u2019s application\nwithout any need to examine the merits, for two Courts of\nAppeals that have addressed similar claims have rejected\nthem.

But a petition for writ of certio-\nrari is not before us. Rather, given the posture of this appli-\ncation\u2014for an emergency injunction under the All Writs\nAct\u2014division of authority is reason not to grant relief.\n                               B\n   Wheaton\u2019s RFRA claim plainly does not satisfy our\ndemanding standard for the extraordinary relief it seeks.\n   For one thing, the merits of this case are not before this\nCourt for full review; adjudication of the merits is still\npending in the District Court. So nothing necessitates\nintervention in order to \u201c \u2018aid . . . our jurisdiction,\u2019 \u201d Turner\nBroadcasting System, 507 U. S., at 1301 (alterations omit-\nted), over any eventual certiorari petition from a decision\nrendered below. If the Government is allowed to enforce\nthe law, either Wheaton will file the self-certification form,\nor it will not. Either way, there will remain a live contro-\nversy that this Court could adjudicate after the case is\ndecided on the merits below. And either way, if Wheaton\nis correct in its challenge to the law, its rights will be\nvindicated and it will obtain the relief it seeks.\n   As to the merits, Wheaton\u2019s claim is likely to fail under\nany standard, let alone the standard that its entitlement\nto relief be \u201c \u2018indisputably clear,\u2019 \u201d ibid. Wheaton asserts\nthat filing the self-certification form might ultimately\nresult in the provision of contraceptive services to its\nemployees, thereby burdening its religious exercise. And\nit points out that if it does not file the form, it will face\ncivil penalties. But it is difficult to understand how these\narguments make out a viable RFRA claim.\n   RFRA requires Wheaton to show that the accommoda-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nto deny this one. Moreover, while uniformity certainly is important,\n\nuniform error is not. \n\n10            WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntion process \u201csubstantially burden[s] [its] exercise of reli-\ngion.\u201d \u00a72000bb\u20131(a). \u201cCongress no doubt meant the modi-\nfier \u2018substantially\u2019 to carry weight.\u201d Hobby Lobby, 573\nU. S., at ___ (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 20).\nWheaton, for religious reasons, categorically opposes the\nprovision of contraceptive services. The Government has\ngiven it a simple means to opt out of the contraceptive\ncoverage mandate\u2014and thus avoid any civil penalties for\nfailing to provide contraceptive services\u2014and a simple\nmeans to tell its third-party administrator of its claimed\nexemption.\n   Yet Wheaton maintains that taking these steps to avail\nitself of the accommodation would substantially burden its\nreligious exercise. Wheaton is \u201creligiously opposed to\nemergency contraceptives because they may act by killing\na human embryo.\u201d Emergency Application for Injunction\nPending Appellate Review 11. And it \u201cbelieves that au-\nthorizing its [third-party administrator] to provide these\ndrugs in [its] place makes it complicit in grave moral evil.\u201d\nIbid. Wheaton is mistaken\u2014not as a matter of religious\nfaith, in which it is undoubtedly sincere, but as a matter of\nlaw: Not every sincerely felt \u201cburden\u201d is a \u201csubstantial\u201d\none, and it is for courts, not litigants, to identify which\nare. See Hobby Lobby, 573 U. S., at ___ (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 21\u201322). Any provision of contra-\nceptive coverage by Wheaton\u2019s third-party administrator\nwould not result from any action by Wheaton; rather, in\nevery meaningful sense, it would result from the relevant\nlaw and regulations. The law and regulations require, in\nessence, that some entity provide contraceptive coverage.\nA religious nonprofit\u2019s choice not to be that entity may\nleave someone else obligated to provide coverage instead\u2014\nbut the obligation is created by the contraceptive coverage\nmandate imposed by law, not by the religious nonprofit\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                  11\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nchoice to opt out of it.5\n   Let me be absolutely clear: I do not doubt that Wheaton\ngenuinely believes that signing the self-certification form\nis contrary to its religious beliefs. But thinking one\u2019s\nreligious beliefs are substantially burdened\u2014no matter\nhow sincere or genuine that belief may be\u2014does not make\nit so.\n   An analogy used by the Seventh Circuit may help to\nexplain why Wheaton\u2019s complicity theory cannot be legally\nsound:\n     \u201cSuppose it is wartime, there is a draft, and a Quaker\n     is called up. Many Quakers are pacifists, and their\n     pacifism is a tenet of their religion. Suppose the\n     Quaker who\u2019s been called up tells the selective service\n     system that he\u2019s a conscientious objector. The selec-\n     tive service officer to whom he makes this pitch ac-\n     cepts the sincerity of his refusal to bear arms and ex-\n     cuses him. But as the Quaker leaves the selective\n     service office, he\u2019s told: \u2018you know this means we\u2019ll\n     have to draft someone in place of you\u2019\u2014and the Quaker\n     replies indignantly that if the government does\n     that, it will be violating his religious beliefs. Because\n     his religion teaches that no one should bear arms,\n     drafting another person in his place would make him\n     responsible for the military activities of his replace-\n     ment, and by doing so would substantially burden his\n     own sincere religious beliefs. Would this mean that\n     by exempting him the government had forced him to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Wheaton  notes that the back of the self-certification form provides\nthird-party administrators with notice of their regulatory obligations.\nSee Emergency Application for Injunction Pending Appellate Review 8;\nsee also Appendix, infra. That notice is merely an instruction to third-\nparty administrators; it is not a part of any of the representations\nrequired on the front of the form. No statement to which Wheaton\nmust assent in any way reflects agreement with or endorsement of the\nnotice.\n12            WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n     \u2018trigger\u2019 the drafting of a replacement who was not a\n     conscientious objector, and that the Religious Free-\n     dom Restoration Act would require a draft exemption\n     for both the Quaker and his non\u2010Quaker replace-\n     ment?\u201d Notre Dame, 743 F. 3d, at 556.\n   Here, similarly, the filing of the self-certification form\nmerely indicates to the third-party administrator that a\nreligious nonprofit has chosen to invoke the religious\naccommodation. If a religious nonprofit chooses not to pay\nfor contraceptive services, it is true that someone else may\nhave a legal obligation to pay for them, just as someone\nmay have to go to war in place of the conscientious objec-\ntor. But the obligation to provide contraceptive services,\nlike the obligation to serve in the Armed Forces, arises not\nfrom the filing of the form but from the underlying law\nand regulations.\n   It may be that what troubles Wheaton is that it must\nparticipate in any process the end result of which might be\nthe provision of contraceptives to its employees. But that\nis far from a substantial burden on its free exercise of\nreligion.\n   Even if one were to conclude that Wheaton meets the\nsubstantial burden requirement, the Government has\nshown that application of the burden is \u201cthe least restric-\ntive means\u201d to further a \u201ccompelling governmental inter-\nest,\u201d \u00a72000bb\u20131(b)(2). The contraceptive coverage re-\nquirement plainly furthers compelling interests in public\nhealth and women\u2019s well-being. See Hobby Lobby, ante, at\n2 (KENNEDY, J. concurring). And it is the \u201cleast restrictive\nmeans\u201d of furthering those interests. Indeed, as justifica-\ntion for its decision in Hobby Lobby\u2014issued just this\nweek\u2014the very Members of the Court that now vote to\ngrant injunctive relief concluded that the accommodation\n\u201cconstitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Gov-\nernment\u2019s aims while providing greater respect for reli-\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

As\nthe Court makes clear, this is not a case where it can be\nestablished that it is difficult to accommodate the govern-\nment\u2019s interest, and in fact the mechanism for doing so is\nalready in place\u201d). Today\u2019s grant of injunctive relief sim-\nply does not square with the Court\u2019s reasoning in Hobby\nLobby.\n   It should by now be clear just how far the Court has\nstrayed in granting Wheaton an interlocutory injunction\nagainst the enforcement of the law and regulations before\nthe courts below have adjudicated Wheaton\u2019s RFRA claim.\nTo warrant an injunction under the All Writs Act, the\nCourt must have more than a bare desire to suspend the\nexisting state of affairs; Wheaton\u2019s entitlement to relief\nmust be indisputably clear. While Wheaton\u2019s religious\nconviction is undoubtedly entitled to respect, it does not\ncome close to affording a basis for relief under the law.\n                          C\n  The Court\u2019s approach imposes an unwarranted and\nunprecedented burden on the Government\u2019s ability to\nadminister an important regulatory scheme. The Execu-\n14            WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntive is tasked with enforcing Congress\u2019 mandate that\npreventative care be available to citizens at no cost beyond\nthat of insurance. In providing the accommodation for\nwhich Wheaton is eligible, the Government has done a\nsalutary thing: exempt religious organizations from a\nrequirement that might otherwise burden them. Wheaton\nobjects, however, to the minimally burdensome paperwork\nnecessary for the Government to administer this ac-\ncommodation. If the Government cannot require or-\nganizations to attest to their views by way of a simple\nself-certification form and notify their third-party admin-\nistrators of their claimed exemption, how can it ever iden-\ntify the organizations eligible for the accommodation and\nperform the administrative tasks necessary to make the\naccommodation work? The self-certification form is the\nleast intrusive way for the Government to administer the\naccommodation. All that a religious organization must do\nis attest to the views that it holds and notify its third-\nparty administrator that it is exempt. The Government\nrightly accepts that attestation at face value; it does not\nquestion whether an organization\u2019s views are sincere. It is\nnot at all clear to me how the Government could adminis-\nter the religious nonprofit accommodation if Wheaton\nwere to prevail.\n   The Court has different ideas, however. Stepping into\nthe shoes of HHS, the Court sets out to craft a new admin-\nistrative regime. Its order grants injunctive relief so long\nas Wheaton \u201cinforms the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices in writing that it is a non-profit organization that\nholds itself out as religious and has religious objections to\nproviding coverage for contraceptive services.\u201d Supra, at\n1. And it goes further\u2014\u201c[t]o meet the condition for injunc-\ntion pending appeal,\u201d the Court continues, Wheaton \u201cneed\nnot use the [self-certification] form prescribed by the\nGovernment . . . and need not send copies to health insur-\nance issuers or third-party administrators.\u201d Ibid. This\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

Yet, without pause, the Court essentially does just\nthat.6\n   It is unclear why the Court goes to the lengths it does to\nrewrite HHS\u2019s regulations. Presumably the Court intends\nto leave to the agency the task of forwarding whatever\nnotification it receives to the respective insurer or third-\nparty administrator. But the Court does not even require\nthe religious nonprofit to identify its third-party adminis-\ntrator, and it neglects to explain how HHS is to identify\nthat entity. Of course, HHS is aware of Wheaton\u2019s third-\nparty administrator in this case. But what about other\ncases? Does the Court intend for HHS to rely on the filing\nof lawsuits by every entity claiming an exemption, such\nthat the identity of the third-party administrator will\nemerge in the pleadings or in discovery? Is HHS to under-\ntake the daunting\u2014if not impossible\u2014task of creating a\ndatabase that tracks every employer\u2019s insurer or third-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 This case is crucially unlike Little Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius, 571\n\nU. S. ___ (2014). There, the Court issued a comparable order \u201cbased on\nall the circumstances of the case\u201d\u2014in particular, the fact that the\napplicants\u2019 third-party administrator was a \u201cchurch plan\u201d that had no\nlegal obligation or intention to provide contraceptive coverage. See\nLittle Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6839900</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *10\u2013*11, *13 (D\nColo., Dec. 27, 2013). As a consequence, whatever the merits of that\nunusual order, it did not affect any individual\u2019s access to contraceptive\ncoverage. Not so here. Wheaton\u2019s third-party administrator bears the\nlegal obligation to provide contraceptive coverage only upon receipt of a\nvalid self-certification. See 26 CFR \u00a754.9815\u20132713A(b)(2) (2013); 29\nCFR \u00a72510.3\u201316(b) (2013). Today\u2019s injunction thus risks depriving\nhundreds of Wheaton\u2019s employees and students of their legal entitle-\nment to contraceptive coverage. In addition, because Wheaton is\nmaterially indistinguishable from other nonprofits that object to the\nGovernment\u2019s accommodation, the issuance of an injunction in this case\nwill presumably entitle hundreds or thousands of other objectors to the\nsame remedy. The Court has no reason to think that the administra-\ntive scheme it foists on the Government today is workable or effective\non a national scale.\n16            WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nparty administrator nationwide? And, putting that aside,\nwhy wouldn\u2019t Wheaton\u2019s claim be exactly the same under\nthe Court\u2019s newly-fashioned system? Either way, the end\nresult will be that a third-party administrator will provide\ncontraceptive coverage. Surely the Court and Wheaton\nare not just objecting to the use of one stamp instead of\ntwo in order to avail itself of the accommodation.\n   The Court\u2019s actions in this case create unnecessary costs\nand layers of bureaucracy, and they ignore a simple truth:\nThe Government must be allowed to handle the basic\ntasks of public administration in a manner that comports\nwith common sense. It is not the business of this Court to\nensnare itself in the Government\u2019s ministerial handling of\nits affairs in the manner it does here.\n                         *    *     *\n   I have deep respect for religious faith, for the important\nand selfless work performed by religious organizations,\nand for the values of pluralism protected by RFRA and the\nFree Exercise Clause. But the Court\u2019s grant of an injunc-\ntion in this case allows Wheaton\u2019s beliefs about the effects\nof its actions to trump the democratic interest in allowing\nthe Government to enforce the law. In granting an injunc-\ntion concerning this religious nonprofit accommodation,\nthe availability of which served as the premise for the\nCourt\u2019s decision in Hobby Lobby, the Court cannot possibly\nbe applying our longstanding requirement that a party\u2019s\nentitlement to relief be indisputably clear.\n   Our jurisprudence has over the years drawn a careful\nboundary between majoritarian democracy and the right\nof every American to practice his or her religion freely.\nWe should not use the extraordinary vehicle of an injunc-\ntion under the All Writs Act to work so fundamental a\nshift in that boundary. Because Wheaton cannot justify\nthe relief it seeks, I would deny its application for an\ninjunction, and I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s\nrefusal to do so.\n                     Cite as: 573 U.
