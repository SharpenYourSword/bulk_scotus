On December 15, 2005, Mrs. Smith was\r\nfound dead in the home she shared with respondent, and\r\nit was determined that she was killed by a massive blow to\r\nthe head from a fireplace log roller.

Respondent\u2019s\r\nDNA was also found on the murder weapon, pieces of duct\r\ntape found near the body, and a burned matchstick that\r\nwas found in the bedroom and that may have been used to\r\ninflict burns on the body. See id., at 863; see also People v.\r\nSmith, 2010 WL 4975500, *1\u2013*2 (Cal. App., Dec. 8, 2010).\r\nThe missing jewelry was discovered in the trunk of re-\r\nspondent\u2019s car, wrapped in duct tape from the same roll\r\nthat had provided the pieces found near the body. See 731\r\nF. 3d, at 863. Respondent\u2019s DNA was found on the duct\r\ntape in his trunk. See Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, at *2. In\r\naddition, a criminologist testified that the ransacking of\r\nthe Smiths\u2019 home appeared to have been staged. See 731\r\nF. 3d, at 863.\r\n  Respondent defended in part on the basis that he could\r\nnot have delivered the fatal blow due to rotator cuff sur-\r\ngery several weeks before the murder. See ibid. (He\r\nmounted this defense despite the fact that police had\r\nobserved him wielding a 6-foot-long 2 by 4 to pry some-\r\nthing out of a concrete slab at a construction site the week\r\nafter the murder. See Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, at *1.)\r\nThe defense also suggested that one of respondent\u2019s former\r\nemployees had committed the crime to obtain money to\r\npay a debt he owed respondent. See 731 F. 3d, at 863.\r\n  At the close of evidence, the prosecution requested an\r\naiding-and-abetting instruction, and the trial court agreed\r\nto give such an instruction. During closing argument, the\r\nprosecutor contended that respondent was physically able\r\nto wield the log roller that had killed Mrs. Smith, but he\r\nalso informed the jury that, even if respondent had not\r\ndelivered the fatal blow, he could still be convicted on an\r\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\r\n\r\n                          Per Curiam\r\n\r\naiding-and-abetting theory. See id., at 864. The jury\r\nconvicted respondent of first-degree murder without speci-\r\nfying which theory of guilt it adopted.\r\n   After a series of state-court proceedings not relevant\r\nhere, the California Court of Appeal affirmed respondent\u2019s\r\nconviction. The state court rejected respondent\u2019s assertion\r\nthat he had inadequate notice of the possibility of con-\r\nviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory. The court ex-\r\nplained that \u201c \u2018an accusatory pleading charging a defend-\r\nant with murder need not specify the theory of murder on\r\nwhich the prosecution intends to rely,\u2019 \u201d and noted that the\r\n\u201cinformation charged defendant with murder in compli-\r\nance with the governing statutes.\u201d Smith, 2010 WL\r\n4975500, at *6\u2013*7. Furthermore, the court held that \u201ceven\r\nif this case required greater specificity concerning the\r\nbasis of defendant\u2019s liability, the evidence presented at his\r\npreliminary examination provided it.\u201d Id., at *7. The\r\nupshot was that \u201cthe information and preliminary exami-\r\nnation testimony adequately notified defendant he could\r\nbe prosecuted for murder as an aider and abettor.\u201d Id., at\r\n*8. The California Supreme Court denied respondent\u2019s\r\npetition for review.\r\n   Respondent filed a petition for habeas relief with the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of\r\nCalifornia. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting\r\nrelief, and the District Court summarily adopted the\r\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation.\r\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court acknowledged\r\nthat the \u201cinformation charging [respondent] with first-\r\ndegree murder was initially sufficient to put him on notice\r\nthat he could be convicted either as a principal or as an\r\naider-and-abettor,\u201d because under California law \u201caiding\r\nand abetting a crime is the same substantive offense as\r\nperpetrating the crime.\u201d 731 F. 3d, at 868. But the Ninth\r\nCircuit nevertheless concluded that respondent\u2019s Sixth\r\nAmendment and due process right to notice had been\r\n4                     LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                         Per Curiam\r\n\r\nviolated because it believed the prosecution (until it re-\r\nquested the aiding-and-abetting jury instruction) had tried\r\nthe case only on the theory that respondent himself had\r\ndelivered the fatal blow. See id., at 869.\r\n  The Ninth Circuit did not purport to identify any case in\r\nwhich we have found notice constitutionally inadequate\r\nbecause, although the defendant was initially adequately\r\napprised of the offense against him, the prosecutor focused\r\nat trial on one potential theory of liability at the expense\r\nof another. Rather, it found the instant case to be \u201cindis-\r\ntinguishable from\u201d the Ninth Circuit\u2019s own decision in\r\nSheppard v. Rees, 909 F. 2d 1234 (1989), which the court\r\nthought \u201cfaithfully applied the principles enunciated by\r\nthe Supreme Court.\u201d 731 F. 3d, at 868. The court also\r\nrejected, as an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts,\u201d\r\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(2), the California Court of Appeal\u2019s\r\nconclusion that preliminary examination testimony and\r\nthe jury instructions conference put respondent on notice\r\nof the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting\r\ntheory. See id., at 871\u2013872.\r\n                             II\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  The Ninth Circuit held, and respondent does not dis-\r\npute, that respondent initially received adequate notice of\r\nthe possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting\r\ntheory. The question is therefore whether habeas relief is\r\nwarranted because the State principally relied at trial on\r\nthe theory that respondent himself delivered the fatal\r\nblow.\r\n  Assuming, arguendo, that a defendant is entitled to\r\nnotice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-\r\nabetting theory, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s grant of habeas relief\r\nmay be affirmed only if this Court\u2019s cases clearly establish\r\nthat a defendant, once adequately apprised of such a\r\npossibility, can nevertheless be deprived of adequate\r\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                      5\r\n\r\n                               Per Curiam\r\n\r\nnotice by a prosecutorial decision to focus on another\r\ntheory of liability at trial. The Ninth Circuit pointed to no\r\ncase of ours holding as much. Instead, the Court of Ap-\r\npeals cited three older cases that stand for nothing more\r\nthan the general proposition that a defendant must have\r\nadequate notice of the charges against him. See 731 F. 3d,\r\nat 866\u2013867 (citing Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749,\r\n763\u2013764 (1962); In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273\u2013274\r\n(1948); Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U. S. 196, 201 (1948)).\r\n   This proposition is far too abstract to establish clearly\r\nthe specific rule respondent needs. We have before cau-\r\ntioned the lower courts\u2014and the Ninth Circuit in particu-\r\nlar\u2014against \u201cframing our precedents at such a high level\r\nof generality.\u201d Nevada v. Jackson, 569 U. S. ___, ___\r\n(2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 7). None of our decisions\r\nthat the Ninth Circuit cited addresses, even remotely, the\r\nspecific question presented by this case. See Russell,\r\nsupra, at 752 (indictment for \u201crefus[ing] to answer any\r\nquestion pertinent to [a] question under [congressional]\r\ninquiry,\u201d 2 U. S. C. \u00a7192, failed to \u201cidentify the subject\r\nunder congressional subcommittee inquiry\u201d); In re Oliver,\r\nsupra, at 259 (instantaneous indictment, conviction, and\r\nsentence by judge acting as grand jury with no prior notice\r\nof charge to defendant); Cole, supra, at 197 (affirmance of\r\ncriminal convictions \u201cunder a . . . statute for violation of\r\nwhich [defendants] had not been charged\u201d).1\r\n   Because our case law does not clearly establish the legal\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   1 Respondent claims that our decision in Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U. S.\r\n\r\n110 (1991), although not cited by the Ninth Circuit, clearly establishes\r\nthe legal principle he needs. But Lankford is of no help to respondent.\r\nThat case addressed whether a defendant had adequate notice of the\r\npossibility of imposition of the death penalty\u2014a far different question\r\nfrom whether respondent had adequate notice of the particular theory\r\nof liability. See id., at 111. In Lankford, moreover, the trial court itself\r\nmade specific statements that encouraged the defendant to believe that\r\nthe death penalty was off the table. See id., at 116\u2013117.\r\n6                      LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                          Per Curiam\r\n\r\nproposition needed to grant respondent habeas relief, the\r\nNinth Circuit was forced to rely heavily on its own deci-\r\nsion in Sheppard, supra. Of course, AEDPA permits\r\nhabeas relief only if a state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to,\r\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\r\nlished Federal law\u201d as determined by this Court, not by\r\nthe courts of appeals. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). The Ninth\r\nCircuit attempted to evade this barrier by holding that\r\nSheppard \u201cfaithfully applied the principles enunciated by\r\nthe Supreme Court in Cole, Oliver, and Russell.\u201d 731\r\nF. 3d, at 868. But Circuit precedent cannot \u201crefine or\r\nsharpen a general principle of Supreme Court jurispru-\r\ndence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not\r\nannounced.\u201d Marshall, 569 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 6).\r\nSheppard is irrelevant to the question presented by this\r\ncase: whether our case law clearly establishes that a pros-\r\necutor\u2019s focus on one theory of liability at trial can render\r\nearlier notice of another theory of liability inadequate.\r\n                             B\r\n  The Ninth Circuit also disagreed with what it termed\r\nthe state court\u2019s \u201cdetermination of the facts\u201d\u2014principally,\r\nthe state court\u2019s holding that preliminary examination\r\ntestimony and the prosecutors\u2019 request for an aiding-and-\r\nabetting jury instruction shortly before closing arguments\r\nadequately put respondent on notice of the prosecution\u2019s\r\naiding-and-abetting theory. 731 F. 3d, at 871 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit therefore\r\ngranted relief under \u00a72254(d)(2), which permits habeas\r\nrelief where the state-court \u201cdecision . . . was based on an\r\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\r\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d That\r\nholding cannot be sustained.\r\n  In purporting to reject the state court\u2019s \u201cdetermination\r\nof the facts,\u201d the Ninth Circuit focused on preliminary\r\nexamination testimony by an investigator about conversa-\r\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\r\n\r\n                           Per Curiam\r\n\r\ntions between respondent and his cellmate. According to\r\nthe investigator, the cellmate stated that respondent told\r\nhim that respondent \u201chad to get rid of his wife because she\r\nwas standing in the way of his future plans; that she was\r\nthreatening to divorce him and he wasn\u2019t going to give up\r\nhalf of his property\u201d; that respondent made his house look\r\nlike the site of a home invasion robbery; and that, when he\r\nleft for work the morning of the murder, he left the win-\r\ndow open and did not set the alarm. Smith, 2010 WL\r\n4975500, at *7. The investigator also testified that the\r\ncellmate did not \u201c \u2018know any of the details of the homicide\r\nitself and how it was carried out,\u2019 \u201d and that respondent\r\n\u201c \u2018never told [the cellmate] specifically who\u2019 \u201d committed the\r\nhomicide. Ibid. The California Court of Appeal held that\r\nthese statements, taken together, suggested that respond-\r\nent was involved in planning and facilitating the crime but\r\nthat the fatal blow might have been delivered by an ac-\r\ncomplice. Ibid. Thus, the California court believed that\r\neven assuming that the information by itself was not\r\nsufficient, this testimony naturally lent itself to conviction\r\non an aiding-and-abetting theory and so gave respondent\r\neven greater notice of such a possibility. Ibid.\r\n   The Ninth Circuit also focused on the jury instructions\r\nconference, which occurred after the defense rested but\r\nbefore the parties\u2019 closing arguments. During that confer-\r\nence, prosecutors requested an aiding-and-abetting in-\r\nstruction, which further provided notice to respondent.\r\nThe California Court of Appeal concluded that this case is\r\ndistinguishable from Sheppard v. Rees, 909 F. 2d 1234,\r\nbecause, unlike that case, the conference here did not\r\noccur immediately before closing arguments. The Ninth\r\nCircuit disagreed, holding that because \u201cdefense counsel\r\nhad only the lunch recess to formulate a response\u201d to the\r\naiding-and-abetting instruction, this case \u201cis indistin-\r\nguishable from Sheppard,\u201d where the prosecution also\r\n\u201crequested the new instruction the same day as closing.\u201d\r\n8                          LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                              Per Curiam\r\n\r\n731 F. 3d, at 868, 870.\r\n   Although the Ninth Circuit claimed its disagreement\r\nwith the state court was factual in nature, in reality its\r\ngrant of relief was based on a legal conclusion about the\r\nadequacy of the notice provided. The Ninth Circuit be-\r\nlieved that the events detailed above, even when taken\r\ntogether with the information filed against respondent,\r\nfailed to measure up to the standard of notice applicable in\r\ncases like this. That ranked as a legal determination\r\ngoverned by \u00a72254(d)(1), not one of fact governed by\r\n\u00a72254(d)(2). But, as we have explained, the Ninth Circuit\r\ncited only its own precedent for establishing the appropri-\r\nate standard. Absent a decision of ours clearly establish-\r\ning the relevant standard, the Ninth Circuit had nothing\r\nagainst which it could assess, and deem lacking, the notice\r\nafforded respondent by the information and proceedings.\r\nIt therefore had no basis to reject the state court\u2019s assess-\r\nment that respondent was adequately apprised of the pos-\r\nsibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.2\r\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The\r\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\r\nNinth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                                     It is so ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n    2 Because we reverse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on the foregoing\r\ngrounds, we need not opine on the correctness of that court\u2019s discussion\r\nof Griffin v.

In\r\naddition, a criminologist testified that the ransacking of\r\nthe Smiths\u2019 home appeared to have been staged. See 731\r\nF. 3d, at 863.\r\n  Respondent defended in part on the basis that he could\r\nnot have delivered the fatal blow due to rotator cuff sur-\r\ngery several weeks before the murder. See ibid. (He\r\nmounted this defense despite the fact that police had\r\nobserved him wielding a 6-foot-long 2 by 4 to pry some-\r\nthing out of a concrete slab at a construction site the week\r\nafter the murder.

See 731 F. 3d, at 863.\r\n  At the close of evidence, the prosecution requested an\r\naiding-and-abetting instruction, and the trial court agreed\r\nto give such an instruction. During closing argument, the\r\nprosecutor contended that respondent was physically able\r\nto wield the log roller that had killed Mrs. Smith, but he\r\nalso informed the jury that, even if respondent had not\r\ndelivered the fatal blow, he could still be convicted on an\r\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

The jury\r\nconvicted respondent of first-degree murder without speci-\r\nfying which theory of guilt it adopted.\r\n   After a series of state-court proceedings not relevant\r\nhere, the California Court of Appeal affirmed respondent\u2019s\r\nconviction. The state court rejected respondent\u2019s assertion\r\nthat he had inadequate notice of the possibility of con-\r\nviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory. The court ex-\r\nplained that \u201c \u2018an accusatory pleading charging a defend-\r\nant with murder need not specify the theory of murder on\r\nwhich the prosecution intends to rely,\u2019 \u201d and noted that the\r\n\u201cinformation charged defendant with murder in compli-\r\nance with the governing statutes.\u201d Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"830529\"><a href=\"/mich/5fTt/people-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">4975500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6\u2013*7. Furthermore, the court held that \u201ceven\r\nif this case required greater specificity concerning the\r\nbasis of defendant\u2019s liability, the evidence presented at his\r\npreliminary examination provided it.\u201d Id., at *7. The\r\nupshot was that \u201cthe information and preliminary exami-\r\nnation testimony adequately notified defendant he could\r\nbe prosecuted for murder as an aider and abettor.\u201d Id., at\r\n*8. The California Supreme Court denied respondent\u2019s\r\npetition for review.\r\n   Respondent filed a petition for habeas relief with the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of\r\nCalifornia. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting\r\nrelief, and the District Court summarily adopted the\r\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation.\r\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court acknowledged\r\nthat the \u201cinformation charging [respondent] with first-\r\ndegree murder was initially sufficient to put him on notice\r\nthat he could be convicted either as a principal or as an\r\naider-and-abettor,\u201d because under California law \u201caiding\r\nand abetting a crime is the same substantive offense as\r\nperpetrating the crime.\u201d 731 F. 3d, at 868. But the Ninth\r\nCircuit nevertheless concluded that respondent\u2019s Sixth\r\nAmendment and due process right to notice had been\r\n4                     LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                         Per Curiam\r\n\r\nviolated because it believed the prosecution (until it re-\r\nquested the aiding-and-abetting jury instruction) had tried\r\nthe case only on the theory that respondent himself had\r\ndelivered the fatal blow. See id., at 869.\r\n  The Ninth Circuit did not purport to identify any case in\r\nwhich we have found notice constitutionally inadequate\r\nbecause, although the defendant was initially adequately\r\napprised of the offense against him, the prosecutor focused\r\nat trial on one potential theory of liability at the expense\r\nof another. Rather, it found the instant case to be \u201cindis-\r\ntinguishable from\u201d the Ninth Circuit\u2019s own decision in\r\nSheppard v. Rees, 909 F. 2d 1234 (1989), which the court\r\nthought \u201cfaithfully applied the principles enunciated by\r\nthe Supreme Court.\u201d 731 F. 3d, at 868. The court also\r\nrejected, as an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts,\u201d\r\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(2), the California Court of Appeal\u2019s\r\nconclusion that preliminary examination testimony and\r\nthe jury instructions conference put respondent on notice\r\nof the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting\r\ntheory. See id., at 871\u2013872.\r\n                             II\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  The Ninth Circuit held, and respondent does not dis-\r\npute, that respondent initially received adequate notice of\r\nthe possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting\r\ntheory. The question is therefore whether habeas relief is\r\nwarranted because the State principally relied at trial on\r\nthe theory that respondent himself delivered the fatal\r\nblow.\r\n  Assuming, arguendo, that a defendant is entitled to\r\nnotice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-\r\nabetting theory, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s grant of habeas relief\r\nmay be affirmed only if this Court\u2019s cases clearly establish\r\nthat a defendant, once adequately apprised of such a\r\npossibility, can nevertheless be deprived of adequate\r\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

The Ninth Circuit pointed to no\r\ncase of ours holding as much. Instead, the Court of Ap-\r\npeals cited three older cases that stand for nothing more\r\nthan the general proposition that a defendant must have\r\nadequate notice of the charges against him. See 731 F. 3d,\r\nat 866\u2013867 (citing Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749,\r\n763\u2013764 (1962); In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273\u2013274\r\n(1948); Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U. S. 196, 201 (1948)).\r\n   This proposition is far too abstract to establish clearly\r\nthe specific rule respondent needs. We have before cau-\r\ntioned the lower courts\u2014and the Ninth Circuit in particu-\r\nlar\u2014against \u201cframing our precedents at such a high level\r\nof generality.\u201d Nevada v. Jackson, 569 U. S. ___, ___\r\n(2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 7). None of our decisions\r\nthat the Ninth Circuit cited addresses, even remotely, the\r\nspecific question presented by this case. See Russell,\r\nsupra, at 752 (indictment for \u201crefus[ing] to answer any\r\nquestion pertinent to [a] question under [congressional]\r\ninquiry,\u201d 2 U. S. C. \u00a7192, failed to \u201cidentify the subject\r\nunder congressional subcommittee inquiry\u201d); In re Oliver,\r\nsupra, at 259 (instantaneous indictment, conviction, and\r\nsentence by judge acting as grand jury with no prior notice\r\nof charge to defendant); Cole, supra, at 197 (affirmance of\r\ncriminal convictions \u201cunder a . . . statute for violation of\r\nwhich [defendants] had not been charged\u201d).1\r\n   Because our case law does not clearly establish the legal\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   1 Respondent claims that our decision in Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U. S.\r\n\r\n110 (1991), although not cited by the Ninth Circuit, clearly establishes\r\nthe legal principle he needs. But Lankford is of no help to respondent.\r\nThat case addressed whether a defendant had adequate notice of the\r\npossibility of imposition of the death penalty\u2014a far different question\r\nfrom whether respondent had adequate notice of the particular theory\r\nof liability. See id., at 111. In Lankford, moreover, the trial court itself\r\nmade specific statements that encouraged the defendant to believe that\r\nthe death penalty was off the table. See id., at 116\u2013117.\r\n6                      LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                          Per Curiam\r\n\r\nproposition needed to grant respondent habeas relief, the\r\nNinth Circuit was forced to rely heavily on its own deci-\r\nsion in Sheppard, supra. Of course, AEDPA permits\r\nhabeas relief only if a state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to,\r\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\r\nlished Federal law\u201d as determined by this Court, not by\r\nthe courts of appeals. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). The Ninth\r\nCircuit attempted to evade this barrier by holding that\r\nSheppard \u201cfaithfully applied the principles enunciated by\r\nthe Supreme Court in Cole, Oliver, and Russell.\u201d 731\r\nF. 3d, at 868. But Circuit precedent cannot \u201crefine or\r\nsharpen a general principle of Supreme Court jurispru-\r\ndence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not\r\nannounced.\u201d Marshall, 569 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 6).\r\nSheppard is irrelevant to the question presented by this\r\ncase: whether our case law clearly establishes that a pros-\r\necutor\u2019s focus on one theory of liability at trial can render\r\nearlier notice of another theory of liability inadequate.\r\n                             B\r\n  The Ninth Circuit also disagreed with what it termed\r\nthe state court\u2019s \u201cdetermination of the facts\u201d\u2014principally,\r\nthe state court\u2019s holding that preliminary examination\r\ntestimony and the prosecutors\u2019 request for an aiding-and-\r\nabetting jury instruction shortly before closing arguments\r\nadequately put respondent on notice of the prosecution\u2019s\r\naiding-and-abetting theory. 731 F. 3d, at 871 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit therefore\r\ngranted relief under \u00a72254(d)(2), which permits habeas\r\nrelief where the state-court \u201cdecision . . . was based on an\r\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\r\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d That\r\nholding cannot be sustained.\r\n  In purporting to reject the state court\u2019s \u201cdetermination\r\nof the facts,\u201d the Ninth Circuit focused on preliminary\r\nexamination testimony by an investigator about conversa-\r\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\r\n\r\n                           Per Curiam\r\n\r\ntions between respondent and his cellmate. According to\r\nthe investigator, the cellmate stated that respondent told\r\nhim that respondent \u201chad to get rid of his wife because she\r\nwas standing in the way of his future plans; that she was\r\nthreatening to divorce him and he wasn\u2019t going to give up\r\nhalf of his property\u201d; that respondent made his house look\r\nlike the site of a home invasion robbery; and that, when he\r\nleft for work the morning of the murder, he left the win-\r\ndow open and did not set the alarm. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"830529\"><a href=\"/mich/5fTt/people-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">4975500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7. The investigator also testified that the\r\ncellmate did not \u201c \u2018know any of the details of the homicide\r\nitself and how it was carried out,\u2019 \u201d and that respondent\r\n\u201c \u2018never told [the cellmate] specifically who\u2019 \u201d committed the\r\nhomicide. Ibid. The California Court of Appeal held that\r\nthese statements, taken together, suggested that respond-\r\nent was involved in planning and facilitating the crime but\r\nthat the fatal blow might have been delivered by an ac-\r\ncomplice. Ibid. Thus, the California court believed that\r\neven assuming that the information by itself was not\r\nsufficient, this testimony naturally lent itself to conviction\r\non an aiding-and-abetting theory and so gave respondent\r\neven greater notice of such a possibility. Ibid.\r\n   The Ninth Circuit also focused on the jury instructions\r\nconference, which occurred after the defense rested but\r\nbefore the parties\u2019 closing arguments. During that confer-\r\nence, prosecutors requested an aiding-and-abetting in-\r\nstruction, which further provided notice to respondent.\r\nThe California Court of Appeal concluded that this case is\r\ndistinguishable from Sheppard v. Rees, 909 F. 2d 1234,\r\nbecause, unlike that case, the conference here did not\r\noccur immediately before closing arguments. The Ninth\r\nCircuit disagreed, holding that because \u201cdefense counsel\r\nhad only the lunch recess to formulate a response\u201d to the\r\naiding-and-abetting instruction, this case \u201cis indistin-\r\nguishable from Sheppard,\u201d where the prosecution also\r\n\u201crequested the new instruction the same day as closing.\u201d\r\n8                          LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                              Per Curiam\r\n\r\n731 F. 3d, at 868, 870.\r\n   Although the Ninth Circuit claimed its disagreement\r\nwith the state court was factual in nature, in reality its\r\ngrant of relief was based on a legal conclusion about the\r\nadequacy of the notice provided. The Ninth Circuit be-\r\nlieved that the events detailed above, even when taken\r\ntogether with the information filed against respondent,\r\nfailed to measure up to the standard of notice applicable in\r\ncases like this. That ranked as a legal determination\r\ngoverned by \u00a72254(d)(1), not one of fact governed by\r\n\u00a72254(d)(2). But, as we have explained, the Ninth Circuit\r\ncited only its own precedent for establishing the appropri-\r\nate standard. Absent a decision of ours clearly establish-\r\ning the relevant standard, the Ninth Circuit had nothing\r\nagainst which it could assess, and deem lacking, the notice\r\nafforded respondent by the information and proceedings.\r\nIt therefore had no basis to reject the state court\u2019s assess-\r\nment that respondent was adequately apprised of the pos-\r\nsibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.2\r\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The\r\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\r\nNinth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                                     It is so ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n    2 Because we reverse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on the foregoing\r\ngrounds, we need not opine on the correctness of that court\u2019s discussion\r\nof Griffin v. United States, 502 U. S. 46 (1991), or Brecht v. Abraham-\r\nson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993).\r\n</pre>",
