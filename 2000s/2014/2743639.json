UNITED STATES\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n     STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF\n\n                   COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 13\u201310026.   Decided October 14, 2014\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and\nJUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting from denial of\ncertiorari.\n   A jury convicted petitioners Joseph Jones, Desmond\nThurston, and Antwuan Ball of distributing very small\namounts of crack cocaine, and acquitted them of conspir-\ning to distribute drugs. The sentencing judge, however,\nfound that they had engaged in the charged conspiracy\nand, relying largely on that finding, imposed sentences\nthat petitioners say were many times longer than those\nthe Guidelines would otherwise have recommended.\n   Petitioners present a strong case that, but for the\njudge\u2019s finding of fact, their sentences would have been\n\u201csubstantively unreasonable\u201d and therefore illegal. See\nRita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 372 (2007) (SCALIA,\nJ., joined by THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concur-\nring in judgment). If so, their constitutional rights were\nviolated. The Sixth Amendment, together with the Fifth\nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, \u201crequires that each\nelement of a crime\u201d be either admitted by the defendant,\nor \u201cproved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Alleyne\nv. United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3).\nAny fact that increases the penalty to which a defendant is\nexposed constitutes an element of a crime, Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 483, n. 10, 490 (2000), and\n\u201cmust be found by a jury, not a judge,\u201d Cunningham v.\n2                    JONES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCalifornia, 549 U. S. 270, 281 (2007).* We have held that\na substantively unreasonable penalty is illegal and must\nbe set aside. Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 51 (2007).\nIt unavoidably follows that any fact necessary to prevent a\nsentence from being substantively unreasonable\u2014thereby\nexposing the defendant to the longer sentence\u2014is an\nelement that must be either admitted by the defendant or\nfound by the jury. It may not be found by a judge.\n   For years, however, we have refrained from saying so.\nIn Rita v. United States, we dismissed the possibility of\nSixth Amendment violations resulting from substantive\nreasonableness review as hypothetical and not presented\nby the facts of the case. We thus left for another day the\nquestion whether the Sixth Amendment is violated when\ncourts impose sentences that, but for a judge-found fact,\nwould be reversed for substantive unreasonableness. 551\nU. S., at 353; see also id., at 366 (Stevens, J., joined in\npart by GINSBURG, J., concurring) (\u201cSuch a hypothetical\ncase should be decided if and when it arises\u201d). Nonethe-\nless, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly taken our\ncontinuing silence to suggest that the Constitution does\npermit otherwise unreasonable sentences supported by\njudicial factfinding, so long as they are within the statu-\ntory range. See, e.g., United States v. Benkahla, 530 F. 3d\n300, 312 (CA4 2008); United States v. Hernandez, 633\nF. 3d 370, 374 (CA5 2011); United States v. Ashqar, 582\nF. 3d 819, 824\u2013825 (CA7 2009); United States v. Tread-\nwell, 593 F. 3d 990, 1017\u20131018 (CA9 2010); United States\nv. Redcorn, 528 F. 3d 727, 745\u2013746 (CA10 2008).\n   This has gone on long enough. The present petition\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * With one exception: We held in Almendarez-Torres v. United States,\n523 U. S. 224 (1998), that the fact of a prior conviction, even when it\nincreases the sentence to which the defendant is exposed, may be found\nby a judge. But see id., at 248 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Rangel-Reyes v.\nUnited States, 547 U. S. 1200, 1202 (2006) (THOMAS, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari).\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npresents the nonhypothetical case the Court claimed to\nhave been waiting for. And it is a particularly appealing\ncase, because not only did no jury convict these defendants\nof the offense the sentencing judge thought them guilty of,\nbut a jury acquitted them of that offense. Petitioners were\nconvicted of distributing drugs, but acquitted of conspiring\nto distribute drugs. The sentencing judge found that\npetitioners had engaged in the conspiracy of which the\njury acquitted them. The Guidelines, petitioners claim,\nrecommend sentences of between 27 and 71 months for\ntheir distribution convictions. But in light of the conspir-\nacy finding, the court calculated much higher Guidelines\nranges, and sentenced Jones, Thurston, and Ball to 180,\n194, and 225 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n   On petitioners\u2019 appeal, the D. C. Circuit held that even if\ntheir sentences would have been substantively unreasona-\nble but for judge-found facts, their Sixth Amendment\nrights were not violated. 744 F. 3d 1362, 1369 (2014). We\nshould grant certiorari to put an end to the unbroken\nstring of cases disregarding the Sixth Amendment\u2014or to\neliminate the Sixth Amendment difficulty by acknowledg-\ning that all sentences below the statutory maximum are\nsubstantively reasonable.\n",
