In all like-\nlihood, then, Texas’ poll workers are at least as familiar\nwith Texas’ pre-Senate Bill 14 procedures as they are with\nthe new law’s requirements.\n   True, in Purcell and in recent rulings on applications\ninvolving voting procedures, this Court declined to upset a\nState’s electoral apparatus close to an election. Since\nNovember 2013, however, when the District Court estab-\nlished an expedited schedule for resolution of this case,\nTexas knew full well that the court would issue its ruling\nonly weeks away from the election. The State thus had\ntime to prepare for the prospect of an order barring the\nenforcement of Senate Bill 14. Of greater significance, the\nDistrict Court found “woefully lacking” and “grossly”\nunderfunded the State’s efforts to familiarize the public\nand poll workers regarding the new identification re-\nquirements. No. 13–cv–00193 (SD Tex., Oct. 9, 2014), pp.\n20, 31–32, 91, n. 398 (Op.). Furthermore, after the Dis-\ntrict Court’s injunction issued and despite the State’s\napplication to the Court of Appeals for a stay, Texas\nstopped issuing alternative “election identification certifi-\ncates” and completely removed mention of Senate Bill 14’s\nrequirements from government Web sites. See Emergency\nApplication to Vacate Fifth Circuit Stay of Permanent\nInjunction 11 and App. H. In short, any voter confusion or\nlack of public confidence in Texas’ electoral processes is in\nthis case largely attributable to the State itself.\n   Senate Bill 14 replaced the previously existing voter\nidentification requirements with the strictest regime in\nthe country.

Those who lack the\napproved forms of identification may obtain an “election\nidentification certificate” from the Texas Department of\nPublic Safety (DPS), but more than 400,000 eligible voters\nface round-trip travel times of three hours or more to the\nnearest DPS office. Op. 18, 76. Moreover, applicants for\nan election identification certificate ordinarily must pre-\nsent a certified birth certificate. Id., at 70. A birth certifi-\ncate, however, can be obtained only at significant cost—at\nleast $22 for a standard certificate sent by mail. Id., at 22.\nAnd although reduced-fee birth certificates may be ob-\ntained for $2 to $3, the State did not publicize that option\non DPS’s Web site or on Department of Health and Hu-\nman Services forms for requesting birth certificates. Id.,\nat 70.\n   On an extensive factual record developed in the course\nof a nine-day trial, the District Court found Senate Bill 14\nirreconcilable with §2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965\nbecause it was enacted with a racially discriminatory\npurpose and would yield a prohibited discriminatory\nresult. The District Court emphasized the “virtually\nunchallenged” evidence that Senate Bill 14 “bear[s] more\nheavily on” minority voters. Id., at 133. In light of the\n“seismic demographic shift” in Texas between 2000 and\n2010, making Texas a “majority-minority state,” the Dis-\ntrict Court observed that the Texas Legislature and Gov-\nernor had an evident incentive to “gain partisan ad-\nvantage by suppressing” the “votes of African-Americans\nand Latinos.” Id., at 40, 48, 128.

The District Court also found a tenuous connec-\ntion between the harms Senate Bill 14 aimed to ward off,\nand the means adopted by the State to that end. Between\n2002 and 2011, there were only two in-person voter fraud\ncases prosecuted to conviction in Texas. Op. 13–14. De-\nspite awareness of the Bill’s adverse effect on eligible-to-\nvote minorities, the Texas Legislature rejected a “litany of\nameliorative amendments” designed to lessen the Bill’s\nimpact on minority voters—for example, amendments\npermitting additional forms of identification, eliminating\nfees, providing indigence exceptions, and increasing voter\neducation and funding—without undermining the Bill’s\npurported policy justifications. Id., at 35–37, 132 144–147.\nTexas did not begin to demonstrate that the Bill’s discrim-\ninatory features were necessary to prevent fraud or to\nincrease public confidence in the electoral process. Id., at\n133; see also Id., at 113 (proponents of Bill unable to\n“articulate any reason that a more expansive list of photo\nIDs would sabotage” their efforts at detecting and deter-\nring voter fraud). On this plain evidence, the District\nCourt concluded that the Bill would not have been enacted\nabsent its racially disparate effects. Id., at 133.\n   The District Court further found that Senate Bill 14\noperates as an unconstitutional poll tax—an issue neither\npresented by any of the recent applications nor before the\nCourt in Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd., 553\nU. S. 181 (2008) (upholding Indiana voter identification\nlaw against facial constitutional challenge). See Id., at\n186, and n. 4. Under Senate Bill 14, a cost attends every\nform of qualified identification available to the general\npublic. Op. 140. Texas tells the Court that any number of\nincidental costs are associated with voting. But the cost at\nissue here is one deliberately imposed by the State. Even\nat $2, the toll is at odds with this Court’s precedent. See\n6                     VEASEY v. PERRY\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nHarper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U.

A voter\nwhose birth certificate lists her maiden name or misstates\nher date of birth may be charged $37 for the amended\ncertificate she needs to obtain a qualifying ID. Texas\nvoters born in other States may be required to pay sub-\nstantially more than that. Op. 71–74.\n  The potential magnitude of racially discriminatory voter\ndisenfranchisement counseled hesitation before disturbing\nthe District Court’s findings and final judgment. Senate\nBill 14 may prevent more than 600,000 registered Texas\nvoters (about 4.5% of all registered voters) from voting in\nperson for lack of compliant identification. Id., at 50–51,\n54. A sharply disproportionate percentage of those voters\nare African-American or Hispanic. Ibid.\n  Unsurprisingly, Senate Bill 14 did not survive federal\npreclearance under §5 of the Voting Rights Act. A three-\njudge District Court unanimously determined that the law\nwould have a prohibited discriminatory effect on minority\nvoters. See Texas v.

Supp. 2d 113, 115, 138\n(DC 2012) (Tatel, J.). Although this Court vacated the\npreclearance denial in light of Shelby County v. Holder,\n570 U. S. ___ (2013), racial discrimination in elections in\nTexas is no mere historical artifact. To the contrary,\nTexas has been found in violation of the Voting Rights Act\nin every redistricting cycle from and after 1970. Op. 7.\nSee, e.g., Texas v. United States, 887 F. Supp. 2d 133 (DC\n2012) (Griffith, J.). The District Court noted particularly\nplaintiffs’ evidence—largely unchallenged by Texas—\nregarding the State’s long history of official discrimination\nin voting, the statewide existence of racially polarized\nvoting, the incidence of overtly racial political campaigns,\nthe disproportionate lack of minority elected officials, and\nthe failure of elected officials to respond to the concerns of\nminority voters. Op. 3–13, 122–126, 144–147.\n  The greatest threat to public confidence in elections in\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthis case is the prospect of enforcing a purposefully dis-\ncriminatory law, one that likely imposes an unconstitu-\ntional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hun-\ndreds of thousands of eligible voters. To prevent that\ndisenfranchisement, I would vacate the Fifth Circuit’s stay\nof the permanent injunction ordered by the District Court.\n", "precedential_status": "Relating-to", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2743678/", "sha1": "022e7a0eae758bcd451f483bc65a9db7f096b70d", "source": "C", "time_retrieved": "2014-10-20T00:01:07.364777"}
