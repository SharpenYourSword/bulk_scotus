UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 13\u20138827. Decided October 20, 2014\n\n\n   The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma\npauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are grant-\ned. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nfor further consideration in light of Burrage v. United\nStates, 571 U. S. ___ (2014).\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring.\n   A jury convicted petitioner, a medical doctor, of four\ncounts of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance\nleading to death. He was sentenced to four consecutive\nlife sentences for those four deaths. Without the benefit of\nBurrage v. United States, 571 U. S. ___ (2014), the Sixth\nCircuit upheld the jury\u2019s verdict. Burrage holds that \u201cat\nleast where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is\nnot an independently sufficient cause of the victim\u2019s\ndeath,\u201d conviction is improper \u201cunless such use is a but-for\ncause of the death or injury.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14\u2013\n15). But-for causation exists where the controlled sub-\nstance \u201ccombines with other factors to produce\u201d death, so\nlong as death would have not occurred \u201cwithout the in-\ncremental effect\u201d of the controlled substance. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 7). Because the Sixth Circuit did not focus on\nbut-for causation, I join the Court\u2019s order to vacate and\nremand.\n   I write separately, however, to highlight the nature of\npetitioner\u2019s burden going forward. Petitioner concedes\nthat even \u201c[w]ithout having the benefit of this Court\u2019s\nBurrage opinion, the district court nonetheless gave the\n2               VOLKMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\njury a \u2018but-for\u2019 causation instruction.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 21.\nEven on petitioner\u2019s theory, therefore, the question is\nwhether the Sixth Circuit should have \u201cset aside the jury\u2019s\nverdict on the ground of insufficient evidence.\u201d Ibid. As\npetitioner acknowledges, this means that he can prevail\nonly by showing that no rational trier of fact could have\nfound, as the jury did here, \u201cthat death would not have\noccurred in these individuals but for the use of the oxyco-\ndone prescribed.\u201d Ibid. (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443\nU. S. 307, 319 (1979)).\n   The jury reached its verdict after a 35-day trial. See 736\nF. 3d 1013, 1019 (CA6 2013). During that trial jurors\nlearned much about the deaths of petitioner\u2019s patients.\nFor instance, petitioner prescribed one opiate (oxycodone)\nand two other drugs (diazepam and alprazolam) to Steven\nCraig Hieneman. Id., at 1027. Hieneman \u201cdied twelve\nhours\u201d later and was \u201cfound dead with the very drugs the\ndoctor prescribed.\u201d Id., at 1027\u20131028. The jury also heard\nfrom a deputy coroner that \u201cHieneman died an opiate-\ninduced death.\u201d Id., at 1027. The question on remand is\nwhether evidence of this sort, if credited, would allow a\nrational jury to conclude that Hieneman would not have\ndied but for the oxycodone dispensed by petitioner. That\nsame question will have to be answered for each of peti-\ntioner\u2019s patients.\n   In short, nothing in today\u2019s order should be understood\nas suggesting that petitioner is entitled to acquittal.\nPetitioner\u2019s convictions should be affirmed if the Sixth\nCircuit finds that the evidence from trial\u2014\u201cconsidered in\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d Jackson,\nsupra, at 319\u2014shows that a rational jury could have found\nas this jury, in fact, did. The Court\u2019s order, moreover, has\nno bearing on petitioner\u2019s other convictions for conspiracy\nto unlawfully distribute a controlled substance, unlawful\ndistribution of a controlled substance, maintaining a drug-\ninvolved premises, and possession of a firearm in further-\nance of a drug-trafficking offense.\n",
