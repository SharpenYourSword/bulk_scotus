UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 13–8827. Decided October 20, 2014\n\n\n   The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma\npauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are grant-\ned. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nfor further consideration in light of Burrage v. United\nStates, 571 U. S. ___ (2014).\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring.\n   A jury convicted petitioner, a medical doctor, of four\ncounts of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance\nleading to death. He was sentenced to four consecutive\nlife sentences for those four deaths. Without the benefit of\nBurrage v. United States, 571 U. S. ___ (2014), the Sixth\nCircuit upheld the jury’s verdict. Burrage holds that “at\nleast where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is\nnot an independently sufficient cause of the victim’s\ndeath,” conviction is improper “unless such use is a but-for\ncause of the death or injury.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14–\n15). But-for causation exists where the controlled sub-\nstance “combines with other factors to produce” death, so\nlong as death would have not occurred “without the in-\ncremental effect” of the controlled substance. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 7). Because the Sixth Circuit did not focus on\nbut-for causation, I join the Court’s order to vacate and\nremand.\n   I write separately, however, to highlight the nature of\npetitioner’s burden going forward. Petitioner concedes\nthat even “[w]ithout having the benefit of this Court’s\nBurrage opinion, the district court nonetheless gave the\n2               VOLKMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\njury a ‘but-for’ causation instruction.” Pet. for Cert. 21.\nEven on petitioner’s theory, therefore, the question is\nwhether the Sixth Circuit should have “set aside the jury’s\nverdict on the ground of insufficient evidence.” Ibid. As\npetitioner acknowledges, this means that he can prevail\nonly by showing that no rational trier of fact could have\nfound, as the jury did here, “that death would not have\noccurred in these individuals but for the use of the oxyco-\ndone prescribed.” Ibid. (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443\nU. S. 307, 319 (1979)).\n   The jury reached its verdict after a 35-day trial. See 736\nF. 3d 1013, 1019 (CA6 2013). During that trial jurors\nlearned much about the deaths of petitioner’s patients.\nFor instance, petitioner prescribed one opiate (oxycodone)\nand two other drugs (diazepam and alprazolam) to Steven\nCraig Hieneman. Id., at 1027. Hieneman “died twelve\nhours” later and was “found dead with the very drugs the\ndoctor prescribed.” Id., at 1027–1028. The jury also heard\nfrom a deputy coroner that “Hieneman died an opiate-\ninduced death.” Id., at 1027. The question on remand is\nwhether evidence of this sort, if credited, would allow a\nrational jury to conclude that Hieneman would not have\ndied but for the oxycodone dispensed by petitioner. That\nsame question will have to be answered for each of peti-\ntioner’s patients.\n   In short, nothing in today’s order should be understood\nas suggesting that petitioner is entitled to acquittal.\nPetitioner’s convictions should be affirmed if the Sixth\nCircuit finds that the evidence from trial—“considered in\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution,” Jackson,\nsupra, at 319—shows that a rational jury could have found\nas this jury, in fact, did. The Court’s order, moreover, has\nno bearing on petitioner’s other convictions for conspiracy\nto unlawfully distribute a controlled substance, unlawful\ndistribution of a controlled substance, maintaining a drug-\ninvolved premises, and possession of a firearm in further-\nance of a drug-trafficking offense.\n</pre>", "id": 2743705, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/10/20/volkman_v._united_states.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 574 U.
