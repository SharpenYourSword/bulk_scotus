UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 14–29 Decided November 10, 2014\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE\nTHOMAS joins, respecting the denial of certiorari.\n   A court owes no deference to the prosecution’s interpre-\ntation of a criminal law. Criminal statutes “are for the\ncourts, not for the Government, to construe.” Abramski v.\nUnited States, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 21).\nThis case, a criminal prosecution under §10(b) of the Secu-\nrities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 491, as amended, 15\nU. S. C. 78j(b), raises a related question: Does a court\nowe deference to an executive agency’s interpretation of a\nlaw that contemplates both criminal and administrative\nenforcement?\n   The Second Circuit thought it does. It deferred to the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission’s interpretation of\n§10(b), see United States v. Royer, 549 F. 3d 886, 899\n(2008), and on that basis affirmed petitioner Douglas\nWhitman’s criminal conviction, see 555 Fed. Appx. 98, 107\n(2014) (citing Royer, supra, at 899). Its decision tilled no\nnew ground. Other Courts of Appeals have deferred to\nexecutive interpretations of a variety of laws that have\nboth criminal and administrative applications. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Flores, 404 F. 3d 320, 326–327 (CA5\n2005); United States v. Atandi, 376 F. 3d 1186, 1189\n(CA10 2004); NLRB v. Oklahoma Fixture Co., 332 F. 3d\n1284, 1286–1287 (CA10 2003); In re Sealed Case, 223 F. 3d\n775, 779 (CADC 2000); United States v. Kanchanalak, 192\nF. 3d 1037, 1047, and n. 17 (CADC 1999); National Rifle\n2               WHITMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Statement of SCALIA, J.\n\nAssn. v. Brady, 914 F. 2d 475, 479, n. 3 (CA4 1990).\n   I doubt the Government’s pretensions to deference.\nThey collide with the norm that legislatures, not executive\nofficers, define crimes. When King James I tried to create\nnew crimes by royal command, the judges responded that\n“the King cannot create any offence by his prohibition or\nproclamation, which was not an offence before.” Case of\nProclamations, 12 Co. Rep. 74, 75, 77 Eng. Rep. 1352,\n1353 (K. B. 1611). James I, however, did not have the\nbenefit of Chevron deference. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837\n(1984). With deference to agency interpretations of statu-\ntory provisions to which criminal prohibitions are at-\ntached, federal administrators can in effect create (and\nuncreate) new crimes at will, so long as they do not roam\nbeyond ambiguities that the laws contain. Undoubtedly\nCongress may make it a crime to violate a regulation, see\nUnited States v. Grimaud, 220 U. S. 506, 519 (1911), but it\nis quite a different matter for Congress to give agencies—\nlet alone for us to presume that Congress gave agencies—\npower to resolve ambiguities in criminal legislation, see\nCarter v. Welles-Bowen Realty, Inc., 736 F. 3d 722, 733\n(CA6 2013) (Sutton, J., concurring).\n   The Government’s theory that was accepted here would,\nin addition, upend ordinary principles of interpretation.\nThe rule of lenity requires interpreters to resolve ambi-\nguity in criminal laws in favor of defendants. Deferring to\nthe prosecuting branch’s expansive views of these statutes\n“would turn [their] normal construction . . . upside-down,\nreplacing the doctrine of lenity with a doctrine of severity.”\nCrandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 178 (1990)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\n   The best that one can say for the Government’s position\nis that in Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for\nGreat Ore., 515 U. S. 687 (1995), we deferred, with scarcely\nany explanation, to an agency’s interpretation of a law\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Statement of SCALIA, J.\n\nthat carried criminal penalties. We brushed the rule of\nlenity aside in a footnote, stating that “[w]e have never\nsuggested that the rule of lenity should provide the stand-\nard for reviewing facial challenges to administrative regu-\nlations.” Id., at 704, n. 18. That statement contradicts the\nmany cases before and since holding that, if a law has both\ncriminal and civil applications, the rule of lenity governs\nits interpretation in both settings. See, e.g., Leocal v.\nAshcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11–12, n. 8 (2004); United States v.\nThompson/Center Arms Co., 504 U. S. 505, 518, n. 10\n(1992) (plurality opinion); id., at 519 (SCALIA, J., concur-\nring in judgment). The footnote in Babbitt added that the\nregulation at issue was clear enough to fulfill the rule of\nlenity’s purpose of providing “fair warning” to would-be\nviolators. 515 U. S., at 704, n. 18. But that is not the only\nfunction performed by the rule of lenity; equally im-\nportant, it vindicates the principle that only the legislature\nmay define crimes and fix punishments. Congress cannot,\nthrough ambiguity, effectively leave that function to the\ncourts—much less to the administrative bureaucracy. See\nUnited States v. Wiltberger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95 (1820). Bab-\nbitt’s drive-by ruling, in short, deserves little weight.\n   Whitman does not seek review on the issue of deference,\nand the procedural history of the case in any event makes\nit a poor setting in which to reach the question. So I agree\nwith the Court that we should deny the petition. But\nwhen a petition properly presenting the question comes\nbefore us, I will be receptive to granting it.\n</pre>", "id": 2750100, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/11/10/whitman_v._united_states.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 574 U.
