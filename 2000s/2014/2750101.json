CITY OF SHELBY,\n\n                  MISSISSIPPI \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 13\u20131318. Decided November 10, 2014 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, worked as police\nofficers for the city of Shelby, Mississippi. They allege\nthat they were fired by the city\u2019s board of aldermen, not\nfor deficient performance, but because they brought to\nlight criminal activities of one of the aldermen. Charging\nviolations of their Fourteenth Amendment due process\nrights, they sought compensatory relief from the city.\nSummary judgment was entered against them in the\nDistrict Court, and affirmed on appeal, for failure to in-\nvoke 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 in their complaint.\n   We summarily reverse. Federal pleading rules call for\n\u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the\npleader is entitled to relief,\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2);\nthey do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for\nimperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the\nclaim asserted. See Advisory Committee Report of Octo-\nber 1955, reprinted in 12A C. Wright, A. Miller, M. Kane,\nR. Marcus, and A. Steinman, Federal Practice and Proce-\ndure, p. 644 (2014 ed.) (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\u201care designed to discourage battles over mere form of\nstatement\u201d); 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, \u00a71215, p. 172 (3d ed.\n2002) (Rule 8(a)(2) \u201cindicates that a basic objective of the\nrules is to avoid civil cases turning on technicalities\u201d). In\nparticular, no heightened pleading rule requires plaintiffs\nseeking damages for violations of constitutional rights to\ninvoke \u00a71983 expressly in order to state a claim. See\nLeatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and\n2               JOHNSON v. CITY OF SHELBY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nCoordination Unit, 507 U.

Sorema\nN. A., 534 U.

The requirement serves a notice function,\nthe Fifth Circuit said, because \u201c[c]ertain consequences\nflow from claims under \u00a71983, such as the unavailability\nof respondeat superior liability, which bears on the quali-\nfied immunity analysis.\u201d Ibid. This statement displays\nsome confusion in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s perception of peti-\ntioners\u2019 suit. No \u201cqualified immunity analysis\u201d is impli-\ncated here, as petitioners asserted a constitutional claim\nagainst the city only, not against any municipal officer.\nSee Owen v. Independence, 445 U. S. 622, 638 (1980) (a\n\u201cmunicipality may not assert the good faith of its officers\nor agents as a defense to liability under \u00a71983\u201d).\n   Our decisions in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550\nU. S. 544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662\n(2009), are not in point, for they concern the factual alle-\ngations a complaint must contain to survive a motion to\ndismiss. A plaintiff, they instruct, must plead facts suffi-\ncient to show that her claim has substantive plausibility.\nPetitioners\u2019 complaint was not deficient in that regard.\nPetitioners stated simply, concisely, and directly events\nthat, they alleged, entitled them to damages from the city.\nHaving informed the city of the factual basis for their\ncomplaint, they were required to do no more to stave off\nthreshold dismissal for want of an adequate statement\nof their claim.
