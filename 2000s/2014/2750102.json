ANDREW CARMAN, ET UX.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 14–212.   Decided November 10, 2014\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   On July 3, 2009, the Pennsylvania State Police Depart-\nment received a report that a man named Michael Zita\nhad stolen a car and two loaded handguns. The report\nalso said that Zita might have fled to the home of Andrew\nand Karen Carman. The department sent Officers Jeremy\nCarroll and Brian Roberts to the Carmans’ home to inves-\ntigate. Neither officer had been to the home before. 749\nF. 3d 192, 195 (CA3 2014).\n   The officers arrived in separate patrol cars around 2:30\np.m. The Carmans’ house sat on a corner lot—the front of\nthe house faced a main street while the left (as viewed\nfrom the front) faced a side street. The officers initially\ndrove to the front of the house, but after discovering that\nparking was not available there, turned right onto the side\nstreet. As they did so, they saw several cars parked side-\nby-side in a gravel parking area on the left side of the\nCarmans’ property. The officers parked in the “first avail-\nable spot,” at “the far rear of the property.” Ibid. (quoting\nTr. 70 (Apr. 8, 2013)).\n   The officers exited their patrol cars. As they looked\ntoward the house, the officers saw a small structure (ei-\nther a carport or a shed) with its door open and a light on.\nId., at 71. Thinking someone might be inside, Officer\nCarroll walked over, “poked [his] head” in, and said\n“Pennsylvania State Police.” 749 F. 3d, at 195 (quoting Tr.\n71 (Apr. 8, 2013); alteration in original). No one was\nthere, however, so the officers continued walking toward\nthe house. As they approached, they saw a sliding glass\n2                   CARROLL v. CARMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndoor that opened onto a ground-level deck. Carroll\nthought the sliding glass door “looked like a customary\nentryway,” so he and Officer Roberts decided to knock on\nit. 749 F. 3d, at 195 (quoting Tr. 83 (Apr. 8, 2013)).\n   As the officers stepped onto the deck, a man came out\nof the house and “belligerent[ly] and aggressively ap-\nproached” them. 749 F. 3d, at 195. The officers identified\nthemselves, explained they were looking for Michael Zita,\nand asked the man for his name. The man refused to\nanswer. Instead, he turned away from the officers and\nappeared to reach for his waist. Id., at 195–196. Carroll\ngrabbed the man’s right arm to make sure he was not\nreaching for a weapon. The man twisted away from Car-\nroll, lost his balance, and fell into the yard. Id., at 196.\n   At that point, a woman came out of the house and asked\nwhat was happening. The officers again explained that\nthey were looking for Zita. The woman then identified\nherself as Karen Carman, identified the man as her hus-\nband, Andrew Carman, and told the officers that Zita was\nnot there. In response, the officers asked for permission to\nsearch the house for Zita. Karen Carman consented, and\neveryone went inside. Ibid.\n   The officers searched the house, but did not find Zita.\nThey then left. The Carmans were not charged with any\ncrimes. Ibid.\n   The Carmans later sued Officer Carroll in Federal\nDistrict Court under 42 U. S. C. §1983. Among other\nthings, they alleged that Carroll unlawfully entered their\nproperty in violation of the Fourth Amendment when he\nwent into their backyard and onto their deck without a\nwarrant. 749 F. 3d, at 196.\n   At trial, Carroll argued that his entry was lawful under\nthe “knock and talk” exception to the warrant require-\nment. That exception, he contended, allows officers to\nknock on someone’s door, so long as they stay “on those\nportions of [the] property that the general public is al-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nlowed to go on.” Tr. 7 (Apr. 8, 2013). The Carmans re-\nsponded that a normal visitor would have gone to their\nfront door, rather than into their backyard or onto their\ndeck. Thus, they argued, the “knock and talk” exception\ndid not apply.\n  At the close of Carroll’s case in chief, the parties each\nmoved for judgment as a matter of law. The District Court\ndenied both motions, and sent the case to a jury. As rele-\nvant here, the District Court instructed the jury that the\n“knock and talk” exception “allows officers without a\nwarrant to knock on a resident’s door or otherwise ap-\nproach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants,\njust as any private citizen might.” Id., at 24 (Apr. 10,\n2013). The District Court further explained that “officers\nshould restrict their movements to walkways, driveways,\nporches and places where visitors could be expected to go.”\nIbid. The jury then returned a verdict for Carroll.\n  The Carmans appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit reversed in relevant part. The court held\nthat Officer Carroll violated the Fourth Amendment as a\nmatter of law because the “knock and talk” exception\n“requires that police officers begin their encounter at the\nfront door, where they have an implied invitation to go.”\n749 F. 3d, at 199. The court also held that Carroll was not\nentitled to qualified immunity because his actions violated\nclearly established law. Ibid. The court therefore re-\nversed the District Court and held that the Carmans were\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  Carroll petitioned for certiorari. We grant the petition\nand reverse the Third Circuit’s determination that Carroll\nwas not entitled to qualified immunity.\n  A government official sued under §1983 is entitled to\nqualified immunity unless the official violated a statutory\nor constitutional right that was clearly established at the\ntime of the challenged conduct. See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3). A right is clearly\n4                    CARROLL v. CARMAN\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nestablished only if its contours are sufficiently clear that\n“a reasonable official would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that right.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483\nU. S. 635, 640 (1987). In other words, “existing precedent\nmust have placed the statutory or constitutional question\nbeyond debate.” al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\nThis doctrine “gives government officials breathing room\nto make reasonable but mistaken judgments,” and “pro-\ntects ‘all but the plainly incompetent or those who know-\ningly violate the law.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986)).\n   Here the Third Circuit cited only a single case to sup-\nport its decision that Carroll was not entitled to qualified\nimmunity—Estate of Smith v. Marasco, 318 F. 3d 497\n(CA3 2003). Assuming for the sake of argument that a\ncontrolling circuit precedent could constitute clearly estab-\nlished federal law in these circumstances, see Reichle v.\nHowards, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7), Marasco\ndoes not clearly establish that Carroll violated the Car-\nmans’ Fourth Amendment rights.\n   In Marasco, two police officers went to Robert Smith’s\nhouse and knocked on the front door. When Smith did not\nrespond, the officers went into the backyard, and at least\none entered the garage. 318 F. 3d, at 519. The court\nacknowledged that the officers’ “entry into the curtilage\nafter not receiving an answer at the front door might be\nreasonable.” Id., at 520. It held, however, that the Dis-\ntrict Court had not made the factual findings needed to\ndecide that issue. Id., at 521. For example, the Third\nCircuit noted that the record “did not discuss the layout of\nthe property or the position of the officers on that prop-\nerty,” and that “there [was] no indication of whether the\nofficers followed a path or other apparently open route\nthat would be suggestive of reasonableness.” Ibid. The\ncourt therefore remanded the case for further proceedings.\n   In concluding that Officer Carroll violated clearly estab-\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlished law in this case, the Third Circuit relied exclusively\non Marasco’s statement that “entry into the curtilage after\nnot receiving an answer at the front door might be reason-\nable.” Id., at 520; see 749 F. 3d, at 199 (quoting Marasco,\nsupra, at 520). In the court’s view, that statement clearly\nestablished that a “knock and talk” must begin at the\nfront door. But that conclusion does not follow. Marasco\nheld that an unsuccessful “knock and talk” at the front\ndoor does not automatically allow officers to go onto other\nparts of the property. It did not hold, however, that\nknocking on the front door is required before officers go\nonto other parts of the property that are open to visitors.\nThus, Marasco simply did not answer the question whether\na “knock and talk” must begin at the front door when\nvisitors may also go to the back door. Indeed, the house at\nissue seems not to have even had a back door, let alone\none that visitors could use. 318 F. 3d, at 521.\n   Moreover, Marasco expressly stated that “there [was] no\nindication of whether the officers followed a path or other\napparently open route that would be suggestive of reason-\nableness.” Ibid. That makes Marasco wholly different\nfrom this case, where the jury necessarily decided that\nCarroll “restrict[ed] [his] movements to walkways, drive-\nways, porches and places where visitors could be expected\nto go.” Tr. 24 (Apr. 10, 2013).\n   To the extent that Marasco says anything about this\ncase, it arguably supports Carroll’s view. In Marasco, the\nThird Circuit noted that “[o]fficers are allowed to knock on\na residence’s door or otherwise approach the residence\nseeking to speak to the inhabitants just as any private\ncitizen may.” 318 F. 3d, at 519. The court also said that,\n“ ‘when the police come on to private property . . . and\nrestrict their movements to places visitors could be ex-\npected to go (e.g., walkways, driveways, porches), observa-\ntions made from such vantage points are not covered by\nthe Fourth Amendment.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 1 W. LaFave,\n6                       CARROLL v. CARMAN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nSearch and Seizure §2.3(f ) (3d ed. 1996 and Supp. 2003)\n(footnotes omitted)). Had Carroll read those statements\nbefore going to the Carmans’ house, he may have concluded—\nquite reasonably—that he was allowed to knock on any\ndoor that was open to visitors.*\n   The Third Circuit’s decision is even more perplexing in\ncomparison to the decisions of other federal and state\ncourts, which have rejected the rule the Third Circuit\nadopted here. For example, in United States v. Titemore,\n437 F. 3d 251 (CA2 2006), a police officer approached a\nhouse that had two doors. The first was a traditional door\nthat opened onto a driveway; the second was a sliding\nglass door that opened onto a small porch. The officer\nchose to knock on the latter. Id., at 253–254. On appeal,\nthe defendant argued that the officer had unlawfully\nentered his property without a warrant in violation of the\nFourth Amendment. Id., at 255–256. But the Second\nCircuit rejected that argument. As the court explained,\nthe sliding glass door was “a primary entrance visible to\nand used by the public.” Id., at 259. Thus, “[b]ecause [the\nofficer] approached a principal entrance to the home using\na route that other visitors could be expected to take,” the\ncourt held that he did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nId., at 252.\n   The Seventh Circuit’s decision in United States v.\nJames, 40 F. 3d 850 (1994), vacated on other grounds, 516\nU. S. 1022 (1995), provides another example. There, police\n——————\n  * In a footnote, the Court of Appeals “recognize[d] that there may be\nsome instances in which the front door is not the entrance used by\nvisitors,” but noted that “this is not one such instance.” 749 F. 3d 192,\n198, n. 6 (2014) (emphasis added). This footnote still reflects the Third\nCircuit’s view that the “knock and talk” exception is available for only\none entrance to a dwelling, “which in most circumstances is the front\ndoor.” Id., at 198. Cf. United States v. Perea-Rey, 680 F. 3d 1179, 1188\n(CA9 2012) (“Officers conducting a knock and talk . . . need not ap-\nproach only a specific door if there are multiple doors accessible to the\npublic.”).\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nofficers approached a duplex with multiple entrances.\nBypassing the front door, the officers “used a paved walk-\nway along the side of the duplex leading to the rear side\ndoor.” 40 F. 3d, at 862. On appeal, the defendant argued\nthat the officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights\nwhen they went to the rear side door. The Seventh Circuit\nrejected that argument, explaining that the rear side door\nwas “accessible to the general public” and “was commonly\nused for entering the duplex from the nearby alley.” Ibid.\nIn situations “where the back door of a residence is readily\naccessible to the general public,” the court held, “the\nFourth Amendment is not implicated when police officers\napproach that door in the reasonable belief that it is a\nprincipal means of access to the dwelling.” Ibid. See also,\ne.g., United States v. Garcia, 997 F. 2d 1273, 1279–1280\n(CA9 1993) (“If the front and back of a residence are read-\nily accessible from a public place, like the driveway and\nparking area here, the Fourth Amendment is not implicated\nwhen officers go to the back door reasonably believing it\nis used as a principal entrance to the dwelling”); State v.\nDomicz, 188 N. J. 285, 302, 907 A. 2d 395, 405 (2006)\n(“when a law enforcement officer walks to a front or back\ndoor for the purpose of making contact with a resident and\nreasonably believes that the door is used by visitors, he is\nnot unconstitutionally trespassing on to the property”).\n   We do not decide today whether those cases were cor-\nrectly decided or whether a police officer may conduct a\n“knock and talk” at any entrance that is open to visitors\nrather than only the front door. “But whether or not the\nconstitutional rule applied by the court below was correct,\nit was not ‘beyond debate.’ ” Stanton v. Sims, 571 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8) (quoting al-\nKidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9)). The Third Circuit\ntherefore erred when it held that Carroll was not entitled\nto qualified immunity.\n   The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of\n8                   CARROLL v. CARMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 2750102, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/11/10/carroll_v._carman.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 574 U.

Indeed, the house at\nissue seems not to have even had a back door, let alone\none that visitors could use. 318 F. 3d, at 521.\n   Moreover, Marasco expressly stated that “there [was] no\nindication of whether the officers followed a path or other\napparently open route that would be suggestive of reason-\nableness.” Ibid. That makes Marasco wholly different\nfrom this case, where the jury necessarily decided that\nCarroll “restrict[ed] [his] movements to walkways, drive-\nways, porches and places where visitors could be expected\nto go.” Tr. 24 (Apr. 10, 2013).\n   To the extent that Marasco says anything about this\ncase, it arguably supports Carroll’s view. In Marasco, the\nThird Circuit noted that “[o]fficers are allowed to knock on\na residence’s door or otherwise approach the residence\nseeking to speak to the inhabitants just as any private\ncitizen may.” 318 F. 3d, at 519. The court also said that,\n“ ‘when the police come on to private property . . . and\nrestrict their movements to places visitors could be ex-\npected to go (e.g., walkways, driveways, porches), observa-\ntions made from such vantage points are not covered by\nthe Fourth Amendment.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 1 W. LaFave,\n6                       CARROLL v. CARMAN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nSearch and Seizure §2.3(f ) (3d ed. 1996 and Supp. 2003)\n(footnotes omitted)). Had Carroll read those statements\nbefore going to the Carmans’ house, he may have concluded—\nquite reasonably—that he was allowed to knock on any\ndoor that was open to visitors.*\n   The Third Circuit’s decision is even more perplexing in\ncomparison to the decisions of other federal and state\ncourts, which have rejected the rule the Third Circuit\nadopted here. For example, in United States v. Titemore,\n437 F. 3d 251 (CA2 2006), a police officer approached a\nhouse that had two doors. The first was a traditional door\nthat opened onto a driveway; the second was a sliding\nglass door that opened onto a small porch. The officer\nchose to knock on the latter. Id., at 253–254. On appeal,\nthe defendant argued that the officer had unlawfully\nentered his property without a warrant in violation of the\nFourth Amendment. Id., at 255–256. But the Second\nCircuit rejected that argument. As the court explained,\nthe sliding glass door was “a primary entrance visible to\nand used by the public.” Id., at 259. Thus, “[b]ecause [the\nofficer] approached a principal entrance to the home using\na route that other visitors could be expected to take,” the\ncourt held that he did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nId., at 252.\n   The Seventh Circuit’s decision in United States v.\nJames, 40 F. 3d 850 (1994), vacated on other grounds, 516\nU. S. 1022 (1995), provides another example. There, police\n——————\n  * In a footnote, the Court of Appeals “recognize[d] that there may be\nsome instances in which the front door is not the entrance used by\nvisitors,” but noted that “this is not one such instance.” 749 F. 3d 192,\n198, n. 6 (2014) (emphasis added). This footnote still reflects the Third\nCircuit’s view that the “knock and talk” exception is available for only\none entrance to a dwelling, “which in most circumstances is the front\ndoor.” Id., at 198. Cf. United States v. Perea-Rey, 680 F. 3d 1179, 1188\n(CA9 2012) (“Officers conducting a knock and talk . . . need not ap-\nproach only a specific door if there are multiple doors accessible to the\npublic.”).\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nofficers approached a duplex with multiple entrances.\nBypassing the front door, the officers “used a paved walk-\nway along the side of the duplex leading to the rear side\ndoor.” 40 F. 3d, at 862. On appeal, the defendant argued\nthat the officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights\nwhen they went to the rear side door. The Seventh Circuit\nrejected that argument, explaining that the rear side door\nwas “accessible to the general public” and “was commonly\nused for entering the duplex from the nearby alley.” Ibid.\nIn situations “where the back door of a residence is readily\naccessible to the general public,” the court held, “the\nFourth Amendment is not implicated when police officers\napproach that door in the reasonable belief that it is a\nprincipal means of access to the dwelling.” Ibid. See also,\ne.g., United States v. Garcia, 997 F. 2d 1273, 1279–1280\n(CA9 1993) (“If the front and back of a residence are read-\nily accessible from a public place, like the driveway and\nparking area here, the Fourth Amendment is not implicated\nwhen officers go to the back door reasonably believing it\nis used as a principal entrance to the dwelling”); State v.\nDomicz, 188 N. J. 285, 302, 907 A. 2d 395, 405 (2006)\n(“when a law enforcement officer walks to a front or back\ndoor for the purpose of making contact with a resident and\nreasonably believes that the door is used by visitors, he is\nnot unconstitutionally trespassing on to the property”).\n   We do not decide today whether those cases were cor-\nrectly decided or whether a police officer may conduct a\n“knock and talk” at any entrance that is open to visitors\nrather than only the front door. “But whether or not the\nconstitutional rule applied by the court below was correct,\nit was not ‘beyond debate.’ ” Stanton v. Sims, 571 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8) (quoting al-\nKidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9)).
