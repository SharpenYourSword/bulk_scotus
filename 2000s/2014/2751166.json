The order\nheretofore entered by JUSTICE KENNEDY is vacated.\n   Statement of JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE\nSCALIA joins, respecting the denial of the application for a\nstay.\n   Petitioner asks us to stay a judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit holding\nunconstitutional an amendment to the Arizona Constitu-\ntion that the State’s citizens approved overwhelmingly in\na referendum eight years ago. I join my colleagues in\ndenying this application only because there appears to be\nno “reasonable probability that four Justices will consider\nthe issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari.”\nHollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U. S. 183, 190 (2010) (per\ncuriam). That is unfortunate.\n   We have recognized a strong presumption in favor of\ngranting writs of certiorari to review decisions of lower\ncourts holding federal statutes unconstitutional. See\nUnited States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 327 (1998);\nUnited States v. Gainey, 380 U. S. 63, 65 (1965). States\ndeserve no less consideration. See Janklow v.

See, e.g., Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U. S.\n___ (2013); Cook v. Gralike, 531 U. S. 510 (2001); Saenz v.\nRoe, 526 U. S. 489 (1999); Renne v. Geary, 501 U. S. 312\n(1991); Massachusetts v. Oakes, 491 U. S. 576 (1989). But\nfor reasons that escape me, we have not done so with any\nconsistency, especially in recent months. See, e.g., Herbert\nv. Kitchen, ante, p. ___; Smith v.

At the very least, we\nowe the people of Arizona the respect of our review before\nwe let stand a decision facially invalidating a state consti-\ntutional amendment.\n  Of course, the Court has yet to act on a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari in this matter, and I hope my prediction\nabout whether that petition will be granted proves wrong.\nOur recent practice, however, gives me little reason to be\noptimistic.\n</pre>", "id": 2751166, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/11/13/maricopa_county_v._lopez-valenzuela.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 574 U.
