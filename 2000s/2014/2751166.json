I join my colleagues in\ndenying this application only because there appears to be\nno \u201creasonable probability that four Justices will consider\nthe issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari.\u201d\nHollingsworth v.

See\nUnited States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 327 (1998);\nUnited States v. Gainey, 380 U. S. 63, 65 (1965). States\ndeserve no less consideration. See Janklow v.

Oakes, 491 U. S. 576 (1989). But\nfor reasons that escape me, we have not done so with any\nconsistency, especially in recent months. See, e.g., Herbert\nv. Kitchen, ante, p. ___; Smith v.

At the very least, we\nowe the people of Arizona the respect of our review before\nwe let stand a decision facially invalidating a state consti-\ntutional amendment.\n  Of course, the Court has yet to act on a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari in this matter, and I hope my prediction\nabout whether that petition will be granted proves wrong.\nOur recent practice, however, gives me little reason to be\noptimistic.\n",
