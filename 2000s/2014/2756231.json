Decided December 1, 2014\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE\nBREYER joins, respecting the denial of certiorari.\n   Seventeen years after petitioner was first sentenced to\ndeath, and more than four years after his conviction and\nsentence were affirmed on direct appeal, petitioner has not\nreceived counsel to represent him in his state habeas\ncorpus proceedings\u2014counsel to which he is entitled as a\nmatter of state law. See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a768662\n(West 2009). He has suffered this delay notwithstanding\nthe California Supreme Court\u2019s observation that \u201c[i]deally,\nthe appointment of habeas corpus counsel should occur\nshortly after an indigent defendant\u2019s judgment of death,\u201d\nIn re Morgan, 50 Cal. 4th 932, 937, 237 P. 3d 993, 996\n(2010), and our own general exhortation that \u201c[f]inality is\nessential to both the retributive and the deterrent func-\ntions of criminal law,\u201d Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S.\n538, 555 (1998). At the same time, the California Su-\npreme Court refuses to consider capital inmates\u2019 pro se\nsubmissions relating to matters for which they have a\ncontinuing right to representation. See In re Barnett, 31\nCal. 4th 466, 476\u2013477, 73 P. 3d 1106, 1113\u20131114 (2003).\nPetitioner therefore remains in limbo: To raise any claims\nchallenging his conviction and sentence in state habeas\nproceedings, he must either waive his right to counsel or\ncontinue to wait for counsel to be finally appointed.\n   Although these circumstances are undoubtedly trou-\nbling, I vote to deny the petition for certiorari because it is\n2                   REDD v. CHAPPELL\n\n                  Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nnot clear that petitioner has been denied all access to the\ncourts. In fact, a number of alternative avenues may\nremain open to him. He may, for example, seek appoint-\nment of counsel for his federal habeas proceedings. See 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73599(a)(2). And he may argue that he should not\nbe required to exhaust any claims that he might otherwise\nbring in state habeas proceedings, as \u201ccircumstances exist\nthat render [the state corrective] process ineffective to\nprotect\u201d his rights. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(b)(1)(B)(ii). More-\nover, petitioner might seek to bring a 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983\nsuit contending that the State\u2019s failure to provide him\nwith the counsel to which he is entitled violates the Due\nProcess Clause. Our denial of certiorari reflects in no way\non the merits of these possible arguments. Finally, I also\nnote that the State represents that state habeas counsel\nwill be appointed for petitioner \u201c[i]n due course\u201d\u2014by\nwhich I hope it means, soon.
