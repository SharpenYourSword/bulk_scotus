SHAUERS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 13–517.      Argued October 8, 2014—Decided December 9, 2014\nPetitioner Gregory Warger sued respondent Randy Shauers in federal\n  court for negligence for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident.\n  After the jury returned a verdict for Shauers, one of the jurors con-\n  tacted Warger’s counsel, claiming that Regina Whipple, the jury fore-\n  person, had revealed during deliberations that her daughter had\n  been at fault in a fatal motor vehicle accident, and that a lawsuit\n  would have ruined her daughter’s life. Armed with an affidavit from\n  the juror, Warger moved for a new trial, arguing that Whipple had\n  deliberately lied during voir dire about her impartiality and ability to\n  award damages. The District Court denied Warger’s motion, holding\n  that Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b), which bars evidence “about any\n  statement made . . . during the jury’s deliberations,” barred the affi-\n  davit, and that none of the Rule’s three exceptions, see Rule\n  606(b)(2), were applicable. The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Rule 606(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in\n which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror\n lied during voir dire. Pp. 3–10.\n       (a) This reading accords with the plain meaning of Rule 606(b),\n which applies to “an inquiry into the validity of [the] verdict.” This\n understanding is also consistent with the underlying common-law\n rule on which Congress based Rule 606(b). The so-called “federal\n rule” made jury deliberations evidence inadmissible even if used to\n demonstrate dishonesty during voir dire. Both the majority of courts\n and this Court’s pre-Rule606(b) cases, see McDonald v. Pless, 238\n U. S. 264, 268; Clark v. United States, 289 U. S. 1, favored this rule\n over the “Iowa rule,” which permitted the use of such jury delibera-\n tions evidence. The federal approach is clearly reflected in the lan-\n2                          WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    guage Congress chose when it enacted Rule 606(b), and legislative\n    history confirms that Congress’ choice was no accident. See Tanner\n    v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 125. Pp. 3–8.\n          (b) Warger’s arguments against this straightforward understand-\n    ing are not persuasive. Pp. 8–10.\n            (1) First, Warger insists that proceedings for a new trial based\n    on voir dire dishonesty do not involve an “inquiry into the validity of\n    the verdict.” His reading would restrict Rule 606(b)’s application to\n    claims of error for which a court must examine the manner in which\n    the jury reached its verdict, but the Rule does not focus on the means\n    by which deliberations evidence might be used to invalidate a verdict.\n    It simply applies during a proceeding in which a verdict may be ren-\n    dered invalid. Pp. 8–9.\n            (2) Warger also contends that excluding jury deliberations evi-\n    dence that shows voir dire dishonesty is unnecessary to fulfill Con-\n    gress’ objectives, but his arguments would apply to all evidence ren-\n    dered inadmissible by Rule 606(b), and he cannot escape the scope of\n    the Rule merely by asserting that Congress’ concerns were misplaced.\n    P. 9.\n            (3) Finally, Warger invokes the canon of constitutional avoid-\n    ance, contending that only his interpretation protects the right to an\n    impartial jury. But that canon has no application here, where there\n    is no ambiguity. See United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Co-\n    operative, 532 U. S. 483, 494. Moreover, this Court’s Tanner decision\n    forecloses any claim that Rule 606(b) is unconstitutional. Similar to\n    the right at issue in that case, Warger’s right to an impartial jury\n    remains protected despite Rule 606(b)’s removal of one means of en-\n    suring unbiased jurors. Even if a juror lies to conceal bias, parties\n    may bring to the court’s attention evidence of bias before the verdict\n    is rendered and use nonjuror evidence after the verdict is rendered.\n    Pp. 9–10.\n       2. The affidavit at issue was not admissible under Rule\n    606(b)(2)(A)’s exception for evidence of “extraneous prejudicial infor-\n    mation.” Generally speaking, extraneous information derives from a\n    source “external” to the jury. See Tanner, 483 U. S., at 117. Here,\n    the excluded affidavit falls on the “internal” side. Warger contends\n    that any information Whipple shared with the other jurors was ex-\n    traneous because she would have been disqualified from the jury had\n    she disclosed her daughter’s accident. However, such an exception\n    would swallow up much of the rest of the restrictive version of the\n    common-law rule that Congress adopted in enacting Rule 606(b).\n    Pp. 11–13.\n721 F. 3d 606, affirmed.\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                       Cite as: 574 U.

WARGER, PETITIONER v. RANDY D.\n\n                 SHAUERS\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [December 9, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) provides that certain\njuror testimony regarding what occurred in a jury room is\ninadmissible “[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of a\nverdict.” The question presented in this case is whether\nRule 606(b) precludes a party seeking a new trial from\nusing one juror’s affidavit of what another juror said in\ndeliberations to demonstrate the other juror’s dishonesty\nduring voir dire. We hold that it does.\n                              I\n  Petitioner Gregory Warger was riding his motorcycle on\na highway outside Rapid City, South Dakota, when a\ntruck driven by respondent Randy Shauers struck him\nfrom behind. Warger claims he was stopped at the time of\nthe accident, while Shauers claims that Warger suddenly\npulled out in front of him. Regardless of the cause of the\naccident, no one disputes its tragic result: Warger sus-\ntained serious injuries that ultimately required the ampu-\ntation of his left leg.\n  Warger sued Shauers for negligence in Federal District\nCourt. During jury selection, counsel for both parties\n2                  WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconducted lengthy voir dire of the prospective jurors.\nWarger’s counsel asked whether any jurors would be\nunable to award damages for pain and suffering or for\nfuture medical expenses, or whether there was any juror\nwho thought, “I don’t think I could be a fair and impartial\njuror on this kind of case.” App. 105. Prospective juror\nRegina Whipple, who was later selected as the jury fore-\nperson, answered no to each of these questions. See id., at\n83, 89, 105.\n  Trial commenced, and the jury ultimately returned a\nverdict in favor of Shauers. Shortly thereafter, one of the\njurors contacted Warger’s counsel to express concern over\njuror Whipple’s conduct. The complaining juror subse-\nquently signed an affidavit claiming that Whipple had\nspoken during deliberations about “a motor vehicle colli-\nsion in which her daughter was at fault for the collision\nand a man died,” and had “related that if her daughter\nhad been sued, it would have ruined her life.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 40a–41a.\n  Relying on this affidavit, Warger moved for a new trial.\nHe contended that Whipple had deliberately lied during\nvoir dire about her impartiality and ability to award dam-\nages. Thus, he asserted, he had satisfied the requirements\nof McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464\nU. S. 548 (1984), which holds that a party may “obtain a\nnew trial” if he “demonstrate[s] that a juror failed to an-\nswer honestly a material question on voir dire, and . . .\nthat a correct response would have provided a valid basis\nfor a challenge for cause.” Id., at 556.\n  The District Court refused to grant a new trial, holding\nthat the only evidence that supported Warger’s motion,\nthe complaining juror’s affidavit, was barred by Federal\nRule of Evidence 606(b). As relevant here, that Rule\nprovides that “[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of a\nverdict,” evidence “about any statement made or incident\nthat occurred during the jury’s deliberations” is inadmis-\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsible. Rule 606(b)(1). The Rule contains three specific\nexceptions—allowing testimony “about whether (A) extra-\nneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to\nthe jury’s attention; (B) an outside influence was improp-\nerly brought to bear on any juror; or (C) a mistake was\nmade in entering the verdict on the verdict form,” Rule\n606(b)(2)—but the District Court found none of these\nexceptions to be applicable.\n   The Eighth Circuit affirmed. 721 F. 3d 606 (2013). It\nfirst held that Warger’s proffered evidence did not fall\nwithin the “extraneous prejudicial evidence” exception set\nforth in Rule 606(b)(2)(A). The court explained that\n“[j]urors’ personal experiences do not constitute extrane-\nous information; it is unavoidable they will bring such\ninnate experiences into the jury room.” Id., at 611. Next,\nthe court rejected Warger’s alternative argument that\nRule 606(b) is wholly inapplicable when a litigant offers\nevidence to show that a juror was dishonest during voir\ndire. Acknowledging that there was a split among the\nFederal Courts of Appeals on this question, the Eighth\nCircuit joined those Circuits that had held that Rule\n606(b) applies to any proceeding in which the jury’s verdict\nmight be invalidated, including efforts to demonstrate that\na juror lied during voir dire. Compare id., at 611–612\n(citing Williams v. Price, 343 F. 3d 223, 235–237 (CA3\n2003), and United States v. Benally, 546 F. 3d 1230, 1235\n(CA10 2008)), with Hard v. Burlington N. R. Co., 812 F. 2d\n482, 485 (CA9 1987) (“Statements which tend to show\ndeceit during voir dire are not barred by [Rule 606(b)]”),\nand Maldonado v. Missouri P. R. Co., 798 F. 2d 764, 770\n(CA5 1986) (same).\n   We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\naffirm.\n                         II\n  We hold that Rule 606(b) applies to juror testimony\n4                   WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nduring a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a\nnew trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.\nIn doing so, we simply accord Rule 606(b)’s terms their\nplain meaning. The Rule, after all, applies “[d]uring an\ninquiry into the validity of a verdict.” Rule 606(b)(1). A\npostverdict motion for a new trial on the ground of\nvoir dire dishonesty plainly entails “an inquiry into the\nvalidity of [the] verdict”: If a juror was dishonest during\nvoir dire and an honest response would have provided a\nvalid basis to challenge that juror for cause, the verdict\nmust be invalidated. See McDonough, 464 U. S., at 556.\n    This understanding of the text of Rule 606(b) is con-\nsistent with the underlying common-law rule on which it\nwas based. Although some common-law courts would\nhave permitted evidence of jury deliberations to be intro-\nduced to demonstrate juror dishonesty during voir dire,\nthe majority would not, and the language of Rule 606(b)\nreflects Congress’ enactment of the more restrictive ver-\nsion of the common-law rule.\n    Rule 606(b) had its genesis in Vaise v. Delaval, 1 T. R.\n11, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K. B. 1785), in which Lord Mansfield\nheld inadmissible an affidavit from two jurors claiming\nthat the jury had decided the case through a game of\nchance. See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2352, p. 696 (J.\nMcNaughton rev. 1961). The rule soon took root in the\nUnited States, id., at 696–697, where it was viewed as\nboth promoting the finality of verdicts and insulating the\njury from outside influences, see McDonald v. Pless, 238\nU. S. 264, 267–268 (1915).\n    Some versions of the rule were narrower than others.\nUnder what was sometimes known as the “Iowa” ap-\nproach, juror testimony regarding deliberations was ex-\ncluded only to the extent that it related to matters that\n“ ‘inhere[d] in the verdict,’ ” which generally consisted of\nevidence of the jurors’ subjective intentions and thought\nprocesses in reaching a verdict. 3 C.

Under this version, sometimes called\nthe “federal” approach, litigants were prohibited from\nusing evidence of jury deliberations unless it was offered\nto show that an “extraneous matter” had influenced the\njury. See 3 Mueller & Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence\n§6:16, at 71; Rules of Evidence for United States Courts\nand Magistrates, 56 F. R. D. 183, 265 (1973).

Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1866), in which the Iowa Supreme Court held that a trial\ncourt considering a motion for a new trial should have accepted the\naffidavits of four jurors who claimed that their damages verdict had\nbeen determined by taking the average of the sums each juror thought\nproper (a “quotient” verdict). Id., at 212–213. The Wright court rea-\nsoned that, unlike evidence of a juror’s subjective intentions in reaching\na verdict, whether the verdict had been obtained in this fashion was an\n“independent fact” and thus could and should be proved by any avail-\nable evidence. Id., at 211.\n6                   WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave suggested a preference for the Iowa rule. See Hyde\nv. United States, 225 U. S. 347, 383–384 (1912) (“[W]e\nthink the rule expressed in Wright v. Illinois & Miss. Tel.\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [1866], . . . should apply, that the testi-\nmony of jurors should not be received to show matters\nwhich essentially inhere in the verdict itself and neces-\nsarily depend upon the testimony of the jurors and can\nreceive no corroboration”); Mattox v. United States, 146\nU. S. 140, 148–149 (1892) (quoting at length a Kansas\nSupreme Court decision setting out the Iowa test). But to\nthe extent that these decisions created any question as to\nwhich approach this Court followed, McDonald v. Pless\nlargely settled matters. There, we held that juror affida-\nvits were not admissible to show that jurors had entered a\n“quotient” verdict, precisely the opposite of the result\nreached by the Iowa Supreme Court in its decision estab-\nlishing the Iowa approach. Compare 238 U. S., at 265,\n268, with Wright v. Illinois & Miss. Tel. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n211–212 (1866). In doing so, we observed that although\ndecisions in a few States made admissible a “juror’s affi-\ndavit as to an overt act of misconduct, which was capable\nof being controverted by other jurors,” the argument in\nfavor of that approach (i.e., the Iowa rule) had not been\ngenerally accepted, because permitting such evidence\n“would open the door to the most pernicious arts and\ntampering with jurors.” 238 U. S., at 268 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   Our subsequent decision in Clark v. United States, 289\nU. S. 1 (1933), was consistent with our apparent rejection\nof the Iowa approach. In Clark, the Government had\nprosecuted for contempt a juror who, during voir dire in a\nprior case, had falsely denied knowing the defendant. Id.,\nat 6–8. We held that the prosecution could introduce\nevidence of what had occurred during deliberations in the\nprior case, rejecting the juror’s argument that these com-\nmunications were privileged. We were careful to explain,\n                    Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever, that nothing in our decision was “at variance\nwith the rule . . . that the testimony of a juror is not ad-\nmissible for the impeachment of his verdict.” Id., at 18.\nThis was because the verdict in the original case was not\nat issue, and therefore “the rule against impeachment\n[was] wholly unrelated to the problem . . . before us.”\nIbid.; accord, McDonald, 238 U. S., at 269. Clark thus\nclarified that the rule against jurors’ impeaching their\nverdicts applies only in a proceeding actually impeaching\nthat verdict—precisely the line Rule 606(b) draws when it\nrefers to an “inquiry into the validity of a verdict.”\n   In any event, these decisions predated Congress’ enact-\nment of Rule 606(b), and Congress was undoubtedly free\nto prescribe a broader version of the anti-impeachment\nrule than we had previously applied. The language of the\nRule it adopted clearly reflects the federal approach: As\nenacted, Rule 606(b) prohibited the use of any evidence of\njuror deliberations, subject only to the express exceptions\nfor extraneous information and outside influences.2\n   For those who consider legislative history relevant, here\nit confirms that this choice of language was no accident.\nCongress rejected a prior version of the Rule that, in ac-\ncordance with the Iowa approach, would have prohibited\njuror testimony only as to the “effect of anything upon . . .\n[any] juror’s mind or emotions . . . or concerning his men-\ntal processes.” Committee on Rules of Practice and Proce-\ndure of the Judicial Conference of the United States,\nRevised Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United\nStates Courts and Magistrates, 51 F. R. D. 315, 387\n(1971); see Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 123–\n125 (1987) (detailing the legislative history of the Rule).\nThus Congress “specifically understood, considered, and\nrejected a version of Rule 606(b)” that would have likely\n——————\n  2 The additional exception for mistakes made in entering the verdict\n\non the verdict form was adopted in 2006.

SHAUERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npermitted the introduction of evidence of deliberations to\nshow dishonesty during voir dire. Id., at 125.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n   Seeking to rebut this straightforward understanding of\nRule 606(b), Warger first insists that the proceedings that\nfollow a motion for new trial based on dishonesty during\nvoir dire do not involve an “inquiry into the validity of the\nverdict.” His argument is as follows: Under McDonough, a\nparty moving for a new trial on the basis of voir dire dis-\nhonesty need not show that this dishonesty had an effect\non the verdict. See 464 U. S., at 556. Although a success-\nful claim will result in vacatur of the judgment, vacatur is\nsimply the remedy for the McDonough error, just as it may\nbe the remedy for a variety of errors that have nothing to\ndo with the manner in which the jury reached its verdict.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Davila, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 12) (listing certain “ ‘structural’ ” errors war-\nranting “automatic reversal” of a criminal conviction).\nTherefore, Warger asserts, the “inquiry begins and ends\nwith what happened during voir dire.” Brief for Petitioner\n19–20.\n   We are not persuaded. Warger, it seems, would restrict\nRule 606(b)’s application to those claims of error for which\na court must examine the manner in which the jury\nreached its verdict—claims, one might say, involving an\ninquiry into the jury’s verdict. But the “inquiry” to which\nthe Rule refers is one into the “validity of the verdict,” not\ninto the verdict itself. The Rule does not focus on the\nmeans by which deliberations evidence might be used to\ninvalidate a verdict. It does not say “during an inquiry\ninto jury deliberations,” or prohibit the introduction of\nevidence of deliberations “for use in determining whether\nan asserted error affected the jury’s verdict.” It simply\napplies “[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of the ver-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndict”—that is, during a proceeding in which the verdict\nmay be rendered invalid. Whether or not a juror’s alleged\nmisconduct during voir dire had a direct effect on the\njury’s verdict, the motion for a new trial requires a court to\ndetermine whether the verdict can stand.\n                             B\n   Next, Warger contends that excluding jury deliberations\nevidence tending to show that a juror lied during voir dire\nis unnecessary to fulfill Congress’ apparent objectives of\nencouraging full and open debate in the jury room and\npreventing the harassment of former jurors. He observes\nthat jurors remain free to, and may sometimes be forced\nto, disclose what happened in the jury room, and that\nethical rules limit the ability of parties to harass jurors\nfollowing trial. But these are arguments against Rule\n606(b) generally, not arguments for the particular excep-\ntion to the Rule that Warger seeks. Congress’ enactment\nof Rule 606(b) was premised on the concerns that the use\nof deliberations evidence to challenge verdicts would\nrepresent a threat to both jurors and finality in those\ncircumstances not covered by the Rule’s express excep-\ntions. Warger cannot escape the scope of the Rule Con-\ngress adopted simply by asserting that its concerns were\nmisplaced.\n                             C\n  Nor do we accept Warger’s contention that we must\nadopt his interpretation of Rule 606(b) so as to avoid\nconstitutional concerns. The Constitution guarantees both\ncriminal and civil litigants a right to an impartial jury.\nSee, e.g., Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, 362 (1966);\nThiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U. S. 217, 220 (1946).\nAnd we have made clear that voir dire can be an essential\nmeans of protecting this right. See, e.g., Turner v. Mur-\nray, 476 U. S. 28, 36 (1986) (plurality opinion); Ham v.\n10                      WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSouth Carolina, 409 U. S. 524, 527 (1973). These princi-\nples, Warger asserts, require that parties be allowed to\nuse evidence of deliberations to demonstrate that a juror\nlied during voir dire.\n   Given the clarity of both the text and history of Rule\n606(b), however, the canon of constitutional avoidance has\nno role to play here. The canon “is a tool for choosing\nbetween competing plausible interpretations” of a provi-\nsion. Clark v. Suarez-Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381 (2005).\nIt “has no application in the absence of . . . ambiguity.”\nUnited States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative,\n532 U. S. 483, 494 (2001). We see none here.\n   Moreover, any claim that Rule 606(b) is unconstitutional\nin circumstances such as these is foreclosed by our deci-\nsion in Tanner. In Tanner, we concluded that Rule 606(b)\nprecluded a criminal defendant from introducing evidence\nthat multiple jurors had been intoxicated during trial,\nrejecting the contention that this exclusion violated the\ndefendant’s Sixth Amendment right to “ ‘a tribunal both\nimpartial and mentally competent to afford a hearing.’ ”\n483 U. S., at 126 (quoting Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225\nU. S. 167, 176 (1912)). We reasoned that the defendant’s\nright to an unimpaired jury was sufficiently protected by\nvoir dire, the observations of court and counsel during\ntrial, and the potential use of “nonjuror evidence” of mis-\nconduct. 483 U. S., at 127. Similarly here, a party’s right\nto an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule\n606(b)’s removal of one means of ensuring that jurors are\nunbiased. Even if jurors lie in voir dire in a way that\nconceals bias, juror impartiality is adequately assured\nby the parties’ ability to bring to the court’s attention\nany evidence of bias before the verdict is rendered, and\nto employ nonjuror evidence even after the verdict is\nrendered.3\n——————\n 3 There   may be cases of juror bias so extreme that, almost by defini-\n                    Cite as: 574 U.

See\nTanner, 483 U. S., at 117. “External” matters include\npublicity and information related specifically to the case\nthe jurors are meant to decide, while “internal” matters\ninclude the general body of experiences that jurors are\nunderstood to bring with them to the jury room. See id.,\nat 117–119; 27 C. Wright & V. Gold, Federal Practice and\nProcedure: Evidence §6075, pp. 520–521 (2d ed. 2007).\nHere, the excluded affidavit falls on the “internal” side of\nthe line: Whipple’s daughter’s accident may well have\ninformed her general views about negligence liability for\ncar crashes, but it did not provide either her or the rest of\nthe jury with any specific knowledge regarding Shauers’\ncollision with Warger.\n   Indeed, Warger does not argue that Whipple’s state-\nments related to “extraneous” information in this sense.\nInstead, he contends that because Whipple would have\nbeen disqualified from the jury had she disclosed her\ndaughter’s accident, any information she shared with the\nother jurors was extraneous.\n   We cannot agree that whenever a juror should have\nbeen excluded from the jury, anything that juror says is\nnecessarily “extraneous” within the meaning of Rule\n606(b)(2)(A). Were that correct, parties would find it quite\n——————\ntion, the jury trial right has been abridged. If and when such a case\narises, the Court can consider whether the usual safeguards are or are\nnot sufficient to protect the integrity of the process. We need not\nconsider the question, however, for those facts are not presented here.\n12                  WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neasy to avoid Rule 606(b)’s limitations. As discussed\nabove, Congress adopted the restrictive version of the anti-\nimpeachment rule, one that common-law courts had con-\ncluded precludes parties from using deliberations evidence\nto prove juror dishonesty during voir dire. But if Warger’s\nunderstanding of the “extraneous” information exception\nwere accepted, then any time a party could use such evi-\ndence to show that a juror’s “correct response [during\nvoir dire] would have provided a valid basis for a chal-\nlenge”—a prerequisite for relief under McDonough, 464\nU. S., at 556—all evidence of what that juror said during\ndeliberations would be admissible. The “extraneous”\ninformation exception would swallow much of the rest of\nRule 606(b).\n   Even if such a result were not precluded by Congress’\napparent intent to adopt the restrictive federal approach,\nit is foreclosed by Tanner, which relied upon the doctrine\nthat “treat[s] allegations of the physical or mental incom-\npetence of a juror as ‘internal’ rather than ‘external’ mat-\nters.” 483 U. S., at 118. Tanner cited, in particular, cases\nholding that evidence of jurors’ insanity, inability to un-\nderstand English, and hearing impairments are all “inter-\nnal” matters subject to exclusion under Rule 606(b). Id.,\nat 119. Were we to follow Warger’s understanding of the\n“extraneous information” exception, all these cases, includ-\ning Tanner, would have been wrongly decided: If the ju-\nrors were not able to serve on the jury in the first place, or\nshould have been dismissed for their misconduct during\nthe trial, then what they said or did during deliberations\nwould necessarily be “extraneous” and admissible. Tan-\nner’s implicit rejection of this view easily extends from the\nsort of juror incompetence considered in that case to the\nalleged bias considered here. Whether a juror would have\nbeen struck from the jury because of incompetence or bias,\nthe mere fact that a juror would have been struck does not\nmake admissible evidence regarding that juror’s conduct\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Argued October 8, 2014—Decided December 9, 2014\nPetitioner Gregory Warger sued respondent Randy Shauers in federal\n  court for negligence for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident.\n  After the jury returned a verdict for Shauers, one of the jurors con-\n  tacted Warger’s counsel, claiming that Regina Whipple, the jury fore-\n  person, had revealed during deliberations that her daughter had\n  been at fault in a fatal motor vehicle accident, and that a lawsuit\n  would have ruined her daughter’s life. Armed with an affidavit from\n  the juror, Warger moved for a new trial, arguing that Whipple had\n  deliberately lied during voir dire about her impartiality and ability to\n  award damages. The District Court denied Warger’s motion, holding\n  that Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b), which bars evidence “about any\n  statement made . . . during the jury’s deliberations,” barred the affi-\n  davit, and that none of the Rule’s three exceptions, see Rule\n  606(b)(2), were applicable. The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Rule 606(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in\n which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror\n lied during voir dire. Pp. 3–10.\n       (a) This reading accords with the plain meaning of Rule 606(b),\n which applies to “an inquiry into the validity of [the] verdict.” This\n understanding is also consistent with the underlying common-law\n rule on which Congress based Rule 606(b). The so-called “federal\n rule” made jury deliberations evidence inadmissible even if used to\n demonstrate dishonesty during voir dire. Both the majority of courts\n and this Court’s pre-Rule606(b) cases, see McDonald v. Pless, 238\n U. S. 264, 268; Clark v. United States, 289 U. S. 1, favored this rule\n over the “Iowa rule,” which permitted the use of such jury delibera-\n tions evidence. The federal approach is clearly reflected in the lan-\n2                          WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    guage Congress chose when it enacted Rule 606(b), and legislative\n    history confirms that Congress’ choice was no accident. See Tanner\n    v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 125. Pp. 3–8.\n          (b) Warger’s arguments against this straightforward understand-\n    ing are not persuasive. Pp. 8–10.\n            (1) First, Warger insists that proceedings for a new trial based\n    on voir dire dishonesty do not involve an “inquiry into the validity of\n    the verdict.” His reading would restrict Rule 606(b)’s application to\n    claims of error for which a court must examine the manner in which\n    the jury reached its verdict, but the Rule does not focus on the means\n    by which deliberations evidence might be used to invalidate a verdict.\n    It simply applies during a proceeding in which a verdict may be ren-\n    dered invalid. Pp. 8–9.\n            (2) Warger also contends that excluding jury deliberations evi-\n    dence that shows voir dire dishonesty is unnecessary to fulfill Con-\n    gress’ objectives, but his arguments would apply to all evidence ren-\n    dered inadmissible by Rule 606(b), and he cannot escape the scope of\n    the Rule merely by asserting that Congress’ concerns were misplaced.\n    P. 9.\n            (3) Finally, Warger invokes the canon of constitutional avoid-\n    ance, contending that only his interpretation protects the right to an\n    impartial jury. But that canon has no application here, where there\n    is no ambiguity. See United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Co-\n    operative, 532 U. S. 483, 494. Moreover, this Court’s Tanner decision\n    forecloses any claim that Rule 606(b) is unconstitutional. Similar to\n    the right at issue in that case, Warger’s right to an impartial jury\n    remains protected despite Rule 606(b)’s removal of one means of en-\n    suring unbiased jurors. Even if a juror lies to conceal bias, parties\n    may bring to the court’s attention evidence of bias before the verdict\n    is rendered and use nonjuror evidence after the verdict is rendered.\n    Pp. 9–10.\n       2. The affidavit at issue was not admissible under Rule\n    606(b)(2)(A)’s exception for evidence of “extraneous prejudicial infor-\n    mation.” Generally speaking, extraneous information derives from a\n    source “external” to the jury. See Tanner, 483 U. S., at 117. Here,\n    the excluded affidavit falls on the “internal” side. Warger contends\n    that any information Whipple shared with the other jurors was ex-\n    traneous because she would have been disqualified from the jury had\n    she disclosed her daughter’s accident. However, such an exception\n    would swallow up much of the rest of the restrictive version of the\n    common-law rule that Congress adopted in enacting Rule 606(b).\n    Pp. 11–13.\n721 F. 3d 606, affirmed.\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                       Cite as: 574 U.

We hold that it does.\n                              I\n  Petitioner Gregory Warger was riding his motorcycle on\na highway outside Rapid City, South Dakota, when a\ntruck driven by respondent Randy Shauers struck him\nfrom behind. Warger claims he was stopped at the time of\nthe accident, while Shauers claims that Warger suddenly\npulled out in front of him. Regardless of the cause of the\naccident, no one disputes its tragic result: Warger sus-\ntained serious injuries that ultimately required the ampu-\ntation of his left leg.\n  Warger sued Shauers for negligence in Federal District\nCourt. During jury selection, counsel for both parties\n2                  WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconducted lengthy voir dire of the prospective jurors.\nWarger’s counsel asked whether any jurors would be\nunable to award damages for pain and suffering or for\nfuture medical expenses, or whether there was any juror\nwho thought, “I don’t think I could be a fair and impartial\njuror on this kind of case.” App. 105. Prospective juror\nRegina Whipple, who was later selected as the jury fore-\nperson, answered no to each of these questions. See id., at\n83, 89, 105.\n  Trial commenced, and the jury ultimately returned a\nverdict in favor of Shauers. Shortly thereafter, one of the\njurors contacted Warger’s counsel to express concern over\njuror Whipple’s conduct. The complaining juror subse-\nquently signed an affidavit claiming that Whipple had\nspoken during deliberations about “a motor vehicle colli-\nsion in which her daughter was at fault for the collision\nand a man died,” and had “related that if her daughter\nhad been sued, it would have ruined her life.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 40a–41a.\n  Relying on this affidavit, Warger moved for a new trial.\nHe contended that Whipple had deliberately lied during\nvoir dire about her impartiality and ability to award dam-\nages. Thus, he asserted, he had satisfied the requirements\nof McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464\nU. S. 548 (1984), which holds that a party may “obtain a\nnew trial” if he “demonstrate[s] that a juror failed to an-\nswer honestly a material question on voir dire, and . . .\nthat a correct response would have provided a valid basis\nfor a challenge for cause.” Id., at 556.\n  The District Court refused to grant a new trial, holding\nthat the only evidence that supported Warger’s motion,\nthe complaining juror’s affidavit, was barred by Federal\nRule of Evidence 606(b). As relevant here, that Rule\nprovides that “[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of a\nverdict,” evidence “about any statement made or incident\nthat occurred during the jury’s deliberations” is inadmis-\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

The Rule contains three specific\nexceptions—allowing testimony “about whether (A) extra-\nneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to\nthe jury’s attention; (B) an outside influence was improp-\nerly brought to bear on any juror; or (C) a mistake was\nmade in entering the verdict on the verdict form,” Rule\n606(b)(2)—but the District Court found none of these\nexceptions to be applicable.\n   The Eighth Circuit affirmed. 721 F. 3d 606 (2013). It\nfirst held that Warger’s proffered evidence did not fall\nwithin the “extraneous prejudicial evidence” exception set\nforth in Rule 606(b)(2)(A). The court explained that\n“[j]urors’ personal experiences do not constitute extrane-\nous information; it is unavoidable they will bring such\ninnate experiences into the jury room.” Id., at 611. Next,\nthe court rejected Warger’s alternative argument that\nRule 606(b) is wholly inapplicable when a litigant offers\nevidence to show that a juror was dishonest during voir\ndire. Acknowledging that there was a split among the\nFederal Courts of Appeals on this question, the Eighth\nCircuit joined those Circuits that had held that Rule\n606(b) applies to any proceeding in which the jury’s verdict\nmight be invalidated, including efforts to demonstrate that\na juror lied during voir dire. Compare id., at 611–612\n(citing Williams v. Price, 343 F. 3d 223, 235–237 (CA3\n2003), and United States v. Benally, 546 F. 3d 1230, 1235\n(CA10 2008)), with Hard v. Burlington N. R.

SHAUERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nduring a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a\nnew trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.\nIn doing so, we simply accord Rule 606(b)’s terms their\nplain meaning. The Rule, after all, applies “[d]uring an\ninquiry into the validity of a verdict.” Rule 606(b)(1). A\npostverdict motion for a new trial on the ground of\nvoir dire dishonesty plainly entails “an inquiry into the\nvalidity of [the] verdict”: If a juror was dishonest during\nvoir dire and an honest response would have provided a\nvalid basis to challenge that juror for cause, the verdict\nmust be invalidated. See McDonough, 464 U. S., at 556.\n    This understanding of the text of Rule 606(b) is con-\nsistent with the underlying common-law rule on which it\nwas based. Although some common-law courts would\nhave permitted evidence of jury deliberations to be intro-\nduced to demonstrate juror dishonesty during voir dire,\nthe majority would not, and the language of Rule 606(b)\nreflects Congress’ enactment of the more restrictive ver-\nsion of the common-law rule.\n    Rule 606(b) had its genesis in Vaise v. Delaval, 1 T. R.\n11, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K. B. 1785), in which Lord Mansfield\nheld inadmissible an affidavit from two jurors claiming\nthat the jury had decided the case through a game of\nchance. See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2352, p. 696 (J.\nMcNaughton rev. 1961). The rule soon took root in the\nUnited States, id., at 696–697, where it was viewed as\nboth promoting the finality of verdicts and insulating the\njury from outside influences, see McDonald v. Pless, 238\nU. S. 264, 267–268 (1915).\n    Some versions of the rule were narrower than others.\nUnder what was sometimes known as the “Iowa” ap-\nproach, juror testimony regarding deliberations was ex-\ncluded only to the extent that it related to matters that\n“ ‘inhere[d] in the verdict,’ ” which generally consisted of\nevidence of the jurors’ subjective intentions and thought\nprocesses in reaching a verdict. 3 C.

See, e.g., Mathi-\nsen v. Norton, 187 Wash. 240, 244–246, 60 P. 2d 1, 3–4\n(1936); Williams v. Bridges, 140 Cal. App. 537, 538–541,\n35 P. 2d 407, 408–409 (1934).\n   But other courts applied a broader version of the anti-\nimpeachment rule. Under this version, sometimes called\nthe “federal” approach, litigants were prohibited from\nusing evidence of jury deliberations unless it was offered\nto show that an “extraneous matter” had influenced the\njury. See 3 Mueller & Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence\n§6:16, at 71; Rules of Evidence for United States Courts\nand Magistrates, 56 F. R. D. 183, 265 (1973). The “great\nmajority” of appellate courts applying this version of the\nrule held jury deliberations evidence inadmissible even if\nused to demonstrate dishonesty during voir dire. Wilson\nv. Wiggins, 54 Ariz. 240, 246, 94 P. 2d 870, 872 (1939); see,\ne.g., Willis v. Davis, 333 P. 2d 311, 314 (Okla. 1958);\nTurner v. Hall’s Adm’x, 252 S. W. 2d 30, 34 (Ky. 1952);\nHinkel v.

Co., 20\n\nIowa 195 (1866), in which the Iowa Supreme Court held that a trial\ncourt considering a motion for a new trial should have accepted the\naffidavits of four jurors who claimed that their damages verdict had\nbeen determined by taking the average of the sums each juror thought\nproper (a “quotient” verdict). Id., at 212–213. The Wright court rea-\nsoned that, unlike evidence of a juror’s subjective intentions in reaching\na verdict, whether the verdict had been obtained in this fashion was an\n“independent fact” and thus could and should be proved by any avail-\nable evidence. Id., at 211.\n6                   WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave suggested a preference for the Iowa rule. See Hyde\nv. United States, 225 U. S. 347, 383–384 (1912) (“[W]e\nthink the rule expressed in Wright v. Illinois & Miss. Tel.\nCo., 20 Iowa 195 [1866], . . . should apply, that the testi-\nmony of jurors should not be received to show matters\nwhich essentially inhere in the verdict itself and neces-\nsarily depend upon the testimony of the jurors and can\nreceive no corroboration”); Mattox v. United States, 146\nU. S. 140, 148–149 (1892) (quoting at length a Kansas\nSupreme Court decision setting out the Iowa test). But to\nthe extent that these decisions created any question as to\nwhich approach this Court followed, McDonald v. Pless\nlargely settled matters. There, we held that juror affida-\nvits were not admissible to show that jurors had entered a\n“quotient” verdict, precisely the opposite of the result\nreached by the Iowa Supreme Court in its decision estab-\nlishing the Iowa approach. Compare 238 U. S., at 265,\n268, with Wright v. Illinois & Miss. Tel. Co., 20 Iowa 195,\n211–212 (1866). In doing so, we observed that although\ndecisions in a few States made admissible a “juror’s affi-\ndavit as to an overt act of misconduct, which was capable\nof being controverted by other jurors,” the argument in\nfavor of that approach (i.e., the Iowa rule) had not been\ngenerally accepted, because permitting such evidence\n“would open the door to the most pernicious arts and\ntampering with jurors.” 238 U. S., at 268 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   Our subsequent decision in Clark v. United States, 289\nU. S. 1 (1933), was consistent with our apparent rejection\nof the Iowa approach. In Clark, the Government had\nprosecuted for contempt a juror who, during voir dire in a\nprior case, had falsely denied knowing the defendant. Id.,\nat 6–8. We held that the prosecution could introduce\nevidence of what had occurred during deliberations in the\nprior case, rejecting the juror’s argument that these com-\nmunications were privileged. We were careful to explain,\n                    Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever, that nothing in our decision was “at variance\nwith the rule . . . that the testimony of a juror is not ad-\nmissible for the impeachment of his verdict.” Id., at 18.\nThis was because the verdict in the original case was not\nat issue, and therefore “the rule against impeachment\n[was] wholly unrelated to the problem . . . before us.”\nIbid.; accord, McDonald, 238 U. S., at 269. Clark thus\nclarified that the rule against jurors’ impeaching their\nverdicts applies only in a proceeding actually impeaching\nthat verdict—precisely the line Rule 606(b) draws when it\nrefers to an “inquiry into the validity of a verdict.”\n   In any event, these decisions predated Congress’ enact-\nment of Rule 606(b), and Congress was undoubtedly free\nto prescribe a broader version of the anti-impeachment\nrule than we had previously applied. The language of the\nRule it adopted clearly reflects the federal approach: As\nenacted, Rule 606(b) prohibited the use of any evidence of\njuror deliberations, subject only to the express exceptions\nfor extraneous information and outside influences.2\n   For those who consider legislative history relevant, here\nit confirms that this choice of language was no accident.\nCongress rejected a prior version of the Rule that, in ac-\ncordance with the Iowa approach, would have prohibited\njuror testimony only as to the “effect of anything upon . . .\n[any] juror’s mind or emotions . . . or concerning his men-\ntal processes.” Committee on Rules of Practice and Proce-\ndure of the Judicial Conference of the United States,\nRevised Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United\nStates Courts and Magistrates, 51 F. R. D. 315, 387\n(1971); see Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 123–\n125 (1987) (detailing the legislative history of the Rule).\nThus Congress “specifically understood, considered, and\nrejected a version of Rule 606(b)” that would have likely\n——————\n  2 The additional exception for mistakes made in entering the verdict\n\non the verdict form was adopted in 2006. See 547 U. S. 1281, 1286.\n8                    WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npermitted the introduction of evidence of deliberations to\nshow dishonesty during voir dire. Id., at 125.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n   Seeking to rebut this straightforward understanding of\nRule 606(b), Warger first insists that the proceedings that\nfollow a motion for new trial based on dishonesty during\nvoir dire do not involve an “inquiry into the validity of the\nverdict.” His argument is as follows: Under McDonough, a\nparty moving for a new trial on the basis of voir dire dis-\nhonesty need not show that this dishonesty had an effect\non the verdict. See 464 U. S., at 556. Although a success-\nful claim will result in vacatur of the judgment, vacatur is\nsimply the remedy for the McDonough error, just as it may\nbe the remedy for a variety of errors that have nothing to\ndo with the manner in which the jury reached its verdict.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Davila, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 12) (listing certain “ ‘structural’ ” errors war-\nranting “automatic reversal” of a criminal conviction).\nTherefore, Warger asserts, the “inquiry begins and ends\nwith what happened during voir dire.” Brief for Petitioner\n19–20.\n   We are not persuaded. Warger, it seems, would restrict\nRule 606(b)’s application to those claims of error for which\na court must examine the manner in which the jury\nreached its verdict—claims, one might say, involving an\ninquiry into the jury’s verdict. But the “inquiry” to which\nthe Rule refers is one into the “validity of the verdict,” not\ninto the verdict itself. The Rule does not focus on the\nmeans by which deliberations evidence might be used to\ninvalidate a verdict. It does not say “during an inquiry\ninto jury deliberations,” or prohibit the introduction of\nevidence of deliberations “for use in determining whether\nan asserted error affected the jury’s verdict.” It simply\napplies “[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of the ver-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndict”—that is, during a proceeding in which the verdict\nmay be rendered invalid. Whether or not a juror’s alleged\nmisconduct during voir dire had a direct effect on the\njury’s verdict, the motion for a new trial requires a court to\ndetermine whether the verdict can stand.\n                             B\n   Next, Warger contends that excluding jury deliberations\nevidence tending to show that a juror lied during voir dire\nis unnecessary to fulfill Congress’ apparent objectives of\nencouraging full and open debate in the jury room and\npreventing the harassment of former jurors. He observes\nthat jurors remain free to, and may sometimes be forced\nto, disclose what happened in the jury room, and that\nethical rules limit the ability of parties to harass jurors\nfollowing trial. But these are arguments against Rule\n606(b) generally, not arguments for the particular excep-\ntion to the Rule that Warger seeks. Congress’ enactment\nof Rule 606(b) was premised on the concerns that the use\nof deliberations evidence to challenge verdicts would\nrepresent a threat to both jurors and finality in those\ncircumstances not covered by the Rule’s express excep-\ntions. Warger cannot escape the scope of the Rule Con-\ngress adopted simply by asserting that its concerns were\nmisplaced.\n                             C\n  Nor do we accept Warger’s contention that we must\nadopt his interpretation of Rule 606(b) so as to avoid\nconstitutional concerns. The Constitution guarantees both\ncriminal and civil litigants a right to an impartial jury.\nSee, e.g., Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, 362 (1966);\nThiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U. S. 217, 220 (1946).\nAnd we have made clear that voir dire can be an essential\nmeans of protecting this right. See, e.g., Turner v. Mur-\nray, 476 U. S. 28, 36 (1986) (plurality opinion); Ham v.\n10                      WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSouth Carolina, 409 U. S. 524, 527 (1973). These princi-\nples, Warger asserts, require that parties be allowed to\nuse evidence of deliberations to demonstrate that a juror\nlied during voir dire.\n   Given the clarity of both the text and history of Rule\n606(b), however, the canon of constitutional avoidance has\nno role to play here. The canon “is a tool for choosing\nbetween competing plausible interpretations” of a provi-\nsion. Clark v. Suarez-Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381 (2005).\nIt “has no application in the absence of . . . ambiguity.”\nUnited States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative,\n532 U. S. 483, 494 (2001). We see none here.\n   Moreover, any claim that Rule 606(b) is unconstitutional\nin circumstances such as these is foreclosed by our deci-\nsion in Tanner. In Tanner, we concluded that Rule 606(b)\nprecluded a criminal defendant from introducing evidence\nthat multiple jurors had been intoxicated during trial,\nrejecting the contention that this exclusion violated the\ndefendant’s Sixth Amendment right to “ ‘a tribunal both\nimpartial and mentally competent to afford a hearing.’ ”\n483 U. S., at 126 (quoting Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225\nU. S. 167, 176 (1912)). We reasoned that the defendant’s\nright to an unimpaired jury was sufficiently protected by\nvoir dire, the observations of court and counsel during\ntrial, and the potential use of “nonjuror evidence” of mis-\nconduct. 483 U. S., at 127. Similarly here, a party’s right\nto an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule\n606(b)’s removal of one means of ensuring that jurors are\nunbiased. Even if jurors lie in voir dire in a way that\nconceals bias, juror impartiality is adequately assured\nby the parties’ ability to bring to the court’s attention\nany evidence of bias before the verdict is rendered, and\nto employ nonjuror evidence even after the verdict is\nrendered.3\n——————\n 3 There   may be cases of juror bias so extreme that, almost by defini-\n                    Cite as: 574 U.

See\nTanner, 483 U. S., at 117. “External” matters include\npublicity and information related specifically to the case\nthe jurors are meant to decide, while “internal” matters\ninclude the general body of experiences that jurors are\nunderstood to bring with them to the jury room. See id.,\nat 117–119; 27 C. Wright & V. Gold, Federal Practice and\nProcedure: Evidence §6075, pp. 520–521 (2d ed. 2007).\nHere, the excluded affidavit falls on the “internal” side of\nthe line: Whipple’s daughter’s accident may well have\ninformed her general views about negligence liability for\ncar crashes, but it did not provide either her or the rest of\nthe jury with any specific knowledge regarding Shauers’\ncollision with Warger.\n   Indeed, Warger does not argue that Whipple’s state-\nments related to “extraneous” information in this sense.\nInstead, he contends that because Whipple would have\nbeen disqualified from the jury had she disclosed her\ndaughter’s accident, any information she shared with the\nother jurors was extraneous.\n   We cannot agree that whenever a juror should have\nbeen excluded from the jury, anything that juror says is\nnecessarily “extraneous” within the meaning of Rule\n606(b)(2)(A).

If and when such a case\narises, the Court can consider whether the usual safeguards are or are\nnot sufficient to protect the integrity of the process. We need not\nconsider the question, however, for those facts are not presented here.\n12                  WARGER v. SHAUERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neasy to avoid Rule 606(b)’s limitations. As discussed\nabove, Congress adopted the restrictive version of the anti-\nimpeachment rule, one that common-law courts had con-\ncluded precludes parties from using deliberations evidence\nto prove juror dishonesty during voir dire. But if Warger’s\nunderstanding of the “extraneous” information exception\nwere accepted, then any time a party could use such evi-\ndence to show that a juror’s “correct response [during\nvoir dire] would have provided a valid basis for a chal-\nlenge”—a prerequisite for relief under McDonough, 464\nU. S., at 556—all evidence of what that juror said during\ndeliberations would be admissible. The “extraneous”\ninformation exception would swallow much of the rest of\nRule 606(b).\n   Even if such a result were not precluded by Congress’\napparent intent to adopt the restrictive federal approach,\nit is foreclosed by Tanner, which relied upon the doctrine\nthat “treat[s] allegations of the physical or mental incom-\npetence of a juror as ‘internal’ rather than ‘external’ mat-\nters.” 483 U. S., at 118. Tanner cited, in particular, cases\nholding that evidence of jurors’ insanity, inability to un-\nderstand English, and hearing impairments are all “inter-\nnal” matters subject to exclusion under Rule 606(b). Id.,\nat 119. Were we to follow Warger’s understanding of the\n“extraneous information” exception, all these cases, includ-\ning Tanner, would have been wrongly decided: If the ju-\nrors were not able to serve on the jury in the first place, or\nshould have been dismissed for their misconduct during\nthe trial, then what they said or did during deliberations\nwould necessarily be “extraneous” and admissible. Tan-\nner’s implicit rejection of this view easily extends from the\nsort of juror incompetence considered in that case to the\nalleged bias considered here. Whether a juror would have\nbeen struck from the jury because of incompetence or bias,\nthe mere fact that a juror would have been struck does not\nmake admissible evidence regarding that juror’s conduct\n                 Cite as: 574 U.
