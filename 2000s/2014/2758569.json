Argued October 8, 2014\u2014Decided December 9, 2014\nPetitioner Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc., required its hourly ware-\n  house workers, who retrieved products from warehouse shelves and\n  packaged them for delivery to Amazon.com customers, to undergo a\n  security screening before leaving the warehouse each day. Respond-\n  ents, former employees, sued the company alleging, as relevant here,\n  that they were entitled to compensation under the Fair Labor Stand-\n  ards Act of 1938 (FLSA) for the roughly 25 minutes each day that\n  they spent waiting to undergo and undergoing those screenings.\n  They also alleged that the company could have reduced that time to a\n  de minimis amount by adding screeners or staggering shift termina-\n  tions and that the screenings were conducted to prevent employee\n  theft and, thus, for the sole benefit of the employers and their cus-\n  tomers.\n     The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a\n  claim, holding that the screenings were not integral and indispensa-\n  ble to the employees\u2019 principal activities but were instead postlimi-\n  nary and noncompensable. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth\n  Circuit reversed in relevant part, asserting that postshift activities\n  that would ordinarily be classified as noncompensable postliminary\n  activities are compensable as integral and indispensable to an em-\n  ployee\u2019s principal activities if the postshift activities are necessary to\n  the principal work and performed for the employer\u2019s benefit.\nHeld: The time that respondents spent waiting to undergo and undergo-\n ing security screenings is not compensable under the FLSA. Pp. 3\u20139.\n    (a) Congress passed the Portal-to-Portal Act to respond to an eco-\n nomic emergency created by the broad judicial interpretation given to\n the FLSA\u2019s undefined terms \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cworkweek.\u201d See 29 U. S. C.\n2          INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    \u00a7251(a); Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123, 321\n    U. S. 590, 598. The Portal-to-Portal Act exempted employers from\n    FLSA liability for claims based on \u201cactivities which are preliminary\n    to or postliminary to\u201d the performance of the principal activities that\n    an employee is employed to perform. \u00a7254(a)(2). Under this Court\u2019s\n    precedents, the term \u201cprincipal activities\u201d includes all activities\n    which are an \u201cintegral and indispensable part of the principal activi-\n    ties.\u201d Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U. S. 247, 252\u2013253. An activity is \u201cin-\n    tegral and indispensable\u201d if it is an intrinsic element of the employ-\n    ee\u2019s principal activities and one with which the employee cannot\n    dispense if he is to perform his principal activities. This Court has\n    identified several activities that satisfy this test\u2014see, e.g., id., at 249,\n    251; Mitchell v. King Packing Co., 350 U. S. 260, 262\u2014and Depart-\n    ment of Labor regulations are consistent with this approach, see 29\n    CFR \u00a7\u00a7790.8(c), 790.7(g). Pp. 3\u20137.\n       (b) The security screenings at issue are noncompensable postlimi-\n    nary activities. To begin with, the screenings were not the principal\n    activities the employees were employed to perform\u2014i.e., the workers\n    were employed not to undergo security screenings but to retrieve\n    products from warehouse shelves and package them for shipment.\n    Nor were they \u201cintegral and indispensable\u201d to those activities. This\n    view is consistent with a 1951 Department of Labor opinion letter,\n    which found noncompensable under the Portal-to-Portal Act both a\n    preshift screening conducted for employee safety and a postshift\n    search conducted to prevent employee theft. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s test,\n    which focused on whether the particular activity was required by the\n    employer rather than whether it was tied to the productive work that\n    the employee was employed to perform, would sweep into \u201cprincipal\n    activities\u201d the very activities that the Portal-to-Portal Act was de-\n    signed to exclude from compensation. See, e.g., IBP, supra, at 41.\n    Finally, respondents\u2019 claim that the screenings are compensable be-\n    cause Integrity Staffing could have reduced the time to a de minimis\n    amount is properly presented at the bargaining table, not to a court\n    in an FLSA claim.

JESSE BUSK ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [December 9, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The employer in this case required its employees, ware-\nhouse workers who retrieved inventory and packaged it\nfor shipment, to undergo an antitheft security screen-\ning before leaving the warehouse each day. The question\npresented is whether the employees\u2019 time spent waiting to\nundergo and undergoing those security screenings is\ncompensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938\n(FLSA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7201 et seq., as amended by the Portal-\nto-Portal Act of 1947, \u00a7251 et seq. We hold that the time is\nnot compensable. We therefore reverse the judgment of\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n                            I\n  Petitioner Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc., provides\nwarehouse staffing to Amazon.com throughout the United\nStates.   Respondents Jesse Busk and Laurie Castro\nworked as hourly employees of Integrity Staffing at ware-\nhouses in Las Vegas and Fenley, Nevada, respectively. As\nwarehouse employees, they retrieved products from the\nshelves and packaged those products for delivery to Ama-\nzon customers.\n2      INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Integrity Staffing required its employees to undergo a\nsecurity screening before leaving the warehouse at the end\nof each day. During this screening, employees removed\nitems such as wallets, keys, and belts from their persons\nand passed through metal detectors.\n   In 2010, Busk and Castro filed a putative class action\nagainst Integrity Staffing on behalf of similarly situated\nemployees in the Nevada warehouses for alleged violations\nof the FLSA and Nevada labor laws. As relevant here, the\nemployees alleged that they were entitled to compensation\nunder the FLSA for the time spent waiting to undergo and\nactually undergoing the security screenings. They alleged\nthat such time amounted to roughly 25 minutes each day\nand that it could have been reduced to a de minimis\namount by adding more security screeners or by stagger-\ning the termination of shifts so that employees could flow\nthrough the checkpoint more quickly. They also alleged\nthat the screenings were conducted \u201cto prevent employee\ntheft\u201d and thus occurred \u201csolely for the benefit of the em-\nployers and their customers.\u201d App. 19, 21.\n   The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to\nstate a claim, holding that the time spent waiting for and\nundergoing the security screenings was not compensable\nunder the FLSA. It explained that, because the screenings\noccurred after the regular work shift, the employees could\nstate a claim for compensation only if the screenings were\nan integral and indispensable part of the principal activi-\nties they were employed to perform. The District Court\nheld that these screenings were not integral and indispen-\nsable but instead fell into a noncompensable category of\npostliminary activities.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit reversed in relevant part. 713 F. 3d 525 (2013). The\nCourt of Appeals asserted that postshift activities that\nwould ordinarily be classified as noncompensable postlim-\ninary activities are nevertheless compensable as integral\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand indispensable to an employee\u2019s principal activities if\nthose postshift activities are necessary to the principal\nwork performed and done for the benefit of the employer.\nId., at 530. Accepting as true the allegation that Integrity\nStaffing required the security screenings to prevent em-\nployee theft, the Court of Appeals concluded that the\nscreenings were \u201cnecessary\u201d to the employees\u2019 primary\nwork as warehouse employees and done for Integrity\nStaffing\u2019s benefit. Id., at 531.\n  We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n  Enacted in 1938, the FLSA established a minimum\nwage and overtime compensation for each hour worked in\nexcess of 40 hours in each workweek. \u00a7\u00a76(a)(1), 7(a)(3), 52\nStat. 1062\u20131063. An employer who violated these provi-\nsions could be held civilly liable for backpay, liquidated\ndamages, and attorney\u2019s fees. \u00a716, id., at 1069.\n  But the FLSA did not define \u201cwork\u201d or \u201cworkweek,\u201d and\nthis Court interpreted those terms broadly. It defined\n\u201cwork\u201d as \u201cphysical or mental exertion (whether burden-\nsome or not) controlled or required by the employer and\npursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the\nemployer and his business.\u201d Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co.\nv. Muscoda Local No. 123, 321 U. S. 590, 598 (1944).\nSimilarly, it defined \u201cthe statutory workweek\u201d to \u201cinclud[e]\nall time during which an employee is necessarily required\nto be on the employer\u2019s premises, on duty or at a pre-\nscribed workplace.\u201d Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.,\n328 U. S. 680, 690\u2013691 (1946). Applying these expansive\ndefinitions, the Court found compensable the time spent\ntraveling between mine portals and underground work\nareas, Tennessee Coal, supra, at 598, and the time spent\nwalking from timeclocks to work benches, Anderson, su-\n4      INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npra, at 691\u2013692.\n   These decisions provoked a flood of litigation. In the six\nmonths following this Court\u2019s decision in Anderson, unions\nand employees filed more than 1,500 lawsuits under the\nFLSA. S. Rep. No. 37, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 2\u20133\n(1947). These suits sought nearly $6 billion in back pay\nand liquidated damages for various preshift and postshift\nactivities. Ibid.\n   Congress responded swiftly. It found that the FLSA\nhad \u201cbeen interpreted judicially in disregard of long-\nestablished customs, practices, and contracts between\nemployers and employees, thereby creating wholly unex-\npected liabilities, immense in amount and retroactive in\noperation, upon employers.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7251(a). Declar-\ning the situation to be an \u201cemergency,\u201d Congress found\nthat, if such interpretations \u201cwere permitted to stand, . . .\nthe payment of such liabilities would bring about financial\nruin of many employers\u201d and \u201cemployees would receive\nwindfall payments . . . for activities performed by them\nwithout any expectation of reward beyond that included in\ntheir agreed rates of pay.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7251(a)\u2013(b).\n   Congress met this emergency with the Portal-to-Portal\nAct. The Portal-to-Portal Act exempted employers from\nliability for future claims based on two categories of work-\nrelated activities as follows:\n    \u201c(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) [which covers\n    work compensable by contract or custom], no employer\n    shall be subject to any liability or punishment under\n    the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended,\n    . . . on account of the failure of such employer . . .\n    to pay an employee overtime compensation, for or on\n    account of any of the following activities of such em-\n    ployee engaged in on or after the date of the enact-\n    ment of this Act\u2014\n    \u201c(1) walking, riding, or traveling to and from the ac-\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

S. C. \u00a7254(a)).\nAt issue here is the exemption for \u201cactivities which are\npreliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or\nactivities.\u201d\n                                B\n  This Court has consistently interpreted \u201cthe term \u2018prin-\ncipal activity or activities\u2019 [to] embrac[e] all activities\nwhich are an \u2018integral and indispensable part of the prin-\ncipal activities.\u2019 \u201d IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 29\u201330\n(2005) (quoting Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U. S. 247, 252\u2013253\n(1956)). Our prior opinions used those words in their\nordinary sense. The word \u201cintegral\u201d means \u201c[b]elonging to\nor making up an integral whole; constituent, component;\nspec[ifically] necessary to the completeness or integrity of\nthe whole; forming an intrinsic portion or element, as\ndistinguished from an adjunct or appendage.\u201d 5 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 366 (1933) (OED); accord, Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 20 (Brief for United\nStates); see also Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n1290 (2d ed. 1954) (Webster\u2019s Second) (\u201c[e]ssential to\ncompleteness; constituent, as a part\u201d). And, when used to\ndescribe a duty, \u201cindispensable\u201d means a duty \u201c[t]hat\ncannot be dispensed with, remitted, set aside, disregarded,\nor neglected.\u201d 5 OED 219; accord, Brief for United States\n19; see also Webster\u2019s Second 1267 (\u201c[n]ot capable of being\ndispensed with, set aside, neglected, or pronounced nonob-\n6      INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nligatory\u201d). An activity is therefore integral and indispen-\nsable to the principal activities that an employee is em-\nployed to perform if it is an intrinsic element of those\nactivities and one with which the employee cannot dis-\npense if he is to perform his principal activities. As we\ndescribe below, this definition, as applied in these circum-\nstances, is consistent with the Department of Labor\u2019s\nregulations.\n   Our precedents have identified several activities that\nsatisfy this test. For example, we have held compensable\nthe time battery-plant employees spent showering and\nchanging clothes because the chemicals in the plant were\n\u201ctoxic to human beings\u201d and the employer conceded that\n\u201cthe clothes-changing and showering activities of the\nemployees [were] indispensable to the performance of\ntheir productive work and integrally related thereto.\u201d\nSteiner, supra, at 249, 251. And we have held compensa-\nble the time meatpacker employees spent sharpening their\nknives because dull knives would \u201cslow down production\u201d\non the assembly line, \u201caffect the appearance of the meat as\nwell as the quality of the hides,\u201d \u201ccause waste,\u201d and lead to\n\u201caccidents.\u201d Mitchell v. King Packing Co., 350 U. S. 260,\n262 (1956). By contrast, we have held noncompensable\nthe time poultry-plant employees spent waiting to don\nprotective gear because such waiting was \u201ctwo steps re-\nmoved from the productive activity on the assembly line.\u201d\nIBP, supra, at 42.\n   The Department of Labor\u2019s regulations are consistent\nwith this approach. See 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(b) (2013) (\u201cThe\nterm \u2018principal activities\u2019 includes all activities which are\nan integral part of a principal activity\u201d); \u00a7790.8(c) (\u201cAmong\nthe activities included as an integral part of a principal\nactivity are those closely related activities which are\nindispensable to its performance\u201d). As an illustration,\nthose regulations explain that the time spent by an em-\nployee in a chemical plant changing clothes would be\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncompensable if he \u201cc[ould not] perform his principal activi-\nties without putting on certain clothes\u201d but would not be\ncompensable if \u201cchanging clothes [were] merely a conven-\nience to the employee and not directly related to his prin-\ncipal activities.\u201d See \u00a7790.8(c). As the regulations explain,\n\u201cwhen performed under the conditions normally present,\u201d\nactivities including \u201cchecking in and out and waiting in\nline to do so, changing clothes, washing up or showering,\nand waiting in line to receive pay checks\u201d are \u201c \u2018prelimi-\nnary\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018postliminary\u2019 \u201d activities. \u00a7790.7(g).\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n  The security screenings at issue here are noncompensa-\nble postliminary activities. To begin with, the screenings\nwere not the \u201cprincipal activity or activities which [the]\nemployee is employed to perform.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7254(a)(1).\nIntegrity Staffing did not employ its workers to undergo\nsecurity screenings, but to retrieve products from ware-\nhouse shelves and package those products for shipment to\nAmazon customers.\n  The security screenings also were not \u201cintegral and\nindispensable\u201d to the employees\u2019 duties as warehouse\nworkers. As explained above, an activity is not integral\nand indispensable to an employee\u2019s principal activities\nunless it is an intrinsic element of those activities and one\nwith which the employee cannot dispense if he is to per-\nform those activities. The screenings were not an intrinsic\nelement of retrieving products from warehouse shelves or\npackaging them for shipment. And Integrity Staffing\ncould have eliminated the screenings altogether without\nimpairing the employees\u2019 ability to complete their work.\n  The Solicitor General, adopting the position of the De-\npartment of Labor, agrees that these screenings were\nnoncompensable postliminary activities. See Brief for\nUnited States 10. That view is fully consistent with an\n8      INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOpinion Letter the Department issued in 1951. The letter\nfound noncompensable a preshift security search of em-\nployees in a rocket-powder plant \u201c \u2018for matches, spark\nproducing devices such as cigarette lighters, and other\nitems which have a direct bearing on the safety of the\nemployees,\u2019 \u201d as well as a postshift security search of the\nemployees done \u201c \u2018for the purpose of preventing theft.\u2019 \u201d\nOpinion Letter from Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Div.,\nto Dept. of Army, Office of Chief of Ordnance (Apr. 18,\n1951), pp. 1\u20132 (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). The\nDepartment drew no distinction between the searches\nconducted for the safety of the employees and those con-\nducted for the purpose of preventing theft\u2014neither were\ncompensable under the Portal-to-Portal Act.\n                              B\n  The Court of Appeals erred by focusing on whether an\nemployer required a particular activity. The integral and\nindispensable test is tied to the productive work that the\nemployee is employed to perform. See, e.g., IBP, 546 U. S.,\nat 42; Mitchell, supra, at 262; Steiner, 350 U. S., at 249\u2013\n251; see also 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(a) (explaining that the term\n\u201cprincipal activities\u201d was \u201cconsidered sufficiently broad to\nembrace within its terms such activities as are indispen-\nsable to the performance of productive work\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted; emphasis added)); \u00a7790.8(c)\n(\u201cAmong the activities included as an integral part of a\nprincipal activity are those closely related activities which\nare indispensable to its performance\u201d (emphasis added)).\n  If the test could be satisfied merely by the fact that an\nemployer required an activity, it would sweep into \u201cprinci-\npal activities\u201d the very activities that the Portal-to-Portal\nAct was designed to address. The employer in Anderson,\nfor instance, required its employees to walk \u201cfrom a\ntimeclock near the factory gate to a workstation\u201d so that\nthey could \u201cbegin their work,\u201d \u201cbut it is indisputable that\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

A test\nthat turns on whether the activity is for the benefit of the\nemployer is similarly overbroad.\n  Finally, we reject the employees\u2019 argument that time\nspent waiting to undergo the security screenings is com-\npensable under the FLSA because Integrity Staffing could\nhave reduced that time to a de minimis amount. The fact\nthat an employer could conceivably reduce the time spent\nby employees on any preliminary or postliminary activity\ndoes not change the nature of the activity or its relation-\nship to the principal activities that an employee is em-\nployed to perform. These arguments are properly present-\ned to the employer at the bargaining table, see 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7254(b)(1), not to a court in an FLSA claim.\n                        *    *     *\n  We hold that an activity is integral and indispensable to\nthe principal activities that an employee is employed to\nperform\u2014and thus compensable under the FLSA\u2014if it is\nan intrinsic element of those activities and one with which\nthe employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his prin-\ncipal activities. Because the employees\u2019 time spent wait-\ning to undergo and undergoing Integrity Staffing\u2019s security\nscreenings does not meet these criteria, we reverse the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

JESSE BUSK ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [December 9, 2014]\n\n\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE KAGAN joins,\nconcurring.\n    I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion, and write separately\nonly to explain my understanding of the standards the\nCourt applies.\n    The Court reaches two critical conclusions. First, the\nCourt confirms that compensable \u201c \u2018principal\u2019 \u201d activities\n\u201c \u2018includ[e] . . . those closely related activities which are\nindispensable to [a principal activity\u2019s] performance,\u2019 \u201d\nante, at 6 (quoting 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(c)(2013)), and holds that\nthe required security screenings here were not \u201cintegral\nand indispensable\u201d to another principal activity the em-\nployees were employed to perform, ante, at 7. I agree. As\nboth Department of Labor regulations and our precedent\nmake clear, an activity is \u201cindispensable\u201d to another,\nprincipal activity only when an employee could not dis-\npense with it without impairing his ability to perform the\nprincipal activity safely and effectively. Thus, although a\nbattery plant worker might, for example, perform his\nprincipal activities without donning proper protective\ngear, he could not do so safely, see Steiner v. Mitchell, 350\nU. S. 247, 250\u2013253 (1956); likewise, a butcher might be\nable to cut meat without having sharpened his knives, but\nhe could not do so effectively, see Mitchell v. King Packing\nCo., 350 U. S. 260, 262\u2013263 (1956); accord, 29 CFR\n2      INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n\u00a7790.8(c). Here, by contrast, the security screenings were\nnot \u201cintegral and indispensable\u201d to the employees\u2019 other\nprincipal activities in this sense. The screenings may, as\nthe Ninth Circuit observed below, have been in some way\nrelated to the work that the employees performed in the\nwarehouse, see 713 F. 3d 525, 531 (2013), but the employ-\nees could skip the screenings altogether without the safety\nor effectiveness of their principal activities being substan-\ntially impaired, see ante, at 7.\n   Second, the Court holds also that the screenings were\nnot themselves \u201c \u2018principal . . . activities\u2019 \u201d the employees\nwere \u201c \u2018employed to perform.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7254(a)(1)). On this point, I understand the Court\u2019s anal-\nysis to turn on its conclusion that undergoing security\nscreenings was not itself work of consequence that the\nemployees performed for their employer. See ante, at 7.\nAgain, I agree. As the statute\u2019s use of the words \u201cprelimi-\nnary\u201d and \u201cpostliminary\u201d suggests, \u00a7254(a)(2), and as our\nprecedents make clear, the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 is\nprimarily concerned with defining the beginning and end\nof the workday. See IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21,\n34\u201337 (2005). It distinguishes between activities that are\nessentially part of the ingress and egress process, on the\none hand, and activities that constitute the actual \u201cwork of\nconsequence performed for an employer,\u201d on the other\nhand. 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(a); see also ibid. (clarifying that a\nprincipal activity need not predominate over other activi-\nties, and that an employee could be employed to perform\nmultiple principal activities). The security screenings at\nissue here fall on the \u201cpreliminary . . . or postliminary\u201d\nside of this line. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7254(a)(2). The searches were\npart of the process by which the employees egressed their\nplace of work, akin to checking in and out and waiting in\nline to do so\u2014activities that Congress clearly deemed to be\npreliminary or postlimininary. See S. Rep. No. 48, 80th\nCong., 1st Sess., 47 (1947); 29 CFR \u00a7790.7(g). Indeed, as\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nthe Court observes, the Department of Labor reached the\nvery same conclusion regarding similar security screen-\nings shortly after the Portal-to-Portal Act was adopted, see\nante, at 7\u20138, and we owe deference to that determination,\nsee Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 587\n(2000).\n  Because I understand the Court\u2019s opinion to be con-\nsistent with the foregoing, I join it.\n",

Argued October 8, 2014\u2014Decided December 9, 2014\nPetitioner Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc., required its hourly ware-\n  house workers, who retrieved products from warehouse shelves and\n  packaged them for delivery to Amazon.com customers, to undergo a\n  security screening before leaving the warehouse each day. Respond-\n  ents, former employees, sued the company alleging, as relevant here,\n  that they were entitled to compensation under the Fair Labor Stand-\n  ards Act of 1938 (FLSA) for the roughly 25 minutes each day that\n  they spent waiting to undergo and undergoing those screenings.\n  They also alleged that the company could have reduced that time to a\n  de minimis amount by adding screeners or staggering shift termina-\n  tions and that the screenings were conducted to prevent employee\n  theft and, thus, for the sole benefit of the employers and their cus-\n  tomers.\n     The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a\n  claim, holding that the screenings were not integral and indispensa-\n  ble to the employees\u2019 principal activities but were instead postlimi-\n  nary and noncompensable. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth\n  Circuit reversed in relevant part, asserting that postshift activities\n  that would ordinarily be classified as noncompensable postliminary\n  activities are compensable as integral and indispensable to an em-\n  ployee\u2019s principal activities if the postshift activities are necessary to\n  the principal work and performed for the employer\u2019s benefit.\nHeld: The time that respondents spent waiting to undergo and undergo-\n ing security screenings is not compensable under the FLSA. Pp. 3\u20139.\n    (a) Congress passed the Portal-to-Portal Act to respond to an eco-\n nomic emergency created by the broad judicial interpretation given to\n the FLSA\u2019s undefined terms \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cworkweek.\u201d See 29 U. S. C.\n2          INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    \u00a7251(a); Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123, 321\n    U. S. 590, 598. The Portal-to-Portal Act exempted employers from\n    FLSA liability for claims based on \u201cactivities which are preliminary\n    to or postliminary to\u201d the performance of the principal activities that\n    an employee is employed to perform. \u00a7254(a)(2). Under this Court\u2019s\n    precedents, the term \u201cprincipal activities\u201d includes all activities\n    which are an \u201cintegral and indispensable part of the principal activi-\n    ties.\u201d Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U. S. 247, 252\u2013253. An activity is \u201cin-\n    tegral and indispensable\u201d if it is an intrinsic element of the employ-\n    ee\u2019s principal activities and one with which the employee cannot\n    dispense if he is to perform his principal activities. This Court has\n    identified several activities that satisfy this test\u2014see, e.g., id., at 249,\n    251; Mitchell v. King Packing Co., 350 U. S. 260, 262\u2014and Depart-\n    ment of Labor regulations are consistent with this approach, see 29\n    CFR \u00a7\u00a7790.8(c), 790.7(g). Pp. 3\u20137.\n       (b) The security screenings at issue are noncompensable postlimi-\n    nary activities. To begin with, the screenings were not the principal\n    activities the employees were employed to perform\u2014i.e., the workers\n    were employed not to undergo security screenings but to retrieve\n    products from warehouse shelves and package them for shipment.\n    Nor were they \u201cintegral and indispensable\u201d to those activities. This\n    view is consistent with a 1951 Department of Labor opinion letter,\n    which found noncompensable under the Portal-to-Portal Act both a\n    preshift screening conducted for employee safety and a postshift\n    search conducted to prevent employee theft. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s test,\n    which focused on whether the particular activity was required by the\n    employer rather than whether it was tied to the productive work that\n    the employee was employed to perform, would sweep into \u201cprincipal\n    activities\u201d the very activities that the Portal-to-Portal Act was de-\n    signed to exclude from compensation. See, e.g., IBP, supra, at 41.\n    Finally, respondents\u2019 claim that the screenings are compensable be-\n    cause Integrity Staffing could have reduced the time to a de minimis\n    amount is properly presented at the bargaining table, not to a court\n    in an FLSA claim.

The question\npresented is whether the employees\u2019 time spent waiting to\nundergo and undergoing those security screenings is\ncompensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938\n(FLSA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7201 et seq., as amended by the Portal-\nto-Portal Act of 1947, \u00a7251 et seq. We hold that the time is\nnot compensable. We therefore reverse the judgment of\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n                            I\n  Petitioner Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc., provides\nwarehouse staffing to Amazon.com throughout the United\nStates.   Respondents Jesse Busk and Laurie Castro\nworked as hourly employees of Integrity Staffing at ware-\nhouses in Las Vegas and Fenley, Nevada, respectively. As\nwarehouse employees, they retrieved products from the\nshelves and packaged those products for delivery to Ama-\nzon customers.\n2      INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Integrity Staffing required its employees to undergo a\nsecurity screening before leaving the warehouse at the end\nof each day. During this screening, employees removed\nitems such as wallets, keys, and belts from their persons\nand passed through metal detectors.\n   In 2010, Busk and Castro filed a putative class action\nagainst Integrity Staffing on behalf of similarly situated\nemployees in the Nevada warehouses for alleged violations\nof the FLSA and Nevada labor laws. As relevant here, the\nemployees alleged that they were entitled to compensation\nunder the FLSA for the time spent waiting to undergo and\nactually undergoing the security screenings. They alleged\nthat such time amounted to roughly 25 minutes each day\nand that it could have been reduced to a de minimis\namount by adding more security screeners or by stagger-\ning the termination of shifts so that employees could flow\nthrough the checkpoint more quickly. They also alleged\nthat the screenings were conducted \u201cto prevent employee\ntheft\u201d and thus occurred \u201csolely for the benefit of the em-\nployers and their customers.\u201d App. 19, 21.\n   The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to\nstate a claim, holding that the time spent waiting for and\nundergoing the security screenings was not compensable\nunder the FLSA. It explained that, because the screenings\noccurred after the regular work shift, the employees could\nstate a claim for compensation only if the screenings were\nan integral and indispensable part of the principal activi-\nties they were employed to perform. The District Court\nheld that these screenings were not integral and indispen-\nsable but instead fell into a noncompensable category of\npostliminary activities.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit reversed in relevant part. 713 F. 3d 525 (2013). The\nCourt of Appeals asserted that postshift activities that\nwould ordinarily be classified as noncompensable postlim-\ninary activities are nevertheless compensable as integral\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand indispensable to an employee\u2019s principal activities if\nthose postshift activities are necessary to the principal\nwork performed and done for the benefit of the employer.\nId., at 530. Accepting as true the allegation that Integrity\nStaffing required the security screenings to prevent em-\nployee theft, the Court of Appeals concluded that the\nscreenings were \u201cnecessary\u201d to the employees\u2019 primary\nwork as warehouse employees and done for Integrity\nStaffing\u2019s benefit. Id., at 531.\n  We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n  Enacted in 1938, the FLSA established a minimum\nwage and overtime compensation for each hour worked in\nexcess of 40 hours in each workweek. \u00a7\u00a76(a)(1), 7(a)(3), 52\nStat. 1062\u20131063. An employer who violated these provi-\nsions could be held civilly liable for backpay, liquidated\ndamages, and attorney\u2019s fees. \u00a716, id., at 1069.\n  But the FLSA did not define \u201cwork\u201d or \u201cworkweek,\u201d and\nthis Court interpreted those terms broadly. It defined\n\u201cwork\u201d as \u201cphysical or mental exertion (whether burden-\nsome or not) controlled or required by the employer and\npursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the\nemployer and his business.\u201d Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co.\nv. Muscoda Local No. 123, 321 U. S. 590, 598 (1944).\nSimilarly, it defined \u201cthe statutory workweek\u201d to \u201cinclud[e]\nall time during which an employee is necessarily required\nto be on the employer\u2019s premises, on duty or at a pre-\nscribed workplace.\u201d Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.,\n328 U. S. 680, 690\u2013691 (1946). Applying these expansive\ndefinitions, the Court found compensable the time spent\ntraveling between mine portals and underground work\nareas, Tennessee Coal, supra, at 598, and the time spent\nwalking from timeclocks to work benches, Anderson, su-\n4      INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npra, at 691\u2013692.\n   These decisions provoked a flood of litigation. In the six\nmonths following this Court\u2019s decision in Anderson, unions\nand employees filed more than 1,500 lawsuits under the\nFLSA. S. Rep. No. 37, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 2\u20133\n(1947). These suits sought nearly $6 billion in back pay\nand liquidated damages for various preshift and postshift\nactivities. Ibid.\n   Congress responded swiftly. It found that the FLSA\nhad \u201cbeen interpreted judicially in disregard of long-\nestablished customs, practices, and contracts between\nemployers and employees, thereby creating wholly unex-\npected liabilities, immense in amount and retroactive in\noperation, upon employers.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7251(a). Declar-\ning the situation to be an \u201cemergency,\u201d Congress found\nthat, if such interpretations \u201cwere permitted to stand, . . .\nthe payment of such liabilities would bring about financial\nruin of many employers\u201d and \u201cemployees would receive\nwindfall payments . . . for activities performed by them\nwithout any expectation of reward beyond that included in\ntheir agreed rates of pay.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7251(a)\u2013(b).\n   Congress met this emergency with the Portal-to-Portal\nAct. The Portal-to-Portal Act exempted employers from\nliability for future claims based on two categories of work-\nrelated activities as follows:\n    \u201c(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) [which covers\n    work compensable by contract or custom], no employer\n    shall be subject to any liability or punishment under\n    the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended,\n    . . . on account of the failure of such employer . . .\n    to pay an employee overtime compensation, for or on\n    account of any of the following activities of such em-\n    ployee engaged in on or after the date of the enact-\n    ment of this Act\u2014\n    \u201c(1) walking, riding, or traveling to and from the ac-\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

The word \u201cintegral\u201d means \u201c[b]elonging to\nor making up an integral whole; constituent, component;\nspec[ifically] necessary to the completeness or integrity of\nthe whole; forming an intrinsic portion or element, as\ndistinguished from an adjunct or appendage.\u201d 5 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 366 (1933) (OED); accord, Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 20 (Brief for United\nStates); see also Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n1290 (2d ed. 1954) (Webster\u2019s Second) (\u201c[e]ssential to\ncompleteness; constituent, as a part\u201d). And, when used to\ndescribe a duty, \u201cindispensable\u201d means a duty \u201c[t]hat\ncannot be dispensed with, remitted, set aside, disregarded,\nor neglected.\u201d 5 OED 219; accord, Brief for United States\n19; see also Webster\u2019s Second 1267 (\u201c[n]ot capable of being\ndispensed with, set aside, neglected, or pronounced nonob-\n6      INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nligatory\u201d). An activity is therefore integral and indispen-\nsable to the principal activities that an employee is em-\nployed to perform if it is an intrinsic element of those\nactivities and one with which the employee cannot dis-\npense if he is to perform his principal activities. As we\ndescribe below, this definition, as applied in these circum-\nstances, is consistent with the Department of Labor\u2019s\nregulations.\n   Our precedents have identified several activities that\nsatisfy this test. For example, we have held compensable\nthe time battery-plant employees spent showering and\nchanging clothes because the chemicals in the plant were\n\u201ctoxic to human beings\u201d and the employer conceded that\n\u201cthe clothes-changing and showering activities of the\nemployees [were] indispensable to the performance of\ntheir productive work and integrally related thereto.\u201d\nSteiner, supra, at 249, 251. And we have held compensa-\nble the time meatpacker employees spent sharpening their\nknives because dull knives would \u201cslow down production\u201d\non the assembly line, \u201caffect the appearance of the meat as\nwell as the quality of the hides,\u201d \u201ccause waste,\u201d and lead to\n\u201caccidents.\u201d Mitchell v. King Packing Co., 350 U. S. 260,\n262 (1956). By contrast, we have held noncompensable\nthe time poultry-plant employees spent waiting to don\nprotective gear because such waiting was \u201ctwo steps re-\nmoved from the productive activity on the assembly line.\u201d\nIBP, supra, at 42.\n   The Department of Labor\u2019s regulations are consistent\nwith this approach. See 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(b) (2013) (\u201cThe\nterm \u2018principal activities\u2019 includes all activities which are\nan integral part of a principal activity\u201d); \u00a7790.8(c) (\u201cAmong\nthe activities included as an integral part of a principal\nactivity are those closely related activities which are\nindispensable to its performance\u201d). As an illustration,\nthose regulations explain that the time spent by an em-\nployee in a chemical plant changing clothes would be\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncompensable if he \u201cc[ould not] perform his principal activi-\nties without putting on certain clothes\u201d but would not be\ncompensable if \u201cchanging clothes [were] merely a conven-\nience to the employee and not directly related to his prin-\ncipal activities.\u201d See \u00a7790.8(c). As the regulations explain,\n\u201cwhen performed under the conditions normally present,\u201d\nactivities including \u201cchecking in and out and waiting in\nline to do so, changing clothes, washing up or showering,\nand waiting in line to receive pay checks\u201d are \u201c \u2018prelimi-\nnary\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018postliminary\u2019 \u201d activities. \u00a7790.7(g).\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n  The security screenings at issue here are noncompensa-\nble postliminary activities. To begin with, the screenings\nwere not the \u201cprincipal activity or activities which [the]\nemployee is employed to perform.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7254(a)(1).\nIntegrity Staffing did not employ its workers to undergo\nsecurity screenings, but to retrieve products from ware-\nhouse shelves and package those products for shipment to\nAmazon customers.\n  The security screenings also were not \u201cintegral and\nindispensable\u201d to the employees\u2019 duties as warehouse\nworkers. As explained above, an activity is not integral\nand indispensable to an employee\u2019s principal activities\nunless it is an intrinsic element of those activities and one\nwith which the employee cannot dispense if he is to per-\nform those activities. The screenings were not an intrinsic\nelement of retrieving products from warehouse shelves or\npackaging them for shipment. And Integrity Staffing\ncould have eliminated the screenings altogether without\nimpairing the employees\u2019 ability to complete their work.\n  The Solicitor General, adopting the position of the De-\npartment of Labor, agrees that these screenings were\nnoncompensable postliminary activities. See Brief for\nUnited States 10. That view is fully consistent with an\n8      INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOpinion Letter the Department issued in 1951. The letter\nfound noncompensable a preshift security search of em-\nployees in a rocket-powder plant \u201c \u2018for matches, spark\nproducing devices such as cigarette lighters, and other\nitems which have a direct bearing on the safety of the\nemployees,\u2019 \u201d as well as a postshift security search of the\nemployees done \u201c \u2018for the purpose of preventing theft.\u2019 \u201d\nOpinion Letter from Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Div.,\nto Dept. of Army, Office of Chief of Ordnance (Apr. 18,\n1951), pp. 1\u20132 (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). The\nDepartment drew no distinction between the searches\nconducted for the safety of the employees and those con-\nducted for the purpose of preventing theft\u2014neither were\ncompensable under the Portal-to-Portal Act.\n                              B\n  The Court of Appeals erred by focusing on whether an\nemployer required a particular activity. The integral and\nindispensable test is tied to the productive work that the\nemployee is employed to perform. See, e.g., IBP, 546 U. S.,\nat 42; Mitchell, supra, at 262; Steiner, 350 U. S., at 249\u2013\n251; see also 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(a) (explaining that the term\n\u201cprincipal activities\u201d was \u201cconsidered sufficiently broad to\nembrace within its terms such activities as are indispen-\nsable to the performance of productive work\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted; emphasis added)); \u00a7790.8(c)\n(\u201cAmong the activities included as an integral part of a\nprincipal activity are those closely related activities which\nare indispensable to its performance\u201d (emphasis added)).\n  If the test could be satisfied merely by the fact that an\nemployer required an activity, it would sweep into \u201cprinci-\npal activities\u201d the very activities that the Portal-to-Portal\nAct was designed to address. The employer in Anderson,\nfor instance, required its employees to walk \u201cfrom a\ntimeclock near the factory gate to a workstation\u201d so that\nthey could \u201cbegin their work,\u201d \u201cbut it is indisputable that\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Portal-to-Portal Act evinces Congress\u2019 intent to repu-\ndiate Anderson\u2019s holding that such walking time was\ncompensable under the FLSA.\u201d IBP, supra, at 41. A test\nthat turns on whether the activity is for the benefit of the\nemployer is similarly overbroad.\n  Finally, we reject the employees\u2019 argument that time\nspent waiting to undergo the security screenings is com-\npensable under the FLSA because Integrity Staffing could\nhave reduced that time to a de minimis amount. The fact\nthat an employer could conceivably reduce the time spent\nby employees on any preliminary or postliminary activity\ndoes not change the nature of the activity or its relation-\nship to the principal activities that an employee is em-\nployed to perform. These arguments are properly present-\ned to the employer at the bargaining table, see 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7254(b)(1), not to a court in an FLSA claim.\n                        *    *     *\n  We hold that an activity is integral and indispensable to\nthe principal activities that an employee is employed to\nperform\u2014and thus compensable under the FLSA\u2014if it is\nan intrinsic element of those activities and one with which\nthe employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his prin-\ncipal activities. Because the employees\u2019 time spent wait-\ning to undergo and undergoing Integrity Staffing\u2019s security\nscreenings does not meet these criteria, we reverse the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

JESSE BUSK ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [December 9, 2014]\n\n\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE KAGAN joins,\nconcurring.\n    I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion, and write separately\nonly to explain my understanding of the standards the\nCourt applies.\n    The Court reaches two critical conclusions. First, the\nCourt confirms that compensable \u201c \u2018principal\u2019 \u201d activities\n\u201c \u2018includ[e] . . . those closely related activities which are\nindispensable to [a principal activity\u2019s] performance,\u2019 \u201d\nante, at 6 (quoting 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(c)(2013)), and holds that\nthe required security screenings here were not \u201cintegral\nand indispensable\u201d to another principal activity the em-\nployees were employed to perform, ante, at 7. I agree. As\nboth Department of Labor regulations and our precedent\nmake clear, an activity is \u201cindispensable\u201d to another,\nprincipal activity only when an employee could not dis-\npense with it without impairing his ability to perform the\nprincipal activity safely and effectively. Thus, although a\nbattery plant worker might, for example, perform his\nprincipal activities without donning proper protective\ngear, he could not do so safely, see Steiner v. Mitchell, 350\nU. S. 247, 250\u2013253 (1956); likewise, a butcher might be\nable to cut meat without having sharpened his knives, but\nhe could not do so effectively, see Mitchell v. King Packing\nCo., 350 U. S. 260, 262\u2013263 (1956); accord, 29 CFR\n2      INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC. v. BUSK\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n\u00a7790.8(c). Here, by contrast, the security screenings were\nnot \u201cintegral and indispensable\u201d to the employees\u2019 other\nprincipal activities in this sense. The screenings may, as\nthe Ninth Circuit observed below, have been in some way\nrelated to the work that the employees performed in the\nwarehouse, see 713 F. 3d 525, 531 (2013), but the employ-\nees could skip the screenings altogether without the safety\nor effectiveness of their principal activities being substan-\ntially impaired, see ante, at 7.\n   Second, the Court holds also that the screenings were\nnot themselves \u201c \u2018principal . . . activities\u2019 \u201d the employees\nwere \u201c \u2018employed to perform.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7254(a)(1)). On this point, I understand the Court\u2019s anal-\nysis to turn on its conclusion that undergoing security\nscreenings was not itself work of consequence that the\nemployees performed for their employer. See ante, at 7.\nAgain, I agree. As the statute\u2019s use of the words \u201cprelimi-\nnary\u201d and \u201cpostliminary\u201d suggests, \u00a7254(a)(2), and as our\nprecedents make clear, the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 is\nprimarily concerned with defining the beginning and end\nof the workday. See IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21,\n34\u201337 (2005). It distinguishes between activities that are\nessentially part of the ingress and egress process, on the\none hand, and activities that constitute the actual \u201cwork of\nconsequence performed for an employer,\u201d on the other\nhand. 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(a); see also ibid. (clarifying that a\nprincipal activity need not predominate over other activi-\nties, and that an employee could be employed to perform\nmultiple principal activities). The security screenings at\nissue here fall on the \u201cpreliminary . . . or postliminary\u201d\nside of this line. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7254(a)(2). The searches were\npart of the process by which the employees egressed their\nplace of work, akin to checking in and out and waiting in\nline to do so\u2014activities that Congress clearly deemed to be\npreliminary or postlimininary. See S. Rep. No. 48, 80th\nCong., 1st Sess., 47 (1947); 29 CFR \u00a7790.7(g). Indeed, as\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nthe Court observes, the Department of Labor reached the\nvery same conclusion regarding similar security screen-\nings shortly after the Portal-to-Portal Act was adopted, see\nante, at 7\u20138, and we owe deference to that determination,\nsee Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 587\n(2000).\n  Because I understand the Court\u2019s opinion to be con-\nsistent with the foregoing, I join it.\n</pre>",
