NORTH CAROLINA\n\n CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  No. 13–604.      Argued October 6, 2014—Decided December 15, 2014\nFollowing a suspicious vehicle, Sergeant Matt Darisse noticed that only\n  one of the vehicle’s brake lights was working and pulled the driver\n  over. While issuing a warning ticket for the broken brake light, Dar-\n  isse became suspicious of the actions of the two occupants and their\n  answers to his questions. Petitioner Nicholas Brady Heien, the car’s\n  owner, gave Darisse consent to search the vehicle. Darisse found co-\n  caine, and Heien was arrested and charged with attempted traffick-\n  ing. The trial court denied Heien’s motion to suppress the seized evi-\n  dence on Fourth Amendment grounds, concluding that the vehicle’s\n  faulty brake light gave Darisse reasonable suspicion to initiate the\n  stop. The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the\n  relevant code provision, which requires that a car be “equipped with\n  a stop lamp,” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §20–129(g), requires only a single\n  lamp—which Heien’s vehicle had—and therefore the justification for\n  the stop was objectively unreasonable. Reversing in turn, the State\n  Supreme Court held that, even assuming no violation of the state law\n  had occurred, Darisse’s mistaken understanding of the law was rea-\n  sonable, and thus the stop was valid.\nHeld: Because Darisse’s mistake of law was reasonable, there was rea-\n sonable suspicion justifying the stop under the Fourth Amendment.\n Pp. 4–13.\n    (a) The Fourth Amendment requires government officials to act\n reasonably, not perfectly, and gives those officials “fair leeway for en-\n forcing the law,” Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176.\n Searches and seizures based on mistakes of fact may be reasonable.\n See, e.g., Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177, 183–186. The limiting\n factor is that “the mistakes must be those of reasonable men.”\n Brinegar, supra, at 176. Mistakes of law are no less compatible with\n the concept of reasonable suspicion, which arises from an under-\n2                      HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    standing of both the facts and the relevant law. Whether an officer is\n    reasonably mistaken about the one or the other, the result is the\n    same: the facts are outside the scope of the law. And neither the\n    Fourth Amendment’s text nor this Court’s precedents offer any rea-\n    son why that result should not be acceptable when reached by a rea-\n    sonable mistake of law.\n       More than two centuries ago, this Court held that reasonable mis-\n    takes of law, like those of fact, could justify a certificate of probable\n    cause. United States v. Riddle, 5 Cranch 311, 313. That holding was\n    reiterated in numerous 19th-century decisions. Although Riddle was\n    not a Fourth Amendment case, it explained the concept of probable\n    cause, which this Court has said carried the same “fixed and well\n    known meaning” in the Fourth Amendment, Brinegar, supra, at 175,\n    and n. 14, and no subsequent decision of this Court has undermined\n    that understanding. The contrary conclusion would be hard to recon-\n    cile with the more recent precedent of Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443\n    U. S. 31, where the Court, addressing the validity of an arrest made\n    under a criminal law later declared unconstitutional, held that the of-\n    ficers’ reasonable assumption that the law was valid gave them\n    “abundant probable cause” to make the arrest, id., at 37. Heien at-\n    tempts to recast DeFillippo as a case solely about the exclusionary\n    rule, not the Fourth Amendment itself, but DeFillippo’s express hold-\n    ing is that the arrest was constitutionally valid because the officers\n    had probable cause. See id., at 40. Heien misplaces his reliance on\n    cases such as Davis v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, where any con-\n    sideration of reasonableness was limited to the separate matter of\n    remedy, not whether there was a Fourth Amendment violation in the\n    first place.\n       Heien contends that the rationale that permits reasonable errors of\n    fact does not extend to reasonable errors of law, arguing that officers\n    in the field deserve a margin of error when making factual assess-\n    ments on the fly. An officer may, however, also be suddenly confront-\n    ed with a situation requiring application of an unclear statute. This\n    Court’s holding does not discourage officers from learning the law.\n    Because the Fourth Amendment tolerates only objectively reasonable\n    mistakes, cf. Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 813, an officer\n    can gain no advantage through poor study. Finally, while the maxim\n    “Ignorance of the law is no excuse” correctly implies that the State\n    cannot impose punishment based on a mistake of law, it does not\n    mean a reasonable mistake of law cannot justify an investigatory\n    stop. Pp. 4–12.\n       (b) There is little difficulty in concluding that Officer Darisse’s er-\n    ror of law was reasonable. The North Carolina vehicle code that re-\n    quires “a stop lamp” also provides that the lamp “may be incorpo-\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

Although the State Court of\n  Appeals held that “rear lamps” do not include brake lights, the word\n  “other,” coupled with the lack of state-court precedent interpreting\n  the provision, made it objectively reasonable to think that a faulty\n  brake light constituted a violation.

NORTH \n\n                CAROLINA\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NORTH\n                      CAROLINA\n                              [December 15, 2014]\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  The Fourth Amendment prohibits “unreasonable\nsearches and seizures.” Under this standard, a search or\nseizure may be permissible even though the justification\nfor the action includes a reasonable factual mistake. An\nofficer might, for example, stop a motorist for traveling\nalone in a high-occupancy vehicle lane, only to discover\nupon approaching the car that two children are slumped\nover asleep in the back seat. The driver has not violated\nthe law, but neither has the officer violated the Fourth\nAmendment.\n  But what if the police officer’s reasonable mistake is not\none of fact but of law? In this case, an officer stopped a\nvehicle because one of its two brake lights was out, but a\ncourt later determined that a single working brake light\nwas all the law required. The question presented is\nwhether such a mistake of law can nonetheless give rise to\nthe reasonable suspicion necessary to uphold the seizure\nunder the Fourth Amendment. We hold that it can. Be-\ncause the officer’s mistake about the brake-light law was\n2                HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreasonable, the stop in this case was lawful under the\nFourth Amendment.\n                              I\n   On the morning of April 29, 2009, Sergeant Matt Da-\nrisse of the Surry County Sheriff ’s Department sat in his\npatrol car near Dobson, North Carolina, observing north-\nbound traffic on Interstate 77. Shortly before 8 a.m., a\nFord Escort passed by. Darisse thought the driver looked\n“very stiff and nervous,” so he pulled onto the interstate\nand began following the Escort. A few miles down the\nroad, the Escort braked as it approached a slower vehicle,\nbut only the left brake light came on. Noting the faulty\nright brake light, Darisse activated his vehicle’s lights and\npulled the Escort over. App. 4–7, 15–16.\n   Two men were in the car: Maynor Javier Vasquez sat\nbehind the wheel, and petitioner Nicholas Brady Heien lay\nacross the rear seat. Sergeant Darisse explained to\nVasquez that as long as his license and registration\nchecked out, he would receive only a warning ticket for the\nbroken brake light. A records check revealed no problems\nwith the documents, and Darisse gave Vasquez the warn-\ning ticket. But Darisse had become suspicious during the\ncourse of the stop—Vasquez appeared nervous, Heien\nremained lying down the entire time, and the two gave\ninconsistent answers about their destination. Darisse\nasked Vasquez if he would be willing to answer some\nquestions. Vasquez assented, and Darisse asked whether\nthe men were transporting various types of contraband.\nTold no, Darisse asked whether he could search the Es-\ncort. Vasquez said he had no objection, but told Darisse he\nshould ask Heien, because Heien owned the car. Heien\ngave his consent, and Darisse, aided by a fellow officer\nwho had since arrived, began a thorough search of the\nvehicle. In the side compartment of a duffle bag, Darisse\nfound a sandwich bag containing cocaine. The officers\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\narrested both men. 366 N. C. 271, 272–273, 737 S. E. 2d\n351, 352–353 (2012); App. 5–6, 25, 37.\n   The State charged Heien with attempted trafficking in\ncocaine. Heien moved to suppress the evidence seized\nfrom the car, contending that the stop and search had\nviolated the Fourth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution. After a hearing at which both officers testi-\nfied and the State played a video recording of the stop, the\ntrial court denied the suppression motion, concluding that\nthe faulty brake light had given Sergeant Darisse reason-\nable suspicion to initiate the stop, and that Heien’s subse-\nquent consent to the search was valid. Heien pleaded\nguilty but reserved his right to appeal the suppression\ndecision. App. 1, 7–10, 12, 29, 43–44.\n   The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed. 214\nN. C. App. 515, 714 S. E. 2d 827 (2011). The initial stop\nwas not valid, the court held, because driving with only\none working brake light was not actually a violation of\nNorth Carolina law. The relevant provision of the vehicle\ncode provides that a car must be\n    “equipped with a stop lamp on the rear of the vehicle.\n    The stop lamp shall display a red or amber light visi-\n    ble from a distance of not less than 100 feet to the\n    rear in normal sunlight, and shall be actuated upon\n    application of the service (foot) brake. The stop lamp\n    may be incorporated into a unit with one or more\n    other rear lamps.” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §20–129(g)\n    (2007).\n   Focusing on the statute’s references to “a stop lamp” and\n“[t]he stop lamp” in the singular, the court concluded that\na vehicle is required to have only one working brake\nlight—which Heien’s vehicle indisputably did. The justifi-\ncation for the stop was therefore “objectively unreason-\nable,” and the stop violated the Fourth Amendment. 214\nN. C. App., at 518–522, 714 S. E. 2d, at 829–831.\n4                HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The State appealed, and the North Carolina Supreme\nCourt reversed. 366 N. C. 271, 737 S. E. 2d 351. Noting\nthat the State had chosen not to seek review of the Court\nof Appeals’ interpretation of the vehicle code, the North\nCarolina Supreme Court assumed for purposes of its\ndecision that the faulty brake light was not a violation.\nId., at 275, 737 S. E. 2d, at 354. But the court concluded\nthat, for several reasons, Sergeant Darisse could have\nreasonably, even if mistakenly, read the vehicle code to\nrequire that both brake lights be in good working order.\nMost notably, a nearby code provision requires that “all\noriginally equipped rear lamps” be functional. Id., at 282–\n283, 737 S. E. 2d, at 358–359 (quoting N. C. Gen. Stat.\nAnn. §20–129(d)). Because Sergeant Darisse’s mistaken\nunderstanding of the vehicle code was reasonable, the stop\nwas valid. “An officer may make a mistake, including a\nmistake of law, yet still act reasonably under the circum-\nstances. . . . [W]hen an officer acts reasonably under the\ncircumstances, he is not violating the Fourth Amend-\nment.” Id., at 279, 737 S. E. 2d, at 356.\n   The North Carolina Supreme Court remanded to the\nCourt of Appeals to address Heien’s other arguments for\nsuppression (which are not at issue here). Id., at 283, 737\nS. E. 2d, at 359. The Court of Appeals rejected those\narguments and affirmed the trial court’s denial of his\nmotion to suppress. ___ N. C. App. ___, 741 S. E. 2d 1\n(2013). The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed in\nturn. 367 N. C. 163, 749 S. E. 2d 278 (2013). We granted\ncertiorari. 572 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                          II\n    The Fourth Amendment provides:\n       “The right of the people to be secure in their per-\n     sons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreason-\n     able searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\n     no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly\n    describing the place to be searched, and the persons or\n    things to be seized.”\n   A traffic stop for a suspected violation of law is a “sei-\nzure” of the occupants of the vehicle and therefore must be\nconducted in accordance with the Fourth Amendment.\nBrendlin v. California, 551 U. S. 249, 255–259 (2007). All\nparties agree that to justify this type of seizure, officers\nneed only “reasonable suspicion”—that is, “a particular-\nized and objective basis for suspecting the particular\nperson stopped” of breaking the law. Prado Navarette v.\nCalifornia, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 3) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). The question here is\nwhether reasonable suspicion can rest on a mistaken\nunderstanding of the scope of a legal prohibition. We hold\nthat it can.\n   As the text indicates and we have repeatedly affirmed,\n“the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\n‘reasonableness.’ ” Riley v. California, 573 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 5) (some internal quotation marks\nomitted). To be reasonable is not to be perfect, and so the\nFourth Amendment allows for some mistakes on the part\nof government officials, giving them “fair leeway for en-\nforcing the law in the community’s protection.” Brinegar\nv. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176 (1949). We have\nrecognized that searches and seizures based on mistakes\nof fact can be reasonable. The warrantless search of a\nhome, for instance, is reasonable if undertaken with the\nconsent of a resident, and remains lawful when officers\nobtain the consent of someone who reasonably appears to\nbe but is not in fact a resident. See Illinois v. Rodriguez,\n497 U. S. 177, 183–186 (1990). By the same token, if\nofficers with probable cause to arrest a suspect mistakenly\narrest an individual matching the suspect’s description,\nneither the seizure nor an accompanying search of the\n6               HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\narrestee would be unlawful. See Hill v. California, 401\nU. S. 797, 802–805 (1971). The limit is that “the mistakes\nmust be those of reasonable men.” Brinegar, supra, at\n176.\n  But reasonable men make mistakes of law, too, and such\nmistakes are no less compatible with the concept of rea-\nsonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion arises from the\ncombination of an officer’s understanding of the facts and\nhis understanding of the relevant law. The officer may be\nreasonably mistaken on either ground. Whether the facts\nturn out to be not what was thought, or the law turns out\nto be not what was thought, the result is the same: the\nfacts are outside the scope of the law. There is no reason,\nunder the text of the Fourth Amendment or our prece-\ndents, why this same result should be acceptable when\nreached by way of a reasonable mistake of fact, but not\nwhen reached by way of a similarly reasonable mistake of\nlaw.\n  The dissent counters that our cases discussing probable\ncause and reasonable suspicion, most notably Ornelas v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 690, 696–697 (1996), have con-\ntained “scarcely a peep” about mistakes of law. Post, at 2–3\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). It would have been surpris-\ning, of course, if they had, since none of those cases in-\nvolved a mistake of law.\n  Although such recent cases did not address mistakes of\nlaw, older precedents did. In fact, cases dating back two\ncenturies support treating legal and factual errors alike in\nthis context. Customs statutes enacted by Congress not\nlong after the founding authorized courts to issue certifi-\ncates indemnifying customs officers against damages suits\npremised on unlawful seizures. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 2,\n1799, ch. 22, §89, 1 Stat. 695–696. Courts were to issue\nsuch certificates on a showing that the officer had “rea-\nsonable cause”—a synonym for “probable cause”—for the\nchallenged seizure. Ibid.; see Stacey v. Emery, 97 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n642, 646 (1878); United States v. Riddle, 5 Cranch 311\n(1809). In United States v. Riddle, a customs officer seized\ngoods on the ground that the English shipper had violated\nthe customs laws by preparing an invoice that underval-\nued the merchandise, even though the American consignee\ndeclared the true value to the customs collector. Chief\nJustice Marshall held that there had been no violation of\nthe customs law because, whatever the shipper’s inten-\ntion, the consignee had not actually attempted to defraud\nthe Government. Nevertheless, because “the construction\nof the law was liable to some question,” he affirmed the\nissuance of a certificate of probable cause: “A doubt as to\nthe true construction of the law is as reasonable a cause\nfor seizure as a doubt respecting the fact.” Id., at 313.\n   This holding—that reasonable mistakes of law, like\nthose of fact, would justify certificates of probable cause—\nwas reiterated in a number of 19th-century decisions. See,\ne.g., The Friendship, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

By the Civil War, there had been “numerous cases\nin which [a] captured vessel was in no fault, and had not,\nunder a true construction of the law, presented even\nground of suspicion, and yet the captor was exonerated\nbecause he acted under an honest mistake of the law.”\nThe La Manche, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 972 (No. 8,004) (D Mass.\n1863).\n   Riddle and its progeny are not directly on point. Chief\nJustice Marshall was not construing the Fourth Amend-\nment, and a certificate of probable cause functioned much\nlike a modern-day finding of qualified immunity, which\ndepends on an inquiry distinct from whether an officer has\ncommitted a constitutional violation. See, e.g., Carroll v.\nCarman, ante, at 7 (per curiam). But Chief Justice Mar-\nshall was nevertheless explaining the concept of probable\n8                    HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncause, which, he noted elsewhere, “in all cases of seizure,\nhas a fixed and well known meaning. It imports a seizure\nmade under circumstances which warrant suspicion.”\nLocke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339, 348 (1813). We have\nsaid the phrase “probable cause” bore this “fixed and well\nknown meaning” in the Fourth Amendment, see Brinegar,\nsupra, at 175, and n. 14, and Riddle illustrates that it\nencompassed suspicion based on reasonable mistakes of\nboth fact and law. No decision of this Court in the two\ncenturies since has undermined that understanding.*\n   The contrary conclusion would be hard to reconcile with\na much more recent precedent. In Michigan v. DeFillippo,\n443 U. S. 31 (1979), we addressed the validity of an arrest\nmade under a criminal law later declared unconstitu-\ntional. A Detroit ordinance that authorized police officers\nto stop and question individuals suspected of criminal activ-\nity also made it an offense for such an individual “to refuse\nto identify himself and produce evidence of his identity.”\nId., at 33. Detroit police officers sent to investigate a\nreport of public intoxication arrested Gary DeFillippo after\nhe failed to identify himself. A search incident to arrest\nuncovered drugs, and DeFillippo was charged with posses-\nsion of a controlled substance. The Michigan Court of\nAppeals ordered the suppression of the drugs, concluding\nthat the identification ordinance was unconstitutionally\nvague and that DeFillippo’s arrest was therefore invalid.\nId., at 34–35.\n——————\n   * The dissent contends that “the tolerance of mistakes of law in cases\nlike Riddle was a result of the specific customs statute that Congress\nhad enacted.” Post, at 8, n. 3 (citing The Apollon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373\n(1824) (Story, J.)). The relevant portion of The Apollon, however,\naddressed “the effect of probable cause,” not what gave rise to it. Id., at\n372 (emphasis added); see id., at 376 (finding it “unnecessary” to decide\nwhether probable cause existed because it “would not, under the\ncircumstances of this case, constitute a valid defence”). Justice Story\nunderstandably did not cite Riddle or discuss its tolerance of mistakes\nof law anywhere in The Apollon.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Accepting the unconstitutionality of the ordinance as a\ngiven, we nonetheless reversed. At the time the officers\narrested DeFillippo, we explained, “there was no control-\nling precedent that this ordinance was or was not consti-\ntutional, and hence the conduct observed violated a pre-\nsumptively valid ordinance.” Id., at 37. Acknowledging\nthat the outcome might have been different had the ordi-\nnance been “grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional,” we\nconcluded that under the circumstances “there was abun-\ndant probable cause to satisfy the constitutional prerequi-\nsite for an arrest.” Id., at 37–38.\n   The officers were wrong in concluding that DeFillippo\nwas guilty of a criminal offense when he declined to iden-\ntify himself. That a court only later declared the ordinance\nunconstitutional does not change the fact that DeFillippo’s\nconduct was lawful when the officers observed it. See\nDanforth v. Minnesota, 552 U. S. 264, 271 (2008). But the\nofficers’ assumption that the law was valid was reason-\nable, and their observations gave them “abundant probable\ncause” to arrest DeFillippo. 443 U. S., at 37. Although\nDeFillippo could not be prosecuted under the identifica-\ntion ordinance, the search that turned up the drugs was\nconstitutional.\n   Heien struggles to recast DeFillippo as a case solely\nabout the exclusionary rule, not the Fourth Amendment\nitself. In his view, the officers’ mistake of law resulted in\na violation the Fourth Amendment, but suppression of the\ndrugs was not the proper remedy. We did say in a footnote\nthat suppression of the evidence found on DeFillippo\nwould serve none of the purposes of the exclusionary rule.\nSee id., at 38, n. 3. But that literally marginal discussion\ndoes not displace our express holding that the arrest was\nconstitutionally valid because the officers had probable\ncause. See id., at 40. Nor, contrary to Heien’s suggestion,\ndid either United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984), or\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213 (1983), somehow erase that\n10               HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nholding and transform DeFillippo into an exclusionary\nrule decision. See Brief for Petitioner 28–29. In Leon, we\nsaid DeFillippo paid “attention to the purposes underlying\nthe exclusionary rule,” but we also clarified that it did “not\ninvolv[e] the scope of the rule itself.” 468 U. S., at 911–\n912. As for Gates, only Justice White’s separate opinion\n(joined by no other Justice) discussed DeFillippo, and it\nacknowledged that “DeFillippo did not modify the exclu-\nsionary rule itself ” but instead “upheld the validity of an\narrest.” 462 U. S., at 256, n. 12 (opinion concurring in\njudgment).\n   Heien is correct that in a number of decisions we have\nlooked to the reasonableness of an officer’s legal error in\nthe course of considering the appropriate remedy for a\nconstitutional violation, instead of whether there was a\nviolation at all. See, e.g., Davis v. United States, 564 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11) (exclusionary rule); Illinois\nv. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 359–360 (1987) (exclusionary rule);\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 615 (1999) (qualified im-\nmunity); Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 641 (1987)\n(qualified immunity). In those cases, however, we had\nalready found or assumed a Fourth Amendment violation.\nAn officer’s mistaken view that the conduct at issue did\nnot give rise to such a violation—no matter how reason-\nable—could not change that ultimate conclusion. See Brief\nfor Respondent 29–31; Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 30, n. 3. Any consideration of the reasonableness\nof an officer’s mistake was therefore limited to the sepa-\nrate matter of remedy.\n   Here, by contrast, the mistake of law relates to the\nantecedent question of whether it was reasonable for an\nofficer to suspect that the defendant’s conduct was illegal.\nIf so, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment in\nthe first place. None of the cases Heien or the dissent\ncites precludes a court from considering a reasonable\nmistake of law in addressing that question. Cf. Herring v.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States, 555 U. S. 135, 139 (2009) (assuming a\nFourth Amendment violation while rejecting application of\nthe exclusionary rule, but noting that “[w]hen a probable-\ncause determination was based on reasonable but mis-\ntaken assumptions, the person subjected to a search or\nseizure has not necessarily been the victim of a constitu-\ntional violation”).\n   Heien also contends that the reasons the Fourth\nAmendment allows some errors of fact do not extend to\nerrors of law. Officers in the field must make factual\nassessments on the fly, Heien notes, and so deserve a\nmargin of error. In Heien’s view, no such margin is ap-\npropriate for questions of law: The statute here either\nrequires one working brake light or two, and the answer\ndoes not turn on anything “an officer might suddenly\nconfront in the field.” Brief for Petitioner 21. But Heien’s\npoint does not consider the reality that an officer may\n“suddenly confront” a situation in the field as to which the\napplication of a statute is unclear—however clear it may\nlater become. A law prohibiting “vehicles” in the park\neither covers Segways or not, see A. Scalia & B. Garner,\nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 36–38\n(2012), but an officer will nevertheless have to make a\nquick decision on the law the first time one whizzes by.\n   Contrary to the suggestion of Heien and amici, our\ndecision does not discourage officers from learning the\nlaw. The Fourth Amendment tolerates only reasonable\nmistakes, and those mistakes—whether of fact or of law—\nmust be objectively reasonable. We do not examine the\nsubjective understanding of the particular officer involved.\nCf. Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 813 (1996). And\nthe inquiry is not as forgiving as the one employed in the\ndistinct context of deciding whether an officer is entitled to\nqualified immunity for a constitutional or statutory viola-\ntion. Thus, an officer can gain no Fourth Amendment\nadvantage through a sloppy study of the laws he is duty-\n12              HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbound to enforce.\n   Finally, Heien and amici point to the well-known maxim,\n“Ignorance of the law is no excuse,” and contend that it\nis fundamentally unfair to let police officers get away with\nmistakes of law when the citizenry is accorded no such\nleeway. Though this argument has a certain rhetorical\nappeal, it misconceives the implication of the maxim. The\ntrue symmetry is this: Just as an individual generally\ncannot escape criminal liability based on a mistaken\nunderstanding of the law, so too the government cannot\nimpose criminal liability based on a mistaken understand-\ning of the law. If the law required two working brake\nlights, Heien could not escape a ticket by claiming he\nreasonably thought he needed only one; if the law required\nonly one, Sergeant Darisse could not issue a valid ticket by\nclaiming he reasonably thought drivers needed two. But\njust because mistakes of law cannot justify either the\nimposition or the avoidance of criminal liability, it does\nnot follow that they cannot justify an investigatory stop.\nAnd Heien is not appealing a brake-light ticket; he is\nappealing a cocaine-trafficking conviction as to which\nthere is no asserted mistake of fact or law.\n                            III\n   Here we have little difficulty concluding that the of-\nficer’s error of law was reasonable. Although the North\nCarolina statute at issue refers to “a stop lamp,” suggest-\ning the need for only a single working brake light, it also\nprovides that “[t]he stop lamp may be incorporated into a\nunit with one or more other rear lamps.” N. C. Gen. Stat.\nAnn. §20–129(g) (emphasis added). The use of “other”\nsuggests to the everyday reader of English that a “stop\nlamp” is a type of “rear lamp.” And another subsection of\nthe same provision requires that vehicles “have all origi-\nnally equipped rear lamps or the equivalent in good work-\ning order,” §20–129(d), arguably indicating that if a vehi-\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncle has multiple “stop lamp[s],” all must be functional.\n   The North Carolina Court of Appeals concluded that the\n“rear lamps” discussed in subsection (d) do not include\nbrake lights, but, given the “other,” it would at least have\nbeen reasonable to think they did. Both the majority and\nthe dissent in the North Carolina Supreme Court so con-\ncluded, and we agree. See 366 N. C., at 282–283, 737 S. E.\n2d, at 358–359; id., at 283, 737 S. E. 2d, at 359 (Hudson,\nJ., dissenting) (calling the Court of Appeals’ decision\n“surprising”). This “stop lamp” provision, moreover, had\nnever been previously construed by North Carolina’s\nappellate courts. See id., at 283, 737 S. E. 2d, at 359\n(majority opinion). It was thus objectively reasonable for\nan officer in Sergeant Darisse’s position to think that\nHeien’s faulty right brake light was a violation of North\nCarolina law. And because the mistake of law was rea-\nsonable, there was reasonable suspicion justifying the\nstop.\n   The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina is\n                                                   Affirmed.\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

In doing so, the Court correctly emphasizes\nthat the “Fourth Amendment tolerates only . . . objectively\nreasonable” mistakes of law. Ante, at 11. And the Court\nmakes clear that the inquiry into whether an officer’s\nmistake of law counts as objectively reasonable “is not as\nforgiving as the one employed in the distinct context of\ndeciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified immun-\nity.” Ibid. I write separately to elaborate briefly on those\nimportant limitations.1\n   First, an officer’s “subjective understanding” is irrele-\nvant: As the Court notes, “[w]e do not examine” it at all.\n——————\n   1 I note in addition, as does the Court, that one kind of mistaken legal\n\njudgment—an error about the contours of the Fourth Amendment\nitself—can never support a search or seizure. See ante, at 10 (“An\nofficer’s mistaken view that” conduct does “not give rise to” a Fourth\nAmendment violation, “no matter how reasonable,” cannot change a\ncourt’s “ultimate conclusion” that such a violation has occurred). As the\nSolicitor General has explained, mistakes about the requirements of\nthe Fourth Amendment “violate the Fourth Amendment even when\nthey are reasonable.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 30, n. 3;\nsee Brief for Respondent 29 (stating the same view).\n2               HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                    KAGAN, J., concurring\n\nIbid. That means the government cannot defend an of-\nficer’s mistaken legal interpretation on the ground that\nthe officer was unaware of or untrained in the law. And it\nmeans that, contrary to the dissenting opinion in the court\nbelow, an officer’s reliance on “an incorrect memo or train-\ning program from the police department” makes no differ-\nence to the analysis. 366 N. C. 271, 284, 737 S. E. 2d 351,\n360 (2012) (Hudson, J., dissenting). Those considerations\npertain to the officer’s subjective understanding of the law\nand thus cannot help to justify a seizure.\n   Second, the inquiry the Court permits today is more\ndemanding than the one courts undertake before awarding\nqualified immunity. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 51 (Solicitor\nGeneral stating that the two tests “require essentially the\nopposite” showings); Brief for Respondent 31–32 (making\na similar point). Our modern qualified immunity doctrine\nprotects “all but the plainly incompetent or those who\nknowingly violate the law.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting Malley v. Briggs,\n475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986)).

Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 826 (No. 5,125)\n(CC Mass. 1812) (cited ante, at 7), suggests the appropri-\nate standard for deciding when a legal error can support a\nseizure: when an officer takes a reasonable view of a “vex-\nata questio” on which different judges “h[o]ld opposite\nopinions.” See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n26 (invoking that language). Or to make the same point\nwithout the Latin, the test is satisfied when the law at\nissue is “so doubtful in construction” that a reasonable\njudge could agree with the officer’s view. The Friendship,\n9 F. Cas., at 826.\n   A court tasked with deciding whether an officer’s mis-\ntake of law can support a seizure thus faces a straightfor-\nward question of statutory construction. If the statute is\ngenuinely ambiguous, such that overturning the officer’s\njudgment requires hard interpretive work, then the officer\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

As the\nSolicitor General made the point at oral argument, the\nstatute must pose a “really difficult” or “very hard ques-\ntion of statutory interpretation.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 50. And\nindeed, both North Carolina and the Solicitor General\nagreed that such cases will be “exceedingly rare.” Brief for\nRespondent 17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 48.\n   The Court’s analysis of Sergeant Darisse’s interpreta-\ntion of the North Carolina law at issue here appropriately\nreflects these principles. As the Court explains, see ante,\nat 12–13, the statute requires every car on the highway to\nhave “a stop lamp,” in the singular. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n§20–129(g) (2007). But the statute goes on to state that a\nstop lamp (or, in more modern terminology, brake light)\n“may be incorporated into a unit with one or more other\nrear lamps,” suggesting that a stop lamp itself qualifies as\na rear lamp. Ibid. (emphasis added). And the statute\nfurther mandates that every car have “all originally\nequipped rear lamps . . . in good working order.” §20–\n129(d) (emphasis added). The North Carolina Court of\nAppeals dealt with the statute’s conflicting signals in one\nway (deciding that a brake light is not a rear lamp, and so\nonly one needs to work); but a court could easily take the\nofficer’s view (deciding that a brake light is a rear lamp,\nand if a car comes equipped with more than one, as mod-\nern cars do, all must be in working order). The critical\npoint is that the statute poses a quite difficult question of\ninterpretation, and Sergeant Darisse’s judgment, although\noverturned, had much to recommend it. I therefore agree\nwith the Court that the traffic stop he conducted did not\nviolate the Fourth Amendment.\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

California, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 5). But this broad statement simply sets the stand-\nard a court is to apply when it conducts its inquiry into\nwhether the Fourth Amendment has been violated. It\ndoes not define the categories of inputs that courts are to\nconsider when assessing the reasonableness of a search or\nseizure, each of which must be independently justified.\nWhat this case requires us to decide is whether a police\nofficer’s understanding of the law is an input into the\nreasonableness inquiry, or whether this inquiry instead\ntakes the law as a given and assesses an officer’s under-\nstanding of the facts against a fixed legal yardstick.\n  I would hold that determining whether a search or\nseizure is reasonable requires evaluating an officer’s un-\nderstanding of the facts against the actual state of the law.\nI would accordingly reverse the judgment of the North\nCarolina Supreme Court, and I respectfully dissent from\nthe Court’s contrary holding.\n                         I\n It is common ground that Heien was seized within the\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment. Such a seizure com-\n2                HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nports with the Constitution only if the officers had articu-\nlable and reasonable suspicion that Heien was breaking\nthe law. In Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696\n(1996), we explained that the “principal components” of\nthat determination “will be the events which occurred\nleading up to the stop or search, and then the decision\nwhether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint\nof an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to rea-\nsonable suspicion or to probable cause.” We described this\nkind of determination as “a mixed question of law and\nfact”: “ ‘[T]he issue is whether the facts satisfy the [rele-\nvant] statutory [or constitutional] standard, or to put it\nanother way, whether the rule of law as applied to the\nestablished facts is or is not violated.’ ” Id., at 696–697\n(quoting Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S 273, 289,\nn. 19 (1982)). What matters, we said, are the facts as\nviewed by an objectively reasonable officer, and the rule of\nlaw—not an officer’s conception of the rule of law, and not\neven an officer’s reasonable misunderstanding about the\nlaw, but the law.\n   As a result, when we have talked about the leeway that\nofficers have in making probable-cause determinations, we\nhave focused on their assessments of facts. See, e.g., Terry\nv. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–22 (1968) (framing the question as\nwhether the “facts” give rise to reasonable suspicion). We\nhave conceded that an arresting officer’s state of mind\ndoes not factor into the probable-cause inquiry, “except for\nthe facts that he knows.” Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U. S.\n146, 153 (2004) (emphasis added). And we have said that,\nto satisfy the reasonableness requirement, “what is gener-\nally demanded of the many factual determinations that\nmust regularly be made by agents of the government . . . is\nnot that they always be correct, but that they always be\nreasonable.” Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177, 185\n(1990) (emphasis added). There is scarcely a peep in these\ncases to suggest that an officer’s understanding or concep-\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntion of anything other than the facts is relevant.\n   This framing of the reasonableness inquiry has not only\nbeen focused on officers’ understanding of the facts, it has\nbeen justified in large part based on the recognition that\nofficers are generally in a superior position, relative to\ncourts, to evaluate those facts and their significance as\nthey unfold. In other words, the leeway we afford officers’\nfactual assessments is rooted not only in our recognition\nthat police officers operating in the field have to make\nquick decisions, see id., at 186, but also in our understand-\ning that police officers have the expertise to “dra[w] infer-\nences and mak[e] deductions . . . that might well elude an\nuntrained person.” United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411,\n418 (1981). When officers evaluate unfolding circum-\nstances, they deploy that expertise to draw “conclusions\nabout human behavior” much in the way that “jurors [do]\nas factfinders.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   The same cannot be said about legal exegesis. After all,\nthe meaning of the law is not probabilistic in the same\nway that factual determinations are. Rather, “the notion\nthat the law is definite and knowable” sits at the founda-\ntion of our legal system. Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S.\n192, 199 (1991). And it is courts, not officers, that are in\nthe best position to interpret the laws.\n   Both our enunciation of the reasonableness inquiry and\nour justification for it thus have always turned on an\nofficer’s factual conclusions and an officer’s expertise with\nrespect to those factual conclusions. Neither has hinted at\ntaking into account an officer’s understanding of the law,\nreasonable or otherwise.\n                             II\n  Departing from this tradition means further eroding the\nFourth Amendment’s protection of civil liberties in a\ncontext where that protection has already been worn\ndown. Traffic stops like those at issue here can be “annoy-\n4                HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ning, frightening, and perhaps humiliating.” Terry, 392\nU. S., at 25; see Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 657\n(1979). We have nevertheless held that an officer’s subjec-\ntive motivations do not render a traffic stop unlawful.\nWhren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806 (1996). But we\nassumed in Whren that when an officer acts on pretext, at\nleast that pretext would be the violation of an actual law.\nSee id., at 810 (discussing the three provisions of the\nDistrict of Columbia traffic code that the parties accepted\nthe officer had probable cause to believe had been vio-\nlated). Giving officers license to effect seizures so long as\nthey can attach to their reasonable view of the facts some\nreasonable legal interpretation (or misinterpretation) that\nsuggests a law has been violated significantly expands this\nauthority. Cf. Barlow v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 411\n(1833) (Story, J.) (“There is scarcely any law which does\nnot admit of some ingenious doubt”). One wonders how a\ncitizen seeking to be law-abiding and to structure his or\nher behavior to avoid these invasive, frightening, and\nhumiliating encounters could do so.\n   In addition to these human consequences—including\nthose for communities and for their relationships with the\npolice—permitting mistakes of law to justify seizures has\nthe perverse effect of preventing or delaying the clarifica-\ntion of the law. Under such an approach, courts need not\ninterpret statutory language but can instead simply decide\nwhether an officer’s interpretation was reasonable. In-\ndeed, had this very case arisen after the North Carolina\nSupreme Court announced its rule, the North Carolina\nCourt of Appeals would not have had the occasion to in-\nterpret the statute at issue. Similarly, courts in the\nEighth Circuit, which has been the only Circuit to include\npolice mistakes of law in the reasonableness inquiry, have\nobserved that they need not decide interpretive questions\nunder their approach. See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez-\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

Cf. Camreta v. Greene, 563\nU.

But I have not seen any persuasive\nargument that law enforcement will be unduly hampered\nby a rule that precludes consideration of mistakes of law\nin the reasonableness inquiry.

If an officer makes a\nstop in good faith but it turns out that, as in this case, the\nofficer was wrong about what the law proscribed or re-\nquired, I know of no penalty that the officer would suffer.\nSee 366 N.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n  In short, there is nothing in our case law requiring us to\nhold that a reasonable mistake of law can justify a seizure\nunder the Fourth Amendment, and quite a bit suggesting\njust the opposite. I also see nothing to be gained from\nsuch a holding, and much to be lost.\n                             III\n  In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court makes\nboth serious legal and practical errors. On the legal side,\nthe Court barely addresses Ornelas and the other cases\nthat frame the reasonableness inquiry around factual\ndeterminations. Instead, in support of its conclusion that\nreasonable suspicion “arises from the combination of an\nofficer’s understanding of the facts and his understanding\nof the relevant law,” ante, at 6 (emphasis added), the\nCourt first reaches to founding-era customs statutes and\ncases applying those statutes. It concedes, however, that\nthese cases are “not directly on point” because they say\nnothing about the scope of the Fourth Amendment and are\ninstead equivalents of our modern-day qualified immunity\njurisprudence for civil damages. Ante, at 7.\n   The only link in the tenuous chain the Court constructs\nbetween those cases and this one that has anything to say\nabout the Fourth Amendment is Brinegar v. United States,\n338 U. S. 160 (1949). See ante, at 8. But all that our\nopinion in Brinegar actually says is that probable cause\nexists where “ ‘the facts and circumstances within [the\nofficers’] knowledge and of which they had reasonably\ntrustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to\nwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that’ an\noffense has been or is being committed.” 338 U. S., at\n175–176 (quoting Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132,\n162 (1925)). It thus states the uncontroversial proposition\nthat the probable-cause inquiry looks to the reasonable-\n8                   HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nness of an officer’s understanding of the facts. Indeed,\nBrinegar is an odd case for the Court to rely on given that,\nlike the cases I discussed above, it subsequently empha-\nsizes that “the mistakes must be those of reasonable men,\nacting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of\nprobability.” 338 U. S., at 176 (emphasis added). Again,\nreasonable understandings of the facts, not reasonable\nunderstandings of what the law says.3\n    Further, the Court looks to our decision in Michigan v.\nDeFillippo, 443 U. S. 31 (1979). This is a Fourth Amend-\nment case, but the Court’s reading of it imagines a holding\nthat is not rooted in the logic of the opinion. We held in\nDeFillippo that an officer had probable cause to support\nan arrest even though the ordinance that had allegedly\nbeen violated was later held by the Michigan Court of\nAppeals to be unconstitutional. This was so, we explained,\nbecause the officer conducted an arrest after having ob-\nserved conduct that was criminalized by a presumptively\nvalid law at the time of that conduct. See id., at 37 (“At\nth[e] time [of the arrest], of course, there was no control-\nling precedent that this ordinance was or was not consti-\ntutional, and hence the conduct observed violated a pre-\nsumptively valid ordinance”). We noted that it would have\nbeen wrong for that officer not to enforce the law in that sit-\nuation. See id., at 38 (“Police are charged to enforce laws\nuntil and unless they are declared unconstitutional.\n . . . Society would be ill-served if its police officers took\n\n——————\n  3 The Court in fact errs even earlier in the chain when it represents\n\nUnited States v. Riddle, 5 Cranch 311 (1809), as containing some broad\nproposition. Ante, at 6–7. As Justice Story explained in a later case,\nthe tolerance of mistakes of law in cases like Riddle was a result of the\nspecific customs statute that Congress had enacted. The Apollon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373 (1824) (explaining that findings of probable cause\n“ha[d] never been supposed to excuse any seizure, except where some\nstatute creates and defines the exemption from damages” (emphasis\nadded)).\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Rather, DeFillippo involved a police officer correctly\napplying the law that was then in existence and that\ncarried with it a presumption of validity. Here, by con-\ntrast, police stopped Heien on suspicion of committing an\noffense that never actually existed. Given that our hold-\ning in DeFillippo relied so squarely on the existence of a\nlaw criminalizing the defendant’s conduct, and on the\npresumption of validity that attends actual laws, it can\nhardly be said to control where, as here, no law ever actu-\nally criminalized Heien’s conduct.\n   On the practical side, the Court primarily contends that\nan officer may confront “a situation in the field as to which\nthe application of a statute is unclear.” Ante, at 11. One\nis left to wonder, however, why an innocent citizen should\nbe made to shoulder the burden of being seized whenever\nthe law may be susceptible to an interpretive question.\nMoreover, the Court fails to reconcile its belief that the\nFourth Amendment gives officers leeway to address situa-\ntions where the application of a criminal statute may be\nunclear with our prior assumption that the Fourth\nAmendment does not give officers such leeway where they\nrely on a statute that authorizes police conduct that may\nviolate the Fourth Amendment. See Illinois v. Krull, 480\nU. S. 340, 355, n. 12, 359 (1987). Nor does it engage with\nthe analytic consequences of North Carolina’s similar\nconcession that it does not mean to claim “that an officer’s\nmistaken understanding of the Fourth Amendment itself\ncan support a seizure if that understanding was reason-\nable.” Brief for Respondent 29. It is not clear why an\nofficer’s mistaken understanding of other laws should be\nviewed differently.\n   While I appreciate that the Court has endeavored to set\nsome bounds on the types of mistakes of law that it thinks\n10               HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwill qualify as reasonable, and while I think that the set of\nreasonable mistakes of law ought to be narrowly circum-\nscribed if they are to be countenanced at all, I am not at\nall convinced that the Court has done so in a clear way. It\nseems to me that the difference between qualified immun-\nity’s reasonableness standard—which the Court insists\nwithout elaboration does not apply here—and the Court’s\nconception of reasonableness in this context—which re-\nmains undefined—will prove murky in application. See\nante, at 11. I fear the Court’s unwillingness to sketch a\nfuller view of what makes a mistake of law reasonable\nonly presages the likely difficulty that courts will have\napplying the Court’s decision in this case.\n                       *      *     *\n  To my mind, the more administrable approach—and the\none more consistent with our precedents and principles—\nwould be to hold that an officer’s mistake of law, no matter\nhow reasonable, cannot support the individualized suspi-\ncion necessary to justify a seizure under the Fourth\nAmendment.

NORTH CAROLINA\n\n CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  No. 13–604.      Argued October 6, 2014—Decided December 15, 2014\nFollowing a suspicious vehicle, Sergeant Matt Darisse noticed that only\n  one of the vehicle’s brake lights was working and pulled the driver\n  over. While issuing a warning ticket for the broken brake light, Dar-\n  isse became suspicious of the actions of the two occupants and their\n  answers to his questions. Petitioner Nicholas Brady Heien, the car’s\n  owner, gave Darisse consent to search the vehicle. Darisse found co-\n  caine, and Heien was arrested and charged with attempted traffick-\n  ing. The trial court denied Heien’s motion to suppress the seized evi-\n  dence on Fourth Amendment grounds, concluding that the vehicle’s\n  faulty brake light gave Darisse reasonable suspicion to initiate the\n  stop. The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the\n  relevant code provision, which requires that a car be “equipped with\n  a stop lamp,” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §20–129(g), requires only a single\n  lamp—which Heien’s vehicle had—and therefore the justification for\n  the stop was objectively unreasonable. Reversing in turn, the State\n  Supreme Court held that, even assuming no violation of the state law\n  had occurred, Darisse’s mistaken understanding of the law was rea-\n  sonable, and thus the stop was valid.\nHeld: Because Darisse’s mistake of law was reasonable, there was rea-\n sonable suspicion justifying the stop under the Fourth Amendment.\n Pp. 4–13.\n    (a) The Fourth Amendment requires government officials to act\n reasonably, not perfectly, and gives those officials “fair leeway for en-\n forcing the law,” Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176.\n Searches and seizures based on mistakes of fact may be reasonable.\n See, e.g., Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177, 183–186. The limiting\n factor is that “the mistakes must be those of reasonable men.”\n Brinegar, supra, at 176. Mistakes of law are no less compatible with\n the concept of reasonable suspicion, which arises from an under-\n2                      HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    standing of both the facts and the relevant law. Whether an officer is\n    reasonably mistaken about the one or the other, the result is the\n    same: the facts are outside the scope of the law. And neither the\n    Fourth Amendment’s text nor this Court’s precedents offer any rea-\n    son why that result should not be acceptable when reached by a rea-\n    sonable mistake of law.\n       More than two centuries ago, this Court held that reasonable mis-\n    takes of law, like those of fact, could justify a certificate of probable\n    cause. United States v. Riddle, 5 Cranch 311, 313. That holding was\n    reiterated in numerous 19th-century decisions. Although Riddle was\n    not a Fourth Amendment case, it explained the concept of probable\n    cause, which this Court has said carried the same “fixed and well\n    known meaning” in the Fourth Amendment, Brinegar, supra, at 175,\n    and n. 14, and no subsequent decision of this Court has undermined\n    that understanding. The contrary conclusion would be hard to recon-\n    cile with the more recent precedent of Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443\n    U. S. 31, where the Court, addressing the validity of an arrest made\n    under a criminal law later declared unconstitutional, held that the of-\n    ficers’ reasonable assumption that the law was valid gave them\n    “abundant probable cause” to make the arrest, id., at 37. Heien at-\n    tempts to recast DeFillippo as a case solely about the exclusionary\n    rule, not the Fourth Amendment itself, but DeFillippo’s express hold-\n    ing is that the arrest was constitutionally valid because the officers\n    had probable cause. See id., at 40. Heien misplaces his reliance on\n    cases such as Davis v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, where any con-\n    sideration of reasonableness was limited to the separate matter of\n    remedy, not whether there was a Fourth Amendment violation in the\n    first place.\n       Heien contends that the rationale that permits reasonable errors of\n    fact does not extend to reasonable errors of law, arguing that officers\n    in the field deserve a margin of error when making factual assess-\n    ments on the fly. An officer may, however, also be suddenly confront-\n    ed with a situation requiring application of an unclear statute. This\n    Court’s holding does not discourage officers from learning the law.\n    Because the Fourth Amendment tolerates only objectively reasonable\n    mistakes, cf. Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 813, an officer\n    can gain no advantage through poor study. Finally, while the maxim\n    “Ignorance of the law is no excuse” correctly implies that the State\n    cannot impose punishment based on a mistake of law, it does not\n    mean a reasonable mistake of law cannot justify an investigatory\n    stop. Pp. 4–12.\n       (b) There is little difficulty in concluding that Officer Darisse’s er-\n    ror of law was reasonable.

An\nofficer might, for example, stop a motorist for traveling\nalone in a high-occupancy vehicle lane, only to discover\nupon approaching the car that two children are slumped\nover asleep in the back seat. The driver has not violated\nthe law, but neither has the officer violated the Fourth\nAmendment.\n  But what if the police officer’s reasonable mistake is not\none of fact but of law? In this case, an officer stopped a\nvehicle because one of its two brake lights was out, but a\ncourt later determined that a single working brake light\nwas all the law required. The question presented is\nwhether such a mistake of law can nonetheless give rise to\nthe reasonable suspicion necessary to uphold the seizure\nunder the Fourth Amendment. We hold that it can.

NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreasonable, the stop in this case was lawful under the\nFourth Amendment.\n                              I\n   On the morning of April 29, 2009, Sergeant Matt Da-\nrisse of the Surry County Sheriff ’s Department sat in his\npatrol car near Dobson, North Carolina, observing north-\nbound traffic on Interstate 77. Shortly before 8 a.m., a\nFord Escort passed by. Darisse thought the driver looked\n“very stiff and nervous,” so he pulled onto the interstate\nand began following the Escort. A few miles down the\nroad, the Escort braked as it approached a slower vehicle,\nbut only the left brake light came on. Noting the faulty\nright brake light, Darisse activated his vehicle’s lights and\npulled the Escort over. App. 4–7, 15–16.\n   Two men were in the car: Maynor Javier Vasquez sat\nbehind the wheel, and petitioner Nicholas Brady Heien lay\nacross the rear seat. Sergeant Darisse explained to\nVasquez that as long as his license and registration\nchecked out, he would receive only a warning ticket for the\nbroken brake light. A records check revealed no problems\nwith the documents, and Darisse gave Vasquez the warn-\ning ticket. But Darisse had become suspicious during the\ncourse of the stop—Vasquez appeared nervous, Heien\nremained lying down the entire time, and the two gave\ninconsistent answers about their destination. Darisse\nasked Vasquez if he would be willing to answer some\nquestions. Vasquez assented, and Darisse asked whether\nthe men were transporting various types of contraband.\nTold no, Darisse asked whether he could search the Es-\ncort. Vasquez said he had no objection, but told Darisse he\nshould ask Heien, because Heien owned the car. Heien\ngave his consent, and Darisse, aided by a fellow officer\nwho had since arrived, began a thorough search of the\nvehicle. In the side compartment of a duffle bag, Darisse\nfound a sandwich bag containing cocaine. The officers\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\narrested both men. 366 N. C. 271, 272–273, 737 S. E. 2d\n351, 352–353 (2012); App. 5–6, 25, 37.\n   The State charged Heien with attempted trafficking in\ncocaine. Heien moved to suppress the evidence seized\nfrom the car, contending that the stop and search had\nviolated the Fourth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution. After a hearing at which both officers testi-\nfied and the State played a video recording of the stop, the\ntrial court denied the suppression motion, concluding that\nthe faulty brake light had given Sergeant Darisse reason-\nable suspicion to initiate the stop, and that Heien’s subse-\nquent consent to the search was valid. Heien pleaded\nguilty but reserved his right to appeal the suppression\ndecision. App. 1, 7–10, 12, 29, 43–44.\n   The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed. 214\nN. C. App. 515, 714 S. E. 2d 827 (2011). The initial stop\nwas not valid, the court held, because driving with only\none working brake light was not actually a violation of\nNorth Carolina law. The relevant provision of the vehicle\ncode provides that a car must be\n    “equipped with a stop lamp on the rear of the vehicle.\n    The stop lamp shall display a red or amber light visi-\n    ble from a distance of not less than 100 feet to the\n    rear in normal sunlight, and shall be actuated upon\n    application of the service (foot) brake. The stop lamp\n    may be incorporated into a unit with one or more\n    other rear lamps.” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §20–129(g)\n    (2007).\n   Focusing on the statute’s references to “a stop lamp” and\n“[t]he stop lamp” in the singular, the court concluded that\na vehicle is required to have only one working brake\nlight—which Heien’s vehicle indisputably did. The justifi-\ncation for the stop was therefore “objectively unreason-\nable,” and the stop violated the Fourth Amendment. 214\nN. C. App., at 518–522, 714 S. E. 2d, at 829–831.\n4                HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The State appealed, and the North Carolina Supreme\nCourt reversed. 366 N. C. 271, 737 S. E. 2d 351. Noting\nthat the State had chosen not to seek review of the Court\nof Appeals’ interpretation of the vehicle code, the North\nCarolina Supreme Court assumed for purposes of its\ndecision that the faulty brake light was not a violation.\nId., at 275, 737 S. E. 2d, at 354. But the court concluded\nthat, for several reasons, Sergeant Darisse could have\nreasonably, even if mistakenly, read the vehicle code to\nrequire that both brake lights be in good working order.\nMost notably, a nearby code provision requires that “all\noriginally equipped rear lamps” be functional. Id., at 282–\n283, 737 S. E. 2d, at 358–359 (quoting N. C. Gen. Stat.\nAnn. §20–129(d)). Because Sergeant Darisse’s mistaken\nunderstanding of the vehicle code was reasonable, the stop\nwas valid. “An officer may make a mistake, including a\nmistake of law, yet still act reasonably under the circum-\nstances. . . . [W]hen an officer acts reasonably under the\ncircumstances, he is not violating the Fourth Amend-\nment.” Id., at 279, 737 S. E. 2d, at 356.\n   The North Carolina Supreme Court remanded to the\nCourt of Appeals to address Heien’s other arguments for\nsuppression (which are not at issue here). Id., at 283, 737\nS. E. 2d, at 359. The Court of Appeals rejected those\narguments and affirmed the trial court’s denial of his\nmotion to suppress. ___ N. C. App. ___, 741 S. E. 2d 1\n(2013).

S. ___ (2014).\n                          II\n    The Fourth Amendment provides:\n       “The right of the people to be secure in their per-\n     sons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreason-\n     able searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\n     no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly\n    describing the place to be searched, and the persons or\n    things to be seized.”\n   A traffic stop for a suspected violation of law is a “sei-\nzure” of the occupants of the vehicle and therefore must be\nconducted in accordance with the Fourth Amendment.\nBrendlin v. California, 551 U. S. 249, 255–259 (2007). All\nparties agree that to justify this type of seizure, officers\nneed only “reasonable suspicion”—that is, “a particular-\nized and objective basis for suspecting the particular\nperson stopped” of breaking the law. Prado Navarette v.\nCalifornia, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 3) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). The question here is\nwhether reasonable suspicion can rest on a mistaken\nunderstanding of the scope of a legal prohibition. We hold\nthat it can.\n   As the text indicates and we have repeatedly affirmed,\n“the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\n‘reasonableness.’ ” Riley v. California, 573 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 5) (some internal quotation marks\nomitted). To be reasonable is not to be perfect, and so the\nFourth Amendment allows for some mistakes on the part\nof government officials, giving them “fair leeway for en-\nforcing the law in the community’s protection.” Brinegar\nv. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176 (1949). We have\nrecognized that searches and seizures based on mistakes\nof fact can be reasonable. The warrantless search of a\nhome, for instance, is reasonable if undertaken with the\nconsent of a resident, and remains lawful when officers\nobtain the consent of someone who reasonably appears to\nbe but is not in fact a resident. See Illinois v. Rodriguez,\n497 U. S. 177, 183–186 (1990). By the same token, if\nofficers with probable cause to arrest a suspect mistakenly\narrest an individual matching the suspect’s description,\nneither the seizure nor an accompanying search of the\n6               HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\narrestee would be unlawful. See Hill v. California, 401\nU. S. 797, 802–805 (1971). The limit is that “the mistakes\nmust be those of reasonable men.” Brinegar, supra, at\n176.\n  But reasonable men make mistakes of law, too, and such\nmistakes are no less compatible with the concept of rea-\nsonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion arises from the\ncombination of an officer’s understanding of the facts and\nhis understanding of the relevant law. The officer may be\nreasonably mistaken on either ground. Whether the facts\nturn out to be not what was thought, or the law turns out\nto be not what was thought, the result is the same: the\nfacts are outside the scope of the law. There is no reason,\nunder the text of the Fourth Amendment or our prece-\ndents, why this same result should be acceptable when\nreached by way of a reasonable mistake of fact, but not\nwhen reached by way of a similarly reasonable mistake of\nlaw.\n  The dissent counters that our cases discussing probable\ncause and reasonable suspicion, most notably Ornelas v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 690, 696–697 (1996), have con-\ntained “scarcely a peep” about mistakes of law. Post, at 2–3\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). It would have been surpris-\ning, of course, if they had, since none of those cases in-\nvolved a mistake of law.\n  Although such recent cases did not address mistakes of\nlaw, older precedents did. In fact, cases dating back two\ncenturies support treating legal and factual errors alike in\nthis context. Customs statutes enacted by Congress not\nlong after the founding authorized courts to issue certifi-\ncates indemnifying customs officers against damages suits\npremised on unlawful seizures. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 2,\n1799, ch. 22, §89, 1 Stat. 695–696. Courts were to issue\nsuch certificates on a showing that the officer had “rea-\nsonable cause”—a synonym for “probable cause”—for the\nchallenged seizure. Ibid.; see Stacey v. Emery, 97 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n642, 646 (1878); United States v. Riddle, 5 Cranch 311\n(1809). In United States v. Riddle, a customs officer seized\ngoods on the ground that the English shipper had violated\nthe customs laws by preparing an invoice that underval-\nued the merchandise, even though the American consignee\ndeclared the true value to the customs collector. Chief\nJustice Marshall held that there had been no violation of\nthe customs law because, whatever the shipper’s inten-\ntion, the consignee had not actually attempted to defraud\nthe Government. Nevertheless, because “the construction\nof the law was liable to some question,” he affirmed the\nissuance of a certificate of probable cause: “A doubt as to\nthe true construction of the law is as reasonable a cause\nfor seizure as a doubt respecting the fact.” Id., at 313.\n   This holding—that reasonable mistakes of law, like\nthose of fact, would justify certificates of probable cause—\nwas reiterated in a number of 19th-century decisions. See,\ne.g., The Friendship, 9 F. Cas. 825, 826 (No. 5,125) (CC\nMass. 1812) (Story, J.); United States v. The Reindeer, 27\nF. Cas. 758, 768 (No. 16,145) (CC RI 1848); United States\nv. The Recorder, 27 F. Cas. 723 (No. 16,130) (CC SDNY\n1849). By the Civil War, there had been “numerous cases\nin which [a] captured vessel was in no fault, and had not,\nunder a true construction of the law, presented even\nground of suspicion, and yet the captor was exonerated\nbecause he acted under an honest mistake of the law.”\nThe La Manche, 14 F. Cas. 965, 972 (No. 8,004) (D Mass.\n1863).\n   Riddle and its progeny are not directly on point. Chief\nJustice Marshall was not construing the Fourth Amend-\nment, and a certificate of probable cause functioned much\nlike a modern-day finding of qualified immunity, which\ndepends on an inquiry distinct from whether an officer has\ncommitted a constitutional violation. See, e.g., Carroll v.\nCarman, ante, at 7 (per curiam). But Chief Justice Mar-\nshall was nevertheless explaining the concept of probable\n8                    HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncause, which, he noted elsewhere, “in all cases of seizure,\nhas a fixed and well known meaning. It imports a seizure\nmade under circumstances which warrant suspicion.”\nLocke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339, 348 (1813). We have\nsaid the phrase “probable cause” bore this “fixed and well\nknown meaning” in the Fourth Amendment, see Brinegar,\nsupra, at 175, and n. 14, and Riddle illustrates that it\nencompassed suspicion based on reasonable mistakes of\nboth fact and law. No decision of this Court in the two\ncenturies since has undermined that understanding.*\n   The contrary conclusion would be hard to reconcile with\na much more recent precedent. In Michigan v. DeFillippo,\n443 U. S. 31 (1979), we addressed the validity of an arrest\nmade under a criminal law later declared unconstitu-\ntional. A Detroit ordinance that authorized police officers\nto stop and question individuals suspected of criminal activ-\nity also made it an offense for such an individual “to refuse\nto identify himself and produce evidence of his identity.”\nId., at 33. Detroit police officers sent to investigate a\nreport of public intoxication arrested Gary DeFillippo after\nhe failed to identify himself. A search incident to arrest\nuncovered drugs, and DeFillippo was charged with posses-\nsion of a controlled substance. The Michigan Court of\nAppeals ordered the suppression of the drugs, concluding\nthat the identification ordinance was unconstitutionally\nvague and that DeFillippo’s arrest was therefore invalid.\nId., at 34–35.\n——————\n   * The dissent contends that “the tolerance of mistakes of law in cases\nlike Riddle was a result of the specific customs statute that Congress\nhad enacted.” Post, at 8, n. 3 (citing The Apollon, 9 Wheat. 362, 373\n(1824) (Story, J.)). The relevant portion of The Apollon, however,\naddressed “the effect of probable cause,” not what gave rise to it. Id., at\n372 (emphasis added); see id., at 376 (finding it “unnecessary” to decide\nwhether probable cause existed because it “would not, under the\ncircumstances of this case, constitute a valid defence”). Justice Story\nunderstandably did not cite Riddle or discuss its tolerance of mistakes\nof law anywhere in The Apollon.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Accepting the unconstitutionality of the ordinance as a\ngiven, we nonetheless reversed. At the time the officers\narrested DeFillippo, we explained, “there was no control-\nling precedent that this ordinance was or was not consti-\ntutional, and hence the conduct observed violated a pre-\nsumptively valid ordinance.” Id., at 37. Acknowledging\nthat the outcome might have been different had the ordi-\nnance been “grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional,” we\nconcluded that under the circumstances “there was abun-\ndant probable cause to satisfy the constitutional prerequi-\nsite for an arrest.” Id., at 37–38.\n   The officers were wrong in concluding that DeFillippo\nwas guilty of a criminal offense when he declined to iden-\ntify himself. That a court only later declared the ordinance\nunconstitutional does not change the fact that DeFillippo’s\nconduct was lawful when the officers observed it. See\nDanforth v. Minnesota, 552 U. S. 264, 271 (2008). But the\nofficers’ assumption that the law was valid was reason-\nable, and their observations gave them “abundant probable\ncause” to arrest DeFillippo. 443 U. S., at 37. Although\nDeFillippo could not be prosecuted under the identifica-\ntion ordinance, the search that turned up the drugs was\nconstitutional.\n   Heien struggles to recast DeFillippo as a case solely\nabout the exclusionary rule, not the Fourth Amendment\nitself. In his view, the officers’ mistake of law resulted in\na violation the Fourth Amendment, but suppression of the\ndrugs was not the proper remedy. We did say in a footnote\nthat suppression of the evidence found on DeFillippo\nwould serve none of the purposes of the exclusionary rule.\nSee id., at 38, n. 3. But that literally marginal discussion\ndoes not displace our express holding that the arrest was\nconstitutionally valid because the officers had probable\ncause. See id., at 40. Nor, contrary to Heien’s suggestion,\ndid either United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984), or\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213 (1983), somehow erase that\n10               HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nholding and transform DeFillippo into an exclusionary\nrule decision. See Brief for Petitioner 28–29. In Leon, we\nsaid DeFillippo paid “attention to the purposes underlying\nthe exclusionary rule,” but we also clarified that it did “not\ninvolv[e] the scope of the rule itself.” 468 U. S., at 911–\n912. As for Gates, only Justice White’s separate opinion\n(joined by no other Justice) discussed DeFillippo, and it\nacknowledged that “DeFillippo did not modify the exclu-\nsionary rule itself ” but instead “upheld the validity of an\narrest.” 462 U. S., at 256, n. 12 (opinion concurring in\njudgment).\n   Heien is correct that in a number of decisions we have\nlooked to the reasonableness of an officer’s legal error in\nthe course of considering the appropriate remedy for a\nconstitutional violation, instead of whether there was a\nviolation at all. See, e.g., Davis v. United States, 564 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11) (exclusionary rule); Illinois\nv. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 359–360 (1987) (exclusionary rule);\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 615 (1999) (qualified im-\nmunity); Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 641 (1987)\n(qualified immunity). In those cases, however, we had\nalready found or assumed a Fourth Amendment violation.\nAn officer’s mistaken view that the conduct at issue did\nnot give rise to such a violation—no matter how reason-\nable—could not change that ultimate conclusion. See Brief\nfor Respondent 29–31; Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 30, n. 3. Any consideration of the reasonableness\nof an officer’s mistake was therefore limited to the sepa-\nrate matter of remedy.\n   Here, by contrast, the mistake of law relates to the\nantecedent question of whether it was reasonable for an\nofficer to suspect that the defendant’s conduct was illegal.\nIf so, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment in\nthe first place. None of the cases Heien or the dissent\ncites precludes a court from considering a reasonable\nmistake of law in addressing that question. Cf. Herring v.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States, 555 U. S. 135, 139 (2009) (assuming a\nFourth Amendment violation while rejecting application of\nthe exclusionary rule, but noting that “[w]hen a probable-\ncause determination was based on reasonable but mis-\ntaken assumptions, the person subjected to a search or\nseizure has not necessarily been the victim of a constitu-\ntional violation”).\n   Heien also contends that the reasons the Fourth\nAmendment allows some errors of fact do not extend to\nerrors of law. Officers in the field must make factual\nassessments on the fly, Heien notes, and so deserve a\nmargin of error. In Heien’s view, no such margin is ap-\npropriate for questions of law: The statute here either\nrequires one working brake light or two, and the answer\ndoes not turn on anything “an officer might suddenly\nconfront in the field.” Brief for Petitioner 21. But Heien’s\npoint does not consider the reality that an officer may\n“suddenly confront” a situation in the field as to which the\napplication of a statute is unclear—however clear it may\nlater become. A law prohibiting “vehicles” in the park\neither covers Segways or not, see A. Scalia & B. Garner,\nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 36–38\n(2012), but an officer will nevertheless have to make a\nquick decision on the law the first time one whizzes by.\n   Contrary to the suggestion of Heien and amici, our\ndecision does not discourage officers from learning the\nlaw. The Fourth Amendment tolerates only reasonable\nmistakes, and those mistakes—whether of fact or of law—\nmust be objectively reasonable. We do not examine the\nsubjective understanding of the particular officer involved.\nCf. Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 813 (1996). And\nthe inquiry is not as forgiving as the one employed in the\ndistinct context of deciding whether an officer is entitled to\nqualified immunity for a constitutional or statutory viola-\ntion. Thus, an officer can gain no Fourth Amendment\nadvantage through a sloppy study of the laws he is duty-\n12              HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbound to enforce.\n   Finally, Heien and amici point to the well-known maxim,\n“Ignorance of the law is no excuse,” and contend that it\nis fundamentally unfair to let police officers get away with\nmistakes of law when the citizenry is accorded no such\nleeway. Though this argument has a certain rhetorical\nappeal, it misconceives the implication of the maxim. The\ntrue symmetry is this: Just as an individual generally\ncannot escape criminal liability based on a mistaken\nunderstanding of the law, so too the government cannot\nimpose criminal liability based on a mistaken understand-\ning of the law. If the law required two working brake\nlights, Heien could not escape a ticket by claiming he\nreasonably thought he needed only one; if the law required\nonly one, Sergeant Darisse could not issue a valid ticket by\nclaiming he reasonably thought drivers needed two. But\njust because mistakes of law cannot justify either the\nimposition or the avoidance of criminal liability, it does\nnot follow that they cannot justify an investigatory stop.\nAnd Heien is not appealing a brake-light ticket; he is\nappealing a cocaine-trafficking conviction as to which\nthere is no asserted mistake of fact or law.\n                            III\n   Here we have little difficulty concluding that the of-\nficer’s error of law was reasonable. Although the North\nCarolina statute at issue refers to “a stop lamp,” suggest-\ning the need for only a single working brake light, it also\nprovides that “[t]he stop lamp may be incorporated into a\nunit with one or more other rear lamps.” N. C. Gen. Stat.\nAnn. §20–129(g) (emphasis added). The use of “other”\nsuggests to the everyday reader of English that a “stop\nlamp” is a type of “rear lamp.” And another subsection of\nthe same provision requires that vehicles “have all origi-\nnally equipped rear lamps or the equivalent in good work-\ning order,” §20–129(d), arguably indicating that if a vehi-\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncle has multiple “stop lamp[s],” all must be functional.\n   The North Carolina Court of Appeals concluded that the\n“rear lamps” discussed in subsection (d) do not include\nbrake lights, but, given the “other,” it would at least have\nbeen reasonable to think they did. Both the majority and\nthe dissent in the North Carolina Supreme Court so con-\ncluded, and we agree. See 366 N. C., at 282–283, 737 S. E.\n2d, at 358–359; id., at 283, 737 S. E. 2d, at 359 (Hudson,\nJ., dissenting) (calling the Court of Appeals’ decision\n“surprising”). This “stop lamp” provision, moreover, had\nnever been previously construed by North Carolina’s\nappellate courts. See id., at 283, 737 S. E. 2d, at 359\n(majority opinion). It was thus objectively reasonable for\nan officer in Sergeant Darisse’s position to think that\nHeien’s faulty right brake light was a violation of North\nCarolina law. And because the mistake of law was rea-\nsonable, there was reasonable suspicion justifying the\nstop.\n   The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina is\n                                                   Affirmed.\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

I write separately to elaborate briefly on those\nimportant limitations.1\n   First, an officer’s “subjective understanding” is irrele-\nvant: As the Court notes, “[w]e do not examine” it at all.\n——————\n   1 I note in addition, as does the Court, that one kind of mistaken legal\n\njudgment—an error about the contours of the Fourth Amendment\nitself—can never support a search or seizure. See ante, at 10 (“An\nofficer’s mistaken view that” conduct does “not give rise to” a Fourth\nAmendment violation, “no matter how reasonable,” cannot change a\ncourt’s “ultimate conclusion” that such a violation has occurred). As the\nSolicitor General has explained, mistakes about the requirements of\nthe Fourth Amendment “violate the Fourth Amendment even when\nthey are reasonable.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 30, n. 3;\nsee Brief for Respondent 29 (stating the same view).\n2               HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                    KAGAN, J., concurring\n\nIbid. That means the government cannot defend an of-\nficer’s mistaken legal interpretation on the ground that\nthe officer was unaware of or untrained in the law. And it\nmeans that, contrary to the dissenting opinion in the court\nbelow, an officer’s reliance on “an incorrect memo or train-\ning program from the police department” makes no differ-\nence to the analysis. 366 N. C. 271, 284, 737 S. E. 2d 351,\n360 (2012) (Hudson, J., dissenting). Those considerations\npertain to the officer’s subjective understanding of the law\nand thus cannot help to justify a seizure.\n   Second, the inquiry the Court permits today is more\ndemanding than the one courts undertake before awarding\nqualified immunity. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 51 (Solicitor\nGeneral stating that the two tests “require essentially the\nopposite” showings); Brief for Respondent 31–32 (making\na similar point). Our modern qualified immunity doctrine\nprotects “all but the plainly incompetent or those who\nknowingly violate the law.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting Malley v. Briggs,\n475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986)). By contrast, Justice Story’s\nopinion in The Friendship, 9 F. Cas. 825, 826 (No. 5,125)\n(CC Mass. 1812) (cited ante, at 7), suggests the appropri-\nate standard for deciding when a legal error can support a\nseizure: when an officer takes a reasonable view of a “vex-\nata questio” on which different judges “h[o]ld opposite\nopinions.” See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n26 (invoking that language). Or to make the same point\nwithout the Latin, the test is satisfied when the law at\nissue is “so doubtful in construction” that a reasonable\njudge could agree with the officer’s view. The Friendship,\n9 F. Cas., at 826.\n   A court tasked with deciding whether an officer’s mis-\ntake of law can support a seizure thus faces a straightfor-\nward question of statutory construction. If the statute is\ngenuinely ambiguous, such that overturning the officer’s\njudgment requires hard interpretive work, then the officer\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

As the\nSolicitor General made the point at oral argument, the\nstatute must pose a “really difficult” or “very hard ques-\ntion of statutory interpretation.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 50. And\nindeed, both North Carolina and the Solicitor General\nagreed that such cases will be “exceedingly rare.” Brief for\nRespondent 17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 48.\n   The Court’s analysis of Sergeant Darisse’s interpreta-\ntion of the North Carolina law at issue here appropriately\nreflects these principles. As the Court explains, see ante,\nat 12–13, the statute requires every car on the highway to\nhave “a stop lamp,” in the singular. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n§20–129(g) (2007). But the statute goes on to state that a\nstop lamp (or, in more modern terminology, brake light)\n“may be incorporated into a unit with one or more other\nrear lamps,” suggesting that a stop lamp itself qualifies as\na rear lamp. Ibid. (emphasis added). And the statute\nfurther mandates that every car have “all originally\nequipped rear lamps . . . in good working order.” §20–\n129(d) (emphasis added). The North Carolina Court of\nAppeals dealt with the statute’s conflicting signals in one\nway (deciding that a brake light is not a rear lamp, and so\nonly one needs to work); but a court could easily take the\nofficer’s view (deciding that a brake light is a rear lamp,\nand if a car comes equipped with more than one, as mod-\nern cars do, all must be in working order). The critical\npoint is that the statute poses a quite difficult question of\ninterpretation, and Sergeant Darisse’s judgment, although\noverturned, had much to recommend it. I therefore agree\nwith the Court that the traffic stop he conducted did not\nviolate the Fourth Amendment.\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

California, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 5). But this broad statement simply sets the stand-\nard a court is to apply when it conducts its inquiry into\nwhether the Fourth Amendment has been violated. It\ndoes not define the categories of inputs that courts are to\nconsider when assessing the reasonableness of a search or\nseizure, each of which must be independently justified.\nWhat this case requires us to decide is whether a police\nofficer’s understanding of the law is an input into the\nreasonableness inquiry, or whether this inquiry instead\ntakes the law as a given and assesses an officer’s under-\nstanding of the facts against a fixed legal yardstick.\n  I would hold that determining whether a search or\nseizure is reasonable requires evaluating an officer’s un-\nderstanding of the facts against the actual state of the law.\nI would accordingly reverse the judgment of the North\nCarolina Supreme Court, and I respectfully dissent from\nthe Court’s contrary holding.\n                         I\n It is common ground that Heien was seized within the\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment.

NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nports with the Constitution only if the officers had articu-\nlable and reasonable suspicion that Heien was breaking\nthe law. In Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696\n(1996), we explained that the “principal components” of\nthat determination “will be the events which occurred\nleading up to the stop or search, and then the decision\nwhether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint\nof an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to rea-\nsonable suspicion or to probable cause.” We described this\nkind of determination as “a mixed question of law and\nfact”: “ ‘[T]he issue is whether the facts satisfy the [rele-\nvant] statutory [or constitutional] standard, or to put it\nanother way, whether the rule of law as applied to the\nestablished facts is or is not violated.’ ” Id., at 696–697\n(quoting Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S 273, 289,\nn. 19 (1982)). What matters, we said, are the facts as\nviewed by an objectively reasonable officer, and the rule of\nlaw—not an officer’s conception of the rule of law, and not\neven an officer’s reasonable misunderstanding about the\nlaw, but the law.\n   As a result, when we have talked about the leeway that\nofficers have in making probable-cause determinations, we\nhave focused on their assessments of facts. See, e.g., Terry\nv. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–22 (1968) (framing the question as\nwhether the “facts” give rise to reasonable suspicion). We\nhave conceded that an arresting officer’s state of mind\ndoes not factor into the probable-cause inquiry, “except for\nthe facts that he knows.” Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U. S.\n146, 153 (2004) (emphasis added). And we have said that,\nto satisfy the reasonableness requirement, “what is gener-\nally demanded of the many factual determinations that\nmust regularly be made by agents of the government . . . is\nnot that they always be correct, but that they always be\nreasonable.” Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177, 185\n(1990) (emphasis added). There is scarcely a peep in these\ncases to suggest that an officer’s understanding or concep-\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntion of anything other than the facts is relevant.\n   This framing of the reasonableness inquiry has not only\nbeen focused on officers’ understanding of the facts, it has\nbeen justified in large part based on the recognition that\nofficers are generally in a superior position, relative to\ncourts, to evaluate those facts and their significance as\nthey unfold. In other words, the leeway we afford officers’\nfactual assessments is rooted not only in our recognition\nthat police officers operating in the field have to make\nquick decisions, see id., at 186, but also in our understand-\ning that police officers have the expertise to “dra[w] infer-\nences and mak[e] deductions . . . that might well elude an\nuntrained person.” United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411,\n418 (1981). When officers evaluate unfolding circum-\nstances, they deploy that expertise to draw “conclusions\nabout human behavior” much in the way that “jurors [do]\nas factfinders.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   The same cannot be said about legal exegesis. After all,\nthe meaning of the law is not probabilistic in the same\nway that factual determinations are. Rather, “the notion\nthat the law is definite and knowable” sits at the founda-\ntion of our legal system. Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S.\n192, 199 (1991). And it is courts, not officers, that are in\nthe best position to interpret the laws.\n   Both our enunciation of the reasonableness inquiry and\nour justification for it thus have always turned on an\nofficer’s factual conclusions and an officer’s expertise with\nrespect to those factual conclusions. Neither has hinted at\ntaking into account an officer’s understanding of the law,\nreasonable or otherwise.\n                             II\n  Departing from this tradition means further eroding the\nFourth Amendment’s protection of civil liberties in a\ncontext where that protection has already been worn\ndown. Traffic stops like those at issue here can be “annoy-\n4                HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ning, frightening, and perhaps humiliating.” Terry, 392\nU. S., at 25; see Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 657\n(1979). We have nevertheless held that an officer’s subjec-\ntive motivations do not render a traffic stop unlawful.\nWhren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806 (1996). But we\nassumed in Whren that when an officer acts on pretext, at\nleast that pretext would be the violation of an actual law.\nSee id., at 810 (discussing the three provisions of the\nDistrict of Columbia traffic code that the parties accepted\nthe officer had probable cause to believe had been vio-\nlated). Giving officers license to effect seizures so long as\nthey can attach to their reasonable view of the facts some\nreasonable legal interpretation (or misinterpretation) that\nsuggests a law has been violated significantly expands this\nauthority. Cf. Barlow v. United States, 7 Pet. 404, 411\n(1833) (Story, J.) (“There is scarcely any law which does\nnot admit of some ingenious doubt”). One wonders how a\ncitizen seeking to be law-abiding and to structure his or\nher behavior to avoid these invasive, frightening, and\nhumiliating encounters could do so.\n   In addition to these human consequences—including\nthose for communities and for their relationships with the\npolice—permitting mistakes of law to justify seizures has\nthe perverse effect of preventing or delaying the clarifica-\ntion of the law. Under such an approach, courts need not\ninterpret statutory language but can instead simply decide\nwhether an officer’s interpretation was reasonable. In-\ndeed, had this very case arisen after the North Carolina\nSupreme Court announced its rule, the North Carolina\nCourt of Appeals would not have had the occasion to in-\nterpret the statute at issue. Similarly, courts in the\nEighth Circuit, which has been the only Circuit to include\npolice mistakes of law in the reasonableness inquiry, have\nobserved that they need not decide interpretive questions\nunder their approach. See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez-\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

Cf. Camreta v. Greene, 563\nU. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 10–11) (recognizing\nthe importance of clarifying the law).\n   Of course, if the law enforcement system could not\nfunction without permitting mistakes of law to justify\nseizures, one could at least argue that permitting as much\nis a necessary evil. But I have not seen any persuasive\nargument that law enforcement will be unduly hampered\nby a rule that precludes consideration of mistakes of law\nin the reasonableness inquiry. After all, there is no indi-\ncation that excluding an officer’s mistake of law from the\nreasonableness inquiry has created a problem for law\nenforcement in the overwhelming number of Circuits\nwhich have adopted that approach. If an officer makes a\nstop in good faith but it turns out that, as in this case, the\nofficer was wrong about what the law proscribed or re-\nquired, I know of no penalty that the officer would suffer.\nSee 366 N. C. 271, 286–288, 737 S. E. 2d 351, 361–362\n(2012) (Hudson, J., dissenting) (observing that “officers\n(rightfully) face no punishment for a stop based on a mis-\ntake of law”).

See, e.g., Davis v. United States, 564 U. S. ___,\n___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 8–9). It is true that, unlike\nmost States, North Carolina does not provide a good-faith\nexception as a matter of state law, see State v. Carter, 322\nN. C. 709, 721–724, 370 S.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n  In short, there is nothing in our case law requiring us to\nhold that a reasonable mistake of law can justify a seizure\nunder the Fourth Amendment, and quite a bit suggesting\njust the opposite. I also see nothing to be gained from\nsuch a holding, and much to be lost.\n                             III\n  In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court makes\nboth serious legal and practical errors. On the legal side,\nthe Court barely addresses Ornelas and the other cases\nthat frame the reasonableness inquiry around factual\ndeterminations. Instead, in support of its conclusion that\nreasonable suspicion “arises from the combination of an\nofficer’s understanding of the facts and his understanding\nof the relevant law,” ante, at 6 (emphasis added), the\nCourt first reaches to founding-era customs statutes and\ncases applying those statutes. It concedes, however, that\nthese cases are “not directly on point” because they say\nnothing about the scope of the Fourth Amendment and are\ninstead equivalents of our modern-day qualified immunity\njurisprudence for civil damages. Ante, at 7.\n   The only link in the tenuous chain the Court constructs\nbetween those cases and this one that has anything to say\nabout the Fourth Amendment is Brinegar v. United States,\n338 U. S. 160 (1949). See ante, at 8. But all that our\nopinion in Brinegar actually says is that probable cause\nexists where “ ‘the facts and circumstances within [the\nofficers’] knowledge and of which they had reasonably\ntrustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to\nwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that’ an\noffense has been or is being committed.” 338 U. S., at\n175–176 (quoting Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132,\n162 (1925)). It thus states the uncontroversial proposition\nthat the probable-cause inquiry looks to the reasonable-\n8                   HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nness of an officer’s understanding of the facts. Indeed,\nBrinegar is an odd case for the Court to rely on given that,\nlike the cases I discussed above, it subsequently empha-\nsizes that “the mistakes must be those of reasonable men,\nacting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of\nprobability.” 338 U. S., at 176 (emphasis added). Again,\nreasonable understandings of the facts, not reasonable\nunderstandings of what the law says.3\n    Further, the Court looks to our decision in Michigan v.\nDeFillippo, 443 U. S. 31 (1979). This is a Fourth Amend-\nment case, but the Court’s reading of it imagines a holding\nthat is not rooted in the logic of the opinion. We held in\nDeFillippo that an officer had probable cause to support\nan arrest even though the ordinance that had allegedly\nbeen violated was later held by the Michigan Court of\nAppeals to be unconstitutional. This was so, we explained,\nbecause the officer conducted an arrest after having ob-\nserved conduct that was criminalized by a presumptively\nvalid law at the time of that conduct. See id., at 37 (“At\nth[e] time [of the arrest], of course, there was no control-\nling precedent that this ordinance was or was not consti-\ntutional, and hence the conduct observed violated a pre-\nsumptively valid ordinance”). We noted that it would have\nbeen wrong for that officer not to enforce the law in that sit-\nuation. See id., at 38 (“Police are charged to enforce laws\nuntil and unless they are declared unconstitutional.\n . . . Society would be ill-served if its police officers took\n\n——————\n  3 The Court in fact errs even earlier in the chain when it represents\n\nUnited States v. Riddle, 5 Cranch 311 (1809), as containing some broad\nproposition. Ante, at 6–7. As Justice Story explained in a later case,\nthe tolerance of mistakes of law in cases like Riddle was a result of the\nspecific customs statute that Congress had enacted. The Apollon, 9\nWheat. 362, 373 (1824) (explaining that findings of probable cause\n“ha[d] never been supposed to excuse any seizure, except where some\nstatute creates and defines the exemption from damages” (emphasis\nadded)).\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nit upon themselves to determine which laws are and which\nare not constitutionally entitled to enforcement”).\n   DeFillippo thus did not involve any police “mistake” at\nall. Rather, DeFillippo involved a police officer correctly\napplying the law that was then in existence and that\ncarried with it a presumption of validity. Here, by con-\ntrast, police stopped Heien on suspicion of committing an\noffense that never actually existed. Given that our hold-\ning in DeFillippo relied so squarely on the existence of a\nlaw criminalizing the defendant’s conduct, and on the\npresumption of validity that attends actual laws, it can\nhardly be said to control where, as here, no law ever actu-\nally criminalized Heien’s conduct.\n   On the practical side, the Court primarily contends that\nan officer may confront “a situation in the field as to which\nthe application of a statute is unclear.” Ante, at 11. One\nis left to wonder, however, why an innocent citizen should\nbe made to shoulder the burden of being seized whenever\nthe law may be susceptible to an interpretive question.\nMoreover, the Court fails to reconcile its belief that the\nFourth Amendment gives officers leeway to address situa-\ntions where the application of a criminal statute may be\nunclear with our prior assumption that the Fourth\nAmendment does not give officers such leeway where they\nrely on a statute that authorizes police conduct that may\nviolate the Fourth Amendment. See Illinois v. Krull, 480\nU. S. 340, 355, n. 12, 359 (1987). Nor does it engage with\nthe analytic consequences of North Carolina’s similar\nconcession that it does not mean to claim “that an officer’s\nmistaken understanding of the Fourth Amendment itself\ncan support a seizure if that understanding was reason-\nable.” Brief for Respondent 29. It is not clear why an\nofficer’s mistaken understanding of other laws should be\nviewed differently.\n   While I appreciate that the Court has endeavored to set\nsome bounds on the types of mistakes of law that it thinks\n10               HEIEN v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwill qualify as reasonable, and while I think that the set of\nreasonable mistakes of law ought to be narrowly circum-\nscribed if they are to be countenanced at all, I am not at\nall convinced that the Court has done so in a clear way. It\nseems to me that the difference between qualified immun-\nity’s reasonableness standard—which the Court insists\nwithout elaboration does not apply here—and the Court’s\nconception of reasonableness in this context—which re-\nmains undefined—will prove murky in application. See\nante, at 11. I fear the Court’s unwillingness to sketch a\nfuller view of what makes a mistake of law reasonable\nonly presages the likely difficulty that courts will have\napplying the Court’s decision in this case.\n                       *      *     *\n  To my mind, the more administrable approach—and the\none more consistent with our precedents and principles—\nwould be to hold that an officer’s mistake of law, no matter\nhow reasonable, cannot support the individualized suspi-\ncion necessary to justify a seizure under the Fourth\nAmendment.
