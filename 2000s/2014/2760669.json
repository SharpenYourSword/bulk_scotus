OWENS \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 13–719.      Argued October 7, 2014—Decided December 15, 2014\nA defendant seeking to remove a case from state to federal court must\n  file in the federal forum a notice of removal “containing a short and\n  plain statement of the grounds for removal.” 28 U. S. C. §1446(a).\n     Respondent Owens filed a putative class action in Kansas state\n  court, seeking compensation for damages class members allegedly\n  sustained when petitioners (collectively, Dart) underpaid royalties\n  due under certain oil and gas leases. Dart removed the case to the\n  Federal District Court, invoking the Class Action Fairness Act of\n  2005 (CAFA), which gives federal courts jurisdiction over class ac-\n  tions if the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, 28 U. S. C.\n  §1332(d)(2). Dart’s notice of removal alleged that the purported un-\n  derpayments totaled over $8.2 million. Owens moved to remand the\n  case to state court, asserting that the removal notice was “deficient\n  as a matter of law” because it included “no evidence” proving that the\n  amount in controversy exceeded $5 million. In response, Dart sub-\n  mitted an executive’s detailed declaration supporting an amount in\n  controversy in excess of $11 million. The District Court granted Ow-\n  ens’ remand motion, reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof\n  of the amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself. Dart pe-\n  titioned the Tenth Circuit for permission to appeal, see §1453(c)(1),\n  but that court denied review and rehearing en banc.\nHeld:\n    1. As specified in §1446(a), a defendant’s notice of removal need in-\n clude only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy ex-\n ceeds the jurisdictional threshold; the notice need not contain eviden-\n tiary submissions.\n    Section 1446(a) tracks the general pleading requirement stated in\n2        DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. By borrowing Rule\n    8(a)’s “short and plain statement” standard, corroborative history in-\n    dicates, Congress intended to clarify that courts should “apply the\n    same liberal rules [to removal allegations as] to other matters of\n    pleading.” H. R. Rep. No. 100–889, p. 71. The amount-in-controversy\n    allegation of a plaintiff invoking federal-court jurisdiction is accepted\n    if made in good faith. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,\n    429 U. S. 274, 276. Similarly, the amount-in-controversy allegation\n    of a defendant seeking federal-court adjudication should be accepted\n    when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court. In the\n    event that the plaintiff does contest the defendant’s allegations, both\n    sides submit proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the\n    evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been\n    satisfied, see §1446(c)(2)(B).\n       In remanding the case to state court, the District Court relied, in\n    part, on a purported “presumption” against removal, but no antire-\n    moval presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, a statute Congress\n    enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal\n    court. See Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S. ___, ___.\n    Pp. 4–7.\n       2. The District Court erred in remanding this case for want of an\n    evidentiary submission in the notice of removal, and the Tenth Cir-\n    cuit abused its discretion in denying review of that decision. Pp. 7–\n    14.\n          (a) This Court concludes that no jurisdictional barrier impedes\n    settlement of the question presented: whether evidence supporting\n    the amount in controversy must be included in a notice of removal.\n    The case was “in” the Tenth Circuit because of Dart’s application for\n    leave to appeal, and the Court has jurisdiction to review what the\n    Court of Appeals did with that application. See 28 U. S. C. §1254;\n    Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 248. Pp. 7–8.\n          (b) While appellate review of a remand order is discretionary, ex-\n    ercise of that discretion is not rudderless, see Highmark Inc. v. All-\n    care Health Management System, Inc., 572 U. S. ___, ___, and a court\n    “would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an er-\n    roneous view of the law,” Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n    384, 405. The Tenth Circuit had previously stated considerations\n    bearing on the intelligent exercise of discretion under §1453(c)(1).\n    One of those considerations is particularly relevant here: a court of\n    appeals should inquire whether, if a district court’s remand order\n    remains undisturbed, the case will “leave the ambit of the federal\n    courts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the defendant]\n    to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [under CAFA] . . . to have a\n    federal tribunal adjudicate the merits.” BP America, Inc. v. Oklaho-\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ma ex rel. Edmondson, 613 F. 3d 1029, 1035. Thus the Tenth Cir-\n  cuit’s own guide weighed heavily in favor of accepting Dart’s appeal.\n  In practical effect, the Court of Appeals’ denial of review established\n  the law—the requirement of proof of the amount in controversy in the\n  removal notice—not simply for this case, but for future CAFA remov-\n  als sought by defendants in the Tenth Circuit, leaving those defend-\n  ants with no realistic opportunity to resist making the evidentiary\n  submission.\n     The District Court, driven by its conscientious endeavor to follow\n  Circuit precedent, erred in ruling that Dart’s amount-in-controversy\n  allegation failed for want of proof. It was an abuse of discretion for\n  the Tenth Circuit to deny Dart’s request for review, for that disposi-\n  tion fastened on district courts within the Circuit an erroneous view\n  of the law. Contrary to the law the District Court derived from Tenth\n  Circuit precedent, a removal notice need only plausibly allege, not de-\n  tail proof of, the amount in controversy.Pp. 8–14.\nVacated and remanded.\n\n   GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

OWENS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [December 15, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  To remove a case from a state court to a federal court, a\ndefendant must file in the federal forum a notice of re-\nmoval “containing a short and plain statement of the\ngrounds for removal.” 28 U. S. C. §1446(a). When re-\nmoval is based on diversity of citizenship, an amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement must be met. Ordinarily, “the\nmatter in controversy [must] excee[d] the sum or value of\n$75,000.” §1332(a). In class actions for which the re-\nquirement of diversity of citizenship is relaxed, §1332(d)\n(2)(A)–(C), “the matter in controversy [must] excee[d]\nthe sum or value of $5,000,000,” §1332(d)(2). If the\nplaintiff ’s complaint, filed in state court, demands mon-\netary relief of a stated sum, that sum, if asserted in\ngood faith, is “deemed to be the amount in controversy.”\n§1446(c)(2). When the plaintiff ’s complaint does not state\nthe amount in controversy, the defendant’s notice of re-\nmoval may do so. §1446(c)(2)(A).\n  To assert the amount in controversy adequately in the\nremoval notice, does it suffice to allege the requisite\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\namount plausibly, or must the defendant incorporate into\nthe notice of removal evidence supporting the allegation?\nThat is the single question argued here and below by the\nparties and the issue on which we granted review. The\nanswer, we hold, is supplied by the removal statute itself.\nA statement “short and plain” need not contain eviden-\ntiary submissions.\n                              I\n   Brandon W. Owens, plaintiff below and respondent\nhere, filed a putative class action in Kansas state court\nalleging that defendants Dart Cherokee Basin Operating\nCompany, LLC, and Cherokee Basin Pipeline, LLC (collec-\ntively, Dart), underpaid royalties owed to putative class\nmembers under certain oil and gas leases. The complaint\nsought “a fair and reasonable amount” to compensate\nputative class members for “damages” they sustained due\nto the alleged underpayments. App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a,\n35a.\n   Invoking federal jurisdiction under the Class Action\nFairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), Dart removed the case to the\nU. S. District Court for the District of Kansas. CAFA\ngives federal courts jurisdiction over certain class actions,\ndefined in §1332(d)(1), if the class has more than 100\nmembers, the parties are minimally diverse, and the\namount in controversy exceeds $5 million. §1332(d)(2),\n(5)(B); see Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3). Dart’s notice of removal\nalleged that all three requirements were satisfied. With\nrespect to the amount in controversy, Dart stated that the\npurported underpayments to putative class members\ntotaled more than $8.2 million.\n   Owens moved to remand the case to state court. The\nnotice of removal was “deficient as a matter of law,”\nOwens asserted, because it included “no evidence” proving\nthat the amount in controversy exceeded $5 million. App.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto Pet. for Cert. 46a, 53a. In response, Dart submitted a\ndeclaration by one of its executive officers. The declara-\ntion included a detailed damages calculation indicating\nthat the amount in controversy, sans interest, exceeded\n$11 million.     Without challenging Dart’s calculation,\nOwens urged that Dart’s amount-in-controversy submission\ncame too late. “[The] legally deficient [notice of removal],”\nOwens maintained, could not be cured by “post-removal\nevidence about the amount in controversy.” Id., at 100a.\n   Reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof of\nthe amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself,\nthe District Court granted Owens’ remand motion. Dart’s\ndeclaration, the District Court held, could not serve to\nkeep the case in federal court. The Tenth Circuit, as the\nDistrict Court read Circuit precedent, “has consistently\nheld that reference to factual allegations or evidence out-\nside of the petition and notice of removal is not permitted\nto determine the amount in controversy.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 26a, and n. 37 (citing Laughlin v. Kmart Corp.,\n50 F. 3d 871, 873 (1995); Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp.,\n251 F. 3d 1284, 1291, n. 4 (2001); Oklahoma Farm Bureau\nMut. Ins. Co. v. JSSJ Corp., 149 Fed. Appx. 775 (2005)).\n   Ordinarily, remand orders “[are] not reviewable on\nappeal or otherwise.” §1447(d). There is an exception,\nhowever, for cases invoking CAFA. §1453(c)(1). In such\ncases, “a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an\norder of a district court granting or denying a motion to\nremand.” Ibid. Citing this exception, Dart petitioned the\nTenth Circuit for permission to appeal. “Upon careful\nconsideration of the parties’ submissions, as well as the\napplicable law,” the Tenth Circuit panel, dividing two-to-\none, denied review. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a–14a.\n   An evenly divided court denied Dart’s petition for en\nbanc review. Dissenting from the denial of rehearing en\nbanc, Judge Hartz observed that the Tenth Circuit “[had]\nlet stand a district-court decision that will in effect impose\n4     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin this circuit requirements for notices of removal that are\neven more onerous than the code pleading requirements\nthat . . . federal courts abandoned long ago.” 730 F. 3d\n1234 (2013). The Tenth Circuit was duty-bound to grant\nDart’s petition for rehearing en banc, Judge Hartz urged,\nbecause the opportunity “to correct the law in our circuit”\nlikely would not arise again. Id., at 1235. Henceforth,\nJudge Hartz explained, “any diligent attorney . . . would\nsubmit to the evidentiary burden rather than take a\nchance on remand to state court.” Ibid.\n   Dart filed a petition for certiorari in this Court request-\ning resolution of the following question: “Whether a de-\nfendant seeking removal to federal court is required to\ninclude evidence supporting federal jurisdiction in the\nnotice of removal, or is alleging the required ‘short and\nplain statement of the grounds for removal’ enough?” Pet.\nfor Cert. i. Owens’ brief in opposition raised no impedi-\nment to this Court’s review. (Nor, later, did Owens’ merits\nbrief suggest any barrier to our consideration of Dart’s\npetition.) We granted certiorari to resolve a division\namong the Circuits on the question presented. 572 U. S.\n___ (2014). Compare Ellenburg v. Spartan Motors Chas-\nsis, Inc., 519 F. 3d 192, 200 (CA4 2008) (a removing party’s\nnotice of removal need not “meet a higher pleading stand-\nard than the one imposed on a plaintiff in drafting an\ninitial complaint”), and Spivey v. Vertrue, Inc., 528 F. 3d\n982, 986 (CA7 2008) (similar), with Laughlin, 50 F. 3d, at\n873 (“the requisite amount in controversy . . . must be\naffirmatively established on the face of either the petition\nor the removal notice”).\n                            II\n  As noted above, a defendant seeking to remove a case to\na federal court must file in the federal forum a notice of\nremoval “containing a short and plain statement of the\ngrounds for removal.” §1446(a). By design, §1446(a)\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntracks the general pleading requirement stated in Rule\n8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 14C C.\nWright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & J. Steinman, Federal\nPractice and Procedure §3733, pp. 639–641 (4th ed. 2009)\n(“Section 1446(a) requires only that the grounds for re-\nmoval be stated in ‘a short and plain statement’—terms\nborrowed from the pleading requirement set forth in Fed-\neral Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a).”). The legislative history\nof §1446(a) is corroborative. Congress, by borrowing the\nfamiliar “short and plain statement” standard from Rule\n8(a), intended to “simplify the ‘pleading’ requirements for\nremoval” and to clarify that courts should “apply the same\nliberal rules [to removal allegations] that are applied to\nother matters of pleading.” H. R. Rep. No. 100–889, p. 71\n(1988). See also ibid. (disapproving decisions requiring\n“detailed pleading”).\n   When a plaintiff invokes federal-court jurisdiction, the\nplaintiff ’s amount-in-controversy allegation is accepted if\nmade in good faith. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed.\nv. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 276 (1977) (“ ‘[T]he sum claimed by\nthe plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in\ngood faith.’ ”) (quoting St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v.\nRed Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283, 288 (1938); alteration in origi-\nnal). Similarly, when a defendant seeks federal-court\nadjudication, the defendant’s amount-in-controversy alle-\ngation should be accepted when not contested by the\nplaintiff or questioned by the court. Indeed, the Tenth\nCircuit, although not disturbing prior decisions demand-\ning proof together with the removal notice, recognized that\nit was anomalous to treat commencing plaintiffs and\nremoving defendants differently with regard to the\namount in controversy. See McPhail v. Deere & Co., 529\nF. 3d 947, 953 (2008) (requiring proof by defendant but not\nby plaintiff “bears no evident logical relationship either to\nthe purpose of diversity jurisdiction, or to the principle\nthat those who seek to invoke federal jurisdiction must\n6      DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nestablish its prerequisites”).\n  If the plaintiff contests the defendant’s allegation,\n§1446(c)(2)(B) instructs: “[R]emoval . . . is proper on the\nbasis of an amount in controversy asserted” by the defend-\nant “if the district court finds, by the preponderance of the\nevidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds” the\njurisdictional threshold.1 This provision, added to §1446\nas part of the Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue\nClarification Act of 2011 (JVCA), clarifies the procedure in\norder when a defendant’s assertion of the amount in con-\ntroversy is challenged. In such a case, both sides submit\nproof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement\nhas been satisfied. As the House Judiciary Committee\nReport on the JVCA observed:\n     “[D]efendants do not need to prove to a legal certainty\n     that the amount in controversy requirement has been\n     met. Rather, defendants may simply allege or assert\n     that the jurisdictional threshold has been met. Dis-\n     covery may be taken with regard to that question. In\n     case of a dispute, the district court must make find-\n     ings of jurisdictional fact to which the preponderance\n     standard applies.” H. R. Rep. No. 112–10, p. 16\n     (2011).\n\n——————\n   1 Section 1446(c)(2) applies to removals “sought on the basis of the\n\njurisdiction conferred by section 1332(a),” and §1446(c)(2)(B) provides\nthat “removal of the action is proper . . . [if] the amount in controversy\nexceeds the [in excess of $75,000] amount specified in section 1332(a)”\n(emphasis added). We assume, without deciding, a point the parties do\nnot dispute: Sections 1446(c)(2) and 1446(c)(2)(B) apply to cases re-\nmoved under §1332(d)(2), and removal is proper if the amount in\ncontroversy exceeds $5 million, the amount specified in §1332(d)(2).\nSee Frederick v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 683 F. 3d 1242, 1247\n(CA10 2012) (“[T]here is no logical reason why we should demand more\nfrom a CAFA defendant than other parties invoking federal jurisdic-\ntion.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nOf course, a dispute about a defendant’s jurisdictional\nallegations cannot arise until after the defendant files a\nnotice of removal containing those allegations. Brief for\nDart 14.\n  In remanding the case to state court, the District Court\nrelied, in part, on a purported “presumption” against\nremoval. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. See, e.g., Laughlin, 50\nF. 3d, at 873 (“[T]here is a presumption against removal\njurisdiction.”). We need not here decide whether such a\npresumption is proper in mine-run diversity cases. It\nsuffices to point out that no antiremoval presumption\nattends cases invoking CAFA, which Congress enacted to\nfacilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal\ncourt. See Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (“CAFA’s primary objective” is to “ensur[e] ‘Fed-\neral court consideration of interstate cases of national\nimportance.’ ” (quoting §2(b)(2), 119 Stat. 5)); S. Rep. No.\n109–14, p. 43 (2005) (CAFA’s “provisions should be read\nbroadly, with a strong preference that interstate class\nactions should be heard in a federal court if properly re-\nmoved by any defendant.”).\n  In sum, as specified in §1446(a), a defendant’s notice of\nremoval need include only a plausible allegation that the\namount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional thresh-\nold. Evidence establishing the amount is required by\n§1446(c)(2)(B) only when the plaintiff contests, or the\ncourt questions, the defendant’s allegation.\n                             III\n  As in Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 2–3), we granted review in this case after the Court\nof Appeals declined to hear an appeal from a remand\norder. Neither party in that case or in this one questioned\nour review authority under 28 U. S. C. §1254(1) (“Cases in\nthe courts of appeals may be reviewed . . . [b]y writ of\ncertiorari upon the petition of any party . . . before or after\n8      DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrendition of judgment.”).2 An amicus brief filed in support\nof Owens by Public Citizen, Inc., however, raised a juris-\ndictional impediment.\n  Section 1453(c)(1), Public Citizen noted, provides that “a\ncourt of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of\na district court granting or denying a motion to remand a\nclass action to the State court from which it was re-\nmoved[.]” (Emphasis added.) Because court of appeals\nreview of a remand order is discretionary, see supra, at 3,\nand the Tenth Circuit exercised its discretion to deny\nreview, Public Citizen urged, “[b]oth parties ask this Court\nto decide an issue that is not properly before it.” Brief for\nPublic Citizen 6. “Absent grounds for reversing the court\nof appeals’ decision to deny permission to appeal,” Public\nCitizen asserted, “the merits of the district court’s decision\nare not before any appellate court, including this one.”\nIbid.\n  Satisfied that there are indeed “grounds for reversing\nthe [Tenth Circuit’s] decision to deny permission to ap-\npeal,” we find no jurisdictional barrier to our settlement of\nthe question presented. The case was “in” the Court of\nAppeals because of Dart’s leave-to-appeal application, and\nwe have jurisdiction to review what the Court of Appeals\ndid with that application. See 28 U. S.

This case fits that bill.3\n   There are many signals that the Tenth Circuit relied on\nthe legally erroneous premise that the District Court’s\ndecision was correct. In an earlier case, the Tenth Circuit,\nfollowing the First Circuit’s lead, stated considerations\nthat it regards as relevant to the intelligent exercise of\ndiscretion under §1453(c)(1). BP America, Inc. v. Okla-\nhoma ex rel. Edmondson, 613 F. 3d 1029, 1034–1035 (2010)\n(adopting factors set out in College of Dental Surgeons of\nPuerto Rico v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 585 F. 3d 33,\n38–39 (CA1 2009)).4 When the CAFA-related question\npresented in an appeal from a remand order is “important,\nunsettled, and recurrent,” the First Circuit instructed, a\ncourt of appeals should inquire: “Absent an interlocutory\nappeal, [will the question] in all probability escape mean-\ningful appellate review.” Id., at 39. Or, as phrased by the\nTenth Circuit, if a district court’s remand order remains\nundisturbed, will the case “leave the ambit of the federal\ncourts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the\ndefendant] to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [un-\nder CAFA] . . . to have a federal tribunal adjudicate the\nmerits.” BP America, 613 F. 3d, at 1035.

Thus,\n——————\n  3 JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissent (hereafter dissent) faults Dart for assert-\n\ning, late in the day, that the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion, observ-\ning that Dart did so only in its reply brief. Post, at 6. But Public\nCitizen teed up that issue after the parties filed their merits briefs. In\nview of this Court’s decision in Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U.

OWENS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Tenth Circuit’s own guide weighed heavily in favor of\naccepting Dart’s appeal. That the Court of Appeals, in-\nstead, rejected Dart’s appeal strongly suggests that the\npanel thought the District Court got it right in requiring\nproof of the amount in controversy in the removal notice.\n   In practical effect, the Court of Appeals’ denial of review\nestablished the law not simply for this case, but for future\nCAFA removals sought by defendants in the Tenth Cir-\ncuit. The likelihood is slim that a later case will arise in\nwhich the Tenth Circuit will face a plea to retract the rule\nthat both Owens and the District Court ascribed to deci-\nsions of the Court of Appeals: Defendants seeking to re-\nmove under CAFA must be sent back to state court unless\nthey submit with the notice of removal evidence proving\nthe alleged amount in controversy. See supra, at 3. On\nthis point, Judge Hartz’s observation, dissenting from the\nTenth Circuit’s denial of rehearing en banc, see supra, at\n4, bears recounting in full:\n     “After today’s decision any diligent attorney (and one\n     can assume that an attorney representing a defendant\n     in a case involving at least $5 million—the threshold\n     for removal under CAFA—would have substantial in-\n     centive to be diligent) would submit to the evidentiary\n     burden rather than take a chance on remand to state\n     court.” 730 F. 3d, at 1235.\nWith no responsible attorney likely to renew the fray,\nJudge Hartz anticipated, “the issue will not arise again.”\nIbid. Consequently, the law applied by the District\nCourt—demanding that the notice of removal contain\nevidence documenting the amount in controversy—will be\nfrozen in place for all venues within the Tenth Circuit.5\n——————\n  5 The  dissent suggests that the Tenth Circuit may have another op-\nportunity to set Circuit precedent straight: A lawyer may be irresponsi-\nble or fail to learn from Dart’s experience; or perhaps a lawyer will put\nin evidence the district court deems insufficient, and then have a go at\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Recall that the Court of Appeals denied Dart’s petition\nfor review “[u]pon careful consideration of the parties’\nsubmissions, as well as the applicable law.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 13a. What did the parties submit to the Tenth\nCircuit? Their presentations urged conflicting views on\nwhether a removing defendant must tender prima facie\nproof of the amount in controversy as part of the removal\nnotice. And what was “the applicable law” other than the\nrule recited by the Tenth Circuit in Laughlin and follow-on\ndecisions, i.e., to remove successfully, a defendant must\npresent with the notice of removal evidence proving the\namount in controversy.6\n  From all signals one can discern then, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit’s denial of Dart’s request for review of the remand\norder was infected by legal error. The District Court erred\nin ruling that Dart’s amount-in-controversy allegation\nfailed for want of proof, but that error was driven by the\nDistrict Court’s conscientious endeavor to follow Circuit\n\n——————\narguing that the evidence was sufficient and, in any event, “no evidence\nis required at all.” Post, at 5–6. That such a case will occur, and that\nthe Tenth Circuit would then seize the very opportunity it passed up in\nDart’s case, is hardly probable.\n   6 The dissent posits that “the applicable law” might have been some-\n\nthing other than the law governing the parties’ submissions. Post, at 3,\n4. That is a strained reading of the Tenth Circuit’s expression. Per-\nhaps the Tenth Circuit found this case a “poor vehicle,” the dissent\nsuggests, post, at 2, but no potential vehicle concerns were urged by\nOwens, and the dissent identifies none. Or the Tenth Circuit might\nhave doubted its “ability to quickly resolve the issue” within the 60-day\ntime limit provided in §1453(c)(2)–(3). Ibid.; see also post, at 4. Section\n1453(c)’s timing provision, however, was designed to promote expedi-\ntion, not to discourage Courts of Appeals from acting on petitions for\nappeal. As a third “maybe,” the dissent observes that proof of the\namount in controversy in removal notices is not “a question unique to\n[CAFA].” Post, at 3. True, the Tenth Circuit demands such proof in\nordinary diversity cases. See Laughlin v. Kmart Corp., 50 F. 3d 871,\n873 (1995). But that does not make the imposition one whit less in\nCAFA cases.\n12    DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprecedent. The parties trained their arguments in the\nTenth Circuit, as they did here, on the question whether\nDart could successfully remove without detailing in the\nremoval notice evidence of the amount in controversy. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 47 (acknowledgment by Owens’ counsel\nthat “the issues . . . provided to . . . the Tenth Circuit were\nvery similar to what you see in this Court, with the excep-\ntion of [the question raised by Public Citizen] whether this\nCourt has jurisdiction”). Dissenting from the denial of\nrehearing en banc, Judge Hartz explained at length why\nthe Tenth Circuit “owe[d] a duty to the bench and bar” to\ncorrect the District Court’s misperception and to state as\nthe Circuit’s law: “[A] defendant seeking removal under\nCAFA need only allege the jurisdictional amount in its\nnotice of removal and must prove that amount only if the\nplaintiff challenges the allegation.” 730 F. 3d, at 1234,\n1238. In this regard, we note, the Tenth Circuit has cau-\ntioned against casual rulings on applications like Dart’s.\n“The decision whether to grant leave to appeal” under\n§1453(c), the Tenth Circuit stressed, calls for the exercise\nof the reviewing court’s correctly “informed discretion.”\nBP America, 613 F. 3d, at 1035 (emphasis added); see\nsupra, at 8–9.\n   Recall, moreover, that Owens never suggested in his\nwritten submissions to this Court that anything other\nthan the question presented accounts for the Court of\nAppeals’ disposition. If Owens believed that the Tenth\nCircuit’s denial of leave to appeal rested on some other\nground, he might have said so in his brief in opposition or,\nat least, in his merits brief. See this Court’s Rule 15.2;\nGranite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S. 287, 306 (2010).\nHe said nothing of that order, for he, like Dart, antici-\npated that the question presented was ripe for this Court’s\nresolution.\n   In the above-described circumstances, we find it an\nabuse of discretion for the Tenth Circuit to deny Dart’s\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrequest for review. Doing so froze the governing rule in\nthe Circuit for this case and future CAFA removal notices,\nwith no opportunity for defendants in Dart’s position\nresponsibly to resist making the evidentiary submission.\nThat situation would be bizarre for a decisionmaker who\ndid not think that the amount in controversy in diversity\ncases is a matter a removal notice must demonstrate by\nevidence, not merely credibly allege.7 And if the Circuit\nprecedent on which the District Court relied misstated the\nlaw, as we hold it did, then the District Court’s order\nremanding this case to the state court is fatally infected by\nlegal error.\n  Careful inspection thus reveals that the two issues\nPublic Citizen invites us to separate—whether the Tenth\nCircuit abused its discretion in denying review, and\nwhether the District Court’s remand order was errone-\nous—do not pose genuinely discrete questions. Instead,\nresolution of both issues depends on the answer to the\nvery same question: What must the removal notice con-\ntain? If the notice need not contain evidence, the Tenth\nCircuit abused its discretion in effectively making the\nopposing view the law of the Circuit. By the same token,\nthe District Court erred in remanding the case for want of\nan evidentiary submission in the removal notice. We no\ndoubt have authority to review for abuse of discretion the\nTenth Circuit’s denial of Dart’s appeal from the District\nCourt’s remand order, see supra, at 8, and in doing so, to\n——————\n   7 Caution is in order when attributing a basis to an unreasoned deci-\n\nsion.

S. C. §1446(a). In accordance with what it thought to\nbe Tenth Circuit jurisprudence, the District Court inter-\npreted this to require evidence (as opposed to mere allega-\ntions) supporting federal jurisdiction. After finding that\nDart’s notice of removal did not include evidence of the\njurisdictionally required amount in controversy, the Dis-\ntrict Court remanded the case to state court. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 25a–28a. Dart sought permission to appeal this\norder under §1453(c)(1), which provides that “a court of\nappeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\ncourt granting or denying a motion to remand a class\naction to the State court from which it was removed”\n(emphasis added). Without stating its reasons, the Tenth\nCircuit issued an order denying Dart’s request. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 13a.\n   Eager to correct what we suspected was the District\nCourt’s (and the Tenth Circuit’s) erroneous interpretation\nof §1446(a), we granted certiorari to decide whether no-\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntices of removal must contain evidence supporting federal\njurisdiction. After briefing we discovered a little snag:\nThis case does not present that question. Because we are\nreviewing the Tenth Circuit’s judgment, the only question\nbefore us is whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discre-\ntion in denying Dart permission to appeal the District\nCourt’s remand order. Once we found out that the issue\npresented differed from the issue we granted certiorari to\nreview, the responsible course would have been to confess\nerror and to dismiss the case as improvidently granted.\n   The Court, however, insists on deciding whether the\nDistrict Court erred in remanding this case to state court.\nHow can it do that, one might ask, when the only issue in\nthis case concerns the propriety of the Tenth Circuit’s\nrejection of Dart’s appeal? The Court hits upon a solution:\nIt concludes that the Tenth Circuit decided not to hear the\nappeal because it agreed with the District Court’s analysis.\nAttributing the District Court’s reasoning to the Tenth\nCircuit allows the Court to pretend to review the appellate\ncourt’s exercise of discretion while actually reviewing the\ntrial court’s legal analysis.\n   There are problems with this approach that are, in a\nrational world, insuperable. To begin with, the Tenth\nCircuit’s short order does not tell us why it decided not to\nhear Dart’s appeal. It might have done so for an imper-\nmissible reason—for example, agreement with the District\nCourt’s legal reasoning. But it might instead have done so\nfor countless other, permissible, reasons—for example, a\nconcern that this would be a poor vehicle for deciding the\nissue presented by Dart’s appeal, or a concern regarding\nthe court’s ability to quickly resolve the issue, see\n§1453(c)(2)–(3) (providing that appeals accepted under\n§1453(c)(1) must be decided within 60 days, absent con-\nsent of the parties, with a 10-day extension for “good cause\nshown and in the interests of justice”).\n   Not long ago we held, unanimously, that “[a]n appellate\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncourt should not presume that a district court intended an\nincorrect legal result when the order is equally susceptible\nof a correct reading, particularly when the applicable\nstandard of review is deferential.” Sprint/United Man-\nagement Co. v. Mendelsohn, 552 U. S. 379, 386 (2008).\nThere, we corrected the Tenth Circuit for doing precisely\nwhat the Court itself does today in reviewing (deferen-\ntially) the Tenth Circuit’s denial of permission to appeal:\npresuming that the lower court adopted a legally errone-\nous argument advanced by one party. Id., at 384–385. We\nexplained to the Tenth Circuit that “it would be inappro-\npriate for the reviewing court to assume, absent indication\nin the District Court’s opinion, that the lower court adopted\na party’s incorrect argument.” Id., at 385, n. 2 (empha-\nsis added). Today, however, this Court blatantly violates\nthat rule.\n   The only “indication in the opinion” that the Court relies\non is the following language from the order denying per-\nmission to appeal: “Upon careful consideration of [1] the\nparties’ submissions, as well as [2] the applicable law, the\nPetition [for permission to appeal the remand order] is\ndenied.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a–14a. This, the Court\ntells us, means the Tenth Circuit must have denied Dart’s\npetition because it agreed with the District Court’s legal\nconclusion. Of course it means no such thing.\n   As for point [1], considering a submission is not the\nsame thing as agreeing with that submission. Worse still,\ncorrectness of the District Court’s opinion was not the only\nground that Owens’ brief in the Tenth Circuit urged to\nsupport denial of the petition for review. It noted, for\nexample, that the case addressed the general removal\nstatute, §1446(a), and so did not involve a question unique\nto the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA). Re-\nsponse to Petition for Permission to Appeal in No. 13–603,\np. 3. (The Tenth Circuit considers “the presence of an\nimportant CAFA-related question” a reason to accept an\n4     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nappeal. BP America, Inc. v. Oklahoma ex rel. Edmonson,\n613 F. 3d 1029, 1034 (2010) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).)\n   As for point [2], there is no reason whatever to believe\nthat the only “applicable law” the Tenth Circuit considered\nand relied on was the law relating to the correctness of the\nDistrict Court’s decision—i.e., the law interpreting\n§1446(a). After all, the “applicable law” surely includes\nthe law applicable to the disposition of petitions to appeal,\n§1453(c)(1), and that body of law includes countless rea-\nsons to deny permission to appeal that are unrelated to\nthe merits of the underlying district court judgment.\n“Applicable law” would allow the Tenth Circuit, for exam-\nple, to deny permission to appeal for reasons not men-\ntioned in the parties’ briefing. It would allow it to deny\npermission because it would be unable to resolve the issue\nwithin 60 days, as required by CAFA (absent an exten-\nsion). §1453(c)(2) and (c)(3); see also 730 F. 3d 1234, 1238\n(Hartz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (“It\nwill always be tempting for very busy judges to deny\nreview of a knotty matter that requires a decision in short\norder”). And “applicable law” would permit numerous\nother grounds for denial, including those applied by this\nCourt in denying petitions for certiorari. There is, to tell\nthe truth, absolutely nothing in the Tenth Circuit’s order\nto suggest that it relied on the unlawful ground that the\nCourt eagerly attributes to it, rather than one of many\npossible lawful grounds. Thus, as we said in Mendelsohn,\n“it would be inappropriate for the reviewing court [us] to\nassume . . . that the lower court adopted a party’s incorrect\nargument.” 552 U. S., at 385, n. 2.\n   Besides relying on the utterly uninformative language of\nthe order, the Court makes one other attempt to demon-\nstrate that the Tenth Circuit’s order was based upon its\nagreement with the holding of the District Court. It as-\nserts that denying Dart permission to appeal “froz[e] in\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nplace” the District Court’s rule. Ante, at 10. In light of\nthat denial, the Court says, any “responsible attorney” will\ninclude evidence supporting jurisdiction in his notice of\nremoval, thereby eliminating the risk of having that notice\nheld improper for the reason given by the District Court in\nthis case. As a result, the Tenth Circuit will likely never\nagain be presented with the question whether evidence of\njurisdiction must be included with a notice of removal.\nIbid. The Court then notes that, among the many factors\nthe Tenth Circuit considers in deciding whether to accept\nan appeal under §1453(c)(1), is whether the case presents\nan issue which, if not resolved in that appeal, will “leave\nthe ambit of the federal courts for good.” BP America,\nsupra, at 1035. One would have thought that this factor,\nif it controlled the Tenth Circuit’s denial, means that the\nTenth Circuit did not agree with the Court’s perception\nthat this issue will not likely reappear. The Court, how-\never, says (quite illogically) that it means the Tenth\nCircuit must have agreed with the District Court’s incorrect\nlegal analysis. It is hard to imagine a more obvious non\nsequitur.\n   And the argument not only tortures logic, it also distorts\nreality, resting as it does on the premise that henceforth\nno “responsible attorney” will fail to include evidence\nsupporting federal jurisdiction in a notice of removal.\nEven discounting the existence of irresponsible attorneys,\nbut see, e.g., Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___ (2012),\nresponsible attorneys, and even responsible judges, some-\ntimes make mistakes, see, e.g., 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (order\ngranting certiorari in this case). Indeed, Dart’s own\n(seemingly responsible) lawyers failed to include evidence\nsupporting federal jurisdiction, despite what they argue is\nCircuit precedent supporting the District Court’s holding.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 12 (counsel for Dart, explaining that\nthe District Court’s ruling was supported by Tenth Circuit\nprecedent).\n6     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Even in the legal utopia imagined by the Court—a world\nin which all lawyers are responsible and no lawyers make\nmistakes—it is easy to imagine ways in which the issue\ncould come back to the circuit court. If, for example, a\nparty appealed a district court decision addressing the\nsufficiency of the jurisdictional evidence, the Tenth Circuit\ncould accept the appeal and hold (en banc, if necessary)\nthat no evidence is required at all. In short, it is impos-\nsible to credit the suggestion (irrelevant in any case) that\nthe chances of this issue arising again were “slim.” Ante,\nat 10.\n   The Court attempts to bolster its conclusion with an\nunprincipled and unequal application of the waiver doc-\ntrine. Owens, it says, by failing to brief the argument that\nthe Tenth Circuit denied Dart’s petition for reasons other\nthan its agreement with the District Court’s decision,\nwaived that argument. Ante, at 12 (citing this Court’s\nRule 15.2). Dart, however, never made an argument that\nwould have called for such a response. It never argued\nthat the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying\npermission to appeal. Aside from one stray assertion on\nthe final page of its reply brief, its briefing focused entirely\non whether the District Court erred in remanding the case\nto state court. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners 9 (“This\nCourt should reverse the district court’s order remanding\nthe case to state court”). Rather than hold Dart responsi-\nble for failing to argue that the Tenth Circuit abused its\ndiscretion, see Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital,\nLtd., 573 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2014) (slip op., at 5, n. 2) (“We\nwill not revive a forfeited argument simply because the\npetitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief ”), the\nCourt makes the argument on Dart’s behalf and then\ntakes Owens to task for failing to refute it. This Court ought\nnot embrace such an oddhanded application of waiver\nprinciples.\n   The Court answers that Dart “had no cause to address”\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

Ante, at\n9, n. 3. Not good enough. First, parties always have\n“cause to address” issues on which their entitlement to\nrelief depends. Second, and more important, Public Citi-\nzen filed its amicus brief after both sides had already filed\ntheir merits briefs. So if the timing of that brief excuses\nDart’s failure to address whether the Tenth Circuit abused\nits discretion, it should excuse Owens’ failure as well.\n   I come, finally, to the Court’s stinging observation that I\njoined the majority opinion in Standard Fire Ins. Co. v.\nKnowles, 568 U. S. ___ (2013)—a case that arose in the\nsame posture as this one, but that was resolved without\nreference to the question whether the appellate court\nabused its discretion. Ante, at 8, n. 2. Of course Knowles\ndid not address whether denials of permission to appeal\nunder §1453(c)(1) are to be reviewed for abuse of discre-\ntion—which is why today’s majority cannot cite it as prec-\nedent. See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 630–631\n(1993).

S. C. §1254. Purporting to act pursuant to this grant of\njurisdiction, the majority today reviews the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals to deny an application for permission to\nappeal a remand order. But such an application is not a\ncase: It “ ‘does not assert a grievance against anyone, does\nnot seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does\nnot even require a “party” on the other side.’ ” Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 355 (2003) (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning) (quoting Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 256\n(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).\n   To justify its action here, the majority quietly extends\nan opinion of this Court holding that applications for\ncertificates of appealability (COAs) in the federal habeas\ncontext are “cases.” Hohn, supra. Hohn was wrongly\ndecided, and the majority’s uncritical extension of its\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nholding only compounds the error. Hohn rests tenuously\non the conclusion that the determination that must be\nmade on an application for a COA is more like a threshold\ndetermination than a separate judicial proceeding. See\nid., at 246–248. The basis for that conclusion, if any ex-\nists, must rest on features unique to the COA: “The COA\ndetermination . . . requires an overview of the claims in the\nhabeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.”\nMiller-El, supra, at 336 (emphasis added). The best ar-\ngument one could make in favor of Hohn is that, because a\ncourt’s decision on an application for a COA turns on the\nstrength of the applicant’s grievance and his entitlement\nto relief, the application absorbs the case-like qualities of\nthe underlying merits case. See Hohn, supra, at 248.\n   No such osmosis could transform an application for\npermission to appeal a remand order into a “case.” As\nJUSTICE SCALIA explains, the decision whether to permit\nsuch an appeal requires no assessment of the merits of a\nremand order. See ante, at 2 (dissenting opinion). The\napplication here is nothing more than a request for discre-\ntionary permission to seek review. See Miller-El, supra, at\n355 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The Tenth Circuit having\ndenied that permission, no “case” ever arrived “in the\ncourt of appeals.” I would dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n</pre>", "id": 2760669, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/12/15/dart_cherokee_basin_operating_co._v._owens.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

OWENS \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 13–719.      Argued October 7, 2014—Decided December 15, 2014\nA defendant seeking to remove a case from state to federal court must\n  file in the federal forum a notice of removal “containing a short and\n  plain statement of the grounds for removal.” 28 U. S. C. §1446(a).\n     Respondent Owens filed a putative class action in Kansas state\n  court, seeking compensation for damages class members allegedly\n  sustained when petitioners (collectively, Dart) underpaid royalties\n  due under certain oil and gas leases. Dart removed the case to the\n  Federal District Court, invoking the Class Action Fairness Act of\n  2005 (CAFA), which gives federal courts jurisdiction over class ac-\n  tions if the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, 28 U. S. C.\n  §1332(d)(2). Dart’s notice of removal alleged that the purported un-\n  derpayments totaled over $8.2 million. Owens moved to remand the\n  case to state court, asserting that the removal notice was “deficient\n  as a matter of law” because it included “no evidence” proving that the\n  amount in controversy exceeded $5 million. In response, Dart sub-\n  mitted an executive’s detailed declaration supporting an amount in\n  controversy in excess of $11 million. The District Court granted Ow-\n  ens’ remand motion, reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof\n  of the amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself. Dart pe-\n  titioned the Tenth Circuit for permission to appeal, see §1453(c)(1),\n  but that court denied review and rehearing en banc.\nHeld:\n    1. As specified in §1446(a), a defendant’s notice of removal need in-\n clude only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy ex-\n ceeds the jurisdictional threshold; the notice need not contain eviden-\n tiary submissions.\n    Section 1446(a) tracks the general pleading requirement stated in\n2        DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. By borrowing Rule\n    8(a)’s “short and plain statement” standard, corroborative history in-\n    dicates, Congress intended to clarify that courts should “apply the\n    same liberal rules [to removal allegations as] to other matters of\n    pleading.” H. R. Rep. No. 100–889, p. 71. The amount-in-controversy\n    allegation of a plaintiff invoking federal-court jurisdiction is accepted\n    if made in good faith. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,\n    429 U. S. 274, 276. Similarly, the amount-in-controversy allegation\n    of a defendant seeking federal-court adjudication should be accepted\n    when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court. In the\n    event that the plaintiff does contest the defendant’s allegations, both\n    sides submit proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the\n    evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been\n    satisfied, see §1446(c)(2)(B).\n       In remanding the case to state court, the District Court relied, in\n    part, on a purported “presumption” against removal, but no antire-\n    moval presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, a statute Congress\n    enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal\n    court. See Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S. ___, ___.\n    Pp. 4–7.\n       2. The District Court erred in remanding this case for want of an\n    evidentiary submission in the notice of removal, and the Tenth Cir-\n    cuit abused its discretion in denying review of that decision. Pp. 7–\n    14.\n          (a) This Court concludes that no jurisdictional barrier impedes\n    settlement of the question presented: whether evidence supporting\n    the amount in controversy must be included in a notice of removal.\n    The case was “in” the Tenth Circuit because of Dart’s application for\n    leave to appeal, and the Court has jurisdiction to review what the\n    Court of Appeals did with that application. See 28 U. S. C. §1254;\n    Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 248. Pp. 7–8.\n          (b) While appellate review of a remand order is discretionary, ex-\n    ercise of that discretion is not rudderless, see Highmark Inc. v. All-\n    care Health Management System, Inc., 572 U. S. ___, ___, and a court\n    “would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an er-\n    roneous view of the law,” Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n    384, 405. The Tenth Circuit had previously stated considerations\n    bearing on the intelligent exercise of discretion under §1453(c)(1).\n    One of those considerations is particularly relevant here: a court of\n    appeals should inquire whether, if a district court’s remand order\n    remains undisturbed, the case will “leave the ambit of the federal\n    courts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the defendant]\n    to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [under CAFA] . . . to have a\n    federal tribunal adjudicate the merits.” BP America, Inc. v. Oklaho-\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ma ex rel. Edmondson, 613 F. 3d 1029, 1035. Thus the Tenth Cir-\n  cuit’s own guide weighed heavily in favor of accepting Dart’s appeal.\n  In practical effect, the Court of Appeals’ denial of review established\n  the law—the requirement of proof of the amount in controversy in the\n  removal notice—not simply for this case, but for future CAFA remov-\n  als sought by defendants in the Tenth Circuit, leaving those defend-\n  ants with no realistic opportunity to resist making the evidentiary\n  submission.\n     The District Court, driven by its conscientious endeavor to follow\n  Circuit precedent, erred in ruling that Dart’s amount-in-controversy\n  allegation failed for want of proof. It was an abuse of discretion for\n  the Tenth Circuit to deny Dart’s request for review, for that disposi-\n  tion fastened on district courts within the Circuit an erroneous view\n  of the law. Contrary to the law the District Court derived from Tenth\n  Circuit precedent, a removal notice need only plausibly allege, not de-\n  tail proof of, the amount in controversy.Pp. 8–14.\nVacated and remanded.\n\n   GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

S. C. §1446(a). When re-\nmoval is based on diversity of citizenship, an amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement must be met. Ordinarily, “the\nmatter in controversy [must] excee[d] the sum or value of\n$75,000.” §1332(a). In class actions for which the re-\nquirement of diversity of citizenship is relaxed, §1332(d)\n(2)(A)–(C), “the matter in controversy [must] excee[d]\nthe sum or value of $5,000,000,” §1332(d)(2). If the\nplaintiff ’s complaint, filed in state court, demands mon-\netary relief of a stated sum, that sum, if asserted in\ngood faith, is “deemed to be the amount in controversy.”\n§1446(c)(2). When the plaintiff ’s complaint does not state\nthe amount in controversy, the defendant’s notice of re-\nmoval may do so. §1446(c)(2)(A).\n  To assert the amount in controversy adequately in the\nremoval notice, does it suffice to allege the requisite\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\namount plausibly, or must the defendant incorporate into\nthe notice of removal evidence supporting the allegation?\nThat is the single question argued here and below by the\nparties and the issue on which we granted review. The\nanswer, we hold, is supplied by the removal statute itself.\nA statement “short and plain” need not contain eviden-\ntiary submissions.\n                              I\n   Brandon W. Owens, plaintiff below and respondent\nhere, filed a putative class action in Kansas state court\nalleging that defendants Dart Cherokee Basin Operating\nCompany, LLC, and Cherokee Basin Pipeline, LLC (collec-\ntively, Dart), underpaid royalties owed to putative class\nmembers under certain oil and gas leases. The complaint\nsought “a fair and reasonable amount” to compensate\nputative class members for “damages” they sustained due\nto the alleged underpayments. App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a,\n35a.\n   Invoking federal jurisdiction under the Class Action\nFairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), Dart removed the case to the\nU. S. District Court for the District of Kansas. CAFA\ngives federal courts jurisdiction over certain class actions,\ndefined in §1332(d)(1), if the class has more than 100\nmembers, the parties are minimally diverse, and the\namount in controversy exceeds $5 million. §1332(d)(2),\n(5)(B); see Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3). Dart’s notice of removal\nalleged that all three requirements were satisfied. With\nrespect to the amount in controversy, Dart stated that the\npurported underpayments to putative class members\ntotaled more than $8.2 million.\n   Owens moved to remand the case to state court. The\nnotice of removal was “deficient as a matter of law,”\nOwens asserted, because it included “no evidence” proving\nthat the amount in controversy exceeded $5 million. App.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto Pet. for Cert. 46a, 53a. In response, Dart submitted a\ndeclaration by one of its executive officers. The declara-\ntion included a detailed damages calculation indicating\nthat the amount in controversy, sans interest, exceeded\n$11 million.     Without challenging Dart’s calculation,\nOwens urged that Dart’s amount-in-controversy submission\ncame too late. “[The] legally deficient [notice of removal],”\nOwens maintained, could not be cured by “post-removal\nevidence about the amount in controversy.” Id., at 100a.\n   Reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof of\nthe amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself,\nthe District Court granted Owens’ remand motion. Dart’s\ndeclaration, the District Court held, could not serve to\nkeep the case in federal court. The Tenth Circuit, as the\nDistrict Court read Circuit precedent, “has consistently\nheld that reference to factual allegations or evidence out-\nside of the petition and notice of removal is not permitted\nto determine the amount in controversy.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 26a, and n. 37 (citing Laughlin v. Kmart Corp.,\n50 F. 3d 871, 873 (1995); Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp.,\n251 F. 3d 1284, 1291, n. 4 (2001); Oklahoma Farm Bureau\nMut. Ins. Co. v. JSSJ Corp., 149 Fed. Appx. 775 (2005)).\n   Ordinarily, remand orders “[are] not reviewable on\nappeal or otherwise.” §1447(d). There is an exception,\nhowever, for cases invoking CAFA. §1453(c)(1). In such\ncases, “a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an\norder of a district court granting or denying a motion to\nremand.” Ibid. Citing this exception, Dart petitioned the\nTenth Circuit for permission to appeal. “Upon careful\nconsideration of the parties’ submissions, as well as the\napplicable law,” the Tenth Circuit panel, dividing two-to-\none, denied review. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a–14a.\n   An evenly divided court denied Dart’s petition for en\nbanc review. Dissenting from the denial of rehearing en\nbanc, Judge Hartz observed that the Tenth Circuit “[had]\nlet stand a district-court decision that will in effect impose\n4     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin this circuit requirements for notices of removal that are\neven more onerous than the code pleading requirements\nthat . . . federal courts abandoned long ago.” 730 F. 3d\n1234 (2013). The Tenth Circuit was duty-bound to grant\nDart’s petition for rehearing en banc, Judge Hartz urged,\nbecause the opportunity “to correct the law in our circuit”\nlikely would not arise again. Id., at 1235. Henceforth,\nJudge Hartz explained, “any diligent attorney . . . would\nsubmit to the evidentiary burden rather than take a\nchance on remand to state court.” Ibid.\n   Dart filed a petition for certiorari in this Court request-\ning resolution of the following question: “Whether a de-\nfendant seeking removal to federal court is required to\ninclude evidence supporting federal jurisdiction in the\nnotice of removal, or is alleging the required ‘short and\nplain statement of the grounds for removal’ enough?” Pet.\nfor Cert. i. Owens’ brief in opposition raised no impedi-\nment to this Court’s review. (Nor, later, did Owens’ merits\nbrief suggest any barrier to our consideration of Dart’s\npetition.) We granted certiorari to resolve a division\namong the Circuits on the question presented. 572 U. S.\n___ (2014). Compare Ellenburg v. Spartan Motors Chas-\nsis, Inc., 519 F. 3d 192, 200 (CA4 2008) (a removing party’s\nnotice of removal need not “meet a higher pleading stand-\nard than the one imposed on a plaintiff in drafting an\ninitial complaint”), and Spivey v. Vertrue, Inc., 528 F. 3d\n982, 986 (CA7 2008) (similar), with Laughlin, 50 F. 3d, at\n873 (“the requisite amount in controversy . . . must be\naffirmatively established on the face of either the petition\nor the removal notice”).\n                            II\n  As noted above, a defendant seeking to remove a case to\na federal court must file in the federal forum a notice of\nremoval “containing a short and plain statement of the\ngrounds for removal.” §1446(a). By design, §1446(a)\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntracks the general pleading requirement stated in Rule\n8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 14C C.\nWright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & J. Steinman, Federal\nPractice and Procedure §3733, pp. 639–641 (4th ed. 2009)\n(“Section 1446(a) requires only that the grounds for re-\nmoval be stated in ‘a short and plain statement’—terms\nborrowed from the pleading requirement set forth in Fed-\neral Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a).”). The legislative history\nof §1446(a) is corroborative. Congress, by borrowing the\nfamiliar “short and plain statement” standard from Rule\n8(a), intended to “simplify the ‘pleading’ requirements for\nremoval” and to clarify that courts should “apply the same\nliberal rules [to removal allegations] that are applied to\nother matters of pleading.” H. R. Rep. No. 100–889, p. 71\n(1988). See also ibid. (disapproving decisions requiring\n“detailed pleading”).\n   When a plaintiff invokes federal-court jurisdiction, the\nplaintiff ’s amount-in-controversy allegation is accepted if\nmade in good faith. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed.\nv. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 276 (1977) (“ ‘[T]he sum claimed by\nthe plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in\ngood faith.’ ”) (quoting St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v.\nRed Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283, 288 (1938); alteration in origi-\nnal). Similarly, when a defendant seeks federal-court\nadjudication, the defendant’s amount-in-controversy alle-\ngation should be accepted when not contested by the\nplaintiff or questioned by the court. Indeed, the Tenth\nCircuit, although not disturbing prior decisions demand-\ning proof together with the removal notice, recognized that\nit was anomalous to treat commencing plaintiffs and\nremoving defendants differently with regard to the\namount in controversy. See McPhail v. Deere & Co., 529\nF. 3d 947, 953 (2008) (requiring proof by defendant but not\nby plaintiff “bears no evident logical relationship either to\nthe purpose of diversity jurisdiction, or to the principle\nthat those who seek to invoke federal jurisdiction must\n6      DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nestablish its prerequisites”).\n  If the plaintiff contests the defendant’s allegation,\n§1446(c)(2)(B) instructs: “[R]emoval . . . is proper on the\nbasis of an amount in controversy asserted” by the defend-\nant “if the district court finds, by the preponderance of the\nevidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds” the\njurisdictional threshold.1 This provision, added to §1446\nas part of the Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue\nClarification Act of 2011 (JVCA), clarifies the procedure in\norder when a defendant’s assertion of the amount in con-\ntroversy is challenged. In such a case, both sides submit\nproof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement\nhas been satisfied. As the House Judiciary Committee\nReport on the JVCA observed:\n     “[D]efendants do not need to prove to a legal certainty\n     that the amount in controversy requirement has been\n     met. Rather, defendants may simply allege or assert\n     that the jurisdictional threshold has been met. Dis-\n     covery may be taken with regard to that question. In\n     case of a dispute, the district court must make find-\n     ings of jurisdictional fact to which the preponderance\n     standard applies.” H. R. Rep. No. 112–10, p. 16\n     (2011).\n\n——————\n   1 Section 1446(c)(2) applies to removals “sought on the basis of the\n\njurisdiction conferred by section 1332(a),” and §1446(c)(2)(B) provides\nthat “removal of the action is proper . . . [if] the amount in controversy\nexceeds the [in excess of $75,000] amount specified in section 1332(a)”\n(emphasis added). We assume, without deciding, a point the parties do\nnot dispute: Sections 1446(c)(2) and 1446(c)(2)(B) apply to cases re-\nmoved under §1332(d)(2), and removal is proper if the amount in\ncontroversy exceeds $5 million, the amount specified in §1332(d)(2).\nSee Frederick v.

Brief for\nDart 14.\n  In remanding the case to state court, the District Court\nrelied, in part, on a purported “presumption” against\nremoval. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. See, e.g., Laughlin, 50\nF. 3d, at 873 (“[T]here is a presumption against removal\njurisdiction.”). We need not here decide whether such a\npresumption is proper in mine-run diversity cases. It\nsuffices to point out that no antiremoval presumption\nattends cases invoking CAFA, which Congress enacted to\nfacilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal\ncourt. See Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (“CAFA’s primary objective” is to “ensur[e] ‘Fed-\neral court consideration of interstate cases of national\nimportance.’ ” (quoting §2(b)(2), 119 Stat. 5)); S. Rep. No.\n109–14, p. 43 (2005) (CAFA’s “provisions should be read\nbroadly, with a strong preference that interstate class\nactions should be heard in a federal court if properly re-\nmoved by any defendant.”).\n  In sum, as specified in §1446(a), a defendant’s notice of\nremoval need include only a plausible allegation that the\namount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional thresh-\nold. Evidence establishing the amount is required by\n§1446(c)(2)(B) only when the plaintiff contests, or the\ncourt questions, the defendant’s allegation.\n                             III\n  As in Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 2–3), we granted review in this case after the Court\nof Appeals declined to hear an appeal from a remand\norder. Neither party in that case or in this one questioned\nour review authority under 28 U. S. C. §1254(1) (“Cases in\nthe courts of appeals may be reviewed . . .

Because court of appeals\nreview of a remand order is discretionary, see supra, at 3,\nand the Tenth Circuit exercised its discretion to deny\nreview, Public Citizen urged, “[b]oth parties ask this Court\nto decide an issue that is not properly before it.” Brief for\nPublic Citizen 6. “Absent grounds for reversing the court\nof appeals’ decision to deny permission to appeal,” Public\nCitizen asserted, “the merits of the district court’s decision\nare not before any appellate court, including this one.”\nIbid.\n  Satisfied that there are indeed “grounds for reversing\nthe [Tenth Circuit’s] decision to deny permission to ap-\npeal,” we find no jurisdictional barrier to our settlement of\nthe question presented. The case was “in” the Court of\nAppeals because of Dart’s leave-to-appeal application, and\nwe have jurisdiction to review what the Court of Appeals\ndid with that application. See 28 U. S. C. §1254; Hohn v.\nUnited States, 524 U. S. 236, 248 (1998). Owens, we reit-\nerate, did not contest the scope of our review.\n  Discretion to review a remand order is not rudderless.\nSee Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System,\nInc., 572 U.

This case fits that bill.3\n   There are many signals that the Tenth Circuit relied on\nthe legally erroneous premise that the District Court’s\ndecision was correct. In an earlier case, the Tenth Circuit,\nfollowing the First Circuit’s lead, stated considerations\nthat it regards as relevant to the intelligent exercise of\ndiscretion under §1453(c)(1). BP America, Inc. v. Okla-\nhoma ex rel. Edmondson, 613 F. 3d 1029, 1034–1035 (2010)\n(adopting factors set out in College of Dental Surgeons of\nPuerto Rico v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 585 F. 3d 33,\n38–39 (CA1 2009)).4 When the CAFA-related question\npresented in an appeal from a remand order is “important,\nunsettled, and recurrent,” the First Circuit instructed, a\ncourt of appeals should inquire: “Absent an interlocutory\nappeal, [will the question] in all probability escape mean-\ningful appellate review.” Id., at 39. Or, as phrased by the\nTenth Circuit, if a district court’s remand order remains\nundisturbed, will the case “leave the ambit of the federal\ncourts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the\ndefendant] to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [un-\nder CAFA] . . . to have a federal tribunal adjudicate the\nmerits.” BP America, 613 F. 3d, at 1035. See also Coffey\nv. Freeport McMoran Copper & Gold, 581 F. 3d 1240, 1247\n(CA10 2009) (noting that “the purpose of §1453(c)(1) is\nto develop a body of appellate law interpreting CAFA”\n(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus,\n——————\n  3 JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissent (hereafter dissent) faults Dart for assert-\n\ning, late in the day, that the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion, observ-\ning that Dart did so only in its reply brief. Post, at 6. But Public\nCitizen teed up that issue after the parties filed their merits briefs. In\nview of this Court’s decision in Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U. S. ___,\nsee supra, at 7–8, the parties had no cause to address the matter\nearlier.\n  4 Neither court stated the listed considerations as an inflexible test.\n\nWe have no occasion in this case to review each of the factors identified\nby the First and Tenth Circuits.\n10        DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Tenth Circuit’s own guide weighed heavily in favor of\naccepting Dart’s appeal. That the Court of Appeals, in-\nstead, rejected Dart’s appeal strongly suggests that the\npanel thought the District Court got it right in requiring\nproof of the amount in controversy in the removal notice.\n   In practical effect, the Court of Appeals’ denial of review\nestablished the law not simply for this case, but for future\nCAFA removals sought by defendants in the Tenth Cir-\ncuit. The likelihood is slim that a later case will arise in\nwhich the Tenth Circuit will face a plea to retract the rule\nthat both Owens and the District Court ascribed to deci-\nsions of the Court of Appeals: Defendants seeking to re-\nmove under CAFA must be sent back to state court unless\nthey submit with the notice of removal evidence proving\nthe alleged amount in controversy. See supra, at 3. On\nthis point, Judge Hartz’s observation, dissenting from the\nTenth Circuit’s denial of rehearing en banc, see supra, at\n4, bears recounting in full:\n     “After today’s decision any diligent attorney (and one\n     can assume that an attorney representing a defendant\n     in a case involving at least $5 million—the threshold\n     for removal under CAFA—would have substantial in-\n     centive to be diligent) would submit to the evidentiary\n     burden rather than take a chance on remand to state\n     court.” 730 F. 3d, at 1235.\nWith no responsible attorney likely to renew the fray,\nJudge Hartz anticipated, “the issue will not arise again.”\nIbid. Consequently, the law applied by the District\nCourt—demanding that the notice of removal contain\nevidence documenting the amount in controversy—will be\nfrozen in place for all venues within the Tenth Circuit.5\n——————\n  5 The  dissent suggests that the Tenth Circuit may have another op-\nportunity to set Circuit precedent straight: A lawyer may be irresponsi-\nble or fail to learn from Dart’s experience; or perhaps a lawyer will put\nin evidence the district court deems insufficient, and then have a go at\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Recall that the Court of Appeals denied Dart’s petition\nfor review “[u]pon careful consideration of the parties’\nsubmissions, as well as the applicable law.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 13a. What did the parties submit to the Tenth\nCircuit? Their presentations urged conflicting views on\nwhether a removing defendant must tender prima facie\nproof of the amount in controversy as part of the removal\nnotice. And what was “the applicable law” other than the\nrule recited by the Tenth Circuit in Laughlin and follow-on\ndecisions, i.e., to remove successfully, a defendant must\npresent with the notice of removal evidence proving the\namount in controversy.6\n  From all signals one can discern then, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit’s denial of Dart’s request for review of the remand\norder was infected by legal error. The District Court erred\nin ruling that Dart’s amount-in-controversy allegation\nfailed for want of proof, but that error was driven by the\nDistrict Court’s conscientious endeavor to follow Circuit\n\n——————\narguing that the evidence was sufficient and, in any event, “no evidence\nis required at all.” Post, at 5–6. That such a case will occur, and that\nthe Tenth Circuit would then seize the very opportunity it passed up in\nDart’s case, is hardly probable.\n   6 The dissent posits that “the applicable law” might have been some-\n\nthing other than the law governing the parties’ submissions. Post, at 3,\n4. That is a strained reading of the Tenth Circuit’s expression. Per-\nhaps the Tenth Circuit found this case a “poor vehicle,” the dissent\nsuggests, post, at 2, but no potential vehicle concerns were urged by\nOwens, and the dissent identifies none. Or the Tenth Circuit might\nhave doubted its “ability to quickly resolve the issue” within the 60-day\ntime limit provided in §1453(c)(2)–(3). Ibid.; see also post, at 4. Section\n1453(c)’s timing provision, however, was designed to promote expedi-\ntion, not to discourage Courts of Appeals from acting on petitions for\nappeal. As a third “maybe,” the dissent observes that proof of the\namount in controversy in removal notices is not “a question unique to\n[CAFA].” Post, at 3. True, the Tenth Circuit demands such proof in\nordinary diversity cases. See Laughlin v. Kmart Corp., 50 F. 3d 871,\n873 (1995). But that does not make the imposition one whit less in\nCAFA cases.\n12    DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprecedent. The parties trained their arguments in the\nTenth Circuit, as they did here, on the question whether\nDart could successfully remove without detailing in the\nremoval notice evidence of the amount in controversy. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 47 (acknowledgment by Owens’ counsel\nthat “the issues . . . provided to . . . the Tenth Circuit were\nvery similar to what you see in this Court, with the excep-\ntion of [the question raised by Public Citizen] whether this\nCourt has jurisdiction”). Dissenting from the denial of\nrehearing en banc, Judge Hartz explained at length why\nthe Tenth Circuit “owe[d] a duty to the bench and bar” to\ncorrect the District Court’s misperception and to state as\nthe Circuit’s law: “[A] defendant seeking removal under\nCAFA need only allege the jurisdictional amount in its\nnotice of removal and must prove that amount only if the\nplaintiff challenges the allegation.” 730 F. 3d, at 1234,\n1238. In this regard, we note, the Tenth Circuit has cau-\ntioned against casual rulings on applications like Dart’s.\n“The decision whether to grant leave to appeal” under\n§1453(c), the Tenth Circuit stressed, calls for the exercise\nof the reviewing court’s correctly “informed discretion.”\nBP America, 613 F. 3d, at 1035 (emphasis added); see\nsupra, at 8–9.\n   Recall, moreover, that Owens never suggested in his\nwritten submissions to this Court that anything other\nthan the question presented accounts for the Court of\nAppeals’ disposition. If Owens believed that the Tenth\nCircuit’s denial of leave to appeal rested on some other\nground, he might have said so in his brief in opposition or,\nat least, in his merits brief. See this Court’s Rule 15.2;\nGranite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S. 287, 306 (2010).\nHe said nothing of that order, for he, like Dart, antici-\npated that the question presented was ripe for this Court’s\nresolution.\n   In the above-described circumstances, we find it an\nabuse of discretion for the Tenth Circuit to deny Dart’s\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrequest for review. Doing so froze the governing rule in\nthe Circuit for this case and future CAFA removal notices,\nwith no opportunity for defendants in Dart’s position\nresponsibly to resist making the evidentiary submission.\nThat situation would be bizarre for a decisionmaker who\ndid not think that the amount in controversy in diversity\ncases is a matter a removal notice must demonstrate by\nevidence, not merely credibly allege.7 And if the Circuit\nprecedent on which the District Court relied misstated the\nlaw, as we hold it did, then the District Court’s order\nremanding this case to the state court is fatally infected by\nlegal error.\n  Careful inspection thus reveals that the two issues\nPublic Citizen invites us to separate—whether the Tenth\nCircuit abused its discretion in denying review, and\nwhether the District Court’s remand order was errone-\nous—do not pose genuinely discrete questions. Instead,\nresolution of both issues depends on the answer to the\nvery same question: What must the removal notice con-\ntain? If the notice need not contain evidence, the Tenth\nCircuit abused its discretion in effectively making the\nopposing view the law of the Circuit. By the same token,\nthe District Court erred in remanding the case for want of\nan evidentiary submission in the removal notice. We no\ndoubt have authority to review for abuse of discretion the\nTenth Circuit’s denial of Dart’s appeal from the District\nCourt’s remand order, see supra, at 8, and in doing so, to\n——————\n   7 Caution is in order when attributing a basis to an unreasoned deci-\n\nsion.

S. C. §1446(a). In accordance with what it thought to\nbe Tenth Circuit jurisprudence, the District Court inter-\npreted this to require evidence (as opposed to mere allega-\ntions) supporting federal jurisdiction. After finding that\nDart’s notice of removal did not include evidence of the\njurisdictionally required amount in controversy, the Dis-\ntrict Court remanded the case to state court. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 25a–28a. Dart sought permission to appeal this\norder under §1453(c)(1), which provides that “a court of\nappeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\ncourt granting or denying a motion to remand a class\naction to the State court from which it was removed”\n(emphasis added). Without stating its reasons, the Tenth\nCircuit issued an order denying Dart’s request. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 13a.\n   Eager to correct what we suspected was the District\nCourt’s (and the Tenth Circuit’s) erroneous interpretation\nof §1446(a), we granted certiorari to decide whether no-\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntices of removal must contain evidence supporting federal\njurisdiction. After briefing we discovered a little snag:\nThis case does not present that question. Because we are\nreviewing the Tenth Circuit’s judgment, the only question\nbefore us is whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discre-\ntion in denying Dart permission to appeal the District\nCourt’s remand order. Once we found out that the issue\npresented differed from the issue we granted certiorari to\nreview, the responsible course would have been to confess\nerror and to dismiss the case as improvidently granted.\n   The Court, however, insists on deciding whether the\nDistrict Court erred in remanding this case to state court.\nHow can it do that, one might ask, when the only issue in\nthis case concerns the propriety of the Tenth Circuit’s\nrejection of Dart’s appeal? The Court hits upon a solution:\nIt concludes that the Tenth Circuit decided not to hear the\nappeal because it agreed with the District Court’s analysis.\nAttributing the District Court’s reasoning to the Tenth\nCircuit allows the Court to pretend to review the appellate\ncourt’s exercise of discretion while actually reviewing the\ntrial court’s legal analysis.\n   There are problems with this approach that are, in a\nrational world, insuperable. To begin with, the Tenth\nCircuit’s short order does not tell us why it decided not to\nhear Dart’s appeal. It might have done so for an imper-\nmissible reason—for example, agreement with the District\nCourt’s legal reasoning. But it might instead have done so\nfor countless other, permissible, reasons—for example, a\nconcern that this would be a poor vehicle for deciding the\nissue presented by Dart’s appeal, or a concern regarding\nthe court’s ability to quickly resolve the issue, see\n§1453(c)(2)–(3) (providing that appeals accepted under\n§1453(c)(1) must be decided within 60 days, absent con-\nsent of the parties, with a 10-day extension for “good cause\nshown and in the interests of justice”).\n   Not long ago we held, unanimously, that “[a]n appellate\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncourt should not presume that a district court intended an\nincorrect legal result when the order is equally susceptible\nof a correct reading, particularly when the applicable\nstandard of review is deferential.” Sprint/United Man-\nagement Co. v. Mendelsohn, 552 U. S. 379, 386 (2008).\nThere, we corrected the Tenth Circuit for doing precisely\nwhat the Court itself does today in reviewing (deferen-\ntially) the Tenth Circuit’s denial of permission to appeal:\npresuming that the lower court adopted a legally errone-\nous argument advanced by one party. Id., at 384–385. We\nexplained to the Tenth Circuit that “it would be inappro-\npriate for the reviewing court to assume, absent indication\nin the District Court’s opinion, that the lower court adopted\na party’s incorrect argument.” Id., at 385, n. 2 (empha-\nsis added). Today, however, this Court blatantly violates\nthat rule.\n   The only “indication in the opinion” that the Court relies\non is the following language from the order denying per-\nmission to appeal: “Upon careful consideration of [1] the\nparties’ submissions, as well as [2] the applicable law, the\nPetition [for permission to appeal the remand order] is\ndenied.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a–14a. This, the Court\ntells us, means the Tenth Circuit must have denied Dart’s\npetition because it agreed with the District Court’s legal\nconclusion. Of course it means no such thing.\n   As for point [1], considering a submission is not the\nsame thing as agreeing with that submission. Worse still,\ncorrectness of the District Court’s opinion was not the only\nground that Owens’ brief in the Tenth Circuit urged to\nsupport denial of the petition for review. It noted, for\nexample, that the case addressed the general removal\nstatute, §1446(a), and so did not involve a question unique\nto the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA). Re-\nsponse to Petition for Permission to Appeal in No. 13–603,\np. 3. (The Tenth Circuit considers “the presence of an\nimportant CAFA-related question” a reason to accept an\n4     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nappeal. BP America, Inc. v. Oklahoma ex rel. Edmonson,\n613 F. 3d 1029, 1034 (2010) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).)\n   As for point [2], there is no reason whatever to believe\nthat the only “applicable law” the Tenth Circuit considered\nand relied on was the law relating to the correctness of the\nDistrict Court’s decision—i.e., the law interpreting\n§1446(a). After all, the “applicable law” surely includes\nthe law applicable to the disposition of petitions to appeal,\n§1453(c)(1), and that body of law includes countless rea-\nsons to deny permission to appeal that are unrelated to\nthe merits of the underlying district court judgment.\n“Applicable law” would allow the Tenth Circuit, for exam-\nple, to deny permission to appeal for reasons not men-\ntioned in the parties’ briefing. It would allow it to deny\npermission because it would be unable to resolve the issue\nwithin 60 days, as required by CAFA (absent an exten-\nsion). §1453(c)(2) and (c)(3); see also 730 F. 3d 1234, 1238\n(Hartz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (“It\nwill always be tempting for very busy judges to deny\nreview of a knotty matter that requires a decision in short\norder”). And “applicable law” would permit numerous\nother grounds for denial, including those applied by this\nCourt in denying petitions for certiorari. There is, to tell\nthe truth, absolutely nothing in the Tenth Circuit’s order\nto suggest that it relied on the unlawful ground that the\nCourt eagerly attributes to it, rather than one of many\npossible lawful grounds. Thus, as we said in Mendelsohn,\n“it would be inappropriate for the reviewing court [us] to\nassume . . . that the lower court adopted a party’s incorrect\nargument.” 552 U. S., at 385, n. 2.\n   Besides relying on the utterly uninformative language of\nthe order, the Court makes one other attempt to demon-\nstrate that the Tenth Circuit’s order was based upon its\nagreement with the holding of the District Court. It as-\nserts that denying Dart permission to appeal “froz[e] in\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nplace” the District Court’s rule. Ante, at 10. In light of\nthat denial, the Court says, any “responsible attorney” will\ninclude evidence supporting jurisdiction in his notice of\nremoval, thereby eliminating the risk of having that notice\nheld improper for the reason given by the District Court in\nthis case. As a result, the Tenth Circuit will likely never\nagain be presented with the question whether evidence of\njurisdiction must be included with a notice of removal.\nIbid. The Court then notes that, among the many factors\nthe Tenth Circuit considers in deciding whether to accept\nan appeal under §1453(c)(1), is whether the case presents\nan issue which, if not resolved in that appeal, will “leave\nthe ambit of the federal courts for good.” BP America,\nsupra, at 1035. One would have thought that this factor,\nif it controlled the Tenth Circuit’s denial, means that the\nTenth Circuit did not agree with the Court’s perception\nthat this issue will not likely reappear. The Court, how-\never, says (quite illogically) that it means the Tenth\nCircuit must have agreed with the District Court’s incorrect\nlegal analysis. It is hard to imagine a more obvious non\nsequitur.\n   And the argument not only tortures logic, it also distorts\nreality, resting as it does on the premise that henceforth\nno “responsible attorney” will fail to include evidence\nsupporting federal jurisdiction in a notice of removal.\nEven discounting the existence of irresponsible attorneys,\nbut see, e.g., Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___ (2012),\nresponsible attorneys, and even responsible judges, some-\ntimes make mistakes, see, e.g., 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (order\ngranting certiorari in this case). Indeed, Dart’s own\n(seemingly responsible) lawyers failed to include evidence\nsupporting federal jurisdiction, despite what they argue is\nCircuit precedent supporting the District Court’s holding.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 12 (counsel for Dart, explaining that\nthe District Court’s ruling was supported by Tenth Circuit\nprecedent).\n6     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Even in the legal utopia imagined by the Court—a world\nin which all lawyers are responsible and no lawyers make\nmistakes—it is easy to imagine ways in which the issue\ncould come back to the circuit court. If, for example, a\nparty appealed a district court decision addressing the\nsufficiency of the jurisdictional evidence, the Tenth Circuit\ncould accept the appeal and hold (en banc, if necessary)\nthat no evidence is required at all. In short, it is impos-\nsible to credit the suggestion (irrelevant in any case) that\nthe chances of this issue arising again were “slim.” Ante,\nat 10.\n   The Court attempts to bolster its conclusion with an\nunprincipled and unequal application of the waiver doc-\ntrine. Owens, it says, by failing to brief the argument that\nthe Tenth Circuit denied Dart’s petition for reasons other\nthan its agreement with the District Court’s decision,\nwaived that argument. Ante, at 12 (citing this Court’s\nRule 15.2). Dart, however, never made an argument that\nwould have called for such a response. It never argued\nthat the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying\npermission to appeal. Aside from one stray assertion on\nthe final page of its reply brief, its briefing focused entirely\non whether the District Court erred in remanding the case\nto state court. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners 9 (“This\nCourt should reverse the district court’s order remanding\nthe case to state court”). Rather than hold Dart responsi-\nble for failing to argue that the Tenth Circuit abused its\ndiscretion, see Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital,\nLtd., 573 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2014) (slip op., at 5, n. 2) (“We\nwill not revive a forfeited argument simply because the\npetitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief ”), the\nCourt makes the argument on Dart’s behalf and then\ntakes Owens to task for failing to refute it. This Court ought\nnot embrace such an oddhanded application of waiver\nprinciples.\n   The Court answers that Dart “had no cause to address”\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwhether the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion until the\nissue was raised in Public Citizen’s amicus brief. Ante, at\n9, n. 3. Not good enough. First, parties always have\n“cause to address” issues on which their entitlement to\nrelief depends. Second, and more important, Public Citi-\nzen filed its amicus brief after both sides had already filed\ntheir merits briefs. So if the timing of that brief excuses\nDart’s failure to address whether the Tenth Circuit abused\nits discretion, it should excuse Owens’ failure as well.\n   I come, finally, to the Court’s stinging observation that I\njoined the majority opinion in Standard Fire Ins. Co. v.\nKnowles, 568 U. S. ___ (2013)—a case that arose in the\nsame posture as this one, but that was resolved without\nreference to the question whether the appellate court\nabused its discretion. Ante, at 8, n. 2. Of course Knowles\ndid not address whether denials of permission to appeal\nunder §1453(c)(1) are to be reviewed for abuse of discre-\ntion—which is why today’s majority cannot cite it as prec-\nedent. See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 630–631\n(1993). As for my own culpability in overlooking the issue,\nI must accept that and will take it with me to the grave.\nBut its irrelevance to my vote in the present case has been\nwell expressed by Justice Jackson, in a passage quoted by\nthe author of today’s opinion: “I see no reason why I\nshould be consciously wrong today because I was uncon-\nsciously wrong yesterday.”         Massachusetts v. United\nStates, 333 U. S. 611, 639–640 (1948) (dissenting opinion),\nquoted in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U. S.\n___, ___, n. 11 (2014) (slip op., at 12, n. 11) (GINSBURG J.,\ndissenting).\n                        *    *    *\n  Instead of correcting an erroneous district court opinion\nat the expense of an erroneous Supreme Court opinion, I\nwould have dismissed this case as improvidently granted.\nFailing that, my vote is to affirm the Court of Appeals,\n8    DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v.

S. C. §1254. Purporting to act pursuant to this grant of\njurisdiction, the majority today reviews the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals to deny an application for permission to\nappeal a remand order. But such an application is not a\ncase: It “ ‘does not assert a grievance against anyone, does\nnot seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does\nnot even require a “party” on the other side.’ ” Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 355 (2003) (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning) (quoting Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 256\n(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).\n   To justify its action here, the majority quietly extends\nan opinion of this Court holding that applications for\ncertificates of appealability (COAs) in the federal habeas\ncontext are “cases.” Hohn, supra. Hohn was wrongly\ndecided, and the majority’s uncritical extension of its\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nholding only compounds the error. Hohn rests tenuously\non the conclusion that the determination that must be\nmade on an application for a COA is more like a threshold\ndetermination than a separate judicial proceeding. See\nid., at 246–248. The basis for that conclusion, if any ex-\nists, must rest on features unique to the COA: “The COA\ndetermination . . . requires an overview of the claims in the\nhabeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.”\nMiller-El, supra, at 336 (emphasis added). The best ar-\ngument one could make in favor of Hohn is that, because a\ncourt’s decision on an application for a COA turns on the\nstrength of the applicant’s grievance and his entitlement\nto relief, the application absorbs the case-like qualities of\nthe underlying merits case. See Hohn, supra, at 248.\n   No such osmosis could transform an application for\npermission to appeal a remand order into a “case.” As\nJUSTICE SCALIA explains, the decision whether to permit\nsuch an appeal requires no assessment of the merits of a\nremand order. See ante, at 2 (dissenting opinion). The\napplication here is nothing more than a request for discre-\ntionary permission to seek review. See Miller-El, supra, at\n355 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The Tenth Circuit having\ndenied that permission, no “case” ever arrived “in the\ncourt of appeals.” I would dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2760669/", "sha1": "b4afbd86009390fe8a4bf9bb90e1302dc2200604", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2014-12-15T08:01:03.673689"}
