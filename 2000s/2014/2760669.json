OWENS \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 13\u2013719.      Argued October 7, 2014\u2014Decided December 15, 2014\nA defendant seeking to remove a case from state to federal court must\n  file in the federal forum a notice of removal \u201ccontaining a short and\n  plain statement of the grounds for removal.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71446(a).\n     Respondent Owens filed a putative class action in Kansas state\n  court, seeking compensation for damages class members allegedly\n  sustained when petitioners (collectively, Dart) underpaid royalties\n  due under certain oil and gas leases. Dart removed the case to the\n  Federal District Court, invoking the Class Action Fairness Act of\n  2005 (CAFA), which gives federal courts jurisdiction over class ac-\n  tions if the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, 28 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71332(d)(2). Dart\u2019s notice of removal alleged that the purported un-\n  derpayments totaled over $8.2 million. Owens moved to remand the\n  case to state court, asserting that the removal notice was \u201cdeficient\n  as a matter of law\u201d because it included \u201cno evidence\u201d proving that the\n  amount in controversy exceeded $5 million. In response, Dart sub-\n  mitted an executive\u2019s detailed declaration supporting an amount in\n  controversy in excess of $11 million. The District Court granted Ow-\n  ens\u2019 remand motion, reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof\n  of the amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself. Dart pe-\n  titioned the Tenth Circuit for permission to appeal, see \u00a71453(c)(1),\n  but that court denied review and rehearing en banc.\nHeld:\n    1. As specified in \u00a71446(a), a defendant\u2019s notice of removal need in-\n clude only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy ex-\n ceeds the jurisdictional threshold; the notice need not contain eviden-\n tiary submissions.\n    Section 1446(a) tracks the general pleading requirement stated in\n2        DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. By borrowing Rule\n    8(a)\u2019s \u201cshort and plain statement\u201d standard, corroborative history in-\n    dicates, Congress intended to clarify that courts should \u201capply the\n    same liberal rules [to removal allegations as] to other matters of\n    pleading.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 100\u2013889, p. 71. The amount-in-controversy\n    allegation of a plaintiff invoking federal-court jurisdiction is accepted\n    if made in good faith. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,\n    429 U. S. 274, 276. Similarly, the amount-in-controversy allegation\n    of a defendant seeking federal-court adjudication should be accepted\n    when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court. In the\n    event that the plaintiff does contest the defendant\u2019s allegations, both\n    sides submit proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the\n    evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been\n    satisfied, see \u00a71446(c)(2)(B).\n       In remanding the case to state court, the District Court relied, in\n    part, on a purported \u201cpresumption\u201d against removal, but no antire-\n    moval presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, a statute Congress\n    enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal\n    court. See Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S. ___, ___.\n    Pp. 4\u20137.\n       2. The District Court erred in remanding this case for want of an\n    evidentiary submission in the notice of removal, and the Tenth Cir-\n    cuit abused its discretion in denying review of that decision. Pp. 7\u2013\n    14.\n          (a) This Court concludes that no jurisdictional barrier impedes\n    settlement of the question presented: whether evidence supporting\n    the amount in controversy must be included in a notice of removal.\n    The case was \u201cin\u201d the Tenth Circuit because of Dart\u2019s application for\n    leave to appeal, and the Court has jurisdiction to review what the\n    Court of Appeals did with that application. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71254;\n    Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 248. Pp. 7\u20138.\n          (b) While appellate review of a remand order is discretionary, ex-\n    ercise of that discretion is not rudderless, see Highmark Inc. v. All-\n    care Health Management System, Inc., 572 U. S. ___, ___, and a court\n    \u201cwould necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an er-\n    roneous view of the law,\u201d Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n    384, 405. The Tenth Circuit had previously stated considerations\n    bearing on the intelligent exercise of discretion under \u00a71453(c)(1).\n    One of those considerations is particularly relevant here: a court of\n    appeals should inquire whether, if a district court\u2019s remand order\n    remains undisturbed, the case will \u201cleave the ambit of the federal\n    courts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the defendant]\n    to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [under CAFA] . . . to have a\n    federal tribunal adjudicate the merits.\u201d BP America, Inc. v. Oklaho-\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ma ex rel. Edmondson, 613 F. 3d 1029, 1035. Thus the Tenth Cir-\n  cuit\u2019s own guide weighed heavily in favor of accepting Dart\u2019s appeal.\n  In practical effect, the Court of Appeals\u2019 denial of review established\n  the law\u2014the requirement of proof of the amount in controversy in the\n  removal notice\u2014not simply for this case, but for future CAFA remov-\n  als sought by defendants in the Tenth Circuit, leaving those defend-\n  ants with no realistic opportunity to resist making the evidentiary\n  submission.\n     The District Court, driven by its conscientious endeavor to follow\n  Circuit precedent, erred in ruling that Dart\u2019s amount-in-controversy\n  allegation failed for want of proof. It was an abuse of discretion for\n  the Tenth Circuit to deny Dart\u2019s request for review, for that disposi-\n  tion fastened on district courts within the Circuit an erroneous view\n  of the law. Contrary to the law the District Court derived from Tenth\n  Circuit precedent, a removal notice need only plausibly allege, not de-\n  tail proof of, the amount in controversy.Pp. 8\u201314.\nVacated and remanded.\n\n   GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

OWENS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [December 15, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  To remove a case from a state court to a federal court, a\ndefendant must file in the federal forum a notice of re-\nmoval \u201ccontaining a short and plain statement of the\ngrounds for removal.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71446(a). When re-\nmoval is based on diversity of citizenship, an amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement must be met. Ordinarily, \u201cthe\nmatter in controversy [must] excee[d] the sum or value of\n$75,000.\u201d \u00a71332(a). In class actions for which the re-\nquirement of diversity of citizenship is relaxed, \u00a71332(d)\n(2)(A)\u2013(C), \u201cthe matter in controversy [must] excee[d]\nthe sum or value of $5,000,000,\u201d \u00a71332(d)(2). If the\nplaintiff \u2019s complaint, filed in state court, demands mon-\netary relief of a stated sum, that sum, if asserted in\ngood faith, is \u201cdeemed to be the amount in controversy.\u201d\n\u00a71446(c)(2). When the plaintiff \u2019s complaint does not state\nthe amount in controversy, the defendant\u2019s notice of re-\nmoval may do so. \u00a71446(c)(2)(A).\n  To assert the amount in controversy adequately in the\nremoval notice, does it suffice to allege the requisite\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\namount plausibly, or must the defendant incorporate into\nthe notice of removal evidence supporting the allegation?\nThat is the single question argued here and below by the\nparties and the issue on which we granted review. The\nanswer, we hold, is supplied by the removal statute itself.\nA statement \u201cshort and plain\u201d need not contain eviden-\ntiary submissions.\n                              I\n   Brandon W. Owens, plaintiff below and respondent\nhere, filed a putative class action in Kansas state court\nalleging that defendants Dart Cherokee Basin Operating\nCompany, LLC, and Cherokee Basin Pipeline, LLC (collec-\ntively, Dart), underpaid royalties owed to putative class\nmembers under certain oil and gas leases. The complaint\nsought \u201ca fair and reasonable amount\u201d to compensate\nputative class members for \u201cdamages\u201d they sustained due\nto the alleged underpayments. App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a,\n35a.\n   Invoking federal jurisdiction under the Class Action\nFairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), Dart removed the case to the\nU. S. District Court for the District of Kansas. CAFA\ngives federal courts jurisdiction over certain class actions,\ndefined in \u00a71332(d)(1), if the class has more than 100\nmembers, the parties are minimally diverse, and the\namount in controversy exceeds $5 million. \u00a71332(d)(2),\n(5)(B); see Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3). Dart\u2019s notice of removal\nalleged that all three requirements were satisfied. With\nrespect to the amount in controversy, Dart stated that the\npurported underpayments to putative class members\ntotaled more than $8.2 million.\n   Owens moved to remand the case to state court. The\nnotice of removal was \u201cdeficient as a matter of law,\u201d\nOwens asserted, because it included \u201cno evidence\u201d proving\nthat the amount in controversy exceeded $5 million. App.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto Pet. for Cert. 46a, 53a. In response, Dart submitted a\ndeclaration by one of its executive officers. The declara-\ntion included a detailed damages calculation indicating\nthat the amount in controversy, sans interest, exceeded\n$11 million.     Without challenging Dart\u2019s calculation,\nOwens urged that Dart\u2019s amount-in-controversy submission\ncame too late. \u201c[The] legally deficient [notice of removal],\u201d\nOwens maintained, could not be cured by \u201cpost-removal\nevidence about the amount in controversy.\u201d Id., at 100a.\n   Reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof of\nthe amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself,\nthe District Court granted Owens\u2019 remand motion. Dart\u2019s\ndeclaration, the District Court held, could not serve to\nkeep the case in federal court. The Tenth Circuit, as the\nDistrict Court read Circuit precedent, \u201chas consistently\nheld that reference to factual allegations or evidence out-\nside of the petition and notice of removal is not permitted\nto determine the amount in controversy.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 26a, and n. 37 (citing Laughlin v. Kmart Corp.,\n50 F. 3d 871, 873 (1995); Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp.,\n251 F. 3d 1284, 1291, n. 4 (2001); Oklahoma Farm Bureau\nMut. Ins. Co. v. JSSJ Corp., 149 Fed. Appx. 775 (2005)).\n   Ordinarily, remand orders \u201c[are] not reviewable on\nappeal or otherwise.\u201d \u00a71447(d). There is an exception,\nhowever, for cases invoking CAFA. \u00a71453(c)(1). In such\ncases, \u201ca court of appeals may accept an appeal from an\norder of a district court granting or denying a motion to\nremand.\u201d Ibid. Citing this exception, Dart petitioned the\nTenth Circuit for permission to appeal. \u201cUpon careful\nconsideration of the parties\u2019 submissions, as well as the\napplicable law,\u201d the Tenth Circuit panel, dividing two-to-\none, denied review. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a\u201314a.\n   An evenly divided court denied Dart\u2019s petition for en\nbanc review. Dissenting from the denial of rehearing en\nbanc, Judge Hartz observed that the Tenth Circuit \u201c[had]\nlet stand a district-court decision that will in effect impose\n4     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin this circuit requirements for notices of removal that are\neven more onerous than the code pleading requirements\nthat . . . federal courts abandoned long ago.\u201d 730 F. 3d\n1234 (2013). The Tenth Circuit was duty-bound to grant\nDart\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc, Judge Hartz urged,\nbecause the opportunity \u201cto correct the law in our circuit\u201d\nlikely would not arise again. Id., at 1235. Henceforth,\nJudge Hartz explained, \u201cany diligent attorney . . . would\nsubmit to the evidentiary burden rather than take a\nchance on remand to state court.\u201d Ibid.\n   Dart filed a petition for certiorari in this Court request-\ning resolution of the following question: \u201cWhether a de-\nfendant seeking removal to federal court is required to\ninclude evidence supporting federal jurisdiction in the\nnotice of removal, or is alleging the required \u2018short and\nplain statement of the grounds for removal\u2019 enough?\u201d Pet.\nfor Cert. i. Owens\u2019 brief in opposition raised no impedi-\nment to this Court\u2019s review. (Nor, later, did Owens\u2019 merits\nbrief suggest any barrier to our consideration of Dart\u2019s\npetition.) We granted certiorari to resolve a division\namong the Circuits on the question presented. 572 U. S.\n___ (2014). Compare Ellenburg v. Spartan Motors Chas-\nsis, Inc., 519 F. 3d 192, 200 (CA4 2008) (a removing party\u2019s\nnotice of removal need not \u201cmeet a higher pleading stand-\nard than the one imposed on a plaintiff in drafting an\ninitial complaint\u201d), and Spivey v.

S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntracks the general pleading requirement stated in Rule\n8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 14C C.\nWright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & J. Steinman, Federal\nPractice and Procedure \u00a73733, pp. 639\u2013641 (4th ed. 2009)\n(\u201cSection 1446(a) requires only that the grounds for re-\nmoval be stated in \u2018a short and plain statement\u2019\u2014terms\nborrowed from the pleading requirement set forth in Fed-\neral Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a).\u201d). The legislative history\nof \u00a71446(a) is corroborative. Congress, by borrowing the\nfamiliar \u201cshort and plain statement\u201d standard from Rule\n8(a), intended to \u201csimplify the \u2018pleading\u2019 requirements for\nremoval\u201d and to clarify that courts should \u201capply the same\nliberal rules [to removal allegations] that are applied to\nother matters of pleading.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 100\u2013889, p. 71\n(1988). See also ibid. (disapproving decisions requiring\n\u201cdetailed pleading\u201d).\n   When a plaintiff invokes federal-court jurisdiction, the\nplaintiff \u2019s amount-in-controversy allegation is accepted if\nmade in good faith. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed.\nv. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 276 (1977) (\u201c \u2018[T]he sum claimed by\nthe plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in\ngood faith.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v.\nRed Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283, 288 (1938); alteration in origi-\nnal). Similarly, when a defendant seeks federal-court\nadjudication, the defendant\u2019s amount-in-controversy alle-\ngation should be accepted when not contested by the\nplaintiff or questioned by the court. Indeed, the Tenth\nCircuit, although not disturbing prior decisions demand-\ning proof together with the removal notice, recognized that\nit was anomalous to treat commencing plaintiffs and\nremoving defendants differently with regard to the\namount in controversy. See McPhail v. Deere & Co., 529\nF. 3d 947, 953 (2008) (requiring proof by defendant but not\nby plaintiff \u201cbears no evident logical relationship either to\nthe purpose of diversity jurisdiction, or to the principle\nthat those who seek to invoke federal jurisdiction must\n6      DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nestablish its prerequisites\u201d).\n  If the plaintiff contests the defendant\u2019s allegation,\n\u00a71446(c)(2)(B) instructs: \u201c[R]emoval . . . is proper on the\nbasis of an amount in controversy asserted\u201d by the defend-\nant \u201cif the district court finds, by the preponderance of the\nevidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds\u201d the\njurisdictional threshold.1 This provision, added to \u00a71446\nas part of the Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue\nClarification Act of 2011 (JVCA), clarifies the procedure in\norder when a defendant\u2019s assertion of the amount in con-\ntroversy is challenged. In such a case, both sides submit\nproof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement\nhas been satisfied. As the House Judiciary Committee\nReport on the JVCA observed:\n     \u201c[D]efendants do not need to prove to a legal certainty\n     that the amount in controversy requirement has been\n     met. Rather, defendants may simply allege or assert\n     that the jurisdictional threshold has been met. Dis-\n     covery may be taken with regard to that question. In\n     case of a dispute, the district court must make find-\n     ings of jurisdictional fact to which the preponderance\n     standard applies.\u201d H. R. Rep.

Brief for\nDart 14.\n  In remanding the case to state court, the District Court\nrelied, in part, on a purported \u201cpresumption\u201d against\nremoval. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. See, e.g., Laughlin, 50\nF. 3d, at 873 (\u201c[T]here is a presumption against removal\njurisdiction.\u201d). We need not here decide whether such a\npresumption is proper in mine-run diversity cases. It\nsuffices to point out that no antiremoval presumption\nattends cases invoking CAFA, which Congress enacted to\nfacilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal\ncourt. See Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U.

This case fits that bill.3\n   There are many signals that the Tenth Circuit relied on\nthe legally erroneous premise that the District Court\u2019s\ndecision was correct. In an earlier case, the Tenth Circuit,\nfollowing the First Circuit\u2019s lead, stated considerations\nthat it regards as relevant to the intelligent exercise of\ndiscretion under \u00a71453(c)(1). BP America, Inc. v. Okla-\nhoma ex rel. Edmondson, 613 F. 3d 1029, 1034\u20131035 (2010)\n(adopting factors set out in College of Dental Surgeons of\nPuerto Rico v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins.

Or, as phrased by the\nTenth Circuit, if a district court\u2019s remand order remains\nundisturbed, will the case \u201cleave the ambit of the federal\ncourts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the\ndefendant] to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [un-\nder CAFA] . . . to have a federal tribunal adjudicate the\nmerits.\u201d BP America, 613 F. 3d, at 1035.

Post, at 6. But Public\nCitizen teed up that issue after the parties filed their merits briefs. In\nview of this Court\u2019s decision in Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U. S. ___,\nsee supra, at 7\u20138, the parties had no cause to address the matter\nearlier.\n  4 Neither court stated the listed considerations as an inflexible test.\n\nWe have no occasion in this case to review each of the factors identified\nby the First and Tenth Circuits.\n10        DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s own guide weighed heavily in favor of\naccepting Dart\u2019s appeal. That the Court of Appeals, in-\nstead, rejected Dart\u2019s appeal strongly suggests that the\npanel thought the District Court got it right in requiring\nproof of the amount in controversy in the removal notice.\n   In practical effect, the Court of Appeals\u2019 denial of review\nestablished the law not simply for this case, but for future\nCAFA removals sought by defendants in the Tenth Cir-\ncuit. The likelihood is slim that a later case will arise in\nwhich the Tenth Circuit will face a plea to retract the rule\nthat both Owens and the District Court ascribed to deci-\nsions of the Court of Appeals: Defendants seeking to re-\nmove under CAFA must be sent back to state court unless\nthey submit with the notice of removal evidence proving\nthe alleged amount in controversy. See supra, at 3. On\nthis point, Judge Hartz\u2019s observation, dissenting from the\nTenth Circuit\u2019s denial of rehearing en banc, see supra, at\n4, bears recounting in full:\n     \u201cAfter today\u2019s decision any diligent attorney (and one\n     can assume that an attorney representing a defendant\n     in a case involving at least $5 million\u2014the threshold\n     for removal under CAFA\u2014would have substantial in-\n     centive to be diligent) would submit to the evidentiary\n     burden rather than take a chance on remand to state\n     court.\u201d 730 F. 3d, at 1235.\nWith no responsible attorney likely to renew the fray,\nJudge Hartz anticipated, \u201cthe issue will not arise again.\u201d\nIbid. Consequently, the law applied by the District\nCourt\u2014demanding that the notice of removal contain\nevidence documenting the amount in controversy\u2014will be\nfrozen in place for all venues within the Tenth Circuit.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The  dissent suggests that the Tenth Circuit may have another op-\nportunity to set Circuit precedent straight: A lawyer may be irresponsi-\nble or fail to learn from Dart\u2019s experience; or perhaps a lawyer will put\nin evidence the district court deems insufficient, and then have a go at\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Recall that the Court of Appeals denied Dart\u2019s petition\nfor review \u201c[u]pon careful consideration of the parties\u2019\nsubmissions, as well as the applicable law.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 13a. What did the parties submit to the Tenth\nCircuit? Their presentations urged conflicting views on\nwhether a removing defendant must tender prima facie\nproof of the amount in controversy as part of the removal\nnotice. And what was \u201cthe applicable law\u201d other than the\nrule recited by the Tenth Circuit in Laughlin and follow-on\ndecisions, i.e., to remove successfully, a defendant must\npresent with the notice of removal evidence proving the\namount in controversy.6\n  From all signals one can discern then, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s denial of Dart\u2019s request for review of the remand\norder was infected by legal error. The District Court erred\nin ruling that Dart\u2019s amount-in-controversy allegation\nfailed for want of proof, but that error was driven by the\nDistrict Court\u2019s conscientious endeavor to follow Circuit\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\narguing that the evidence was sufficient and, in any event, \u201cno evidence\nis required at all.\u201d Post, at 5\u20136. That such a case will occur, and that\nthe Tenth Circuit would then seize the very opportunity it passed up in\nDart\u2019s case, is hardly probable.\n   6 The dissent posits that \u201cthe applicable law\u201d might have been some-\n\nthing other than the law governing the parties\u2019 submissions. Post, at 3,\n4. That is a strained reading of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s expression. Per-\nhaps the Tenth Circuit found this case a \u201cpoor vehicle,\u201d the dissent\nsuggests, post, at 2, but no potential vehicle concerns were urged by\nOwens, and the dissent identifies none. Or the Tenth Circuit might\nhave doubted its \u201cability to quickly resolve the issue\u201d within the 60-day\ntime limit provided in \u00a71453(c)(2)\u2013(3). Ibid.; see also post, at 4. Section\n1453(c)\u2019s timing provision, however, was designed to promote expedi-\ntion, not to discourage Courts of Appeals from acting on petitions for\nappeal. As a third \u201cmaybe,\u201d the dissent observes that proof of the\namount in controversy in removal notices is not \u201ca question unique to\n[CAFA].\u201d Post, at 3. True, the Tenth Circuit demands such proof in\nordinary diversity cases. See Laughlin v. Kmart Corp., 50 F. 3d 871,\n873 (1995). But that does not make the imposition one whit less in\nCAFA cases.\n12    DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprecedent. The parties trained their arguments in the\nTenth Circuit, as they did here, on the question whether\nDart could successfully remove without detailing in the\nremoval notice evidence of the amount in controversy. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 47 (acknowledgment by Owens\u2019 counsel\nthat \u201cthe issues . . . provided to . . . the Tenth Circuit were\nvery similar to what you see in this Court, with the excep-\ntion of [the question raised by Public Citizen] whether this\nCourt has jurisdiction\u201d). Dissenting from the denial of\nrehearing en banc, Judge Hartz explained at length why\nthe Tenth Circuit \u201cowe[d] a duty to the bench and bar\u201d to\ncorrect the District Court\u2019s misperception and to state as\nthe Circuit\u2019s law: \u201c[A] defendant seeking removal under\nCAFA need only allege the jurisdictional amount in its\nnotice of removal and must prove that amount only if the\nplaintiff challenges the allegation.\u201d 730 F. 3d, at 1234,\n1238. In this regard, we note, the Tenth Circuit has cau-\ntioned against casual rulings on applications like Dart\u2019s.\n\u201cThe decision whether to grant leave to appeal\u201d under\n\u00a71453(c), the Tenth Circuit stressed, calls for the exercise\nof the reviewing court\u2019s correctly \u201cinformed discretion.\u201d\nBP America, 613 F. 3d, at 1035 (emphasis added); see\nsupra, at 8\u20139.\n   Recall, moreover, that Owens never suggested in his\nwritten submissions to this Court that anything other\nthan the question presented accounts for the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 disposition. If Owens believed that the Tenth\nCircuit\u2019s denial of leave to appeal rested on some other\nground, he might have said so in his brief in opposition or,\nat least, in his merits brief. See this Court\u2019s Rule 15.2;\nGranite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S. 287, 306 (2010).\nHe said nothing of that order, for he, like Dart, antici-\npated that the question presented was ripe for this Court\u2019s\nresolution.\n   In the above-described circumstances, we find it an\nabuse of discretion for the Tenth Circuit to deny Dart\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

Doing so froze the governing rule in\nthe Circuit for this case and future CAFA removal notices,\nwith no opportunity for defendants in Dart\u2019s position\nresponsibly to resist making the evidentiary submission.\nThat situation would be bizarre for a decisionmaker who\ndid not think that the amount in controversy in diversity\ncases is a matter a removal notice must demonstrate by\nevidence, not merely credibly allege.7 And if the Circuit\nprecedent on which the District Court relied misstated the\nlaw, as we hold it did, then the District Court\u2019s order\nremanding this case to the state court is fatally infected by\nlegal error.\n  Careful inspection thus reveals that the two issues\nPublic Citizen invites us to separate\u2014whether the Tenth\nCircuit abused its discretion in denying review, and\nwhether the District Court\u2019s remand order was errone-\nous\u2014do not pose genuinely discrete questions. Instead,\nresolution of both issues depends on the answer to the\nvery same question: What must the removal notice con-\ntain? If the notice need not contain evidence, the Tenth\nCircuit abused its discretion in effectively making the\nopposing view the law of the Circuit. By the same token,\nthe District Court erred in remanding the case for want of\nan evidentiary submission in the removal notice. We no\ndoubt have authority to review for abuse of discretion the\nTenth Circuit\u2019s denial of Dart\u2019s appeal from the District\nCourt\u2019s remand order, see supra, at 8, and in doing so, to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Caution is in order when attributing a basis to an unreasoned deci-\n\nsion.

OWENS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntices of removal must contain evidence supporting federal\njurisdiction. After briefing we discovered a little snag:\nThis case does not present that question. Because we are\nreviewing the Tenth Circuit\u2019s judgment, the only question\nbefore us is whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discre-\ntion in denying Dart permission to appeal the District\nCourt\u2019s remand order. Once we found out that the issue\npresented differed from the issue we granted certiorari to\nreview, the responsible course would have been to confess\nerror and to dismiss the case as improvidently granted.\n   The Court, however, insists on deciding whether the\nDistrict Court erred in remanding this case to state court.\nHow can it do that, one might ask, when the only issue in\nthis case concerns the propriety of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s\nrejection of Dart\u2019s appeal? The Court hits upon a solution:\nIt concludes that the Tenth Circuit decided not to hear the\nappeal because it agreed with the District Court\u2019s analysis.\nAttributing the District Court\u2019s reasoning to the Tenth\nCircuit allows the Court to pretend to review the appellate\ncourt\u2019s exercise of discretion while actually reviewing the\ntrial court\u2019s legal analysis.\n   There are problems with this approach that are, in a\nrational world, insuperable. To begin with, the Tenth\nCircuit\u2019s short order does not tell us why it decided not to\nhear Dart\u2019s appeal. It might have done so for an imper-\nmissible reason\u2014for example, agreement with the District\nCourt\u2019s legal reasoning. But it might instead have done so\nfor countless other, permissible, reasons\u2014for example, a\nconcern that this would be a poor vehicle for deciding the\nissue presented by Dart\u2019s appeal, or a concern regarding\nthe court\u2019s ability to quickly resolve the issue, see\n\u00a71453(c)(2)\u2013(3) (providing that appeals accepted under\n\u00a71453(c)(1) must be decided within 60 days, absent con-\nsent of the parties, with a 10-day extension for \u201cgood cause\nshown and in the interests of justice\u201d).\n   Not long ago we held, unanimously, that \u201c[a]n appellate\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Mendelsohn, 552 U. S. 379, 386 (2008).\nThere, we corrected the Tenth Circuit for doing precisely\nwhat the Court itself does today in reviewing (deferen-\ntially) the Tenth Circuit\u2019s denial of permission to appeal:\npresuming that the lower court adopted a legally errone-\nous argument advanced by one party. Id., at 384\u2013385. We\nexplained to the Tenth Circuit that \u201cit would be inappro-\npriate for the reviewing court to assume, absent indication\nin the District Court\u2019s opinion, that the lower court adopted\na party\u2019s incorrect argument.\u201d Id., at 385, n. 2 (empha-\nsis added). Today, however, this Court blatantly violates\nthat rule.\n   The only \u201cindication in the opinion\u201d that the Court relies\non is the following language from the order denying per-\nmission to appeal: \u201cUpon careful consideration of [1] the\nparties\u2019 submissions, as well as [2] the applicable law, the\nPetition [for permission to appeal the remand order] is\ndenied.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a\u201314a. This, the Court\ntells us, means the Tenth Circuit must have denied Dart\u2019s\npetition because it agreed with the District Court\u2019s legal\nconclusion. Of course it means no such thing.\n   As for point [1], considering a submission is not the\nsame thing as agreeing with that submission. Worse still,\ncorrectness of the District Court\u2019s opinion was not the only\nground that Owens\u2019 brief in the Tenth Circuit urged to\nsupport denial of the petition for review. It noted, for\nexample, that the case addressed the general removal\nstatute, \u00a71446(a), and so did not involve a question unique\nto the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA).

(The Tenth Circuit considers \u201cthe presence of an\nimportant CAFA-related question\u201d a reason to accept an\n4     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nappeal. BP America, Inc. v. Oklahoma ex rel. Edmonson,\n613 F. 3d 1029, 1034 (2010) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).)\n   As for point [2], there is no reason whatever to believe\nthat the only \u201capplicable law\u201d the Tenth Circuit considered\nand relied on was the law relating to the correctness of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision\u2014i.e., the law interpreting\n\u00a71446(a). After all, the \u201capplicable law\u201d surely includes\nthe law applicable to the disposition of petitions to appeal,\n\u00a71453(c)(1), and that body of law includes countless rea-\nsons to deny permission to appeal that are unrelated to\nthe merits of the underlying district court judgment.\n\u201cApplicable law\u201d would allow the Tenth Circuit, for exam-\nple, to deny permission to appeal for reasons not men-\ntioned in the parties\u2019 briefing. It would allow it to deny\npermission because it would be unable to resolve the issue\nwithin 60 days, as required by CAFA (absent an exten-\nsion). \u00a71453(c)(2) and (c)(3); see also 730 F. 3d 1234, 1238\n(Hartz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (\u201cIt\nwill always be tempting for very busy judges to deny\nreview of a knotty matter that requires a decision in short\norder\u201d). And \u201capplicable law\u201d would permit numerous\nother grounds for denial, including those applied by this\nCourt in denying petitions for certiorari. There is, to tell\nthe truth, absolutely nothing in the Tenth Circuit\u2019s order\nto suggest that it relied on the unlawful ground that the\nCourt eagerly attributes to it, rather than one of many\npossible lawful grounds. Thus, as we said in Mendelsohn,\n\u201cit would be inappropriate for the reviewing court [us] to\nassume . . . that the lower court adopted a party\u2019s incorrect\nargument.\u201d 552 U. S., at 385, n. 2.\n   Besides relying on the utterly uninformative language of\nthe order, the Court makes one other attempt to demon-\nstrate that the Tenth Circuit\u2019s order was based upon its\nagreement with the holding of the District Court. It as-\nserts that denying Dart permission to appeal \u201cfroz[e] in\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

In light of\nthat denial, the Court says, any \u201cresponsible attorney\u201d will\ninclude evidence supporting jurisdiction in his notice of\nremoval, thereby eliminating the risk of having that notice\nheld improper for the reason given by the District Court in\nthis case. As a result, the Tenth Circuit will likely never\nagain be presented with the question whether evidence of\njurisdiction must be included with a notice of removal.\nIbid. The Court then notes that, among the many factors\nthe Tenth Circuit considers in deciding whether to accept\nan appeal under \u00a71453(c)(1), is whether the case presents\nan issue which, if not resolved in that appeal, will \u201cleave\nthe ambit of the federal courts for good.\u201d BP America,\nsupra, at 1035. One would have thought that this factor,\nif it controlled the Tenth Circuit\u2019s denial, means that the\nTenth Circuit did not agree with the Court\u2019s perception\nthat this issue will not likely reappear. The Court, how-\never, says (quite illogically) that it means the Tenth\nCircuit must have agreed with the District Court\u2019s incorrect\nlegal analysis. It is hard to imagine a more obvious non\nsequitur.\n   And the argument not only tortures logic, it also distorts\nreality, resting as it does on the premise that henceforth\nno \u201cresponsible attorney\u201d will fail to include evidence\nsupporting federal jurisdiction in a notice of removal.\nEven discounting the existence of irresponsible attorneys,\nbut see, e.g., Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___ (2012),\nresponsible attorneys, and even responsible judges, some-\ntimes make mistakes, see, e.g., 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (order\ngranting certiorari in this case). Indeed, Dart\u2019s own\n(seemingly responsible) lawyers failed to include evidence\nsupporting federal jurisdiction, despite what they argue is\nCircuit precedent supporting the District Court\u2019s holding.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 12 (counsel for Dart, explaining that\nthe District Court\u2019s ruling was supported by Tenth Circuit\nprecedent).\n6     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Even in the legal utopia imagined by the Court\u2014a world\nin which all lawyers are responsible and no lawyers make\nmistakes\u2014it is easy to imagine ways in which the issue\ncould come back to the circuit court. If, for example, a\nparty appealed a district court decision addressing the\nsufficiency of the jurisdictional evidence, the Tenth Circuit\ncould accept the appeal and hold (en banc, if necessary)\nthat no evidence is required at all. In short, it is impos-\nsible to credit the suggestion (irrelevant in any case) that\nthe chances of this issue arising again were \u201cslim.\u201d Ante,\nat 10.\n   The Court attempts to bolster its conclusion with an\nunprincipled and unequal application of the waiver doc-\ntrine. Owens, it says, by failing to brief the argument that\nthe Tenth Circuit denied Dart\u2019s petition for reasons other\nthan its agreement with the District Court\u2019s decision,\nwaived that argument. Ante, at 12 (citing this Court\u2019s\nRule 15.2). Dart, however, never made an argument that\nwould have called for such a response. It never argued\nthat the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying\npermission to appeal. Aside from one stray assertion on\nthe final page of its reply brief, its briefing focused entirely\non whether the District Court erred in remanding the case\nto state court. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners 9 (\u201cThis\nCourt should reverse the district court\u2019s order remanding\nthe case to state court\u201d). Rather than hold Dart responsi-\nble for failing to argue that the Tenth Circuit abused its\ndiscretion, see Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital,\nLtd., 573 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2014) (slip op., at 5, n. 2) (\u201cWe\nwill not revive a forfeited argument simply because the\npetitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief \u201d), the\nCourt makes the argument on Dart\u2019s behalf and then\ntakes Owens to task for failing to refute it. This Court ought\nnot embrace such an oddhanded application of waiver\nprinciples.\n   The Court answers that Dart \u201chad no cause to address\u201d\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwhether the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion until the\nissue was raised in Public Citizen\u2019s amicus brief. Ante, at\n9, n. 3. Not good enough. First, parties always have\n\u201ccause to address\u201d issues on which their entitlement to\nrelief depends. Second, and more important, Public Citi-\nzen filed its amicus brief after both sides had already filed\ntheir merits briefs. So if the timing of that brief excuses\nDart\u2019s failure to address whether the Tenth Circuit abused\nits discretion, it should excuse Owens\u2019 failure as well.\n   I come, finally, to the Court\u2019s stinging observation that I\njoined the majority opinion in Standard Fire Ins. Co. v.\nKnowles, 568 U. S. ___ (2013)\u2014a case that arose in the\nsame posture as this one, but that was resolved without\nreference to the question whether the appellate court\nabused its discretion. Ante, at 8, n. 2. Of course Knowles\ndid not address whether denials of permission to appeal\nunder \u00a71453(c)(1) are to be reviewed for abuse of discre-\ntion\u2014which is why today\u2019s majority cannot cite it as prec-\nedent. See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 630\u2013631\n(1993). As for my own culpability in overlooking the issue,\nI must accept that and will take it with me to the grave.\nBut its irrelevance to my vote in the present case has been\nwell expressed by Justice Jackson, in a passage quoted by\nthe author of today\u2019s opinion: \u201cI see no reason why I\nshould be consciously wrong today because I was uncon-\nsciously wrong yesterday.\u201d         Massachusetts v.

S. C. \u00a71254. Purporting to act pursuant to this grant of\njurisdiction, the majority today reviews the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals to deny an application for permission to\nappeal a remand order. But such an application is not a\ncase: It \u201c \u2018does not assert a grievance against anyone, does\nnot seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does\nnot even require a \u201cparty\u201d on the other side.\u2019 \u201d Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 355 (2003) (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning) (quoting Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 256\n(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).\n   To justify its action here, the majority quietly extends\nan opinion of this Court holding that applications for\ncertificates of appealability (COAs) in the federal habeas\ncontext are \u201ccases.\u201d Hohn, supra. Hohn was wrongly\ndecided, and the majority\u2019s uncritical extension of its\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nholding only compounds the error. Hohn rests tenuously\non the conclusion that the determination that must be\nmade on an application for a COA is more like a threshold\ndetermination than a separate judicial proceeding. See\nid., at 246\u2013248. The basis for that conclusion, if any ex-\nists, must rest on features unique to the COA: \u201cThe COA\ndetermination . . . requires an overview of the claims in the\nhabeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d\nMiller-El, supra, at 336 (emphasis added). The best ar-\ngument one could make in favor of Hohn is that, because a\ncourt\u2019s decision on an application for a COA turns on the\nstrength of the applicant\u2019s grievance and his entitlement\nto relief, the application absorbs the case-like qualities of\nthe underlying merits case. See Hohn, supra, at 248.\n   No such osmosis could transform an application for\npermission to appeal a remand order into a \u201ccase.\u201d As\nJUSTICE SCALIA explains, the decision whether to permit\nsuch an appeal requires no assessment of the merits of a\nremand order. See ante, at 2 (dissenting opinion). The\napplication here is nothing more than a request for discre-\ntionary permission to seek review. See Miller-El, supra, at\n355 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The Tenth Circuit having\ndenied that permission, no \u201ccase\u201d ever arrived \u201cin the\ncourt of appeals.\u201d I would dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n",

Argued October 7, 2014\u2014Decided December 15, 2014\nA defendant seeking to remove a case from state to federal court must\n  file in the federal forum a notice of removal \u201ccontaining a short and\n  plain statement of the grounds for removal.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71446(a).\n     Respondent Owens filed a putative class action in Kansas state\n  court, seeking compensation for damages class members allegedly\n  sustained when petitioners (collectively, Dart) underpaid royalties\n  due under certain oil and gas leases. Dart removed the case to the\n  Federal District Court, invoking the Class Action Fairness Act of\n  2005 (CAFA), which gives federal courts jurisdiction over class ac-\n  tions if the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, 28 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71332(d)(2). Dart\u2019s notice of removal alleged that the purported un-\n  derpayments totaled over $8.2 million. Owens moved to remand the\n  case to state court, asserting that the removal notice was \u201cdeficient\n  as a matter of law\u201d because it included \u201cno evidence\u201d proving that the\n  amount in controversy exceeded $5 million. In response, Dart sub-\n  mitted an executive\u2019s detailed declaration supporting an amount in\n  controversy in excess of $11 million. The District Court granted Ow-\n  ens\u2019 remand motion, reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof\n  of the amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself. Dart pe-\n  titioned the Tenth Circuit for permission to appeal, see \u00a71453(c)(1),\n  but that court denied review and rehearing en banc.\nHeld:\n    1. As specified in \u00a71446(a), a defendant\u2019s notice of removal need in-\n clude only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy ex-\n ceeds the jurisdictional threshold; the notice need not contain eviden-\n tiary submissions.\n    Section 1446(a) tracks the general pleading requirement stated in\n2        DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. By borrowing Rule\n    8(a)\u2019s \u201cshort and plain statement\u201d standard, corroborative history in-\n    dicates, Congress intended to clarify that courts should \u201capply the\n    same liberal rules [to removal allegations as] to other matters of\n    pleading.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 100\u2013889, p. 71. The amount-in-controversy\n    allegation of a plaintiff invoking federal-court jurisdiction is accepted\n    if made in good faith. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,\n    429 U. S. 274, 276. Similarly, the amount-in-controversy allegation\n    of a defendant seeking federal-court adjudication should be accepted\n    when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court. In the\n    event that the plaintiff does contest the defendant\u2019s allegations, both\n    sides submit proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the\n    evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been\n    satisfied, see \u00a71446(c)(2)(B).\n       In remanding the case to state court, the District Court relied, in\n    part, on a purported \u201cpresumption\u201d against removal, but no antire-\n    moval presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, a statute Congress\n    enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal\n    court. See Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S. ___, ___.\n    Pp. 4\u20137.\n       2. The District Court erred in remanding this case for want of an\n    evidentiary submission in the notice of removal, and the Tenth Cir-\n    cuit abused its discretion in denying review of that decision. Pp. 7\u2013\n    14.\n          (a) This Court concludes that no jurisdictional barrier impedes\n    settlement of the question presented: whether evidence supporting\n    the amount in controversy must be included in a notice of removal.\n    The case was \u201cin\u201d the Tenth Circuit because of Dart\u2019s application for\n    leave to appeal, and the Court has jurisdiction to review what the\n    Court of Appeals did with that application. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71254;\n    Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 248. Pp. 7\u20138.\n          (b) While appellate review of a remand order is discretionary, ex-\n    ercise of that discretion is not rudderless, see Highmark Inc. v. All-\n    care Health Management System, Inc., 572 U. S. ___, ___, and a court\n    \u201cwould necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an er-\n    roneous view of the law,\u201d Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n    384, 405. The Tenth Circuit had previously stated considerations\n    bearing on the intelligent exercise of discretion under \u00a71453(c)(1).\n    One of those considerations is particularly relevant here: a court of\n    appeals should inquire whether, if a district court\u2019s remand order\n    remains undisturbed, the case will \u201cleave the ambit of the federal\n    courts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the defendant]\n    to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [under CAFA] . . . to have a\n    federal tribunal adjudicate the merits.\u201d BP America, Inc. v.

Thus the Tenth Cir-\n  cuit\u2019s own guide weighed heavily in favor of accepting Dart\u2019s appeal.\n  In practical effect, the Court of Appeals\u2019 denial of review established\n  the law\u2014the requirement of proof of the amount in controversy in the\n  removal notice\u2014not simply for this case, but for future CAFA remov-\n  als sought by defendants in the Tenth Circuit, leaving those defend-\n  ants with no realistic opportunity to resist making the evidentiary\n  submission.\n     The District Court, driven by its conscientious endeavor to follow\n  Circuit precedent, erred in ruling that Dart\u2019s amount-in-controversy\n  allegation failed for want of proof. It was an abuse of discretion for\n  the Tenth Circuit to deny Dart\u2019s request for review, for that disposi-\n  tion fastened on district courts within the Circuit an erroneous view\n  of the law. Contrary to the law the District Court derived from Tenth\n  Circuit precedent, a removal notice need only plausibly allege, not de-\n  tail proof of, the amount in controversy.Pp. 8\u201314.\nVacated and remanded.\n\n   GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

S. C. \u00a71446(a). When re-\nmoval is based on diversity of citizenship, an amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement must be met. Ordinarily, \u201cthe\nmatter in controversy [must] excee[d] the sum or value of\n$75,000.\u201d \u00a71332(a). In class actions for which the re-\nquirement of diversity of citizenship is relaxed, \u00a71332(d)\n(2)(A)\u2013(C), \u201cthe matter in controversy [must] excee[d]\nthe sum or value of $5,000,000,\u201d \u00a71332(d)(2). If the\nplaintiff \u2019s complaint, filed in state court, demands mon-\netary relief of a stated sum, that sum, if asserted in\ngood faith, is \u201cdeemed to be the amount in controversy.\u201d\n\u00a71446(c)(2). When the plaintiff \u2019s complaint does not state\nthe amount in controversy, the defendant\u2019s notice of re-\nmoval may do so. \u00a71446(c)(2)(A).\n  To assert the amount in controversy adequately in the\nremoval notice, does it suffice to allege the requisite\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v.

The complaint\nsought \u201ca fair and reasonable amount\u201d to compensate\nputative class members for \u201cdamages\u201d they sustained due\nto the alleged underpayments. App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a,\n35a.\n   Invoking federal jurisdiction under the Class Action\nFairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), Dart removed the case to the\nU. S. District Court for the District of Kansas. CAFA\ngives federal courts jurisdiction over certain class actions,\ndefined in \u00a71332(d)(1), if the class has more than 100\nmembers, the parties are minimally diverse, and the\namount in controversy exceeds $5 million. \u00a71332(d)(2),\n(5)(B); see Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3). Dart\u2019s notice of removal\nalleged that all three requirements were satisfied. With\nrespect to the amount in controversy, Dart stated that the\npurported underpayments to putative class members\ntotaled more than $8.2 million.\n   Owens moved to remand the case to state court. The\nnotice of removal was \u201cdeficient as a matter of law,\u201d\nOwens asserted, because it included \u201cno evidence\u201d proving\nthat the amount in controversy exceeded $5 million.

In response, Dart submitted a\ndeclaration by one of its executive officers. The declara-\ntion included a detailed damages calculation indicating\nthat the amount in controversy, sans interest, exceeded\n$11 million.     Without challenging Dart\u2019s calculation,\nOwens urged that Dart\u2019s amount-in-controversy submission\ncame too late. \u201c[The] legally deficient [notice of removal],\u201d\nOwens maintained, could not be cured by \u201cpost-removal\nevidence about the amount in controversy.\u201d Id., at 100a.\n   Reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof of\nthe amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself,\nthe District Court granted Owens\u2019 remand motion. Dart\u2019s\ndeclaration, the District Court held, could not serve to\nkeep the case in federal court.

Similarly, when a defendant seeks federal-court\nadjudication, the defendant\u2019s amount-in-controversy alle-\ngation should be accepted when not contested by the\nplaintiff or questioned by the court. Indeed, the Tenth\nCircuit, although not disturbing prior decisions demand-\ning proof together with the removal notice, recognized that\nit was anomalous to treat commencing plaintiffs and\nremoving defendants differently with regard to the\namount in controversy.

This case fits that bill.3\n   There are many signals that the Tenth Circuit relied on\nthe legally erroneous premise that the District Court\u2019s\ndecision was correct. In an earlier case, the Tenth Circuit,\nfollowing the First Circuit\u2019s lead, stated considerations\nthat it regards as relevant to the intelligent exercise of\ndiscretion under \u00a71453(c)(1).

OWENS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s own guide weighed heavily in favor of\naccepting Dart\u2019s appeal. That the Court of Appeals, in-\nstead, rejected Dart\u2019s appeal strongly suggests that the\npanel thought the District Court got it right in requiring\nproof of the amount in controversy in the removal notice.\n   In practical effect, the Court of Appeals\u2019 denial of review\nestablished the law not simply for this case, but for future\nCAFA removals sought by defendants in the Tenth Cir-\ncuit. The likelihood is slim that a later case will arise in\nwhich the Tenth Circuit will face a plea to retract the rule\nthat both Owens and the District Court ascribed to deci-\nsions of the Court of Appeals: Defendants seeking to re-\nmove under CAFA must be sent back to state court unless\nthey submit with the notice of removal evidence proving\nthe alleged amount in controversy. See supra, at 3. On\nthis point, Judge Hartz\u2019s observation, dissenting from the\nTenth Circuit\u2019s denial of rehearing en banc, see supra, at\n4, bears recounting in full:\n     \u201cAfter today\u2019s decision any diligent attorney (and one\n     can assume that an attorney representing a defendant\n     in a case involving at least $5 million\u2014the threshold\n     for removal under CAFA\u2014would have substantial in-\n     centive to be diligent) would submit to the evidentiary\n     burden rather than take a chance on remand to state\n     court.\u201d 730 F. 3d, at 1235.\nWith no responsible attorney likely to renew the fray,\nJudge Hartz anticipated, \u201cthe issue will not arise again.\u201d\nIbid. Consequently, the law applied by the District\nCourt\u2014demanding that the notice of removal contain\nevidence documenting the amount in controversy\u2014will be\nfrozen in place for all venues within the Tenth Circuit.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The  dissent suggests that the Tenth Circuit may have another op-\nportunity to set Circuit precedent straight: A lawyer may be irresponsi-\nble or fail to learn from Dart\u2019s experience; or perhaps a lawyer will put\nin evidence the district court deems insufficient, and then have a go at\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

What did the parties submit to the Tenth\nCircuit? Their presentations urged conflicting views on\nwhether a removing defendant must tender prima facie\nproof of the amount in controversy as part of the removal\nnotice. And what was \u201cthe applicable law\u201d other than the\nrule recited by the Tenth Circuit in Laughlin and follow-on\ndecisions, i.e., to remove successfully, a defendant must\npresent with the notice of removal evidence proving the\namount in controversy.6\n  From all signals one can discern then, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s denial of Dart\u2019s request for review of the remand\norder was infected by legal error. The District Court erred\nin ruling that Dart\u2019s amount-in-controversy allegation\nfailed for want of proof, but that error was driven by the\nDistrict Court\u2019s conscientious endeavor to follow Circuit\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\narguing that the evidence was sufficient and, in any event, \u201cno evidence\nis required at all.\u201d Post, at 5\u20136.

Post, at 3,\n4. That is a strained reading of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s expression. Per-\nhaps the Tenth Circuit found this case a \u201cpoor vehicle,\u201d the dissent\nsuggests, post, at 2, but no potential vehicle concerns were urged by\nOwens, and the dissent identifies none. Or the Tenth Circuit might\nhave doubted its \u201cability to quickly resolve the issue\u201d within the 60-day\ntime limit provided in \u00a71453(c)(2)\u2013(3). Ibid.; see also post, at 4. Section\n1453(c)\u2019s timing provision, however, was designed to promote expedi-\ntion, not to discourage Courts of Appeals from acting on petitions for\nappeal.

True, the Tenth Circuit demands such proof in\nordinary diversity cases. See Laughlin v. Kmart Corp., 50 F. 3d 871,\n873 (1995).

Dissenting from the denial of\nrehearing en banc, Judge Hartz explained at length why\nthe Tenth Circuit \u201cowe[d] a duty to the bench and bar\u201d to\ncorrect the District Court\u2019s misperception and to state as\nthe Circuit\u2019s law: \u201c[A] defendant seeking removal under\nCAFA need only allege the jurisdictional amount in its\nnotice of removal and must prove that amount only if the\nplaintiff challenges the allegation.\u201d 730 F. 3d, at 1234,\n1238. In this regard, we note, the Tenth Circuit has cau-\ntioned against casual rulings on applications like Dart\u2019s.\n\u201cThe decision whether to grant leave to appeal\u201d under\n\u00a71453(c), the Tenth Circuit stressed, calls for the exercise\nof the reviewing court\u2019s correctly \u201cinformed discretion.\u201d\nBP America, 613 F. 3d, at 1035 (emphasis added); see\nsupra, at 8\u20139.\n   Recall, moreover, that Owens never suggested in his\nwritten submissions to this Court that anything other\nthan the question presented accounts for the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 disposition. If Owens believed that the Tenth\nCircuit\u2019s denial of leave to appeal rested on some other\nground, he might have said so in his brief in opposition or,\nat least, in his merits brief. See this Court\u2019s Rule 15.2;\nGranite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S. 287, 306 (2010).\nHe said nothing of that order, for he, like Dart, antici-\npated that the question presented was ripe for this Court\u2019s\nresolution.\n   In the above-described circumstances, we find it an\nabuse of discretion for the Tenth Circuit to deny Dart\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

Doing so froze the governing rule in\nthe Circuit for this case and future CAFA removal notices,\nwith no opportunity for defendants in Dart\u2019s position\nresponsibly to resist making the evidentiary submission.\nThat situation would be bizarre for a decisionmaker who\ndid not think that the amount in controversy in diversity\ncases is a matter a removal notice must demonstrate by\nevidence, not merely credibly allege.7 And if the Circuit\nprecedent on which the District Court relied misstated the\nlaw, as we hold it did, then the District Court\u2019s order\nremanding this case to the state court is fatally infected by\nlegal error.\n  Careful inspection thus reveals that the two issues\nPublic Citizen invites us to separate\u2014whether the Tenth\nCircuit abused its discretion in denying review, and\nwhether the District Court\u2019s remand order was errone-\nous\u2014do not pose genuinely discrete questions. Instead,\nresolution of both issues depends on the answer to the\nvery same question: What must the removal notice con-\ntain? If the notice need not contain evidence, the Tenth\nCircuit abused its discretion in effectively making the\nopposing view the law of the Circuit. By the same token,\nthe District Court erred in remanding the case for want of\nan evidentiary submission in the removal notice. We no\ndoubt have authority to review for abuse of discretion the\nTenth Circuit\u2019s denial of Dart\u2019s appeal from the District\nCourt\u2019s remand order, see supra, at 8, and in doing so, to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Caution is in order when attributing a basis to an unreasoned deci-\n\nsion. But we have not insisted upon absolute certainty when that basis\nis fairly inferred from the record. See Taylor v. McKeithen, 407 U. S.\n191, 193, n. 2 (1972) (per curiam) (rejecting \u201cpossible, but unlikely\u201d\nbasis for unreasoned decision); Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 742\u2013\n743 (1982) (facing an unreasoned Court of Appeals decision, we projected\nwhat the Court of Appeals \u201cappears to have\u201d reasoned); Tr. of Oral\nArg. 18\u201319 (observing that an appellate court often assumes that a first\ninstance court based its unexplained discretionary decision on the\nground the prevailing party presented).\n14     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v.

OWENS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                     [December 15, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY and\nJUSTICE KAGAN join, and with whom JUSTICE THOMAS\njoins as to all but the final sentence, dissenting.\n   When Dart removed this class action to federal court, it\nwas required to file a \u201cnotice of removal\u201d containing \u201ca\nshort and plain statement of the grounds for removal.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71446(a). In accordance with what it thought to\nbe Tenth Circuit jurisprudence, the District Court inter-\npreted this to require evidence (as opposed to mere allega-\ntions) supporting federal jurisdiction. After finding that\nDart\u2019s notice of removal did not include evidence of the\njurisdictionally required amount in controversy, the Dis-\ntrict Court remanded the case to state court. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 25a\u201328a. Dart sought permission to appeal this\norder under \u00a71453(c)(1), which provides that \u201ca court of\nappeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\ncourt granting or denying a motion to remand a class\naction to the State court from which it was removed\u201d\n(emphasis added). Without stating its reasons, the Tenth\nCircuit issued an order denying Dart\u2019s request. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 13a.\n   Eager to correct what we suspected was the District\nCourt\u2019s (and the Tenth Circuit\u2019s) erroneous interpretation\nof \u00a71446(a), we granted certiorari to decide whether no-\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntices of removal must contain evidence supporting federal\njurisdiction. After briefing we discovered a little snag:\nThis case does not present that question. Because we are\nreviewing the Tenth Circuit\u2019s judgment, the only question\nbefore us is whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discre-\ntion in denying Dart permission to appeal the District\nCourt\u2019s remand order. Once we found out that the issue\npresented differed from the issue we granted certiorari to\nreview, the responsible course would have been to confess\nerror and to dismiss the case as improvidently granted.\n   The Court, however, insists on deciding whether the\nDistrict Court erred in remanding this case to state court.\nHow can it do that, one might ask, when the only issue in\nthis case concerns the propriety of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s\nrejection of Dart\u2019s appeal? The Court hits upon a solution:\nIt concludes that the Tenth Circuit decided not to hear the\nappeal because it agreed with the District Court\u2019s analysis.\nAttributing the District Court\u2019s reasoning to the Tenth\nCircuit allows the Court to pretend to review the appellate\ncourt\u2019s exercise of discretion while actually reviewing the\ntrial court\u2019s legal analysis.\n   There are problems with this approach that are, in a\nrational world, insuperable. To begin with, the Tenth\nCircuit\u2019s short order does not tell us why it decided not to\nhear Dart\u2019s appeal. It might have done so for an imper-\nmissible reason\u2014for example, agreement with the District\nCourt\u2019s legal reasoning. But it might instead have done so\nfor countless other, permissible, reasons\u2014for example, a\nconcern that this would be a poor vehicle for deciding the\nissue presented by Dart\u2019s appeal, or a concern regarding\nthe court\u2019s ability to quickly resolve the issue, see\n\u00a71453(c)(2)\u2013(3) (providing that appeals accepted under\n\u00a71453(c)(1) must be decided within 60 days, absent con-\nsent of the parties, with a 10-day extension for \u201cgood cause\nshown and in the interests of justice\u201d).\n   Not long ago we held, unanimously, that \u201c[a]n appellate\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncourt should not presume that a district court intended an\nincorrect legal result when the order is equally susceptible\nof a correct reading, particularly when the applicable\nstandard of review is deferential.\u201d Sprint/United Man-\nagement Co. v. Mendelsohn, 552 U. S. 379, 386 (2008).\nThere, we corrected the Tenth Circuit for doing precisely\nwhat the Court itself does today in reviewing (deferen-\ntially) the Tenth Circuit\u2019s denial of permission to appeal:\npresuming that the lower court adopted a legally errone-\nous argument advanced by one party. Id., at 384\u2013385. We\nexplained to the Tenth Circuit that \u201cit would be inappro-\npriate for the reviewing court to assume, absent indication\nin the District Court\u2019s opinion, that the lower court adopted\na party\u2019s incorrect argument.\u201d Id., at 385, n. 2 (empha-\nsis added). Today, however, this Court blatantly violates\nthat rule.\n   The only \u201cindication in the opinion\u201d that the Court relies\non is the following language from the order denying per-\nmission to appeal: \u201cUpon careful consideration of [1] the\nparties\u2019 submissions, as well as [2] the applicable law, the\nPetition [for permission to appeal the remand order] is\ndenied.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a\u201314a. This, the Court\ntells us, means the Tenth Circuit must have denied Dart\u2019s\npetition because it agreed with the District Court\u2019s legal\nconclusion. Of course it means no such thing.\n   As for point [1], considering a submission is not the\nsame thing as agreeing with that submission. Worse still,\ncorrectness of the District Court\u2019s opinion was not the only\nground that Owens\u2019 brief in the Tenth Circuit urged to\nsupport denial of the petition for review. It noted, for\nexample, that the case addressed the general removal\nstatute, \u00a71446(a), and so did not involve a question unique\nto the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA). Re-\nsponse to Petition for Permission to Appeal in No. 13\u2013603,\np. 3. (The Tenth Circuit considers \u201cthe presence of an\nimportant CAFA-related question\u201d a reason to accept an\n4     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nappeal. BP America, Inc. v. Oklahoma ex rel. Edmonson,\n613 F. 3d 1029, 1034 (2010) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).)\n   As for point [2], there is no reason whatever to believe\nthat the only \u201capplicable law\u201d the Tenth Circuit considered\nand relied on was the law relating to the correctness of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision\u2014i.e., the law interpreting\n\u00a71446(a). After all, the \u201capplicable law\u201d surely includes\nthe law applicable to the disposition of petitions to appeal,\n\u00a71453(c)(1), and that body of law includes countless rea-\nsons to deny permission to appeal that are unrelated to\nthe merits of the underlying district court judgment.\n\u201cApplicable law\u201d would allow the Tenth Circuit, for exam-\nple, to deny permission to appeal for reasons not men-\ntioned in the parties\u2019 briefing. It would allow it to deny\npermission because it would be unable to resolve the issue\nwithin 60 days, as required by CAFA (absent an exten-\nsion). \u00a71453(c)(2) and (c)(3); see also 730 F. 3d 1234, 1238\n(Hartz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (\u201cIt\nwill always be tempting for very busy judges to deny\nreview of a knotty matter that requires a decision in short\norder\u201d). And \u201capplicable law\u201d would permit numerous\nother grounds for denial, including those applied by this\nCourt in denying petitions for certiorari. There is, to tell\nthe truth, absolutely nothing in the Tenth Circuit\u2019s order\nto suggest that it relied on the unlawful ground that the\nCourt eagerly attributes to it, rather than one of many\npossible lawful grounds. Thus, as we said in Mendelsohn,\n\u201cit would be inappropriate for the reviewing court [us] to\nassume . . . that the lower court adopted a party\u2019s incorrect\nargument.\u201d 552 U. S., at 385, n. 2.\n   Besides relying on the utterly uninformative language of\nthe order, the Court makes one other attempt to demon-\nstrate that the Tenth Circuit\u2019s order was based upon its\nagreement with the holding of the District Court. It as-\nserts that denying Dart permission to appeal \u201cfroz[e] in\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

In light of\nthat denial, the Court says, any \u201cresponsible attorney\u201d will\ninclude evidence supporting jurisdiction in his notice of\nremoval, thereby eliminating the risk of having that notice\nheld improper for the reason given by the District Court in\nthis case. As a result, the Tenth Circuit will likely never\nagain be presented with the question whether evidence of\njurisdiction must be included with a notice of removal.\nIbid. The Court then notes that, among the many factors\nthe Tenth Circuit considers in deciding whether to accept\nan appeal under \u00a71453(c)(1), is whether the case presents\nan issue which, if not resolved in that appeal, will \u201cleave\nthe ambit of the federal courts for good.\u201d BP America,\nsupra, at 1035. One would have thought that this factor,\nif it controlled the Tenth Circuit\u2019s denial, means that the\nTenth Circuit did not agree with the Court\u2019s perception\nthat this issue will not likely reappear. The Court, how-\never, says (quite illogically) that it means the Tenth\nCircuit must have agreed with the District Court\u2019s incorrect\nlegal analysis. It is hard to imagine a more obvious non\nsequitur.\n   And the argument not only tortures logic, it also distorts\nreality, resting as it does on the premise that henceforth\nno \u201cresponsible attorney\u201d will fail to include evidence\nsupporting federal jurisdiction in a notice of removal.\nEven discounting the existence of irresponsible attorneys,\nbut see, e.g., Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___ (2012),\nresponsible attorneys, and even responsible judges, some-\ntimes make mistakes, see, e.g., 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (order\ngranting certiorari in this case). Indeed, Dart\u2019s own\n(seemingly responsible) lawyers failed to include evidence\nsupporting federal jurisdiction, despite what they argue is\nCircuit precedent supporting the District Court\u2019s holding.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 12 (counsel for Dart, explaining that\nthe District Court\u2019s ruling was supported by Tenth Circuit\nprecedent).\n6     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Even in the legal utopia imagined by the Court\u2014a world\nin which all lawyers are responsible and no lawyers make\nmistakes\u2014it is easy to imagine ways in which the issue\ncould come back to the circuit court. If, for example, a\nparty appealed a district court decision addressing the\nsufficiency of the jurisdictional evidence, the Tenth Circuit\ncould accept the appeal and hold (en banc, if necessary)\nthat no evidence is required at all. In short, it is impos-\nsible to credit the suggestion (irrelevant in any case) that\nthe chances of this issue arising again were \u201cslim.\u201d Ante,\nat 10.\n   The Court attempts to bolster its conclusion with an\nunprincipled and unequal application of the waiver doc-\ntrine. Owens, it says, by failing to brief the argument that\nthe Tenth Circuit denied Dart\u2019s petition for reasons other\nthan its agreement with the District Court\u2019s decision,\nwaived that argument. Ante, at 12 (citing this Court\u2019s\nRule 15.2). Dart, however, never made an argument that\nwould have called for such a response. It never argued\nthat the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying\npermission to appeal. Aside from one stray assertion on\nthe final page of its reply brief, its briefing focused entirely\non whether the District Court erred in remanding the case\nto state court. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners 9 (\u201cThis\nCourt should reverse the district court\u2019s order remanding\nthe case to state court\u201d). Rather than hold Dart responsi-\nble for failing to argue that the Tenth Circuit abused its\ndiscretion, see Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital,\nLtd., 573 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2014) (slip op., at 5, n. 2) (\u201cWe\nwill not revive a forfeited argument simply because the\npetitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief \u201d), the\nCourt makes the argument on Dart\u2019s behalf and then\ntakes Owens to task for failing to refute it. This Court ought\nnot embrace such an oddhanded application of waiver\nprinciples.\n   The Court answers that Dart \u201chad no cause to address\u201d\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwhether the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion until the\nissue was raised in Public Citizen\u2019s amicus brief. Ante, at\n9, n. 3. Not good enough. First, parties always have\n\u201ccause to address\u201d issues on which their entitlement to\nrelief depends. Second, and more important, Public Citi-\nzen filed its amicus brief after both sides had already filed\ntheir merits briefs. So if the timing of that brief excuses\nDart\u2019s failure to address whether the Tenth Circuit abused\nits discretion, it should excuse Owens\u2019 failure as well.\n   I come, finally, to the Court\u2019s stinging observation that I\njoined the majority opinion in Standard Fire Ins. Co. v.\nKnowles, 568 U. S. ___ (2013)\u2014a case that arose in the\nsame posture as this one, but that was resolved without\nreference to the question whether the appellate court\nabused its discretion. Ante, at 8, n. 2. Of course Knowles\ndid not address whether denials of permission to appeal\nunder \u00a71453(c)(1) are to be reviewed for abuse of discre-\ntion\u2014which is why today\u2019s majority cannot cite it as prec-\nedent. See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 630\u2013631\n(1993). As for my own culpability in overlooking the issue,\nI must accept that and will take it with me to the grave.\nBut its irrelevance to my vote in the present case has been\nwell expressed by Justice Jackson, in a passage quoted by\nthe author of today\u2019s opinion: \u201cI see no reason why I\nshould be consciously wrong today because I was uncon-\nsciously wrong yesterday.\u201d         Massachusetts v.

S. C. \u00a71254. Purporting to act pursuant to this grant of\njurisdiction, the majority today reviews the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals to deny an application for permission to\nappeal a remand order. But such an application is not a\ncase: It \u201c \u2018does not assert a grievance against anyone, does\nnot seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does\nnot even require a \u201cparty\u201d on the other side.\u2019 \u201d Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 355 (2003) (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning) (quoting Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 256\n(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).\n   To justify its action here, the majority quietly extends\nan opinion of this Court holding that applications for\ncertificates of appealability (COAs) in the federal habeas\ncontext are \u201ccases.\u201d Hohn, supra. Hohn was wrongly\ndecided, and the majority\u2019s uncritical extension of its\n2     DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING CO. v. OWENS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nholding only compounds the error. Hohn rests tenuously\non the conclusion that the determination that must be\nmade on an application for a COA is more like a threshold\ndetermination than a separate judicial proceeding. See\nid., at 246\u2013248. The basis for that conclusion, if any ex-\nists, must rest on features unique to the COA: \u201cThe COA\ndetermination . . . requires an overview of the claims in the\nhabeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d\nMiller-El, supra, at 336 (emphasis added). The best ar-\ngument one could make in favor of Hohn is that, because a\ncourt\u2019s decision on an application for a COA turns on the\nstrength of the applicant\u2019s grievance and his entitlement\nto relief, the application absorbs the case-like qualities of\nthe underlying merits case. See Hohn, supra, at 248.\n   No such osmosis could transform an application for\npermission to appeal a remand order into a \u201ccase.\u201d As\nJUSTICE SCALIA explains, the decision whether to permit\nsuch an appeal requires no assessment of the merits of a\nremand order. See ante, at 2 (dissenting opinion). The\napplication here is nothing more than a request for discre-\ntionary permission to seek review. See Miller-El, supra, at\n355 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The Tenth Circuit having\ndenied that permission, no \u201ccase\u201d ever arrived \u201cin the\ncourt of appeals.\u201d I would dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n</pre>",
