ROBERT DELEON, ET UX. \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 13\u20131516   Decided January 12, 2015\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n  Certiorari is appropriate when \u201ca United States court of\nappeals . . . has so far departed from the accepted and\nusual course of judicial proceedings . . . as to call for an\nexercise of this Court\u2019s supervisory power.\u201d Supreme\nCourt Rule 10(a). The decision of the Sixth Circuit in this\ncase\u2014holding that respondent suffered an adverse em-\nployment action when his employer transferred him to a\nposition for which he had applied\u2014qualifies for review\nunder that standard. Indeed, the holding of the court\nbelow is so clearly wrong that summary reversal is war-\nranted. The strangeness of the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding\nmay lead this Court to believe that the holding is unlikely\nto figure in future cases, but the decision, if left undis-\nturbed, will stand as a binding precedent within the Sixth\nCircuit. I would grant review and correct the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s obvious error.\n  An old maxim warns: Be careful what you wish for; you\nmight receive it. In the Sixth Circuit, however, employees\nneed not be careful what they ask for because, if their\nrequest is granted and they encounter buyer\u2019s regret, they\ncan sue.\n  After working at the Kalamazoo County Road Commis-\nsion (Commission) for 25 years, respondent Robert Deleon\napplied for a position as an equipment and facilities super-\nintendent. The job posting specified that the position\n2       KALAMAZOO COUNTY ROAD COMM\u2019N v. DELEON\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nrequired work \u201cprimarily in office conditions and in a\ngarage where there is exposure to loud noises and diesel\nfumes.\u201d Record 465. Respondent discussed the position\nwith his supervisors and decided to interview for the job.\nWhen the Commission selected another candidate, re-\nspondent evinced displeasure and questioned a supervisor\nabout the reasons why he was not selected.\n   A few weeks later, the candidate who was initially\nselected told supervisors that he was no longer interested\nin the job, and the supervisors then transferred respond-\nent to the position.\n   Respondent worked in the new position from August\n2009 until May 2010, when he had a conflict with his\nsupervisor. Shortly thereafter, he took a medical leave\nand never returned to work.\n   Respondent filed this lawsuit and alleged, as relevant\nhere, that the Commission had discriminated against him\non account of his race, national origin, and age, in viola-\ntion of the Equal Protection Clause, Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, and the Age Discrimination in Em-\nployment Act of 1967.1 The District Court, however,\ngranted the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment\nbecause respondent could not show that he had suffered\nan adverse employment action. Respondent\u2019s transfer was\na lateral move that resulted in no diminution of salary,\nbenefits, prestige, or responsibility, and he had applied for\nthe position with full knowledge of what it entailed, in-\ncluding exposure to diesel fumes. Furthermore, the Dis-\ntrict Court explained that \u201c[t]he record contains no evi-\ndence that [respondent] ever declined, or attempted to\ndecline, the transfer . . . [or] ever protested or complained\nabout [it].\u201d No. 1:11\u2013cv\u2013539 (WD Mich., Sept. 18, 2012),\npp. 15\u201316. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 His wife, Mae Deleon, sued for lack of consortium and is also a re-\n\nspondent here.\n                    Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cplaintiff \u2019s initial request\u201d for a transfer does not \u201cpre-\nclud[e] him from a finding that he suffered a materially\nadverse employment action\u201d when he later receives that\ntransfer. 739 F. 3d 914, 921 (2014).\n  Judge Sutton dissented. The dissent noted that re-\nspondent applied for the transfer with full knowledge of\nwhat it involved, including the presence of diesel fumes in\nthe workplace, ibid., and that respondent persisted in\nseeking the job after he initially did not receive it, id., at\n922. The dissent rejected the majority\u2019s suggestion that\nthe transfer was \u201c \u2018 involuntary\u2019 \u201d because respondent ad-\nmitted that no one told him that he had to take the trans-\nfer and neither did he tell anyone that he did not want it.\nIbid. Because respondent gave the Commission \u201cno rea-\nson to believe that he did not want the transfer and every\nreason to believe that he did,\u201d the dissent concluded that\nthe Commission did not subject respondent to an adverse\nemployment action. Ibid.\n  The dissent\u2019s commonsense conclusion was correct.\nUnder all of the antidiscrimination provisions upon which\nrespondent relies, he was required to show that he suf-\nfered an adverse employment action. That concept means,\nat a minimum, \u201can injury or harm\u201d that \u201ca reasonable\nemployee would have found . . . materially adverse,\u201d see\nBurlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53, 67\u201368\n(2006), and respondent did not meet that standard here.2\n  Respondent gave every indication that he wanted the\nposition to which he was transferred. He applied for it.\nHe spoke to his supervisors about it, and even when they\ntold him that some of his preferences would not be met\u2014\nhe would not receive an assistant, and he would continue\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Burlington concerned the standard under Title VII\u2019s antiretaliation\n\nprovision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20133, and that standard is broader than the\nordinary discrimination standard, 548 U. S., at 64\u201365. But since\nrespondent cannot satisfy the antiretaliation standard, it follows a\nfortiori that he cannot satisfy the discrimination standard as well.\n4      KALAMAZOO COUNTY ROAD COMM\u2019N v. DELEON\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nto be part of the on-call duty rotation\u2014he continued to\npursue his application. He interviewed for the position.\nAnd then, when he initially did not receive the transfer he\nsought, he followed up with his supervisors to ask why\nthey had not chosen him. It is of course conceivable that\nrespondent had changed his mind and no longer wanted\nthe job, but if by the time of his transfer that was so, he\ngave no objective indication of that fact. Respondent\u2019s\nsupervisors did not violate federal law by granting him\nthe transfer that he sought and that they had no reason to\nbelieve he did not want.\n  Despite the fact that respondent willingly applied for\nand never objected to the transfer, the Sixth Circuit held\nthat receiving it was an adverse employment action. The\ncourt gave three reasons for this surprising conclusion.\n  The court first relied on the fact that respondent \u201cap-\nplied for the position with the intention of commanding a\nsubstantial raise and under the impression that employ-\nment benefits would inure to the benefit of his career.\u201d\n739 F. 3d, at 920; see also id., at 916. But if respondent\nwas unwilling to accept the position without a raise, no\none knew it. In fact, when asked why he did not withdraw\nhis application when he learned that he would not receive\na higher salary, respondent replied that he \u201cfigured [he]\ncould make some changes over there.\u201d Record 521. In\nother words, respondent voluntarily applied for the job\nknowing full well what it did\u2014and did not\u2014involve.\n  Second, the court stressed that respondent \u201cwas exposed\nto toxic and hazardous diesel fumes on a daily basis,\u201d and\nthe court deemed this to be a \u201csufficient indication that\nthe work environment was objectively intolerable\u201d and\ntherefore \u201cmaterially adverse to a reasonable person.\u201d 739\nF. 3d, at 919\u2013920. But again, respondent applied for the\nposition even though he knew that the job required work-\ning \u201c \u2018in [a] garage where there is exposure to loud noises\nand diesel fumes.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 916.

It is\nimportant to keep in mind that respondent does not claim\nthat he suffered an adverse employment action based on\nthe denial of a request to be transferred back out of the\ngarage, and there is no evidence that he made such a\nrequest. And although the Sixth Circuit characterized the\nfumes in the garage as \u201ctoxic,\u201d respondent is not asserting\na claim under a provision governing workplace safety.\n   Third, the court below said that respondent\u2019s transfer\nwas \u201cinvoluntary\u201d because once he was transferred he had\nto take the position. Id., at 916, n. 1. That fact does not\nmake the transfer adverse.
