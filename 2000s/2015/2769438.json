Argued December 2, 2014\u2014Decided January 13, 2015\nPetitioner Whitfield, fleeing a botched bank robbery, entered 79-year-\n  old Mary Parnell\u2019s home and guided a terrified Parnell from a hall-\n  way to a room a few feet away, where she suffered a fatal heart at-\n  tack. He was convicted of, among other things, violating 18 U. S. C.\n  \u00a72113(e), which establishes enhanced penalties for anyone who \u201cforc-\n  es any person to accompany him without the consent of such person\u201d\n  in the course of committing or fleeing from a bank robbery. On ap-\n  peal, the Fourth Circuit held that the movement Whitfield required\n  Parnell to make satisfied the forced-accompaniment requirement, re-\n  jecting his argument that \u00a72113(e) requires \u201csubstantial\u201d movement.\nHeld: A bank robber \u201cforces [a] person to accompany him,\u201d for purposes\n  of \u00a72113(e), when he forces that person to go somewhere with him,\n  even if the movement occurs entirely within a single building or over\n  a short distance, as was the case here. At the time the forced-\n  accompaniment provision was enacted, just as today, to \u201caccompany\u201d\n  someone meant to \u201cgo with\u201d him. The word does not, as Whitfield\n  contends, connote movement over a substantial distance. Accompa-\n  niment requires movement that would normally be described as from\n  one place to another. Here, Whitfield forced Parnell to accompany\n  him for at least several feet, from one room to another, and that sure-\n  ly sufficed. The severity of the penalties for a forced-accompaniment\n  conviction\u2014a mandatory minimum of 10 years, and a maximum of\n  life imprisonment\u2014does not militate against this interpretation, for\n  the danger of a forced accompaniment does not vary depending on the\n  distance traversed. This reading also does not make any other part\n  of \u00a72113\u2019s graduated penalty scheme superfluous. Pp. 2\u20135.\n548 Fed.

S. C.\n\u00a72113(e). We consider whether this provision applies\nwhen a bank robber forces someone to move with him over\na short distance.\n                              I\n   Petitioner Larry Whitfield, fleeing police after a botched\nbank robbery, entered the home of 79-year-old Mary Par-\nnell through an unlocked door. Once inside, he encoun-\ntered a terrified Parnell and guided her from the hallway\nto a computer room (which Whitfield estimates was be-\ntween four and nine feet away. Brief for Petitioner 5).\nThere, Parnell suffered a fatal heart attack. Whitfield\nfled, and was found hiding nearby.\n   A grand jury indicted Whitfield for, among other things,\nviolating \u00a72113(e) by forcing Parnell to accompany him in\nthe course of avoiding apprehension for a bank robbery.\nThat section provides:\n    \u201cWhoever, in committing any offense defined in this\n    section, or in avoiding or attempting to avoid appre-\n2              WHITFIELD v.

Brief for Appellant in No. 10\u20135217 (CA4),\npp. 50\u201352. The Fourth Circuit disagreed, holding that,\n\u201c[a]lthough Whitfield required Mrs. Parnell to accompany\nhim for only a short distance within her own home, and for\na brief period, no more is required to prove that a forced\naccompaniment occurred.\u201d 695 F. 3d 288, 311 (2012).\nAfter further proceedings in the District Court and Court of\nAppeals, 548 Fed. Appx. 70 (2013), we granted certiorari,\n573 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                              II\n  Congress enacted the forced-accompaniment provision\nin 1934 after \u201can outbreak of bank robberies committed by\nJohn Dillinger and others.\u201d Carter v. United States, 530\nU. S. 255, 280 (2000) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). Section\n2113 has been amended frequently, but the relevant\nphrase\u2014\u201cforces any person to accompany him without the\nconsent of such person\u201d\u2014has remained unchanged, and so\npresumptively retains its original meaning. Vermont\nAgency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Ste-\nvens, 529 U. S. 765, 783, n. 12 (2000).\n  In 1934, just as today, to \u201caccompany\u201d someone meant to\n\u201cgo with\u201d him. See Oxford English Dictionary 60 (1st ed.\n1933) (defining \u201caccompany\u201d as: \u201cTo go in company with,\nto go along with\u201d). The word does not, as Whitfield con-\ntends, connote movement over a substantial distance. It\n                       Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)                   3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwas, and still is, perfectly natural to speak of accompany-\ning someone over a relatively short distance, for example:\nfrom one area within a bank \u201cto the vault\u201d;1 \u201cto the altar\u201d\nat a wedding;2 \u201cup the stairway\u201d;3 or into, out of, or across\na room.4 English literature is replete with examples. See,\ne.g., C. Dickens, David Copperfield 529 (Modern Library\ned. 2000) (Uriah \u201caccompanied me into Mr. Wickfield\u2019s\nroom\u201d); J. Austen, Pride and Prejudice 182 (Greenwich ed.\n1982) (Elizabeth \u201caccompanied her out of the room\u201d).\n   It is true enough that accompaniment does not embrace\nminimal movement\u2014for example, the movement of a bank\nteller\u2019s feet when the robber grabs her arm. It must con-\nstitute movement that would normally be described as from\none place to another, even if only from one spot within\na room or outdoors to a different one. Here, Whitfield\nforced Parnell to accompany him for at least several feet,\nfrom one room to another. That surely sufficed.\n   In an attempt to support his position that \u201caccompany\u201d\nshould be read to mean \u201caccompany over a substantial\ndistance,\u201d Whitfield observes that a forced-accompaniment\nconviction carries severe penalties: a mandatory minimum\nsentence of 10 years, and a maximum sentence of life\nimprisonment. In 1934, a forced-accompaniment convic-\ntion could even be punished with death.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1934, ch. 304, \u00a73, 48 Stat. 783. The severity of these\nsentences, Whitfield says, militates against interpreting\nsubsection (e) to capture forced accompaniment occurring\nover a small distance.\n   But it does not seem to us that the danger of a forced\naccompaniment varies with the distance traversed. Con-\nsider, for example, a hostage-taker\u2019s movement of one of\nhis victims a short distance to a window, where she would\nbe exposed to police fire; or his use of the victim as a hu-\nman shield as he approaches the door. And even if we\nthought otherwise, we would have no authority to add a\nlimitation the statute plainly does not contain. The Con-\ngress that wrote this provision may well have had most\nprominently in mind John Dillinger\u2019s driving off with\nhostages, but it enacted a provision which goes well\nbeyond that. It is simply not in accord with English usage\nto give \u201caccompany\u201d a meaning that covers only large\ndistances.\n   Whitfield also contends that \u201caccompany\u201d must be read\nnarrowly in light of \u00a72113\u2019s graduated penalty scheme.\nThat scheme prescribes: (1) a 20-year maximum sentence\nfor bank robbers who use \u201cforce and violence\u201d or \u201cintimida-\ntion,\u201d \u00a72113(a), (2) a 25-year maximum sentence for those\nwho \u201cassaul[t]\u201d or \u201cpu[t] in jeopardy the life of \u201d another\n\u201cby the use of a dangerous weapon or device,\u201d \u00a72113(d),\nand (3) a minimum sentence of 10 years, and a maximum\nsentence of life, for forced accompaniment, \u00a72113(e).\nAccording to Whitfield, bank robbers almost always \u201cexert\nsome control over the movement of the bank\u2019s employ-\nees.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 22. Therefore, he says, unless\n\u201caccompany\u201d is limited to forced movement over sub-\nstantial distances, nearly all \u00a72113 violations will be punish-\nable under subsection (e), making subsections (a) and\n(d) pointless.\n   We disagree. Even if Whitfield is right that bank rob-\nbers always \u201cexert some control\u201d over others, it does not\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfollow that they always force others to accompany them\nsomewhere\u2014that is, to go somewhere with them. As we\nhave no reason to think that to be the case, and because\nsubsections (a), (d), and (e) all cover distinct conduct, our\ninterpretation of \u201caccompany\u201d does not make any part of\n\u00a72113 superfluous.\n                        *   *    *\n  We hold that a bank robber \u201cforces [a] person to accom-\npany him,\u201d for purposes of \u00a72113(e), when he forces that\nperson to go somewhere with him, even if the movement\noccurs entirely within a single building or over a short\ndistance. Defined in this manner, Whitfield forced Parnell\nto \u201caccompany him.\u201d \u00a72113(e). The judgment of the\nFourth Circuit is affirmed.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n",

See,\ne.g., C. Dickens, David Copperfield 529 (Modern Library\ned. 2000) (Uriah \u201caccompanied me into Mr. Wickfield\u2019s\nroom\u201d); J. Austen, Pride and Prejudice 182 (Greenwich ed.\n1982) (Elizabeth \u201caccompanied her out of the room\u201d).\n   It is true enough that accompaniment does not embrace\nminimal movement\u2014for example, the movement of a bank\nteller\u2019s feet when the robber grabs her arm. It must con-\nstitute movement that would normally be described as from\none place to another, even if only from one spot within\na room or outdoors to a different one. Here, Whitfield\nforced Parnell to accompany him for at least several feet,\nfrom one room to another. That surely sufficed.\n   In an attempt to support his position that \u201caccompany\u201d\nshould be read to mean \u201caccompany over a substantial\ndistance,\u201d Whitfield observes that a forced-accompaniment\nconviction carries severe penalties: a mandatory minimum\nsentence of 10 years, and a maximum sentence of life\nimprisonment. In 1934, a forced-accompaniment convic-\ntion could even be punished with death.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1934, ch. 304, \u00a73, 48 Stat. 783. The severity of these\nsentences, Whitfield says, militates against interpreting\nsubsection (e) to capture forced accompaniment occurring\nover a small distance.\n   But it does not seem to us that the danger of a forced\naccompaniment varies with the distance traversed. Con-\nsider, for example, a hostage-taker\u2019s movement of one of\nhis victims a short distance to a window, where she would\nbe exposed to police fire; or his use of the victim as a hu-\nman shield as he approaches the door. And even if we\nthought otherwise, we would have no authority to add a\nlimitation the statute plainly does not contain. The Con-\ngress that wrote this provision may well have had most\nprominently in mind John Dillinger\u2019s driving off with\nhostages, but it enacted a provision which goes well\nbeyond that. It is simply not in accord with English usage\nto give \u201caccompany\u201d a meaning that covers only large\ndistances.\n   Whitfield also contends that \u201caccompany\u201d must be read\nnarrowly in light of \u00a72113\u2019s graduated penalty scheme.\nThat scheme prescribes: (1) a 20-year maximum sentence\nfor bank robbers who use \u201cforce and violence\u201d or \u201cintimida-\ntion,\u201d \u00a72113(a), (2) a 25-year maximum sentence for those\nwho \u201cassaul[t]\u201d or \u201cpu[t] in jeopardy the life of \u201d another\n\u201cby the use of a dangerous weapon or device,\u201d \u00a72113(d),\nand (3) a minimum sentence of 10 years, and a maximum\nsentence of life, for forced accompaniment, \u00a72113(e).\nAccording to Whitfield, bank robbers almost always \u201cexert\nsome control over the movement of the bank\u2019s employ-\nees.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 22. Therefore, he says, unless\n\u201caccompany\u201d is limited to forced movement over sub-\nstantial distances, nearly all \u00a72113 violations will be punish-\nable under subsection (e), making subsections (a) and\n(d) pointless.\n   We disagree. Even if Whitfield is right that bank rob-\nbers always \u201cexert some control\u201d over others, it does not\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfollow that they always force others to accompany them\nsomewhere\u2014that is, to go somewhere with them. As we\nhave no reason to think that to be the case, and because\nsubsections (a), (d), and (e) all cover distinct conduct, our\ninterpretation of \u201caccompany\u201d does not make any part of\n\u00a72113 superfluous.\n                        *   *    *\n  We hold that a bank robber \u201cforces [a] person to accom-\npany him,\u201d for purposes of \u00a72113(e), when he forces that\nperson to go somewhere with him, even if the movement\noccurs entirely within a single building or over a short\ndistance. Defined in this manner, Whitfield forced Parnell\nto \u201caccompany him.\u201d \u00a72113(e). The judgment of the\nFourth Circuit is affirmed.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
