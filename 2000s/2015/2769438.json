Argued December 2, 2014—Decided January 13, 2015\nPetitioner Whitfield, fleeing a botched bank robbery, entered 79-year-\n  old Mary Parnell’s home and guided a terrified Parnell from a hall-\n  way to a room a few feet away, where she suffered a fatal heart at-\n  tack. He was convicted of, among other things, violating 18 U. S. C.\n  §2113(e), which establishes enhanced penalties for anyone who “forc-\n  es any person to accompany him without the consent of such person”\n  in the course of committing or fleeing from a bank robbery. On ap-\n  peal, the Fourth Circuit held that the movement Whitfield required\n  Parnell to make satisfied the forced-accompaniment requirement, re-\n  jecting his argument that §2113(e) requires “substantial” movement.\nHeld: A bank robber “forces [a] person to accompany him,” for purposes\n  of §2113(e), when he forces that person to go somewhere with him,\n  even if the movement occurs entirely within a single building or over\n  a short distance, as was the case here. At the time the forced-\n  accompaniment provision was enacted, just as today, to “accompany”\n  someone meant to “go with” him. The word does not, as Whitfield\n  contends, connote movement over a substantial distance. Accompa-\n  niment requires movement that would normally be described as from\n  one place to another. Here, Whitfield forced Parnell to accompany\n  him for at least several feet, from one room to another, and that sure-\n  ly sufficed. The severity of the penalties for a forced-accompaniment\n  conviction—a mandatory minimum of 10 years, and a maximum of\n  life imprisonment—does not militate against this interpretation, for\n  the danger of a forced accompaniment does not vary depending on the\n  distance traversed.

We consider whether this provision applies\nwhen a bank robber forces someone to move with him over\na short distance.\n                              I\n   Petitioner Larry Whitfield, fleeing police after a botched\nbank robbery, entered the home of 79-year-old Mary Par-\nnell through an unlocked door. Once inside, he encoun-\ntered a terrified Parnell and guided her from the hallway\nto a computer room (which Whitfield estimates was be-\ntween four and nine feet away. Brief for Petitioner 5).\nThere, Parnell suffered a fatal heart attack. Whitfield\nfled, and was found hiding nearby.\n   A grand jury indicted Whitfield for, among other things,\nviolating §2113(e) by forcing Parnell to accompany him in\nthe course of avoiding apprehension for a bank robbery.\nThat section provides:\n    “Whoever, in committing any offense defined in this\n    section, or in avoiding or attempting to avoid appre-\n2              WHITFIELD v.

Brief for Appellant in No. 10–5217 (CA4),\npp. 50–52.

See,\ne.g., C. Dickens, David Copperfield 529 (Modern Library\ned. 2000) (Uriah “accompanied me into Mr. Wickfield’s\nroom”); J. Austen, Pride and Prejudice 182 (Greenwich ed.\n1982) (Elizabeth “accompanied her out of the room”).\n   It is true enough that accompaniment does not embrace\nminimal movement—for example, the movement of a bank\nteller’s feet when the robber grabs her arm. It must con-\nstitute movement that would normally be described as from\none place to another, even if only from one spot within\na room or outdoors to a different one. Here, Whitfield\nforced Parnell to accompany him for at least several feet,\nfrom one room to another. That surely sufficed.\n   In an attempt to support his position that “accompany”\nshould be read to mean “accompany over a substantial\ndistance,” Whitfield observes that a forced-accompaniment\nconviction carries severe penalties: a mandatory minimum\nsentence of 10 years, and a maximum sentence of life\nimprisonment.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1934, ch. 304, §3, 48 Stat. 783. The severity of these\nsentences, Whitfield says, militates against interpreting\nsubsection (e) to capture forced accompaniment occurring\nover a small distance.\n   But it does not seem to us that the danger of a forced\naccompaniment varies with the distance traversed. Con-\nsider, for example, a hostage-taker’s movement of one of\nhis victims a short distance to a window, where she would\nbe exposed to police fire; or his use of the victim as a hu-\nman shield as he approaches the door. And even if we\nthought otherwise, we would have no authority to add a\nlimitation the statute plainly does not contain. The Con-\ngress that wrote this provision may well have had most\nprominently in mind John Dillinger’s driving off with\nhostages, but it enacted a provision which goes well\nbeyond that. It is simply not in accord with English usage\nto give “accompany” a meaning that covers only large\ndistances.\n   Whitfield also contends that “accompany” must be read\nnarrowly in light of §2113’s graduated penalty scheme.\nThat scheme prescribes: (1) a 20-year maximum sentence\nfor bank robbers who use “force and violence” or “intimida-\ntion,” §2113(a), (2) a 25-year maximum sentence for those\nwho “assaul[t]” or “pu[t] in jeopardy the life of ” another\n“by the use of a dangerous weapon or device,” §2113(d),\nand (3) a minimum sentence of 10 years, and a maximum\nsentence of life, for forced accompaniment, §2113(e).\nAccording to Whitfield, bank robbers almost always “exert\nsome control over the movement of the bank’s employ-\nees.” Brief for Petitioner 22. Therefore, he says, unless\n“accompany” is limited to forced movement over sub-\nstantial distances, nearly all §2113 violations will be punish-\nable under subsection (e), making subsections (a) and\n(d) pointless.\n   We disagree. Even if Whitfield is right that bank rob-\nbers always “exert some control” over others, it does not\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfollow that they always force others to accompany them\nsomewhere—that is, to go somewhere with them. As we\nhave no reason to think that to be the case, and because\nsubsections (a), (d), and (e) all cover distinct conduct, our\ninterpretation of “accompany” does not make any part of\n§2113 superfluous.\n                        *   *    *\n  We hold that a bank robber “forces [a] person to accom-\npany him,” for purposes of §2113(e), when he forces that\nperson to go somewhere with him, even if the movement\noccurs entirely within a single building or over a short\ndistance. Defined in this manner, Whitfield forced Parnell\nto “accompany him.” §2113(e).

The Con-\ngress that wrote this provision may well have had most\nprominently in mind John Dillinger’s driving off with\nhostages, but it enacted a provision which goes well\nbeyond that. It is simply not in accord with English usage\nto give “accompany” a meaning that covers only large\ndistances.\n   Whitfield also contends that “accompany” must be read\nnarrowly in light of §2113’s graduated penalty scheme.\nThat scheme prescribes: (1) a 20-year maximum sentence\nfor bank robbers who use “force and violence” or “intimida-\ntion,” §2113(a), (2) a 25-year maximum sentence for those\nwho “assaul[t]” or “pu[t] in jeopardy the life of ” another\n“by the use of a dangerous weapon or device,” §2113(d),\nand (3) a minimum sentence of 10 years, and a maximum\nsentence of life, for forced accompaniment, §2113(e).\nAccording to Whitfield, bank robbers almost always “exert\nsome control over the movement of the bank’s employ-\nees.” Brief for Petitioner 22. Therefore, he says, unless\n“accompany” is limited to forced movement over sub-\nstantial distances, nearly all §2113 violations will be punish-\nable under subsection (e), making subsections (a) and\n(d) pointless.\n   We disagree. Even if Whitfield is right that bank rob-\nbers always “exert some control” over others, it does not\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfollow that they always force others to accompany them\nsomewhere—that is, to go somewhere with them. As we\nhave no reason to think that to be the case, and because\nsubsections (a), (d), and (e) all cover distinct conduct, our\ninterpretation of “accompany” does not make any part of\n§2113 superfluous.\n                        *   *    *\n  We hold that a bank robber “forces [a] person to accom-\npany him,” for purposes of §2113(e), when he forces that\nperson to go somewhere with him, even if the movement\noccurs entirely within a single building or over a short\ndistance. Defined in this manner, Whitfield forced Parnell\nto “accompany him.” §2113(e). The judgment of the\nFourth Circuit is affirmed.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2769438/", "sha1": "ca95e8770eb2a52a7bd76dd9f5dcf716984183b2", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-01-13T08:01:32.131544"}
