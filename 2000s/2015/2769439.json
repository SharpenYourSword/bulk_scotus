Argued November 4, 2014—Decided January 13, 2015\nExactly three years after borrowing money from respondent Country-\n  wide Home Loans, Inc., to refinance their home mortgage, petitioners\n  Larry and Cheryle Jesinoski sent Countrywide and respondent Bank\n  of America Home Loans, which had acquired Countrywide, a letter\n  purporting to rescind the transaction. Bank of America replied, re-\n  fusing to acknowledge the rescission’s validity. One year and one day\n  later, the Jesinoskis filed suit in federal court, seeking a declaration\n  of rescission and damages. The District Court entered judgment on\n  the pleadings for respondents, concluding that a borrower can exer-\n  cise the Truth in Lending Act’s right to rescind a loan, see 15 U. S. C.\n  §1635(a), (f), only by filing a lawsuit within three years of the date\n  the loan was consummated. The Jesinoskis’ complaint, filed four\n  years and one day after the loan’s consummation, was ineffective.\n  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A borrower exercising his right to rescind under the Act need only\n provide written notice to his lender within the 3-year period, not file\n suit within that period. Section 1635(a)’s unequivocal terms—a bor-\n rower “shall have the right to rescind . . . by notifying the creditor . . .\n of his intention to do so” (emphasis added)—leave no doubt that re-\n scission is effected when the borrower notifies the creditor of his in-\n tention to rescind. This conclusion is not altered by §1635(f), which\n states when the right to rescind must be exercised, but says nothing\n about how that right is exercised. Nor does §1635(g)—which states\n that “in addition to rescission the court may award relief . . . not re-\n lating to the right to rescind”—support respondents’ view that rescis-\n sion is necessarily a consequence of judicial action.

The question presented is whether\na borrower exercises this right by providing written no-\ntice to his lender, or whether he must also file a lawsuit\nbefore the 3-year period elapses.\n   On February 23, 2007, petitioners Larry and Cheryle\nJesinoski refinanced the mortgage on their home by bor-\nrowing $611,000 from respondent Countrywide Home\nLoans, Inc. Exactly three years later, on February 23,\n2010, the Jesinoskis mailed respondents a letter purport-\ning to rescind the loan.

The Eighth Circuit affirmed. 729 F. 3d\n1092, 1093 (2013) (per curiam).\n   Congress passed the Truth in Lending Act, 82 Stat. 146,\nas amended, to help consumers “avoid the uninformed use\nof credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate\nand unfair credit billing.” 15 U. S. C. §1601(a). To this\nend, the Act grants borrowers the right to rescind a loan\n“until midnight of the third business day following the\nconsummation of the transaction or the delivery of the\n[disclosures required by the Act], whichever is later, by\nnotifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of\nthe [Federal Reserve] Board, of his intention to do so.”\n§1635(a) (2006 ed.).* This regime grants borrowers an\nunconditional right to rescind for three days, after which\nthey may rescind only if the lender failed to satisfy the\nAct’s disclosure requirements. But this conditional right\nto rescind does not last forever. Even if a lender never\nmakes the required disclosures, the “right of rescission\nshall expire three years after the date of consummation of\nthe transaction or upon the sale of the property, whichever\ncomes first.” §1635(f). The Eighth Circuit’s affirmance in\nthe present case rested upon its holding in Keiran v.

The\nlanguage leaves no doubt that rescission is effected when\nthe borrower notifies the creditor of his intention to re-\nscind. It follows that, so long as the borrower notifies\nwithin three years after the transaction is consummated,\nhis rescission is timely. The statute does not also require\nhim to sue within three years.\n   Nothing in §1635(f) changes this conclusion. Although\n§1635(f) tells us when the right to rescind must be exer-\ncised, it says nothing about how that right is exercised.\nOur observation in Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, 523 U. S.\n410, 417 (1998), that §1635(f) “govern[s] the life of the\nunderlying right” is beside the point. That case concerned\na borrower’s attempt to rescind in the course of a foreclo-\nsure proceeding initiated six years after the loan’s con-\nsummation. We concluded only that there was “no federal\nright to rescind, defensively or otherwise, after the 3-year\nperiod of §1635(f) has run,” id., at 419, not that there was\nno rescission until a suit is filed.\n   Respondents do not dispute that §1635(a) requires only\nwritten notice of rescission. Indeed, they concede that\nwritten notice suffices to rescind a loan within the first\nthree days after the transaction is consummated. They\nfurther concede that written notice suffices after that\nperiod if the parties agree that the lender failed to make\nthe required disclosures. Respondents argue, however,\nthat if the parties dispute the adequacy of the disclo-\nsures—and thus the continued availability of the right to\nrescind—then written notice does not suffice.\n   Section 1635(a) nowhere suggests a distinction between\ndisputed and undisputed rescissions, much less that a\nlawsuit would be required for the latter. In an effort to\nsidestep this problem, respondents point to a neighboring\n4      JESINOSKI v. COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovision, §1635(g), which they believe provides support\nfor their interpretation of the Act. Section 1635(g) states\nmerely that, “[i]n any action in which it is determined that\na creditor has violated this section, in addition to rescis-\nsion the court may award relief under section 1640 of this\ntitle for violations of this subchapter not relating to the\nright to rescind.” Respondents argue that the phrase\n“award relief ” “in addition to rescission” confirms that\nrescission is a consequence of judicial action. But the fact\nthat it can be a consequence of judicial action when\n§1635(g) is triggered in no way suggests that it can only\nfollow from such action. The Act contemplates various\nsituations in which the question of a lender’s compliance\nwith the Act’s disclosure requirements may arise in a\nlawsuit—for example, a lender’s foreclosure action in\nwhich the borrower raises inadequate disclosure as an\naffirmative defense. Section 1635(g) makes clear that a\ncourt may not only award rescission and thereby relieve\nthe borrower of his financial obligation to the lender, but\nmay also grant any of the remedies available under §1640\n(including statutory damages). It has no bearing upon\nwhether and how borrower-rescission under §1635(a) may\noccur.\n   Finally, respondents invoke the common law. It is true\nthat rescission traditionally required either that the re-\nscinding party return what he received before a rescission\ncould be effected (rescission at law), or else that a court\naffirmatively decree rescission (rescission in equity). 2 D.\nDobbs, Law of Remedies §9.3(3), pp. 585–586 (2d ed.\n1993). It is also true that the Act disclaims the common-\nlaw condition precedent to rescission at law that the bor-\nrower tender the proceeds received under the transaction.\n15 U. S. C. §1635(b). But the negation of rescission-at-\nlaw’s tender requirement hardly implies that the Act\ncodifies rescission in equity. Nothing in our jurisprudence,\nand no tool of statutory interpretation, requires that a\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Sav. &\nLoan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108–109 (1991).\nThe clear import of §1635(a) is that a borrower need only\nprovide written notice to a lender in order to exercise his\nright to rescind. To the extent §1635(b) alters the tradi-\ntional process for unwinding such a unilaterally rescinded\ntransaction, this is simply a case in which statutory law\nmodifies common-law practice.\n                         *    *    *\n  The Jesinoskis mailed respondents written notice of\ntheir intention to rescind within three years of their loan’s\nconsummation. Because this is all that a borrower must\ndo in order to exercise his right to rescind under the Act,\nthe court below erred in dismissing the complaint. Accord-\ningly, we reverse the judgment of the Eighth Circuit and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 2769439, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/01/13/jesinoski_v._countrywide_home_loans_inc..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

But the fact\nthat it can be a consequence of judicial action when\n§1635(g) is triggered in no way suggests that it can only\nfollow from such action. The Act contemplates various\nsituations in which the question of a lender’s compliance\nwith the Act’s disclosure requirements may arise in a\nlawsuit—for example, a lender’s foreclosure action in\nwhich the borrower raises inadequate disclosure as an\naffirmative defense. Section 1635(g) makes clear that a\ncourt may not only award rescission and thereby relieve\nthe borrower of his financial obligation to the lender, but\nmay also grant any of the remedies available under §1640\n(including statutory damages). It has no bearing upon\nwhether and how borrower-rescission under §1635(a) may\noccur.\n   Finally, respondents invoke the common law. It is true\nthat rescission traditionally required either that the re-\nscinding party return what he received before a rescission\ncould be effected (rescission at law), or else that a court\naffirmatively decree rescission (rescission in equity). 2 D.\nDobbs, Law of Remedies §9.3(3), pp. 585–586 (2d ed.\n1993). It is also true that the Act disclaims the common-\nlaw condition precedent to rescission at law that the bor-\nrower tender the proceeds received under the transaction.\n15 U. S. C. §1635(b). But the negation of rescission-at-\nlaw’s tender requirement hardly implies that the Act\ncodifies rescission in equity. Nothing in our jurisprudence,\nand no tool of statutory interpretation, requires that a\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncongressional Act must be construed as implementing its\nclosest common-law analogue. Cf. Astoria Fed. Sav. &\nLoan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108–109 (1991).\nThe clear import of §1635(a) is that a borrower need only\nprovide written notice to a lender in order to exercise his\nright to rescind. To the extent §1635(b) alters the tradi-\ntional process for unwinding such a unilaterally rescinded\ntransaction, this is simply a case in which statutory law\nmodifies common-law practice.\n                         *    *    *\n  The Jesinoskis mailed respondents written notice of\ntheir intention to rescind within three years of their loan’s\nconsummation. Because this is all that a borrower must\ndo in order to exercise his right to rescind under the Act,\nthe court below erred in dismissing the complaint. Accord-\ningly, we reverse the judgment of the Eighth Circuit and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2769439/", "sha1": "e1a6aef73065d14294e014d6733eb3fad8cede51", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-01-13T08:01:32.382053"}
