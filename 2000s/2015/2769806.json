Argued November 10, 2014—Decided January 14, 2015\nRespondent Roswell’s city council (Council) held a public hearing to\n  consider an application by petitioner T-Mobile South, LLC, to build a\n  cell phone tower on residential property. During the hearing, several\n  Council members expressed concerns about the tower’s impact on the\n  area. The hearing ended with the Council unanimously passing a\n  motion to deny the application. Two days later, the City’s Planning\n  and Zoning Division informed petitioner by letter that the application\n  had been denied and that minutes from the hearing would be made\n  available. The detailed minutes were published 26 days later.\n    Petitioner filed suit, alleging that the Council’s denial was not sup-\n  ported by substantial evidence in the record. The District Court\n  agreed, concluding that the City, by failing to issue a written decision\n  stating its reasons for denying the application, had violated the Tele-\n  communications Act of 1996, which provides that a locality’s denial\n  “shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained\n  in a written record,” 47 U. S. C. §332(c)(7)(B)(iii). The Eleventh Cir-\n  cuit, following its precedent, found that the Act’s requirements were\n  satisfied here because petitioner had received a denial letter and pos-\n  sessed a transcript of the hearing that it arranged to have recorded.\nHeld:\n    1. Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) requires localities to provide reasons\n when they deny applications to build cell phone towers. This conclu-\n sion follows from the Act’s provisions, which both preserve and specif-\n ically limit traditional state and local government authority. It\n would be considerably difficult for a reviewing court to determine\n whether a locality’s denial was “supported by substantial evidence\n contained in a written record,” §332(c)(7)(B)(iii), or whether a locality\n2            T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    had “unreasonably discriminate[d] among providers of functionally\n    equivalent services,” §332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), or regulated siting “on the ba-\n    sis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions,”\n    §332(c)(7)(B)(iv), if localities were not obligated to state their reasons\n    for denial. And nothing in the Act suggests that Congress meant to\n    use the phrase “substantial evidence” as anything but an administra-\n    tive law “term of art” that describes how “an administrative record is\n    to be judged by a reviewing court.” United States v. Carlo Bianchi &\n    Co., 373 U. S. 709, 715. Pp. 6–8.\n       2. Localities are not required to provide their reasons for denying\n    siting applications in the denial notice itself, but may state those rea-\n    sons with sufficient clarity in some other written record issued essen-\n    tially contemporaneously with the denial. Pp. 8–13.\n          (a) Nothing in the Act’s text imposes a requirement that the rea-\n    sons be given in any particular form, and the Act’s saving clause,\n    §332(c)(7)(A), makes clear that the only limitations imposed on local\n    governments are those enumerated in the statute. Localities comply\n    with their obligation to give written reasons so long as those reasons\n    are stated clearly enough to enable judicial review. Because an ad-\n    versely affected entity must decide whether to seek judicial review\n    within 30 days from the date of the denial, §332(c)(7)(B)(v), and be-\n    cause a court cannot review the denial without knowing the locality’s\n    reasons, the locality must provide or make available its written rea-\n    sons at essentially the same time as it communicates its denial.\n    Pp. 8–11.\n          (b) Petitioner’s contrary arguments are unavailing. The statute’s\n    word “decision” does not connote a written document that itself pro-\n    vides all the reasons for a given judgment. The absence of the word\n    “notify” in the provision at issue also does not signal an intention to\n    require communication of more than a judgment. Nor does an obliga-\n    tion to provide reasons in the writing conveying the denial arise from\n    the “substantial evidence” requirement itself or from the requirement\n    of court review “on an expedited basis,” §332(c)(7)(B)(v). It is suffi-\n    cient that a locality’s reasons be provided in a manner that is clear\n    enough and prompt enough to enable judicial review. Pp. 11–13.\n       3. The City failed to comply with its statutory obligations under the\n    Act. Although it issued its reasons in writing and did so in an ac-\n    ceptable form, it did not provide its written reasons essentially con-\n    temporaneously with its written denial when it issued detailed\n    minutes 26 days after the date of the written denial and 4 days before\n    expiration of petitioner’s time to seek judicial review.

S. C.\n§332(c)(7)(B)(iii). The question presented is whether, and\nin what form, localities must provide reasons when they\ndeny telecommunication companies’ applications to con­\nstruct cell phone towers. We hold that localities must\nprovide or make available their reasons, but that those\nreasons need not appear in the written denial letter or\nnotice provided by the locality. Instead, the locality’s\nreasons may appear in some other written record so long\nas the reasons are sufficiently clear and are provided or\nmade accessible to the applicant essentially contempora­\nneously with the written denial letter or notice.\n                           I\n  In February 2010, petitioner T-Mobile South, LLC,\napplied to build a new, 108-foot-tall cell phone tower on\n2        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n2.8 acres of vacant residential property in the city of Ros-\nwell, Georgia (City). Roswell’s city ordinances require\nthat any cell phone tower proposed for a residential zoning\ndistrict must take the form of an “alternative tower struc­\nture”—an artificial tree, clock tower, steeple, or light\npole—that, in the opinion of the city council (City Council\nor Council), is “compatible with the natural setting and\nsurrounding structures” and that effectively camouflages\nthe tower. Code of Ordinances §§21.2.2, 21.2.5(a); see\nApp. 68, 75. In accordance with these provisions, petition­\ner’s application proposed a structure in the shape of an\nartificial tree or “monopine.” Id., at 42.\n   The City’s Planning and Zoning Division reviewed peti­\ntioner’s application, along with a substantial number of\nletters and petitions opposing it, and ultimately issued a\nmemorandum to the City Council concluding that the\napplication met all of the requirements set out in the\nCity’s ordinances. It recommended that the City Council\napprove the application on three conditions to which peti­\ntioner was prepared to agree.\n   The City Council then held a 2-hour-long public hearing\non April 12, 2010, to consider petitioner’s application.\nPetitioner arranged privately to have the hearing tran­\nscribed, and, as discussed below, the City subsequently\nissued detailed minutes summarizing the proceedings. At\nthe hearing, after the Planning and Zoning Division pre­\nsented its recommendation and after petitioner’s repre­\nsentatives made a presentation in support of the applica­\ntion, a number of residents raised concerns. Among these\nwere concerns that the tower would lack aesthetic compat­\nibility, that the technology was outdated and unnecessary,\nand that the tower would be too tall. Petitioner’s repre­\nsentatives responded by reiterating that it had met all of\nthe ordinance’s requirements and by providing testimony\nfrom a property appraiser that placement of cell phone\ntowers does not reduce property values.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Members of the City Council then commented on the\napplication. One member of the six-person Council was\nrecused, see id., at 111 (hearing transcript); id., at 322\n(meeting minutes), leaving five voting members. Member\nIgleheart said that other carriers had sufficient coverage\nin the area and that the City did not need to level the\nplaying field for petitioner. Id., at 173–174 (hearing tran­\nscript). He also stated that his “[b]ottom line” was that he\ndid not think it was “appropriate for residentially zoned\nproperties to have the cell towers in their location.” Id., at\n174 (hearing transcript); id., at 338 (meeting minutes).\nMember Dippolito found it difficult to believe that the\ntower would not negatively impact the area and doubted\nthat it would be compatible with the natural setting. Id.,\nat 175–176 (hearing transcript); id., at 339 (meeting\nminutes). Member Wynn expressed concerns about the\nlack of a backup generator for emergency services, id., at\n172 (hearing transcript), and did not think the tower\nwould be “compatible with this area,” id., at 176 (hearing\ntranscript); id., at 339 (meeting minutes). Member Orlans\nsaid only that he was impressed with the information put\ntogether by both sides. Id., at 173 (hearing transcript); id.,\nat 337 (meeting minutes). Finally, Member Price, the\nliaison to the Planning and Zoning Division, made a mo­\ntion to deny the application. She said that the tower\nwould be aesthetically incompatible with the natural\nsetting, that it would be too tall, and that its proximity to\nother homes would adversely affect the neighbors and the\nresale value of their properties. Id., at 176–177 (hearing\ntranscript); id., at 339–340 (meeting minutes). The mo­\ntion was seconded, and then passed unanimously. Id., at\n177 (hearing transcript); id., at 340 (meeting minutes).\n   Two days later, on April 14, 2010, the Planning and\nZoning Division sent a letter to petitioner that said in its\nentirety:\n4          T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n       “Please be advised the City of Roswell Mayor and\n     City Council denied the request from T-Mobile for a\n     108’ mono-pine alternative tower structure during\n     their April 12, 2010 hearing. The minutes from the\n     aforementioned hearing may be obtained from the city\n     clerk. Please contact Sue Creel or Betsy Branch at\n     [phone number].\n       “If you have any additional questions, please con­\n     tact me at [phone number].” Id., at 278.\nThe detailed written minutes of the hearing, however,\nwere not approved and published by the City until 26 days\nlater, on May 10, 2010. See id., at 321–341 (meeting\nminutes).1\n  On May 13, 2010, 3 days after the detailed minutes\nwere published—and now 29 days after the City denied\npetitioner’s application—petitioner filed suit in Federal\nDistrict Court. It alleged that the denial of the application\nwas not supported by substantial evidence in the record,\nand would effectively prohibit the provision of wireless\nservice in violation of the Telecommunications Act of\n1996 (Act). The parties filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment.\n  The District Court granted petitioner’s motion for sum­\nmary judgment, concluding that the City had violated the\n\n——————\n  1 Brief minutes had been adopted on April 19, but these only noted\n\nthat the motion to deny the application had passed with five members\nin favor and one member recused.

The\nDistrict Court interpreted the Act to require that a written\ndenial letter or notice describe the reasons for the denial\nand that those reasons be sufficiently explained to allow a\nreviewing court to evaluate them against the written\nrecord.\n   The Eleventh Circuit reversed. 731 F. 3d 1213 (2013).\nIt explained that, in T-Mobile South, LLC v. Milton, 728\nF. 3d 1274 (2013), which was decided after the District\nCourt’s decision in this case, it had held that “to the extent\nthat the decision must contain grounds or reasons or\nexplanations, it is sufficient if those are contained in a\ndifferent written document or documents that the appli­\ncant is given or has access to.” Id., at 1285. The Eleventh\nCircuit acknowledged that the Courts of Appeals had split\non that question, and that it had departed from the major­\nity rule. Compare Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc.\nv. Todd, 244 F. 3d 51, 60 (CA1 2001) (requiring that a\nlocality issue a written denial that itself contains a “suffi­\ncient explanation of the reasons for the permit denial to\nallow a reviewing court to evaluate the evidence in the\nrecord supporting those reasons”); New Par v. Saginaw,\n301 F. 3d 390, 395–396 (CA6 2002); MetroPCS, Inc. v. City\nand County of San Francisco, 400 F. 3d 715, 723 (CA9\n2005), with AT&T Wireless PCS, Inc. v. City Council of\nVirginia Beach, 155 F. 3d 423, 429 (CA4 1998) (holding\nthat written minutes of a meeting and the word “denied”\nstamped on a letter describing the application were\nsufficient). Applying its rule to this case, the Eleventh\nCircuit found that the requirements of 47 U. S. C.\n§332(c)(7)(B)(iii) were satisfied because petitioner had its\nown transcript as well as a written letter stating that the\napplication had been denied and informing petitioner that\nit could obtain access to the minutes of the hearing. 731\nF. 3d, at 1221.

CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nits written reasons to petitioner.\n   We granted certiorari, 572 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nreverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  The first question we answer is whether the statute\nrequires localities to provide reasons when they deny\napplications to build cell phone towers. We answer that\nquestion in the affirmative.\n  Our conclusion follows from the provisions of the Tele­\ncommunications Act. The Act generally preserves “the\ntraditional authority of state and local governments to\nregulate the location, construction, and modification” of\nwireless communications facilities like cell phone towers,\nbut imposes “specific limitations” on that authority. Ran-\ncho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U. S. 113, 115 (2005); see\n§332(c)(7)(B). One of those limitations is that any decision\nto deny a request to build a tower “shall be in writing and\nsupported by substantial evidence contained in a written\nrecord.” §332(c)(7)(B)(iii). Another is that parties adversely\naffected by a locality’s decision may seek judicial review.\n§332(c)(7)(B)(v). In order to determine whether a locality’s\ndenial was supported by substantial evidence, as Congress\ndirected, courts must be able to identify the reason or\nreasons why the locality denied the application. See Ran-\ncho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 128 (BREYER, J., joined by\nO’Connor, Souter, and GINSBURG, JJ., concurring) (observ­\ning that the Act “requires local zoning boards . . . [to] give\nreasons for [their] denials ‘in writing’ ”).\n  The requirement that localities must provide reasons\nwhen they deny applications is further underscored by two\nof the other limitations on local authority set out in the\nAct. The Act provides that localities “shall not unreason-\nably discriminate among providers of functionally equiva­\nlent services,” and may not regulate the construction of\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npersonal wireless service facilities “on the basis of the\nenvironmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the\nextent that such facilities comply with the [Federal Com­\nmunications Commission’s] regulations concerning such\nemissions.” §§332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), (iv).2 Again, it would be\nconsiderably more difficult for a reviewing court to deter­\nmine whether a locality had violated these substantive\nprovisions if the locality were not obligated to state its\nreasons.\n   This conclusion is not just commonsensical, but flows\ndirectly from Congress’ use of the term “substantial evi­\ndence.” The statutory phrase “substantial evidence” is a\n“term of art” in administrative law that describes how “an\nadministrative record is to be judged by a reviewing\ncourt.” United States v. Carlo Bianchi & Co., 373 U. S.\n709, 715 (1963). There is no reason discernible from the\ntext of the Act to think that Congress meant to use the\nphrase in a different way. See FAA v. Cooper, 566 U. S.\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (“[W]hen Congress employs a\nterm of art, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of\nideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the\nbody of learning from which it was taken” (internal quota­\ntion marks omitted)). Indeed, for those who consider\nlegislative history relevant, the Conference Report accom­\npanying the Act confirmed as much when it noted that\n“[t]he phrase ‘substantial evidence contained in a written\nrecord’ is the traditional standard used for review of agency\nactions.” H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104–458, p. 208 (1996).\n   By employing the term “substantial evidence,” Congress\nthus invoked, among other things, our recognition that\n“the orderly functioning of the process of [substantial­\n——————\n  2 The last “limitation” listed in the Act provides that localities shall\n\nact on applications to construct personal wireless service facilities\n“within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed . . .\ntaking into account the nature and scope of such request.”\n§332(c)(7)(B)(ii).\n8        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nevidence] review requires that the grounds upon which the\nadministrative agency acted be clearly disclosed,” and that\n“courts cannot exercise their duty of [substantial-evidence]\nreview unless they are advised of the considerations un­\nderlying the action under review.” SEC v. Chenery Corp.,\n318 U. S. 80, 94 (1943); see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn.\nof United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins.\nCo., 463 U. S. 29, 43 (1983) (explaining that an agency\nmust “articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action”\nto enable substantial-evidence review); Beaumont, S. L. &\nW. R. Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 74, 86 (1930) (“Com­\nplete statements by the [agency] showing the grounds\nupon which its determinations rest are quite as necessary\nas are opinions of lower courts setting forth the reasons on\nwhich they base their decisions . . .”).\n   In response, the City primarily argues that a reason-\ngiving obligation would deprive it of local zoning author-\nity. But Congress intended to place “specific limitations on\nthe traditional authority of state and local governments”\nregarding cell phone tower siting applications. Rancho\nPalos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 115. One of those “limitations,”\n§332(c)(7)(B), necessarily implied by the Act’s “substantial\nevidence” requirement, is that local zoning authorities\nstate their reasons when they deny applications.\n   In short, the statutory text and structure, and the con­\ncepts that Congress imported into the statutory frame­\nwork, all point clearly toward the conclusion that localities\nmust provide reasons when they deny cell phone tower\nsiting applications. We stress, however, that these rea­\nsons need not be elaborate or even sophisticated, but\nrather, as discussed below, simply clear enough to enable\njudicial review.\n                          B\n  The second question we answer is whether these rea­\nsons must appear in the same writing that conveys the\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlocality’s denial of an application. We answer that ques­\ntion in the negative.\n   Like our conclusion that localities must provide reasons,\nour conclusion that the reasons need not appear in a de-\nnial letter follows from the statutory text. Other than\nproviding that a locality’s reasons must be given in writ­\ning, nothing in that text imposes any requirement that the\nreasons be given in any particular form.\n   The Act’s saving clause makes clear that, other than the\nenumerated limitations imposed on local governments by\nthe statute itself, “nothing in this chapter shall limit or\naffect the authority of a State or local government or\ninstrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the\nplacement, construction, and modification of personal\nwireless service facilities.” §332(c)(7)(A). Given this lan­\nguage, and the system of “cooperative federalism” on\nwhich the Act is premised, Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S.,\nat 128 (BREYER, J., concurring), we understand the enu­\nmerated limitations to set out an exclusive list. So while\nthe text and structure of the Act render it inescapable that\nlocalities must provide reasons in writing when they deny\napplications, we can locate in the Act no command—either\nexplicit or implicit—that localities must provide those\nreasons in a specific document.\n   We therefore conclude that Congress imposed no specific\nrequirement on that front, but instead permitted localities\nto comply with their obligation to give written reasons so\nlong as the locality’s reasons are stated clearly enough to\nenable judicial review. Although the statute does not\nrequire a locality to provide its written reasons in any\nparticular format, and although a locality may rely on\ndetailed meeting minutes as it did here, we agree with the\nSolicitor General that “the local government may be better\nserved by including a separate statement containing its\nreasons.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26; see\nalso id., at 34. If the locality writes a short statement\n10         T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nproviding its reasons, the locality can likely avoid prolong­\ning the litigation—and adding expense to the taxpayers,\nthe companies, and the legal system—while the parties\nargue about exactly what the sometimes voluminous\nrecord means. Moreover, in that circumstance, the locality\nneed not worry that, upon review of the record, a court will\neither find that it could not ascertain the locality’s reasons\nor mistakenly ascribe to the locality a rationale that was\nnot in fact the reason for the locality’s denial.\n  We hasten to add that a locality cannot stymie or bur­\nden the judicial review contemplated by the statute by\ndelaying the release of its reasons for a substantial time\nafter it conveys its written denial. The statute provides\nthat an entity adversely affected by a locality’s decision\nmay seek judicial review within 30 days of the decision.\n§332(c)(7)(B)(v). Because an entity may not be able to\nmake a considered decision whether to seek judicial re­\nview without knowing the reasons for the denial of its\napplication, and because a court cannot review the denial\nwithout knowing the locality’s reasons, the locality must\nprovide or make available its written reasons at essentially\nthe same time as it communicates its denial.3\n——————\n   3 THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent rejects this particular requirement, and\n\ninstead invents a process that turns judicial review on its head. Rather\nthan give effect to a process that would permit an entity seeking to\nchallenge a locality’s decision to see the locality’s written reasons before\nit files its suit—and the dissent agrees that the statute requires that a\nlocality convey its reasons in writing, see post, at 5—the dissent would\nfashion a world in which a locality can wait until a lawsuit is com­\nmenced and a court orders it to state its reasons. The entity would thus\nbe left to guess at what the locality’s written reasons will be, write a\ncomplaint that contains those hypotheses, and risk being sandbagged\nby the written reasons that the locality subsequently provides in\nlitigation after the challenging entity has shown its cards. The review­\ning court would then need to ensure that those reasons are not post hoc\nrationalizations, see Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371\nU. S. 156, 168 (1962), but the dissent offers no guidance as to how a\nreviewing court that has never seen near-contemporaneous reasons\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   This rule ought not to unduly burden localities given the\nrange of ways in which localities can provide their rea­\nsons. Moreover, the denial itself needs only to be issued\n(or the application otherwise acted upon) “within a rea­\nsonable period of time.” §332(c)(7)(B)(ii). In an interpre­\ntation we have recently upheld, see Arlington v. FCC, 569\nU. S. ___ (2013), the Federal Communications Commission\n(FCC) has generally interpreted this provision to allow\nlocalities 90 days to act on applications to place new an­\ntennas on existing towers and 150 days to act on other\nsiting applications. In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling to\nClarify Provisions of Section 332(c)(7)(b), 24 FCC Rcd.\n13994, 13995, ¶4 (2009). If a locality is not in a position to\nprovide its reasons promptly, the locality can delay the\nissuance of its denial within this 90- or 150-day window,\nand instead release it along with its reasons once those\nreasons are ready to be provided. Only once the denial is\nissued would the 30-day commencement-of-suit clock\nbegin.4\n                             III\n  Petitioner offers four reasons why, in its view, our anal­\nysis in Part II–B is incorrect. Petitioner argues that the\nstatute requires that a locality’s reasons appear in the\nwriting conveying the denial itself, but none of petitioner’s\n——————\nwould conduct that inquiry.\n   4 The City urges us to hold that the clock does not begin to run until\n\nafter the reasons are given. We cannot so hold, however, without\nrewriting the statutory text. The Act provides that a lawsuit may be\nfiled by “[a]ny person adversely affected by any final action or failure to\nact . . . within 30 days after such action or failure to act.” 47 U. S. C.\n§332(c)(7)(B)(v). The relevant “final action” is the issuance of the\nwritten notice of denial, not the subsequent issuance of reasons ex­\nplaining the denial. See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 177–178\n(1997) (agency action is “final” if it “mark[s] the consummation of the\nagency’s decisionmaking process” and determines “rights or obligations”\nor triggers “legal consequences” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n12         T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nreasons are persuasive.\n  First, petitioner argues that the word “decision” in the\nstatute—the thing that must be “in writing”—connotes a\nwritten document that itself provides all the reasons for a\ngiven judgment. See Brief for Petitioner 24 (quoting\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 407 (6th ed. 1990) (a “decision” is a\nwritten document providing “ ‘the reasons given for [a]\njudgment’ ”)). But even petitioner concedes, with its pre­\nferred dictionary in hand, that the word “decision” can also\nmean “something short of a statement of reasons explain­\ning a determination.” Brief for Petitioner 24 (citing\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, at 407).5\n  Second, petitioner claims that other provisions in the\nAct use the word “notify” when the Act means to impose\nonly a requirement that a judgment be communicated.6\nBecause the provision at issue here does not use the word\n“notify,” petitioner argues, it must contemplate something\n——————\n  5 One of petitioner’s amici argues that Congress has used the word\n\n“decision” in the context of other communications laws to mean some­\nthing more than a judgment or verdict. See Brief for Chamber of\nCommerce of the United States of America (Chamber) et al. 9–13. But\nwhile it is true that a word used across “the same act” should be given\nthe same meaning, see Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd., 566 U. S.\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10), the Chamber’s evidence is less persua­\nsive because it arises out of entirely different “acts” and does not\ninvolve any term of art. By relying on other parts of Title 47 of the\nU. S. Code—some enacted in the Communications Act of 1934 decades\nbefore the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 at issue\nhere—the Chamber stretches to invoke this canon of construction\nbeyond its most forceful application. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Read­\ning Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 172–173 (2012).\n  6 For example, petitioner cites §11 (FCC must “notify the parties\n\nconcerned” when it makes a “determination and order” regarding a rail-\nroad or telegraph company’s failure to maintain and operate a tele­\ngraph line for public use) and §398(b)(5) (“Whenever the Secretary [of\nCommerce] makes a final determination . . . that a recipient” of federal\nfunds has engaged in impermissible discrimination, the Secretary shall\n“notify the recipient in writing of such determination . . .”). Brief for\nPetitioner 24–25.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmore than a judgment. This does not logically follow. For\none thing, the statute at issue here does not use any verb\nat all to describe the conveying of information from a\nlocality to an applicant; it just says that a denial “shall be\nin writing and supported by substantial evidence con­\ntained in a written record.” §332(c)(7)(B)(iii). But more to\nthe point, “notify” is a verb the use—or nonuse—of which\ndoes not reveal what the thing to be notified of or about is.\n   Third, petitioner contends that the “substantial evi­\ndence” requirement itself demands that localities identify\ntheir reasons in their written denials. See Brief for Peti­\ntioner 23. Certainly, as discussed above, the phrase “sub­\nstantial evidence” requires localities to give reasons, but it\nsays nothing on its own about the document in which\nthose reasons must be stated or presented to a reviewing\ncourt.\n   Finally, petitioner invokes the statutory requirement\nthat any adversely affected person shall have their chal­\nlenge heard by a court “on an expedited basis.”\n§332(c)(7)(B)(v). See Brief for Petitioner 14–15, 28. As\nlong as the reasons are provided in a written record, how­\never, and as long as they are provided in such a manner\nthat is clear enough and prompt enough to enable judicial\nreview, there is no reason to require that those reasons be\nprovided in the written denial itself.\n   We acknowledge that petitioner, along with those\nCourts of Appeals that have required a locality’s reasons\nto appear in its written denial itself, have offered plausible\nbases for a rule that would require as much. See, e.g.,\nTodd, 244 F. 3d, at 60 (“A written record can create diffi­\nculties in determining the rationale behind a board’s\ndecision . . .”). Congress could adopt such a rule if it were\nso inclined, but it did not do so in this statute. It is not\nour place to legislate another approach.\n14         T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               IV\n   Thus, we hold that the Act requires localities to provide\nreasons when they deny cell phone tower siting applica­\ntions, but that the Act does not require localities to pro­\nvide those reasons in written denial letters or notices\nthemselves. A locality may satisfy its statutory obliga­\ntions if it states its reasons with sufficient clarity in some\nother written record issued essentially contemporaneously\nwith the denial. In this case, the City provided its reasons\nin writing and did so in the acceptable form of detailed\nminutes of the City Council meeting. The City, however,\ndid not provide its written reasons essentially contempo­\nraneously with its written denial. Instead, the City issued\nthose detailed minutes 26 days after the date of the writ­\nten denial and just 4 days before petitioner’s time to seek\njudicial review would have expired.7 The City therefore\ndid not comply with its statutory obligations. We do not\nconsider questions regarding the applicability of principles\nof harmless error or questions of remedy, and leave those\nfor the Eleventh Circuit to address on remand.\n                        *  *   *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment\nbelow and remand the case for further proceedings con­\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                       It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   7 Though petitioner arranged for a transcript of the meeting to be\n\nrecorded on its own initiative and at its own expense, see App. 109–275,\nthe fact that petitioner took steps to reduce oral statements made at\nthe City Council meeting to writing cannot be said to satisfy the obliga­\ntion that Congress placed on the City to state clearly its reasons, and to\ndo so in a writing it provides or makes available.\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

One such\nprinciple, as the Court explains, is the requirement that\nagencies give reasons. I write separately, however, be-\ncause three other traditional administrative law principles\nmay also apply.\n   First, a court must “uphold a decision of less than ideal\nclarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.”\nBowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System,\nInc., 419 U. S. 281, 286 (1974). In the context of 47\nU. S. C. §332(c)(7), which leaves in place almost the en-\ntirety of a local government’s authority, a succinct state-\nment that a permit has been denied because the tower\nwould be esthetically incompatible with the surrounding\narea should suffice. Nothing in this statute imposes an\nopinion-writing requirement.\n   Second, even if a locality has erred, a court must not\ninvalidate the locality’s decision if the error was harmless.\n“In administrative law, as in federal civil and criminal\nlitigation, there is a harmless error rule.” National Assn.\nof Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644,\n659–660 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here,\nfor instance, I have trouble believing that T-Mobile South,\n2        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nLLC—which actively participated in the decisionmaking\nprocess, including going so far as to transcribe the public\nhearing—was prejudiced by the city of Roswell’s delay in\nproviding a copy of the minutes.\n   Third, the ordinary rule in administrative law is that a\ncourt must remand errors to the agency “except in rare\ncircumstances.” Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470\nU. S. 729, 744 (1985). Nothing we say today should be\nread to suggest that when a locality has erred, the inevi-\ntable remedy is that a tower must be built. The Court has\nnot passed on what remedial powers a “court of competent\njurisdiction” may exercise. §332(c)(7)(B)(v). This unan-\nswered question is important given the federalism impli-\ncations of this statute.\n   I do not understand the Court’s opinion to disagree with\nthis analysis. On that understanding, I join the Court’s\nopinion.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            1\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

S. C. §332(c)(7)(B)(iii). The Court concludes\nthat the City loses this case not because it failed to provide\nits denial in writing. It did provide its denial in writing.\nNor does the City lose because the denial was not supported\nby substantial evidence in a written record. The City\ncompiled a written record; whether that record contained\nsubstantial evidence supporting the denial is not at issue\nhere and has not been decided. Nor does the City lose\nbecause its denial was not accompanied by a statement of\nreasons apart from the written record. A sharp conflict\nhad developed in the lower courts over the necessity of\nsuch a separate statement, and the Court today squarely\nholds that one is not required. Ante, at 5, 8–11. No, the\nCity instead loses because of a question of timing: The\nwritten record was not made available roughly the same\nday as the denial—a requirement found nowhere in the\ntext of the statute.\n   The Court says this timing requirement is necessary for\njudicial review of whether the denial is supported by\n2        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsubstantial evidence. A reviewing court, however, can\ncarry out its function just as easily whether the record is\nsubmitted four weeks or four days before the lawsuit is\nfiled—or four days after, for that matter. The Court also\nsupports its timing rule by saying that the company whose\napplication is denied needs the time to carefully consider\nwhether to seek review. But cell service providers are not\nMom and Pop operations. As this case illustrates, they\nparticipate extensively in the local government proceed-\nings, and do not have to make last-second, uninformed\ndecisions on whether to seek review.\n   The City here fully complied with its obligations under\nthe statute: It issued its decision in writing, and it sub-\nmitted a written record containing—so far as we know—\nsubstantial evidence supporting that decision. I respect-\nfully dissent from the Court’s contrary conclusion.\n                               I\n   Section 332(c)(7), enacted as part of the Telecommunica-\ntions Act of 1996, places several limits on local govern-\nments’ authority to regulate the siting of cell towers and\nother telecommunications facilities. A locality’s regula-\ntions must not unreasonably discriminate among service\nproviders, effectively prohibit the provision of service, or\nrest on concerns about the environmental effects of radio\nemissions. See §§332(c)(7)(B)(i), (iv). In addition, the\nprovision central to this case specifies that “[a]ny decision\nby a State or local government . . . to deny a request to\nplace, construct, or modify” a cell tower “shall be in writ-\ning and supported by substantial evidence contained in a\nwritten record.” §332(c)(7)(B)(iii). And another provision\nauthorizes expedited judicial review of a locality’s alleged\nfailure to comply with these rules. See §332(c)(7)(B)(v).\n   After the city council of Roswell voted to deny T-Mobile’s\napplication to build a cell tower, the City sent T-Mobile a\nshort letter that announced the denial but provided no\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)              3\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfurther explanation. The question T-Mobile has presented\nto this Court is whether such a letter satisfies the “deci-\nsion . . . in writing” requirement of Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).\nSee Pet. for Cert. i.\n   I would hold it does. The City’s letter was certainly in\nwriting. And it certainly memorialized the denial of T-\nMobile’s application. So T-Mobile’s only hope is that the\nlack of explanation for the denial means the letter is\nnot truly a “decision.” But like the majority, I reject T-\nMobile’s contention that the term “decision” inherently\ndemands a statement of reasons. Dictionary definitions\nsupport that conclusion. See ante, at 12 (citing Black’s\nLaw Dictionary); see also B. Garner, A Dictionary of Mod-\nern Legal Usage 251 (2d ed. 1995) (grouping “decision”\nwith “judgment,” as distinct from “opinion”).\n   A comparison between Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) and other\nstatutory provisions that were on the books in 1996 also\nsuggests that when Congress wants decisionmakers to\nsupply explanations, it says so. Consider first the Admin-\nistrative Procedure Act. In the context of formal adjudica-\ntion and rulemaking, it demands that “decisions . . . in-\nclude a statement of . . . findings and conclusions, and the\nreasons or basis therefor, on all the material issues.” 5\nU. S. C. §557(c)(A) (1994 ed.) (emphasis added). Even in\ninformal proceedings, an agency must give prompt notice\nof the denial of a written application, and, “[e]xcept in\naffirming a prior denial or when the denial is self-\nexplanatory, the notice shall be accompanied by a brief\nstatement of the grounds for denial.” §555(e) (emphasis\nadded).\n   The Communications Act of 1934, which the Telecom-\nmunications Act overhauled, itself contains a similar\nexpress requirement. Section 309 allows an interested\nparty to petition the Federal Communications Commission\nto deny a license application. 47 U. S. C. §309(d)(1) (1994\ned.). If the FCC decides to grant an application despite\n4        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsuch a petition, it must “issue a concise statement of the\nreasons for denying the petition.” §309(d)(2). And a pro-\nvision added along with Section 332(c)(7) in the Telecom-\nmunications Act provides that when the FCC grants or\ndenies a petition for regulatory forbearance, it “shall\nexplain its decision in writing.” §160(c) (2000 ed.) (empha-\nsis added). Many other statutes in effect in 1996 could be\nadded to the list. See, e.g., 19 U. S. C. §1515(a) (1994 ed.)\n(notice of customs protest denial “shall include a state-\nment of the reasons for the denial”); 30 U. S. C. §944 (1994\ned.) (individual whose claim for black lung benefits “is\ndenied shall receive . . . a written statement of the reasons\nfor denial”); 38 U. S. C. §5104(b) (1994 ed.) (notice of denial\nof veterans benefits must include “a statement of the\nreasons for the decision”).\n    Given the commonplace nature of express requirements\nthat reasons be given—and the inclusion of such provi-\nsions in the Administrative Procedure Act, the original\nCommunications Act, and another provision of the Tele-\ncommunications Act—the absence of one in Section\n332(c)(7)(B)(iii) is telling, and supports reading “decision\n. . . in writing” to demand nothing more than what it says:\na written document that communicates the town’s denial.\n    In my view, resolving that interpretive question in the\nCity’s favor also resolves the case as it stands in this\nCourt. Although Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) goes on to require\nthat a denial be “supported by substantial evidence con-\ntained in a written record,” the adequacy of the City’s\nwritten record is not properly before us. As the Eleventh\nCircuit noted in its opinion below, the “sole issue” before it\nwas the “in writing” requirement; it did not examine\nwhether the City’s denial was supported by substantial\nevidence. 731 F. 3d 1213, 1221, n. 7 (2013). The Court\ntoday also—correctly—does not decide whether substan-\ntial evidence supported the City’s denial. The Eleventh\nCircuit’s judgment therefore ought to be affirmed and the\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncase remanded to the District Court for further proceed-\nings on T-Mobile’s remaining challenges.\n                               II\n   The Court agrees that the City was not required to\nexplain its reasoning in its denial letter, but it nonetheless\nrules for T-Mobile. The improbable linchpin of this out-\ncome is the City’s failure to finalize the minutes of the\nApril 12 city council meeting until May 10. Improbable\nbecause, so far as I can tell, T-Mobile never even men-\ntioned this timeline, let alone based an argument on it, in\nits filings in the lower courts or its petition for certiorari.\nNor did the Eleventh Circuit address this timing question\nin any way. Cf. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (slip op., at 12) (“Ordinarily, we do not decide in the\nfirst instance issues not decided below.” (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)).\n   The Court nonetheless rules against Roswell on this\nground, proceeding in two steps: First it concludes that a\ntown must provide written reasons in some form (the\nminutes being the only candidate here); then it decides a\ntown must make those reasons available “essentially\ncontemporaneously” with its decision (the final minutes\nwere not). Ante, at 14. In my view, the first step is justi-\nfied by the statutory text, but the second is not.\n   The need to provide reasons in some form follows from\nthe portion of Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) requiring that deni-\nals be “supported by substantial evidence contained in a\nwritten record.” Like the majority, I read this phrase as\nspecifying a familiar standard of review to be used if a\ndenial is challenged in court. And like the majority, I\nagree that substantial evidence review requires that a\ndecisionmaker’s reasons be identifiable in the written\nrecord. If a reviewing court cannot identify any of a town’s\nreasons for denying an application, it cannot determine\nwhether substantial evidence supports those reasons, and\n6        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe town loses.\n  But then the Court goes a step further and creates a\ntiming rule: A town must provide “its written reasons at\nessentially the same time as it communicates its denial.”\nAnte, at 10. This timing rule is nowhere to be found in the\ntext of Section 332(c)(7)(B)—text that expressly establishes\nother time limits, both general and specific.            See\n§332(c)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring localities to act on siting re-\nquests “within a reasonable period of time”); §332(c)\n(7)(B)(v) (giving injured parties 30 days to seek judicial\nreview). Despite its assertion that the statute’s “enumer-\nated limitations” constitute “an exclusive list,” ante, at 9,\nthe Court offers two justifications for its inference of this\nadditional, unenumerated limitation.\n  The first is that “a court cannot review the denial with-\nout knowing the locality’s reasons,” so it would “stymie”\njudicial review to allow delay between the issuance of the\ndecision and the statement of reasons. Ante, at 10. This\nmakes little sense. The Court’s “essentially contempora-\nneous” requirement presumably means the town must\nproduce its reasons within a matter of days (though the\nmajority never says how many). But a reviewing court\ndoes not need to be able to discern the town’s reasons\nwithin mere days of the decision. At that point no one has\neven asked the court to review the denial. The fact that a\ncourt cannot conduct review without knowing the reasons\nsimply means that if the town has not already made the\nrecord available, it must do so by whatever deadline the\ncourt sets. The court should proceed “on an expedited\nbasis,” §332(c)(7)(B)(v), but that hardly means it will need\nthe record within days of the town’s decision. And in this\ncase there is no indication that the City’s submission of\nthe written record was untimely or delayed the District\nCourt’s review.\n  The Court’s second justification focuses on the denied\napplicant, which must choose within 30 days from the\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

J., dissenting\n\ndenial whether to take the town to court. §332(c)(7)(B)(v).\n“[W]ithout knowing the locality’s reasons,” the majority\nsays, the applicant “may not be able to make a considered\ndecision whether to seek judicial review.” Ante, at 10.\nThis concern might have force if towns routinely made\nthese decisions in secret, closed-door proceedings, or if\napplicants were unsophisticated actors. But the local\nzoning board or town council is not the Star Chamber, and\na telecommunications company is no babe in the legal\nwoods. Almost invariably in cases addressing Section\n332(c)(7), the relevant local authority has held an open\nmeeting at which the applicant was present and the issues\npublicly aired. In this case and others, T-Mobile has\nbrought its own court reporter, ensuring that it has a\nverbatim transcript of the meeting well before the town is\nlikely to finalize its minutes. See Brief for Petitioner 12,\nn. 2; T-Mobile South, LLC v. City of Milton, Georgia, 728\nF. 3d 1274, 1277 (CA11 2013). I strongly doubt that a\nsophisticated, well-lawyered company like T-Mobile—with\nextensive experience with these particular types of pro-\nceedings—would have any trouble consulting its interests\nand deciding whether to seek review before it had received\na written explanation from the town. The Court worries\nabout towns “sandbagg[ing]” companies with unexpected\nreasons, ante, at 10, n. 3, but if those reasons in fact come\nout of nowhere, they will not be supported by substantial\nevidence in the record. And if the company’s initial com-\nplaint mistakes the town’s reasoning, the company will\nhave no difficulty amending its allegations. See Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 15(a).\n   In sum, there is nothing impractical about reading the\nstatutory text to require only that the reasons implied by\nthe term “substantial evidence” be discernible to the court\nwhen it conducts substantial evidence review. Demanding\n“essentially contemporaneous” written reasons adds a\nrequirement that Congress has included expressly in\n8        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nmany other statutes, but not in this one. See supra, at\n3–4.\n                          *    *    *\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court’s opinion and\njudgment are wrong. But this is not a “the sky is falling”\ndissent. At the end of the day, the impact on cities and\ntowns across the Nation should be small, although the\nnew unwritten requirement could be a trap for the unwary\nhamlet or two. All a local government need do is withhold\nits final decision until the minutes are typed up, and make\nthe final decision and the record of proceedings (with\ndiscernible reasons) available together.\n   Today’s decision is nonetheless a bad break for Roswell.\nOr maybe not. The Court leaves open the question of\nremedy, ante, at 14, and it may be that failure to comply\nwith the “in writing” requirement as construed by the\nCourt can be excused as harmless error in appropriate\ncases. It is hard to see where the harm is here. T-Mobile\nsomehow managed to make the tough call to seek review\nof the denial of an application it had spent months and\nmany thousands of dollars to obtain, based on a hearing it\nhad attended. And nothing about Roswell’s failure to meet\nthe “contemporaneously” requirement delayed, much less\n“stymied,” judicial review.\n   The Court today resolves the conflict over whether a\ntown must provide a statement of reasons with its final\ndecision, apart from the written record. We now know it\nneed not. As the Court explains, “nothing in [the] text [of\nthe Act] imposes any requirement that the reasons be\ngiven in any particular form,” and there is “in the Act no\ncommand—either explicit or implicit—that localities must\nprovide those reasons in a specific document.” Ante, at 9.\nGood analysis—which also should have been followed to\nreject the timing requirement the Court creates today.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

I write\nseparately to express my concern about the Court’s eager-\nness to reach beyond the bounds of the present dispute to\ncreate a timing requirement that finds no support in the\ntext or structure of the statute. We have been unwilling to\nimpose procedural requirements on federal agencies in the\nabsence of statutory command, even while recognizing\nthat an agency’s failure to make its decisions known at the\ntime it acts may burden regulated parties. See, e.g., Pen-\nsion Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S.\n633, 653–655 (1990). When a State vests its municipali-\nties with authority to exercise a core state power, those\nmunicipalities deserve at least as much respect as a fed-\neral agency. But today, the majority treats them as less\nthan conscripts in “the national bureaucratic army,”\nFERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.

Argued November 10, 2014—Decided January 14, 2015\nRespondent Roswell’s city council (Council) held a public hearing to\n  consider an application by petitioner T-Mobile South, LLC, to build a\n  cell phone tower on residential property. During the hearing, several\n  Council members expressed concerns about the tower’s impact on the\n  area. The hearing ended with the Council unanimously passing a\n  motion to deny the application. Two days later, the City’s Planning\n  and Zoning Division informed petitioner by letter that the application\n  had been denied and that minutes from the hearing would be made\n  available. The detailed minutes were published 26 days later.\n    Petitioner filed suit, alleging that the Council’s denial was not sup-\n  ported by substantial evidence in the record. The District Court\n  agreed, concluding that the City, by failing to issue a written decision\n  stating its reasons for denying the application, had violated the Tele-\n  communications Act of 1996, which provides that a locality’s denial\n  “shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained\n  in a written record,” 47 U. S. C. §332(c)(7)(B)(iii). The Eleventh Cir-\n  cuit, following its precedent, found that the Act’s requirements were\n  satisfied here because petitioner had received a denial letter and pos-\n  sessed a transcript of the hearing that it arranged to have recorded.\nHeld:\n    1. Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) requires localities to provide reasons\n when they deny applications to build cell phone towers. This conclu-\n sion follows from the Act’s provisions, which both preserve and specif-\n ically limit traditional state and local government authority. It\n would be considerably difficult for a reviewing court to determine\n whether a locality’s denial was “supported by substantial evidence\n contained in a written record,” §332(c)(7)(B)(iii), or whether a locality\n2            T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    had “unreasonably discriminate[d] among providers of functionally\n    equivalent services,” §332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), or regulated siting “on the ba-\n    sis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions,”\n    §332(c)(7)(B)(iv), if localities were not obligated to state their reasons\n    for denial. And nothing in the Act suggests that Congress meant to\n    use the phrase “substantial evidence” as anything but an administra-\n    tive law “term of art” that describes how “an administrative record is\n    to be judged by a reviewing court.” United States v. Carlo Bianchi &\n    Co., 373 U. S. 709, 715. Pp. 6–8.\n       2. Localities are not required to provide their reasons for denying\n    siting applications in the denial notice itself, but may state those rea-\n    sons with sufficient clarity in some other written record issued essen-\n    tially contemporaneously with the denial. Pp. 8–13.\n          (a) Nothing in the Act’s text imposes a requirement that the rea-\n    sons be given in any particular form, and the Act’s saving clause,\n    §332(c)(7)(A), makes clear that the only limitations imposed on local\n    governments are those enumerated in the statute. Localities comply\n    with their obligation to give written reasons so long as those reasons\n    are stated clearly enough to enable judicial review. Because an ad-\n    versely affected entity must decide whether to seek judicial review\n    within 30 days from the date of the denial, §332(c)(7)(B)(v), and be-\n    cause a court cannot review the denial without knowing the locality’s\n    reasons, the locality must provide or make available its written rea-\n    sons at essentially the same time as it communicates its denial.\n    Pp. 8–11.\n          (b) Petitioner’s contrary arguments are unavailing. The statute’s\n    word “decision” does not connote a written document that itself pro-\n    vides all the reasons for a given judgment. The absence of the word\n    “notify” in the provision at issue also does not signal an intention to\n    require communication of more than a judgment. Nor does an obliga-\n    tion to provide reasons in the writing conveying the denial arise from\n    the “substantial evidence” requirement itself or from the requirement\n    of court review “on an expedited basis,” §332(c)(7)(B)(v). It is suffi-\n    cient that a locality’s reasons be provided in a manner that is clear\n    enough and prompt enough to enable judicial review. Pp. 11–13.\n       3. The City failed to comply with its statutory obligations under the\n    Act. Although it issued its reasons in writing and did so in an ac-\n    ceptable form, it did not provide its written reasons essentially con-\n    temporaneously with its written denial when it issued detailed\n    minutes 26 days after the date of the written denial and 4 days before\n    expiration of petitioner’s time to seek judicial review.

S. C.\n§332(c)(7)(B)(iii). The question presented is whether, and\nin what form, localities must provide reasons when they\ndeny telecommunication companies’ applications to con­\nstruct cell phone towers. We hold that localities must\nprovide or make available their reasons, but that those\nreasons need not appear in the written denial letter or\nnotice provided by the locality. Instead, the locality’s\nreasons may appear in some other written record so long\nas the reasons are sufficiently clear and are provided or\nmade accessible to the applicant essentially contempora­\nneously with the written denial letter or notice.\n                           I\n  In February 2010, petitioner T-Mobile South, LLC,\napplied to build a new, 108-foot-tall cell phone tower on\n2        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n2.8 acres of vacant residential property in the city of Ros-\nwell, Georgia (City). Roswell’s city ordinances require\nthat any cell phone tower proposed for a residential zoning\ndistrict must take the form of an “alternative tower struc­\nture”—an artificial tree, clock tower, steeple, or light\npole—that, in the opinion of the city council (City Council\nor Council), is “compatible with the natural setting and\nsurrounding structures” and that effectively camouflages\nthe tower. Code of Ordinances §§21.2.2, 21.2.5(a); see\nApp. 68, 75. In accordance with these provisions, petition­\ner’s application proposed a structure in the shape of an\nartificial tree or “monopine.” Id., at 42.\n   The City’s Planning and Zoning Division reviewed peti­\ntioner’s application, along with a substantial number of\nletters and petitions opposing it, and ultimately issued a\nmemorandum to the City Council concluding that the\napplication met all of the requirements set out in the\nCity’s ordinances. It recommended that the City Council\napprove the application on three conditions to which peti­\ntioner was prepared to agree.\n   The City Council then held a 2-hour-long public hearing\non April 12, 2010, to consider petitioner’s application.\nPetitioner arranged privately to have the hearing tran­\nscribed, and, as discussed below, the City subsequently\nissued detailed minutes summarizing the proceedings. At\nthe hearing, after the Planning and Zoning Division pre­\nsented its recommendation and after petitioner’s repre­\nsentatives made a presentation in support of the applica­\ntion, a number of residents raised concerns. Among these\nwere concerns that the tower would lack aesthetic compat­\nibility, that the technology was outdated and unnecessary,\nand that the tower would be too tall. Petitioner’s repre­\nsentatives responded by reiterating that it had met all of\nthe ordinance’s requirements and by providing testimony\nfrom a property appraiser that placement of cell phone\ntowers does not reduce property values.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Members of the City Council then commented on the\napplication. One member of the six-person Council was\nrecused, see id., at 111 (hearing transcript); id., at 322\n(meeting minutes), leaving five voting members. Member\nIgleheart said that other carriers had sufficient coverage\nin the area and that the City did not need to level the\nplaying field for petitioner. Id., at 173–174 (hearing tran­\nscript). He also stated that his “[b]ottom line” was that he\ndid not think it was “appropriate for residentially zoned\nproperties to have the cell towers in their location.” Id., at\n174 (hearing transcript); id., at 338 (meeting minutes).\nMember Dippolito found it difficult to believe that the\ntower would not negatively impact the area and doubted\nthat it would be compatible with the natural setting. Id.,\nat 175–176 (hearing transcript); id., at 339 (meeting\nminutes). Member Wynn expressed concerns about the\nlack of a backup generator for emergency services, id., at\n172 (hearing transcript), and did not think the tower\nwould be “compatible with this area,” id., at 176 (hearing\ntranscript); id., at 339 (meeting minutes). Member Orlans\nsaid only that he was impressed with the information put\ntogether by both sides. Id., at 173 (hearing transcript); id.,\nat 337 (meeting minutes). Finally, Member Price, the\nliaison to the Planning and Zoning Division, made a mo­\ntion to deny the application. She said that the tower\nwould be aesthetically incompatible with the natural\nsetting, that it would be too tall, and that its proximity to\nother homes would adversely affect the neighbors and the\nresale value of their properties. Id., at 176–177 (hearing\ntranscript); id., at 339–340 (meeting minutes). The mo­\ntion was seconded, and then passed unanimously. Id., at\n177 (hearing transcript); id., at 340 (meeting minutes).\n   Two days later, on April 14, 2010, the Planning and\nZoning Division sent a letter to petitioner that said in its\nentirety:\n4          T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v.

See id., at 321–341 (meeting\nminutes).1\n  On May 13, 2010, 3 days after the detailed minutes\nwere published—and now 29 days after the City denied\npetitioner’s application—petitioner filed suit in Federal\nDistrict Court. It alleged that the denial of the application\nwas not supported by substantial evidence in the record,\nand would effectively prohibit the provision of wireless\nservice in violation of the Telecommunications Act of\n1996 (Act). The parties filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment.\n  The District Court granted petitioner’s motion for sum­\nmary judgment, concluding that the City had violated the\n\n——————\n  1 Brief minutes had been adopted on April 19, but these only noted\n\nthat the motion to deny the application had passed with five members\nin favor and one member recused.

The\nDistrict Court interpreted the Act to require that a written\ndenial letter or notice describe the reasons for the denial\nand that those reasons be sufficiently explained to allow a\nreviewing court to evaluate them against the written\nrecord.\n   The Eleventh Circuit reversed. 731 F. 3d 1213 (2013).\nIt explained that, in T-Mobile South, LLC v. Milton, 728\nF. 3d 1274 (2013), which was decided after the District\nCourt’s decision in this case, it had held that “to the extent\nthat the decision must contain grounds or reasons or\nexplanations, it is sufficient if those are contained in a\ndifferent written document or documents that the appli­\ncant is given or has access to.” Id., at 1285. The Eleventh\nCircuit acknowledged that the Courts of Appeals had split\non that question, and that it had departed from the major­\nity rule. Compare Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc.\nv. Todd, 244 F. 3d 51, 60 (CA1 2001) (requiring that a\nlocality issue a written denial that itself contains a “suffi­\ncient explanation of the reasons for the permit denial to\nallow a reviewing court to evaluate the evidence in the\nrecord supporting those reasons”); New Par v.

Applying its rule to this case, the Eleventh\nCircuit found that the requirements of 47 U. S. C.\n§332(c)(7)(B)(iii) were satisfied because petitioner had its\nown transcript as well as a written letter stating that the\napplication had been denied and informing petitioner that\nit could obtain access to the minutes of the hearing. 731\nF. 3d, at 1221.

S. ___ (2014), and now\nreverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  The first question we answer is whether the statute\nrequires localities to provide reasons when they deny\napplications to build cell phone towers. We answer that\nquestion in the affirmative.\n  Our conclusion follows from the provisions of the Tele­\ncommunications Act. The Act generally preserves “the\ntraditional authority of state and local governments to\nregulate the location, construction, and modification” of\nwireless communications facilities like cell phone towers,\nbut imposes “specific limitations” on that authority. Ran-\ncho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U. S. 113, 115 (2005); see\n§332(c)(7)(B). One of those limitations is that any decision\nto deny a request to build a tower “shall be in writing and\nsupported by substantial evidence contained in a written\nrecord.” §332(c)(7)(B)(iii). Another is that parties adversely\naffected by a locality’s decision may seek judicial review.\n§332(c)(7)(B)(v). In order to determine whether a locality’s\ndenial was supported by substantial evidence, as Congress\ndirected, courts must be able to identify the reason or\nreasons why the locality denied the application. See Ran-\ncho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 128 (BREYER, J., joined by\nO’Connor, Souter, and GINSBURG, JJ., concurring) (observ­\ning that the Act “requires local zoning boards . . . [to] give\nreasons for [their] denials ‘in writing’ ”).\n  The requirement that localities must provide reasons\nwhen they deny applications is further underscored by two\nof the other limitations on local authority set out in the\nAct. The Act provides that localities “shall not unreason-\nably discriminate among providers of functionally equiva­\nlent services,” and may not regulate the construction of\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npersonal wireless service facilities “on the basis of the\nenvironmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the\nextent that such facilities comply with the [Federal Com­\nmunications Commission’s] regulations concerning such\nemissions.” §§332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), (iv).2 Again, it would be\nconsiderably more difficult for a reviewing court to deter­\nmine whether a locality had violated these substantive\nprovisions if the locality were not obligated to state its\nreasons.\n   This conclusion is not just commonsensical, but flows\ndirectly from Congress’ use of the term “substantial evi­\ndence.” The statutory phrase “substantial evidence” is a\n“term of art” in administrative law that describes how “an\nadministrative record is to be judged by a reviewing\ncourt.” United States v. Carlo Bianchi & Co., 373 U. S.\n709, 715 (1963). There is no reason discernible from the\ntext of the Act to think that Congress meant to use the\nphrase in a different way. See FAA v. Cooper, 566 U. S.\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (“[W]hen Congress employs a\nterm of art, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of\nideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the\nbody of learning from which it was taken” (internal quota­\ntion marks omitted)). Indeed, for those who consider\nlegislative history relevant, the Conference Report accom­\npanying the Act confirmed as much when it noted that\n“[t]he phrase ‘substantial evidence contained in a written\nrecord’ is the traditional standard used for review of agency\nactions.” H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104–458, p. 208 (1996).\n   By employing the term “substantial evidence,” Congress\nthus invoked, among other things, our recognition that\n“the orderly functioning of the process of [substantial­\n——————\n  2 The last “limitation” listed in the Act provides that localities shall\n\nact on applications to construct personal wireless service facilities\n“within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed . . .\ntaking into account the nature and scope of such request.”\n§332(c)(7)(B)(ii).\n8        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nevidence] review requires that the grounds upon which the\nadministrative agency acted be clearly disclosed,” and that\n“courts cannot exercise their duty of [substantial-evidence]\nreview unless they are advised of the considerations un­\nderlying the action under review.” SEC v. Chenery Corp.,\n318 U. S. 80, 94 (1943); see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn.\nof United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins.\nCo., 463 U. S. 29, 43 (1983) (explaining that an agency\nmust “articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action”\nto enable substantial-evidence review); Beaumont, S. L. &\nW. R. Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 74, 86 (1930) (“Com­\nplete statements by the [agency] showing the grounds\nupon which its determinations rest are quite as necessary\nas are opinions of lower courts setting forth the reasons on\nwhich they base their decisions . . .”).\n   In response, the City primarily argues that a reason-\ngiving obligation would deprive it of local zoning author-\nity. But Congress intended to place “specific limitations on\nthe traditional authority of state and local governments”\nregarding cell phone tower siting applications. Rancho\nPalos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 115. One of those “limitations,”\n§332(c)(7)(B), necessarily implied by the Act’s “substantial\nevidence” requirement, is that local zoning authorities\nstate their reasons when they deny applications.\n   In short, the statutory text and structure, and the con­\ncepts that Congress imported into the statutory frame­\nwork, all point clearly toward the conclusion that localities\nmust provide reasons when they deny cell phone tower\nsiting applications. We stress, however, that these rea­\nsons need not be elaborate or even sophisticated, but\nrather, as discussed below, simply clear enough to enable\njudicial review.\n                          B\n  The second question we answer is whether these rea­\nsons must appear in the same writing that conveys the\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlocality’s denial of an application. We answer that ques­\ntion in the negative.\n   Like our conclusion that localities must provide reasons,\nour conclusion that the reasons need not appear in a de-\nnial letter follows from the statutory text. Other than\nproviding that a locality’s reasons must be given in writ­\ning, nothing in that text imposes any requirement that the\nreasons be given in any particular form.\n   The Act’s saving clause makes clear that, other than the\nenumerated limitations imposed on local governments by\nthe statute itself, “nothing in this chapter shall limit or\naffect the authority of a State or local government or\ninstrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the\nplacement, construction, and modification of personal\nwireless service facilities.” §332(c)(7)(A). Given this lan­\nguage, and the system of “cooperative federalism” on\nwhich the Act is premised, Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S.,\nat 128 (BREYER, J., concurring), we understand the enu­\nmerated limitations to set out an exclusive list. So while\nthe text and structure of the Act render it inescapable that\nlocalities must provide reasons in writing when they deny\napplications, we can locate in the Act no command—either\nexplicit or implicit—that localities must provide those\nreasons in a specific document.\n   We therefore conclude that Congress imposed no specific\nrequirement on that front, but instead permitted localities\nto comply with their obligation to give written reasons so\nlong as the locality’s reasons are stated clearly enough to\nenable judicial review. Although the statute does not\nrequire a locality to provide its written reasons in any\nparticular format, and although a locality may rely on\ndetailed meeting minutes as it did here, we agree with the\nSolicitor General that “the local government may be better\nserved by including a separate statement containing its\nreasons.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26; see\nalso id., at 34. If the locality writes a short statement\n10         T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nproviding its reasons, the locality can likely avoid prolong­\ning the litigation—and adding expense to the taxpayers,\nthe companies, and the legal system—while the parties\nargue about exactly what the sometimes voluminous\nrecord means. Moreover, in that circumstance, the locality\nneed not worry that, upon review of the record, a court will\neither find that it could not ascertain the locality’s reasons\nor mistakenly ascribe to the locality a rationale that was\nnot in fact the reason for the locality’s denial.\n  We hasten to add that a locality cannot stymie or bur­\nden the judicial review contemplated by the statute by\ndelaying the release of its reasons for a substantial time\nafter it conveys its written denial. The statute provides\nthat an entity adversely affected by a locality’s decision\nmay seek judicial review within 30 days of the decision.\n§332(c)(7)(B)(v). Because an entity may not be able to\nmake a considered decision whether to seek judicial re­\nview without knowing the reasons for the denial of its\napplication, and because a court cannot review the denial\nwithout knowing the locality’s reasons, the locality must\nprovide or make available its written reasons at essentially\nthe same time as it communicates its denial.3\n——————\n   3 THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent rejects this particular requirement, and\n\ninstead invents a process that turns judicial review on its head. Rather\nthan give effect to a process that would permit an entity seeking to\nchallenge a locality’s decision to see the locality’s written reasons before\nit files its suit—and the dissent agrees that the statute requires that a\nlocality convey its reasons in writing, see post, at 5—the dissent would\nfashion a world in which a locality can wait until a lawsuit is com­\nmenced and a court orders it to state its reasons. The entity would thus\nbe left to guess at what the locality’s written reasons will be, write a\ncomplaint that contains those hypotheses, and risk being sandbagged\nby the written reasons that the locality subsequently provides in\nlitigation after the challenging entity has shown its cards. The review­\ning court would then need to ensure that those reasons are not post hoc\nrationalizations, see Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371\nU. S. 156, 168 (1962), but the dissent offers no guidance as to how a\nreviewing court that has never seen near-contemporaneous reasons\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   This rule ought not to unduly burden localities given the\nrange of ways in which localities can provide their rea­\nsons. Moreover, the denial itself needs only to be issued\n(or the application otherwise acted upon) “within a rea­\nsonable period of time.” §332(c)(7)(B)(ii). In an interpre­\ntation we have recently upheld, see Arlington v. FCC, 569\nU. S. ___ (2013), the Federal Communications Commission\n(FCC) has generally interpreted this provision to allow\nlocalities 90 days to act on applications to place new an­\ntennas on existing towers and 150 days to act on other\nsiting applications. In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling to\nClarify Provisions of Section 332(c)(7)(b), 24 FCC Rcd.\n13994, 13995, ¶4 (2009). If a locality is not in a position to\nprovide its reasons promptly, the locality can delay the\nissuance of its denial within this 90- or 150-day window,\nand instead release it along with its reasons once those\nreasons are ready to be provided. Only once the denial is\nissued would the 30-day commencement-of-suit clock\nbegin.4\n                             III\n  Petitioner offers four reasons why, in its view, our anal­\nysis in Part II–B is incorrect. Petitioner argues that the\nstatute requires that a locality’s reasons appear in the\nwriting conveying the denial itself, but none of petitioner’s\n——————\nwould conduct that inquiry.\n   4 The City urges us to hold that the clock does not begin to run until\n\nafter the reasons are given. We cannot so hold, however, without\nrewriting the statutory text. The Act provides that a lawsuit may be\nfiled by “[a]ny person adversely affected by any final action or failure to\nact . . . within 30 days after such action or failure to act.” 47 U. S. C.\n§332(c)(7)(B)(v). The relevant “final action” is the issuance of the\nwritten notice of denial, not the subsequent issuance of reasons ex­\nplaining the denial. See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 177–178\n(1997) (agency action is “final” if it “mark[s] the consummation of the\nagency’s decisionmaking process” and determines “rights or obligations”\nor triggers “legal consequences” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n12         T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nreasons are persuasive.\n  First, petitioner argues that the word “decision” in the\nstatute—the thing that must be “in writing”—connotes a\nwritten document that itself provides all the reasons for a\ngiven judgment. See Brief for Petitioner 24 (quoting\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 407 (6th ed. 1990) (a “decision” is a\nwritten document providing “ ‘the reasons given for [a]\njudgment’ ”)). But even petitioner concedes, with its pre­\nferred dictionary in hand, that the word “decision” can also\nmean “something short of a statement of reasons explain­\ning a determination.” Brief for Petitioner 24 (citing\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, at 407).5\n  Second, petitioner claims that other provisions in the\nAct use the word “notify” when the Act means to impose\nonly a requirement that a judgment be communicated.6\nBecause the provision at issue here does not use the word\n“notify,” petitioner argues, it must contemplate something\n——————\n  5 One of petitioner’s amici argues that Congress has used the word\n\n“decision” in the context of other communications laws to mean some­\nthing more than a judgment or verdict. See Brief for Chamber of\nCommerce of the United States of America (Chamber) et al. 9–13. But\nwhile it is true that a word used across “the same act” should be given\nthe same meaning, see Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd., 566 U. S.\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10), the Chamber’s evidence is less persua­\nsive because it arises out of entirely different “acts” and does not\ninvolve any term of art. By relying on other parts of Title 47 of the\nU. S. Code—some enacted in the Communications Act of 1934 decades\nbefore the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 at issue\nhere—the Chamber stretches to invoke this canon of construction\nbeyond its most forceful application. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Read­\ning Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 172–173 (2012).\n  6 For example, petitioner cites §11 (FCC must “notify the parties\n\nconcerned” when it makes a “determination and order” regarding a rail-\nroad or telegraph company’s failure to maintain and operate a tele­\ngraph line for public use) and §398(b)(5) (“Whenever the Secretary [of\nCommerce] makes a final determination . . . that a recipient” of federal\nfunds has engaged in impermissible discrimination, the Secretary shall\n“notify the recipient in writing of such determination . . .”). Brief for\nPetitioner 24–25.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmore than a judgment. This does not logically follow. For\none thing, the statute at issue here does not use any verb\nat all to describe the conveying of information from a\nlocality to an applicant; it just says that a denial “shall be\nin writing and supported by substantial evidence con­\ntained in a written record.” §332(c)(7)(B)(iii). But more to\nthe point, “notify” is a verb the use—or nonuse—of which\ndoes not reveal what the thing to be notified of or about is.\n   Third, petitioner contends that the “substantial evi­\ndence” requirement itself demands that localities identify\ntheir reasons in their written denials. See Brief for Peti­\ntioner 23. Certainly, as discussed above, the phrase “sub­\nstantial evidence” requires localities to give reasons, but it\nsays nothing on its own about the document in which\nthose reasons must be stated or presented to a reviewing\ncourt.\n   Finally, petitioner invokes the statutory requirement\nthat any adversely affected person shall have their chal­\nlenge heard by a court “on an expedited basis.”\n§332(c)(7)(B)(v). See Brief for Petitioner 14–15, 28. As\nlong as the reasons are provided in a written record, how­\never, and as long as they are provided in such a manner\nthat is clear enough and prompt enough to enable judicial\nreview, there is no reason to require that those reasons be\nprovided in the written denial itself.\n   We acknowledge that petitioner, along with those\nCourts of Appeals that have required a locality’s reasons\nto appear in its written denial itself, have offered plausible\nbases for a rule that would require as much. See, e.g.,\nTodd, 244 F. 3d, at 60 (“A written record can create diffi­\nculties in determining the rationale behind a board’s\ndecision . . .”). Congress could adopt such a rule if it were\nso inclined, but it did not do so in this statute. It is not\nour place to legislate another approach.\n14         T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               IV\n   Thus, we hold that the Act requires localities to provide\nreasons when they deny cell phone tower siting applica­\ntions, but that the Act does not require localities to pro­\nvide those reasons in written denial letters or notices\nthemselves. A locality may satisfy its statutory obliga­\ntions if it states its reasons with sufficient clarity in some\nother written record issued essentially contemporaneously\nwith the denial. In this case, the City provided its reasons\nin writing and did so in the acceptable form of detailed\nminutes of the City Council meeting. The City, however,\ndid not provide its written reasons essentially contempo­\nraneously with its written denial. Instead, the City issued\nthose detailed minutes 26 days after the date of the writ­\nten denial and just 4 days before petitioner’s time to seek\njudicial review would have expired.7 The City therefore\ndid not comply with its statutory obligations. We do not\nconsider questions regarding the applicability of principles\nof harmless error or questions of remedy, and leave those\nfor the Eleventh Circuit to address on remand.\n                        *  *   *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment\nbelow and remand the case for further proceedings con­\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                       It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   7 Though petitioner arranged for a transcript of the meeting to be\n\nrecorded on its own initiative and at its own expense, see App. 109–275,\nthe fact that petitioner took steps to reduce oral statements made at\nthe City Council meeting to writing cannot be said to satisfy the obliga­\ntion that Congress placed on the City to state clearly its reasons, and to\ndo so in a writing it provides or makes available.\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

One such\nprinciple, as the Court explains, is the requirement that\nagencies give reasons. I write separately, however, be-\ncause three other traditional administrative law principles\nmay also apply.\n   First, a court must “uphold a decision of less than ideal\nclarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.”\nBowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System,\nInc., 419 U. S. 281, 286 (1974). In the context of 47\nU. S. C. §332(c)(7), which leaves in place almost the en-\ntirety of a local government’s authority, a succinct state-\nment that a permit has been denied because the tower\nwould be esthetically incompatible with the surrounding\narea should suffice. Nothing in this statute imposes an\nopinion-writing requirement.\n   Second, even if a locality has erred, a court must not\ninvalidate the locality’s decision if the error was harmless.\n“In administrative law, as in federal civil and criminal\nlitigation, there is a harmless error rule.” National Assn.\nof Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644,\n659–660 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here,\nfor instance, I have trouble believing that T-Mobile South,\n2        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nLLC—which actively participated in the decisionmaking\nprocess, including going so far as to transcribe the public\nhearing—was prejudiced by the city of Roswell’s delay in\nproviding a copy of the minutes.\n   Third, the ordinary rule in administrative law is that a\ncourt must remand errors to the agency “except in rare\ncircumstances.” Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470\nU. S. 729, 744 (1985). Nothing we say today should be\nread to suggest that when a locality has erred, the inevi-\ntable remedy is that a tower must be built. The Court has\nnot passed on what remedial powers a “court of competent\njurisdiction” may exercise. §332(c)(7)(B)(v). This unan-\nswered question is important given the federalism impli-\ncations of this statute.\n   I do not understand the Court’s opinion to disagree with\nthis analysis. On that understanding, I join the Court’s\nopinion.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            1\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

S. C. §332(c)(7)(B)(iii). The Court concludes\nthat the City loses this case not because it failed to provide\nits denial in writing. It did provide its denial in writing.\nNor does the City lose because the denial was not supported\nby substantial evidence in a written record. The City\ncompiled a written record; whether that record contained\nsubstantial evidence supporting the denial is not at issue\nhere and has not been decided. Nor does the City lose\nbecause its denial was not accompanied by a statement of\nreasons apart from the written record. A sharp conflict\nhad developed in the lower courts over the necessity of\nsuch a separate statement, and the Court today squarely\nholds that one is not required. Ante, at 5, 8–11. No, the\nCity instead loses because of a question of timing: The\nwritten record was not made available roughly the same\nday as the denial—a requirement found nowhere in the\ntext of the statute.\n   The Court says this timing requirement is necessary for\njudicial review of whether the denial is supported by\n2        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsubstantial evidence. A reviewing court, however, can\ncarry out its function just as easily whether the record is\nsubmitted four weeks or four days before the lawsuit is\nfiled—or four days after, for that matter. The Court also\nsupports its timing rule by saying that the company whose\napplication is denied needs the time to carefully consider\nwhether to seek review. But cell service providers are not\nMom and Pop operations. As this case illustrates, they\nparticipate extensively in the local government proceed-\nings, and do not have to make last-second, uninformed\ndecisions on whether to seek review.\n   The City here fully complied with its obligations under\nthe statute: It issued its decision in writing, and it sub-\nmitted a written record containing—so far as we know—\nsubstantial evidence supporting that decision. I respect-\nfully dissent from the Court’s contrary conclusion.\n                               I\n   Section 332(c)(7), enacted as part of the Telecommunica-\ntions Act of 1996, places several limits on local govern-\nments’ authority to regulate the siting of cell towers and\nother telecommunications facilities. A locality’s regula-\ntions must not unreasonably discriminate among service\nproviders, effectively prohibit the provision of service, or\nrest on concerns about the environmental effects of radio\nemissions. See §§332(c)(7)(B)(i), (iv). In addition, the\nprovision central to this case specifies that “[a]ny decision\nby a State or local government . . . to deny a request to\nplace, construct, or modify” a cell tower “shall be in writ-\ning and supported by substantial evidence contained in a\nwritten record.” §332(c)(7)(B)(iii). And another provision\nauthorizes expedited judicial review of a locality’s alleged\nfailure to comply with these rules. See §332(c)(7)(B)(v).\n   After the city council of Roswell voted to deny T-Mobile’s\napplication to build a cell tower, the City sent T-Mobile a\nshort letter that announced the denial but provided no\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)              3\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfurther explanation. The question T-Mobile has presented\nto this Court is whether such a letter satisfies the “deci-\nsion . . . in writing” requirement of Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).\nSee Pet. for Cert. i.\n   I would hold it does. The City’s letter was certainly in\nwriting. And it certainly memorialized the denial of T-\nMobile’s application. So T-Mobile’s only hope is that the\nlack of explanation for the denial means the letter is\nnot truly a “decision.” But like the majority, I reject T-\nMobile’s contention that the term “decision” inherently\ndemands a statement of reasons. Dictionary definitions\nsupport that conclusion. See ante, at 12 (citing Black’s\nLaw Dictionary); see also B. Garner, A Dictionary of Mod-\nern Legal Usage 251 (2d ed. 1995) (grouping “decision”\nwith “judgment,” as distinct from “opinion”).\n   A comparison between Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) and other\nstatutory provisions that were on the books in 1996 also\nsuggests that when Congress wants decisionmakers to\nsupply explanations, it says so. Consider first the Admin-\nistrative Procedure Act. In the context of formal adjudica-\ntion and rulemaking, it demands that “decisions . . . in-\nclude a statement of . . . findings and conclusions, and the\nreasons or basis therefor, on all the material issues.” 5\nU. S. C. §557(c)(A) (1994 ed.) (emphasis added). Even in\ninformal proceedings, an agency must give prompt notice\nof the denial of a written application, and, “[e]xcept in\naffirming a prior denial or when the denial is self-\nexplanatory, the notice shall be accompanied by a brief\nstatement of the grounds for denial.” §555(e) (emphasis\nadded).\n   The Communications Act of 1934, which the Telecom-\nmunications Act overhauled, itself contains a similar\nexpress requirement. Section 309 allows an interested\nparty to petition the Federal Communications Commission\nto deny a license application. 47 U. S. C. §309(d)(1) (1994\ned.). If the FCC decides to grant an application despite\n4        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsuch a petition, it must “issue a concise statement of the\nreasons for denying the petition.” §309(d)(2). And a pro-\nvision added along with Section 332(c)(7) in the Telecom-\nmunications Act provides that when the FCC grants or\ndenies a petition for regulatory forbearance, it “shall\nexplain its decision in writing.” §160(c) (2000 ed.) (empha-\nsis added). Many other statutes in effect in 1996 could be\nadded to the list. See, e.g., 19 U. S. C. §1515(a) (1994 ed.)\n(notice of customs protest denial “shall include a state-\nment of the reasons for the denial”); 30 U. S. C. §944 (1994\ned.) (individual whose claim for black lung benefits “is\ndenied shall receive . . . a written statement of the reasons\nfor denial”); 38 U. S. C. §5104(b) (1994 ed.) (notice of denial\nof veterans benefits must include “a statement of the\nreasons for the decision”).\n    Given the commonplace nature of express requirements\nthat reasons be given—and the inclusion of such provi-\nsions in the Administrative Procedure Act, the original\nCommunications Act, and another provision of the Tele-\ncommunications Act—the absence of one in Section\n332(c)(7)(B)(iii) is telling, and supports reading “decision\n. . . in writing” to demand nothing more than what it says:\na written document that communicates the town’s denial.\n    In my view, resolving that interpretive question in the\nCity’s favor also resolves the case as it stands in this\nCourt. Although Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) goes on to require\nthat a denial be “supported by substantial evidence con-\ntained in a written record,” the adequacy of the City’s\nwritten record is not properly before us. As the Eleventh\nCircuit noted in its opinion below, the “sole issue” before it\nwas the “in writing” requirement; it did not examine\nwhether the City’s denial was supported by substantial\nevidence. 731 F. 3d 1213, 1221, n. 7 (2013). The Court\ntoday also—correctly—does not decide whether substan-\ntial evidence supported the City’s denial. The Eleventh\nCircuit’s judgment therefore ought to be affirmed and the\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncase remanded to the District Court for further proceed-\nings on T-Mobile’s remaining challenges.\n                               II\n   The Court agrees that the City was not required to\nexplain its reasoning in its denial letter, but it nonetheless\nrules for T-Mobile. The improbable linchpin of this out-\ncome is the City’s failure to finalize the minutes of the\nApril 12 city council meeting until May 10. Improbable\nbecause, so far as I can tell, T-Mobile never even men-\ntioned this timeline, let alone based an argument on it, in\nits filings in the lower courts or its petition for certiorari.\nNor did the Eleventh Circuit address this timing question\nin any way. Cf. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (slip op., at 12) (“Ordinarily, we do not decide in the\nfirst instance issues not decided below.” (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)).\n   The Court nonetheless rules against Roswell on this\nground, proceeding in two steps: First it concludes that a\ntown must provide written reasons in some form (the\nminutes being the only candidate here); then it decides a\ntown must make those reasons available “essentially\ncontemporaneously” with its decision (the final minutes\nwere not). Ante, at 14. In my view, the first step is justi-\nfied by the statutory text, but the second is not.\n   The need to provide reasons in some form follows from\nthe portion of Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) requiring that deni-\nals be “supported by substantial evidence contained in a\nwritten record.” Like the majority, I read this phrase as\nspecifying a familiar standard of review to be used if a\ndenial is challenged in court. And like the majority, I\nagree that substantial evidence review requires that a\ndecisionmaker’s reasons be identifiable in the written\nrecord. If a reviewing court cannot identify any of a town’s\nreasons for denying an application, it cannot determine\nwhether substantial evidence supports those reasons, and\n6        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe town loses.\n  But then the Court goes a step further and creates a\ntiming rule: A town must provide “its written reasons at\nessentially the same time as it communicates its denial.”\nAnte, at 10. This timing rule is nowhere to be found in the\ntext of Section 332(c)(7)(B)—text that expressly establishes\nother time limits, both general and specific.            See\n§332(c)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring localities to act on siting re-\nquests “within a reasonable period of time”); §332(c)\n(7)(B)(v) (giving injured parties 30 days to seek judicial\nreview). Despite its assertion that the statute’s “enumer-\nated limitations” constitute “an exclusive list,” ante, at 9,\nthe Court offers two justifications for its inference of this\nadditional, unenumerated limitation.\n  The first is that “a court cannot review the denial with-\nout knowing the locality’s reasons,” so it would “stymie”\njudicial review to allow delay between the issuance of the\ndecision and the statement of reasons. Ante, at 10. This\nmakes little sense. The Court’s “essentially contempora-\nneous” requirement presumably means the town must\nproduce its reasons within a matter of days (though the\nmajority never says how many). But a reviewing court\ndoes not need to be able to discern the town’s reasons\nwithin mere days of the decision. At that point no one has\neven asked the court to review the denial. The fact that a\ncourt cannot conduct review without knowing the reasons\nsimply means that if the town has not already made the\nrecord available, it must do so by whatever deadline the\ncourt sets. The court should proceed “on an expedited\nbasis,” §332(c)(7)(B)(v), but that hardly means it will need\nthe record within days of the town’s decision. And in this\ncase there is no indication that the City’s submission of\nthe written record was untimely or delayed the District\nCourt’s review.\n  The Court’s second justification focuses on the denied\napplicant, which must choose within 30 days from the\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ndenial whether to take the town to court. §332(c)(7)(B)(v).\n“[W]ithout knowing the locality’s reasons,” the majority\nsays, the applicant “may not be able to make a considered\ndecision whether to seek judicial review.” Ante, at 10.\nThis concern might have force if towns routinely made\nthese decisions in secret, closed-door proceedings, or if\napplicants were unsophisticated actors. But the local\nzoning board or town council is not the Star Chamber, and\na telecommunications company is no babe in the legal\nwoods. Almost invariably in cases addressing Section\n332(c)(7), the relevant local authority has held an open\nmeeting at which the applicant was present and the issues\npublicly aired. In this case and others, T-Mobile has\nbrought its own court reporter, ensuring that it has a\nverbatim transcript of the meeting well before the town is\nlikely to finalize its minutes. See Brief for Petitioner 12,\nn. 2; T-Mobile South, LLC v. City of Milton, Georgia, 728\nF. 3d 1274, 1277 (CA11 2013). I strongly doubt that a\nsophisticated, well-lawyered company like T-Mobile—with\nextensive experience with these particular types of pro-\nceedings—would have any trouble consulting its interests\nand deciding whether to seek review before it had received\na written explanation from the town. The Court worries\nabout towns “sandbagg[ing]” companies with unexpected\nreasons, ante, at 10, n. 3, but if those reasons in fact come\nout of nowhere, they will not be supported by substantial\nevidence in the record. And if the company’s initial com-\nplaint mistakes the town’s reasoning, the company will\nhave no difficulty amending its allegations. See Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 15(a).\n   In sum, there is nothing impractical about reading the\nstatutory text to require only that the reasons implied by\nthe term “substantial evidence” be discernible to the court\nwhen it conducts substantial evidence review. Demanding\n“essentially contemporaneous” written reasons adds a\nrequirement that Congress has included expressly in\n8        T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC v. CITY OF ROSWELL\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nmany other statutes, but not in this one. See supra, at\n3–4.\n                          *    *    *\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court’s opinion and\njudgment are wrong. But this is not a “the sky is falling”\ndissent. At the end of the day, the impact on cities and\ntowns across the Nation should be small, although the\nnew unwritten requirement could be a trap for the unwary\nhamlet or two. All a local government need do is withhold\nits final decision until the minutes are typed up, and make\nthe final decision and the record of proceedings (with\ndiscernible reasons) available together.\n   Today’s decision is nonetheless a bad break for Roswell.\nOr maybe not. The Court leaves open the question of\nremedy, ante, at 14, and it may be that failure to comply\nwith the “in writing” requirement as construed by the\nCourt can be excused as harmless error in appropriate\ncases. It is hard to see where the harm is here. T-Mobile\nsomehow managed to make the tough call to seek review\nof the denial of an application it had spent months and\nmany thousands of dollars to obtain, based on a hearing it\nhad attended. And nothing about Roswell’s failure to meet\nthe “contemporaneously” requirement delayed, much less\n“stymied,” judicial review.\n   The Court today resolves the conflict over whether a\ntown must provide a statement of reasons with its final\ndecision, apart from the written record. We now know it\nneed not. As the Court explains, “nothing in [the] text [of\nthe Act] imposes any requirement that the reasons be\ngiven in any particular form,” and there is “in the Act no\ncommand—either explicit or implicit—that localities must\nprovide those reasons in a specific document.” Ante, at 9.\nGood analysis—which also should have been followed to\nreject the timing requirement the Court creates today.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

I write\nseparately to express my concern about the Court’s eager-\nness to reach beyond the bounds of the present dispute to\ncreate a timing requirement that finds no support in the\ntext or structure of the statute. We have been unwilling to\nimpose procedural requirements on federal agencies in the\nabsence of statutory command, even while recognizing\nthat an agency’s failure to make its decisions known at the\ntime it acts may burden regulated parties. See, e.g., Pen-\nsion Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S.\n633, 653–655 (1990). When a State vests its municipali-\nties with authority to exercise a core state power, those\nmunicipalities deserve at least as much respect as a fed-\neral agency. But today, the majority treats them as less\nthan conscripts in “the national bureaucratic army,”\nFERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.
