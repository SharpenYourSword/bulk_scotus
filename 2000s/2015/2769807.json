Argued October 15, 2014\u2014Decided January 14, 2015\nPetitioner Jennings sought federal habeas relief based on three theories\n  of ineffective assistance of counsel during the punishment phase of\n  his state capital murder trial. The District Court granted relief on\n  his two \u201cWiggins theories\u201d\u2014that counsel failed to present evidence of\n  a deprived background and failed to investigate evidence of mental\n  impairment, see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510\u2014but not on his\n  \u201cSpisak theory\u201d\u2014that counsel expressed resignation to a death sen-\n  tence during his closing argument, see Smith v. Spisak, 558 U. S.\n  139. The court ordered Texas to release Jennings unless, within 120\n  days, the State granted him a new sentencing hearing or commuted\n  his death sentence. The State attacked the Wiggins theories on ap-\n  peal, but Jennings defended on all three theories. The Fifth Circuit\n  reversed the grant of habeas corpus under the two Wiggins theories\n  and determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the Spisak claim.\n  Implicitly concluding that raising this argument required a cross-\n  appeal, the court noted that Jennings neither filed a timely notice of\n  appeal, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A), nor obtained the certifi-\n  cate of appealability required by 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c).\nHeld: Jennings\u2019 Spisak theory was a defense of his judgment on alter-\n native grounds, and thus he was not required to take a cross-appeal\n or obtain a certificate of appealability to argue it on appeal. Pp. 4\u2013\n 12.\n    (a) Because Jennings is an appellee who did not cross-appeal, he\n may \u201curge\u201d his Spisak theory unless doing so would enlarge his rights\n or lessen the State\u2019s rights under the District Court\u2019s judgment.\n2                       JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    United States v. American Railway Express Co., 265 U. S. 425, 435.\n    Jennings\u2019 rights under the judgment were release, retrial, or commu-\n    tation within a fixed time, at the State\u2019s option, and his Spisak claim,\n    if accepted, would give him no more. The State\u2019s rights under the\n    judgment were to retain Jennings in custody pending retrial or to\n    commute his sentence; the Spisak claim, if accepted, would not fur-\n    ther encumber the State. The State contends that, because the Dis-\n    trict Court\u2019s opinion entitled Jennings only to retrial (or resentenc-\n    ing) without the challenged errors, each additional basis asserted by\n    Jennings sought to lessen the State\u2019s rights at retrial, and thus re-\n    quires a cross-appeal. But this view is contrary to the ordinary be-\n    havior of courts, which reduce their opinions and verdicts to judg-\n    ments precisely to define the parties\u2019 rights and liabilities. A\n    prevailing party seeks to enforce a district court\u2019s judgment, not its\n    reasoning. Rogers v. Hill, 289 U. S. 582, 587. Thus, any potential\n    claim that would have entitled Jennings to a new sentencing proceed-\n    ing could have been advanced consistent with American Railway.\n    Pp. 4\u20139.\n       (b) Helvering v. Pfeiffer, 302 U. S. 247, and Alexander v. Cosden\n    Pipe Line Co., 290 U. S. 484, would be in considerable tension with\n    American Railway if they were read, as the State insists, as requiring\n    Jennings to raise his Spisak claim on cross-appeal even if his rights\n    under the court\u2019s judgment would remain undisturbed. Pfeiffer and\n    Alexander involved disputes over multiple discrete federal tax liabili-\n    ties, and the assertion of additional tax liabilities or defenses neces-\n    sarily sought to enlarge or to reduce the rights of the Internal Reve-\n    nue Service Commissioner.           In contrast, Jennings, whether\n    prevailing on a single theory or all three, sought the same, indivisible\n    relief: a new sentencing hearing. Thus, Pfeiffer and Alexander cannot\n    be viewed as contradicting the \u2018 \u201cinveterate and certain\u2019 \u201d American\n    Railway rule. Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 245.

He applied for federal habeas\ncorpus relief on three theories of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, prevailing on two. The State appealed, and Jen-\nnings defended his writ on all three theories. We consider\nwhether Jennings was permitted to pursue the theory that\nthe District Court had rejected without taking a cross-\nappeal or obtaining a certificate of appealability.\n                            I\n  In July 1988, petitioner Robert Mitchell Jennings en-\ntered an adult bookstore to commit a robbery. Officer\nElston Howard, by unhappy coincidence, was at the same\nestablishment to arrest the store\u2019s clerk. Undeterred,\nJennings shot Howard four times, robbed the store, and\nescaped. Howard died from his wounds.\n  Howard was merely the most recent victim of Jennings\u2019\ncriminality. The State adjudicated Jennings a delinquent\nat 14, convicted him of aggravated robbery at 17, and of\n2                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadditional aggravated robberies at 20. He murdered\nOfficer Howard only two months after his most recent\nrelease from prison.\n   Jennings was arrested, tried, and convicted of capital\nmurder, and the State sought the death penalty. During\nthe punishment phase, the State introduced evidence of\nJennings\u2019 lengthy and violent criminal history. Jennings\u2019\nattorney called only the prison chaplain, who testified\nabout Jennings\u2019 improvement and that Jennings was not\n\u201cincorrigible.\u201d Jennings\u2019 attorney acknowledged the diffi-\nculty of his sentencing defense in his closing remarks,\ncommenting that he could not \u201cquarrel with\u201d a death\nsentence, but was nonetheless pleading for mercy for his\nclient. The jury returned a special verdict, consistent with\nTexas law, that Jennings acted deliberately in the murder\nand that he would present a continuing threat to society.\nThe trial court sentenced Jennings to death. Texas courts\naffirmed Jennings\u2019 conviction and sentence and denied\npostconviction relief. Jennings v. State, No. AP\u201370911\n(Tex. Crim. App., Jan. 20, 1993); Ex parte Jennings, 2008\nWL 5049911 (Tex. Crim. App., Nov. 26, 2008).\n   Jennings applied for federal habeas corpus relief, assert-\ning, as relevant here, three theories of ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel in the punishment phase of his trial.\nJennings first claimed trial counsel was ineffective for\nfailing to present evidence of his disadvantaged back-\nground, including that his conception was the product of\nhis mother\u2019s rape, that his mother was only 17 when he\nwas born, and that he grew up in poverty. Jennings of-\nfered his mother and sister as witnesses.\n   Jennings next argued that trial counsel was ineffective\nfor failure to investigate and to present evidence of Jen-\nnings\u2019 low intelligence and organic brain damage. His\ntrial attorney admitted in affidavit that he failed to review\nthe case files from Jennings\u2019 prior convictions, which\ncontained a report suggesting Jennings suffered from mild\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmental retardation and mild organic brain dysfunction.\n(The report also suggested that Jennings malingered,\nfeigning mental illness in order to delay proceedings.)\nJennings argued that trial counsel should have examined\nJennings\u2019 prior case files, investigated Jennings\u2019 mental\nhealth problems, and presented evidence of mental im-\npairment in the punishment phase.\n   Finally, Jennings argued that counsel was constitution-\nally ineffective for stating that he could not \u201cquarrel with\u201d\na death sentence. According to Jennings, this remark\nexpressed resignation to\u2014even the propriety of\u2014a death\nsentence.\n   Jennings cited our decision in Wiggins v. Smith, 539\nU. S. 510 (2003), as establishing constitutional ineffec-\ntiveness when counsel fails to investigate or to introduce\nsubstantial mitigating evidence in a sentencing proceed-\ning. Though he did not cite our decision in Smith v.\nSpisak, 558 U. S. 139 (2010), he also argued that counsel\u2019s\nclosing remarks amounted to constitutional ineffective-\nness. The parties referred to these alleged errors as the\n\u201cWiggins errors\u201d and the \u201cSpisak error \u201d; we use the same\nterminology.\n   The federal habeas court granted Jennings relief on\nboth of his Wiggins theories, but denied relief on his\nSpisak theory. Jennings v. Thaler, 2012 WL 1440387 (SD\nTex., Apr. 23, 2012). The court ordered that the State\n\u201cshall release Jennings from custody unless, within 120\ndays, the State of Texas grants Jennings a new sentencing\nhearing or resentences him to a term of imprisonment as\nprovided by Texas law at the time of Jennings[\u2019] crime.\u201d\nId., at *7.\n   The State appealed, attacking both Wiggins theories\n(viz., trial counsel\u2019s failure to present evidence of a de-\nprived background and failure to investigate evidence of\nmental impairment). Jennings argued before the Fifth\nCircuit that the District Court correctly found constitu-\n4                  JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntional ineffectiveness on both Wiggins theories, and ar-\ngued again that trial counsel performed ineffectively\nunder his Spisak theory. The Fifth Circuit reversed the\ngrant of habeas corpus under the two Wiggins theories\nand rendered judgment for the State. 537 Fed. Appx. 326,\n334\u2013335 (2013). The court determined that it lacked\njurisdiction over Jennings\u2019 Spisak theory. Id., at 338\u2013339.\nImplicitly concluding that raising this argument required\ntaking a cross-appeal, the panel noted that Jennings failed\nto file a timely notice of appeal, see Fed. Rule App. Proc.\n4(a)(1)(A), and failed to obtain a certificate of appealability\nas required by 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c). Section 2253(c) pro-\nvides, as relevant here, that \u201c[u]nless a circuit justice or\njudge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may\nnot be taken to the court of appeals from . . . the final\norder in a habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d\n   We granted certiorari, 572 U. S. ___, (2014), to decide\nwhether Jennings was required to file a notice of cross-\nappeal and seek a certificate of appealability to pursue his\nSpisak theory.\n                            II\n  The rules governing the argumentation permissible for\nappellees urging the affirmance of judgment are familiar,\nthough this case shows that familiarity and clarity do not\ngo hand-in-hand.\n                             A\n  An appellee who does not take a cross-appeal may \u201curge\nin support of a decree any matter appearing before the\nrecord, although his argument may involve an attack upon\nthe reasoning of the lower court.\u201d United States v. Ameri-\ncan Railway Express Co., 265 U. S. 425, 435 (1924). But\nan appellee who does not cross-appeal may not \u201cattack the\ndecree with a view either to enlarging his own rights\nthereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIbid. Since Jennings did not cross-appeal the denial of his\nSpisak theory, we must determine whether urging that\ntheory sought to enlarge his rights or lessen the State\u2019s\nunder the District Court\u2019s judgment granting habeas\nrelief.\n  The District Court\u2019s opinion, in its section labeled \u201cOr-\nder,\u201d commanded the State to \u201crelease Jennings from\ncustody unless, within 120 days, the State of Texas grants\nJennings a new sentencing hearing or resentences him to\na term of imprisonment as provided by Texas law at the\ntime of Jennings[\u2019] crime.\u201d 2012 WL 1440387, at *7. The\nDistrict Court\u2019s corresponding entry of judgment con-\ntained similar language. App. 35. The intuitive answer to\nthe question whether Jennings\u2019 new theory expands these\nrights is straightforward: Jennings\u2019 rights under the\njudgment were what the judgment provided\u2014release,\nresentencing, or commutation within a fixed time, at the\nState\u2019s option; the Spisak theory would give him the same.\nSimilarly, the State\u2019s rights under the judgment were to\nretain Jennings in custody pending resentencing or to\ncommute his sentence; the Spisak theory would allow no\nless.\n  The State objects to this straightforward result. A\nconditional writ of habeas corpus, it argues, does not\nmerely entitle a successful petitioner to retrial (or resen-\ntencing), but it entitles him to retrial (or resentencing)\nwithout the challenged errors. Because each basis for\nhabeas relief imposes an additional implied obligation on\nthe State (not to repeat that error), each basis asserted by\na successful petitioner seeks to lessen the State\u2019s rights at\nretrial, and therefore each additional basis requires a\ncross-appeal.\n  This is an unusual position, and one contrary to the\nmanner in which courts ordinarily behave. Courts reduce\ntheir opinions and verdicts to judgments precisely to\ndefine the rights and liabilities of the parties. Parties\n6                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nseeking to enforce a foreign court\u2019s decree do not attempt\nto domesticate an opinion; they domesticate a judgment.\nRestatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the\nUnited States \u00a7\u00a7 481\u2013482 (1987). A prevailing party seeks\nto enforce not a district court\u2019s reasoning, but the court\u2019s\njudgment. Rogers v. Hill, 289 U. S. 582, 587 (1933). This\nCourt, like all federal appellate courts, does not review\nlower courts\u2019 opinions, but their judgments. Chevron,\nU. S. A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). And so a rule that contravenes\nthis structure, that makes the opinion part of the judg-\nment, is peculiar\u2014especially when it is applied to impose\nextrajudgment obligations on a sovereign State.\n   The State\u2019s argument might have force in a case where a\ndistrict court explicitly imposes (or the appellee asks the\nappellate court explicitly to impose) a condition governing\nthe details of the retrial. But that case is not before us.\nThe implications of the State\u2019s position make clear why\nsuch orders are atypical, and why we should not infer such\nconditions from silence. Construing every federal grant of\nhabeas corpus as carrying an attendant list of unstated\nacts (or omissions) that the state court must perform (or\nnot perform) would substantially transform conditional\nhabeas corpus relief from an opportunity \u201cto replace an\ninvalid judgment with a valid one,\u201d Wilkinson v. Dotson,\n544 U. S. 74, 87 (SCALIA, J., concurring), to a general grant\nof supervisory authority over state trial courts.\n   In a variation on the same theme, the dissent posits\nthat, apart from implied terms, a habeas petitioner who\nsuccessfully defends a judgment on an alternative ground\nhas expanded his rights under the judgment, because he\nhas changed the judgment\u2019s issue-preclusive effects. This\ntheory confuses a party\u2019s rights under a judgment\u2014here,\nthe right to release, resentencing, or commutation, at the\nState\u2019s option\u2014with preclusive effects that the judgment\nmight have in future proceedings. That makes nonsense\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof American Railway. Whenever an appellee successfully\ndefends a judgment on an alternative ground, he changes\nwhat would otherwise be the judgment\u2019s issue-preclusive\neffects. Thereafter, issue preclusion no longer attaches to\nthe ground on which the trial court decided the case, and\ninstead attaches to the alternative ground on which the\nappellate court affirmed the judgment.           Restatement\n(Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982). Thus, making altera-\ntion of issue-preclusive effects the touchstone of necessity\nfor cross-appeal would require cross-appeal for every de-\nfense of a judgment on alternative grounds. That is, of\ncourse, the polar opposite of the rule we established in\nAmerican Railway.\n   Under the habeas court\u2019s judgment, Jennings was enti-\ntled, at the State\u2019s option, to either release, resentencing,\nor commutation of his sentence. Any potential claim that\nwould have entitled Jennings to a new sentencing proceed-\ning could have been advanced to \u201curge . . . support\u201d of the\njudgment within the meaning of American Railway. 265\nU. S., at 435. The dissent and the State contend that\napplying American Railway in this fashion will lead to a\nproliferation of frivolous appellate defenses in habeas\ncases. If so, that is a problem that can only be solved by\nCongress. Until it does so, we think it appropriate to\nadhere to the usual law of appeals.\n   We think, however, that the danger is exaggerated. To\nbegin with, not all defenses will qualify. A habeas appli-\ncant who has won resentencing would be required to take\na cross-appeal in order to raise a rejected claim that would\nresult in a new trial. Similarly, even if a habeas applicant\nhas won retrial below, a claim that his conduct was consti-\ntutionally beyond the power of the State to punish would\nrequire cross-appeal. And even a successful applicant\ndoing no more than defending his judgment on appeal is\nconfined to those alternative grounds present in the rec-\nord: he may not simply argue any alternative basis, re-\n8                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngardless of its origin. Ibid.\n   Moreover, successful habeas applicants have an incen-\ntive to defend their habeas grants effectively, an objective\nthat is not furthered by diverting an appellate court\u2019s\nattention from a meritorious defense to a frivolous one.\nThe dissent gives two examples of habeas petitioners who\nraised numerous ostensibly frivolous claims. Post, at 9.\nThey prove nothing except the dissent\u2019s inability to sub-\nstantiate its claim that our holding will foster the presen-\ntation of frivolous alternative grounds for affirmance. For\nboth examples involved habeas petitioners who lost before\nthe magistrate and were casting about for any basis that\nmight justify a writ. We are talking here about habeas\npetitioners who have won before the district court. The\nnotion that they can often be expected to dilute their\ndefense of the (by-definition-nonfrivolous) basis for their\nvictory by dragging in frivolous alternative grounds to\nsupport it is thoroughly implausible. Indeed, as the State\nand Jennings agree, it is rare that a habeas petitioner\nsuccessful in the district court will even be called upon to\ndefend his writ on appeal.\n   And finally, we doubt that any more judicial time will be\nwasted in rejection of frivolous claims made in defense of\njudgment on an appeal already taken than would be wasted\nin rejection of similar claims made in (what the State and\ndissent would require) a separate proceeding for a certifi-\ncate of appealability. To be sure, as the dissent points out,\npost, at 9, the certificate ruling will be made by just one\njudge rather than three; but that judge will always be\nrequired to consider and rule on the alternative grounds,\nwhereas the three-judge court entertaining the govern-\nment\u2019s habeas appeal will not reach the alternative\ngrounds unless it rejects the ground relied on by the lower\ncourt. Not to mention the fact that in an already-pending\nappeal the court can give the back of its hand to frivolous\nclaims en passant, whereas the certificate process requires\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe opening and disposition of a separate proceeding.\n  In the end, the dissent tries to evade American Railway\nby asserting that habeas corpus is \u201cunique.\u201d Post, at 7.\nThere are undoubtedly some differences between writs of\nhabeas corpus and other judgments\u2014most notably, that\nhabeas proceedings traditionally ignored the claim-\npreclusive effect of earlier adjudications. But the reality\nthat some things about habeas are different does not mean\nthat everything about habeas is different. The dissent\nmust justify why the particular distinction it urges here\u2014\nabandonment of the usual American Railway rule\u2014is an\nappropriate one. It cannot.\n                              B\n  The State also advances what could be termed a corol-\nlary to the American Railway rule. Citing Helvering v.\nPfeiffer, 302 U.

S. 484 (1934), the State insists that a\ncross-appeal is necessary not only for Jennings to enlarge\nhis rights under the District Court\u2019s judgment, but also to\nattack the District Court\u2019s ruling rejecting his Spisak\ntheory, even if Jennings\u2019 rights under the court\u2019s judgment\nwould remain undisturbed.\n  The view of Pfeiffer and Alexander advanced by the\nState would put these cases in considerable tension with\nour oft-reaffirmed holding in American Railway. And it is\nnot the correct view. Both Pfeiffer and Alexander arose\nfrom disputes between the Commissioner of the Internal\nRevenue Service and taxpayers regarding multiple dis-\ncrete federal tax liabilities. Pfeiffer, supra, at 248; Alex-\nander, supra, at 486. In Pfeiffer, the Commissioner pre-\nvailed before the Board of Tax Appeals on his contention\nthat a dividend was taxable, but lost a similar claim\nagainst a cash payment. Only the taxpayer sought the\nSecond Circuit\u2019s review, and the taxpayer prevailed on the\ndividend liability. 302 U. S., at 249. In Alexander, the\n10                JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntaxpayer sought refund of four tax liabilities; the taxpayer\nwon on all four. Only the Commissioner appealed to the\nTenth Circuit, and that court affirmed two of the refunds,\neliminated a third, and reduced a fourth. Pfeiffer, supra,\nat 248\u2013249; Alexander, supra, at 486. The Commissioner\nsought our review in both cases; we refused to entertain\nthe Commissioner\u2019s arguments regarding the cash pay-\nment in Pfeiffer, or the taxpayer\u2019s regarding the elimi-\nnated and reduced claims in Alexander, citing American\nRailway.\n   The State argues that these holdings expanded the need\nfor cross-appeal, beyond merely those arguments that\nwould enlarge rights under the judgment, to those argu-\nments that revisit a lower court\u2019s disposition of an issue on\nwhich a judgment rests. For, the State argues, the re-\njected arguments would not necessarily have expanded\nthe Commissioner\u2019s or the taxpayer\u2019s rights; if some of the\npoints on which the respective appellee won below were\nrejected on appeal, his new arguments might do no more\nthan preserve the amount assessed.\n   But this view of Pfeiffer and Alexander distorts Ameri-\ncan Railway. American Railway does not merely require a\ncross-appeal where a party, if fully successful on his new\narguments, would certainly obtain greater relief than\nprovided below; it requires cross-appeal if the party\u2019s\narguments are presented \u201cwith a view either to enlarging\nhis own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his\nadversary.\u201d 265 U. S., at 435. In Pfeiffer and Alexander\nthe assertion of additional tax liabilities or defenses,\nrespectively, necessarily sought to enlarge or to reduce the\nCommissioner\u2019s rights, even if, under some combination of\nissues affirmed and reversed, one possibility would have\nproduced no more than the same tax obligations pro-\nnounced by the judgment below.\n   Once we have rejected the State\u2019s\u2014and dissent\u2019s\u2014\ntheories of implied terms in conditional writs, Jennings\u2019\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSpisak theory sought the same relief awarded under his\nWiggins theories: a new sentencing hearing. Whether\nprevailing on a single theory or all three, Jennings sought\nthe same, indivisible relief. This occurred in neither\nPfeiffer nor Alexander, and we decline to view those cases\nas contradicting our \u2018 \u201cinveterate and certain\u2019 \u201d rule in\nAmerican Railway. Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S.\n237, 245 (2008).\n                              C\n   Finally, the State urges that even if Jennings was not\nrequired to take a cross-appeal by American Railway,\nPfeiffer, and Alexander, he was required to obtain a certifi-\ncate of appealability. We disagree.\n   Section 2253(c) of Title 28 provides that \u201can appeal may\nnot be taken to the court of appeals\u201d without a certificate\nof appealability, which itself requires \u201ca substantial show-\ning of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d It is unclear\nwhether this requirement applies to a habeas petitioner\nseeking to cross-appeal in a case that is already before a\ncourt of appeals. Section 2253(c) performs an important\ngate-keeping function, but once a State has properly no-\nticed an appeal of the grant of habeas relief, the court of\nappeals must hear the case, and \u201cthere are no remaining\ngates to be guarded.\u201d Szabo v. Walls, 313 F. 3d 392, 398\n(CA7 2002) (Easterbrook, J.).\n   But we need not decide that question now, since it is\nclear that \u00a72253(c) applies only when \u201can appeal\u201d is \u201ctaken\nto the court of appeals.\u201d Whether or not this embraces a\ncross-appeal, it assuredly does not embrace the defense of\na judgment on alternative grounds. Congress enacted\n\u00a72253(c) against the well-known, if not entirely sharp,\ndistinction between defending a judgment on appeal and\ntaking a cross-appeal. Nothing in the statute justifies\nignoring that distinction.\n   The dissent laments that this result frustrates AEDPA\u2019s\n12                JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npurpose of preventing \u201cfrivolous appeals.\u201d Post, at 8. It\ncan indulge that lament only by insisting that the defense\nof an appealed judgment on alternative grounds is itself\nan appeal. The two are not the same. The statutory text\nat issue here addresses the \u201ctak[ing]\u201d of an appeal, not\n\u201cthe making of arguments in defense of a judgment from\nwhich appeal has been taken.\u201d Extending the certificate of\nappealability requirement from the former to the latter is\nbeyond the power of the courts.\n                        *    *    *\n  Because Jennings\u2019 Spisak theory would neither have\nenlarged his rights nor diminished the State\u2019s rights\nunder the District Court\u2019s judgment, he was required\nneither to take a cross-appeal nor to obtain a certificate of\nappealability. We reverse the judgment of the Fifth Cir-\ncuit and remand the case for consideration of Jennings\u2019\nSpisak claim.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

In doing so, the majority mis-\ntakenly equates a judgment granting a conditional-release\norder with an ordinary civil judgment. I respectfully\ndissent.\n                              I\n  Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c)(1)(A), as amended by the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless a circuit\njustice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an\nappeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from . . .\nthe final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the\ndetention complained of arises out of process issued by a\nState court.\u201d Further, \u201c[a] certificate of appealability may\nissue . . . only if the applicant has made a substantial\nshowing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d and the\ncertificate must \u201cindicate which specific issue or issues\n2                 JENNINGS v.

Because Jen-\nnings did not obtain a certificate of appealability (COA),\nwe must consider whether, by raising his \u201ccross-point,\u201d he\ntook an appeal within the meaning of AEDPA.\n  I agree with the majority that if a habeas petitioner\ntakes what is, in substance or in form, a cross-appeal to\nthe Court of Appeals, then he must obtain a COA. The\nfailure to obtain a COA is a jurisdictional bar to review.\nSee Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op.,\nat 8). The critical question the Court faces is whether\nJennings\u2019 \u201ccross-point\u201d was in fact a cross-appeal.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   The majority correctly identifies the rule we apply to\ndetermine whether a party has taken a cross-appeal,\nUnited States v. American Railway Express Co., 265 U. S.\n425, 435 (1924), but then fails to apply it in accordance\nwith the history of the writ of habeas corpus, our prece-\ndents concerning conditional-release orders, and tradi-\ntional principles governing equitable relief. Each of these\nguides supports the conclusion that a prisoner who obtains\na conditional-release order allowing the State to resen-\ntence him in a new proceeding is entitled, if the State\nelects that option, to a new sentencing proceeding free of\nthe specific constitutional violation identified by the dis-\ntrict court. Because a conditional-release order embodies\nthis specific right, an appellee\u2019s attempt to add additional\nerrors is an attempt to modify or expand his rights under\nthe judgment.\n   For most of its existence, the writ of habeas corpus was\nunderstood far more narrowly than it is today. See Wright\nv. West, 505 U. S. 277, 285\u2013287 (1992) (opinion of THOMAS,\nJ.). Originally, it played only a procedural role: It issued\nas of right when a prisoner showed probable cause to\nbelieve he was being held illegally\u2014that is, without a\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

W.\nChurch, A Treatise on the Writ of Habeas Corpus \u00a7\u00a794,\n122 (rev. 2d ed. 1893) (hereinafter Church). The \u201cgrant of\nthe writ decided nothing except that there was a case\ncalling for an answer by the gaoler.\u201d Goddard, A Note on\nHabeas Corpus, 65 L. Q. Rev. 30, 34 (1949). And the\ncourt\u2019s ultimate decision on the matter was limited to\nconfirming the legality of the prisoner\u2019s confinement or\nordering his immediate discharge. See Church \u00a7\u00a7130, 131.\n   The writ today, by contrast, is invoked to justify broad\nfederal review of state criminal proceedings for constitu-\ntional violations. And, when a district court issues the\nwrit, it usually enters a conditional-release order, offering\nthe State a choice between immediate release or a retrial\n(or resentencing) within a defined period of time. See\nWilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 86\u201387 (2005) (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring).\n   The purpose of a conditional-release order is to afford\nthe State an opportunity to remedy the specific constitu-\ntional violation identified by the district court. Since its\ninception over a century ago, we have treated a conditional-\nrelease order as entitling a habeas petitioner not just to\na new proceeding, but to a new proceeding that cures the\nspecific defect identified by the district court. One of our\nearliest precedents contemplating such an order is In re\nBonner, 151 U. S. 242, 259\u2013260 (1894). That case involved\na prisoner who had been lawfully convicted, but unlawfully\nordered to serve his federal sentence in a state peniten-\ntiary. Id., at 254\u2013255, 260. Invoking its \u201cpower to control\nand direct the form of judgment to be entered in cases\nbrought up before it on habeas corpus,\u201d the Court ordered\nthe delay of discharge to allow the prisoner to be \u201ctaken\nbefore the court where the judgment was rendered, that\nthe defects for want of jurisdiction which are the subject of\n4                  JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncomplaint in that judgment may be corrected.\u201d Id., at 261\n(emphasis added); see also Magwood v. Patterson, 561\nU. S. 320, 347 (2010) (KENNEDY, J., joined by, inter alios,\nALITO, J., dissenting) (\u201c[A] conditional grant of relief . . .\nallows the state court to correct an error that occurred at\nthe original sentencing\u201d). That understanding of habeas\njudgments has prevailed in an unbroken line of precedent.\nSee Richmond v. Lewis, 506 U. S. 40, 52 (1992); Hilton v.\nBraunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 775 (1987); Dowd v. United\nStates ex rel. Cook, 340 U. S. 206, 209\u2013210 (1951); Mahler\nv. Eby, 264 U. S. 32, 46 (1924). Cf. Dotson, supra, at 86\n(SCALIA, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he conditional writ serves\nonly to \u2018delay the release . . . in order to provide the State\nan opportunity to correct the constitutional violation\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting Braunskill, supra, at 775)).\n   When the State fails to cure the specific constitutional\nviolation identified by the district court, the habeas peti-\ntioner is entitled to release. That is because the prevailing\nhabeas petitioner has shown that his conviction or sen-\ntencing proceeding was unconstitutional and that he is\ntherefore \u201cactually entitled to release.\u201d Dotson, 544 U. S.,\nat 86 (SCALIA, J., concurring). \u201cConditional writs enable\nhabeas courts to give States time to replace an invalid\njudgment with a valid one, and the consequence when\nthey fail to do so is always release.\u201d Id., at 87. But that\nentitlement to release is tied to the constitutional violation\nidentified by the Court. A State committing a new consti-\ntutional violation during the new sentencing proceeding\nwill not be required to release the habeas petitioner under\nthe old order. Cf. Magwood, supra, at 339 (explaining that\na habeas petitioner who obtains a new sentencing proceed-\ning on the basis of one error may subsequently raise, in a\nfirst habeas application, other errors repeated in that\nproceeding).\n   A habeas petitioner\u2019s rights under the conditional-\nrelease order are thus defined by the violation that justi-\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

S. 482 (1975) (per curiam), makes that clear.\nDavis involved a prisoner who had obtained habeas relief\nbecause the prosecutor had failed to disclose a material\nand exculpatory laboratory report, in violation of Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). 421 U. S., at 483. When\nthe State moved to retry him, the prisoner discovered that\nthe State had destroyed some of the physical evidence\nused against him at his initial trial. Id., at 484. The\nDistrict Court granted the prisoner\u2019s motion to convert its\ninitial conditional-release order into an unconditional\norder. Id., at 485. After the Court of Appeals affirmed\nthat decision, this Court granted certiorari and reversed.\nId., at 486, 490. Although the conditional-release order\nprovided only that the prisoner should be released unless\nthe State moved to retry him within 60 days, Davis v.\nPitchess, 388 F. Supp. 105, 114 (CD Cal. 1974), the Court\nread that conditional-release order to require the State to\n\u201cprovid[e] respondent with the laboratory report,\u201d in addi-\ntion to moving to retry him within 60 days, Davis, 421\nU. S., at 483 (emphasis added). Because the order did not\naddress the separate issue of the physical evidence, the\nCourt refused to allow the District Court to use its de-\nstruction as a basis for converting the conditional-release\norder to an unconditional order.\n   That decision makes sense when considered in light of\ntraditional principles of equitable relief. \u201cThis Court has\nfrequently rested its habeas decisions on equitable princi-\nples.\u201d Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 717 (1993)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n(Such principles remain relevant after AEDPA\u2019s enact-\nment when they are consistent with the statutory scheme\nCongress adopted. See, e.g., McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569\nU. S. ___, ___ \u2013 ___ (2013) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 2\u20133).) And the Court has frequently recognized that an\nequitable \u201cremedy must . . . be limited to the inadequacy\n6                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthat produced\u201d the asserted injury. Lewis v. Casey, 518\nU. S. 343, 357 (1996). Thus, a conditional-release order\nwill not \u201cpermit a federal habeas court to maintain a\ncontinuing supervision over a retrial conducted pursuant\nto a conditional writ granted by the habeas court.\u201d Davis,\n421 U. S., at 490. But neither will a conditional-release\norder permit a State to hold a prisoner under a new judg-\nment infected by the same constitutional violation that\njustified the order\u2019s entry in the first place. See Dotson,\nsupra, at 87 (SCALIA, J., concurring); Harvest v. Castro,\n531 F. 3d 737, 750 (CA9 2008); Phifer v. Warden, 53 F. 3d\n859, 864\u2013865 (CA7 1995). Such an interpretation of ha-\nbeas judgments would render the writ hollow.\n  The history of the writ of habeas corpus, the treatment\nof conditional-release orders, and traditional principles of\nequitable relief resolve the dispute at issue here. A habeas\npetitioner awarded a conditional-release order based on\nan error at his sentencing proceeding is entitled, under\nthat order, to a new proceeding without the specific consti-\ntutional violation identified by the district court. Raising\nany other constitutional violation on appeal would be an\nattempt to modify the prisoner\u2019s rights flowing from that\norder.\n                             B\n  Given these principles, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals should be affirmed. Jennings prevailed in the\nDistrict Court on two theories of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and lost on another. The District Court entered a\nconditional-release order instructing the State to release\nJennings unless it granted Jennings a new sentencing\nhearing within 120 days or commuted his sentence. Ante,\nat 5. Under this Court\u2019s precedents, that general order\nembodies a specific instruction to the State with respect to\na new sentencing proceeding: resentence Jennings without\nthe two identified Wiggins errors. See ante, at 3 (citing\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nWiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510 (2003)). The State\u2019s fail-\nure to comply with that order would justify Jennings\u2019\nrelease. Jennings attempted, through his cross-point, to\nexpand his rights under the judgment when he attempted\nto alter the instruction to the State\u2014adding an additional\ninstruction about a Spisak error\u2014and, accordingly, the\ngrounds upon which he could obtain immediate release.\nSee ante, at 3 (citing Smith v. Spisak, 558 U. S. 139\n(2010)). Jennings\u2019 cross-point was in substance a cross-\nappeal for which he needed to obtain a COA.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   The majority makes no attempt to reconcile its decision\nwith the history of conditional-release orders, our prece-\ndents, or traditional limitations on equitable relief. Nor\ncould it. Instead, it divines an \u201cintuitive answer\u201d to the\nquestion presented, ante, at 5, from the law of judgments.\nBut not only is this the incorrect source of law, the major-\nity\u2019s position is fundamentally at odds with the law of\njudgments on which it purports to rely.\n   The majority agrees that, to understand how the cross-\nappeal rule applies in a given case, one must understand\nthe rights that parties obtained under the judgment at\nissue. But the majority refuses to look past the language\nof the conditional-release order. It is, of course, true that\nparties domesticate judgments, not opinions. Ante, at 5\u20136.\nAnd it is similarly true that prevailing parties enforce\njudgments, not reasoning. Ante, at 6. Those truisms,\nhowever, do not answer the question here, which is what\nrights flow from those judgments.\n   In answering that question, the majority simply an-\nnounces that the rights that flow from a habeas petition-\ner\u2019s judgment are the same rights that flow from any other\ncivil judgment. But that assertion ignores the unique\ncontext of habeas, in which the traditional principles of\n8                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe law of judgments have never applied. As explained\nabove, the writ of habeas corpus was historically a purely\nprocedural mechanism to obtain a court\u2019s determination as\nto the legality of a prisoner\u2019s confinement. Church \u00a7\u00a794,\n122, 130, 131. And that determination was never treated\nas an ordinary civil judgment entitled to res judicata\neffect. Id., \u00a7386; see also McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467,\n479 (1991).\n  Even if the majority were correct that the law of judg-\nments could simply be imported to the habeas context, it\nmisapplies that law. Under long recognized principles,\nincluding the doctrine of preclusion, parties have greater\nrights under civil judgments than merely the particular\nrelief afforded. A prevailing plaintiff \u2019s claims are wholly\nmerged into his judgment, preventing a defendant, in a\nfuture action on that judgment, from availing himself of\ndefenses that he could have raised in the court\u2019s first\nadjudication of the claims. Restatement (Second) of\nJudgments \u00a718 (1980). And a defendant, whether victori-\nous or not, can rely upon that judgment as the final adju-\ndication of a particular claim, preventing the plaintiff from\npursuing another action against him in the future on that\nsame claim. Id., \u00a719. These principles give rights to the\nparties beyond the remedy ordered. By narrowly and\nartificially defining the rights flowing from a civil judg-\nment as solely those rights identified in a written order,\nthe majority disregards these basic principles. And be-\ncause the majority purports to apply the general law of\njudgments, its decision will do damage well beyond the\nhabeas context in which this case arises.\n                             B\n  In the habeas context specifically, the majority\u2019s opinion\ninvites the same frivolous appeals that Congress passed\nAEDPA to prevent. Although courts had long relied on the\ncertificate of probable cause as a mechanism to prevent\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            9\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfrivolous appeals in habeas cases, AEDPA further nar-\nrowed access to such appeals with the creation of the COA\nrequirement. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 356\n(2003) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). A habeas petitioner\ncannot obtain a COA absent a substantial showing of the\ndenial of a constitutional, not merely federal, right. See\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483\u2013484 (2000). This\nrequirement serves an important gatekeeping function.\nBut the majority\u2019s decision will seriously undermine the\ncourts\u2019 ability to perform this function by allowing prison-\ners to pursue any alternative allegation, no matter how\nfrivolous, that would have justified the same new proceed-\ning awarded in the conditional-release order below.\n   This danger is by no means \u201cexaggerated,\u201d ante, at 7, as\nthe majority suggests. Habeas petitioners frequently\npursue 20 or more arguments on collateral review, even\nthough they could more effectively concentrate on a hand-\nful of arguments. See, e.g., Calvert v.

I see little reason to suspect that\nthe prisoners who file these scattershot applications will\nsuddenly alter their strategy on appeal.

And the\nexperience of the Courts of Appeals with this conduct is\nonly likely to grow now that the majority has approved it.\nWhere before only the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit had permitted prevailing habeas\npetitioners to raise rejected claims as alternative grounds\n10                 JENNINGS v.

But a COA can be decided by a single\ncourt of appeals judge, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c)(1), while a\nmerits appeal must be heard by a three-judge panel. By\nmandating the involvement of two additional judges in the\nadjudication of these claims, today\u2019s ruling triples the\nburden on the Courts of Appeals.\n                        *    *     *\n   This Court has repeatedly recognized that AEDPA\u2019s\npurpose is to \u201creduc[e] delays in the execution of state and\nfederal criminal sentences.\u201d Ryan v.

One of the key ways in which\nAEDPA encourages finality is to narrow the scope of ap-\npellate review by requiring habeas petitioners to obtain\nCOAs. The majority\u2019s decision undermines that legislative\nchoice and, in so doing, transforms the understanding\nof conditional-release orders that has prevailed since\nthe Court first announced their creation.

Argued October 15, 2014\u2014Decided January 14, 2015\nPetitioner Jennings sought federal habeas relief based on three theories\n  of ineffective assistance of counsel during the punishment phase of\n  his state capital murder trial. The District Court granted relief on\n  his two \u201cWiggins theories\u201d\u2014that counsel failed to present evidence of\n  a deprived background and failed to investigate evidence of mental\n  impairment, see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510\u2014but not on his\n  \u201cSpisak theory\u201d\u2014that counsel expressed resignation to a death sen-\n  tence during his closing argument, see Smith v. Spisak, 558 U. S.\n  139. The court ordered Texas to release Jennings unless, within 120\n  days, the State granted him a new sentencing hearing or commuted\n  his death sentence. The State attacked the Wiggins theories on ap-\n  peal, but Jennings defended on all three theories. The Fifth Circuit\n  reversed the grant of habeas corpus under the two Wiggins theories\n  and determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the Spisak claim.\n  Implicitly concluding that raising this argument required a cross-\n  appeal, the court noted that Jennings neither filed a timely notice of\n  appeal, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A), nor obtained the certifi-\n  cate of appealability required by 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c).\nHeld: Jennings\u2019 Spisak theory was a defense of his judgment on alter-\n native grounds, and thus he was not required to take a cross-appeal\n or obtain a certificate of appealability to argue it on appeal. Pp. 4\u2013\n 12.\n    (a) Because Jennings is an appellee who did not cross-appeal, he\n may \u201curge\u201d his Spisak theory unless doing so would enlarge his rights\n or lessen the State\u2019s rights under the District Court\u2019s judgment.\n2                       JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    United States v. American Railway Express Co., 265 U. S. 425, 435.\n    Jennings\u2019 rights under the judgment were release, retrial, or commu-\n    tation within a fixed time, at the State\u2019s option, and his Spisak claim,\n    if accepted, would give him no more. The State\u2019s rights under the\n    judgment were to retain Jennings in custody pending retrial or to\n    commute his sentence; the Spisak claim, if accepted, would not fur-\n    ther encumber the State. The State contends that, because the Dis-\n    trict Court\u2019s opinion entitled Jennings only to retrial (or resentenc-\n    ing) without the challenged errors, each additional basis asserted by\n    Jennings sought to lessen the State\u2019s rights at retrial, and thus re-\n    quires a cross-appeal. But this view is contrary to the ordinary be-\n    havior of courts, which reduce their opinions and verdicts to judg-\n    ments precisely to define the parties\u2019 rights and liabilities. A\n    prevailing party seeks to enforce a district court\u2019s judgment, not its\n    reasoning. Rogers v. Hill, 289 U. S. 582, 587. Thus, any potential\n    claim that would have entitled Jennings to a new sentencing proceed-\n    ing could have been advanced consistent with American Railway.\n    Pp. 4\u20139.\n       (b) Helvering v. Pfeiffer, 302 U. S. 247, and Alexander v. Cosden\n    Pipe Line Co., 290 U. S. 484, would be in considerable tension with\n    American Railway if they were read, as the State insists, as requiring\n    Jennings to raise his Spisak claim on cross-appeal even if his rights\n    under the court\u2019s judgment would remain undisturbed. Pfeiffer and\n    Alexander involved disputes over multiple discrete federal tax liabili-\n    ties, and the assertion of additional tax liabilities or defenses neces-\n    sarily sought to enlarge or to reduce the rights of the Internal Reve-\n    nue Service Commissioner.           In contrast, Jennings, whether\n    prevailing on a single theory or all three, sought the same, indivisible\n    relief: a new sentencing hearing. Thus, Pfeiffer and Alexander cannot\n    be viewed as contradicting the \u2018 \u201cinveterate and certain\u2019 \u201d American\n    Railway rule. Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 245.

He applied for federal habeas\ncorpus relief on three theories of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, prevailing on two. The State appealed, and Jen-\nnings defended his writ on all three theories. We consider\nwhether Jennings was permitted to pursue the theory that\nthe District Court had rejected without taking a cross-\nappeal or obtaining a certificate of appealability.\n                            I\n  In July 1988, petitioner Robert Mitchell Jennings en-\ntered an adult bookstore to commit a robbery. Officer\nElston Howard, by unhappy coincidence, was at the same\nestablishment to arrest the store\u2019s clerk. Undeterred,\nJennings shot Howard four times, robbed the store, and\nescaped. Howard died from his wounds.\n  Howard was merely the most recent victim of Jennings\u2019\ncriminality. The State adjudicated Jennings a delinquent\nat 14, convicted him of aggravated robbery at 17, and of\n2                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadditional aggravated robberies at 20. He murdered\nOfficer Howard only two months after his most recent\nrelease from prison.\n   Jennings was arrested, tried, and convicted of capital\nmurder, and the State sought the death penalty. During\nthe punishment phase, the State introduced evidence of\nJennings\u2019 lengthy and violent criminal history. Jennings\u2019\nattorney called only the prison chaplain, who testified\nabout Jennings\u2019 improvement and that Jennings was not\n\u201cincorrigible.\u201d Jennings\u2019 attorney acknowledged the diffi-\nculty of his sentencing defense in his closing remarks,\ncommenting that he could not \u201cquarrel with\u201d a death\nsentence, but was nonetheless pleading for mercy for his\nclient. The jury returned a special verdict, consistent with\nTexas law, that Jennings acted deliberately in the murder\nand that he would present a continuing threat to society.\nThe trial court sentenced Jennings to death. Texas courts\naffirmed Jennings\u2019 conviction and sentence and denied\npostconviction relief. Jennings v. State, No. AP\u201370911\n(Tex. Crim.

Crim. App., Nov. 26, 2008).\n   Jennings applied for federal habeas corpus relief, assert-\ning, as relevant here, three theories of ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel in the punishment phase of his trial.\nJennings first claimed trial counsel was ineffective for\nfailing to present evidence of his disadvantaged back-\nground, including that his conception was the product of\nhis mother\u2019s rape, that his mother was only 17 when he\nwas born, and that he grew up in poverty. Jennings of-\nfered his mother and sister as witnesses.\n   Jennings next argued that trial counsel was ineffective\nfor failure to investigate and to present evidence of Jen-\nnings\u2019 low intelligence and organic brain damage. His\ntrial attorney admitted in affidavit that he failed to review\nthe case files from Jennings\u2019 prior convictions, which\ncontained a report suggesting Jennings suffered from mild\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

According to Jennings, this remark\nexpressed resignation to\u2014even the propriety of\u2014a death\nsentence.\n   Jennings cited our decision in Wiggins v. Smith, 539\nU. S. 510 (2003), as establishing constitutional ineffec-\ntiveness when counsel fails to investigate or to introduce\nsubstantial mitigating evidence in a sentencing proceed-\ning. Though he did not cite our decision in Smith v.\nSpisak, 558 U. S. 139 (2010), he also argued that counsel\u2019s\nclosing remarks amounted to constitutional ineffective-\nness. The parties referred to these alleged errors as the\n\u201cWiggins errors\u201d and the \u201cSpisak error \u201d; we use the same\nterminology.\n   The federal habeas court granted Jennings relief on\nboth of his Wiggins theories, but denied relief on his\nSpisak theory.

The court ordered that the State\n\u201cshall release Jennings from custody unless, within 120\ndays, the State of Texas grants Jennings a new sentencing\nhearing or resentences him to a term of imprisonment as\nprovided by Texas law at the time of Jennings[\u2019] crime.\u201d\nId., at *7.\n   The State appealed, attacking both Wiggins theories\n(viz., trial counsel\u2019s failure to present evidence of a de-\nprived background and failure to investigate evidence of\nmental impairment). Jennings argued before the Fifth\nCircuit that the District Court correctly found constitu-\n4                  JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntional ineffectiveness on both Wiggins theories, and ar-\ngued again that trial counsel performed ineffectively\nunder his Spisak theory. The Fifth Circuit reversed the\ngrant of habeas corpus under the two Wiggins theories\nand rendered judgment for the State. 537 Fed. Appx. 326,\n334\u2013335 (2013). The court determined that it lacked\njurisdiction over Jennings\u2019 Spisak theory. Id., at 338\u2013339.\nImplicitly concluding that raising this argument required\ntaking a cross-appeal, the panel noted that Jennings failed\nto file a timely notice of appeal, see Fed. Rule App. Proc.\n4(a)(1)(A), and failed to obtain a certificate of appealability\nas required by 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c). Section 2253(c) pro-\nvides, as relevant here, that \u201c[u]nless a circuit justice or\njudge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may\nnot be taken to the court of appeals from . . . the final\norder in a habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d\n   We granted certiorari, 572 U. S. ___, (2014), to decide\nwhether Jennings was required to file a notice of cross-\nappeal and seek a certificate of appealability to pursue his\nSpisak theory.\n                            II\n  The rules governing the argumentation permissible for\nappellees urging the affirmance of judgment are familiar,\nthough this case shows that familiarity and clarity do not\ngo hand-in-hand.\n                             A\n  An appellee who does not take a cross-appeal may \u201curge\nin support of a decree any matter appearing before the\nrecord, although his argument may involve an attack upon\nthe reasoning of the lower court.\u201d United States v.

But\nan appellee who does not cross-appeal may not \u201cattack the\ndecree with a view either to enlarging his own rights\nthereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Since Jennings did not cross-appeal the denial of his\nSpisak theory, we must determine whether urging that\ntheory sought to enlarge his rights or lessen the State\u2019s\nunder the District Court\u2019s judgment granting habeas\nrelief.\n  The District Court\u2019s opinion, in its section labeled \u201cOr-\nder,\u201d commanded the State to \u201crelease Jennings from\ncustody unless, within 120 days, the State of Texas grants\nJennings a new sentencing hearing or resentences him to\na term of imprisonment as provided by Texas law at the\ntime of Jennings[\u2019] crime.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620566\"><a href=\"/opinion/620566/gonzalez-v-thaler/\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1440387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7. The\nDistrict Court\u2019s corresponding entry of judgment con-\ntained similar language. App. 35. The intuitive answer to\nthe question whether Jennings\u2019 new theory expands these\nrights is straightforward: Jennings\u2019 rights under the\njudgment were what the judgment provided\u2014release,\nresentencing, or commutation within a fixed time, at the\nState\u2019s option; the Spisak theory would give him the same.\nSimilarly, the State\u2019s rights under the judgment were to\nretain Jennings in custody pending resentencing or to\ncommute his sentence; the Spisak theory would allow no\nless.\n  The State objects to this straightforward result. A\nconditional writ of habeas corpus, it argues, does not\nmerely entitle a successful petitioner to retrial (or resen-\ntencing), but it entitles him to retrial (or resentencing)\nwithout the challenged errors. Because each basis for\nhabeas relief imposes an additional implied obligation on\nthe State (not to repeat that error), each basis asserted by\na successful petitioner seeks to lessen the State\u2019s rights at\nretrial, and therefore each additional basis requires a\ncross-appeal.\n  This is an unusual position, and one contrary to the\nmanner in which courts ordinarily behave. Courts reduce\ntheir opinions and verdicts to judgments precisely to\ndefine the rights and liabilities of the parties. Parties\n6                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nseeking to enforce a foreign court\u2019s decree do not attempt\nto domesticate an opinion; they domesticate a judgment.\nRestatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the\nUnited States \u00a7\u00a7 481\u2013482 (1987). A prevailing party seeks\nto enforce not a district court\u2019s reasoning, but the court\u2019s\njudgment. Rogers v. Hill, 289 U. S. 582, 587 (1933). This\nCourt, like all federal appellate courts, does not review\nlower courts\u2019 opinions, but their judgments. Chevron,\nU. S. A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). And so a rule that contravenes\nthis structure, that makes the opinion part of the judg-\nment, is peculiar\u2014especially when it is applied to impose\nextrajudgment obligations on a sovereign State.\n   The State\u2019s argument might have force in a case where a\ndistrict court explicitly imposes (or the appellee asks the\nappellate court explicitly to impose) a condition governing\nthe details of the retrial. But that case is not before us.\nThe implications of the State\u2019s position make clear why\nsuch orders are atypical, and why we should not infer such\nconditions from silence. Construing every federal grant of\nhabeas corpus as carrying an attendant list of unstated\nacts (or omissions) that the state court must perform (or\nnot perform) would substantially transform conditional\nhabeas corpus relief from an opportunity \u201cto replace an\ninvalid judgment with a valid one,\u201d Wilkinson v. Dotson,\n544 U. S. 74, 87 (SCALIA, J., concurring), to a general grant\nof supervisory authority over state trial courts.\n   In a variation on the same theme, the dissent posits\nthat, apart from implied terms, a habeas petitioner who\nsuccessfully defends a judgment on an alternative ground\nhas expanded his rights under the judgment, because he\nhas changed the judgment\u2019s issue-preclusive effects. This\ntheory confuses a party\u2019s rights under a judgment\u2014here,\nthe right to release, resentencing, or commutation, at the\nState\u2019s option\u2014with preclusive effects that the judgment\nmight have in future proceedings. That makes nonsense\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof American Railway. Whenever an appellee successfully\ndefends a judgment on an alternative ground, he changes\nwhat would otherwise be the judgment\u2019s issue-preclusive\neffects. Thereafter, issue preclusion no longer attaches to\nthe ground on which the trial court decided the case, and\ninstead attaches to the alternative ground on which the\nappellate court affirmed the judgment.           Restatement\n(Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982). Thus, making altera-\ntion of issue-preclusive effects the touchstone of necessity\nfor cross-appeal would require cross-appeal for every de-\nfense of a judgment on alternative grounds. That is, of\ncourse, the polar opposite of the rule we established in\nAmerican Railway.\n   Under the habeas court\u2019s judgment, Jennings was enti-\ntled, at the State\u2019s option, to either release, resentencing,\nor commutation of his sentence. Any potential claim that\nwould have entitled Jennings to a new sentencing proceed-\ning could have been advanced to \u201curge . . . support\u201d of the\njudgment within the meaning of American Railway. 265\nU. S., at 435. The dissent and the State contend that\napplying American Railway in this fashion will lead to a\nproliferation of frivolous appellate defenses in habeas\ncases. If so, that is a problem that can only be solved by\nCongress. Until it does so, we think it appropriate to\nadhere to the usual law of appeals.\n   We think, however, that the danger is exaggerated. To\nbegin with, not all defenses will qualify. A habeas appli-\ncant who has won resentencing would be required to take\na cross-appeal in order to raise a rejected claim that would\nresult in a new trial. Similarly, even if a habeas applicant\nhas won retrial below, a claim that his conduct was consti-\ntutionally beyond the power of the State to punish would\nrequire cross-appeal. And even a successful applicant\ndoing no more than defending his judgment on appeal is\nconfined to those alternative grounds present in the rec-\nord: he may not simply argue any alternative basis, re-\n8                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngardless of its origin. Ibid.\n   Moreover, successful habeas applicants have an incen-\ntive to defend their habeas grants effectively, an objective\nthat is not furthered by diverting an appellate court\u2019s\nattention from a meritorious defense to a frivolous one.\nThe dissent gives two examples of habeas petitioners who\nraised numerous ostensibly frivolous claims. Post, at 9.\nThey prove nothing except the dissent\u2019s inability to sub-\nstantiate its claim that our holding will foster the presen-\ntation of frivolous alternative grounds for affirmance. For\nboth examples involved habeas petitioners who lost before\nthe magistrate and were casting about for any basis that\nmight justify a writ. We are talking here about habeas\npetitioners who have won before the district court. The\nnotion that they can often be expected to dilute their\ndefense of the (by-definition-nonfrivolous) basis for their\nvictory by dragging in frivolous alternative grounds to\nsupport it is thoroughly implausible. Indeed, as the State\nand Jennings agree, it is rare that a habeas petitioner\nsuccessful in the district court will even be called upon to\ndefend his writ on appeal.\n   And finally, we doubt that any more judicial time will be\nwasted in rejection of frivolous claims made in defense of\njudgment on an appeal already taken than would be wasted\nin rejection of similar claims made in (what the State and\ndissent would require) a separate proceeding for a certifi-\ncate of appealability. To be sure, as the dissent points out,\npost, at 9, the certificate ruling will be made by just one\njudge rather than three; but that judge will always be\nrequired to consider and rule on the alternative grounds,\nwhereas the three-judge court entertaining the govern-\nment\u2019s habeas appeal will not reach the alternative\ngrounds unless it rejects the ground relied on by the lower\ncourt. Not to mention the fact that in an already-pending\nappeal the court can give the back of its hand to frivolous\nclaims en passant, whereas the certificate process requires\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe opening and disposition of a separate proceeding.\n  In the end, the dissent tries to evade American Railway\nby asserting that habeas corpus is \u201cunique.\u201d Post, at 7.\nThere are undoubtedly some differences between writs of\nhabeas corpus and other judgments\u2014most notably, that\nhabeas proceedings traditionally ignored the claim-\npreclusive effect of earlier adjudications. But the reality\nthat some things about habeas are different does not mean\nthat everything about habeas is different. The dissent\nmust justify why the particular distinction it urges here\u2014\nabandonment of the usual American Railway rule\u2014is an\nappropriate one. It cannot.\n                              B\n  The State also advances what could be termed a corol-\nlary to the American Railway rule. Citing Helvering v.\nPfeiffer, 302 U. S. 247 (1937), and Alexander v. Cosden\nPipe Line Co., 290 U. S. 484 (1934), the State insists that a\ncross-appeal is necessary not only for Jennings to enlarge\nhis rights under the District Court\u2019s judgment, but also to\nattack the District Court\u2019s ruling rejecting his Spisak\ntheory, even if Jennings\u2019 rights under the court\u2019s judgment\nwould remain undisturbed.\n  The view of Pfeiffer and Alexander advanced by the\nState would put these cases in considerable tension with\nour oft-reaffirmed holding in American Railway. And it is\nnot the correct view. Both Pfeiffer and Alexander arose\nfrom disputes between the Commissioner of the Internal\nRevenue Service and taxpayers regarding multiple dis-\ncrete federal tax liabilities. Pfeiffer, supra, at 248; Alex-\nander, supra, at 486. In Pfeiffer, the Commissioner pre-\nvailed before the Board of Tax Appeals on his contention\nthat a dividend was taxable, but lost a similar claim\nagainst a cash payment. Only the taxpayer sought the\nSecond Circuit\u2019s review, and the taxpayer prevailed on the\ndividend liability. 302 U. S., at 249. In Alexander, the\n10                JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntaxpayer sought refund of four tax liabilities; the taxpayer\nwon on all four. Only the Commissioner appealed to the\nTenth Circuit, and that court affirmed two of the refunds,\neliminated a third, and reduced a fourth. Pfeiffer, supra,\nat 248\u2013249; Alexander, supra, at 486. The Commissioner\nsought our review in both cases; we refused to entertain\nthe Commissioner\u2019s arguments regarding the cash pay-\nment in Pfeiffer, or the taxpayer\u2019s regarding the elimi-\nnated and reduced claims in Alexander, citing American\nRailway.\n   The State argues that these holdings expanded the need\nfor cross-appeal, beyond merely those arguments that\nwould enlarge rights under the judgment, to those argu-\nments that revisit a lower court\u2019s disposition of an issue on\nwhich a judgment rests. For, the State argues, the re-\njected arguments would not necessarily have expanded\nthe Commissioner\u2019s or the taxpayer\u2019s rights; if some of the\npoints on which the respective appellee won below were\nrejected on appeal, his new arguments might do no more\nthan preserve the amount assessed.\n   But this view of Pfeiffer and Alexander distorts Ameri-\ncan Railway. American Railway does not merely require a\ncross-appeal where a party, if fully successful on his new\narguments, would certainly obtain greater relief than\nprovided below; it requires cross-appeal if the party\u2019s\narguments are presented \u201cwith a view either to enlarging\nhis own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his\nadversary.\u201d 265 U. S., at 435. In Pfeiffer and Alexander\nthe assertion of additional tax liabilities or defenses,\nrespectively, necessarily sought to enlarge or to reduce the\nCommissioner\u2019s rights, even if, under some combination of\nissues affirmed and reversed, one possibility would have\nproduced no more than the same tax obligations pro-\nnounced by the judgment below.\n   Once we have rejected the State\u2019s\u2014and dissent\u2019s\u2014\ntheories of implied terms in conditional writs, Jennings\u2019\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Whether\nprevailing on a single theory or all three, Jennings sought\nthe same, indivisible relief. This occurred in neither\nPfeiffer nor Alexander, and we decline to view those cases\nas contradicting our \u2018 \u201cinveterate and certain\u2019 \u201d rule in\nAmerican Railway. Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S.\n237, 245 (2008).\n                              C\n   Finally, the State urges that even if Jennings was not\nrequired to take a cross-appeal by American Railway,\nPfeiffer, and Alexander, he was required to obtain a certifi-\ncate of appealability. We disagree.\n   Section 2253(c) of Title 28 provides that \u201can appeal may\nnot be taken to the court of appeals\u201d without a certificate\nof appealability, which itself requires \u201ca substantial show-\ning of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d It is unclear\nwhether this requirement applies to a habeas petitioner\nseeking to cross-appeal in a case that is already before a\ncourt of appeals. Section 2253(c) performs an important\ngate-keeping function, but once a State has properly no-\nticed an appeal of the grant of habeas relief, the court of\nappeals must hear the case, and \u201cthere are no remaining\ngates to be guarded.\u201d Szabo v. Walls, 313 F. 3d 392, 398\n(CA7 2002) (Easterbrook, J.).\n   But we need not decide that question now, since it is\nclear that \u00a72253(c) applies only when \u201can appeal\u201d is \u201ctaken\nto the court of appeals.\u201d Whether or not this embraces a\ncross-appeal, it assuredly does not embrace the defense of\na judgment on alternative grounds. Congress enacted\n\u00a72253(c) against the well-known, if not entirely sharp,\ndistinction between defending a judgment on appeal and\ntaking a cross-appeal. Nothing in the statute justifies\nignoring that distinction.\n   The dissent laments that this result frustrates AEDPA\u2019s\n12                JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npurpose of preventing \u201cfrivolous appeals.\u201d Post, at 8. It\ncan indulge that lament only by insisting that the defense\nof an appealed judgment on alternative grounds is itself\nan appeal. The two are not the same. The statutory text\nat issue here addresses the \u201ctak[ing]\u201d of an appeal, not\n\u201cthe making of arguments in defense of a judgment from\nwhich appeal has been taken.\u201d Extending the certificate of\nappealability requirement from the former to the latter is\nbeyond the power of the courts.\n                        *    *    *\n  Because Jennings\u2019 Spisak theory would neither have\nenlarged his rights nor diminished the State\u2019s rights\nunder the District Court\u2019s judgment, he was required\nneither to take a cross-appeal nor to obtain a certificate of\nappealability. We reverse the judgment of the Fifth Cir-\ncuit and remand the case for consideration of Jennings\u2019\nSpisak claim.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

In doing so, the majority mis-\ntakenly equates a judgment granting a conditional-release\norder with an ordinary civil judgment. I respectfully\ndissent.\n                              I\n  Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c)(1)(A), as amended by the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless a circuit\njustice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an\nappeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from . . .\nthe final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the\ndetention complained of arises out of process issued by a\nState court.\u201d Further, \u201c[a] certificate of appealability may\nissue . . . only if the applicant has made a substantial\nshowing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d and the\ncertificate must \u201cindicate which specific issue or issues\n2                 JENNINGS v.

Because Jen-\nnings did not obtain a certificate of appealability (COA),\nwe must consider whether, by raising his \u201ccross-point,\u201d he\ntook an appeal within the meaning of AEDPA.\n  I agree with the majority that if a habeas petitioner\ntakes what is, in substance or in form, a cross-appeal to\nthe Court of Appeals, then he must obtain a COA. The\nfailure to obtain a COA is a jurisdictional bar to review.\nSee Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op.,\nat 8). The critical question the Court faces is whether\nJennings\u2019 \u201ccross-point\u201d was in fact a cross-appeal.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   The majority correctly identifies the rule we apply to\ndetermine whether a party has taken a cross-appeal,\nUnited States v. American Railway Express Co., 265 U. S.\n425, 435 (1924), but then fails to apply it in accordance\nwith the history of the writ of habeas corpus, our prece-\ndents concerning conditional-release orders, and tradi-\ntional principles governing equitable relief. Each of these\nguides supports the conclusion that a prisoner who obtains\na conditional-release order allowing the State to resen-\ntence him in a new proceeding is entitled, if the State\nelects that option, to a new sentencing proceeding free of\nthe specific constitutional violation identified by the dis-\ntrict court. Because a conditional-release order embodies\nthis specific right, an appellee\u2019s attempt to add additional\nerrors is an attempt to modify or expand his rights under\nthe judgment.\n   For most of its existence, the writ of habeas corpus was\nunderstood far more narrowly than it is today. See Wright\nv. West, 505 U. S. 277, 285\u2013287 (1992) (opinion of THOMAS,\nJ.).

W.\nChurch, A Treatise on the Writ of Habeas Corpus \u00a7\u00a794,\n122 (rev. 2d ed. 1893) (hereinafter Church). The \u201cgrant of\nthe writ decided nothing except that there was a case\ncalling for an answer by the gaoler.\u201d Goddard, A Note on\nHabeas Corpus, 65 L. Q. Rev. 30, 34 (1949). And the\ncourt\u2019s ultimate decision on the matter was limited to\nconfirming the legality of the prisoner\u2019s confinement or\nordering his immediate discharge. See Church \u00a7\u00a7130, 131.\n   The writ today, by contrast, is invoked to justify broad\nfederal review of state criminal proceedings for constitu-\ntional violations. And, when a district court issues the\nwrit, it usually enters a conditional-release order, offering\nthe State a choice between immediate release or a retrial\n(or resentencing) within a defined period of time. See\nWilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 86\u201387 (2005) (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring).\n   The purpose of a conditional-release order is to afford\nthe State an opportunity to remedy the specific constitu-\ntional violation identified by the district court. Since its\ninception over a century ago, we have treated a conditional-\nrelease order as entitling a habeas petitioner not just to\na new proceeding, but to a new proceeding that cures the\nspecific defect identified by the district court. One of our\nearliest precedents contemplating such an order is In re\nBonner, 151 U. S. 242, 259\u2013260 (1894). That case involved\na prisoner who had been lawfully convicted, but unlawfully\nordered to serve his federal sentence in a state peniten-\ntiary. Id., at 254\u2013255, 260. Invoking its \u201cpower to control\nand direct the form of judgment to be entered in cases\nbrought up before it on habeas corpus,\u201d the Court ordered\nthe delay of discharge to allow the prisoner to be \u201ctaken\nbefore the court where the judgment was rendered, that\nthe defects for want of jurisdiction which are the subject of\n4                  JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncomplaint in that judgment may be corrected.\u201d Id., at 261\n(emphasis added); see also Magwood v. Patterson, 561\nU.

That understanding of habeas\njudgments has prevailed in an unbroken line of precedent.\nSee Richmond v. Lewis, 506 U. S. 40, 52 (1992); Hilton v.\nBraunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 775 (1987); Dowd v. United\nStates ex rel. Cook, 340 U. S. 206, 209\u2013210 (1951); Mahler\nv. Eby, 264 U. S. 32, 46 (1924). Cf. Dotson, supra, at 86\n(SCALIA, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he conditional writ serves\nonly to \u2018delay the release . . . in order to provide the State\nan opportunity to correct the constitutional violation\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting Braunskill, supra, at 775)).\n   When the State fails to cure the specific constitutional\nviolation identified by the district court, the habeas peti-\ntioner is entitled to release. That is because the prevailing\nhabeas petitioner has shown that his conviction or sen-\ntencing proceeding was unconstitutional and that he is\ntherefore \u201cactually entitled to release.\u201d Dotson, 544 U. S.,\nat 86 (SCALIA, J., concurring). \u201cConditional writs enable\nhabeas courts to give States time to replace an invalid\njudgment with a valid one, and the consequence when\nthey fail to do so is always release.\u201d Id., at 87. But that\nentitlement to release is tied to the constitutional violation\nidentified by the Court. A State committing a new consti-\ntutional violation during the new sentencing proceeding\nwill not be required to release the habeas petitioner under\nthe old order. Cf. Magwood, supra, at 339 (explaining that\na habeas petitioner who obtains a new sentencing proceed-\ning on the basis of one error may subsequently raise, in a\nfirst habeas application, other errors repeated in that\nproceeding).\n   A habeas petitioner\u2019s rights under the conditional-\nrelease order are thus defined by the violation that justi-\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

S. 482 (1975) (per curiam), makes that clear.\nDavis involved a prisoner who had obtained habeas relief\nbecause the prosecutor had failed to disclose a material\nand exculpatory laboratory report, in violation of Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). 421 U. S., at 483. When\nthe State moved to retry him, the prisoner discovered that\nthe State had destroyed some of the physical evidence\nused against him at his initial trial. Id., at 484. The\nDistrict Court granted the prisoner\u2019s motion to convert its\ninitial conditional-release order into an unconditional\norder. Id., at 485. After the Court of Appeals affirmed\nthat decision, this Court granted certiorari and reversed.\nId., at 486, 490. Although the conditional-release order\nprovided only that the prisoner should be released unless\nthe State moved to retry him within 60 days, Davis v.\nPitchess, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2312991\"><a href=\"/opinion/2312991/davis-v-pitchess/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

S., at 483 (emphasis added). Because the order did not\naddress the separate issue of the physical evidence, the\nCourt refused to allow the District Court to use its de-\nstruction as a basis for converting the conditional-release\norder to an unconditional order.\n   That decision makes sense when considered in light of\ntraditional principles of equitable relief. \u201cThis Court has\nfrequently rested its habeas decisions on equitable princi-\nples.\u201d Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 717 (1993)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n(Such principles remain relevant after AEDPA\u2019s enact-\nment when they are consistent with the statutory scheme\nCongress adopted. See, e.g., McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569\nU. S. ___, ___ \u2013 ___ (2013) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 2\u20133).) And the Court has frequently recognized that an\nequitable \u201cremedy must . . . be limited to the inadequacy\n6                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthat produced\u201d the asserted injury. Lewis v. Casey, 518\nU. S. 343, 357 (1996). Thus, a conditional-release order\nwill not \u201cpermit a federal habeas court to maintain a\ncontinuing supervision over a retrial conducted pursuant\nto a conditional writ granted by the habeas court.\u201d Davis,\n421 U. S., at 490. But neither will a conditional-release\norder permit a State to hold a prisoner under a new judg-\nment infected by the same constitutional violation that\njustified the order\u2019s entry in the first place. See Dotson,\nsupra, at 87 (SCALIA, J., concurring); Harvest v. Castro,\n531 F. 3d 737, 750 (CA9 2008); Phifer v. Warden, 53 F. 3d\n859, 864\u2013865 (CA7 1995). Such an interpretation of ha-\nbeas judgments would render the writ hollow.\n  The history of the writ of habeas corpus, the treatment\nof conditional-release orders, and traditional principles of\nequitable relief resolve the dispute at issue here. A habeas\npetitioner awarded a conditional-release order based on\nan error at his sentencing proceeding is entitled, under\nthat order, to a new proceeding without the specific consti-\ntutional violation identified by the district court. Raising\nany other constitutional violation on appeal would be an\nattempt to modify the prisoner\u2019s rights flowing from that\norder.\n                             B\n  Given these principles, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals should be affirmed. Jennings prevailed in the\nDistrict Court on two theories of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and lost on another. The District Court entered a\nconditional-release order instructing the State to release\nJennings unless it granted Jennings a new sentencing\nhearing within 120 days or commuted his sentence. Ante,\nat 5. Under this Court\u2019s precedents, that general order\nembodies a specific instruction to the State with respect to\na new sentencing proceeding: resentence Jennings without\nthe two identified Wiggins errors. See ante, at 3 (citing\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nWiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510 (2003)). The State\u2019s fail-\nure to comply with that order would justify Jennings\u2019\nrelease. Jennings attempted, through his cross-point, to\nexpand his rights under the judgment when he attempted\nto alter the instruction to the State\u2014adding an additional\ninstruction about a Spisak error\u2014and, accordingly, the\ngrounds upon which he could obtain immediate release.\nSee ante, at 3 (citing Smith v. Spisak, 558 U. S. 139\n(2010)). Jennings\u2019 cross-point was in substance a cross-\nappeal for which he needed to obtain a COA.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   The majority makes no attempt to reconcile its decision\nwith the history of conditional-release orders, our prece-\ndents, or traditional limitations on equitable relief. Nor\ncould it. Instead, it divines an \u201cintuitive answer\u201d to the\nquestion presented, ante, at 5, from the law of judgments.\nBut not only is this the incorrect source of law, the major-\nity\u2019s position is fundamentally at odds with the law of\njudgments on which it purports to rely.\n   The majority agrees that, to understand how the cross-\nappeal rule applies in a given case, one must understand\nthe rights that parties obtained under the judgment at\nissue. But the majority refuses to look past the language\nof the conditional-release order. It is, of course, true that\nparties domesticate judgments, not opinions. Ante, at 5\u20136.\nAnd it is similarly true that prevailing parties enforce\njudgments, not reasoning. Ante, at 6. Those truisms,\nhowever, do not answer the question here, which is what\nrights flow from those judgments.\n   In answering that question, the majority simply an-\nnounces that the rights that flow from a habeas petition-\ner\u2019s judgment are the same rights that flow from any other\ncivil judgment. But that assertion ignores the unique\ncontext of habeas, in which the traditional principles of\n8                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe law of judgments have never applied. As explained\nabove, the writ of habeas corpus was historically a purely\nprocedural mechanism to obtain a court\u2019s determination as\nto the legality of a prisoner\u2019s confinement. Church \u00a7\u00a794,\n122, 130, 131. And that determination was never treated\nas an ordinary civil judgment entitled to res judicata\neffect. Id., \u00a7386; see also McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467,\n479 (1991).\n  Even if the majority were correct that the law of judg-\nments could simply be imported to the habeas context, it\nmisapplies that law. Under long recognized principles,\nincluding the doctrine of preclusion, parties have greater\nrights under civil judgments than merely the particular\nrelief afforded. A prevailing plaintiff \u2019s claims are wholly\nmerged into his judgment, preventing a defendant, in a\nfuture action on that judgment, from availing himself of\ndefenses that he could have raised in the court\u2019s first\nadjudication of the claims. Restatement (Second) of\nJudgments \u00a718 (1980). And a defendant, whether victori-\nous or not, can rely upon that judgment as the final adju-\ndication of a particular claim, preventing the plaintiff from\npursuing another action against him in the future on that\nsame claim. Id., \u00a719. These principles give rights to the\nparties beyond the remedy ordered. By narrowly and\nartificially defining the rights flowing from a civil judg-\nment as solely those rights identified in a written order,\nthe majority disregards these basic principles. And be-\ncause the majority purports to apply the general law of\njudgments, its decision will do damage well beyond the\nhabeas context in which this case arises.\n                             B\n  In the habeas context specifically, the majority\u2019s opinion\ninvites the same frivolous appeals that Congress passed\nAEDPA to prevent. Although courts had long relied on the\ncertificate of probable cause as a mechanism to prevent\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            9\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfrivolous appeals in habeas cases, AEDPA further nar-\nrowed access to such appeals with the creation of the COA\nrequirement. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 356\n(2003) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). A habeas petitioner\ncannot obtain a COA absent a substantial showing of the\ndenial of a constitutional, not merely federal, right. See\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483\u2013484 (2000). This\nrequirement serves an important gatekeeping function.\nBut the majority\u2019s decision will seriously undermine the\ncourts\u2019 ability to perform this function by allowing prison-\ners to pursue any alternative allegation, no matter how\nfrivolous, that would have justified the same new proceed-\ning awarded in the conditional-release order below.\n   This danger is by no means \u201cexaggerated,\u201d ante, at 7, as\nthe majority suggests. Habeas petitioners frequently\npursue 20 or more arguments on collateral review, even\nthough they could more effectively concentrate on a hand-\nful of arguments. See, e.g., Calvert v. Henderson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1033632</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1 (ED La., Mar. 27, 2012) (raising 26 allega-\ntions of ineffective assistance of counsel); Battle v. Roper,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">799604</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *13 (ED Mo., Mar. 24, 2009) (raising 1\ndouble jeopardy issue and 20 allegations of ineffective\nassistance of counsel). I see little reason to suspect that\nthe prisoners who file these scattershot applications will\nsuddenly alter their strategy on appeal. Indeed, the expe-\nrience of the Courts of Appeals suggests otherwise. See,\ne.g., Jones v. Keane, 329 F. 3d 290, 296 (CA2 2003) (noting,\nbut refusing to consider absent a COA, a prevailing ha-\nbeas petitioner\u2019s \u201calternative grounds\u201d for affirmance\u2014\nallegations of insufficiency of the evidence and ineffective\nassistance of both trial and appellate counsel). And the\nexperience of the Courts of Appeals with this conduct is\nonly likely to grow now that the majority has approved it.\nWhere before only the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit had permitted prevailing habeas\npetitioners to raise rejected claims as alternative grounds\n10                 JENNINGS v. STEPHENS\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfor affirmance, now all Courts of Appeals will be subject to\nthat rule.\n   The majority also overlooks a significant procedural\ndistinction between an application for a COA and a merits\nappeal. The majority expresses \u201cdoubt that any more\njudicial time will be wasted in rejection of frivolous claims\nmade in defense of judgment on an appeal already taken\nthan would be wasted in rejection of similar claims made\nin . . . a separate proceeding for a certificate of appealabil-\nity.\u201d Ante, at 8. But a COA can be decided by a single\ncourt of appeals judge, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c)(1), while a\nmerits appeal must be heard by a three-judge panel. By\nmandating the involvement of two additional judges in the\nadjudication of these claims, today\u2019s ruling triples the\nburden on the Courts of Appeals.\n                        *    *     *\n   This Court has repeatedly recognized that AEDPA\u2019s\npurpose is to \u201creduc[e] delays in the execution of state and\nfederal criminal sentences.\u201d Ryan v. Valencia Gonzales,\n568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 17) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). One of the key ways in which\nAEDPA encourages finality is to narrow the scope of ap-\npellate review by requiring habeas petitioners to obtain\nCOAs. The majority\u2019s decision undermines that legislative\nchoice and, in so doing, transforms the understanding\nof conditional-release orders that has prevailed since\nthe Court first announced their creation. I respectfully\ndissent.\n</pre>",
