WARNER, ET AL., v.\n                 KEVIN J. GROSS, ET AL.\n                ON APPLICATION FOR STAY\n                      [January 15, 2015]\n\n  The application for stays of execution of sentences of\ndeath presented to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and by her re-\nferred to the Court is denied.\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG,\nJUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.\n  Charles Warner is to be executed tonight. He and three\nother Oklahoma death row inmates filed a petition for\ncertiorari and an application for stays of their executions,\ncontending that Oklahoma\u2019s lethal injection protocol\nviolates the Eighth Amendment. I believe that petitioners\nhave made the showing necessary to obtain a stay, and\ndissent from the Court\u2019s refusal to grant one.\n                            I\n  Oklahoma had originally scheduled Warner\u2019s execution\nfor April 29, 2014, immediately following its execution of\nClayton Lockett. Both executions were to be carried out\nwith a three-drug protocol consisting of midazolam, vecu-\nronium bromide, and potassium chloride. In theory, at\nleast, midazolam should render a condemned inmate\nunconscious, vecuronium bromide should paralyze him,\nand potassium chloride should stop his heart.\n  But the Lockett execution went poorly, to say the least.\nLockett awoke and writhed on the execution table for some\ntime after the drugs had been injected and officials con-\n2                       WARNER v. GROSS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfirmed him to be unconscious. He was overheard to say,\n\u201c \u2018Something is wrong,\u2019 \u201d and, \u201c \u2018The drugs aren\u2019t working.\u2019 \u201d\nApp. C to Pet. for Cert. 6 (App.). Eventually, some 40\nminutes after the lethal injection drugs were adminis-\ntered, Lockett died.\n   The State stayed all pending executions while it investi-\ngated what had gone wrong. Ultimately, the State issued\na report that placed much of the blame on the execution\nteam\u2019s failure to insert properly an intravenous (IV) line,\nfinding that a large quantity of the drugs that should have\nbeen introduced into Lockett\u2019s blood stream had instead\npooled in the tissue near the IV access point. An autopsy\ndid determine, however, that the concentration of midazo-\nlam in Lockett\u2019s blood was higher than necessary to ren-\nder an average person unconscious.\n   Soon thereafter, the State adopted a new execution\nprotocol. The protocol contains a number of procedures\ndesigned to better ensure that execution team members\nare able to insert properly an IV line and assess the con-\ndemned inmate\u2019s consciousness. The protocol also pro-\nvides for four alternative drug combinations that can be\nused for lethal injections, one of which is the same midazo-\nlam/vecuronium bromide/potassium chloride combination\nthat was used in the Lockett execution. Whereas the prior\nprotocol called for the injection of only 100 milligrams of\nmidazolam, the new protocol now calls for the injection of\n500 milligrams of that drug. The State has announced\nthat it plans to use this particular drug combination in all\nupcoming executions.*\n   Warner, along with 20 other Oklahoma death-row in-\nmates, filed a 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 complaint against various\nstate officials, contending that the State\u2019s proposed use of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The State has indicated that it intends to use rocuronium bromide\nin place of vecuronium bromide, but there does not appear to be any\ndispute that there is no material difference between these two drugs.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nmidazolam in executions would violate the Eighth\nAmendment. Four of the plaintiffs, including Warner,\nthen requested a preliminary injunction to prevent the\nState from implementing the new protocol and executing\nthem.\n   The District Court held a 3-day evidentiary hearing.\nTwo expert witnesses for the plaintiffs testified that alt-\nhough midazolam could be used to render an individual\nunconscious, it was not and could not be relied on as an\nanesthetic because the patient could likely regain con-\nsciousness if exposed to noxious stimuli\u2014such as the\ninjection of potassium chloride. For that reason, the Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the\ndrug for use as an anesthetic. As anesthesiologist Dr.\nLubarsky detailed, midazolam is subject to a \u201c \u2018ceiling\neffect\u2019 \u201d such that, no matter the dosage, it reaches a point\nof saturation and has no more effect, and at this satura-\ntion point the drug cannot keep someone unconscious.\nApp. C, at 43. According to these experts, this feature\ndistinguishes midazolam\u2014a benzodiazepine, like Valium\nor Xanax\u2014from barbiturates such as pentobarbital or\nsodium thiopental, which are often used as the first drug\nin a three-drug lethal injection protocol. In response, the\nState called a doctor of pharmacy, Dr. Evans, who disput-\ned these claims. Although Dr. Evans acknowledged that\nmidazolam was not generally employed as an anesthetic,\nhe contended that it would function as one if given in a\nhigh enough (and ordinarily lethal) dose.\n   The District Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a\npreliminary injunction, concluding that they had demon-\nstrated no likelihood of success on the merits of their\nclaims. The District Court found that \u201c[t]he proper admin-\nistration of 500 milligrams of midazolam . . . would make\nit a virtual certainty that any individual will be at a suffi-\ncient level of unconsciousness to resist the noxious stimuli\nwhich could occur from the application of the second and\n4                     WARNER v. GROSS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthird drugs.\u201d Id., at 42. Based on that finding, the Dis-\ntrict Court held that the plaintiffs had failed to establish\nthat the protocol \u201cpresents a risk that is \u2018sure or very\nlikely to cause serious illness and needless suffering.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 65 (quoting Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 50 (2008) (plural-\nity opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)). The District Court also\nconcluded that there was a \u201cseparate reason\u201d the plaintiffs\nhad failed to establish a likelihood of success: They had\nnot identified a \u201c \u2018known and available alternative\u2019 \u201d by\nwhich they could be executed, as the State had \u201caffirma-\ntively shown that sodium thiopental and pentobarbital,\nthe only alternatives to which the plaintiffs ha[d] alluded,\nare not available to the\u201d State. App. C, at 66\u201367 (quoting\nBaze, 553 U. S., at 61).\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s order\ndenying a preliminary injunction. The court held that the\nDistrict Court had been correct to require the plaintiffs to\nidentify an available alternative means of execution, and\nfound itself unable to conclude that the District Court\u2019s\nfactual findings regarding midazolam\u2019s effectiveness had\nbeen clearly erroneous. 2015 WL 137627, *8\u2013*9, *12 (Jan.\n12, 2015). The four plaintiffs, including Warner, peti-\ntioned for certiorari and filed an accompanying application\nfor a stay of their executions.\n                             II\n  To grant a stay, we must find a reasonable probability\nthat the Court would vote to grant certiorari, a significant\npossibility of reversal, and a likelihood of irreparable\ninjury to the applicant in the absence of a stay. See Bare-\nfoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 895 (1983). Petitioners\u2019\napplication met these criteria.\n  First, the question whether the courts below properly\nread Baze to require petitioners to identify other drugs\nthat the State might use to execute them warrants this\nCourt\u2019s attention. The Baze plurality\u2019s statement that a\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nchallenger must show that the risk of severe pain is \u201csub-\nstantial when compared to the known and available alter-\nnatives,\u201d 553 U. S., at 61, pertained to an Eighth Amend-\nment claim that the procedures employed in a particular\nprotocol were inferior to other procedures the State as-\nsertedly should have adopted, see id., at 51; see also id., at\n62 (\u201cPetitioners agree that, if administered as intended,\nthat procedure will result in a painless death\u201d). The same\nrequirement should not necessarily extend to a claim that\nthe planned execution will be unconstitutionally painful\neven if performed correctly; it would be odd if the constitu-\ntionality of being burned alive, for example, turned on a\nchallenger\u2019s ability to point to an available guillotine.\nIndeed, Baze did not purport to overrule or even address\nHill v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 573, 582 (2006), which re-\njected the argument that \u00a71983 plaintiffs such as petition-\ners must plead an \u201calternative, authorized method of\nexecution.\u201d\n   Second, both lower courts alternatively held that the use\nof midazolam did not create a substantial risk of unneces-\nsary pain within the meaning of Baze. As for that holding,\npetitioners correctly point out that the decision in Baze\nwas based on the understanding that the first drug in the\nthree-drug cocktail\u2014there, sodium thiopental\u2014would\nwork as intended. \u201cIt [was] uncontested that, failing a\nproper dose of sodium thiopental that would render the\nprisoner unconscious, there is a substantial, constitution-\nally unacceptable risk of suffocation from the administra-\ntion of pancuronium bromide and pain from the injection\nof potassium chloride.\u201d 553 U. S., at 53 (plurality opinion).\nThis issue is likewise uncontested here. If the first, anes-\nthetic drug does not work, then the second and third drugs\nwill leave the inmate paralyzed, slowly dying in \u201cexcruci-\nating pain.\u201d Id., at 71 (Stevens, J., concurring in judg-\nment).\n   Petitioners\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits turns\n6                    WARNER v. GROSS\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nprimarily, then, on the contention that midazolam cannot\nbe expected to maintain a condemned inmate in an uncon-\nscious state. I find the District Court\u2019s conclusion that\nmidazolam will in fact work as intended difficult to accept\ngiven recent experience with the use of this drug. Lockett\nwas able to regain consciousness even after having re-\nceived a dose of midazolam\u2014confirmed by a blood test\u2014\nsupposedly sufficient to knock him out entirely. Likewise,\nin Arizona\u2019s July 23, 2014, execution of Joseph Wood, the\ncondemned inmate allegedly gasped for nearly two hours\nbefore dying, notwithstanding having been injected with\nthe drug hydromorphone and 750 milligrams of midazo-\nlam\u2014that is, 50% more of the drug than Oklahoma in-\ntends to use. Moreover, since the District Court denied\nthe request for a preliminary injunction in this case, Ohio\nannounced that it would no longer employ a similar two-\ndrug cocktail involving midazolam and hydromorphone,\nwhich it used in a January 2014 execution during which\nthe condemned inmate reportedly gasped and snorted for\nmore than 20 minutes. See Williams, Drug Switch May\nDelay Executions in Ohio, N. Y. Times, Jan. 9, 2015, p.\nA15 (Washington, DC, ed.).\n   Although the State emphasizes that Florida continues to\nemploy a lethal injection protocol that utilizes the same\ndrug types and amounts as will now be employed in Okla-\nhoma, its apparent success with that method is subject to\nquestion because the injection of the paralytic vecuronium\nbromide may mask the ineffectiveness of midazolam as an\nanesthetic: The inmate may be fully conscious but unable\nto move. See Baze, 553 U. S., at 71 (Stevens, J., concur-\nring in judgment) (noting that the use of a paralytic\n\u201cmasks any outward sign of distress\u201d). The deficiency of\nmidazolam may generally be revealed only in an execu-\ntion, such as Lockett\u2019s, where the IV fails to sufficiently\ndeliver the paralyzing agent.\n   Moreover, there are numerous reasons to be skeptical of\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe evidence underlying the District Court\u2019s conclusion.\nAs petitioners emphasize, a number of scientific studies\nsupport the conclusion that midazolam does, in fact, have\na ceiling effect, and in part for that reason has not been\napproved for use as an anesthetic by the FDA. In contend-\ning that midazolam will work as the State intends, Dr.\nEvans cited no studies, but instead appeared to rely pri-\nmarily on the Web site www.drugs.com. But see App. H,\nat 88 (Web site\u2019s disclaimer that material provided is \u201cnot\nintended for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment\u201d).\nFurthermore, his opinion was premised on his belief that\nmidazolam\u2019s demonstrated \u201cceiling effect\u201d was an effect\nspecific to the spinal cord, and that there was no \u201cceiling\neffect\u201d with respect to midazolam\u2019s operation on the brain.\nBut petitioners\u2014who were not given the opportunity to\npresent rebuttal evidence in the District Court\u2014submitted\nto the Court of Appeals an affidavit from Dr. Lubarsky\nthat explained: \u201c[T]he ceiling effect is scientifically proven\nas fact and does not occur at the spinal cord level, nor has\nit been extensively studied there. Primary modes of anes-\nthetic action of midazolam occur in the brain (Perouansky,\nPearce & Hemmings, 2015) where electrical activity . . . is\nnot further diminished with larger doses.\u201d App. F, at 1\n(emphasis deleted).\n   I am deeply troubled by this evidence suggesting that\nmidazolam cannot constitutionally be used as the first\ndrug in a three-drug lethal injection protocol. It is true\nthat we give deference to the district courts. But at some\npoint we must question their findings of fact, unless we\nare to abdicate our role of ensuring that no clear error has\nbeen committed. We should review such findings with\nadded care when what is at issue is the risk of the need-\nless infliction of severe pain. Here, given the evidence\nbefore the District Court, I struggle to see how its decision\nto credit the testimony of a single purported expert can be\nsupported given the substantial body of conflicting empiri-\n8                    WARNER v. GROSS\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncal and anecdotal evidence.\n  I believe that we should have granted petitioners\u2019 appli-\ncation for stay. The questions before us are especially\nimportant now, given States\u2019 increasing reliance on new\nand scientifically untested methods of execution. Petition-\ners have committed horrific crimes, and should be pun-\nished. But the Eighth Amendment guarantees that no one\nshould be subjected to an execution that causes searing,\nunnecessary pain before death. I hope that our failure to\nact today does not portend our unwillingness to consider\nthese questions.\n",

S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nchallenger must show that the risk of severe pain is \u201csub-\nstantial when compared to the known and available alter-\nnatives,\u201d 553 U. S., at 61, pertained to an Eighth Amend-\nment claim that the procedures employed in a particular\nprotocol were inferior to other procedures the State as-\nsertedly should have adopted, see id., at 51; see also id., at\n62 (\u201cPetitioners agree that, if administered as intended,\nthat procedure will result in a painless death\u201d). The same\nrequirement should not necessarily extend to a claim that\nthe planned execution will be unconstitutionally painful\neven if performed correctly; it would be odd if the constitu-\ntionality of being burned alive, for example, turned on a\nchallenger\u2019s ability to point to an available guillotine.\nIndeed, Baze did not purport to overrule or even address\nHill v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 573, 582 (2006), which re-\njected the argument that \u00a71983 plaintiffs such as petition-\ners must plead an \u201calternative, authorized method of\nexecution.\u201d\n   Second, both lower courts alternatively held that the use\nof midazolam did not create a substantial risk of unneces-\nsary pain within the meaning of Baze. As for that holding,\npetitioners correctly point out that the decision in Baze\nwas based on the understanding that the first drug in the\nthree-drug cocktail\u2014there, sodium thiopental\u2014would\nwork as intended. \u201cIt [was] uncontested that, failing a\nproper dose of sodium thiopental that would render the\nprisoner unconscious, there is a substantial, constitution-\nally unacceptable risk of suffocation from the administra-\ntion of pancuronium bromide and pain from the injection\nof potassium chloride.\u201d 553 U. S., at 53 (plurality opinion).\nThis issue is likewise uncontested here. If the first, anes-\nthetic drug does not work, then the second and third drugs\nwill leave the inmate paralyzed, slowly dying in \u201cexcruci-\nating pain.\u201d Id., at 71 (Stevens, J., concurring in judg-\nment).\n   Petitioners\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits turns\n6                    WARNER v. GROSS\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nprimarily, then, on the contention that midazolam cannot\nbe expected to maintain a condemned inmate in an uncon-\nscious state. I find the District Court\u2019s conclusion that\nmidazolam will in fact work as intended difficult to accept\ngiven recent experience with the use of this drug. Lockett\nwas able to regain consciousness even after having re-\nceived a dose of midazolam\u2014confirmed by a blood test\u2014\nsupposedly sufficient to knock him out entirely. Likewise,\nin Arizona\u2019s July 23, 2014, execution of Joseph Wood, the\ncondemned inmate allegedly gasped for nearly two hours\nbefore dying, notwithstanding having been injected with\nthe drug hydromorphone and 750 milligrams of midazo-\nlam\u2014that is, 50% more of the drug than Oklahoma in-\ntends to use. Moreover, since the District Court denied\nthe request for a preliminary injunction in this case, Ohio\nannounced that it would no longer employ a similar two-\ndrug cocktail involving midazolam and hydromorphone,\nwhich it used in a January 2014 execution during which\nthe condemned inmate reportedly gasped and snorted for\nmore than 20 minutes. See Williams, Drug Switch May\nDelay Executions in Ohio, N. Y. Times, Jan. 9, 2015, p.\nA15 (Washington, DC, ed.).\n   Although the State emphasizes that Florida continues to\nemploy a lethal injection protocol that utilizes the same\ndrug types and amounts as will now be employed in Okla-\nhoma, its apparent success with that method is subject to\nquestion because the injection of the paralytic vecuronium\nbromide may mask the ineffectiveness of midazolam as an\nanesthetic: The inmate may be fully conscious but unable\nto move. See Baze, 553 U. S., at 71 (Stevens, J., concur-\nring in judgment) (noting that the use of a paralytic\n\u201cmasks any outward sign of distress\u201d). The deficiency of\nmidazolam may generally be revealed only in an execu-\ntion, such as Lockett\u2019s, where the IV fails to sufficiently\ndeliver the paralyzing agent.\n   Moreover, there are numerous reasons to be skeptical of\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe evidence underlying the District Court\u2019s conclusion.\nAs petitioners emphasize, a number of scientific studies\nsupport the conclusion that midazolam does, in fact, have\na ceiling effect, and in part for that reason has not been\napproved for use as an anesthetic by the FDA. In contend-\ning that midazolam will work as the State intends, Dr.\nEvans cited no studies, but instead appeared to rely pri-\nmarily on the Web site www.drugs.com. But see App. H,\nat 88 (Web site\u2019s disclaimer that material provided is \u201cnot\nintended for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment\u201d).\nFurthermore, his opinion was premised on his belief that\nmidazolam\u2019s demonstrated \u201cceiling effect\u201d was an effect\nspecific to the spinal cord, and that there was no \u201cceiling\neffect\u201d with respect to midazolam\u2019s operation on the brain.\nBut petitioners\u2014who were not given the opportunity to\npresent rebuttal evidence in the District Court\u2014submitted\nto the Court of Appeals an affidavit from Dr. Lubarsky\nthat explained: \u201c[T]he ceiling effect is scientifically proven\nas fact and does not occur at the spinal cord level, nor has\nit been extensively studied there. Primary modes of anes-\nthetic action of midazolam occur in the brain (Perouansky,\nPearce & Hemmings, 2015) where electrical activity . . . is\nnot further diminished with larger doses.\u201d App. F, at 1\n(emphasis deleted).\n   I am deeply troubled by this evidence suggesting that\nmidazolam cannot constitutionally be used as the first\ndrug in a three-drug lethal injection protocol. It is true\nthat we give deference to the district courts. But at some\npoint we must question their findings of fact, unless we\nare to abdicate our role of ensuring that no clear error has\nbeen committed. We should review such findings with\nadded care when what is at issue is the risk of the need-\nless infliction of severe pain. Here, given the evidence\nbefore the District Court, I struggle to see how its decision\nto credit the testimony of a single purported expert can be\nsupported given the substantial body of conflicting empiri-\n8                    WARNER v. GROSS\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncal and anecdotal evidence.\n  I believe that we should have granted petitioners\u2019 appli-\ncation for stay. The questions before us are especially\nimportant now, given States\u2019 increasing reliance on new\nand scientifically untested methods of execution. Petition-\ners have committed horrific crimes, and should be pun-\nished. But the Eighth Amendment guarantees that no one\nshould be subjected to an execution that causes searing,\nunnecessary pain before death. I hope that our failure to\nact today does not portend our unwillingness to consider\nthese questions.\n</pre>",
