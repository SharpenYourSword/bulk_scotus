Decided January 20, 2015\n\n\n   The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma\npauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is\ndenied.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins,\ndissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n   Forty-six years ago, this Court created a presumption of\njudicial vindictiveness that applies when a judge imposes\na more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial.\nNorth Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 725\u2013726 (1969).\nThat presumption was\u2014and remains\u2014an anomaly in our\nlaw, which ordinarily \u201c \u2018presum[es] . . . honesty and integ-\nrity in those serving as adjudicators.\u2019 \u201d Caperton v. A. T.\nMassey Coal Co., 556 U. S. 868, 891 (2009) (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting) (quoting Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35,\n47 (1975)). Perhaps recognizing the oddity of this pre-\nsumption, the Court has repeatedly cautioned that it\napplies only where there is a reasonable likelihood that\nthe increase in sentence was the product of actual vindic-\ntiveness on the part of the sentencing authority. E.g.,\nAlabama v. Smith, 490 U. S. 794, 799 (1989).\n   Despite this instruction, confusion reigns. Some Courts\nof Appeals have taken a narrow view of the presumption,\nconcluding that it applies only when a \u201ctriggering event\u201d\nlike a reversal by a higher tribunal \u201cprods the sentencing\ncourt into a posture of self-vindication.\u201d Kindred v.\nSpears, 894 F. 2d 1477, 1480 (CA5 1990); accord, e.g.,\nFenner v.

Others have taken a more expansive view,\napplying it when the trial court imposes a higher sentence\nafter granting a motion for corrected sentence. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Paul, 783 F. 2d 84, 88 (CA7 1986). In this\ncase, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit took the latter approach. 565 Fed. Appx. 175, 188\n(2014) (per curiam). The Court should have granted this\npetition to resolve the confusion.\n                              I\n  While serving a prison term for breaking and entering,\nrespondent Timothy Jared Austin walked away from an\ninmate road crew. He was apprehended and pleaded\nguilty to attempted escape. The West Virginia trial court\nsentenced him to one to three years for the attempted\nescape.\n  At sentencing, the trial judge considered when Austin\nshould begin serving that sentence. Austin was expected\nto be discharged on his breaking-and-entering conviction\nin December 2014, but was expected to become eligible for\nparole in March 2010. Recognizing that Austin\u2019s attempted\nescape had not been violent, but still amounted to a\n\u201cbreach [of] trust,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 70, the trial court\nannounced its sentence to begin on Austin\u2019s expected\nparole date:\n    \u201cNow, I\u2019ve got several ways that I can sentence you. I\n    can sentence you to a one to three, starting today [No-\n    vember 12, 2009], or I can sentence you to a one to\n    three starting when you\u2019re discharged, but I\u2019m going\n    to split the baby in half. I\u2019m going to sentence you to\n    a one to three, and your one to three is going to begin\n    in March of 2010, which means you\u2019re not going to get\n    out on parole in March, but you will start your one\n    year then.\n      \u201cNow, why am I doing it that way? . . . [I] think you\n    should serve some time for [the attempted escape]; so,\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    by making [the sentence] beginning in March of 2010,\n    which is about 4 or 5 months from now and not giving\n    you any back credit, that\u2019s probably going to cost\n    you\u2014well it will cost you your opportunity for parole\n    because you won\u2019t be eligible then until March of\n    2011, and if the parole board wants to parole you on\n    both of those, that\u2019s fine, and if not, well, you\u2019ll re-\n    member that next time you go for a little stroll.\u201d Id.,\n    at 71\u201372.\n   Seven months later, Austin filed an expedited motion to\ncorrect his sentence, arguing that state law prohibited the\ntrial court from imposing a sentence that was neither\npurely concurrent nor purely consecutive. While that\nmotion was pending in the trial court, he petitioned the\nWest Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals for a writ of\nmandamus to the trial court to respond to the motion.\nFour days after receiving a copy of that petition, the trial\ncourt entered an amended sentencing order as follows:\n    \u201c[T]he undersigned Judge received a copy of a Writ of\n    Mandamus or in the alternative Original Petition for\n    Writ of Habeas Corpus. The Court also received a\n    proposed Amended Sentencing Order. After review-\n    ing this matter, it is clear to this Court that an\n    Amended [Sentencing] Order is needed to clarify the\n    original Sentencing Order, entered on November 23,\n    2009. . . . It was the intent of this sentencing court\n    that the sentence imposed on November 12, 2009 be\n    served consecutively with the unrelated sentence the\n    defendant was already serving on November 12, 2009.\n    It was the intent of the sentencing court to give the\n    defendant credit for time served from his arraignment\n    to the date of sentencing and that the balance of his\n    sentence be served consecutively to the sentence he\n    was already serving in an unrelated matter.\u201d Id., at\n    59.\n4                    PLUMLEY v. AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nThis order resulted in a longer total sentence.\n   The defendant appealed to the West Virginia Supreme\nCourt, arguing that the court should presume that the\ntrial judge had acted vindictively when he filed the\namended sentencing order. The State Supreme Court\nrejected the appeal, explaining that it was clear that the\ntrial judge acted only to clarify his intention in the original\nsentencing order.\n   The defendant then applied for a writ of habeas corpus\nin federal court based on the same claim of judicial vindic-\ntiveness. The District Court denied the application, con-\ncluding that the West Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decision\nwas not based on an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d). It agreed with the West\nVirginia Supreme Court that nothing had occurred to\ntrigger the presumption of judicial vindictiveness. As it\nexplained, the West Virginia trial judge had entered the\namended sentencing order based on the defendant\u2019s mo-\ntion for a corrected sentence, not based on any reversal by\na higher tribunal.\n   The Fourth Circuit granted a certificate of appealability\nand reversed. 565 Fed. Appx. 175. It concluded that the\nWest Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decision was based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts, \u00a72254(d)(2), and\ndeclined to afford any deference to that decision. Id., at\n184\u2013185. It then applied the presumption of vindictive-\nness. Although recognizing that the state trial judge had\nnot been reversed by a higher tribunal, the Fourth Circuit\nconcluded that the presumption applied because, \u201cwhen\n[the defendant] was resentenced, he was exercising rights\nguaranteed under the statutes and Constitution of West\nVirginia.\u201d Id., at 188.\n                            II\n  This Court should have granted certiorari to review the\nFourth Circuit\u2019s decision for a number of reasons. To\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbegin with, that decision is in tension with our precedents.\nAlthough \u201cthe Pearce opinion appeared on its face to an-\nnounce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent\ncases have made clear that its presumption of vindictive-\nness \u2018does not apply in every case where a convicted de-\nfendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.\u2019 \u201d Smith,\n490 U. S., at 799 (brackets omitted). Instead, we have\napplied it only where there is a reasonable likelihood of\nactual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing author-\nity. Ibid. Thus, we have refused to apply the presumption\nto a higher sentence entered after a retrial ordered by the\noriginal sentencing judge. Texas v. McCullough, 475 U. S.\n134, 138\u2013139 (1986). \u201c[U]nlike the judge who has been\nreversed,\u201d we explained, the trial judge had \u201cno motivation\nto engage in self-vindication.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule is incompatible with this\nreasoning. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the pre-\nsumption applied because, when Austin was resentenced,\n\u201che was exercising rights guaranteed under the statutes\nand Constitution of West Virginia.\u201d 565 Fed. Appx., at\n188. Under that reasoning, the defendant who exercised\nhis rights to file and obtain a motion for a new trial should\nalso have been entitled to the presumption of vindictive-\nness. Contra, McCullough, 475 U. S., at 138\u2013139. But\nthis Court has already rejected the \u201cview that the judicial\ntemperament of our Nation\u2019s trial judges will suddenly\nchange upon the filing of a successful post-trial motion.\u201d\nId., at 139. To presume otherwise is to show profound\ndisrespect to our fellow jurists. And that disrespect is\neven more pronounced in cases like this one, when federal\njudges are reviewing state criminal proceedings.\n   The Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision merits review for an addi-\ntional reason: It deepens existing disagreement between\nthe Courts of Appeals over the scope of the presumption of\nvindictiveness. On the one hand, the Fifth and Ninth\nCircuits have taken the position that the presumption\n6                    PLUMLEY v. AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndoes not apply \u201c[a]bsent a triggering event\u201d that \u201cprods the\nsentencing court into a posture of self-vindication.\u201d Kin-\ndred, 894 F. 2d, at 1480; accord, e.g., Fenner, 251 F. 3d, at\n788. For these courts, a reversal by a higher tribunal or\norder from a higher tribunal is such a triggering event, see\nBono v. Benov, 197 F. 3d 409, 417 (CA9 1999); Kindred,\nsupra, at 1479\u20131480, whereas the mere filing of an appli-\ncation or motion challenging a sentence is not, see Fenner,\nsupra, at 788\u2013789. The Eighth Circuit agrees and has\nconcluded that reversal by a higher tribunal is the only\nsuch triggering event. Savina v. Getty, 982 F. 2d 526\n(1992) (unpublished table decision). The Seventh Circuit,\non the other hand, has stated that it would apply the\npresumption even if the trial court imposed a higher sen-\ntence after itself granting a defendant\u2019s motion for a cor-\nrected sentence. United States v. Brick, 905 F. 2d 1092,\n1096 (1990) (citing United States v. Paul, 783 F. 2d 84, 88\n(CA7 1986)).\n   Our precedents have created this confusion, first by\nendorsing a presumption that is at odds with the respect\nwe ordinarily accord our Nation\u2019s judges, and then by\nchipping away at that presumption in a piecemeal fashion.\nWe should not abdicate our responsibility to clean up a\nmess of our making. Utah Highway Patrol Assn. v. Ameri-\ncan Atheists, Inc., 565 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 17\u201318).\nIt is time to revisit and clarify when, if ever, a presump-\ntion of judicial vindictiveness is appropriate.\n   True enough, the decision below is unpublished and\ntherefore lacks precedential force in the Fourth Circuit.\nMinor v. Bostwick Labs., Inc., 669 F. 3d 428, 433, n. 6\n(CA4 2012). But that in itself is yet another disturbing\naspect of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision, and yet another\nreason to grant review. The Court of Appeals had full\nbriefing and argument on Austin\u2019s claim of judicial vindic-\ntiveness. It analyzed the claim in a 39-page opinion writ-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nten over a dissent. By any standard\u2014and certainly by the\nFourth Circuit\u2019s own\u2014this decision should have been\npublished. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s Local Rule 36(a) provides\nthat opinions will be published only if they satisfy one or\nmore of five standards of publication. The opinion in this\ncase met at least three of them: it \u201cestablishe[d] . . . a rule\nof law within th[at] Circuit,\u201d \u201cinvolve[d] a legal issue of\ncontinuing public interest,\u201d and \u201ccreate[d] a conflict with a\ndecision in another circuit.\u201d Rules 36(a)(i), (ii), (v) (2015).\nIt is hard to imagine a reason that the Court of Appeals\nwould not have published this opinion except to avoid\ncreating binding law for the Circuit.\n                        *     *    *\n   The Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision warrants review. It orders\nthe District Court to grant the extraordinary writ of ha-\nbeas corpus on a questionable basis. It announces a rule\nthat is at odds with the decisions of this Court and Courts\nof Appeals. And, it does so in an unpublished opinion that\npreserves its ability to change course in the future. For\nthese reasons, we should have granted the petition for a\nwrit of certiorari.\n",

S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbegin with, that decision is in tension with our precedents.\nAlthough \u201cthe Pearce opinion appeared on its face to an-\nnounce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent\ncases have made clear that its presumption of vindictive-\nness \u2018does not apply in every case where a convicted de-\nfendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.\u2019 \u201d Smith,\n490 U. S., at 799 (brackets omitted). Instead, we have\napplied it only where there is a reasonable likelihood of\nactual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing author-\nity. Ibid. Thus, we have refused to apply the presumption\nto a higher sentence entered after a retrial ordered by the\noriginal sentencing judge. Texas v. McCullough, 475 U. S.\n134, 138\u2013139 (1986). \u201c[U]nlike the judge who has been\nreversed,\u201d we explained, the trial judge had \u201cno motivation\nto engage in self-vindication.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule is incompatible with this\nreasoning. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the pre-\nsumption applied because, when Austin was resentenced,\n\u201che was exercising rights guaranteed under the statutes\nand Constitution of West Virginia.\u201d 565 Fed. Appx., at\n188. Under that reasoning, the defendant who exercised\nhis rights to file and obtain a motion for a new trial should\nalso have been entitled to the presumption of vindictive-\nness. Contra, McCullough, 475 U. S., at 138\u2013139. But\nthis Court has already rejected the \u201cview that the judicial\ntemperament of our Nation\u2019s trial judges will suddenly\nchange upon the filing of a successful post-trial motion.\u201d\nId., at 139. To presume otherwise is to show profound\ndisrespect to our fellow jurists. And that disrespect is\neven more pronounced in cases like this one, when federal\njudges are reviewing state criminal proceedings.\n   The Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision merits review for an addi-\ntional reason: It deepens existing disagreement between\nthe Courts of Appeals over the scope of the presumption of\nvindictiveness. On the one hand, the Fifth and Ninth\nCircuits have taken the position that the presumption\n6                    PLUMLEY v. AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndoes not apply \u201c[a]bsent a triggering event\u201d that \u201cprods the\nsentencing court into a posture of self-vindication.\u201d Kin-\ndred, 894 F. 2d, at 1480; accord, e.g., Fenner, 251 F. 3d, at\n788. For these courts, a reversal by a higher tribunal or\norder from a higher tribunal is such a triggering event, see\nBono v. Benov, 197 F. 3d 409, 417 (CA9 1999); Kindred,\nsupra, at 1479\u20131480, whereas the mere filing of an appli-\ncation or motion challenging a sentence is not, see Fenner,\nsupra, at 788\u2013789. The Eighth Circuit agrees and has\nconcluded that reversal by a higher tribunal is the only\nsuch triggering event. Savina v. Getty, 982 F. 2d 526\n(1992) (unpublished table decision). The Seventh Circuit,\non the other hand, has stated that it would apply the\npresumption even if the trial court imposed a higher sen-\ntence after itself granting a defendant\u2019s motion for a cor-\nrected sentence. United States v. Brick, 905 F. 2d 1092,\n1096 (1990) (citing United States v. Paul, 783 F. 2d 84, 88\n(CA7 1986)).\n   Our precedents have created this confusion, first by\nendorsing a presumption that is at odds with the respect\nwe ordinarily accord our Nation\u2019s judges, and then by\nchipping away at that presumption in a piecemeal fashion.\nWe should not abdicate our responsibility to clean up a\nmess of our making. Utah Highway Patrol Assn. v. Ameri-\ncan Atheists, Inc., 565 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 17\u201318).\nIt is time to revisit and clarify when, if ever, a presump-\ntion of judicial vindictiveness is appropriate.\n   True enough, the decision below is unpublished and\ntherefore lacks precedential force in the Fourth Circuit.\nMinor v. Bostwick Labs., Inc., 669 F. 3d 428, 433, n. 6\n(CA4 2012). But that in itself is yet another disturbing\naspect of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision, and yet another\nreason to grant review. The Court of Appeals had full\nbriefing and argument on Austin\u2019s claim of judicial vindic-\ntiveness. It analyzed the claim in a 39-page opinion writ-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nten over a dissent. By any standard\u2014and certainly by the\nFourth Circuit\u2019s own\u2014this decision should have been\npublished. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s Local Rule 36(a) provides\nthat opinions will be published only if they satisfy one or\nmore of five standards of publication. The opinion in this\ncase met at least three of them: it \u201cestablishe[d] . . . a rule\nof law within th[at] Circuit,\u201d \u201cinvolve[d] a legal issue of\ncontinuing public interest,\u201d and \u201ccreate[d] a conflict with a\ndecision in another circuit.\u201d Rules 36(a)(i), (ii), (v) (2015).\nIt is hard to imagine a reason that the Court of Appeals\nwould not have published this opinion except to avoid\ncreating binding law for the Circuit.\n                        *     *    *\n   The Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision warrants review. It orders\nthe District Court to grant the extraordinary writ of ha-\nbeas corpus on a questionable basis. It announces a rule\nthat is at odds with the decisions of this Court and Courts\nof Appeals. And, it does so in an unpublished opinion that\npreserves its ability to change course in the future. For\nthese reasons, we should have granted the petition for a\nwrit of certiorari.\n</pre>",
