Argued October 7, 2014\u2014Decided January 20, 2015\nSection 3 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n  of 2000 (RLUIPA) provides that \u201c[n]o government shall impose a sub\u00ad\n  stantial burden on the religious exercise\u201d of an institutionalized per\u00ad\n  son unless the government demonstrates that the burden \u201cis the least\n  restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest.\u201d\n  42 U. S. C. \u00a72000cc\u20131(a).\n     Petitioner is an Arkansas inmate and devout Muslim who wishes\n  to grow a \u00bd-inch beard in accordance with his religious beliefs. Re\u00ad\n  spondent Arkansas Department of Correction (Department) prohibits\n  its prisoners from growing beards, with the single exception that in\u00ad\n  mates with diagnosed skin conditions may grow \u00bc-inch beards. Peti\u00ad\n  tioner sought an exemption on religious grounds and, although he be\u00ad\n  lieves that his faith requires him not to trim his beard at all, he\n  proposed a compromise under which he would be allowed to maintain\n  a \u00bd-inch beard. Prison officials denied his request, and petitioner\n  sued in Federal District Court. At an evidentiary hearing before a\n  Magistrate Judge, Department witnesses testified that beards com\u00ad\n  promised prison safety because they could be used to hide contraband\n  and because an inmate could quickly shave his beard to disguise his\n  identity. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing petitioner\u2019s\n  complaint, emphasizing that prison officials are entitled to deference\n  on security matters and that the prison permitted petitioner to exer\u00ad\n  cise his religion in other ways. The District Court adopted the rec\u00ad\n  ommendation in full, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that\n  the Department had satisfied its burden of showing that the groom\u00ad\n  ing policy was the least restrictive means of furthering its compelling\n  security interests, and reiterating that courts should defer to prison\n2                             HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    officials on matters of security.\nHeld: The Department\u2019s grooming policy violates RLUIPA insofar as it\n prevents petitioner from growing a \u00bd-inch beard in accordance with\n his religious beliefs. Pp. 6\u201316.\n    (a) Under RLUIPA, the challenging party bears the initial burden\n of proving that his religious exercise is grounded in a sincerely held\n religious belief, see Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U. S.\n ___, ___, n. 28, and that the government\u2019s action substantially bur\u00ad\n dens his religious exercise. Here, petitioner\u2019s sincerity is not in dis\u00ad\n pute, and he easily satisfies the second obligation. The Department\u2019s\n policy forces him to choose between \u201cengag[ing] in conduct that seri\u00ad\n ously violates [his] religious belie[f],\u201d id., at ___, or contravening the\n grooming policy and risking disciplinary action. In reaching the op\u00ad\n posite conclusion, the District Court misunderstood the analysis that\n RLUIPA demands. First, the District Court erred by concluding that\n the grooming policy did not substantially burden petitioner\u2019s reli\u00ad\n gious exercise because he could practice his religion in other ways.\n Second, the District Court erroneously suggested that the burden on\n petitioner\u2019s religious exercise was slight because petitioner testified\n that his religion would \u201ccredit\u201d him for attempting to follow his reli\u00ad\n gious beliefs, even if that attempt proved unsuccessful. RLUIPA,\n however, applies to religious exercise regardless of whether it is\n \u201ccompelled.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20135(7)(A). Finally, the District Court improperly\n relied on petitioner\u2019s testimony that not all Muslims believe that men\n must grow beards. Even if petitioner\u2019s belief were idiosyncratic,\n RLUIPA\u2019s guarantees are \u201cnot limited to beliefs which are shared by\n all of the members of a religious sect.\u201d Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indi\u00ad\n ana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, 715\u2013716. Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) Once the challenging party satisfies his burden, the burden\n shifts to the government to show that substantially burdening the re\u00ad\n ligious exercise of the \u201cparticular claimant\u201d is \u201cthe least restrictive\n means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest.\u201d Hobby\n Lobby, supra, at ___; \u00a72000cc\u20131(a). The Department fails to show\n that enforcing its beard prohibition against petitioner furthers its\n compelling interests in preventing prisoners from hiding contraband\n and disguising their identities. Pp. 8\u201313.\n      (i) While the Department has a compelling interest in regulating\n contraband, its argument that this interest is compromised by allow\u00ad\n ing an inmate to grow a \u00bd-inch beard is unavailing, especially given\n the difficulty of hiding contraband in such a short beard and the lack\n of a corresponding policy regulating the length of hair on the head.\n RLUIPA does not permit the unquestioning deference required to ac\u00ad\n cept the Department\u2019s assessment. See Gonzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita\n Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418, 434. Even if the De\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

Here, the De\u00ad\n  partment fails to establish that its security concerns cannot be satis\u00ad\n  fied by simply searching a \u00bd-inch beard. Pp. 9\u201311.\n        (ii) Even if the Department\u2019s grooming policy furthers its compel\u00ad\n  ling interest in prisoner identification, its policy still violates RLUIPA\n  as applied in the present circumstances. As petitioner argues, re\u00ad\n  quiring inmates to be photographed both with and without beards\n  and then periodically thereafter is a less restrictive means of solving\n  the Department\u2019s identification concerns. The Department fails to\n  show why its prison system is so different from the many institutions\n  that allow facial hair that the dual-photo method cannot be employed\n  at its institutions. It also fails to show why the security risk present\u00ad\n  ed by a prisoner shaving a \u00bd-inch beard is so different from the risk\n  of a prisoner shaving a mustache, head hair, or \u00bc-inch beard.\n  Pp. 11\u201313.\n     (c) In addition to the Department\u2019s failure to prove that petitioner\u2019s\n  proposed alternatives would not sufficiently serve its security inter\u00ad\n  ests, the Department also fails to adequately explain the substantial\n  underinclusiveness of its policy, since it permits \u00bc-inch beards for\n  prisoners with medical conditions and more than \u00bd inch of hair on\n  the head. Its failure to pursue its proffered objectives with regard to\n  such \u201canalogous nonreligious conduct\u201d suggests that its interests\n  \u201ccould be achieved by narrower ordinances that burdened religion to\n  a far lesser degree.\u201d Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,\n  508 U. S. 520, 546. Nor does the Department explain why the vast\n  majority of States and the Federal Government can permit inmates\n  to grow \u00bd-inch beards, either for any reason or for religious reasons,\n  but it cannot. Such evidence requires a prison, at a minimum, to of\u00ad\n  fer persuasive reasons why it believes it must take a different course.\n  See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, 414, n. 14.

RAY HOBBS, \n\n      DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT \n\n            OF CORRECTION, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 20, 2015]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Petitioner Gregory Holt, also known as Abdul Maalik\nMuhammad, is an Arkansas inmate and a devout Muslim\nwho wishes to grow a 1\u20442-inch beard in accordance with his\nreligious beliefs. Petitioner\u2019s objection to shaving his\nbeard clashes with the Arkansas Department of Correc-\ntion\u2019s grooming policy, which prohibits inmates from\ngrowing beards unless they have a particular dermatologi-\ncal condition. We hold that the Department\u2019s policy, as\napplied in this case, violates the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat.\n803, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000cc et seq., which prohibits a state\nor local government from taking any action that substan-\ntially burdens the religious exercise of an institutionalized\nperson unless the government demonstrates that the\naction constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering\na compelling governmental interest.\n   We conclude in this case that the Department\u2019s policy\nsubstantially burdens petitioner\u2019s religious exercise.\n2                      HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAlthough we do not question the importance of the De-\npartment\u2019s interests in stopping the flow of contraband\nand facilitating prisoner identification, we do doubt\nwhether the prohibition against petitioner\u2019s beard furthers\nits compelling interest about contraband. And we con-\nclude that the Department has failed to show that its\npolicy is the least restrictive means of furthering its com-\npelling interests. We thus reverse the decision of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  Congress enacted RLUIPA and its sister statute, the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107\nStat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000bb et seq., \u201cin order to provide\nvery broad protection for religious liberty.\u201d Burwell v.\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 4). RFRA was enacted three years after our deci-\nsion in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of\nOre. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), which held that neu-\ntral, generally applicable laws that incidentally burden\nthe exercise of religion usually do not violate the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment. Id., at 878\u2013882.\nSmith largely repudiated the method of analysis used in\nprior free exercise cases like Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S.\n205 (1972), and Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963).\nIn those cases, we employed a balancing test that consid-\nered whether a challenged government action that sub-\nstantially burdened the exercise of religion was necessary\nto further a compelling state interest. See Yoder, supra, at\n214, 219; Sherbert, supra, at 403, 406.\n  Following our decision in Smith, Congress enacted\nRFRA in order to provide greater protection for religious\nexercise than is available under the First Amendment.\nSee Hobby Lobby, supra, at ___ \u2013 ___ (slip op., at 5\u20136).\nRFRA provides that \u201c[g]overnment shall not substantially\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nburden a person\u2019s exercise of religion even if the burden\nresults from a rule of general applicability,\u201d unless the\ngovernment \u201cdemonstrates that application of the burden\nto the person\u2013\u2013(1) is in furtherance of a compelling gov-\nernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means\nof furthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72000bb\u20131(a), (b). In making RFRA applicable to\nthe States and their subdivisions, Congress relied on\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, but in City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997), this Court held that\nRFRA exceeded Congress\u2019 powers under that provision.\nId., at 532\u2013536.\n   Congress responded to City of Boerne by enacting\nRLUIPA, which applies to the States and their subdivi-\nsions and invokes congressional authority under the\nSpending and Commerce Clauses. See \u00a72000cc\u20131(b).\nRLUIPA concerns two areas of government activity: Sec-\ntion 2 governs land-use regulation, \u00a72000cc; and Section\n3\u2014the provision at issue in this case\u2014governs religious\nexercise by institutionalized persons, \u00a72000cc\u20131. Section 3\nmirrors RFRA and provides that \u201c[n]o government shall\nimpose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a\nperson residing in or confined to an institution . . . even if\nthe burden results from a rule of general applicability,\nunless the government demonstrates that imposition of\nthe burden on that person\u2013\u2013(1) is in furtherance of a\ncompelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling govern-\nmental interest.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20131(a). RLUIPA thus allows\nprisoners \u201cto seek religious accommodations pursuant to\nthe same standard as set forth in RFRA.\u201d Gonzales v. O\nCentro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal, 546 U. S.\n418, 436 (2006).\n   Several provisions of RLUIPA underscore its expansive\nprotection for religious liberty. Congress defined \u201creli-\ngious exercise\u201d capaciously to include \u201cany exercise of\n4                     HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nreligion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a\nsystem of religious belief.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20135(7)(A). Congress\nmandated that this concept \u201cshall be construed in favor of\na broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum\nextent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the\nConstitution.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20133(g). And Congress stated that\nRLUIPA \u201cmay require a government to incur expenses in\nits own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden\non religious exercise.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20133(c). See Hobby Lobby,\nsupra, at ___ \u2013 ___, ___ (slip op., at 6\u20137, 43).\n                              B\n   Petitioner, as noted, is in the custody of the Arkansas\nDepartment of Correction and he objects on religious\ngrounds to the Department\u2019s grooming policy, which pro-\nvides that \u201c[n]o inmates will be permitted to wear facial\nhair other than a neatly trimmed mustache that does not\nextend beyond the corner of the mouth or over the lip.\u201d\nApp. to Brief for Petitioner 11a. The policy makes no\nexception for inmates who object on religious grounds, but\nit does contain an exemption for prisoners with medical\nneeds: \u201cMedical staff may prescribe that inmates with a\ndiagnosed dermatological problem may wear facial hair no\nlonger than one quarter of an inch.\u201d Ibid. The policy\nprovides that \u201c[f]ailure to abide by [the Department\u2019s]\ngrooming standards is grounds for disciplinary action.\u201d\nId., at 12a.\n   Petitioner sought permission to grow a beard and, al-\nthough he believes that his faith requires him not to trim\nhis beard at all, he proposed a \u201ccompromise\u201d under which\nhe would grow only a 1\u20442-inch beard. App. 164. Prison\nofficials denied his request, and the warden told him:\n\u201c[Y]ou will abide by [Arkansas Department of Correction]\npolicies and if you choose to disobey, you can suffer the\nconsequences.\u201d No. 5:11\u2013cv\u201300164 (ED Ark., July 21,\n2011), Doc. 13, p. 6 (Letter from Gaylon Lay to Gregory\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHolt (July 19, 2011)).\n   Petitioner filed a pro se complaint in Federal District\nCourt challenging the grooming policy under RLUIPA.\nWe refer to the respondent prison officials collectively as\nthe Department. In October 2011, the District Court\ngranted petitioner a preliminary injunction and remanded\nto a Magistrate Judge for an evidentiary hearing. At the\nhearing, the Department called two witnesses. Both\nexpressed the belief that inmates could hide contraband in\neven a 1\u20442-inch beard, but neither pointed to any instances\nin which this had been done in Arkansas or elsewhere.\nBoth witnesses also acknowledged that inmates could hide\nitems in many other places, such as in the hair on their\nheads or their clothing. In addition, one of the witnesses\u2014\nGaylon Lay, the warden of petitioner\u2019s prison\u2014\ntestified that a prisoner who escaped could change his\nappearance by shaving his beard, and that a prisoner\ncould shave his beard to disguise himself and enter a\nrestricted area of the prison. Neither witness, however,\nwas able to explain why these problems could not be ad-\ndressed by taking a photograph of an inmate without a\nbeard, a practice followed in other prison systems. Lay\nvoiced concern that the Department would be unable to\nmonitor the length of a prisoner\u2019s beard to ensure that it\ndid not exceed one-half inch, but he acknowledged that the\nDepartment kept track of the length of the beards of those\ninmates who are allowed to wear a 1\u20444-inch beard for medi-\ncal reasons.\n   As a result of the preliminary injunction, petitioner had\na short beard at the time of the hearing, and the Magis-\ntrate Judge commented: \u201cI look at your particular circum-\nstance and I say, you know, it\u2019s almost preposterous to\nthink that you could hide contraband in your beard.\u201d App.\n155. Nevertheless, the Magistrate Judge recommended\nthat the preliminary injunction be vacated and that peti-\ntioner\u2019s complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim\n6                      HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\non which relief can be granted. The Magistrate Judge\nemphasized that \u201cthe prison officials are entitled to defer-\nence,\u201d id., at 168, and that the grooming policy allowed\npetitioner to exercise his religion in other ways, such as by\npraying on a prayer rug, maintaining the diet required by\nhis faith, and observing religious holidays.\n  The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s\nrecommendation in full, and the Court of Appeals for the\nEighth Circuit affirmed in a brief per curiam opinion,\nholding that the Department had satisfied its burden of\nshowing that the grooming policy was the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering its compelling security interests. 509\nFed. Appx. 561 (2013). The Court of Appeals stated that\n\u201ccourts should ordinarily defer to [prison officials\u2019] expert\njudgment\u201d in security matters unless there is substantial\nevidence that a prison\u2019s response is exaggerated. Id., at\n562. And while acknowledging that other prisons allow\ninmates to maintain facial hair, the Eighth Circuit held\nthat this evidence \u201cdoes not outweigh deference owed to\n[the] expert judgment of prison officials who are more\nfamiliar with their own institutions.\u201d Ibid.\n  We entered an injunction pending resolution of petition-\ner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), and\nwe then granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                              II\n  Under RLUIPA, petitioner bore the initial burden of\nproving that the Department\u2019s grooming policy implicates\nhis religious exercise. RLUIPA protects \u201cany exercise of\nreligion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a\nsystem of religious belief,\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20135(7)(A), but, of course,\na prisoner\u2019s request for an accommodation must be sin-\ncerely based on a religious belief and not some other moti-\nvation, see Hobby Lobby, 573 U. S., at ___, n. 28 (slip op.,\nat 29, n. 28). Here, the religious exercise at issue is the\ngrowing of a beard, which petitioner believes is a dictate of\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

Petitioner easily satisfied that obliga-\ntion. The Department\u2019s grooming policy requires petition-\ner to shave his beard and thus to \u201cengage in conduct that\nseriously violates [his] religious beliefs.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 32). If petitioner contravenes that policy and grows\nhis beard, he will face serious disciplinary action. Because\nthe grooming policy puts petitioner to this choice, it sub-\nstantially burdens his religious exercise. Indeed, the\nDepartment does not argue otherwise.\n   The District Court reached the opposite conclusion, but\nits reasoning (adopted from the recommendation of the\nMagistrate Judge) misunderstood the analysis that\nRLUIPA demands. First, the District Court erred by\nconcluding that the grooming policy did not substantially\nburden petitioner\u2019s religious exercise because \u201che had been\nprovided a prayer rug and a list of distributors of Islamic\nmaterial, he was allowed to correspond with a religious\nadvisor, and was allowed to maintain the required diet\nand observe religious holidays.\u201d App. 177. In taking this\napproach, the District Court improperly imported a strand\nof reasoning from cases involving prisoners\u2019 First Amend-\nment rights. See, e.g., O\u2019Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482\nU. S. 342, 351\u2013352 (1987); see also Turner v. Safley, 482\nU. S. 78, 90 (1987). Under those cases, the availability of\nalternative means of practicing religion is a relevant\nconsideration, but RLUIPA provides greater protection.\nRLUIPA\u2019s \u201csubstantial burden\u201d inquiry asks whether the\ngovernment has substantially burdened religious exercise\n(here, the growing of a 1\u20442-inch beard), not whether the\nRLUIPA claimant is able to engage in other forms of\n8                     HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreligious exercise.\n   Second, the District Court committed a similar error in\nsuggesting that the burden on petitioner\u2019s religious exer-\ncise was slight because, according to petitioner\u2019s testi-\nmony, his religion would \u201ccredit\u201d him for attempting to\nfollow his religious beliefs, even if that attempt proved\nto be unsuccessful. RLUIPA, however, applies to an exer-\ncise of religion regardless of whether it is \u201ccompelled.\u201d\n\u00a72000cc\u20135(7)(A).\n   Finally, the District Court went astray when it relied on\npetitioner\u2019s testimony that not all Muslims believe that\nmen must grow beards. Petitioner\u2019s belief is by no means\nidiosyncratic. See Brief for Islamic Law Scholars as Amici\nCuriae 2 (\u201chadith requiring beards . . . are widely followed\nby observant Muslims across the various schools of Is-\nlam\u201d). But even if it were, the protection of RLUIPA, no\nless than the guarantee of the Free Exercise Clause, is\n\u201cnot limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the mem-\nbers of a religious sect.\u201d Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana\nEmployment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, 715\u2013716 (1981).\n                             III\n   Since petitioner met his burden of showing that the\nDepartment\u2019s grooming policy substantially burdened his\nexercise of religion, the burden shifted to the Department\nto show that its refusal to allow petitioner to grow a 1\u20442-\ninch beard \u201c(1) [was] in furtherance of a compelling gov-\nernmental interest; and (2) [was] the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental inter-\nest.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20131(a).\n   The Department argues that its grooming policy repre-\nsents the least restrictive means of furthering a \u201c \u2018broadly\nformulated interes[t],\u2019 \u201d see Hobby Lobby, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 39) (quoting O Centro, 546 U.

RLUIPA\nrequires us to \u201c \u2018scrutiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting\nspecific exemptions to particular religious claimants\u2019 \u201d and\n\u201cto look to the marginal interest in enforcing\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action in that particular context.\nHobby Lobby, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 39) (quoting O\nCentro, supra, at 431; alteration in original). In this case,\nthat means the enforcement of the Department\u2019s policy to\nprevent petitioner from growing a 1\u20442-inch beard.\n   The Department contends that enforcing this prohibi-\ntion is the least restrictive means of furthering prison\nsafety and security in two specific ways.\n                              A\n   The Department first claims that the no-beard policy\nprevents prisoners from hiding contraband. The Depart-\nment worries that prisoners may use their beards to con-\nceal all manner of prohibited items, including razors,\nneedles, drugs, and cellular phone subscriber identity\nmodule (SIM) cards.\n   We readily agree that the Department has a compelling\ninterest in staunching the flow of contraband into and\nwithin its facilities, but the argument that this interest\nwould be seriously compromised by allowing an inmate to\ngrow a 1\u20442-inch beard is hard to take seriously. As noted,\nthe Magistrate Judge observed that it was \u201calmost prepos-\nterous to think that [petitioner] could hide contraband\u201d in\nthe short beard he had grown at the time of the eviden-\ntiary hearing. App. 155. An item of contraband would\nhave to be very small indeed to be concealed by a 1\u20442-inch\n10                    HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbeard, and a prisoner seeking to hide an item in such a\nshort beard would have to find a way to prevent the item\nfrom falling out. Since the Department does not demand\nthat inmates have shaved heads or short crew cuts, it is\nhard to see why an inmate would seek to hide contraband\nin a 1\u20442-inch beard rather than in the longer hair on his\nhead.\n   Although the Magistrate Judge dismissed the possibility\nthat contraband could be hidden in a short beard, the\nMagistrate Judge, the District Court, and the Court of\nAppeals all thought that they were bound to defer to the\nDepartment\u2019s assertion that allowing petitioner to grow\nsuch a beard would undermine its interest in suppressing\ncontraband. RLUIPA, however, does not permit such\nunquestioning deference. RLUIPA, like RFRA, \u201cmakes\nclear that it is the obligation of the courts to consider\nwhether exceptions are required under the test set forth\nby Congress.\u201d O Centro, supra, at 434. That test requires\nthe Department not merely to explain why it denied the\nexemption but to prove that denying the exemption is the\nleast restrictive means of furthering a compelling govern-\nmental interest. Prison officials are experts in running\nprisons and evaluating the likely effects of altering prison\nrules, and courts should respect that expertise. But that\nrespect does not justify the abdication of the responsibil-\nity, conferred by Congress, to apply RLUIPA\u2019s rigorous\nstandard. And without a degree of deference that is tan-\ntamount to unquestioning acceptance, it is hard to swal-\nlow the argument that denying petitioner a 1\u20442-inch beard\nactually furthers the Department\u2019s interest in rooting out\ncontraband.\n   Even if the Department could make that showing, its\ncontraband argument would still fail because the Depart-\nment cannot show that forbidding very short beards is the\nleast restrictive means of preventing the concealment of\ncontraband.      \u201cThe least-restrictive-means standard is\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexceptionally demanding,\u201d and it requires the government\nto \u201csho[w] that it lacks other means of achieving its de-\nsired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the\nexercise of religion by the objecting part[y].\u201d Hobby Lobby,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 40). \u201c[I]f a less restrictive means\nis available for the Government to achieve its goals, the\nGovernment must use it.\u201d United States v. Playboy Enter\u00ad\ntainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 815 (2000).\n   The Department failed to establish that it could not\nsatisfy its security concerns by simply searching petition-\ner\u2019s beard. The Department already searches prisoners\u2019\nhair and clothing, and it presumably examines the 1\u20444-inch\nbeards of inmates with dermatological conditions. It has\noffered no sound reason why hair, clothing, and 1\u20444-inch\nbeards can be searched but 1\u20442-inch beards cannot. The\nDepartment suggests that requiring guards to search a\nprisoner\u2019s beard would pose a risk to the physical safety of\na guard if a razor or needle was concealed in the beard.\nBut that is no less true for searches of hair, clothing, and\n1\u20444-inch beards. And the Department has failed to prove\n\nthat it could not adopt the less restrictive alternative of\nhaving the prisoner run a comb through his beard. For all\nthese reasons, the Department\u2019s interest in eliminating\ncontraband cannot sustain its refusal to allow petitioner to\ngrow a 1\u20442-inch beard.\n                                B\n   The Department contends that its grooming policy is\nnecessary to further an additional compelling interest, i.e.,\npreventing prisoners from disguising their identities. The\nDepartment tells us that the no-beard policy allows secu-\nrity officers to identify prisoners quickly and accurately. It\nclaims that bearded inmates could shave their beards and\nchange their appearance in order to enter restricted areas\nwithin the prison, to escape, and to evade apprehension\nafter escaping.\n12                     HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   We agree that prisons have a compelling interest in the\nquick and reliable identification of prisoners, and we\nacknowledge that any alteration in a prisoner\u2019s appear-\nance, such as by shaving a beard, might, in the absence of\neffective countermeasures, have at least some effect on the\nability of guards or others to make a quick identification.\nBut even if we assume for present purposes that the De-\npartment\u2019s grooming policy sufficiently furthers its inter-\nest in the identification of prisoners, that policy still vio-\nlates RLUIPA as applied in the circumstances present\nhere. The Department contends that a prisoner who has a\nbeard when he is photographed for identification purposes\nmight confuse guards by shaving his beard. But as peti-\ntioner has argued, the Department could largely solve this\nproblem by requiring that all inmates be photographed\nwithout beards when first admitted to the facility and, if\nnecessary, periodically thereafter. Once that is done, an\ninmate like petitioner could be allowed to grow a short\nbeard and could be photographed again when the beard\nreached the 1\u20442-inch limit. Prison guards would then have\na bearded and clean-shaven photo to use in making identi-\nfications. In fact, the Department (like many other States,\nsee Brief for Petitioner 39) already has a policy of photo-\ngraphing a prisoner both when he enters an institution\nand when his \u201cappearance changes at any time during\n[his] incarceration.\u201d Arkansas Department of Correction,\nInmate Handbook 3\u20134 (rev. Jan. 2013).\n   The Department argues that the dual-photo method is\ninadequate because, even if it might help authorities\napprehend a bearded prisoner who escapes and then\nshaves his beard once outside the prison, this method is\nunlikely to assist guards when an inmate quickly shaves\nhis beard in order to alter his appearance within the\nprison. The Department contends that the identification\nconcern is particularly acute at petitioner\u2019s prison, where\ninmates live in barracks and work in fields. Counsel for\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Department suggested at oral argument that a pris-\noner could gain entry to a restricted area by shaving\nhis beard and swapping identification cards with an-\nother inmate while out in the fields. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u201330,\n39\u201343.\n   We are unpersuaded by these arguments for at least two\nreasons. First, the Department failed to show, in the face\nof petitioner\u2019s evidence, that its prison system is so differ-\nent from the many institutions that allow facial hair that\nthe dual-photo method cannot be employed at its institu-\ntions. Second, the Department failed to establish why the\nrisk that a prisoner will shave a 1\u20442-inch beard to disguise\nhimself is so great that 1\u20442-inch beards cannot be allowed,\neven though prisoners are allowed to grow mustaches,\nhead hair, or 1\u20444-inch beards for medical reasons. All of\nthese could also be shaved off at a moment\u2019s notice, but\nthe Department apparently does not think that this possi-\nbility raises a serious security concern.\n                             C\n  In addition to its failure to prove that petitioner\u2019s pro-\nposed alternatives would not sufficiently serve its security\ninterests, the Department has not provided an adequate\nresponse to two additional arguments that implicate the\nRLUIPA analysis.\n  First, the Department has not adequately demonstrated\nwhy its grooming policy is substantially underinclusive in\nat least two respects. Although the Department denied\npetitioner\u2019s request to grow a 1\u20442-inch beard, it permits\nprisoners with a dermatological condition to grow 1\u20444-inch\nbeards. The Department does this even though both\nbeards pose similar risks. And the Department permits\ninmates to grow more than a 1\u20442-inch of hair on their\nheads. With respect to hair length, the grooming policy\nprovides only that hair must be worn \u201cabove the ear\u201d and\n\u201cno longer in the back than the middle of the nape of the\n14                     HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nneck.\u201d App. to Brief for Petitioner 11a. Hair on the head\nis a more plausible place to hide contraband than a 1\u20442-inch\nbeard\u2014and the same is true of an inmate\u2019s clothing and\nshoes. Nevertheless, the Department does not require\ninmates to go about bald, barefoot, or naked. Although the\nDepartment\u2019s proclaimed objectives are to stop the flow of\ncontraband and to facilitate prisoner identification, \u201c[t]he\nproffered objectives are not pursued with respect to analo-\ngous nonreligious conduct,\u201d which suggests that \u201cthose\ninterests could be achieved by narrower ordinances that\nburdened religion to a far lesser degree.\u201d Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 546\n(1993).\n   In an attempt to demonstrate why its grooming policy is\nunderinclusive in these respects, the Department empha-\nsizes that petitioner\u2019s 1\u20442-inch beard is longer than the 1\u20444-\ninch beard allowed for medical reasons. But the Depart-\nment has failed to establish (and the District Court did not\nfind) that a 1\u20444-inch difference in beard length poses a\nmeaningful increase in security risk. The Department\nalso asserts that few inmates require beards for medical\nreasons while many may request beards for religious\nreasons. But the Department has not argued that denying\npetitioner an exemption is necessary to further a compel-\nling interest in cost control or program administration. At\nbottom, this argument is but another formulation of the\n\u201cclassic rejoinder of bureaucrats throughout history: If I\nmake an exception for you, I\u2019ll have to make one for every-\nbody, so no exceptions.\u201d O Centro, 546 U. S., at 436. We\nhave rejected a similar argument in analogous contexts,\nsee ibid.; Sherbert, 374 U. S., at 407, and we reject it again\ntoday.\n   Second, the Department failed to show, in the face of\npetitioner\u2019s evidence, why the vast majority of States and\nthe Federal Government permit inmates to grow 1\u20442-inch\nbeards, either for any reason or for religious reasons, but\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nit cannot. See Brief for Petitioner 24\u201325; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 28\u201329. \u201cWhile not necessarily\ncontrolling, the policies followed at other well-run institu-\ntions would be relevant to a determination of the need for\na particular type of restriction.\u201d Procunier v. Martinez,\n416 U. S. 396, 414, n. 14 (1974). That so many other\nprisons allow inmates to grow beards while ensuring\nprison safety and security suggests that the Department\ncould satisfy its security concerns through a means less\nrestrictive than denying petitioner the exemption he\nseeks.\n   We do not suggest that RLUIPA requires a prison to\ngrant a particular religious exemption as soon as a few\nother jurisdictions do so. But when so many prisons offer\nan accommodation, a prison must, at a minimum, offer\npersuasive reasons why it believes that it must take a\ndifferent course, and the Department failed to make that\nshowing here. Despite this, the courts below deferred to\nthese prison officials\u2019 mere say-so that they could not\naccommodate petitioner\u2019s request. RLUIPA, however,\ndemands much more. Courts must hold prisons to their\nstatutory burden, and they must not \u201cassume a plausible,\nless restrictive alternative would be ineffective.\u201d Playboy\nEntertainment, 529 U. S., at 824.\n   We emphasize that although RLUIPA provides substan-\ntial protection for the religious exercise of institutionalized\npersons, it also affords prison officials ample ability to\nmaintain security. We highlight three ways in which this\nis so. First, in applying RLUIPA\u2019s statutory standard,\ncourts should not blind themselves to the fact that the\nanalysis is conducted in the prison setting. Second, if an\ninstitution suspects that an inmate is using religious\nactivity to cloak illicit conduct, \u201cprison officials may ap-\npropriately question whether a prisoner\u2019s religiosity,\nasserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is\nauthentic.\u201d Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 725, n. 13\n16                    HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(2005). See also Hobby Lobby, 573 U. S., at ___, n. 28 (slip\nop., at 29, n. 28). Third, even if a claimant\u2019s religious\nbelief is sincere, an institution might be entitled to with-\ndraw an accommodation if the claimant abuses the exemp-\ntion in a manner that undermines the prison\u2019s compelling\ninterests.\n                           IV\n  In sum, we hold that the Department\u2019s grooming policy\nviolates RLUIPA insofar as it prevents petitioner from\ngrowing a 1\u20442-inch beard in accordance with his religious\nbeliefs. The judgment of the United States Court of Ap-\npeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

Rec. 16699 (2000)\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 103\u2013111, 10 (1993)).\n   Here, the Department\u2019s failure to demonstrate why the\nless restrictive policies petitioner identified in the course\nof the litigation were insufficient to achieve its compelling\ninterests\u2014not the Court\u2019s independent judgment concern-\ning the merit of these alternative approaches\u2014is ultimately\nfatal to the Department\u2019s position. The Court is appro-\npriately skeptical of the relationship between the De-\npartment\u2019s no-beard policy and its alleged compelling\ninterests because the Department offered little more than\nunsupported assertions in defense of its refusal of peti-\ntioner\u2019s requested religious accommodation.          RLUIPA\nrequires more.\n   One final point bears emphasis. RLUIPA requires\ninstitutions refusing an accommodation to demonstrate\nthat the policy it defends \u201cis the least restrictive means of\nfurthering [the alleged] compelling . . . interest[s].\u201d\n\u00a72000cc\u20131(a)(2); see also Washington v. Klem, 497 F. 3d\n272, 284 (CA3 2007) (\u201c[T]he phrase \u2018least restrictive\nmeans\u2019 is, by definition, a relative term. It necessarily\nimplies a comparison with other means\u201d); Couch v. Jabe,\n679 F. 3d 197, 203 (CA4 2012) (same).

Nor does it intimate that offi-\ncials must prove that they considered less restrictive\nalternatives at a particular point in time. Instead, the\nCourt correctly notes that the Department inadequately\nresponded to the less restrictive policies that petitioner\nbrought to the Department\u2019s attention during the course of\nthe litigation, including the more permissive policies used\nby the prisons in New York and California.

Argued October 7, 2014\u2014Decided January 20, 2015\nSection 3 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n  of 2000 (RLUIPA) provides that \u201c[n]o government shall impose a sub\u00ad\n  stantial burden on the religious exercise\u201d of an institutionalized per\u00ad\n  son unless the government demonstrates that the burden \u201cis the least\n  restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest.\u201d\n  42 U. S. C. \u00a72000cc\u20131(a).\n     Petitioner is an Arkansas inmate and devout Muslim who wishes\n  to grow a \u00bd-inch beard in accordance with his religious beliefs. Re\u00ad\n  spondent Arkansas Department of Correction (Department) prohibits\n  its prisoners from growing beards, with the single exception that in\u00ad\n  mates with diagnosed skin conditions may grow \u00bc-inch beards. Peti\u00ad\n  tioner sought an exemption on religious grounds and, although he be\u00ad\n  lieves that his faith requires him not to trim his beard at all, he\n  proposed a compromise under which he would be allowed to maintain\n  a \u00bd-inch beard. Prison officials denied his request, and petitioner\n  sued in Federal District Court. At an evidentiary hearing before a\n  Magistrate Judge, Department witnesses testified that beards com\u00ad\n  promised prison safety because they could be used to hide contraband\n  and because an inmate could quickly shave his beard to disguise his\n  identity. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing petitioner\u2019s\n  complaint, emphasizing that prison officials are entitled to deference\n  on security matters and that the prison permitted petitioner to exer\u00ad\n  cise his religion in other ways. The District Court adopted the rec\u00ad\n  ommendation in full, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that\n  the Department had satisfied its burden of showing that the groom\u00ad\n  ing policy was the least restrictive means of furthering its compelling\n  security interests, and reiterating that courts should defer to prison\n2                             HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    officials on matters of security.\nHeld: The Department\u2019s grooming policy violates RLUIPA insofar as it\n prevents petitioner from growing a \u00bd-inch beard in accordance with\n his religious beliefs. Pp. 6\u201316.\n    (a) Under RLUIPA, the challenging party bears the initial burden\n of proving that his religious exercise is grounded in a sincerely held\n religious belief, see Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U. S.\n ___, ___, n. 28, and that the government\u2019s action substantially bur\u00ad\n dens his religious exercise. Here, petitioner\u2019s sincerity is not in dis\u00ad\n pute, and he easily satisfies the second obligation. The Department\u2019s\n policy forces him to choose between \u201cengag[ing] in conduct that seri\u00ad\n ously violates [his] religious belie[f],\u201d id., at ___, or contravening the\n grooming policy and risking disciplinary action. In reaching the op\u00ad\n posite conclusion, the District Court misunderstood the analysis that\n RLUIPA demands. First, the District Court erred by concluding that\n the grooming policy did not substantially burden petitioner\u2019s reli\u00ad\n gious exercise because he could practice his religion in other ways.\n Second, the District Court erroneously suggested that the burden on\n petitioner\u2019s religious exercise was slight because petitioner testified\n that his religion would \u201ccredit\u201d him for attempting to follow his reli\u00ad\n gious beliefs, even if that attempt proved unsuccessful. RLUIPA,\n however, applies to religious exercise regardless of whether it is\n \u201ccompelled.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20135(7)(A). Finally, the District Court improperly\n relied on petitioner\u2019s testimony that not all Muslims believe that men\n must grow beards. Even if petitioner\u2019s belief were idiosyncratic,\n RLUIPA\u2019s guarantees are \u201cnot limited to beliefs which are shared by\n all of the members of a religious sect.\u201d Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indi\u00ad\n ana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, 715\u2013716. Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) Once the challenging party satisfies his burden, the burden\n shifts to the government to show that substantially burdening the re\u00ad\n ligious exercise of the \u201cparticular claimant\u201d is \u201cthe least restrictive\n means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest.\u201d Hobby\n Lobby, supra, at ___; \u00a72000cc\u20131(a). The Department fails to show\n that enforcing its beard prohibition against petitioner furthers its\n compelling interests in preventing prisoners from hiding contraband\n and disguising their identities. Pp. 8\u201313.\n      (i) While the Department has a compelling interest in regulating\n contraband, its argument that this interest is compromised by allow\u00ad\n ing an inmate to grow a \u00bd-inch beard is unavailing, especially given\n the difficulty of hiding contraband in such a short beard and the lack\n of a corresponding policy regulating the length of hair on the head.\n RLUIPA does not permit the unquestioning deference required to ac\u00ad\n cept the Department\u2019s assessment. See Gonzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita\n Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418, 434. Even if the De\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

Here, the De\u00ad\n  partment fails to establish that its security concerns cannot be satis\u00ad\n  fied by simply searching a \u00bd-inch beard. Pp. 9\u201311.\n        (ii) Even if the Department\u2019s grooming policy furthers its compel\u00ad\n  ling interest in prisoner identification, its policy still violates RLUIPA\n  as applied in the present circumstances. As petitioner argues, re\u00ad\n  quiring inmates to be photographed both with and without beards\n  and then periodically thereafter is a less restrictive means of solving\n  the Department\u2019s identification concerns. The Department fails to\n  show why its prison system is so different from the many institutions\n  that allow facial hair that the dual-photo method cannot be employed\n  at its institutions. It also fails to show why the security risk present\u00ad\n  ed by a prisoner shaving a \u00bd-inch beard is so different from the risk\n  of a prisoner shaving a mustache, head hair, or \u00bc-inch beard.\n  Pp. 11\u201313.\n     (c) In addition to the Department\u2019s failure to prove that petitioner\u2019s\n  proposed alternatives would not sufficiently serve its security inter\u00ad\n  ests, the Department also fails to adequately explain the substantial\n  underinclusiveness of its policy, since it permits \u00bc-inch beards for\n  prisoners with medical conditions and more than \u00bd inch of hair on\n  the head. Its failure to pursue its proffered objectives with regard to\n  such \u201canalogous nonreligious conduct\u201d suggests that its interests\n  \u201ccould be achieved by narrower ordinances that burdened religion to\n  a far lesser degree.\u201d Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,\n  508 U. S. 520, 546. Nor does the Department explain why the vast\n  majority of States and the Federal Government can permit inmates\n  to grow \u00bd-inch beards, either for any reason or for religious reasons,\n  but it cannot. Such evidence requires a prison, at a minimum, to of\u00ad\n  fer persuasive reasons why it believes it must take a different course.\n  See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, 414, n. 14.

Petitioner\u2019s objection to shaving his\nbeard clashes with the Arkansas Department of Correc-\ntion\u2019s grooming policy, which prohibits inmates from\ngrowing beards unless they have a particular dermatologi-\ncal condition. We hold that the Department\u2019s policy, as\napplied in this case, violates the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat.\n803, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000cc et seq., which prohibits a state\nor local government from taking any action that substan-\ntially burdens the religious exercise of an institutionalized\nperson unless the government demonstrates that the\naction constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering\na compelling governmental interest.\n   We conclude in this case that the Department\u2019s policy\nsubstantially burdens petitioner\u2019s religious exercise.\n2                      HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAlthough we do not question the importance of the De-\npartment\u2019s interests in stopping the flow of contraband\nand facilitating prisoner identification, we do doubt\nwhether the prohibition against petitioner\u2019s beard furthers\nits compelling interest about contraband. And we con-\nclude that the Department has failed to show that its\npolicy is the least restrictive means of furthering its com-\npelling interests. We thus reverse the decision of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  Congress enacted RLUIPA and its sister statute, the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107\nStat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000bb et seq., \u201cin order to provide\nvery broad protection for religious liberty.\u201d Burwell v.\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 4). RFRA was enacted three years after our deci-\nsion in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of\nOre. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), which held that neu-\ntral, generally applicable laws that incidentally burden\nthe exercise of religion usually do not violate the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment. Id., at 878\u2013882.\nSmith largely repudiated the method of analysis used in\nprior free exercise cases like Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S.\n205 (1972), and Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963).\nIn those cases, we employed a balancing test that consid-\nered whether a challenged government action that sub-\nstantially burdened the exercise of religion was necessary\nto further a compelling state interest. See Yoder, supra, at\n214, 219; Sherbert, supra, at 403, 406.\n  Following our decision in Smith, Congress enacted\nRFRA in order to provide greater protection for religious\nexercise than is available under the First Amendment.\nSee Hobby Lobby, supra, at ___ \u2013 ___ (slip op., at 5\u20136).\nRFRA provides that \u201c[g]overnment shall not substantially\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a72000bb\u20131(a), (b). In making RFRA applicable to\nthe States and their subdivisions, Congress relied on\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, but in City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997), this Court held that\nRFRA exceeded Congress\u2019 powers under that provision.\nId., at 532\u2013536.\n   Congress responded to City of Boerne by enacting\nRLUIPA, which applies to the States and their subdivi-\nsions and invokes congressional authority under the\nSpending and Commerce Clauses. See \u00a72000cc\u20131(b).\nRLUIPA concerns two areas of government activity: Sec-\ntion 2 governs land-use regulation, \u00a72000cc; and Section\n3\u2014the provision at issue in this case\u2014governs religious\nexercise by institutionalized persons, \u00a72000cc\u20131. Section 3\nmirrors RFRA and provides that \u201c[n]o government shall\nimpose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a\nperson residing in or confined to an institution . . . even if\nthe burden results from a rule of general applicability,\nunless the government demonstrates that imposition of\nthe burden on that person\u2013\u2013(1) is in furtherance of a\ncompelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling govern-\nmental interest.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20131(a). RLUIPA thus allows\nprisoners \u201cto seek religious accommodations pursuant to\nthe same standard as set forth in RFRA.\u201d Gonzales v. O\nCentro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal, 546 U. S.\n418, 436 (2006).\n   Several provisions of RLUIPA underscore its expansive\nprotection for religious liberty. Congress defined \u201creli-\ngious exercise\u201d capaciously to include \u201cany exercise of\n4                     HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nreligion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a\nsystem of religious belief.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20135(7)(A). Congress\nmandated that this concept \u201cshall be construed in favor of\na broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum\nextent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the\nConstitution.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20133(g). And Congress stated that\nRLUIPA \u201cmay require a government to incur expenses in\nits own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden\non religious exercise.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20133(c). See Hobby Lobby,\nsupra, at ___ \u2013 ___, ___ (slip op., at 6\u20137, 43).\n                              B\n   Petitioner, as noted, is in the custody of the Arkansas\nDepartment of Correction and he objects on religious\ngrounds to the Department\u2019s grooming policy, which pro-\nvides that \u201c[n]o inmates will be permitted to wear facial\nhair other than a neatly trimmed mustache that does not\nextend beyond the corner of the mouth or over the lip.\u201d\nApp. to Brief for Petitioner 11a. The policy makes no\nexception for inmates who object on religious grounds, but\nit does contain an exemption for prisoners with medical\nneeds: \u201cMedical staff may prescribe that inmates with a\ndiagnosed dermatological problem may wear facial hair no\nlonger than one quarter of an inch.\u201d Ibid. The policy\nprovides that \u201c[f]ailure to abide by [the Department\u2019s]\ngrooming standards is grounds for disciplinary action.\u201d\nId., at 12a.\n   Petitioner sought permission to grow a beard and, al-\nthough he believes that his faith requires him not to trim\nhis beard at all, he proposed a \u201ccompromise\u201d under which\nhe would grow only a 1\u20442-inch beard. App. 164. Prison\nofficials denied his request, and the warden told him:\n\u201c[Y]ou will abide by [Arkansas Department of Correction]\npolicies and if you choose to disobey, you can suffer the\nconsequences.\u201d No. 5:11\u2013cv\u201300164 (ED Ark., July 21,\n2011), Doc. 13, p. 6 (Letter from Gaylon Lay to Gregory\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

In October 2011, the District Court\ngranted petitioner a preliminary injunction and remanded\nto a Magistrate Judge for an evidentiary hearing. At the\nhearing, the Department called two witnesses. Both\nexpressed the belief that inmates could hide contraband in\neven a 1\u20442-inch beard, but neither pointed to any instances\nin which this had been done in Arkansas or elsewhere.\nBoth witnesses also acknowledged that inmates could hide\nitems in many other places, such as in the hair on their\nheads or their clothing. In addition, one of the witnesses\u2014\nGaylon Lay, the warden of petitioner\u2019s prison\u2014\ntestified that a prisoner who escaped could change his\nappearance by shaving his beard, and that a prisoner\ncould shave his beard to disguise himself and enter a\nrestricted area of the prison. Neither witness, however,\nwas able to explain why these problems could not be ad-\ndressed by taking a photograph of an inmate without a\nbeard, a practice followed in other prison systems. Lay\nvoiced concern that the Department would be unable to\nmonitor the length of a prisoner\u2019s beard to ensure that it\ndid not exceed one-half inch, but he acknowledged that the\nDepartment kept track of the length of the beards of those\ninmates who are allowed to wear a 1\u20444-inch beard for medi-\ncal reasons.\n   As a result of the preliminary injunction, petitioner had\na short beard at the time of the hearing, and the Magis-\ntrate Judge commented: \u201cI look at your particular circum-\nstance and I say, you know, it\u2019s almost preposterous to\nthink that you could hide contraband in your beard.\u201d App.\n155. Nevertheless, the Magistrate Judge recommended\nthat the preliminary injunction be vacated and that peti-\ntioner\u2019s complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim\n6                      HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\non which relief can be granted. The Magistrate Judge\nemphasized that \u201cthe prison officials are entitled to defer-\nence,\u201d id., at 168, and that the grooming policy allowed\npetitioner to exercise his religion in other ways, such as by\npraying on a prayer rug, maintaining the diet required by\nhis faith, and observing religious holidays.\n  The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s\nrecommendation in full, and the Court of Appeals for the\nEighth Circuit affirmed in a brief per curiam opinion,\nholding that the Department had satisfied its burden of\nshowing that the grooming policy was the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering its compelling security interests. 509\nFed. Appx. 561 (2013). The Court of Appeals stated that\n\u201ccourts should ordinarily defer to [prison officials\u2019] expert\njudgment\u201d in security matters unless there is substantial\nevidence that a prison\u2019s response is exaggerated. Id., at\n562. And while acknowledging that other prisons allow\ninmates to maintain facial hair, the Eighth Circuit held\nthat this evidence \u201cdoes not outweigh deference owed to\n[the] expert judgment of prison officials who are more\nfamiliar with their own institutions.\u201d Ibid.\n  We entered an injunction pending resolution of petition-\ner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), and\nwe then granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                              II\n  Under RLUIPA, petitioner bore the initial burden of\nproving that the Department\u2019s grooming policy implicates\nhis religious exercise. RLUIPA protects \u201cany exercise of\nreligion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a\nsystem of religious belief,\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20135(7)(A), but, of course,\na prisoner\u2019s request for an accommodation must be sin-\ncerely based on a religious belief and not some other moti-\nvation, see Hobby Lobby, 573 U.

S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhis religious faith, and the Department does not dispute\nthe sincerity of petitioner\u2019s belief.\n   In addition to showing that the relevant exercise of\nreligion is grounded in a sincerely held religious belief,\npetitioner also bore the burden of proving that the De-\npartment\u2019s grooming policy substantially burdened that\nexercise of religion. Petitioner easily satisfied that obliga-\ntion. The Department\u2019s grooming policy requires petition-\ner to shave his beard and thus to \u201cengage in conduct that\nseriously violates [his] religious beliefs.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 32). If petitioner contravenes that policy and grows\nhis beard, he will face serious disciplinary action. Because\nthe grooming policy puts petitioner to this choice, it sub-\nstantially burdens his religious exercise. Indeed, the\nDepartment does not argue otherwise.\n   The District Court reached the opposite conclusion, but\nits reasoning (adopted from the recommendation of the\nMagistrate Judge) misunderstood the analysis that\nRLUIPA demands. First, the District Court erred by\nconcluding that the grooming policy did not substantially\nburden petitioner\u2019s religious exercise because \u201che had been\nprovided a prayer rug and a list of distributors of Islamic\nmaterial, he was allowed to correspond with a religious\nadvisor, and was allowed to maintain the required diet\nand observe religious holidays.\u201d App. 177. In taking this\napproach, the District Court improperly imported a strand\nof reasoning from cases involving prisoners\u2019 First Amend-\nment rights. See, e.g., O\u2019Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482\nU. S. 342, 351\u2013352 (1987); see also Turner v. Safley, 482\nU. S. 78, 90 (1987). Under those cases, the availability of\nalternative means of practicing religion is a relevant\nconsideration, but RLUIPA provides greater protection.\nRLUIPA\u2019s \u201csubstantial burden\u201d inquiry asks whether the\ngovernment has substantially burdened religious exercise\n(here, the growing of a 1\u20442-inch beard), not whether the\nRLUIPA claimant is able to engage in other forms of\n8                     HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreligious exercise.\n   Second, the District Court committed a similar error in\nsuggesting that the burden on petitioner\u2019s religious exer-\ncise was slight because, according to petitioner\u2019s testi-\nmony, his religion would \u201ccredit\u201d him for attempting to\nfollow his religious beliefs, even if that attempt proved\nto be unsuccessful. RLUIPA, however, applies to an exer-\ncise of religion regardless of whether it is \u201ccompelled.\u201d\n\u00a72000cc\u20135(7)(A).\n   Finally, the District Court went astray when it relied on\npetitioner\u2019s testimony that not all Muslims believe that\nmen must grow beards. Petitioner\u2019s belief is by no means\nidiosyncratic. See Brief for Islamic Law Scholars as Amici\nCuriae 2 (\u201chadith requiring beards . . . are widely followed\nby observant Muslims across the various schools of Is-\nlam\u201d). But even if it were, the protection of RLUIPA, no\nless than the guarantee of the Free Exercise Clause, is\n\u201cnot limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the mem-\nbers of a religious sect.\u201d Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana\nEmployment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, 715\u2013716 (1981).\n                             III\n   Since petitioner met his burden of showing that the\nDepartment\u2019s grooming policy substantially burdened his\nexercise of religion, the burden shifted to the Department\nto show that its refusal to allow petitioner to grow a 1\u20442-\ninch beard \u201c(1) [was] in furtherance of a compelling gov-\nernmental interest; and (2) [was] the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental inter-\nest.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20131(a).\n   The Department argues that its grooming policy repre-\nsents the least restrictive means of furthering a \u201c \u2018broadly\nformulated interes[t],\u2019 \u201d see Hobby Lobby, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 39) (quoting O Centro, 546 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 39) (quoting O Centro,\nsupra, at 430\u2013431 (quoting \u00a72000bb\u20131(b))). RLUIPA\nrequires us to \u201c \u2018scrutiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting\nspecific exemptions to particular religious claimants\u2019 \u201d and\n\u201cto look to the marginal interest in enforcing\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action in that particular context.\nHobby Lobby, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 39) (quoting O\nCentro, supra, at 431; alteration in original). In this case,\nthat means the enforcement of the Department\u2019s policy to\nprevent petitioner from growing a 1\u20442-inch beard.\n   The Department contends that enforcing this prohibi-\ntion is the least restrictive means of furthering prison\nsafety and security in two specific ways.\n                              A\n   The Department first claims that the no-beard policy\nprevents prisoners from hiding contraband. The Depart-\nment worries that prisoners may use their beards to con-\nceal all manner of prohibited items, including razors,\nneedles, drugs, and cellular phone subscriber identity\nmodule (SIM) cards.\n   We readily agree that the Department has a compelling\ninterest in staunching the flow of contraband into and\nwithin its facilities, but the argument that this interest\nwould be seriously compromised by allowing an inmate to\ngrow a 1\u20442-inch beard is hard to take seriously. As noted,\nthe Magistrate Judge observed that it was \u201calmost prepos-\nterous to think that [petitioner] could hide contraband\u201d in\nthe short beard he had grown at the time of the eviden-\ntiary hearing. App. 155. An item of contraband would\nhave to be very small indeed to be concealed by a 1\u20442-inch\n10                    HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbeard, and a prisoner seeking to hide an item in such a\nshort beard would have to find a way to prevent the item\nfrom falling out. Since the Department does not demand\nthat inmates have shaved heads or short crew cuts, it is\nhard to see why an inmate would seek to hide contraband\nin a 1\u20442-inch beard rather than in the longer hair on his\nhead.\n   Although the Magistrate Judge dismissed the possibility\nthat contraband could be hidden in a short beard, the\nMagistrate Judge, the District Court, and the Court of\nAppeals all thought that they were bound to defer to the\nDepartment\u2019s assertion that allowing petitioner to grow\nsuch a beard would undermine its interest in suppressing\ncontraband. RLUIPA, however, does not permit such\nunquestioning deference. RLUIPA, like RFRA, \u201cmakes\nclear that it is the obligation of the courts to consider\nwhether exceptions are required under the test set forth\nby Congress.\u201d O Centro, supra, at 434. That test requires\nthe Department not merely to explain why it denied the\nexemption but to prove that denying the exemption is the\nleast restrictive means of furthering a compelling govern-\nmental interest. Prison officials are experts in running\nprisons and evaluating the likely effects of altering prison\nrules, and courts should respect that expertise. But that\nrespect does not justify the abdication of the responsibil-\nity, conferred by Congress, to apply RLUIPA\u2019s rigorous\nstandard. And without a degree of deference that is tan-\ntamount to unquestioning acceptance, it is hard to swal-\nlow the argument that denying petitioner a 1\u20442-inch beard\nactually furthers the Department\u2019s interest in rooting out\ncontraband.\n   Even if the Department could make that showing, its\ncontraband argument would still fail because the Depart-\nment cannot show that forbidding very short beards is the\nleast restrictive means of preventing the concealment of\ncontraband.      \u201cThe least-restrictive-means standard is\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexceptionally demanding,\u201d and it requires the government\nto \u201csho[w] that it lacks other means of achieving its de-\nsired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the\nexercise of religion by the objecting part[y].\u201d Hobby Lobby,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 40). \u201c[I]f a less restrictive means\nis available for the Government to achieve its goals, the\nGovernment must use it.\u201d United States v. Playboy Enter\u00ad\ntainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 815 (2000).\n   The Department failed to establish that it could not\nsatisfy its security concerns by simply searching petition-\ner\u2019s beard. The Department already searches prisoners\u2019\nhair and clothing, and it presumably examines the 1\u20444-inch\nbeards of inmates with dermatological conditions. It has\noffered no sound reason why hair, clothing, and 1\u20444-inch\nbeards can be searched but 1\u20442-inch beards cannot. The\nDepartment suggests that requiring guards to search a\nprisoner\u2019s beard would pose a risk to the physical safety of\na guard if a razor or needle was concealed in the beard.\nBut that is no less true for searches of hair, clothing, and\n1\u20444-inch beards. And the Department has failed to prove\n\nthat it could not adopt the less restrictive alternative of\nhaving the prisoner run a comb through his beard. For all\nthese reasons, the Department\u2019s interest in eliminating\ncontraband cannot sustain its refusal to allow petitioner to\ngrow a 1\u20442-inch beard.\n                                B\n   The Department contends that its grooming policy is\nnecessary to further an additional compelling interest, i.e.,\npreventing prisoners from disguising their identities. The\nDepartment tells us that the no-beard policy allows secu-\nrity officers to identify prisoners quickly and accurately. It\nclaims that bearded inmates could shave their beards and\nchange their appearance in order to enter restricted areas\nwithin the prison, to escape, and to evade apprehension\nafter escaping.\n12                     HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   We agree that prisons have a compelling interest in the\nquick and reliable identification of prisoners, and we\nacknowledge that any alteration in a prisoner\u2019s appear-\nance, such as by shaving a beard, might, in the absence of\neffective countermeasures, have at least some effect on the\nability of guards or others to make a quick identification.\nBut even if we assume for present purposes that the De-\npartment\u2019s grooming policy sufficiently furthers its inter-\nest in the identification of prisoners, that policy still vio-\nlates RLUIPA as applied in the circumstances present\nhere. The Department contends that a prisoner who has a\nbeard when he is photographed for identification purposes\nmight confuse guards by shaving his beard. But as peti-\ntioner has argued, the Department could largely solve this\nproblem by requiring that all inmates be photographed\nwithout beards when first admitted to the facility and, if\nnecessary, periodically thereafter. Once that is done, an\ninmate like petitioner could be allowed to grow a short\nbeard and could be photographed again when the beard\nreached the 1\u20442-inch limit. Prison guards would then have\na bearded and clean-shaven photo to use in making identi-\nfications. In fact, the Department (like many other States,\nsee Brief for Petitioner 39) already has a policy of photo-\ngraphing a prisoner both when he enters an institution\nand when his \u201cappearance changes at any time during\n[his] incarceration.\u201d Arkansas Department of Correction,\nInmate Handbook 3\u20134 (rev. Jan. 2013).\n   The Department argues that the dual-photo method is\ninadequate because, even if it might help authorities\napprehend a bearded prisoner who escapes and then\nshaves his beard once outside the prison, this method is\nunlikely to assist guards when an inmate quickly shaves\nhis beard in order to alter his appearance within the\nprison. The Department contends that the identification\nconcern is particularly acute at petitioner\u2019s prison, where\ninmates live in barracks and work in fields. Counsel for\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Department suggested at oral argument that a pris-\noner could gain entry to a restricted area by shaving\nhis beard and swapping identification cards with an-\nother inmate while out in the fields. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u201330,\n39\u201343.\n   We are unpersuaded by these arguments for at least two\nreasons. First, the Department failed to show, in the face\nof petitioner\u2019s evidence, that its prison system is so differ-\nent from the many institutions that allow facial hair that\nthe dual-photo method cannot be employed at its institu-\ntions. Second, the Department failed to establish why the\nrisk that a prisoner will shave a 1\u20442-inch beard to disguise\nhimself is so great that 1\u20442-inch beards cannot be allowed,\neven though prisoners are allowed to grow mustaches,\nhead hair, or 1\u20444-inch beards for medical reasons. All of\nthese could also be shaved off at a moment\u2019s notice, but\nthe Department apparently does not think that this possi-\nbility raises a serious security concern.\n                             C\n  In addition to its failure to prove that petitioner\u2019s pro-\nposed alternatives would not sufficiently serve its security\ninterests, the Department has not provided an adequate\nresponse to two additional arguments that implicate the\nRLUIPA analysis.\n  First, the Department has not adequately demonstrated\nwhy its grooming policy is substantially underinclusive in\nat least two respects. Although the Department denied\npetitioner\u2019s request to grow a 1\u20442-inch beard, it permits\nprisoners with a dermatological condition to grow 1\u20444-inch\nbeards. The Department does this even though both\nbeards pose similar risks. And the Department permits\ninmates to grow more than a 1\u20442-inch of hair on their\nheads. With respect to hair length, the grooming policy\nprovides only that hair must be worn \u201cabove the ear\u201d and\n\u201cno longer in the back than the middle of the nape of the\n14                     HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nneck.\u201d App. to Brief for Petitioner 11a. Hair on the head\nis a more plausible place to hide contraband than a 1\u20442-inch\nbeard\u2014and the same is true of an inmate\u2019s clothing and\nshoes. Nevertheless, the Department does not require\ninmates to go about bald, barefoot, or naked. Although the\nDepartment\u2019s proclaimed objectives are to stop the flow of\ncontraband and to facilitate prisoner identification, \u201c[t]he\nproffered objectives are not pursued with respect to analo-\ngous nonreligious conduct,\u201d which suggests that \u201cthose\ninterests could be achieved by narrower ordinances that\nburdened religion to a far lesser degree.\u201d Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 546\n(1993).\n   In an attempt to demonstrate why its grooming policy is\nunderinclusive in these respects, the Department empha-\nsizes that petitioner\u2019s 1\u20442-inch beard is longer than the 1\u20444-\ninch beard allowed for medical reasons. But the Depart-\nment has failed to establish (and the District Court did not\nfind) that a 1\u20444-inch difference in beard length poses a\nmeaningful increase in security risk. The Department\nalso asserts that few inmates require beards for medical\nreasons while many may request beards for religious\nreasons. But the Department has not argued that denying\npetitioner an exemption is necessary to further a compel-\nling interest in cost control or program administration. At\nbottom, this argument is but another formulation of the\n\u201cclassic rejoinder of bureaucrats throughout history: If I\nmake an exception for you, I\u2019ll have to make one for every-\nbody, so no exceptions.\u201d O Centro, 546 U. S., at 436. We\nhave rejected a similar argument in analogous contexts,\nsee ibid.; Sherbert, 374 U. S., at 407, and we reject it again\ntoday.\n   Second, the Department failed to show, in the face of\npetitioner\u2019s evidence, why the vast majority of States and\nthe Federal Government permit inmates to grow 1\u20442-inch\nbeards, either for any reason or for religious reasons, but\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nit cannot. See Brief for Petitioner 24\u201325; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 28\u201329. \u201cWhile not necessarily\ncontrolling, the policies followed at other well-run institu-\ntions would be relevant to a determination of the need for\na particular type of restriction.\u201d Procunier v. Martinez,\n416 U. S. 396, 414, n. 14 (1974). That so many other\nprisons allow inmates to grow beards while ensuring\nprison safety and security suggests that the Department\ncould satisfy its security concerns through a means less\nrestrictive than denying petitioner the exemption he\nseeks.\n   We do not suggest that RLUIPA requires a prison to\ngrant a particular religious exemption as soon as a few\nother jurisdictions do so. But when so many prisons offer\nan accommodation, a prison must, at a minimum, offer\npersuasive reasons why it believes that it must take a\ndifferent course, and the Department failed to make that\nshowing here. Despite this, the courts below deferred to\nthese prison officials\u2019 mere say-so that they could not\naccommodate petitioner\u2019s request. RLUIPA, however,\ndemands much more. Courts must hold prisons to their\nstatutory burden, and they must not \u201cassume a plausible,\nless restrictive alternative would be ineffective.\u201d Playboy\nEntertainment, 529 U. S., at 824.\n   We emphasize that although RLUIPA provides substan-\ntial protection for the religious exercise of institutionalized\npersons, it also affords prison officials ample ability to\nmaintain security. We highlight three ways in which this\nis so. First, in applying RLUIPA\u2019s statutory standard,\ncourts should not blind themselves to the fact that the\nanalysis is conducted in the prison setting. Second, if an\ninstitution suspects that an inmate is using religious\nactivity to cloak illicit conduct, \u201cprison officials may ap-\npropriately question whether a prisoner\u2019s religiosity,\nasserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is\nauthentic.\u201d Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 725, n. 13\n16                    HOLT v. HOBBS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(2005). See also Hobby Lobby, 573 U. S., at ___, n. 28 (slip\nop., at 29, n. 28). Third, even if a claimant\u2019s religious\nbelief is sincere, an institution might be entitled to with-\ndraw an accommodation if the claimant abuses the exemp-\ntion in a manner that undermines the prison\u2019s compelling\ninterests.\n                           IV\n  In sum, we hold that the Department\u2019s grooming policy\nviolates RLUIPA insofar as it prevents petitioner from\ngrowing a 1\u20442-inch beard in accordance with his religious\nbeliefs. The judgment of the United States Court of Ap-\npeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

No. 103\u2013111, 10 (1993)).\n   Here, the Department\u2019s failure to demonstrate why the\nless restrictive policies petitioner identified in the course\nof the litigation were insufficient to achieve its compelling\ninterests\u2014not the Court\u2019s independent judgment concern-\ning the merit of these alternative approaches\u2014is ultimately\nfatal to the Department\u2019s position. The Court is appro-\npriately skeptical of the relationship between the De-\npartment\u2019s no-beard policy and its alleged compelling\ninterests because the Department offered little more than\nunsupported assertions in defense of its refusal of peti-\ntioner\u2019s requested religious accommodation.          RLUIPA\nrequires more.\n   One final point bears emphasis. RLUIPA requires\ninstitutions refusing an accommodation to demonstrate\nthat the policy it defends \u201cis the least restrictive means of\nfurthering [the alleged] compelling . . . interest[s].\u201d\n\u00a72000cc\u20131(a)(2); see also Washington v. Klem, 497 F. 3d\n272, 284 (CA3 2007) (\u201c[T]he phrase \u2018least restrictive\nmeans\u2019 is, by definition, a relative term. It necessarily\nimplies a comparison with other means\u201d); Couch v. Jabe,\n679 F. 3d 197, 203 (CA4 2012) (same). But nothing in the\nCourt\u2019s opinion suggests that prison officials must refute\nevery conceivable option to satisfy RLUIPA\u2019s least restric-\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\ntive means requirement. Nor does it intimate that offi-\ncials must prove that they considered less restrictive\nalternatives at a particular point in time. Instead, the\nCourt correctly notes that the Department inadequately\nresponded to the less restrictive policies that petitioner\nbrought to the Department\u2019s attention during the course of\nthe litigation, including the more permissive policies used\nby the prisons in New York and California. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Wilgus, 638 F. 3d 1274, 1289 (CA10 2011)\n(observing in the analogous context of the Religious Free-\ndom Restoration Act of 1993 that the government need not\n\u201cdo the impossible\u2014refute each and every conceivable\nalternative regulation scheme\u201d but need only \u201crefute the\nalternative schemes offered by the challenger\u201d).\n   Because I understand the Court\u2019s opinion to be con-\nsistent with the foregoing, I join it.\n</pre>",
