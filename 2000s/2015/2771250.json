DON ROPER, WARDEN\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 14\u20136873. Decided January 20, 2015\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Petitioner Mark Christeson\u2019s first federal habeas peti-\ntion was dismissed as untimely. Because his appointed\nattorneys\u2014who had missed the filing deadline\u2014could not\nbe expected to argue that Christeson was entitled to the\nequitable tolling of the statute of limitations, Christeson\nrequested substitute counsel who would not be laboring\nunder a conflict of interest. The District Court denied the\nmotion, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\nsummarily affirmed. In so doing, these courts contra-\nvened our decision in Martel v. Clair, 565 U. S. ___ (2012).\nChristeson\u2019s petition for certiorari is therefore granted,\nthe judgment of the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings.\n                              I\n  In 1999, a jury convicted Christeson of three counts of\ncapital murder. It returned verdicts of death on all\nthree counts. The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed\nChristeson\u2019s conviction and sentence in 2001, see State v.\nChristeson, 50 S. W. 3d 251 (en banc), and affirmed the\ndenial of his postconviction motion for relief in 2004, see\nChristeson v. State, 131 S. W. 3d 796 (en banc).\n  Under the strict 1-year statute of limitations imposed by\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1), Christeson\u2019s federal\nhabeas petition was due on April 10, 2005. Nine months\nbefore this critical deadline, the District Court appointed\nattorneys Phil Horwitz and Eric Butts to represent\n2                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nChristeson in his federal habeas proceedings. See 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73599(a)(2) (providing for appointment of counsel\nfor state death row inmates).\n   Horwitz and Butts, as they have subsequently acknowl-\nedged, failed to meet with Christeson until more than six\nweeks after his petition was due. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n93a. There is no evidence that they communicated with\ntheir client at all during this time. They finally filed the\npetition on August 5, 2005\u2014117 days too late. They have\nsince claimed that their failure to meet with their client\nand timely file his habeas petition resulted from a simple\nmiscalculation of the AEDPA limitations period (and in\ndefending themselves, they may have disclosed privileged\nclient communications). See id., at 90a\u201392a, 135a. But a\nlegal ethics expert, reviewing counsel\u2019s handling of\nChristeson\u2019s habeas petition, stated in a report submitted\nto the District Court: \u201c[I]f this was not abandonment, I am\nnot sure what would be.\u201d Id., at 132a.\n   The District Court dismissed the petition as untimely,\nand the Court of Appeals denied Christeson\u2019s application\nfor a certificate of appealability. Christeson, who appears\nto have severe cognitive disabilities that lead him to rely\nentirely on his attorneys, may not have been aware of this\ndismissal. See id., at 229a, 231a, 237a.\n   Nearly seven years later, Horwitz and Butts contacted\nattorneys Jennifer Merrigan and Joseph Perkovich to\ndiscuss how to proceed in Christeson\u2019s case. Merrigan and\nPerkovich immediately noticed a glaring problem.\nChristeson\u2019s only hope for securing review of the merits of\nhis habeas claims was to file a motion under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 60(b) seeking to reopen final judgment\non the ground that AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations should\nhave been equitably tolled. But Horwitz and Butts could\nnot be expected to file such a motion on Christeson\u2019s be-\nhalf, as any argument for equitable tolling would be prem-\nised on their own malfeasance in failing to file timely the\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)               3\n\n                            Per Curiam\n\nhabeas petition. While initially receptive to Merrigan and\nPerkovich\u2019s assistance, Horwitz and Butts soon refused to\nallow outside counsel access to their files. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 345a.\n   On May 23, 2014, Merrigan and Perkovich filed a mo-\ntion for substitution of counsel. The District Court denied\nthe motion, explaining only that it was \u201cnot in\n[Christeson\u2019s] best interest to be represented by attorneys\nlocated in New York and Pennsylvania,\u201d as Merrigan and\nPerkovich are. Id., at 169a. The District Court did not\naddress Merrigan and Perkovich\u2019s offer to forgo all fees\nand expenses associated with travel to Missouri, nor did it\naddress the possibility of appointing other attorneys for\nChristeson.\n   Christeson appealed. The Eighth Circuit dismissed for\nlack of jurisdiction, apparently reasoning that Merrigan\nand Perkovich were not authorized to file an appeal on\nChristeson\u2019s behalf.1 On September 19, 2014, while this\nappeal was still pending before the Eighth Circuit, the\nMissouri Supreme Court issued a warrant of execution\nsetting October 29, 2014, as Christeson\u2019s execution date.\n   After further proceedings not relevant here, Merrigan\nand Perkovich again filed a motion for substitution of\ncounsel on Christeson\u2019s behalf. The District Court again\ndenied the motion.        Explaining that substitution of\n\u201cfederally-appointed counsel is warranted only when it would\nserve the interests of justice,\u201d it offered four reasons for its\ndecision. Order in No. 04\u2013CV\u201308004 (WD Mo., Oct. 22,\n2014), p. 1, App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a (quoting Lambrix v.\nSecretary, Florida Dept. of Corrections, 756 F. 3d 1246,\n1259 (CA11 2014); internal quotation marks omitted).\nFirst, it deemed the motion to be untimely because it \u201cwas\nnot filed until 2014, and shortly before [Christeson\u2019s]\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 Christeson has since submitted a signed retainer agreement with\n\nMerrigan and Perkovich that removes any doubt on that score.\n4                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nexecution date.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a. Second, it\nobserved that Horwitz and Butts had not \u201cabandoned\u201d\nChristeson, as they had recently appeared on his behalf in\na class-action lawsuit challenging Missouri\u2019s lethal injec-\ntion protocol. Id., at 376a. Third, it noted that although\nHorwitz and Butts had represented Christeson before the\nEighth Circuit, that court had not appointed substitute\ncounsel. Ibid. Fourth and finally, the District Court\nexpressed its belief that granting the motion would set \u201can\nuntenable precedent\u201d by allowing outside attorneys to seek\n\u201c \u2018abusive\u2019 \u201d delays in capital cases. Ibid.\n    Christeson again appealed. This time, the Eighth Cir-\ncuit summarily affirmed the District Court\u2019s order. We\nstayed Christeson\u2019s execution, see post, p. ____, and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n   Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a73599 \u201centitles indigent defendants to\nthe appointment of counsel in capital cases, including\nhabeas corpus proceedings.\u201d Martel v. Clair, 565 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1). \u201cBy providing indigent capital defend-\nants with a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel in\nthese proceedings, Congress has recognized that federal\nhabeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in\npromoting fundamental fairness in the imposition of the\ndeath penalty.\u201d McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 859\n(1994). Congress has not, however, conferred capital\nhabeas petitioners with the right to counsel of their choice.\nInstead, the statute leaves it to the court to select a\nproperly qualified attorney. See \u00a7\u00a73599(a)\u2013(d). But the\nstatute contemplates that a court may \u201creplace\u201d appointed\ncounsel with \u201csimilarly qualified counsel . . . upon motion\u201d\nof the petitioner. \u00a73599(e).\n   We addressed the standard that a court should apply in\nconsidering such a motion in Clair. We rejected the ar-\ngument that substitution of an appointed lawyer is war-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nranted in only three situations: \u201cwhen the lawyer lacks the\nqualifications necessary for appointment . . . ; when he has\na disabling conflict of interest; or when he has completely\nabandoned the client.\u201d 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, we adopted a\nbroader standard, holding that a motion for substitution\nshould be granted when it is in the \u201c \u2018interests of justice.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 13). We further explained that the\nfactors a court of appeals should consider in determining\nwhether a district court abused its discretion in denying\nsuch a motion \u201cinclude: the timeliness of the motion; the\nadequacy of the district court\u2019s inquiry into the defend-\nant\u2019s complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint,\nincluding the extent of the conflict or breakdown in com-\nmunication between lawyer and client (and the client\u2019s\nresponsibility, if any, for that conflict).\u201d Ibid.\n   The District Court here properly recognized that its\nconsideration of Christeson\u2019s motion for substitution was\ngoverned by Clair\u2019s \u201cinterests of justice\u201d standard. But its\ndenial of his motion did not adequately account for all of\nthe factors we set forth in Clair.\n   The court\u2019s principal error was its failure to\nacknowledge Horwitz and Butts\u2019 conflict of interest. Toll-\ning based on counsel\u2019s failure to satisfy AEDPA\u2019s statute\nof limitations is available only for \u201cserious instances of\nattorney misconduct.\u201d Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631,\n651\u2013652 (2010). Advancing such a claim would have\nrequired Horwitz and Butts to denigrate their own per-\nformance. Counsel cannot reasonably be expected to make\nsuch an argument, which threatens their professional\nreputation and livelihood. See Restatement (Third) of\nLaw Governing Lawyers \u00a7125 (1998). Thus, as we ob-\nserved in a similar context in Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S.\n___, ___, n. 8 (2012) (slip op., at 17, n. 8), a \u201csignificant\nconflict of interest\u201d arises when an attorney\u2019s \u201cinterest in\navoiding damage to [his] own reputation\u201d is at odds with\n6                   CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nhis client\u2019s \u201cstrongest argument\u2014i.e., that his attorneys\nhad abandoned him.\u201d\n  Indeed, to their credit, Horwitz and Butts acknowledged\nthe nature of their conflict. Shortly before the first motion\nfor substitution was filed, they provided an update to the\nMissouri Supreme Court on the status of Christeson\u2019s\ncollateral proceedings. In it, they stated:\n     \u201cBecause counsel herein would be essential witnesses\n     to factual questions indispensable to a Holland in-\n     quiry, there may be ethical and legal conflicts that\n     would arise that would prohibit counsel from litigat-\n     ing issues that would support a Holland claim. Un-\n     waivable ethical and legal conflicts prohibit under-\n     signed counsel from litigating these issues in any way.\n     See Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475, 485\u2013486\n     (1978). Conflict free counsel must be appointed to\n     present the equitable tolling question in federal dis-\n     trict court.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a\u201349a.\n   Yet, in their response to the District Court\u2019s order to\naddress the substitution motion, Horwitz and Butts char-\nacterized the potential arguments in favor of equitable\ntolling as \u201cludicrous,\u201d and asserted that they had \u201ca legal\nbasis and rationale for the [erroneous] calculation of the\nfiling date.\u201d Id., at 86a, 90a. While not every case in\nwhich a counseled habeas petitioner has missed AEDPA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations will necessarily involve a conflict of\ninterest, Horwitz and Butts\u2019 contentions here were directly\nand concededly contrary to their client\u2019s interest, and\nmanifestly served their own professional and reputational\ninterests.\n   Clair makes clear that a conflict of this sort is grounds\nfor substitution. Even the narrower standard we rejected\nin that case would have allowed for substitution where an\nattorney has a \u201c \u2018disabling conflict of interest.\u2019 \u201d 565 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 7). And that standard, we concluded,\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nwould \u201cgu[t]\u201d the specific substitution-of-counsel clause\ncontained in \u00a73559(e), which must contemplate the grant-\ning of such motions in circumstances beyond those where a\npetitioner effectively \u201chas no counsel at all\u201d\u2014as is the case\nwhen counsel is conflicted. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nIndeed, we went so far as to say that given a capital de-\nfendant\u2019s \u201cstatutory right to counsel,\u201d even \u201cin the ab-\nsence\u201d of \u00a73599(e) a district court would be compelled \u201cto\nappoint new counsel if the first lawyer developed a con-\nflict.\u201d Ibid.\n   Given the obvious conflict of interest here, the consider-\nations relied upon by the District Court cannot justify its\ndecision to deny petitioner new counsel. The second and\nthird factors noted by the District Court\u2014that appointed\ncounsel continued to represent Christeson in litigation\nchallenging the means of his execution, and that the\nEighth Circuit had not previously substituted counsel\u2014\nare not substantial. Whether Horwitz and Butts had\ncurrently \u201cabandoned\u201d Christeson is beside the point:\nEven if they were actively representing him in some mat-\nters, their conflict prevented them from representing him\nin this particular matter. Likewise, it is irrelevant that\nthe Eighth Circuit had not previously sua sponte directed\nsubstitution of counsel in the course of denying\nChristeson\u2019s request for a certificate of appealabilty and\nadjudicating his challenge to Missouri\u2019s execution protocol,\nwhen the conflict was not evident.\n   The first and fourth factors cited by the District Court\u2014\nthe delay in seeking substitution and the potential for\nabuse\u2014might be valid considerations in many cases. See\nClair, 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (\u201cProtecting against\nabusive delay is an interest of justice\u201d). But under the\ncircumstances here, these factors alone cannot warrant\ndenial of substitution. Christeson\u2019s first substitution\nmotion, while undoubtedly delayed, was not abusive. It\nwas filed approximately a month after outside counsel\n8                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nbecame aware of Christeson\u2019s plight and well before the\nState had set an execution date, and it requested only 90\ndays to investigate and file a Rule 60(b) motion.\n  Nor is it plain that any subsequent motion that substi-\ntute counsel might file on Christeson\u2019s behalf would be\nfutile. See id., at ___ \u2013 ___ (slip op., at 15\u201316) (affirming\ndenial of substitution motion as untimely where any filing\nmade by substitute counsel would have been futile). To be\nsure, Christeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to\nhaving a federal court consider his habeas petition. Al-\nthough Christeson might properly raise a claim for relief\npursuant to Rule 60(b), see Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S.\n524, 535\u2013536 (2005), to obtain such relief he must demon-\nstrate both the motion\u2019s timeliness and, more significant\nhere, that \u201c \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 justif[y] the\nreopening of a final judgment.\u201d Id., at 535 (quoting\nAckermann v. United States, 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950)).\nThat, in turn, will require Christeson to show that he was\nentitled to the equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s statute of\nlimitations. He should have that opportunity, and is\nentitled to the assistance of substitute counsel in doing so.\n                        *     *    *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in\nforma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Eighth\nCircuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                    Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                  1\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n   MARK A. CHRISTESON v. DON ROPER, WARDEN\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 14\u20136873. Decided January 20, 2015\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   I would not reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals\nin this case without briefing and argument. As the Court\nacknowledges, petitioner cannot obtain review of the\nmerits of his federal habeas claims without showing that\nthe applicable statute of limitations should have been\nequitably tolled, ante, at 2, and the availability of equit-\nable tolling in cases governed by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) is a question\nof great importance.\n   AEDPA sought to ameliorate the lengthy delay that had\noften characterized federal habeas proceedings in the\npast.* See Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202, 206 (2003)\n(\u201cCongress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execu-\ntion of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in\ncapital cases\u201d). AEDPA thus imposed a strict 1-year time\nlimit for filing a federal habeas petition. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72244(d). If this 1-year period were equitably tolled\nwhenever a habeas petitioner\u2019s attorney missed the dead-\nline and thus rendered ineffective assistance, the 1-year\nperiod would be of little value, and the days of seemingly\ninterminable federal habeas review would return. In\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Members of this Court have lamented the delay that often occurs in\ncapital cases. Johnson v. Bredesen, 558 U. S. 1067, 1067\u20131070 (2009)\n(Stevens, J., statement respecting denial of certiorari), Elledge v.\nFlorida, 525 U. S. 944, 944\u2013946 (1998) (BREYER, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari).\n2                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nHolland, the Court held that the AEDPA statute of limita-\ntions may be equitably tolled\u2014but only under quite ex-\ntraordinary circumstances. Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S.\n631, 651\u2013652 (2010). Any expansion or further delinea-\ntion of such circumstances should not be undertaken\nwithout the careful consideration that is possible only\nafter the normal procedure of full briefing and argument.\n   The Court believes that briefing and argument are not\nnecessary in this case, and my understanding of the\nCourt\u2019s decision is that it expresses no view whatsoever on\nthe question whether petitioner may ultimately be entitled\nto equitable tolling. I understand the Court to hold only\nthat conflict-free substitute counsel should have been\nappointed for the purposes of investigating the facts re-\nlated to the issue of equitable tolling and presenting what-\never argument can be mounted in support of a request for\nthat relief.\n   Based on the present record, it is not clear that this case\ninvolves anything other than an error, albeit a serious one,\non the part of the attorneys who represented petitioner at\nthe time when his federal habeas petition was due to be\nfiled. According to those attorneys, they miscalculated the\ndue date and as a result filed the petition after the time\nhad run. They met with petitioner to discuss the habeas\npetition prior to the date on which they say they thought\nthe petition was due but after the date on which it was\nactually due. These facts show nothing more than attor-\nney error and thus fall short of establishing the kind of\nabandonment that is needed for equitable tolling under\nour precedent. See id., at 651\u2013652. I do not understand\nthe Court\u2019s opinion to hold otherwise.\n   Because of the close relationship between the question\nthat the Court decides (the propriety of the District\nCourt\u2019s refusal to appoint substitute counsel) and the\nquestion of petitioner\u2019s entitlement to equitable tolling, I\nthink that plenary review would have been more appro-\n                Cite as: 574 U.

Decided January 20, 2015\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Petitioner Mark Christeson\u2019s first federal habeas peti-\ntion was dismissed as untimely. Because his appointed\nattorneys\u2014who had missed the filing deadline\u2014could not\nbe expected to argue that Christeson was entitled to the\nequitable tolling of the statute of limitations, Christeson\nrequested substitute counsel who would not be laboring\nunder a conflict of interest. The District Court denied the\nmotion, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\nsummarily affirmed. In so doing, these courts contra-\nvened our decision in Martel v. Clair, 565 U. S. ___ (2012).\nChristeson\u2019s petition for certiorari is therefore granted,\nthe judgment of the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings.\n                              I\n  In 1999, a jury convicted Christeson of three counts of\ncapital murder. It returned verdicts of death on all\nthree counts. The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed\nChristeson\u2019s conviction and sentence in 2001, see State v.\nChristeson, 50 S. W. 3d 251 (en banc), and affirmed the\ndenial of his postconviction motion for relief in 2004, see\nChristeson v. State, 131 S. W. 3d 796 (en banc).\n  Under the strict 1-year statute of limitations imposed by\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1), Christeson\u2019s federal\nhabeas petition was due on April 10, 2005. Nine months\nbefore this critical deadline, the District Court appointed\nattorneys Phil Horwitz and Eric Butts to represent\n2                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nChristeson in his federal habeas proceedings. See 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73599(a)(2) (providing for appointment of counsel\nfor state death row inmates).\n   Horwitz and Butts, as they have subsequently acknowl-\nedged, failed to meet with Christeson until more than six\nweeks after his petition was due. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n93a. There is no evidence that they communicated with\ntheir client at all during this time. They finally filed the\npetition on August 5, 2005\u2014117 days too late. They have\nsince claimed that their failure to meet with their client\nand timely file his habeas petition resulted from a simple\nmiscalculation of the AEDPA limitations period (and in\ndefending themselves, they may have disclosed privileged\nclient communications). See id., at 90a\u201392a, 135a. But a\nlegal ethics expert, reviewing counsel\u2019s handling of\nChristeson\u2019s habeas petition, stated in a report submitted\nto the District Court: \u201c[I]f this was not abandonment, I am\nnot sure what would be.\u201d Id., at 132a.\n   The District Court dismissed the petition as untimely,\nand the Court of Appeals denied Christeson\u2019s application\nfor a certificate of appealability. Christeson, who appears\nto have severe cognitive disabilities that lead him to rely\nentirely on his attorneys, may not have been aware of this\ndismissal. See id., at 229a, 231a, 237a.\n   Nearly seven years later, Horwitz and Butts contacted\nattorneys Jennifer Merrigan and Joseph Perkovich to\ndiscuss how to proceed in Christeson\u2019s case. Merrigan and\nPerkovich immediately noticed a glaring problem.\nChristeson\u2019s only hope for securing review of the merits of\nhis habeas claims was to file a motion under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 60(b) seeking to reopen final judgment\non the ground that AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations should\nhave been equitably tolled. But Horwitz and Butts could\nnot be expected to file such a motion on Christeson\u2019s be-\nhalf, as any argument for equitable tolling would be prem-\nised on their own malfeasance in failing to file timely the\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)               3\n\n                            Per Curiam\n\nhabeas petition. While initially receptive to Merrigan and\nPerkovich\u2019s assistance, Horwitz and Butts soon refused to\nallow outside counsel access to their files. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 345a.\n   On May 23, 2014, Merrigan and Perkovich filed a mo-\ntion for substitution of counsel. The District Court denied\nthe motion, explaining only that it was \u201cnot in\n[Christeson\u2019s] best interest to be represented by attorneys\nlocated in New York and Pennsylvania,\u201d as Merrigan and\nPerkovich are. Id., at 169a. The District Court did not\naddress Merrigan and Perkovich\u2019s offer to forgo all fees\nand expenses associated with travel to Missouri, nor did it\naddress the possibility of appointing other attorneys for\nChristeson.\n   Christeson appealed. The Eighth Circuit dismissed for\nlack of jurisdiction, apparently reasoning that Merrigan\nand Perkovich were not authorized to file an appeal on\nChristeson\u2019s behalf.1 On September 19, 2014, while this\nappeal was still pending before the Eighth Circuit, the\nMissouri Supreme Court issued a warrant of execution\nsetting October 29, 2014, as Christeson\u2019s execution date.\n   After further proceedings not relevant here, Merrigan\nand Perkovich again filed a motion for substitution of\ncounsel on Christeson\u2019s behalf. The District Court again\ndenied the motion.        Explaining that substitution of\n\u201cfederally-appointed counsel is warranted only when it would\nserve the interests of justice,\u201d it offered four reasons for its\ndecision. Order in No. 04\u2013CV\u201308004 (WD Mo., Oct. 22,\n2014), p. 1, App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a (quoting Lambrix v.\nSecretary, Florida Dept. of Corrections, 756 F. 3d 1246,\n1259 (CA11 2014); internal quotation marks omitted).\nFirst, it deemed the motion to be untimely because it \u201cwas\nnot filed until 2014, and shortly before [Christeson\u2019s]\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 Christeson has since submitted a signed retainer agreement with\n\nMerrigan and Perkovich that removes any doubt on that score.\n4                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nexecution date.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a. Second, it\nobserved that Horwitz and Butts had not \u201cabandoned\u201d\nChristeson, as they had recently appeared on his behalf in\na class-action lawsuit challenging Missouri\u2019s lethal injec-\ntion protocol. Id., at 376a. Third, it noted that although\nHorwitz and Butts had represented Christeson before the\nEighth Circuit, that court had not appointed substitute\ncounsel. Ibid. Fourth and finally, the District Court\nexpressed its belief that granting the motion would set \u201can\nuntenable precedent\u201d by allowing outside attorneys to seek\n\u201c \u2018abusive\u2019 \u201d delays in capital cases. Ibid.\n    Christeson again appealed. This time, the Eighth Cir-\ncuit summarily affirmed the District Court\u2019s order. We\nstayed Christeson\u2019s execution, see post, p. ____, and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n   Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a73599 \u201centitles indigent defendants to\nthe appointment of counsel in capital cases, including\nhabeas corpus proceedings.\u201d Martel v. Clair, 565 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1). \u201cBy providing indigent capital defend-\nants with a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel in\nthese proceedings, Congress has recognized that federal\nhabeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in\npromoting fundamental fairness in the imposition of the\ndeath penalty.\u201d McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 859\n(1994). Congress has not, however, conferred capital\nhabeas petitioners with the right to counsel of their choice.\nInstead, the statute leaves it to the court to select a\nproperly qualified attorney. See \u00a7\u00a73599(a)\u2013(d). But the\nstatute contemplates that a court may \u201creplace\u201d appointed\ncounsel with \u201csimilarly qualified counsel . . . upon motion\u201d\nof the petitioner. \u00a73599(e).\n   We addressed the standard that a court should apply in\nconsidering such a motion in Clair. We rejected the ar-\ngument that substitution of an appointed lawyer is war-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nranted in only three situations: \u201cwhen the lawyer lacks the\nqualifications necessary for appointment . . . ; when he has\na disabling conflict of interest; or when he has completely\nabandoned the client.\u201d 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, we adopted a\nbroader standard, holding that a motion for substitution\nshould be granted when it is in the \u201c \u2018interests of justice.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 13). We further explained that the\nfactors a court of appeals should consider in determining\nwhether a district court abused its discretion in denying\nsuch a motion \u201cinclude: the timeliness of the motion; the\nadequacy of the district court\u2019s inquiry into the defend-\nant\u2019s complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint,\nincluding the extent of the conflict or breakdown in com-\nmunication between lawyer and client (and the client\u2019s\nresponsibility, if any, for that conflict).\u201d Ibid.\n   The District Court here properly recognized that its\nconsideration of Christeson\u2019s motion for substitution was\ngoverned by Clair\u2019s \u201cinterests of justice\u201d standard. But its\ndenial of his motion did not adequately account for all of\nthe factors we set forth in Clair.\n   The court\u2019s principal error was its failure to\nacknowledge Horwitz and Butts\u2019 conflict of interest. Toll-\ning based on counsel\u2019s failure to satisfy AEDPA\u2019s statute\nof limitations is available only for \u201cserious instances of\nattorney misconduct.\u201d Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631,\n651\u2013652 (2010). Advancing such a claim would have\nrequired Horwitz and Butts to denigrate their own per-\nformance. Counsel cannot reasonably be expected to make\nsuch an argument, which threatens their professional\nreputation and livelihood. See Restatement (Third) of\nLaw Governing Lawyers \u00a7125 (1998). Thus, as we ob-\nserved in a similar context in Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S.\n___, ___, n. 8 (2012) (slip op., at 17, n. 8), a \u201csignificant\nconflict of interest\u201d arises when an attorney\u2019s \u201cinterest in\navoiding damage to [his] own reputation\u201d is at odds with\n6                   CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nhis client\u2019s \u201cstrongest argument\u2014i.e., that his attorneys\nhad abandoned him.\u201d\n  Indeed, to their credit, Horwitz and Butts acknowledged\nthe nature of their conflict. Shortly before the first motion\nfor substitution was filed, they provided an update to the\nMissouri Supreme Court on the status of Christeson\u2019s\ncollateral proceedings. In it, they stated:\n     \u201cBecause counsel herein would be essential witnesses\n     to factual questions indispensable to a Holland in-\n     quiry, there may be ethical and legal conflicts that\n     would arise that would prohibit counsel from litigat-\n     ing issues that would support a Holland claim. Un-\n     waivable ethical and legal conflicts prohibit under-\n     signed counsel from litigating these issues in any way.\n     See Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475, 485\u2013486\n     (1978). Conflict free counsel must be appointed to\n     present the equitable tolling question in federal dis-\n     trict court.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a\u201349a.\n   Yet, in their response to the District Court\u2019s order to\naddress the substitution motion, Horwitz and Butts char-\nacterized the potential arguments in favor of equitable\ntolling as \u201cludicrous,\u201d and asserted that they had \u201ca legal\nbasis and rationale for the [erroneous] calculation of the\nfiling date.\u201d Id., at 86a, 90a. While not every case in\nwhich a counseled habeas petitioner has missed AEDPA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations will necessarily involve a conflict of\ninterest, Horwitz and Butts\u2019 contentions here were directly\nand concededly contrary to their client\u2019s interest, and\nmanifestly served their own professional and reputational\ninterests.\n   Clair makes clear that a conflict of this sort is grounds\nfor substitution. Even the narrower standard we rejected\nin that case would have allowed for substitution where an\nattorney has a \u201c \u2018disabling conflict of interest.\u2019 \u201d 565 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 7). And that standard, we concluded,\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nwould \u201cgu[t]\u201d the specific substitution-of-counsel clause\ncontained in \u00a73559(e), which must contemplate the grant-\ning of such motions in circumstances beyond those where a\npetitioner effectively \u201chas no counsel at all\u201d\u2014as is the case\nwhen counsel is conflicted. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nIndeed, we went so far as to say that given a capital de-\nfendant\u2019s \u201cstatutory right to counsel,\u201d even \u201cin the ab-\nsence\u201d of \u00a73599(e) a district court would be compelled \u201cto\nappoint new counsel if the first lawyer developed a con-\nflict.\u201d Ibid.\n   Given the obvious conflict of interest here, the consider-\nations relied upon by the District Court cannot justify its\ndecision to deny petitioner new counsel. The second and\nthird factors noted by the District Court\u2014that appointed\ncounsel continued to represent Christeson in litigation\nchallenging the means of his execution, and that the\nEighth Circuit had not previously substituted counsel\u2014\nare not substantial. Whether Horwitz and Butts had\ncurrently \u201cabandoned\u201d Christeson is beside the point:\nEven if they were actively representing him in some mat-\nters, their conflict prevented them from representing him\nin this particular matter. Likewise, it is irrelevant that\nthe Eighth Circuit had not previously sua sponte directed\nsubstitution of counsel in the course of denying\nChristeson\u2019s request for a certificate of appealabilty and\nadjudicating his challenge to Missouri\u2019s execution protocol,\nwhen the conflict was not evident.\n   The first and fourth factors cited by the District Court\u2014\nthe delay in seeking substitution and the potential for\nabuse\u2014might be valid considerations in many cases. See\nClair, 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (\u201cProtecting against\nabusive delay is an interest of justice\u201d). But under the\ncircumstances here, these factors alone cannot warrant\ndenial of substitution. Christeson\u2019s first substitution\nmotion, while undoubtedly delayed, was not abusive. It\nwas filed approximately a month after outside counsel\n8                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nbecame aware of Christeson\u2019s plight and well before the\nState had set an execution date, and it requested only 90\ndays to investigate and file a Rule 60(b) motion.\n  Nor is it plain that any subsequent motion that substi-\ntute counsel might file on Christeson\u2019s behalf would be\nfutile. See id., at ___ \u2013 ___ (slip op., at 15\u201316) (affirming\ndenial of substitution motion as untimely where any filing\nmade by substitute counsel would have been futile). To be\nsure, Christeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to\nhaving a federal court consider his habeas petition. Al-\nthough Christeson might properly raise a claim for relief\npursuant to Rule 60(b), see Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S.\n524, 535\u2013536 (2005), to obtain such relief he must demon-\nstrate both the motion\u2019s timeliness and, more significant\nhere, that \u201c \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 justif[y] the\nreopening of a final judgment.\u201d Id., at 535 (quoting\nAckermann v. United States, 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950)).\nThat, in turn, will require Christeson to show that he was\nentitled to the equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s statute of\nlimitations. He should have that opportunity, and is\nentitled to the assistance of substitute counsel in doing so.\n                        *     *    *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in\nforma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Eighth\nCircuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                    Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                  1\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n   MARK A. CHRISTESON v. DON ROPER, WARDEN\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 14\u20136873. Decided January 20, 2015\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   I would not reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals\nin this case without briefing and argument. As the Court\nacknowledges, petitioner cannot obtain review of the\nmerits of his federal habeas claims without showing that\nthe applicable statute of limitations should have been\nequitably tolled, ante, at 2, and the availability of equit-\nable tolling in cases governed by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) is a question\nof great importance.\n   AEDPA sought to ameliorate the lengthy delay that had\noften characterized federal habeas proceedings in the\npast.* See Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202, 206 (2003)\n(\u201cCongress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execu-\ntion of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in\ncapital cases\u201d). AEDPA thus imposed a strict 1-year time\nlimit for filing a federal habeas petition. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72244(d). If this 1-year period were equitably tolled\nwhenever a habeas petitioner\u2019s attorney missed the dead-\nline and thus rendered ineffective assistance, the 1-year\nperiod would be of little value, and the days of seemingly\ninterminable federal habeas review would return. In\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Members of this Court have lamented the delay that often occurs in\ncapital cases. Johnson v. Bredesen, 558 U. S. 1067, 1067\u20131070 (2009)\n(Stevens, J., statement respecting denial of certiorari), Elledge v.\nFlorida, 525 U. S. 944, 944\u2013946 (1998) (BREYER, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari).\n2                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nHolland, the Court held that the AEDPA statute of limita-\ntions may be equitably tolled\u2014but only under quite ex-\ntraordinary circumstances. Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S.\n631, 651\u2013652 (2010). Any expansion or further delinea-\ntion of such circumstances should not be undertaken\nwithout the careful consideration that is possible only\nafter the normal procedure of full briefing and argument.\n   The Court believes that briefing and argument are not\nnecessary in this case, and my understanding of the\nCourt\u2019s decision is that it expresses no view whatsoever on\nthe question whether petitioner may ultimately be entitled\nto equitable tolling. I understand the Court to hold only\nthat conflict-free substitute counsel should have been\nappointed for the purposes of investigating the facts re-\nlated to the issue of equitable tolling and presenting what-\never argument can be mounted in support of a request for\nthat relief.\n   Based on the present record, it is not clear that this case\ninvolves anything other than an error, albeit a serious one,\non the part of the attorneys who represented petitioner at\nthe time when his federal habeas petition was due to be\nfiled. According to those attorneys, they miscalculated the\ndue date and as a result filed the petition after the time\nhad run. They met with petitioner to discuss the habeas\npetition prior to the date on which they say they thought\nthe petition was due but after the date on which it was\nactually due. These facts show nothing more than attor-\nney error and thus fall short of establishing the kind of\nabandonment that is needed for equitable tolling under\nour precedent. See id., at 651\u2013652. I do not understand\nthe Court\u2019s opinion to hold otherwise.\n   Because of the close relationship between the question\nthat the Court decides (the propriety of the District\nCourt\u2019s refusal to appoint substitute counsel) and the\nquestion of petitioner\u2019s entitlement to equitable tolling, I\nthink that plenary review would have been more appro-\n                Cite as: 574 U.

I write separately to emphasize that\nthe Court\u2019s summary disposition does not address that\nissue.\n</pre>",
