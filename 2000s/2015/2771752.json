Argued December 9, 2014—Decided January 21, 2015\nThree legal prescriptions figure in this case. Title 28 U. S. C. §1291\n  gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over appeals from “all final\n  decisions of the district courts of the United States,” and its core ap-\n  plication is to rulings that terminate an action. Federal Rule of Civil\n  Procedure 54(b) permits district courts to authorize immediate ap-\n  peal of dispositive rulings on separate claims in a civil action raising\n  multiple claims. And 28 U. S. C. §1407 authorizes the Judicial Panel\n  on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to transfer civil actions “involving\n  one or more common questions of fact . . . to any district for coordi-\n  nated or consolidated pretrial proceedings” in order to “promote the\n  just and efficient conduct of such actions,” §1407(a).\n     The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a reference point\n  in determining interest rates for financial instruments in the United\n  States and globally. The JPML established a multidistrict litigation\n  (LIBOR MDL) for cases involving allegations that defendant-banks\n  understated their borrowing costs, thereby depressing LIBOR and\n  enabling the banks to pay lower interest rates on financial instru-\n  ments sold to investors. Over 60 actions were consolidated for pretri-\n  al proceedings in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of\n  New York, including a class action filed by petitioners Ellen Gelboim\n  and Linda Zacher, who raised the single claim that several banks,\n  acting in concert, had violated federal antitrust law. Determining\n  that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable antitrust injury, the Dis-\n  trict Court granted the banks’ motion to dismiss all antitrust claims,\n  including the Gelboim-Zacher complaint’s sole claim. The District\n  Court thus dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher complaint, denied leave to\n  amend, and dismissed the case in its entirety. Other cases made part\n2               GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    of the LIBOR MDL, however, presented discrete claims which re-\n    mained before the District Court. Assuming that the Gelboim-Zacher\n    plaintiffs were entitled to an immediate appeal of right under §1291,\n    the District Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications authorizing the\n    plaintiffs in some of the multiple-claim actions to appeal the dismis-\n    sal of their antitrust claims while their other claims remained pend-\n    ing in the District Court. On its own initiative, the Second Circuit\n    dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher appeal because the order appealed\n    from did not dispose of all of the claims in the consolidated action.\n    The District Court thereafter withdrew its Rule 54(b) certifications.\nHeld: The order dismissing their case in its entirety removed Gelboim\n and Zacher from the consolidated proceeding, thereby triggering their\n right to appeal under §1291.\n    Because cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordinarily\n retain their separate identities, an order disposing of one of the dis-\n crete cases in its entirety should qualify under §1291 as an appeala-\n ble final decision. Section 1407 refers to individual “actions” trans-\n ferrable to a single district court, not to a monolithic multidistrict\n “action” created by transfer. See Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Ber-\n shad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 37. And §1407(a)’s language—“at\n or before the conclusion of . . . pretrial proceedings,” each transferred\n action must be remanded to the originating district “unless [the ac-\n tion] shall have been previously terminated”—indicates Congress’ an-\n ticipation that, during the pendency of pretrial proceedings, final de-\n cisions might be rendered in one or more of the actions consolidated\n pursuant to §1407. The District Court’s order dismissing the Gel-\n boim-Zacher complaint was a final decision. The District Court com-\n pleted its adjudication of petitioners’ complaint and terminated their\n action. Petitioners thus are no longer participants in the consolidat-\n ed proceedings. Nothing about the initial consolidation of their civil\n action with other LIBOR MDL cases renders the dismissal of their\n complaint tentative or incomplete.\n    To hold, as the banks contend, that no appeal of right accrues until\n a §1407 consolidation ends would leave plaintiffs like Gelboim and\n Zacher in a quandary about the event that triggers the 30-day period\n for taking an appeal. The sensible solution to the appeal-clock trig-\n ger is to allow an immediate appeal in a case such as this, where the\n transferee court in an MDL grants a defendant’s dispositive motion\n on every claim (or the sole claim) in a transferred case. The banks\n are also concerned about allowing plaintiffs with the weakest cases to\n appeal because their complaint states only one claim, while leaving\n those with stronger cases unable to appeal simultaneously because\n they have other pending claims. But that concern is attended to by\n Rule 54(b), which authorizes district courts to grant certifications to\n                    Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n parties with multiple-claim complaints, thereby enabling plaintiffs in\n actions that have not been dismissed in their entirety to pursue im-\n mediate appellate review of discrete claims. The District Court did\n that in this very case. Rule 54(b), however, is of no avail to Gelboim\n and Zacher, who asserted only one claim. See Sears, Roebuck & Co.\n v. Mackey, 351 U. S. 427, 435. Section 1292(b)—which allows district\n courts to designate for review certain interlocutory orders—is also\n inapposite here, for there is nothing “interlocutory” about the dismis-\n sal order in the Gelboim-Zacher action.

BANK OF\n         AMERICA CORPORATION ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n                               [January 21, 2015]\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   An unsuccessful litigant in a federal district court may\ntake an appeal, as a matter of right, from a “final deci-\nsio[n] of the district cour[t].” 28 U. S. C. §1291. The ques-\ntion here presented: Is the right to appeal secured by\n§1291 affected when a case is consolidated for pretrial\nproceedings in multidistrict litigation (or MDL) authorized\nby 28 U. S. C. §1407?\n   Petitioners Ellen Gelboim and Linda Zacher filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York a class-action complaint raising a single claim.\nThey alleged that a number of banks, acting in concert,\nhad violated federal antitrust law. Their case was consol-\nidated for pretrial proceedings together with some 60\nother cases, commenced in different districts, raising “one\nor more common questions of fact,” §1407(a).\n   The defendant banks, respondents here, moved to dis-\nmiss the Gelboim-Zacher complaint on the ground that the\nplaintiffs had suffered no antitrust injury. The District\nCourt granted the motion, denied leave to amend the\ncomplaint, and dismissed the case in its entirety. Other\n2           GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncases made part of the multidistrict pretrial proceedings,\nhowever, presented discrete claims and remained before\nthe District Court.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, acting on\nits own motion, dismissed the appeal filed by Gelboim and\nZacher for want of appellate jurisdiction. We reverse the\nSecond Circuit’s judgment and hold that the Gelboim-\nZacher complaint retained its independent status for\npurposes of appellate jurisdiction under §1291. Petition-\ners’ right to appeal ripened when the District Court dis-\nmissed their case, not upon eventual completion of multi-\ndistrict proceedings in all of the consolidated cases.\n                               I\n   Three legal prescriptions figure in this case: Title 28\nU. S. C. §§1291 and 1407, and Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\ndure 54(b).\n   Section 1291 gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over\nappeals from “all final decisions of the district courts of the\nUnited States.” A “final decision” is one “by which a dis-\ntrict court disassociates itself from a case.” Swint v.\nChambers County Comm’n, 514 U. S. 35, 42 (1995). While\ndecisions of this Court have accorded §1291 a “practical\nrather than a technical construction,” Mohawk Industries,\nInc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. 100, 106 (2009) (quoting Cohen\nv. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546\n(1949)), the statute’s core application is to rulings that\nterminate an action, see Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S.\n229, 233 (1945) (final decision is “one which ends the\nlitigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to\ndo but execute the judgment”).\n   Rule 54(b) permits district courts to authorize immedi-\nate appeal of dispositive rulings on separate claims in a\ncivil action raising multiple claims:\n    “When an action presents more than one claim for re-\n    lief . . . or when multiple parties are involved, the\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or\n     more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the\n     court expressly determines that there is no just rea-\n     son for delay.”1\nRule 54(b) relaxes “the former general practice that, in\nmultiple claims actions, all the claims had to be finally\ndecided before an appeal could be entertained from a final\ndecision upon any of them.” Sears, Roebuck & Co. v.\nMackey, 351 U. S. 427, 434 (1956). The Federal Rules\nallow a plaintiff to “state [in one complaint] as many\nseparate claims . . . as it has.” Rule 8(d)(3). Rule 54(b)\nwas adopted in view of the breadth of the “civil action” the\nRules allow, specifically “to avoid the possible injustice” of\n“delay[ing] judgment o[n] a distinctly separate claim\n[pending] adjudication of the entire case.” Report of Advi-\nsory Committee on Proposed Amendments to Rules of\nCivil Procedure 70 (1946) (explaining that Rule 54(b) was\nrecast in 1946 to avoid confusion and misapplication); see\nDickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U. S. 507,\n511 (1950) (Rule 54(b) responded to liberalized joinder of\nclaims and parties under the Federal Rules, which “in-\ncreased the danger of hardship and denial of justice\nthrough delay if each issue must await the determination\nof all issues as to all parties before a final judgment can be\nhad”). The Rule thus aimed to augment, not diminish,\nappeal opportunity.\n   Section 1407 is of more recent vintage. Enacted in 1968\nin response to a growing number of complex but related\ncases filed in multiple districts, §1407 authorizes the\nJudicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to trans-\nfer civil actions “involving one or more common questions\n——————\n  1 Compare   Rule 54(b), which lodges discretion to authorize appeals in\ndistrict courts, with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), which au-\nthorizes courts of appeals to permit an immediate appeal from a district\ncourt order granting or denying class-action certification.\n4           GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof fact . . . to any district for coordinated or consolidated\npretrial proceedings” in order to “promote the just and\nefficient conduct of such actions.” §1407(a); see H. R. Rep.\nNo. 1130, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1968) (§1407 codified\nprocedures used in the early 1960’s to resolve more than\n1,800 separate actions filed against electrical equipment\nmanufacturers in 33 District Courts, all of the actions\nseeking damages for antitrust law violations).\n   Transfer under §1407 aims to “eliminate duplication in\ndiscovery, avoid conflicting rulings and schedules, reduce\nlitigation cost, and save the time and effort of the parties,\nthe attorneys, the witnesses, and the courts.” Manual for\nComplex Litigation §20.131, p. 220 (4th ed. 2004). “Each\naction” transferred pursuant to §1407, the provision in-\nstructs, “shall be remanded by the panel at or before the\nconclusion of . . . pretrial proceedings to the district from\nwhich it was transferred unless it shall have been previ-\nously terminated.” §1407(a).\n                             II\n  The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a\nbenchmark interest rate disseminated by the British\nBankers’ Association based on the rate at which certain\nbanks predict they can borrow funds. LIBOR is a refer-\nence point in determining interest rates for financial\ninstruments in the United States and globally.\n  In August 2011, the JPML established MDL No. 2262\n(LIBOR MDL) for cases involving allegations that the\nbanks named as defendants understated their borrowing\ncosts, thereby depressing LIBOR and enabling the banks\nto pay lower interest rates on financial instruments sold to\ninvestors.

Com-\nposing the LIBOR MDL, over 60 actions, commenced in\nCalifornia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minne-\nsota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas,\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nVirginia, and Wisconsin, were coordinated or consolidated\nfor pretrial proceedings in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York.\n   In June 2012, the District Court entertained a motion to\ndismiss four categories of cases included in the MDL. The\nfirst three categories involved putative class actions, each\nwith a single lead case: (1) the Gelboim-Zacher action,\nfiled on behalf of purchasers of bonds with LIBOR-linked\ninterest rates; (2) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of\nover-the-counter LIBOR-based instruments (OTC plain-\ntiffs); (3) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of LIBOR-\nbased instruments on exchanges (Exchange plaintiffs).\nThe fourth category, not relevant here, comprised a set of\nindividual actions filed by Charles Schwab Corporation\nand related entities. The Gelboim-Zacher complaint as-\nserted a federal antitrust claim under §1 of the Sherman\nAct, 15 U. S. C. §1, and that claim only, while the com-\nplaints in the other actions asserted a federal antitrust\nclaim in addition to other differently based federal and\nstate claims.\n   Determining that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable\nantitrust injury, the District Court granted the banks’\nmotion to dismiss plaintiffs’ antitrust claims—the sole\nclaim raised in the Gelboim-Zacher complaint. Assuming\nthat the Gelboim-Zacher plaintiffs were entitled to an\nimmediate appeal of right under §1291 because their suit\nhad been “dismissed in [its] entirety,” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n219a, the District Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications\nto the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs authorizing them to\nappeal the dismissal of their antitrust claims while their\nother claims remained pending in the District Court.\n   On its own initiative, the Second Circuit dismissed the\nGelboim-Zacher appeal because the “orde[r] appealed from\ndid not dispose of all claims in the consolidated action.”\n6              GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 2a.2 The District Court thereafter withdrew its\nRule 54(b) certifications in the OTC and Exchange plain-\ntiffs’ actions and, “given the reaction of the Second Cir-\ncuit,” App. 294, denied petitioners’ request for a Rule 54(b)\ncertification.\n   We granted review of the Second Circuit’s judgment\ndismissing the Gelboim-Zacher appeal. 573 U. S. ___\n(2014). Before this Court, petitioners Gelboim and Zacher\ncontend that the order dismissing their case in its entirety\nremoved them from the consolidated proceeding, thereby\ntriggering their right to appeal under §1291. Respondent\nbanks urge that consolidated cases proceed as one unit for\nthe duration of the consolidation. Consequently, they\nmaintain, there is no appeal of right from an order dis-\nmissing fewer than all consolidated claims, thus the sole\navenue for appeal while the consolidation continues is\nRule 54(b). Agreeing with Gelboim and Zacher, we reverse\nthe Court of Appeals’ judgment.\n                             III\n  Cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordi-\nnarily retain their separate identities,3 so an order dispos-\n——————\n   2 The Second Circuit “strong[ly] presum[es]” that a “judgment in a\n\nconsolidated [proceeding] that does not dispose of all [consolidated]\nclaims . . . is not appealable absent Rule 54(b) certification.” Hageman\nv. City Investing Co., 851 F. 2d 69, 71 (1988). In this regard, the Circuit\ndoes not differentiate between all-purpose consolidations, see ibid.\n(actions “could originally have been brought as one action” and there\nwas “no indication that the cases were consolidated only for limited\npurposes”); Houbigant, Inc. v. IMG Fragrance Brands, LLC, 627 F. 3d\n497, 498 (2010) (actions consolidated “for all purposes”), and, as this\ncase illustrates, §1407 consolidations for pretrial proceedings only. The\npresumption may be overcome in “highly unusual circumstances,”\nHageman, 851 F. 2d, at 71, but the Second Circuit has not elaborated\non what those circumstances might be.\n   3 Parties may elect to file a “master complaint” and a corresponding\n\n“consolidated answer,” which supersede prior individual pleadings. In\nsuch a case, the transferee court may treat the master pleadings as\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning of one of the discrete cases in its entirety should qual-\nify under §1291 as an appealable final decision. Section\n1407 refers to individual “actions” which may be trans-\nferred to a single district court, not to any monolithic\nmultidistrict “action” created by transfer. See Lexecon Inc.\nv. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 37\n(1998) (§1407 does not “imbu[e] transferred actions with\nsome new and distinctive . . . character”).4 And Congress\nanticipated that, during the pendency of pretrial proceed-\nings, final decisions might be rendered in one or more of\nthe actions consolidated pursuant to §1407. It specified\nthat “at or before the conclusion of . . . pretrial proceed-\nings,” each of the transferred actions must be remanded to\nthe originating district “unless [the action] shall have been\npreviously terminated.” §1407(a) (emphasis added).\n   The District Court’s order dismissing the Gelboim-\nZacher complaint for lack of antitrust injury, without\nleave to amend, had the hallmarks of a final decision.\nRuling on the merits of the case, the District Court com-\npleted its adjudication of petitioners’ complaint and termi-\nnated their action. As a result of the District Court’s\ndisposition, petitioners are no longer participants in the\nconsolidated proceedings. Nothing about the initial con-\nsolidation of their civil action with other cases in the\n——————\nmerging the discrete actions for the duration of the MDL pretrial\nproceedings. In re Refrigerant Compressors Antitrust Litigation, 731\nF. 3d 586, 590–592 (CA6 2013). No merger occurs, however, when “the\nmaster complaint is not meant to be a pleading with legal effect but\nonly an administrative summary of the claims brought by all the\nplaintiffs.” Id., at 590.\n   4 We express no opinion on whether an order deciding one of multiple\n\ncases combined in an all-purpose consolidation qualifies under §1291 as\na final decision appealable of right. See Brown v. United States, 976 F.\n2d 1104, 1107 (CA7 1992) (cases consolidated for all purposes “become a\nsingle judicial unit,” but where the consolidation is for limited purposes\nonly, “a decision disposing of all the claims in only one of the cases is a\nfinal decision subject to immediate appeal”).\n8              GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nLIBOR MDL renders the dismissal of their complaint in\nany way tentative or incomplete. As is ordinarily the case,\nthe §1407 consolidation offered convenience for the parties\nand promoted efficient judicial administration, but did not\nmeld the Gelboim-Zacher action and others in the MDL\ninto a single unit. Cf. supra, at 6, n. 3.5\n   The banks’ view that, in a §1407 consolidation, no ap-\npeal of right accrues until the consolidation ends would\nleave plaintiffs like Gelboim and Zacher in a quandary\nabout the proper timing of their appeals. Under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4, which this Court has called\n“jurisdictional,” Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209\n(2007), a notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed\n“within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order ap-\npealed from,” Rule 4(a)(1)(A). If plaintiffs whose actions\nhave been dismissed with prejudice by a district court\nmust await the termination of pretrial proceedings in all\nconsolidated cases, what event or order would start the 30-\nday clock? When pretrial consolidation concludes, there\nmay be no occasion for the entry of any judgment. Orders\nmay issue returning cases to their originating courts,6 but\nan order of that genre would not qualify as the dispositive\n——————\n  5 In delineating the narrow scope of the “collateral-order” doctrine, we\n\nhave cautioned against permitting piecemeal, prejudgment appeals.\nThose admonitions, cited by the banks, Brief for Respondents 18–19,\nare not pertinent here. Under the collateral order doctrine, an order\nmay be deemed “final” if it disposes of a matter “separable from, and\ncollateral to” the merits of the main proceeding, “too important to be\ndenied review,” and “too independent of the cause itself to require that\nappellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.”\nCohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546 (1949).\nThe order dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher complaint in its entirety was\nin no sense “collateral,” i.e., “independent of the cause itself.” Scarcely\na prejudgment ruling, the dismissal order left nothing still pending\ndecision in the District Court.\n  6 In fact, “[f]ew cases [consolidated pursuant to §1407] are remanded\n\nfor trial; most multidistrict litigation is settled in the transferee court.”\nManual for Complex Litigation §20.132, p. 223 (4th ed. 2004).\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

Herr, Multidistrict Litigation Manual\n§9:21, p. 312 (2014).\n  The banks express concern that plaintiffs with the\nweakest cases may be positioned to appeal because their\ncomplaint states only one claim, while plaintiffs with\nstronger cases will be unable to appeal simultaneously\nbecause they have other claims still pending. Brief for\nRespondents 46–47. Rule 54(b) attends to this concern.\nDistrict courts may grant certifications under that Rule,\nthereby enabling plaintiffs in actions that have not been\ndismissed in their entirety to pursue immediate appellate\nreview. That is just what happened in this very case. The\nDistrict Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications to the OTC\nand Exchange plaintiffs so they could appeal at the same\ntime Gelboim and Zacher could. See supra, at 5. And if\nthe MDL court believes that further proceedings might be\nrelevant to a claim a defendant moves to dismiss, the court\nordinarily can defer ruling on the motion, thus allowing all\nplaintiffs to participate in the ongoing MDL proceedings.\n  While Rule 54(b) can aid parties with multiple-claim\ncomplaints—here, the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs, su-\npra, at 5—the Rule, properly read, is of no avail to Gel-\nboim and Zacher. Rule 54(b) addresses orders finally\nadjudicating fewer than all claims presented in a civil\naction complaint. It “does not apply to a single claim\n10            GELBOIM v.

S. 737,\n742–743 (1976) (Rule 54(b) inapplicable where “complaint\nadvanced a single legal theory which was applied to only\none set of facts”). In short, Rule 54(b) is designed to per-\nmit acceleration of appeals in multiple-claim cases, not to\nretard appeals in single-claim cases.7\n   Section 1292(b), the banks conceded at argument, see\nTr. of Oral Arg. 40–41, is inapposite here. It allows dis-\ntrict courts to designate for review interlocutory orders\n“not otherwise appealable,” where immediate appeal “may\nmaterially advance the ultimate termination of the litiga-\ntion.” §1292(b). The designation may be accepted or\nrejected in the discretion of the court of appeals. Ibid. See\ngenerally Solimine, Revitalizing Interlocutory Appeals in\nthe Federal Courts, 58 Geo. Wash. L.

Argued December 9, 2014—Decided January 21, 2015\nThree legal prescriptions figure in this case. Title 28 U. S. C. §1291\n  gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over appeals from “all final\n  decisions of the district courts of the United States,” and its core ap-\n  plication is to rulings that terminate an action. Federal Rule of Civil\n  Procedure 54(b) permits district courts to authorize immediate ap-\n  peal of dispositive rulings on separate claims in a civil action raising\n  multiple claims. And 28 U. S. C. §1407 authorizes the Judicial Panel\n  on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to transfer civil actions “involving\n  one or more common questions of fact . . . to any district for coordi-\n  nated or consolidated pretrial proceedings” in order to “promote the\n  just and efficient conduct of such actions,” §1407(a).\n     The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a reference point\n  in determining interest rates for financial instruments in the United\n  States and globally. The JPML established a multidistrict litigation\n  (LIBOR MDL) for cases involving allegations that defendant-banks\n  understated their borrowing costs, thereby depressing LIBOR and\n  enabling the banks to pay lower interest rates on financial instru-\n  ments sold to investors. Over 60 actions were consolidated for pretri-\n  al proceedings in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of\n  New York, including a class action filed by petitioners Ellen Gelboim\n  and Linda Zacher, who raised the single claim that several banks,\n  acting in concert, had violated federal antitrust law. Determining\n  that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable antitrust injury, the Dis-\n  trict Court granted the banks’ motion to dismiss all antitrust claims,\n  including the Gelboim-Zacher complaint’s sole claim. The District\n  Court thus dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher complaint, denied leave to\n  amend, and dismissed the case in its entirety. Other cases made part\n2               GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    of the LIBOR MDL, however, presented discrete claims which re-\n    mained before the District Court. Assuming that the Gelboim-Zacher\n    plaintiffs were entitled to an immediate appeal of right under §1291,\n    the District Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications authorizing the\n    plaintiffs in some of the multiple-claim actions to appeal the dismis-\n    sal of their antitrust claims while their other claims remained pend-\n    ing in the District Court. On its own initiative, the Second Circuit\n    dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher appeal because the order appealed\n    from did not dispose of all of the claims in the consolidated action.\n    The District Court thereafter withdrew its Rule 54(b) certifications.\nHeld: The order dismissing their case in its entirety removed Gelboim\n and Zacher from the consolidated proceeding, thereby triggering their\n right to appeal under §1291.\n    Because cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordinarily\n retain their separate identities, an order disposing of one of the dis-\n crete cases in its entirety should qualify under §1291 as an appeala-\n ble final decision. Section 1407 refers to individual “actions” trans-\n ferrable to a single district court, not to a monolithic multidistrict\n “action” created by transfer. See Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Ber-\n shad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 37. And §1407(a)’s language—“at\n or before the conclusion of . . . pretrial proceedings,” each transferred\n action must be remanded to the originating district “unless [the ac-\n tion] shall have been previously terminated”—indicates Congress’ an-\n ticipation that, during the pendency of pretrial proceedings, final de-\n cisions might be rendered in one or more of the actions consolidated\n pursuant to §1407. The District Court’s order dismissing the Gel-\n boim-Zacher complaint was a final decision. The District Court com-\n pleted its adjudication of petitioners’ complaint and terminated their\n action. Petitioners thus are no longer participants in the consolidat-\n ed proceedings. Nothing about the initial consolidation of their civil\n action with other LIBOR MDL cases renders the dismissal of their\n complaint tentative or incomplete.\n    To hold, as the banks contend, that no appeal of right accrues until\n a §1407 consolidation ends would leave plaintiffs like Gelboim and\n Zacher in a quandary about the event that triggers the 30-day period\n for taking an appeal. The sensible solution to the appeal-clock trig-\n ger is to allow an immediate appeal in a case such as this, where the\n transferee court in an MDL grants a defendant’s dispositive motion\n on every claim (or the sole claim) in a transferred case. The banks\n are also concerned about allowing plaintiffs with the weakest cases to\n appeal because their complaint states only one claim, while leaving\n those with stronger cases unable to appeal simultaneously because\n they have other pending claims. But that concern is attended to by\n Rule 54(b), which authorizes district courts to grant certifications to\n                    Cite as: 574 U.

The District Court did\n that in this very case. Rule 54(b), however, is of no avail to Gelboim\n and Zacher, who asserted only one claim. See Sears, Roebuck & Co.\n v. Mackey, 351 U. S. 427, 435. Section 1292(b)—which allows district\n courts to designate for review certain interlocutory orders—is also\n inapposite here, for there is nothing “interlocutory” about the dismis-\n sal order in the Gelboim-Zacher action.

S. C. §1291. The ques-\ntion here presented: Is the right to appeal secured by\n§1291 affected when a case is consolidated for pretrial\nproceedings in multidistrict litigation (or MDL) authorized\nby 28 U. S. C. §1407?\n   Petitioners Ellen Gelboim and Linda Zacher filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York a class-action complaint raising a single claim.\nThey alleged that a number of banks, acting in concert,\nhad violated federal antitrust law. Their case was consol-\nidated for pretrial proceedings together with some 60\nother cases, commenced in different districts, raising “one\nor more common questions of fact,” §1407(a).\n   The defendant banks, respondents here, moved to dis-\nmiss the Gelboim-Zacher complaint on the ground that the\nplaintiffs had suffered no antitrust injury. The District\nCourt granted the motion, denied leave to amend the\ncomplaint, and dismissed the case in its entirety. Other\n2           GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncases made part of the multidistrict pretrial proceedings,\nhowever, presented discrete claims and remained before\nthe District Court.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, acting on\nits own motion, dismissed the appeal filed by Gelboim and\nZacher for want of appellate jurisdiction. We reverse the\nSecond Circuit’s judgment and hold that the Gelboim-\nZacher complaint retained its independent status for\npurposes of appellate jurisdiction under §1291. Petition-\ners’ right to appeal ripened when the District Court dis-\nmissed their case, not upon eventual completion of multi-\ndistrict proceedings in all of the consolidated cases.\n                               I\n   Three legal prescriptions figure in this case: Title 28\nU. S. C. §§1291 and 1407, and Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\ndure 54(b).\n   Section 1291 gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over\nappeals from “all final decisions of the district courts of the\nUnited States.” A “final decision” is one “by which a dis-\ntrict court disassociates itself from a case.” Swint v.\nChambers County Comm’n, 514 U. S. 35, 42 (1995). While\ndecisions of this Court have accorded §1291 a “practical\nrather than a technical construction,” Mohawk Industries,\nInc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. 100, 106 (2009) (quoting Cohen\nv. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546\n(1949)), the statute’s core application is to rulings that\nterminate an action, see Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S.\n229, 233 (1945) (final decision is “one which ends the\nlitigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to\ndo but execute the judgment”).\n   Rule 54(b) permits district courts to authorize immedi-\nate appeal of dispositive rulings on separate claims in a\ncivil action raising multiple claims:\n    “When an action presents more than one claim for re-\n    lief . . . or when multiple parties are involved, the\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or\n     more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the\n     court expressly determines that there is no just rea-\n     son for delay.”1\nRule 54(b) relaxes “the former general practice that, in\nmultiple claims actions, all the claims had to be finally\ndecided before an appeal could be entertained from a final\ndecision upon any of them.” Sears, Roebuck & Co. v.\nMackey, 351 U. S. 427, 434 (1956). The Federal Rules\nallow a plaintiff to “state [in one complaint] as many\nseparate claims . . . as it has.” Rule 8(d)(3). Rule 54(b)\nwas adopted in view of the breadth of the “civil action” the\nRules allow, specifically “to avoid the possible injustice” of\n“delay[ing] judgment o[n] a distinctly separate claim\n[pending] adjudication of the entire case.” Report of Advi-\nsory Committee on Proposed Amendments to Rules of\nCivil Procedure 70 (1946) (explaining that Rule 54(b) was\nrecast in 1946 to avoid confusion and misapplication); see\nDickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U. S. 507,\n511 (1950) (Rule 54(b) responded to liberalized joinder of\nclaims and parties under the Federal Rules, which “in-\ncreased the danger of hardship and denial of justice\nthrough delay if each issue must await the determination\nof all issues as to all parties before a final judgment can be\nhad”). The Rule thus aimed to augment, not diminish,\nappeal opportunity.\n   Section 1407 is of more recent vintage. Enacted in 1968\nin response to a growing number of complex but related\ncases filed in multiple districts, §1407 authorizes the\nJudicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to trans-\nfer civil actions “involving one or more common questions\n——————\n  1 Compare   Rule 54(b), which lodges discretion to authorize appeals in\ndistrict courts, with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), which au-\nthorizes courts of appeals to permit an immediate appeal from a district\ncourt order granting or denying class-action certification.\n4           GELBOIM v.

Rep.\nNo. 1130, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1968) (§1407 codified\nprocedures used in the early 1960’s to resolve more than\n1,800 separate actions filed against electrical equipment\nmanufacturers in 33 District Courts, all of the actions\nseeking damages for antitrust law violations).\n   Transfer under §1407 aims to “eliminate duplication in\ndiscovery, avoid conflicting rulings and schedules, reduce\nlitigation cost, and save the time and effort of the parties,\nthe attorneys, the witnesses, and the courts.” Manual for\nComplex Litigation §20.131, p. 220 (4th ed. 2004). “Each\naction” transferred pursuant to §1407, the provision in-\nstructs, “shall be remanded by the panel at or before the\nconclusion of . . . pretrial proceedings to the district from\nwhich it was transferred unless it shall have been previ-\nously terminated.” §1407(a).\n                             II\n  The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a\nbenchmark interest rate disseminated by the British\nBankers’ Association based on the rate at which certain\nbanks predict they can borrow funds. LIBOR is a refer-\nence point in determining interest rates for financial\ninstruments in the United States and globally.\n  In August 2011, the JPML established MDL No. 2262\n(LIBOR MDL) for cases involving allegations that the\nbanks named as defendants understated their borrowing\ncosts, thereby depressing LIBOR and enabling the banks\nto pay lower interest rates on financial instruments sold to\ninvestors. In re Libor-Based Financial Instruments Anti-\ntrust Litigation, 802 F. Supp. 2d 1380 (JPML 2011). Com-\nposing the LIBOR MDL, over 60 actions, commenced in\nCalifornia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minne-\nsota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas,\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

The\nfirst three categories involved putative class actions, each\nwith a single lead case: (1) the Gelboim-Zacher action,\nfiled on behalf of purchasers of bonds with LIBOR-linked\ninterest rates; (2) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of\nover-the-counter LIBOR-based instruments (OTC plain-\ntiffs); (3) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of LIBOR-\nbased instruments on exchanges (Exchange plaintiffs).\nThe fourth category, not relevant here, comprised a set of\nindividual actions filed by Charles Schwab Corporation\nand related entities. The Gelboim-Zacher complaint as-\nserted a federal antitrust claim under §1 of the Sherman\nAct, 15 U. S. C. §1, and that claim only, while the com-\nplaints in the other actions asserted a federal antitrust\nclaim in addition to other differently based federal and\nstate claims.\n   Determining that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable\nantitrust injury, the District Court granted the banks’\nmotion to dismiss plaintiffs’ antitrust claims—the sole\nclaim raised in the Gelboim-Zacher complaint. Assuming\nthat the Gelboim-Zacher plaintiffs were entitled to an\nimmediate appeal of right under §1291 because their suit\nhad been “dismissed in [its] entirety,” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n219a, the District Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications\nto the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs authorizing them to\nappeal the dismissal of their antitrust claims while their\nother claims remained pending in the District Court.\n   On its own initiative, the Second Circuit dismissed the\nGelboim-Zacher appeal because the “orde[r] appealed from\ndid not dispose of all claims in the consolidated action.”\n6              GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 2a.2 The District Court thereafter withdrew its\nRule 54(b) certifications in the OTC and Exchange plain-\ntiffs’ actions and, “given the reaction of the Second Cir-\ncuit,” App. 294, denied petitioners’ request for a Rule 54(b)\ncertification.\n   We granted review of the Second Circuit’s judgment\ndismissing the Gelboim-Zacher appeal. 573 U. S. ___\n(2014). Before this Court, petitioners Gelboim and Zacher\ncontend that the order dismissing their case in its entirety\nremoved them from the consolidated proceeding, thereby\ntriggering their right to appeal under §1291. Respondent\nbanks urge that consolidated cases proceed as one unit for\nthe duration of the consolidation. Consequently, they\nmaintain, there is no appeal of right from an order dis-\nmissing fewer than all consolidated claims, thus the sole\navenue for appeal while the consolidation continues is\nRule 54(b). Agreeing with Gelboim and Zacher, we reverse\nthe Court of Appeals’ judgment.\n                             III\n  Cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordi-\nnarily retain their separate identities,3 so an order dispos-\n——————\n   2 The Second Circuit “strong[ly] presum[es]” that a “judgment in a\n\nconsolidated [proceeding] that does not dispose of all [consolidated]\nclaims . . . is not appealable absent Rule 54(b) certification.” Hageman\nv. City Investing Co., 851 F. 2d 69, 71 (1988). In this regard, the Circuit\ndoes not differentiate between all-purpose consolidations, see ibid.\n(actions “could originally have been brought as one action” and there\nwas “no indication that the cases were consolidated only for limited\npurposes”); Houbigant, Inc. v. IMG Fragrance Brands, LLC, 627 F. 3d\n497, 498 (2010) (actions consolidated “for all purposes”), and, as this\ncase illustrates, §1407 consolidations for pretrial proceedings only. The\npresumption may be overcome in “highly unusual circumstances,”\nHageman, 851 F. 2d, at 71, but the Second Circuit has not elaborated\non what those circumstances might be.\n   3 Parties may elect to file a “master complaint” and a corresponding\n\n“consolidated answer,” which supersede prior individual pleadings.

Section\n1407 refers to individual “actions” which may be trans-\nferred to a single district court, not to any monolithic\nmultidistrict “action” created by transfer. See Lexecon Inc.\nv.

It specified\nthat “at or before the conclusion of . . . pretrial proceed-\nings,” each of the transferred actions must be remanded to\nthe originating district “unless [the action] shall have been\npreviously terminated.” §1407(a) (emphasis added).\n   The District Court’s order dismissing the Gelboim-\nZacher complaint for lack of antitrust injury, without\nleave to amend, had the hallmarks of a final decision.\nRuling on the merits of the case, the District Court com-\npleted its adjudication of petitioners’ complaint and termi-\nnated their action. As a result of the District Court’s\ndisposition, petitioners are no longer participants in the\nconsolidated proceedings.

No merger occurs, however, when “the\nmaster complaint is not meant to be a pleading with legal effect but\nonly an administrative summary of the claims brought by all the\nplaintiffs.” Id., at 590.\n   4 We express no opinion on whether an order deciding one of multiple\n\ncases combined in an all-purpose consolidation qualifies under §1291 as\na final decision appealable of right. See Brown v. United States, 976 F.\n2d 1104, 1107 (CA7 1992) (cases consolidated for all purposes “become a\nsingle judicial unit,” but where the consolidation is for limited purposes\nonly, “a decision disposing of all the claims in only one of the cases is a\nfinal decision subject to immediate appeal”).\n8              GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nLIBOR MDL renders the dismissal of their complaint in\nany way tentative or incomplete. As is ordinarily the case,\nthe §1407 consolidation offered convenience for the parties\nand promoted efficient judicial administration, but did not\nmeld the Gelboim-Zacher action and others in the MDL\ninto a single unit. Cf. supra, at 6, n. 3.5\n   The banks’ view that, in a §1407 consolidation, no ap-\npeal of right accrues until the consolidation ends would\nleave plaintiffs like Gelboim and Zacher in a quandary\nabout the proper timing of their appeals. Under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4, which this Court has called\n“jurisdictional,” Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209\n(2007), a notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed\n“within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order ap-\npealed from,” Rule 4(a)(1)(A). If plaintiffs whose actions\nhave been dismissed with prejudice by a district court\nmust await the termination of pretrial proceedings in all\nconsolidated cases, what event or order would start the 30-\nday clock? When pretrial consolidation concludes, there\nmay be no occasion for the entry of any judgment. Orders\nmay issue returning cases to their originating courts,6 but\nan order of that genre would not qualify as the dispositive\n——————\n  5 In delineating the narrow scope of the “collateral-order” doctrine, we\n\nhave cautioned against permitting piecemeal, prejudgment appeals.\nThose admonitions, cited by the banks, Brief for Respondents 18–19,\nare not pertinent here. Under the collateral order doctrine, an order\nmay be deemed “final” if it disposes of a matter “separable from, and\ncollateral to” the merits of the main proceeding, “too important to be\ndenied review,” and “too independent of the cause itself to require that\nappellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.”\nCohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546 (1949).\nThe order dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher complaint in its entirety was\nin no sense “collateral,” i.e., “independent of the cause itself.” Scarcely\na prejudgment ruling, the dismissal order left nothing still pending\ndecision in the District Court.\n  6 In fact, “[f]ew cases [consolidated pursuant to §1407] are remanded\n\nfor trial; most multidistrict litigation is settled in the transferee court.”\nManual for Complex Litigation §20.132, p. 223 (4th ed. 2004).\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nruling Gelboim and Zacher seek to overturn on appeal.\nAnd surely would-be appellants need not await final dis-\nposition of all cases in their originating districts, long after\npretrial consolidation under §1407 could even arguably\njustify treating the cases as a judicial unit.\n  The sensible solution to the appeal-clock trigger is evi-\ndent: When the transferee court overseeing pretrial pro-\nceedings in multidistrict litigation grants a defendant’s\ndispositive motion “on all issues in some transferred cases,\n[those cases] become immediately appealable . . . while\ncases where other issues remain would not be appealable\nat that time.” D. Herr, Multidistrict Litigation Manual\n§9:21, p. 312 (2014).\n  The banks express concern that plaintiffs with the\nweakest cases may be positioned to appeal because their\ncomplaint states only one claim, while plaintiffs with\nstronger cases will be unable to appeal simultaneously\nbecause they have other claims still pending. Brief for\nRespondents 46–47. Rule 54(b) attends to this concern.\nDistrict courts may grant certifications under that Rule,\nthereby enabling plaintiffs in actions that have not been\ndismissed in their entirety to pursue immediate appellate\nreview. That is just what happened in this very case. The\nDistrict Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications to the OTC\nand Exchange plaintiffs so they could appeal at the same\ntime Gelboim and Zacher could. See supra, at 5. And if\nthe MDL court believes that further proceedings might be\nrelevant to a claim a defendant moves to dismiss, the court\nordinarily can defer ruling on the motion, thus allowing all\nplaintiffs to participate in the ongoing MDL proceedings.\n  While Rule 54(b) can aid parties with multiple-claim\ncomplaints—here, the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs, su-\npra, at 5—the Rule, properly read, is of no avail to Gel-\nboim and Zacher. Rule 54(b) addresses orders finally\nadjudicating fewer than all claims presented in a civil\naction complaint. It “does not apply to a single claim\n10            GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\naction nor to a multiple claims action in which all of the\nclaims have been finally decided.” Mackey, 351 U. S., at\n435; see Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U. S. 737,\n742–743 (1976) (Rule 54(b) inapplicable where “complaint\nadvanced a single legal theory which was applied to only\none set of facts”). In short, Rule 54(b) is designed to per-\nmit acceleration of appeals in multiple-claim cases, not to\nretard appeals in single-claim cases.7\n   Section 1292(b), the banks conceded at argument, see\nTr. of Oral Arg. 40–41, is inapposite here. It allows dis-\ntrict courts to designate for review interlocutory orders\n“not otherwise appealable,” where immediate appeal “may\nmaterially advance the ultimate termination of the litiga-\ntion.” §1292(b). The designation may be accepted or\nrejected in the discretion of the court of appeals. Ibid. See\ngenerally Solimine, Revitalizing Interlocutory Appeals in\nthe Federal Courts, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1165 (1990);\nNote, Interlocutory Appeals in the Federal Courts Under\n28 U. S. C. §1292(b), 88 Harv. L. Rev. 607 (1975). It\nsuffices to note that there is nothing “interlocutory” about\nthe dismissal order in the Gelboim-Zacher action.\n                        *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the\nU. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit deeming the\nDistrict Court’s dismissal of the Gelboim-Zacher complaint\nunripe for appellate review, and we remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                     It is so ordered.\n——————\n  7 We need not decide whether or how Rule 54(b) applies to cases con-\n\nsolidated for all purposes involving closely related issues, actions that\ncould have been brought under the umbrella of one complaint. Cf.\nsupra, at 7, n. 4. The Rule surely was not designed to apply to numer-\nous actions that the MDL panel combines for efficient pretrial proceed-\nings because they have in common “one or more questions of fact,” but\notherwise vary in character.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2771752/", "sha1": "df9d7916c6cb03c45e4a6a8b652f851203094f2b", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-01-21T08:01:17.280298"}
