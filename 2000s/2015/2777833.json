CARI D. SEARCY, ET AL. \n\n                ON APPLICATION FOR STAY\n                      [February 9, 2015]\n\n   The application for stay presented to JUSTICE THOMAS\nand by him referred to the Court is denied.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins,\ndissenting from denial of the application for a stay.\n   The Attorney General of Alabama asked us to stay a\nfederal injunction preventing him from enforcing several\nprovisions of Alabama law defining marriage as a legal\nunion of one man and one woman pending our considera-\ntion of Obergefell v. Hodges, No. 14\u2013556; Tanco v. Haslam,\nNo. 14\u2013562; DeBoer v. Snyder, No. 14\u2013571; and Bourke v.\nBeshear, No. 14\u2013574. Those cases are scheduled to be\nargued this Term and present the same constitutional\nquestion at issue here: Whether the Fourteenth Amend-\nment requires States to recognize unions between two\npeople of the same sex as a marriage under state law.\n   When courts declare state laws unconstitutional and\nenjoin state officials from enforcing them, our ordinary\npractice is to suspend those injunctions from taking effect\npending appellate review. See, e.g., Herbert v. Kitchen,\n571 U. S. ___ (2014); see also San Diegans for Mt. Soledad\nNat. War Memorial v. Paulson, 548 U. S. 1301 (2006)\n(KENNEDY, J., in chambers) (staying an injunction requir-\ning a city to remove its religious memorial). Although a\nstay is not a matter of right, this practice reflects the\nparticularly strong showing that States are often able to\nmake in favor of such a stay. Because States are required\n2                   STRANGE v. SEARCY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nto comply with the Constitution, and indeed take care to\ndo so when they enact their laws, it is a rare case in which\na State will be unable to make at least some showing of a\nlikelihood of success on the merits. States also easily meet\nthe requirement of irreparable injury, for \u201c \u2018[a]ny time a\nState is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes\nenacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form\nof irreparable injury.\u2019 \u201d Maryland v. King, 567 U. S. ___,\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 2\u20133) (ROBERTS, C. J., in chambers)\n(quoting New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox\nCo., 434 U. S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in cham-\nbers)). The equities and public interest likewise generally\nweigh in favor of enforcing duly enacted state laws.\n   It was thus no surprise when we granted a stay in simi-\nlar circumstances a little over a year ago. See Herbert v.\nKitchen, supra. Nor was it a surprise when we granted a\nstay in similar circumstances less than six months ago.\nMcQuigg v. Bostic, 573 U. S. ___ (2014). Those decisions\nreflected the appropriate respect we owe to States as\nsovereigns and to the people of those States who approved\nthose laws.\n   This application should have been treated no differently.\nThat the Court more recently denied several stay applica-\ntions in this context is of no moment. Those denials fol-\nlowed this Court\u2019s decision in October not to review seven\npetitions seeking further review of lower court judgments\ninvalidating state marriage laws. Although I disagreed\nwith the decisions to deny those applications, Armstrong v.\nBrenner, ante, p. ___; Wilson v. Condon, ante, p. ___; Moser\nv. Marie, ante, p. ___, I acknowledge that there was at\nleast an argument that the October decision justified an\ninference that the Court would be less likely to grant a\nwrit of certiorari to consider subsequent petitions. That\nargument is no longer credible. The Court has now granted\na writ of certiorari to review these important issues and\nwill do so by the end of the Term. The Attorney General of\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nAlabama is thus in an even better position than the appli-\ncant to whom we granted a stay in Herbert v. Kitchen.\n  Yet rather than treat like applicants alike, the Court\nlooks the other way as yet another Federal District Judge\ncasts aside state laws without making any effort to pre-\nserve the status quo pending the Court\u2019s resolution of a\nconstitutional question it left open in United States v.\nWindsor, 570 U. S. ___ (2013) (slip op., at 25\u201326). This\nacquiescence may well be seen as a signal of the Court\u2019s\nintended resolution of that question. This is not the proper\nway to discharge our Article III responsibilities. And, it is\nindecorous for this Court to pretend that it is.\n  Today\u2019s decision represents yet another example of this\nCourt\u2019s increasingly cavalier attitude toward the States.\nOver the past few months, the Court has repeatedly de-\nnied stays of lower court judgments enjoining the en-\nforcement of state laws on questionable constitutional\ngrounds. See, e.g., Maricopa County v. Lopez-Valenzuela,\n574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 2) (THOMAS, J., joined\nby SCALIA, J., respecting denial of application for stay)\n(collecting cases). It has similarly declined to grant certio-\nrari to review such judgments without any regard for the\npeople who approved those laws in popular referendums or\nelected the representatives who voted for them. In this\ncase, the Court refuses even to grant a temporary stay\nwhen it will resolve the issue at hand in several months.\n  I respectfully dissent from the denial of this application.\nI would have shown the people of Alabama the respect\nthey deserve and preserved the status quo while the Court\nresolves this important constitutional question.\n",
