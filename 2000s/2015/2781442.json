NEBRASKA ET AL.\n\n          ON EXCEPTIONS TO REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER\n\n No. 126, Orig. Argued October 14, 2014—Decided February 24, 2015\nIn 1943, Congress approved the Republican River Compact, an agree-\n  ment between Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado to apportion the “vir-\n  gin water originating in” the Republican River Basin. 57 Stat. 87. In\n  1998, Kansas filed an original action in this Court contending that\n  Nebraska’s increased groundwater pumping was subject to regula-\n  tion by the Compact to the extent that it depleted stream flow in the\n  Basin. This Court agreed. Ensuing negotiations resulted in the 2002\n  Final Settlement Stipulation (Settlement), which established mecha-\n  nisms to accurately measure water and promote compliance with the\n  Compact. The Settlement identified the Accounting Procedures, a\n  technical appendix, as the tool by which the States would measure\n  stream flow depletion, and thus consumption, due to groundwater\n  pumping. The Settlement also reaffirmed that “imported water”—\n  that is, water brought into the Basin by human activity—would not\n  count toward a State’s consumption. Again, the Accounting Proce-\n  dures were to measure, so as to exclude, that water flow.\n     In 2007, following the first post-Settlement accounting period,\n  Kansas petitioned this Court for monetary and injunctive relief,\n  claiming that Nebraska had substantially exceeded its water alloca-\n  tion. Nebraska responded that the Accounting Procedures improper-\n  ly charged the State for using imported water and requested that the\n  Accounting Procedures be modified accordingly. The Court appointed\n  a Special Master. His report concludes that Nebraska “knowingly\n  failed” to comply with the Compact, recommends that Nebraska dis-\n  gorge a portion of its gains in addition to paying damages for Kan-\n  sas’s loss, and recommends denying Kansas’s request for an injunc-\n  tion. In addition, the report recommends reforming the Accounting\n  Procedures. The parties have filed exceptions.\nHeld:\n2                         KANSAS v.

Where the States have\n    negotiated a Compact, the Court is confined to declaring rights under\n    and enforcing its terms. But within those bounds, the Court may in-\n    voke equitable principles to devise “fair … solution[s]” to compact vio-\n    lations. Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 134. And where Con-\n    gress has approved the Compact so that it counts as federal law, see\n    Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 438, the Court may, consistent with\n    the Compact’s express terms, exercise its full authority to remedy\n    violations of, and promote compliance with, the agreement, see Porter\n    v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U. S. 395, 398. Pp. 6–9.\n       2. The Special Master’s determination that Nebraska “knowingly\n    failed” to comply with its Settlement obligations, his recommendation\n    that Nebraska pay Kansas an additional $1.8 million in disgorge-\n    ment, and his recommendation that Kansas’s request for injunctive\n    relief be denied are all adopted. The parties’ exceptions are over-\n    ruled. Pp. 9–20.\n          (a) Nebraska “knowingly failed” to comply with its Settlement\n    obligations, and disgorgement is an appropriate remedy for Nebras-\n    ka’s breach. Pp. 10–17.\n            (i) As the Special Master found, Nebraska failed to put ade-\n    quate compliance mechanisms in place in the face of a known sub-\n    stantial risk that it would violate Kansas’s rights. Nebraska’s argu-\n    ment that it could not have anticipated unprecedented drought\n    conditions fails, because its efforts to comply would have been inade-\n    quate absent the luckiest of circumstances. Nor can the State find\n    refuge in the Compact’s retrospective compliance calculation meth-\n    ods, because it had been warned each year leading up to the final\n    compliance check that it had exceeded its allotment. The Court\n    therefore agrees with the Master that Nebraska “knowingly exposed\n    Kansas to a substantial risk” of receiving less water than it was enti-\n    tled to under the Compact. Report 130. In other words, Nebraska\n    recklessly gambled with Kansas’s rights. Pp. 10–14.\n            (ii) Because Nebraska’s benefit from its breach exceeded the\n    $3.7 million loss Kansas suffered, the Special Master recommended\n    that Nebraska disgorge part of its additional gain. Nebraska con-\n    tends that disgorgement is improper because it did not act “deliber-\n    ately,” which it argues is required for disgorgement in a private con-\n    tract suit. But disgorgement is appropriate where one State has\n    recklessly gambled with another State’s rights to a scarce natural re-\n    source. This Court has said that awarding actual damages in a com-\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                             Syllabus\n\npact case may be inadequate to deter an upstream State from ignor-\ning its obligations where it is advantageous to do so. Texas v. New\nMexico, 482 U. S., at 132. Here, Nebraska took full advantage of its\nfavorable geographic position. And because of the higher value of wa-\nter on Nebraska’s farmland than on Kansas’s, Nebraska could take\nKansas’s water, pay damages, and still benefit. This Court’s remedial\nauthority extends to providing a remedy capable of stabilizing the\nCompact and deterring future breaches, and a disgorgement award\nappropriately does so here. Pp. 14–17.\n      (b) Contrary to Kansas’s contentions, the Master’s partial dis-\ngorgement award is sufficient to achieve those goals. The “flexibility\ninherent in equitable remedies,” Brown v. Plata, 563 U. S. ___, ___,\nallows the Court to order partial disgorgement if appropriate to the\nfacts of the particular case, cf. Kansas v. Colorado, 533 U. S. 1, 14.\nThe Special Master properly took into account Nebraska’s incentives,\npast behavior, and especially its more recent successful compliance\nefforts to determine that a small disgorgement award suffices. For\nrelated reasons, Kansas has failed to demonstrate a “cognizable dan-\nger of recurrent violation” necessary to obtain an injunction. United\nStates v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 633. Pp. 17–20.\n   3. The Special Master’s recommendation to amend the Accounting\nProcedures so that they no longer charge Nebraska for imported wa-\nter is adopted, and Kansas’s exception is overruled. As the Special\nMaster found, in dry conditions, the Accounting Procedures improp-\nerly treat Nebraska’s use of imported water as if it were use of Basin\nwater. Nothing suggests that anyone seriously thought the Account-\ning Procedures would systematically err in this way. Rather, the\nProcedures’ designers assumed that they had succeeded in their goal\nto implement a strict demarcation between virgin and imported wa-\nter.\n   Kansas argues that in spite of these failures, the States must be\nheld to the bargain they struck. That is the ordinary rule. But two\nspecial considerations warrant conforming the Accounting Proce-\ndures to the Compact and the Settlement. First, the remedy is nec-\nessary to prevent serious inaccuracies from distorting the States’ in-\ntended apportionment of interstate waters, as reflected in those\ndocuments. Doing so is consistent with past instances where this\nCourt opted to modify a technical agreement to correct material er-\nrors in the way it operates and thus align it with the compacting\nStates’ intended apportionment. Second, this remedy is required to\navert an outright breach of the Compact—and so a violation of feder-\nal law. As written, the Accounting Procedures go beyond the Com-\npact’s boundaries and deprive Nebraska of its compact rights. The\nMaster’s proposed “5-run formula” solves this problem by excluding\n4                         KANSAS v.

STATES OF \n\n           NEBRASKA AND COLORADO \n\n      ON EXCEPTIONS TO REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER\n                             [February 24, 2015]\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   For the second time in little more than a decade, Kansas\nand Nebraska ask this Court to settle a dispute over the\nStates’ rights to the waters of the Republican River Basin,\nas set out in an interstate compact. The first round of\nlitigation ended with a settlement agreement designed to\nelaborate on, and promote future compliance with, the\nCompact’s terms. The States now bring new claims\nagainst each other arising from the implementation of\nthat settlement. Kansas seeks exceptional relief—both\npartial disgorgement of gains and an injunction—for\nNebraska’s conceded overconsumption of water. For its\npart, Nebraska requests amendment of a technical appen­\ndix to the settlement, so that allocations of water will\nfaithfully reflect the parties’ intent as expressed in both\nthe body of that agreement and the Compact itself. We\nreferred the case to a Special Master and now accept his\nrecommendations as to appropriate equitable remedies: for\nKansas, partial disgorgement but no injunction; and for\nNebraska, reform of the appendix.\n                            I\n  The Republican River originates in Colorado; crosses the\n2                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnorthwestern corner of Kansas into Nebraska; flows\nthrough much of southwestern Nebraska; and finally cuts\nback into northern Kansas. Along with its many tributar­\nies, the river drains a 24,900-square-mile watershed,\ncalled the Republican River Basin. The Basin contains\nsubstantial farmland, producing (among other things)\nwheat and corn.\n   During the Dust Bowl of the 1930’s, the Republican\nRiver Basin experienced an extended drought, interrupted\nonce by a deadly flood. In response, the Federal Govern­\nment proposed constructing reservoirs in the Basin to\ncontrol flooding, as well as undertaking an array of irriga­\ntion projects to disperse the stored water. But the Gov­\nernment insisted that the three States of the Basin first\nagree to an allocation of its water resources. As a result of\nthat prodding, the States negotiated and ratified the\nRepublican River Compact; and in 1943, as required under\nthe Constitution, Art. I, §10, cl. 3, Congress approved that\nagreement. By act of Congress, the Compact thus became\nfederal law. See Act of May 26, 1943, ch. 104, 57 Stat. 86.\n   The Compact apportions among the three States the\n“virgin water supply originating in”—and, as we will later\ndiscuss, originating only in—the Republican River Basin.\nCompact Art. III; see infra, at 20–28. “Virgin water sup­\nply,” as used in the Compact, means “the water supply\nwithin the Basin,” in both the River and its tributaries,\n“undepleted by the activities of man.” Compact Art. II.\nThe Compact gives each State a set share of that supply—\nroughly, 49% to Nebraska, 40% to Kansas, and 11% to\nColorado—for any “beneficial consumptive use.”           Id.,\nArt. IV; see Art. II (defining that term to mean “that use\nby which the water supply of the Basin is consumed\nthrough the activities of man”). In addition, the Compact\ncharges the chief water official of each State with respon­\nsibility to jointly administer the agreement. See id.,\nArt. IX. Pursuant to that provision, the States created the\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nRepublican River Compact Administration (RRCA). The\nRRCA’s chief task is to calculate the Basin’s annual virgin\nwater supply by measuring stream flow throughout the\narea, and to determine (retrospectively) whether each\nState’s use of that water has stayed within its allocation.\n   All was smooth sailing for decades, until Kansas com­\nplained to this Court about Nebraska’s increased pumping\nof groundwater, resulting from that State’s construction of\n“thousands of wells hydraulically connected to the Repub­\nlican River and its tributaries.” Bill of Complaint, O. T.\n1997, No. 126, Orig., p. 5 (May 26, 1998). Kansas con­\ntended that such activity was subject to the Compact: To\nthe extent groundwater pumping depleted stream flow in\nthe Basin, it counted against the pumping State’s annual\nallotment of water.1 Nebraska maintained, to the con­\ntrary, that groundwater pumping fell outside the Com­\npact’s scope, even if that activity diminished stream flow\nin the area. A Special Master we appointed favored Kan­\nsas’s interpretation of the Compact; we summarily agreed,\nand recommitted the case to him for further proceedings.\nSee Kansas v. Nebraska, 530 U. S. 1272 (2000). The\nStates then entered into negotiations, aimed primarily at\ndetermining how best to measure, and reflect in Compact\naccounting, the depletion of the Basin’s stream flow due to\ngroundwater pumping. During those discussions, the\nStates also addressed a range of other matters affecting\nCompact administration. The talks bore fruit in 2002,\nwhen the States signed the Final Settlement Stipulation\n(Settlement).\n   The Settlement established detailed mechanisms to\npromote compliance with the Compact’s terms. The States\n——————\n  1 As we will later discuss, groundwater pumping does not diminish\n\nstream flow (and thus the Basin’s “virgin water supply”) at a 1-to-1\nratio. See Report of Special Master 19 (Report); infra, at 21–22. In\nother words, a State can pump a bucketful of groundwater without\nreducing stream flow by the same amount.\n4                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagreed that the Settlement was not “intended to, nor could\n[it], change [their] respective rights and obligations under\nthe Compact.” Settlement §I(D). Rather, the agreement\naimed to accurately measure the supply and use of the\nBasin’s water, and to assist the States in staying within\ntheir prescribed limits. To smooth out year-to-year fluctu­\nations and otherwise facilitate compliance, the Settlement\nbased all Compact accounting on 5-year running averages,\nreduced to 2-year averages in “water-short” periods. Id.,\n§§IV(D), V(B). That change gave each State a chance to\ncompensate for one (or more) year’s overuse with another\n(or more) year’s underuse before exceeding its allocation.\nThe Settlement further provided, in line with this Court’s\ndecision, that groundwater pumping would count as part\nof a State’s consumption to the extent it depleted the\nBasin’s stream flow. An appendix to the agreement called\nthe “Accounting Procedures” described how a later-\ndeveloped “Groundwater Model” (essentially, a mass of\ncomputer code) would perform those computations. Id.,\nApp. C; id., App. J1. And finally, the Settlement made\nclear, in accordance with the Compact, that a State’s use\nof “imported water”—that is, water farmers bring into the\narea (usually for irrigation) that eventually seeps into the\nRepublican River—would not count toward the State’s\nallocation, because it did not originate in the Basin. Id.,\n§§II, IV(F). Once again, the Settlement identified the\nAccounting Procedures and Groundwater Model as the\ntools to calculate (so as to exclude) that consumption.\n   But there were more rapids ahead: By 2007, Kansas and\nNebraska each had complaints about how the Settlement\nwas working. Kansas protested that in the 2005–2006\naccounting period—the first for which the Settlement held\nStates responsible—Nebraska had substantially exceeded\nits allocation of water. Nebraska, for its part, maintained\nthat the Accounting Procedures and Groundwater Model\nwere charging the State for use of imported water—\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nspecifically, for water originating in the Platte River Ba­\nsin. The States brought those disputes to the RRCA and\nthen to non-binding arbitration, in accordance with the\nSettlement’s dispute resolution provisions. After failing to\nresolve the disagreements in those forums, Kansas sought\nredress in this Court, petitioning for both monetary and\ninjunctive relief. We referred the case to a Special Master\nto consider Kansas’s claims. See 563 U. S. ___ (2011). In\nthat proceeding, Nebraska asserted a counterclaim re­\nquesting a modification of the Accounting Procedures to\nensure that its use of Platte River water would not count\ntoward its Compact allocation.\n   After two years of conducting hearings, receiving evi­\ndence, and entertaining legal arguments, the Special\nMaster issued his report and recommendations. The\nMaster concluded that Nebraska had “knowingly failed” to\ncomply with the Compact in the 2005–2006 accounting\nperiod, by consuming 70,869 acre-feet of water in excess of\nits prescribed share.2 Report 112. To remedy that breach,\nthe Master proposed awarding Kansas $3.7 million for its\nloss, and another $1.8 million in partial disgorgement of\nNebraska’s still greater gains. The Master, however,\nthought that an injunction against Nebraska was not\nwarranted. In addition, the Master recommended reform­\ning the Accounting Procedures in line with Nebraska’s\nrequest, to ensure that the State would not be charged\nwith using Platte River water.\n   Kansas and Nebraska each filed exceptions in this Court\nto parts of the Special Master’s report.3 Nebraska objects\n——————\n  2 An acre-foot of water is pretty much what it sounds like. If you took\n\nan acre of land and covered it evenly with water one foot deep, you\nwould have an acre-foot of water.\n  3 Colorado has also played a minor part in this dispute, and in this\n\nCourt it filed a brief reiterating one of Nebraska’s exceptions. Because\nKansas and Nebraska are the primary antagonists here, we will refer\nto that claim only as Nebraska’s. From here on in, Colorado drops off\n6                        KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto the Master’s finding of a “knowing” breach and his call\nfor partial disgorgement of its gains. Kansas asserts that\nthe Master should have recommended both a larger dis­\ngorgement award and injunctive relief; the State also\nobjects to his proposed change to the Accounting Proce­\ndures. In reviewing those claims, this Court gives the\nSpecial Master’s factual findings “respect and a tacit\npresumption of correctness.” Colorado v. New Mexico, 467\nU. S. 310, 317 (1984). But we conduct an “independent\nreview of the record,” and assume “the ultimate responsi­\nbility for deciding” all matters. Ibid. Having carried out\nthat careful review, we now overrule all exceptions and\nadopt the Master’s recommendations.\n                                II\n  The Constitution gives this Court original jurisdiction to\nhear suits between the States. See Art. III, §2. Proceed­\nings under that grant of jurisdiction are “basically equi­\ntable in nature.” Ohio v. Kentucky, 410 U. S. 641, 648\n(1973). When the Court exercises its original jurisdiction\nover a controversy between two States, it serves “as a\nsubstitute for the diplomatic settlement of controversies\nbetween sovereigns and a possible resort to force.” North\nDakota v. Minnesota, 263 U. S. 365, 372–373 (1923). That\nrole significantly “differ[s] from” the one the Court under­\ntakes “in suits between private parties.” Id., at 372; see\nFrankfurter & Landis, The Compact Clause of the Consti­\ntution—A Study in Interstate Adjustments, 34 Yale L. J.\n685, 705 (1925) (When a “controversy concerns two States\nwe are at once in a world wholly different from that of a\nlaw-suit between John Doe and Richard Roe over the\nmetes and bounds of Blackacre”).

The first relates to the subject matter of the Com­\npact and Settlement: rights to an interstate waterway.\nThe second concerns the Compact’s status as not just an\nagreement, but a federal law. Before proceeding to the\nmerits of this dispute, we say a few words about each.\n   This Court has recognized for more than a century its\ninherent authority, as part of the Constitution’s grant of\noriginal jurisdiction, to equitably apportion interstate\nstreams between States. In Kansas v. Colorado, 185 U. S.\n125, 145 (1902), we confronted a simple consequence of\ngeography: An upstream State can appropriate all water\nfrom a river, thus “wholly depriv[ing]” a downstream State\n“of the benefit of water” that “by nature” would flow into\nits territory. In such a circumstance, the downstream\nState lacks the sovereign’s usual power to respond—the\ncapacity to “make war[,] . . . grant letters of marque and\nreprisal,” or even enter into agreements without the con­\nsent of Congress. Id., at 143 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). “Bound hand and foot by the prohibitions of the\nConstitution, . . . a resort to the judicial power is the only\nmeans left” for stopping an inequitable taking of water.\nId., at 144 (quoting Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">657</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 726 (1838)).\n   This Court’s authority to apportion interstate streams\nencourages States to enter into compacts with each other.\nWhen the division of water is not “left to the pleasure” of\nthe upstream State, but States instead “know[ ] that some\ntribunal can decide on the right,” then “controversies will\n[probably] be settled by compact.” Kansas v. Colorado,\n185 U. S., at 144. And that, of course, is what happened\nhere: Kansas and Nebraska negotiated a compact to divide\n8                      KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe waters of the Republican River and its tributaries.\nOur role thus shifts: It is now to declare rights under the\nCompact and enforce its terms. See Texas v. New Mexico,\n462 U. S. 554, 567 (1983).\n   But in doing so, we remain aware that the States bar­\ngained for those rights in the shadow of our equitable\napportionment power—that is, our capacity to prevent one\nState from taking advantage of another. Each State’s\n“right to invoke the original jurisdiction of this Court [is]\nan important part of the context” in which any compact is\nmade. Id., at 569. And it is “difficult to conceive” that a\ndownstream State “would trade away its right” to our\nequitable apportionment if, under such an agreement, an\nupstream State could avoid its obligations or otherwise\ncontinue overreaching. Ibid. Accordingly, our enforce­\nment authority includes the ability to provide the reme­\ndies necessary to prevent abuse. We may invoke equitable\nprinciples, so long as consistent with the compact itself, to\ndevise “fair . . . solution[s]” to the state-parties’ disputes\nand provide effective relief for their violations. Texas v.\nNew Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 134 (1987) (supplying an “ad­\nditional enforcement mechanism” to ensure an upstream\nState’s compliance with a compact).4\n   And that remedial authority gains still greater force\nbecause the Compact, having received Congress’s blessing,\ncounts as federal law. See Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433,\n438 (1981) (“[C]ongressional consent transforms an inter­\nstate compact . . . into a law of the United States”). Of\ncourse, that legal status underscores a limit on our en­\nforcement power: We may not “order relief inconsistent\nwith [a compact’s] express terms.” Texas v. New Mexico,\n——————\n  4 JUSTICE THOMAS misdescribes this aspect of our decision. See post,\n\nat 3, 15 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter\nthe dissent). Far from claiming the power to alter a compact to fit our\nown views of fairness, we insist only upon broad remedial authority to\nenforce the Compact’s terms and deter future violations.\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

But within those limits, the Court may\nexercise its full authority to remedy violations of and\npromote compliance with the agreement, so as to give\ncomplete effect to public law. As we have previously put\nthe point: When federal law is at issue and “the public\ninterest is involved,” a federal court’s “equitable powers\nassume an even broader and more flexible character than\nwhen only a private controversy is at stake.” Porter v.\nWarner Holding Co., 328 U. S. 395, 398 (1946); see Virgin-\nian R. Co. v. Railway Employees, 300 U. S. 515, 552 (1937)\n(“Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much far­\nther” to give “relief in furtherance of the public interest\nthan they are accustomed to go when only private inter­\nests are involved”).5 In exercising our jurisdiction, we may\n“mould each decree to the necessities of the particular\ncase” and “accord full justice” to all parties. Porter, 328\nU. S., at 398 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Ken-\ntucky v. Dennison, 65 U. S., at 98. These principles inform\nour consideration of the dispute before us.\n                            III\n  We first address Nebraska’s breach of the Compact and\nSettlement and the remedies appropriate to that violation.\nBoth parties assent to the Special Master’s finding that in\n\n——————\n  5 The dissent objects that these precedents do not apply to “water\n\ndisputes between States” because such clashes involve “sovereign\nrights.” See post, at 4–5. But in making that claim, the dissent ignores\nthe effect of the Constitution: By insisting that Congress approve a\ncompact like this one, the Constitution turns the agreement into a\nfederal law like any other. See Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 439–\n440 (1981) (“By vesting in Congress the power to grant or withhold\nconsent, . . . the Framers sought to ensure that Congress would main­\ntain ultimate supervisory power over cooperative state action that\nmight otherwise interfere with the full and free exercise of federal\nauthority”). That constitutional choice means that the judicial authority\nwe have recognized to give effect to, and remedy violations of, federal\nlaw fully attends a compact.\n10                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n2005–2006 Nebraska exceeded its allocation of water by\n70,869 acre-feet—about 17% more than its proper share.\nSee Report 88–89; App. B to Reply Brief for Kansas. They\nsimilarly agree that this overconsumption resulted in a\n$3.7 million loss to Kansas; and Nebraska has agreed to\npay those damages. See Reply Brief for Kansas 9, 55;\nBrief for Nebraska 7. But the parties dispute whether\nNebraska’s conduct warrants additional relief. The Mas­\nter determined that Nebraska “knowingly exposed Kansas\nto a substantial risk” of breach, and so “knowingly failed”\nto comply with the Compact. Report 130, 112; see supra,\nat 5. Based in part on that finding, he recommended\ndisgorgement of $1.8 million, which he described as “a\nsmall portion of the amount by which Nebraska’s gain\nexceeds Kansas’s loss.” Report 179. But he declined to\ngrant Kansas’s request for injunctive relief against Ne­\nbraska. See id., at 180–186. As noted previously, see\nsupra, at 5–6, each party finds something to dislike in the\nMaster’s handling of this issue: Nebraska contests his\nfinding of a “knowing” Compact violation and his view that\ndisgorgement is appropriate; Kansas wants a larger dis­\ngorgement award and an injunction regulating Nebraska’s\nfuture conduct. We address those exceptions in turn.\n                             A\n                             1\n  When they entered into the Settlement in 2002, the\nStates understood that Nebraska would have to signifi­\ncantly reduce its consumption of Republican River water.\nSee Report 106. The Settlement, after all, charged Ne­\nbraska for its depletion of the Basin’s stream flow due to\ngroundwater pumping—an amount the State had not\npreviously counted toward its allotment. See supra, at 3.\nNebraska did not have to achieve all that reduction in the\nnext year: The Settlement’s adoption of multi-year averages\nto measure consumption allowed the State some time—\n                    Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhow much depended on whether and when “water-short”\nconditions existed—to come into compliance. See Settle­\nment §§IV(D), V(B)(2)(e)(i), App. B; supra, at 4. As it\nturned out, the area experienced a drought in 2006; ac­\ncordingly, Nebraska first needed to demonstrate compli­\nance in that year, based on the State’s average consump­\ntion of water in 2005 and 2006.6 And at that initial\ncompliance check, despite having enjoyed several years to\nprepare, Nebraska came up markedly short.\n   Nebraska contends, contrary to the Master’s finding,\nthat it could not have anticipated breaching the Compact\nin those years. By its account, the State took “persistent\nand earnest”—indeed, “extraordinary”—steps to comply\nwith the agreement, including amending its water law to\nreduce groundwater pumping. Brief for Nebraska 9, 17.\nAnd Nebraska could not have foreseen (or so it claims)\nthat those measures would prove inadequate. First, Ne­\nbraska avers, drought conditions between 2002 and 2006\nreduced the State’s yearly allotments to historically low\nlevels; the Master was thus “unfair to suggest Nebraska\nshould have anticipated what never before was known.”\nId., at 17. And second, Nebraska stresses, the RRCA\ndetermines each State’s use of water only retrospectively,\ncalculating each spring what a State consumed the year\nbefore; hence, Nebraska “could not have known” that it\nwas out of compliance in 2006 “until early 2007—when it\nwas already too late.” Id., at 18; see supra, at 3.\n   But that argument does not hold water: Rather, as the\nSpecial Master found, Nebraska failed to put in place\nadequate mechanisms for staying within its allotment in\nthe face of a known substantial risk that it would other­\nwise violate Kansas’s rights. See Report 105–112, 130. As\nan initial matter, the State’s efforts to reduce its use of\n——————\n  6 Had rainfall been more plentiful, Nebraska would have had to show\n\ncompliance in 2007, based on its average use from 2003 onward.\n12                     KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nRepublican River water came at a snail-like pace. The\nNebraska Legislature waited a year and a half after sign­\ning the Settlement to amend the State’s water law. See\n§55, 2004 Neb. Laws p. 352, codified at Neb. Rev. Stat. 46–\n715. And the fix the legislature adopted—the develop­\nment of regional water management plans meant to de­\ncrease groundwater pumping—did not go into effect for\nstill another year. Nebraska thus wasted the time follow­\ning the Settlement—a crucial period to begin bringing\ndown the State’s consumption. Indeed, the State’s overuse\nof Republican River water actually rose significantly from\n2003 through 2005, making compliance at the eventual\nday of reckoning ever more difficult to achieve. See Report\n108–109.7 And to make matters worse, Nebraska knew\nthat decreasing pumping does not instantly boost stream\nflow: A time lag, of as much as a year, exists between the\none and the other. See id., at 106. So Nebraska’s several-\nyear delay in taking any corrective action foreseeably\nraised the risk that the State would breach the Compact.\n   Still more important, what was too late was also too\nlittle. The water management plans finally adopted in\n2005 called for only a 5% reduction in groundwater pump­\ning, although no evidence suggested that would suffice.\nThe testimony presented to the Special Master gave not a\nhint that the state and local officials charged with formu­\nlating those plans had conducted a serious appraisal of\nhow much change would be necessary. See id., at 107–\n108. And the State had created no way to enforce even the\npaltry goal the plans set. The Nebraska Legislature chose\nto leave operational control of water use in the hands of\ndistrict boards consisting primarily of irrigators, who are\n\n——————\n  7 Had 2006 not been a “water-short” year, all those overages would\nhave gone into Nebraska’s 5-year average; as it was, the dry conditions\ntriggered the alternative 2-year period, so the 2003 and 2004 overages\ndropped out of the RRCA’s calculations.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\namong the immediate beneficiaries of pumping. No sanc­\ntions or other mechanisms held those local bodies to ac­\ncount if they failed to meet the plans’ benchmark. They\nbore no legal responsibility for complying with the Com­\npact, and assumed no share of the penalties the State\nwould pay for violations. See id., at 110–111. Given such\na dearth of tools or incentives to achieve compliance, the\nwonder is only that Nebraska did not still further exceed\nits allotment.\n   Nor do Nebraska’s excuses change our view of its mis­\nbehavior. True enough, the years following the Settlement\nwere exceptionally arid. But the Compact and Settlement\n(unsurprisingly) contemplate wet and dry years alike. By\ncontrast, Nebraska’s plans could have brought it into\ncompliance only if the Basin had received a stretch of\ncopious rainfall. See id., at 109–110. And Nebraska\ncannot take refuge in the timing of the RRCA’s calcula­\ntions. By the time the compliance check of 2006 loomed,\nNebraska knew that it had exceeded its allotment (by an\never greater margin) in each of the three previous years.\nAs Nebraska’s own witnesses informed the Special Master,\nthey “could clearly see” by the beginning of 2006 “that [the\nState] had not done enough” to come into compliance. Id.,\nat 109 (quoting Tr. 1333 (Aug. 21, 2012)). Indeed, in that\nyear, Nebraska began purchasing its farmers’ rights to\nsurface water in order to mitigate its anticipated breach.\nBut that last-minute effort, in the Master’s words, “fell\nwoefully short”—as at that point could only have been\nexpected. Report 109. From the outset of the Settlement\nthrough 2006, Nebraska headed—absent the luckiest of\ncircumstances—straight toward a Compact violation.\n   For these reasons, we agree with the Master’s conclu­\nsion that Nebraska “knowingly exposed Kansas to a sub­\nstantial risk” of receiving less water than the Compact\nprovided, and so “knowingly failed” to comply with the\nobligations that agreement imposed. Id., at 130, 112. In\n14                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe early years of the Settlement, as the Master explained,\nNebraska’s compliance efforts were not only inadequate,\nbut also “reluctant,” showing a disinclination “to take [the]\nfirm action” necessary “to meet the challenges of foresee-\nably varying conditions in the Basin.” Id., at 105. Or said\nanother way, Nebraska recklessly gambled with Kansas’s\nrights, consciously disregarding a substantial probability\nthat its actions would deprive Kansas of the water to\nwhich it was entitled. See Tr. 1870 (Aug. 23, 2012) (Mas­\nter’s statement that Nebraska showed “reckless indiffer­\nence as to compliance back in ’05 and ’06”).\n                              2\n  After determining that Kansas lost $3.7 million from\nNebraska’s breach, the Special Master considered the case\nfor an additional monetary award. Based on detailed\nevidence, not contested here, he concluded that an acre-\nfoot of water is substantially more valuable on farmland in\nNebraska than in Kansas. That meant Nebraska’s reward\nfor breaching the Compact was “much larger than Kansas’\nloss, likely by more than several multiples.” Report 178.\nGiven the circumstances, the Master thought that Ne­\nbraska should have to disgorge part of that additional\ngain, to the tune of $1.8 million. In making that recom­\nmendation, he relied on his finding—which we have just\naffirmed—of Nebraska’s culpability. See id., at 130. He\nalso highlighted this Court’s broad remedial powers in\ncompact litigation, noting that such cases involve not\nprivate parties’ private quarrels, but States’ clashes over\nfederal law. See id., at 131, 135; supra, at 6–9.\n  Nebraska (along with the dissent) opposes the Special\nMaster’s disgorgement proposal on the ground that the\nState did not “deliberately act[ ]” to violate the Compact.\nReply Brief for Nebraska 33; see post, at 6–7. Relying on\nprivate contract law, Nebraska cites a Restatement provi­\nsion declaring that a court may award disgorgement in\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncertain cases in which “a deliberate breach of contract\nresults in profit to the defaulting promisor.” Restatement\n(Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment §39(1)\n(2010) (Restatement); see Reply Brief for Nebraska 32.\nNebraska then points out that the Master, even though\nfinding a “knowing” exposure of Kansas to significant risk,\nrejected the idea that “Nebraska officials [had] deliber­\nately set out to violate the Compact.” Brief for Nebraska 16\n(quoting Report 111). Accordingly, Nebraska concludes,\nno disgorgement is warranted.\n   But that argument fails to come to terms with what the\nMaster properly understood as the wrongful nature of\nNebraska’s conduct. True enough, as the Master said,\nthat Nebraska did not purposefully set out to breach the\nCompact. But still, as he also found, the State “knowingly\nexposed Kansas to a substantial risk” of breach, and\nblithely proceeded. Report 130. In some areas of the law\nand for certain purposes, the distinction between purpose­\nfully invading and recklessly disregarding another’s rights\nmakes no difference. See Bullock v. BankChampaign,\nN. A., 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (“We include\nas intentional . . . reckless conduct” of the kind that the\nlaw “often treats as the equivalent”); Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 193–194, n. 12 (1976)\n(“[R]ecklessness is [sometimes] considered to be a form of\nintentional conduct for purposes of imposing liability”).\nAnd indeed, the very Restatement Nebraska relies on\ntreats the two similarly. It assimilates “deliberate[ness]”\nto “conscious wrongdoing,” which it defines as acting (as\nNebraska did) “despite a known risk that the conduct . . .\nviolates [another’s] rights.” Restatement §39, Comment f;\nid., §51(3). Conversely, the Restatement distinguishes\n“deliberate[ness]” from behavior (not akin to Nebraska’s)\namounting to mere “inadvertence, negligence, or unsuc­\ncessful attempt at performance.” Id., §39, Comment f.\n   And whatever is true of a private contract action, the\n16                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncase for disgorgement becomes still stronger when one\nState gambles with another State’s rights to a scarce\nnatural resource. From the time this Court began to\napportion interstate rivers, it has recognized part of its\nrole as guarding against upstream States’ inequitable\ntakings of water. And as we have noted, that concern\npersists even after States enter into a compact: This Court\nmay then exercise remedial authority to ensure compli­\nance with the compact’s terms—thus preventing a geo­\ngraphically favored State from appropriating more than\nits share of a river. See supra, at 8. Indeed, the formation\nof such a compact provides this Court with enhanced\nremedial power because, as we have described, the agree­\nment is also an Act of Congress, and its breach a violation\nof federal law. See supra, at 8–9; Porter, 328 U. S. 395\n(exercising equitable power to disgorge profits gained from\nviolating a federal statute). Consistent with those princi­\nples, we have stated that awarding actual damages for a\ncompact’s infringement may be inadequate, because that\nremedy alone “would permit [an upstream State] to ignore\nits obligation to deliver water as long as it is willing” to\npay that amount. Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S., at 132.\nAnd as the Solicitor General noted in argument here, “[i]t\nis important that water flows down the river, not just\nmoney.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 24. Accordingly, this Court may\norder disgorgement of gains, if needed to stabilize a com­\npact and deter future breaches, when a State has demon­\nstrated reckless disregard of another, more vulnerable\nState’s rights under that instrument.\n   Assessed in this light, a disgorgement order constitutes\na “fair and equitable” remedy for Nebraska’s breach.\nTexas v. New Mexico, 482 U.S., at 134. “Possessing the\nprivilege of being upstream,” Nebraska can (physically,\nthough not legally) drain all the water it wants from the\nRepublican River. Report 130. And the higher value of\nwater on Nebraska’s farmland than on Kansas’s means\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Nebraska can take water that under the Compact\nshould go to Kansas, pay Kansas actual damages, and still\ncome out ahead. That is nearly a recipe for breach—for an\nupstream State to refuse to deliver to its downstream\nneighbor the water to which the latter is entitled. And\nthrough 2006, Nebraska took full advantage of its favor­\nable position, eschewing steps that would effectively control\ngroundwater pumping and thus exceeding its allotment.\nIn such circumstances, a disgorgement award appropri­\nately reminds Nebraska of its legal obligations, deters future\nviolations, and promotes the Compact’s successful admin­\nistration. See Porter, 328 U. S., at 400 (“Future compli­\nance may be more definitely assured if one is compelled to\nrestore one’s illegal gains”).8 We thus reject Nebraska’s\nexception to the Master’s proposed remedy.\n                            B\n  Kansas assails the Special Master’s recommended dis­\ngorgement award from the other direction, claiming that it\nis too low to ensure Nebraska’s future compliance. See\nBrief for Kansas 55–59. Notably, Kansas does not insist\non all of Nebraska’s gain. It recognizes the difficulty of\nascertaining that figure, given the evidence the parties\npresented. See id., at 56; see also Report 177–178. And\nstill more important, it “agrees” with the Master’s view\nthat the Court should select a “fair point on th[e] spec­\ntrum” between no profits and full profits, based on the\n——————\n  8 An award of specific performance may accomplish much the same\n\nobjectives, as the dissent notes. See post, at 10–11. But for various\nreasons, a remedy in the form of water is not always feasible. See\nTexas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 132 (1987). Here, both States\nconcurred that using water as the remedial currency would lead to\ndifficult questions about the proper timing and location of delivery. See\nReport 129–130. (That agreement is especially notable given the\noverall contentiousness of this litigation.) In such circumstances,\nthe Master appropriately found another way of preventing knowing\nmisbehavior.\n18                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntotality of facts and interests in the case. Brief for Kansas\n57 (quoting Report 135); see Sur-Reply Brief for Kansas 5.\nIn setting that point, however, Kansas comes up with a\nhigher number—or actually, a trio of them. The State\nfirst asks us to award “treble damages of $11.1 million,”\nthen suggests that we can go “up to roughly $25 million,”\nand finally proposes a “1:1 loss-to-disgorgement ratio,”\nwhich means $3.7 million of Nebraska’s gains. Brief for\nKansas 57; Sur-Reply Brief for Kansas 5, 7.\n   We prefer to stick with the Master’s single number. As\nan initial matter, we agree with both the Master and\nKansas that disgorgement need not be all or nothing. See,\ne.g., 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies §2.4(1), p. 92 (2d ed.\n1993) (“Balancing of equities and hardships may lead the\ncourt to grant some equitable relief but not” the full meas­\nure requested); Restatement §39, Comment i; id., §50,\nComment a; National Security Systems, Inc. v. Iola, 700\nF. 3d 65, 80–81, 101–102 (CA3 2012). In exercising our\noriginal jurisdiction, this Court recognizes that “flexibility\n[is] inherent in equitable remedies,” Brown v. Plata, 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 41) (quoting Hutto v.\nFinney, 437 U. S. 678, 687, n. 9 (1978)), and awards them\n“with reference to the facts of the particular case,” Texas v.\nNew Mexico, 482 U. S., at 131 (quoting Haffner v. Dobrin-\nski, 215 U. S. 446, 450 (1910)). So if partial disgorgement\nwill serve to stabilize a compact by conveying an effective\nmessage to the breaching party that it must work hard to\nmeet its future obligations, then the Court has discretion\nto order only that much. Cf. Kansas v. Colorado, 533 U. S.\n1, 14 (2001) (concluding that a master “acted properly in\ncarefully analyzing the facts of the case and in only award­\ning as much prejudgment interest as was required by a\nbalancing of the equities”).\n   And we agree with the Master’s judgment that a rela­\ntively small disgorgement award suffices here. That is\nbecause, as the Master detailed, Nebraska altered its\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconduct after the 2006 breach, and has complied with the\nCompact ever since. See Report 112–118, 180. In 2007,\nNebraska enacted new legislation establishing a mecha­\nnism to accurately forecast the State’s annual allotment of\nRepublican River water. §23, 2007 Neb. Laws p. 1600,\ncodified at Neb. Rev. Stat. 46–715(6). Further, a new\nround of water management plans called for localities to\nreduce groundwater pumping by five times as much as the\nold (5%) target. And most important, those plans imple­\nmented a system for the State, in dry years, to force dis­\ntricts to curtail both surface water use and groundwater\npumping. That “regulatory back-stop,” as Nebraska calls\nit, corrects the State’s original error of leaving all control\nof water use to unaccountable local actors. Report 113\n(quoting Direct Testimony of Brian Dunnigan, Director,\nNebraska Department of Resources ¶43 (July 25, 2012));\nsee supra, at 12–13. Testimony before the Master showed\nthat if the scheme had been in effect between 2002 and\n2006, Nebraska would have lived within its allocation\nthroughout that period. See Report 117. The Master thus\nreasonably concluded that the current water management\nplans, if implemented in good faith, “will be effective to\nmaintain compliance even in extraordinarily dry years.”\nSee id., at 118. And so the Master had good cause to\nrecommend the modest award he did, which serves as an\never-present reminder to Nebraska, but does not assume\nits continuing misconduct.\n   Truth be told, we cannot be sure why the Master selected\nthe exact number he did—why, that is, he arrived at\n$1.8 million, rather than a little more or a little less. The\nMaster’s Report, in this single respect, contains less ex­\nplanation than we might like. But then again, any hard\nnumber reflecting a balance of equities can seem random\nin a certain light—as Kansas’s own briefs, with their ever-\nfluctuating ideas for a disgorgement award, amply attest.\nWhat matters is that the Master took into account the\n20                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nappropriate considerations—weighing Nebraska’s incen­\ntives, past behavior, and more recent compliance efforts—\nin determining the kind of signal necessary to prevent\nanother breach. We are thus confident that in approving\nthe Master’s recommendation for about half again Kan­\nsas’s actual damages, we award a fair and equitable remedy\nsuited to the circumstances.\n   For related reasons, we also reject Kansas’s request for\nan injunction ordering Nebraska to comply with the Com­\npact and Settlement. Kansas wants such an order so that\nit can seek contempt sanctions against Nebraska for any\nfuture breach. See Brief for Kansas 36–44. But we agree\nwith the Master that Kansas has failed to show, as it must\nto obtain an injunction, a “cognizable danger of recurrent\nviolation.” United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629,\n633 (1953). As just discussed, Nebraska’s new compliance\nmeasures, so long as followed, are up to the task of keep­\ning the State within its allotment. And Nebraska is now\non notice that if it relapses, it may again be subject to\ndisgorgement of gains—either in part or in full, as the\nequities warrant. That, we trust, will adequately guard\nagainst Nebraska’s repeating its former practices.\n                           IV\n  The final question before us concerns the Special Mas­\nter’s handling of Nebraska’s counterclaim. As we have\nnoted, Nebraska contended that the Settlement’s Account­\ning Procedures inadvertently charge the State for using\n“imported water”—specifically, water from the Platte\nRiver—in conflict with the parties’ intent in both the\nCompact and the Settlement. See supra, at 4–5. The\nMaster agreed, and recommended modifying the Proce­\ndures by adopting an approach that the parties call the “5­\nrun formula,” to ensure that Nebraska’s consumption of\nPlatte River water will not count toward its Compact\nallotment. Kansas now objects to that proposed remedy.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Compact, recall, apportions the virgin water supply\nof the Republican River and its tributaries—nothing less,\nbut also nothing more. See Compact Art. III; supra, at 2.\nOne complexity of that project arises from water’s . . . well,\nfluid quality. Nebraska imports water from the Platte\nRiver, outside the Republican River Basin and thus out­\nside the Compact’s scope, to irrigate farmland. And that\nimported water simply will not stay still: Some of it seeps\nthrough the ground and raises stream flow in the Republi­\ncan River and its tributaries. See Second Report of Spe­\ncial Master, O. T. 1999, No. 126, Orig., pp. 62–63 (Second\nReport). In negotiating the Settlement, the States under­\ntook—as part of their effort to accurately apportion the\nBasin’s water—to exclude all such imported water from\ntheir calculations. Reflecting the Compact’s own scope,\n§IV(F) of the Settlement states, in no uncertain terms,\nthat “Beneficial Consumptive Use of Imported Water\nSupply shall not count as Computed Beneficial Consump­\ntive Use” of Republican River Basin water. Which means,\nwithout all that distracting capitalization, that when\nNebraska consumes imported water that has found its\nway into the Basin’s streams, that use shall not count\ntoward its Compact allotment. But that edict of course\nrequires calculating (in order to exclude) the State’s con­\nsumption of imported water. The Settlement’s Accounting\nProcedures, in tandem with its Groundwater Model, are\nthe tools the parties employ to make that computation.\n   But as the Master found, the Procedures (and Model)\nfounder in performing that task in dry conditions: They\ntreat Nebraska’s use of imported water as if it were use of\nBasin water. That failure flows from the way the Proce­\ndures measure a State’s consumption of water resulting\nfrom groundwater pumping. According to the Settlement,\nsuch pumping is to count against a State’s allotment only\nto the extent it reduces stream flow in specified areas—\nwhich it rarely does in a 1-to-1 ratio and sometimes does\n22                      KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnot do at all. See id., §IV(C)(1); Report 19; n. 1, supra.\nMost notable here, pumping cannot deplete an already\nwholly dry stream—and in arid conditions, some of the\nBasin’s tributaries in fact run dry. As the Master put the\npoint, stream flow in a given area “fall[s] as groundwater\npumping increases until it hits zero, at which point it falls\nno more even as groundwater pumping continues.” Report\n34. When that point arrives, Nebraska’s continued pump­\ning should not count as consumption of the Basin’s virgin\nwater. But—and here lies the rub—imported water (from\nthe Platte) can create stream flow in what would other­\nwise be a dry riverbed. And the Accounting Procedures\n(and Model) fail to account for that possibility; accordingly,\nthey see depletion of the Basin’s stream flow—the sole\nmeasure of the State’s consumption—where they should\nnot. The result is to count imported water toward the\nState’s consumption of Basin water. In 2006, for example,\nthe Procedures charged Nebraska with using 7,797 acre-\nfeet of Platte River water, over 4% of the State’s allotment.\nBy our estimate, just that single year’s miscalculation cost\nNebraska over $1 million. See id., at 37, 176.\n   The Master specifically determined, and our review of\nthe relevant testimony confirms, that the parties did not\nknow the Accounting Procedures would have that effect.\nSee id., at 23–32. The States intended the Procedures (as\nper the Compact and Settlement) to count only consump­\ntion of the Basin’s own water supply—and correlatively, to\nexclude use of water from the Platte. See id., at 23–25;\nsee also Second Report 37, 64 (same conclusion reached by\nthe Special Master approving the Settlement). There is no\nevidence that anyone seriously thought, much less dis­\ncussed, that the Accounting Procedures might systemati­\ncally err in accomplishing those computations. See Report\n26–27.9 And because no one knew of the fault in the Pro­\n——————\n 9 Kansas   argues otherwise, see Brief for Kansas 28–29, but the part of\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                   23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncedures, no one could possibly trade it off for other items\nduring the parties’ negotiations. Thus, as the Master\nfound, Nebraska did not receive anything, nor did Kansas\ngive up anything, in exchange for the (unknown) error.\nSee id., at 28–31. To the contrary, as all witnesses ex­\nplained, the designers of the Procedures worked single­\nmindedly to implement the Compact’s and Settlement’s\nstrict demarcation between virgin and imported water—\nand assumed they had succeeded. See id., at 31–32.\n  But even if all that is so, Kansas argues (along with the\ndissent) that a deal is a deal is a deal—and this deal did\nnot include the 5-run formula the Master now proposes.\nSee Brief for Kansas 31–34; post, at 15–19. On that view,\nthe parties’ clear intent to exclude imported water does\nnot matter; nor does their failure to appreciate that the\nProcedures, in opposition to that goal, would count such\nwater in material amounts. According to Kansas, so long\nas the parties bargained (as they did) for the Procedures\nthey got, that is the end of the matter: No one should now\nbe heard to say that there is a better mode of accounting.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 54–55.\n  That argument, however, does not pass muster. Of\ncourse, courts generally hold parties to the deals they\nmake; and of course, courts should hesitate, and then\nhesitate some more, before modifying a contract, even to\nremove an inadvertent flaw. But in this Compact case,\ntwo special (and linked) considerations warrant reforming\nthe Accounting Procedures as the Master has proposed—\nor better phrased, warrant conforming those Procedures to\nthe parties’ underlying agreements. First, that remedy is\n——————\nthe record it cites further proves our point. There, Colorado’s expert\ntestified that during development of the Groundwater Model—months\nafter adoption of the Accounting Procedures—he “intellectually under­\nstood” that the imported-water problem could occur, but “didn’t think\nthat it would” and didn’t recall the issue ever coming up in discussions.\nReport 26 (quoting Tr. 676 (Aug. 13, 2012)); id., at 727–728.\n24                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessary to prevent serious inaccuracies from distorting\nthe States’ intended apportionment of interstate waters,\nas reflected in both the Compact and the Settlement. And\nsecond, it is required to avert an outright breach of the\nCompact—and so a violation of federal law. We address\neach point in turn.\n   In resolving water disputes, this Court has opted to\ncorrect subsidiary technical agreements to promote accu­\nracy in apportioning waters under a compact. In Texas v.\nNew Mexico, for example, the parties entered into a com­\npact that based division of the Pecos River on certain\nconditions existing in 1947. The States further agreed\nthat those conditions were described and defined in a\nparticular engineering report. But that report turned out\nto contain material errors.       Notwithstanding Texas’s\nobjection that the parties had assented to its use, we set\naside the flawed study and adopted a new technical docu­\nment that more accurately depicted the real-world condi­\ntions of the compact’s specified baseline year. See 446\nU. S. 540 (1980) (per curiam) (setting aside the old docu­\nment); 462 U. S., at 562–563 (describing the litigation);\n467 U. S. 1238 (1984) (approving the new document); 482\nU. S., at 127 (describing that approval).\n   Similarly, in Kansas v. Colorado, 543 U. S. 86 (2004), we\nmodified an agreement to ensure that it would correctly\nmeasure Colorado’s compliance with the Arkansas River\nCompact. The parties had consented to use a computer\nmodel on a year-by-year basis to gauge their consumption\nof water. See id., at 102 (“[B]oth [States] agreed to the\nuse of annual measurement”). But after a time, a special\nmaster determined that annual accounting produced\nserious errors, whereas employing a 10-year measuring\nperiod accurately determined compact compliance. Over\nKansas’s protest, we accordingly approved the Master’s\nalteration of the parties’ agreement to assess compliance\neach year. And in countering Kansas’s objection to the\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    25\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nintroduction of a 10-year measuring period, we posited\nthat the compact’s drafters, albeit unaware of “complex\ncomputer modeling[,] . . . would have preferred accurate\nmeasurement.” Ibid.10\n  The teaching of those cases applies as well to this one:\nIn each, this Court’s authority to devise “fair and equitable\nsolutions” to interstate water disputes encompasses modi­\nfying a technical agreement to correct material errors in\nthe way it operates and thus align it with the compacting\nStates’ intended apportionment. Texas v. New Mexico, 482\nU. S., at 134; cf. Kansas v. Colorado, 543 U. S., at 102\n(“After all, a ‘credit’ for surplus water that rests upon\ninaccurate measurement is not really a credit at all”).\nMuch as in Texas v. New Mexico and Kansas v. Colorado,\nthe subsidiary Accounting Procedures here failed to accu­\nrately measure what they were supposed to. Modifying\nthose Procedures does no more than make them consonant\nwith the Compact and Settlement, ensuring that they help\n——————\n  10 The dissent misunderstands the meaning and relevance of these\ndecisions. It is of course true, as the dissent says, that in neither case\ndid the Court reform a compact. See post, at 16–17. What the Court\ndid do, contrary to the dissent’s protestations, was what we do here:\nmodify an ancillary agreement to make sure it accurately implemented\na compact’s apportionment. In Texas v. New Mexico, we interpreted a\ncompact term, as the dissent says, see post, at 16; but we additionally\nthrew out a technical report that the parties agreed would effectuate\nthat term when it later proved erroneous. And similarly in Kansas v.\nColorado, we altered an ancillary agreement to measure water usage\nyear by year. The dissent contends that the States in that case had no\nsuch agreement, though acknowledging that they had one to calculate\ndamages on an annual basis. See post, at 17. But the two were one and\nthe same. Damages arise from violations, and violations occur when a\nState consumes too much water. In calling for year-by-year measure­\nment of damages, the agreement also called for year-by-year assess­\nment of consumption. And nothing supports the dissent’s claim that\nthis agreement applied only retrospectively, rather than to assess both\nusage and damages on an ongoing basis. So to impose a 10-year meas­\nuring period, consistent with accurate apportionment under the Com­\npact, we had to alter the agreement.\n26                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto realize, rather than frustrate, the agreed-upon division\nof water.\n   Indeed, the case for modification is still stronger here,\nbecause (as we explain below) the Accounting Procedures\nas written affirmatively violate the Compact. That accord\nis the supreme law in this case: As the States explicitly\nrecognized, they could not change the Compact’s terms\neven if they tried. See Settlement §I(D) (“[T]his Stipula­\ntion and the Proposed Consent Judgment are not intended\nto, nor could they, change the States’ respective rights and\nobligations under the Compact”). That is a function of the\nCompact’s status as federal law, which binds the States\nunless and until Congress says otherwise. And Congress,\nof course, has not said otherwise here. To enter into a\nsettlement contrary to the Compact is to violate a federal\nstatute. See Vermont v. New York, 417 U. S. 270, 278\n(1974) (per curiam). And as we have discussed, our equi­\ntable authority to grant remedies is at its apex when\npublic rights and obligations are thus implicated. See\nPorter, 328 U. S., at 398; supra, at 8–9.\n   The Accounting Procedures’ treatment of imported\nwater first conflicts with the Compact by going beyond its\nboundaries—in essence, by regulating water ultra vires.\nAccording to its terms, the Compact pertains, and pertains\nonly, to “virgin water supply originating in” the Republi­\ncan River Basin. Compact Art. III; see supra, at 2, 21.\nThe agreement’s very first Article drives that point home:\n“The physical and other conditions peculiar to the Basin\nconstitute the basis for this compact,” and nothing in it\nrelates to any other waterway. To divide or otherwise\nregulate streams outside the Basin, the States would have\nto enter into a separate agreement and gain congressional\napproval. (The reason no one thought the Settlement\nneeded such consent is precisely because it purported to\nstay within the Compact’s limits. See Settlement §I(D))\nAnd yet, the Accounting Procedures have the effect of\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nincluding such outside water within the Compact’s appor­\ntionment scheme (by counting its use against a State’s\nallotment). The Procedures make water from the Platte\nsubject to the Compact, in contravention of its scope; or\nconversely stated, they expand the Compact’s prescribed\nscope to cover water from the Platte. That is not within\nthe States’ authority.\n   What is more, the Procedures’ treatment of imported\nwater deprives Nebraska of its rights under the Compact\nto the Basin’s own water supply. That is because the\ninescapable effect of charging Nebraska for the use of\nimported water, as the Procedures do, is to reduce the\namount of Republican River water the State may con­\nsume. Suppose the Compact grants 100 units of Republi­\ncan River water to Nebraska and Kansas alike; and fur­\nther assume that the Accounting Procedures count 10\nunits of Platte River water toward Nebraska’s allotment.\nThat means Nebraska may now consume only 90 units of\nRepublican River water (or else pay Kansas damages).\nThe Procedures thus change the States’ shares of Basin\nwater, to Nebraska’s detriment: Nebraska now has less,\nand Kansas relatively more, than the Compact allows.\nThat, too, lies outside what the States can do.\n   In light of all the above, we think the Master’s proposed\nsolution the best one possible. The 5-run formula that he\nrecommends conforms the Procedures to both the Compact\nand the Settlement by excluding imported water from the\ncalculation of each State’s consumption. See Report 55–\n56; id., at App. F. Kansas has not provided any workable\nalternative to align the Accounting Procedures with the\nCompact and Settlement. Nor has Kansas credibly shown\nthat this simple change will introduce any other inaccu­\nracy into Compact accounting. See id., at 58–68. The\namendment will damage Kansas in no way other than by\ntaking away something to which it is not entitled. In\nanother case, with another history, we might prefer to\n28                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninstruct the parties to figure out for themselves how to\nbring the Accounting Procedures into line with the Com­\npact. See New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296, 313\n(1921) (noting that negotiation is usually the best way to\nsolve interstate disputes). But we doubt that further\ndiscussion about this issue will prove productive. Arbitra­\ntion has already failed to produce agreement about how to\ncorrect the Procedures. See supra, at 5. And before the\nSpecial Master, both parties indicated that further “dis­\npute resolution proceedings before the RRCA or an arbi­\ntrator” would be “futile.” Report 69 (quoting Case Man­\nagement Order No. 9 ¶5 (Jan. 25, 2013)). We accordingly\nadopt the Master’s recommendation to amend the Ac­\ncounting Procedures so that they no longer charge Ne­\nbraska for imported water.\n                             V\n   Nebraska argues here for a cramped view of our author­\nity to order disgorgement. Kansas argues for a similarly\nrestrictive idea of our power to modify a technical docu­\nment. We think each has too narrow an understanding of\nthis Court’s role in disputes arising from compacts appor­\ntioning interstate streams. The Court has broad remedial\nauthority in such cases to enforce the compact’s terms.\nHere, compelling Nebraska to disgorge profits deters it\nfrom taking advantage of its upstream position to appro­\npriate more water than the Compact allows. And amend­\ning the Accounting Procedures ensures that the Compact’s\nprovisions will govern the division of the Republican River\nBasin’s (and only that Basin’s) water supply. Both reme­\ndies safeguard the Compact; both insist that States live\nwithin its law.

We have\nrepeatedly said that “we will not order relief inconsistent\nwith the express terms of a compact, no matter what the\nequities of the circumstances might otherwise invite.” Id.,\nat 352 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n                               B\n   Rather than apply “the principles of contract law,”\nTarrant Regional Water Dist., supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n11), the majority calls upon broad equitable power. Ante,\nat 6–9. It evidently draws this power from its “inherent\nauthority” to apportion interstate streams in the absence\nof an interstate water compact. Ante, at 7. In the major­\nity’s view, States bargain for water rights “in the shadow of\nour equitable apportionment power,” and thus we “may\ninvoke equitable principles” to “devise fair . . . solutions” to\ndisputes between States about the bargains they struck.\nAnte, at 8 (internal quotation marks and alteration\nomitted).\n   That conclusion gets things backwards: As we have\nexplained, once a compact is formed, “courts have no\npower to substitute their own notions of an equitable\napportionment for the apportionment chosen by Congress”\nand the States. Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 568\n(1983) (Texas II ) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The majority next asserts “still greater” equitable power\nby equating contract disputes between sovereign States\nwith cases involving federal law and the public interest.\n4                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nAnte, at 8–9. Although the majority recognizes that it\n“may not order relief inconsistent with a compact’s express\nterms,” it claims enlarged powers “within those limits.”\nAnte, at 9 (internal quotation marks and alterations omit­\nted). “When federal law is at issue and the public interest\nis involved,” the majority says, the Court’s equitable pow­\ners are “even broader and more flexible” than when it\nresolves a private-law dispute. Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   But the precedents on which the majority relies to jus-\ntify this power have nothing to do with water disputes\nbetween States. The majority cites Porter v. Warner Hold-\ning Co., 328 U. S. 395 (1946), which involved a suit by the\nAdministrator of the Office of Price Administration for an\ninjunction against a landlord who had charged too much\nrent in violation of the Emergency Price Control Act of\n1942. In that case, the Court recognized a public interest\nin the Administrator’s effort to “enforce compliance” with\nthe Act, and “to give effect to its purposes.” Id., at 398,\n400. The Court reasoned that, “since the public interest is\ninvolved in a proceeding of this nature, [a district court’s]\nequitable powers assume an even broader and more flexi­\nble character than when only a private controversy is at\nstake.” Id., at 398. The authority Porter cited for this\npoint was Virginian R. Co. v. Railway Employees, 300\nU. S. 515 (1937), a case on which the majority likewise\nrelies. Ante, at 9. But that case, like Porter, did not in­\nvolve a state party or an interstate water dispute; instead,\nit concerned a dispute between private parties—a railroad\nand its employees’ union—arising under the Railway\nLabor Act. Virginian R. Co., supra, at 538. As in Porter,\nthe Court recognized a public interest in the enforcement\nof a federal administrative scheme, explaining that Con­\ngress had made a “declaration of public interest and policy\nwhich should be persuasive in inducing courts to give\nrelief.” 300 U. S., at 552.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n   This case, by contrast, involves the inherent authority of\nsovereign States to regulate the use of water. The States’\n“power to control navigation, fishing, and other public uses\nof water” is not a function of a federal regulatory program;\nit “is an essential attribute of [state] sovereignty.” Tar-\nrant Regional Water Dist., 569 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, when the Court\nresolves an interstate water dispute, it deals not with\npublic policies created by federal statutes, but pre-existing\nsovereign rights, allocated according to the mutual agree­\nment of the parties with the consent of Congress. Al­\nthough the consent of Congress makes statutes of com­\npacts, our flexibility in overseeing a federal statute that\npertains to the exercise of these sovereign powers is not\nthe same as the flexibility Porter claimed for courts en­\ngaged in supervising the administration of a federal regu­\nlatory program. Authority over water is a core attribute of\nstate sovereignty, and “[f ]ederal courts should pause\nbefore using their inherent equitable powers to intrude\ninto the proper sphere of the States.” Missouri v. Jenkins,\n515 U. S. 70, 131 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring).\n   Moreover, even if the involvement of “public interests”\nmight augment the Court’s equitable powers in the con­\ntext of disputes involving regulated parties and their\nregulators, it does not have the same effect in a dispute\nbetween States. States—unlike common carriers and\nlandlords—“possess sovereignty concurrent with that of\nthe Federal Government.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.\n452, 457 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nStates thus come before this Court as sovereigns, seeking\nour assistance in resolving disputes “of such seriousness\nthat it would [otherwise] amount to a casus belli.” Ne-\nbraska v. Wyoming, 515 U. S. 1, 8 (1995) (internal quota­\ntion marks omitted). The Federalist Papers emphasized\nthat this Court’s role in resolving interstate disputes\n“[would] not change the principle” of state sovereignty,\n6                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nand they gave assurances that the Court would take “all\nthe usual and most effectual precautions” necessary for\nimpartial and principled adjudication. The Federalist No.\n39, pp. 245–246 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).\n  For that reason, when the parties before this Court are\nStates, the Court should be more circumspect in its use of\nequitable remedies, not less. We have explained, for\nexample, that “[w]e are especially reluctant to read absent\nterms into an interstate compact given the federalism and\nseparation-of-powers concerns that would arise were we to\nrewrite an agreement among sovereign States, to which\nthe political branches consented.” Alabama, 560 U. S., at\n352. The use of unbounded equitable power against\nStates similarly threatens “to violate principles of state\nsovereignty and of the separation of powers,” Jenkins, 515\nU. S., at 130 (THOMAS, J., concurring). In controversies\namong States, the Court should therefore “exercise the\npower to impose equitable remedies only sparingly, subject\nto clear rules guiding its use.” Id., at 131.\n                            II\n  Applying ordinary contract principles, I would reject the\nSpecial Master’s recommendation to order disgorgement of\nNebraska’s profits for breach of a compact. That remedy\nis not available for a nondeliberate breach of a contract.\nAnd even if it were, such an award must be based on\nNebraska’s profits, not the arbitrary number the Master\nselected.\n                              A\n                              1\n  Although our precedents have not foreclosed disgorge­\nment of profits as a remedy for breach of a water compact,\nthey have suggested that disgorgement would be avail-\nable, if at all, only for the most culpable breaches: those\nthat are “deliberate.” Texas III, 482 U. S., at 132. The\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ntraditional remedy for breach of a water compact has been\nperformance through delivery of water. See Kansas v.\nColorado, 533 U. S. 1, 23 (2001) (O’Connor, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). Although we deviated\nfrom that traditional remedy in Texas III, when we au­\nthorized money damages, 482 U. S., at 132, the majority\ncites no case in which we have ever awarded disgorge­\nment. The lone reference to that remedy in our precedents\nis dictum in Texas III asserting that the money damages\naward in that case would not encourage efficient breaches\nof water compacts “in light of the authority to order . . .\nwhatever additional sanction might be thought necessary\nfor deliberate failure to perform . . . .” Ibid.\n   The lack of support for disgorgement in our compact\ncases comports with the general law of remedies. The\nusual remedy for breach of a contract is damages based on\nthe injured party’s “actual loss caused by the breach.”\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts §347, Comment e, p.\n116 (1979). Disgorgement, by contrast, is an extraordi­\nnary remedy that goes beyond a plaintiff ’s damages,\nrequiring the breaching party to refund additional profits\ngained in the breach. See 3 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies\n§12.7(3), pp. 166–167 (2d ed. 1993). In American law,\ndisgorgement of profits is not generally an available rem-\nedy for breach of contract. Id., §12.7(4), at 171.\n   Even if Texas III supported a narrow exception for cases\ninvolving deliberate breach of a water compact, that ex­\nception would not apply here. Although it is uncontested\nthat Nebraska breached the Compact and that Kansas lost\n$3.7 million as a result, ante, at 9–10, the Master expressly\nfound that there is no evidence that Nebraska deliber-\nately breached the Compact. Report of Special Master\n111, 130 (Report). In fact, Nebraska’s efforts “were ear­\nnest and substantial enough to preclude a finding that this\nwas a consciously opportunistic breach.” Id., at 131. And\nalthough the majority adopts the finding that Nebraska\n8                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n“knowingly failed” to comply with the Compact, ante, at 13\n(internal quotation marks omitted), a finding that I do not\ndispute, neither the parties nor the majority disagrees\nwith the Master’s conclusion that Nebraska did not inten­\ntionally or deliberately breach the Compact, ante, at 10–\n14. Under such circumstances, disgorgement is not an\navailable remedy.\n                             2\n   The Special Master nevertheless recommended dis­\ngorgement because Nebraska “knowingly exposed Kansas\nto a substantial risk” of noncompliance. Report 130. He\nrested this recommendation on the Restatement (Third) of\nRestitution and Unjust Enrichment §39 (2010). See Re­\nport 130–134. That section proposes awarding disgorge­\nment when a party’s profits from its breach are greater\nthan the loss to the other party. The remedy is thought\nnecessary because one party may “exploit the shortcom­\nings” of traditional damages remedies by breaching con­\ntracts when its expected profits exceed the damages it\nwould be required to pay to the other party. Restatement\n(Third) of Restitution §39, Comment b, at 649. In other\nwords, the remedy “condemns a form of conscious\nadvantage-taking” and seeks to thwart an “opportunistic\ncalculation” that breaching is better than performing.\nIbid.\n   This Court, however, has never before relied on §39 nor\nadopted its proposed theory of disgorgement. And for good\nreason: It lacks support in the law. One reviewer of §39\nhas described it as a “novel extension” of restitution prin­\nciples that “will alter the doctrinal landscape of contract\nlaw.” Roberts, Restitutionary Disgorgement for Opportun­\nistic Breach of Contract and Mitigation of Damages, 42\nLoyola (LA) L. Rev. 131, 134 (2008). And few courts have\never relied on §39. The sheer novelty of this proposed\nremedy counsels against applying it here.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             9\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  In any event, §39 opines that disgorgement should be\navailable only when a party deliberately breaches a con­\ntract. This makes sense. If disgorgement is an antidote\nfor “efficient breach,” then it need only be administered\nwhen “conscious advantage-taking” and “opportunistic\ncalculation” are present. But as noted above, the Master\nexpressly found that no deliberate breach occurred. Re­\nport 130. The Master’s reliance on §39 was accordingly\nmisplaced.\n                                 3\n   Perhaps recognizing the weakness in the Master’s rec­\nommendation, the majority takes a different approach,\nfashioning a new remedy of disgorgement for reckless\nbreach. According to the majority, Nebraska’s conduct\nwas essentially reckless, ante, at 14, and the Court may\norder disgorgement “when a State has demonstrated\nreckless disregard” for another State’s contractual rights,\nante, at 16. As with the Restatement’s proposed theory,\nthere is no basis for that proposition in our cases.\n   Because disgorgement is available, if at all, only in cases\nof deliberate breach, the majority asserts that, “[i]n some\nareas of the law,” the line between intent and reckless\ndisregard “makes no difference.” Ante, at 15. Accepting\nthe truth of that proposition in some circumstances, the\nmajority’s caveat acknowledges that it is not true in oth­\ners. Indeed, the law often places significant weight on the\ndistinction between intentional and reckless conduct. See,\ne.g., Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 61 (1998) (dis­\ncussing “ ‘willful,’ ” “deliberate,” and “intentional” conduct,\nand distinguishing those terms from “reckless” conduct);\nsee also Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 563\nU. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 13–14) (distinguish­\ning “willful blindness” from “recklessness”).\n   The majority provides scant support for its conclusion\nthat breach of an interstate water compact is an area in\n10                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nwhich the line between intent and recklessness is practi­\ncally irrelevant. It first relies on Bullock v. BankCham-\npaign, N. A., 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 1), in\nwhich the Court determined the mental state necessary\nfor “ ‘defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,’ ” as\nused in the Bankruptcy Code. Ante, at 15. In the absence\nof a fiduciary relationship, however, Bullock has little\nrelevance. Cf. Harris Trust and Sav. Bank v. Salomon\nSmith Barney Inc., 530 U. S. 238, 250 (2000) (noting the\nspecial disgorgement rules that apply “when a trustee in\nbreach of his fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries transfers\ntrust property to a third person”).\n   The majority next relies on Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n425 U. S. 185 (1976), which addressed “scienter” under\n§10(b) of the Securities Act of 1933. Ante, at 15 (citing 425\nU. S., at 193–194, n. 12). The Court noted that it used the\nterm “scienter” to mean “intent to deceive, manipulate, or\ndefraud.” Id., at 194, n. 12. It then asserted—in dictum\nand without support—that recklessness is considered to be\na form of intentional conduct in some areas of the law, but\nit declined to address whether reckless conduct could be\nsufficient for §10(b) liability. Ibid. That dictum is hardly\nsufficient grounds for claiming that recklessness and\nintent are equivalent mental states in compact disputes\nbetween States.\n   If anything, the reverse is true. Disgorgement is strong\nmedicine, and as with other forms of equitable power, we\nshould impose it against the States “only sparingly.”\nJenkins, 515 U. S., at 131 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The\nmajority insists that the justification for disgorgement is\nenhanced “when one State gambles with another State’s\nrights to a scarce natural resource.” Ante, at 16. But the\nway this Court has always discouraged gambling with this\nscarce resource is to require delivery of water, not money.\nPrior to 1987, “we had never even suggested that mone­\ntary damages could be recovered from a State as a remedy\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nfor its violation of an interstate compact apportioning the\nflow of an interstate stream.” Kansas v. Colorado, 533\nU. S., at 23 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissent­\ning in part). If a State’s right to the “scarce natural re­\nsource” of water is the problem, then perhaps the Court\nought to follow its usual practice of ordering specific per­\nformance rather than improvising a new remedy of “reck­\nless disgorgement.”\n                              B\n   The majority compounds its errors by authorizing an\narbitrary amount of disgorgement. As explained above,\nthe measure of the disgorgement award should be the\nprofits derived from a deliberate breach. Yet the Special\nMaster acknowledged that its $1.8 million award was not\nbased on any measure of Nebraska’s profits from breach­\ning the Compact. Report 179–180. The Master gave no\ndollar estimate of Nebraska’s profits and said only that its\ngain was “very much larger than Kansas’ loss” of $3.7\nmillion, “likely by more than several multiples.” Id., at\n178. Despite producing no estimate more precise than\n“very much larger,” the Master ordered a disgorgement\naward of $1.8 million. Id., at 178–179.\n   The majority explains that “we cannot be sure why the\nMaster selected the exact number he did.” Ante, at 19.\nIndeed. Neither the majority nor the Special Master nor I\ncan identify a justifiable basis for this amount. It appears\nthat $1.8 million just feels like not too much, but not too\nlittle.\n   We should hold ourselves to a higher standard. In other\ncontexts, we have demanded that district courts “provide\nproper justification” for a monetary award rather than\ndivining an amount that appears to be “essentially arbi­\ntrary.” Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. 542, 557 (2010). We\nshould do the same ourselves if we are going to award\ndisgorgement here. As with ordinary damages, disgorge­\n12                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nment should not be awarded “beyond an amount that the\nevidence permits to be established with reasonable cer­\ntainty.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §352. And a\ndisgorgement award ought to be calculated based on some­\nthing more than the Special Master’s intuitions.\n   The majority claims that the Master “took into account\nthe appropriate considerations,” including “Nebraska’s\nincentives, past behavior, and more recent compliance\nefforts” in reaching the award. Ante, at 19. But it makes\nno difference that he took those factors into account if he\narrived at a number that has no articulable relationship to\nNebraska’s profits. Equitable disgorgement is not an\narbitrary penalty designed to compel compliance, nor\nshould it become one.\n   What is more, the Master considered factors beyond\nthose relevant to the calculation of a disgorgement award.\nIn his view, $1.8 million “moves substantially towards\nturning the actual recovery by Kansas, net of reasonable\ntransaction costs, into an amount that approximates a full\nrecovery for the harm suffered.” Report 179. In other\nwords, $1.8 million makes Kansas whole because it is a\nreasonable estimate of Kansas’ “transaction costs”—which\npresumably means the State’s attorney’s fees and litiga­\ntion costs. But, under the “American Rule,” we generally\ndo not award attorney’s fees “to a prevailing party absent\nexplicit statutory authority.” Buckhannon Board & Care\nHome, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human\nResources, 532 U. S. 598, 602 (2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). And neither the majority, nor Kansas,\nnor the Special Master offers any support for the proposi­\ntion that a disgorgement award can smuggle in an award\nof attorney’s fees. If disgorgement were an appropriate\nremedy in this case, then the Court should require a calcu­\nlation based on Nebraska’s profits rather than Kansas’\n“transaction costs.”\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n   I would also reject the Master’s recommendation to\nreform the Settlement because that recommendation\nconflicts with the equitable doctrine of reformation. The\nremedy of reformation is available to correct a contract if,\n“owing to mutual mistake, the language used therein did\nnot fully or accurately express the agreement and inten­\ntion of the parties.” Philippine Sugar Estates Development\nCo. v. Government of Philippine Islands, 247 U. S. 385,\n389 (1918). The well-established rule is that, when a\nwritten contract “fails to express the agreement because of\na mistake of both parties as to the contents or effect of the\nwriting, the court may at the request of a party reform the\nwriting to express the agreement.” Restatement (Second)\nof Contracts §155, at 406.\n   Reformation is thus available only when the parties\nreach an agreement but then “fail to express it correctly in\nthe writing.” Id., Comment a, at 406. If “the parties make\na written agreement that they would not otherwise have\nmade because of a mistake other than one as to expres­\nsion, the court will not reform a writing to reflect the\nagreement that it thinks they would have made.” Id.,\nComment b, at 408. Because modifying a written agree­\nment is an extraordinary step, a party seeking reformation\nmust prove the existence of a mutual mistake of expres­\nsion by “ ‘clear and convincing evidence.’ ” Id., Comment c,\nat 410.\n   Nebraska cannot meet that burden because the States\nmade no mistake in reducing their agreement to writing.\nHere are the terms the States agreed upon in their bind­\ning Settlement:\n    “Beneficial Consumptive Use of Imported Water Sup­\n    ply shall not count as Computed Beneficial Consump­\n    tive Use or Virgin Water Supply. . . . Determinations\n14                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n     of Beneficial Consumptive Use from Imported Water\n     Supply (whether determined expressly or by implica­\n     tion) . . . shall be calculated in accordance with the\n     [Republican River Compact Admin. (RRCA)] Account­\n     ing Procedures and by using the RRCA Groundwater\n     Model.” Settlement §IV(F), p. 25.\nThe States thus agreed not to count water imported from\noutside the Republican River Basin. But in the very same\nprovision, they agreed to calculate the use of imported\nwater using the RRCA Accounting Procedures and the\nRRCA Groundwater Model. The terms of the Settlement\nare thus crystal clear: The accounting procedures control\ndeterminations of consumptive use of imported water.\nAnd the parties do not contend that they made any draft­\ning mistake in recording the accounting procedures or the\ngroundwater model.\n   Instead, the parties’ mistake was their belief that the\naccounting procedures and water model they agreed upon\nwould accurately exclude imported water from the calcula­\ntion of Nebraska’s consumptive use. They were wrong\nabout this. In fact, under dry weather conditions, when\nnative water flows are depleted, the water model charges\nNebraska for pumping imported water. Report 32–37.\nThe parties did not realize the magnitude of this error. To\nthe extent they thought about it at all, they realized the\nwater model was not perfectly precise, but assumed that\nonly very small, immaterial amounts of imported water\nwould make their way into the calculations. See id., at 27.\nA key member of the modeling committee testified that he\nwas “intellectually aware” of the imported-water issue, but\nthat “we didn’t believe that that was going to be a big\nissue.” See Tr. 727 (testimony of Willem Schreüder).\n   There is no testimony from any source suggesting that\nthe parties agreed to a different water model. See Report\n26–27. Nebraska thus cannot meet its burden to show by\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

The parties knew\nwhat the methodology was and they expressly agreed to\nthat methodology. They simply thought the methodology\nwould work better than it did. See Tr. 727. Even though\nthe methodology they agreed upon was imperfect, a writ­\ning may be reformed only to conform with the parties’\nactual agreement, not to create a better one.\n  The appropriate equitable remedy, if any, in these cir­\ncumstances would be rescission, not reformation. In gen­\neral, if there is a mutual mistake “as to a basic assumption\non which the contract was made,” the adversely affected\nparty may seek to avoid the contract. Restatement (Sec­\nond) of Contracts §152, at 385; see also id., §155, Com­\nment b, Illustration 4, at 409 (noting that reformation is\nnot available to remedy a mistake as to something other\nthan reducing the agreement to writing). The States have\nnot asked for rescission, of course, but it is incorrect to\nsuggest, see ante, at 27, that there is no other solution to\nthis problem.\n                             B\n   Realizing that ordinary reformation is not available for\nNebraska, the majority again summons its equitable\npower and renegotiates the accounting procedures to\ncreate what it considers a fairer agreement for the States.\nIn doing so, it announces a new doctrine of reformation: In\nresolving water disputes, the Court will “correct subsidi­\nary technical agreements to promote accuracy in appor­\ntion[ment].” Ante, at 24. From here on out, the Court will\n“modif[y] a technical agreement to correct material errors\nin the way it operates and thus align it with the compact­\ning States’ intended apportionment.” Ante, at 25.\n16                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  As this case illustrates, adopting this novel remedy is a\nmistake. The majority fails in its attempt to conform this\nnew doctrine of “technical agreement correction” with both\nprinciples of equity and our precedent governing compact\ndisputes. And after creating an unjustified doctrine, the\nmajority misapplies it.\n                              1\n  To begin, the majority’s reliance on equitable power is\nmisplaced. That a court is exercising equitable power\nmeans only that it must look to established principles of\nequity. And reformation is the equitable doctrine that\nNebraska seeks in this case. The Court should thus follow\nthe rules of reformation, just as it would adhere to the\ncontours of any other equitable doctrine. Indeed, we have\ndemanded as much from lower courts when they exercise\ntheir power to grant other forms of equitable relief, such\nas a permanent injunction. See eBay Inc. v. Merc-\nExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 392–394 (2006). If a\ncourt fails to apply the proper standard for a permanent\ninjunction, it is no answer to recite the obvious fact that\nthe court acted in equity. See id., at 394.\n  Putting aside the assertion of equitable power, there is\nno support in our precedents for the majority’s doctrine of\n“technical agreement correction.” The majority first sug­\ngests that this Court reformed a “technical document” in\nTexas v. New Mexico, 446 U. S. 540 (1980) (per curiam)\n(Texas I ). Ante, at 24. But there was no reformation at\nissue in that case—either of the compact or an ancillary\ntechnical agreement—only the interpretation of the words\nin the Pecos River Compact. Texas I, supra, at 540; see\nReport of Special Master on Obligation of New Mexico to\nTexas under the Pecos River Compact, O. T. 1975, No. 65,\nOrig., pp. 15–16, 34–37 (filed Oct. 15, 1979) (purporting to\ninterpret the compact).\n  The majority also claims that in Kansas v. Colorado, 543\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nU. S. 86 (2004), we “approved the Master’s alteration of\nthe parties’ agreement . . . .” Ante, at 24. But nothing in\nKansas v. Colorado supports revising the express terms of\na settlement agreement. In that case, the Court adopted a\nSpecial Master’s recommendation to calculate water usage\nbased on a 10–year average rather than a single year. 543\nU. S., at 99–100. There is no suggestion in the Court’s\nopinion (nor in the briefs filed in that case) that the States\nhad previously agreed to use a 1-year method for calculat­\ning water usage or that anyone thought “reformation” of\nthe compact or any ancillary agreement was needed. To\nthe contrary, the Court explained that the compact simply\ndid “not define the length of time over which” the States\nmust make the relevant measurements. Id., at 100.\nThere was thus nothing to rewrite, nothing to reform. The\nmajority suggests that the States in that case had “ ‘agreed\nto the use of annual measurement’ ” for calculating future\nwater usage, ante, at 24 (quoting Kansas v. Colorado,\nsupra, at 102), but the quoted passage refers to the unre­\nlated fact that the States had, earlier in the litigation,\n“agreed to the use of annual measurement for purposes of\ncalculating past damages,” not future water usage, 543\nU. S., at 102 (emphasis added). That litigation stipulation\ndid not apply to the calculation of future water usage or\nfuture damages. Ibid. Even if the majority were correct\nthat a damages calculation is simply the flip side of a\nwater usage calculation, ante, at 25, n. 10, that conclusion\nplainly would apply only to calculation of past water us­\nage. It is thus no surprise that the Court held that any\npre-existing damages agreements did not govern the\nmethod of measuring future compliance. Kansas v. Colo-\nrado, supra, at 103. Given that the Court plainly did not\napply any such agreements, it cannot be said to have\naltered them.\n18                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n                             2\n   Having improperly invented the doctrine of “technical\nagreement correction,” the majority proceeds to misapply\nit. In “correcting” the accounting procedures, the majority\npurports to align them with the intent of the compacting\nparties. Ante, at 24–25. But we know that the majority’s\nreformed contract does not match the “States’ intended\napportionment.” Ante, at 25. We know this because the\nSettlement expressly states that, for purposes of appor­\ntioning the flow, imported water use would be calculated\nusing the agreed-upon “Accounting Procedures” and the\n“Groundwater Model.” Settlement §IV(F), at 25. The\nStates never intended to adopt the 5-run formula, and the\nCourt has simply picked a winner and adopted Nebraska’s\n5-run proposal, notwithstanding a binding agreement to\nthe contrary.\n   The majority also misapplies its “correction” remedy in\nclaiming that its fix will prevent the existing accounting\nprocedures from “affirmatively violat[ing] the Compact.”\nAnte, at 26. I cannot see how this is true. First, the exist­\ning procedures do not violate the Compact. We should\nfavor an interpretation of the Compact that would render\nits performance possible, rather than “impossible or mean­\ningless.” 2 S. Williston, Law of Contracts §620, p. 1202\n(1920). Read in light of this principle, the phrase “Virgin\nWater Supply” must be interpreted to allow for some\nimperfection in the groundwater models.           After all,\ngroundwater models are approximations of the physical\nworld. Tr. 722–726. No accounting procedure can plausi­\nbly track every drop of water through the 24,900 square\nmile Basin. Id., at 724.\n   Second, even if the existing accounting procedures\nwould violate the Compact because they allocate some\nimported water, the majority’s “correction” will not solve\nthe problem. Because water models are always approxi­\nmations, even the 5-run formula will be imprecise and will\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

And in the name\nof protecting downstream States from their upstream\nneighbors, it diminishes the sovereign status of each of\nthem.\n  We owe the parties better. I would apply the same\nprinciples of contract law that we have previously applied\nto water disputes between States. Under those principles,\nI would sustain Nebraska’s and Colorado’s exceptions to\nthe Master’s recommendation to order $1.8 million in\ndisgorgement, and overrule Kansas’ exception to that\nrecommendation. I would also sustain Kansas’ exception\nto the Master’s recommendation to reform the Settlement.\n  I agree only with the Court’s decisions to overrule Ne­\nbraska’s exception to the Master’s finding that it know-\ningly failed to comply with the Compact, and Kansas’ ex­\nception to the Master’s recommendation not to issue\nan injunction requiring Nebraska to comply with the\nCompact.\n</pre>", "id": 2781442, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/02/24/kansas_v._nebraska.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)               OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                        Syllabus\n\n          NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n        being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n        The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n        prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n        See United States v.

Argued October 14, 2014—Decided February 24, 2015\nIn 1943, Congress approved the Republican River Compact, an agree-\n  ment between Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado to apportion the “vir-\n  gin water originating in” the Republican River Basin. 57 Stat. 87. In\n  1998, Kansas filed an original action in this Court contending that\n  Nebraska’s increased groundwater pumping was subject to regula-\n  tion by the Compact to the extent that it depleted stream flow in the\n  Basin. This Court agreed. Ensuing negotiations resulted in the 2002\n  Final Settlement Stipulation (Settlement), which established mecha-\n  nisms to accurately measure water and promote compliance with the\n  Compact. The Settlement identified the Accounting Procedures, a\n  technical appendix, as the tool by which the States would measure\n  stream flow depletion, and thus consumption, due to groundwater\n  pumping. The Settlement also reaffirmed that “imported water”—\n  that is, water brought into the Basin by human activity—would not\n  count toward a State’s consumption. Again, the Accounting Proce-\n  dures were to measure, so as to exclude, that water flow.\n     In 2007, following the first post-Settlement accounting period,\n  Kansas petitioned this Court for monetary and injunctive relief,\n  claiming that Nebraska had substantially exceeded its water alloca-\n  tion. Nebraska responded that the Accounting Procedures improper-\n  ly charged the State for using imported water and requested that the\n  Accounting Procedures be modified accordingly. The Court appointed\n  a Special Master. His report concludes that Nebraska “knowingly\n  failed” to comply with the Compact, recommends that Nebraska dis-\n  gorge a portion of its gains in addition to paying damages for Kan-\n  sas’s loss, and recommends denying Kansas’s request for an injunc-\n  tion. In addition, the report recommends reforming the Accounting\n  Procedures. The parties have filed exceptions.\nHeld:\n2                         KANSAS v.

Dennison, 24 How. 66, 98. Where the States have\n    negotiated a Compact, the Court is confined to declaring rights under\n    and enforcing its terms. But within those bounds, the Court may in-\n    voke equitable principles to devise “fair … solution[s]” to compact vio-\n    lations. Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 134. And where Con-\n    gress has approved the Compact so that it counts as federal law, see\n    Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 438, the Court may, consistent with\n    the Compact’s express terms, exercise its full authority to remedy\n    violations of, and promote compliance with, the agreement, see Porter\n    v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U. S. 395, 398. Pp. 6–9.\n       2. The Special Master’s determination that Nebraska “knowingly\n    failed” to comply with its Settlement obligations, his recommendation\n    that Nebraska pay Kansas an additional $1.8 million in disgorge-\n    ment, and his recommendation that Kansas’s request for injunctive\n    relief be denied are all adopted. The parties’ exceptions are over-\n    ruled. Pp. 9–20.\n          (a) Nebraska “knowingly failed” to comply with its Settlement\n    obligations, and disgorgement is an appropriate remedy for Nebras-\n    ka’s breach. Pp. 10–17.\n            (i) As the Special Master found, Nebraska failed to put ade-\n    quate compliance mechanisms in place in the face of a known sub-\n    stantial risk that it would violate Kansas’s rights. Nebraska’s argu-\n    ment that it could not have anticipated unprecedented drought\n    conditions fails, because its efforts to comply would have been inade-\n    quate absent the luckiest of circumstances. Nor can the State find\n    refuge in the Compact’s retrospective compliance calculation meth-\n    ods, because it had been warned each year leading up to the final\n    compliance check that it had exceeded its allotment. The Court\n    therefore agrees with the Master that Nebraska “knowingly exposed\n    Kansas to a substantial risk” of receiving less water than it was enti-\n    tled to under the Compact. Report 130. In other words, Nebraska\n    recklessly gambled with Kansas’s rights. Pp. 10–14.\n            (ii) Because Nebraska’s benefit from its breach exceeded the\n    $3.7 million loss Kansas suffered, the Special Master recommended\n    that Nebraska disgorge part of its additional gain. Nebraska con-\n    tends that disgorgement is improper because it did not act “deliber-\n    ately,” which it argues is required for disgorgement in a private con-\n    tract suit. But disgorgement is appropriate where one State has\n    recklessly gambled with another State’s rights to a scarce natural re-\n    source. This Court has said that awarding actual damages in a com-\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                             Syllabus\n\npact case may be inadequate to deter an upstream State from ignor-\ning its obligations where it is advantageous to do so. Texas v. New\nMexico, 482 U. S., at 132. Here, Nebraska took full advantage of its\nfavorable geographic position. And because of the higher value of wa-\nter on Nebraska’s farmland than on Kansas’s, Nebraska could take\nKansas’s water, pay damages, and still benefit. This Court’s remedial\nauthority extends to providing a remedy capable of stabilizing the\nCompact and deterring future breaches, and a disgorgement award\nappropriately does so here. Pp. 14–17.\n      (b) Contrary to Kansas’s contentions, the Master’s partial dis-\ngorgement award is sufficient to achieve those goals. The “flexibility\ninherent in equitable remedies,” Brown v. Plata, 563 U. S. ___, ___,\nallows the Court to order partial disgorgement if appropriate to the\nfacts of the particular case, cf. Kansas v. Colorado, 533 U. S. 1, 14.\nThe Special Master properly took into account Nebraska’s incentives,\npast behavior, and especially its more recent successful compliance\nefforts to determine that a small disgorgement award suffices. For\nrelated reasons, Kansas has failed to demonstrate a “cognizable dan-\nger of recurrent violation” necessary to obtain an injunction. United\nStates v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 633. Pp. 17–20.\n   3. The Special Master’s recommendation to amend the Accounting\nProcedures so that they no longer charge Nebraska for imported wa-\nter is adopted, and Kansas’s exception is overruled. As the Special\nMaster found, in dry conditions, the Accounting Procedures improp-\nerly treat Nebraska’s use of imported water as if it were use of Basin\nwater. Nothing suggests that anyone seriously thought the Account-\ning Procedures would systematically err in this way. Rather, the\nProcedures’ designers assumed that they had succeeded in their goal\nto implement a strict demarcation between virgin and imported wa-\nter.\n   Kansas argues that in spite of these failures, the States must be\nheld to the bargain they struck. That is the ordinary rule. But two\nspecial considerations warrant conforming the Accounting Proce-\ndures to the Compact and the Settlement. First, the remedy is nec-\nessary to prevent serious inaccuracies from distorting the States’ in-\ntended apportionment of interstate waters, as reflected in those\ndocuments. Doing so is consistent with past instances where this\nCourt opted to modify a technical agreement to correct material er-\nrors in the way it operates and thus align it with the compacting\nStates’ intended apportionment. Second, this remedy is required to\navert an outright breach of the Compact—and so a violation of feder-\nal law. As written, the Accounting Procedures go beyond the Com-\npact’s boundaries and deprive Nebraska of its compact rights. The\nMaster’s proposed “5-run formula” solves this problem by excluding\n4                         KANSAS v.

The first round of\nlitigation ended with a settlement agreement designed to\nelaborate on, and promote future compliance with, the\nCompact’s terms. The States now bring new claims\nagainst each other arising from the implementation of\nthat settlement. Kansas seeks exceptional relief—both\npartial disgorgement of gains and an injunction—for\nNebraska’s conceded overconsumption of water. For its\npart, Nebraska requests amendment of a technical appen­\ndix to the settlement, so that allocations of water will\nfaithfully reflect the parties’ intent as expressed in both\nthe body of that agreement and the Compact itself. We\nreferred the case to a Special Master and now accept his\nrecommendations as to appropriate equitable remedies: for\nKansas, partial disgorgement but no injunction; and for\nNebraska, reform of the appendix.\n                            I\n  The Republican River originates in Colorado; crosses the\n2                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnorthwestern corner of Kansas into Nebraska; flows\nthrough much of southwestern Nebraska; and finally cuts\nback into northern Kansas. Along with its many tributar­\nies, the river drains a 24,900-square-mile watershed,\ncalled the Republican River Basin. The Basin contains\nsubstantial farmland, producing (among other things)\nwheat and corn.\n   During the Dust Bowl of the 1930’s, the Republican\nRiver Basin experienced an extended drought, interrupted\nonce by a deadly flood. In response, the Federal Govern­\nment proposed constructing reservoirs in the Basin to\ncontrol flooding, as well as undertaking an array of irriga­\ntion projects to disperse the stored water. But the Gov­\nernment insisted that the three States of the Basin first\nagree to an allocation of its water resources. As a result of\nthat prodding, the States negotiated and ratified the\nRepublican River Compact; and in 1943, as required under\nthe Constitution, Art. I, §10, cl. 3, Congress approved that\nagreement. By act of Congress, the Compact thus became\nfederal law. See Act of May 26, 1943, ch. 104, 57 Stat. 86.\n   The Compact apportions among the three States the\n“virgin water supply originating in”—and, as we will later\ndiscuss, originating only in—the Republican River Basin.\nCompact Art. III; see infra, at 20–28. “Virgin water sup­\nply,” as used in the Compact, means “the water supply\nwithin the Basin,” in both the River and its tributaries,\n“undepleted by the activities of man.” Compact Art. II.\nThe Compact gives each State a set share of that supply—\nroughly, 49% to Nebraska, 40% to Kansas, and 11% to\nColorado—for any “beneficial consumptive use.”           Id.,\nArt. IV; see Art. II (defining that term to mean “that use\nby which the water supply of the Basin is consumed\nthrough the activities of man”). In addition, the Compact\ncharges the chief water official of each State with respon­\nsibility to jointly administer the agreement. See id.,\nArt. IX. Pursuant to that provision, the States created the\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nRepublican River Compact Administration (RRCA). The\nRRCA’s chief task is to calculate the Basin’s annual virgin\nwater supply by measuring stream flow throughout the\narea, and to determine (retrospectively) whether each\nState’s use of that water has stayed within its allocation.\n   All was smooth sailing for decades, until Kansas com­\nplained to this Court about Nebraska’s increased pumping\nof groundwater, resulting from that State’s construction of\n“thousands of wells hydraulically connected to the Repub­\nlican River and its tributaries.” Bill of Complaint, O. T.\n1997, No. 126, Orig., p. 5 (May 26, 1998). Kansas con­\ntended that such activity was subject to the Compact: To\nthe extent groundwater pumping depleted stream flow in\nthe Basin, it counted against the pumping State’s annual\nallotment of water.1 Nebraska maintained, to the con­\ntrary, that groundwater pumping fell outside the Com­\npact’s scope, even if that activity diminished stream flow\nin the area. A Special Master we appointed favored Kan­\nsas’s interpretation of the Compact; we summarily agreed,\nand recommitted the case to him for further proceedings.\nSee Kansas v. Nebraska, 530 U. S. 1272 (2000). The\nStates then entered into negotiations, aimed primarily at\ndetermining how best to measure, and reflect in Compact\naccounting, the depletion of the Basin’s stream flow due to\ngroundwater pumping. During those discussions, the\nStates also addressed a range of other matters affecting\nCompact administration. The talks bore fruit in 2002,\nwhen the States signed the Final Settlement Stipulation\n(Settlement).\n   The Settlement established detailed mechanisms to\npromote compliance with the Compact’s terms. The States\n——————\n  1 As we will later discuss, groundwater pumping does not diminish\n\nstream flow (and thus the Basin’s “virgin water supply”) at a 1-to-1\nratio. See Report of Special Master 19 (Report); infra, at 21–22. In\nother words, a State can pump a bucketful of groundwater without\nreducing stream flow by the same amount.\n4                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagreed that the Settlement was not “intended to, nor could\n[it], change [their] respective rights and obligations under\nthe Compact.” Settlement §I(D). Rather, the agreement\naimed to accurately measure the supply and use of the\nBasin’s water, and to assist the States in staying within\ntheir prescribed limits. To smooth out year-to-year fluctu­\nations and otherwise facilitate compliance, the Settlement\nbased all Compact accounting on 5-year running averages,\nreduced to 2-year averages in “water-short” periods. Id.,\n§§IV(D), V(B). That change gave each State a chance to\ncompensate for one (or more) year’s overuse with another\n(or more) year’s underuse before exceeding its allocation.\nThe Settlement further provided, in line with this Court’s\ndecision, that groundwater pumping would count as part\nof a State’s consumption to the extent it depleted the\nBasin’s stream flow. An appendix to the agreement called\nthe “Accounting Procedures” described how a later-\ndeveloped “Groundwater Model” (essentially, a mass of\ncomputer code) would perform those computations. Id.,\nApp. C; id., App. J1. And finally, the Settlement made\nclear, in accordance with the Compact, that a State’s use\nof “imported water”—that is, water farmers bring into the\narea (usually for irrigation) that eventually seeps into the\nRepublican River—would not count toward the State’s\nallocation, because it did not originate in the Basin. Id.,\n§§II, IV(F). Once again, the Settlement identified the\nAccounting Procedures and Groundwater Model as the\ntools to calculate (so as to exclude) that consumption.\n   But there were more rapids ahead: By 2007, Kansas and\nNebraska each had complaints about how the Settlement\nwas working. Kansas protested that in the 2005–2006\naccounting period—the first for which the Settlement held\nStates responsible—Nebraska had substantially exceeded\nits allocation of water. Nebraska, for its part, maintained\nthat the Accounting Procedures and Groundwater Model\nwere charging the State for use of imported water—\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

The States brought those disputes to the RRCA and\nthen to non-binding arbitration, in accordance with the\nSettlement’s dispute resolution provisions. After failing to\nresolve the disagreements in those forums, Kansas sought\nredress in this Court, petitioning for both monetary and\ninjunctive relief. We referred the case to a Special Master\nto consider Kansas’s claims. See 563 U. S. ___ (2011). In\nthat proceeding, Nebraska asserted a counterclaim re­\nquesting a modification of the Accounting Procedures to\nensure that its use of Platte River water would not count\ntoward its Compact allocation.\n   After two years of conducting hearings, receiving evi­\ndence, and entertaining legal arguments, the Special\nMaster issued his report and recommendations. The\nMaster concluded that Nebraska had “knowingly failed” to\ncomply with the Compact in the 2005–2006 accounting\nperiod, by consuming 70,869 acre-feet of water in excess of\nits prescribed share.2 Report 112. To remedy that breach,\nthe Master proposed awarding Kansas $3.7 million for its\nloss, and another $1.8 million in partial disgorgement of\nNebraska’s still greater gains. The Master, however,\nthought that an injunction against Nebraska was not\nwarranted. In addition, the Master recommended reform­\ning the Accounting Procedures in line with Nebraska’s\nrequest, to ensure that the State would not be charged\nwith using Platte River water.\n   Kansas and Nebraska each filed exceptions in this Court\nto parts of the Special Master’s report.3 Nebraska objects\n——————\n  2 An acre-foot of water is pretty much what it sounds like. If you took\n\nan acre of land and covered it evenly with water one foot deep, you\nwould have an acre-foot of water.\n  3 Colorado has also played a minor part in this dispute, and in this\n\nCourt it filed a brief reiterating one of Nebraska’s exceptions. Because\nKansas and Nebraska are the primary antagonists here, we will refer\nto that claim only as Nebraska’s. From here on in, Colorado drops off\n6                        KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto the Master’s finding of a “knowing” breach and his call\nfor partial disgorgement of its gains. Kansas asserts that\nthe Master should have recommended both a larger dis­\ngorgement award and injunctive relief; the State also\nobjects to his proposed change to the Accounting Proce­\ndures. In reviewing those claims, this Court gives the\nSpecial Master’s factual findings “respect and a tacit\npresumption of correctness.” Colorado v. New Mexico, 467\nU. S. 310, 317 (1984). But we conduct an “independent\nreview of the record,” and assume “the ultimate responsi­\nbility for deciding” all matters. Ibid. Having carried out\nthat careful review, we now overrule all exceptions and\nadopt the Master’s recommendations.\n                                II\n  The Constitution gives this Court original jurisdiction to\nhear suits between the States. See Art. III, §2. Proceed­\nings under that grant of jurisdiction are “basically equi­\ntable in nature.” Ohio v. Kentucky, 410 U. S. 641, 648\n(1973). When the Court exercises its original jurisdiction\nover a controversy between two States, it serves “as a\nsubstitute for the diplomatic settlement of controversies\nbetween sovereigns and a possible resort to force.” North\nDakota v. Minnesota, 263 U. S. 365, 372–373 (1923). That\nrole significantly “differ[s] from” the one the Court under­\ntakes “in suits between private parties.” Id., at 372; see\nFrankfurter & Landis, The Compact Clause of the Consti­\ntution—A Study in Interstate Adjustments, 34 Yale L. J.\n685, 705 (1925) (When a “controversy concerns two States\nwe are at once in a world wholly different from that of a\nlaw-suit between John Doe and Richard Roe over the\nmetes and bounds of Blackacre”). In this singular sphere,\n“the court may regulate and mould the process it uses in\nsuch a manner as in its judgment will best promote the\n——————\nthe map (so to speak).\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npurposes of justice.” Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 98\n(1861).\n   Two particular features of this interstate controversy\nfurther distinguish it from a run-of-the-mill private suit\nand highlight the essentially equitable character of our\ncharge. The first relates to the subject matter of the Com­\npact and Settlement: rights to an interstate waterway.\nThe second concerns the Compact’s status as not just an\nagreement, but a federal law. Before proceeding to the\nmerits of this dispute, we say a few words about each.\n   This Court has recognized for more than a century its\ninherent authority, as part of the Constitution’s grant of\noriginal jurisdiction, to equitably apportion interstate\nstreams between States. In Kansas v. Colorado, 185 U. S.\n125, 145 (1902), we confronted a simple consequence of\ngeography: An upstream State can appropriate all water\nfrom a river, thus “wholly depriv[ing]” a downstream State\n“of the benefit of water” that “by nature” would flow into\nits territory. In such a circumstance, the downstream\nState lacks the sovereign’s usual power to respond—the\ncapacity to “make war[,] . . . grant letters of marque and\nreprisal,” or even enter into agreements without the con­\nsent of Congress. Id., at 143 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). “Bound hand and foot by the prohibitions of the\nConstitution, . . . a resort to the judicial power is the only\nmeans left” for stopping an inequitable taking of water.\nId., at 144 (quoting Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet.\n657, 726 (1838)).\n   This Court’s authority to apportion interstate streams\nencourages States to enter into compacts with each other.\nWhen the division of water is not “left to the pleasure” of\nthe upstream State, but States instead “know[ ] that some\ntribunal can decide on the right,” then “controversies will\n[probably] be settled by compact.” Kansas v. Colorado,\n185 U. S., at 144. And that, of course, is what happened\nhere: Kansas and Nebraska negotiated a compact to divide\n8                      KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe waters of the Republican River and its tributaries.\nOur role thus shifts: It is now to declare rights under the\nCompact and enforce its terms. See Texas v. New Mexico,\n462 U. S. 554, 567 (1983).\n   But in doing so, we remain aware that the States bar­\ngained for those rights in the shadow of our equitable\napportionment power—that is, our capacity to prevent one\nState from taking advantage of another. Each State’s\n“right to invoke the original jurisdiction of this Court [is]\nan important part of the context” in which any compact is\nmade. Id., at 569. And it is “difficult to conceive” that a\ndownstream State “would trade away its right” to our\nequitable apportionment if, under such an agreement, an\nupstream State could avoid its obligations or otherwise\ncontinue overreaching. Ibid. Accordingly, our enforce­\nment authority includes the ability to provide the reme­\ndies necessary to prevent abuse. We may invoke equitable\nprinciples, so long as consistent with the compact itself, to\ndevise “fair . . . solution[s]” to the state-parties’ disputes\nand provide effective relief for their violations. Texas v.\nNew Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 134 (1987) (supplying an “ad­\nditional enforcement mechanism” to ensure an upstream\nState’s compliance with a compact).4\n   And that remedial authority gains still greater force\nbecause the Compact, having received Congress’s blessing,\ncounts as federal law. See Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433,\n438 (1981) (“[C]ongressional consent transforms an inter­\nstate compact . . . into a law of the United States”). Of\ncourse, that legal status underscores a limit on our en­\nforcement power: We may not “order relief inconsistent\nwith [a compact’s] express terms.” Texas v. New Mexico,\n——————\n  4 JUSTICE THOMAS misdescribes this aspect of our decision. See post,\n\nat 3, 15 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter\nthe dissent). Far from claiming the power to alter a compact to fit our\nown views of fairness, we insist only upon broad remedial authority to\nenforce the Compact’s terms and deter future violations.\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n462 U. S., at 564. But within those limits, the Court may\nexercise its full authority to remedy violations of and\npromote compliance with the agreement, so as to give\ncomplete effect to public law. As we have previously put\nthe point: When federal law is at issue and “the public\ninterest is involved,” a federal court’s “equitable powers\nassume an even broader and more flexible character than\nwhen only a private controversy is at stake.” Porter v.\nWarner Holding Co., 328 U. S. 395, 398 (1946); see Virgin-\nian R. Co. v. Railway Employees, 300 U. S. 515, 552 (1937)\n(“Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much far­\nther” to give “relief in furtherance of the public interest\nthan they are accustomed to go when only private inter­\nests are involved”).5 In exercising our jurisdiction, we may\n“mould each decree to the necessities of the particular\ncase” and “accord full justice” to all parties. Porter, 328\nU. S., at 398 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Ken-\ntucky v. Dennison, 65 U. S., at 98. These principles inform\nour consideration of the dispute before us.\n                            III\n  We first address Nebraska’s breach of the Compact and\nSettlement and the remedies appropriate to that violation.\nBoth parties assent to the Special Master’s finding that in\n\n——————\n  5 The dissent objects that these precedents do not apply to “water\n\ndisputes between States” because such clashes involve “sovereign\nrights.” See post, at 4–5. But in making that claim, the dissent ignores\nthe effect of the Constitution: By insisting that Congress approve a\ncompact like this one, the Constitution turns the agreement into a\nfederal law like any other. See Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 439–\n440 (1981) (“By vesting in Congress the power to grant or withhold\nconsent, . . . the Framers sought to ensure that Congress would main­\ntain ultimate supervisory power over cooperative state action that\nmight otherwise interfere with the full and free exercise of federal\nauthority”). That constitutional choice means that the judicial authority\nwe have recognized to give effect to, and remedy violations of, federal\nlaw fully attends a compact.\n10                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n2005–2006 Nebraska exceeded its allocation of water by\n70,869 acre-feet—about 17% more than its proper share.\nSee Report 88–89; App. B to Reply Brief for Kansas. They\nsimilarly agree that this overconsumption resulted in a\n$3.7 million loss to Kansas; and Nebraska has agreed to\npay those damages. See Reply Brief for Kansas 9, 55;\nBrief for Nebraska 7. But the parties dispute whether\nNebraska’s conduct warrants additional relief. The Mas­\nter determined that Nebraska “knowingly exposed Kansas\nto a substantial risk” of breach, and so “knowingly failed”\nto comply with the Compact. Report 130, 112; see supra,\nat 5. Based in part on that finding, he recommended\ndisgorgement of $1.8 million, which he described as “a\nsmall portion of the amount by which Nebraska’s gain\nexceeds Kansas’s loss.” Report 179. But he declined to\ngrant Kansas’s request for injunctive relief against Ne­\nbraska. See id., at 180–186. As noted previously, see\nsupra, at 5–6, each party finds something to dislike in the\nMaster’s handling of this issue: Nebraska contests his\nfinding of a “knowing” Compact violation and his view that\ndisgorgement is appropriate; Kansas wants a larger dis­\ngorgement award and an injunction regulating Nebraska’s\nfuture conduct. We address those exceptions in turn.\n                             A\n                             1\n  When they entered into the Settlement in 2002, the\nStates understood that Nebraska would have to signifi­\ncantly reduce its consumption of Republican River water.\nSee Report 106. The Settlement, after all, charged Ne­\nbraska for its depletion of the Basin’s stream flow due to\ngroundwater pumping—an amount the State had not\npreviously counted toward its allotment. See supra, at 3.\nNebraska did not have to achieve all that reduction in the\nnext year: The Settlement’s adoption of multi-year averages\nto measure consumption allowed the State some time—\n                    Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhow much depended on whether and when “water-short”\nconditions existed—to come into compliance. See Settle­\nment §§IV(D), V(B)(2)(e)(i), App. B; supra, at 4. As it\nturned out, the area experienced a drought in 2006; ac­\ncordingly, Nebraska first needed to demonstrate compli­\nance in that year, based on the State’s average consump­\ntion of water in 2005 and 2006.6 And at that initial\ncompliance check, despite having enjoyed several years to\nprepare, Nebraska came up markedly short.\n   Nebraska contends, contrary to the Master’s finding,\nthat it could not have anticipated breaching the Compact\nin those years. By its account, the State took “persistent\nand earnest”—indeed, “extraordinary”—steps to comply\nwith the agreement, including amending its water law to\nreduce groundwater pumping. Brief for Nebraska 9, 17.\nAnd Nebraska could not have foreseen (or so it claims)\nthat those measures would prove inadequate. First, Ne­\nbraska avers, drought conditions between 2002 and 2006\nreduced the State’s yearly allotments to historically low\nlevels; the Master was thus “unfair to suggest Nebraska\nshould have anticipated what never before was known.”\nId., at 17. And second, Nebraska stresses, the RRCA\ndetermines each State’s use of water only retrospectively,\ncalculating each spring what a State consumed the year\nbefore; hence, Nebraska “could not have known” that it\nwas out of compliance in 2006 “until early 2007—when it\nwas already too late.” Id., at 18; see supra, at 3.\n   But that argument does not hold water: Rather, as the\nSpecial Master found, Nebraska failed to put in place\nadequate mechanisms for staying within its allotment in\nthe face of a known substantial risk that it would other­\nwise violate Kansas’s rights. See Report 105–112, 130. As\nan initial matter, the State’s efforts to reduce its use of\n——————\n  6 Had rainfall been more plentiful, Nebraska would have had to show\n\ncompliance in 2007, based on its average use from 2003 onward.\n12                     KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nRepublican River water came at a snail-like pace. The\nNebraska Legislature waited a year and a half after sign­\ning the Settlement to amend the State’s water law. See\n§55, 2004 Neb. Laws p. 352, codified at Neb. Rev. Stat. 46–\n715. And the fix the legislature adopted—the develop­\nment of regional water management plans meant to de­\ncrease groundwater pumping—did not go into effect for\nstill another year. Nebraska thus wasted the time follow­\ning the Settlement—a crucial period to begin bringing\ndown the State’s consumption. Indeed, the State’s overuse\nof Republican River water actually rose significantly from\n2003 through 2005, making compliance at the eventual\nday of reckoning ever more difficult to achieve. See Report\n108–109.7 And to make matters worse, Nebraska knew\nthat decreasing pumping does not instantly boost stream\nflow: A time lag, of as much as a year, exists between the\none and the other. See id., at 106. So Nebraska’s several-\nyear delay in taking any corrective action foreseeably\nraised the risk that the State would breach the Compact.\n   Still more important, what was too late was also too\nlittle. The water management plans finally adopted in\n2005 called for only a 5% reduction in groundwater pump­\ning, although no evidence suggested that would suffice.\nThe testimony presented to the Special Master gave not a\nhint that the state and local officials charged with formu­\nlating those plans had conducted a serious appraisal of\nhow much change would be necessary. See id., at 107–\n108. And the State had created no way to enforce even the\npaltry goal the plans set. The Nebraska Legislature chose\nto leave operational control of water use in the hands of\ndistrict boards consisting primarily of irrigators, who are\n\n——————\n  7 Had 2006 not been a “water-short” year, all those overages would\nhave gone into Nebraska’s 5-year average; as it was, the dry conditions\ntriggered the alternative 2-year period, so the 2003 and 2004 overages\ndropped out of the RRCA’s calculations.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\namong the immediate beneficiaries of pumping. No sanc­\ntions or other mechanisms held those local bodies to ac­\ncount if they failed to meet the plans’ benchmark. They\nbore no legal responsibility for complying with the Com­\npact, and assumed no share of the penalties the State\nwould pay for violations. See id., at 110–111. Given such\na dearth of tools or incentives to achieve compliance, the\nwonder is only that Nebraska did not still further exceed\nits allotment.\n   Nor do Nebraska’s excuses change our view of its mis­\nbehavior. True enough, the years following the Settlement\nwere exceptionally arid. But the Compact and Settlement\n(unsurprisingly) contemplate wet and dry years alike. By\ncontrast, Nebraska’s plans could have brought it into\ncompliance only if the Basin had received a stretch of\ncopious rainfall. See id., at 109–110. And Nebraska\ncannot take refuge in the timing of the RRCA’s calcula­\ntions. By the time the compliance check of 2006 loomed,\nNebraska knew that it had exceeded its allotment (by an\never greater margin) in each of the three previous years.\nAs Nebraska’s own witnesses informed the Special Master,\nthey “could clearly see” by the beginning of 2006 “that [the\nState] had not done enough” to come into compliance. Id.,\nat 109 (quoting Tr. 1333 (Aug. 21, 2012)). Indeed, in that\nyear, Nebraska began purchasing its farmers’ rights to\nsurface water in order to mitigate its anticipated breach.\nBut that last-minute effort, in the Master’s words, “fell\nwoefully short”—as at that point could only have been\nexpected. Report 109. From the outset of the Settlement\nthrough 2006, Nebraska headed—absent the luckiest of\ncircumstances—straight toward a Compact violation.\n   For these reasons, we agree with the Master’s conclu­\nsion that Nebraska “knowingly exposed Kansas to a sub­\nstantial risk” of receiving less water than the Compact\nprovided, and so “knowingly failed” to comply with the\nobligations that agreement imposed. Id., at 130, 112. In\n14                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe early years of the Settlement, as the Master explained,\nNebraska’s compliance efforts were not only inadequate,\nbut also “reluctant,” showing a disinclination “to take [the]\nfirm action” necessary “to meet the challenges of foresee-\nably varying conditions in the Basin.” Id., at 105. Or said\nanother way, Nebraska recklessly gambled with Kansas’s\nrights, consciously disregarding a substantial probability\nthat its actions would deprive Kansas of the water to\nwhich it was entitled. See Tr. 1870 (Aug. 23, 2012) (Mas­\nter’s statement that Nebraska showed “reckless indiffer­\nence as to compliance back in ’05 and ’06”).\n                              2\n  After determining that Kansas lost $3.7 million from\nNebraska’s breach, the Special Master considered the case\nfor an additional monetary award. Based on detailed\nevidence, not contested here, he concluded that an acre-\nfoot of water is substantially more valuable on farmland in\nNebraska than in Kansas. That meant Nebraska’s reward\nfor breaching the Compact was “much larger than Kansas’\nloss, likely by more than several multiples.” Report 178.\nGiven the circumstances, the Master thought that Ne­\nbraska should have to disgorge part of that additional\ngain, to the tune of $1.8 million. In making that recom­\nmendation, he relied on his finding—which we have just\naffirmed—of Nebraska’s culpability. See id., at 130. He\nalso highlighted this Court’s broad remedial powers in\ncompact litigation, noting that such cases involve not\nprivate parties’ private quarrels, but States’ clashes over\nfederal law. See id., at 131, 135; supra, at 6–9.\n  Nebraska (along with the dissent) opposes the Special\nMaster’s disgorgement proposal on the ground that the\nState did not “deliberately act[ ]” to violate the Compact.\nReply Brief for Nebraska 33; see post, at 6–7. Relying on\nprivate contract law, Nebraska cites a Restatement provi­\nsion declaring that a court may award disgorgement in\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

Accordingly, Nebraska concludes,\nno disgorgement is warranted.\n   But that argument fails to come to terms with what the\nMaster properly understood as the wrongful nature of\nNebraska’s conduct. True enough, as the Master said,\nthat Nebraska did not purposefully set out to breach the\nCompact. But still, as he also found, the State “knowingly\nexposed Kansas to a substantial risk” of breach, and\nblithely proceeded. Report 130. In some areas of the law\nand for certain purposes, the distinction between purpose­\nfully invading and recklessly disregarding another’s rights\nmakes no difference. See Bullock v. BankChampaign,\nN. A., 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (“We include\nas intentional . . . reckless conduct” of the kind that the\nlaw “often treats as the equivalent”); Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 193–194, n. 12 (1976)\n(“[R]ecklessness is [sometimes] considered to be a form of\nintentional conduct for purposes of imposing liability”).\nAnd indeed, the very Restatement Nebraska relies on\ntreats the two similarly. It assimilates “deliberate[ness]”\nto “conscious wrongdoing,” which it defines as acting (as\nNebraska did) “despite a known risk that the conduct . . .\nviolates [another’s] rights.” Restatement §39, Comment f;\nid., §51(3). Conversely, the Restatement distinguishes\n“deliberate[ness]” from behavior (not akin to Nebraska’s)\namounting to mere “inadvertence, negligence, or unsuc­\ncessful attempt at performance.” Id., §39, Comment f.\n   And whatever is true of a private contract action, the\n16                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncase for disgorgement becomes still stronger when one\nState gambles with another State’s rights to a scarce\nnatural resource. From the time this Court began to\napportion interstate rivers, it has recognized part of its\nrole as guarding against upstream States’ inequitable\ntakings of water. And as we have noted, that concern\npersists even after States enter into a compact: This Court\nmay then exercise remedial authority to ensure compli­\nance with the compact’s terms—thus preventing a geo­\ngraphically favored State from appropriating more than\nits share of a river. See supra, at 8. Indeed, the formation\nof such a compact provides this Court with enhanced\nremedial power because, as we have described, the agree­\nment is also an Act of Congress, and its breach a violation\nof federal law. See supra, at 8–9; Porter, 328 U. S. 395\n(exercising equitable power to disgorge profits gained from\nviolating a federal statute). Consistent with those princi­\nples, we have stated that awarding actual damages for a\ncompact’s infringement may be inadequate, because that\nremedy alone “would permit [an upstream State] to ignore\nits obligation to deliver water as long as it is willing” to\npay that amount. Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S., at 132.\nAnd as the Solicitor General noted in argument here, “[i]t\nis important that water flows down the river, not just\nmoney.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 24. Accordingly, this Court may\norder disgorgement of gains, if needed to stabilize a com­\npact and deter future breaches, when a State has demon­\nstrated reckless disregard of another, more vulnerable\nState’s rights under that instrument.\n   Assessed in this light, a disgorgement order constitutes\na “fair and equitable” remedy for Nebraska’s breach.\nTexas v. New Mexico, 482 U.S., at 134. “Possessing the\nprivilege of being upstream,” Nebraska can (physically,\nthough not legally) drain all the water it wants from the\nRepublican River. Report 130. And the higher value of\nwater on Nebraska’s farmland than on Kansas’s means\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

That is nearly a recipe for breach—for an\nupstream State to refuse to deliver to its downstream\nneighbor the water to which the latter is entitled. And\nthrough 2006, Nebraska took full advantage of its favor­\nable position, eschewing steps that would effectively control\ngroundwater pumping and thus exceeding its allotment.\nIn such circumstances, a disgorgement award appropri­\nately reminds Nebraska of its legal obligations, deters future\nviolations, and promotes the Compact’s successful admin­\nistration. See Porter, 328 U. S., at 400 (“Future compli­\nance may be more definitely assured if one is compelled to\nrestore one’s illegal gains”).8 We thus reject Nebraska’s\nexception to the Master’s proposed remedy.\n                            B\n  Kansas assails the Special Master’s recommended dis­\ngorgement award from the other direction, claiming that it\nis too low to ensure Nebraska’s future compliance. See\nBrief for Kansas 55–59. Notably, Kansas does not insist\non all of Nebraska’s gain. It recognizes the difficulty of\nascertaining that figure, given the evidence the parties\npresented. See id., at 56; see also Report 177–178. And\nstill more important, it “agrees” with the Master’s view\nthat the Court should select a “fair point on th[e] spec­\ntrum” between no profits and full profits, based on the\n——————\n  8 An award of specific performance may accomplish much the same\n\nobjectives, as the dissent notes. See post, at 10–11. But for various\nreasons, a remedy in the form of water is not always feasible. See\nTexas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 132 (1987). Here, both States\nconcurred that using water as the remedial currency would lead to\ndifficult questions about the proper timing and location of delivery. See\nReport 129–130. (That agreement is especially notable given the\noverall contentiousness of this litigation.) In such circumstances,\nthe Master appropriately found another way of preventing knowing\nmisbehavior.\n18                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntotality of facts and interests in the case. Brief for Kansas\n57 (quoting Report 135); see Sur-Reply Brief for Kansas 5.\nIn setting that point, however, Kansas comes up with a\nhigher number—or actually, a trio of them. The State\nfirst asks us to award “treble damages of $11.1 million,”\nthen suggests that we can go “up to roughly $25 million,”\nand finally proposes a “1:1 loss-to-disgorgement ratio,”\nwhich means $3.7 million of Nebraska’s gains. Brief for\nKansas 57; Sur-Reply Brief for Kansas 5, 7.\n   We prefer to stick with the Master’s single number. As\nan initial matter, we agree with both the Master and\nKansas that disgorgement need not be all or nothing. See,\ne.g., 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies §2.4(1), p. 92 (2d ed.\n1993) (“Balancing of equities and hardships may lead the\ncourt to grant some equitable relief but not” the full meas­\nure requested); Restatement §39, Comment i; id., §50,\nComment a; National Security Systems, Inc. v. Iola, 700\nF. 3d 65, 80–81, 101–102 (CA3 2012). In exercising our\noriginal jurisdiction, this Court recognizes that “flexibility\n[is] inherent in equitable remedies,” Brown v. Plata, 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 41) (quoting Hutto v.\nFinney, 437 U. S. 678, 687, n. 9 (1978)), and awards them\n“with reference to the facts of the particular case,” Texas v.\nNew Mexico, 482 U. S., at 131 (quoting Haffner v. Dobrin-\nski, 215 U. S. 446, 450 (1910)). So if partial disgorgement\nwill serve to stabilize a compact by conveying an effective\nmessage to the breaching party that it must work hard to\nmeet its future obligations, then the Court has discretion\nto order only that much. Cf. Kansas v. Colorado, 533 U. S.\n1, 14 (2001) (concluding that a master “acted properly in\ncarefully analyzing the facts of the case and in only award­\ning as much prejudgment interest as was required by a\nbalancing of the equities”).\n   And we agree with the Master’s judgment that a rela­\ntively small disgorgement award suffices here. That is\nbecause, as the Master detailed, Nebraska altered its\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconduct after the 2006 breach, and has complied with the\nCompact ever since. See Report 112–118, 180. In 2007,\nNebraska enacted new legislation establishing a mecha­\nnism to accurately forecast the State’s annual allotment of\nRepublican River water. §23, 2007 Neb. Laws p. 1600,\ncodified at Neb. Rev. Stat. 46–715(6). Further, a new\nround of water management plans called for localities to\nreduce groundwater pumping by five times as much as the\nold (5%) target. And most important, those plans imple­\nmented a system for the State, in dry years, to force dis­\ntricts to curtail both surface water use and groundwater\npumping. That “regulatory back-stop,” as Nebraska calls\nit, corrects the State’s original error of leaving all control\nof water use to unaccountable local actors. Report 113\n(quoting Direct Testimony of Brian Dunnigan, Director,\nNebraska Department of Resources ¶43 (July 25, 2012));\nsee supra, at 12–13. Testimony before the Master showed\nthat if the scheme had been in effect between 2002 and\n2006, Nebraska would have lived within its allocation\nthroughout that period. See Report 117. The Master thus\nreasonably concluded that the current water management\nplans, if implemented in good faith, “will be effective to\nmaintain compliance even in extraordinarily dry years.”\nSee id., at 118. And so the Master had good cause to\nrecommend the modest award he did, which serves as an\never-present reminder to Nebraska, but does not assume\nits continuing misconduct.\n   Truth be told, we cannot be sure why the Master selected\nthe exact number he did—why, that is, he arrived at\n$1.8 million, rather than a little more or a little less. The\nMaster’s Report, in this single respect, contains less ex­\nplanation than we might like. But then again, any hard\nnumber reflecting a balance of equities can seem random\nin a certain light—as Kansas’s own briefs, with their ever-\nfluctuating ideas for a disgorgement award, amply attest.\nWhat matters is that the Master took into account the\n20                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nappropriate considerations—weighing Nebraska’s incen­\ntives, past behavior, and more recent compliance efforts—\nin determining the kind of signal necessary to prevent\nanother breach. We are thus confident that in approving\nthe Master’s recommendation for about half again Kan­\nsas’s actual damages, we award a fair and equitable remedy\nsuited to the circumstances.\n   For related reasons, we also reject Kansas’s request for\nan injunction ordering Nebraska to comply with the Com­\npact and Settlement. Kansas wants such an order so that\nit can seek contempt sanctions against Nebraska for any\nfuture breach. See Brief for Kansas 36–44. But we agree\nwith the Master that Kansas has failed to show, as it must\nto obtain an injunction, a “cognizable danger of recurrent\nviolation.” United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629,\n633 (1953). As just discussed, Nebraska’s new compliance\nmeasures, so long as followed, are up to the task of keep­\ning the State within its allotment. And Nebraska is now\non notice that if it relapses, it may again be subject to\ndisgorgement of gains—either in part or in full, as the\nequities warrant. That, we trust, will adequately guard\nagainst Nebraska’s repeating its former practices.\n                           IV\n  The final question before us concerns the Special Mas­\nter’s handling of Nebraska’s counterclaim. As we have\nnoted, Nebraska contended that the Settlement’s Account­\ning Procedures inadvertently charge the State for using\n“imported water”—specifically, water from the Platte\nRiver—in conflict with the parties’ intent in both the\nCompact and the Settlement. See supra, at 4–5. The\nMaster agreed, and recommended modifying the Proce­\ndures by adopting an approach that the parties call the “5­\nrun formula,” to ensure that Nebraska’s consumption of\nPlatte River water will not count toward its Compact\nallotment. Kansas now objects to that proposed remedy.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Compact, recall, apportions the virgin water supply\nof the Republican River and its tributaries—nothing less,\nbut also nothing more. See Compact Art. III; supra, at 2.\nOne complexity of that project arises from water’s . . . well,\nfluid quality. Nebraska imports water from the Platte\nRiver, outside the Republican River Basin and thus out­\nside the Compact’s scope, to irrigate farmland. And that\nimported water simply will not stay still: Some of it seeps\nthrough the ground and raises stream flow in the Republi­\ncan River and its tributaries. See Second Report of Spe­\ncial Master, O. T. 1999, No. 126, Orig., pp. 62–63 (Second\nReport). In negotiating the Settlement, the States under­\ntook—as part of their effort to accurately apportion the\nBasin’s water—to exclude all such imported water from\ntheir calculations. Reflecting the Compact’s own scope,\n§IV(F) of the Settlement states, in no uncertain terms,\nthat “Beneficial Consumptive Use of Imported Water\nSupply shall not count as Computed Beneficial Consump­\ntive Use” of Republican River Basin water. Which means,\nwithout all that distracting capitalization, that when\nNebraska consumes imported water that has found its\nway into the Basin’s streams, that use shall not count\ntoward its Compact allotment. But that edict of course\nrequires calculating (in order to exclude) the State’s con­\nsumption of imported water. The Settlement’s Accounting\nProcedures, in tandem with its Groundwater Model, are\nthe tools the parties employ to make that computation.\n   But as the Master found, the Procedures (and Model)\nfounder in performing that task in dry conditions: They\ntreat Nebraska’s use of imported water as if it were use of\nBasin water. That failure flows from the way the Proce­\ndures measure a State’s consumption of water resulting\nfrom groundwater pumping. According to the Settlement,\nsuch pumping is to count against a State’s allotment only\nto the extent it reduces stream flow in specified areas—\nwhich it rarely does in a 1-to-1 ratio and sometimes does\n22                      KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnot do at all. See id., §IV(C)(1); Report 19; n. 1, supra.\nMost notable here, pumping cannot deplete an already\nwholly dry stream—and in arid conditions, some of the\nBasin’s tributaries in fact run dry. As the Master put the\npoint, stream flow in a given area “fall[s] as groundwater\npumping increases until it hits zero, at which point it falls\nno more even as groundwater pumping continues.” Report\n34. When that point arrives, Nebraska’s continued pump­\ning should not count as consumption of the Basin’s virgin\nwater. But—and here lies the rub—imported water (from\nthe Platte) can create stream flow in what would other­\nwise be a dry riverbed. And the Accounting Procedures\n(and Model) fail to account for that possibility; accordingly,\nthey see depletion of the Basin’s stream flow—the sole\nmeasure of the State’s consumption—where they should\nnot. The result is to count imported water toward the\nState’s consumption of Basin water. In 2006, for example,\nthe Procedures charged Nebraska with using 7,797 acre-\nfeet of Platte River water, over 4% of the State’s allotment.\nBy our estimate, just that single year’s miscalculation cost\nNebraska over $1 million. See id., at 37, 176.\n   The Master specifically determined, and our review of\nthe relevant testimony confirms, that the parties did not\nknow the Accounting Procedures would have that effect.\nSee id., at 23–32. The States intended the Procedures (as\nper the Compact and Settlement) to count only consump­\ntion of the Basin’s own water supply—and correlatively, to\nexclude use of water from the Platte. See id., at 23–25;\nsee also Second Report 37, 64 (same conclusion reached by\nthe Special Master approving the Settlement). There is no\nevidence that anyone seriously thought, much less dis­\ncussed, that the Accounting Procedures might systemati­\ncally err in accomplishing those computations. See Report\n26–27.9 And because no one knew of the fault in the Pro­\n——————\n 9 Kansas   argues otherwise, see Brief for Kansas 28–29, but the part of\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                   23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncedures, no one could possibly trade it off for other items\nduring the parties’ negotiations. Thus, as the Master\nfound, Nebraska did not receive anything, nor did Kansas\ngive up anything, in exchange for the (unknown) error.\nSee id., at 28–31. To the contrary, as all witnesses ex­\nplained, the designers of the Procedures worked single­\nmindedly to implement the Compact’s and Settlement’s\nstrict demarcation between virgin and imported water—\nand assumed they had succeeded. See id., at 31–32.\n  But even if all that is so, Kansas argues (along with the\ndissent) that a deal is a deal is a deal—and this deal did\nnot include the 5-run formula the Master now proposes.\nSee Brief for Kansas 31–34; post, at 15–19. On that view,\nthe parties’ clear intent to exclude imported water does\nnot matter; nor does their failure to appreciate that the\nProcedures, in opposition to that goal, would count such\nwater in material amounts. According to Kansas, so long\nas the parties bargained (as they did) for the Procedures\nthey got, that is the end of the matter: No one should now\nbe heard to say that there is a better mode of accounting.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 54–55.\n  That argument, however, does not pass muster. Of\ncourse, courts generally hold parties to the deals they\nmake; and of course, courts should hesitate, and then\nhesitate some more, before modifying a contract, even to\nremove an inadvertent flaw. But in this Compact case,\ntwo special (and linked) considerations warrant reforming\nthe Accounting Procedures as the Master has proposed—\nor better phrased, warrant conforming those Procedures to\nthe parties’ underlying agreements. First, that remedy is\n——————\nthe record it cites further proves our point. There, Colorado’s expert\ntestified that during development of the Groundwater Model—months\nafter adoption of the Accounting Procedures—he “intellectually under­\nstood” that the imported-water problem could occur, but “didn’t think\nthat it would” and didn’t recall the issue ever coming up in discussions.\nReport 26 (quoting Tr. 676 (Aug. 13, 2012)); id., at 727–728.\n24                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessary to prevent serious inaccuracies from distorting\nthe States’ intended apportionment of interstate waters,\nas reflected in both the Compact and the Settlement. And\nsecond, it is required to avert an outright breach of the\nCompact—and so a violation of federal law. We address\neach point in turn.\n   In resolving water disputes, this Court has opted to\ncorrect subsidiary technical agreements to promote accu­\nracy in apportioning waters under a compact. In Texas v.\nNew Mexico, for example, the parties entered into a com­\npact that based division of the Pecos River on certain\nconditions existing in 1947. The States further agreed\nthat those conditions were described and defined in a\nparticular engineering report. But that report turned out\nto contain material errors.       Notwithstanding Texas’s\nobjection that the parties had assented to its use, we set\naside the flawed study and adopted a new technical docu­\nment that more accurately depicted the real-world condi­\ntions of the compact’s specified baseline year. See 446\nU. S. 540 (1980) (per curiam) (setting aside the old docu­\nment); 462 U. S., at 562–563 (describing the litigation);\n467 U. S. 1238 (1984) (approving the new document); 482\nU. S., at 127 (describing that approval).\n   Similarly, in Kansas v. Colorado, 543 U. S. 86 (2004), we\nmodified an agreement to ensure that it would correctly\nmeasure Colorado’s compliance with the Arkansas River\nCompact. The parties had consented to use a computer\nmodel on a year-by-year basis to gauge their consumption\nof water. See id., at 102 (“[B]oth [States] agreed to the\nuse of annual measurement”). But after a time, a special\nmaster determined that annual accounting produced\nserious errors, whereas employing a 10-year measuring\nperiod accurately determined compact compliance. Over\nKansas’s protest, we accordingly approved the Master’s\nalteration of the parties’ agreement to assess compliance\neach year. And in countering Kansas’s objection to the\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    25\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nintroduction of a 10-year measuring period, we posited\nthat the compact’s drafters, albeit unaware of “complex\ncomputer modeling[,] . . . would have preferred accurate\nmeasurement.” Ibid.10\n  The teaching of those cases applies as well to this one:\nIn each, this Court’s authority to devise “fair and equitable\nsolutions” to interstate water disputes encompasses modi­\nfying a technical agreement to correct material errors in\nthe way it operates and thus align it with the compacting\nStates’ intended apportionment. Texas v. New Mexico, 482\nU. S., at 134; cf. Kansas v. Colorado, 543 U. S., at 102\n(“After all, a ‘credit’ for surplus water that rests upon\ninaccurate measurement is not really a credit at all”).\nMuch as in Texas v. New Mexico and Kansas v. Colorado,\nthe subsidiary Accounting Procedures here failed to accu­\nrately measure what they were supposed to. Modifying\nthose Procedures does no more than make them consonant\nwith the Compact and Settlement, ensuring that they help\n——————\n  10 The dissent misunderstands the meaning and relevance of these\ndecisions. It is of course true, as the dissent says, that in neither case\ndid the Court reform a compact. See post, at 16–17. What the Court\ndid do, contrary to the dissent’s protestations, was what we do here:\nmodify an ancillary agreement to make sure it accurately implemented\na compact’s apportionment. In Texas v. New Mexico, we interpreted a\ncompact term, as the dissent says, see post, at 16; but we additionally\nthrew out a technical report that the parties agreed would effectuate\nthat term when it later proved erroneous. And similarly in Kansas v.\nColorado, we altered an ancillary agreement to measure water usage\nyear by year. The dissent contends that the States in that case had no\nsuch agreement, though acknowledging that they had one to calculate\ndamages on an annual basis. See post, at 17. But the two were one and\nthe same. Damages arise from violations, and violations occur when a\nState consumes too much water. In calling for year-by-year measure­\nment of damages, the agreement also called for year-by-year assess­\nment of consumption. And nothing supports the dissent’s claim that\nthis agreement applied only retrospectively, rather than to assess both\nusage and damages on an ongoing basis. So to impose a 10-year meas­\nuring period, consistent with accurate apportionment under the Com­\npact, we had to alter the agreement.\n26                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto realize, rather than frustrate, the agreed-upon division\nof water.\n   Indeed, the case for modification is still stronger here,\nbecause (as we explain below) the Accounting Procedures\nas written affirmatively violate the Compact. That accord\nis the supreme law in this case: As the States explicitly\nrecognized, they could not change the Compact’s terms\neven if they tried. See Settlement §I(D) (“[T]his Stipula­\ntion and the Proposed Consent Judgment are not intended\nto, nor could they, change the States’ respective rights and\nobligations under the Compact”). That is a function of the\nCompact’s status as federal law, which binds the States\nunless and until Congress says otherwise. And Congress,\nof course, has not said otherwise here. To enter into a\nsettlement contrary to the Compact is to violate a federal\nstatute. See Vermont v. New York, 417 U. S. 270, 278\n(1974) (per curiam). And as we have discussed, our equi­\ntable authority to grant remedies is at its apex when\npublic rights and obligations are thus implicated. See\nPorter, 328 U. S., at 398; supra, at 8–9.\n   The Accounting Procedures’ treatment of imported\nwater first conflicts with the Compact by going beyond its\nboundaries—in essence, by regulating water ultra vires.\nAccording to its terms, the Compact pertains, and pertains\nonly, to “virgin water supply originating in” the Republi­\ncan River Basin. Compact Art. III; see supra, at 2, 21.\nThe agreement’s very first Article drives that point home:\n“The physical and other conditions peculiar to the Basin\nconstitute the basis for this compact,” and nothing in it\nrelates to any other waterway. To divide or otherwise\nregulate streams outside the Basin, the States would have\nto enter into a separate agreement and gain congressional\napproval. (The reason no one thought the Settlement\nneeded such consent is precisely because it purported to\nstay within the Compact’s limits. See Settlement §I(D))\nAnd yet, the Accounting Procedures have the effect of\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nincluding such outside water within the Compact’s appor­\ntionment scheme (by counting its use against a State’s\nallotment). The Procedures make water from the Platte\nsubject to the Compact, in contravention of its scope; or\nconversely stated, they expand the Compact’s prescribed\nscope to cover water from the Platte. That is not within\nthe States’ authority.\n   What is more, the Procedures’ treatment of imported\nwater deprives Nebraska of its rights under the Compact\nto the Basin’s own water supply. That is because the\ninescapable effect of charging Nebraska for the use of\nimported water, as the Procedures do, is to reduce the\namount of Republican River water the State may con­\nsume. Suppose the Compact grants 100 units of Republi­\ncan River water to Nebraska and Kansas alike; and fur­\nther assume that the Accounting Procedures count 10\nunits of Platte River water toward Nebraska’s allotment.\nThat means Nebraska may now consume only 90 units of\nRepublican River water (or else pay Kansas damages).\nThe Procedures thus change the States’ shares of Basin\nwater, to Nebraska’s detriment: Nebraska now has less,\nand Kansas relatively more, than the Compact allows.\nThat, too, lies outside what the States can do.\n   In light of all the above, we think the Master’s proposed\nsolution the best one possible. The 5-run formula that he\nrecommends conforms the Procedures to both the Compact\nand the Settlement by excluding imported water from the\ncalculation of each State’s consumption. See Report 55–\n56; id., at App. F. Kansas has not provided any workable\nalternative to align the Accounting Procedures with the\nCompact and Settlement. Nor has Kansas credibly shown\nthat this simple change will introduce any other inaccu­\nracy into Compact accounting. See id., at 58–68. The\namendment will damage Kansas in no way other than by\ntaking away something to which it is not entitled. In\nanother case, with another history, we might prefer to\n28                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninstruct the parties to figure out for themselves how to\nbring the Accounting Procedures into line with the Com­\npact. See New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296, 313\n(1921) (noting that negotiation is usually the best way to\nsolve interstate disputes). But we doubt that further\ndiscussion about this issue will prove productive. Arbitra­\ntion has already failed to produce agreement about how to\ncorrect the Procedures. See supra, at 5. And before the\nSpecial Master, both parties indicated that further “dis­\npute resolution proceedings before the RRCA or an arbi­\ntrator” would be “futile.” Report 69 (quoting Case Man­\nagement Order No. 9 ¶5 (Jan. 25, 2013)). We accordingly\nadopt the Master’s recommendation to amend the Ac­\ncounting Procedures so that they no longer charge Ne­\nbraska for imported water.\n                             V\n   Nebraska argues here for a cramped view of our author­\nity to order disgorgement. Kansas argues for a similarly\nrestrictive idea of our power to modify a technical docu­\nment. We think each has too narrow an understanding of\nthis Court’s role in disputes arising from compacts appor­\ntioning interstate streams. The Court has broad remedial\nauthority in such cases to enforce the compact’s terms.\nHere, compelling Nebraska to disgorge profits deters it\nfrom taking advantage of its upstream position to appro­\npriate more water than the Compact allows. And amend­\ning the Accounting Procedures ensures that the Compact’s\nprovisions will govern the division of the Republican River\nBasin’s (and only that Basin’s) water supply. Both reme­\ndies safeguard the Compact; both insist that States live\nwithin its law. Accordingly, we adopt all of the Special\nMaster’s recommendations.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

The object of the original\nRestatements was “to present an orderly statement of the\ngeneral common law.” Restatement of Conflict of Laws,\nIntroduction, p. viii (1934). Over time, the Restatements’\nauthors have abandoned the mission of describing the law,\nand have chosen instead to set forth their aspirations for\nwhat the law ought to be.

And it cannot safely be assumed, with-\nout further inquiry, that a Restatement provision de-\nscribes rather than revises current law.\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

In exercising our\noriginal jurisdiction in this case, we have a responsibility\nto act in accordance with the rule of law and with appro­\npriate consideration for the sovereign interests of the\nStates before us. I agree with the Court’s conclusion that\nNebraska knowingly, but not deliberately, breached the\nRepublican River Compact, and I agree that there is no\nneed to enter an injunction ordering Nebraska to comply\nwith the Compact. But that is where my agreement ends.\nApplying ordinary principles of contract law to this dis­\npute, I would neither order disgorgement nor reform the\nStates’ settlement agreement.\n   This Court once understood that “the hardship of the\ncase . . . is not sufficient to justify a court of equity to\ndepart from all precedent and assume an unregulated\npower of administering abstract justice at the expense of\nwell-settled principles.” Heine v. Levee Comm’rs, 19 Wall.\n655, 658 (1874). Today, however, the majority disregards\nthese limits. Invoking equitable powers, without equitable\nprinciples, the majority ignores the principles of contract\nlaw that we have traditionally applied to compact disputes\n2                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nbetween sovereign States. It authorizes an arbitrary\naward of disgorgement for breach of that contract. And, it\ninvents a new theory of contract reformation to rewrite the\nagreed-upon terms of that contract. I respectfully dissent\nfrom these holdings.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The States in this action disagree about their rights and\nresponsibilities under the Republican River Compact and\ntheir 2002 Final Settlement Stipulation (Settlement), and\nhave asked this Court to resolve what is, in essence, a\ncontract dispute. “An interstate compact, though provided\nfor in the Constitution, and ratified by Congress, is none­\ntheless essentially a contract between the signatory\nStates.” Oklahoma v. New Mexico, 501 U. S. 221, 242\n(1991) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part). Likewise, a legal settlement agreement is a\ncontract. Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America,\n511 U. S. 375, 381–382 (1994).\n   The Court should therefore interpret the agreements at\nissue according to “the principles of contract law.” Tarrant\nRegional Water Dist. v. Herrmann, 569 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 11). Under these principles, the Com­\npact and Settlement are “legal document[s] that must be\nconstrued and applied in accordance with [their] terms.”\nTexas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 128 (1987) (Texas III);\nsee also Kaktovik v. Watt, 689 F. 2d 222, 230 (CADC 1982)\n(applying “familiar principles of contract law” to a settle­\nment agreement”).\n   That command is even stronger in the context of inter­\nstate compacts, which must be approved by Congress\nunder the Compact Clause of the Constitution. Art. I, §10,\ncl. 3; Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. 330, 351–352\n(2010).

If judges had the power\nto apply their own notions of fairness “to the implementa­\ntion of federal statutes, [they] would be potent lawmakers\nindeed.” Id., at 352. Thus, to the extent that we have\ndeparted from contract law principles when adjudicating\ndisputes over water compacts, it has been to reject loose\nequitable powers of the sort the majority now invokes.\nSee, e.g., id., at 351–353 (rejecting an implied duty of good\nfaith and fair dealing in interstate compacts). We have\nrepeatedly said that “we will not order relief inconsistent\nwith the express terms of a compact, no matter what the\nequities of the circumstances might otherwise invite.” Id.,\nat 352 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n                               B\n   Rather than apply “the principles of contract law,”\nTarrant Regional Water Dist., supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n11), the majority calls upon broad equitable power. Ante,\nat 6–9. It evidently draws this power from its “inherent\nauthority” to apportion interstate streams in the absence\nof an interstate water compact. Ante, at 7. In the major­\nity’s view, States bargain for water rights “in the shadow of\nour equitable apportionment power,” and thus we “may\ninvoke equitable principles” to “devise fair . . . solutions” to\ndisputes between States about the bargains they struck.\nAnte, at 8 (internal quotation marks and alteration\nomitted).\n   That conclusion gets things backwards: As we have\nexplained, once a compact is formed, “courts have no\npower to substitute their own notions of an equitable\napportionment for the apportionment chosen by Congress”\nand the States. Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 568\n(1983) (Texas II ) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The majority next asserts “still greater” equitable power\nby equating contract disputes between sovereign States\nwith cases involving federal law and the public interest.\n4                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nAnte, at 8–9. Although the majority recognizes that it\n“may not order relief inconsistent with a compact’s express\nterms,” it claims enlarged powers “within those limits.”\nAnte, at 9 (internal quotation marks and alterations omit­\nted). “When federal law is at issue and the public interest\nis involved,” the majority says, the Court’s equitable pow­\ners are “even broader and more flexible” than when it\nresolves a private-law dispute. Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   But the precedents on which the majority relies to jus-\ntify this power have nothing to do with water disputes\nbetween States. The majority cites Porter v. Warner Hold-\ning Co., 328 U. S. 395 (1946), which involved a suit by the\nAdministrator of the Office of Price Administration for an\ninjunction against a landlord who had charged too much\nrent in violation of the Emergency Price Control Act of\n1942. In that case, the Court recognized a public interest\nin the Administrator’s effort to “enforce compliance” with\nthe Act, and “to give effect to its purposes.” Id., at 398,\n400. The Court reasoned that, “since the public interest is\ninvolved in a proceeding of this nature, [a district court’s]\nequitable powers assume an even broader and more flexi­\nble character than when only a private controversy is at\nstake.” Id., at 398. The authority Porter cited for this\npoint was Virginian R. Co. v. Railway Employees, 300\nU. S. 515 (1937), a case on which the majority likewise\nrelies. Ante, at 9. But that case, like Porter, did not in­\nvolve a state party or an interstate water dispute; instead,\nit concerned a dispute between private parties—a railroad\nand its employees’ union—arising under the Railway\nLabor Act. Virginian R. Co., supra, at 538. As in Porter,\nthe Court recognized a public interest in the enforcement\nof a federal administrative scheme, explaining that Con­\ngress had made a “declaration of public interest and policy\nwhich should be persuasive in inducing courts to give\nrelief.” 300 U. S., at 552.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n   This case, by contrast, involves the inherent authority of\nsovereign States to regulate the use of water. The States’\n“power to control navigation, fishing, and other public uses\nof water” is not a function of a federal regulatory program;\nit “is an essential attribute of [state] sovereignty.” Tar-\nrant Regional Water Dist., 569 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, when the Court\nresolves an interstate water dispute, it deals not with\npublic policies created by federal statutes, but pre-existing\nsovereign rights, allocated according to the mutual agree­\nment of the parties with the consent of Congress. Al­\nthough the consent of Congress makes statutes of com­\npacts, our flexibility in overseeing a federal statute that\npertains to the exercise of these sovereign powers is not\nthe same as the flexibility Porter claimed for courts en­\ngaged in supervising the administration of a federal regu­\nlatory program. Authority over water is a core attribute of\nstate sovereignty, and “[f ]ederal courts should pause\nbefore using their inherent equitable powers to intrude\ninto the proper sphere of the States.” Missouri v. Jenkins,\n515 U. S. 70, 131 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring).\n   Moreover, even if the involvement of “public interests”\nmight augment the Court’s equitable powers in the con­\ntext of disputes involving regulated parties and their\nregulators, it does not have the same effect in a dispute\nbetween States. States—unlike common carriers and\nlandlords—“possess sovereignty concurrent with that of\nthe Federal Government.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.\n452, 457 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nStates thus come before this Court as sovereigns, seeking\nour assistance in resolving disputes “of such seriousness\nthat it would [otherwise] amount to a casus belli.” Ne-\nbraska v. Wyoming, 515 U. S. 1, 8 (1995) (internal quota­\ntion marks omitted). The Federalist Papers emphasized\nthat this Court’s role in resolving interstate disputes\n“[would] not change the principle” of state sovereignty,\n6                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nand they gave assurances that the Court would take “all\nthe usual and most effectual precautions” necessary for\nimpartial and principled adjudication. The Federalist No.\n39, pp. 245–246 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).\n  For that reason, when the parties before this Court are\nStates, the Court should be more circumspect in its use of\nequitable remedies, not less. We have explained, for\nexample, that “[w]e are especially reluctant to read absent\nterms into an interstate compact given the federalism and\nseparation-of-powers concerns that would arise were we to\nrewrite an agreement among sovereign States, to which\nthe political branches consented.” Alabama, 560 U. S., at\n352. The use of unbounded equitable power against\nStates similarly threatens “to violate principles of state\nsovereignty and of the separation of powers,” Jenkins, 515\nU. S., at 130 (THOMAS, J., concurring). In controversies\namong States, the Court should therefore “exercise the\npower to impose equitable remedies only sparingly, subject\nto clear rules guiding its use.” Id., at 131.\n                            II\n  Applying ordinary contract principles, I would reject the\nSpecial Master’s recommendation to order disgorgement of\nNebraska’s profits for breach of a compact. That remedy\nis not available for a nondeliberate breach of a contract.\nAnd even if it were, such an award must be based on\nNebraska’s profits, not the arbitrary number the Master\nselected.\n                              A\n                              1\n  Although our precedents have not foreclosed disgorge­\nment of profits as a remedy for breach of a water compact,\nthey have suggested that disgorgement would be avail-\nable, if at all, only for the most culpable breaches: those\nthat are “deliberate.” Texas III, 482 U. S., at 132. The\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ntraditional remedy for breach of a water compact has been\nperformance through delivery of water. See Kansas v.\nColorado, 533 U. S. 1, 23 (2001) (O’Connor, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). Although we deviated\nfrom that traditional remedy in Texas III, when we au­\nthorized money damages, 482 U. S., at 132, the majority\ncites no case in which we have ever awarded disgorge­\nment. The lone reference to that remedy in our precedents\nis dictum in Texas III asserting that the money damages\naward in that case would not encourage efficient breaches\nof water compacts “in light of the authority to order . . .\nwhatever additional sanction might be thought necessary\nfor deliberate failure to perform . . . .” Ibid.\n   The lack of support for disgorgement in our compact\ncases comports with the general law of remedies. The\nusual remedy for breach of a contract is damages based on\nthe injured party’s “actual loss caused by the breach.”\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts §347, Comment e, p.\n116 (1979). Disgorgement, by contrast, is an extraordi­\nnary remedy that goes beyond a plaintiff ’s damages,\nrequiring the breaching party to refund additional profits\ngained in the breach. See 3 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies\n§12.7(3), pp. 166–167 (2d ed. 1993). In American law,\ndisgorgement of profits is not generally an available rem-\nedy for breach of contract. Id., §12.7(4), at 171.\n   Even if Texas III supported a narrow exception for cases\ninvolving deliberate breach of a water compact, that ex­\nception would not apply here. Although it is uncontested\nthat Nebraska breached the Compact and that Kansas lost\n$3.7 million as a result, ante, at 9–10, the Master expressly\nfound that there is no evidence that Nebraska deliber-\nately breached the Compact. Report of Special Master\n111, 130 (Report). In fact, Nebraska’s efforts “were ear­\nnest and substantial enough to preclude a finding that this\nwas a consciously opportunistic breach.” Id., at 131. And\nalthough the majority adopts the finding that Nebraska\n8                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n“knowingly failed” to comply with the Compact, ante, at 13\n(internal quotation marks omitted), a finding that I do not\ndispute, neither the parties nor the majority disagrees\nwith the Master’s conclusion that Nebraska did not inten­\ntionally or deliberately breach the Compact, ante, at 10–\n14. Under such circumstances, disgorgement is not an\navailable remedy.\n                             2\n   The Special Master nevertheless recommended dis­\ngorgement because Nebraska “knowingly exposed Kansas\nto a substantial risk” of noncompliance. Report 130. He\nrested this recommendation on the Restatement (Third) of\nRestitution and Unjust Enrichment §39 (2010). See Re­\nport 130–134. That section proposes awarding disgorge­\nment when a party’s profits from its breach are greater\nthan the loss to the other party. The remedy is thought\nnecessary because one party may “exploit the shortcom­\nings” of traditional damages remedies by breaching con­\ntracts when its expected profits exceed the damages it\nwould be required to pay to the other party. Restatement\n(Third) of Restitution §39, Comment b, at 649. In other\nwords, the remedy “condemns a form of conscious\nadvantage-taking” and seeks to thwart an “opportunistic\ncalculation” that breaching is better than performing.\nIbid.\n   This Court, however, has never before relied on §39 nor\nadopted its proposed theory of disgorgement. And for good\nreason: It lacks support in the law. One reviewer of §39\nhas described it as a “novel extension” of restitution prin­\nciples that “will alter the doctrinal landscape of contract\nlaw.” Roberts, Restitutionary Disgorgement for Opportun­\nistic Breach of Contract and Mitigation of Damages, 42\nLoyola (LA) L. Rev. 131, 134 (2008). And few courts have\never relied on §39. The sheer novelty of this proposed\nremedy counsels against applying it here.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             9\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  In any event, §39 opines that disgorgement should be\navailable only when a party deliberately breaches a con­\ntract. This makes sense. If disgorgement is an antidote\nfor “efficient breach,” then it need only be administered\nwhen “conscious advantage-taking” and “opportunistic\ncalculation” are present. But as noted above, the Master\nexpressly found that no deliberate breach occurred. Re­\nport 130. The Master’s reliance on §39 was accordingly\nmisplaced.\n                                 3\n   Perhaps recognizing the weakness in the Master’s rec­\nommendation, the majority takes a different approach,\nfashioning a new remedy of disgorgement for reckless\nbreach. According to the majority, Nebraska’s conduct\nwas essentially reckless, ante, at 14, and the Court may\norder disgorgement “when a State has demonstrated\nreckless disregard” for another State’s contractual rights,\nante, at 16. As with the Restatement’s proposed theory,\nthere is no basis for that proposition in our cases.\n   Because disgorgement is available, if at all, only in cases\nof deliberate breach, the majority asserts that, “[i]n some\nareas of the law,” the line between intent and reckless\ndisregard “makes no difference.” Ante, at 15. Accepting\nthe truth of that proposition in some circumstances, the\nmajority’s caveat acknowledges that it is not true in oth­\ners. Indeed, the law often places significant weight on the\ndistinction between intentional and reckless conduct. See,\ne.g., Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 61 (1998) (dis­\ncussing “ ‘willful,’ ” “deliberate,” and “intentional” conduct,\nand distinguishing those terms from “reckless” conduct);\nsee also Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 563\nU. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 13–14) (distinguish­\ning “willful blindness” from “recklessness”).\n   The majority provides scant support for its conclusion\nthat breach of an interstate water compact is an area in\n10                  KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nwhich the line between intent and recklessness is practi­\ncally irrelevant. It first relies on Bullock v. BankCham-\npaign, N. A., 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 1), in\nwhich the Court determined the mental state necessary\nfor “ ‘defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,’ ” as\nused in the Bankruptcy Code. Ante, at 15. In the absence\nof a fiduciary relationship, however, Bullock has little\nrelevance. Cf. Harris Trust and Sav. Bank v. Salomon\nSmith Barney Inc., 530 U. S. 238, 250 (2000) (noting the\nspecial disgorgement rules that apply “when a trustee in\nbreach of his fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries transfers\ntrust property to a third person”).\n   The majority next relies on Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n425 U. S. 185 (1976), which addressed “scienter” under\n§10(b) of the Securities Act of 1933. Ante, at 15 (citing 425\nU. S., at 193–194, n. 12). The Court noted that it used the\nterm “scienter” to mean “intent to deceive, manipulate, or\ndefraud.” Id., at 194, n. 12. It then asserted—in dictum\nand without support—that recklessness is considered to be\na form of intentional conduct in some areas of the law, but\nit declined to address whether reckless conduct could be\nsufficient for §10(b) liability. Ibid. That dictum is hardly\nsufficient grounds for claiming that recklessness and\nintent are equivalent mental states in compact disputes\nbetween States.\n   If anything, the reverse is true. Disgorgement is strong\nmedicine, and as with other forms of equitable power, we\nshould impose it against the States “only sparingly.”\nJenkins, 515 U. S., at 131 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The\nmajority insists that the justification for disgorgement is\nenhanced “when one State gambles with another State’s\nrights to a scarce natural resource.” Ante, at 16. But the\nway this Court has always discouraged gambling with this\nscarce resource is to require delivery of water, not money.\nPrior to 1987, “we had never even suggested that mone­\ntary damages could be recovered from a State as a remedy\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nfor its violation of an interstate compact apportioning the\nflow of an interstate stream.” Kansas v. Colorado, 533\nU. S., at 23 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissent­\ning in part). If a State’s right to the “scarce natural re­\nsource” of water is the problem, then perhaps the Court\nought to follow its usual practice of ordering specific per­\nformance rather than improvising a new remedy of “reck­\nless disgorgement.”\n                              B\n   The majority compounds its errors by authorizing an\narbitrary amount of disgorgement. As explained above,\nthe measure of the disgorgement award should be the\nprofits derived from a deliberate breach. Yet the Special\nMaster acknowledged that its $1.8 million award was not\nbased on any measure of Nebraska’s profits from breach­\ning the Compact. Report 179–180. The Master gave no\ndollar estimate of Nebraska’s profits and said only that its\ngain was “very much larger than Kansas’ loss” of $3.7\nmillion, “likely by more than several multiples.” Id., at\n178. Despite producing no estimate more precise than\n“very much larger,” the Master ordered a disgorgement\naward of $1.8 million. Id., at 178–179.\n   The majority explains that “we cannot be sure why the\nMaster selected the exact number he did.” Ante, at 19.\nIndeed. Neither the majority nor the Special Master nor I\ncan identify a justifiable basis for this amount. It appears\nthat $1.8 million just feels like not too much, but not too\nlittle.\n   We should hold ourselves to a higher standard. In other\ncontexts, we have demanded that district courts “provide\nproper justification” for a monetary award rather than\ndivining an amount that appears to be “essentially arbi­\ntrary.” Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. 542, 557 (2010). We\nshould do the same ourselves if we are going to award\ndisgorgement here. As with ordinary damages, disgorge­\n12                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nment should not be awarded “beyond an amount that the\nevidence permits to be established with reasonable cer­\ntainty.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §352. And a\ndisgorgement award ought to be calculated based on some­\nthing more than the Special Master’s intuitions.\n   The majority claims that the Master “took into account\nthe appropriate considerations,” including “Nebraska’s\nincentives, past behavior, and more recent compliance\nefforts” in reaching the award. Ante, at 19. But it makes\nno difference that he took those factors into account if he\narrived at a number that has no articulable relationship to\nNebraska’s profits. Equitable disgorgement is not an\narbitrary penalty designed to compel compliance, nor\nshould it become one.\n   What is more, the Master considered factors beyond\nthose relevant to the calculation of a disgorgement award.\nIn his view, $1.8 million “moves substantially towards\nturning the actual recovery by Kansas, net of reasonable\ntransaction costs, into an amount that approximates a full\nrecovery for the harm suffered.” Report 179. In other\nwords, $1.8 million makes Kansas whole because it is a\nreasonable estimate of Kansas’ “transaction costs”—which\npresumably means the State’s attorney’s fees and litiga­\ntion costs. But, under the “American Rule,” we generally\ndo not award attorney’s fees “to a prevailing party absent\nexplicit statutory authority.” Buckhannon Board & Care\nHome, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human\nResources, 532 U. S. 598, 602 (2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). And neither the majority, nor Kansas,\nnor the Special Master offers any support for the proposi­\ntion that a disgorgement award can smuggle in an award\nof attorney’s fees. If disgorgement were an appropriate\nremedy in this case, then the Court should require a calcu­\nlation based on Nebraska’s profits rather than Kansas’\n“transaction costs.”\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

The\nremedy of reformation is available to correct a contract if,\n“owing to mutual mistake, the language used therein did\nnot fully or accurately express the agreement and inten­\ntion of the parties.” Philippine Sugar Estates Development\nCo. v. Government of Philippine Islands, 247 U. S. 385,\n389 (1918). The well-established rule is that, when a\nwritten contract “fails to express the agreement because of\na mistake of both parties as to the contents or effect of the\nwriting, the court may at the request of a party reform the\nwriting to express the agreement.” Restatement (Second)\nof Contracts §155, at 406.\n   Reformation is thus available only when the parties\nreach an agreement but then “fail to express it correctly in\nthe writing.” Id., Comment a, at 406. If “the parties make\na written agreement that they would not otherwise have\nmade because of a mistake other than one as to expres­\nsion, the court will not reform a writing to reflect the\nagreement that it thinks they would have made.” Id.,\nComment b, at 408. Because modifying a written agree­\nment is an extraordinary step, a party seeking reformation\nmust prove the existence of a mutual mistake of expres­\nsion by “ ‘clear and convincing evidence.’ ” Id., Comment c,\nat 410.\n   Nebraska cannot meet that burden because the States\nmade no mistake in reducing their agreement to writing.\nHere are the terms the States agreed upon in their bind­\ning Settlement:\n    “Beneficial Consumptive Use of Imported Water Sup­\n    ply shall not count as Computed Beneficial Consump­\n    tive Use or Virgin Water Supply. . . . Determinations\n14                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n     of Beneficial Consumptive Use from Imported Water\n     Supply (whether determined expressly or by implica­\n     tion) . . . shall be calculated in accordance with the\n     [Republican River Compact Admin. (RRCA)] Account­\n     ing Procedures and by using the RRCA Groundwater\n     Model.” Settlement §IV(F), p. 25.\nThe States thus agreed not to count water imported from\noutside the Republican River Basin. But in the very same\nprovision, they agreed to calculate the use of imported\nwater using the RRCA Accounting Procedures and the\nRRCA Groundwater Model. The terms of the Settlement\nare thus crystal clear: The accounting procedures control\ndeterminations of consumptive use of imported water.\nAnd the parties do not contend that they made any draft­\ning mistake in recording the accounting procedures or the\ngroundwater model.\n   Instead, the parties’ mistake was their belief that the\naccounting procedures and water model they agreed upon\nwould accurately exclude imported water from the calcula­\ntion of Nebraska’s consumptive use. They were wrong\nabout this. In fact, under dry weather conditions, when\nnative water flows are depleted, the water model charges\nNebraska for pumping imported water. Report 32–37.\nThe parties did not realize the magnitude of this error. To\nthe extent they thought about it at all, they realized the\nwater model was not perfectly precise, but assumed that\nonly very small, immaterial amounts of imported water\nwould make their way into the calculations. See id., at 27.\nA key member of the modeling committee testified that he\nwas “intellectually aware” of the imported-water issue, but\nthat “we didn’t believe that that was going to be a big\nissue.” See Tr. 727 (testimony of Willem Schreüder).\n   There is no testimony from any source suggesting that\nthe parties agreed to a different water model. See Report\n26–27. Nebraska thus cannot meet its burden to show by\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nclear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to\nNebraska’s “ ‘5-run formula,’ ” ante, at 20, but failed to\nexpress that agreement accurately in writing.\n  If there is any mistake in this Settlement, it is not a\nmistake in writing, but in thinking. The parties knew\nwhat the methodology was and they expressly agreed to\nthat methodology. They simply thought the methodology\nwould work better than it did. See Tr. 727. Even though\nthe methodology they agreed upon was imperfect, a writ­\ning may be reformed only to conform with the parties’\nactual agreement, not to create a better one.\n  The appropriate equitable remedy, if any, in these cir­\ncumstances would be rescission, not reformation. In gen­\neral, if there is a mutual mistake “as to a basic assumption\non which the contract was made,” the adversely affected\nparty may seek to avoid the contract. Restatement (Sec­\nond) of Contracts §152, at 385; see also id., §155, Com­\nment b, Illustration 4, at 409 (noting that reformation is\nnot available to remedy a mistake as to something other\nthan reducing the agreement to writing). The States have\nnot asked for rescission, of course, but it is incorrect to\nsuggest, see ante, at 27, that there is no other solution to\nthis problem.\n                             B\n   Realizing that ordinary reformation is not available for\nNebraska, the majority again summons its equitable\npower and renegotiates the accounting procedures to\ncreate what it considers a fairer agreement for the States.\nIn doing so, it announces a new doctrine of reformation: In\nresolving water disputes, the Court will “correct subsidi­\nary technical agreements to promote accuracy in appor­\ntion[ment].” Ante, at 24. From here on out, the Court will\n“modif[y] a technical agreement to correct material errors\nin the way it operates and thus align it with the compact­\ning States’ intended apportionment.” Ante, at 25.\n16                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  As this case illustrates, adopting this novel remedy is a\nmistake. The majority fails in its attempt to conform this\nnew doctrine of “technical agreement correction” with both\nprinciples of equity and our precedent governing compact\ndisputes. And after creating an unjustified doctrine, the\nmajority misapplies it.\n                              1\n  To begin, the majority’s reliance on equitable power is\nmisplaced. That a court is exercising equitable power\nmeans only that it must look to established principles of\nequity. And reformation is the equitable doctrine that\nNebraska seeks in this case. The Court should thus follow\nthe rules of reformation, just as it would adhere to the\ncontours of any other equitable doctrine. Indeed, we have\ndemanded as much from lower courts when they exercise\ntheir power to grant other forms of equitable relief, such\nas a permanent injunction. See eBay Inc. v. Merc-\nExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 392–394 (2006). If a\ncourt fails to apply the proper standard for a permanent\ninjunction, it is no answer to recite the obvious fact that\nthe court acted in equity. See id., at 394.\n  Putting aside the assertion of equitable power, there is\nno support in our precedents for the majority’s doctrine of\n“technical agreement correction.” The majority first sug­\ngests that this Court reformed a “technical document” in\nTexas v. New Mexico, 446 U. S. 540 (1980) (per curiam)\n(Texas I ). Ante, at 24. But there was no reformation at\nissue in that case—either of the compact or an ancillary\ntechnical agreement—only the interpretation of the words\nin the Pecos River Compact. Texas I, supra, at 540; see\nReport of Special Master on Obligation of New Mexico to\nTexas under the Pecos River Compact, O. T. 1975, No. 65,\nOrig., pp. 15–16, 34–37 (filed Oct. 15, 1979) (purporting to\ninterpret the compact).\n  The majority also claims that in Kansas v. Colorado, 543\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nU. S. 86 (2004), we “approved the Master’s alteration of\nthe parties’ agreement . . . .” Ante, at 24. But nothing in\nKansas v. Colorado supports revising the express terms of\na settlement agreement. In that case, the Court adopted a\nSpecial Master’s recommendation to calculate water usage\nbased on a 10–year average rather than a single year. 543\nU. S., at 99–100. There is no suggestion in the Court’s\nopinion (nor in the briefs filed in that case) that the States\nhad previously agreed to use a 1-year method for calculat­\ning water usage or that anyone thought “reformation” of\nthe compact or any ancillary agreement was needed. To\nthe contrary, the Court explained that the compact simply\ndid “not define the length of time over which” the States\nmust make the relevant measurements. Id., at 100.\nThere was thus nothing to rewrite, nothing to reform. The\nmajority suggests that the States in that case had “ ‘agreed\nto the use of annual measurement’ ” for calculating future\nwater usage, ante, at 24 (quoting Kansas v. Colorado,\nsupra, at 102), but the quoted passage refers to the unre­\nlated fact that the States had, earlier in the litigation,\n“agreed to the use of annual measurement for purposes of\ncalculating past damages,” not future water usage, 543\nU. S., at 102 (emphasis added). That litigation stipulation\ndid not apply to the calculation of future water usage or\nfuture damages. Ibid. Even if the majority were correct\nthat a damages calculation is simply the flip side of a\nwater usage calculation, ante, at 25, n. 10, that conclusion\nplainly would apply only to calculation of past water us­\nage. It is thus no surprise that the Court held that any\npre-existing damages agreements did not govern the\nmethod of measuring future compliance. Kansas v. Colo-\nrado, supra, at 103. Given that the Court plainly did not\napply any such agreements, it cannot be said to have\naltered them.\n18                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n                             2\n   Having improperly invented the doctrine of “technical\nagreement correction,” the majority proceeds to misapply\nit. In “correcting” the accounting procedures, the majority\npurports to align them with the intent of the compacting\nparties. Ante, at 24–25. But we know that the majority’s\nreformed contract does not match the “States’ intended\napportionment.” Ante, at 25. We know this because the\nSettlement expressly states that, for purposes of appor­\ntioning the flow, imported water use would be calculated\nusing the agreed-upon “Accounting Procedures” and the\n“Groundwater Model.” Settlement §IV(F), at 25. The\nStates never intended to adopt the 5-run formula, and the\nCourt has simply picked a winner and adopted Nebraska’s\n5-run proposal, notwithstanding a binding agreement to\nthe contrary.\n   The majority also misapplies its “correction” remedy in\nclaiming that its fix will prevent the existing accounting\nprocedures from “affirmatively violat[ing] the Compact.”\nAnte, at 26. I cannot see how this is true. First, the exist­\ning procedures do not violate the Compact. We should\nfavor an interpretation of the Compact that would render\nits performance possible, rather than “impossible or mean­\ningless.” 2 S. Williston, Law of Contracts §620, p. 1202\n(1920). Read in light of this principle, the phrase “Virgin\nWater Supply” must be interpreted to allow for some\nimperfection in the groundwater models.           After all,\ngroundwater models are approximations of the physical\nworld. Tr. 722–726. No accounting procedure can plausi­\nbly track every drop of water through the 24,900 square\nmile Basin. Id., at 724.\n   Second, even if the existing accounting procedures\nwould violate the Compact because they allocate some\nimported water, the majority’s “correction” will not solve\nthe problem. Because water models are always approxi­\nmations, even the 5-run formula will be imprecise and will\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          19\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ntherefore violate the Compact if it is read to require the\nStates accurately to account for every drop of imported\nwater.\n                         *   *    *\n  Claiming to draw from a vast reservoir of equitable\npower, the Court ignores the limits of its role in resolving\nwater-compact disputes between States. And in the name\nof protecting downstream States from their upstream\nneighbors, it diminishes the sovereign status of each of\nthem.\n  We owe the parties better. I would apply the same\nprinciples of contract law that we have previously applied\nto water disputes between States. Under those principles,\nI would sustain Nebraska’s and Colorado’s exceptions to\nthe Master’s recommendation to order $1.8 million in\ndisgorgement, and overrule Kansas’ exception to that\nrecommendation. I would also sustain Kansas’ exception\nto the Master’s recommendation to reform the Settlement.\n  I agree only with the Court’s decisions to overrule Ne­\nbraska’s exception to the Master’s finding that it know-\ningly failed to comply with the Compact, and Kansas’ ex­\nception to the Master’s recommendation not to issue\nan injunction requiring Nebraska to comply with the\nCompact.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2781442/", "sha1": "d25ef5dd1a06a1abc5c86a74bcd820678629f351", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-02-24T08:01:14.365151"}
