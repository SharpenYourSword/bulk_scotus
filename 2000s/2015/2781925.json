Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n                      YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 13\u20137451. Argued November 5, 2014\u2014Decided February 25, 2015\nWhile conducting an offshore inspection of a commercial fishing vessel\n in the Gulf of Mexico, a federal agent found that the ship\u2019s catch con-\n tained undersized red grouper, in violation of federal conservation\n regulations. The officer instructed the ship\u2019s captain, petitioner\n Yates, to keep the undersized fish segregated from the rest of the\n catch until the ship returned to port. After the officer departed,\n Yates instead told a crew member to throw the undersized fish over-\n board. For this offense, Yates was charged with destroying, conceal-\n ing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investiga-\n tion, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a71519. That section provides that a\n person may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years if he \u201cknowingly\n alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a\n false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent\n to impede, obstruct, or influence\u201d a federal investigation. At trial,\n Yates moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \u00a71519 charge. Point-\n ing to \u00a71519\u2019s origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\n a law designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial\n markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Yates argued\n that \u00a71519\u2019s reference to \u201ctangible object\u201d subsumes objects used to\n store information, such as computer hard drives, not fish. The Dis-\n trict Court denied Yates\u2019s motion, and a jury found him guilty of vio-\n lating \u00a71519. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction, conclud-\n ing that \u00a71519 applies to the destruction or concealment of fish\n because, as objects having physical form, fish fall within the diction-\n ary definition of \u201ctangible object.\u201d\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n733 F. 3d 1059, reversed and remanded.\n2                        YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n       JUSTICE GINSBURG, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE BREYER,\n    and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded that a \u201ctangible object\u201d within\n    \u00a71519\u2019s compass is one used to record or preserve information. Pp. 6\u2013\n    20.\n       (a) Although dictionary definitions of the words \u201ctangible\u201d and \u201cob-\n    ject\u201d bear consideration in determining the meaning of \u201ctangible ob-\n    ject\u201d in \u00a71519, they are not dispositive. Whether a statutory term is\n    unambiguous \u201cis determined [not only] by reference to the language\n    itself, [but also by] the specific context in which that language is\n    used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u201d Robinson v.\n    Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341. Identical language may convey\n    varying content when used in different statutes, sometimes even in\n    different provisions of the same statute. See, e.g., FAA v. Cooper, 566\n    U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) Familiar interpretive guides aid the construction of \u201ctangible\n    object.\u201d Though not commanding, \u00a71519\u2019s heading\u2014\u201cDestruction, al-\n    teration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and\n    bankruptcy\u201d\u2014conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spolia-\n    tion of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records.\n       Section 1519\u2019s position within Title 18, Chapter 73, further signals\n    that \u00a71519 was not intended to serve as a cross-the-board ban on the\n    destruction of physical evidence. Congress placed \u00a71519 at the end of\n    Chapter 73 following immediately after pre-existing specialized pro-\n    visions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits.\n       The contemporaneous passage of \u00a71512(c)(1), which prohibits a\n    person from \u201calter[ing], destroy[ing], mutilat[ing], or conceal[ing] a\n    record, document, or other object . . . with the intent to impair the ob-\n    ject\u2019s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding,\u201d is also\n    instructive. The Government argues that \u00a71512(c)(1)\u2019s reference to\n    \u201cother object\u201d includes any and every physical object. But if \u00a71519\u2019s\n    reference to \u201ctangible object\u201d already included all physical objects, as\n    the Government also contends, then Congress had no reason to enact\n    \u00a71512(c)(1). Section 1519 should not be read to render superfluous an\n    entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same Act. See\n    Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. ___, ___.\n       The words immediately surrounding \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519\u2014\n    \u201cfalsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or] document\u201d\u2014also\n    cabin the contextual meaning of that term. Applying the canons\n    noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis, \u201ctangible object,\u201d as the last in\n    a list of terms that begins \u201cany record [or] document,\u201d is appropriate-\n    ly read to refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the sub-\n    set of tangible objects used to record or preserve information. This\n    moderate interpretation accords with the list of actions \u00a71519 pro-\n    scribes; the verbs \u201cfalsif[y]\u201d and \u201cmak[e] a false entry in\u201d typically\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to\n  record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives. See\n  Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575.\n     Use of traditional tools of statutory interpretation to examine\n  markers of congressional intent within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and\n  \u00a71519 itself thus call for rejection of an aggressive interpretation of\n  \u201ctangible object.\u201d\n     Furthermore, the meaning of \u201crecord, document, or thing\u201d in a pro-\n  vision of the 1962 Model Penal Code (MPC) that has been interpreted\n  to prohibit tampering with any kind of physical evidence is not a reli-\n  able indicator of the meaning Congress assigned to \u201crecord, docu-\n  ment, or tangible object\u201d in \u00a71519. There are significant differences\n  between the offense described by the MPC provision and the offense\n  created by \u00a71519. Pp. 10\u201318.\n     (c) Finally, if recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction\n  leaves any doubt about the meaning of \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519, it\n  would be appropriate to invoke the rule of lenity. Pp. 18\u201319.\n     JUSTICE ALITO concluded that traditional rules of statutory con-\n  struction confirm that Yates has the better argument. Title 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a71519\u2019s list of nouns, list of verbs, and title, when combined,\n  tip the case in favor of Yates. Applying the canons noscitur a sociis\n  and ejusdem generis to the list of nouns\u2014\u201cany record, document, or\n  tangible object\u201d\u2014the term \u201ctangible object\u201d should refer to something\n  similar to records or documents. And while many of \u00a71519\u2019s verbs\u2014\n  \u201calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a\n  false entry in\u201d\u2014could apply to far-flung nouns such as salamanders\n  or sand dunes, the term \u201cmakes a false entry in\u201d makes no sense out-\n  side of filekeeping. Finally, \u00a71519\u2019s title\u2014\u201cDestruction, alteration, or\n  falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy\u201d\u2014\n  also points toward filekeeping rather than fish.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 25, 2015]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG announced the judgment of the\nCourt and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join.\n  John Yates, a commercial fisherman, caught undersized\nred grouper in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. To\nprevent federal authorities from confirming that he had\nharvested undersized fish, Yates ordered a crew member\nto toss the suspect catch into the sea. For this offense, he\nwas charged with, and convicted of, violating 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71519, which provides:\n       \u201cWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates,\n    conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in\n    any record, document, or tangible object with the in-\n    tent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation\n    or proper administration of any matter within the ju-\n    risdiction of any department or agency of the United\n    States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to\n    or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be\n    fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20\n    years, or both.\u201d\nYates was also indicted and convicted under \u00a72232(a),\nwhich provides:\n2                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n      \u201cDESTRUCTION OR REMOVAL OF PROPERTY TO\n    PREVENT SEIZURE.\u2014Whoever, before, during, or after\n    any search for or seizure of property by any person\n    authorized to make such search or seizure, knowingly\n    destroys, damages, wastes, disposes of, transfers, or\n    otherwise takes any action, or knowingly attempts to\n    destroy, damage, waste, dispose of, transfer, or other-\n    wise take any action, for the purpose of preventing or\n    impairing the Government\u2019s lawful authority to take\n    such property into its custody or control or to continue\n    holding such property under its lawful custody and\n    control, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned\n    not more than 5 years, or both.\u201d\nYates does not contest his conviction for violating\n\u00a72232(a), but he maintains that fish are not trapped\nwithin the term \u201ctangible object,\u201d as that term is used in\n\u00a71519.\n   Section 1519 was enacted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 116 Stat. 745, legislation designed to protect\ninvestors and restore trust in financial markets following\nthe collapse of Enron Corporation. A fish is no doubt an\nobject that is tangible; fish can be seen, caught, and\nhandled, and a catch, as this case illustrates, is vulnerable\nto destruction. But it would cut \u00a71519 loose from its\nfinancial-fraud mooring to hold that it encompasses any\nand all objects, whatever their size or significance, de-\nstroyed with obstructive intent. Mindful that in Sarbanes-\nOxley, Congress trained its attention on corporate and\naccounting deception and cover-ups, we conclude that a\nmatching construction of \u00a71519 is in order: A tangible\nobject captured by \u00a71519, we hold, must be one used to\nrecord or preserve information.\n                            I\n  On August 23, 2007, the Miss Katie, a commercial fish-\ning boat, was six days into an expedition in the Gulf of\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nMexico. Her crew numbered three, including Yates, the\ncaptain. Engaged in a routine offshore patrol to inspect\nboth recreational and commercial vessels, Officer John\nJones of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Com-\nmission decided to board the Miss Katie to check on the\nvessel\u2019s compliance with fishing rules. Although the Miss\nKatie was far enough from the Florida coast to be in exclu-\nsively federal waters, she was nevertheless within Officer\nJones\u2019s jurisdiction. Because he had been deputized as a\nfederal agent by the National Marine Fisheries Service,\nOfficer Jones had authority to enforce federal, as well as\nstate, fishing laws.\n   Upon boarding the Miss Katie, Officer Jones noticed\nthree red grouper that appeared to be undersized hanging\nfrom a hook on the deck. At the time, federal conservation\nregulations required immediate release of red grouper less\nthan 20 inches long. 50 CFR \u00a7622.37(d)(2)(ii) (effective\nApril 2, 2007). Violation of those regulations is a civil\noffense punishable by a fine or fishing license suspension.\nSee 16 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71857(1)(A), (G), 1858(a), (g).\n   Suspecting that other undersized fish might be on\nboard, Officer Jones proceeded to inspect the ship\u2019s catch,\nsetting aside and measuring only fish that appeared to\nhim to be shorter than 20 inches. Officer Jones ultimately\ndetermined that 72 fish fell short of the 20-inch mark. A\nfellow officer recorded the length of each of the undersized\nfish on a catch measurement verification form. With few\nexceptions, the measured fish were between 19 and 20\ninches; three were less than 19 inches; none were less\nthan 18.75 inches. After separating the fish measuring\nbelow 20 inches from the rest of the catch by placing them\nin wooden crates, Officer Jones directed Yates to leave the\nfish, thus segregated, in the crates until the Miss Katie\nreturned to port. Before departing, Officer Jones issued\nYates a citation for possession of undersized fish.\n   Four days later, after the Miss Katie had docked in\n4                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nCortez, Florida, Officer Jones measured the fish contained\nin the wooden crates. This time, however, the measured\nfish, although still less than 20 inches, slightly exceeded\nthe lengths recorded on board. Jones surmised that the\nfish brought to port were not the same as those he had\ndetected during his initial inspection. Under questioning,\none of the crew members admitted that, at Yates\u2019s direc-\ntion, he had thrown overboard the fish Officer Jones had\nmeasured at sea, and that he and Yates had replaced the\ntossed grouper with fish from the rest of the catch.\n   For reasons not disclosed in the record before us, more\nthan 32 months passed before criminal charges were\nlodged against Yates. On May 5, 2010, he was indicted for\ndestroying property to prevent a federal seizure, in viola-\ntion of \u00a72232(a), and for destroying, concealing, and cover-\ning up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in\nviolation of \u00a71519.1 By the time of the indictment, the\nminimum legal length for Gulf red grouper had been\nlowered from 20 inches to 18 inches. See 50 CFR\n\u00a7622.37(d)(2)(iv) (effective May 18, 2009). No measured\nfish in Yates\u2019s catch fell below that limit. The record does\nnot reveal what civil penalty, if any, Yates received for his\npossession of fish undersized under the 2007 regulation.\nSee 16 U. S. C. \u00a71858(a).\n   Yates was tried on the criminal charges in August 2011.\nAt the end of the Government\u2019s case in chief, he moved for\na judgment of acquittal on the \u00a71519 charge. Pointing to\n\u00a71519\u2019s title and its origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act, Yates argued that the section sets forth \u201ca\ndocuments offense\u201d and that its reference to \u201ctangible\nobject[s]\u201d subsumes \u201ccomputer hard drives, logbooks, [and]\nthings of that nature,\u201d not fish. App. 91\u201392. Yates\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Yates was also charged with making a false statement to federal law\n\nenforcement officers, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a71001(a)(2). That\ncharge, on which Yates was acquitted, is not relevant to our analysis.\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)               5\n\n                      Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nacknowledged that the Criminal Code contains \u201csections\nthat would have been appropriate for the [G]overnment to\npursue\u201d if it wished to prosecute him for tampering with\nevidence. App. 91. Section 2232(a), set out supra, at 1\u20132,\nfit that description. But \u00a71519, Yates insisted, did not.\n   The Government countered that a \u201ctangible object\u201d\nwithin \u00a71519\u2019s compass is \u201csimply something other than a\ndocument or record.\u201d App. 93. The trial judge expressed\nmisgivings about reading \u201ctangible object\u201d as broadly as\nthe Government urged: \u201cIsn\u2019t there a Latin phrase [about]\nconstruction of a statute . . . . The gist of it is . . . you take\na look at [a] line of words, and you interpret the words\nconsistently. So if you\u2019re talking about documents, and\nrecords, tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature\nof a document or a record, as opposed to a fish.\u201d Ibid. The\nfirst-instance judge nonetheless followed controlling Elev-\nenth Circuit precedent. While recognizing that \u00a71519 was\npassed as part of legislation targeting corporate fraud, the\nCourt of Appeals had instructed that \u201cthe broad language\nof \u00a71519 is not limited to corporate fraud cases, and \u2018Con-\ngress is free to pass laws with language covering areas\nwell beyond the particular crisis du jour that initially\nprompted legislative action.\u2019 \u201d       No. 2:10\u2013cr\u201366\u2013FtM\u2013\n29SPC (MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2011), App. 116 (quoting United\nStates v. Hunt, 526 F. 3d 739, 744 (CA11 2008)). Accord-\ningly, the trial court read \u201ctangible object\u201d as a term \u201cin-\ndependent\u201d of \u201crecord\u201d or \u201cdocument.\u201d App. 116. For\nviolating \u00a71519 and \u00a72232(a), the court sentenced Yates to\nimprisonment for 30 days, followed by supervised release\nfor three years. App. 118\u2013120. For life, he will bear the\nstigma of having a federal felony conviction.\n   On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found the text of \u00a71519\n\u201cplain.\u201d 733 F. 3d 1059, 1064 (2013). Because \u201ctangible\nobject\u201d was \u201cundefined\u201d in the statute, the Court of Ap-\npeals gave the term its \u201cordinary or natural meaning,\u201d i.e.,\nits dictionary definition, \u201c[h]aving or possessing physical\n6                 YATES v.

The Government acknowledges that\n\u00a71519 was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate\ndocument-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrong-\ndoing. Brief for United States 46.

Rather, \u201c[t]he plainness or ambiguity of\nstatutory language is determined [not only] by reference to\nthe language itself, [but as well by] the specific context in\nwhich that language is used, and the broader context of\nthe statute as a whole.\u201d Robinson v.

That Rule requires the\nprosecution to grant a defendant\u2019s request to inspect\n\u201ctangible objects\u201d within the Government\u2019s control that\nhave utility for the defense. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n16(a)(1)(E).\n   Rule 16\u2019s reference to \u201ctangible objects\u201d has been inter-\npreted to include any physical evidence. See 5 W. LaFave,\nJ. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a720.3(g),\npp. 405\u2013406, and n. 120 (3d ed. 2007). Rule 16 is a discov-\nery rule designed to protect defendants by compelling the\nprosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material\nto the charges at issue. In that context, a comprehensive\nconstruction of \u201ctangible objects\u201d is fitting. In contrast,\n\u00a71519 is a penal provision that refers to \u201ctangible object\u201d\nnot in relation to a request for information relevant to a\nspecific court proceeding, but rather in relation to federal\ninvestigations or proceedings of every kind, including\nthose not yet begun.3 See Commissioner v. National Car-\nbide Corp., 167 F. 2d 304, 306 (CA2 1948) (Hand, J.)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The  dissent assiduously ignores all this, post, at 11\u201312, in insisting\nthat Congress wrote \u00a71519 to cover, along with shredded corporate\ndocuments, red grouper slightly smaller than the legal limit.\n  3 For the same reason, we do not think the meaning of \u201ctangible ob-\n\njects\u201d (or \u201ctangible things,\u201d see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)) in other\ndiscovery prescriptions cited by the Government leads to the conclusion\nthat \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519 encompasses any and all physical\nevidence existing on land or in the sea.\n10               YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n(\u201cwords are chameleons, which reflect the color of their\nenvironment\u201d). Just as the context of Rule 16 supports\ngiving \u201ctangible object\u201d a meaning as broad as its diction-\nary definition, the context of \u00a71519 tugs strongly in favor\nof a narrower reading.\n                              B\n   Familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the\nwords \u201ctangible object\u201d as they appear in \u00a71519.\n   We note first \u00a71519\u2019s caption: \u201cDestruction, alteration,\nor falsification of records in Federal investigations and\nbankruptcy.\u201d That heading conveys no suggestion that the\nsection prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evi-\ndence, however remote from records. Neither does the\ntitle of the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in which\n\u00a71519 was placed, \u00a7802: \u201cCriminal penalties for altering\ndocuments.\u201d 116 Stat. 800. Furthermore, \u00a71520, the only\nother provision passed as part of \u00a7802, is titled \u201cDestruc-\ntion of corporate audit records\u201d and addresses only that\nspecific subset of records and documents. While these\nheadings are not commanding, they supply cues that\nCongress did not intend \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519 to\nsweep within its reach physical objects of every kind,\nincluding things no one would describe as records, docu-\nments, or devices closely associated with them. See\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.

Congress placed \u00a71519 (and its com-\npanion provision \u00a71520) at the end of the chapter, follow-\ning immediately after the pre-existing \u00a71516, \u00a71517, and\n\u00a71518, each of them prohibiting obstructive acts in specific\ncontexts. See \u00a71516 (audits of recipients of federal funds);\n\u00a71517 (federal examinations of financial institutions);\n\u00a71518 (criminal investigations of federal health care of-\nfenses).

Instead, Congress directed place-\nment of those additions within or alongside retained pro-\nvisions that address obstructive acts relating broadly to\nofficial proceedings and criminal trials: Section 806, \u201cCivil\nAction to protect against retaliation in fraud cases,\u201d was\ncodified as \u00a71514A and inserted between the pre-existing\n\u00a71514, which addresses civil actions to restrain harass-\nment of victims and witnesses in criminal cases, and\n\u00a71515, which defines terms used in \u00a71512 and \u00a71513.\nSection 1102, \u201cTampering with a record or otherwise\nimpeding an official proceeding,\u201d was codified as \u00a71512(c)\nand inserted within the pre-existing \u00a71512, which ad-\ndresses tampering with a victim, witness, or informant to\nimpede any official proceeding. Section 1107, \u201cRetaliation\nagainst informants,\u201d was codified as \u00a71513(e) and inserted\nwithin the pre-existing \u00a71513, which addresses retaliation\nagainst a victim, witness, or informant in any official\nproceeding. Congress thus ranked \u00a71519, not among the\nbroad proscriptions, but together with specialized provi-\nsions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial\naudits. This placement accords with the view that Con-\ngress\u2019 conception of \u00a71519\u2019s coverage was considerably\n12                   YATES v.

See 148 Cong. Rec. 12518,\n13088\u201313089 (2002). The Government argues, and Yates\ndoes not dispute, that \u00a71512(c)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cother\nobject\u201d includes any and every physical object. But if\n\u00a71519\u2019s reference to \u201ctangible object\u201d already included all\nphysical objects, as the Government and the dissent con-\ntend, then Congress had no reason to enact \u00a71512(c)(1):\nVirtually any act that would violate \u00a71512(c)(1) no doubt\nwould violate \u00a71519 as well, for \u00a71519 applies to \u201cthe\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent contends that nothing can be drawn from the placement\n\nof \u00a71519 because, before and after Sarbanes-Oxley, \u201call of Chapter 73\nwas ordered chronologically.\u201d Post, at 9. The argument might have\nsome force if the factual premise were correct. In Sarbanes-Oxley,\nCongress directed insertion of \u00a71514A before \u00a71518, then the last\nsection in Chapter 73. If, as the dissent argues, Congress adopted\n\u00a71519 to fill out \u00a71512, post, at 6\u20137, it would have made more sense for\nCongress to codify the substance of \u00a71519 within \u00a71512 or in a new\n\u00a71512A, rather than placing \u00a71519 among specialized provisions.\nNotably, in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress added \u00a71512(c)(1), \u201ca broad ban\non evidence-spoliation,\u201d cf. post, at 9, n. 2, to \u00a71512, even though\n\u00a71512\u2019s preexisting title and provisions all related to witness-\ntampering.\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

In Gustafson, we interpreted the word\n\u201ccommunication\u201d in \u00a72(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 to\nrefer to a public communication, rather than any commu-\nnication, because the word appeared in a list with other\nwords, notably \u201cnotice, circular, [and] advertisement,\u201d\nmaking it \u201capparent that the list refer[red] to documents\nof wide dissemination.\u201d 513 U.

That contempora-\nneous omission also suggests that Congress intended\n\u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519 to have a narrower scope than\n\u201cother object\u201d in \u00a71512(c)(1).7\n  A canon related to noscitur a sociis, ejusdem generis,\ncounsels: \u201cWhere general words follow specific words in a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The dissent contends that \u201crecord, document, or tangible object\u201d in\n\u00a71519 should be construed in conformity with \u201crecord, document, or\nother object\u201d in \u00a71512(c)(1) because both provisions address \u201cthe same\nbasic problem.\u201d Post, at 11\u201312. But why should that be so when\nCongress prohibited in \u00a71519 additional actions, specific to paper and\nelectronic documents and records, actions it did not prohibit in\n\u00a71512(c)(1)? When Congress passed Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, courts\nhad already interpreted the phrase \u201calter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal\nan object\u201d in \u00a71512(b)(2)(B) to apply to all types of physical evidence.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Applewhaite, 195 F. 3d 679, 688 (CA3 1999)\n(affirming conviction under \u00a71512(b)(2)(B) for persuading another\nperson to paint over blood spatter). Congress\u2019 use of a formulation in\n\u00a71519 that did not track the one used in \u00a71512(b)(2)(B) (and repeated in\n\u00a71512(c)(1)) suggests that Congress designed \u00a71519 to be interpreted\napart from \u00a71512, not in lockstep with it.\n16                YATES v.

The enumeration of specific crimes, we\nexplained, indicates that the \u201cotherwise involves\u201d provi-\nsion covers \u201conly similar crimes, rather than every crime\nthat \u2018presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.\u2019 \u201d 553 U.

S. 277, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16) (\u201cWe\ntypically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general\nword will not render specific words meaningless.\u201d). Just\nso here. Had Congress intended \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519\nto be interpreted so generically as to capture physical\nobjects as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress\nwould have had no reason to refer specifically to \u201crecord\u201d\nor \u201cdocument.\u201d The Government\u2019s unbounded reading of\n\u201ctangible object\u201d would render those words misleading\nsurplusage.\n   Having used traditional tools of statutory interpretation\nto examine markers of congressional intent within the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and \u00a71519 itself, we are persuaded\nthat an aggressive interpretation of \u201ctangible object\u201d must\nbe rejected. It is highly improbable that Congress would\nhave buried a general spoliation statute covering objects of\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

The MPC provision and pro-\nposals prompted by it would have imposed liability on\nanyone who \u201calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, or re-\nmoves a record, document or thing.\u201d See ALI, MPC\n\u00a7241.7(1), p. 175 (1962). Those proscriptions were under-\nstood to refer to all physical evidence. See MPC \u00a7241.7,\nComment 3, at 179 (1980) (provision \u201capplies to any physi-\ncal object\u201d). Accordingly, the Government reasons, and\nthe dissent exuberantly agrees, post, at 4\u20135, Congress\nmust have intended \u00a71519 to apply to the universe of\nphysical evidence.\n   The inference is unwarranted. True, the 1962 MPC\nprovision prohibited tampering with any kind of physical\nevidence. But unlike \u00a71519, the MPC provision did not\nprohibit actions that specifically relate to records, docu-\nments, and objects used to record or preserve information.\nThe MPC provision also ranked the offense as a misde-\nmeanor and limited liability to instances in which the\nactor \u201cbeliev[es] that an official proceeding or investigation\nis pending or about to be instituted.\u201d MPC \u00a7241.7(1), at\n175. Yates would have had scant reason to anticipate a\nfelony prosecution, and certainly not one instituted at a\ntime when even the smallest of the fish he caught came\nwithin the legal limit. See supra, at 4; cf. Bond v. United\nStates, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014), (slip op., at 14) (rejecting\n\u201cboundless reading\u201d of a statutory term given \u201cdeeply\nserious consequences\u201d that reading would entail). A pro-\nposed federal offense in line with the MPC provision,\nadvanced by a federal commission in 1971, was similarly\n18                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nqualified. See Final Report of the National Commission\non Reform of Federal Criminal Laws \u00a71323, pp. 116\u2013117\n(1971).\n   Section 1519 conspicuously lacks the limits built into\nthe MPC provision and the federal proposal. It describes\nnot a misdemeanor, but a felony punishable by up to 20\nyears in prison. And the section covers conduct intended\nto impede any federal investigation or proceeding, includ-\ning one not even on the verge of commencement. Given\nthese significant differences, the meaning of \u201crecord,\ndocument, or thing\u201d in the MPC provision and a kindred\nproposal is not a reliable indicator of the meaning Con-\ngress assigned to \u201crecord, document, or tangible object\u201d in\n\u00a71519. The MPC provision, in short, tells us neither \u201cwhat\nCongress wrote [nor] what Congress wanted,\u201d cf. post, at\n15, concerning Yates\u2019s small fish as the subject of a federal\nfelony prosecution.\n                             C\n  Finally, if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction leaves any doubt about the meaning of \u201ctan-\ngible object,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a71519, we would\ninvoke the rule that \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of\ncriminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000) (quot-\ning Rewis v. United States, 401 U. S. 808, 812 (1971)).\nThat interpretative principle is relevant here, where the\nGovernment urges a reading of \u00a71519 that exposes indi-\nviduals to 20-year prison sentences for tampering with any\nphysical object that might have evidentiary value in any\nfederal investigation into any offense, no matter whether\nthe investigation is pending or merely contemplated, or\nwhether the offense subject to investigation is criminal or\ncivil. See Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 427\n(1985) (\u201cApplication of the rule of lenity ensures that\ncriminal statutes will provide fair warning concerning\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

In determining the mean-\ning of \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519, \u201cit is appropriate, before\nwe choose the harsher alternative, to require that Con-\ngress should have spoken in language that is clear and\ndefinite.\u201d See Cleveland, 531 U.

And though the question is close, traditional\ntools of statutory construction confirm that John Yates has\nthe better of the argument. Three features of 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71519 stand out to me: the statute\u2019s list of nouns, its list of\nverbs, and its title. Although perhaps none of these fea-\ntures by itself would tip the case in favor of Yates, the\nthree combined do so.\n   Start with the nouns. Section 1519 refers to \u201cany rec-\nord, document, or tangible object.\u201d The noscitur a sociis\ncanon instructs that when a statute contains a list, each\nword in that list presumptively has a \u201csimilar\u201d meaning.\nSee, e.g., Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 576\n(1995). A related canon, ejusdem generis teaches that\ngeneral words following a list of specific words should\nusually be read in light of those specific words to mean\nsomething \u201csimilar.\u201d See, e.g., Christopher v. SmithKline\nBeecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 18).\nApplying these canons to \u00a71519\u2019s list of nouns, the term\n\u201ctangible object\u201d should refer to something similar to\nrecords or documents. A fish does not spring to mind\u2014nor\ndoes an antelope, a colonial farmhouse, a hydrofoil, or an\noil derrick. All are \u201cobjects\u201d that are \u201ctangible.\u201d But who\nwouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow if a neighbor, when asked to\nidentify something similar to a \u201crecord\u201d or \u201cdocument,\u201d\n2                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsaid \u201ccrocodile\u201d?\n   This reading, of course, has its shortcomings. For in-\nstance, this is an imperfect ejusdem generis case because\n\u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument\u201d are themselves quite general.\nAnd there is a risk that \u201ctangible object\u201d may be made\nsuperfluous\u2014what is similar to a \u201crecord\u201d or \u201cdocument\u201d\nbut yet is not one? An e-mail, however, could be such a\nthing. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guide-\nlines Manual \u00a72J1.2 and comment. (Nov. 2003) (reading\n\u201crecords, documents, or tangible objects\u201d to \u201cinclud[e]\u201d what\nis found on \u201cmagnetic, optical, digital, other electronic,\nor other storage mediums or devices\u201d). An e-mail, after\nall, might not be a \u201cdocument\u201d if, as was \u201ctraditionally\u201d so,\na document was a \u201cpiece of paper with information on it,\u201d\nnot \u201cinformation stored on a computer, electronic storage\ndevice, or any other medium.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n587\u2013588 (10th ed. 2014). E-mails might also not be \u201crec-\nords\u201d if records are limited to \u201cminutes\u201d or other formal\nwritings \u201cdesigned to memorialize [past] events.\u201d Id., at\n1465. A hard drive, however, is tangible and can contain\nfiles that are precisely akin to even these narrow defini-\ntions. Both \u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument\u201d can be read more\nexpansively, but adding \u201ctangible object\u201d to \u00a71519 would\nensure beyond question that electronic files are included.\nTo be sure, \u201ctangible object\u201d presumably can capture more\nthan just e-mails; Congress enacts \u201ccatchall[s]\u201d for \u201cknown\nunknowns.\u201d Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. 848, 860\n(2009). But where noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\napply, \u201cknown unknowns\u201d should be similar to known\nknowns, i.e., here, records and documents. This is espe-\ncially true because reading \u201ctangible object\u201d too broadly\ncould render \u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument\u201d superfluous.\n   Next, consider \u00a71519\u2019s list of verbs: \u201calters, destroys,\nmutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false\nentry in.\u201d Although many of those verbs could apply to\nnouns as far-flung as salamanders, satellites, or sand\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndunes, the last phrase in the list\u2014\u201cmakes a false entry\nin\u201d\u2014makes no sense outside of filekeeping. How does one\nmake a false entry in a fish? \u201cAlters\u201d and especially \u201cfalsi-\nfies\u201d are also closely associated with filekeeping. Not one\nof the verbs, moreover, cannot be applied to filekeeping\u2014\ncertainly not in the way that \u201cmakes a false entry in\u201d is\nalways inconsistent with the aquatic.\n   Again, the Government is not without a response. One\ncan imagine Congress trying to write a law so broadly that\nnot every verb lines up with every noun. But failure to\n\u201cline up\u201d may suggest that something has gone awry in\none\u2019s interpretation of a text. Where, as here, each of a\nstatute\u2019s verbs applies to a certain category of nouns, there\nis some reason to think that Congress had that category in\nmind. Categories, of course, are often underinclusive or\noverinclusive\u2014\u00a71519, for instance, applies to a bomb-\nthreatening letter but not a bomb. But this does not mean\nthat categories are not useful or that Congress does not\nenact them. See, e.g., Vance v. Bradley, 440 U. S. 93, 108\u2013\n109 (1979). Here, focusing on the verbs, the category of\nnouns appears to be filekeeping. This observation is not\ndispositive, but neither is it nothing. The Government\nalso contends that \u00a71519\u2019s verbs cut both ways because it\nis unnatural to apply \u201cfalsifies\u201d to tangible objects, and\nthat is certainly true. One does not falsify the outside\ncasing of a hard drive, but one could falsify or alter data\nphysically recorded on that hard drive.\n   Finally, my analysis is influenced by \u00a71519\u2019s title: \u201cDe-\nstruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal\ninvestigations and bankruptcy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This\ntoo points toward filekeeping, not fish. Titles can be use-\nful devices to resolve \u201c \u2018doubt about the meaning of a stat-\nute.\u2019 \u201d Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 527\u2013528 (2002)\n(quoting Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S.\n224, 234 (1998)); see also Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U.

The title is especially valuable here because it\nreinforces what the text\u2019s nouns and verbs independently\nsuggest\u2014that no matter how other statutes might be read,\nthis particular one does not cover every noun in the uni-\nverse with tangible form.\n   Titles, of course, are also not dispositive. Here, if the\nlist of nouns did not already suggest that \u201ctangible object\u201d\nshould mean something similar to records or documents,\nespecially when read in conjunction with \u00a71519\u2019s peculiar\nlist of verbs with their focus on filekeeping, then the title\nwould not be enough on its own. In conjunction with those\nother two textual features, however, the Government\u2019s\nargument, though colorable, becomes too implausible to\naccept.

S. C. \u00a71519, prohibits tampering\nwith \u201cany record, document, or tangible object\u201d in an\nattempt to obstruct a federal investigation. This case\nraises the question whether the term \u201ctangible object\u201d\nmeans the same thing in \u00a71519 as it means in everyday\nlanguage\u2014any object capable of being touched. The an-\nswer should be easy: Yes. The term \u201ctangible object\u201d is\nbroad, but clear. Throughout the U. S. Code and many\nStates\u2019 laws, it invariably covers physical objects of all\nkinds. And in \u00a71519, context confirms what bare text\nsays: All the words surrounding \u201ctangible object\u201d show\nthat Congress meant the term to have a wide range. That\nfits with Congress\u2019s evident purpose in enacting \u00a71519: to\npunish those who alter or destroy physical evidence\u2014any\nphysical evidence\u2014with the intent of thwarting federal\nlaw enforcement.\n   The plurality instead interprets \u201ctangible object\u201d to\ncover \u201conly objects one can use to record or preserve in-\nformation.\u201d Ante, at 7. The concurring opinion similarly,\nif more vaguely, contends that \u201ctangible object\u201d should\nrefer to \u201csomething similar to records or documents\u201d\u2014and\nshouldn\u2019t include colonial farmhouses, crocodiles, or fish.\nAnte, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). In my view,\nconventional tools of statutory construction all lead to a\n2                      YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmore conventional result: A \u201ctangible object\u201d is an object\nthat\u2019s tangible. I would apply the statute that Congress\nenacted and affirm the judgment below.\n                               I\n   While the plurality starts its analysis with \u00a71519\u2019s\nheading, see ante, at 10 (\u201cWe note first \u00a71519\u2019s caption\u201d), I\nwould begin with \u00a71519\u2019s text. When Congress has not\nsupplied a definition, we generally give a statutory term\nits ordinary meaning. See, e.g., Schindler Elevator Corp.\nv. United States ex rel. Kirk, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 5). As the plurality must acknowledge, the ordi-\nnary meaning of \u201ctangible object\u201d is \u201ca discrete thing that\npossesses physical form.\u201d Ante, at 7 (punctuation and\ncitation omitted). A fish is, of course, a discrete thing that\npossesses physical form. See generally Dr. Seuss, One\nFish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (1960). So the ordinary\nmeaning of the term \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519, as no\none here disputes, covers fish (including too-small red\ngrouper).\n   That interpretation accords with endless uses of the\nterm in statute and rule books as construed by courts.\nDozens of federal laws and rules of procedure (and hun-\ndreds of state enactments) include the term \u201ctangible\nobject\u201d or its first cousin \u201ctangible thing\u201d\u2014some in associ-\nation with documents, others not. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C.\n\u00a78302(2) (referring to \u201cany material or tangible object that\ncould harbor a pest or disease\u201d); 15 U. S. C. \u00a757b\u20131(c)\n(authorizing investigative demands for \u201cdocumentary\nmaterial or tangible things\u201d); 18 U. S.

C. \u00a72507(b)\n(allowing discovery of \u201crelevant facts, books, papers, doc-\numents or tangible things\u201d).1 To my knowledge, no court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 From   Alabama and Alaska through Wisconsin and Wyoming (and\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

For example, courts have understood the\nphrases \u201ctangible objects\u201d and \u201ctangible things\u201d in the\nFederal Rules of Criminal and Civil Procedure to cover\neverything from guns to drugs to machinery to . . . ani-\nmals. See, e.g., United States v. Obiukwu, 17 F. 3d 816,\n819 (CA6 1994) (per curiam) (handgun); United States v.\nAcarino, 270 F. Supp. 526, 527\u2013528 (EDNY 1967) (heroin);\nIn re Newman, 782 F. 2d 971, 972\u2013975 (CA Fed. 1986)\n(energy generation system); Martin v. Reynolds Metals\nCorp., 297 F. 2d 49, 56\u201357 (CA9 1961) (cattle). No sur-\nprise, then, that\u2014until today\u2014courts have uniformly\napplied the term \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519 in the same\nway. See, e.g., United States v. McRae, 702 F. 3d 806,\n834\u2013838 (CA5 2012) (corpse); United States v. Maury, 695\nF. 3d 227, 243\u2013244 (CA3 2012) (cement mixer).\n  That is not necessarily the end of the matter; I agree\nwith the plurality (really, who does not?) that context\nmatters in interpreting statutes. We do not \u201cconstrue the\nmeaning of statutory terms in a vacuum.\u201d Tyler v. Cain,\n533 U. S. 656, 662 (2001). Rather, we interpret particular\nwords \u201cin their context and with a view to their place in\nthe overall statutory scheme.\u201d Davis v. Michigan Dept. of\nTreasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989). And sometimes that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntrust me\u2014in all that come between), States similarly use the terms\n\u201ctangible objects\u201d and \u201ctangible things\u201d in statutes and rules of all\nsorts. See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a734\u201317\u20131(3) (2010) (defining \u201clandscape\narchitecture\u201d to include the design of certain \u201ctangible objects and\nfeatures\u201d); Alaska Rule Civ. Proc. 34(a)(1) (2014) (allowing litigants to\n\u201cinspect, copy, test, or sample any tangible things\u201d that constitute or\ncontain discoverable material); Wis. Stat. \u00a7804.09(1) (2014) (requiring\nthe production of \u201cdesignated tangible things\u201d in civil proceedings);\nWyo. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(h) (2014) (defining \u201cproperty\u201d for purposes of\na search-and-seizure statute to include \u201cdocuments, books, papers and\nany other tangible objects\u201d).\n4                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmeans, as the plurality says, that the dictionary definition\nof a disputed term cannot control. See, e.g., Bloate v.\nUnited States, 559 U. S. 196, 205, n. 9 (2010). But this is\nnot such an occasion, for here the text and its context\npoint the same way. Stepping back from the words \u201ctan-\ngible object\u201d provides only further evidence that Congress\nsaid what it meant and meant what it said.\n  Begin with the way the surrounding words in \u00a71519\nreinforce the breadth of the term at issue. Section 1519\nrefers to \u201cany\u201d tangible object, thus indicating (in line with\nthat word\u2019s plain meaning) a tangible object \u201cof whatever\nkind.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 97\n(2002). This Court has time and again recognized that\n\u201cany\u201d has \u201can expansive meaning,\u201d bringing within a\nstatute\u2019s reach all types of the item (here, \u201ctangible ob-\nject\u201d) to which the law refers. Department of Housing and\nUrban Development v. Rucker, 535 U. S. 125, 131 (2002);\nsee, e.g., Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. 848, 856\n(2009); Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214,\n219\u2013220 (2008). And the adjacent laundry list of verbs in\n\u00a71519 (\u201calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up,\nfalsifies, or makes a false entry\u201d) further shows that Con-\ngress wrote a statute with a wide scope. Those words are\nsupposed to ensure\u2014just as \u201ctangible object\u201d is meant to\u2014\nthat \u00a71519 covers the whole world of evidence-tampering,\nin all its prodigious variety. See United States v. Rodgers,\n466 U. S. 475, 480 (1984) (rejecting a \u201cnarrow, technical\ndefinition\u201d of a statutory term when it \u201cclashes strongly\u201d\nwith \u201csweeping\u201d language in the same sentence).\n  Still more, \u201ctangible object\u201d appears as part of a three-\nnoun phrase (including also \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d)\ncommon to evidence-tampering laws and always under-\nstood to embrace things of all kinds. The Model Penal\nCode\u2019s evidence-tampering section, drafted more than 50\nyears ago, similarly prohibits a person from \u201calter[ing],\ndestroy[ing], conceal[ing] or remov[ing] any record, docu-\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7241.7(1),\np. 175 (1962) (emphasis added). The Code\u2019s commentary\nemphasizes that the offense described in that provision is\n\u201cnot limited to conduct that [alters] a written instrument.\u201d\nId., \u00a7241.7, Comment 3, at 179. Rather, the language\nextends to \u201cany physical object.\u201d Ibid. Consistent with\nthat statement\u2014and, of course, with ordinary meaning\u2014\ncourts in the more than 15 States that have laws based on\nthe Model Code\u2019s tampering provision apply them to all\ntangible objects, including drugs, guns, vehicles and . . .\nyes, animals. See, e.g., State v. Majors, 318 S. W. 3d 850,\n859\u2013861 (Tenn. 2010) (cocaine); Puckett v. State, 328 Ark.\n355, 357\u2013360, 944 S. W. 2d 111, 113\u2013114 (1997) (gun);\nState v.

Not a one has limited the phrase\u2019s scope to\nobjects that record or preserve information.\n   The words \u201crecord, document, or tangible object\u201d in\n\u00a71519 also track language in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71512, the federal\nwitness-tampering law covering (as even the plurality\naccepts, see ante, at 12) physical evidence in all its forms.\nSection 1512, both in its original version (preceding \u00a71519)\nand today, repeatedly uses the phrase \u201crecord, document,\nor other object\u201d\u2014most notably, in a provision prohibiting\nthe use of force or threat to induce another person to\nwithhold any of those materials from an official proceed-\ning. \u00a74(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of\n1982, 96 Stat. 1249, as amended, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71512(b)(2).\nThat language, which itself likely derived from the Model\nPenal Code, encompasses no less the bloody knife than the\nincriminating letter, as all courts have for decades agreed.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Kellington, 217 F. 3d 1084, 1088\n(CA9 2000) (boat); United States v. Applewhaite, 195 F. 3d\n679, 688 (CA3 1999) (stone wall). And typically \u201conly the\n6                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmost compelling evidence\u201d will persuade this Court that\nCongress intended \u201cnearly identical language\u201d in provi-\nsions dealing with related subjects to bear different mean-\nings. Communication Workers v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735, 754\n(1988); see A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 252 (2012). Context thus\nagain confirms what text indicates.\n   And legislative history, for those who care about it, puts\nextra icing on a cake already frosted. Section 1519, as the\nplurality notes, see ante, at 2, 6, was enacted after the\nEnron Corporation\u2019s collapse, as part of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002, 116 Stat. 745. But the provision began\nits life in a separate bill, and the drafters emphasized that\nEnron was \u201conly a case study exposing the shortcomings\nin our current laws\u201d relating to both \u201ccorporate and crimi-\nnal\u201d fraud. S. Rep. No. 107\u2013146, pp. 2, 11 (2002). The\nprimary \u201cloophole[ ]\u201d Congress identified, see id., at 14,\narose from limits in the part of \u00a71512 just described: That\nprovision, as uniformly construed, prohibited a person\nfrom inducing another to destroy \u201crecord[s], document[s],\nor other object[s]\u201d\u2014of every type\u2014but not from doing so\nhimself. \u00a71512(b)(2); see supra, at 5. Congress (as even\nthe plurality agrees, see ante, at 6) enacted \u00a71519 to close\nthat yawning gap. But \u00a71519 could fully achieve that goal\nonly if it covered all the records, documents, and objects\n\u00a71512 did, as well as all the means of tampering with\nthem. And so \u00a71519 was written to do exactly that\u2014\u201cto\napply broadly to any acts to destroy or fabricate physical\nevidence,\u201d as long as performed with the requisite intent.\nS. Rep. No. 107\u2013146, at 14. \u201cWhen a person destroys\nevidence,\u201d the drafters explained, \u201coverly technical legal\ndistinctions should neither hinder nor prevent prosecu-\ntion.\u201d Id., at 7. Ah well: Congress, meet today\u2019s Court,\nwhich here invents just such a distinction with just such\nan effect. See United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank,\n374 U. S. 321, 343 (1963) (\u201c[C]reat[ing] a large loophole in\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)             7\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\na statute designed to close a loophole\u201d is \u201cillogical and\ndisrespectful of . . . congressional purpose\u201d).\n  As Congress recognized in using a broad term, giving\nimmunity to those who destroy non-documentary evidence\nhas no sensible basis in penal policy. A person who hides\na murder victim\u2019s body is no less culpable than one who\nburns the victim\u2019s diary. A fisherman, like John Yates,\nwho dumps undersized fish to avoid a fine is no less\nblameworthy than one who shreds his vessel\u2019s catch log\nfor the same reason. Congress thus treated both offenders\nin the same way. It understood, in enacting \u00a71519, that\ndestroying evidence is destroying evidence, whether or not\nthat evidence takes documentary form.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   The plurality searches far and wide for anything\u2014\nanything\u2014to support its interpretation of \u00a71519. But its\nfishing expedition comes up empty.\n   The plurality\u2019s analysis starts with \u00a71519\u2019s title: \u201cDe-\nstruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal\ninvestigations and bankruptcy.\u201d See ante, at 10; see also\nante, at 3\u20134 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That\u2019s already a sign\nsomething is amiss. I know of no other case in which we\nhave begun our interpretation of a statute with the title,\nor relied on a title to override the law\u2019s clear terms. In-\nstead, we have followed \u201cthe wise rule that the title of a\nstatute and the heading of a section cannot limit the plain\nmeaning of the text.\u201d Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio\nR. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528\u2013529 (1947).\n   The reason for that \u201cwise rule\u201d is easy to see: A title is,\nalmost necessarily, an abridgment. Attempting to men-\ntion every term in a statute \u201cwould often be ungainly as\nwell as useless\u201d; accordingly, \u201cmatters in the text . . . are\nfrequently unreflected in the headings.\u201d Id., at 528. Just\nlast year, this Court observed that two titles in a nearby\n8                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nsection of Sarbanes-Oxley serve as \u201cbut a short-hand\nreference to the general subject matter\u201d of the provision at\nissue, \u201cnot meant to take the place of the detailed provi-\nsions of the text.\u201d Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 16) (quoting Trainmen, 331 U. S., at\n528). The \u201cunder-inclusiveness\u201d of the headings, we stated,\nwas \u201capparent.\u201d Lawson, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n16). So too for \u00a71519\u2019s title, which refers to \u201cdestruction,\nalteration, or falsification\u201d but not to mutilation, conceal-\nment, or covering up, and likewise mentions \u201crecords\u201d but\nnot other documents or objects. Presumably, the plurality\nwould not refuse to apply \u00a71519 when a person only con-\nceals evidence rather than destroying, altering, or falsify-\ning it; instead, the plurality would say that a title is just a\ntitle, which cannot \u201cundo or limit\u201d more specific statutory\ntext. Ibid. (quoting Trainmen, 331 U. S., at 529). The\nsame holds true when the evidence in question is not a\n\u201crecord\u201d but something else whose destruction, alteration,\netc., is intended to obstruct justice.\n   The plurality next tries to divine meaning from \u00a71519\u2019s\n\u201cposition within Chapter 73 of Title 18.\u201d Ante, at 10. But\nthat move is yet odder than the last. As far as I can tell,\nthis Court has never once suggested that the section num-\nber assigned to a law bears upon its meaning. Cf. Scalia,\nsupra, at xi\u2013xvi (listing more than 50 interpretive princi-\nples and canons without mentioning the plurality\u2019s new\nnumber-in-the-Code theory). And even on its own terms,\nthe plurality\u2019s argument is hard to fathom. The plurality\nclaims that if \u00a71519 applied to objects generally, Congress\nwould not have placed it \u201cafter the pre-existing \u00a71516,\n\u00a71517, and \u00a71518\u201d because those are \u201cspecialized provi-\nsions.\u201d Ante, at 11. But search me if I can find a better\nplace for a broad ban on evidence-tampering. The plural-\nity seems to agree that the law properly goes in Chapter\n73\u2014the criminal code\u2019s chapter on \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d\nBut the provision does not logically fit into any of that\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)                     9\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nchapter\u2019s pre-existing sections. And with the first 18\nnumbers of the chapter already taken (starting with \u00a71501\nand continuing through \u00a71518), the law naturally took the\n19th place. That is standard operating procedure. Prior\nto the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all of Chapter 73 was\nordered chronologically: Section 1518 was later enacted\nthan \u00a71517, which was later enacted than \u00a71516, which\nwas . . . well, you get the idea. And after Sarbanes-Oxley,\nCongress has continued in the same vein. Section 1519 is\nthus right where you would expect it (as is the contempo-\nraneously passed \u00a71520)\u2014between \u00a71518 (added in 1996)\nand \u00a71521 (added in 2008).2\n  The plurality\u2019s third argument, relying on the surplus-\nage canon, at least invokes a known tool of statutory\nconstruction\u2014but it too comes to nothing. Says the plu-\nrality: If read naturally, \u00a71519 \u201cwould render superfluous\u201d\n\u00a71512(c)(1), which Congress passed \u201cas part of the same\nact.\u201d Ante, at 13. But that is not so: Although the two\nprovisions significantly overlap, each applies to conduct\nthe other does not. The key difference between the two is\nthat \u00a71519 protects the integrity of \u201cmatter[s] within the\njurisdiction of any [federal] department or agency\u201d whereas\n\u00a71512(c)(1) safeguards \u201cofficial proceeding[s]\u201d as defined\nin \u00a71515(a)(1)(A). Section 1519\u2019s language often applies\nmore broadly than \u00a71512(c)(1)\u2019s, as the plurality notes.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The lonesome exception to Chapter 73\u2019s chronological order is\n\n\u00a71514A, added in Sarbanes-Oxley to create a civil action to protect\nwhistleblowers. Congress decided to place that provision right after the\nonly other section in Chapter 73 to authorize a civil action (that one to\nprotect victims and witnesses). The plurality, seizing on the \u00a71514\nexample, says it likewise \u201cwould have made more sense for Congress to\ncodify the substance of \u00a71519 within \u00a71512 or in a new \u00a71512A.\u201d Ante,\nat 12, n. 4. But \u00a71512 is titled \u201cTampering with a witness, victim, or an\ninformant,\u201d and its provisions almost all protect witnesses from intimi-\ndation and harassment. It makes perfect sense that Congress wanted a\nbroad ban on evidence-spoliation to stand on its own rather than as\npart of\u2014or an appendage to\u2014a witness-tampering provision.\n10                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nFor example, an FBI investigation counts as a matter\nwithin a federal department\u2019s jurisdiction, but falls out-\nside the statutory definition of \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d as\nconstrued by courts. See, e.g., United States v. Gabriel,\n125 F. 3d 89, 105, n. 13 (CA2 1997). But conversely,\n\u00a71512(c)(1) sometimes reaches more widely than \u00a71519.\nFor example, because an \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d includes any\n\u201cproceeding before a judge or court of the United States,\u201d\n\u00a71512(c)(1) prohibits tampering with evidence in federal\nlitigation between private parties. See \u00a71515(a)(1)(A);\nUnited States v. Burge, 711 F. 3d 803, 808\u2013810 (CA7\n2013); United States v. Reich, 479 F. 3d 179, 185\u2013187 (CA2\n2007) (Sotomayor, J.). By contrast, \u00a71519 wouldn\u2019t ordi-\nnarily operate in that context because a federal court isn\u2019t\na \u201cdepartment or agency.\u201d See Hubbard v. United States,\n514 U. S. 695, 715 (1995).3 So the surplusage canon\ndoesn\u2019t come into play.4 Overlap\u2014even significant over-\nlap\u2014abounds in the criminal law. See Loughrin v. United\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The plurality\u2019s objection to this statement is difficult to understand.\n\nIt cannot take issue with Hubbard\u2019s holding that \u201ca federal court is\nneither a \u2018department\u2019 nor an \u2018agency\u2019 \u201d in a statute referring, just as\n\u00a71519 does, to \u201cany matter within the jurisdiction of any department or\nagency of the United States.\u201d 514 U. S., at 698, 715. So the plurality\nsuggests that the phrase \u201cin relation to . . . any such matter\u201d in \u00a71519\nsomehow changes Hubbard\u2019s result. See ante, at 12\u201313, and n. 5. But\nthat phrase still demands that evidence-tampering relate to a \u201cmatter\nwithin the jurisdiction of any department or agency\u201d\u2014excluding courts,\nas Hubbard commands. That is why the federal government, as far as\nI can tell, has never once brought a prosecution under \u00a71519 for\nevidence-tampering in litigation between private parties. It instead uses\n\u00a71512(c)(1) for that purpose.\n  4 Section 1512(c)(1) also applies more broadly than \u00a71519 in proceed-\n\nings relating to insurance regulation. The term \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d in\n\u00a71512(c)(1) is defined to include \u201cproceeding[s] involving the business of\ninsurance whose activities affect interstate commerce before any\ninsurance regulatory official or agency.\u201d \u00a71515(a)(1)(D). But \u00a71519\nwouldn\u2019t usually apply in that context because state, not federal,\nagencies handle most insurance regulation.\n                   Cite as: 574 U.

This Court has never thought that of such ordinary\nstuff surplusage is made. See ibid.; Connecticut Nat. Bank\nv. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992).\n   And the legislative history to which the plurality ap-\npeals, see ante, at 6, only cuts against it because those\nmaterials show that lawmakers knew that \u00a71519 and\n\u00a71512(c)(1) share much common ground. Minority Leader\nLott introduced the amendment that included \u00a71512(c)(1)\n(along with other criminal and corporate fraud provisions)\nlate in the legislative process, explaining that he did so at\nthe specific request of the President. See 148 Cong. Rec.\n12509, 12512 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Lott). Not only Lott\nbut several other Senators noted the overlap between the\nPresident\u2019s package and provisions already in the bill,\nmost notably \u00a71519. See id., at 12512 (remarks of Sen.\nLott); id., at 12513 (remarks of Sen. Biden); id., at 12517\n(remarks of Sens. Hatch and Gramm). The presence of\nboth \u00a71519 and \u00a71512(c)(1) in the final Act may have\nreflected belt-and-suspenders caution: If \u00a71519 contained\nsome flaw, \u00a71512(c)(1) would serve as a backstop. Or the\naddition of \u00a71512(c)(1) may have derived solely from legis-\nlators\u2019 wish \u201cto satisfy audiences other than courts\u201d\u2014that\nis, the President and his Justice Department. Gluck &\nBressman, Statutory Interpretation from the Inside, 65\nStan. L. Rev. 901, 935 (2013) (emphasis deleted). Which-\never the case, Congress\u2019s consciousness of overlap between\nthe two provisions removes any conceivable reason to cast\naside \u00a71519\u2019s ordinary meaning in service of preventing\nsome statutory repetition.\n   Indeed, the inclusion of \u00a71512(c)(1) in Sarbanes-Oxley\ncreates a far worse problem for the plurality\u2019s construction\nof \u00a71519 than for mine. Section 1512(c)(1) criminalizes the\ndestruction of any \u201crecord, document, or other object\u201d;\n\u00a71519 of any \u201crecord, document, or tangible object.\u201d On\nthe plurality\u2019s view, one \u201cobject\u201d is really an object, where-\n12                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nas the other is only an object that preserves or stores\ninformation. But \u201c[t]he normal rule of statutory construc-\ntion assumes that identical words used in different parts\nof the same act,\u201d passed at the same time, \u201care intended to\nhave the same meaning.\u201d Sorenson v. Secretary of Treas-\nury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And that is especially true when the different\nprovisions pertain to the same subject. See supra, at 5\u20136.\nThe plurality doesn\u2019t\u2014really, can\u2019t\u2014explain why it in-\nstead interprets the same words used in two provisions of\nthe same Act addressing the same basic problem to mean\nfundamentally different things.\n   Getting nowhere with surplusage, the plurality switches\ncanons, hoping that noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\nwill save it. See ante, at 13\u201316; see also ante, at 1\u20132 (opin-\nion of ALITO, J.). The first of those related canons advises\nthat words grouped in a list be given similar meanings.\nThe second counsels that a general term following specific\nwords embraces only things of a similar kind. According\nto the plurality, those Latin maxims change the English\nmeaning of \u201ctangible object\u201d to only things, like records\nand documents, \u201cused to record or preserve information.\u201d\nAnte, at 14.5 But understood as this Court always has, the\ncanons have no such transformative effect on the worka-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The plurality seeks support for this argument in the Sentencing\n\nCommission\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201crecords, documents, or\ntangible objects,\u201d ante, at 14, but to no avail. The plurality cites a note\nin the Commission\u2019s Manual clarifying that this phrase, as used in the\nSentencing Guidelines, \u201cincludes\u201d various electronic information,\ncommunications, and storage devices.           United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual \u00a72J1.2, comment., n. 1 (Nov. 2014)\n(USSG). But \u201cincludes\u201d (following its ordinary definition) \u201cis not\nexhaustive,\u201d as the Commission\u2019s commentary makes explicit. USSG\n\u00a71B1.1, comment., n. 2. Otherwise, the Commission\u2019s construction\nwouldn\u2019t encompass paper documents. All the note does is to make\nplain that \u201crecords, documents, or tangible objects\u201d embraces stuff\nrelating to the digital (as well as the material) world.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            13\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nday language Congress chose.\n   As an initial matter, this Court uses noscitur a sociis\nand ejusdem generis to resolve ambiguity, not create it.\nThose principles are \u201cuseful rule[s] of construction where\nwords are of obscure or doubtful meaning.\u201d Russell Motor\nCar Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 520 (1923). But\nwhen words have a clear definition, and all other contex-\ntual clues support that meaning, the canons cannot\nproperly defeat Congress\u2019s decision to draft broad legisla-\ntion. See, e.g., Ali, 552 U. S., at 227 (rejecting the invoca-\ntion of these canons as an \u201cattempt to create ambiguity\nwhere the statute\u2019s text and structure suggest none\u201d).\n   Anyway, assigning \u201ctangible object\u201d its ordinary mean-\ning comports with noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\nwhen applied, as they should be, with attention to \u00a71519\u2019s\nsubject and purpose. Those canons require identifying a\ncommon trait that links all the words in a statutory\nphrase. See, e.g., Graham County Soil and Water Conser-\nvation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. 280,\n289, n. 7 (2010); Ali, 552 U. S., at 224\u2013226. In responding\nto that demand, the plurality characterizes records and\ndocuments as things that preserve information\u2014and so\nthey are. But just as much, they are things that provide\ninformation, and thus potentially serve as evidence rele-\nvant to matters under review. And in a statute pertaining\nto obstruction of federal investigations, that evidentiary\nfunction comes to the fore. The destruction of records and\ndocuments prevents law enforcement agents from gather-\ning facts relevant to official inquiries. And so too does the\ndestruction of tangible objects\u2014of whatever kind. Whether\nthe item is a fisherman\u2019s ledger or an undersized fish,\nthrowing it overboard has the identical effect on the ad-\nministration of justice. See supra, at 7. For purposes of\n\u00a71519, records, documents, and (all) tangible objects are\ntherefore alike.\n   Indeed, even the plurality can\u2019t fully credit its nosci-\n14                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ntur/ejusdem argument. The same reasoning would apply\nto every law placing the word \u201cobject\u201d (or \u201cthing\u201d) after\n\u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument.\u201d But as noted earlier, such stat-\nutes are common: The phrase appears (among other places)\nin many state laws based on the Model Penal Code, as\nwell as in multiple provisions of \u00a71512. See supra, at 4\u20135.\nThe plurality accepts that in those laws \u201cobject\u201d means\nobject; its argument about superfluity positively depends\non giving \u00a71512(c)(1) that broader reading. See ante, at\n13, 16. What, then, is the difference here? The plurality\nproposes that some of those statutes describe less serious\noffenses than \u00a71519. See ante, at 17. How and why that\ndistinction affects application of the noscitur a sociis and\nejusdem generis canons is left obscure: Count it as\none more of the plurality\u2019s never-before-propounded,\nnot-readily-explained interpretive theories. See supra, at 7,\n8\u20139, 11\u201312. But in any event, that rationale cannot sup-\nport the plurality\u2019s willingness to give \u201cobject\u201d its natural\nmeaning in \u00a71512, which (like \u00a71519) sets out felonies\nwith penalties of up to 20 years. See \u00a7\u00a71512(a)(3)(C), (b),\n(c). The canons, in the plurality\u2019s interpretive world,\napparently switch on and off whenever convenient.\n   And the plurality\u2019s invocation of \u00a71519\u2019s verbs does\nnothing to buttress its canon-based argument. See ante,\nat 14\u201315; ante, at 2\u20133 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The plurality\nobserves that \u00a71519 prohibits \u201cfalsif[ying]\u201d or \u201cmak[ing] a\nfalse entry in\u201d a tangible object, and no one can do those\nthings to, say, a murder weapon (or a fish). Ante, at 14.\nBut of course someone can alter, destroy, mutilate, con-\nceal, or cover up such a tangible object, and \u00a71519 prohibits\nthose actions too. The Court has never before suggested\nthat all the verbs in a statute need to match up with all\nthe nouns. See Robers v. United States, 572 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 4) (\u201c[T]he law does not require legisla-\ntors to write extra language specifically exempting, phrase\nby phrase, applications in respect to which a portion of a\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)                    15\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nphrase is not needed\u201d). And for good reason. It is exactly\nwhen Congress sets out to draft a statute broadly\u2014to\ninclude every imaginable variation on a theme\u2014that such\nmismatches will arise. To respond by narrowing the law,\nas the plurality does, is thus to flout both what Congress\nwrote and what Congress wanted.\n   Finally, when all else fails, the plurality invokes the\nrule of lenity. See ante, at 18. But even in its most robust\nform, that rule only kicks in when, \u201cafter all legitimate\ntools of interpretation have been exhausted, \u2018a reasonable\ndoubt persists\u2019 regarding whether Congress has made the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct a federal crime.\u201d Abramski v. United\nStates, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 12) (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990)). No such doubt lingers here. The plural-\nity points to the breadth of \u00a71519, see ante, at 18, as\nthough breadth were equivalent to ambiguity. It is not.\nSection 1519 is very broad. It is also very clear. Every\ntraditional tool of statutory interpretation points in the\nsame direction, toward \u201cobject\u201d meaning object. Lenity\noffers no proper refuge from that straightforward (even\nthough capacious) construction.6\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 As part of its lenity argument, the plurality asserts that Yates did\n\nnot have \u201cfair warning\u201d that his conduct amounted to a felony. Ante, at\n18; see ante, at 17 (stating that \u201cYates would have had scant reason to\nanticipate a felony prosecution\u201d when throwing fish overboard). But\neven under the plurality\u2019s view, the dumping of fish is potentially a\nfederal felony\u2014just under \u00a71512(c)(1), rather than \u00a71519. See ante, at\n12\u201313. In any event, the plurality itself acknowledges that the ordi-\nnary meaning of \u00a71519 covers Yates\u2019s conduct, see ante, at 7: That\nprovision, no less than \u00a71512(c)(1), announces its broad scope in the\nclearest possible terms. And when an ordinary citizen seeks notice of a\nstatute\u2019s scope, he is more likely to focus on the plain text than (as the\nplurality would have it) on the section number, the superfluity princi-\nple, and the noscitur and ejusdem canons.\n16                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n   The concurring opinion is a shorter, vaguer version of\nthe plurality\u2019s. It relies primarily on the noscitur a sociis\nand ejusdem generis canons, tries to bolster them with\n\u00a71519\u2019s \u201clist of verbs,\u201d and concludes with the section\u2019s\ntitle. See supra, at 7\u20138, 12\u201313, 14\u201315 (addressing each of\nthose arguments). (Notably, even the concurrence puts no\nstock in the plurality\u2019s section-number and superfluity\nclaims.) From those familiar materials, the concurrence\narrives at the following definition: \u201c \u2018tangible object\u2019 should\nmean something similar to records or documents.\u201d Ante,\nat 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). In amplifying that purported\nguidance, the concurrence suggests applying the term\n\u201ctangible object\u201d in keeping with what \u201ca neighbor, when\nasked to identify something similar to record or docu-\nment,\u201d might answer. Ante, at 1. \u201c[W]ho wouldn\u2019t raise an\neyebrow,\u201d the concurrence wonders, if the neighbor said\n\u201ccrocodile\u201d? Ante, at 1\u20132. Courts sometimes say, when\nexplaining the Latin maxims, that the \u201cwords of a statute\nshould be interpreted consistent with their neighbors.\u201d\nSee, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 105 (2000).\nThe concurrence takes that expression literally.\n   But \u00a71519\u2019s meaning should not hinge on the odd game\nof Mad Libs the concurrence proposes. No one reading\n\u00a71519 needs to fill in a blank after the words \u201crecords\u201d and\n\u201cdocuments.\u201d That is because Congress, quite helpfully,\nalready did so\u2014adding the term \u201ctangible object.\u201d The\nissue in this case is what that term means. So if the con-\ncurrence wishes to ask its neighbor a question, I\u2019d recom-\nmend a more pertinent one: Do you think a fish (or, if the\nconcurrence prefers, a crocodile) is a \u201ctangible object\u201d? As\nto that query, \u201cwho wouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow\u201d if the\nneighbor said \u201cno\u201d?\n   In insisting on its different question, the concurrence\nneglects the proper function of catchall phrases like \u201cor\ntangible object.\u201d The reason Congress uses such terms is\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)                 17\n\n                        KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nprecisely to reach things that, in the concurrence\u2019s words,\n\u201cdo[ ] not spring to mind\u201d\u2014to my mind, to my neighbor\u2019s,\nor (most important) to Congress\u2019s. Ante, at 1 (opinion of\nALITO, J.). As this Court recently explained: \u201c[T]he whole\nvalue of a generally phrased residual [term] is that it\nserves as a catchall for matters not specifically contem-\nplated\u2014known unknowns.\u201d Beaty, 556 U. S., at 860.\nCongress realizes that in a game of free association with\n\u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument,\u201d it will never think of all the\nother things\u2014including crocodiles and fish\u2014whose de-\nstruction or alteration can (less frequently but just as\neffectively) thwart law enforcement. Cf. United States v.\nStubbs, 11 F. 3d 632, 637\u2013638 (CA6 1993) (dead crocodiles\nused as evidence to support smuggling conviction). And so\nCongress adds the general term \u201cor tangible object\u201d\u2014\nagain, exactly because such things \u201cdo[ ] not spring to\nmind.\u201d7\n   The concurrence suggests that the term \u201ctangible object\u201d\nserves not as a catchall for physical evidence but to \u201cen-\nsure beyond question\u201d that e-mails and other electronic\nfiles fall within \u00a71519\u2019s compass. Ante, at 2. But that\nclaim is eyebrow-raising in its own right. Would a Con-\ngress wishing to make certain that \u00a71519 applies to\ne-mails add the phrase \u201ctangible object\u201d (as opposed, say, to\n\u201celectronic communications\u201d)? Would a judge or jury\nmember predictably find that \u201ctangible object\u201d encom-\npasses something as virtual as e-mail (as compared, say,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The concurrence contends that when the noscitur and ejusdem can-\n\nons are in play, \u201c \u2018known unknowns\u2019 should be similar to known\nknowns, i.e., here, records and documents.\u201d Ante, at 2. But as noted\nabove, records and documents are similar to crocodiles and fish as far\nas \u00a71519 is concerned: All are potentially useful as evidence in an\ninvestigation. See supra, at 13. The concurrence never explains why\nthat similarity isn\u2019t the relevant one in a statute aimed at evidence-\ntampering.\n18               YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwith something as real as a fish)? If not (and the answer\nis not), then that term cannot function as a failsafe for\ne-mails.\n  The concurrence acknowledges that no one of its argu-\nments can carry the day; rather, it takes the Latin canons\nplus \u00a71519\u2019s verbs plus \u00a71519\u2019s title to \u201ctip the case\u201d for\nYates. Ante, at 1. But the sum total of three mistaken\narguments is . . . three mistaken arguments. They do not\nget better in the combining. And so the concurrence ends\nup right where the plurality does, except that the concur-\nrence, eschewing the rule of lenity, has nothing to fall\nback on.\n                              III\n   If none of the traditional tools of statutory interpreta-\ntion can produce today\u2019s result, then what accounts for it?\nThe plurality offers a clue when it emphasizes the dispro-\nportionate penalties \u00a71519 imposes if the law is read\nbroadly. See ante, at 17\u201318. Section 1519, the plurality\nobjects, would then \u201cexpose[ ] individuals to 20-year prison\nsentences for tampering with any physical object that\nmight have evidentiary value in any federal investigation\ninto any offense.\u201d Ante, at 18. That brings to the surface\nthe real issue: overcriminalization and excessive punish-\nment in the U. S. Code.\n   Now as to this statute, I think the plurality somewhat\u2014\nthough only somewhat\u2014exaggerates the matter. The\nplurality omits from its description of \u00a71519 the require-\nment that a person act \u201cknowingly\u201d and with \u201cthe intent to\nimpede, obstruct, or influence\u201d federal law enforcement.\nAnd in highlighting \u00a71519\u2019s maximum penalty, the plural-\nity glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum.\n(Let\u2019s not forget that Yates\u2019s sentence was not 20 years,\nbut 30 days.) Congress presumably enacts laws with high\nmaximums and no minimums when it thinks the prohibited\nconduct may run the gamut from major to minor. That\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

Most district judges, as Con-\ngress knows, will recognize differences between such cases\nand prosecutions like this one, and will try to make the\npunishment fit the crime. Still and all, I tend to think, for\nthe reasons the plurality gives, that \u00a71519 is a bad law\u2014\ntoo broad and undifferentiated, with too-high maximum\npenalties, which give prosecutors too much leverage and\nsentencers too much discretion. And I\u2019d go further: In\nthose ways, \u00a71519 is unfortunately not an outlier, but an\nemblem of a deeper pathology in the federal criminal code.\n   But whatever the wisdom or folly of \u00a71519, this Court\ndoes not get to rewrite the law. \u201cResolution of the pros\nand cons of whether a statute should sweep broadly or\nnarrowly is for Congress.\u201d Rodgers, 466 U.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 13\u20137451. Argued November 5, 2014\u2014Decided February 25, 2015\nWhile conducting an offshore inspection of a commercial fishing vessel\n in the Gulf of Mexico, a federal agent found that the ship\u2019s catch con-\n tained undersized red grouper, in violation of federal conservation\n regulations. The officer instructed the ship\u2019s captain, petitioner\n Yates, to keep the undersized fish segregated from the rest of the\n catch until the ship returned to port. After the officer departed,\n Yates instead told a crew member to throw the undersized fish over-\n board. For this offense, Yates was charged with destroying, conceal-\n ing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investiga-\n tion, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a71519. That section provides that a\n person may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years if he \u201cknowingly\n alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a\n false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent\n to impede, obstruct, or influence\u201d a federal investigation. At trial,\n Yates moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \u00a71519 charge. Point-\n ing to \u00a71519\u2019s origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\n a law designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial\n markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Yates argued\n that \u00a71519\u2019s reference to \u201ctangible object\u201d subsumes objects used to\n store information, such as computer hard drives, not fish. The Dis-\n trict Court denied Yates\u2019s motion, and a jury found him guilty of vio-\n lating \u00a71519. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction, conclud-\n ing that \u00a71519 applies to the destruction or concealment of fish\n because, as objects having physical form, fish fall within the diction-\n ary definition of \u201ctangible object.\u201d\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n733 F. 3d 1059, reversed and remanded.\n2                        YATES v.

Pp. 6\u2013\n    20.\n       (a) Although dictionary definitions of the words \u201ctangible\u201d and \u201cob-\n    ject\u201d bear consideration in determining the meaning of \u201ctangible ob-\n    ject\u201d in \u00a71519, they are not dispositive. Whether a statutory term is\n    unambiguous \u201cis determined [not only] by reference to the language\n    itself, [but also by] the specific context in which that language is\n    used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u201d Robinson v.\n    Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341. Identical language may convey\n    varying content when used in different statutes, sometimes even in\n    different provisions of the same statute. See, e.g., FAA v. Cooper, 566\n    U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) Familiar interpretive guides aid the construction of \u201ctangible\n    object.\u201d Though not commanding, \u00a71519\u2019s heading\u2014\u201cDestruction, al-\n    teration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and\n    bankruptcy\u201d\u2014conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spolia-\n    tion of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records.\n       Section 1519\u2019s position within Title 18, Chapter 73, further signals\n    that \u00a71519 was not intended to serve as a cross-the-board ban on the\n    destruction of physical evidence. Congress placed \u00a71519 at the end of\n    Chapter 73 following immediately after pre-existing specialized pro-\n    visions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits.\n       The contemporaneous passage of \u00a71512(c)(1), which prohibits a\n    person from \u201calter[ing], destroy[ing], mutilat[ing], or conceal[ing] a\n    record, document, or other object . . . with the intent to impair the ob-\n    ject\u2019s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding,\u201d is also\n    instructive. The Government argues that \u00a71512(c)(1)\u2019s reference to\n    \u201cother object\u201d includes any and every physical object. But if \u00a71519\u2019s\n    reference to \u201ctangible object\u201d already included all physical objects, as\n    the Government also contends, then Congress had no reason to enact\n    \u00a71512(c)(1). Section 1519 should not be read to render superfluous an\n    entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same Act. See\n    Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. ___, ___.\n       The words immediately surrounding \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519\u2014\n    \u201cfalsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or] document\u201d\u2014also\n    cabin the contextual meaning of that term.

This\n    moderate interpretation accords with the list of actions \u00a71519 pro-\n    scribes; the verbs \u201cfalsif[y]\u201d and \u201cmak[e] a false entry in\u201d typically\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

See\n  Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575.\n     Use of traditional tools of statutory interpretation to examine\n  markers of congressional intent within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and\n  \u00a71519 itself thus call for rejection of an aggressive interpretation of\n  \u201ctangible object.\u201d\n     Furthermore, the meaning of \u201crecord, document, or thing\u201d in a pro-\n  vision of the 1962 Model Penal Code (MPC) that has been interpreted\n  to prohibit tampering with any kind of physical evidence is not a reli-\n  able indicator of the meaning Congress assigned to \u201crecord, docu-\n  ment, or tangible object\u201d in \u00a71519. There are significant differences\n  between the offense described by the MPC provision and the offense\n  created by \u00a71519. Pp. 10\u201318.\n     (c) Finally, if recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction\n  leaves any doubt about the meaning of \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519, it\n  would be appropriate to invoke the rule of lenity. Pp. 18\u201319.\n     JUSTICE ALITO concluded that traditional rules of statutory con-\n  struction confirm that Yates has the better argument. Title 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a71519\u2019s list of nouns, list of verbs, and title, when combined,\n  tip the case in favor of Yates. Applying the canons noscitur a sociis\n  and ejusdem generis to the list of nouns\u2014\u201cany record, document, or\n  tangible object\u201d\u2014the term \u201ctangible object\u201d should refer to something\n  similar to records or documents. And while many of \u00a71519\u2019s verbs\u2014\n  \u201calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a\n  false entry in\u201d\u2014could apply to far-flung nouns such as salamanders\n  or sand dunes, the term \u201cmakes a false entry in\u201d makes no sense out-\n  side of filekeeping. Finally, \u00a71519\u2019s title\u2014\u201cDestruction, alteration, or\n  falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy\u201d\u2014\n  also points toward filekeeping rather than fish.

To\nprevent federal authorities from confirming that he had\nharvested undersized fish, Yates ordered a crew member\nto toss the suspect catch into the sea. For this offense, he\nwas charged with, and convicted of, violating 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71519, which provides:\n       \u201cWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates,\n    conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in\n    any record, document, or tangible object with the in-\n    tent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation\n    or proper administration of any matter within the ju-\n    risdiction of any department or agency of the United\n    States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to\n    or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be\n    fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20\n    years, or both.\u201d\nYates was also indicted and convicted under \u00a72232(a),\nwhich provides:\n2                 YATES v.

A fish is no doubt an\nobject that is tangible; fish can be seen, caught, and\nhandled, and a catch, as this case illustrates, is vulnerable\nto destruction. But it would cut \u00a71519 loose from its\nfinancial-fraud mooring to hold that it encompasses any\nand all objects, whatever their size or significance, de-\nstroyed with obstructive intent. Mindful that in Sarbanes-\nOxley, Congress trained its attention on corporate and\naccounting deception and cover-ups, we conclude that a\nmatching construction of \u00a71519 is in order: A tangible\nobject captured by \u00a71519, we hold, must be one used to\nrecord or preserve information.\n                            I\n  On August 23, 2007, the Miss Katie, a commercial fish-\ning boat, was six days into an expedition in the Gulf of\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nMexico. Her crew numbered three, including Yates, the\ncaptain. Engaged in a routine offshore patrol to inspect\nboth recreational and commercial vessels, Officer John\nJones of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Com-\nmission decided to board the Miss Katie to check on the\nvessel\u2019s compliance with fishing rules. Although the Miss\nKatie was far enough from the Florida coast to be in exclu-\nsively federal waters, she was nevertheless within Officer\nJones\u2019s jurisdiction. Because he had been deputized as a\nfederal agent by the National Marine Fisheries Service,\nOfficer Jones had authority to enforce federal, as well as\nstate, fishing laws.\n   Upon boarding the Miss Katie, Officer Jones noticed\nthree red grouper that appeared to be undersized hanging\nfrom a hook on the deck. At the time, federal conservation\nregulations required immediate release of red grouper less\nthan 20 inches long. 50 CFR \u00a7622.37(d)(2)(ii) (effective\nApril 2, 2007). Violation of those regulations is a civil\noffense punishable by a fine or fishing license suspension.\nSee 16 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71857(1)(A), (G), 1858(a), (g).\n   Suspecting that other undersized fish might be on\nboard, Officer Jones proceeded to inspect the ship\u2019s catch,\nsetting aside and measuring only fish that appeared to\nhim to be shorter than 20 inches. Officer Jones ultimately\ndetermined that 72 fish fell short of the 20-inch mark. A\nfellow officer recorded the length of each of the undersized\nfish on a catch measurement verification form. With few\nexceptions, the measured fish were between 19 and 20\ninches; three were less than 19 inches; none were less\nthan 18.75 inches. After separating the fish measuring\nbelow 20 inches from the rest of the catch by placing them\nin wooden crates, Officer Jones directed Yates to leave the\nfish, thus segregated, in the crates until the Miss Katie\nreturned to port. Before departing, Officer Jones issued\nYates a citation for possession of undersized fish.\n   Four days later, after the Miss Katie had docked in\n4                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nCortez, Florida, Officer Jones measured the fish contained\nin the wooden crates. This time, however, the measured\nfish, although still less than 20 inches, slightly exceeded\nthe lengths recorded on board. Jones surmised that the\nfish brought to port were not the same as those he had\ndetected during his initial inspection. Under questioning,\none of the crew members admitted that, at Yates\u2019s direc-\ntion, he had thrown overboard the fish Officer Jones had\nmeasured at sea, and that he and Yates had replaced the\ntossed grouper with fish from the rest of the catch.\n   For reasons not disclosed in the record before us, more\nthan 32 months passed before criminal charges were\nlodged against Yates. On May 5, 2010, he was indicted for\ndestroying property to prevent a federal seizure, in viola-\ntion of \u00a72232(a), and for destroying, concealing, and cover-\ning up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in\nviolation of \u00a71519.1 By the time of the indictment, the\nminimum legal length for Gulf red grouper had been\nlowered from 20 inches to 18 inches. See 50 CFR\n\u00a7622.37(d)(2)(iv) (effective May 18, 2009). No measured\nfish in Yates\u2019s catch fell below that limit. The record does\nnot reveal what civil penalty, if any, Yates received for his\npossession of fish undersized under the 2007 regulation.\nSee 16 U. S. C. \u00a71858(a).\n   Yates was tried on the criminal charges in August 2011.\nAt the end of the Government\u2019s case in chief, he moved for\na judgment of acquittal on the \u00a71519 charge. Pointing to\n\u00a71519\u2019s title and its origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act, Yates argued that the section sets forth \u201ca\ndocuments offense\u201d and that its reference to \u201ctangible\nobject[s]\u201d subsumes \u201ccomputer hard drives, logbooks, [and]\nthings of that nature,\u201d not fish.

App. 91. Section 2232(a), set out supra, at 1\u20132,\nfit that description. But \u00a71519, Yates insisted, did not.\n   The Government countered that a \u201ctangible object\u201d\nwithin \u00a71519\u2019s compass is \u201csimply something other than a\ndocument or record.\u201d App. 93. The trial judge expressed\nmisgivings about reading \u201ctangible object\u201d as broadly as\nthe Government urged: \u201cIsn\u2019t there a Latin phrase [about]\nconstruction of a statute . . . . The gist of it is . . . you take\na look at [a] line of words, and you interpret the words\nconsistently. So if you\u2019re talking about documents, and\nrecords, tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature\nof a document or a record, as opposed to a fish.\u201d Ibid. The\nfirst-instance judge nonetheless followed controlling Elev-\nenth Circuit precedent. While recognizing that \u00a71519 was\npassed as part of legislation targeting corporate fraud, the\nCourt of Appeals had instructed that \u201cthe broad language\nof \u00a71519 is not limited to corporate fraud cases, and \u2018Con-\ngress is free to pass laws with language covering areas\nwell beyond the particular crisis du jour that initially\nprompted legislative action.\u2019 \u201d       No. 2:10\u2013cr\u201366\u2013FtM\u2013\n29SPC (MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2011), App. 116 (quoting United\nStates v. Hunt, 526 F. 3d 739, 744 (CA11 2008)). Accord-\ningly, the trial court read \u201ctangible object\u201d as a term \u201cin-\ndependent\u201d of \u201crecord\u201d or \u201cdocument.\u201d App. 116. For\nviolating \u00a71519 and \u00a72232(a), the court sentenced Yates to\nimprisonment for 30 days, followed by supervised release\nfor three years. App. 118\u2013120.

Section 1519 cured a conspicuous omission by\nimposing liability on a person who destroys records him-\nself. See S. Rep.

Section 1519, he\nmaintains, targets not all manner of evidence, but records,\ndocuments, and tangible objects used to preserve them,\ne.g., computers, servers, and other media on which infor-\nmation is stored.\n   We agree with Yates and reject the Government\u2019s unre-\nstrained reading. \u201cTangible object\u201d in \u00a71519, we conclude,\nis better read to cover only objects one can use to record or\npreserve information, not all objects in the physical world.\n                              A\n   The ordinary meaning of an \u201cobject\u201d that is \u201ctangible,\u201d\nas stated in dictionary definitions, is \u201ca discrete . . . thing,\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1555\n(2002), that \u201cpossess[es] physical form,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dic-\ntionary 1683 (10th ed. 2014). From this premise, the\nGovernment concludes that \u201ctangible object,\u201d as that term\nappears in \u00a71519, covers the waterfront, including fish\nfrom the sea.\n   Whether a statutory term is unambiguous, however,\ndoes not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its compo-\nnent words. Rather, \u201c[t]he plainness or ambiguity of\nstatutory language is determined [not only] by reference to\nthe language itself, [but as well by] the specific context in\nwhich that language is used, and the broader context of\nthe statute as a whole.\u201d Robinson v.

That Rule requires the\nprosecution to grant a defendant\u2019s request to inspect\n\u201ctangible objects\u201d within the Government\u2019s control that\nhave utility for the defense. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n16(a)(1)(E).\n   Rule 16\u2019s reference to \u201ctangible objects\u201d has been inter-\npreted to include any physical evidence. See 5 W. LaFave,\nJ. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a720.3(g),\npp. 405\u2013406, and n. 120 (3d ed. 2007). Rule 16 is a discov-\nery rule designed to protect defendants by compelling the\nprosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material\nto the charges at issue. In that context, a comprehensive\nconstruction of \u201ctangible objects\u201d is fitting. In contrast,\n\u00a71519 is a penal provision that refers to \u201ctangible object\u201d\nnot in relation to a request for information relevant to a\nspecific court proceeding, but rather in relation to federal\ninvestigations or proceedings of every kind, including\nthose not yet begun.3 See Commissioner v. National Car-\nbide Corp., 167 F. 2d 304, 306 (CA2 1948) (Hand, J.)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The  dissent assiduously ignores all this, post, at 11\u201312, in insisting\nthat Congress wrote \u00a71519 to cover, along with shredded corporate\ndocuments, red grouper slightly smaller than the legal limit.\n  3 For the same reason, we do not think the meaning of \u201ctangible ob-\n\njects\u201d (or \u201ctangible things,\u201d see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)) in other\ndiscovery prescriptions cited by the Government leads to the conclusion\nthat \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519 encompasses any and all physical\nevidence existing on land or in the sea.\n10               YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n(\u201cwords are chameleons, which reflect the color of their\nenvironment\u201d). Just as the context of Rule 16 supports\ngiving \u201ctangible object\u201d a meaning as broad as its diction-\nary definition, the context of \u00a71519 tugs strongly in favor\nof a narrower reading.\n                              B\n   Familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the\nwords \u201ctangible object\u201d as they appear in \u00a71519.\n   We note first \u00a71519\u2019s caption: \u201cDestruction, alteration,\nor falsification of records in Federal investigations and\nbankruptcy.\u201d That heading conveys no suggestion that the\nsection prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evi-\ndence, however remote from records. Neither does the\ntitle of the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in which\n\u00a71519 was placed, \u00a7802: \u201cCriminal penalties for altering\ndocuments.\u201d 116 Stat. 800. Furthermore, \u00a71520, the only\nother provision passed as part of \u00a7802, is titled \u201cDestruc-\ntion of corporate audit records\u201d and addresses only that\nspecific subset of records and documents. While these\nheadings are not commanding, they supply cues that\nCongress did not intend \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519 to\nsweep within its reach physical objects of every kind,\nincluding things no one would describe as records, docu-\nments, or devices closely associated with them. See\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 234\n(1998) (\u201c[T]he title of a statute and the heading of a sec-\ntion are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about\nthe meaning of a statute.\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). If Congress indeed meant to make \u00a71519 an all-\nencompassing ban on the spoliation of evidence, as the\ndissent believes Congress did, one would have expected a\nclearer indication of that intent.\n   Section 1519\u2019s position within Chapter 73 of Title 18\nfurther signals that \u00a71519 was not intended to serve as a\ncross-the-board ban on the destruction of physical evi-\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Congress placed \u00a71519 (and its com-\npanion provision \u00a71520) at the end of the chapter, follow-\ning immediately after the pre-existing \u00a71516, \u00a71517, and\n\u00a71518, each of them prohibiting obstructive acts in specific\ncontexts. See \u00a71516 (audits of recipients of federal funds);\n\u00a71517 (federal examinations of financial institutions);\n\u00a71518 (criminal investigations of federal health care of-\nfenses).

Instead, Congress directed place-\nment of those additions within or alongside retained pro-\nvisions that address obstructive acts relating broadly to\nofficial proceedings and criminal trials: Section 806, \u201cCivil\nAction to protect against retaliation in fraud cases,\u201d was\ncodified as \u00a71514A and inserted between the pre-existing\n\u00a71514, which addresses civil actions to restrain harass-\nment of victims and witnesses in criminal cases, and\n\u00a71515, which defines terms used in \u00a71512 and \u00a71513.\nSection 1102, \u201cTampering with a record or otherwise\nimpeding an official proceeding,\u201d was codified as \u00a71512(c)\nand inserted within the pre-existing \u00a71512, which ad-\ndresses tampering with a victim, witness, or informant to\nimpede any official proceeding. Section 1107, \u201cRetaliation\nagainst informants,\u201d was codified as \u00a71513(e) and inserted\nwithin the pre-existing \u00a71513, which addresses retaliation\nagainst a victim, witness, or informant in any official\nproceeding. Congress thus ranked \u00a71519, not among the\nbroad proscriptions, but together with specialized provi-\nsions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial\naudits. This placement accords with the view that Con-\ngress\u2019 conception of \u00a71519\u2019s coverage was considerably\n12                   YATES v.

Section 1512(c)(1) provides:\n       \u201c(c) Whoever corruptly\u2014\n       \u201c(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record,\n    document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with\n    the intent to impair the object\u2019s integrity or availabil-\n    ity for use in an official proceeding\n         .            .           .           .          .\n    \u201cshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n    than 20 years, or both.\u201d\n\nThe legislative history reveals that \u00a71512(c)(1) was drafted\nand proposed after \u00a71519. See 148 Cong. Rec. 12518,\n13088\u201313089 (2002). The Government argues, and Yates\ndoes not dispute, that \u00a71512(c)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cother\nobject\u201d includes any and every physical object. But if\n\u00a71519\u2019s reference to \u201ctangible object\u201d already included all\nphysical objects, as the Government and the dissent con-\ntend, then Congress had no reason to enact \u00a71512(c)(1):\nVirtually any act that would violate \u00a71512(c)(1) no doubt\nwould violate \u00a71519 as well, for \u00a71519 applies to \u201cthe\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent contends that nothing can be drawn from the placement\n\nof \u00a71519 because, before and after Sarbanes-Oxley, \u201call of Chapter 73\nwas ordered chronologically.\u201d Post, at 9. The argument might have\nsome force if the factual premise were correct. In Sarbanes-Oxley,\nCongress directed insertion of \u00a71514A before \u00a71518, then the last\nsection in Chapter 73. If, as the dissent argues, Congress adopted\n\u00a71519 to fill out \u00a71512, post, at 6\u20137, it would have made more sense for\nCongress to codify the substance of \u00a71519 within \u00a71512 or in a new\n\u00a71512A, rather than placing \u00a71519 among specialized provisions.\nNotably, in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress added \u00a71512(c)(1), \u201ca broad ban\non evidence-spoliation,\u201d cf. post, at 9, n. 2, to \u00a71512, even though\n\u00a71512\u2019s preexisting title and provisions all related to witness-\ntampering.\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

In Gustafson, we interpreted the word\n\u201ccommunication\u201d in \u00a72(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 to\nrefer to a public communication, rather than any commu-\nnication, because the word appeared in a list with other\nwords, notably \u201cnotice, circular, [and] advertisement,\u201d\nmaking it \u201capparent that the list refer[red] to documents\nof wide dissemination.\u201d 513 U.

See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual \u00a72J1.2, comment., n. 1\n(Nov. 2014) (\u201c \u2018Records, documents, or tangible objects\u2019\nincludes (A) records, documents, or tangible objects that\nare stored on, or that are, magnetic, optical, digital, other\nelectronic, or other storage mediums or devices; and (B)\nwire or electronic communications.\u201d).\n   This moderate interpretation of \u201ctangible object\u201d accords\nwith the list of actions \u00a71519 proscribes.

That contempora-\nneous omission also suggests that Congress intended\n\u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519 to have a narrower scope than\n\u201cother object\u201d in \u00a71512(c)(1).7\n  A canon related to noscitur a sociis, ejusdem generis,\ncounsels: \u201cWhere general words follow specific words in a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The dissent contends that \u201crecord, document, or tangible object\u201d in\n\u00a71519 should be construed in conformity with \u201crecord, document, or\nother object\u201d in \u00a71512(c)(1) because both provisions address \u201cthe same\nbasic problem.\u201d Post, at 11\u201312. But why should that be so when\nCongress prohibited in \u00a71519 additional actions, specific to paper and\nelectronic documents and records, actions it did not prohibit in\n\u00a71512(c)(1)? When Congress passed Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, courts\nhad already interpreted the phrase \u201calter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal\nan object\u201d in \u00a71512(b)(2)(B) to apply to all types of physical evidence.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Applewhaite, 195 F. 3d 679, 688 (CA3 1999)\n(affirming conviction under \u00a71512(b)(2)(B) for persuading another\nperson to paint over blood spatter). Congress\u2019 use of a formulation in\n\u00a71519 that did not track the one used in \u00a71512(b)(2)(B) (and repeated in\n\u00a71512(c)(1)) suggests that Congress designed \u00a71519 to be interpreted\napart from \u00a71512, not in lockstep with it.\n16                YATES v.

The enumeration of specific crimes, we\nexplained, indicates that the \u201cotherwise involves\u201d provi-\nsion covers \u201conly similar crimes, rather than every crime\nthat \u2018presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.\u2019 \u201d 553 U.

Had Congress intended \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519\nto be interpreted so generically as to capture physical\nobjects as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress\nwould have had no reason to refer specifically to \u201crecord\u201d\nor \u201cdocument.\u201d The Government\u2019s unbounded reading of\n\u201ctangible object\u201d would render those words misleading\nsurplusage.\n   Having used traditional tools of statutory interpretation\nto examine markers of congressional intent within the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and \u00a71519 itself, we are persuaded\nthat an aggressive interpretation of \u201ctangible object\u201d must\nbe rejected.

The MPC provision and pro-\nposals prompted by it would have imposed liability on\nanyone who \u201calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, or re-\nmoves a record, document or thing.\u201d See ALI, MPC\n\u00a7241.7(1), p. 175 (1962). Those proscriptions were under-\nstood to refer to all physical evidence. See MPC \u00a7241.7,\nComment 3, at 179 (1980) (provision \u201capplies to any physi-\ncal object\u201d). Accordingly, the Government reasons, and\nthe dissent exuberantly agrees, post, at 4\u20135, Congress\nmust have intended \u00a71519 to apply to the universe of\nphysical evidence.\n   The inference is unwarranted. True, the 1962 MPC\nprovision prohibited tampering with any kind of physical\nevidence. But unlike \u00a71519, the MPC provision did not\nprohibit actions that specifically relate to records, docu-\nments, and objects used to record or preserve information.\nThe MPC provision also ranked the offense as a misde-\nmeanor and limited liability to instances in which the\nactor \u201cbeliev[es] that an official proceeding or investigation\nis pending or about to be instituted.\u201d MPC \u00a7241.7(1), at\n175. Yates would have had scant reason to anticipate a\nfelony prosecution, and certainly not one instituted at a\ntime when even the smallest of the fish he caught came\nwithin the legal limit. See supra, at 4; cf. Bond v. United\nStates, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014), (slip op., at 14) (rejecting\n\u201cboundless reading\u201d of a statutory term given \u201cdeeply\nserious consequences\u201d that reading would entail). A pro-\nposed federal offense in line with the MPC provision,\nadvanced by a federal commission in 1971, was similarly\n18                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nqualified. See Final Report of the National Commission\non Reform of Federal Criminal Laws \u00a71323, pp. 116\u2013117\n(1971).\n   Section 1519 conspicuously lacks the limits built into\nthe MPC provision and the federal proposal. It describes\nnot a misdemeanor, but a felony punishable by up to 20\nyears in prison. And the section covers conduct intended\nto impede any federal investigation or proceeding, includ-\ning one not even on the verge of commencement. Given\nthese significant differences, the meaning of \u201crecord,\ndocument, or thing\u201d in the MPC provision and a kindred\nproposal is not a reliable indicator of the meaning Con-\ngress assigned to \u201crecord, document, or tangible object\u201d in\n\u00a71519. The MPC provision, in short, tells us neither \u201cwhat\nCongress wrote [nor] what Congress wanted,\u201d cf. post, at\n15, concerning Yates\u2019s small fish as the subject of a federal\nfelony prosecution.\n                             C\n  Finally, if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction leaves any doubt about the meaning of \u201ctan-\ngible object,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a71519, we would\ninvoke the rule that \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of\ncriminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000) (quot-\ning Rewis v. United States, 401 U. S. 808, 812 (1971)).\nThat interpretative principle is relevant here, where the\nGovernment urges a reading of \u00a71519 that exposes indi-\nviduals to 20-year prison sentences for tampering with any\nphysical object that might have evidentiary value in any\nfederal investigation into any offense, no matter whether\nthe investigation is pending or merely contemplated, or\nwhether the offense subject to investigation is criminal or\ncivil. See Liparota v. United States, 471 U.

And though the question is close, traditional\ntools of statutory construction confirm that John Yates has\nthe better of the argument. Three features of 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71519 stand out to me: the statute\u2019s list of nouns, its list of\nverbs, and its title. Although perhaps none of these fea-\ntures by itself would tip the case in favor of Yates, the\nthree combined do so.\n   Start with the nouns. Section 1519 refers to \u201cany rec-\nord, document, or tangible object.\u201d The noscitur a sociis\ncanon instructs that when a statute contains a list, each\nword in that list presumptively has a \u201csimilar\u201d meaning.\nSee, e.g., Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 576\n(1995). A related canon, ejusdem generis teaches that\ngeneral words following a list of specific words should\nusually be read in light of those specific words to mean\nsomething \u201csimilar.\u201d See, e.g., Christopher v. SmithKline\nBeecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 18).\nApplying these canons to \u00a71519\u2019s list of nouns, the term\n\u201ctangible object\u201d should refer to something similar to\nrecords or documents. A fish does not spring to mind\u2014nor\ndoes an antelope, a colonial farmhouse, a hydrofoil, or an\noil derrick. All are \u201cobjects\u201d that are \u201ctangible.\u201d But who\nwouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow if a neighbor, when asked to\nidentify something similar to a \u201crecord\u201d or \u201cdocument,\u201d\n2                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsaid \u201ccrocodile\u201d?\n   This reading, of course, has its shortcomings. For in-\nstance, this is an imperfect ejusdem generis case because\n\u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument\u201d are themselves quite general.\nAnd there is a risk that \u201ctangible object\u201d may be made\nsuperfluous\u2014what is similar to a \u201crecord\u201d or \u201cdocument\u201d\nbut yet is not one? An e-mail, however, could be such a\nthing. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guide-\nlines Manual \u00a72J1.2 and comment. (Nov. 2003) (reading\n\u201crecords, documents, or tangible objects\u201d to \u201cinclud[e]\u201d what\nis found on \u201cmagnetic, optical, digital, other electronic,\nor other storage mediums or devices\u201d). An e-mail, after\nall, might not be a \u201cdocument\u201d if, as was \u201ctraditionally\u201d so,\na document was a \u201cpiece of paper with information on it,\u201d\nnot \u201cinformation stored on a computer, electronic storage\ndevice, or any other medium.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n587\u2013588 (10th ed. 2014). E-mails might also not be \u201crec-\nords\u201d if records are limited to \u201cminutes\u201d or other formal\nwritings \u201cdesigned to memorialize [past] events.\u201d Id., at\n1465. A hard drive, however, is tangible and can contain\nfiles that are precisely akin to even these narrow defini-\ntions. Both \u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument\u201d can be read more\nexpansively, but adding \u201ctangible object\u201d to \u00a71519 would\nensure beyond question that electronic files are included.\nTo be sure, \u201ctangible object\u201d presumably can capture more\nthan just e-mails; Congress enacts \u201ccatchall[s]\u201d for \u201cknown\nunknowns.\u201d Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. 848, 860\n(2009). But where noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\napply, \u201cknown unknowns\u201d should be similar to known\nknowns, i.e., here, records and documents. This is espe-\ncially true because reading \u201ctangible object\u201d too broadly\ncould render \u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument\u201d superfluous.\n   Next, consider \u00a71519\u2019s list of verbs: \u201calters, destroys,\nmutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false\nentry in.\u201d Although many of those verbs could apply to\nnouns as far-flung as salamanders, satellites, or sand\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndunes, the last phrase in the list\u2014\u201cmakes a false entry\nin\u201d\u2014makes no sense outside of filekeeping. How does one\nmake a false entry in a fish? \u201cAlters\u201d and especially \u201cfalsi-\nfies\u201d are also closely associated with filekeeping. Not one\nof the verbs, moreover, cannot be applied to filekeeping\u2014\ncertainly not in the way that \u201cmakes a false entry in\u201d is\nalways inconsistent with the aquatic.\n   Again, the Government is not without a response. One\ncan imagine Congress trying to write a law so broadly that\nnot every verb lines up with every noun. But failure to\n\u201cline up\u201d may suggest that something has gone awry in\none\u2019s interpretation of a text. Where, as here, each of a\nstatute\u2019s verbs applies to a certain category of nouns, there\nis some reason to think that Congress had that category in\nmind. Categories, of course, are often underinclusive or\noverinclusive\u2014\u00a71519, for instance, applies to a bomb-\nthreatening letter but not a bomb. But this does not mean\nthat categories are not useful or that Congress does not\nenact them. See, e.g., Vance v. Bradley, 440 U. S. 93, 108\u2013\n109 (1979). Here, focusing on the verbs, the category of\nnouns appears to be filekeeping. This observation is not\ndispositive, but neither is it nothing. The Government\nalso contends that \u00a71519\u2019s verbs cut both ways because it\nis unnatural to apply \u201cfalsifies\u201d to tangible objects, and\nthat is certainly true. One does not falsify the outside\ncasing of a hard drive, but one could falsify or alter data\nphysically recorded on that hard drive.\n   Finally, my analysis is influenced by \u00a71519\u2019s title: \u201cDe-\nstruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal\ninvestigations and bankruptcy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This\ntoo points toward filekeeping, not fish. Titles can be use-\nful devices to resolve \u201c \u2018doubt about the meaning of a stat-\nute.\u2019 \u201d Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 527\u2013528 (2002)\n(quoting Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S.\n224, 234 (1998)); see also Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U.

The title is especially valuable here because it\nreinforces what the text\u2019s nouns and verbs independently\nsuggest\u2014that no matter how other statutes might be read,\nthis particular one does not cover every noun in the uni-\nverse with tangible form.\n   Titles, of course, are also not dispositive. Here, if the\nlist of nouns did not already suggest that \u201ctangible object\u201d\nshould mean something similar to records or documents,\nespecially when read in conjunction with \u00a71519\u2019s peculiar\nlist of verbs with their focus on filekeeping, then the title\nwould not be enough on its own. In conjunction with those\nother two textual features, however, the Government\u2019s\nargument, though colorable, becomes too implausible to\naccept.

S. C. \u00a71519, prohibits tampering\nwith \u201cany record, document, or tangible object\u201d in an\nattempt to obstruct a federal investigation. This case\nraises the question whether the term \u201ctangible object\u201d\nmeans the same thing in \u00a71519 as it means in everyday\nlanguage\u2014any object capable of being touched. The an-\nswer should be easy: Yes. The term \u201ctangible object\u201d is\nbroad, but clear. Throughout the U. S. Code and many\nStates\u2019 laws, it invariably covers physical objects of all\nkinds. And in \u00a71519, context confirms what bare text\nsays: All the words surrounding \u201ctangible object\u201d show\nthat Congress meant the term to have a wide range. That\nfits with Congress\u2019s evident purpose in enacting \u00a71519: to\npunish those who alter or destroy physical evidence\u2014any\nphysical evidence\u2014with the intent of thwarting federal\nlaw enforcement.\n   The plurality instead interprets \u201ctangible object\u201d to\ncover \u201conly objects one can use to record or preserve in-\nformation.\u201d Ante, at 7. The concurring opinion similarly,\nif more vaguely, contends that \u201ctangible object\u201d should\nrefer to \u201csomething similar to records or documents\u201d\u2014and\nshouldn\u2019t include colonial farmhouses, crocodiles, or fish.\nAnte, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). In my view,\nconventional tools of statutory construction all lead to a\n2                      YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmore conventional result: A \u201ctangible object\u201d is an object\nthat\u2019s tangible. I would apply the statute that Congress\nenacted and affirm the judgment below.\n                               I\n   While the plurality starts its analysis with \u00a71519\u2019s\nheading, see ante, at 10 (\u201cWe note first \u00a71519\u2019s caption\u201d), I\nwould begin with \u00a71519\u2019s text. When Congress has not\nsupplied a definition, we generally give a statutory term\nits ordinary meaning. See, e.g., Schindler Elevator Corp.\nv. United States ex rel. Kirk, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 5). As the plurality must acknowledge, the ordi-\nnary meaning of \u201ctangible object\u201d is \u201ca discrete thing that\npossesses physical form.\u201d Ante, at 7 (punctuation and\ncitation omitted). A fish is, of course, a discrete thing that\npossesses physical form. See generally Dr. Seuss, One\nFish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (1960). So the ordinary\nmeaning of the term \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519, as no\none here disputes, covers fish (including too-small red\ngrouper).\n   That interpretation accords with endless uses of the\nterm in statute and rule books as construed by courts.\nDozens of federal laws and rules of procedure (and hun-\ndreds of state enactments) include the term \u201ctangible\nobject\u201d or its first cousin \u201ctangible thing\u201d\u2014some in associ-\nation with documents, others not. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C.\n\u00a78302(2) (referring to \u201cany material or tangible object that\ncould harbor a pest or disease\u201d); 15 U. S.

No sur-\nprise, then, that\u2014until today\u2014courts have uniformly\napplied the term \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519 in the same\nway. See, e.g., United States v.

We do not \u201cconstrue the\nmeaning of statutory terms in a vacuum.\u201d Tyler v. Cain,\n533 U. S. 656, 662 (2001). Rather, we interpret particular\nwords \u201cin their context and with a view to their place in\nthe overall statutory scheme.\u201d Davis v. Michigan Dept. of\nTreasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989). And sometimes that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntrust me\u2014in all that come between), States similarly use the terms\n\u201ctangible objects\u201d and \u201ctangible things\u201d in statutes and rules of all\nsorts. See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a734\u201317\u20131(3) (2010) (defining \u201clandscape\narchitecture\u201d to include the design of certain \u201ctangible objects and\nfeatures\u201d); Alaska Rule Civ.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmeans, as the plurality says, that the dictionary definition\nof a disputed term cannot control. See, e.g., Bloate v.\nUnited States, 559 U. S. 196, 205, n. 9 (2010). But this is\nnot such an occasion, for here the text and its context\npoint the same way. Stepping back from the words \u201ctan-\ngible object\u201d provides only further evidence that Congress\nsaid what it meant and meant what it said.\n  Begin with the way the surrounding words in \u00a71519\nreinforce the breadth of the term at issue. Section 1519\nrefers to \u201cany\u201d tangible object, thus indicating (in line with\nthat word\u2019s plain meaning) a tangible object \u201cof whatever\nkind.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 97\n(2002). This Court has time and again recognized that\n\u201cany\u201d has \u201can expansive meaning,\u201d bringing within a\nstatute\u2019s reach all types of the item (here, \u201ctangible ob-\nject\u201d) to which the law refers. Department of Housing and\nUrban Development v. Rucker, 535 U. S. 125, 131 (2002);\nsee, e.g., Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. 848, 856\n(2009); Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214,\n219\u2013220 (2008). And the adjacent laundry list of verbs in\n\u00a71519 (\u201calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up,\nfalsifies, or makes a false entry\u201d) further shows that Con-\ngress wrote a statute with a wide scope. Those words are\nsupposed to ensure\u2014just as \u201ctangible object\u201d is meant to\u2014\nthat \u00a71519 covers the whole world of evidence-tampering,\nin all its prodigious variety. See United States v. Rodgers,\n466 U. S. 475, 480 (1984) (rejecting a \u201cnarrow, technical\ndefinition\u201d of a statutory term when it \u201cclashes strongly\u201d\nwith \u201csweeping\u201d language in the same sentence).\n  Still more, \u201ctangible object\u201d appears as part of a three-\nnoun phrase (including also \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d)\ncommon to evidence-tampering laws and always under-\nstood to embrace things of all kinds. The Model Penal\nCode\u2019s evidence-tampering section, drafted more than 50\nyears ago, similarly prohibits a person from \u201calter[ing],\ndestroy[ing], conceal[ing] or remov[ing] any record, docu-\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7241.7(1),\np. 175 (1962) (emphasis added).

Consistent with\nthat statement\u2014and, of course, with ordinary meaning\u2014\ncourts in the more than 15 States that have laws based on\nthe Model Code\u2019s tampering provision apply them to all\ntangible objects, including drugs, guns, vehicles and . . .\nyes, animals.

Not a one has limited the phrase\u2019s scope to\nobjects that record or preserve information.\n   The words \u201crecord, document, or tangible object\u201d in\n\u00a71519 also track language in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71512, the federal\nwitness-tampering law covering (as even the plurality\naccepts, see ante, at 12) physical evidence in all its forms.\nSection 1512, both in its original version (preceding \u00a71519)\nand today, repeatedly uses the phrase \u201crecord, document,\nor other object\u201d\u2014most notably, in a provision prohibiting\nthe use of force or threat to induce another person to\nwithhold any of those materials from an official proceed-\ning. \u00a74(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of\n1982, 96 Stat. 1249, as amended, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71512(b)(2).\nThat language, which itself likely derived from the Model\nPenal Code, encompasses no less the bloody knife than the\nincriminating letter, as all courts have for decades agreed.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Kellington, 217 F. 3d 1084, 1088\n(CA9 2000) (boat); United States v. Applewhaite, 195 F. 3d\n679, 688 (CA3 1999) (stone wall). And typically \u201conly the\n6                 YATES v.

Communication Workers v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735, 754\n(1988); see A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 252 (2012). Context thus\nagain confirms what text indicates.\n   And legislative history, for those who care about it, puts\nextra icing on a cake already frosted. Section 1519, as the\nplurality notes, see ante, at 2, 6, was enacted after the\nEnron Corporation\u2019s collapse, as part of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002, 116 Stat. 745. But the provision began\nits life in a separate bill, and the drafters emphasized that\nEnron was \u201conly a case study exposing the shortcomings\nin our current laws\u201d relating to both \u201ccorporate and crimi-\nnal\u201d fraud. S. Rep. No. 107\u2013146, pp. 2, 11 (2002). The\nprimary \u201cloophole[ ]\u201d Congress identified, see id., at 14,\narose from limits in the part of \u00a71512 just described: That\nprovision, as uniformly construed, prohibited a person\nfrom inducing another to destroy \u201crecord[s], document[s],\nor other object[s]\u201d\u2014of every type\u2014but not from doing so\nhimself. \u00a71512(b)(2); see supra, at 5. Congress (as even\nthe plurality agrees, see ante, at 6) enacted \u00a71519 to close\nthat yawning gap. But \u00a71519 could fully achieve that goal\nonly if it covered all the records, documents, and objects\n\u00a71512 did, as well as all the means of tampering with\nthem. And so \u00a71519 was written to do exactly that\u2014\u201cto\napply broadly to any acts to destroy or fabricate physical\nevidence,\u201d as long as performed with the requisite intent.\nS. Rep. No. 107\u2013146, at 14. \u201cWhen a person destroys\nevidence,\u201d the drafters explained, \u201coverly technical legal\ndistinctions should neither hinder nor prevent prosecu-\ntion.\u201d Id., at 7. Ah well: Congress, meet today\u2019s Court,\nwhich here invents just such a distinction with just such\nan effect. See United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank,\n374 U.

A person who hides\na murder victim\u2019s body is no less culpable than one who\nburns the victim\u2019s diary. A fisherman, like John Yates,\nwho dumps undersized fish to avoid a fine is no less\nblameworthy than one who shreds his vessel\u2019s catch log\nfor the same reason. Congress thus treated both offenders\nin the same way. It understood, in enacting \u00a71519, that\ndestroying evidence is destroying evidence, whether or not\nthat evidence takes documentary form.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   The plurality searches far and wide for anything\u2014\nanything\u2014to support its interpretation of \u00a71519. But its\nfishing expedition comes up empty.\n   The plurality\u2019s analysis starts with \u00a71519\u2019s title: \u201cDe-\nstruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal\ninvestigations and bankruptcy.\u201d See ante, at 10; see also\nante, at 3\u20134 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That\u2019s already a sign\nsomething is amiss. I know of no other case in which we\nhave begun our interpretation of a statute with the title,\nor relied on a title to override the law\u2019s clear terms. In-\nstead, we have followed \u201cthe wise rule that the title of a\nstatute and the heading of a section cannot limit the plain\nmeaning of the text.\u201d Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio\nR. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528\u2013529 (1947).\n   The reason for that \u201cwise rule\u201d is easy to see: A title is,\nalmost necessarily, an abridgment. Attempting to men-\ntion every term in a statute \u201cwould often be ungainly as\nwell as useless\u201d; accordingly, \u201cmatters in the text . . . are\nfrequently unreflected in the headings.\u201d Id., at 528. Just\nlast year, this Court observed that two titles in a nearby\n8                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nsection of Sarbanes-Oxley serve as \u201cbut a short-hand\nreference to the general subject matter\u201d of the provision at\nissue, \u201cnot meant to take the place of the detailed provi-\nsions of the text.\u201d Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 16) (quoting Trainmen, 331 U. S., at\n528). The \u201cunder-inclusiveness\u201d of the headings, we stated,\nwas \u201capparent.\u201d Lawson, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n16). So too for \u00a71519\u2019s title, which refers to \u201cdestruction,\nalteration, or falsification\u201d but not to mutilation, conceal-\nment, or covering up, and likewise mentions \u201crecords\u201d but\nnot other documents or objects. Presumably, the plurality\nwould not refuse to apply \u00a71519 when a person only con-\nceals evidence rather than destroying, altering, or falsify-\ning it; instead, the plurality would say that a title is just a\ntitle, which cannot \u201cundo or limit\u201d more specific statutory\ntext. Ibid. (quoting Trainmen, 331 U. S., at 529). The\nsame holds true when the evidence in question is not a\n\u201crecord\u201d but something else whose destruction, alteration,\netc., is intended to obstruct justice.\n   The plurality next tries to divine meaning from \u00a71519\u2019s\n\u201cposition within Chapter 73 of Title 18.\u201d Ante, at 10. But\nthat move is yet odder than the last. As far as I can tell,\nthis Court has never once suggested that the section num-\nber assigned to a law bears upon its meaning. Cf. Scalia,\nsupra, at xi\u2013xvi (listing more than 50 interpretive princi-\nples and canons without mentioning the plurality\u2019s new\nnumber-in-the-Code theory). And even on its own terms,\nthe plurality\u2019s argument is hard to fathom. The plurality\nclaims that if \u00a71519 applied to objects generally, Congress\nwould not have placed it \u201cafter the pre-existing \u00a71516,\n\u00a71517, and \u00a71518\u201d because those are \u201cspecialized provi-\nsions.\u201d Ante, at 11. But search me if I can find a better\nplace for a broad ban on evidence-tampering. The plural-\nity seems to agree that the law properly goes in Chapter\n73\u2014the criminal code\u2019s chapter on \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d\nBut the provision does not logically fit into any of that\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)                     9\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nchapter\u2019s pre-existing sections. And with the first 18\nnumbers of the chapter already taken (starting with \u00a71501\nand continuing through \u00a71518), the law naturally took the\n19th place. That is standard operating procedure. Prior\nto the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all of Chapter 73 was\nordered chronologically: Section 1518 was later enacted\nthan \u00a71517, which was later enacted than \u00a71516, which\nwas . . . well, you get the idea. And after Sarbanes-Oxley,\nCongress has continued in the same vein. Section 1519 is\nthus right where you would expect it (as is the contempo-\nraneously passed \u00a71520)\u2014between \u00a71518 (added in 1996)\nand \u00a71521 (added in 2008).2\n  The plurality\u2019s third argument, relying on the surplus-\nage canon, at least invokes a known tool of statutory\nconstruction\u2014but it too comes to nothing. Says the plu-\nrality: If read naturally, \u00a71519 \u201cwould render superfluous\u201d\n\u00a71512(c)(1), which Congress passed \u201cas part of the same\nact.\u201d Ante, at 13. But that is not so: Although the two\nprovisions significantly overlap, each applies to conduct\nthe other does not. The key difference between the two is\nthat \u00a71519 protects the integrity of \u201cmatter[s] within the\njurisdiction of any [federal] department or agency\u201d whereas\n\u00a71512(c)(1) safeguards \u201cofficial proceeding[s]\u201d as defined\nin \u00a71515(a)(1)(A). Section 1519\u2019s language often applies\nmore broadly than \u00a71512(c)(1)\u2019s, as the plurality notes.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The lonesome exception to Chapter 73\u2019s chronological order is\n\n\u00a71514A, added in Sarbanes-Oxley to create a civil action to protect\nwhistleblowers. Congress decided to place that provision right after the\nonly other section in Chapter 73 to authorize a civil action (that one to\nprotect victims and witnesses). The plurality, seizing on the \u00a71514\nexample, says it likewise \u201cwould have made more sense for Congress to\ncodify the substance of \u00a71519 within \u00a71512 or in a new \u00a71512A.\u201d Ante,\nat 12, n. 4. But \u00a71512 is titled \u201cTampering with a witness, victim, or an\ninformant,\u201d and its provisions almost all protect witnesses from intimi-\ndation and harassment. It makes perfect sense that Congress wanted a\nbroad ban on evidence-spoliation to stand on its own rather than as\npart of\u2014or an appendage to\u2014a witness-tampering provision.\n10                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nFor example, an FBI investigation counts as a matter\nwithin a federal department\u2019s jurisdiction, but falls out-\nside the statutory definition of \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d as\nconstrued by courts. See, e.g., United States v. Gabriel,\n125 F. 3d 89, 105, n. 13 (CA2 1997). But conversely,\n\u00a71512(c)(1) sometimes reaches more widely than \u00a71519.\nFor example, because an \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d includes any\n\u201cproceeding before a judge or court of the United States,\u201d\n\u00a71512(c)(1) prohibits tampering with evidence in federal\nlitigation between private parties. See \u00a71515(a)(1)(A);\nUnited States v. Burge, 711 F. 3d 803, 808\u2013810 (CA7\n2013); United States v. Reich, 479 F. 3d 179, 185\u2013187 (CA2\n2007) (Sotomayor, J.). By contrast, \u00a71519 wouldn\u2019t ordi-\nnarily operate in that context because a federal court isn\u2019t\na \u201cdepartment or agency.\u201d See Hubbard v. United States,\n514 U. S. 695, 715 (1995).3 So the surplusage canon\ndoesn\u2019t come into play.4 Overlap\u2014even significant over-\nlap\u2014abounds in the criminal law. See Loughrin v. United\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The plurality\u2019s objection to this statement is difficult to understand.\n\nIt cannot take issue with Hubbard\u2019s holding that \u201ca federal court is\nneither a \u2018department\u2019 nor an \u2018agency\u2019 \u201d in a statute referring, just as\n\u00a71519 does, to \u201cany matter within the jurisdiction of any department or\nagency of the United States.\u201d 514 U. S., at 698, 715. So the plurality\nsuggests that the phrase \u201cin relation to . . . any such matter\u201d in \u00a71519\nsomehow changes Hubbard\u2019s result. See ante, at 12\u201313, and n. 5. But\nthat phrase still demands that evidence-tampering relate to a \u201cmatter\nwithin the jurisdiction of any department or agency\u201d\u2014excluding courts,\nas Hubbard commands. That is why the federal government, as far as\nI can tell, has never once brought a prosecution under \u00a71519 for\nevidence-tampering in litigation between private parties. It instead uses\n\u00a71512(c)(1) for that purpose.\n  4 Section 1512(c)(1) also applies more broadly than \u00a71519 in proceed-\n\nings relating to insurance regulation. The term \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d in\n\u00a71512(c)(1) is defined to include \u201cproceeding[s] involving the business of\ninsurance whose activities affect interstate commerce before any\ninsurance regulatory official or agency.\u201d \u00a71515(a)(1)(D). But \u00a71519\nwouldn\u2019t usually apply in that context because state, not federal,\nagencies handle most insurance regulation.\n                   Cite as: 574 U.

This Court has never thought that of such ordinary\nstuff surplusage is made. See ibid.; Connecticut Nat. Bank\nv. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992).\n   And the legislative history to which the plurality ap-\npeals, see ante, at 6, only cuts against it because those\nmaterials show that lawmakers knew that \u00a71519 and\n\u00a71512(c)(1) share much common ground. Minority Leader\nLott introduced the amendment that included \u00a71512(c)(1)\n(along with other criminal and corporate fraud provisions)\nlate in the legislative process, explaining that he did so at\nthe specific request of the President. See 148 Cong. Rec.\n12509, 12512 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Lott). Not only Lott\nbut several other Senators noted the overlap between the\nPresident\u2019s package and provisions already in the bill,\nmost notably \u00a71519. See id., at 12512 (remarks of Sen.\nLott); id., at 12513 (remarks of Sen. Biden); id., at 12517\n(remarks of Sens. Hatch and Gramm). The presence of\nboth \u00a71519 and \u00a71512(c)(1) in the final Act may have\nreflected belt-and-suspenders caution: If \u00a71519 contained\nsome flaw, \u00a71512(c)(1) would serve as a backstop. Or the\naddition of \u00a71512(c)(1) may have derived solely from legis-\nlators\u2019 wish \u201cto satisfy audiences other than courts\u201d\u2014that\nis, the President and his Justice Department. Gluck &\nBressman, Statutory Interpretation from the Inside, 65\nStan. L. Rev. 901, 935 (2013) (emphasis deleted). Which-\never the case, Congress\u2019s consciousness of overlap between\nthe two provisions removes any conceivable reason to cast\naside \u00a71519\u2019s ordinary meaning in service of preventing\nsome statutory repetition.\n   Indeed, the inclusion of \u00a71512(c)(1) in Sarbanes-Oxley\ncreates a far worse problem for the plurality\u2019s construction\nof \u00a71519 than for mine. Section 1512(c)(1) criminalizes the\ndestruction of any \u201crecord, document, or other object\u201d;\n\u00a71519 of any \u201crecord, document, or tangible object.\u201d On\nthe plurality\u2019s view, one \u201cobject\u201d is really an object, where-\n12                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nas the other is only an object that preserves or stores\ninformation. But \u201c[t]he normal rule of statutory construc-\ntion assumes that identical words used in different parts\nof the same act,\u201d passed at the same time, \u201care intended to\nhave the same meaning.\u201d Sorenson v. Secretary of Treas-\nury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And that is especially true when the different\nprovisions pertain to the same subject. See supra, at 5\u20136.\nThe plurality doesn\u2019t\u2014really, can\u2019t\u2014explain why it in-\nstead interprets the same words used in two provisions of\nthe same Act addressing the same basic problem to mean\nfundamentally different things.\n   Getting nowhere with surplusage, the plurality switches\ncanons, hoping that noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\nwill save it. See ante, at 13\u201316; see also ante, at 1\u20132 (opin-\nion of ALITO, J.). The first of those related canons advises\nthat words grouped in a list be given similar meanings.\nThe second counsels that a general term following specific\nwords embraces only things of a similar kind. According\nto the plurality, those Latin maxims change the English\nmeaning of \u201ctangible object\u201d to only things, like records\nand documents, \u201cused to record or preserve information.\u201d\nAnte, at 14.5 But understood as this Court always has, the\ncanons have no such transformative effect on the worka-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The plurality seeks support for this argument in the Sentencing\n\nCommission\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201crecords, documents, or\ntangible objects,\u201d ante, at 14, but to no avail. The plurality cites a note\nin the Commission\u2019s Manual clarifying that this phrase, as used in the\nSentencing Guidelines, \u201cincludes\u201d various electronic information,\ncommunications, and storage devices.           United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual \u00a72J1.2, comment., n. 1 (Nov. 2014)\n(USSG). But \u201cincludes\u201d (following its ordinary definition) \u201cis not\nexhaustive,\u201d as the Commission\u2019s commentary makes explicit. USSG\n\u00a71B1.1, comment., n. 2. Otherwise, the Commission\u2019s construction\nwouldn\u2019t encompass paper documents. All the note does is to make\nplain that \u201crecords, documents, or tangible objects\u201d embraces stuff\nrelating to the digital (as well as the material) world.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            13\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nday language Congress chose.\n   As an initial matter, this Court uses noscitur a sociis\nand ejusdem generis to resolve ambiguity, not create it.\nThose principles are \u201cuseful rule[s] of construction where\nwords are of obscure or doubtful meaning.\u201d Russell Motor\nCar Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 520 (1923). But\nwhen words have a clear definition, and all other contex-\ntual clues support that meaning, the canons cannot\nproperly defeat Congress\u2019s decision to draft broad legisla-\ntion. See, e.g., Ali, 552 U. S., at 227 (rejecting the invoca-\ntion of these canons as an \u201cattempt to create ambiguity\nwhere the statute\u2019s text and structure suggest none\u201d).\n   Anyway, assigning \u201ctangible object\u201d its ordinary mean-\ning comports with noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\nwhen applied, as they should be, with attention to \u00a71519\u2019s\nsubject and purpose. Those canons require identifying a\ncommon trait that links all the words in a statutory\nphrase. See, e.g., Graham County Soil and Water Conser-\nvation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. 280,\n289, n. 7 (2010); Ali, 552 U. S., at 224\u2013226. In responding\nto that demand, the plurality characterizes records and\ndocuments as things that preserve information\u2014and so\nthey are. But just as much, they are things that provide\ninformation, and thus potentially serve as evidence rele-\nvant to matters under review. And in a statute pertaining\nto obstruction of federal investigations, that evidentiary\nfunction comes to the fore. The destruction of records and\ndocuments prevents law enforcement agents from gather-\ning facts relevant to official inquiries. And so too does the\ndestruction of tangible objects\u2014of whatever kind. Whether\nthe item is a fisherman\u2019s ledger or an undersized fish,\nthrowing it overboard has the identical effect on the ad-\nministration of justice. See supra, at 7. For purposes of\n\u00a71519, records, documents, and (all) tangible objects are\ntherefore alike.\n   Indeed, even the plurality can\u2019t fully credit its nosci-\n14                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ntur/ejusdem argument. The same reasoning would apply\nto every law placing the word \u201cobject\u201d (or \u201cthing\u201d) after\n\u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument.\u201d But as noted earlier, such stat-\nutes are common: The phrase appears (among other places)\nin many state laws based on the Model Penal Code, as\nwell as in multiple provisions of \u00a71512. See supra, at 4\u20135.\nThe plurality accepts that in those laws \u201cobject\u201d means\nobject; its argument about superfluity positively depends\non giving \u00a71512(c)(1) that broader reading. See ante, at\n13, 16. What, then, is the difference here? The plurality\nproposes that some of those statutes describe less serious\noffenses than \u00a71519. See ante, at 17. How and why that\ndistinction affects application of the noscitur a sociis and\nejusdem generis canons is left obscure: Count it as\none more of the plurality\u2019s never-before-propounded,\nnot-readily-explained interpretive theories. See supra, at 7,\n8\u20139, 11\u201312. But in any event, that rationale cannot sup-\nport the plurality\u2019s willingness to give \u201cobject\u201d its natural\nmeaning in \u00a71512, which (like \u00a71519) sets out felonies\nwith penalties of up to 20 years. See \u00a7\u00a71512(a)(3)(C), (b),\n(c). The canons, in the plurality\u2019s interpretive world,\napparently switch on and off whenever convenient.\n   And the plurality\u2019s invocation of \u00a71519\u2019s verbs does\nnothing to buttress its canon-based argument. See ante,\nat 14\u201315; ante, at 2\u20133 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The plurality\nobserves that \u00a71519 prohibits \u201cfalsif[ying]\u201d or \u201cmak[ing] a\nfalse entry in\u201d a tangible object, and no one can do those\nthings to, say, a murder weapon (or a fish). Ante, at 14.\nBut of course someone can alter, destroy, mutilate, con-\nceal, or cover up such a tangible object, and \u00a71519 prohibits\nthose actions too. The Court has never before suggested\nthat all the verbs in a statute need to match up with all\nthe nouns. See Robers v. United States, 572 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 4) (\u201c[T]he law does not require legisla-\ntors to write extra language specifically exempting, phrase\nby phrase, applications in respect to which a portion of a\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)                    15\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nphrase is not needed\u201d). And for good reason. It is exactly\nwhen Congress sets out to draft a statute broadly\u2014to\ninclude every imaginable variation on a theme\u2014that such\nmismatches will arise. To respond by narrowing the law,\nas the plurality does, is thus to flout both what Congress\nwrote and what Congress wanted.\n   Finally, when all else fails, the plurality invokes the\nrule of lenity. See ante, at 18. But even in its most robust\nform, that rule only kicks in when, \u201cafter all legitimate\ntools of interpretation have been exhausted, \u2018a reasonable\ndoubt persists\u2019 regarding whether Congress has made the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct a federal crime.\u201d Abramski v. United\nStates, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 12) (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990)). No such doubt lingers here. The plural-\nity points to the breadth of \u00a71519, see ante, at 18, as\nthough breadth were equivalent to ambiguity. It is not.\nSection 1519 is very broad. It is also very clear. Every\ntraditional tool of statutory interpretation points in the\nsame direction, toward \u201cobject\u201d meaning object. Lenity\noffers no proper refuge from that straightforward (even\nthough capacious) construction.6\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 As part of its lenity argument, the plurality asserts that Yates did\n\nnot have \u201cfair warning\u201d that his conduct amounted to a felony. Ante, at\n18; see ante, at 17 (stating that \u201cYates would have had scant reason to\nanticipate a felony prosecution\u201d when throwing fish overboard). But\neven under the plurality\u2019s view, the dumping of fish is potentially a\nfederal felony\u2014just under \u00a71512(c)(1), rather than \u00a71519. See ante, at\n12\u201313. In any event, the plurality itself acknowledges that the ordi-\nnary meaning of \u00a71519 covers Yates\u2019s conduct, see ante, at 7: That\nprovision, no less than \u00a71512(c)(1), announces its broad scope in the\nclearest possible terms. And when an ordinary citizen seeks notice of a\nstatute\u2019s scope, he is more likely to focus on the plain text than (as the\nplurality would have it) on the section number, the superfluity princi-\nple, and the noscitur and ejusdem canons.\n16                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n   The concurring opinion is a shorter, vaguer version of\nthe plurality\u2019s. It relies primarily on the noscitur a sociis\nand ejusdem generis canons, tries to bolster them with\n\u00a71519\u2019s \u201clist of verbs,\u201d and concludes with the section\u2019s\ntitle. See supra, at 7\u20138, 12\u201313, 14\u201315 (addressing each of\nthose arguments). (Notably, even the concurrence puts no\nstock in the plurality\u2019s section-number and superfluity\nclaims.) From those familiar materials, the concurrence\narrives at the following definition: \u201c \u2018tangible object\u2019 should\nmean something similar to records or documents.\u201d Ante,\nat 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). In amplifying that purported\nguidance, the concurrence suggests applying the term\n\u201ctangible object\u201d in keeping with what \u201ca neighbor, when\nasked to identify something similar to record or docu-\nment,\u201d might answer. Ante, at 1. \u201c[W]ho wouldn\u2019t raise an\neyebrow,\u201d the concurrence wonders, if the neighbor said\n\u201ccrocodile\u201d? Ante, at 1\u20132. Courts sometimes say, when\nexplaining the Latin maxims, that the \u201cwords of a statute\nshould be interpreted consistent with their neighbors.\u201d\nSee, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 105 (2000).\nThe concurrence takes that expression literally.\n   But \u00a71519\u2019s meaning should not hinge on the odd game\nof Mad Libs the concurrence proposes. No one reading\n\u00a71519 needs to fill in a blank after the words \u201crecords\u201d and\n\u201cdocuments.\u201d That is because Congress, quite helpfully,\nalready did so\u2014adding the term \u201ctangible object.\u201d The\nissue in this case is what that term means. So if the con-\ncurrence wishes to ask its neighbor a question, I\u2019d recom-\nmend a more pertinent one: Do you think a fish (or, if the\nconcurrence prefers, a crocodile) is a \u201ctangible object\u201d? As\nto that query, \u201cwho wouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow\u201d if the\nneighbor said \u201cno\u201d?\n   In insisting on its different question, the concurrence\nneglects the proper function of catchall phrases like \u201cor\ntangible object.\u201d The reason Congress uses such terms is\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)                 17\n\n                        KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nprecisely to reach things that, in the concurrence\u2019s words,\n\u201cdo[ ] not spring to mind\u201d\u2014to my mind, to my neighbor\u2019s,\nor (most important) to Congress\u2019s. Ante, at 1 (opinion of\nALITO, J.). As this Court recently explained: \u201c[T]he whole\nvalue of a generally phrased residual [term] is that it\nserves as a catchall for matters not specifically contem-\nplated\u2014known unknowns.\u201d Beaty, 556 U. S., at 860.\nCongress realizes that in a game of free association with\n\u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument,\u201d it will never think of all the\nother things\u2014including crocodiles and fish\u2014whose de-\nstruction or alteration can (less frequently but just as\neffectively) thwart law enforcement. Cf. United States v.\nStubbs, 11 F. 3d 632, 637\u2013638 (CA6 1993) (dead crocodiles\nused as evidence to support smuggling conviction). And so\nCongress adds the general term \u201cor tangible object\u201d\u2014\nagain, exactly because such things \u201cdo[ ] not spring to\nmind.\u201d7\n   The concurrence suggests that the term \u201ctangible object\u201d\nserves not as a catchall for physical evidence but to \u201cen-\nsure beyond question\u201d that e-mails and other electronic\nfiles fall within \u00a71519\u2019s compass. Ante, at 2. But that\nclaim is eyebrow-raising in its own right. Would a Con-\ngress wishing to make certain that \u00a71519 applies to\ne-mails add the phrase \u201ctangible object\u201d (as opposed, say, to\n\u201celectronic communications\u201d)? Would a judge or jury\nmember predictably find that \u201ctangible object\u201d encom-\npasses something as virtual as e-mail (as compared, say,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The concurrence contends that when the noscitur and ejusdem can-\n\nons are in play, \u201c \u2018known unknowns\u2019 should be similar to known\nknowns, i.e., here, records and documents.\u201d Ante, at 2. But as noted\nabove, records and documents are similar to crocodiles and fish as far\nas \u00a71519 is concerned: All are potentially useful as evidence in an\ninvestigation. See supra, at 13. The concurrence never explains why\nthat similarity isn\u2019t the relevant one in a statute aimed at evidence-\ntampering.\n18               YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwith something as real as a fish)? If not (and the answer\nis not), then that term cannot function as a failsafe for\ne-mails.\n  The concurrence acknowledges that no one of its argu-\nments can carry the day; rather, it takes the Latin canons\nplus \u00a71519\u2019s verbs plus \u00a71519\u2019s title to \u201ctip the case\u201d for\nYates. Ante, at 1. But the sum total of three mistaken\narguments is . . . three mistaken arguments. They do not\nget better in the combining. And so the concurrence ends\nup right where the plurality does, except that the concur-\nrence, eschewing the rule of lenity, has nothing to fall\nback on.\n                              III\n   If none of the traditional tools of statutory interpreta-\ntion can produce today\u2019s result, then what accounts for it?\nThe plurality offers a clue when it emphasizes the dispro-\nportionate penalties \u00a71519 imposes if the law is read\nbroadly. See ante, at 17\u201318. Section 1519, the plurality\nobjects, would then \u201cexpose[ ] individuals to 20-year prison\nsentences for tampering with any physical object that\nmight have evidentiary value in any federal investigation\ninto any offense.\u201d Ante, at 18. That brings to the surface\nthe real issue: overcriminalization and excessive punish-\nment in the U. S. Code.\n   Now as to this statute, I think the plurality somewhat\u2014\nthough only somewhat\u2014exaggerates the matter. The\nplurality omits from its description of \u00a71519 the require-\nment that a person act \u201cknowingly\u201d and with \u201cthe intent to\nimpede, obstruct, or influence\u201d federal law enforcement.\nAnd in highlighting \u00a71519\u2019s maximum penalty, the plural-\nity glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum.\n(Let\u2019s not forget that Yates\u2019s sentence was not 20 years,\nbut 30 days.) Congress presumably enacts laws with high\nmaximums and no minimums when it thinks the prohibited\nconduct may run the gamut from major to minor. That\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)           19\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nis assuredly true of acts obstructing justice. Compare this\ncase with the following, all of which properly come within,\nbut now fall outside, \u00a71519: McRae, 702 F. 3d, at 834\u2013838\n(burning human body to thwart murder investigation);\nMaury, 695 F. 3d, at 243\u2013244 (altering cement mixer to\nimpede inquiry into amputation of employee\u2019s fingers);\nUnited States v. Natal, 2014 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 108852,\n*24\u2013*26 (D Conn., Aug. 7, 2014) (repainting van to cover\nup evidence of fatal arson). Most district judges, as Con-\ngress knows, will recognize differences between such cases\nand prosecutions like this one, and will try to make the\npunishment fit the crime. Still and all, I tend to think, for\nthe reasons the plurality gives, that \u00a71519 is a bad law\u2014\ntoo broad and undifferentiated, with too-high maximum\npenalties, which give prosecutors too much leverage and\nsentencers too much discretion. And I\u2019d go further: In\nthose ways, \u00a71519 is unfortunately not an outlier, but an\nemblem of a deeper pathology in the federal criminal code.\n   But whatever the wisdom or folly of \u00a71519, this Court\ndoes not get to rewrite the law. \u201cResolution of the pros\nand cons of whether a statute should sweep broadly or\nnarrowly is for Congress.\u201d Rodgers, 466 U. S., at 484. If\njudges disagree with Congress\u2019s choice, we are perfectly\nentitled to say so\u2014in lectures, in law review articles, and\neven in dicta. But we are not entitled to replace the stat-\nute Congress enacted with an alternative of our own\ndesign.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
