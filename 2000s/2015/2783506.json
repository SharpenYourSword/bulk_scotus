Argued December 8, 2014\u2014Decided March 3, 2015\n     Colorado requires residents who purchase tangible personal prop-\n  erty from a retailer that does not collect sales or use taxes to file a re-\n  turn and remit those taxes directly to the State Department of Reve-\n  nue. To improve compliance, Colorado enacted legislation requiring\n  noncollecting retailers to notify any Colorado customer of the State\u2019s\n  sales and use tax requirement and to report tax-related information\n  to those customers and the Colorado Department of Revenue.\n     Petitioner, a trade association of retailers, many of which sell to\n  Colorado residents but do not collect taxes, sued respondent, the Di-\n  rector of the Colorado Department of Revenue, in Federal District\n  Court, alleging that Colorado\u2019s law violates the United States and\n  Colorado Constitutions. The District Court granted petitioner partial\n  summary judgment and permanently enjoined enforcement of the no-\n  tice and reporting requirements, but the Tenth Circuit reversed.\n  That court held that the Tax Injunction Act (TIA), which provides\n  that federal district courts \u201cshall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the\n  assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a\n  plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such\n  State,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71341, deprived the District Court of jurisdiction\n  over the suit.\nHeld: Petitioner\u2019s suit is not barred by the TIA. Pp. 4\u201313.\n    (a) The relief sought by petitioner would not \u201cenjoin, suspend or re-\n strain the assessment, levy or collection\u201d of Colorado\u2019s sales and use\n taxes. Pp. 4\u201312.\n      (1) The terms \u201cassessment,\u201d \u201clevy,\u201d and \u201ccollection\u201d do not en-\n2                DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    compass Colorado\u2019s enforcement of its notice and reporting require-\n    ments. These terms, read in light of the Federal Tax Code, refer to\n    discrete phases of the taxation process that do not include informa-\n    tional notices or private reports of information relevant to tax liabil-\n    ity. Information gathering has long been treated as a phase of tax\n    administration that occurs before assessment, levy, or collection.\n    See, e.g., 26 U. S. C. \u00a76041 et seq. Respondent portrays the notice\n    and reporting requirements as part of the State\u2019s assessment and col-\n    lection process, but the State\u2019s assessment and collection procedures\n    are triggered after the State has received the returns and made the\n    deficiency determinations that the notice and reporting requirements\n    are meant to facilitate. Enforcement of the requirements may im-\n    prove the State\u2019s ability to assess and ultimately collect its sales and\n    use taxes, but the TIA is not keyed to all such activities. Such a rule\n    would be inconsistent with the statute\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s rule fa-\n    voring clear boundaries in the interpretation of jurisdictional stat-\n    utes. See Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. 77, 94. Pp. 5\u20139.\n         (2) Petitioner\u2019s suit cannot be understood to \u201crestrain\u201d the \u201cas-\n    sessment, levy or collection\u201d of Colorado\u2019s sales and use taxes merely\n    because it may inhibit those activities. While the word \u201crestrain\u201d can\n    be defined as broadly as the Tenth Circuit defined it, it also has a\n    narrower meaning used in equity, which captures only those orders\n    that stop acts of assessment, levy, or collection. The context in which\n    the TIA uses the word \u201crestrain\u201d resolves this ambiguity in favor of\n    this narrower meaning. First, the verbs accompanying \u201crestrain\u201d\u2014\n    \u201cenjoin\u201d and \u201csuspend\u201d\u2014are terms of art in equity and refer to differ-\n    ent equitable remedies that restrict or stop official action, strongly\n    suggesting that \u201crestrain\u201d does the same. Additionally, \u201crestrain\u201d\n    acts on \u201cassessment,\u201d \u201clevy,\u201d and \u201ccollection,\u201d a carefully selected list\n    of technical terms. The Tenth Circuit\u2019s broad meaning would defeat\n    the precision of that list and render many of those terms surplusage.\n    Assigning \u201crestrain\u201d its meaning in equity is also consistent with this\n    Court\u2019s recognition that the TIA \u201chas its roots in equity practice,\u201d\n    Tully v. Griffin, Inc., 429 U. S. 68, 73, and with the principle that\n    \u201c[j]urisdictional rules should be clear,\u201d Grable & Sons Metal Prod-\n    ucts, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 321 (THOMAS,\n    J., concurring). Pp. 10\u201312.\n       (b) The Court takes no position on whether a suit such as this\n    might be barred under the \u201ccomity doctrine,\u201d which \u201ccounsels lower\n    federal courts to resist engagement in certain cases falling within\n    their jurisdiction,\u201d Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U. S. 413,\n    421. The Court leaves it to the Tenth Circuit to decide on remand\n    whether the comity argument remains available to Colorado.

We\nmust decide whether the Tax Injunction Act, which pro-\nvides that federal district courts \u201cshall not enjoin, suspend\nor restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax\nunder State law,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71341, bars a suit to enjoin\nthe enforcement of this law. We hold that it does not.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  Like many States, Colorado has a complementary sales-\nand-use tax regime. Colorado imposes both a 2.9 percent\ntax on the sale of tangible personal property within the\nState, Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a739\u201326\u2013104(1)(a), 39\u201326\u2013106(1)\n(a)(II) (2014), and an equivalent use tax for any prop-\nerty stored, used, or consumed in Colorado on which a\n2           DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsales tax was not paid to a retailer, \u00a7\u00a739\u201326\u2013202(1)(b), 39\u2013\n26\u2013204(1). Retailers with a physical presence in Colorado\nmust collect the sales or use tax from consumers at the\npoint of sale and remit the proceeds to the Colorado De-\npartment of Revenue (Department). \u00a7\u00a739\u201326\u2013105(1), 39\u2013\n26\u2013106(2)(a). But under our negative Commerce Clause\nprecedents, Colorado may not require retailers who lack a\nphysical presence in the State to collect these taxes on\nbehalf of the Department. See Quill Corp. v. North Da-\nkota, 504 U. S. 298, 315\u2013318 (1992). Thus, Colorado re-\nquires its consumers who purchase tangible personal\nproperty from a retailer that does not collect these taxes (a\n\u201cnoncollecting retailer\u201d) to fill out a return and remit the\ntaxes to the Department directly. \u00a739\u201326\u2013204(1).\n    Voluntary compliance with the latter requirement is\nrelatively low, leading to a significant loss of tax revenue,\nespecially as Internet retailers have increasingly displaced\ntheir brick-and-mortar kin. In the decade before this suit\nwas filed in 2010, e-commerce more than tripled. App. 28.\nWith approximately 25 percent of taxes unpaid on Inter-\nnet sales, Colorado estimated in 2010 that its revenue loss\nattributable to noncompliance would grow by more than\n$20 million each year. App. 30\u201331.\n    In hopes of stopping this trend, Colorado enacted legis-\nlation in 2010 imposing notice and reporting obligations\non noncollecting retailers whose gross sales in Colorado\nexceed $100,000. Three provisions of that Act, along with\ntheir implementing regulations, are at issue here.\n    First, noncollecting retailers must \u201cnotify Colorado\npurchasers that sales or use tax is due on certain purchases\n. . . and that the state of Colorado requires the purchaser\nto file a sales or use tax return.\u201d \u00a739\u201321\u2013112(3.5)(c)(I);\nsee also 1 Colo.

Rev. Stat. \u00a739\u201321\u2013112(3.5)(c)(II).\n   Second, by January 31 of each year, each noncollecting\nretailer must send a report to all Colorado purchasers who\nbought more than $500 worth of goods from the retailer in\nthe previous year. \u00a739\u201321\u2013112(3.5)(d)(I); 1 Colo. Code\nRegs. \u00a7\u00a7201\u20131:39\u201321\u2013112.3.5(3)(a), (c). That report must\nlist the dates, categories, and amounts of those purchases.\nColo. Rev.

It must also\ncontain a notice stating that Colorado \u201crequires a sales or\nuse tax return to be filed and sales or use tax paid on\ncertain Colorado purchases made by the purchaser from\nthe retailer.\u201d Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a739\u201321\u2013112(3.5)(d)(I)(A).\nThe retailer is subject to a penalty of $10 for each report it\nfails to send. \u00a739\u201321\u2013112(3.5)(d)(III)(A); see also 1 Colo.\nCode Regs. \u00a7201\u20131:39\u201321\u2013112.3.5(3)(d).\n   Finally, by March 1 of each year, noncollecting retailers\nmust send a statement to the Department listing the\nnames of their Colorado customers, their known addresses,\nand the total amount each Colorado customer paid for\nColorado purchases in the prior calendar year. Colo. Rev.\nStat. \u00a739\u201321\u2013112(3.5)(d)(II)(A); 1 Colo. Code Regs. \u00a7201\u2013\n1:39\u201321\u2013112.3.5(4). A noncollecting retailer that fails to\nmake this report is subject to a penalty of $10 for each\ncustomer that it should have listed in the report. Colo.\nRev.

BROHL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npresence in Colorado and choose not to collect Colorado\nsales and use taxes on Colorado purchases. As a result,\nthey are subject to Colorado\u2019s notice and reporting\nrequirements.\n   In 2010, Direct Marketing Association brought suit in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Colo-\nrado against the Executive Director of the Department,\nalleging that the notice and reporting requirements violate\nprovisions of the United States and Colorado Constitu-\ntions. As relevant here, Direct Marketing Association\nalleged that the provisions (1) discriminate against inter-\nstate commerce and (2) impose undue burdens on inter-\nstate commerce, all in violation of this Court\u2019s negative\nCommerce Clause precedents. At the request of both\nparties, the District Court stayed all challenges except\nthese two, in order to facilitate expedited consideration. It\nthen granted partial summary judgment to Direct Market-\ning Association and permanently enjoined enforcement of\nthe notice and reporting requirements. App. to Pet. for\nCert. B\u20131 to B\u201325.\n   Exercising appellate jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71292(a)(1), the United States Court of Appeals for the\nTenth Circuit reversed. Without reaching the merits, the\nCourt of Appeals held that the District Court lacked juris-\ndiction over the suit because of the Tax Injunction Act\n(TIA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a71341. Acknowledging that the suit\n\u201cdiffers from the prototypical TIA case,\u201d the Court of Ap-\npeals nevertheless found it barred by the TIA because, if\nsuccessful, it \u201cwould limit, restrict, or hold back the state\u2019s\nchosen method of enforcing its tax laws and generating\nrevenue.\u201d 735 F. 3d 904, 913 (2013).\n   We granted certiorari, 573 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nreverse.\n                            II\n    Enacted in 1937, the TIA provides that federal district\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts \u201cshall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assess-\nment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a\nplain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the\ncourts of such State.\u201d \u00a71341. The question before us is\nwhether the relief sought here would \u201cenjoin, suspend or\nrestrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under\nState law.\u201d Because we conclude that it would not, we\nneed not consider whether \u201ca plain, speedy and efficient\nremedy may be had in the courts of \u201d Colorado.\n                              A\n  The District Court enjoined state officials from enforcing\nthe notice and reporting requirements. Because an in-\njunction is clearly a form of equitable relief barred by the\nTIA, the question becomes whether the enforcement of the\nnotice and reporting requirements is an act of \u201cassess-\nment, levy or collection.\u201d We need not comprehensively\ndefine these terms to conclude that they do not encompass\nenforcement of the notice and reporting requirements at\nissue.\n  In defining the terms of the TIA, we have looked to\nfederal tax law as a guide. See, e.g., Hibbs v. Winn, 542\nU. S. 88, 100 (2004). Although the TIA does not concern\nfederal taxes, it was modeled on the Anti-Injunction Act\n(AIA), which does. See Jefferson County v. Acker, 527\nU. S. 423, 434\u2013435 (1999). The AIA provides in relevant\npart that \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the as-\nsessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in\nany court by any person.\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a77421(a). We as-\nsume that words used in both Acts are generally used in\nthe same way, and we discern the meaning of the terms in\nthe AIA by reference to the broader Tax Code. Hibbs,\nsupra, at 102\u2013105; id., at 115 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\nRead in light of the Federal Tax Code at the time the TIA\nwas enacted (as well as today), these three terms refer to\ndiscrete phases of the taxation process that do not include\n6            DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninformational notices or private reports of information\nrelevant to tax liability.\n   To begin, the Federal Tax Code has long treated infor-\nmation gathering as a phase of tax administration proce-\ndure that occurs before assessment, levy, or collection.\nSee \u00a7\u00a76001\u20136117; \u00a7\u00a71500\u20131524 (1934 ed.); see also \u00a71533\n(\u201cAll provisions of law for the ascertainment of liability to\nany tax, or the assessment or collection thereof, shall be\nheld to apply . . . \u201d). This step includes private reporting of\ninformation used to determine tax liability, see, e.g.,\n\u00a71511(a), including reports by third parties who do not\nowe the tax, see, e.g., \u00a76041 et seq. (2012 ed.); see also\n\u00a7\u00a71512(a)\u2013(b) (1934 ed.) (authorizing a collector or the\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue, when a taxpayer fails\nto file a return, to make a return \u201cfrom his own knowledge\nand from such information as he can obtain through tes-\ntimony or otherwise\u201d).\n   \u201cAssessment\u201d is the next step in the process, and it\nrefers to the official recording of a taxpayer\u2019s liability,\nwhich occurs after information relevant to the calculation\nof that liability is reported to the taxing authority. See\n\u00a71530. In Hibbs, the Court noted that \u201cassessment,\u201d as\nused in the Internal Revenue Code, \u201cinvolves a \u2018recording\u2019\nof the amount the taxpayer owes the Government.\u201d 542\nU. S., at 100 (quoting \u00a76203 (2000 ed.)). It might also be\nunderstood more broadly to encompass the process by\nwhich that amount is calculated. See United States v.\nGalletti, 541 U. S. 114, 122 (2004); see also Hibbs, supra,\nat 100, n. 3. But even understood more broadly, \u201cassess-\nment\u201d has long been treated in the Tax Code as an official\naction taken based on information already reported to the\ntaxing authority. For example, not many years before it\npassed the TIA, Congress passed a law providing that the\nfiling of a return would start the running of the clock for a\ntimely assessment. See, e.g., Revenue Act of 1924, Pub. L.\n68\u2013176, \u00a7277(a), 43 Stat. 299. Thus, assessment was\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nunderstood as a step in the taxation process that occurred\nafter, and was distinct from, the step of reporting infor-\nmation pertaining to tax liability.\n    \u201cLevy,\u201d at least as it is defined in the Federal Tax Code,\nrefers to a specific mode of collection under which the\nSecretary of the Treasury distrains and seizes a recalci-\ntrant taxpayer\u2019s property. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a76331 (2012\ned.); \u00a71582 (1934 ed.). Because the word \u201clevy\u201d does not\nappear in the AIA, however, one could argue that its\nmeaning in the TIA is not tied to the meaning of the term\nas used in federal tax law. If that were the case, one\nmight look to contemporaneous dictionaries, which defined\n\u201clevy\u201d as the legislative function of laying or imposing a\ntax and the executive functions of assessing, recording,\nand collecting the amount a taxpayer owes. See Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1093 (3d ed. 1933) (Black\u2019s); see also\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1423 (2d ed.\n1939) (\u201cTo raise or collect, as by assessment, execution, or\nother legal process, etc.; to exact or impose by authority\n. . . \u201d); \u00a7\u00a71540, 1544 (using \u201clevying\u201d and \u201clevied\u201d in the\nmore general sense of an executive imposition of a tax\nliability). But under any of these definitions, \u201clevy\u201d would\nbe limited to an official governmental action imposing,\ndetermining the amount of, or securing payment on a tax.\n    Finally, \u201ccollection\u201d is the act of obtaining payment of\ntaxes due. See Black\u2019s 349 (defining \u201ccollect\u201d as \u201cto obtain\npayment or liquidation\u201d of a debt or claim). It might be\nunderstood narrowly as a step in the taxation process that\noccurs after a formal assessment. Consistent with this\nunderstanding, we have previously described it as part of\nthe \u201cenforcement process . . . that \u2018assessment\u2019 sets in\nmotion.\u201d Hibbs, supra, at 102, n. 4. The Federal Tax Code\nat the time the TIA was enacted provided for the Commis-\nsioner of Internal Revenue to certify a list of assessments\n\u201cto the proper collectors . . . who [would] proceed to collect\nand account for the taxes and penalties so certified.\u201d\n8            DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71531. That collection process began with the collector\n\u201cgiv[ing] notice to each person liable to pay any taxes\nstated [in the list] . . . stating the amount of such taxes\nand demanding payment thereof.\u201d \u00a71545(a). When a\nperson failed to pay, the Government had various means\nto collect the amount due, including liens, \u00a71560, distraint,\n\u00a71580, forfeiture, and other legal proceedings, \u00a71640.\nToday\u2019s Tax Code continues to authorize collection of taxes\nby these methods. \u00a76302 (2012 ed.). \u201cCollection\u201d might\nalso be understood more broadly to encompass the receipt\nof a tax payment before a formal assessment occurs. For\nexample, at the time the TIA was enacted, the Tax Code\nprovided for the assessment of money already received by\na person \u201crequired to collect or withhold any internal-\nrevenue tax from any other person,\u201d suggesting that at\nleast some act of collection might occur before a formal\nassessment. \u00a71551 (1934 ed.) (emphasis added). Either\nway, \u201ccollection\u201d is a separate step in the taxation process\nfrom assessment and the reporting on which assessment is\nbased.\n   So defined, these terms do not encompass Colorado\u2019s\nenforcement of its notice and reporting requirements. The\nExecutive Director does not seriously contend that the\nprovisions at issue here involve a \u201clevy\u201d; instead she por-\ntrays them as part of the process of assessment and collec-\ntion. But the notice and reporting requirements precede\nthe steps of \u201cassessment\u201d and \u201ccollection.\u201d The notice\ngiven to Colorado consumers, for example, informs them of\ntheir use-tax liability and prompts them to keep a record\nof taxable purchases that they will report to the State at\nsome future point. The annual summary that the retailers\nsend to consumers provides them with a reminder of that\nuse-tax liability and the information they need to fill out\ntheir annual returns. And the report the retailers file\nwith the Department facilitates audits to determine tax\ndeficiencies. After each of these notices or reports is filed,\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe State still needs to take further action to assess the\ntaxpayer\u2019s use-tax liability and to collect payment from\nhim. See Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a739\u201326\u2013204(3) (describing the\nprocedure for \u201cassessing and collecting [use] taxes\u201d on the\nbasis of returns filed by consumers and collecting retail-\ners). Colorado law provides for specific assessment and\ncollection procedures that are triggered after the State has\nreceived the returns and made the deficiency determina-\ntions that the notice and reporting requirements are\nmeant to facilitate. See \u00a739\u201326\u2013210; 1 Colo. Code Regs.\n\u00a7201\u20131:39\u201321\u2013107(1) (\u201cThe statute of limitations on as-\nsessments of . . . sales [and] use . . . tax . . . shall be three\nyears from the date the return was filed . . . \u201d).\n   Enforcement of the notice and reporting requirements\nmay improve Colorado\u2019s ability to assess and ultimately\ncollect its sales and use taxes from consumers, but the TIA\nis not keyed to all activities that may improve a State\u2019s\nability to assess and collect taxes. Such a rule would be\ninconsistent not only with the text of the statute, but also\nwith our rule favoring clear boundaries in the interpreta-\ntion of jurisdictional statutes. See Hertz Corp. v. Friend,\n559 U. S. 77, 94 (2010). The TIA is keyed to the acts of\nassessment, levy, and collection themselves, and enforce-\nment of the notice and reporting requirements is none of\nthese.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Our decision in California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U. S. 393\n\n(1982), is not to the contrary. In that case, California churches and\nreligious schools sought \u201cto enjoin the State from collecting both tax\ninformation and the state [unemployment] tax,\u201d based, in part, on the\nargument that \u201crecordkeeping, registration, and reporting require-\nments\u201d violate the Establishment Clause by creating the potential for\nexcessive entanglement with religion. Id., at 398, 415. We held that\nthe TIA barred that suit. Id., at 396. But nowhere in their brief to this\nCourt did the plaintiffs in Grace Brethren Church separate out their\nrequest to enjoin the tax from their request for relief from the record-\nkeeping and reporting requirements. See Brief for Grace Brethren\nChurch et al., in California v. Grace Brethren Church, O. T. 1981, No.\n10            DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               B\n\n   Apparently concluding that enforcement of the notice\nand reporting requirements was not itself an act of \u201cas-\nsessment, levy or collection,\u201d the Court of Appeals did not\nrely on those terms to hold that the TIA barred the suit.\nInstead, it adopted a broad definition of the word \u201cre-\nstrain\u201d in the TIA, which bars not only suits to \u201cenjoin . . .\nassessment, levy or collection\u201d of a state tax but also suits\nto \u201csuspend or restrain\u201d those activities. Specifically, the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the TIA bars any suit\nthat would \u201climit, restrict, or hold back\u201d the assessment,\nlevy, or collection of state taxes. 735 F. 3d, at 913. Be-\ncause the notice and reporting requirements are intended\nto facilitate collection of taxes, the Court of Appeals rea-\nsoned that the relief Direct Marketing Association sought\nand received would \u201climit, restrict, or hold back\u201d the De-\npartment\u2019s collection efforts. That was error.\n   \u201cRestrain,\u201d standing alone, can have several meanings.\nOne is the broad meaning given by the Court of Appeals,\nwhich captures orders that merely inhibit acts of \u201cassess-\nment, levy and collection.\u201d See Black\u2019s 1548. Another,\nnarrower meaning, however, is \u201c[t]o prohibit from action;\nto put compulsion upon . . . to enjoin,\u201d ibid., which cap-\ntures only those orders that stop (or perhaps compel) acts\nof \u201cassessment, levy and collection.\u201d\n   To resolve this ambiguity, we look to the context in\nwhich the word is used. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 341 (1997). The statutory context provides\nseveral clues that lead us to conclude that the TIA uses\nthe word \u201crestrain\u201d in its narrower sense. Looking to the\ncompany \u201crestrain\u201d keeps, Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co.,\n367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961), we first note that the words\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n81\u201331 etc., pp. 34\u201338. Grace Brethren Church thus cannot fairly be\n\nread as resolving, or even considering, the question presented in this \n\ncase. \n\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cenjoin\u201d and \u201csuspend\u201d are terms of art in equity, see Fair\nAssessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S.\n100, 126, and n. 13 (1981) (Brennan, J., concurring). They\nrefer to different equitable remedies that restrict or stop\nofficial action to varying degrees, strongly suggesting that\n\u201crestrain\u201d does the same. See Hibbs, 524 U. S., at 118\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting); see also Jefferson County, 572\nU. S., at 433.\n   Additionally, as used in the TIA, \u201crestrain\u201d acts on a\ncarefully selected list of technical terms\u2014\u201cassessment,\nlevy, collection\u201d\u2014not on an all-encompassing term, like\n\u201ctaxation.\u201d To give \u201crestrain\u201d the broad meaning selected\nby the Court of Appeals would be to defeat the precision of\nthat list, as virtually any court action related to any phase\nof taxation might be said to \u201chold back\u201d \u201ccollection.\u201d Such\na broad construction would thus render \u201cassessment [and]\nlevy\u201d\u2014not to mention \u201cenjoin [and] suspend\u201d\u2014mere sur-\nplusage, a result we try to avoid. See Hibbs, supra, at 101\n(interpreting the terms of the TIA to avoid superfluity).\n   Assigning the word \u201crestrain\u201d its meaning in equity is\nalso consistent with our recognition that the TIA \u201chas its\nroots in equity practice.\u201d Tully v. Griffin, Inc., 429 U. S.\n68, 73 (1976). Under the comity doctrine that the TIA\npartially codifies, Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560\nU. S. 413, 431\u2013432 (2010), courts of equity exercised their\n\u201csound discretion\u201d to withhold certain forms of extraordi-\nnary relief, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman,\n319 U. S. 293, 297 (1943); see also Dows v. Chicago, 11\nWall. 108, 110 (1871). Even while refusing to grant cer-\ntain forms of equitable relief, those courts did not refuse to\nhear every suit that would have a negative impact on\nStates\u2019 revenues. See, e.g., Henrietta Mills v. Rutherford\nCounty, 281 U. S. 121, 127 (1930); see also 5 R. Paul & J.\nMertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a742.139 (1934)\n(discussing the word \u201crestraining\u201d in the AIA in its equi-\ntable sense). The Court of Appeals\u2019 definition of \u201crestrain,\u201d\n12             DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever, leads the TIA to bar every suit with such a nega-\ntive impact. This history thus further supports the con-\nclusion that Congress used \u201crestrain\u201d in its narrower,\nequitable sense, rather than in the broad sense chosen by\nthe Court of Appeals.\n   Finally, adopting a narrower definition is consistent\nwith the rule that \u201c[j]urisdictional rules should be clear.\u201d\nGrable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering\n& Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 321 (2005) (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring); see also Hertz Corp., supra, at 94. The question\u2014at\nleast for negative injunctions\u2014is whether the relief to\nsome degree stops \u201cassessment, levy or collection,\u201d not\nwhether it merely inhibits them. The Court of Appeals\u2019\ndefinition of \u201crestrain,\u201d by contrast, produces a \u201c \u2018vague\nand obscure\u2019 \u201d boundary that would result in both needless\nlitigation and uncalled-for dismissal, Sisson v. Ruby, 497\nU. S. 358, 375 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment),\nall in the name of a jurisdictional statute meant to protect\nstate resources.\n   Applying the correct definition, a suit cannot be under-\nstood to \u201crestrain\u201d the \u201cassessment, levy or collection\u201d of a\nstate tax if it merely inhibits those activities.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Because the text of the TIA resolves this case, we decline the par-\n\nties\u2019 invitation to derive various per se rules from our decision in Hibbs\nv. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (2004). In Hibbs, the Court held that the TIA did\nnot bar an Establishment Clause challenge to a state tax credit for\ncharitable donations to organizations that provided scholarships for\nchildren to attend parochial schools. Id., at 94\u201396. Direct Marketing\nAssociation argues that Hibbs stands for the proposition that the TIA\nhas no application to third-party suits by nontaxpayers who do not\nchallenge their own liability. Brief for Petitioner 18\u201321. The Executive\nDirector acknowledges that Hibbs created an exception to the TIA, but\nargues that the exception does not apply to suits that restrain activities\nthat have a collection-propelling function. Brief for Respondent 25\u201333.\n   In Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U. S. 413 (2010), we empha-\nsized the narrow reach of Hibbs, explaining that it was not \u201ca run-of-\nthe-mine tax case,\u201d 560 U. S., at 430. As we explained, Hibbs held only\n\u201cthat the TIA did not preclude a federal challenge by a third party who\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              III\n\n   We take no position on whether a suit such as this one\nmight nevertheless be barred under the \u201ccomity doctrine,\u201d\nwhich \u201ccounsels lower federal courts to resist engagement\nin certain cases falling within their jurisdiction.\u201d Levin,\nsupra, at 421. Under this doctrine, federal courts refrain\nfrom \u201cinterfer[ing] . . . with the fiscal operations of the\nstate governments . . . in all cases where the Federal\nrights of the persons could otherwise be preserved unim-\npaired. \u201d Id., at 422 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Unlike the TIA, the comity doctrine is nonjurisdictional.\nAnd here, Colorado did not seek comity from either of the\ncourts below. Moreover, we do not understand the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 footnote concerning comity to be a holding that\ncomity compels dismissal. See 735 F. 3d, at 920, n. 11\n(\u201cAlthough we remand to dismiss [petitioner\u2019s] claims\npursuant to the TIA, we note that the doctrine of comity\nalso militates in favor of dismissal\u201d). Accordingly, we\nleave it to the Tenth Circuit to decide on remand whether\nthe comity argument remains available to Colorado.\n                        *     * *\n  Because the TIA does not bar petitioner\u2019s suit, we re-\nverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Like the\nCourt of Appeals, we express no view on the merits of\nthose claims and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nobjected to a tax credit received by others, but in no way objected to her\nown liability under any revenue-raising tax provision.\u201d 560 U. S., at\n430; accord, id., at 434 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). Because\nwe have already concluded that the TIA does not preclude this chal-\nlenge, it is unnecessary to consider whether and how the narrow rule\nannounced in Hibbs would apply to suits like this one.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

It does\nseem appropriate, and indeed necessary, to add this sepa-\nrate statement concerning what may well be a serious,\ncontinuing injustice faced by Colorado and many other\nStates.\n  Almost half a century ago, this Court determined that,\nunder its Commerce Clause jurisprudence, States cannot\nrequire a business to collect use taxes\u2014which are the\nequivalent of sales taxes for out-of-state purchases\u2014if the\nbusiness does not have a physical presence in the State.\nNational Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill.,\n386 U. S. 753 (1967). Use taxes are still due, but under\nBellas Hess they must be collected from and paid by the\ncustomer, not the out-of-state seller. Id., at 758.\n  Twenty-five years later, the Court relied on stare decisis\nto reaffirm the physical presence requirement and to\nreject attempts to require a mail-order business to collect\nand pay use taxes. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S.\n298, 311 (1992). This was despite the fact that under the\nmore recent and refined test elaborated in Complete Auto\nTransit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), \u201ccontemporary\nCommerce Clause jurisprudence might not dictate the\n2           DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nsame result\u201d as the Court had reached in Bellas Hess.\nQuill Corp., 504 U. S., at 311. In other words, the Quill\nmajority acknowledged the prospect that its conclusion\nwas wrong when the case was decided. Still, the Court\ndetermined vendors who had no physical presence in a\nState did not have the \u201csubstantial nexus with the taxing\nstate\u201d necessary to impose tax-collection duties under the\nCommerce Clause. Id., at 311\u2013313. Three Justices con-\ncurred in the judgment, stating their votes to uphold the\nrule of Bellas Hess were based on stare decisis alone. Id.,\nat 319 (SCALIA, J., joined by KENNEDY, J., and THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). This\nfurther underscores the tenuous nature of that holding\u2014a\nholding now inflicting extreme harm and unfairness on\nthe States.\n  In Quill, the Court should have taken the opportunity to\nreevaluate Bellas Hess not only in light of Complete Auto\nbut also in view of the dramatic technological and social\nchanges that had taken place in our increasingly intercon-\nnected economy. There is a powerful case to be made that\na retailer doing extensive business within a State has a\nsufficiently \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d to justify imposing some\nminor tax-collection duty, even if that business is done\nthrough mail or the Internet. After all, \u201cinterstate com-\nmerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes.\u201d\nD. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 31 (1988).\nThis argument has grown stronger, and the cause more\nurgent, with time. When the Court decided Quill, mail-\norder sales in the United States totaled $180 billion. 504\nU. S., at 329 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part). But in 1992, the Internet was in its infancy. By\n2008, e-commerce sales alone totaled $3.16 trillion per\nyear in the United States. App. 28.\n  Because of Quill and Bellas Hess, States have been\nunable to collect many of the taxes due on these purchases.\nCalifornia, for example, has estimated that it is able to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\ncollect only about 4% of the use taxes due on sales from\nout-of-state vendors. See California State Board of Equal-\nization, Revenue Estimate: Electronic Commerce and Mail\nOrder Sales, Rev. 8/13, p. 7 (2013) (Table 3). The result\nhas been a startling revenue shortfall in many States,\nwith concomitant unfairness to local retailers and their\ncustomers who do pay taxes at the register. The facts of\nthis case exemplify that trend: Colorado\u2019s losses in 2012\nare estimated to be around $170 million. See D. Bruce,\nW. Fox, & L. Luna, State and Local Government Sales Tax\nRevenue Losses from Electronic Commerce 11 (2009)\n(Table 5). States\u2019 education systems, healthcare services,\nand infrastructure are weakened as a result.\n   The Internet has caused far-reaching systemic and\nstructural changes in the economy, and, indeed, in many\nother societal dimensions. Although online businesses\nmay not have a physical presence in some States, the Web\nhas, in many ways, brought the average American closer\nto most major retailers. A connection to a shopper\u2019s favor-\nite store is a click away\u2014regardless of how close or far the\nnearest storefront. See PricewaterhouseCoopers, Under-\nstanding How U. S. Online Shoppers Are Reshaping the\nRetail Experience 3 (Mar. 2012) (nearly 70% of American\nconsumers shopped online in 2011). Today buyers have\nalmost instant access to most retailers via cell phones,\ntablets, and laptops. As a result, a business may be pre-\nsent in a State in a meaningful way without that presence\nbeing physical in the traditional sense of the term.\n   Given these changes in technology and consumer so-\nphistication, it is unwise to delay any longer a reconsider-\nation of the Court\u2019s holding in Quill. A case questionable\neven when decided, Quill now harms States to a degree far\ngreater than could have been anticipated earlier. See\nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233 (2009) (stare\ndecisis weakened where \u201cexperience has pointed up the\nprecedent\u2019s shortcomings\u201d). It should be left in place only\n4           DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v.

S. 88, 105 (2004) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), but more modestly to stop litigants from using\nfederal courts to circumvent States\u2019 \u201cpay without delay,\nthen sue for a refund\u201d regimes. See id., at 104\u2013105 (\u201c[I]n\nenacting the [Tax Injunction Act], Congress trained its\nattention on taxpayers who sought to avoid paying their\ntax bill by pursuing a challenge route other than the one\nspecified by the taxing authority.\u201d). This suit does not\nimplicate that congressional objective. The Direct Market-\ning Association is not challenging its own or anyone else\u2019s\ntax liability or tax collection responsibilities. And the\nclaim is not one likely to be pursued in a state refund\naction. A different question would be posed, however, by a\nsuit to enjoin reporting obligations imposed on a taxpayer\nor tax collector, e.g., an employer or an in-state retailer,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins this opinion with respect to the first ob-\nservation.\n2           DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., concurring\n\nlitigation in lieu of a direct challenge to an \u201cassessment,\u201d\n\u201clevy,\u201d or \u201ccollection.\u201d The Court does not reach today the\nquestion whether the claims in such a suit, i.e., claims\nsuitable for a refund action, are barred by the Tax In-\njunction Act. On that understanding, I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion.\n   Second, the Court\u2019s decision in this case, I emphasize, is\nentirely consistent with our decision in Hibbs. The plain-\ntiffs in Hibbs sought to enjoin certain state tax credits.\nThat suit, like the action here, did not directly challenge\n\u201cacts of assessment, levy, and collection themselves,\u201d ante,\nat 9. See Hibbs, 542 U. S., at 96, 99\u2013102. Moreover, far\nfrom threatening to deplete the State\u2019s coffers, \u201cthe relief\nrequested [in Hibbs] would [have] result[ed] in the state\u2019s\nreceiving more funds that could be used for the public\nbenefit.\u201d Id., at 96 (internal quotation marks omitted;\nemphasis added). Even a suit that somewhat \u201cinhibits\u201d\n\u201cassessment, levy, or collection,\u201d the Court holds today,\nfalls outside the scope of the Tax Injunction Act. Ante, at\n12. That holding casts no shadow on Hibbs\u2019 conclusion\nthat a suit further removed from the Act\u2019s \u201cstate-revenue-\nprotective moorings,\u201d 542 U. S., at 106, remains outside\nthe Act\u2019s scope.\n",

Argued December 8, 2014\u2014Decided March 3, 2015\n     Colorado requires residents who purchase tangible personal prop-\n  erty from a retailer that does not collect sales or use taxes to file a re-\n  turn and remit those taxes directly to the State Department of Reve-\n  nue. To improve compliance, Colorado enacted legislation requiring\n  noncollecting retailers to notify any Colorado customer of the State\u2019s\n  sales and use tax requirement and to report tax-related information\n  to those customers and the Colorado Department of Revenue.\n     Petitioner, a trade association of retailers, many of which sell to\n  Colorado residents but do not collect taxes, sued respondent, the Di-\n  rector of the Colorado Department of Revenue, in Federal District\n  Court, alleging that Colorado\u2019s law violates the United States and\n  Colorado Constitutions. The District Court granted petitioner partial\n  summary judgment and permanently enjoined enforcement of the no-\n  tice and reporting requirements, but the Tenth Circuit reversed.\n  That court held that the Tax Injunction Act (TIA), which provides\n  that federal district courts \u201cshall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the\n  assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a\n  plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such\n  State,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71341, deprived the District Court of jurisdiction\n  over the suit.\nHeld: Petitioner\u2019s suit is not barred by the TIA. Pp. 4\u201313.\n    (a) The relief sought by petitioner would not \u201cenjoin, suspend or re-\n strain the assessment, levy or collection\u201d of Colorado\u2019s sales and use\n taxes. Pp. 4\u201312.\n      (1) The terms \u201cassessment,\u201d \u201clevy,\u201d and \u201ccollection\u201d do not en-\n2                DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    compass Colorado\u2019s enforcement of its notice and reporting require-\n    ments. These terms, read in light of the Federal Tax Code, refer to\n    discrete phases of the taxation process that do not include informa-\n    tional notices or private reports of information relevant to tax liabil-\n    ity. Information gathering has long been treated as a phase of tax\n    administration that occurs before assessment, levy, or collection.\n    See, e.g., 26 U. S. C. \u00a76041 et seq. Respondent portrays the notice\n    and reporting requirements as part of the State\u2019s assessment and col-\n    lection process, but the State\u2019s assessment and collection procedures\n    are triggered after the State has received the returns and made the\n    deficiency determinations that the notice and reporting requirements\n    are meant to facilitate. Enforcement of the requirements may im-\n    prove the State\u2019s ability to assess and ultimately collect its sales and\n    use taxes, but the TIA is not keyed to all such activities. Such a rule\n    would be inconsistent with the statute\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s rule fa-\n    voring clear boundaries in the interpretation of jurisdictional stat-\n    utes. See Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. 77, 94. Pp. 5\u20139.\n         (2) Petitioner\u2019s suit cannot be understood to \u201crestrain\u201d the \u201cas-\n    sessment, levy or collection\u201d of Colorado\u2019s sales and use taxes merely\n    because it may inhibit those activities. While the word \u201crestrain\u201d can\n    be defined as broadly as the Tenth Circuit defined it, it also has a\n    narrower meaning used in equity, which captures only those orders\n    that stop acts of assessment, levy, or collection. The context in which\n    the TIA uses the word \u201crestrain\u201d resolves this ambiguity in favor of\n    this narrower meaning. First, the verbs accompanying \u201crestrain\u201d\u2014\n    \u201cenjoin\u201d and \u201csuspend\u201d\u2014are terms of art in equity and refer to differ-\n    ent equitable remedies that restrict or stop official action, strongly\n    suggesting that \u201crestrain\u201d does the same. Additionally, \u201crestrain\u201d\n    acts on \u201cassessment,\u201d \u201clevy,\u201d and \u201ccollection,\u201d a carefully selected list\n    of technical terms. The Tenth Circuit\u2019s broad meaning would defeat\n    the precision of that list and render many of those terms surplusage.\n    Assigning \u201crestrain\u201d its meaning in equity is also consistent with this\n    Court\u2019s recognition that the TIA \u201chas its roots in equity practice,\u201d\n    Tully v. Griffin, Inc., 429 U. S. 68, 73, and with the principle that\n    \u201c[j]urisdictional rules should be clear,\u201d Grable & Sons Metal Prod-\n    ucts, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 321 (THOMAS,\n    J., concurring). Pp. 10\u201312.\n       (b) The Court takes no position on whether a suit such as this\n    might be barred under the \u201ccomity doctrine,\u201d which \u201ccounsels lower\n    federal courts to resist engagement in certain cases falling within\n    their jurisdiction,\u201d Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U. S. 413,\n    421. The Court leaves it to the Tenth Circuit to decide on remand\n    whether the comity argument remains available to Colorado.

We\nmust decide whether the Tax Injunction Act, which pro-\nvides that federal district courts \u201cshall not enjoin, suspend\nor restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax\nunder State law,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71341, bars a suit to enjoin\nthe enforcement of this law. We hold that it does not.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  Like many States, Colorado has a complementary sales-\nand-use tax regime. Colorado imposes both a 2.9 percent\ntax on the sale of tangible personal property within the\nState, Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a739\u201326\u2013104(1)(a), 39\u201326\u2013106(1)\n(a)(II) (2014), and an equivalent use tax for any prop-\nerty stored, used, or consumed in Colorado on which a\n2           DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsales tax was not paid to a retailer, \u00a7\u00a739\u201326\u2013202(1)(b), 39\u2013\n26\u2013204(1). Retailers with a physical presence in Colorado\nmust collect the sales or use tax from consumers at the\npoint of sale and remit the proceeds to the Colorado De-\npartment of Revenue (Department). \u00a7\u00a739\u201326\u2013105(1), 39\u2013\n26\u2013106(2)(a). But under our negative Commerce Clause\nprecedents, Colorado may not require retailers who lack a\nphysical presence in the State to collect these taxes on\nbehalf of the Department. See Quill Corp. v. North Da-\nkota, 504 U. S. 298, 315\u2013318 (1992). Thus, Colorado re-\nquires its consumers who purchase tangible personal\nproperty from a retailer that does not collect these taxes (a\n\u201cnoncollecting retailer\u201d) to fill out a return and remit the\ntaxes to the Department directly. \u00a739\u201326\u2013204(1).\n    Voluntary compliance with the latter requirement is\nrelatively low, leading to a significant loss of tax revenue,\nespecially as Internet retailers have increasingly displaced\ntheir brick-and-mortar kin. In the decade before this suit\nwas filed in 2010, e-commerce more than tripled. App. 28.\nWith approximately 25 percent of taxes unpaid on Inter-\nnet sales, Colorado estimated in 2010 that its revenue loss\nattributable to noncompliance would grow by more than\n$20 million each year. App. 30\u201331.\n    In hopes of stopping this trend, Colorado enacted legis-\nlation in 2010 imposing notice and reporting obligations\non noncollecting retailers whose gross sales in Colorado\nexceed $100,000. Three provisions of that Act, along with\ntheir implementing regulations, are at issue here.\n    First, noncollecting retailers must \u201cnotify Colorado\npurchasers that sales or use tax is due on certain purchases\n. . . and that the state of Colorado requires the purchaser\nto file a sales or use tax return.\u201d \u00a739\u201321\u2013112(3.5)(c)(I);\nsee also 1 Colo.

It must also\ncontain a notice stating that Colorado \u201crequires a sales or\nuse tax return to be filed and sales or use tax paid on\ncertain Colorado purchases made by the purchaser from\nthe retailer.\u201d Colo.

As a result,\nthey are subject to Colorado\u2019s notice and reporting\nrequirements.\n   In 2010, Direct Marketing Association brought suit in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Colo-\nrado against the Executive Director of the Department,\nalleging that the notice and reporting requirements violate\nprovisions of the United States and Colorado Constitu-\ntions. As relevant here, Direct Marketing Association\nalleged that the provisions (1) discriminate against inter-\nstate commerce and (2) impose undue burdens on inter-\nstate commerce, all in violation of this Court\u2019s negative\nCommerce Clause precedents. At the request of both\nparties, the District Court stayed all challenges except\nthese two, in order to facilitate expedited consideration. It\nthen granted partial summary judgment to Direct Market-\ning Association and permanently enjoined enforcement of\nthe notice and reporting requirements. App. to Pet. for\nCert. B\u20131 to B\u201325.\n   Exercising appellate jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71292(a)(1), the United States Court of Appeals for the\nTenth Circuit reversed. Without reaching the merits, the\nCourt of Appeals held that the District Court lacked juris-\ndiction over the suit because of the Tax Injunction Act\n(TIA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a71341. Acknowledging that the suit\n\u201cdiffers from the prototypical TIA case,\u201d the Court of Ap-\npeals nevertheless found it barred by the TIA because, if\nsuccessful, it \u201cwould limit, restrict, or hold back the state\u2019s\nchosen method of enforcing its tax laws and generating\nrevenue.\u201d 735 F. 3d 904, 913 (2013).\n   We granted certiorari, 573 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nreverse.\n                            II\n    Enacted in 1937, the TIA provides that federal district\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

The question before us is\nwhether the relief sought here would \u201cenjoin, suspend or\nrestrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under\nState law.\u201d Because we conclude that it would not, we\nneed not consider whether \u201ca plain, speedy and efficient\nremedy may be had in the courts of \u201d Colorado.\n                              A\n  The District Court enjoined state officials from enforcing\nthe notice and reporting requirements. Because an in-\njunction is clearly a form of equitable relief barred by the\nTIA, the question becomes whether the enforcement of the\nnotice and reporting requirements is an act of \u201cassess-\nment, levy or collection.\u201d We need not comprehensively\ndefine these terms to conclude that they do not encompass\nenforcement of the notice and reporting requirements at\nissue.\n  In defining the terms of the TIA, we have looked to\nfederal tax law as a guide. See, e.g., Hibbs v. Winn, 542\nU. S. 88, 100 (2004). Although the TIA does not concern\nfederal taxes, it was modeled on the Anti-Injunction Act\n(AIA), which does. See Jefferson County v. Acker, 527\nU. S. 423, 434\u2013435 (1999). The AIA provides in relevant\npart that \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the as-\nsessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in\nany court by any person.\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a77421(a). We as-\nsume that words used in both Acts are generally used in\nthe same way, and we discern the meaning of the terms in\nthe AIA by reference to the broader Tax Code. Hibbs,\nsupra, at 102\u2013105; id., at 115 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\nRead in light of the Federal Tax Code at the time the TIA\nwas enacted (as well as today), these three terms refer to\ndiscrete phases of the taxation process that do not include\n6            DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninformational notices or private reports of information\nrelevant to tax liability.\n   To begin, the Federal Tax Code has long treated infor-\nmation gathering as a phase of tax administration proce-\ndure that occurs before assessment, levy, or collection.\nSee \u00a7\u00a76001\u20136117; \u00a7\u00a71500\u20131524 (1934 ed.); see also \u00a71533\n(\u201cAll provisions of law for the ascertainment of liability to\nany tax, or the assessment or collection thereof, shall be\nheld to apply . . . \u201d). This step includes private reporting of\ninformation used to determine tax liability, see, e.g.,\n\u00a71511(a), including reports by third parties who do not\nowe the tax, see, e.g., \u00a76041 et seq. (2012 ed.); see also\n\u00a7\u00a71512(a)\u2013(b) (1934 ed.) (authorizing a collector or the\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue, when a taxpayer fails\nto file a return, to make a return \u201cfrom his own knowledge\nand from such information as he can obtain through tes-\ntimony or otherwise\u201d).\n   \u201cAssessment\u201d is the next step in the process, and it\nrefers to the official recording of a taxpayer\u2019s liability,\nwhich occurs after information relevant to the calculation\nof that liability is reported to the taxing authority. See\n\u00a71530. In Hibbs, the Court noted that \u201cassessment,\u201d as\nused in the Internal Revenue Code, \u201cinvolves a \u2018recording\u2019\nof the amount the taxpayer owes the Government.\u201d 542\nU. S., at 100 (quoting \u00a76203 (2000 ed.)). It might also be\nunderstood more broadly to encompass the process by\nwhich that amount is calculated. See United States v.\nGalletti, 541 U. S. 114, 122 (2004); see also Hibbs, supra,\nat 100, n. 3. But even understood more broadly, \u201cassess-\nment\u201d has long been treated in the Tax Code as an official\naction taken based on information already reported to the\ntaxing authority. For example, not many years before it\npassed the TIA, Congress passed a law providing that the\nfiling of a return would start the running of the clock for a\ntimely assessment. See, e.g., Revenue Act of 1924, Pub. L.\n68\u2013176, \u00a7277(a), 43 Stat. 299. Thus, assessment was\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nunderstood as a step in the taxation process that occurred\nafter, and was distinct from, the step of reporting infor-\nmation pertaining to tax liability.\n    \u201cLevy,\u201d at least as it is defined in the Federal Tax Code,\nrefers to a specific mode of collection under which the\nSecretary of the Treasury distrains and seizes a recalci-\ntrant taxpayer\u2019s property. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a76331 (2012\ned.); \u00a71582 (1934 ed.). Because the word \u201clevy\u201d does not\nappear in the AIA, however, one could argue that its\nmeaning in the TIA is not tied to the meaning of the term\nas used in federal tax law. If that were the case, one\nmight look to contemporaneous dictionaries, which defined\n\u201clevy\u201d as the legislative function of laying or imposing a\ntax and the executive functions of assessing, recording,\nand collecting the amount a taxpayer owes. See Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1093 (3d ed. 1933) (Black\u2019s); see also\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1423 (2d ed.\n1939) (\u201cTo raise or collect, as by assessment, execution, or\nother legal process, etc.; to exact or impose by authority\n. . . \u201d); \u00a7\u00a71540, 1544 (using \u201clevying\u201d and \u201clevied\u201d in the\nmore general sense of an executive imposition of a tax\nliability). But under any of these definitions, \u201clevy\u201d would\nbe limited to an official governmental action imposing,\ndetermining the amount of, or securing payment on a tax.\n    Finally, \u201ccollection\u201d is the act of obtaining payment of\ntaxes due. See Black\u2019s 349 (defining \u201ccollect\u201d as \u201cto obtain\npayment or liquidation\u201d of a debt or claim). It might be\nunderstood narrowly as a step in the taxation process that\noccurs after a formal assessment. Consistent with this\nunderstanding, we have previously described it as part of\nthe \u201cenforcement process . . . that \u2018assessment\u2019 sets in\nmotion.\u201d Hibbs, supra, at 102, n. 4. The Federal Tax Code\nat the time the TIA was enacted provided for the Commis-\nsioner of Internal Revenue to certify a list of assessments\n\u201cto the proper collectors . . . who [would] proceed to collect\nand account for the taxes and penalties so certified.\u201d\n8            DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71531. That collection process began with the collector\n\u201cgiv[ing] notice to each person liable to pay any taxes\nstated [in the list] . . . stating the amount of such taxes\nand demanding payment thereof.\u201d \u00a71545(a). When a\nperson failed to pay, the Government had various means\nto collect the amount due, including liens, \u00a71560, distraint,\n\u00a71580, forfeiture, and other legal proceedings, \u00a71640.\nToday\u2019s Tax Code continues to authorize collection of taxes\nby these methods. \u00a76302 (2012 ed.). \u201cCollection\u201d might\nalso be understood more broadly to encompass the receipt\nof a tax payment before a formal assessment occurs. For\nexample, at the time the TIA was enacted, the Tax Code\nprovided for the assessment of money already received by\na person \u201crequired to collect or withhold any internal-\nrevenue tax from any other person,\u201d suggesting that at\nleast some act of collection might occur before a formal\nassessment. \u00a71551 (1934 ed.) (emphasis added). Either\nway, \u201ccollection\u201d is a separate step in the taxation process\nfrom assessment and the reporting on which assessment is\nbased.\n   So defined, these terms do not encompass Colorado\u2019s\nenforcement of its notice and reporting requirements. The\nExecutive Director does not seriously contend that the\nprovisions at issue here involve a \u201clevy\u201d; instead she por-\ntrays them as part of the process of assessment and collec-\ntion. But the notice and reporting requirements precede\nthe steps of \u201cassessment\u201d and \u201ccollection.\u201d The notice\ngiven to Colorado consumers, for example, informs them of\ntheir use-tax liability and prompts them to keep a record\nof taxable purchases that they will report to the State at\nsome future point. The annual summary that the retailers\nsend to consumers provides them with a reminder of that\nuse-tax liability and the information they need to fill out\ntheir annual returns. And the report the retailers file\nwith the Department facilitates audits to determine tax\ndeficiencies. After each of these notices or reports is filed,\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe State still needs to take further action to assess the\ntaxpayer\u2019s use-tax liability and to collect payment from\nhim. See Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a739\u201326\u2013204(3) (describing the\nprocedure for \u201cassessing and collecting [use] taxes\u201d on the\nbasis of returns filed by consumers and collecting retail-\ners). Colorado law provides for specific assessment and\ncollection procedures that are triggered after the State has\nreceived the returns and made the deficiency determina-\ntions that the notice and reporting requirements are\nmeant to facilitate. See \u00a739\u201326\u2013210; 1 Colo. Code Regs.\n\u00a7201\u20131:39\u201321\u2013107(1) (\u201cThe statute of limitations on as-\nsessments of . . . sales [and] use . . . tax . . . shall be three\nyears from the date the return was filed . . . \u201d).\n   Enforcement of the notice and reporting requirements\nmay improve Colorado\u2019s ability to assess and ultimately\ncollect its sales and use taxes from consumers, but the TIA\nis not keyed to all activities that may improve a State\u2019s\nability to assess and collect taxes. Such a rule would be\ninconsistent not only with the text of the statute, but also\nwith our rule favoring clear boundaries in the interpreta-\ntion of jurisdictional statutes. See Hertz Corp. v. Friend,\n559 U. S. 77, 94 (2010). The TIA is keyed to the acts of\nassessment, levy, and collection themselves, and enforce-\nment of the notice and reporting requirements is none of\nthese.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Our decision in California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U. S. 393\n\n(1982), is not to the contrary. In that case, California churches and\nreligious schools sought \u201cto enjoin the State from collecting both tax\ninformation and the state [unemployment] tax,\u201d based, in part, on the\nargument that \u201crecordkeeping, registration, and reporting require-\nments\u201d violate the Establishment Clause by creating the potential for\nexcessive entanglement with religion. Id., at 398, 415. We held that\nthe TIA barred that suit. Id., at 396. But nowhere in their brief to this\nCourt did the plaintiffs in Grace Brethren Church separate out their\nrequest to enjoin the tax from their request for relief from the record-\nkeeping and reporting requirements. See Brief for Grace Brethren\nChurch et al., in California v. Grace Brethren Church, O. T. 1981, No.\n10            DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               B\n\n   Apparently concluding that enforcement of the notice\nand reporting requirements was not itself an act of \u201cas-\nsessment, levy or collection,\u201d the Court of Appeals did not\nrely on those terms to hold that the TIA barred the suit.\nInstead, it adopted a broad definition of the word \u201cre-\nstrain\u201d in the TIA, which bars not only suits to \u201cenjoin . . .\nassessment, levy or collection\u201d of a state tax but also suits\nto \u201csuspend or restrain\u201d those activities. Specifically, the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the TIA bars any suit\nthat would \u201climit, restrict, or hold back\u201d the assessment,\nlevy, or collection of state taxes. 735 F. 3d, at 913. Be-\ncause the notice and reporting requirements are intended\nto facilitate collection of taxes, the Court of Appeals rea-\nsoned that the relief Direct Marketing Association sought\nand received would \u201climit, restrict, or hold back\u201d the De-\npartment\u2019s collection efforts. That was error.\n   \u201cRestrain,\u201d standing alone, can have several meanings.\nOne is the broad meaning given by the Court of Appeals,\nwhich captures orders that merely inhibit acts of \u201cassess-\nment, levy and collection.\u201d See Black\u2019s 1548. Another,\nnarrower meaning, however, is \u201c[t]o prohibit from action;\nto put compulsion upon . . . to enjoin,\u201d ibid., which cap-\ntures only those orders that stop (or perhaps compel) acts\nof \u201cassessment, levy and collection.\u201d\n   To resolve this ambiguity, we look to the context in\nwhich the word is used. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 341 (1997). The statutory context provides\nseveral clues that lead us to conclude that the TIA uses\nthe word \u201crestrain\u201d in its narrower sense. Looking to the\ncompany \u201crestrain\u201d keeps, Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co.,\n367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961), we first note that the words\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n81\u201331 etc., pp. 34\u201338. Grace Brethren Church thus cannot fairly be\n\nread as resolving, or even considering, the question presented in this \n\ncase. \n\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cenjoin\u201d and \u201csuspend\u201d are terms of art in equity, see Fair\nAssessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S.\n100, 126, and n. 13 (1981) (Brennan, J., concurring). They\nrefer to different equitable remedies that restrict or stop\nofficial action to varying degrees, strongly suggesting that\n\u201crestrain\u201d does the same. See Hibbs, 524 U. S., at 118\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting); see also Jefferson County, 572\nU. S., at 433.\n   Additionally, as used in the TIA, \u201crestrain\u201d acts on a\ncarefully selected list of technical terms\u2014\u201cassessment,\nlevy, collection\u201d\u2014not on an all-encompassing term, like\n\u201ctaxation.\u201d To give \u201crestrain\u201d the broad meaning selected\nby the Court of Appeals would be to defeat the precision of\nthat list, as virtually any court action related to any phase\nof taxation might be said to \u201chold back\u201d \u201ccollection.\u201d Such\na broad construction would thus render \u201cassessment [and]\nlevy\u201d\u2014not to mention \u201cenjoin [and] suspend\u201d\u2014mere sur-\nplusage, a result we try to avoid. See Hibbs, supra, at 101\n(interpreting the terms of the TIA to avoid superfluity).\n   Assigning the word \u201crestrain\u201d its meaning in equity is\nalso consistent with our recognition that the TIA \u201chas its\nroots in equity practice.\u201d Tully v. Griffin, Inc., 429 U. S.\n68, 73 (1976). Under the comity doctrine that the TIA\npartially codifies, Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560\nU. S. 413, 431\u2013432 (2010), courts of equity exercised their\n\u201csound discretion\u201d to withhold certain forms of extraordi-\nnary relief, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman,\n319 U. S. 293, 297 (1943); see also Dows v. Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88307\"><a href=\"/opinion/88307/dows-v-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110 (1871). Even while refusing to grant cer-\ntain forms of equitable relief, those courts did not refuse to\nhear every suit that would have a negative impact on\nStates\u2019 revenues. See, e.g., Henrietta Mills v. Rutherford\nCounty, 281 U. S. 121, 127 (1930); see also 5 R. Paul & J.\nMertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a742.139 (1934)\n(discussing the word \u201crestraining\u201d in the AIA in its equi-\ntable sense). The Court of Appeals\u2019 definition of \u201crestrain,\u201d\n12             DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever, leads the TIA to bar every suit with such a nega-\ntive impact. This history thus further supports the con-\nclusion that Congress used \u201crestrain\u201d in its narrower,\nequitable sense, rather than in the broad sense chosen by\nthe Court of Appeals.\n   Finally, adopting a narrower definition is consistent\nwith the rule that \u201c[j]urisdictional rules should be clear.\u201d\nGrable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering\n& Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 321 (2005) (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring); see also Hertz Corp., supra, at 94. The question\u2014at\nleast for negative injunctions\u2014is whether the relief to\nsome degree stops \u201cassessment, levy or collection,\u201d not\nwhether it merely inhibits them. The Court of Appeals\u2019\ndefinition of \u201crestrain,\u201d by contrast, produces a \u201c \u2018vague\nand obscure\u2019 \u201d boundary that would result in both needless\nlitigation and uncalled-for dismissal, Sisson v. Ruby, 497\nU. S. 358, 375 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment),\nall in the name of a jurisdictional statute meant to protect\nstate resources.\n   Applying the correct definition, a suit cannot be under-\nstood to \u201crestrain\u201d the \u201cassessment, levy or collection\u201d of a\nstate tax if it merely inhibits those activities.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Because the text of the TIA resolves this case, we decline the par-\n\nties\u2019 invitation to derive various per se rules from our decision in Hibbs\nv. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (2004). In Hibbs, the Court held that the TIA did\nnot bar an Establishment Clause challenge to a state tax credit for\ncharitable donations to organizations that provided scholarships for\nchildren to attend parochial schools. Id., at 94\u201396. Direct Marketing\nAssociation argues that Hibbs stands for the proposition that the TIA\nhas no application to third-party suits by nontaxpayers who do not\nchallenge their own liability. Brief for Petitioner 18\u201321. The Executive\nDirector acknowledges that Hibbs created an exception to the TIA, but\nargues that the exception does not apply to suits that restrain activities\nthat have a collection-propelling function. Brief for Respondent 25\u201333.\n   In Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U. S. 413 (2010), we empha-\nsized the narrow reach of Hibbs, explaining that it was not \u201ca run-of-\nthe-mine tax case,\u201d 560 U. S., at 430. As we explained, Hibbs held only\n\u201cthat the TIA did not preclude a federal challenge by a third party who\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              III\n\n   We take no position on whether a suit such as this one\nmight nevertheless be barred under the \u201ccomity doctrine,\u201d\nwhich \u201ccounsels lower federal courts to resist engagement\nin certain cases falling within their jurisdiction.\u201d Levin,\nsupra, at 421. Under this doctrine, federal courts refrain\nfrom \u201cinterfer[ing] . . . with the fiscal operations of the\nstate governments . . . in all cases where the Federal\nrights of the persons could otherwise be preserved unim-\npaired. \u201d Id., at 422 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Unlike the TIA, the comity doctrine is nonjurisdictional.\nAnd here, Colorado did not seek comity from either of the\ncourts below. Moreover, we do not understand the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 footnote concerning comity to be a holding that\ncomity compels dismissal. See 735 F. 3d, at 920, n. 11\n(\u201cAlthough we remand to dismiss [petitioner\u2019s] claims\npursuant to the TIA, we note that the doctrine of comity\nalso militates in favor of dismissal\u201d). Accordingly, we\nleave it to the Tenth Circuit to decide on remand whether\nthe comity argument remains available to Colorado.\n                        *     * *\n  Because the TIA does not bar petitioner\u2019s suit, we re-\nverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Like the\nCourt of Appeals, we express no view on the merits of\nthose claims and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nobjected to a tax credit received by others, but in no way objected to her\nown liability under any revenue-raising tax provision.\u201d 560 U. S., at\n430; accord, id., at 434 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). Because\nwe have already concluded that the TIA does not preclude this chal-\nlenge, it is unnecessary to consider whether and how the narrow rule\nannounced in Hibbs would apply to suits like this one.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

It does\nseem appropriate, and indeed necessary, to add this sepa-\nrate statement concerning what may well be a serious,\ncontinuing injustice faced by Colorado and many other\nStates.\n  Almost half a century ago, this Court determined that,\nunder its Commerce Clause jurisprudence, States cannot\nrequire a business to collect use taxes\u2014which are the\nequivalent of sales taxes for out-of-state purchases\u2014if the\nbusiness does not have a physical presence in the State.\nNational Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill.,\n386 U. S. 753 (1967). Use taxes are still due, but under\nBellas Hess they must be collected from and paid by the\ncustomer, not the out-of-state seller. Id., at 758.\n  Twenty-five years later, the Court relied on stare decisis\nto reaffirm the physical presence requirement and to\nreject attempts to require a mail-order business to collect\nand pay use taxes. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S.\n298, 311 (1992). This was despite the fact that under the\nmore recent and refined test elaborated in Complete Auto\nTransit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), \u201ccontemporary\nCommerce Clause jurisprudence might not dictate the\n2           DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nsame result\u201d as the Court had reached in Bellas Hess.\nQuill Corp., 504 U. S., at 311. In other words, the Quill\nmajority acknowledged the prospect that its conclusion\nwas wrong when the case was decided. Still, the Court\ndetermined vendors who had no physical presence in a\nState did not have the \u201csubstantial nexus with the taxing\nstate\u201d necessary to impose tax-collection duties under the\nCommerce Clause. Id., at 311\u2013313. Three Justices con-\ncurred in the judgment, stating their votes to uphold the\nrule of Bellas Hess were based on stare decisis alone. Id.,\nat 319 (SCALIA, J., joined by KENNEDY, J., and THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). This\nfurther underscores the tenuous nature of that holding\u2014a\nholding now inflicting extreme harm and unfairness on\nthe States.\n  In Quill, the Court should have taken the opportunity to\nreevaluate Bellas Hess not only in light of Complete Auto\nbut also in view of the dramatic technological and social\nchanges that had taken place in our increasingly intercon-\nnected economy. There is a powerful case to be made that\na retailer doing extensive business within a State has a\nsufficiently \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d to justify imposing some\nminor tax-collection duty, even if that business is done\nthrough mail or the Internet. After all, \u201cinterstate com-\nmerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes.\u201d\nD. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 31 (1988).\nThis argument has grown stronger, and the cause more\nurgent, with time. When the Court decided Quill, mail-\norder sales in the United States totaled $180 billion. 504\nU. S., at 329 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part). But in 1992, the Internet was in its infancy. By\n2008, e-commerce sales alone totaled $3.16 trillion per\nyear in the United States. App. 28.\n  Because of Quill and Bellas Hess, States have been\nunable to collect many of the taxes due on these purchases.\nCalifornia, for example, has estimated that it is able to\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

See California State Board of Equal-\nization, Revenue Estimate: Electronic Commerce and Mail\nOrder Sales, Rev. 8/13, p. 7 (2013) (Table 3). The result\nhas been a startling revenue shortfall in many States,\nwith concomitant unfairness to local retailers and their\ncustomers who do pay taxes at the register. The facts of\nthis case exemplify that trend: Colorado\u2019s losses in 2012\nare estimated to be around $170 million. See D. Bruce,\nW. Fox, & L. Luna, State and Local Government Sales Tax\nRevenue Losses from Electronic Commerce 11 (2009)\n(Table 5). States\u2019 education systems, healthcare services,\nand infrastructure are weakened as a result.\n   The Internet has caused far-reaching systemic and\nstructural changes in the economy, and, indeed, in many\nother societal dimensions. Although online businesses\nmay not have a physical presence in some States, the Web\nhas, in many ways, brought the average American closer\nto most major retailers. A connection to a shopper\u2019s favor-\nite store is a click away\u2014regardless of how close or far the\nnearest storefront. See PricewaterhouseCoopers, Under-\nstanding How U. S. Online Shoppers Are Reshaping the\nRetail Experience 3 (Mar. 2012) (nearly 70% of American\nconsumers shopped online in 2011). Today buyers have\nalmost instant access to most retailers via cell phones,\ntablets, and laptops. As a result, a business may be pre-\nsent in a State in a meaningful way without that presence\nbeing physical in the traditional sense of the term.\n   Given these changes in technology and consumer so-\nphistication, it is unwise to delay any longer a reconsider-\nation of the Court\u2019s holding in Quill. A case questionable\neven when decided, Quill now harms States to a degree far\ngreater than could have been anticipated earlier. See\nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233 (2009) (stare\ndecisis weakened where \u201cexperience has pointed up the\nprecedent\u2019s shortcomings\u201d). It should be left in place only\n4           DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nif a powerful showing can be made that its rationale is still\ncorrect.\n   The instant case does not raise this issue in a manner\nappropriate for the Court to address it. It does provide,\nhowever, the means to note the importance of reconsider-\ning doubtful authority. The legal system should find an\nappropriate case for this Court to reexamine Quill and\nBellas Hess.\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  1\n\n                      GINSBURG, J., concurring\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n                             _________________\n\n                            No. 13\u20131032\n                             _________________\n\n\nDIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION, PETITIONER v. \n\n    BARBARA BROHL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, \n\n     COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                           [March 3, 2015] \n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,\nconcurring.*\n  I write separately to make two observations.\n  First, as the Court has observed, Congress designed the\nTax Injunction Act not \u201cto prevent federal-court interfer-\nence with all aspects of state tax administration,\u201d Hibbs v.\nWinn, 542 U. S. 88, 105 (2004) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), but more modestly to stop litigants from using\nfederal courts to circumvent States\u2019 \u201cpay without delay,\nthen sue for a refund\u201d regimes. See id., at 104\u2013105 (\u201c[I]n\nenacting the [Tax Injunction Act], Congress trained its\nattention on taxpayers who sought to avoid paying their\ntax bill by pursuing a challenge route other than the one\nspecified by the taxing authority.\u201d). This suit does not\nimplicate that congressional objective. The Direct Market-\ning Association is not challenging its own or anyone else\u2019s\ntax liability or tax collection responsibilities. And the\nclaim is not one likely to be pursued in a state refund\naction. A different question would be posed, however, by a\nsuit to enjoin reporting obligations imposed on a taxpayer\nor tax collector, e.g., an employer or an in-state retailer,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins this opinion with respect to the first ob-\nservation.\n2           DIRECT MARKETING ASSN. v. BROHL\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., concurring\n\nlitigation in lieu of a direct challenge to an \u201cassessment,\u201d\n\u201clevy,\u201d or \u201ccollection.\u201d The Court does not reach today the\nquestion whether the claims in such a suit, i.e., claims\nsuitable for a refund action, are barred by the Tax In-\njunction Act. On that understanding, I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion.\n   Second, the Court\u2019s decision in this case, I emphasize, is\nentirely consistent with our decision in Hibbs. The plain-\ntiffs in Hibbs sought to enjoin certain state tax credits.\nThat suit, like the action here, did not directly challenge\n\u201cacts of assessment, levy, and collection themselves,\u201d ante,\nat 9. See Hibbs, 542 U. S., at 96, 99\u2013102. Moreover, far\nfrom threatening to deplete the State\u2019s coffers, \u201cthe relief\nrequested [in Hibbs] would [have] result[ed] in the state\u2019s\nreceiving more funds that could be used for the public\nbenefit.\u201d Id., at 96 (internal quotation marks omitted;\nemphasis added). Even a suit that somewhat \u201cinhibits\u201d\n\u201cassessment, levy, or collection,\u201d the Court holds today,\nfalls outside the scope of the Tax Injunction Act. Ante, at\n12. That holding casts no shadow on Hibbs\u2019 conclusion\nthat a suit further removed from the Act\u2019s \u201cstate-revenue-\nprotective moorings,\u201d 542 U. S., at 106, remains outside\nthe Act\u2019s scope.\n</pre>",
