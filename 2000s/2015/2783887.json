CSX\n           TRANSPORTATION, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 13–553.      Argued December 9, 2014—Decided March 4, 2015\nAlabama imposes sales and use taxes on railroads when they purchase\n  or consume diesel fuel, but exempts from those taxes trucking\n  transport companies (motor carriers) and companies that transport\n  goods interstate through navigable waters (water carriers), both rail-\n  road competitors. Motor carriers pay an alternative fuel-excise tax\n  on diesel, but water carriers pay neither the sales tax nor the excise\n  tax. Respondent (CSX), an interstate rail carrier that operates in Al-\n  abama, sought to enjoin state officers from collecting sales tax on its\n  diesel fuel purchases, claiming that the State’s asymmetrical tax\n  treatment “discriminates against a rail carrier” in violation of the\n  Railroad Revitalization and Regulation Reform Act of 1976, or 4–R\n  Act, 49 U. S. C. §11501(b)(4). This Court held that a tax “discrimi-\n  nates” under subsection (b)(4) when it treats “groups [that] are simi-\n  larly situated” differently without sufficient “justification for the dif-\n  ference in treatment,” CSX Transp. v. Ala. Dept. of Revenue, 562\n  U. S. 277, 287 (CSX I). On remand, the District Court rejected CSX’s\n  claim. Reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that CSX could establish\n  discrimination by showing that Alabama taxed rail carriers different-\n  ly than their competitors, but rejected Alabama’s argument that im-\n  posing a fuel-excise tax on motor carriers, but not rail carriers, justi-\n  fied imposing the sales tax on rail carriers, but not motor carriers.\nHeld:\n    1. The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded that CSX’s competitors\n are an appropriate comparison class for its subsection (b)(4) claim.\n    All general and commercial taxpayers may be an appropriate com-\n parison class for a subsection (b)(4) claim, but it is not the only one.\n Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word “discrimination” sug-\n2        ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    gests that it occurs only when the victim is singled out relative to the\n    population at large. Context confirms this reading. The 4–R Act is\n    an “asymmetrical statute.” CSX I, supra, at 296. In subsections\n    (b)(1) to (b)(3)—which specify prohibitions directed toward property\n    taxes—the comparison class is limited to commercial and industrial\n    property in the same assessment jurisdiction. But subsection (b)(4)\n    contains no such limitation, so the comparison class is to be deter-\n    mined based on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.\n    Thus, when a railroad alleges that a tax disadvantages it compared\n    to its transportation industry competitors, its competitors in that ju-\n    risdiction are the comparison class. Because subsection (b)(4) re-\n    quires a showing of discrimination, however, the comparison class\n    must consist of individuals similarly situated to the claimant.\n       Subsection (b)(4) would be deprived of all real-world effect if “simi-\n    larly situated” were given the same narrow construction the concept\n    has in the Equal Protection Clause context, where it would be per-\n    missible for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a motor carrier,\n    despite their seemingly similar lines of business. The category of\n    “similarly situated” (b)(4) comparison classes must at least include\n    the commercial and industrial taxpayers specified in the other sub-\n    sections. But it also can include a railroad’s competitors. Discrimi-\n    nation in favor of that class both falls within the ordinary meaning of\n    “discrimination” and frustrates the 4–R Act’s purpose of “restor[ing]\n    the financial stability of the [Nation’s] railway system” while “fos-\n    ter[ing] competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes\n    of transportation,” 90 Stat. 33. Contrary to Alabama’s argument,\n    normal rules of interpretation would say that the explicit limitation\n    to “commercial and industrial” in the first three provisions, and its\n    absence in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation applies to the\n    fourth. Alabama’s additional arguments are also unavailing. Pp. 4–\n    8.\n       2. The Eleventh Circuit erred in refusing to consider whether Ala-\n    bama could justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales\n    and use taxes through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-\n    excise tax. It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say that\n    a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt\n    from that tax must pay another comparable tax from which the rail\n    carrier is exempt, since both competitors could then claim to be dis-\n    criminated against relative to each other. The Court’s negative\n    Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that an additional\n    tax on third parties may justify an otherwise discriminatory tax.\n    Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U. S. 472, 479–480. Similarly, an al-\n    ternative, roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification that\n    renders a tax disparity non-discriminatory. CSX’s counterarguments\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  are rejected. On remand, the Eleventh Circuit is to consider whether\n  Alabama’s fuel-excise tax is the rough equivalent of Alabama’s sales\n  tax as applied to diesel fuel, and therefore justifies the motor carrier\n  sales-tax exemption. Although the State cannot offer a similar de-\n  fense with respect to its water carrier exemption, the court should al-\n  so examine whether any of the State’s alternative rationales justify\n  that exemption.

S. C.\n§11501(b)(4). We are asked to decide whether a State\nviolates this prohibition by taxing diesel fuel purchases\nmade by a rail carrier while exempting similar purchases\nmade by its competitors; and if so, whether the violation is\neliminated when other tax provisions offset the challenged\ntreatment of railroads.\n                                          I\n   Alabama taxes businesses and individuals for the pur­\nchase or use of personal property. Ala. Code §§40–23–2(1),\n40–23–61(a) (2011). Alabama law sets the general tax\nrate at 4% of the value of the property purchased or used.\nIbid.\n   The State applies the tax, at the usual 4% rate, to rail­\nroads’ purchase or use of diesel fuel for their rail opera­\ntions. But it exempts from the tax purchases and uses of\ndiesel fuel made by trucking transport companies (whom\nwe will call motor carriers) and companies that transport\ngoods interstate through navigable waters (water carri­\n2    ALABAMA DEPT.

Motor carriers instead pay a 19-cent-per-gallon fuel-\nexcise tax on diesel; water carriers pay neither the sales\nnor fuel-excise tax on their diesel. §40–17–325(a)(2), and\n(b); §40–23–4(a)(10) (2014 Cum. Supp.). The parties stipu­\nlate that rail carriers, motor carriers, and water carriers\ncompete.\n   Respondent CSX Transportation, a rail carrier operating\nin Alabama and other States, believes this asymmetrical\ntax treatment “discriminates against a rail carrier” in\nviolation of the alliterative Railroad Revitalization and\nRegulation Reform Act of 1976, or 4–R Act. 49 U. S. C.\n§11501(b)(4). It sought to enjoin petitioners, the Alabama\nDepartment of Revenue and its Commissioner (Alabama\nor State), from collecting sales tax on its diesel fuel\npurchases.\n   At first, the District Court and Eleventh Circuit both\nrejected CSX’s complaint. CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama\nDept. of Revenue, 350 Fed. Appx. 318 (2009). On this\nlawsuit’s first trip here, we reversed. We rejected the\nState’s argument that sales-and-use tax exemptions can­\nnot “discriminate” within the meaning of subsection (b)(4),\nand remanded the case for further proceedings. CSX\nTransp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 562 U. S. 277,\n296–297 (2011) (CSX I).\n   On remand, the District Court rejected CSX’s claim\nafter a trial. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It held\nthat, on CSX’s challenge, CSX could establish discrimina­\ntion by showing the State taxed rail carriers differently\nthan their competitors—which, by stipulation, included\nmotor carriers and water carriers. But it rejected Ala­\nbama’s argument that the fuel-excise taxes offset the sales\ntaxes—in other words, that because it imposed its fuel-\nexcise tax on motor carriers, but not rail carriers, it was\njustified in imposing the sales tax on rail carriers, but not\nmotor carriers.

S. ___ (2014). We also directed the parties to address\nwhether, when resolving a claim of unlawful tax discrimi­\nnation, a court should consider aspects of a State’s tax\nscheme apart from the challenged provision. Ibid.\n                              II\n  The 4–R Act provides:\n      “(b) The following acts unreasonably burden and\n    discriminate against interstate commerce, and a\n    State, subdivision of a State, or authority acting for a\n    State or subdivision of a State may not do any of\n    them:\n      “(1) Assess rail transportation property at a value\n    that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the\n    rail transportation property than the ratio that the\n    assessed value of other commercial and industrial\n    property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to\n    the true market value of the other commercial and in­\n    dustrial property.\n      “(2) Levy or collect a tax that may not be made un­\n    der paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n      “(3) Levy or collect an ad valorem property tax at a\n    tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to com­\n    mercial and industrial property in the same assess­\n    ment jurisdiction.\n      “(4) Impose another tax that discriminates against a\n    rail carrier providing transportation subject to the\n    jurisdiction of the Board under this part.” §11501(b)\n    (1)–(4).\n  In our last opinion in this case, we held that “discrimi­\nnates” in subsection (b)(4) carries its ordinary meaning,\nand that a tax discriminates under subsection (b)(4) when\n4     ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nit treats “groups [that] are similarly situated” differently\nwithout sufficient “justification for the difference in treat­\nment.” CSX I, supra, at 287. Here, we address the mean­\ning of these two quoted phrases.\n                               A\n   The first question in this case is who is the “comparison\nclass” for purposes of a subsection (b)(4) claim. Alabama\nargues that the only appropriate comparison class for a\nsubsection (b)(4) claim is all general commercial and\nindustrial taxpayers. We disagree. While all general and\ncommercial taxpayers is an appropriate comparison class,\nit is not the only one.\n   Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word “discrimi­\nnation” suggests that it occurs only when the victim is\nsingled out relative to the population at large. If, for\nexample, a State offers free college education to all return­\ning combat veterans, but arbitrarily excepts those who\nserved in the Marines, we would say that Marines have\nexperienced discrimination. That would remain the case\neven though the Marines are treated the same way as\nmembers of the general public, who have to pay for their\neducation.\n   Context confirms that the comparison class for subsec­\ntion (b)(4) is not limited as Alabama suggests. The 4–R\nAct is an “asymmetrical statute.” Id., at 296. Subsections\n(b)(1) to (b)(3) contain three specific prohibitions directed\ntowards property taxes. Each requires comparison of\nrailroad property to commercial and industrial property in\nthe same assessment jurisdiction. The Act therefore limits\nthe comparison class for challenges under those provi­\nsions. Even if the jurisdiction treats railroads less favor-\nably than residential property, no violation of these subsec­\ntions has occurred. Subsection (b)(4) contains no such\nlimitation, leaving the comparison class to be determined\nas it is normally determined with respect to discrimination\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims. And we think that depends on the theory of dis­\ncrimination alleged in the claim. When a railroad alleges\nthat a tax targets it for worse treatment than local busi­\nnesses, all other commercial and industrial taxpayers are\nthe comparison class. When a railroad alleges that a tax\ndisadvantages it compared to its competitors in the trans­\nportation industry, the railroad’s competitors in that\njurisdiction are the comparison class.\n   So, picking a comparison class is extraordinarily easy.\nUnlike under subsections (b)(1)–(3), the railroad is not\nlimited to all commercial and industrial taxpayers; all the\nworld, or at least all the world within the taxing jurisdic­\ntion, is its comparison-class oyster. But that is not as\ngenerous a concession as might seem. What subsection\n(b)(4) requires, and subsections (b)(1)–(3) do not, is a\nshowing of discrimination—of a failure to treat similarly\nsituated persons alike. A comparison class will thus sup­\nport a discrimination claim only if it consists of individuals\nsimilarly situated to the claimant.\n   That raises the question of when a proposed comparison\nclass qualifies as similarly situated. In the Equal Protec­\ntion Clause context, very few taxpayers are regarded as\nsimilarly situated and thus entitled to equal treatment.\nThere, a State may tax different lines of businesses differ­\nently with near-impunity, even if they are apparently\nsimilar. We have upheld or approved of distinctions be­\ntween utilities—including a railroad—and other corpora­\ntions, New York Rapid Transit Corp. v. City of New York,\n303 U. S. 573, 579 (1938), between wholesalers and retail­\ners in goods, Caskey Baking Co. v. Virginia, 313 U. S. 117,\n120–121 (1941), between chain retail stores and independ­\nent retail stores, State Bd. of Tax Comm’rs of Ind. v. Jack-\nson, 283 U.

CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOil Co. v. Texas, 217 U. S. 114, 121 (1910). As one treatise\nhas observed, we recognize a “wide latitude state legisla­\ntures enjoy in drawing tax classifications under the Equal\nProtection Clause.” 1 J. Hellerstein & W. Hellerstein,\nState Taxation ¶3.03[1], p. 3–5 (3d ed. 2001–2005). This\nincludes the power to impose “widely different taxes on\nvarious trades or professions.” Id., at 3–5 to 3–6. It would\nbe permissible—as far as the Equal Protection Clause is\nconcerned—for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a\nmotor carrier, despite the seeming similarity in their lines\nof business.\n   The concept of “similarly situated” individuals cannot be\nso narrow here. That would deprive subsection (b)(4) of all\nreal-world effect, providing protection that the Equal\nProtection Clause already provides. Moreover, the cate-\ngory of “similarly situated” (b)(4) comparison classes must\ninclude commercial and industrial taxpayers. There is no\nconceivable reason why the statute would forbid property\ntaxes higher than what that class enjoys (or suffers), but\npermit other taxes that discriminate in favor of that class\nvis-à-vis railroads. And we think the competitors of rail­\nroads can be another “similarly situated” comparison\nclass, since discrimination in favor of that class most\nobviously frustrates the purpose of the 4–R Act, which was\nto “restore the financial stability of the railway system of\nthe United States,” §101(a), 90 Stat. 33, while “foster[ing]\ncompetition among all carriers by railroad and other\nmodes of transportation,” §101(b)(2). We need not, and\nthus do not, express any opinion on what other comparison\nclasses may qualify. Sufficient unto the day is the evil\nthereof.\n   Alabama claims that because subsections (b)(1) and\n(b)(3) (and (b)(2) through reference to (b)(1)) establish a\ncomparison class of “commercial and industrial property,”\nsubsection (b)(4) must establish a comparison class of\n“general commercial and industrial taxpayers.” This\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninverts normal rules of interpretation, which would say\nthat the explicit limitation to “commercial and industrial”\nin the first three provisions, and the absence of such a\nlimitation in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation\napplies to the fourth. Moreover, Alabama’s interpretation\nwould require us to dragoon the modifier “commercial and\nindustrial”—but not the noun “property”—from the first\nthree provisions, append “general” in front of it and “tax­\npayers” after, both words foreign to the preceding subsec­\ntions. We might also have to strip away the restrictions in\nthe definition of “commercial and industrial property,”\nwhich excludes land primarily used for agricultural pur­\nposes and timber growing. 49 U. S. C. §11501(a)(4). This\nis not our concept of fidelity to a statute’s text.\n   Alabama responds that the introductory clause of\n§11501(b)—which declares that the “following acts unrea­\nsonably burden and discriminate against interstate com-\nmerce,”—“binds its four subsections together,” Brief for\nPetitioners 23 (emphasis deleted), and gives them a com­\nmon object and scope. The last time this case appeared\nbefore us, Alabama made a similar argument in support of\nthe claim that, because subsections (b)(1)–(3) cover only\nproperty taxes, so too does subsection (b)(4). See Brief for\nRespondents in CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of\nRevenue, O. T. 2010, No. 09–520, p. 25–26. We rejected\nthis argument then, and we reject it again now.\n   Alabama persists that a case-specific inquiry allows a\nrailroad to “hand-pick [its] comparison class,” Brief for\nPetitioners 41, which would be unfair—a “windfall” to\nrailroads. Ibid. As we have described above, picking a\nclass is easy, but it is not easy to establish that the selected\nclass is “similarly situated” for purposes of discrimina­\ntion in taxation. The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded\nthat, in light of CSX Transportation’s complaint and the\nparties’ stipulation, a comparison class of competitors\nconsisting of motor carriers and water carriers was appro­\n8    ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npriate, and differential treatment vis-à-vis that class\nwould constitute discrimination. We therefore turn to\nthe court’s refusal to consider Alabama’s alternative tax\njustifications.\n                               B\n   A State’s tax discriminates only where the State cannot\nsufficiently justify differences in treatment between simi­\nlarly situated taxpayers. As we have discussed above, a\nrail carrier and its competitors can be considered similarly\nsituated for purposes of this provision. But what about\nthe claim that those competitors are subject to other taxes\nthat the railroads avoid? We think Alabama can justify its\ndecision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use\ntax through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-\nexcise tax.\n   It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say\nthat a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival\nwho is exempt from that tax must pay another comparable\ntax from which the rail carrier is exempt. If that were\ntrue, both competitors could claim to be disfavored—\ndiscriminated against—relative to each other. Our nega­\ntive Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that\nan additional tax on third parties may justify an otherwise\ndiscriminatory tax. Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U. S.\n472, 479–480 (1932). We think that an alternative, roughly\nequivalent tax is one possible justification that renders\na tax disparity nondiscriminatory.\n   CSX claims that because the statutory prohibition for­\nbids “impos[ing] another tax that discriminates against a\nrail carrier,” 49 U. S. C. §11501(b)(4)—“tax” in the singu­\nlar—the appropriate inquiry is whether the challenged tax\ndiscriminates, not whether the tax code as a whole does so.\nIt is undoubtedly correct that the “tax” (singular) must\ndiscriminate—but it does not discriminate unless it treats\nrailroads differently from other similarly situated taxpay­\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ners without sufficient justification. A comparable tax\nlevied on a competitor may justify not extending that\ncompetitor’s exemption from a general tax to a railroad. It\nis easy to display the error of CSX’s single-tax-provision\napproach. Under that model, the following tax would\nviolate the 4–R Act: “(1) All railroads shall pay a 4% sales\ntax. (2) All other individuals shall also pay a 4% sales\ntax.”\n   CSX would undoubtedly object that not every case will\nbe so easy, and that federal courts are ill qualified to\nexplore the vagaries of state tax law. We are inclined to\nagree, but that cannot carry the day. Congress assigned\nthis task to the courts by drafting an antidiscrimination\ncommand in such sweeping terms. There is simply no\ndiscrimination when there are roughly comparable taxes.\nIf the task of determining when that is so is “Sisyphean,”\nas the Eleventh Circuit called it, 720 F. 3d, at 871, it is a\nSisyphean task that the statute imposes. We therefore\ncannot approve of the Eleventh Circuit’s refusal to consider\nAlabama’s tax-based justification, and remand for that\ncourt to consider whether Alabama’s fuel-excise tax is the\nrough equivalent of Alabama’s sales tax as applied to\ndiesel fuel, and therefore justifies the motor carrier sales-\ntax exemption.\n                              C\n  While the State argues that the existence of a fuel-\nexcise tax justifies its decision to exempt motor carriers\nfrom the sales and use tax, it cannot offer a similar de­\nfense with respect to its exemption for water carriers.\nWater carriers pay neither tax.\n  The State, however, offers other justifications for the\nwater carrier exemption—for example, that such an ex­\nemption is compelled by federal law. The Eleventh Circuit\nfailed to examine these justifications, asserting that the\nwater carriers were the beneficiaries of a discriminatory\n10   ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v.

I\nbriefly summarize that reasoning here.\n   Because the meaning of “discriminates” is ambiguous at\nfirst glance, I look to the term’s context to resolve this\nuncertainty. Id., at 298–299. Both the structure and\nbackground of the statute indicate that subsection (b)(4)\nprohibits only taxes that single out railroads as compared\n2     ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nto other commercial and industrial taxpayers.\n   Subsection (b)(4) is a residual clause, the meaning of\nwhich is best understood by reference to the provisions\nthat precede it. Subsection (b) begins by announcing that\n“[t]he following acts . . . discriminate against interstate\ncommerce” and are prohibited. §11501(b). Subsections\n(b)(1) through (3) then list three tax-related actions that\nsingle out rail carriers by treating rail property differently\nfrom all other commercial and industrial property.\n§§11501(b)(1)–(3); id., at 300. Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(3)\nexplicitly identify “commercial and industrial property” as\nthe comparison class, and subsection (b)(2) incorporates\nthat comparison class by reference. §11501(b); id., at 300.\nSubsection (b)(4) refers back to these provisions when it\nforbids “[i]mpos[ing] another tax that discriminates\nagainst a rail carrier.” §11501(b)(4) (emphasis added); id.,\nat 300). The statutory structure therefore supports the\nconclusion that a tax “discriminates against a rail carrier”\nwithin the meaning of subsection (b)(4) if it singles out\nrailroads for unfavorable treatment as compared to the\ngeneral class of commercial and industrial taxpayers. Id.,\nat 300–301.\n   The statutory background supports the same conclusion.\nWhen Congress enacted the 4–R Act, it was apparent that\nrailroads were “easy prey for State and local tax assessors\nin that they are nonvoting, often nonresident, targets for\nlocal taxation, who cannot easily remove themselves from\nthe locality.” Id., at 301 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). Subsections (b)(1) through (3) thus “establish a\npolitical check” by preventing States from imposing exces­\nsive property taxes on railroads “without imposing the\nsame taxes more generally on voting, resident local busi­\nnesses.” Ibid. Subsection (b)(4) is best understood as\naddressing the same problem in the same way. Id., at\n301–302.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\n                              B\n\n  Alabama’s tax scheme cannot be said to “discriminat[e]\nagainst a rail carrier.” Id., at 302. To begin, the scheme\ndoes not single out rail carriers. Although one would not\nknow it from the majority opinion, the tax is not directed\nat rail carriers, their property, their activity, or goods\nuniquely consumed by them. It is instead a generally\napplicable sales tax. It applies (with other exemptions not\nat issue here) to all goods purchased, used, or stored in the\nState of Alabama. Ala. Code §§40–23–2(1), 40–23–61(a)\n(2011). The only relevant good exempted from the tax is\ndiesel on which the motor fuel tax has been paid, §40–17–\n325(b), and no provision of law prevents rail carriers from\nbuying such diesel. See Brief for Respondent 46, n. 13\n(acknowledging that CSX pays the motor fuel tax on the\ndiesel fuel it uses in trucks and other on-road vehic-\nles). Water carriers, it is true, enjoy a special carve-out\nfrom this sales tax, §40–23–4(a)(10) (Cum. Supp. 2014),\nbut that exemption singles out water carriers, not rail\ncarriers.\n  Even if this constellation of exemptions to Alabama’s\nsales tax could be said to single out rail carriers from the\ngeneral class of their interstate competitors, the tax surely\ndoes not single out rail carriers as compared to commercial\nand industrial taxpayers. Those taxpayers are subject to\nexactly the same generally applicable sales and use tax\nregime as are rail carriers.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   The Court started off on the wrong track in CSX I when\nit relied on a generic dictionary definition of “discrimi­\nnates” in the face of a statutory context suggesting a more\nspecific definition. See 562 U. S., at 304. Today’s decision\ncontinues that error.\n   The Court uncritically accepts the conclusion that the\n4     ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n“discriminat[ion]” addressed by the statute encompasses\nany distinction between rail carriers and their comparison\nclass, ante, at 4, as opposed to mere “singling out” or some­\nthing in between, even though the word “discriminates”\nis ambiguous in that way. CSX I, supra, at 299. The\nCourt’s usual practice has not been to treat the meaning\nof “discriminates” so casually. See generally Guardians\nAssn. v. Civil Serv. Comm’n of New York City, 463 U. S.\n582, 590–593 (1983) (opinion of White, J.) (discussing\nthe Court’s shifting definition of the ambiguous term\n“discrimination”).\n   Today’s decision compounds this error by holding that a\nrail carrier may make out a claim of discrimination using\nany comparison class so long as that class consists of\n“individuals similarly situated to the claimant” rail carrier.\nAnte, at 5. The majority purports to derive this limita-\ntion from the dictionary, but then finds itself unable to\nproceed: After all, Black’s Law Dictionary contains no\nentry defining what it means to be “similarly situated” for\nthe purpose of subsection (b)(4). Forced finally to turn to\nthe statutory context, the majority rejects the statutorily\ndefined competitor class of commercial and industrial\ntaxpayers in favor of a shifting comparison class of its own\ncreation.\n                              B\n   The majority disregards the commercial and industrial\nproperty comparison class identified in subsections (b)(1)\nthrough (3) because subsection (b)(4) does not explicitly\ninclude language from those provisions. See ante, at 4–5,\n6–7. It asserts that defining the comparison class for the\npurpose of subsection (b)(4) by reference to the comparison\nclass identified in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(3) “would\nrequire us to dragoon the modifier ‘commercial and indus­\ntrial’—but not the noun ‘property’—from the first three\nprovisions, append ‘general’ in front of it and ‘taxpayers’\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nafter, both words foreign to the preceding subsections.”\nAnte, at 7.\n   The majority’s accusation of grammatical conscription\nmisses the point. Subsection (b)(4) is a residual clause,\nexplicitly marked as such by the use of the word “another.”\nSee Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v.\nGuardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U. S. 371, 384 (2003).\nLike other residual clauses, it need not use the same\nlanguage as the clauses it follows to derive meaning from\nthose clauses. See, e.g., Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U. S. 277,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 13); James v. United States, 550\nU. S. 192, 217–218 (2007) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Where,\nas here, a residual clause includes an ambiguous word like\n“discriminates,” we must look to the clauses that precede\nit to guide our understanding of its scope.\n   In some sense, my task in giving meaning to the statu­\ntory term “discriminates” is no different from the major­\nity’s: to determine what type of differential treatment the\nstatute forbids. The first three clauses provide important\nclues that the statute forbids singling out rail carriers\nfrom other commercial and industrial taxpayers because\ncommercial and industrial taxpayers are the ones who pay\ntaxes on “commercial and industrial property.” The major­\nity pursues the same logical train of thought when it\nopines that “the category of ‘similarly situated’ (b)(4)\ncomparison classes must include commercial and indus-\ntrial taxpayers” because “[t]here is no conceivable reason\nwhy the statute would forbid property taxes higher than\nwhat that class enjoys (or suffers), but permit other taxes\nthat discriminate in favor of that class vis-à-vis railroads.”\nAnte, at 6. Where we part ways is in the inferences we\ndraw from the statutory context.\n   Treating subsection (b)(4) as a residual clause does not\nrequire the grammatical distortions that the majority\nalleges. The word “discriminates” in subsection (b)(4) is\nnot a referential phrase whose antecedent is uncertain. If\n6    ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nit were, then it would be necessary to select an antecedent\nthat would fit grammatically in place of “discriminates.”\nInstead, I look to (b)(1) to (3) merely to clarify an ambigu-\nity in the meaning of “discriminates,” a task that does not\nrequire me to “dragoon” the language of the prior clauses\ninto subsection (b)(4).\n   Nor does my approach rely on the first three clauses of\n§11501(b) to supply a general limitation on the independ­\nent prohibition that appears in subsection (b)(4). See\nUnited States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 615 (1995)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(criticizing this type of argument). That is what Alabama\nsought to do in CSX I when it argued that subsection (b)(4)\nis limited to property taxes (or their equivalent “in lieu”\ntaxes). Ante, at 7; CSX I, 562 U. S., at 285 (majority opin­\nion). I joined the majority in rejecting that argument. Id.,\nat 297 (dissenting opinion). But whereas there is no un­\ncertainty about the meaning of “taxes” in subsection (b)(4)\nthat would justify importing the property tax limitation\nfrom the three preceding subsections, id., at 284–285\n(majority opinion), there is a good deal of uncertainty\nabout the meaning of “discriminates.” This uncertainty\njustifies looking to the three previous clauses to under­\nstand the type of differential treatment §11501(b) is\nmeant to prohibit. Id., at 298–299 (dissenting opinion);\nsee Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 588–\n589 (1980). And those three previous clauses easily supply\nthe answer to the comparison class question.\n                             C\n  Unwilling to so limit the range of available comparison\nclasses, the majority takes an approach to determining\nwhich individuals are “similarly situated” for purposes of\nthe statute that “is almost entirely ad hoc,” James, supra,\nat 215 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). It asserts that the compar­\nison class will “depen[d] on the theory of discrimination\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nalleged in the claim.” Ante, at 4–5. Sometimes the com­\nparison class will be “all other commercial and industrial\ntaxpayers,” sometimes it will be “the railroad’s competi­\ntors” in a particular jurisdiction, and sometimes it may be\nsome other comparison class entirely. Id., at 5.\n   The sole evidence on which the majority relies to con­\nclude that competitors are similarly situated, and there­\nfore qualify as a comparison class, is the professed pur­\nposes of the Act: “to ‘restore the financial stability of the\nrailway system of the United States,’ while ‘foster[ing]\ncompetition among all carriers by railroad and other\nmodes of transportation.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quoting 90 Stat. 33,\n§§101(a), (b)(2)). Interpreting statutory text solely in light\nof purpose, absent any reliance on text or structure, is\ndangerous business because it places courts in peril of\nsubstituting their policy judgment for that of Congress. In\nconsidering statutory purpose, therefore, we should be\ncareful that any inferences of purpose are tied to text\nrather than instinct.\n   The majority throws such caution to the wind. Its two-\nsentence argument is a perfect illustration of the dangers\nof a purely purpose-based approach. The majority cherry-\npicks two of a number of stated goals of a complex piece of\nlegislation over 100 pages long and assumes that this\nspecific provision was assigned to those specific purposes.\nAnd then it interprets the statute to perform in the man­\nner the majority believes is best designed to “restore . . .\nfinancial stability” and “foster . . . competition.” Ante, at 6\n(alteration omitted).\n   I have no reason to doubt the economic soundness of the\nmajority’s conclusion that discrimination between rail\ncarriers and their competitors threatens their financial\nstability and impedes competition, but I lack the major-\nity’s certitude that §11501(b)(4) is designed to further those\ngoals by combatting that evil, at least in the way the ma­\njority asserts. Instead, the first three subsections provide\n8     ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nstrong textual evidence that §11501(b) was designed to\nstabilize rail carriers by protecting them from discrimina­\ntion against interstate commerce. And they provide evi­\ndence of Congress’ chosen mechanism for accomplishing\nthat goal: tying the fate of interstate rail carriers to the\nbroader class of commercial and industrial taxpayers. See\nsupra, at 2.\n   The introductory clause of §11501(b) provides further\nevidence that the evil at which subsection (b)(4) is tar-\ngeted is not discrimination between rail carriers and their\ncompetitors, but “acts [that] unreasonably burden and\ndiscriminate against interstate commerce.” The majority’s\nresponse to this evidence—that the Court rejected a simi­\nlar argument when it refused to limit subsection (b)(4) to\nproperty taxes or their kin, ante, at 7—is a non sequitur.\nThe introductory clause contains no reference to property\ntaxes that “binds its four subsections together” as prohibi­\ntions on discriminatory property taxes. Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But it does have a reference to\ndiscrimination against interstate commerce, which does\ntie the sections together to serve that common statutory\npurpose. This, in turn, weighs against the majority’s\ninferences about how §11501(b) relates to the stated pur­\nposes of the 4–R Act.\n   The majority’s conclusion that competitors are a permis­\nsible comparison class completely ignores these contextual\nclues, permitting subsection (b)(4) to serve different statu­\ntory goals by a different mechanism than its three prede­\ncessor clauses. And it leads to odd inconsistencies. If we\nwere to understand the provision as prohibiting only\ndiscrimination between rail carriers and their competitors,\nthen it might well further the goal of promoting competi­\ntion between interstate carriers. But the majority instead\nselects a shifting-comparison-class approach, requiring\nrail carriers to be treated at least as well as their competi­\ntors and any other similarly situated taxpayers. See ante,\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nat 4–5. This most-favored taxpayer status is a position the\ncompetitors do not enjoy, so the majority’s position could\nresult in tax schemes that impede competition between\ninterstate carriers rather than promote it.\n  Identifying “similarly situated” taxpayers by the undis­\nciplined approach the majority endorses could well lead to\nother unanticipated consequences. This is why the policy\njudgments needed to link statutory mechanisms to statu­\ntory purposes are best left to Congress. If this Court is\ngoing to adopt a shifting-comparison-class approach to\n§11501(b)(4), then it should at least demand a stronger\ntextual link between the comparison class a claimant\nseeks to import into subsection (b)(4) and any purpose that\nthe claimant argues it serves.\n                              III\n  Because the majority adopts an interpretation of\n§11501(b)(4) that is not grounded in the text, it should\ncome as no surprise that this interpretation is difficult to\napply, as this case demonstrates. It is easy to see how,\naccepting water carriers as a comparison class, the scheme\ntreats water carriers and rail carriers differently when it\ngrants water carriers, but not rail carriers, an exemption\nfrom the sales tax. Ala. Code §40–23–4(a)(10). Identifying\nthe difference in treatment between rail and motor car-\nriers, by contrast, requires a good deal more imagination.\n  The majority’s approach exhibits that imagination. It\nglosses over the general applicability of the provisions that\napply to rail and motor carriers, stating that “[t]he State\napplies the [sales or use] tax, at the usual 4% rate, to\nrailroads’ purchase or use of diesel fuel for their rail oper­\nations,” but “exempts from the tax purchases and uses of\ndiesel fuel made by [motor carriers].” Ante, at 1. A quick\nglimpse at the code reveals that this is not quite the case.\nThe applicability of the sales and use taxes does not de­\npend on the identity of the purchaser, but on whether the\n10    ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npurchaser pays another excise tax, §40–17–325(b), which\nin turn depends on the nature of the product purchased\nand its use, §§40–17–328, 40–17–329, which in turn merely\ncorrelates to the carriers’ operations.\n   As far as I can tell, the rail carriers use dyed diesel that\nis exempt from the motor fuel tax—and therefore subject\nto the sales and use taxes—as a matter of choice rather\nthan necessity. Dyed diesel has no special properties that\nmake it more suitable for use in a train engine; the dye\nmerely identifies it as exempt from the federal excise tax,\n§40–17–322(21). And no law prohibits rail carriers from\nusing undyed diesel. To the contrary, it is the motor\ncarriers who are prohibited from using the dyed variant\nfor on-road use.\n   Assuming arguendo that state law provides that only\ndyed diesel may be used in rail operations, it becomes a\nlittle easier to make an argument that the State treats rail\ncarriers differently in this case. But the majority still\nfaces a line-drawing problem. Is it necessary that the good\nsubject to the challenged tax be the same as the good on\nwhich the competitor enjoys an exemption? Could a rail\ncarrier that relies on natural gas rather than diesel for\nmotive power make the same claim of discrimination if\nnatural gas is not entitled to the same sales-tax exemption\nas diesel? Is it necessary that the rail carrier and its\ncompetitor rely on the good for the same purpose? Could a\nrail carrier that uses diesel for motive power challenge a\nhypothetical provision that exempted from the sales and\nuse taxes diesel that motor carriers use for refrigeration in\nrefrigerated trailers?\n   The majority never answers these questions. “Sufficient\nunto the day is the evil thereof,” it intones. Ante, at 6.\n“That gets this case off our docket, sure enough. But it\nutterly fails to do what this Court is supposed to do: pro­\nvide guidance concrete enough to ensure that the” statute\nis applied consistently. James, 550 U.

Argued December 9, 2014—Decided March 4, 2015\nAlabama imposes sales and use taxes on railroads when they purchase\n  or consume diesel fuel, but exempts from those taxes trucking\n  transport companies (motor carriers) and companies that transport\n  goods interstate through navigable waters (water carriers), both rail-\n  road competitors. Motor carriers pay an alternative fuel-excise tax\n  on diesel, but water carriers pay neither the sales tax nor the excise\n  tax. Respondent (CSX), an interstate rail carrier that operates in Al-\n  abama, sought to enjoin state officers from collecting sales tax on its\n  diesel fuel purchases, claiming that the State’s asymmetrical tax\n  treatment “discriminates against a rail carrier” in violation of the\n  Railroad Revitalization and Regulation Reform Act of 1976, or 4–R\n  Act, 49 U. S. C. §11501(b)(4). This Court held that a tax “discrimi-\n  nates” under subsection (b)(4) when it treats “groups [that] are simi-\n  larly situated” differently without sufficient “justification for the dif-\n  ference in treatment,” CSX Transp. v. Ala. Dept. of Revenue, 562\n  U. S. 277, 287 (CSX I). On remand, the District Court rejected CSX’s\n  claim. Reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that CSX could establish\n  discrimination by showing that Alabama taxed rail carriers different-\n  ly than their competitors, but rejected Alabama’s argument that im-\n  posing a fuel-excise tax on motor carriers, but not rail carriers, justi-\n  fied imposing the sales tax on rail carriers, but not motor carriers.\nHeld:\n    1. The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded that CSX’s competitors\n are an appropriate comparison class for its subsection (b)(4) claim.\n    All general and commercial taxpayers may be an appropriate com-\n parison class for a subsection (b)(4) claim, but it is not the only one.\n Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word “discrimination” sug-\n2        ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    gests that it occurs only when the victim is singled out relative to the\n    population at large. Context confirms this reading. The 4–R Act is\n    an “asymmetrical statute.” CSX I, supra, at 296. In subsections\n    (b)(1) to (b)(3)—which specify prohibitions directed toward property\n    taxes—the comparison class is limited to commercial and industrial\n    property in the same assessment jurisdiction. But subsection (b)(4)\n    contains no such limitation, so the comparison class is to be deter-\n    mined based on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.\n    Thus, when a railroad alleges that a tax disadvantages it compared\n    to its transportation industry competitors, its competitors in that ju-\n    risdiction are the comparison class. Because subsection (b)(4) re-\n    quires a showing of discrimination, however, the comparison class\n    must consist of individuals similarly situated to the claimant.\n       Subsection (b)(4) would be deprived of all real-world effect if “simi-\n    larly situated” were given the same narrow construction the concept\n    has in the Equal Protection Clause context, where it would be per-\n    missible for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a motor carrier,\n    despite their seemingly similar lines of business. The category of\n    “similarly situated” (b)(4) comparison classes must at least include\n    the commercial and industrial taxpayers specified in the other sub-\n    sections. But it also can include a railroad’s competitors. Discrimi-\n    nation in favor of that class both falls within the ordinary meaning of\n    “discrimination” and frustrates the 4–R Act’s purpose of “restor[ing]\n    the financial stability of the [Nation’s] railway system” while “fos-\n    ter[ing] competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes\n    of transportation,” 90 Stat. 33. Contrary to Alabama’s argument,\n    normal rules of interpretation would say that the explicit limitation\n    to “commercial and industrial” in the first three provisions, and its\n    absence in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation applies to the\n    fourth. Alabama’s additional arguments are also unavailing. Pp. 4–\n    8.\n       2. The Eleventh Circuit erred in refusing to consider whether Ala-\n    bama could justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales\n    and use taxes through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-\n    excise tax. It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say that\n    a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt\n    from that tax must pay another comparable tax from which the rail\n    carrier is exempt, since both competitors could then claim to be dis-\n    criminated against relative to each other. The Court’s negative\n    Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that an additional\n    tax on third parties may justify an otherwise discriminatory tax.\n    Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U. S. 472, 479–480. Similarly, an al-\n    ternative, roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification that\n    renders a tax disparity non-discriminatory.

S. C.\n§11501(b)(4). We are asked to decide whether a State\nviolates this prohibition by taxing diesel fuel purchases\nmade by a rail carrier while exempting similar purchases\nmade by its competitors; and if so, whether the violation is\neliminated when other tax provisions offset the challenged\ntreatment of railroads.\n                                          I\n   Alabama taxes businesses and individuals for the pur­\nchase or use of personal property. Ala. Code §§40–23–2(1),\n40–23–61(a) (2011). Alabama law sets the general tax\nrate at 4% of the value of the property purchased or used.\nIbid.\n   The State applies the tax, at the usual 4% rate, to rail­\nroads’ purchase or use of diesel fuel for their rail opera­\ntions. But it exempts from the tax purchases and uses of\ndiesel fuel made by trucking transport companies (whom\nwe will call motor carriers) and companies that transport\ngoods interstate through navigable waters (water carri­\n2    ALABAMA DEPT.

Motor carriers instead pay a 19-cent-per-gallon fuel-\nexcise tax on diesel; water carriers pay neither the sales\nnor fuel-excise tax on their diesel. §40–17–325(a)(2), and\n(b); §40–23–4(a)(10) (2014 Cum. Supp.). The parties stipu­\nlate that rail carriers, motor carriers, and water carriers\ncompete.\n   Respondent CSX Transportation, a rail carrier operating\nin Alabama and other States, believes this asymmetrical\ntax treatment “discriminates against a rail carrier” in\nviolation of the alliterative Railroad Revitalization and\nRegulation Reform Act of 1976, or 4–R Act. 49 U. S. C.\n§11501(b)(4). It sought to enjoin petitioners, the Alabama\nDepartment of Revenue and its Commissioner (Alabama\nor State), from collecting sales tax on its diesel fuel\npurchases.\n   At first, the District Court and Eleventh Circuit both\nrejected CSX’s complaint. CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama\nDept. of Revenue, 350 Fed. Appx. 318 (2009). On this\nlawsuit’s first trip here, we reversed. We rejected the\nState’s argument that sales-and-use tax exemptions can­\nnot “discriminate” within the meaning of subsection (b)(4),\nand remanded the case for further proceedings. CSX\nTransp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 562 U. S. 277,\n296–297 (2011) (CSX I).\n   On remand, the District Court rejected CSX’s claim\nafter a trial. 892 F. Supp. 2d 1300 (ND Ala. 2012). The\nEleventh Circuit reversed. 720 F. 3d 863 (2013). It held\nthat, on CSX’s challenge, CSX could establish discrimina­\ntion by showing the State taxed rail carriers differently\nthan their competitors—which, by stipulation, included\nmotor carriers and water carriers. But it rejected Ala­\nbama’s argument that the fuel-excise taxes offset the sales\ntaxes—in other words, that because it imposed its fuel-\nexcise tax on motor carriers, but not rail carriers, it was\njustified in imposing the sales tax on rail carriers, but not\nmotor carriers.

Ibid.\n                              II\n  The 4–R Act provides:\n      “(b) The following acts unreasonably burden and\n    discriminate against interstate commerce, and a\n    State, subdivision of a State, or authority acting for a\n    State or subdivision of a State may not do any of\n    them:\n      “(1) Assess rail transportation property at a value\n    that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the\n    rail transportation property than the ratio that the\n    assessed value of other commercial and industrial\n    property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to\n    the true market value of the other commercial and in­\n    dustrial property.\n      “(2) Levy or collect a tax that may not be made un­\n    der paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n      “(3) Levy or collect an ad valorem property tax at a\n    tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to com­\n    mercial and industrial property in the same assess­\n    ment jurisdiction.\n      “(4) Impose another tax that discriminates against a\n    rail carrier providing transportation subject to the\n    jurisdiction of the Board under this part.” §11501(b)\n    (1)–(4).\n  In our last opinion in this case, we held that “discrimi­\nnates” in subsection (b)(4) carries its ordinary meaning,\nand that a tax discriminates under subsection (b)(4) when\n4     ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nit treats “groups [that] are similarly situated” differently\nwithout sufficient “justification for the difference in treat­\nment.” CSX I, supra, at 287. Here, we address the mean­\ning of these two quoted phrases.\n                               A\n   The first question in this case is who is the “comparison\nclass” for purposes of a subsection (b)(4) claim. Alabama\nargues that the only appropriate comparison class for a\nsubsection (b)(4) claim is all general commercial and\nindustrial taxpayers. We disagree. While all general and\ncommercial taxpayers is an appropriate comparison class,\nit is not the only one.\n   Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word “discrimi­\nnation” suggests that it occurs only when the victim is\nsingled out relative to the population at large. If, for\nexample, a State offers free college education to all return­\ning combat veterans, but arbitrarily excepts those who\nserved in the Marines, we would say that Marines have\nexperienced discrimination. That would remain the case\neven though the Marines are treated the same way as\nmembers of the general public, who have to pay for their\neducation.\n   Context confirms that the comparison class for subsec­\ntion (b)(4) is not limited as Alabama suggests. The 4–R\nAct is an “asymmetrical statute.” Id., at 296. Subsections\n(b)(1) to (b)(3) contain three specific prohibitions directed\ntowards property taxes. Each requires comparison of\nrailroad property to commercial and industrial property in\nthe same assessment jurisdiction. The Act therefore limits\nthe comparison class for challenges under those provi­\nsions. Even if the jurisdiction treats railroads less favor-\nably than residential property, no violation of these subsec­\ntions has occurred. Subsection (b)(4) contains no such\nlimitation, leaving the comparison class to be determined\nas it is normally determined with respect to discrimination\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims. And we think that depends on the theory of dis­\ncrimination alleged in the claim. When a railroad alleges\nthat a tax targets it for worse treatment than local busi­\nnesses, all other commercial and industrial taxpayers are\nthe comparison class. When a railroad alleges that a tax\ndisadvantages it compared to its competitors in the trans­\nportation industry, the railroad’s competitors in that\njurisdiction are the comparison class.\n   So, picking a comparison class is extraordinarily easy.\nUnlike under subsections (b)(1)–(3), the railroad is not\nlimited to all commercial and industrial taxpayers; all the\nworld, or at least all the world within the taxing jurisdic­\ntion, is its comparison-class oyster. But that is not as\ngenerous a concession as might seem. What subsection\n(b)(4) requires, and subsections (b)(1)–(3) do not, is a\nshowing of discrimination—of a failure to treat similarly\nsituated persons alike. A comparison class will thus sup­\nport a discrimination claim only if it consists of individuals\nsimilarly situated to the claimant.\n   That raises the question of when a proposed comparison\nclass qualifies as similarly situated. In the Equal Protec­\ntion Clause context, very few taxpayers are regarded as\nsimilarly situated and thus entitled to equal treatment.\nThere, a State may tax different lines of businesses differ­\nently with near-impunity, even if they are apparently\nsimilar. We have upheld or approved of distinctions be­\ntween utilities—including a railroad—and other corpora­\ntions, New York Rapid Transit Corp. v. City of New York,\n303 U. S. 573, 579 (1938), between wholesalers and retail­\ners in goods, Caskey Baking Co. v. Virginia, 313 U. S. 117,\n120–121 (1941), between chain retail stores and independ­\nent retail stores, State Bd. of Tax Comm’rs of Ind. v. Jack-\nson, 283 U.

CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOil Co. v. Texas, 217 U. S. 114, 121 (1910). As one treatise\nhas observed, we recognize a “wide latitude state legisla­\ntures enjoy in drawing tax classifications under the Equal\nProtection Clause.” 1 J. Hellerstein & W. Hellerstein,\nState Taxation ¶3.03[1], p. 3–5 (3d ed. 2001–2005). This\nincludes the power to impose “widely different taxes on\nvarious trades or professions.” Id., at 3–5 to 3–6. It would\nbe permissible—as far as the Equal Protection Clause is\nconcerned—for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a\nmotor carrier, despite the seeming similarity in their lines\nof business.\n   The concept of “similarly situated” individuals cannot be\nso narrow here. That would deprive subsection (b)(4) of all\nreal-world effect, providing protection that the Equal\nProtection Clause already provides. Moreover, the cate-\ngory of “similarly situated” (b)(4) comparison classes must\ninclude commercial and industrial taxpayers. There is no\nconceivable reason why the statute would forbid property\ntaxes higher than what that class enjoys (or suffers), but\npermit other taxes that discriminate in favor of that class\nvis-à-vis railroads. And we think the competitors of rail­\nroads can be another “similarly situated” comparison\nclass, since discrimination in favor of that class most\nobviously frustrates the purpose of the 4–R Act, which was\nto “restore the financial stability of the railway system of\nthe United States,” §101(a), 90 Stat. 33, while “foster[ing]\ncompetition among all carriers by railroad and other\nmodes of transportation,” §101(b)(2). We need not, and\nthus do not, express any opinion on what other comparison\nclasses may qualify. Sufficient unto the day is the evil\nthereof.\n   Alabama claims that because subsections (b)(1) and\n(b)(3) (and (b)(2) through reference to (b)(1)) establish a\ncomparison class of “commercial and industrial property,”\nsubsection (b)(4) must establish a comparison class of\n“general commercial and industrial taxpayers.” This\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninverts normal rules of interpretation, which would say\nthat the explicit limitation to “commercial and industrial”\nin the first three provisions, and the absence of such a\nlimitation in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation\napplies to the fourth. Moreover, Alabama’s interpretation\nwould require us to dragoon the modifier “commercial and\nindustrial”—but not the noun “property”—from the first\nthree provisions, append “general” in front of it and “tax­\npayers” after, both words foreign to the preceding subsec­\ntions. We might also have to strip away the restrictions in\nthe definition of “commercial and industrial property,”\nwhich excludes land primarily used for agricultural pur­\nposes and timber growing. 49 U. S. C. §11501(a)(4). This\nis not our concept of fidelity to a statute’s text.\n   Alabama responds that the introductory clause of\n§11501(b)—which declares that the “following acts unrea­\nsonably burden and discriminate against interstate com-\nmerce,”—“binds its four subsections together,” Brief for\nPetitioners 23 (emphasis deleted), and gives them a com­\nmon object and scope. The last time this case appeared\nbefore us, Alabama made a similar argument in support of\nthe claim that, because subsections (b)(1)–(3) cover only\nproperty taxes, so too does subsection (b)(4). See Brief for\nRespondents in CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of\nRevenue, O. T. 2010, No. 09–520, p. 25–26. We rejected\nthis argument then, and we reject it again now.\n   Alabama persists that a case-specific inquiry allows a\nrailroad to “hand-pick [its] comparison class,” Brief for\nPetitioners 41, which would be unfair—a “windfall” to\nrailroads. Ibid. As we have described above, picking a\nclass is easy, but it is not easy to establish that the selected\nclass is “similarly situated” for purposes of discrimina­\ntion in taxation. The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded\nthat, in light of CSX Transportation’s complaint and the\nparties’ stipulation, a comparison class of competitors\nconsisting of motor carriers and water carriers was appro­\n8    ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npriate, and differential treatment vis-à-vis that class\nwould constitute discrimination. We therefore turn to\nthe court’s refusal to consider Alabama’s alternative tax\njustifications.\n                               B\n   A State’s tax discriminates only where the State cannot\nsufficiently justify differences in treatment between simi­\nlarly situated taxpayers. As we have discussed above, a\nrail carrier and its competitors can be considered similarly\nsituated for purposes of this provision. But what about\nthe claim that those competitors are subject to other taxes\nthat the railroads avoid? We think Alabama can justify its\ndecision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use\ntax through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-\nexcise tax.\n   It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say\nthat a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival\nwho is exempt from that tax must pay another comparable\ntax from which the rail carrier is exempt. If that were\ntrue, both competitors could claim to be disfavored—\ndiscriminated against—relative to each other. Our nega­\ntive Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that\nan additional tax on third parties may justify an otherwise\ndiscriminatory tax. Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U. S.\n472, 479–480 (1932). We think that an alternative, roughly\nequivalent tax is one possible justification that renders\na tax disparity nondiscriminatory.\n   CSX claims that because the statutory prohibition for­\nbids “impos[ing] another tax that discriminates against a\nrail carrier,” 49 U. S. C. §11501(b)(4)—“tax” in the singu­\nlar—the appropriate inquiry is whether the challenged tax\ndiscriminates, not whether the tax code as a whole does so.\nIt is undoubtedly correct that the “tax” (singular) must\ndiscriminate—but it does not discriminate unless it treats\nrailroads differently from other similarly situated taxpay­\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ners without sufficient justification. A comparable tax\nlevied on a competitor may justify not extending that\ncompetitor’s exemption from a general tax to a railroad. It\nis easy to display the error of CSX’s single-tax-provision\napproach. Under that model, the following tax would\nviolate the 4–R Act: “(1) All railroads shall pay a 4% sales\ntax. (2) All other individuals shall also pay a 4% sales\ntax.”\n   CSX would undoubtedly object that not every case will\nbe so easy, and that federal courts are ill qualified to\nexplore the vagaries of state tax law. We are inclined to\nagree, but that cannot carry the day. Congress assigned\nthis task to the courts by drafting an antidiscrimination\ncommand in such sweeping terms. There is simply no\ndiscrimination when there are roughly comparable taxes.\nIf the task of determining when that is so is “Sisyphean,”\nas the Eleventh Circuit called it, 720 F. 3d, at 871, it is a\nSisyphean task that the statute imposes. We therefore\ncannot approve of the Eleventh Circuit’s refusal to consider\nAlabama’s tax-based justification, and remand for that\ncourt to consider whether Alabama’s fuel-excise tax is the\nrough equivalent of Alabama’s sales tax as applied to\ndiesel fuel, and therefore justifies the motor carrier sales-\ntax exemption.\n                              C\n  While the State argues that the existence of a fuel-\nexcise tax justifies its decision to exempt motor carriers\nfrom the sales and use tax, it cannot offer a similar de­\nfense with respect to its exemption for water carriers.\nWater carriers pay neither tax.\n  The State, however, offers other justifications for the\nwater carrier exemption—for example, that such an ex­\nemption is compelled by federal law. The Eleventh Circuit\nfailed to examine these justifications, asserting that the\nwater carriers were the beneficiaries of a discriminatory\n10   ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v.

Subsection (b) begins by announcing that\n“[t]he following acts . . . discriminate against interstate\ncommerce” and are prohibited. §11501(b). Subsections\n(b)(1) through (3) then list three tax-related actions that\nsingle out rail carriers by treating rail property differently\nfrom all other commercial and industrial property.\n§§11501(b)(1)–(3); id., at 300. Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(3)\nexplicitly identify “commercial and industrial property” as\nthe comparison class, and subsection (b)(2) incorporates\nthat comparison class by reference. §11501(b); id., at 300.\nSubsection (b)(4) refers back to these provisions when it\nforbids “[i]mpos[ing] another tax that discriminates\nagainst a rail carrier.” §11501(b)(4) (emphasis added); id.,\nat 300). The statutory structure therefore supports the\nconclusion that a tax “discriminates against a rail carrier”\nwithin the meaning of subsection (b)(4) if it singles out\nrailroads for unfavorable treatment as compared to the\ngeneral class of commercial and industrial taxpayers. Id.,\nat 300–301.\n   The statutory background supports the same conclusion.\nWhen Congress enacted the 4–R Act, it was apparent that\nrailroads were “easy prey for State and local tax assessors\nin that they are nonvoting, often nonresident, targets for\nlocal taxation, who cannot easily remove themselves from\nthe locality.” Id., at 301 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). Subsections (b)(1) through (3) thus “establish a\npolitical check” by preventing States from imposing exces­\nsive property taxes on railroads “without imposing the\nsame taxes more generally on voting, resident local busi­\nnesses.” Ibid. Subsection (b)(4) is best understood as\naddressing the same problem in the same way. Id., at\n301–302.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\n                              B\n\n  Alabama’s tax scheme cannot be said to “discriminat[e]\nagainst a rail carrier.” Id., at 302. To begin, the scheme\ndoes not single out rail carriers. Although one would not\nknow it from the majority opinion, the tax is not directed\nat rail carriers, their property, their activity, or goods\nuniquely consumed by them. It is instead a generally\napplicable sales tax. It applies (with other exemptions not\nat issue here) to all goods purchased, used, or stored in the\nState of Alabama. Ala. Code §§40–23–2(1), 40–23–61(a)\n(2011). The only relevant good exempted from the tax is\ndiesel on which the motor fuel tax has been paid, §40–17–\n325(b), and no provision of law prevents rail carriers from\nbuying such diesel. See Brief for Respondent 46, n. 13\n(acknowledging that CSX pays the motor fuel tax on the\ndiesel fuel it uses in trucks and other on-road vehic-\nles). Water carriers, it is true, enjoy a special carve-out\nfrom this sales tax, §40–23–4(a)(10) (Cum. Supp. 2014),\nbut that exemption singles out water carriers, not rail\ncarriers.\n  Even if this constellation of exemptions to Alabama’s\nsales tax could be said to single out rail carriers from the\ngeneral class of their interstate competitors, the tax surely\ndoes not single out rail carriers as compared to commercial\nand industrial taxpayers. Those taxpayers are subject to\nexactly the same generally applicable sales and use tax\nregime as are rail carriers.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   The Court started off on the wrong track in CSX I when\nit relied on a generic dictionary definition of “discrimi­\nnates” in the face of a statutory context suggesting a more\nspecific definition. See 562 U. S., at 304. Today’s decision\ncontinues that error.\n   The Court uncritically accepts the conclusion that the\n4     ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n“discriminat[ion]” addressed by the statute encompasses\nany distinction between rail carriers and their comparison\nclass, ante, at 4, as opposed to mere “singling out” or some­\nthing in between, even though the word “discriminates”\nis ambiguous in that way. CSX I, supra, at 299. The\nCourt’s usual practice has not been to treat the meaning\nof “discriminates” so casually. See generally Guardians\nAssn. v. Civil Serv. Comm’n of New York City, 463 U. S.\n582, 590–593 (1983) (opinion of White, J.) (discussing\nthe Court’s shifting definition of the ambiguous term\n“discrimination”).\n   Today’s decision compounds this error by holding that a\nrail carrier may make out a claim of discrimination using\nany comparison class so long as that class consists of\n“individuals similarly situated to the claimant” rail carrier.\nAnte, at 5. The majority purports to derive this limita-\ntion from the dictionary, but then finds itself unable to\nproceed: After all, Black’s Law Dictionary contains no\nentry defining what it means to be “similarly situated” for\nthe purpose of subsection (b)(4). Forced finally to turn to\nthe statutory context, the majority rejects the statutorily\ndefined competitor class of commercial and industrial\ntaxpayers in favor of a shifting comparison class of its own\ncreation.\n                              B\n   The majority disregards the commercial and industrial\nproperty comparison class identified in subsections (b)(1)\nthrough (3) because subsection (b)(4) does not explicitly\ninclude language from those provisions. See ante, at 4–5,\n6–7. It asserts that defining the comparison class for the\npurpose of subsection (b)(4) by reference to the comparison\nclass identified in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(3) “would\nrequire us to dragoon the modifier ‘commercial and indus­\ntrial’—but not the noun ‘property’—from the first three\nprovisions, append ‘general’ in front of it and ‘taxpayers’\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nafter, both words foreign to the preceding subsections.”\nAnte, at 7.\n   The majority’s accusation of grammatical conscription\nmisses the point. Subsection (b)(4) is a residual clause,\nexplicitly marked as such by the use of the word “another.”\nSee Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v.\nGuardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U. S. 371, 384 (2003).\nLike other residual clauses, it need not use the same\nlanguage as the clauses it follows to derive meaning from\nthose clauses. See, e.g., Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U. S. 277,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 13); James v. United States, 550\nU. S. 192, 217–218 (2007) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Where,\nas here, a residual clause includes an ambiguous word like\n“discriminates,” we must look to the clauses that precede\nit to guide our understanding of its scope.\n   In some sense, my task in giving meaning to the statu­\ntory term “discriminates” is no different from the major­\nity’s: to determine what type of differential treatment the\nstatute forbids. The first three clauses provide important\nclues that the statute forbids singling out rail carriers\nfrom other commercial and industrial taxpayers because\ncommercial and industrial taxpayers are the ones who pay\ntaxes on “commercial and industrial property.” The major­\nity pursues the same logical train of thought when it\nopines that “the category of ‘similarly situated’ (b)(4)\ncomparison classes must include commercial and indus-\ntrial taxpayers” because “[t]here is no conceivable reason\nwhy the statute would forbid property taxes higher than\nwhat that class enjoys (or suffers), but permit other taxes\nthat discriminate in favor of that class vis-à-vis railroads.”\nAnte, at 6. Where we part ways is in the inferences we\ndraw from the statutory context.\n   Treating subsection (b)(4) as a residual clause does not\nrequire the grammatical distortions that the majority\nalleges. The word “discriminates” in subsection (b)(4) is\nnot a referential phrase whose antecedent is uncertain. If\n6    ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nit were, then it would be necessary to select an antecedent\nthat would fit grammatically in place of “discriminates.”\nInstead, I look to (b)(1) to (3) merely to clarify an ambigu-\nity in the meaning of “discriminates,” a task that does not\nrequire me to “dragoon” the language of the prior clauses\ninto subsection (b)(4).\n   Nor does my approach rely on the first three clauses of\n§11501(b) to supply a general limitation on the independ­\nent prohibition that appears in subsection (b)(4). See\nUnited States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 615 (1995)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(criticizing this type of argument). That is what Alabama\nsought to do in CSX I when it argued that subsection (b)(4)\nis limited to property taxes (or their equivalent “in lieu”\ntaxes). Ante, at 7; CSX I, 562 U. S., at 285 (majority opin­\nion). I joined the majority in rejecting that argument. Id.,\nat 297 (dissenting opinion). But whereas there is no un­\ncertainty about the meaning of “taxes” in subsection (b)(4)\nthat would justify importing the property tax limitation\nfrom the three preceding subsections, id., at 284–285\n(majority opinion), there is a good deal of uncertainty\nabout the meaning of “discriminates.” This uncertainty\njustifies looking to the three previous clauses to under­\nstand the type of differential treatment §11501(b) is\nmeant to prohibit. Id., at 298–299 (dissenting opinion);\nsee Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 588–\n589 (1980). And those three previous clauses easily supply\nthe answer to the comparison class question.\n                             C\n  Unwilling to so limit the range of available comparison\nclasses, the majority takes an approach to determining\nwhich individuals are “similarly situated” for purposes of\nthe statute that “is almost entirely ad hoc,” James, supra,\nat 215 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). It asserts that the compar­\nison class will “depen[d] on the theory of discrimination\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nalleged in the claim.” Ante, at 4–5. Sometimes the com­\nparison class will be “all other commercial and industrial\ntaxpayers,” sometimes it will be “the railroad’s competi­\ntors” in a particular jurisdiction, and sometimes it may be\nsome other comparison class entirely. Id., at 5.\n   The sole evidence on which the majority relies to con­\nclude that competitors are similarly situated, and there­\nfore qualify as a comparison class, is the professed pur­\nposes of the Act: “to ‘restore the financial stability of the\nrailway system of the United States,’ while ‘foster[ing]\ncompetition among all carriers by railroad and other\nmodes of transportation.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quoting 90 Stat. 33,\n§§101(a), (b)(2)). Interpreting statutory text solely in light\nof purpose, absent any reliance on text or structure, is\ndangerous business because it places courts in peril of\nsubstituting their policy judgment for that of Congress. In\nconsidering statutory purpose, therefore, we should be\ncareful that any inferences of purpose are tied to text\nrather than instinct.\n   The majority throws such caution to the wind. Its two-\nsentence argument is a perfect illustration of the dangers\nof a purely purpose-based approach. The majority cherry-\npicks two of a number of stated goals of a complex piece of\nlegislation over 100 pages long and assumes that this\nspecific provision was assigned to those specific purposes.\nAnd then it interprets the statute to perform in the man­\nner the majority believes is best designed to “restore . . .\nfinancial stability” and “foster . . . competition.” Ante, at 6\n(alteration omitted).\n   I have no reason to doubt the economic soundness of the\nmajority’s conclusion that discrimination between rail\ncarriers and their competitors threatens their financial\nstability and impedes competition, but I lack the major-\nity’s certitude that §11501(b)(4) is designed to further those\ngoals by combatting that evil, at least in the way the ma­\njority asserts. Instead, the first three subsections provide\n8     ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nstrong textual evidence that §11501(b) was designed to\nstabilize rail carriers by protecting them from discrimina­\ntion against interstate commerce. And they provide evi­\ndence of Congress’ chosen mechanism for accomplishing\nthat goal: tying the fate of interstate rail carriers to the\nbroader class of commercial and industrial taxpayers. See\nsupra, at 2.\n   The introductory clause of §11501(b) provides further\nevidence that the evil at which subsection (b)(4) is tar-\ngeted is not discrimination between rail carriers and their\ncompetitors, but “acts [that] unreasonably burden and\ndiscriminate against interstate commerce.” The majority’s\nresponse to this evidence—that the Court rejected a simi­\nlar argument when it refused to limit subsection (b)(4) to\nproperty taxes or their kin, ante, at 7—is a non sequitur.\nThe introductory clause contains no reference to property\ntaxes that “binds its four subsections together” as prohibi­\ntions on discriminatory property taxes. Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But it does have a reference to\ndiscrimination against interstate commerce, which does\ntie the sections together to serve that common statutory\npurpose. This, in turn, weighs against the majority’s\ninferences about how §11501(b) relates to the stated pur­\nposes of the 4–R Act.\n   The majority’s conclusion that competitors are a permis­\nsible comparison class completely ignores these contextual\nclues, permitting subsection (b)(4) to serve different statu­\ntory goals by a different mechanism than its three prede­\ncessor clauses. And it leads to odd inconsistencies. If we\nwere to understand the provision as prohibiting only\ndiscrimination between rail carriers and their competitors,\nthen it might well further the goal of promoting competi­\ntion between interstate carriers. But the majority instead\nselects a shifting-comparison-class approach, requiring\nrail carriers to be treated at least as well as their competi­\ntors and any other similarly situated taxpayers. See ante,\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nat 4–5. This most-favored taxpayer status is a position the\ncompetitors do not enjoy, so the majority’s position could\nresult in tax schemes that impede competition between\ninterstate carriers rather than promote it.\n  Identifying “similarly situated” taxpayers by the undis­\nciplined approach the majority endorses could well lead to\nother unanticipated consequences. This is why the policy\njudgments needed to link statutory mechanisms to statu­\ntory purposes are best left to Congress. If this Court is\ngoing to adopt a shifting-comparison-class approach to\n§11501(b)(4), then it should at least demand a stronger\ntextual link between the comparison class a claimant\nseeks to import into subsection (b)(4) and any purpose that\nthe claimant argues it serves.\n                              III\n  Because the majority adopts an interpretation of\n§11501(b)(4) that is not grounded in the text, it should\ncome as no surprise that this interpretation is difficult to\napply, as this case demonstrates. It is easy to see how,\naccepting water carriers as a comparison class, the scheme\ntreats water carriers and rail carriers differently when it\ngrants water carriers, but not rail carriers, an exemption\nfrom the sales tax. Ala. Code §40–23–4(a)(10). Identifying\nthe difference in treatment between rail and motor car-\nriers, by contrast, requires a good deal more imagination.\n  The majority’s approach exhibits that imagination. It\nglosses over the general applicability of the provisions that\napply to rail and motor carriers, stating that “[t]he State\napplies the [sales or use] tax, at the usual 4% rate, to\nrailroads’ purchase or use of diesel fuel for their rail oper­\nations,” but “exempts from the tax purchases and uses of\ndiesel fuel made by [motor carriers].” Ante, at 1. A quick\nglimpse at the code reveals that this is not quite the case.\nThe applicability of the sales and use taxes does not de­\npend on the identity of the purchaser, but on whether the\n10    ALABAMA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. CSX TRANSP., INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npurchaser pays another excise tax, §40–17–325(b), which\nin turn depends on the nature of the product purchased\nand its use, §§40–17–328, 40–17–329, which in turn merely\ncorrelates to the carriers’ operations.\n   As far as I can tell, the rail carriers use dyed diesel that\nis exempt from the motor fuel tax—and therefore subject\nto the sales and use taxes—as a matter of choice rather\nthan necessity. Dyed diesel has no special properties that\nmake it more suitable for use in a train engine; the dye\nmerely identifies it as exempt from the federal excise tax,\n§40–17–322(21). And no law prohibits rail carriers from\nusing undyed diesel. To the contrary, it is the motor\ncarriers who are prohibited from using the dyed variant\nfor on-road use.\n   Assuming arguendo that state law provides that only\ndyed diesel may be used in rail operations, it becomes a\nlittle easier to make an argument that the State treats rail\ncarriers differently in this case. But the majority still\nfaces a line-drawing problem. Is it necessary that the good\nsubject to the challenged tax be the same as the good on\nwhich the competitor enjoys an exemption? Could a rail\ncarrier that relies on natural gas rather than diesel for\nmotive power make the same claim of discrimination if\nnatural gas is not entitled to the same sales-tax exemption\nas diesel? Is it necessary that the rail carrier and its\ncompetitor rely on the good for the same purpose? Could a\nrail carrier that uses diesel for motive power challenge a\nhypothetical provision that exempted from the sales and\nuse taxes diesel that motor carriers use for refrigeration in\nrefrigerated trailers?\n   The majority never answers these questions. “Sufficient\nunto the day is the evil thereof,” it intones. Ante, at 6.\n“That gets this case off our docket, sure enough. But it\nutterly fails to do what this Court is supposed to do: pro­\nvide guidance concrete enough to ensure that the” statute\nis applied consistently. James, 550 U.
