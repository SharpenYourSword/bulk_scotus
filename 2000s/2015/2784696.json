The RRCA Accounting Procedures are hereby re-\nformed as shown on the attached Appendix to be effective\nfor the accounting of Compact Year 2007 and thereafter.\n   2. Nebraska is not liable for evaporative losses from\nHarlan County Lake during 2006.\n   3. Evaporation from the Non-Federal Reservoirs located\nin Nebraska is a Beneficial Consumptive Use under the\nCompact and must be accounted for as such.\n   4. Nebraska\u2019s consumption in 2005 and 2006 exceeded\nits Compact allocation by 70,869 acre feet, said amount\nequaling the combined rather than average exceedences\n2                  KANSAS v.

Except as herein provided, the claims of all parties in\nthis action are denied and their prayers for relief dis-\nmissed with prejudice.\n  7. The parties\u2019 respective responsibilities for the fees\nand costs awarded to the Special Master are as follows:\nKansas (40%); Nebraska (40%); and Colorado (20%).\n  8. The parties\u2019 previous payments made to the Special\nMaster and the printer of the Report of the Special Master\ndischarge in full their respective obligations to pay for or\nshare among themselves fees and costs awarded to the\nSpecial Master together with any costs that might have\notherwise been assessed in this action.\n  9. The Court retains jurisdiction to entertain such\nfurther proceedings, enter such orders, and issue such\nwrits as it may from time to time deem necessary or desir-\nable to give proper force and effect to this Decree.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Imported Water Supply Credit Calculation:\nThe amount of Imported Water Supply Credit shall be\ndetermined by the RRCA Groundwater Model. The Im-\nported Water Supply Credit of a State shall not be includ-\ned in the Virgin Water Supply and shall be counted as a\ncredit/offset against the Computed Beneficial Consump-\ntive Use of water allocated to that State. Currently, the\nImported Water Supply Credits shall be determined using\ntwo runs of the RRCA Groundwater Model:\na. The \u201cbase\u201d run shall be the run with all groundwater\npumping, groundwater pumping recharge, and surface\nwater recharge within the model study boundary for the\ncurrent accounting year turned \u201con.\u201d This will be the\nsame \u201cbase\u201d run used to determine groundwater Comput-\ned Beneficial Consumptive Uses.\nb. The \u201cno NE import\u201d run shall be the run with the same\nmodel inputs as the base run with the exception that\nsurface water recharge associated with Nebraska\u2019s Im-\nported Water Supply shall be turned \u201coff.\u201d This will be the\nsame \u201cno NE import\u201d run used to determine groundwater\nComputed Beneficial Consumptive Uses.\nThe Imported Water Supply Credit shall be the difference\nin stream flows between these two model runs. Differ-\nences in stream flows shall be determined at the same\nlocations as identified in Subsection III.D.1 for the \u201cno\npumping\u201d runs.\nShould another State import water into the Basin in the\nfuture, the RRCA will develop a similar procedure to\ndetermine Imported Water Supply Credits.\n4                 KANSAS v. NEBRASKA\n\n                          Decree\n                     Appendix to Decree\n\nIII D. Calculation of Annual Computed Beneficial\n    Consumptive Use\n1. Groundwater\nComputed Beneficial Consumptive Use of groundwater\nshall be determined by use of the RRCA Groundwater\nModel. The Computed Beneficial Consumptive Use of\ngroundwater for each State shall be determined as the\ndifference in streamflows using two runs of the model:\nThe \u201cbase no NE import\u201d run shall be the run with all\ngroundwater pumping, groundwater pumping recharge,\nand surface water recharge within the model study\nboundary for the current accounting year \u201con\u201d, with the\nexception that surface water recharge associated with\nNebraska\u2019s Imported Water Supply shall be turned \u201coff.\u201d\nThe \u201cno State pumping\u201d run shall be the run with the\nsame model inputs as the \u201cbase no NE import\u201d run with\nthe exception that all groundwater pumping and pumping\nrecharge of that State shall be turned \u201coff.\u201d\nAn output of the model is baseflows at selected stream\ncells. Changes in the baseflows predicted by the model\nbetween the \u201cbase no NE import\u201d run and the \u201cno-State-\npumping\u201d model run is assumed to be the depletions to\nstreamflows. i.e., groundwater computed beneficial con-\nsumptive use, due to State groundwater pumping at that\nlocation. The values for each Sub-basin will include all\ndepletions and accretions upstream of the confluence with\nthe Main Stem. The values for the Main Stem will include\nall depletions and accretions in stream reaches not other-\nwise accounted for in a Sub-basin. The values for the\nMain Stem will be computed separately for the reach\nabove Guide Rock, and the reach below Guide Rock.\n*Taken from the August 12, 2010, Accounting Procedures.\n",
