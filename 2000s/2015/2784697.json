Argued December 8, 2014\u2014Decided March 9, 2015\nIn 1970, Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation\n  (Amtrak). Congress has given Amtrak priority to use track systems\n  owned by the freight railroads for passenger rail travel, at rates\n  agreed to by the parties or, in case of a dispute, set by the Surface\n  Transportation Board. And in 2008, Congress gave Amtrak and the\n  Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) joint authority to issue \u201cmet-\n  rics and standards\u201d addressing the performance and scheduling of\n  passenger railroad services, see \u00a7207(a), 122 Stat. 4907, including\n  Amtrak\u2019s on-time performance and train delays caused by host rail-\n  roads. Respondent, the Association of American Railroads, sued peti-\n  tioners\u2014the Department of Transportation, the FRA, and two offi-\n  cials\u2014claiming that the metrics and standards must be invalidated\n  because it is unconstitutional for Congress to allow and direct a pri-\n  vate entity like Amtrak to exercise joint authority in their issuance.\n  Its argument rested on the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause\n  and the constitutional provisions regarding separation of powers.\n  The District Court rejected respondent\u2019s claims, but the District of\n  Columbia Circuit reversed as to the separation of powers claim, rea-\n  soning in central part that Amtrak is a private corporation and thus\n  cannot constitutionally be granted regulatory power under \u00a7207.\nHeld: For purposes of determining the validity of the metrics and\n standards, Amtrak is a governmental entity. Pp. 6\u201312.\n    (a) In concluding otherwise, the Court of Appeals relied on the\n statutory command that Amtrak \u201cis not a department, agency, or in-\n strumentality of the United States Government,\u201d 49 U. S. C.\n \u00a724301(a)(3), and the pronouncement that Amtrak \u201cshall be operated\n and managed as a for profit corporation,\u201d \u00a724301(a)(2). But congres-\n2    DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                 AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                        Syllabus\n\n\n    sional pronouncements are not dispositive of Amtrak\u2019s status as a\n    governmental entity for purposes of separation of powers analysis\n    under the Constitution, and an independent inquiry reveals the\n    Court of Appeals\u2019 premise that Amtrak is a private entity was flawed.\n    As Amtrak\u2019s ownership and corporate structure show, the political\n    branches control most of Amtrak\u2019s stock and its Board of Directors,\n    most of whom are appointed by the President, \u00a724302(a)(1), con-\n    firmed by the Senate, ibid., and understood by the Executive Branch\n    to be removable by the President at will. The political branches also\n    exercise substantial, statutorily mandated supervision over Amtrak\u2019s\n    priorities and operations. See, e.g., \u00a724315. Also of significance,\n    Amtrak is required by statute to pursue broad public objectives, see,\n    e.g., \u00a7\u00a724101(b), 24307(a); certain aspects of Amtrak\u2019s day-to-day op-\n    erations are mandated by Congress, see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a724101(c)(6), 24902(b);\n    and Amtrak has been dependent on federal financial support during\n    every year of its existence. Given the combination of these unique\n    features and Amtrak\u2019s significant ties to the Government, Amtrak is\n    not an autonomous private enterprise. Amtrak was created by the\n    Government, is controlled by the Government, and operates for the\n    Government\u2019s benefit. Thus, in jointly issuing the metrics and\n    standards with the FRA, Amtrak acted as a governmental entity for\n    separation of powers purposes. And that exercise of governmental\n    power must be consistent with the Constitution, including those pro-\n    visions relating to the separation of powers. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (b) Respondent\u2019s reliance on congressional statements about\n    Amtrak\u2019s status is misplaced. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger\n    Corp., 513 U. S. 374, teaches that, for purposes of Amtrak\u2019s status as\n    a federal actor or instrumentality under the Constitution, the practi-\n    cal reality of federal control and supervision prevails over Congress\u2019\n    disclaimer of Amtrak\u2019s governmental status. Treating Amtrak as\n    governmental for these purposes, moreover, is not an unbridled grant\n    of authority to an unaccountable actor, for the political branches cre-\n    ated Amtrak, control its Board, define its mission, specify many of its\n    day-to-day operations, have imposed substantial transparency and\n    accountability mechanisms, and, for all practical purposes, set and\n    supervise its annual budget. Pp. 10\u201311.\n       (c) The Court of Appeals may address in the first instance any\n    properly preserved issues respecting the lawfulness of the metrics\n    and standards that may remain in this case, including questions im-\n    plicating the Constitution\u2019s structural separation of powers and the\n    Appointments Clause.

ASSOCIATION OF\n\n            AMERICAN RAILROADS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 9, 2015] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 1970, Congress created the National Railroad Pas\u00ad\nsenger Corporation, most often known as Amtrak. Later,\nCongress granted Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Ad\u00ad\nministration (FRA) joint authority to issue \u201cmetrics and\nstandards\u201d that address the performance and scheduling\nof passenger railroad services. Alleging that the metrics\nand standards have substantial and adverse effects upon\nits members\u2019 freight services, respondent\u2014the Association\nof American Railroads\u2014filed this suit to challenge their\nvalidity. The defendants below, petitioners here, are the\nDepartment of Transportation, the FRA, and two individ\u00ad\nuals sued in their official capacity.\n   Respondent alleges the metrics and standards must be\ninvalidated on the ground that Amtrak is a private entity\nand it was therefore unconstitutional for Congress to allow\nand direct it to exercise joint authority in their issuance.\nThis argument rests on the Fifth Amendment Due Process\nClause and the constitutional provisions regarding separa\u00ad\ntion of powers. The District Court rejected both of re\u00ad\n2   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nspondent\u2019s claims. The Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit reversed, finding that, for purposes of\nthis dispute, Amtrak is a private entity and that Congress\nviolated nondelegation principles in its grant of joint\nauthority to Amtrak and the FRA. On that premise the\nCourt of Appeals invalidated the metrics and standards.\n  Having granted the petition for writ of certiorari, 573\nU. S. ___ (2014), this Court now holds that, for purposes of\ndetermining the validity of the metrics and standards,\nAmtrak is a governmental entity. Although Amtrak\u2019s\nactions here were governmental, substantial questions\nrespecting the lawfulness of the metrics and standards\u2014\nincluding questions implicating the Constitution\u2019s struc\u00ad\ntural separation of powers and the Appointments Clause,\nU. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2\u2014may still remain in the case.\nAs those matters have not yet been passed upon by the\nCourt of Appeals, this case is remanded.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Amtrak is a corporation established and authorized by a\ndetailed federal statute enacted by Congress for no less a\npurpose than to preserve passenger services and routes on\nour Nation\u2019s railroads. See Lebron v. National Railroad\nPassenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 383\u2013384 (1995);\nNational Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchison, T. &\nS. F. R. Co., 470 U. S. 451, 453\u2013457 (1985); see also Rail\nPassenger Service Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1328. Congress\nrecognized that Amtrak, of necessity, must rely for most of\nits operations on track systems owned by the freight rail\u00ad\nroads. So, as a condition of relief from their common-\ncarrier duties, Congress required freight railroads to allow\nAmtrak to use their tracks and facilities at rates agreed to\nby the parties\u2014or in the event of disagreement to be set\nby the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). See 45\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7561, 562 (1970 ed.). The Surface Transporta\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion Board (STB) now occupies the dispute-resolution role\noriginally assigned to the ICC. See 49 U. S. C. \u00a724308(a)\n(2012 ed.). Since 1973, Amtrak has received a statutory\npreference over freight transportation in using rail lines,\njunctions, and crossings. See \u00a724308(c).\n   The metrics and standards at issue here are the result\nof a further and more recent enactment. Concerned by\npoor service, unreliability, and delays resulting from\nfreight traffic congestion, Congress passed the Passenger\nRail Investment and Improvement Act (PRIIA) in 2008.\nSee 122 Stat. 4907. Section 207(a) of the PRIIA provides\nfor the creation of the metrics and standards:\n      \u201cWithin 180 days after the date of enactment of this\n    Act, the Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak\n    shall jointly, in consultation with the Surface Trans\u00ad\n    portation Board, rail carriers over whose rail lines\n    Amtrak trains operate, States, Amtrak employees,\n    nonprofit employee organizations representing\n    Amtrak employees, and groups representing Amtrak\n    passengers, as appropriate, develop new or improve\n    existing metrics and minimum standards for measur\u00ad\n    ing the performance and service quality of intercity\n    passenger train operations, including cost recovery,\n    on-time performance and minutes of delay, ridership,\n    on-board services, stations, facilities, equipment, and\n    other services.\u201d Id., at 4916.\nSection 207(d) of the PRIIA further provides:\n       \u201cIf the development of the metrics and standards is\n    not completed within the 180-day period required by\n    subsection (a), any party involved in the development\n    of those standards may petition the Surface Transpor\u00ad\n    tation Board to appoint an arbitrator to assist the\n    parties in resolving their disputes through binding\n    arbitration.\u201d Id., at 4917.\n4   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   The PRIIA specifies that the metrics and standards\ncreated under \u00a7207(a) are to be used for a variety of pur\u00ad\nposes. Section 207(b) requires the FRA to \u201cpublish a\nquarterly report on the performance and service quality of\nintercity passenger train operations\u201d addressing the spe\u00ad\ncific elements to be measured by the metrics and stand\u00ad\nards. Id., at 4916\u20134917. Section 207(c) provides that, \u201c[t]o\nthe extent practicable, Amtrak and its host rail carriers\nshall incorporate the metrics and standards developed\nunder subsection (a) into their access and service agree\u00ad\nments.\u201d Id., at 4917. And \u00a7222(a) obliges Amtrak, within\none year after the metrics and standards are established,\nto \u201cdevelop and implement a plan to improve on-board\nservice pursuant to the metrics and standards for such\nservice developed under [\u00a7207(a)].\u201d Id., at 4932.\n   Under \u00a7213(a) of the PRIIA, the metrics and standards\nalso may play a role in prompting investigations by the\nSTB and in subsequent enforcement actions. For instance,\n\u201c[i]f the on-time performance of any intercity passenger\ntrain averages less than 80 percent for any 2 consecutive\ncalendar quarters,\u201d the STB may initiate an investigation\n\u201cto determine whether and to what extent delays . . . are\ndue to causes that could reasonably be addressed . . . by\nAmtrak or other intercity passenger rail operators.\u201d Id.,\nat 4925\u20134926. While conducting an investigation under\n\u00a7213(a), the STB \u201chas authority to review the accuracy of\nthe train performance data and the extent to which sched\u00ad\nuling and congestion contribute to delays\u201d and shall \u201cob\u00ad\ntain information from all parties involved and identify\nreasonable measures and make recommendations to im\u00ad\nprove the service, quality, and on-time performance of the\ntrain.\u201d Id., at 4926. Following an investigation, the STB\nmay award damages if it \u201cdetermines that delays or fail\u00ad\nures to achieve minimum standards . . . are attributable to\na rail carrier\u2019s failure to provide preference to Amtrak over\nfreight transportation.\u201d Ibid. The STB is further empow\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nered to \u201corder the host rail carrier to remit\u201d damages \u201cto\nAmtrak or to an entity for which Amtrak operates inter\u00ad\ncity passenger rail service.\u201d Ibid.\n                               B\n   In March 2009, Amtrak and the FRA published a notice\nin the Federal Register inviting comments on a draft\nversion of the metrics and standards. App. 75\u201376. The\nfinal version of the metrics and standards was issued\njointly by Amtrak and the FRA in May 2010. Id., at 129\u2013\n144. The metrics and standards address, among other\nmatters, Amtrak\u2019s financial performance, its scores on\nconsumer satisfaction surveys, and the percentage of\npassenger-trips to and from underserved communities.\n   Of most importance for this case, the metrics and stand\u00ad\nards also address Amtrak\u2019s on-time performance and train\ndelays caused by host railroads. The standards associated\nwith the on-time performance metrics require on-time\nperformance by Amtrak trains at least 80% to 95% of the\ntime for each route, depending on the route and year. Id.,\nat 133\u2013135. With respect to \u201chost-responsible delays\u201d\u2014\nthat is to say, delays attributed to the railroads along\nwhich Amtrak trains travel\u2014the metrics and standards\nprovide that \u201c[d]elays must not be more than 900 minutes\nper 10,000 Train-Miles.\u201d Id., at 138. Amtrak conductors\ndetermine responsibility for particular delays. Ibid., n. 23.\n    In the District Court for the District of Columbia, re\u00ad\nspondent alleged injury to its members from being re\u00ad\nquired to modify their rail operations, which mostly in\u00ad\nvolve freight traffic, to satisfy the metrics and standards.\nRespondent claimed that \u00a7207 \u201cviolates the nondelegation\ndoctrine and the separation of powers principle by placing\nlegislative and rulemaking authority in the hands of a\nprivate entity [Amtrak] that participates in the very in\u00ad\ndustry it is supposed to regulate.\u201d Id., at 176\u2013177, Com\u00ad\nplaint \u00b651. Respondent also asserted that \u00a7207 violates\n6   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause by \u201c[v]esting\nthe coercive power of the government\u201d in Amtrak, an\n\u201cinterested private part[y].\u201d Id., at 177, \u00b6\u00b653\u201354. In its\nprayer for relief respondent sought, among other reme\u00ad\ndies, a declaration of \u00a7207\u2019s unconstitutionality and inval\u00ad\nidation of the metrics and standards. Id., at 177.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment to peti\u00ad\ntioners on both claims. See 865 F. Supp. 2d 22 (DC 2012).\nWithout deciding whether Amtrak must be deemed pri\u00ad\nvate or governmental, it rejected respondent\u2019s nondelega\u00ad\ntion argument on the ground that the FRA, the STB, and\nthe political branches exercised sufficient control over\npromulgation and enforcement of the metrics and stand\u00ad\nards so that \u00a7207 is constitutional. See id., at 35.\n   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir\u00ad\ncuit reversed the judgment of the District Court as to the\nnondelegation and separation of powers claim, reasoning\nin central part that because \u201cAmtrak is a private corpora\u00ad\ntion with respect to Congress\u2019s power to delegate . . . au\u00ad\nthority,\u201d it cannot constitutionally be granted the \u201cregula\u00ad\ntory power prescribed in \u00a7207.\u201d 721 F. 3d 666, 677 (2013).\nThe Court of Appeals did not reach respondent\u2019s due\nprocess claim. See ibid.\n                               II\n  In holding that Congress may not delegate to Amtrak\nthe joint authority to issue the metrics and standards\u2014\nauthority it described as \u201cregulatory power,\u201d ibid.\u2014the\nCourt of Appeals concluded Amtrak is a private entity for\npurposes of determining its status when considering the\nconstitutionality of its actions in the instant dispute. That\ncourt\u2019s analysis treated as controlling Congress\u2019 statutory\ncommand that Amtrak \u201c \u2018is not a department, agency, or\ninstrumentality of the United States Government.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 675 (quoting 49 U. S. C. \u00a724301(a)(3)). The Court of\nAppeals also relied on Congress\u2019 pronouncement that\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAmtrak \u201c \u2018shall be operated and managed as a for-profit\ncorporation.\u2019 \u201d 721 F. 3d, at 675 (quoting \u00a724301(a)(2)); see\nalso id., at 677 (\u201cThough the federal government\u2019s in\u00ad\nvolvement in Amtrak is considerable, Congress has both\ndesignated it a private corporation and instructed that it\nbe managed so as to maximize profit.            In deciding\nAmtrak\u2019s status for purposes of congressional delegations,\nthese declarations are dispositive\u201d). Proceeding from this\npremise, the Court of Appeals concluded it was impermis\u00ad\nsible for Congress to \u201cdelegate regulatory authority to a\nprivate entity.\u201d Id., at 670; see also ibid. (holding Carter\nv. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238 (1936), prohibits any\nsuch delegation of authority).\n   That premise, however, was erroneous. Congressional\npronouncements, though instructive as to matters within\nCongress\u2019 authority to address, see, e.g., United States\nex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp., 380 F. 3d 488, 491\u2013492\n(CADC 2004) (Roberts, J.), are not dispositive of Amtrak\u2019s\nstatus as a governmental entity for purposes of separation\nof powers analysis under the Constitution. And an inde\u00ad\npendent inquiry into Amtrak\u2019s status under the Constitu\u00ad\ntion reveals the Court of Appeals\u2019 premise was flawed.\n   It is appropriate to begin the analysis with Amtrak\u2019s\nownership and corporate structure. The Secretary of\nTransportation holds all of Amtrak\u2019s preferred stock and\nmost of its common stock. Amtrak\u2019s Board of Directors is\ncomposed of nine members, one of whom is the Secretary\nof Transportation.      Seven other Board members are\nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n49 U. S. C. \u00a724302(a)(1). These eight Board members,\nin turn, select Amtrak\u2019s president.         \u00a724302(a)(1)(B);\n\u00a724303(a). Amtrak\u2019s Board members are subject to salary\nlimits set by Congress, \u00a724303(b); and the Executive\nBranch has concluded that all appointed Board members\nare removable by the President without cause, see 27 Op.\nAtty. Gen. 163 (2003).\n8   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF \n\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  Under further statutory provisions, Amtrak\u2019s Board\nmembers must possess certain qualifications. Congress\nhas directed that the President make appointments based\non an individual\u2019s prior experience in the transportation\nindustry, \u00a724302(a)(1)(C), and has provided that not more\nthan five of the seven appointed Board members be from\nthe same political party, \u00a724302(a)(3).        In selecting\nAmtrak\u2019s Board members, moreover, the President must\nconsult with leaders of both parties in both Houses of\nCongress in order to \u201cprovide adequate and balanced\nrepresentation of the major geographic regions of the\nUnited States served by Amtrak.\u201d \u00a724302(a)(2).\n  In addition to controlling Amtrak\u2019s stock and Board of\nDirectors the political branches exercise substantial,\nstatutorily mandated supervision over Amtrak\u2019s priorities\nand operations. Amtrak must submit numerous annual\nreports to Congress and the President, detailing such\ninformation as route-specific ridership and on-time per\u00ad\nformance. \u00a724315. The Freedom of Information Act ap\u00ad\nplies to Amtrak in any year in which it receives a federal\nsubsidy, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552, which thus far has been every\nyear of its existence. Pursuant to its status under the\nInspector General Act of 1978 as a \u201c \u2018designated Federal\nentity,\u2019 \u201d 5 U. S. C. App. \u00a78G(a)(2), p. 521, Amtrak must\nmaintain an inspector general, much like governmental\nagencies such as the Federal Communications Commis\u00ad\nsion and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Fur\u00ad\nthermore, Congress conducts frequent oversight hearings\ninto Amtrak\u2019s budget, routes, and prices. See, e.g., Hear\u00ad\ning on Reviewing Alternatives to Amtrak\u2019s Annual Losses\nin Food and Beverage Service before the Subcommittee on\nGovernment Operations of the House Committee on Over\u00ad\nsight and Government Reform, 113th Cong., 1st Sess., 5\n(2013) (statement of Thomas J. Hall, chief of customer\nservice, Amtrak); Hearing on Amtrak\u2019s Fiscal Year 2014\nBudget: The Starting Point for Reauthorization before the\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSubcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous\nMaterials of the House Committee on Transportation and\nInfrastructure, 113th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6 (2013) (state\u00ad\nment of Joseph H. Boardman, president and chief execu\u00ad\ntive officer, Amtrak).\n   It is significant that, rather than advancing its own\nprivate economic interests, Amtrak is required to pursue\nnumerous, additional goals defined by statute. To take a\nfew examples: Amtrak must \u201cprovide efficient and effec\u00ad\ntive intercity passenger rail mobility,\u201d 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a724101(b); \u201cminimize Government subsidies,\u201d \u00a724101(d);\nprovide reduced fares to the disabled and elderly,\n\u00a724307(a); and ensure mobility in times of national disas\u00ad\nter, \u00a724101(c)(9).\n   In addition to directing Amtrak to serve these broad\npublic objectives, Congress has mandated certain aspects\nof Amtrak\u2019s day-to-day operations. Amtrak must main\u00ad\ntain a route between Louisiana and Florida. \u00a724101(c)(6).\nWhen making improvements to the Northeast corridor,\nAmtrak must apply seven considerations in a specified\norder of priority. \u00a724902(b). And when Amtrak purchases\nmaterials worth more than $1 million, these materials\nmust be mined or produced in the United States, or manu\u00ad\nfactured substantially from components that are mined,\nproduced, or manufactured in the United States, unless\nthe Secretary of Transportation grants an exemption.\n\u00a724305(f).\n   Finally, Amtrak is also dependent on federal financial\nsupport. In its first 43 years of operation, Amtrak has\nreceived more than $41 billion in federal subsidies. In\nrecent years these subsidies have exceeded $1 billion\nannually. See Brief for Petitioners 5, and n. 2, 46.\n   Given the combination of these unique features and its\nsignificant ties to the Government, Amtrak is not an\nautonomous private enterprise. Among other important\nconsiderations, its priorities, operations, and decisions are\n10 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nextensively supervised and substantially funded by the\npolitical branches. A majority of its Board is appointed by\nthe President and confirmed by the Senate and is under\u00ad\nstood by the Executive to be removable by the President at\nwill. Amtrak was created by the Government, is con\u00ad\ntrolled by the Government, and operates for the Govern\u00ad\nment\u2019s benefit. Thus, in its joint issuance of the metrics\nand standards with the FRA, Amtrak acted as a govern\u00ad\nmental entity for purposes of the Constitution\u2019s separation\nof powers provisions. And that exercise of governmental\npower must be consistent with the design and require\u00ad\nments of the Constitution, including those provisions\nrelating to the separation of powers.\n  Respondent urges that Amtrak cannot be deemed a\ngovernmental entity in this respect. Like the Court of\nAppeals, it relies principally on the statutory directives\nthat Amtrak \u201cshall be operated and managed as a for\nprofit corporation\u201d and \u201cis not a department, agency, or\ninstrumentality of the United States Government.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a724301(a)(2)\u2013(3). In light of that statutory language,\nrespondent asserts, Amtrak cannot exercise the joint\nauthority entrusted to it and the FRA by \u00a7207(a).\n  On that point this Court\u2019s decision in Lebron v. National\nRailroad Passenger Corp., 513 U. S. 374 (1995), provides\nnecessary instruction. In Lebron, Amtrak prohibited an\nartist from installing a politically controversial display in\nNew York City\u2019s Penn Station. The artist sued Amtrak,\nalleging a violation of his First Amendment rights. In\nresponse Amtrak asserted that it was not a governmental\nentity, explaining that \u201cits charter\u2019s disclaimer of agency\nstatus prevent[ed] it from being considered a Government\nentity.\u201d Id., at 392. The Court rejected this contention,\nholding \u201cit is not for Congress to make the final determi\u00ad\nnation of Amtrak\u2019s status as a Government entity for\npurposes of determining the constitutional rights of citi\u00ad\nzens affected by its actions.\u201d Ibid. To hold otherwise\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould allow the Government \u201cto evade the most solemn\nobligations imposed in the Constitution by simply resort\u00ad\ning to the corporate form.\u201d Id., at 397. Noting that\nAmtrak \u201cis established and organized under federal law\nfor the very purpose of pursuing federal governmental\nobjectives, under the direction and control of federal gov\u00ad\nernmental appointees,\u201d id., at 398, and that the Govern\u00ad\nment exerts its control over Amtrak \u201cnot as a creditor but\nas a policymaker,\u201d the Court held Amtrak \u201cis an agency or\ninstrumentality of the United States for the purpose of\nindividual rights guaranteed against the Government by\nthe Constitution.\u201d Id., at 394, 399.\n   Lebron teaches that, for purposes of Amtrak\u2019s status as\na federal actor or instrumentality under the Constitution,\nthe practical reality of federal control and supervision\nprevails over Congress\u2019 disclaimer of Amtrak\u2019s governmen\u00ad\ntal status. Lebron involved a First Amendment question,\nwhile in this case the challenge is to Amtrak\u2019s joint au\u00ad\nthority to issue the metrics and standards. But \u201c[t]he\nstructural principles secured by the separation of powers\nprotect the individual as well.\u201d Bond v. United States, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10). Treating Amtrak as\ngovernmental for these purposes, moreover, is not an\nunbridled grant of authority to an unaccountable actor.\nThe political branches created Amtrak, control its Board,\ndefine its mission, specify many of its day-to-day opera\u00ad\ntions, have imposed substantial transparency and ac\u00ad\ncountability mechanisms, and, for all practical purposes,\nset and supervise its annual budget. Accordingly, the\nCourt holds that Amtrak is a governmental entity, not a\nprivate one, for purposes of determining the constitutional\nissues presented in this case.\n                           III\n   Because the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was based on the\nflawed premise that Amtrak should be treated as a private\n12 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nentity, that opinion is now vacated. On remand, the Court\nof Appeals, after identifying the issues that are properly\npreserved and before it, will then have the instruction of\nthe analysis set forth here. Respondent argues that the\nselection of Amtrak\u2019s president, who is appointed \u201cnot by\nthe President . . . but by the other eight Board Members,\u201d\n\u201ccall[s] into question Amtrak\u2019s structure under the Ap\u00ad\npointments Clause,\u201d Brief for Respondent 42; that\n\u00a7207(d)\u2019s arbitrator provision \u201cis a plain violation of the\nnondelegation principle\u201d and the Appointments Clause\nrequiring invalidation of \u00a7207(a), id., at 26; and that Con\u00ad\ngress violated the Due Process Clause by \u201cgiv[ing] a feder\u00ad\nally chartered, nominally private, for-profit corporation\nregulatory authority over its own industry,\u201d id., at 43.\nPetitioners, in turn, contend that \u201cthe metrics and stand\u00ad\nards do not reflect the exercise of \u2018rulemaking\u2019 authority or\npermit Amtrak to \u2018regulate other private entities,\u2019 \u201d and\nthus do not raise nondelegation concerns.

Ante, at 11. \u201cAmtrak was created by the Gov-\nernment, is controlled by the Government, and operates\nfor the Government\u2019s benefit.\u201d Ante, at 10.

The District of Columbia\nCircuit understandably heeded 49 U. S. C. \u00a724301(a)(3),\nwhich proclaims that Amtrak \u201cis not a department, agency,\nor instrumentality of the United States Government,\u201d\nbut this statutory label cannot control for constitutional\npurposes. (Emphasis added). I therefore join the Court\u2019s\nopinion in full. I write separately to discuss what follows\nfrom our judgment.\n                              I\n  This case, on its face, may seem to involve technical\nissues, but in discussing trains, tracks, metrics, and\nstandards, a vital constitutional principle must not be\nforgotten: Liberty requires accountability.\n  When citizens cannot readily identify the source of\nlegislation or regulation that affects their lives, Govern-\n2   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\nment officials can wield power without owning up to the\nconsequences. One way the Government can regulate\nwithout accountability is by passing off a Government\noperation as an independent private concern. Given this\nincentive to regulate without saying so, everyone should\npay close attention when Congress \u201csponsor[s] corpora-\ntions that it specifically designate[s] not to be agencies or\nestablishments of the United States Government.\u201d Lebron\nv. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S.\n374, 390 (1995).\n   Recognition that Amtrak is part of the Federal Govern-\nment raises a host of constitutional questions.\n                               II\n   I begin with something that may seem mundane on its\nface but that has a significant relationship to the principle\nof accountability. Under the Constitution, all officers of\nthe United States must take an oath or affirmation to\nsupport the Constitution and must receive a commission.\nSee Art. VI, cl. 3 (\u201c[A]ll executive and judicial Officers . . .\nshall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this\nConstitution\u201d); Art. II, \u00a73, cl. 6 (The President \u201cshall\nCommission all the Officers of the United States\u201d). There\nis good reason to think that those who have not sworn an\noath cannot exercise significant authority of the United\nStates. See 14 Op. Atty. Gen. 406, 408 (1874) (\u201c[A] Repre-\nsentative . . . does not become a member of the House until\nhe takes the oath of office\u201d); 15 Op. Atty. Gen. 280, 281\n(1877) (similar).* And this Court certainly has never\ntreated a commission from the President as a mere wall\nornament. See, e.g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n156 (1803); see also id., at 179 (noting the importance of\nan oath).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * It is noteworthy that the first statute enacted by Congress was \u201cAn\nAct to regulate the Time and Manner of administering certain Oaths.\u201d\nAct of June 1, 1789, ch. 1, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 23.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n  Both the Oath and Commission Clauses confirm an\nimportant point: Those who exercise the power of Gov-\nernment are set apart from ordinary citizens. Because\nthey exercise greater power, they are subject to special\nrestraints. There should never be a question whether\nsomeone is an officer of the United States because, to be\nan officer, the person should have sworn an oath and\npossess a commission.\n  Here, respondent tells the Court that \u201cAmtrak\u2019s board\nmembers do not take an oath of office to uphold the Con-\nstitution, as do Article II officers vested with rulemaking\nauthority.\u201d Brief for Respondent 47. The Government\nsays not a word in response. Perhaps there is an answer.\nThe rule, however, is clear. Because Amtrak is the Gov-\nernment, ante, at 11, those who run it need to satisfy basic\nconstitutional requirements.\n                              III\n   I turn next to the Passenger Rail Investment and Im-\nprovement Act of 2008\u2019s (PRIIA) arbitration provision.\n122 Stat. 4907. Section 207(a) of the PRIIA provides that\n\u201cthe Federal Railroad Administration [(FRA)] and Amtrak\nshall jointly . . . develop new or improve existing metrics\nand minimum standards for measuring the performance\nand service quality of intercity passenger train opera-\ntions.\u201d Id., at 4916. In addition, \u00a7207(c) commands that\n\u201c[t]o the extent practicable, Amtrak and its host rail carri-\ners shall incorporate [those] metrics and standards . . .\ninto their access and service agreements.\u201d Under \u00a7213(a)\nof the PRIIA, moreover, \u201cthe metrics and standards also\nmay play a role in prompting investigations by the [Sur-\nface Transportation Board (STB)] and in subsequent\nenforcement actions.\u201d Ante, at 4.\n   This scheme is obviously regulatory. Section 207 pro-\nvides that Amtrak and the FRA \u201cshall jointly\u201d create new\nstandards, cf. e.g., 12 U. S. C. \u00a71831m(g)(4)(B) (\u201cThe ap-\n4   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\npropriate Federal banking agencies shall jointly issue\nrules of practice to implement this paragraph\u201d), and that\nAmtrak and private rail carriers \u201cshall incorporate\u201d those\nstandards into their agreements whenever \u201cpracticable,\u201d\ncf. e.g., BP America Production Co. v. Burton, 549 U. S. 84,\n88 (2006) (characterizing a command to \u201c \u2018audit and recon-\ncile, to the extent practicable, all current and past lease\naccounts\u2019 \u201d as creating \u201cduties\u201d for the Secretary of the\nInterior (quoting 30 U. S. C. \u00a71711(c)(1))). The fact that\nprivate rail carriers sometimes may be required by federal\nlaw to include the metrics and standards in their contracts\nby itself makes this a regulatory scheme.\n   \u201cAs is often the case in administrative law,\u201d moreover,\n\u201cthe metrics and standards lend definite regulatory force\nto an otherwise broad statutory mandate.\u201d 721 F. 3d 666,\n672 (CADC 2013). Here, though the nexus between regu-\nlation, statutory mandate, and penalty is not direct (for, as\nthe Government explains, there is a pre-existing require-\nment that railroads give preference to Amtrak, see Brief\nfor Petitioners 31\u201332 (citing 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a724308(c), (f )),\nthe metrics and standards inherently have a \u201ccoercive\neffect,\u201d Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 169 (1997), on\nprivate conduct. Even the United States concedes, with\nunderstatement, that there is \u201cperhaps some incentivizing\neffect associated with the metrics and standards.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 30. Because obedience to the metrics and\nstandards materially reduces the risk of liability, railroads\nface powerful incentives to obey. See Bennett, supra, at\n169\u2013171. That is regulatory power.\n   The language from \u00a7207 quoted thus far should raise\nred flags. In one statute, Congress says Amtrak is not an\n\u201cagency.\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a724301(a)(3). But then Congress\ncommands Amtrak to act like an agency, with effects on\nprivate rail carriers. No wonder the D. C. Circuit ruled as\nit did.\n   The oddity continues, however. Section 207(d) of the\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nPRIIA also provides that if the FRA and Amtrak cannot\nagree about what the regulatory standards should say,\nthen \u201cany party involved in the development of those\nstandards may petition the Surface Transportation Board\nto appoint an arbitrator to assist the parties in resolving\ntheir disputes through binding arbitration.\u201d 122 Stat.\n4917. The statute says nothing more about this \u201cbinding\narbitration,\u201d including who the arbitrator should be.\n   Looking to Congress\u2019 use of the word \u201carbitrator,\u201d re-\nspondent argues that because the arbitrator can be a\nprivate person, this provision by itself violates the pri-\nvate nondelegation doctrine. The United States, for its\npart, urges the Court to read the term \u201carbitrator\u201d to\nmean \u201cpublic arbitrator\u201d in the interests of constitutional\navoidance.\n   No one disputes, however, that the arbitration provision\nis fair game for challenge, even though no arbitration\noccurred. The obvious purpose of the arbitration provision\nwas to force Amtrak and the FRA to compromise, or else a\nthird party would make the decision for them. The D. C.\nCircuit is correct that when Congress enacts a compromise-\nforcing mechanism, it is no good to say that the mech-\nanism cannot be challenged because the parties com-\npromised. See 721 F. 3d, at 674. \u201c[S]tack[ing] the deck\nin favor of compromise\u201d was the whole point. Ibid.\nUnsurprisingly, this Court has upheld standing to bring a\nseparation-of-powers challenge in comparable circum-\nstances. See Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority\nv. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.

Even the United States\naccepts that Congress \u201ccannot delegate regulatory author-\nity to a private entity.\u201d 721 F. 3d, at 670. Indeed, Con-\ngress, vested with enumerated \u201clegislative Powers,\u201d Art. I,\n\u00a71, cannot delegate its \u201cexclusively legislative\u201d authority\nat all. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42\u201343 (1825)\n(Marshall, C. J.). The Court has invalidated statutes for\nthat very reason. See A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.\nUnited States; 295 U. S. 495 (1935); Panama Refining Co.\nv. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935); see also Mistretta v. United\nStates, 488 U. S. 361, 373, n. 7 (1989) (citing, inter alia,\nIndustrial Union Dept., AFL\u2013CIO v. American Petroleum\nInstitute, 448 U. S. 607, 646 (1980)).\n   The principle that Congress cannot delegate away its\nvested powers exists to protect liberty. Our Constitution,\nby careful design, prescribes a process for making law, and\nwithin that process there are many accountability check-\npoints. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 959 (1983). It\nwould dash the whole scheme if Congress could give its\npower away to an entity that is not constrained by those\ncheckpoints. The Constitution\u2019s deliberative process was\nviewed by the Framers as a valuable feature, see, e.g.,\nManning, Lawmaking Made Easy, 10 Green Bag 2d 202\n(2007) (\u201c[B]icameralism and presentment make lawmak-\ning difficult by design\u201d (citing, inter alia, The Federalist\nNo. 62, p. 378 (J. Madison), and No. 63, at 443\u2013444 (A.\nHamilton))), not something to be lamented and evaded.\n   Of course, this Court has \u201c \u2018almost never felt qualified to\nsecond-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of\npolicy judgment that can be left to those executing or\napplying the law.\u2019 \u201d      Whitman v.

But the\ninherent difficulty of line-drawing is no excuse for not\nenforcing the Constitution. Rather, the formal reason why\nthe Court does not enforce the nondelegation doctrine with\nmore vigilance is that the other branches of Government\nhave vested powers of their own that can be used in ways\nthat resemble lawmaking. See, e.g., Arlington v. FCC, 569\nU. S. ___, ___\u2013___, n. 4 (2013) (slip op., at 13\u201314, n. 4)\n(explaining that agency rulemakings \u201care exercises of\u2014\nindeed, under our constitutional structure they must be\nexercises of\u2014the \u2018executive Power\u2019 \u201d (quoting Art. II, \u00a71,\ncl. 1)). Even so, \u201cthe citizen confronting thousands of\npages of regulations\u2014promulgated by an agency directed\nby Congress to regulate, say, \u2018in the public interest\u2019\u2014can\nperhaps be excused for thinking that it is the agency really\ndoing the legislating.\u201d 569 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4\u20135).\n   When it comes to private entities, however, there is not\neven a fig leaf of constitutional justification. Private\nentities are not vested with \u201clegislative Powers.\u201d Art. I,\n\u00a71. Nor are they vested with the \u201cexecutive Power,\u201d\nArt. II, \u00a71, cl. 1, which belongs to the President. Indeed, it\nraises \u201c[d]ifficult and fundamental questions\u201d about \u201cthe\ndelegation of Executive power\u201d when Congress authorizes\ncitizen suits. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envi-\nronmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 197 (2000)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). A citizen suit to enforce exist-\ning law, however, is nothing compared to delegated power\nto create new law. By any measure, handing off regu-\nlatory power to a private entity is \u201clegislative delegation\nin its most obnoxious form.\u201d Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298\nU. S. 238, 311 (1936).\n   For these reasons, it is hard to imagine how delegating\n\u201cbinding\u201d tie-breaking authority to a private arbitrator to\nresolve a dispute between Amtrak and the FRA could be\nconstitutional. No private arbitrator can promulgate\n8   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF \n\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\nbinding metrics and standards for the railroad industry.\nThus, if the term \u201carbitrator\u201d refers to a private arbitrator,\nor even the possibility of a private arbitrator, the Consti-\ntution is violated. See 721 F. 3d, at 674 (\u201c[T]hat the recip-\nients of illicitly delegated authority opted not to make use\nof it is no antidote. It is Congress\u2019s decision to delegate\nthat is unconstitutional\u201d (citing Whitman, supra, at 473)).\n   As I read the Government\u2019s briefing, it does not dispute\nany of this (other than my characterization of the PRIIA\nas regulatory, which it surely is). Rather than trying to\ndefend a private arbitrator, the Government argues that\nthe Court, for reasons of constitutional avoidance, should\nread the word \u201carbitrator\u201d to mean \u201cpublic arbitrator.\u201d\nThe Government\u2019s argument, however, lurches into a new\nproblem: Constitutional avoidance works only if the stat-\nute is susceptible to an alternative reading and that such\nan alternative reading would itself be constitutional.\n   Here, the Government\u2019s argument that the word \u201carbi-\ntrator\u201d does not mean \u201cprivate arbitrator\u201d is in some ten-\nsion with the ordinary meaning of the word. Although\nGovernment arbitrators are not unheard of, we usually\nthink of arbitration as a form of \u201cprivate dispute resolu-\ntion.\u201d See, e.g., Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l\nCorp., 559 U. S. 662, 685 (2010).\n   Likewise, the appointment of a public arbitrator here\nwould raise serious questions under the Appointments\nClause. Unless an \u201cinferior Office[r]\u201d is at issue, Article II\nof the Constitution demands that the President appoint all\n\u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d with the Senate\u2019s advice\nand consent. Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. This provision ensures that\nthose who exercise the power of the United States are\naccountable to the President, who himself is accountable\nto the people. See Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at\n497\u2013498 (citing The Federalist No. 72, p. 487 (J. Cooke ed.\n1961) (A. Hamilton)).

S. 651, 663 (1997)\n(\u201c[W]e think it evident that \u2018inferior officers\u2019 are officers\nwhose work is directed and supervised at some level by\nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate\u201d). While some\nofficers may be principal even if they have a supervisor, it\nis common ground that an officer without a supervisor\nmust be principal. See id., at 667 (Souter, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment).\n   Here, even under the Government\u2019s public-arbitrator\ntheory, it looks like the arbitrator would be making law\nwithout supervision\u2014again, it is \u201cbinding arbitration.\u201d\nNothing suggests that those words mean anything other\nthan what they say. This means that an arbitrator could\nset the metrics and standards that \u201cshall\u201d become part of a\nprivate railroad\u2019s contracts with Amtrak whenever \u201cprac-\nticable.\u201d As to that \u201cbinding\u201d decision, who is the supervi-\nsor? Inferior officers can do many things, but nothing\nfinal should appear in the Federal Register unless a Pres-\nidential appointee has at least signed off on it. See 75\nFed. Reg. 26839 (2010) (placing the metrics and standards\nin the Federal Register); Edmond, supra, at 665.\n                            IV\n  Finally, the Board of Amtrak, and, in particular,\nAmtrak\u2019s president, also poses difficult constitutional\nproblems. As the Court observes, \u201cAmtrak\u2019s Board of\nDirectors is composed of nine members, one of whom is the\nSecretary of Transportation. Seven other Board members\nare appointed by the President and confirmed by the\nSenate. These eight Board members, in turn, select\nAmtrak\u2019s president.\u201d Ante, at 7 (citation omitted). In\nother words, unlike everyone else on the Board, Amtrak\u2019s\n10 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                  ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\npresident has not been appointed by the President and\nconfirmed by the Senate.\n   As explained above, accountability demands that princi-\npal officers be appointed by the President. See Art. II, \u00a72,\ncl. 2. The President, after all, must have \u201cthe general\nadministrative control of those executing the laws,\u201d Myers\nv. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 164 (1926), and this princi-\nple applies with special force to those who can \u201cexercis[e]\nsignificant authority\u201d without direct supervision, Buckley,\nsupra, at 126; see also Edmond, supra, at 663. Unsurpris-\ningly then, the United States defends the non-Presidential\nappointment of Amtrak\u2019s president on the ground that the\nAmtrak president is merely an inferior officer. Given\nArticle II, for the Government to argue anything else\nwould be surrender.\n   This argument, however, is problematic. Granted, a\nmultimember body may head an agency. See Free Enter-\nprise Fund, supra, at 512\u2013513. But those who head agen-\ncies must be principal officers. See Edmond, supra, at\n663. It would seem to follow that because agency heads\nmust be principal officers, every member of a multimem-\nber body heading an agency must also be a principal of-\nficer. After all, every member of a multimember body\ncould cast the deciding vote with respect to a particular\ndecision. One would think that anyone who has the uni-\nlateral authority to tip a final decision one way or the\nother cannot be an inferior officer.\n   The Government\u2019s response is tucked away in a foot-\nnote. It contends that because Amtrak\u2019s president serves\nat the pleasure of the other Board members, he is only an\ninferior officer. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 14, n. 6.\nBut the Government does not argue that the president of\nAmtrak cannot cast tie-breaking votes. Assuming he can\nvote when the Board of Directors is divided, it makes no\nsense to think that the side with which the president\nagrees will demand his removal.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n   In any event, even assuming that Amtrak\u2019s president\ncould be an inferior officer, there would still be another\nproblem: Amtrak\u2019s Board may lack constitutional author-\nity to appoint inferior officers. The Appointments Clause\nprovides an exception from the ordinary rule of Presiden-\ntial appointment for \u201cinferior Officers,\u201d but that exception\nhas accountability limits of its own, namely, that Congress\nmay only vest the appointment power \u201cin the President\nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. Although a multimember body\nlike Amtrak\u2019s Board can head a Department, here it is not\nat all clear that Amtrak is a Department.\n   A \u201cDepartment\u201d may not be \u201csubordinate to or contained\nwithin any other such component\u201d of the Executive\nBranch. Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at 511. As\nexplained above, however, in jointly creating metrics and\nstandards, Amtrak may have to give way to an arbitrator\nappointed by the STB. Does that mean that Amtrak is\n\u201csubordinate to\u201d the STB? See also 49 U. S. C. \u00a724308\n(explaining the STB\u2019s role in disputes between Amtrak\nand rail carriers). At the same time, the Secretary of\nTransportation sits on Amtrak\u2019s Board and controls some\naspects of Amtrak\u2019s relationship with rail carriers. See,\ne.g., \u00a7\u00a724302(a)(1), 24309(d)(2). The Secretary of Trans-\nportation also has authority to exempt Amtrak from cer-\ntain statutory requirements. See \u00a724305(f)(4). Does that\nmean that Amtrak is \u201csubordinate to or contained within\u201d\nthe Department of Transportation? (The STB, of course,\nalso may be \u201csubordinate to or contained within\u201d the\nDepartment of Transportation. If so, this may further\nsuggest that that Amtrak is not a Department, and also\nfurther undermine the STB\u2019s ability to appoint an arbitra-\ntor). All of these are difficult questions.\n                    *     *    *\n  In sum, while I entirely agree with the Court that\n12 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v.

Those Clauses provide that\n\u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a\nCongress of the United States,\u201d Art. I, \u00a71, \u201c[t]he executive\nPower shall be vested in a President of the United States,\u201d\nArt. II, \u00a71, cl. 1, and \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the United\nStates, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such\ninferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time\nordain and establish,\u201d Art. III, \u00a71.\n   These grants are exclusive. See Whitman v. American\nTrucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 472 (2001) (legislative\npower); Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Account-\ning Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, 496\u2013497 (2010) (execu-\ntive power); Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___\n(2011) (slip op., at 16\u201317) (judicial power). When the\nGovernment is called upon to perform a function that\nrequires an exercise of legislative, executive, or judicial\npower, only the vested recipient of that power can per-\nform it.\n   In addition to allocating power among the different\nbranches, the Constitution identifies certain restrictions\non the manner in which those powers are to be exercised.\nArticle I requires, among other things, that \u201c[e]very Bill\nwhich shall have passed the House of Representatives and\nthe Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to\nthe President of the United States; If he approve he shall\nsign it, but if not he shall return it . . . .\u201d Art.

S. 602 (1935).\n   When the Court speaks of Congress improperly delegat-\ning power, what it means is Congress\u2019 authorizing an\nentity to exercise power in a manner inconsistent with the\nConstitution. For example, Congress improperly \u201cdele-\ngates\u201d legislative power when it authorizes an entity other\nthan itself to make a determination that requires an\nexercise of legislative power. See Whitman, supra, at 472.\nIt also improperly \u201cdelegates\u201d legislative power to itself\nwhen it authorizes itself to act without bicameralism and\npresentment. See, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919\n(1983). And Congress improperly \u201cdelegates\u201d\u2014or, more\nprecisely, authorizes the exercise of, see Perez v. Mortgage\nBankers Assn., post, at 22 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment) (noting that Congress may not \u201cdelegate\u201d power\nit does not possess)\u2014executive power when it authorizes\nindividuals or groups outside of the President\u2019s control to\nperform a function that requires the exercise of that power.\nSee, e.g., Free Enterprise Fund, supra.\n   In order to be able to adhere to the provisions of the\nConstitution that allocate and constrain the exercise of\nthese powers, we must first understand their boundaries.\nHere, I do not purport to offer a comprehensive description\nof these powers. My purpose is to identify principles\nrelevant to today\u2019s dispute, with an eye to offering guid-\nance to the lower courts on remand. At issue in this case\nis the proper division between legislative and executive\npowers. An examination of the history of those powers\nreveals how far our modern separation-of-powers juris-\nprudence has departed from the original meaning of the\nConstitution.\n                             II\n  The allocation of powers in the Constitution is absolute,\nPerez, post, at 5\u20138 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), but it does not\n4   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF \n\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n             THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\nfollow that there is no overlap between the three catego-\nries of governmental power. Certain functions may be\nperformed by two or more branches without either exceed-\ning its enumerated powers under the Constitution. Reso-\nlution of claims against the Government is the classic\nexample. At least when Congress waives its sovereign\nimmunity, such claims may be heard by an Article III\ncourt, which adjudicates such claims by an exercise of\njudicial power. See Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438,\n452 (1929). But Congress may also provide for an execu-\ntive agency to adjudicate such claims by an exercise of\nexecutive power. See ibid. Or Congress may resolve the\nclaims itself, legislating by special Act. See ibid. The\nquestion is whether the particular function requires the\nexercise of a certain type of power; if it does, then only the\nbranch in which that power is vested can perform it. For\nexample, although this Court has long recognized that it\ndoes not necessarily violate the Constitution for Congress\nto authorize another branch to make a determination that\nit could make itself, there are certain core functions that\nrequire the exercise of legislative power and that only\nCongress can perform. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1,\n43 (1825) (distinguishing between those functions Con-\ngress must perform itself and those it may leave to an-\nother branch).\n   The function at issue here is the formulation of gener-\nally applicable rules of private conduct. Under the original\nunderstanding of the Constitution, that function requires\nthe exercise of legislative power. By corollary, the discre-\ntion inherent in executive power does not comprehend the\ndiscretion to formulate generally applicable rules of pri-\nvate conduct.\n                            A\n  The idea that the Executive may not formulate generally\napplicable rules of private conduct emerged even before\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe theory of the separation of powers on which our Con-\nstitution was founded.\n   The idea has ancient roots in the concept of the \u201crule of\nlaw,\u201d which has been understood since Greek and Roman\ntimes to mean that a ruler must be subject to the law in\nexercising his power and may not govern by will alone. M.\nVile, Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers 25\n(2d ed. 1998); 2 Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus\nAngliae 33 (G. Woodbine ed., S. Thorne transl. 1968). The\nprinciple that a ruler must govern according to law \u201cpre-\nsupposes at least two distinct operations, the making of\nlaw, and putting it into effect.\u201d Vile, supra, at 24. Al-\nthough it was originally thought \u201cthat the rule of law was\nsatisfied if a king made good laws and always acted ac-\ncording to them,\u201d it became increasingly apparent over\ntime that the rule of law demanded that the operations of\n\u201cmaking\u201d law and of \u201cputting it into effect\u201d be kept sepa-\nrate. W. Gwyn, The Meaning of the Separation of Powers\n35 (1965); see also id., at 8\u20139. But when the King\u2019s power\nwas at its height, it was still accepted that his \u201cprincipal\nduty . . . [was], to govern his people according to law.\u201d 1\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 226\n(1765) (Commentaries) (emphasis added).\n   An early expression of this idea in England is seen in\nthe \u201cconstitutional\u201d law concerning crown proclamations.\nEven before a more formal separation of powers came\nabout during the English Civil War, it was generally\nthought that the King could not use his proclamation\npower to alter the rights and duties of his subjects. P.\nHamburger, Is Administrative Law Unlawful? 33\u201334\n(2014) (Hamburger). This power could be exercised by the\nKing only in conjunction with Parliament and was exer-\ncised through statutes. Ibid.; see also M. Hale, The Pre-\nrogatives of the King 141, 171\u2013172 (D. Yale ed. 1976). The\nKing might participate in \u201cthe legislative power\u201d by giving\nhis \u201cassent\u201d to laws created by the \u201cconcurrence\u201d of \u201clords\n6   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v.

Hamburger\n35\u201336. That Act declared that the King\u2019s proclamations\nwould have the force and effect of an Act of Parliament.\nId., at 37. But the Act did not permit the King to deprive\nhis subjects of their property, privileges and franchises, or\ntheir lives, except as provided by statutory or common law.\nId., at 37\u201338. Nor did the Act permit him to invalidate\n\u201c \u2018any acts, [or] common laws standing at [that] time in\nstrength and force.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 38 (quoting An Act that Proc-\nlamations Made by the King Shall be Obeyed, 31 Hen.\nVIII, ch. 8, in Eng. Stat. at Large 263 (1539)).\n    Even this limited delegation of lawmaking power to the\nKing was repudiated by Parliament less than a decade\nlater. Hamburger 38. Reflecting on this period in history,\nDavid Hume would observe that, when Parliament \u201cgave\nto the king\u2019s proclamation the same force as to a statute\nenacted by parliament,\u201d it \u201cmade by one act a total sub-\nversion of the English constitution.\u201d 3 D. Hume, The\nHistory of England from the Invasion of Julius Ceasar to\nthe Revolution in 1688, p. 266 (1983).

Rep. 1352, 1353 (K. B.\n1611). Coke associated this principle with Chapter 39 of\nthe Magna Carta,1 which he understood to guarantee that\nno subject would be deprived of a private right\u2014that is, a\nright of life, liberty, or property\u2014except in accordance\nwith \u201cthe law of the land,\u201d which consisted only of statu-\ntory and common law. Chapman & McConnell, Due Process\nas Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L. J. 1672, 1688 (2012).\nWhen the King attempted to fashion rules of private con-\nduct unilaterally, as he did in the Case of Proclamations,\nthe resulting enforcement action could not be said to\naccord with \u201cthe law of the land.\u201d\n   John Locke echoed this view. \u201c[F]reedom of men under\ngovernment,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis to have a standing rule to live\nby, common to every one of that society, and made by the\nlegislative power erected in it . . . and not to be subject to\nthe inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of\nanother man.\u201d J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Govern-\nment \u00a722, p. 13 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (Locke) (emphasis\nadded). It followed that this freedom required that the\npower to make the standing rules and the power to enforce\nthem not lie in the same hands. See id., \u00a7143, at 72. He\nfurther concluded that \u201c[t]he legislative c[ould not] trans-\nfer the power of making laws to any other hands: for it\nbeing but a delegated power from the people, they who\nhave it [could not] pass it over to others.\u201d Id., \u00a7141, at 71.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Chapter 39 of the 1215 Magna Carta declared that \u201c[n]o free man\n\nshall be taken, imprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any\nway destroyed, nor will We proceed against or prosecute him, except by\nthe lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.\u201d A. How-\nard, Magna Carta: Text and Commentary 43 (1964).\n  2 Locke and his contemporaries also believed that requiring laws to be\n\nmade in Parliament secured the common interest. W. Gwyn, The\nMeaning of the Separation of Powers 75 (1965). Parliament would\nassemble to do the business of legislation, but then its members would\ndisperse to live as private citizens under the laws they had created,\n8   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n             THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n  William Blackstone, in his Commentaries, likewise\nmaintained that the English Constitution required that no\nsubject be deprived of core private rights except in accord-\nance with the law of the land. See 1 Commentaries 129,\n134, 137\u2013138. He defined a \u201claw\u201d as a generally applicable\n\u201crule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a\nstate, commanding what is right and prohibiting what is\nwrong.\u201d Id., at 44 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAnd he defined a tyrannical government as one in which\n\u201cthe right both of making and of enforcing the laws, is\nvested in one and the same man, or one and the same body\nof men,\u201d for \u201cwherever these two powers are united to-\ngether, there can be no public liberty.\u201d Id., at 142. Thus,\nalthough Blackstone viewed Parliament as sovereign and\ncapable of changing the constitution, id., at 156, he\nthought a delegation of lawmaking power to be \u201cdis-\ngrace[ful],\u201d 4 id., at 424; see also Hamburger 39, n. 17.\n                             B\n   These principles about the relationship between private\nrights and governmental power profoundly influenced the\nmen who crafted, debated, and ratified the Constitution.\nThe document itself and the writings surrounding it re-\nflect a conviction that the power to make the law and the\npower to enforce it must be kept separate, particularly\nwith respect to the regulation of private conduct.\n   The Framers\u2019 dedication to the separation of powers has\nbeen well-documented, if only half-heartedly honored.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nproviding them an incentive to legislate in the common interest. \n\nDuring Parliament\u2019s absence, the King might meet certain emergencies \n\nthrough the exercise of prerogative power, but in order to make new, \n\npermanent laws, he would be required to call Parliament into session.\n\nLocke \u00a7\u00a7143\u2013144, at 72\u201373. If the King were not dependent on Parlia-\nment to legislate, then this beneficial cycle of periodic lawmaking \n\ninterspersed with representatives\u2019 living as private citizens would be\n\nbroken. \n\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n            THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\ncreasingly clear to me that the test we have applied to\ndistinguish legislative from executive power largely abdi-\ncates our duty to enforce that prohibition. Implicitly\nrecognizing that the power to fashion legally binding rules\nis legislative, we have nevertheless classified rulemaking\nas executive (or judicial) power when the authorizing\nstatute sets out \u201can intelligible principle\u201d to guide the\nrulemaker\u2019s discretion. Ibid. Although the Court may\nnever have intended the boundless standard the \u201cintelligi-\nble principle\u201d test has become, it is evident that it does not\nadequately reinforce the Constitution\u2019s allocation of legis-\nlative power. I would return to the original understanding\nof the federal legislative power and require that the Fed-\neral Government create generally applicable rules of\nprivate conduct only through the constitutionally pre-\nscribed legislative process.\n                                A\n    The Court first announced the intelligible principle test\nin J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S.\n394 (1928). That case involved a challenge to a tariff\nassessed on a shipment of barium dioxide. Id., at 400.\nThe rate of the tariff had been set by proclamation of the\nPresident, pursuant to the so-called flexible tariff provi-\nsion of the Tariff Act of 1922. Ibid. That provision author-\nized the President to increase or decrease a duty set by the\nstatute if he determined that the duty did not \u201c \u2018equalize\n. . . differences in costs of production [of the item to which\nthe duty applied] in the United States and the principal\ncompeting country.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 401 (quoting 19 U.

At the time J. W. Hampton was decided, most\n\u201cdelegations\u201d by Congress to the Executive, including the\ndelegation at issue in that case, had taken the form of\nconditional legislation. See Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark,\n143 U. S. 649, 683\u2013689 (1892). That form of legislation\n\u201cmakes the suspension of certain provisions and the going\ninto operation of other provisions of an Act of Congress\ndepend upon the action of the President based upon the\noccurrence of subsequent events, or the ascertainment by\nhim of certain facts, to be made known by his proclama-\ntion.\u201d Id., at 683.\n   The practice of conditional legislation dates back at\nleast to the Third Congress in 1794. Id., at 683\u2013689 (col-\nlecting statutes). It first came before the Court in Cargo of\nBrig Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch 382 (1813). There,\nthe Court considered whether a Presidential proclamation\ncould, by declaring that France had ceased to violate the\nneutral commerce of the United States, reinstate a legisla-\ntive Act embargoing British goods. Id., at 384, 388. The\nCourt concluded that the proclamation was effective,\nseeing \u201cno sufficient reaso[n] why the legislature should\nnot exercise its discretion . . . either expressly or condi-\ntionally, as their judgment should direct.\u201d Id., at 388.\n   At least as defined by the Court in Field, the practice of\nconditional legislation does not seem to call on the Presi-\ndent to exercise a core function that demands an exercise\nof legislative power. Congress creates the rule of private\nconduct, and the President makes the factual determina-\ntion that causes that rule to go into effect. That type of\nfactual determination seems similar to the type of factual\ndetermination on which an enforcement action is condi-\n14 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v.

See Union\nBridge Co. v. United States, 204 U.

For example, a 1794 provision\nentitled \u201cAn Act to authorize the President of the United\nStates to lay, regulate and revoke Embargoes,\u201d ch. 41, 1\nStat. 372, called on the President to impose an embargo on\nshipping \u201cwhenever, in his opinion, the public safety shall\nso require . . . .\u201d Ibid. The statutes at issue in Field and\nJ. W. Hampton could similarly be viewed as calling for\nbuilt-in policy judgments. See Schoenbrod, The Delega-\ntion Doctrine: Could The Court Give It Substance? 83\nMich. L. Rev. 1223, 1263\u20131264 (1985).4 Such delegations\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  statute at issue in Field authorized the President to reimpose\nstatutory duties on exports from a particular country if he found that\nthe country had imposed \u201creciprocally unequal and unreasonable\u201d\nduties on U. S. exports. 143 U. S., at 692. At least insofar as the terms\n\u201cunequal\u201d and \u201cunreasonable\u201d did not have settled common-law defini-\ntions that could be applied mechanically to the facts, they could be said\nto call for the President to exercise policy judgment about which duties\nqualified. See id., at 699 (Lamar, J., dissenting but concurring in\njudgment) (The statute \u201cdoes not, as was provided in the statutes of\n1809 and 1810, entrust the President with the ascertainment of a fact\ntherein defined upon which the law is to go into operation.

He may\ndo so expressly\u2014by setting out regulations specifying\nwhat conduct jeopardizes \u201cthe public safety,\u201d for exam-\nple\u2014or implicitly\u2014by drawing distinctions on an ad hoc\nbasis. In either event, he does so based on a policy judg-\nment that is not reviewable by the courts, at least to the\nextent that the judgment falls within the range of discre-\ntion permitted him by the law. See id., at 1255\u20131260.\n   The existence of these statutes should not be taken to\nsuggest that the Constitution, as originally understood,\nwould permit such delegations. The 1794 embargo statute\ninvolved the external relations of the United States, so the\ndetermination it authorized the President to make argua-\nbly did not involve an exercise of core legislative power.\nSee id., at 1260\u20131263 (distinguishing the tariff statute at\nissue in Field and J. W. Hampton on these grounds).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nble. . . \u2019 \u201d). Similarly, the statute at issue in J. W. Hampton called on\nthe President, with the aid of a commission, to determine the \u201c \u2018costs of\nproduction\u2019 \u201d for various goods\u2014a calculation that could entail an\nexercise of policy judgment about the appropriate wage and profit rates\nin the relevant industries. 276 U. S., at 401.\n   5 The definition of \u201claw\u201d in England at the time of the ratification did\n\nnot necessarily include rules\u2014even rules of private conduct\u2014dealing\nwith external relations. For example, while \u201cevery Englishman [could]\nclaim a right to abide in his own country so long as he pleases; and not\nto be driven from it unless by the sentence of the law,\u201d the King \u201cby his\nroyal prerogative, [could] issue out his writ ne exeat regnum, and\nprohibit any of his subjects from going into foreign parts without\nlicence.\u201d 1 Commentaries 133. It is thus likely the Constitution grants\nthe President a greater measure of discretion in the realm of foreign\nrelations, and the conditional tariff Acts must be understood accord-\ningly. See Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 445 (1998) (distin-\nguishing Field on the ground that the statute at issue in Field regulated\nforeign trade); see also United States v.

ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n            THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nMoreover, the statute was never subjected to constitutional\nscrutiny. And when a statute of its kind\u2014that is, a\ntariff statute calling for an exercise of policy judgment\u2014\nfinally came before this Court for consideration in Field,\nthe Court appeared to understand the statute as calling\nfor no more than a factual determination. 143 U. S., at\n693. The Court thus did not in that case endorse the\nprinciple that the Executive may fashion generally appli-\ncable rules of private conduct and appears not to have\ndone so until the 20th century.\n   More to the point, J. W. Hampton can be read to adhere\nto the \u201cfactual determination\u201d rationale from Field. The\nCourt concluded its delegation analysis in J. W. Hampton\nnot with the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d language, but by citing\nto Field for the proposition that the \u201cAct did not in any\nreal sense invest the President with the power of legisla-\ntion, because nothing involving the expediency or just\noperation of such legislation was left to the determination\nof the President.\u201d 276 U.

Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall\nsurveyed a number of choices that could be left to rule-\nmaking by the courts, explaining that they concerned only\n\u201cthe regulation of the conduct of the officer of the Court in\ngiving effect to its judgments.\u201d Id., at 45. When it came to\nspecifying \u201cthe mode of obeying the mandate of a writ,\u201d\nhowever, he lamented that \u201cso much of that which may be\ndone by the judiciary, under the authority of the legisla-\nture, seems to be blended with that for which the legisla-\nture must expressly and directly provide.\u201d Id., at 46.\n   This important passage reflects two premises that Chief\nJustice Marshall took for granted, but which are disre-\ngarded in later decisions relying on this precedent: First,\nreflected in his discussion of \u201cblending\u201d permissible with\nimpermissible discretion, is the premise that it is not the\nquantity, but the quality, of the discretion that determines\nwhether an authorization is constitutional. Second, re-\nflected in the contrast Chief Justice Marshall draws be-\ntween the two types of rules, is the premise that the rules\n\u201cfor which the legislature must expressly and directly\nprovide\u201d are those regulating private conduct rather than\nthose regulating the conduct of court officers.\n   Thus, when Chief Justice Marshall spoke about the\n\u201cdifficulty in discerning the exact limits within which the\nlegislature may avail itself of the agency of its Courts,\u201d\nibid., he did not refer to the difficulty in discerning whether\nthe Legislature\u2019s policy guidance is \u201csufficiently de-\nfined,\u201d see Panama Refining, supra, at 429, but instead\nthe difficulty in discerning which rules affected substan-\ntive private rights and duties and which did not. We\ncontinue to wrestle with this same distinction today in our\ndecisions distinguishing between substantive and proce-\ndural rules both in diversity cases and under the Rules\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

S. 393, 406\u2013407\n(2010) (\u201cIn the Rules Enabling Act, Congress authorized\nthis Court to promulgate rules of procedure subject to its\nreview, 28 U. S.

To the extent that the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d\ntest was ever an adequate means of enforcing that distinc-\ntion, it has been decoupled from the historical understand-\ning of the legislative and executive powers and thus does\nnot keep executive \u201clawmaking\u201d within the bounds of\ninherent executive discretion. See Whitman, 531 U. S., at\n487 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (\u201cI am not convinced that the\nintelligible principle doctrine serves to prevent all cessions\nof legislative power\u201d). Perhaps we were led astray by the\noptical illusion caused by different branches carrying out\nthe same functions, believing that the separation of pow-\ners would be substantially honored so long as the en-\ncroachment were not too great. See, e.g., Loving v. United\nStates, 517 U.

Jackson v. Roby, 109 U. S. 440, 441 (1883); see also United\nStates v. Grimaud, 220 U. S. 506 (1911) (sustaining an Act authorizing\nthe Secretary of Agriculture to make rules and regulations governing\nthe use and occupancy of public forest reservations). Although perhaps\nquestionable on its own terms, Jackson is distinguishable because it did\nnot involve the Government\u2019s reaching out to regulate private conduct,\nbut instead involved the Government\u2019s setting rules by which individ-\nuals might enter onto public land to avail themselves of resources\nbelonging to the Government.\n20 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v.

Or perhaps we deliberately departed\nfrom the separation, bowing to the exigencies of modern\nGovernment that were so often cited in cases upholding\nchallenged delegations of rulemaking authority.8 See, e.g.,\nMistretta, 488 U. S., at 372 (\u201c[O]ur jurisprudence has been\ndriven by a practical understanding that in our increas-\ningly complex society, replete with ever changing and\nmore technical problems, Congress simply cannot do its\njob absent an ability to delegate power under broad gen-\neral directives\u201d).\n   For whatever reason, the intelligible principle test now\nrequires nothing more than a minimal degree of specificity\nin the instructions Congress gives to the Executive when it\nauthorizes the Executive to make rules having the force\nand effect of law. And because the Court has \u201c \u2018almost\nnever felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding\nthe permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left\nto those executing or applying the law,\u2019 \u201d Whitman, supra,\nat 474\u2013475 (majority opinion) (quoting Mistretta, supra, at\n416 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)), the level of specificity it has\nrequired has been very minimal indeed, see 531 U. S., at\n474 (collecting cases upholding delegations to regulate in\nthe \u201cpublic interest\u201d). Under the guise of the intelligible-\nprinciple test, the Court has allowed the Executive to go\nbeyond the safe realm of factual investigation to make\npolitical judgments about what is \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cunneces-\nsary.\u201d See, e.g., American Power & Light Co. v.

I accept that this would inhibit the\nGovernment from acting with the speed and efficiency\nCongress has sometimes found desirable. In anticipating\nthat result and accepting it, I am in good company. John\nLocke, for example, acknowledged that a legislative body\n\u201cis usually too numerous, and so too slow for the dispatch\nrequisite to execution.\u201d Locke \u00a7160, at 80. But he saw\nthat as a benefit for legislation, for he believed that the\ncreation of rules of private conduct should be an irregular\nand infrequent occurrence. See id., \u00a7143, at 72. The\nFramers, it appears, were inclined to agree. As Alexander\nHamilton explained in another context, \u201cIt may perhaps\nbe said that the power of preventing bad laws includes\nthat of preventing good ones . . . . But this objection will\nhave little weight with those who can properly estimate\nthe mischiefs of that inconstancy and mutability in the\nlaws, which form the greatest blemish in the character\nand genius of our governments.\u201d The Federalist No. 73, at\n443\u2013444.

Because it also concluded that\nCongress delegated regulatory power to Amtrak, id., at\n670\u2013674, and because this Court has held that delegations\nof regulatory power to private parties are impermissible,\nCarter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 311 (1936), it held\nthe delegation to be unconstitutional, 721 F. 3d, at 677.\n   Although no provision of the Constitution expressly\nforbids the exercise of governmental power by a private\nentity, our so-called \u201cprivate nondelegation doctrine\u201d flows\nlogically from the three Vesting Clauses. Because a pri-\nvate entity is neither Congress, nor the President or one of\nhis agents, nor the Supreme Court or an inferior court\nestablished by Congress, the Vesting Clauses would cate-\ngorically preclude it from exercising the legislative, execu-\ntive, or judicial powers of the Federal Government. In\nshort, the \u201cprivate nondelegation doctrine\u201d is merely one\napplication of the provisions of the Constitution that\nforbid Congress to allocate power to an ineligible entity,\nwhether governmental or private.\n   For this reason, a conclusion that Amtrak is private\u2014\nthat is, not part of the Government at all\u2014would neces-\nsarily mean that it cannot exercise these three categories\nof governmental power. But the converse is not true: A\ndetermination that Amtrak acts as a governmental entity\nin crafting the metrics and standards says nothing about\nwhether it properly exercises governmental power when it\ndoes so.

To\nits credit, the majority does not hold otherwise. It merely\nrefutes the Court of Appeals\u2019 premise that Amtrak is\nprivate. But this answer could be read to suggest, wrongly,\nthat our conclusion about Amtrak\u2019s status has some con-\nstitutional significance for \u201cdelegation\u201d purposes.\n                             B\n  The first step in the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis on re-\nmand should be to classify the power that \u00a7207 purports to\nauthorize Amtrak to exercise. The second step should be\nto determine whether the Constitution\u2019s requirements for\nthe exercise of that power have been satisfied.\n                             1\n   Under the original understanding of the legislative and\nexecutive power, Amtrak\u2019s role in the creation of metrics\nand standards requires an exercise of legislative power\nbecause it allows Amtrak to decide the applicability of\nstandards that provide content to generally applicable\nrules of private conduct.\n   Specifically, the metrics and standards alter the rail-\nroads\u2019 common-carrier obligations under 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a711101. Host railroads may enter into contracts with\nAmtrak under \u00a7\u00a710908 and 24308 to fulfill their common-\ncarrier obligations. The metrics and standards shape the\ntypes of contracts that satisfy the common-carrier obliga-\ntions because \u00a7207 provides that \u201cAmtrak and its host rail\ncarriers shall\u201d include the metrics and standards in their\ncontracts \u201c[t]o the extent practicable.\u201d PRIIA \u00a7207(c), 49\nU.S.C. \u00a724101 (note) (emphasis added).

See ante, at 3\u20134\n(concurring opinion). And that duty is backed up by the\nSurface Transportation Board\u2019s coercive power to impose\n\u201creasonable terms\u201d on host railroads when they fail to\ncome to an agreement with Amtrak. \u00a724308(a)(2)(A)(ii).\nPresumably, when it is \u201cpracticable\u201d to incorporate the\nmetrics and standards, the Board is better positioned to\ndeem such terms \u201creasonable\u201d and to force them upon the\nrailroads.\n   Although the Government\u2019s argument to the contrary\nwill presumably change now that the Court has held that\nAmtrak is a governmental entity, it argued before this\nCourt that Amtrak did not exercise meaningful power\nbecause other \u201cgovernmental entities had sufficient con-\ntrol over the development and adoption of the metrics and\nstandards.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 19\u201326. For support, the\nGovernment relied on two questionable precedents in\nwhich this Court held that Congress may grant private\nactors the power to determine whether a government\nregulation will go into effect: Currin v. Wallace, 306 U. S.\n1 (1939), and United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative,\nInc., 307 U. S. 533 (1939). Those precedents reason that it\ndoes not require an exercise of legislative power to decide\nwhether and when legally binding rules of private conduct\nwill go into effect. Currin, supra, at 16\u201318; Rock Royal,\nsupra, at 574\u2013577. But as I have explained above, to the\nextent that this decision involves an exercise of policy\ndiscretion, it requires an exercise of legislative power.\nSupra, at 21\u201322. In any event, these precedents are di-\nrectly contrary to our more recent holding that a discre-\ntionary \u201cveto\u201d necessarily involves an exercise of legisla-\ntive power. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S., at 952\u2013953; see\nalso id., at 987 (White, J., dissenting) (noting that the\n26 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n            THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\npower Congress reserved to itself was virtually identical to\nthe power it conferred on private parties in Currin and\nRock Royal). As such, Currin and Rock Royal have been\ndiscredited and lack any force as precedents.\n   Section 207 therefore violates the Constitution. Article\nI, \u00a71, vests the legislative power in Congress, and Amtrak\nis not Congress. The procedures that \u00a7207 sets forth for\nenacting the metrics and standards also do not comply\nwith bicameralism and presentment. Art. I, \u00a77. For these\nreasons, the metrics and standards promulgated under\nthis provision are invalid.\n                              2\n   I recognize, of course, that the courts below will be\nbound to apply our \u201cintelligible principle\u201d test. I recog-\nnize, too, that that test means so little that the courts are\nlikely to conclude that \u00a7207 calls for nothing more than\nthe exercise of executive power. Having made that deter-\nmination, the Court of Appeals must then determine\nwhether Amtrak is constitutionally eligible to exercise\nexecutive power.\n   As noted, Article II of the Constitution vests the execu-\ntive power in a \u201cPresident of the United States of Amer-\nica.\u201d Art. II, \u00a71. Amtrak, of course, is not the President of\nthe United States, but this fact does not immediately\ndisqualify it from the exercise of executive power. Con-\ngress may authorize subordinates of the President to\nexercise such power, so long as they remain subject to\nPresidential control.\n   The critical question, then, is whether Amtrak is ade-\nquately subject to Presidential control. See Myers, 272\nU. S., at 117. Our precedents treat appointment and\nremoval powers as the primary devices of executive con-\ntrol, Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at 492, and that\nshould be the starting point of the Court of Appeals\u2019 anal-\nysis.   As JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concurrence demonstrates,\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

This arrangement raises serious con-\nstitutional questions to which the majority\u2019s holding that\nAmtrak is a governmental entity is all but a non sequitur.\nThese concerns merit close consideration by the courts\nbelow and by this Court if the case reaches us again.

Argued December 8, 2014\u2014Decided March 9, 2015\nIn 1970, Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation\n  (Amtrak). Congress has given Amtrak priority to use track systems\n  owned by the freight railroads for passenger rail travel, at rates\n  agreed to by the parties or, in case of a dispute, set by the Surface\n  Transportation Board. And in 2008, Congress gave Amtrak and the\n  Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) joint authority to issue \u201cmet-\n  rics and standards\u201d addressing the performance and scheduling of\n  passenger railroad services, see \u00a7207(a), 122 Stat. 4907, including\n  Amtrak\u2019s on-time performance and train delays caused by host rail-\n  roads.

The political branches also\n    exercise substantial, statutorily mandated supervision over Amtrak\u2019s\n    priorities and operations. See, e.g., \u00a724315. Also of significance,\n    Amtrak is required by statute to pursue broad public objectives, see,\n    e.g., \u00a7\u00a724101(b), 24307(a); certain aspects of Amtrak\u2019s day-to-day op-\n    erations are mandated by Congress, see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a724101(c)(6), 24902(b);\n    and Amtrak has been dependent on federal financial support during\n    every year of its existence. Given the combination of these unique\n    features and Amtrak\u2019s significant ties to the Government, Amtrak is\n    not an autonomous private enterprise. Amtrak was created by the\n    Government, is controlled by the Government, and operates for the\n    Government\u2019s benefit. Thus, in jointly issuing the metrics and\n    standards with the FRA, Amtrak acted as a governmental entity for\n    separation of powers purposes. And that exercise of governmental\n    power must be consistent with the Constitution, including those pro-\n    visions relating to the separation of powers. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (b) Respondent\u2019s reliance on congressional statements about\n    Amtrak\u2019s status is misplaced. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger\n    Corp., 513 U.

Treating Amtrak as\n    governmental for these purposes, moreover, is not an unbridled grant\n    of authority to an unaccountable actor, for the political branches cre-\n    ated Amtrak, control its Board, define its mission, specify many of its\n    day-to-day operations, have imposed substantial transparency and\n    accountability mechanisms, and, for all practical purposes, set and\n    supervise its annual budget.

ASSOCIATION OF\n\n            AMERICAN RAILROADS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 9, 2015] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 1970, Congress created the National Railroad Pas\u00ad\nsenger Corporation, most often known as Amtrak. Later,\nCongress granted Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Ad\u00ad\nministration (FRA) joint authority to issue \u201cmetrics and\nstandards\u201d that address the performance and scheduling\nof passenger railroad services. Alleging that the metrics\nand standards have substantial and adverse effects upon\nits members\u2019 freight services, respondent\u2014the Association\nof American Railroads\u2014filed this suit to challenge their\nvalidity. The defendants below, petitioners here, are the\nDepartment of Transportation, the FRA, and two individ\u00ad\nuals sued in their official capacity.\n   Respondent alleges the metrics and standards must be\ninvalidated on the ground that Amtrak is a private entity\nand it was therefore unconstitutional for Congress to allow\nand direct it to exercise joint authority in their issuance.\nThis argument rests on the Fifth Amendment Due Process\nClause and the constitutional provisions regarding separa\u00ad\ntion of powers. The District Court rejected both of re\u00ad\n2   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nspondent\u2019s claims. The Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit reversed, finding that, for purposes of\nthis dispute, Amtrak is a private entity and that Congress\nviolated nondelegation principles in its grant of joint\nauthority to Amtrak and the FRA. On that premise the\nCourt of Appeals invalidated the metrics and standards.\n  Having granted the petition for writ of certiorari, 573\nU. S. ___ (2014), this Court now holds that, for purposes of\ndetermining the validity of the metrics and standards,\nAmtrak is a governmental entity. Although Amtrak\u2019s\nactions here were governmental, substantial questions\nrespecting the lawfulness of the metrics and standards\u2014\nincluding questions implicating the Constitution\u2019s struc\u00ad\ntural separation of powers and the Appointments Clause,\nU. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2\u2014may still remain in the case.\nAs those matters have not yet been passed upon by the\nCourt of Appeals, this case is remanded.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Amtrak is a corporation established and authorized by a\ndetailed federal statute enacted by Congress for no less a\npurpose than to preserve passenger services and routes on\nour Nation\u2019s railroads. See Lebron v. National Railroad\nPassenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 383\u2013384 (1995);\nNational Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchison, T. &\nS. F. R. Co., 470 U. S. 451, 453\u2013457 (1985); see also Rail\nPassenger Service Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1328. Congress\nrecognized that Amtrak, of necessity, must rely for most of\nits operations on track systems owned by the freight rail\u00ad\nroads. So, as a condition of relief from their common-\ncarrier duties, Congress required freight railroads to allow\nAmtrak to use their tracks and facilities at rates agreed to\nby the parties\u2014or in the event of disagreement to be set\nby the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). See 45\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7561, 562 (1970 ed.). The Surface Transporta\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion Board (STB) now occupies the dispute-resolution role\noriginally assigned to the ICC. See 49 U. S. C. \u00a724308(a)\n(2012 ed.). Since 1973, Amtrak has received a statutory\npreference over freight transportation in using rail lines,\njunctions, and crossings. See \u00a724308(c).\n   The metrics and standards at issue here are the result\nof a further and more recent enactment. Concerned by\npoor service, unreliability, and delays resulting from\nfreight traffic congestion, Congress passed the Passenger\nRail Investment and Improvement Act (PRIIA) in 2008.\nSee 122 Stat. 4907. Section 207(a) of the PRIIA provides\nfor the creation of the metrics and standards:\n      \u201cWithin 180 days after the date of enactment of this\n    Act, the Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak\n    shall jointly, in consultation with the Surface Trans\u00ad\n    portation Board, rail carriers over whose rail lines\n    Amtrak trains operate, States, Amtrak employees,\n    nonprofit employee organizations representing\n    Amtrak employees, and groups representing Amtrak\n    passengers, as appropriate, develop new or improve\n    existing metrics and minimum standards for measur\u00ad\n    ing the performance and service quality of intercity\n    passenger train operations, including cost recovery,\n    on-time performance and minutes of delay, ridership,\n    on-board services, stations, facilities, equipment, and\n    other services.\u201d Id., at 4916.\nSection 207(d) of the PRIIA further provides:\n       \u201cIf the development of the metrics and standards is\n    not completed within the 180-day period required by\n    subsection (a), any party involved in the development\n    of those standards may petition the Surface Transpor\u00ad\n    tation Board to appoint an arbitrator to assist the\n    parties in resolving their disputes through binding\n    arbitration.\u201d Id., at 4917.\n4   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   The PRIIA specifies that the metrics and standards\ncreated under \u00a7207(a) are to be used for a variety of pur\u00ad\nposes. Section 207(b) requires the FRA to \u201cpublish a\nquarterly report on the performance and service quality of\nintercity passenger train operations\u201d addressing the spe\u00ad\ncific elements to be measured by the metrics and stand\u00ad\nards. Id., at 4916\u20134917. Section 207(c) provides that, \u201c[t]o\nthe extent practicable, Amtrak and its host rail carriers\nshall incorporate the metrics and standards developed\nunder subsection (a) into their access and service agree\u00ad\nments.\u201d Id., at 4917. And \u00a7222(a) obliges Amtrak, within\none year after the metrics and standards are established,\nto \u201cdevelop and implement a plan to improve on-board\nservice pursuant to the metrics and standards for such\nservice developed under [\u00a7207(a)].\u201d Id., at 4932.\n   Under \u00a7213(a) of the PRIIA, the metrics and standards\nalso may play a role in prompting investigations by the\nSTB and in subsequent enforcement actions. For instance,\n\u201c[i]f the on-time performance of any intercity passenger\ntrain averages less than 80 percent for any 2 consecutive\ncalendar quarters,\u201d the STB may initiate an investigation\n\u201cto determine whether and to what extent delays . . . are\ndue to causes that could reasonably be addressed . . . by\nAmtrak or other intercity passenger rail operators.\u201d Id.,\nat 4925\u20134926. While conducting an investigation under\n\u00a7213(a), the STB \u201chas authority to review the accuracy of\nthe train performance data and the extent to which sched\u00ad\nuling and congestion contribute to delays\u201d and shall \u201cob\u00ad\ntain information from all parties involved and identify\nreasonable measures and make recommendations to im\u00ad\nprove the service, quality, and on-time performance of the\ntrain.\u201d Id., at 4926. Following an investigation, the STB\nmay award damages if it \u201cdetermines that delays or fail\u00ad\nures to achieve minimum standards . . . are attributable to\na rail carrier\u2019s failure to provide preference to Amtrak over\nfreight transportation.\u201d Ibid.

App. 75\u201376. The\nfinal version of the metrics and standards was issued\njointly by Amtrak and the FRA in May 2010. Id., at 129\u2013\n144. The metrics and standards address, among other\nmatters, Amtrak\u2019s financial performance, its scores on\nconsumer satisfaction surveys, and the percentage of\npassenger-trips to and from underserved communities.\n   Of most importance for this case, the metrics and stand\u00ad\nards also address Amtrak\u2019s on-time performance and train\ndelays caused by host railroads. The standards associated\nwith the on-time performance metrics require on-time\nperformance by Amtrak trains at least 80% to 95% of the\ntime for each route, depending on the route and year. Id.,\nat 133\u2013135. With respect to \u201chost-responsible delays\u201d\u2014\nthat is to say, delays attributed to the railroads along\nwhich Amtrak trains travel\u2014the metrics and standards\nprovide that \u201c[d]elays must not be more than 900 minutes\nper 10,000 Train-Miles.\u201d Id., at 138. Amtrak conductors\ndetermine responsibility for particular delays. Ibid., n. 23.\n    In the District Court for the District of Columbia, re\u00ad\nspondent alleged injury to its members from being re\u00ad\nquired to modify their rail operations, which mostly in\u00ad\nvolve freight traffic, to satisfy the metrics and standards.\nRespondent claimed that \u00a7207 \u201cviolates the nondelegation\ndoctrine and the separation of powers principle by placing\nlegislative and rulemaking authority in the hands of a\nprivate entity [Amtrak] that participates in the very in\u00ad\ndustry it is supposed to regulate.\u201d Id., at 176\u2013177, Com\u00ad\nplaint \u00b651. Respondent also asserted that \u00a7207 violates\n6   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause by \u201c[v]esting\nthe coercive power of the government\u201d in Amtrak, an\n\u201cinterested private part[y].\u201d Id., at 177, \u00b6\u00b653\u201354. In its\nprayer for relief respondent sought, among other reme\u00ad\ndies, a declaration of \u00a7207\u2019s unconstitutionality and inval\u00ad\nidation of the metrics and standards. Id., at 177.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment to peti\u00ad\ntioners on both claims. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (DC 2012).\nWithout deciding whether Amtrak must be deemed pri\u00ad\nvate or governmental, it rejected respondent\u2019s nondelega\u00ad\ntion argument on the ground that the FRA, the STB, and\nthe political branches exercised sufficient control over\npromulgation and enforcement of the metrics and stand\u00ad\nards so that \u00a7207 is constitutional. See id., at 35.\n   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir\u00ad\ncuit reversed the judgment of the District Court as to the\nnondelegation and separation of powers claim, reasoning\nin central part that because \u201cAmtrak is a private corpora\u00ad\ntion with respect to Congress\u2019s power to delegate . . . au\u00ad\nthority,\u201d it cannot constitutionally be granted the \u201cregula\u00ad\ntory power prescribed in \u00a7207.\u201d 721 F. 3d 666, 677 (2013).\nThe Court of Appeals did not reach respondent\u2019s due\nprocess claim. See ibid.\n                               II\n  In holding that Congress may not delegate to Amtrak\nthe joint authority to issue the metrics and standards\u2014\nauthority it described as \u201cregulatory power,\u201d ibid.\u2014the\nCourt of Appeals concluded Amtrak is a private entity for\npurposes of determining its status when considering the\nconstitutionality of its actions in the instant dispute. That\ncourt\u2019s analysis treated as controlling Congress\u2019 statutory\ncommand that Amtrak \u201c \u2018is not a department, agency, or\ninstrumentality of the United States Government.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 675 (quoting 49 U. S. C. \u00a724301(a)(3)). The Court of\nAppeals also relied on Congress\u2019 pronouncement that\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAmtrak \u201c \u2018shall be operated and managed as a for-profit\ncorporation.\u2019 \u201d 721 F. 3d, at 675 (quoting \u00a724301(a)(2)); see\nalso id., at 677 (\u201cThough the federal government\u2019s in\u00ad\nvolvement in Amtrak is considerable, Congress has both\ndesignated it a private corporation and instructed that it\nbe managed so as to maximize profit.            In deciding\nAmtrak\u2019s status for purposes of congressional delegations,\nthese declarations are dispositive\u201d). Proceeding from this\npremise, the Court of Appeals concluded it was impermis\u00ad\nsible for Congress to \u201cdelegate regulatory authority to a\nprivate entity.\u201d Id., at 670; see also ibid. (holding Carter\nv. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238 (1936), prohibits any\nsuch delegation of authority).\n   That premise, however, was erroneous. Congressional\npronouncements, though instructive as to matters within\nCongress\u2019 authority to address, see, e.g., United States\nex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp., 380 F. 3d 488, 491\u2013492\n(CADC 2004) (Roberts, J.), are not dispositive of Amtrak\u2019s\nstatus as a governmental entity for purposes of separation\nof powers analysis under the Constitution. And an inde\u00ad\npendent inquiry into Amtrak\u2019s status under the Constitu\u00ad\ntion reveals the Court of Appeals\u2019 premise was flawed.\n   It is appropriate to begin the analysis with Amtrak\u2019s\nownership and corporate structure. The Secretary of\nTransportation holds all of Amtrak\u2019s preferred stock and\nmost of its common stock. Amtrak\u2019s Board of Directors is\ncomposed of nine members, one of whom is the Secretary\nof Transportation.      Seven other Board members are\nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n49 U. S. C. \u00a724302(a)(1). These eight Board members,\nin turn, select Amtrak\u2019s president.         \u00a724302(a)(1)(B);\n\u00a724303(a). Amtrak\u2019s Board members are subject to salary\nlimits set by Congress, \u00a724303(b); and the Executive\nBranch has concluded that all appointed Board members\nare removable by the President without cause, see 27 Op.\nAtty. Gen. 163 (2003).\n8   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF \n\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  Under further statutory provisions, Amtrak\u2019s Board\nmembers must possess certain qualifications. Congress\nhas directed that the President make appointments based\non an individual\u2019s prior experience in the transportation\nindustry, \u00a724302(a)(1)(C), and has provided that not more\nthan five of the seven appointed Board members be from\nthe same political party, \u00a724302(a)(3).        In selecting\nAmtrak\u2019s Board members, moreover, the President must\nconsult with leaders of both parties in both Houses of\nCongress in order to \u201cprovide adequate and balanced\nrepresentation of the major geographic regions of the\nUnited States served by Amtrak.\u201d \u00a724302(a)(2).\n  In addition to controlling Amtrak\u2019s stock and Board of\nDirectors the political branches exercise substantial,\nstatutorily mandated supervision over Amtrak\u2019s priorities\nand operations. Amtrak must submit numerous annual\nreports to Congress and the President, detailing such\ninformation as route-specific ridership and on-time per\u00ad\nformance. \u00a724315. The Freedom of Information Act ap\u00ad\nplies to Amtrak in any year in which it receives a federal\nsubsidy, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552, which thus far has been every\nyear of its existence. Pursuant to its status under the\nInspector General Act of 1978 as a \u201c \u2018designated Federal\nentity,\u2019 \u201d 5 U. S. C. App. \u00a78G(a)(2), p. 521, Amtrak must\nmaintain an inspector general, much like governmental\nagencies such as the Federal Communications Commis\u00ad\nsion and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Fur\u00ad\nthermore, Congress conducts frequent oversight hearings\ninto Amtrak\u2019s budget, routes, and prices. See, e.g., Hear\u00ad\ning on Reviewing Alternatives to Amtrak\u2019s Annual Losses\nin Food and Beverage Service before the Subcommittee on\nGovernment Operations of the House Committee on Over\u00ad\nsight and Government Reform, 113th Cong., 1st Sess., 5\n(2013) (statement of Thomas J. Hall, chief of customer\nservice, Amtrak); Hearing on Amtrak\u2019s Fiscal Year 2014\nBudget: The Starting Point for Reauthorization before the\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Boardman, president and chief execu\u00ad\ntive officer, Amtrak).\n   It is significant that, rather than advancing its own\nprivate economic interests, Amtrak is required to pursue\nnumerous, additional goals defined by statute. To take a\nfew examples: Amtrak must \u201cprovide efficient and effec\u00ad\ntive intercity passenger rail mobility,\u201d 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a724101(b); \u201cminimize Government subsidies,\u201d \u00a724101(d);\nprovide reduced fares to the disabled and elderly,\n\u00a724307(a); and ensure mobility in times of national disas\u00ad\nter, \u00a724101(c)(9).\n   In addition to directing Amtrak to serve these broad\npublic objectives, Congress has mandated certain aspects\nof Amtrak\u2019s day-to-day operations. Amtrak must main\u00ad\ntain a route between Louisiana and Florida. \u00a724101(c)(6).\nWhen making improvements to the Northeast corridor,\nAmtrak must apply seven considerations in a specified\norder of priority. \u00a724902(b). And when Amtrak purchases\nmaterials worth more than $1 million, these materials\nmust be mined or produced in the United States, or manu\u00ad\nfactured substantially from components that are mined,\nproduced, or manufactured in the United States, unless\nthe Secretary of Transportation grants an exemption.\n\u00a724305(f).\n   Finally, Amtrak is also dependent on federal financial\nsupport. In its first 43 years of operation, Amtrak has\nreceived more than $41 billion in federal subsidies. In\nrecent years these subsidies have exceeded $1 billion\nannually. See Brief for Petitioners 5, and n. 2, 46.\n   Given the combination of these unique features and its\nsignificant ties to the Government, Amtrak is not an\nautonomous private enterprise. Among other important\nconsiderations, its priorities, operations, and decisions are\n10 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nextensively supervised and substantially funded by the\npolitical branches. A majority of its Board is appointed by\nthe President and confirmed by the Senate and is under\u00ad\nstood by the Executive to be removable by the President at\nwill. Amtrak was created by the Government, is con\u00ad\ntrolled by the Government, and operates for the Govern\u00ad\nment\u2019s benefit. Thus, in its joint issuance of the metrics\nand standards with the FRA, Amtrak acted as a govern\u00ad\nmental entity for purposes of the Constitution\u2019s separation\nof powers provisions. And that exercise of governmental\npower must be consistent with the design and require\u00ad\nments of the Constitution, including those provisions\nrelating to the separation of powers.\n  Respondent urges that Amtrak cannot be deemed a\ngovernmental entity in this respect. Like the Court of\nAppeals, it relies principally on the statutory directives\nthat Amtrak \u201cshall be operated and managed as a for\nprofit corporation\u201d and \u201cis not a department, agency, or\ninstrumentality of the United States Government.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a724301(a)(2)\u2013(3). In light of that statutory language,\nrespondent asserts, Amtrak cannot exercise the joint\nauthority entrusted to it and the FRA by \u00a7207(a).\n  On that point this Court\u2019s decision in Lebron v. National\nRailroad Passenger Corp., 513 U. S. 374 (1995), provides\nnecessary instruction. In Lebron, Amtrak prohibited an\nartist from installing a politically controversial display in\nNew York City\u2019s Penn Station. The artist sued Amtrak,\nalleging a violation of his First Amendment rights. In\nresponse Amtrak asserted that it was not a governmental\nentity, explaining that \u201cits charter\u2019s disclaimer of agency\nstatus prevent[ed] it from being considered a Government\nentity.\u201d Id., at 392. The Court rejected this contention,\nholding \u201cit is not for Congress to make the final determi\u00ad\nnation of Amtrak\u2019s status as a Government entity for\npurposes of determining the constitutional rights of citi\u00ad\nzens affected by its actions.\u201d Ibid. To hold otherwise\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould allow the Government \u201cto evade the most solemn\nobligations imposed in the Constitution by simply resort\u00ad\ning to the corporate form.\u201d Id., at 397. Noting that\nAmtrak \u201cis established and organized under federal law\nfor the very purpose of pursuing federal governmental\nobjectives, under the direction and control of federal gov\u00ad\nernmental appointees,\u201d id., at 398, and that the Govern\u00ad\nment exerts its control over Amtrak \u201cnot as a creditor but\nas a policymaker,\u201d the Court held Amtrak \u201cis an agency or\ninstrumentality of the United States for the purpose of\nindividual rights guaranteed against the Government by\nthe Constitution.\u201d Id., at 394, 399.\n   Lebron teaches that, for purposes of Amtrak\u2019s status as\na federal actor or instrumentality under the Constitution,\nthe practical reality of federal control and supervision\nprevails over Congress\u2019 disclaimer of Amtrak\u2019s governmen\u00ad\ntal status. Lebron involved a First Amendment question,\nwhile in this case the challenge is to Amtrak\u2019s joint au\u00ad\nthority to issue the metrics and standards. But \u201c[t]he\nstructural principles secured by the separation of powers\nprotect the individual as well.\u201d Bond v. United States, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10). Treating Amtrak as\ngovernmental for these purposes, moreover, is not an\nunbridled grant of authority to an unaccountable actor.\nThe political branches created Amtrak, control its Board,\ndefine its mission, specify many of its day-to-day opera\u00ad\ntions, have imposed substantial transparency and ac\u00ad\ncountability mechanisms, and, for all practical purposes,\nset and supervise its annual budget. Accordingly, the\nCourt holds that Amtrak is a governmental entity, not a\nprivate one, for purposes of determining the constitutional\nissues presented in this case.\n                           III\n   Because the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was based on the\nflawed premise that Amtrak should be treated as a private\n12 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v.

On remand, the Court\nof Appeals, after identifying the issues that are properly\npreserved and before it, will then have the instruction of\nthe analysis set forth here. Respondent argues that the\nselection of Amtrak\u2019s president, who is appointed \u201cnot by\nthe President . . . but by the other eight Board Members,\u201d\n\u201ccall[s] into question Amtrak\u2019s structure under the Ap\u00ad\npointments Clause,\u201d Brief for Respondent 42; that\n\u00a7207(d)\u2019s arbitrator provision \u201cis a plain violation of the\nnondelegation principle\u201d and the Appointments Clause\nrequiring invalidation of \u00a7207(a), id., at 26; and that Con\u00ad\ngress violated the Due Process Clause by \u201cgiv[ing] a feder\u00ad\nally chartered, nominally private, for-profit corporation\nregulatory authority over its own industry,\u201d id., at 43.\nPetitioners, in turn, contend that \u201cthe metrics and stand\u00ad\nards do not reflect the exercise of \u2018rulemaking\u2019 authority or\npermit Amtrak to \u2018regulate other private entities,\u2019 \u201d and\nthus do not raise nondelegation concerns.

Ante, at 11. \u201cAmtrak was created by the Gov-\nernment, is controlled by the Government, and operates\nfor the Government\u2019s benefit.\u201d Ante, at 10. The Govern-\nment even \u201cspecif[ies] many of its day-to-day operations\u201d\nand \u201cfor all practical purposes, set[s] and supervise[s] its\nannual budget.\u201d Ante, at 11. The District of Columbia\nCircuit understandably heeded 49 U. S. C. \u00a724301(a)(3),\nwhich proclaims that Amtrak \u201cis not a department, agency,\nor instrumentality of the United States Government,\u201d\nbut this statutory label cannot control for constitutional\npurposes. (Emphasis added). I therefore join the Court\u2019s\nopinion in full. I write separately to discuss what follows\nfrom our judgment.\n                              I\n  This case, on its face, may seem to involve technical\nissues, but in discussing trains, tracks, metrics, and\nstandards, a vital constitutional principle must not be\nforgotten: Liberty requires accountability.\n  When citizens cannot readily identify the source of\nlegislation or regulation that affects their lives, Govern-\n2   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\nment officials can wield power without owning up to the\nconsequences. One way the Government can regulate\nwithout accountability is by passing off a Government\noperation as an independent private concern. Given this\nincentive to regulate without saying so, everyone should\npay close attention when Congress \u201csponsor[s] corpora-\ntions that it specifically designate[s] not to be agencies or\nestablishments of the United States Government.\u201d Lebron\nv. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S.\n374, 390 (1995).\n   Recognition that Amtrak is part of the Federal Govern-\nment raises a host of constitutional questions.\n                               II\n   I begin with something that may seem mundane on its\nface but that has a significant relationship to the principle\nof accountability. Under the Constitution, all officers of\nthe United States must take an oath or affirmation to\nsupport the Constitution and must receive a commission.\nSee Art. VI, cl. 3 (\u201c[A]ll executive and judicial Officers . . .\nshall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this\nConstitution\u201d); Art. II, \u00a73, cl. 6 (The President \u201cshall\nCommission all the Officers of the United States\u201d). There\nis good reason to think that those who have not sworn an\noath cannot exercise significant authority of the United\nStates. See 14 Op. Atty. Gen. 406, 408 (1874) (\u201c[A] Repre-\nsentative . . . does not become a member of the House until\nhe takes the oath of office\u201d); 15 Op. Atty. Gen. 280, 281\n(1877) (similar).* And this Court certainly has never\ntreated a commission from the President as a mere wall\nornament. See, e.g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n156 (1803); see also id., at 179 (noting the importance of\nan oath).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * It is noteworthy that the first statute enacted by Congress was \u201cAn\nAct to regulate the Time and Manner of administering certain Oaths.\u201d\nAct of June 1, 1789, ch. 1, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 23.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n  Both the Oath and Commission Clauses confirm an\nimportant point: Those who exercise the power of Gov-\nernment are set apart from ordinary citizens. Because\nthey exercise greater power, they are subject to special\nrestraints. There should never be a question whether\nsomeone is an officer of the United States because, to be\nan officer, the person should have sworn an oath and\npossess a commission.\n  Here, respondent tells the Court that \u201cAmtrak\u2019s board\nmembers do not take an oath of office to uphold the Con-\nstitution, as do Article II officers vested with rulemaking\nauthority.\u201d Brief for Respondent 47. The Government\nsays not a word in response. Perhaps there is an answer.\nThe rule, however, is clear. Because Amtrak is the Gov-\nernment, ante, at 11, those who run it need to satisfy basic\nconstitutional requirements.\n                              III\n   I turn next to the Passenger Rail Investment and Im-\nprovement Act of 2008\u2019s (PRIIA) arbitration provision.\n122 Stat. 4907. Section 207(a) of the PRIIA provides that\n\u201cthe Federal Railroad Administration [(FRA)] and Amtrak\nshall jointly . . . develop new or improve existing metrics\nand minimum standards for measuring the performance\nand service quality of intercity passenger train opera-\ntions.\u201d Id., at 4916. In addition, \u00a7207(c) commands that\n\u201c[t]o the extent practicable, Amtrak and its host rail carri-\ners shall incorporate [those] metrics and standards . . .\ninto their access and service agreements.\u201d Under \u00a7213(a)\nof the PRIIA, moreover, \u201cthe metrics and standards also\nmay play a role in prompting investigations by the [Sur-\nface Transportation Board (STB)] and in subsequent\nenforcement actions.\u201d Ante, at 4.\n   This scheme is obviously regulatory. Section 207 pro-\nvides that Amtrak and the FRA \u201cshall jointly\u201d create new\nstandards, cf. e.g., 12 U. S. C. \u00a71831m(g)(4)(B) (\u201cThe ap-\n4   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\npropriate Federal banking agencies shall jointly issue\nrules of practice to implement this paragraph\u201d), and that\nAmtrak and private rail carriers \u201cshall incorporate\u201d those\nstandards into their agreements whenever \u201cpracticable,\u201d\ncf. e.g., BP America Production Co. v. Burton, 549 U. S. 84,\n88 (2006) (characterizing a command to \u201c \u2018audit and recon-\ncile, to the extent practicable, all current and past lease\naccounts\u2019 \u201d as creating \u201cduties\u201d for the Secretary of the\nInterior (quoting 30 U. S. C. \u00a71711(c)(1))). The fact that\nprivate rail carriers sometimes may be required by federal\nlaw to include the metrics and standards in their contracts\nby itself makes this a regulatory scheme.\n   \u201cAs is often the case in administrative law,\u201d moreover,\n\u201cthe metrics and standards lend definite regulatory force\nto an otherwise broad statutory mandate.\u201d 721 F. 3d 666,\n672 (CADC 2013). Here, though the nexus between regu-\nlation, statutory mandate, and penalty is not direct (for, as\nthe Government explains, there is a pre-existing require-\nment that railroads give preference to Amtrak, see Brief\nfor Petitioners 31\u201332 (citing 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a724308(c), (f )),\nthe metrics and standards inherently have a \u201ccoercive\neffect,\u201d Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 169 (1997), on\nprivate conduct. Even the United States concedes, with\nunderstatement, that there is \u201cperhaps some incentivizing\neffect associated with the metrics and standards.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 30. Because obedience to the metrics and\nstandards materially reduces the risk of liability, railroads\nface powerful incentives to obey. See Bennett, supra, at\n169\u2013171. That is regulatory power.\n   The language from \u00a7207 quoted thus far should raise\nred flags. In one statute, Congress says Amtrak is not an\n\u201cagency.\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a724301(a)(3). But then Congress\ncommands Amtrak to act like an agency, with effects on\nprivate rail carriers. No wonder the D. C. Circuit ruled as\nit did.\n   The oddity continues, however. Section 207(d) of the\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nPRIIA also provides that if the FRA and Amtrak cannot\nagree about what the regulatory standards should say,\nthen \u201cany party involved in the development of those\nstandards may petition the Surface Transportation Board\nto appoint an arbitrator to assist the parties in resolving\ntheir disputes through binding arbitration.\u201d 122 Stat.\n4917. The statute says nothing more about this \u201cbinding\narbitration,\u201d including who the arbitrator should be.\n   Looking to Congress\u2019 use of the word \u201carbitrator,\u201d re-\nspondent argues that because the arbitrator can be a\nprivate person, this provision by itself violates the pri-\nvate nondelegation doctrine. The United States, for its\npart, urges the Court to read the term \u201carbitrator\u201d to\nmean \u201cpublic arbitrator\u201d in the interests of constitutional\navoidance.\n   No one disputes, however, that the arbitration provision\nis fair game for challenge, even though no arbitration\noccurred. The obvious purpose of the arbitration provision\nwas to force Amtrak and the FRA to compromise, or else a\nthird party would make the decision for them. The D. C.\nCircuit is correct that when Congress enacts a compromise-\nforcing mechanism, it is no good to say that the mech-\nanism cannot be challenged because the parties com-\npromised. See 721 F. 3d, at 674. \u201c[S]tack[ing] the deck\nin favor of compromise\u201d was the whole point. Ibid.\nUnsurprisingly, this Court has upheld standing to bring a\nseparation-of-powers challenge in comparable circum-\nstances. See Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority\nv. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.

Even the United States\naccepts that Congress \u201ccannot delegate regulatory author-\nity to a private entity.\u201d 721 F. 3d, at 670. Indeed, Con-\ngress, vested with enumerated \u201clegislative Powers,\u201d Art. I,\n\u00a71, cannot delegate its \u201cexclusively legislative\u201d authority\nat all. Wayman v.

J.). The Court has invalidated statutes for\nthat very reason. See A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.\nUnited States; 295 U. S. 495 (1935); Panama Refining Co.\nv. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935); see also Mistretta v. United\nStates, 488 U. S. 361, 373, n. 7 (1989) (citing, inter alia,\nIndustrial Union Dept., AFL\u2013CIO v. American Petroleum\nInstitute, 448 U. S. 607, 646 (1980)).\n   The principle that Congress cannot delegate away its\nvested powers exists to protect liberty. Our Constitution,\nby careful design, prescribes a process for making law, and\nwithin that process there are many accountability check-\npoints. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 959 (1983). It\nwould dash the whole scheme if Congress could give its\npower away to an entity that is not constrained by those\ncheckpoints. The Constitution\u2019s deliberative process was\nviewed by the Framers as a valuable feature, see, e.g.,\nManning, Lawmaking Made Easy, 10 Green Bag 2d 202\n(2007) (\u201c[B]icameralism and presentment make lawmak-\ning difficult by design\u201d (citing, inter alia, The Federalist\nNo. 62, p. 378 (J. Madison), and No. 63, at 443\u2013444 (A.\nHamilton))), not something to be lamented and evaded.\n   Of course, this Court has \u201c \u2018almost never felt qualified to\nsecond-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of\npolicy judgment that can be left to those executing or\napplying the law.\u2019 \u201d      Whitman v. American Trucking\nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 474\u2013475 (2001) (quoting Mis-\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

But the\ninherent difficulty of line-drawing is no excuse for not\nenforcing the Constitution. Rather, the formal reason why\nthe Court does not enforce the nondelegation doctrine with\nmore vigilance is that the other branches of Government\nhave vested powers of their own that can be used in ways\nthat resemble lawmaking. See, e.g., Arlington v. FCC, 569\nU. S. ___, ___\u2013___, n. 4 (2013) (slip op., at 13\u201314, n. 4)\n(explaining that agency rulemakings \u201care exercises of\u2014\nindeed, under our constitutional structure they must be\nexercises of\u2014the \u2018executive Power\u2019 \u201d (quoting Art. II, \u00a71,\ncl. 1)). Even so, \u201cthe citizen confronting thousands of\npages of regulations\u2014promulgated by an agency directed\nby Congress to regulate, say, \u2018in the public interest\u2019\u2014can\nperhaps be excused for thinking that it is the agency really\ndoing the legislating.\u201d 569 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4\u20135).\n   When it comes to private entities, however, there is not\neven a fig leaf of constitutional justification. Private\nentities are not vested with \u201clegislative Powers.\u201d Art. I,\n\u00a71. Nor are they vested with the \u201cexecutive Power,\u201d\nArt. II, \u00a71, cl. 1, which belongs to the President. Indeed, it\nraises \u201c[d]ifficult and fundamental questions\u201d about \u201cthe\ndelegation of Executive power\u201d when Congress authorizes\ncitizen suits. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envi-\nronmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 197 (2000)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). A citizen suit to enforce exist-\ning law, however, is nothing compared to delegated power\nto create new law. By any measure, handing off regu-\nlatory power to a private entity is \u201clegislative delegation\nin its most obnoxious form.\u201d Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298\nU. S. 238, 311 (1936).\n   For these reasons, it is hard to imagine how delegating\n\u201cbinding\u201d tie-breaking authority to a private arbitrator to\nresolve a dispute between Amtrak and the FRA could be\nconstitutional. No private arbitrator can promulgate\n8   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF \n\n                AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\nbinding metrics and standards for the railroad industry.\nThus, if the term \u201carbitrator\u201d refers to a private arbitrator,\nor even the possibility of a private arbitrator, the Consti-\ntution is violated. See 721 F. 3d, at 674 (\u201c[T]hat the recip-\nients of illicitly delegated authority opted not to make use\nof it is no antidote. It is Congress\u2019s decision to delegate\nthat is unconstitutional\u201d (citing Whitman, supra, at 473)).\n   As I read the Government\u2019s briefing, it does not dispute\nany of this (other than my characterization of the PRIIA\nas regulatory, which it surely is). Rather than trying to\ndefend a private arbitrator, the Government argues that\nthe Court, for reasons of constitutional avoidance, should\nread the word \u201carbitrator\u201d to mean \u201cpublic arbitrator.\u201d\nThe Government\u2019s argument, however, lurches into a new\nproblem: Constitutional avoidance works only if the stat-\nute is susceptible to an alternative reading and that such\nan alternative reading would itself be constitutional.\n   Here, the Government\u2019s argument that the word \u201carbi-\ntrator\u201d does not mean \u201cprivate arbitrator\u201d is in some ten-\nsion with the ordinary meaning of the word. Although\nGovernment arbitrators are not unheard of, we usually\nthink of arbitration as a form of \u201cprivate dispute resolu-\ntion.\u201d See, e.g., Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l\nCorp., 559 U. S. 662, 685 (2010).\n   Likewise, the appointment of a public arbitrator here\nwould raise serious questions under the Appointments\nClause. Unless an \u201cinferior Office[r]\u201d is at issue, Article II\nof the Constitution demands that the President appoint all\n\u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d with the Senate\u2019s advice\nand consent. Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. This provision ensures that\nthose who exercise the power of the United States are\naccountable to the President, who himself is accountable\nto the people. See Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at\n497\u2013498 (citing The Federalist No. 72, p. 487 (J. Cooke ed.\n1961) (A. Hamilton)).

S. 651, 663 (1997)\n(\u201c[W]e think it evident that \u2018inferior officers\u2019 are officers\nwhose work is directed and supervised at some level by\nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate\u201d). While some\nofficers may be principal even if they have a supervisor, it\nis common ground that an officer without a supervisor\nmust be principal. See id., at 667 (Souter, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment).\n   Here, even under the Government\u2019s public-arbitrator\ntheory, it looks like the arbitrator would be making law\nwithout supervision\u2014again, it is \u201cbinding arbitration.\u201d\nNothing suggests that those words mean anything other\nthan what they say. This means that an arbitrator could\nset the metrics and standards that \u201cshall\u201d become part of a\nprivate railroad\u2019s contracts with Amtrak whenever \u201cprac-\nticable.\u201d As to that \u201cbinding\u201d decision, who is the supervi-\nsor? Inferior officers can do many things, but nothing\nfinal should appear in the Federal Register unless a Pres-\nidential appointee has at least signed off on it. See 75\nFed. Reg. 26839 (2010) (placing the metrics and standards\nin the Federal Register); Edmond, supra, at 665.\n                            IV\n  Finally, the Board of Amtrak, and, in particular,\nAmtrak\u2019s president, also poses difficult constitutional\nproblems. As the Court observes, \u201cAmtrak\u2019s Board of\nDirectors is composed of nine members, one of whom is the\nSecretary of Transportation. Seven other Board members\nare appointed by the President and confirmed by the\nSenate. These eight Board members, in turn, select\nAmtrak\u2019s president.\u201d Ante, at 7 (citation omitted). In\nother words, unlike everyone else on the Board, Amtrak\u2019s\n10 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n                  ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\npresident has not been appointed by the President and\nconfirmed by the Senate.\n   As explained above, accountability demands that princi-\npal officers be appointed by the President. See Art. II, \u00a72,\ncl. 2. The President, after all, must have \u201cthe general\nadministrative control of those executing the laws,\u201d Myers\nv. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 164 (1926), and this princi-\nple applies with special force to those who can \u201cexercis[e]\nsignificant authority\u201d without direct supervision, Buckley,\nsupra, at 126; see also Edmond, supra, at 663. Unsurpris-\ningly then, the United States defends the non-Presidential\nappointment of Amtrak\u2019s president on the ground that the\nAmtrak president is merely an inferior officer. Given\nArticle II, for the Government to argue anything else\nwould be surrender.\n   This argument, however, is problematic. Granted, a\nmultimember body may head an agency. See Free Enter-\nprise Fund, supra, at 512\u2013513. But those who head agen-\ncies must be principal officers. See Edmond, supra, at\n663. It would seem to follow that because agency heads\nmust be principal officers, every member of a multimem-\nber body heading an agency must also be a principal of-\nficer. After all, every member of a multimember body\ncould cast the deciding vote with respect to a particular\ndecision. One would think that anyone who has the uni-\nlateral authority to tip a final decision one way or the\nother cannot be an inferior officer.\n   The Government\u2019s response is tucked away in a foot-\nnote. It contends that because Amtrak\u2019s president serves\nat the pleasure of the other Board members, he is only an\ninferior officer. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 14, n. 6.\nBut the Government does not argue that the president of\nAmtrak cannot cast tie-breaking votes. Assuming he can\nvote when the Board of Directors is divided, it makes no\nsense to think that the side with which the president\nagrees will demand his removal.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n   In any event, even assuming that Amtrak\u2019s president\ncould be an inferior officer, there would still be another\nproblem: Amtrak\u2019s Board may lack constitutional author-\nity to appoint inferior officers. The Appointments Clause\nprovides an exception from the ordinary rule of Presiden-\ntial appointment for \u201cinferior Officers,\u201d but that exception\nhas accountability limits of its own, namely, that Congress\nmay only vest the appointment power \u201cin the President\nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. Although a multimember body\nlike Amtrak\u2019s Board can head a Department, here it is not\nat all clear that Amtrak is a Department.\n   A \u201cDepartment\u201d may not be \u201csubordinate to or contained\nwithin any other such component\u201d of the Executive\nBranch. Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at 511. As\nexplained above, however, in jointly creating metrics and\nstandards, Amtrak may have to give way to an arbitrator\nappointed by the STB. Does that mean that Amtrak is\n\u201csubordinate to\u201d the STB? See also 49 U. S. C. \u00a724308\n(explaining the STB\u2019s role in disputes between Amtrak\nand rail carriers). At the same time, the Secretary of\nTransportation sits on Amtrak\u2019s Board and controls some\naspects of Amtrak\u2019s relationship with rail carriers. See,\ne.g., \u00a7\u00a724302(a)(1), 24309(d)(2). The Secretary of Trans-\nportation also has authority to exempt Amtrak from cer-\ntain statutory requirements. See \u00a724305(f)(4). Does that\nmean that Amtrak is \u201csubordinate to or contained within\u201d\nthe Department of Transportation? (The STB, of course,\nalso may be \u201csubordinate to or contained within\u201d the\nDepartment of Transportation. If so, this may further\nsuggest that that Amtrak is not a Department, and also\nfurther undermine the STB\u2019s ability to appoint an arbitra-\ntor). All of these are difficult questions.\n                    *     *    *\n  In sum, while I entirely agree with the Court that\n12 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v.

Those Clauses provide that\n\u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a\nCongress of the United States,\u201d Art. I, \u00a71, \u201c[t]he executive\nPower shall be vested in a President of the United States,\u201d\nArt. II, \u00a71, cl. 1, and \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the United\nStates, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such\ninferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time\nordain and establish,\u201d Art. III, \u00a71.\n   These grants are exclusive. See Whitman v. American\nTrucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 472 (2001) (legislative\npower); Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Account-\ning Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, 496\u2013497 (2010) (execu-\ntive power); Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___\n(2011) (slip op., at 16\u201317) (judicial power). When the\nGovernment is called upon to perform a function that\nrequires an exercise of legislative, executive, or judicial\npower, only the vested recipient of that power can per-\nform it.\n   In addition to allocating power among the different\nbranches, the Constitution identifies certain restrictions\non the manner in which those powers are to be exercised.\nArticle I requires, among other things, that \u201c[e]very Bill\nwhich shall have passed the House of Representatives and\nthe Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to\nthe President of the United States; If he approve he shall\nsign it, but if not he shall return it . . . .\u201d Art. I, \u00a77, cl. 2.\nAnd although the Constitution is less specific about how\nthe President shall exercise power, it is clear that he may\ncarry out his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully\nexecuted with the aid of subordinates.

S. 602 (1935).\n   When the Court speaks of Congress improperly delegat-\ning power, what it means is Congress\u2019 authorizing an\nentity to exercise power in a manner inconsistent with the\nConstitution. For example, Congress improperly \u201cdele-\ngates\u201d legislative power when it authorizes an entity other\nthan itself to make a determination that requires an\nexercise of legislative power. See Whitman, supra, at 472.\nIt also improperly \u201cdelegates\u201d legislative power to itself\nwhen it authorizes itself to act without bicameralism and\npresentment. See, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919\n(1983). And Congress improperly \u201cdelegates\u201d\u2014or, more\nprecisely, authorizes the exercise of, see Perez v. Mortgage\nBankers Assn., post, at 22 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment) (noting that Congress may not \u201cdelegate\u201d power\nit does not possess)\u2014executive power when it authorizes\nindividuals or groups outside of the President\u2019s control to\nperform a function that requires the exercise of that power.\nSee, e.g., Free Enterprise Fund, supra.\n   In order to be able to adhere to the provisions of the\nConstitution that allocate and constrain the exercise of\nthese powers, we must first understand their boundaries.\nHere, I do not purport to offer a comprehensive description\nof these powers. My purpose is to identify principles\nrelevant to today\u2019s dispute, with an eye to offering guid-\nance to the lower courts on remand. At issue in this case\nis the proper division between legislative and executive\npowers. An examination of the history of those powers\nreveals how far our modern separation-of-powers juris-\nprudence has departed from the original meaning of the\nConstitution.\n                             II\n  The allocation of powers in the Constitution is absolute,\nPerez, post, at 5\u20138 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), but it does not\n4   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v.

Certain functions may be\nperformed by two or more branches without either exceed-\ning its enumerated powers under the Constitution. Reso-\nlution of claims against the Government is the classic\nexample. At least when Congress waives its sovereign\nimmunity, such claims may be heard by an Article III\ncourt, which adjudicates such claims by an exercise of\njudicial power. See Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438,\n452 (1929). But Congress may also provide for an execu-\ntive agency to adjudicate such claims by an exercise of\nexecutive power. See ibid. Or Congress may resolve the\nclaims itself, legislating by special Act. See ibid. The\nquestion is whether the particular function requires the\nexercise of a certain type of power; if it does, then only the\nbranch in which that power is vested can perform it. For\nexample, although this Court has long recognized that it\ndoes not necessarily violate the Constitution for Congress\nto authorize another branch to make a determination that\nit could make itself, there are certain core functions that\nrequire the exercise of legislative power and that only\nCongress can perform.

Under the original\nunderstanding of the Constitution, that function requires\nthe exercise of legislative power. By corollary, the discre-\ntion inherent in executive power does not comprehend the\ndiscretion to formulate generally applicable rules of pri-\nvate conduct.\n                            A\n  The idea that the Executive may not formulate generally\napplicable rules of private conduct emerged even before\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

M.\nVile, Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers 25\n(2d ed. 1998); 2 Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus\nAngliae 33 (G. Woodbine ed., S. Thorne transl. 1968). The\nprinciple that a ruler must govern according to law \u201cpre-\nsupposes at least two distinct operations, the making of\nlaw, and putting it into effect.\u201d Vile, supra, at 24. Al-\nthough it was originally thought \u201cthat the rule of law was\nsatisfied if a king made good laws and always acted ac-\ncording to them,\u201d it became increasingly apparent over\ntime that the rule of law demanded that the operations of\n\u201cmaking\u201d law and of \u201cputting it into effect\u201d be kept sepa-\nrate. W. Gwyn, The Meaning of the Separation of Powers\n35 (1965); see also id., at 8\u20139. But when the King\u2019s power\nwas at its height, it was still accepted that his \u201cprincipal\nduty . . . [was], to govern his people according to law.\u201d 1\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 226\n(1765) (Commentaries) (emphasis added).\n   An early expression of this idea in England is seen in\nthe \u201cconstitutional\u201d law concerning crown proclamations.\nEven before a more formal separation of powers came\nabout during the English Civil War, it was generally\nthought that the King could not use his proclamation\npower to alter the rights and duties of his subjects. P.\nHamburger, Is Administrative Law Unlawful? 33\u201334\n(2014) (Hamburger). This power could be exercised by the\nKing only in conjunction with Parliament and was exer-\ncised through statutes. Ibid.; see also M. Hale, The Pre-\nrogatives of the King 141, 171\u2013172 (D. Yale ed. 1976). The\nKing might participate in \u201cthe legislative power\u201d by giving\nhis \u201cassent\u201d to laws created by the \u201cconcurrence\u201d of \u201clords\n6   DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v.

Hamburger\n35\u201336. That Act declared that the King\u2019s proclamations\nwould have the force and effect of an Act of Parliament.\nId., at 37. But the Act did not permit the King to deprive\nhis subjects of their property, privileges and franchises, or\ntheir lives, except as provided by statutory or common law.\nId., at 37\u201338.

Stat. at Large 263 (1539)).\n    Even this limited delegation of lawmaking power to the\nKing was repudiated by Parliament less than a decade\nlater. Hamburger 38. Reflecting on this period in history,\nDavid Hume would observe that, when Parliament \u201cgave\nto the king\u2019s proclamation the same force as to a statute\nenacted by parliament,\u201d it \u201cmade by one act a total sub-\nversion of the English constitution.\u201d 3 D. Hume, The\nHistory of England from the Invasion of Julius Ceasar to\nthe Revolution in 1688, p. 266 (1983). By the 17th century,\nwhen English scholars and jurists began to articulate a\nmore formal theory of the separation of powers, delega-\ntions of the type afforded to King Henry VIII were all but\nunheard of. Hale, supra, at 172\u2013173.\n    This is not to say that the Crown did not endeavor to\nexercise the power to make rules governing private con-\nduct. King James I made a famous attempt, see Perez,\npost, at 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), prompting the influen-\ntial jurist Chief Justice Edward Coke to write that the\nKing could not \u201cchange any part of the common law, nor\ncreate any offence by his proclamation, which was not an\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

Coke associated this principle with Chapter 39 of\nthe Magna Carta,1 which he understood to guarantee that\nno subject would be deprived of a private right\u2014that is, a\nright of life, liberty, or property\u2014except in accordance\nwith \u201cthe law of the land,\u201d which consisted only of statu-\ntory and common law. Chapman & McConnell, Due Process\nas Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L. J. 1672, 1688 (2012).\nWhen the King attempted to fashion rules of private con-\nduct unilaterally, as he did in the Case of Proclamations,\nthe resulting enforcement action could not be said to\naccord with \u201cthe law of the land.\u201d\n   John Locke echoed this view. \u201c[F]reedom of men under\ngovernment,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis to have a standing rule to live\nby, common to every one of that society, and made by the\nlegislative power erected in it . . . and not to be subject to\nthe inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of\nanother man.\u201d J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Govern-\nment \u00a722, p. 13 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (Locke) (emphasis\nadded). It followed that this freedom required that the\npower to make the standing rules and the power to enforce\nthem not lie in the same hands. See id., \u00a7143, at 72. He\nfurther concluded that \u201c[t]he legislative c[ould not] trans-\nfer the power of making laws to any other hands: for it\nbeing but a delegated power from the people, they who\nhave it [could not] pass it over to others.\u201d Id., \u00a7141, at 71.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Chapter 39 of the 1215 Magna Carta declared that \u201c[n]o free man\n\nshall be taken, imprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any\nway destroyed, nor will We proceed against or prosecute him, except by\nthe lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.\u201d A. How-\nard, Magna Carta: Text and Commentary 43 (1964).\n  2 Locke and his contemporaries also believed that requiring laws to be\n\nmade in Parliament secured the common interest. W.

Implicitly\nrecognizing that the power to fashion legally binding rules\nis legislative, we have nevertheless classified rulemaking\nas executive (or judicial) power when the authorizing\nstatute sets out \u201can intelligible principle\u201d to guide the\nrulemaker\u2019s discretion. Ibid. Although the Court may\nnever have intended the boundless standard the \u201cintelligi-\nble principle\u201d test has become, it is evident that it does not\nadequately reinforce the Constitution\u2019s allocation of legis-\nlative power. I would return to the original understanding\nof the federal legislative power and require that the Fed-\neral Government create generally applicable rules of\nprivate conduct only through the constitutionally pre-\nscribed legislative process.\n                                A\n    The Court first announced the intelligible principle test\nin J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S.\n394 (1928). That case involved a challenge to a tariff\nassessed on a shipment of barium dioxide. Id., at 400.\nThe rate of the tariff had been set by proclamation of the\nPresident, pursuant to the so-called flexible tariff provi-\nsion of the Tariff Act of 1922. Ibid. That provision author-\nized the President to increase or decrease a duty set by the\nstatute if he determined that the duty did not \u201c \u2018equalize\n. . . differences in costs of production [of the item to which\nthe duty applied] in the United States and the principal\ncompeting country.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 401 (quoting 19 U.

At the time J. W. Hampton was decided, most\n\u201cdelegations\u201d by Congress to the Executive, including the\ndelegation at issue in that case, had taken the form of\nconditional legislation. See Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark,\n143 U. S. 649, 683\u2013689 (1892). That form of legislation\n\u201cmakes the suspension of certain provisions and the going\ninto operation of other provisions of an Act of Congress\ndepend upon the action of the President based upon the\noccurrence of subsequent events, or the ascertainment by\nhim of certain facts, to be made known by his proclama-\ntion.\u201d Id., at 683.\n   The practice of conditional legislation dates back at\nleast to the Third Congress in 1794. Id., at 683\u2013689 (col-\nlecting statutes). It first came before the Court in Cargo of\nBrig Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch 382 (1813). There,\nthe Court considered whether a Presidential proclamation\ncould, by declaring that France had ceased to violate the\nneutral commerce of the United States, reinstate a legisla-\ntive Act embargoing British goods. Id., at 384, 388. The\nCourt concluded that the proclamation was effective,\nseeing \u201cno sufficient reaso[n] why the legislature should\nnot exercise its discretion . . . either expressly or condi-\ntionally, as their judgment should direct.\u201d Id., at 388.\n   At least as defined by the Court in Field, the practice of\nconditional legislation does not seem to call on the Presi-\ndent to exercise a core function that demands an exercise\nof legislative power. Congress creates the rule of private\nconduct, and the President makes the factual determina-\ntion that causes that rule to go into effect. That type of\nfactual determination seems similar to the type of factual\ndetermination on which an enforcement action is condi-\n14 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n            THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntioned: Neither involves an exercise of policy discretion,\nand both are subject to review by a court. See Union\nBridge Co. v. United States, 204 U.

For example, a 1794 provision\nentitled \u201cAn Act to authorize the President of the United\nStates to lay, regulate and revoke Embargoes,\u201d ch. 41, 1\nStat. 372, called on the President to impose an embargo on\nshipping \u201cwhenever, in his opinion, the public safety shall\nso require . . . .\u201d Ibid. The statutes at issue in Field and\nJ. W. Hampton could similarly be viewed as calling for\nbuilt-in policy judgments. See Schoenbrod, The Delega-\ntion Doctrine: Could The Court Give It Substance? 83\nMich. L. Rev. 1223, 1263\u20131264 (1985).4 Such delegations\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  statute at issue in Field authorized the President to reimpose\nstatutory duties on exports from a particular country if he found that\nthe country had imposed \u201creciprocally unequal and unreasonable\u201d\nduties on U. S. exports. 143 U. S., at 692. At least insofar as the terms\n\u201cunequal\u201d and \u201cunreasonable\u201d did not have settled common-law defini-\ntions that could be applied mechanically to the facts, they could be said\nto call for the President to exercise policy judgment about which duties\nqualified. See id., at 699 (Lamar, J., dissenting but concurring in\njudgment) (The statute \u201cdoes not, as was provided in the statutes of\n1809 and 1810, entrust the President with the ascertainment of a fact\ntherein defined upon which the law is to go into operation.

He may\ndo so expressly\u2014by setting out regulations specifying\nwhat conduct jeopardizes \u201cthe public safety,\u201d for exam-\nple\u2014or implicitly\u2014by drawing distinctions on an ad hoc\nbasis. In either event, he does so based on a policy judg-\nment that is not reviewable by the courts, at least to the\nextent that the judgment falls within the range of discre-\ntion permitted him by the law. See id., at 1255\u20131260.\n   The existence of these statutes should not be taken to\nsuggest that the Constitution, as originally understood,\nwould permit such delegations. The 1794 embargo statute\ninvolved the external relations of the United States, so the\ndetermination it authorized the President to make argua-\nbly did not involve an exercise of core legislative power.\nSee id., at 1260\u20131263 (distinguishing the tariff statute at\nissue in Field and J. W. Hampton on these grounds).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nble. . . \u2019 \u201d). Similarly, the statute at issue in J. W. Hampton called on\nthe President, with the aid of a commission, to determine the \u201c \u2018costs of\nproduction\u2019 \u201d for various goods\u2014a calculation that could entail an\nexercise of policy judgment about the appropriate wage and profit rates\nin the relevant industries. 276 U. S., at 401.\n   5 The definition of \u201claw\u201d in England at the time of the ratification did\n\nnot necessarily include rules\u2014even rules of private conduct\u2014dealing\nwith external relations. For example, while \u201cevery Englishman [could]\nclaim a right to abide in his own country so long as he pleases; and not\nto be driven from it unless by the sentence of the law,\u201d the King \u201cby his\nroyal prerogative, [could] issue out his writ ne exeat regnum, and\nprohibit any of his subjects from going into foreign parts without\nlicence.\u201d 1 Commentaries 133. It is thus likely the Constitution grants\nthe President a greater measure of discretion in the realm of foreign\nrelations, and the conditional tariff Acts must be understood accord-\ningly. See Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 445 (1998) (distin-\nguishing Field on the ground that the statute at issue in Field regulated\nforeign trade); see also United States v.

ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n            THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nMoreover, the statute was never subjected to constitutional\nscrutiny. And when a statute of its kind\u2014that is, a\ntariff statute calling for an exercise of policy judgment\u2014\nfinally came before this Court for consideration in Field,\nthe Court appeared to understand the statute as calling\nfor no more than a factual determination. 143 U. S., at\n693. The Court thus did not in that case endorse the\nprinciple that the Executive may fashion generally appli-\ncable rules of private conduct and appears not to have\ndone so until the 20th century.\n   More to the point, J. W. Hampton can be read to adhere\nto the \u201cfactual determination\u201d rationale from Field. The\nCourt concluded its delegation analysis in J. W. Hampton\nnot with the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d language, but by citing\nto Field for the proposition that the \u201cAct did not in any\nreal sense invest the President with the power of legisla-\ntion, because nothing involving the expediency or just\noperation of such legislation was left to the determination\nof the President.\u201d 276 U.

Congress had created a \u201cnamed contin-\ngency,\u201d and the President \u201cwas the mere agent of the law-\nmaking department to ascertain and declare the event\nupon which its expressed will was to take effect.\u201d J.

Hampton may have been\npremised on an incorrect assessment of the statutes before\nthe Court, see n. 4, supra, but neither purported to define\nexecutive power as including the discretion to make gen-\nerally applicable rules governing private conduct. To the\nextent that our modern jurisprudence treats them as\nsanctioning the \u201cdelegation\u201d of such power, it misunder-\nstands their historical foundations and expands the\nCourt\u2019s holdings.\n                              B\n   It is nevertheless true that, at the time J.

Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall\nsurveyed a number of choices that could be left to rule-\nmaking by the courts, explaining that they concerned only\n\u201cthe regulation of the conduct of the officer of the Court in\ngiving effect to its judgments.\u201d Id., at 45. When it came to\nspecifying \u201cthe mode of obeying the mandate of a writ,\u201d\nhowever, he lamented that \u201cso much of that which may be\ndone by the judiciary, under the authority of the legisla-\nture, seems to be blended with that for which the legisla-\nture must expressly and directly provide.\u201d Id., at 46.\n   This important passage reflects two premises that Chief\nJustice Marshall took for granted, but which are disre-\ngarded in later decisions relying on this precedent: First,\nreflected in his discussion of \u201cblending\u201d permissible with\nimpermissible discretion, is the premise that it is not the\nquantity, but the quality, of the discretion that determines\nwhether an authorization is constitutional. Second, re-\nflected in the contrast Chief Justice Marshall draws be-\ntween the two types of rules, is the premise that the rules\n\u201cfor which the legislature must expressly and directly\nprovide\u201d are those regulating private conduct rather than\nthose regulating the conduct of court officers.\n   Thus, when Chief Justice Marshall spoke about the\n\u201cdifficulty in discerning the exact limits within which the\nlegislature may avail itself of the agency of its Courts,\u201d\nibid., he did not refer to the difficulty in discerning whether\nthe Legislature\u2019s policy guidance is \u201csufficiently de-\nfined,\u201d see Panama Refining, supra, at 429, but instead\nthe difficulty in discerning which rules affected substan-\ntive private rights and duties and which did not.

S. 393, 406\u2013407\n(2010) (\u201cIn the Rules Enabling Act, Congress authorized\nthis Court to promulgate rules of procedure subject to its\nreview, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072(a), but with the limitation that\nthose rules \u2018shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any sub-\nstantive right,\u2019 \u00a72072(b)\u201d).7\n                               C\n   Today, the Court has abandoned all pretense of enforc-\ning a qualitative distinction between legislative and exec-\nutive power. To the extent that the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d\ntest was ever an adequate means of enforcing that distinc-\ntion, it has been decoupled from the historical understand-\ning of the legislative and executive powers and thus does\nnot keep executive \u201clawmaking\u201d within the bounds of\ninherent executive discretion. See Whitman, 531 U. S., at\n487 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (\u201cI am not convinced that the\nintelligible principle doctrine serves to prevent all cessions\nof legislative power\u201d). Perhaps we were led astray by the\noptical illusion caused by different branches carrying out\nthe same functions, believing that the separation of pow-\ners would be substantially honored so long as the en-\ncroachment were not too great. See, e.g., Loving v. United\nStates, 517 U. S. 748, 773 (1996) (\u201cSeparation-of-powers\nprinciples are vindicated, not disserved, by measured\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Another early precedent on which the errant \u201csubordinate rulemak-\ning\u201d line of cases relies involves rules governing mining claims on\npublic land. Jackson v. Roby, 109 U. S. 440, 441 (1883); see also United\nStates v. Grimaud, 220 U. S. 506 (1911) (sustaining an Act authorizing\nthe Secretary of Agriculture to make rules and regulations governing\nthe use and occupancy of public forest reservations). Although perhaps\nquestionable on its own terms, Jackson is distinguishable because it did\nnot involve the Government\u2019s reaching out to regulate private conduct,\nbut instead involved the Government\u2019s setting rules by which individ-\nuals might enter onto public land to avail themselves of resources\nbelonging to the Government.\n20 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n\n            THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\ncooperation between two political branches of the Gov-\nernment, each contributing to a lawful objective through\nits own processes\u201d). Or perhaps we deliberately departed\nfrom the separation, bowing to the exigencies of modern\nGovernment that were so often cited in cases upholding\nchallenged delegations of rulemaking authority.8 See, e.g.,\nMistretta, 488 U. S., at 372 (\u201c[O]ur jurisprudence has been\ndriven by a practical understanding that in our increas-\ningly complex society, replete with ever changing and\nmore technical problems, Congress simply cannot do its\njob absent an ability to delegate power under broad gen-\neral directives\u201d).\n   For whatever reason, the intelligible principle test now\nrequires nothing more than a minimal degree of specificity\nin the instructions Congress gives to the Executive when it\nauthorizes the Executive to make rules having the force\nand effect of law. And because the Court has \u201c \u2018almost\nnever felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding\nthe permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left\nto those executing or applying the law,\u2019 \u201d Whitman, supra,\nat 474\u2013475 (majority opinion) (quoting Mistretta, supra, at\n416 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)), the level of specificity it has\nrequired has been very minimal indeed, see 531 U. S., at\n474 (collecting cases upholding delegations to regulate in\nthe \u201cpublic interest\u201d). Under the guise of the intelligible-\nprinciple test, the Court has allowed the Executive to go\nbeyond the safe realm of factual investigation to make\npolitical judgments about what is \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cunneces-\nsary.\u201d See, e.g., American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329\nU. S. 90, 104\u2013105 (1946). It has permitted the Executive\nto make trade-offs between competing policy goals. See,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Much of the upheaval in our delegation jurisprudence occurred dur-\n\ning the Progressive Era, a time marked by an increased faith in the\ntechnical expertise of agencies and a commensurate cynicism about\nprinciples of popular sovereignty.

It has even permitted the Execu-\ntive to decide which policy goals it wants to pursue. En-\ntergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper, Inc., 556 U. S. 208, 218\u2013223\n(2009) (concluding that Congress gave the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) discretion to decide whether it\nshould consider costs in making certain rules). And it has\ngiven sanction to the Executive to craft significant rules of\nprivate conduct. See, e.g., Whitman, 531 U.

To understand the \u201cintel-\nligible principle\u201d test as permitting Congress to delegate\npolicy judgment in this context is to divorce that test from\nits history.

I accept that this would inhibit the\nGovernment from acting with the speed and efficiency\nCongress has sometimes found desirable. In anticipating\nthat result and accepting it, I am in good company. John\nLocke, for example, acknowledged that a legislative body\n\u201cis usually too numerous, and so too slow for the dispatch\nrequisite to execution.\u201d Locke \u00a7160, at 80. But he saw\nthat as a benefit for legislation, for he believed that the\ncreation of rules of private conduct should be an irregular\nand infrequent occurrence. See id., \u00a7143, at 72. The\nFramers, it appears, were inclined to agree. As Alexander\nHamilton explained in another context, \u201cIt may perhaps\nbe said that the power of preventing bad laws includes\nthat of preventing good ones . . . . But this objection will\nhave little weight with those who can properly estimate\nthe mischiefs of that inconstancy and mutability in the\nlaws, which form the greatest blemish in the character\nand genius of our governments.\u201d The Federalist No. 73, at\n443\u2013444.

Because it also concluded that\nCongress delegated regulatory power to Amtrak, id., at\n670\u2013674, and because this Court has held that delegations\nof regulatory power to private parties are impermissible,\nCarter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 311 (1936), it held\nthe delegation to be unconstitutional, 721 F. 3d, at 677.\n   Although no provision of the Constitution expressly\nforbids the exercise of governmental power by a private\nentity, our so-called \u201cprivate nondelegation doctrine\u201d flows\nlogically from the three Vesting Clauses. Because a pri-\nvate entity is neither Congress, nor the President or one of\nhis agents, nor the Supreme Court or an inferior court\nestablished by Congress, the Vesting Clauses would cate-\ngorically preclude it from exercising the legislative, execu-\ntive, or judicial powers of the Federal Government. In\nshort, the \u201cprivate nondelegation doctrine\u201d is merely one\napplication of the provisions of the Constitution that\nforbid Congress to allocate power to an ineligible entity,\nwhether governmental or private.\n   For this reason, a conclusion that Amtrak is private\u2014\nthat is, not part of the Government at all\u2014would neces-\nsarily mean that it cannot exercise these three categories\nof governmental power. But the converse is not true: A\ndetermination that Amtrak acts as a governmental entity\nin crafting the metrics and standards says nothing about\nwhether it properly exercises governmental power when it\ndoes so. An entity that \u201cwas created by the Government,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 See Brief for Appellees in No. 12\u20135204 (DC), pp. 23\u201329 (defending\n\n\u00a7207 under cases upholding statutes \u201cassign[ing] an important role to a\nprivate party\u201d); id., at 29 (\u201cAmtrak . . . is not a private entity compar-\nable to the [private parties in a relevant precedent]. Although the\ngovernment does not control Amtrak\u2019s day-to-day operations, the\ngovernment exercises significant structural control\u201d).\n24 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v.

To\nits credit, the majority does not hold otherwise. It merely\nrefutes the Court of Appeals\u2019 premise that Amtrak is\nprivate. But this answer could be read to suggest, wrongly,\nthat our conclusion about Amtrak\u2019s status has some con-\nstitutional significance for \u201cdelegation\u201d purposes.\n                             B\n  The first step in the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis on re-\nmand should be to classify the power that \u00a7207 purports to\nauthorize Amtrak to exercise. The second step should be\nto determine whether the Constitution\u2019s requirements for\nthe exercise of that power have been satisfied.\n                             1\n   Under the original understanding of the legislative and\nexecutive power, Amtrak\u2019s role in the creation of metrics\nand standards requires an exercise of legislative power\nbecause it allows Amtrak to decide the applicability of\nstandards that provide content to generally applicable\nrules of private conduct.\n   Specifically, the metrics and standards alter the rail-\nroads\u2019 common-carrier obligations under 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a711101. Host railroads may enter into contracts with\nAmtrak under \u00a7\u00a710908 and 24308 to fulfill their common-\ncarrier obligations. The metrics and standards shape the\ntypes of contracts that satisfy the common-carrier obliga-\ntions because \u00a7207 provides that \u201cAmtrak and its host rail\ncarriers shall\u201d include the metrics and standards in their\ncontracts \u201c[t]o the extent practicable.\u201d PRIIA \u00a7207(c), 49\nU.S.C. \u00a724101 (note) (emphasis added).

See ante, at 3\u20134\n(concurring opinion). And that duty is backed up by the\nSurface Transportation Board\u2019s coercive power to impose\n\u201creasonable terms\u201d on host railroads when they fail to\ncome to an agreement with Amtrak. \u00a724308(a)(2)(A)(ii).\nPresumably, when it is \u201cpracticable\u201d to incorporate the\nmetrics and standards, the Board is better positioned to\ndeem such terms \u201creasonable\u201d and to force them upon the\nrailroads.\n   Although the Government\u2019s argument to the contrary\nwill presumably change now that the Court has held that\nAmtrak is a governmental entity, it argued before this\nCourt that Amtrak did not exercise meaningful power\nbecause other \u201cgovernmental entities had sufficient con-\ntrol over the development and adoption of the metrics and\nstandards.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 19\u201326. For support, the\nGovernment relied on two questionable precedents in\nwhich this Court held that Congress may grant private\nactors the power to determine whether a government\nregulation will go into effect: Currin v. Wallace, 306 U. S.\n1 (1939), and United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative,\nInc., 307 U. S. 533 (1939). Those precedents reason that it\ndoes not require an exercise of legislative power to decide\nwhether and when legally binding rules of private conduct\nwill go into effect. Currin, supra, at 16\u201318; Rock Royal,\nsupra, at 574\u2013577. But as I have explained above, to the\nextent that this decision involves an exercise of policy\ndiscretion, it requires an exercise of legislative power.\nSupra, at 21\u201322. In any event, these precedents are di-\nrectly contrary to our more recent holding that a discre-\ntionary \u201cveto\u201d necessarily involves an exercise of legisla-\ntive power. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S., at 952\u2013953; see\nalso id., at 987 (White, J., dissenting) (noting that the\n26 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. ASSOCIATION OF\n               AMERICAN RAILROADS\n            THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\npower Congress reserved to itself was virtually identical to\nthe power it conferred on private parties in Currin and\nRock Royal). As such, Currin and Rock Royal have been\ndiscredited and lack any force as precedents.\n   Section 207 therefore violates the Constitution. Article\nI, \u00a71, vests the legislative power in Congress, and Amtrak\nis not Congress. The procedures that \u00a7207 sets forth for\nenacting the metrics and standards also do not comply\nwith bicameralism and presentment. Art. I, \u00a77. For these\nreasons, the metrics and standards promulgated under\nthis provision are invalid.\n                              2\n   I recognize, of course, that the courts below will be\nbound to apply our \u201cintelligible principle\u201d test. I recog-\nnize, too, that that test means so little that the courts are\nlikely to conclude that \u00a7207 calls for nothing more than\nthe exercise of executive power. Having made that deter-\nmination, the Court of Appeals must then determine\nwhether Amtrak is constitutionally eligible to exercise\nexecutive power.\n   As noted, Article II of the Constitution vests the execu-\ntive power in a \u201cPresident of the United States of Amer-\nica.\u201d Art. II, \u00a71. Amtrak, of course, is not the President of\nthe United States, but this fact does not immediately\ndisqualify it from the exercise of executive power. Con-\ngress may authorize subordinates of the President to\nexercise such power, so long as they remain subject to\nPresidential control.\n   The critical question, then, is whether Amtrak is ade-\nquately subject to Presidential control. See Myers, 272\nU. S., at 117. Our precedents treat appointment and\nremoval powers as the primary devices of executive con-\ntrol, Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U. S., at 492, and that\nshould be the starting point of the Court of Appeals\u2019 anal-\nysis.   As JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concurrence demonstrates,\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          27\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nhowever, there are other constitutional requirements that\nthe Court of Appeals should also scrutinize in deciding\nwhether Amtrak is constitutionally eligible to exercise the\npower \u00a7207 confers on it.\n                        *     *    *\n   In this case, Congress has permitted a corporation\nsubject only to limited control by the President to create\nlegally binding rules. These rules give content to private\nrailroads\u2019 statutory duty to share their private infrastruc-\nture with Amtrak. This arrangement raises serious con-\nstitutional questions to which the majority\u2019s holding that\nAmtrak is a governmental entity is all but a non sequitur.\nThese concerns merit close consideration by the courts\nbelow and by this Court if the case reaches us again. We\nhave too long abrogated our duty to enforce the separation\nof powers required by our Constitution. We have overseen\nand sanctioned the growth of an administrative system\nthat concentrates the power to make laws and the power\nto enforce them in the hands of a vast and unaccountable\nadministrative apparatus that finds no comfortable home\nin our constitutional structure. The end result may be\ntrains that run on time (although I doubt it), but the\ncost is to our Constitution and the individual liberty it\nprotects.\n</pre>",
