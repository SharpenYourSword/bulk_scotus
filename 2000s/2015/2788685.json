HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.,\n DBA SEALTITE BUILDING FASTENERS ET AL., ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 13\u2013352.      Argued December 2, 2014\u2014Decided March 24, 2015\nRespondent Hargis Industries, Inc. (Hargis), tried to register its trade-\n  mark for SEALTITE with the United States Patent and Trademark\n  Office pursuant to the Lanham Act. Petitioner, B&B Hardware, Inc.\n  (B&B), however, opposed registration, claiming that SEALTITE is\n  too similar to B&B\u2019s own SEALTIGHT trademark. The Trademark\n  Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) concluded that SEALTITE should\n  not be registered because of the likelihood of confusion. Hargis did\n  not seek judicial review of that decision.\n     Later, in an infringement suit before the District Court, B&B ar-\n  gued that Hargis was precluded from contesting the likelihood of con-\n  fusion because of the TTAB\u2019s decision. The District Court disagreed.\n  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that preclusion was unwarrant-\n  ed because the TTAB and the court used different factors to evaluate\n  likelihood of confusion, the TTAB placed too much emphasis on the\n  appearance and sound of the two marks, and Hargis bore the burden\n  of persuasion before the TTAB while B&B bore it before the District\n  Court.\nHeld: So long as the other ordinary elements of issue preclusion are\n  met, when the usages adjudicated by the TTAB are materially the\n  same as those before a district court, issue preclusion should apply.\n  Pp. 8\u201322.\n     (a) An agency decision can ground issue preclusion. The Court\u2019s\n  cases establish that when Congress authorizes agencies to resolve\n  disputes, \u201ccourts may take it as given that Congress has legislated\n  with the expectation that [issue preclusion] will apply except when a\n  statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.\u201d Astoria Fed. Sav. &\n  Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108. Constitutional avoidance\n2        B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    does not compel a different conclusion. Pp. 8\u201312.\n        (b) Neither the Lanham Act\u2019s text nor its structure rebuts the\n    \u201cpresumption\u201d in favor of giving preclusive effect to TTAB decisions\n    where the ordinary elements of issue preclusion are met. Astoria,\n    501 U. S., at 108. This case is unlike Astoria. There, where exhaust-\n    ing the administrative process was a prerequisite to suit in court, giv-\n    ing preclusive effect to the agency\u2019s determination in that very ad-\n    ministrative process could have rendered the judicial suit \u201cstrictly\n    pro forma.\u201d Id., at 111. By contrast, registration involves a separate\n    proceeding to decide separate rights. Pp. 12\u201314.\n       (c) There is no categorical reason why registration decisions can\n    never meet the ordinary elements of issue preclusion. That many\n    registrations will not satisfy those ordinary elements does not mean\n    that none will. Pp. 15\u201322.\n          (1) Contrary to the Eighth Circuit\u2019s conclusion, the same likeli-\n    hood-of-confusion standard applies to both registration and infringe-\n    ment. The factors that the TTAB and the Eighth Circuit use to as-\n    sess likelihood of confusion are not fundamentally different, and,\n    more important, the operative language of each statute is essentially\n    the same.\n       Hargis claims that the standards are different, noting that the reg-\n    istration provision asks whether the marks \u201cresemble\u201d each other, 15\n    U. S. C. \u00a71052(d), while the infringement provision is directed to-\n    wards the \u201cuse in commerce\u201d of the marks, \u00a71114(1). That the TTAB\n    and a district court do not always consider the same usages, however,\n    does not mean that the TTAB applies a different standard to the us-\n    ages it does consider. If a mark owner uses its mark in materially\n    the same ways as the usages included in its registration application,\n    then the TTAB is deciding the same likelihood-of-confusion issue as a\n    district court in infringement litigation. For a similar reason, the\n    Eighth Circuit erred in holding that issue preclusion could not apply\n    because the TTAB relied too heavily on \u201cappearance and sound.\u201d\n    Pp. 15\u201319.\n          (2) The fact that the TTAB and district courts use different pro-\n    cedures suggests only that sometimes issue preclusion might be in-\n    appropriate, not that it always is. Here, there is no categorical \u201crea-\n    son to doubt the quality, extensiveness, or fairness,\u201d Montana v.\n    United States, 440 U. S. 147, 164, n. 11, of the agency\u2019s procedures.\n    In large part they are exactly the same as in federal court. Also con-\n    trary to the Eighth Circuit\u2019s conclusion, B&B, the party opposing reg-\n    istration, not Hargis, bore the burden of persuasion before the TTAB,\n    just as it did in the infringement suit. Pp. 19\u201321.\n          (3) Hargis is also wrong that the stakes for registration are al-\n    ways too low for issue preclusion in later infringement litigation.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  When registration is opposed, there is good reason to think that both\n  sides will take the matter seriously. Congress\u2019 creation of an elabo-\n  rate registration scheme, with many important rights attached and\n  backed up by plenary review, confirms that registration decisions can\n  be weighty enough to ground issue preclusion.

HARGIS \n\n    INDUSTRIES, INC., DBA SEALTITE BUILDING \n\n         FASTENERS, DBA EAST TEXAS \n\n               FASTENERS ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 24, 2015]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Sometimes two different tribunals are asked to decide\nthe same issue. When that happens, the decision of the\nfirst tribunal usually must be followed by the second, at\nleast if the issue is really the same. Allowing the same\nissue to be decided more than once wastes litigants\u2019 re-\nsources and adjudicators\u2019 time, and it encourages parties\nwho lose before one tribunal to shop around for another.\nThe doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion is\ndesigned to prevent this from occurring.\n   This case concerns the application of issue preclusion in\nthe context of trademark law. Petitioner, B&B Hardware,\nInc. (B&B), and respondent Hargis Industries, Inc. (Har-\ngis), both use similar trademarks; B&B owns SEALTIGHT\nwhile Hargis owns SEALTITE. Under the Lanham Act,\n60 Stat. 427, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71051 et seq., an\napplicant can seek to register a trademark through an\nadministrative process within the United States Patent\nand Trademark Office (PTO). But if another party be-\n2      B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlieves that the PTO should not register a mark because it\nis too similar to its own, that party can oppose registration\nbefore the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB).\nHere, Hargis tried to register the mark SEALTITE, but\nB&B opposed SEALTITE\u2019s registration. After a lengthy\nproceeding, the TTAB agreed with B&B that SEALTITE\nshould not be registered.\n   In addition to permitting a party to object to the regis-\ntration of a mark, the Lanham Act allows a mark owner to\nsue for trademark infringement. Both a registration\nproceeding and a suit for trademark infringement, more-\nover, can occur at the same time. In this case, while the\nTTAB was deciding whether SEALTITE should be regis-\ntered, B&B and Hargis were also litigating the\nSEALTIGHT versus SEALTITE dispute in federal court.\nIn both registration proceedings and infringement litiga-\ntion, the tribunal asks whether a likelihood of confusion\nexists between the mark sought to be protected (here,\nSEALTIGHT) and the other mark (SEALTITE).\n   The question before this Court is whether the District\nCourt in this case should have applied issue preclusion to\nthe TTAB\u2019s decision that SEALTITE is confusingly similar\nto SEALTIGHT. Here, the Eighth Circuit rejected issue\npreclusion for reasons that would make it difficult for the\ndoctrine ever to apply in trademark disputes. We disagree\nwith that narrow understanding of issue preclusion.\nInstead, consistent with principles of law that apply in\ninnumerable contexts, we hold that a court should give\npreclusive effect to TTAB decisions if the ordinary ele-\nments of issue preclusion are met. We therefore reverse\nthe judgment of the Eighth Circuit and remand for further\nproceedings.\n                             I\n                            A\n    Trademark law has a long history, going back at least to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRoman times. See Restatement (Third) of Unfair Compe-\ntition \u00a79, Comment b (1993). The principle underlying\ntrademark protection is that distinctive marks\u2014words,\nnames, symbols, and the like\u2014can help distinguish a\nparticular artisan\u2019s goods from those of others. Ibid. One\nwho first uses a distinct mark in commerce thus acquires\nrights to that mark. See 2 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and\nUnfair Competition \u00a716:1 (4th ed. 2014) (hereinafter\nMcCarthy). Those rights include preventing others from\nusing the mark. See 1 A. LaLonde, Gilson on Trademarks\n\u00a73.02[8] (2014) (hereinafter Gilson).\n   Though federal law does not create trademarks, see,\ne.g., Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 92 (1879), Congress\nhas long played a role in protecting them. In 1946, Con-\ngress enacted the Lanham Act, the current federal trade-\nmark scheme. As relevant here, the Lanham Act creates\nat least two adjudicative mechanisms to help protect\nmarks. First, a trademark owner can register its mark\nwith the PTO. Second, a mark owner can bring a suit for\ninfringement in federal court.\n   Registration is significant. The Lanham Act confers\n\u201cimportant legal rights and benefits\u201d on trademark owners\nwho register their marks. 3 McCarthy \u00a719:3, at 19\u201321 see\nalso id., \u00a719:9, at 19\u201334 (listing seven of the \u201cprocedural\nand substantive legal advantages\u201d of registration). Regis-\ntration, for instance, serves as \u201cconstructive notice of the\nregistrant\u2019s claim of ownership\u201d of the mark. 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71072. It also is \u201cprima facie evidence of the validity of\nthe registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of\nthe owner\u2019s ownership of the mark, and of the owner\u2019s\nexclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce on\nor in connection with the goods or services specified in the\ncertificate.\u201d \u00a71057(b). And once a mark has been regis-\ntered for five years, it can become \u201cincontestable.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71065,\n1115(b)\n   To obtain the benefits of registration, a mark owner files\n4     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nan application with the PTO. \u00a71051. The application\nmust include, among other things, \u201cthe date of the appli-\ncant\u2019s first use of the mark, the date of the applicant\u2019s first\nuse of the mark in commerce, the goods in connection with\nwhich the mark is used, and a drawing of the mark.\u201d\n\u00a71051(a)(2). The usages listed in the application\u2014i.e.,\nthose goods on which the mark appears along with, if\napplicable, their channels of distribution\u2014are critical.\nSee, e.g., 3 McCarthy \u00a720:24, at 20\u201383 (\u201c[T]he applicant\u2019s\nright to register must be made on the basis of the goods\ndescribed in the application\u201d); id., \u00a720:15, at 20\u201385 (ex-\nplaining that if an \u201capplication does not delimit any spe-\ncific trade channels of distribution, no limitation will be\u201d\napplied). The PTO generally cannot register a mark which\n\u201cso resembles\u201d another mark \u201cas to be likely, when used on\nor in connection with the goods of the applicant, to cause\nconfusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71052(d).\n   If a trademark examiner believes that registration is\nwarranted, the mark is published in the Official Gazette of\nthe PTO. \u00a71062. At that point, \u201c[a]ny person who believes\nthat he would be damaged by the registration\u201d may \u201cfile\nan opposition.\u201d \u00a71063(a). Opposition proceedings occur\nbefore the TTAB (or panels thereof). \u00a71067(a). The TTAB\nconsists of administrative trademark judges and high-\nranking PTO officials, including the Director of the PTO\nand the Commissioner of Trademarks. \u00a71067(b).\n   Opposition proceedings before the TTAB are in many\nways \u201csimilar to a civil action in a federal district court.\u201d\nTTAB Manual of Procedure \u00a7102.03 (2014) (hereinafter\nTTAB Manual), online at http://www.uspto.gov (as visited\nMar. 20, 2015, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\nThese proceedings, for instance, are largely governed by\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Evidence. See 37\nCFR \u00a7\u00a72.116(a), 2.122(a) (2014). The TTAB also allows\ndiscovery and depositions. See \u00a7\u00a72.120, 2.123(a). The\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nparty opposing registration bears the burden of proof, see\n\u00a72.116(b), and if that burden cannot be met, the opposed\nmark must be registered, see 15 U. S. C. \u00a71063(b).\n  The primary way in which TTAB proceedings differ from\nordinary civil litigation is that \u201cproceedings before the\nBoard are conducted in writing, and the Board\u2019s actions in\na particular case are based upon the written record therein.\u201d\nTTAB Manual \u00a7102.03. In other words, there is no live\ntestimony. Even so, the TTAB allows parties to submit\ntranscribed testimony, taken under oath and subject to\ncross-examination, and to request oral argument. See 37\nCFR \u00a7\u00a72.123, 2.129.\n  When a party opposes registration because it believes\nthe mark proposed to be registered is too similar to its\nown, the TTAB evaluates likelihood of confusion by apply-\ning some or all of the 13 factors set out in In re E. I.\nDuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F. 2d 1357 (CCPA 1973).\nAfter the TTAB decides whether to register the mark, a\nparty can seek review in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit, or it can file a new action in district court.\nSee 15 U. S. C. \u00a71071. In district court, the parties can\nconduct additional discovery and the judge resolves regis-\ntration de novo. \u00a71071(b); see also 3 McCarthy \u00a721:20\n(explaining differences between the forums); cf. Kappos v.\nHyatt, 566 U. S. ___ (2012) (de novo review for analogous\nscheme in patent law).\n  The Lanham Act, of course, also creates a federal cause\nof action for trademark infringement. The owner of a\nmark, whether registered or not, can bring suit in federal\ncourt if another is using a mark that too closely resembles\nthe plaintiff \u2019s. The court must decide whether the de-\nfendant\u2019s use of a mark in commerce \u201cis likely to cause\nconfusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\u201d with regards\nto the plaintiff \u2019s mark. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71114(1)(a) (regis-\ntered marks); \u00a71125(a)(1)(A) (unregistered marks). In\ninfringement litigation, the district court considers the full\n6     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrange of a mark\u2019s usages, not just those in the application.\n                               B\n  Petitioner B&B and respondent Hargis both manufac-\nture metal fasteners. B&B manufactures fasteners for the\naerospace industry, while Hargis manufactures fasteners\nfor use in the construction trade. Although there are\nobvious differences between space shuttles and A-frame\nbuildings, both aerospace and construction engineers\nprefer fasteners that seal things tightly. Accordingly, both\nB&B and Hargis want their wares associated with tight\nseals. A feud of nearly two decades has sprung from this\nseemingly commonplace set of facts.\n  In 1993 B&B registered SEALTIGHT for \u201cthreaded or\nunthreaded metal fasteners and other related hardwar[e];\nnamely, self-sealing nuts, bolts, screws, rivets and wash-\ners, all having a captive o-ring, for use in the aerospace\nindustry.\u201d App. 223a (capitalization omitted). In 1996,\nHargis sought to register SEALTITE for \u201cself-piercing and\nself-drilling metal screws for use in the manufacture of\nmetal and post-frame buildings.\u201d App. 70a (capitalization\nomitted). B&B opposed Hargis\u2019 registration because,\nalthough the two companies sell different products, it\nbelieves that SEALTITE is confusingly similar to\nSEALTIGHT.\n  The twists and turns in the SEALTIGHT versus\nSEALTITE controversy are labyrinthine. The question\nwhether either of these marks should be registered, and if\nso, which one, has bounced around within the PTO for\nabout two decades; related infringement litigation has\nbeen before the Eighth Circuit three times; and two sepa-\nrate juries have been empaneled and returned verdicts.\nThe full story could fill a long, unhappy book.\n  For purposes here, we pick up the story in 2002, when\nthe PTO published SEALTITE in the Official Gazette.\nThis prompted opposition proceedings before the TTAB,\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncomplete with discovery, including depositions. B&B ar-\ngued that SEALTITE could not be registered because it\nis confusingly similar to SEALTIGHT. B&B explained, for\ninstance, that both companies have an online presence,\nthe largest distributor of fasteners sells both companies\u2019\nproducts, and consumers sometimes call the wrong com-\npany to place orders. Hargis rejoined that the companies\nsell different products, for different uses, to different types\nof consumers, through different channels of trade.\n   Invoking a number of the DuPont factors, the TTAB\nsided with B&B. The Board considered, for instance,\nwhether SEALTIGHT is famous (it\u2019s not, said the Board),\nhow the two products are used (differently), how much the\nmarks resemble each other (very much), and whether\ncustomers are actually confused (perhaps sometimes). See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 55a\u201371a. Concluding that \u201cthe most\ncritical factors in [its] likelihood of confusion analysis are\nthe similarities of the marks and the similarity of the\ngoods,\u201d id., at 70a, the TTAB determined that\nSEALTITE\u2014when \u201cused in connection with \u2018self-piercing\nand self-drilling metal screws for use in the manufacture\nof metal and post-frame buildings\u2019 \u201d\u2014could not be regis-\ntered because it \u201cso resembles\u201d SEALTIGHT when \u201cused\nin connection with fasteners that provide leakproof protec-\ntion from liquids and gases, fasteners that have a captive\no-ring, and \u2018threaded or unthreaded metal fastners and\nother related hardware . . . for use in the aerospace indus-\ntry\u2019 as to be likely to cause confusion,\u201d id., at 71a. Despite\na right to do so, Hargis did not seek judicial review in\neither the Federal Circuit or District Court.\n   All the while, B&B had sued Hargis for infringement.\nBefore the District Court ruled on likelihood of confusion,\nhowever, the TTAB announced its decision. After a series\nof proceedings not relevant here, B&B argued to the Dis-\ntrict Court that Hargis could not contest likelihood of\nconfusion because of the preclusive effect of the TTAB\n8     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v.

The jury returned a\nverdict for Hargis, finding no likelihood of confusion.\n  B&B appealed to the Eighth Circuit. Though accepting\nfor the sake of argument that agency decisions can ground\nissue preclusion, the panel majority affirmed for three\nreasons: first, because the TTAB uses different factors\nthan the Eighth Circuit to evaluate likelihood of confusion;\nsecond, because the TTAB placed too much emphasis on\nthe appearance and sound of the two marks; and third,\nbecause Hargis bore the burden of persuasion before the\nTTAB, while B&B bore it before the District Court. 716\nF. 3d 1020 (2013).

S. ___ (2014).\n                              II\n  The first question that we must address is whether an\nagency decision can ever ground issue preclusion. The\nDistrict Court rejected issue preclusion because agencies\nare not Article III courts. The Eighth Circuit did not\nadopt that view, and, given this Court\u2019s cases, it was right\nto take that course.\n  This Court has long recognized that \u201cthe determination\nof a question directly involved in one action is conclusive\nas to that question in a second suit.\u201d Cromwell v. County\nof Sac, 94 U. S. 351, 354 (1877). The idea is straightfor-\nward: Once a court has decided an issue, it is \u201cforever\nsettled as between the parties,\u201d Baldwin v.

S. 104,\n107 (1991).\n   Although the idea of issue preclusion is straightforward,\nit can be challenging to implement. The Court, therefore,\nregularly turns to the Restatement (Second) of Judgments\nfor a statement of the ordinary elements of issue preclu-\nsion. See, e.g., Bobby v. Bies, 556 U. S. 825, 834 (2009);\nNew Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U. S. 742, 748\u2013749 (2001);\nBaker v. General Motors Corp., 522 U. S. 222, 233, n. 5\n(1998). The Restatement explains that subject to certain\nwell-known exceptions, the general rule is that \u201c[w]hen an\nissue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by\na valid and final judgment, and the determination is\nessential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive\nin a subsequent action between the parties, whether on\nthe same or a different claim.\u201d Restatement (Second) of\nJudgments \u00a727, p. 250 (1980); see also id., \u00a728, at 273\n(listing exceptions such as whether appellate review was\navailable or whether there were \u201cdifferences in the quality\nor extensiveness of the procedures followed\u201d).\n   Both this Court\u2019s cases and the Restatement make clear\nthat issue preclusion is not limited to those situations in\nwhich the same issue is before two courts. Rather, where\na single issue is before a court and an administrative\nagency, preclusion also often applies. Indeed, this Court\nhas explained that because the principle of issue preclu-\nsion was so \u201cwell established\u201d at common law, in those\nsituations in which Congress has authorized agencies to\nresolve disputes, \u201ccourts may take it as given that Con-\ngress has legislated with the expectation that the principle\n[of issue preclusion] will apply except when a statutory\npurpose to the contrary is evident.\u201d Astoria, supra, at 108.\nThis reflects the Court\u2019s longstanding view that \u201c \u2018[w]hen\nan administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity\nand resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it\n10     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich the parties have had an adequate opportunity to\nlitigate, the courts have not hesitated to apply res judicata\nto enforce repose.\u2019 \u201d University of Tenn. v. Elliott, 478 U. S.\n788, 797\u2013798 (1986) (quoting United States v. Utah\nConstr. & Mining Co., 384 U. S. 394, 422 (1966)); see also\nHayfield Northern R. Co. v. Chicago & North Western\nTransp.

Otherwise, Hargis warns,\nthe Court would have to confront \u201c \u2018grave and doubtful\nquestions\u2019 as to the Lanham Act\u2019s consistency with the\nSeventh Amendment and Article III of the Constitution.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 38 (quoting United States ex rel.\nAttorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S.\n366, 408 (1909)). We are not persuaded.\n   At the outset, we note that Hargis does not argue that\ngiving issue preclusive effect to the TTAB\u2019s decision would\nbe unconstitutional. Instead, Hargis contends only that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See Brief for Respondent 28 (acknowledging that administrative\n\n\u201c[p]reclusion\u2019s status as part of the common-law backdrop means that\ncourts may presume its application\u201d absent contrary indication from\nCongress) (citing Astoria 501 U.

S. ____ (2015)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe should read the Lanham Act narrowly because a broad\nreading might be unconstitutional. See, e.g., Brief for\nRespondent 37, 39, 40, 41\u201342. The likely reason that\nHargis has not directly advanced a constitutional argu-\nment is that, at least as to a jury trial right, Hargis did not\neven list the Seventh Amendment as an authority in its\nappellee brief to the Eighth Circuit. Moreover, although\nHargis pressed an Article III argument below, in its oppo-\nsition to certiorari in this Court, Hargis seemingly con-\nceded that TTAB decisions can sometimes ground issue\npreclusion, though it now protests otherwise.               See\nSupplemental Brief in Opposition 2. To the extent, if any,\nthat there could be a meritorious constitutional objection,\nit is not before us. See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.,\n514 U. S. 211, 231\u2013232 (1995).\n   We reject Hargis\u2019 statutory argument that we should\njettison administrative preclusion in whole or in part to\navoid potential constitutional concerns. As to the Seventh\nAmendment, for instance, the Court has already held that\nthe right to a jury trial does not negate the issue-\npreclusive effect of a judgment, even if that judgment was\nentered by a juryless tribunal. See Parklane Hosiery Co.\nv. Shore, 439 U. S. 322, 337 (1979). It would seem to\nfollow naturally that although the Seventh Amendment\ncreates a jury trial right in suits for trademark damages,\nsee Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U. S. 469, 477, 479\u2013480\n(1962), TTAB decisions still can have preclusive effect in\nsuch suits. Hargis disputes this reasoning even though it\nadmits that in 1791 \u201c \u2018a party was not entitled to have a\njury determine issues that had been previously adjudi-\ncated by a chancellor in equity.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 39\n(quoting Parklane Hosiery, supra, at 333). Instead, Hargis\ncontends that issue preclusion should not apply to TTAB\nregistration decisions because there were no agencies at\ncommon law. But our precedent holds that the Seventh\nAmendment does not strip competent tribunals of the\n12    B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\npower to issue judgments with preclusive effect; that logic\nwould not seem to turn on the nature of the competent\ntribunal. And at the same time, adopting Hargis\u2019 view\nwould dramatically undercut agency preclusion, despite\nwhat the Court has already said to the contrary. Nothing\nin Hargis\u2019 avoidance argument is weighty enough to over-\ncome these weaknesses.\n   The claim that we should read the Lanham Act narrowly\nto avoid Article III concerns is equally unavailing\u2014and\nfor similar reasons. Hargis argues that because it might\nviolate Article III if an agency could make a decision with\npreclusive effect in a later proceeding before a federal\ncourt, we should conclude, as a statutory matter, that\nissue preclusion is unavailable. Such a holding would not\nfit with our precedent. For instance, in Elliott, the Court,\nrelying on Utah Construction, explained that absent a\ncontrary indication, Congress presumptively intends that\nan agency\u2019s determination (there, a state agency) has\npreclusive effect. 478 U. S., at 796\u2013799; see also Astoria,\n501 U. S., at 110 (recognizing the \u201cpresumption\u201d). To be\nsure, the Court has never addressed whether such preclu-\nsion offends Article III. But because this Court\u2019s cases are\nso clear, there is no ambiguity for this Court to sidestep\nthrough constitutional avoidance.2\n                          III\n  The next question is whether there is an \u201cevident\u201d rea-\nson why Congress would not want TTAB decisions to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Our dissenting colleagues argue that Utah Construction\u2019s conclu-\n\nsion that courts \u201chave not hesitated\u201d to apply administrative preclu-\nsion, 384 U. S., at 422, was mistaken and certainly should not be\napplied to statutes\u2014such as the Lanham Act\u2014enacted prior to 1966.\nWe do not decide who reads the history better. The Court has repeat-\nedly endorsed Utah Construction and, importantly, neither party chal-\nlenges its historical accuracy. For the same reason, we do not decide\nwhether such preclusion is unconstitutional because the issue is not\nbefore us.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreceive preclusive effect, even in those cases in which the\nordinary elements of issue preclusion are met. Astoria,\nsupra, at 108. We conclude that nothing in the Lanham\nAct bars the application of issue preclusion in such cases.\n   The Lanham Act\u2019s text certainly does not forbid issue\npreclusion. Nor does the Act\u2019s structure. Granted, one\ncan seek judicial review of a TTAB registration decision in\na de novo district court action, and some courts have con-\ncluded from this that Congress does not want unreviewed\nTTAB decisions to ground issue preclusion. See, e.g.,\nAmerican Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Heritage Life Ins. Co.,\n494 F. 2d 3, 9\u201310 (CA5 1974). But that conclusion does\nnot follow. Ordinary preclusion law teaches that if a party\nto a court proceeding does not challenge an adverse deci-\nsion, that decision can have preclusive effect in other\ncases, even if it would have been reviewed de novo. See\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a728, Comment a and\nIllustration 1 (explaining that the failure to pursue an\nappeal does not undermine issue preclusion and including\nan example of an apparently unappealed district court\u2019s\ndismissal for failure to state a claim); cf. Federated De-\npartment Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U. S. 394, 398 (1981)\n(noting \u201cthe res judicata consequences of a final, unap-\npealed judgment on the merits\u201d).\n   This case is also unlike Astoria, where a plaintiff claim-\ning discrimination first went to an agency and then sued\nin court about the same alleged conduct. See 501 U. S., at\n111. The Court concluded, quite sensibly, that the struc-\nture of that scheme indicated that the agency decision\ncould not ground issue preclusion. When exhausting an\nadministrative process is a prerequisite to suit in court,\ngiving preclusive effect to the agency\u2019s determination in\nthat very administrative process could render the judicial\nsuit \u201cstrictly pro forma.\u201d Ibid.; see also Elliott, supra, at\n795\u2013796 (similar analysis). Here, if a party urged a dis-\ntrict court reviewing a TTAB registration decision to give\n14    B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npreclusive effect to the very TTAB decision under review,\nAstoria would apply. But that is not this case.\n   What matters here is that registration is not a prerequi-\nsite to an infringement action. Rather, it is a separate\nproceeding to decide separate rights. Neither is issue\npreclusion a one-way street. When a district court, as part\nof its judgment, decides an issue that overlaps with part of\nthe TTAB\u2019s analysis, the TTAB gives preclusive effect to\nthe court\u2019s judgment. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a\u2013\n55a (giving preclusive effect to the District Court\u2019s ear-\nlier decision regarding SEALTIGHT\u2019s distinctiveness be-\ncause the issue \u201cwas actually litigated and necessarily\ndetermined\u201d).\n   Hargis also argues that allowing TTAB decisions to\nhave issue-preclusive effect will adversely affect the regis-\ntration process. Because of the TTAB\u2019s \u201c \u2018limited jurisdic-\ntion\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018the narrowness of the issues\u2019 \u201d before it, Hargis\ncontends, the Court should infer that TTAB proceedings\nare supposed to be more streamlined than infringement\nlitigation. See Brief for Respondent 30 (quoting TTAB\nManual \u00a7402.01). But, the argument goes, if TTAB deci-\nsions can have issue-preclusive effect in infringement\nlitigation, parties may spend more time and energy before\nthe TTAB, thus bogging down the registration process.\nThis concern does not change our conclusion. Issue pre-\nclusion is available unless it is \u201cevident,\u201d Astoria, supra, at\n108, that Congress does not want it. Here, if a stream-\nlined process in all registration matters was particularly\ndear to Congress, it would not have authorized de novo\nchallenges for those \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with TTAB decisions.\n15 U. S. C. \u00a71071(b). Plenary review serves many func-\ntions, but ensuring a streamlined process is not one of\nthem. Moreover, as explained below, for a great many\nregistration decisions issue preclusion obviously will not\napply because the ordinary elements will not be met. For\nthose registrations, nothing we say today is relevant.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               IV \n\n  At last we turn to whether there is a categorical reason\nwhy registration decisions can never meet the ordinary\nelements of issue preclusion, e.g., those elements set out in\n\u00a727 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments. Although\nmany registrations will not satisfy those ordinary ele-\nments, that does not mean that none will. We agree with\nProfessor McCarthy that issue preclusion applies where\n\u201cthe issues in the two cases are indeed identical and the\nother rules of collateral estoppel are carefully observed.\u201d 6\nMcCarthy \u00a732:99, at 32\u2013244; see also 3 Gilson\n\u00a711.08[4][i][iii][B], p. 11\u2013319 (\u201cUltimately, Board decisions\non likelihood of confusion . . . should be given preclusive\neffect on a case-by-case basis\u201d).\n                              A\n   The Eighth Circuit\u2019s primary objection to issue preclu-\nsion was that the TTAB considers different factors than it\ndoes. Whereas the TTAB employs some or all of the\nDuPont factors to assess likelihood of confusion, the\nEighth Circuit looks to similar, but not identical, factors\nidentified in SquirtCo v. Seven-Up Co., 628 F. 2d 1086,\n1091 (CA8 1980).        The court\u2019s instinct was sound:\n\u201c[I]ssues are not identical if the second action involves\napplication of a different legal standard, even though the\nfactual setting of both suits may be the same.\u201d 18 C.\nWright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice & Proce-\ndure \u00a74417, p. 449 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright &\nMiller). Here, however, the same likelihood-of-confusion\nstandard applies to both registration and infringement.\n   To begin with, it does not matter that registration and\ninfringement are governed by different statutory provi-\nsions. Often a single standard is placed in different stat-\nutes; that does not foreclose issue preclusion. See, e.g.,\nSmith v. Bayer Corp., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n7). Neither does it matter that the TTAB and the Eighth\n16      B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit use different factors to assess likelihood of confu-\nsion. For one thing, the factors are not fundamentally\ndifferent, and \u201c[m]inor variations in the application of\nwhat is in essence the same legal standard do not defeat\npreclusion.\u201d Id., at ___, n. 9 (slip op., at 12, n. 9). More\nimportant, if federal law provides a single standard, par-\nties cannot escape preclusion simply by litigating anew in\ntribunals that apply that one standard differently. A\ncontrary rule would encourage the very evils that issue\npreclusion helps to prevent.\n   The real question, therefore, is whether likelihood of\nconfusion for purposes of registration is the same standard\nas likelihood of confusion for purposes of infringement.\nWe conclude it is, for at least three reasons. First, the\noperative language is essentially the same; the fact that\nthe registration provision separates \u201clikely\u201d from \u201cto cause\nconfusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\u201d does not\nchange that reality.3 See 2 Gilson \u00a75.01[2][a], at 5\u201317\n(explaining that \u201cthe same statutory test\u201d applies). Sec-\nond, the likelihood-of-confusion language that Congress\nused in these Lanham Act provisions has been central to\ntrademark registration since at least 1881. See Act of\nMar. 3, 1881, ch. 138, \u00a73, 21 Stat. 503 (using a \u201clikely to\ncause confusion\u201d standard for registration). That could\nhardly have been by accident. And third, district courts\ncan cancel registrations during infringement litigation,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Compare     15 U. S.

C.\n\u00a71119; 3 McCarthy \u00a721:20. There is no reason to think\nthat the same district judge in the same case should apply\ntwo separate standards of likelihood of confusion.\n   Hargis responds that the text is not actually the same\nbecause the registration provision asks whether the marks\n\u201cresemble\u201d each other, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(d), while the\ninfringement provision is directed towards the \u201cuse in\ncommerce\u201d of the marks, \u00a71114(1). Indeed, according to\nHargis, the distinction between \u201cresembl[ance]\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d\nhas been key to trademark law for over a century. There\nis some force to this argument. It is true that \u201ca party\nopposing an application to register a mark before the\nBoard often relies only on its federal registration, not on\nany common-law rights in usages not encompassed by its\nregistration,\u201d and \u201cthe Board typically analyzes the marks,\ngoods, and channels of trade only as set forth in the appli-\ncation and in the opposer\u2019s registration, regardless of\nwhether the actual usage of the marks by either party\ndiffers.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23; see\nalso id., at 5 (explaining that \u201cthe Board typically reviews\nonly the usages encompassed by the registration\u201d) (citing 3\nGilson \u00a79.03[2][a][ii]); 3 McCarthy \u00a720:15, at 20\u201345 (ex-\nplaining that for registration \u201cit is the mark as shown in\nthe application and as used on the goods described in the\napplication which must be considered, not the mark as\nactually used\u201d). This means that unlike in infringement\nlitigation, \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s determination that a likelihood of\nconfusion does or does not exist will not resolve the confu-\nsion issue with respect to non-disclosed usages.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 23.\n   Hargis\u2019 argument falls short, however, because it mis-\ntakes a reason not to apply issue preclusion in some or\neven many cases as a reason never to apply issue preclu-\nsion. Just because the TTAB does not always consider the\n18     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsame usages as a district court does, it does not follow that\nthe Board applies a different standard to the usages it\ndoes consider.4 If a mark owner uses its mark in ways\nthat are materially the same as the usages included in its\nregistration application, then the TTAB is deciding the\nsame likelihood-of-confusion issue as a district court in\ninfringement litigation. By contrast, if a mark owner uses\nits mark in ways that are materially unlike the usages in\nits application, then the TTAB is not deciding the same\nissue. Thus, if the TTAB does not consider the market-\nplace usage of the parties\u2019 marks, the TTAB\u2019s decision\nshould \u201chave no later preclusive effect in a suit where\nactual usage in the marketplace is the paramount issue.\u201d\n6 McCarthy \u00a732:101, at 32\u2013246.\n   Materiality, of course, is essential\u2014trivial variations\nbetween the usages set out in an application and the use\nof a mark in the marketplace do not create different \u201cis-\nsues,\u201d just as trivial variations do not create different\n\u201cmarks.\u201d See generally 4 id., \u00a723:50, at 23\u2013265 (explain-\ning that \u201cadding descriptive or non-distinctive\u201d elements\nto another\u2019s mark generally will not negate confusion).\nOtherwise, a party could escape the preclusive effect of an\nadverse judgment simply by adding an immaterial feature\nto its mark. That is not the law.

Needless to say,\nmoreover, if the TTAB has not decided the same issue as\nthat before the district court, there is no reason why any\ndeference would be warranted.\n  For a similar reason, the Eighth Circuit erred in holding\nthat issue preclusion could not apply here because the\nTTAB relied too heavily on \u201cappearance and sound.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 10a. Undoubtedly there are cases in\nwhich the TTAB places more weight on certain factors\nthan it should. When that happens, an aggrieved party\nshould seek judicial review. The fact that the TTAB may\nhave erred, however, does not prevent preclusion. As\nJudge Colloton observed in dissent, \u201c \u2018issue preclusion\nprevent[s] relitigation of wrong decisions just as much as\nright ones.\u2019 \u201d 716 F. 3d, at 1029 (quoting Clark v.

S., at 164, n. 11; see also Parklane Hosiery, 439 U. S.,\nat 331, and n. 15 (similar). But again, this only suggests\nthat sometimes issue preclusion might be inappropriate,\nnot that it always is.\n   No one disputes that the TTAB and district courts use\ndifferent procedures. Most notably, district courts feature\n20    B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlive witnesses. Procedural differences, by themselves,\nhowever, do not defeat issue preclusion. Equity courts\nused different procedures than did law courts, but that did\nnot bar issue preclusion. See id., at 333. Nor is there\nreason to think that the state agency in Elliott used proce-\ndures identical to those in federal court; nonetheless, the\nCourt held that preclusion could apply. See 478 U. S., at\n796\u2013799. Rather than focusing on whether procedural\ndifferences exist\u2014they often will\u2014the correct inquiry is\nwhether the procedures used in the first proceeding were\nfundamentally poor, cursory, or unfair. See Montana, 440\nU. S., at 164, n. 11.\n    Here, there is no categorical \u201creason to doubt the quality,\nextensiveness, or fairness,\u201d ibid., of the agency\u2019s proce-\ndures. In large part they are exactly the same as in fed-\neral court. See 37 CFR \u00a7\u00a72.116(a), 2.122(a). For instance,\nalthough the \u201c[t]he scope of discovery in Board proceedings\n. . . . is generally narrower than in court proceedings\u201d\u2014\nreflecting the fact that there are often fewer usages at\nissue\u2014the TTAB has adopted almost the whole of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 26. TTAB Manual \u00a7402.01; see\nalso id., \u00a7401. It is conceivable, of course, that the TTAB\u2019s\nprocedures may prove ill-suited for a particular issue in a\nparticular case, e.g., a party may have tried to introduce\nmaterial evidence but was prevented by the TTAB from\ndoing so, or the TTAB\u2019s bar on live testimony may materi-\nally prejudice a party\u2019s ability to present its case. The\nordinary law of issue preclusion, however, already ac-\ncounts for those \u201crare\u201d cases where a \u201ccompelling showing\nof unfairness\u201d can be made.

Issue preclusion\nmay be inapt if \u201cthe amount in controversy in the first\naction [was] so small in relation to the amount in contro-\nversy in the second that preclusion would be plainly un-\nfair.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a728, Comment\nj, at 283\u2013284. After all, \u201c[f]ew . . . litigants would spend\n$50,000 to defend a $5,000 claim.\u201d Wright & Miller\n\u00a74423, at 612. Hargis is wrong, however, that this exception\nto issue preclusion applies to every registration. To\nthe contrary: When registration is opposed, there is\ngood reason to think that both sides will take the matter\nseriously.\n   The benefits of registration are substantial. Registra-\ntion is \u201cprima facie evidence of the validity of the regis-\ntered mark,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71057(b), and is a precondition for\na mark to become \u201cincontestable,\u201d \u00a71065. Incontestability\nis a powerful protection. See, e.g., Park \u2019N Fly, Inc. v.\nDollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985) (holding\nthat an incontestable mark cannot be challenged as merely\ndescriptive); see also id., at 193 (explaining that \u201cCon-\ngress determined that . . . \u2018trademarks should receive\nnationally the greatest protection that can be given them\u2019 \u201d\nand that \u201c[a]mong the new protections created by the\nLanham Act were the statutory provisions that allow a\nfederally registered mark to become incontestable\u201d (quot-\ning S.

That presumption was first announced in\npoorly supported dictum in a 1991 decision of this Court,\nand we have not applied it since. Whatever the validity of\nthat presumption with respect to statutes enacted after its\ncreation, there is no justification for applying it to the\nLanham Act, passed in 1946. Seeing no other reason to\nconclude that Congress implicitly authorized the decisions\nof the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) to have\npreclusive effect in a subsequent trademark infringement\nsuit, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n                           I\n\n                           A\n\n  The presumption in favor of administrative preclusion\nthe Court applies today was first announced in Astoria\nFed.

That dictum rested on two premises. First, that \u201cCon-\ngress is understood to legislate against a background of\ncommon-law adjudicatory principles.\u201d Id., at 108. And,\nsecond, that the Court had \u201clong favored application of\nthe common-law doctrines of collateral estoppel (as to\nissues) and res judicata (as to claims) to those determina-\ntions of administrative bodies that have attained finality.\u201d\nId., at 107.\n   I do not quarrel with the first premise, but I have seri-\nous doubts about the second. The Court in Astoria offered\nonly one decision predating the enactment of the ADEA to\nshore up its assertion that Congress had legislated against\na background principle in favor of administrative preclu-\nsion\u2014United States v.

The case arose out of a\ncontract dispute between the United States and a private\ncontractor. 384 U. S., at 400. The contract at issue con-\ntained a disputes clause providing for an administrative\nprocess by which \u201c \u2018disputes concerning questions of fact\narising under th[e] contract\u2019 \u201d would be decided by the\ncontracting officer, subject to written appeal to the head of\nthe department. Id., at 397\u2013398. The Wunderlich Act of\n1954 likewise provided that such administrative factfind-\ning would be \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d in a later breach-of-\ncontract action \u201c \u2018unless the same is fra[u]dulent or capri-\ncious or arbitrary or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to\nimply bad faith, or is not supported by substantial evi-\ndence.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 399. Because both \u201cthe disputes clause [of\nthe contract] and the Wunderlich Act categorically state[d]\nthat administrative findings on factual issues relevant to\nquestions arising under the contract [would] be final and\nconclusive on the parties,\u201d the Court required the lower\ncourts to accept those findings. Id., at 419. Only after\nacknowledging that its decision \u201crest[ed] upon the agree-\nment of the parties as modified by the Wunderlich Act\u201d did\nthe Court go on to comment that the decision was \u201charmo-\nnious with general principles of collateral estoppel.\u201d Id.,\nat 421.\n   To create a presumption based solely on dictum would\nbe bad enough, but the principles Utah Construction re-\nferred to were far too equivocal to constitute \u201clong-\nestablished and familiar\u201d background principles of the\ncommon law of the sort on which we base our statutory\ninferences. Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U. S. 779, 783\n(1952). Although Utah Construction asserted that \u201c[w]hen\nan administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity\nand resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it\nwhich the parties have had an adequate opportunity to\n4     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v.

S., at 421\u2013\n422. These contradictory signals are not typically the stuff\nof which background rules of common law are made. Cf.\nKirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.

West, 7 Wall. 82, 102 (1869);\naccord, Hopkins v. Lee, 6 Wheat. 109, 113 (1821); Re-\nstatement of Judgments \u00a7\u00a74, 7, and Comment f, pp. 20, 41,\n45 (1942). That rule came with the corollary requirement\nthat the court be \u201clegally constituted\u201d\u2014that is, a court\n\u201cknown to and recognized by the law.\u201d 2 H. Black, Law of\nJudgments \u00a7516, p. 614 (1891). A court not \u201clegally con-\nstituted\u201d lacked jurisdiction to enter a legally binding\njudgment, and thus any such judgment could have no\npreclusive effect. Ibid.\n  Nineteenth century courts generally understood the\nterm \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d to include all courts\nwith authority and jurisdiction conclusively to resolve a\ndispute. See J. Wells, A Treatise on the Doctrines of Res\nJudicata and Stare Decisis \u00a7\u00a7422\u2013423, pp. 336\u2013338 (1878);\n2 Black, supra, \u00a7516, at 613\u2013614.

This broad definition\nserved the interest in finality that supports preclusion\ndoctrines, without which \u201can end could never be put to\nlitigation.\u201d Id., at 114.\n   But however broadly \u201c[c]ourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d\nwas defined, it would require quite a leap to say that the\nconcept encompasses administrative agencies, which were\nrecognized as categorically different from courts. E.g.,\nPearson v. Williams, 202 U. S. 281 (1906); F. Cooper,\nAdministrative Agencies and the Courts 241\u2013242 (1951)\n(taking the position that agencies \u201care not courts, and\ntheir determinations are not judgments\u201d). This distinction\nstems from the Constitution itself, which vests the \u201cjudi-\ncial Power\u201d not in administrative agencies, but in federal\ncourts, whose independence is safeguarded by certain\nconstitutional requirements. Art. III, \u00a71. One of the\nconsequences of this allocation of judicial power is that\nagencies possess limited ability to act in a judicial capacity\nin cases resolving traditional disputes between private\nparties. See infra, at 11\u201312.\n   It is therefore unsurprising that federal courts\u2014\nincluding this Court\u2014have been far more hesitant than\ntoday\u2019s majority to extend common-law preclusion princi-\nples to decisions of administrative tribunals. In Pearson,\nfor example, this Court declined to recognize any preclu-\nsive effect of a decision of an immigration board. 202\nU. S., at 284\u2013285. Writing for the Court, Justice Holmes\nexplained that \u201c[t]he board is an instrument of the execu-\ntive power, not a court\u201d; that it consisted of officials\n\u201cwhose duties are declared to be administrative by\u201d stat-\nute; and that \u201c[d]ecisions of a similar type long have been\nrecognized as decisions of the executive department, and\ncannot constitute res judicata in a technical sense.\u201d Ibid.\n   Other courts likewise declined to apply general preclu-\nsion principles to decisions of administrative agencies.\nFor example, as late as 1947, the D. C. Circuit would rely\n6      B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\non the \u201cwell settled doctrine that res judicata and equita-\nble estoppel do not ordinarily apply to decisions of admin-\nistrative tribunals.\u201d Churchill Tabernacle v. FCC, 160\nF. 2d 244, 246 (1947).\n   The Restatement of Judgments also reflected this prac-\ntice: It contained no provision for administrative preclu-\nsion and explained that it would not address \u201cthe effect of\nthe decisions of administrative tribunals.\u201d Restatement of\nJudgments, Scope Note, at 2. It rejected the idea of any\nconsistent practice in favor of administrative preclusion,\nnoting that \u201cthe question whether the decisions of a par-\nticular tribunal are binding in subsequent controversies\ndepends upon the character of the tribunal and the nature\nof its procedure and the construction of the statute creat-\ning the tribunal and conferring powers upon it.\u201d Ibid.\n   Consistent with that comment, federal courts approved\nof administrative preclusion in narrow circumstances\narguably involving only claims against the Government,\nover which Congress exercises a broader measure of con-\ntrol.2 In the 19th century, for instance, this Court effec-\ntively gave preclusive effect to the decisions of the U. S.\nLand Department with respect to land patents when it\nheld such patents unreviewable in federal court \u201cfor mere\nerrors of judgment.\u201d Smelting Co. v. Kemp, 104 U.

As one commentator put it, res judicata\ncould \u201cnot apply, in any strict or technical sense, to the\ndecisions of administrative agencies.\u201d Cooper, supra, at\n241.\n   This history undercuts any suggestion in Utah Con-\nstruction that administrative preclusion was widely ac-\ncepted at common law. Accordingly, at least for statutes\npassed before Astoria, I would reject the presumption of\nadministrative preclusion.3\n                              II\nIn light of this history, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s\ndecision to apply administrative preclusion in the context\nof the Lanham Act.4 To start, the Lanham Act was en-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 I have no occasion to consider whether the discussion in Astoria,\n\nElliott, or Utah Construction could be understood to create a back-\nground principle in favor of administrative preclusion that would apply,\nas a matter of statutory interpretation, to statutes passed after those\ndecisions.\n   4 The majority insists that we must apply the presumption of admin-\n\nistrative preclusion because the Court has \u201crepeatedly endorsed Utah\nConstruction\u201d and the parties do not challenge \u201cits historical accuracy.\u201d\nAnte, at 12, n. 2. But regardless of whether the Court has endorsed\nUtah Construction\u2019s dictum, the Court has never applied the presump-\ntion of administrative preclusion to the Lanham Act. Even if the\nCourt\u2019s description of the presumption were not dictum, no principle of\nstare decisis requires us to extend a tool of statutory interpretation\nfrom one statute to another without first considering whether it is\nappropriate for that statute. Cf. CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553\nU. S. 442, 469\u2013470 (2008) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (\u201c[S]tare decisis,\n8      B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nacted in 1946, 20 years before this Court said\u2014even in dic-\ntum\u2014that administrative preclusion was an established\ncommon-law principle. Thus, even if one thought that the\ndictum in Utah Construction were sufficient to establish a\ncommon-law principle in favor of preclusion, that conclu-\nsion would not warrant applying Astoria\u2019s presumption to\nthis enactment from the 1940\u2019s. And, construing the Act\non its own terms, I see no reason to conclude that Con-\ngress intended administrative preclusion to apply to TTAB\nfindings of fact in a subsequent trademark infringement\nsuit. The Act says nothing to indicate such an intent, and\nseveral features of the Act support the contrary inference.\n   The first feature indicating that Congress did not intend\npreclusion to apply is the limited authority the Act gives\nthe TTAB. The Act authorizes the TTAB only to \u201cdeter-\nmine and decide the respective rights of [trademark]\nregistration,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71067(a), thereby withholding\nany authority from the TTAB to \u201cdetermine the right to\nuse\u201d a trademark or to \u201cdecide broader questions of in-\nfringement or unfair competition,\u201d TTAB Manual of Pro-\ncedure \u00a7102.01 (2014). This limited job description indi-\ncates that TTAB\u2019s conclusions regarding registration were\nnever meant to become decisive\u2014through application of\nadministrative preclusion\u2014in subsequent infringement\nsuits. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71115(a) (providing that registration\nof a mark \u201cshall be prima facie evidence of the validity of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndesigned to be a principle of stability or repose, [should not] become a\nvehicle of change whereby an error in one area metastasizes into\nothers, thereby distorting the law\u201d). As for the parties\u2019 lack of argu-\nment, I would not treat tools of statutory interpretation as claims that\ncan be forfeited. If, for example, one party peppered its brief with\nlegislative history, and the opposing party did not challenge the propri-\nety of using legislative history, I still would not consider myself bound\nto rely upon it. The same is true here: Although the Court has com-\nmented in the past that the presumption of administrative preclusion\nwould apply to other statutes, we are not bound to apply it now to the\nLanham Act, even if the parties have assumed we would.\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                9\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe registered mark\u201d but \u201cshall not preclude another\nperson from proving any legal or equitable defense or\ndefect\u201d). Giving preclusive effect to the TTAB\u2019s decision on\nlikelihood of confusion would be an end-run around the\nstatutory limitation on its authority, as all parties agree\nthat likelihood of confusion is the central issue in a subse-\nquent infringement suit.\n   A second indication that Congress did not intend admin-\nistrative preclusion to apply is the Lanham Act\u2019s provision\nfor judicial review. After the TTAB issues a registration\ndecision, a party \u201cwho is dissatisfied with the decision\u201d\nmay either appeal to the Federal Circuit or file a civil\naction in district court seeking review. \u00a7\u00a71071(a)(1),\n(b)(1).5 And it is undisputed that a civil action in district\ncourt would entail de novo review of the TTAB\u2019s decision.\nAnte, at 5. Although under ordinary preclusion principles\n\u201cthe failure to pursue an appeal does not undermine issue\npreclusion,\u201d ante, at 13, the availability of de novo judicial\nreview of an administrative decision does. That is true\nboth because the judicial review afforded by the Act marks\nthe first opportunity for consideration of the issue by an\nArticle III court and because Congress has deviated from\nthe usual practice of affording deference to the factfind-\nings of an initial tribunal in affording de novo review of\nthe TTAB\u2019s decisions.\n   The decision to provide this de novo review is even more\nstriking in light of the historical background of the choice:\nCongress passed the Lanham Act the same year it passed\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, following a lengthy\nperiod of disagreement in the courts about what deference\nadministrative findings of fact were entitled to receive on\ndirect review. The issue had been the subject of debate for\nover 50 years, with varying results. See generally 2 J.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 5 The original 1946 Lanham Act provided for appeal to the Court of\n\nCustoms and Patent Appeals.

Sometimes this Court refused to re-\nview factual determinations of administrative agencies at\nall, Smelting Co., 104 U.

Union Pacific R. Co., 222 U. S. 541, 546\u2013548 (1912),\nbut reserved the authority to review de novo any so-called\n\u201cjurisdictional facts.\u201d Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62\u2013\n63 (1932). Courts then struggled to determine the bound-\nary between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional facts, and\nthus to determine the appropriate standard of review for\nadministrative decisions. See, e.g., Estep v. United States,\n327 U. S. 114, 142 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in\nresult) (noting the \u201ccasuistic difficulties spawned\u201d in\nCrowell and the \u201cattritions of that case through later\ndecisions\u201d). Although Congress provided for substantial-\nevidence review in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(E), it required de novo review in the Lan-\nham Act.\n   I need not take a side in this historical debate about the\nproper level of review for administrative findings of fact to\nconclude that its existence provides yet another reason to\ndoubt that Congress intended administrative preclusion\nto apply to the Lanham Act.\n                             III\n  In addition to being unsupported by our precedents or\nhistorical evidence, the majority\u2019s application of adminis-\ntrative preclusion raises serious constitutional concerns.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    To the extent that administrative agencies could, con-\nsistent with the Constitution, function as courts, they\nmight only be able to do so with respect to claims involving\npublic or quasi-private rights. See Northern Pipeline\nConstr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 68\u201370\n(1982) (plurality opinion); see also Nelson 561\u2013574; Dick-\ninson, supra, at 6. Public rights are those belonging to the\npublic as a whole, see Nelson 566, whereas quasi-private\nrights, or statutory entitlements, are those \u201c \u2018privileges\u2019 \u201d or\n\u201c \u2018franchises\u2019 \u201d that are bestowed by the government on\nindividuals, id., at 567; see, e.g., Ex parte Bakelite Corp.,\n279 U.

As discussed above,\nmost administrative adjudications that were given preclu-\nsive effect in Article III courts involved quasi-private\nrights like land grants. See Smelting Co., 104 U. S., at\n646. And in the context of land grants, this Court recog-\nnized that once \u201ctitle had passed from the government,\u201d a\nmore complete form of judicial review was available be-\ncause \u201cthe question became one of private right.\u201d Johnson\nv. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72, 87 (1871).\n    It is true that, in the New Deal era, the Court some-\ntimes gave preclusive effect to administrative findings of\nfact in tax cases, which could be construed to implicate\nprivate rights. See, e.g., Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v.\nAdkins, 310 U. S. 381, 401\u2013404 (1940); Tait v. Western\nMaryland R. Co., 289 U. S. 620, 622\u2013624 (1933). But\nadministrative tax determinations may simply have en-\njoyed a special historical status, in which case this practice\nmight be best understood as a limited deviation from a\ngeneral distinction between public and private rights.

Registration is a\ncreature of the Lanham Act, which \u201cconfers important\nlegal rights and benefits on trademark owners who regis-\nter their marks.\u201d Ante, at 3 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Because registration is merely a statutory gov-\nernment entitlement, no one disputes that the TTAB may\nconstitutionally adjudicate a registration claim.          See\nStern, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 19); Nelson 568\u2013569.\n   By contrast, the right to adopt and exclusively use a\ntrademark appears to be a private property right that \u201chas\nbeen long recognized by the common law and the chancery\ncourts of England and of this country.\u201d Trade-Mark Cases,\n100 U. S. 82, 92 (1879). As this Court explained when\naddressing Congress\u2019 first trademark statute, enacted in\n1870, the exclusive right to use a trademark \u201cwas not\ncreated by the act of Congress, and does not now depend\nupon it for its enforcement.\u201d Ibid. \u201cThe whole system of\ntrade-mark property and the civil remedies for its protec-\ntion existed long anterior to that act, and have remained\nin full force since its passage.\u201d Ibid. Thus, it appears that\nthe trademark infringement suit at issue in this case\nmight be of a type that must be decided by \u201cArticle III\njudges in Article III courts.\u201d Stern, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18).\n   The majority, however, would have Article III courts\ndecide infringement claims where the central issue\u2014\nwhether there is a likelihood of consumer confusion be-\ntween two trademarks\u2014has already been decided by an\nexecutive agency. This raises two potential constitutional\nconcerns. First, it may deprive a trademark holder of the\nopportunity to have a core private right adjudicated in an\nArticle III court. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 21). Second, it\nmay effect a transfer of a core attribute of the judicial\npower to an executive agency. Cf. Perez, ante, at 10\u201312\n14    B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.) (explaining that interpretation of\nregulations having the force and effect of law is likely a\ncore attribute of the judicial power that cannot be trans-\nferred to an executive agency). Administrative preclusion\nthus threatens to \u201csap the judicial power as it exists under\nthe Federal Constitution, and to establish a government of\na bureaucratic character alien to our own system, wher-\never fundamental rights depend . . . upon the facts, and\nfinality as to facts becomes in effect finality in law.\u201d\nCrowell, 285 U. S., at 57.\n   At a minimum, this practice raises serious questions\nthat the majority does not adequately confront. The ma-\njority does not address the distinction between private\nrights and public rights or the nature of the power exer-\ncised by an administrative agency when adjudicating facts\nin private-rights disputes. And it fails to consider whether\napplying administrative preclusion to a core factual de-\ntermination in a private-rights dispute comports with the\nseparation of powers.\n                        *    *    *\n  I would hold that the TTAB\u2019s trademark-registration\ndecisions are not entitled to preclusive effect in a subse-\nquent infringement suit. The common law does not sup-\nport a general presumption in favor of administrative\npreclusion for statutes passed before this Court\u2019s decision\nin Astoria, and the text, structure, and history of the\nLanham Act provide no support for such preclusion. I\ndisagree with the majority\u2019s willingness to endorse Asto-\nria\u2019s unfounded presumption and to apply it to an adjudi-\ncation in a private-rights dispute, as that analysis raises\nserious constitutional questions. Because I can resolve\nthis case on statutory grounds, however, I leave these\nquestions for another day. I respectfully dissent.\n",

(Hargis), tried to register its trade-\n  mark for SEALTITE with the United States Patent and Trademark\n  Office pursuant to the Lanham Act. Petitioner, B&B Hardware, Inc.\n  (B&B), however, opposed registration, claiming that SEALTITE is\n  too similar to B&B\u2019s own SEALTIGHT trademark. The Trademark\n  Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) concluded that SEALTITE should\n  not be registered because of the likelihood of confusion. Hargis did\n  not seek judicial review of that decision.\n     Later, in an infringement suit before the District Court, B&B ar-\n  gued that Hargis was precluded from contesting the likelihood of con-\n  fusion because of the TTAB\u2019s decision. The District Court disagreed.\n  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that preclusion was unwarrant-\n  ed because the TTAB and the court used different factors to evaluate\n  likelihood of confusion, the TTAB placed too much emphasis on the\n  appearance and sound of the two marks, and Hargis bore the burden\n  of persuasion before the TTAB while B&B bore it before the District\n  Court.\nHeld: So long as the other ordinary elements of issue preclusion are\n  met, when the usages adjudicated by the TTAB are materially the\n  same as those before a district court, issue preclusion should apply.\n  Pp. 8\u201322.\n     (a) An agency decision can ground issue preclusion.

Astoria,\n    501 U. S., at 108. This case is unlike Astoria. There, where exhaust-\n    ing the administrative process was a prerequisite to suit in court, giv-\n    ing preclusive effect to the agency\u2019s determination in that very ad-\n    ministrative process could have rendered the judicial suit \u201cstrictly\n    pro forma.\u201d Id., at 111. By contrast, registration involves a separate\n    proceeding to decide separate rights. Pp. 12\u201314.\n       (c) There is no categorical reason why registration decisions can\n    never meet the ordinary elements of issue preclusion. That many\n    registrations will not satisfy those ordinary elements does not mean\n    that none will. Pp. 15\u201322.\n          (1) Contrary to the Eighth Circuit\u2019s conclusion, the same likeli-\n    hood-of-confusion standard applies to both registration and infringe-\n    ment. The factors that the TTAB and the Eighth Circuit use to as-\n    sess likelihood of confusion are not fundamentally different, and,\n    more important, the operative language of each statute is essentially\n    the same.\n       Hargis claims that the standards are different, noting that the reg-\n    istration provision asks whether the marks \u201cresemble\u201d each other, 15\n    U. S. C. \u00a71052(d), while the infringement provision is directed to-\n    wards the \u201cuse in commerce\u201d of the marks, \u00a71114(1). That the TTAB\n    and a district court do not always consider the same usages, however,\n    does not mean that the TTAB applies a different standard to the us-\n    ages it does consider. If a mark owner uses its mark in materially\n    the same ways as the usages included in its registration application,\n    then the TTAB is deciding the same likelihood-of-confusion issue as a\n    district court in infringement litigation. For a similar reason, the\n    Eighth Circuit erred in holding that issue preclusion could not apply\n    because the TTAB relied too heavily on \u201cappearance and sound.\u201d\n    Pp. 15\u201319.\n          (2) The fact that the TTAB and district courts use different pro-\n    cedures suggests only that sometimes issue preclusion might be in-\n    appropriate, not that it always is. Here, there is no categorical \u201crea-\n    son to doubt the quality, extensiveness, or fairness,\u201d Montana v.\n    United States, 440 U. S. 147, 164, n. 11, of the agency\u2019s procedures.\n    In large part they are exactly the same as in federal court. Also con-\n    trary to the Eighth Circuit\u2019s conclusion, B&B, the party opposing reg-\n    istration, not Hargis, bore the burden of persuasion before the TTAB,\n    just as it did in the infringement suit. Pp. 19\u201321.\n          (3) Hargis is also wrong that the stakes for registration are al-\n    ways too low for issue preclusion in later infringement litigation.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

When that happens, the decision of the\nfirst tribunal usually must be followed by the second, at\nleast if the issue is really the same. Allowing the same\nissue to be decided more than once wastes litigants\u2019 re-\nsources and adjudicators\u2019 time, and it encourages parties\nwho lose before one tribunal to shop around for another.\nThe doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion is\ndesigned to prevent this from occurring.\n   This case concerns the application of issue preclusion in\nthe context of trademark law. Petitioner, B&B Hardware,\nInc. (B&B), and respondent Hargis Industries, Inc. (Har-\ngis), both use similar trademarks; B&B owns SEALTIGHT\nwhile Hargis owns SEALTITE. Under the Lanham Act,\n60 Stat. 427, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71051 et seq., an\napplicant can seek to register a trademark through an\nadministrative process within the United States Patent\nand Trademark Office (PTO). But if another party be-\n2      B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlieves that the PTO should not register a mark because it\nis too similar to its own, that party can oppose registration\nbefore the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB).\nHere, Hargis tried to register the mark SEALTITE, but\nB&B opposed SEALTITE\u2019s registration. After a lengthy\nproceeding, the TTAB agreed with B&B that SEALTITE\nshould not be registered.\n   In addition to permitting a party to object to the regis-\ntration of a mark, the Lanham Act allows a mark owner to\nsue for trademark infringement. Both a registration\nproceeding and a suit for trademark infringement, more-\nover, can occur at the same time. In this case, while the\nTTAB was deciding whether SEALTITE should be regis-\ntered, B&B and Hargis were also litigating the\nSEALTIGHT versus SEALTITE dispute in federal court.\nIn both registration proceedings and infringement litiga-\ntion, the tribunal asks whether a likelihood of confusion\nexists between the mark sought to be protected (here,\nSEALTIGHT) and the other mark (SEALTITE).\n   The question before this Court is whether the District\nCourt in this case should have applied issue preclusion to\nthe TTAB\u2019s decision that SEALTITE is confusingly similar\nto SEALTIGHT. Here, the Eighth Circuit rejected issue\npreclusion for reasons that would make it difficult for the\ndoctrine ever to apply in trademark disputes. We disagree\nwith that narrow understanding of issue preclusion.\nInstead, consistent with principles of law that apply in\ninnumerable contexts, we hold that a court should give\npreclusive effect to TTAB decisions if the ordinary ele-\nments of issue preclusion are met. We therefore reverse\nthe judgment of the Eighth Circuit and remand for further\nproceedings.\n                             I\n                            A\n    Trademark law has a long history, going back at least to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRoman times. See Restatement (Third) of Unfair Compe-\ntition \u00a79, Comment b (1993). The principle underlying\ntrademark protection is that distinctive marks\u2014words,\nnames, symbols, and the like\u2014can help distinguish a\nparticular artisan\u2019s goods from those of others. Ibid. One\nwho first uses a distinct mark in commerce thus acquires\nrights to that mark. See 2 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and\nUnfair Competition \u00a716:1 (4th ed. 2014) (hereinafter\nMcCarthy). Those rights include preventing others from\nusing the mark. See 1 A. LaLonde, Gilson on Trademarks\n\u00a73.02[8] (2014) (hereinafter Gilson).\n   Though federal law does not create trademarks, see,\ne.g., Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 92 (1879), Congress\nhas long played a role in protecting them. In 1946, Con-\ngress enacted the Lanham Act, the current federal trade-\nmark scheme. As relevant here, the Lanham Act creates\nat least two adjudicative mechanisms to help protect\nmarks. First, a trademark owner can register its mark\nwith the PTO. Second, a mark owner can bring a suit for\ninfringement in federal court.\n   Registration is significant. The Lanham Act confers\n\u201cimportant legal rights and benefits\u201d on trademark owners\nwho register their marks. 3 McCarthy \u00a719:3, at 19\u201321 see\nalso id., \u00a719:9, at 19\u201334 (listing seven of the \u201cprocedural\nand substantive legal advantages\u201d of registration). Regis-\ntration, for instance, serves as \u201cconstructive notice of the\nregistrant\u2019s claim of ownership\u201d of the mark. 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71072. It also is \u201cprima facie evidence of the validity of\nthe registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of\nthe owner\u2019s ownership of the mark, and of the owner\u2019s\nexclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce on\nor in connection with the goods or services specified in the\ncertificate.\u201d \u00a71057(b). And once a mark has been regis-\ntered for five years, it can become \u201cincontestable.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71065,\n1115(b)\n   To obtain the benefits of registration, a mark owner files\n4     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nan application with the PTO. \u00a71051. The application\nmust include, among other things, \u201cthe date of the appli-\ncant\u2019s first use of the mark, the date of the applicant\u2019s first\nuse of the mark in commerce, the goods in connection with\nwhich the mark is used, and a drawing of the mark.\u201d\n\u00a71051(a)(2). The usages listed in the application\u2014i.e.,\nthose goods on which the mark appears along with, if\napplicable, their channels of distribution\u2014are critical.\nSee, e.g., 3 McCarthy \u00a720:24, at 20\u201383 (\u201c[T]he applicant\u2019s\nright to register must be made on the basis of the goods\ndescribed in the application\u201d); id., \u00a720:15, at 20\u201385 (ex-\nplaining that if an \u201capplication does not delimit any spe-\ncific trade channels of distribution, no limitation will be\u201d\napplied). The PTO generally cannot register a mark which\n\u201cso resembles\u201d another mark \u201cas to be likely, when used on\nor in connection with the goods of the applicant, to cause\nconfusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71052(d).\n   If a trademark examiner believes that registration is\nwarranted, the mark is published in the Official Gazette of\nthe PTO. \u00a71062. At that point, \u201c[a]ny person who believes\nthat he would be damaged by the registration\u201d may \u201cfile\nan opposition.\u201d \u00a71063(a). Opposition proceedings occur\nbefore the TTAB (or panels thereof). \u00a71067(a). The TTAB\nconsists of administrative trademark judges and high-\nranking PTO officials, including the Director of the PTO\nand the Commissioner of Trademarks. \u00a71067(b).\n   Opposition proceedings before the TTAB are in many\nways \u201csimilar to a civil action in a federal district court.\u201d\nTTAB Manual of Procedure \u00a7102.03 (2014) (hereinafter\nTTAB Manual), online at http://www.uspto.gov (as visited\nMar. 20, 2015, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\nThese proceedings, for instance, are largely governed by\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Evidence. See 37\nCFR \u00a7\u00a72.116(a), 2.122(a) (2014). The TTAB also allows\ndiscovery and depositions. See \u00a7\u00a72.120, 2.123(a). The\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nparty opposing registration bears the burden of proof, see\n\u00a72.116(b), and if that burden cannot be met, the opposed\nmark must be registered, see 15 U. S. C. \u00a71063(b).\n  The primary way in which TTAB proceedings differ from\nordinary civil litigation is that \u201cproceedings before the\nBoard are conducted in writing, and the Board\u2019s actions in\na particular case are based upon the written record therein.\u201d\nTTAB Manual \u00a7102.03. In other words, there is no live\ntestimony. Even so, the TTAB allows parties to submit\ntranscribed testimony, taken under oath and subject to\ncross-examination, and to request oral argument. See 37\nCFR \u00a7\u00a72.123, 2.129.\n  When a party opposes registration because it believes\nthe mark proposed to be registered is too similar to its\nown, the TTAB evaluates likelihood of confusion by apply-\ning some or all of the 13 factors set out in In re E. I.\nDuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F. 2d 1357 (CCPA 1973).\nAfter the TTAB decides whether to register the mark, a\nparty can seek review in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit, or it can file a new action in district court.\nSee 15 U. S. C. \u00a71071. In district court, the parties can\nconduct additional discovery and the judge resolves regis-\ntration de novo. \u00a71071(b); see also 3 McCarthy \u00a721:20\n(explaining differences between the forums); cf. Kappos v.\nHyatt, 566 U. S. ___ (2012) (de novo review for analogous\nscheme in patent law).\n  The Lanham Act, of course, also creates a federal cause\nof action for trademark infringement. The owner of a\nmark, whether registered or not, can bring suit in federal\ncourt if another is using a mark that too closely resembles\nthe plaintiff \u2019s. The court must decide whether the de-\nfendant\u2019s use of a mark in commerce \u201cis likely to cause\nconfusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\u201d with regards\nto the plaintiff \u2019s mark. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71114(1)(a) (regis-\ntered marks); \u00a71125(a)(1)(A) (unregistered marks). In\ninfringement litigation, the district court considers the full\n6     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrange of a mark\u2019s usages, not just those in the application.\n                               B\n  Petitioner B&B and respondent Hargis both manufac-\nture metal fasteners. B&B manufactures fasteners for the\naerospace industry, while Hargis manufactures fasteners\nfor use in the construction trade. Although there are\nobvious differences between space shuttles and A-frame\nbuildings, both aerospace and construction engineers\nprefer fasteners that seal things tightly. Accordingly, both\nB&B and Hargis want their wares associated with tight\nseals. A feud of nearly two decades has sprung from this\nseemingly commonplace set of facts.\n  In 1993 B&B registered SEALTIGHT for \u201cthreaded or\nunthreaded metal fasteners and other related hardwar[e];\nnamely, self-sealing nuts, bolts, screws, rivets and wash-\ners, all having a captive o-ring, for use in the aerospace\nindustry.\u201d App. 223a (capitalization omitted). In 1996,\nHargis sought to register SEALTITE for \u201cself-piercing and\nself-drilling metal screws for use in the manufacture of\nmetal and post-frame buildings.\u201d App. 70a (capitalization\nomitted). B&B opposed Hargis\u2019 registration because,\nalthough the two companies sell different products, it\nbelieves that SEALTITE is confusingly similar to\nSEALTIGHT.\n  The twists and turns in the SEALTIGHT versus\nSEALTITE controversy are labyrinthine. The question\nwhether either of these marks should be registered, and if\nso, which one, has bounced around within the PTO for\nabout two decades; related infringement litigation has\nbeen before the Eighth Circuit three times; and two sepa-\nrate juries have been empaneled and returned verdicts.\nThe full story could fill a long, unhappy book.\n  For purposes here, we pick up the story in 2002, when\nthe PTO published SEALTITE in the Official Gazette.\nThis prompted opposition proceedings before the TTAB,\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncomplete with discovery, including depositions. B&B ar-\ngued that SEALTITE could not be registered because it\nis confusingly similar to SEALTIGHT. B&B explained, for\ninstance, that both companies have an online presence,\nthe largest distributor of fasteners sells both companies\u2019\nproducts, and consumers sometimes call the wrong com-\npany to place orders. Hargis rejoined that the companies\nsell different products, for different uses, to different types\nof consumers, through different channels of trade.\n   Invoking a number of the DuPont factors, the TTAB\nsided with B&B. The Board considered, for instance,\nwhether SEALTIGHT is famous (it\u2019s not, said the Board),\nhow the two products are used (differently), how much the\nmarks resemble each other (very much), and whether\ncustomers are actually confused (perhaps sometimes). See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 55a\u201371a. Concluding that \u201cthe most\ncritical factors in [its] likelihood of confusion analysis are\nthe similarities of the marks and the similarity of the\ngoods,\u201d id., at 70a, the TTAB determined that\nSEALTITE\u2014when \u201cused in connection with \u2018self-piercing\nand self-drilling metal screws for use in the manufacture\nof metal and post-frame buildings\u2019 \u201d\u2014could not be regis-\ntered because it \u201cso resembles\u201d SEALTIGHT when \u201cused\nin connection with fasteners that provide leakproof protec-\ntion from liquids and gases, fasteners that have a captive\no-ring, and \u2018threaded or unthreaded metal fastners and\nother related hardware . . . for use in the aerospace indus-\ntry\u2019 as to be likely to cause confusion,\u201d id., at 71a. Despite\na right to do so, Hargis did not seek judicial review in\neither the Federal Circuit or District Court.\n   All the while, B&B had sued Hargis for infringement.\nBefore the District Court ruled on likelihood of confusion,\nhowever, the TTAB announced its decision. After a series\nof proceedings not relevant here, B&B argued to the Dis-\ntrict Court that Hargis could not contest likelihood of\nconfusion because of the preclusive effect of the TTAB\n8     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision. The District Court disagreed, reasoning that the\nTTAB is not an Article III court. The jury returned a\nverdict for Hargis, finding no likelihood of confusion.\n  B&B appealed to the Eighth Circuit. Though accepting\nfor the sake of argument that agency decisions can ground\nissue preclusion, the panel majority affirmed for three\nreasons: first, because the TTAB uses different factors\nthan the Eighth Circuit to evaluate likelihood of confusion;\nsecond, because the TTAB placed too much emphasis on\nthe appearance and sound of the two marks; and third,\nbecause Hargis bore the burden of persuasion before the\nTTAB, while B&B bore it before the District Court. 716\nF. 3d 1020 (2013). Judge Colloton dissented, concluding\nthat issue preclusion should apply. After calling for the\nviews of the Solicitor General, we granted certiorari. 573\nU. S. ___ (2014).\n                              II\n  The first question that we must address is whether an\nagency decision can ever ground issue preclusion. The\nDistrict Court rejected issue preclusion because agencies\nare not Article III courts. The Eighth Circuit did not\nadopt that view, and, given this Court\u2019s cases, it was right\nto take that course.\n  This Court has long recognized that \u201cthe determination\nof a question directly involved in one action is conclusive\nas to that question in a second suit.\u201d Cromwell v. County\nof Sac, 94 U. S. 351, 354 (1877). The idea is straightfor-\nward: Once a court has decided an issue, it is \u201cforever\nsettled as between the parties,\u201d Baldwin v. Iowa State\nTraveling Men\u2019s Assn. 283 U. S. 522, 525 (1931), thereby\n\u201cprotect[ing]\u201d against \u201cthe expense and vexation attending\nmultiple lawsuits, conserv[ing] judicial resources, and\nfoster[ing] reliance on judicial action by minimizing the\npossibility of inconsistent verdicts,\u201d Montana v. United\nStates, 440 U. S. 147, 153\u2013154 (1979). In short, \u201ca losing\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlitigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered.\u201d\nAstoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104,\n107 (1991).\n   Although the idea of issue preclusion is straightforward,\nit can be challenging to implement. The Court, therefore,\nregularly turns to the Restatement (Second) of Judgments\nfor a statement of the ordinary elements of issue preclu-\nsion. See, e.g., Bobby v. Bies, 556 U. S. 825, 834 (2009);\nNew Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U. S. 742, 748\u2013749 (2001);\nBaker v. General Motors Corp., 522 U. S. 222, 233, n. 5\n(1998). The Restatement explains that subject to certain\nwell-known exceptions, the general rule is that \u201c[w]hen an\nissue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by\na valid and final judgment, and the determination is\nessential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive\nin a subsequent action between the parties, whether on\nthe same or a different claim.\u201d Restatement (Second) of\nJudgments \u00a727, p. 250 (1980); see also id., \u00a728, at 273\n(listing exceptions such as whether appellate review was\navailable or whether there were \u201cdifferences in the quality\nor extensiveness of the procedures followed\u201d).\n   Both this Court\u2019s cases and the Restatement make clear\nthat issue preclusion is not limited to those situations in\nwhich the same issue is before two courts. Rather, where\na single issue is before a court and an administrative\nagency, preclusion also often applies. Indeed, this Court\nhas explained that because the principle of issue preclu-\nsion was so \u201cwell established\u201d at common law, in those\nsituations in which Congress has authorized agencies to\nresolve disputes, \u201ccourts may take it as given that Con-\ngress has legislated with the expectation that the principle\n[of issue preclusion] will apply except when a statutory\npurpose to the contrary is evident.\u201d Astoria, supra, at 108.\nThis reflects the Court\u2019s longstanding view that \u201c \u2018[w]hen\nan administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity\nand resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it\n10     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich the parties have had an adequate opportunity to\nlitigate, the courts have not hesitated to apply res judicata\nto enforce repose.\u2019 \u201d University of Tenn. v. Elliott, 478 U. S.\n788, 797\u2013798 (1986) (quoting United States v. Utah\nConstr. & Mining Co., 384 U. S. 394, 422 (1966)); see also\nHayfield Northern R. Co. v. Chicago & North Western\nTransp.

Otherwise, Hargis warns,\nthe Court would have to confront \u201c \u2018grave and doubtful\nquestions\u2019 as to the Lanham Act\u2019s consistency with the\nSeventh Amendment and Article III of the Constitution.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 38 (quoting United States ex rel.\nAttorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S.\n366, 408 (1909)). We are not persuaded.\n   At the outset, we note that Hargis does not argue that\ngiving issue preclusive effect to the TTAB\u2019s decision would\nbe unconstitutional. Instead, Hargis contends only that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See Brief for Respondent 28 (acknowledging that administrative\n\n\u201c[p]reclusion\u2019s status as part of the common-law backdrop means that\ncourts may presume its application\u201d absent contrary indication from\nCongress) (citing Astoria 501 U. S., at 110); Brief for Respondent 34\n(explaining that Utah Construction determined that \u201can administrative\nboard\u2019s factfinding . . . could . . . have preclusive effect in an Article III\nsuit raising damages claims over which the board had no jurisdiction\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe should read the Lanham Act narrowly because a broad\nreading might be unconstitutional. See, e.g., Brief for\nRespondent 37, 39, 40, 41\u201342. The likely reason that\nHargis has not directly advanced a constitutional argu-\nment is that, at least as to a jury trial right, Hargis did not\neven list the Seventh Amendment as an authority in its\nappellee brief to the Eighth Circuit. Moreover, although\nHargis pressed an Article III argument below, in its oppo-\nsition to certiorari in this Court, Hargis seemingly con-\nceded that TTAB decisions can sometimes ground issue\npreclusion, though it now protests otherwise.               See\nSupplemental Brief in Opposition 2. To the extent, if any,\nthat there could be a meritorious constitutional objection,\nit is not before us. See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.,\n514 U. S. 211, 231\u2013232 (1995).\n   We reject Hargis\u2019 statutory argument that we should\njettison administrative preclusion in whole or in part to\navoid potential constitutional concerns. As to the Seventh\nAmendment, for instance, the Court has already held that\nthe right to a jury trial does not negate the issue-\npreclusive effect of a judgment, even if that judgment was\nentered by a juryless tribunal. See Parklane Hosiery Co.\nv. Shore, 439 U. S. 322, 337 (1979). It would seem to\nfollow naturally that although the Seventh Amendment\ncreates a jury trial right in suits for trademark damages,\nsee Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U. S. 469, 477, 479\u2013480\n(1962), TTAB decisions still can have preclusive effect in\nsuch suits. Hargis disputes this reasoning even though it\nadmits that in 1791 \u201c \u2018a party was not entitled to have a\njury determine issues that had been previously adjudi-\ncated by a chancellor in equity.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 39\n(quoting Parklane Hosiery, supra, at 333). Instead, Hargis\ncontends that issue preclusion should not apply to TTAB\nregistration decisions because there were no agencies at\ncommon law. But our precedent holds that the Seventh\nAmendment does not strip competent tribunals of the\n12    B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\npower to issue judgments with preclusive effect; that logic\nwould not seem to turn on the nature of the competent\ntribunal. And at the same time, adopting Hargis\u2019 view\nwould dramatically undercut agency preclusion, despite\nwhat the Court has already said to the contrary. Nothing\nin Hargis\u2019 avoidance argument is weighty enough to over-\ncome these weaknesses.\n   The claim that we should read the Lanham Act narrowly\nto avoid Article III concerns is equally unavailing\u2014and\nfor similar reasons. Hargis argues that because it might\nviolate Article III if an agency could make a decision with\npreclusive effect in a later proceeding before a federal\ncourt, we should conclude, as a statutory matter, that\nissue preclusion is unavailable. Such a holding would not\nfit with our precedent. For instance, in Elliott, the Court,\nrelying on Utah Construction, explained that absent a\ncontrary indication, Congress presumptively intends that\nan agency\u2019s determination (there, a state agency) has\npreclusive effect. 478 U. S., at 796\u2013799; see also Astoria,\n501 U. S., at 110 (recognizing the \u201cpresumption\u201d). To be\nsure, the Court has never addressed whether such preclu-\nsion offends Article III. But because this Court\u2019s cases are\nso clear, there is no ambiguity for this Court to sidestep\nthrough constitutional avoidance.2\n                          III\n  The next question is whether there is an \u201cevident\u201d rea-\nson why Congress would not want TTAB decisions to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Our dissenting colleagues argue that Utah Construction\u2019s conclu-\n\nsion that courts \u201chave not hesitated\u201d to apply administrative preclu-\nsion, 384 U. S., at 422, was mistaken and certainly should not be\napplied to statutes\u2014such as the Lanham Act\u2014enacted prior to 1966.\nWe do not decide who reads the history better. The Court has repeat-\nedly endorsed Utah Construction and, importantly, neither party chal-\nlenges its historical accuracy. For the same reason, we do not decide\nwhether such preclusion is unconstitutional because the issue is not\nbefore us.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreceive preclusive effect, even in those cases in which the\nordinary elements of issue preclusion are met. Astoria,\nsupra, at 108. We conclude that nothing in the Lanham\nAct bars the application of issue preclusion in such cases.\n   The Lanham Act\u2019s text certainly does not forbid issue\npreclusion. Nor does the Act\u2019s structure. Granted, one\ncan seek judicial review of a TTAB registration decision in\na de novo district court action, and some courts have con-\ncluded from this that Congress does not want unreviewed\nTTAB decisions to ground issue preclusion. See, e.g.,\nAmerican Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Heritage Life Ins. Co.,\n494 F. 2d 3, 9\u201310 (CA5 1974). But that conclusion does\nnot follow. Ordinary preclusion law teaches that if a party\nto a court proceeding does not challenge an adverse deci-\nsion, that decision can have preclusive effect in other\ncases, even if it would have been reviewed de novo. See\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a728, Comment a and\nIllustration 1 (explaining that the failure to pursue an\nappeal does not undermine issue preclusion and including\nan example of an apparently unappealed district court\u2019s\ndismissal for failure to state a claim); cf. Federated De-\npartment Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U. S. 394, 398 (1981)\n(noting \u201cthe res judicata consequences of a final, unap-\npealed judgment on the merits\u201d).\n   This case is also unlike Astoria, where a plaintiff claim-\ning discrimination first went to an agency and then sued\nin court about the same alleged conduct. See 501 U. S., at\n111. The Court concluded, quite sensibly, that the struc-\nture of that scheme indicated that the agency decision\ncould not ground issue preclusion. When exhausting an\nadministrative process is a prerequisite to suit in court,\ngiving preclusive effect to the agency\u2019s determination in\nthat very administrative process could render the judicial\nsuit \u201cstrictly pro forma.\u201d Ibid.; see also Elliott, supra, at\n795\u2013796 (similar analysis). Here, if a party urged a dis-\ntrict court reviewing a TTAB registration decision to give\n14    B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npreclusive effect to the very TTAB decision under review,\nAstoria would apply. But that is not this case.\n   What matters here is that registration is not a prerequi-\nsite to an infringement action. Rather, it is a separate\nproceeding to decide separate rights. Neither is issue\npreclusion a one-way street. When a district court, as part\nof its judgment, decides an issue that overlaps with part of\nthe TTAB\u2019s analysis, the TTAB gives preclusive effect to\nthe court\u2019s judgment. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a\u2013\n55a (giving preclusive effect to the District Court\u2019s ear-\nlier decision regarding SEALTIGHT\u2019s distinctiveness be-\ncause the issue \u201cwas actually litigated and necessarily\ndetermined\u201d).\n   Hargis also argues that allowing TTAB decisions to\nhave issue-preclusive effect will adversely affect the regis-\ntration process. Because of the TTAB\u2019s \u201c \u2018limited jurisdic-\ntion\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018the narrowness of the issues\u2019 \u201d before it, Hargis\ncontends, the Court should infer that TTAB proceedings\nare supposed to be more streamlined than infringement\nlitigation. See Brief for Respondent 30 (quoting TTAB\nManual \u00a7402.01). But, the argument goes, if TTAB deci-\nsions can have issue-preclusive effect in infringement\nlitigation, parties may spend more time and energy before\nthe TTAB, thus bogging down the registration process.\nThis concern does not change our conclusion. Issue pre-\nclusion is available unless it is \u201cevident,\u201d Astoria, supra, at\n108, that Congress does not want it. Here, if a stream-\nlined process in all registration matters was particularly\ndear to Congress, it would not have authorized de novo\nchallenges for those \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with TTAB decisions.\n15 U. S. C. \u00a71071(b). Plenary review serves many func-\ntions, but ensuring a streamlined process is not one of\nthem. Moreover, as explained below, for a great many\nregistration decisions issue preclusion obviously will not\napply because the ordinary elements will not be met. For\nthose registrations, nothing we say today is relevant.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               IV \n\n  At last we turn to whether there is a categorical reason\nwhy registration decisions can never meet the ordinary\nelements of issue preclusion, e.g., those elements set out in\n\u00a727 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments. Although\nmany registrations will not satisfy those ordinary ele-\nments, that does not mean that none will. We agree with\nProfessor McCarthy that issue preclusion applies where\n\u201cthe issues in the two cases are indeed identical and the\nother rules of collateral estoppel are carefully observed.\u201d 6\nMcCarthy \u00a732:99, at 32\u2013244; see also 3 Gilson\n\u00a711.08[4][i][iii][B], p. 11\u2013319 (\u201cUltimately, Board decisions\non likelihood of confusion . . . should be given preclusive\neffect on a case-by-case basis\u201d).\n                              A\n   The Eighth Circuit\u2019s primary objection to issue preclu-\nsion was that the TTAB considers different factors than it\ndoes. Whereas the TTAB employs some or all of the\nDuPont factors to assess likelihood of confusion, the\nEighth Circuit looks to similar, but not identical, factors\nidentified in SquirtCo v. Seven-Up Co., 628 F. 2d 1086,\n1091 (CA8 1980).        The court\u2019s instinct was sound:\n\u201c[I]ssues are not identical if the second action involves\napplication of a different legal standard, even though the\nfactual setting of both suits may be the same.\u201d 18 C.\nWright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice & Proce-\ndure \u00a74417, p. 449 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright &\nMiller). Here, however, the same likelihood-of-confusion\nstandard applies to both registration and infringement.\n   To begin with, it does not matter that registration and\ninfringement are governed by different statutory provi-\nsions. Often a single standard is placed in different stat-\nutes; that does not foreclose issue preclusion. See, e.g.,\nSmith v. Bayer Corp., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n7). Neither does it matter that the TTAB and the Eighth\n16      B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit use different factors to assess likelihood of confu-\nsion. For one thing, the factors are not fundamentally\ndifferent, and \u201c[m]inor variations in the application of\nwhat is in essence the same legal standard do not defeat\npreclusion.\u201d Id., at ___, n. 9 (slip op., at 12, n. 9). More\nimportant, if federal law provides a single standard, par-\nties cannot escape preclusion simply by litigating anew in\ntribunals that apply that one standard differently. A\ncontrary rule would encourage the very evils that issue\npreclusion helps to prevent.\n   The real question, therefore, is whether likelihood of\nconfusion for purposes of registration is the same standard\nas likelihood of confusion for purposes of infringement.\nWe conclude it is, for at least three reasons. First, the\noperative language is essentially the same; the fact that\nthe registration provision separates \u201clikely\u201d from \u201cto cause\nconfusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\u201d does not\nchange that reality.3 See 2 Gilson \u00a75.01[2][a], at 5\u201317\n(explaining that \u201cthe same statutory test\u201d applies). Sec-\nond, the likelihood-of-confusion language that Congress\nused in these Lanham Act provisions has been central to\ntrademark registration since at least 1881. See Act of\nMar. 3, 1881, ch. 138, \u00a73, 21 Stat. 503 (using a \u201clikely to\ncause confusion\u201d standard for registration). That could\nhardly have been by accident. And third, district courts\ncan cancel registrations during infringement litigation,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Compare     15 U. S. C. \u00a71114(1) (\u201cAny person who shall . . . use in\ncommerce any . . . mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale,\ndistribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection\nwith which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or\nto deceive . . . shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant for the\nremedies hereinafter provided\u201d (emphasis added)) with \u00a71052(d) (\u201cNo\ntrademark . . . shall be refused registration . . . unless it . . .

C.\n\u00a71119; 3 McCarthy \u00a721:20. There is no reason to think\nthat the same district judge in the same case should apply\ntwo separate standards of likelihood of confusion.\n   Hargis responds that the text is not actually the same\nbecause the registration provision asks whether the marks\n\u201cresemble\u201d each other, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(d), while the\ninfringement provision is directed towards the \u201cuse in\ncommerce\u201d of the marks, \u00a71114(1). Indeed, according to\nHargis, the distinction between \u201cresembl[ance]\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d\nhas been key to trademark law for over a century. There\nis some force to this argument. It is true that \u201ca party\nopposing an application to register a mark before the\nBoard often relies only on its federal registration, not on\nany common-law rights in usages not encompassed by its\nregistration,\u201d and \u201cthe Board typically analyzes the marks,\ngoods, and channels of trade only as set forth in the appli-\ncation and in the opposer\u2019s registration, regardless of\nwhether the actual usage of the marks by either party\ndiffers.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23; see\nalso id., at 5 (explaining that \u201cthe Board typically reviews\nonly the usages encompassed by the registration\u201d) (citing 3\nGilson \u00a79.03[2][a][ii]); 3 McCarthy \u00a720:15, at 20\u201345 (ex-\nplaining that for registration \u201cit is the mark as shown in\nthe application and as used on the goods described in the\napplication which must be considered, not the mark as\nactually used\u201d). This means that unlike in infringement\nlitigation, \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s determination that a likelihood of\nconfusion does or does not exist will not resolve the confu-\nsion issue with respect to non-disclosed usages.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 23.\n   Hargis\u2019 argument falls short, however, because it mis-\ntakes a reason not to apply issue preclusion in some or\neven many cases as a reason never to apply issue preclu-\nsion. Just because the TTAB does not always consider the\n18     B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsame usages as a district court does, it does not follow that\nthe Board applies a different standard to the usages it\ndoes consider.4 If a mark owner uses its mark in ways\nthat are materially the same as the usages included in its\nregistration application, then the TTAB is deciding the\nsame likelihood-of-confusion issue as a district court in\ninfringement litigation. By contrast, if a mark owner uses\nits mark in ways that are materially unlike the usages in\nits application, then the TTAB is not deciding the same\nissue. Thus, if the TTAB does not consider the market-\nplace usage of the parties\u2019 marks, the TTAB\u2019s decision\nshould \u201chave no later preclusive effect in a suit where\nactual usage in the marketplace is the paramount issue.\u201d\n6 McCarthy \u00a732:101, at 32\u2013246.\n   Materiality, of course, is essential\u2014trivial variations\nbetween the usages set out in an application and the use\nof a mark in the marketplace do not create different \u201cis-\nsues,\u201d just as trivial variations do not create different\n\u201cmarks.\u201d See generally 4 id., \u00a723:50, at 23\u2013265 (explain-\ning that \u201cadding descriptive or non-distinctive\u201d elements\nto another\u2019s mark generally will not negate confusion).\nOtherwise, a party could escape the preclusive effect of an\nadverse judgment simply by adding an immaterial feature\nto its mark. That is not the law. See, e.g., Restatement\n(Second) of Judgments \u00a727, Comment c, at 252\u2013253 (ex-\nplaining that \u201cissue\u201d must be understood broadly enough\n\u201cto prevent repetitious litigation of what is essentially the\nsame dispute\u201d); United States v.

We do\nnot resolve that dispute here. Suffice it to say that when the TTAB\nadjudicates a usage within its authority, that adjudication can ground\nissue preclusion. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a711 (1980).\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Needless to say,\nmoreover, if the TTAB has not decided the same issue as\nthat before the district court, there is no reason why any\ndeference would be warranted.\n  For a similar reason, the Eighth Circuit erred in holding\nthat issue preclusion could not apply here because the\nTTAB relied too heavily on \u201cappearance and sound.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 10a. Undoubtedly there are cases in\nwhich the TTAB places more weight on certain factors\nthan it should. When that happens, an aggrieved party\nshould seek judicial review. The fact that the TTAB may\nhave erred, however, does not prevent preclusion. As\nJudge Colloton observed in dissent, \u201c \u2018issue preclusion\nprevent[s] relitigation of wrong decisions just as much as\nright ones.\u2019 \u201d 716 F. 3d, at 1029 (quoting Clark v. Clark,\n984 F. 2d 272, 273 (CA8 1993)); see also Restatement\n(Second) of Judgments \u00a728, Comment j, at 284 (explaining\nthat \u201crefusal to give the first judgment preclusive effect\nshould not . . . be based simply on a conclusion that [it]\nwas patently erroneous\u201d).\n                              B\n   Hargis also argues that registration is categorically\nincompatible with issue preclusion because the TTAB uses\nprocedures that differ from those used by district courts.\nGranted, \u201c[r]edetermination of issues is warranted if there\nis reason to doubt the quality, extensiveness, or fairness of\nprocedures followed in prior litigation.\u201d Montana, 440\nU. S., at 164, n. 11; see also Parklane Hosiery, 439 U. S.,\nat 331, and n. 15 (similar). But again, this only suggests\nthat sometimes issue preclusion might be inappropriate,\nnot that it always is.\n   No one disputes that the TTAB and district courts use\ndifferent procedures. Most notably, district courts feature\n20    B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlive witnesses. Procedural differences, by themselves,\nhowever, do not defeat issue preclusion. Equity courts\nused different procedures than did law courts, but that did\nnot bar issue preclusion. See id., at 333. Nor is there\nreason to think that the state agency in Elliott used proce-\ndures identical to those in federal court; nonetheless, the\nCourt held that preclusion could apply. See 478 U. S., at\n796\u2013799. Rather than focusing on whether procedural\ndifferences exist\u2014they often will\u2014the correct inquiry is\nwhether the procedures used in the first proceeding were\nfundamentally poor, cursory, or unfair. See Montana, 440\nU. S., at 164, n. 11.\n    Here, there is no categorical \u201creason to doubt the quality,\nextensiveness, or fairness,\u201d ibid., of the agency\u2019s proce-\ndures. In large part they are exactly the same as in fed-\neral court. See 37 CFR \u00a7\u00a72.116(a), 2.122(a). For instance,\nalthough the \u201c[t]he scope of discovery in Board proceedings\n. . . . is generally narrower than in court proceedings\u201d\u2014\nreflecting the fact that there are often fewer usages at\nissue\u2014the TTAB has adopted almost the whole of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 26. TTAB Manual \u00a7402.01; see\nalso id., \u00a7401. It is conceivable, of course, that the TTAB\u2019s\nprocedures may prove ill-suited for a particular issue in a\nparticular case, e.g., a party may have tried to introduce\nmaterial evidence but was prevented by the TTAB from\ndoing so, or the TTAB\u2019s bar on live testimony may materi-\nally prejudice a party\u2019s ability to present its case. The\nordinary law of issue preclusion, however, already ac-\ncounts for those \u201crare\u201d cases where a \u201ccompelling showing\nof unfairness\u201d can be made.

Hargis is wrong, however, that this exception\nto issue preclusion applies to every registration. To\nthe contrary: When registration is opposed, there is\ngood reason to think that both sides will take the matter\nseriously.\n   The benefits of registration are substantial. Registra-\ntion is \u201cprima facie evidence of the validity of the regis-\ntered mark,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71057(b), and is a precondition for\na mark to become \u201cincontestable,\u201d \u00a71065. Incontestability\nis a powerful protection. See, e.g., Park \u2019N Fly, Inc. v.\nDollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985) (holding\nthat an incontestable mark cannot be challenged as merely\ndescriptive); see also id., at 193 (explaining that \u201cCon-\ngress determined that . . . \u2018trademarks should receive\nnationally the greatest protection that can be given them\u2019 \u201d\nand that \u201c[a]mong the new protections created by the\nLanham Act were the statutory provisions that allow a\nfederally registered mark to become incontestable\u201d (quot-\ning S.

That presumption was first announced in\npoorly supported dictum in a 1991 decision of this Court,\nand we have not applied it since. Whatever the validity of\nthat presumption with respect to statutes enacted after its\ncreation, there is no justification for applying it to the\nLanham Act, passed in 1946. Seeing no other reason to\nconclude that Congress implicitly authorized the decisions\nof the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) to have\npreclusive effect in a subsequent trademark infringement\nsuit, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n                           I\n\n                           A\n\n  The presumption in favor of administrative preclusion\nthe Court applies today was first announced in Astoria\nFed.

That dictum rested on two premises. First, that \u201cCon-\ngress is understood to legislate against a background of\ncommon-law adjudicatory principles.\u201d Id., at 108. And,\nsecond, that the Court had \u201clong favored application of\nthe common-law doctrines of collateral estoppel (as to\nissues) and res judicata (as to claims) to those determina-\ntions of administrative bodies that have attained finality.\u201d\nId., at 107.\n   I do not quarrel with the first premise, but I have seri-\nous doubts about the second. The Court in Astoria offered\nonly one decision predating the enactment of the ADEA to\nshore up its assertion that Congress had legislated against\na background principle in favor of administrative preclu-\nsion\u2014United States v.

The case arose out of a\ncontract dispute between the United States and a private\ncontractor. 384 U. S., at 400. The contract at issue con-\ntained a disputes clause providing for an administrative\nprocess by which \u201c \u2018disputes concerning questions of fact\narising under th[e] contract\u2019 \u201d would be decided by the\ncontracting officer, subject to written appeal to the head of\nthe department. Id., at 397\u2013398. The Wunderlich Act of\n1954 likewise provided that such administrative factfind-\ning would be \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d in a later breach-of-\ncontract action \u201c \u2018unless the same is fra[u]dulent or capri-\ncious or arbitrary or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to\nimply bad faith, or is not supported by substantial evi-\ndence.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 399. Because both \u201cthe disputes clause [of\nthe contract] and the Wunderlich Act categorically state[d]\nthat administrative findings on factual issues relevant to\nquestions arising under the contract [would] be final and\nconclusive on the parties,\u201d the Court required the lower\ncourts to accept those findings. Id., at 419. Only after\nacknowledging that its decision \u201crest[ed] upon the agree-\nment of the parties as modified by the Wunderlich Act\u201d did\nthe Court go on to comment that the decision was \u201charmo-\nnious with general principles of collateral estoppel.\u201d Id.,\nat 421.\n   To create a presumption based solely on dictum would\nbe bad enough, but the principles Utah Construction re-\nferred to were far too equivocal to constitute \u201clong-\nestablished and familiar\u201d background principles of the\ncommon law of the sort on which we base our statutory\ninferences. Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U. S. 779, 783\n(1952).

This broad definition\nserved the interest in finality that supports preclusion\ndoctrines, without which \u201can end could never be put to\nlitigation.\u201d Id., at 114.\n   But however broadly \u201c[c]ourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d\nwas defined, it would require quite a leap to say that the\nconcept encompasses administrative agencies, which were\nrecognized as categorically different from courts. E.g.,\nPearson v. Williams, 202 U. S. 281 (1906); F. Cooper,\nAdministrative Agencies and the Courts 241\u2013242 (1951)\n(taking the position that agencies \u201care not courts, and\ntheir determinations are not judgments\u201d). This distinction\nstems from the Constitution itself, which vests the \u201cjudi-\ncial Power\u201d not in administrative agencies, but in federal\ncourts, whose independence is safeguarded by certain\nconstitutional requirements. Art. III, \u00a71. One of the\nconsequences of this allocation of judicial power is that\nagencies possess limited ability to act in a judicial capacity\nin cases resolving traditional disputes between private\nparties. See infra, at 11\u201312.\n   It is therefore unsurprising that federal courts\u2014\nincluding this Court\u2014have been far more hesitant than\ntoday\u2019s majority to extend common-law preclusion princi-\nples to decisions of administrative tribunals. In Pearson,\nfor example, this Court declined to recognize any preclu-\nsive effect of a decision of an immigration board. 202\nU. S., at 284\u2013285. Writing for the Court, Justice Holmes\nexplained that \u201c[t]he board is an instrument of the execu-\ntive power, not a court\u201d; that it consisted of officials\n\u201cwhose duties are declared to be administrative by\u201d stat-\nute; and that \u201c[d]ecisions of a similar type long have been\nrecognized as decisions of the executive department, and\ncannot constitute res judicata in a technical sense.\u201d Ibid.\n   Other courts likewise declined to apply general preclu-\nsion principles to decisions of administrative agencies.\nFor example, as late as 1947, the D. C. Circuit would rely\n6      B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\non the \u201cwell settled doctrine that res judicata and equita-\nble estoppel do not ordinarily apply to decisions of admin-\nistrative tribunals.\u201d Churchill Tabernacle v. FCC, 160\nF. 2d 244, 246 (1947).\n   The Restatement of Judgments also reflected this prac-\ntice: It contained no provision for administrative preclu-\nsion and explained that it would not address \u201cthe effect of\nthe decisions of administrative tribunals.\u201d Restatement of\nJudgments, Scope Note, at 2. It rejected the idea of any\nconsistent practice in favor of administrative preclusion,\nnoting that \u201cthe question whether the decisions of a par-\nticular tribunal are binding in subsequent controversies\ndepends upon the character of the tribunal and the nature\nof its procedure and the construction of the statute creat-\ning the tribunal and conferring powers upon it.\u201d Ibid.\n   Consistent with that comment, federal courts approved\nof administrative preclusion in narrow circumstances\narguably involving only claims against the Government,\nover which Congress exercises a broader measure of con-\ntrol.2 In the 19th century, for instance, this Court effec-\ntively gave preclusive effect to the decisions of the U. S.\nLand Department with respect to land patents when it\nheld such patents unreviewable in federal court \u201cfor mere\nerrors of judgment.\u201d Smelting Co. v. Kemp, 104 U.

As one commentator put it, res judicata\ncould \u201cnot apply, in any strict or technical sense, to the\ndecisions of administrative agencies.\u201d Cooper, supra, at\n241.\n   This history undercuts any suggestion in Utah Con-\nstruction that administrative preclusion was widely ac-\ncepted at common law. Accordingly, at least for statutes\npassed before Astoria, I would reject the presumption of\nadministrative preclusion.3\n                              II\nIn light of this history, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s\ndecision to apply administrative preclusion in the context\nof the Lanham Act.4 To start, the Lanham Act was en-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 I have no occasion to consider whether the discussion in Astoria,\n\nElliott, or Utah Construction could be understood to create a back-\nground principle in favor of administrative preclusion that would apply,\nas a matter of statutory interpretation, to statutes passed after those\ndecisions.\n   4 The majority insists that we must apply the presumption of admin-\n\nistrative preclusion because the Court has \u201crepeatedly endorsed Utah\nConstruction\u201d and the parties do not challenge \u201cits historical accuracy.\u201d\nAnte, at 12, n. 2. But regardless of whether the Court has endorsed\nUtah Construction\u2019s dictum, the Court has never applied the presump-\ntion of administrative preclusion to the Lanham Act. Even if the\nCourt\u2019s description of the presumption were not dictum, no principle of\nstare decisis requires us to extend a tool of statutory interpretation\nfrom one statute to another without first considering whether it is\nappropriate for that statute. Cf. CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553\nU. S. 442, 469\u2013470 (2008) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (\u201c[S]tare decisis,\n8      B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nacted in 1946, 20 years before this Court said\u2014even in dic-\ntum\u2014that administrative preclusion was an established\ncommon-law principle. Thus, even if one thought that the\ndictum in Utah Construction were sufficient to establish a\ncommon-law principle in favor of preclusion, that conclu-\nsion would not warrant applying Astoria\u2019s presumption to\nthis enactment from the 1940\u2019s. And, construing the Act\non its own terms, I see no reason to conclude that Con-\ngress intended administrative preclusion to apply to TTAB\nfindings of fact in a subsequent trademark infringement\nsuit. The Act says nothing to indicate such an intent, and\nseveral features of the Act support the contrary inference.\n   The first feature indicating that Congress did not intend\npreclusion to apply is the limited authority the Act gives\nthe TTAB. The Act authorizes the TTAB only to \u201cdeter-\nmine and decide the respective rights of [trademark]\nregistration,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71067(a), thereby withholding\nany authority from the TTAB to \u201cdetermine the right to\nuse\u201d a trademark or to \u201cdecide broader questions of in-\nfringement or unfair competition,\u201d TTAB Manual of Pro-\ncedure \u00a7102.01 (2014). This limited job description indi-\ncates that TTAB\u2019s conclusions regarding registration were\nnever meant to become decisive\u2014through application of\nadministrative preclusion\u2014in subsequent infringement\nsuits. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71115(a) (providing that registration\nof a mark \u201cshall be prima facie evidence of the validity of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndesigned to be a principle of stability or repose, [should not] become a\nvehicle of change whereby an error in one area metastasizes into\nothers, thereby distorting the law\u201d). As for the parties\u2019 lack of argu-\nment, I would not treat tools of statutory interpretation as claims that\ncan be forfeited. If, for example, one party peppered its brief with\nlegislative history, and the opposing party did not challenge the propri-\nety of using legislative history, I still would not consider myself bound\nto rely upon it. The same is true here: Although the Court has com-\nmented in the past that the presumption of administrative preclusion\nwould apply to other statutes, we are not bound to apply it now to the\nLanham Act, even if the parties have assumed we would.\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                9\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe registered mark\u201d but \u201cshall not preclude another\nperson from proving any legal or equitable defense or\ndefect\u201d). Giving preclusive effect to the TTAB\u2019s decision on\nlikelihood of confusion would be an end-run around the\nstatutory limitation on its authority, as all parties agree\nthat likelihood of confusion is the central issue in a subse-\nquent infringement suit.\n   A second indication that Congress did not intend admin-\nistrative preclusion to apply is the Lanham Act\u2019s provision\nfor judicial review. After the TTAB issues a registration\ndecision, a party \u201cwho is dissatisfied with the decision\u201d\nmay either appeal to the Federal Circuit or file a civil\naction in district court seeking review. \u00a7\u00a71071(a)(1),\n(b)(1).5 And it is undisputed that a civil action in district\ncourt would entail de novo review of the TTAB\u2019s decision.\nAnte, at 5. Although under ordinary preclusion principles\n\u201cthe failure to pursue an appeal does not undermine issue\npreclusion,\u201d ante, at 13, the availability of de novo judicial\nreview of an administrative decision does. That is true\nboth because the judicial review afforded by the Act marks\nthe first opportunity for consideration of the issue by an\nArticle III court and because Congress has deviated from\nthe usual practice of affording deference to the factfind-\nings of an initial tribunal in affording de novo review of\nthe TTAB\u2019s decisions.\n   The decision to provide this de novo review is even more\nstriking in light of the historical background of the choice:\nCongress passed the Lanham Act the same year it passed\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, following a lengthy\nperiod of disagreement in the courts about what deference\nadministrative findings of fact were entitled to receive on\ndirect review. The issue had been the subject of debate for\nover 50 years, with varying results. See generally 2 J.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 5 The original 1946 Lanham Act provided for appeal to the Court of\n\nCustoms and Patent Appeals.

S. 114, 142 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in\nresult) (noting the \u201ccasuistic difficulties spawned\u201d in\nCrowell and the \u201cattritions of that case through later\ndecisions\u201d). Although Congress provided for substantial-\nevidence review in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(E), it required de novo review in the Lan-\nham Act.\n   I need not take a side in this historical debate about the\nproper level of review for administrative findings of fact to\nconclude that its existence provides yet another reason to\ndoubt that Congress intended administrative preclusion\nto apply to the Lanham Act.\n                             III\n  In addition to being unsupported by our precedents or\nhistorical evidence, the majority\u2019s application of adminis-\ntrative preclusion raises serious constitutional concerns.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015) \n         11\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\n                                A\n\n   Executive agencies derive their authority from Article II\nof the Constitution, which vests \u201c[t]he executive power\u201d in\n\u201ca President of the United States,\u201d Art. II, \u00a71, cl. 1. Execu-\ntive agencies are thus part of the political branches of\nGovernment and make decisions \u201cnot by fixed rules of law,\nbut by the application of governmental discretion or pol-\nicy.\u201d Dickinson, supra, at 35\u201336; see, e.g., Motor Vehicle\nMfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut.\nAutomobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 59 (1983) (Rehnquist, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (An agency \u201cis\nentitled to assess administrative records and evaluate\npriorities in light of the philosophy of the administration\u201d).\nThey are not constituted to exercise \u201cindependent judg-\nment,\u201d but to be responsive to the pressures of the political\nbranches. Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., ante, at 8\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Because federal administrative agencies are part of the\nExecutive Branch, it is not clear that they have power to\nadjudicate claims involving core private rights. Under our\nConstitution, the \u201cjudicial power\u201d belongs to Article III\ncourts and cannot be shared with the Legislature or the\nExecutive. Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___\n(2011) (slip op., at 16\u201317); see also Perez, ante, at 8\u201311\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.). And some historical evidence\nsuggests that the adjudication of core private rights is a\nfunction that can be performed only by Article III courts,\nat least absent the consent of the parties to adjudication in\nanother forum. See Nelson, Adjudication in the Political\nBranches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 561\u2013574 (2007) (here-\ninafter Nelson); see also Department of Transportation v.\nAssociation of American Railroads, ante, at 4 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (explaining that \u201cthere are cer-\ntain core functions\u201d that require the exercise of a particu-\nlar constitutional power and that only one branch can\nconstitutionally perform).\n12    B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    To the extent that administrative agencies could, con-\nsistent with the Constitution, function as courts, they\nmight only be able to do so with respect to claims involving\npublic or quasi-private rights. See Northern Pipeline\nConstr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 68\u201370\n(1982) (plurality opinion); see also Nelson 561\u2013574; Dick-\ninson, supra, at 6. Public rights are those belonging to the\npublic as a whole, see Nelson 566, whereas quasi-private\nrights, or statutory entitlements, are those \u201c \u2018privileges\u2019 \u201d or\n\u201c \u2018franchises\u2019 \u201d that are bestowed by the government on\nindividuals, id., at 567; see, e.g., Ex parte Bakelite Corp.,\n279 U. S. 438, 451 (1929) (discussing claims \u201carising be-\ntween the government and others, which from their na-\nture do not require judicial determination and yet are\nsusceptible of it\u201d).\n    The historical treatment of administrative preclusion is\nconsistent with this understanding. As discussed above,\nmost administrative adjudications that were given preclu-\nsive effect in Article III courts involved quasi-private\nrights like land grants. See Smelting Co., 104 U. S., at\n646. And in the context of land grants, this Court recog-\nnized that once \u201ctitle had passed from the government,\u201d a\nmore complete form of judicial review was available be-\ncause \u201cthe question became one of private right.\u201d Johnson\nv. Towsley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88438\"><a href=\"/opinion/88438/johnson-v-towsley/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87 (1871).\n    It is true that, in the New Deal era, the Court some-\ntimes gave preclusive effect to administrative findings of\nfact in tax cases, which could be construed to implicate\nprivate rights. See, e.g., Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v.\nAdkins, 310 U. S. 381, 401\u2013404 (1940); Tait v. Western\nMaryland R. Co., 289 U. S. 620, 622\u2013624 (1933). But\nadministrative tax determinations may simply have en-\njoyed a special historical status, in which case this practice\nmight be best understood as a limited deviation from a\ngeneral distinction between public and private rights. See\nNelson 588\u2013590.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             13\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                               B\n   Trademark registration under the Lanham Act has the\ncharacteristics of a quasi-private right. Registration is a\ncreature of the Lanham Act, which \u201cconfers important\nlegal rights and benefits on trademark owners who regis-\nter their marks.\u201d Ante, at 3 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Because registration is merely a statutory gov-\nernment entitlement, no one disputes that the TTAB may\nconstitutionally adjudicate a registration claim.          See\nStern, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 19); Nelson 568\u2013569.\n   By contrast, the right to adopt and exclusively use a\ntrademark appears to be a private property right that \u201chas\nbeen long recognized by the common law and the chancery\ncourts of England and of this country.\u201d Trade-Mark Cases,\n100 U. S. 82, 92 (1879). As this Court explained when\naddressing Congress\u2019 first trademark statute, enacted in\n1870, the exclusive right to use a trademark \u201cwas not\ncreated by the act of Congress, and does not now depend\nupon it for its enforcement.\u201d Ibid. \u201cThe whole system of\ntrade-mark property and the civil remedies for its protec-\ntion existed long anterior to that act, and have remained\nin full force since its passage.\u201d Ibid. Thus, it appears that\nthe trademark infringement suit at issue in this case\nmight be of a type that must be decided by \u201cArticle III\njudges in Article III courts.\u201d Stern, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18).\n   The majority, however, would have Article III courts\ndecide infringement claims where the central issue\u2014\nwhether there is a likelihood of consumer confusion be-\ntween two trademarks\u2014has already been decided by an\nexecutive agency. This raises two potential constitutional\nconcerns. First, it may deprive a trademark holder of the\nopportunity to have a core private right adjudicated in an\nArticle III court. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 21). Second, it\nmay effect a transfer of a core attribute of the judicial\npower to an executive agency. Cf. Perez, ante, at 10\u201312\n14    B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.) (explaining that interpretation of\nregulations having the force and effect of law is likely a\ncore attribute of the judicial power that cannot be trans-\nferred to an executive agency). Administrative preclusion\nthus threatens to \u201csap the judicial power as it exists under\nthe Federal Constitution, and to establish a government of\na bureaucratic character alien to our own system, wher-\never fundamental rights depend . . . upon the facts, and\nfinality as to facts becomes in effect finality in law.\u201d\nCrowell, 285 U. S., at 57.\n   At a minimum, this practice raises serious questions\nthat the majority does not adequately confront. The ma-\njority does not address the distinction between private\nrights and public rights or the nature of the power exer-\ncised by an administrative agency when adjudicating facts\nin private-rights disputes. And it fails to consider whether\napplying administrative preclusion to a core factual de-\ntermination in a private-rights dispute comports with the\nseparation of powers.\n                        *    *    *\n  I would hold that the TTAB\u2019s trademark-registration\ndecisions are not entitled to preclusive effect in a subse-\nquent infringement suit. The common law does not sup-\nport a general presumption in favor of administrative\npreclusion for statutes passed before this Court\u2019s decision\nin Astoria, and the text, structure, and history of the\nLanham Act provide no support for such preclusion. I\ndisagree with the majority\u2019s willingness to endorse Asto-\nria\u2019s unfounded presumption and to apply it to an adjudi-\ncation in a private-rights dispute, as that analysis raises\nserious constitutional questions. Because I can resolve\nthis case on statutory grounds, however, I leave these\nquestions for another day. I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
