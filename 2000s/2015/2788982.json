UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12\u20131226. Argued December 3, 2014\u2014Decided March 25, 2015\nThe Pregnancy Discrimination Act added new language to the defini-\n  tions subsection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The first\n  clause of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act specifies that Title VII\u2019s\n  prohibition against sex discrimination applies to discrimination \u201cbe-\n  cause of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical\n  conditions.\u201d 42 U. S. C \u00a72000e(k). The Act\u2019s second clause says that\n  employers must treat \u201cwomen affected by pregnancy . . . the same for\n  all employment-related purposes . . . as other persons not so affected\n  but similar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d Ibid. This case asks\n  the Court to determine how the latter provision applies in the context\n  of an employer\u2019s policy that accommodates many, but not all, workers\n  with nonpregnancy-related disabilities.\n     Petitioner Young was a part-time driver for respondent United\n  Parcel Service (UPS). When she became pregnant, her doctor advised\n  her that she should not lift more than 20 pounds. UPS, however, re-\n  quired drivers like Young to be able to lift up to 70 pounds. UPS told\n  Young that she could not work while under a lifting restriction.\n  Young subsequently filed this federal lawsuit, claiming that UPS act-\n  ed unlawfully in refusing to accommodate her pregnancy-related lift-\n  ing restriction. She brought only a disparate-treatment claim of dis-\n  crimination, which a plaintiff can prove either by direct evidence that\n  a workplace policy, practice, or decision relies expressly on a protect-\n  ed characteristic, or by using the burden-shifting framework set forth\n  in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792. Under that\n  framework, the plaintiff has \u201cthe initial burden\u201d of \u201cestablishing a\n  prima facie case\u201d of discrimination. Id., at 802. If she carries her\n  burden, the employer must have an opportunity \u201cto articulate some\n  legitimate, non-discriminatory reason[s] for\u201d the difference in treat-\n2           YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n ment. Ibid. If the employer articulates such reasons, the plaintiff\n then has \u201can opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n that the reasons . . . were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d Texas Dept.\n of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 253.\n    After discovery, UPS sought summary judgment. In reply, Young\n presented several favorable facts that she believed she could prove.\n In particular, she pointed to UPS policies that accommodated work-\n ers who were injured on the job, had disabilities covered by the Amer-\n icans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), or had lost Department of\n Transportation (DOT) certifications. Pursuant to these policies,\n Young contended, UPS had accommodated several individuals whose\n disabilities created work restrictions similar to hers. She argued that\n these policies showed that UPS discriminated against its pregnant\n employees because it had a light-duty-for-injury policy for numerous\n \u201cother persons,\u201d but not for pregnant workers. UPS responded that,\n since Young did not fall within the on-the-job injury, ADA, or DOT\n categories, it had not discriminated against Young on the basis of\n pregnancy, but had treated her just as it treated all \u201cother\u201d relevant\n \u201cpersons.\u201d\n    The District Court granted UPS summary judgment, concluding,\n inter alia, that Young could not make out a prima facie case of dis-\n crimination under McDonnell Douglas. The court found that those\n with whom Young had compared herself\u2014those falling within the on-\n the-job, DOT, or ADA categories\u2014were too different to qualify as\n \u201csimilarly situated comparator[s].\u201d The Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. An individual pregnant worker who seeks to show disparate\n treatment through indirect evidence may do so through application of\n the McDonnell Douglas framework. Pp. 10\u201323.\n       (a) The parties\u2019 interpretations of the Pregnancy Discrimination\n Act\u2019s second clause are unpersuasive. Pp. 12\u201320.\n         (i) Young claims that as long as \u201can employer accommodates\n only a subset of workers with disabling conditions,\u201d \u201cpregnant work-\n ers who are similar in the ability to work [must] receive the same\n treatment even if still other nonpregnant workers do not receive ac-\n commodations.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 28. Her reading proves too\n much. The Court doubts that Congress intended to grant pregnant\n workers an unconditional \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d status, such that\n employers who provide one or two workers with an accommodation\n must provide similar accommodations to all pregnant workers, irre-\n spective of any other criteria. After all, the second clause of the Act,\n when referring to nonpregnant persons with similar disabilities, uses\n the open-ended term \u201cother persons.\u201d It does not say that the em-\n ployer must treat pregnant employees the \u201csame\u201d as \u201cany other per-\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsons\u201d who are similar in their ability or inability to work, nor does it\nspecify the particular \u201cother persons\u201d Congress had in mind as ap-\npropriate comparators for pregnant workers. Moreover, disparate-\ntreatment law normally allows an employer to implement policies\nthat are not intended to harm members of a protected class, even if\ntheir implementation sometimes harms those members, as long as\nthe employer has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual rea-\nson for doing so. See, e.g., Burdine, supra, at 252\u2013258. There is no\nreason to think Congress intended its language in the Pregnancy\nDiscrimination Act to deviate from that approach. Pp. 12\u201314.\n       (ii) The Solicitor General argues that the Court should give\nspecial, if not controlling, weight to a 2014 Equal Employment Op-\nportunity Commission guideline concerning the application of Title\nVII and the ADA to pregnant employees. But that guideline lacks\nthe timing, \u201cconsistency,\u201d and \u201cthoroughness\u201d of \u201cconsideration\u201d nec-\nessary to \u201cgive it power to persuade.\u201d Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323\nU. S. 134, 140. The guideline was promulgated after certiorari was\ngranted here; it takes a position on which previous EEOC guidelines\nwere silent; it is inconsistent with positions long advocated by the\nGovernment; and the EEOC does not explain the basis for its latest\nguidance. Pp. 14\u201317.\n       (iii) UPS claims that the Act\u2019s second clause simply defines sex\ndiscrimination to include pregnancy discrimination. But that cannot\nbe right, as the first clause of the Act accomplishes that objective.\nReading the Act\u2019s second clause as UPS proposes would thus render\nthe first clause superfluous. It would also fail to carry out a key con-\ngressional objective in passing the Act. The Act was intended to\noverturn the holding and the reasoning of General Elec. Co. v. Gil-\nbert, 429 U. S. 125, which upheld against a Title VII challenge a\ncompany plan that provided nonoccupational sickness and accident\nbenefits to all employees but did not provide disability-benefit pay-\nments for any absence due to pregnancy. Pp. 17\u201320.\n     (b) An individual pregnant worker who seeks to show disparate\ntreatment may make out a prima facie case under the McDonnell\nDouglas framework by showing that she belongs to the protected\nclass, that she sought accommodation, that the employer did not ac-\ncommodate her, and that the employer did accommodate others \u201csim-\nilar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d The employer may then\nseek to justify its refusal to accommodate the plaintiff by relying on\n\u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory\u201d reasons for denying accommodation.\nThat reason normally cannot consist simply of a claim that it is more\nexpensive or less convenient to add pregnant women to the category\nof those whom the employer accommodates. If the employer offers a\n\u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory\u201d reason, the plaintiff may show that it\n4             YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    is in fact pretextual. The plaintiff may reach a jury on this issue by\n    providing sufficient evidence that the employer\u2019s policies impose a\n    significant burden on pregnant workers, and that the employer\u2019s \u201cle-\n    gitimate, nondiscriminatory\u201d reasons are not sufficiently strong to\n    justify the burden, but rather\u2014when considered along with the bur-\n    den imposed\u2014give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.\n    The plaintiff can create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n    a significant burden exists by providing evidence that the employer\n    accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnant workers while fail-\n    ing to accommodate a large percentage of pregnant workers. This\n    approach is consistent with the longstanding rule that a plaintiff can\n    use circumstantial proof to rebut an employer\u2019s apparently legiti-\n    mate, nondiscriminatory reasons, see Burdine, supra, at 255, n. 10,\n    and with Congress\u2019 intent to overrule Gilbert. Pp. 20\u201323.\n       2. Under this interpretation of the Act, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s judg-\n    ment must be vacated. Summary judgment is appropriate when\n    there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ.\n    Proc. 56(a). The record here shows that Young created a genuine\n    dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at\n    least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distin-\n    guished from hers. It is left to the Fourth Circuit to determine on\n    remand whether Young also created a genuine issue of material fact\n    as to whether UPS\u2019 reasons for having treated Young less favorably\n    than these other nonpregnant employees were pretextual.

UNITED PARCEL \n\n                SERVICE, INC. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [March 25, 2015]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Pregnancy Discrimination Act makes clear that\nTitle VII\u2019s prohibition against sex discrimination applies\nto discrimination based on pregnancy. It also says that\nemployers must treat \u201cwomen affected by pregnancy . . .\nthe same for all employment-related purposes . . . as other\npersons not so affected but similar in their ability or in-\nability to work.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e(k). We must decide\nhow this latter provision applies in the context of an em-\nployer\u2019s policy that accommodates many, but not all,\nworkers with nonpregnancy-related disabilities.\n  In our view, the Act requires courts to consider the\nextent to which an employer\u2019s policy treats pregnant\nworkers less favorably than it treats nonpregnant workers\nsimilar in their ability or inability to work. And here\u2014as\nin all cases in which an individual plaintiff seeks to show\ndisparate treatment through indirect evidence\u2014it re-\nquires courts to consider any legitimate, nondiscrimina-\ntory, nonpretextual justification for these differences in\ntreatment. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\nU. S. 792, 802 (1973). Ultimately the court must deter-\n2         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmine whether the nature of the employer\u2019s policy and the\nway in which it burdens pregnant women shows that the\nemployer has engaged in intentional discrimination. The\nCourt of Appeals here affirmed a grant of summary judg-\nment in favor of the employer. Given our view of the law,\nwe must vacate that court\u2019s judgment.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n    We begin with a summary of the facts. The petitioner,\nPeggy Young, worked as a part-time driver for the re-\nspondent, United Parcel Service (UPS). Her responsibili-\nties included pickup and delivery of packages that had\narrived by air carrier the previous night. In 2006, after\nsuffering several miscarriages, she became pregnant. Her\ndoctor told her that she should not lift more than 20\npounds during the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy or more\nthan 10 pounds thereafter. App. 580. UPS required driv-\ners like Young to be able to lift parcels weighing up to 70\npounds (and up to 150 pounds with assistance). Id., at\n578. UPS told Young she could not work while under a\nlifting restriction. Young consequently stayed home with-\nout pay during most of the time she was pregnant and\neventually lost her employee medical coverage.\n   Young subsequently brought this federal lawsuit. We\nfocus here on her claim that UPS acted unlawfully in\nrefusing to accommodate her pregnancy-related lifting\nrestriction. Young said that her co-workers were willing\nto help her with heavy packages. She also said that UPS\naccommodated other drivers who were \u201csimilar in their . . .\ninability to work.\u201d She accordingly concluded that UPS\nmust accommodate her as well. See Brief for Petitioner\n30\u201331.\n   UPS responded that the \u201cother persons\u201d whom it had\naccommodated were (1) drivers who had become disabled\non the job, (2) those who had lost their Department of\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nTransportation (DOT) certifications, and (3) those who\nsuffered from a disability covered by the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 327, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a712101 et seq. UPS said that, since Young did not fall\nwithin any of those categories, it had not discriminated\nagainst Young on the basis of pregnancy but had treated\nher just as it treated all \u201cother\u201d relevant \u201cpersons.\u201d See\nBrief for Respondent 34.\n                                B\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids a covered\nemployer to \u201cdiscriminate against any individual with\nrespect to . . . terms, conditions, or privileges of employ-\nment, because of such individual\u2019s . . . sex.\u201d 78 Stat. 253,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). In 1978, Congress enacted the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act, 92 Stat. 2076, which added\nnew language to Title VII\u2019s definitions subsection. The\nfirst clause of the 1978 Act specifies that Title VII\u2019s\n\u201cter[m] \u2018because of sex\u2019 . . . include[s] . . . because of or on\nthe basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical\nconditions.\u201d \u00a72000e(k). The second clause says that\n    \u201cwomen affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related\n    medical conditions shall be treated the same for all\n    employment-related purposes . . . as other persons not\n    so affected but similar in their ability or inability to\n    work . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n   This case requires us to consider the application of the\nsecond clause to a \u201cdisparate-treatment\u201d claim\u2014a claim\nthat an employer intentionally treated a complainant less\nfavorably than employees with the \u201ccomplainant\u2019s qualifi-\ncations\u201d but outside the complainant\u2019s protected class.\nMcDonnell Douglas, supra, at 802. We have said that\n\u201c[l]iability in a disparate-treatment case depends on\nwhether the protected trait actually motivated the em-\nployer\u2019s decision.\u201d Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U. S.\n4         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n44, 52 (2003) (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omit-\nted). We have also made clear that a plaintiff can prove\ndisparate treatment either (1) by direct evidence that a\nworkplace policy, practice, or decision relies expressly on a\nprotected characteristic, or (2) by using the burden-\nshifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas. See\nTrans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 121\n(1985).\n  In McDonnell Douglas, we considered a claim of discrim-\ninatory hiring. We said that, to prove disparate treat-\nment, an individual plaintiff must \u201ccarry the initial bur-\nden\u201d of \u201cestablishing a prima facie case\u201d of discrimination\nby showing\n    \u201c(i) that he belongs to a . . . minority; (ii) that he ap-\n    plied and was qualified for a job for which the employer\n    was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his quali-\n    fications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his\n    rejection, the position remained open and the employer\n    continued to seek applicants from persons of com-\n    plainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d 411 U. S., at 802.\nIf a plaintiff makes this showing, then the employer must\nhave an opportunity \u201cto articulate some legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory reason for\u201d treating employees outside the\nprotected class better than employees within the protected\nclass. Ibid. If the employer articulates such a reason, the\nplaintiff then has \u201can opportunity to prove by a prepon-\nderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered\nby the defendant [i.e., the employer] were not its true\nreasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d Texas\nDept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 253\n(1981).\n   We note that employment discrimination law also cre-\nates what is called a \u201cdisparate-impact\u201d claim. In evaluat-\ning a disparate-impact claim, courts focus on the effects of\nan employment practice, determining whether they are\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunlawful irrespective of motivation or intent. See Raytheon,\nsupra, at 52\u201353; see also Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S.\n557, 578 (2009). But Young has not alleged a disparate-\nimpact claim.\n   Nor has she asserted what we have called a \u201cpattern-or-\npractice\u201d claim. See Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S.\n324, 359 (1977) (explaining that Title VII plaintiffs who\nallege a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of discrimination may estab-\nlish a prima facie case by \u201canother means\u201d); see also id., at\n357 (rejecting contention that the \u201cburden of proof in a\npattern-or-practice case must be equivalent to that out-\nlined in McDonnell Douglas\u201d).\n                            C\n  In July 2007, Young filed a pregnancy discrimination\ncharge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-\nsion (EEOC). In September 2008, the EEOC provided her\nwith a right-to-sue letter. See 29 CFR \u00a71601.28 (2014).\nYoung then filed this complaint in Federal District Court.\nShe argued, among other things, that she could show by\ndirect evidence that UPS had intended to discriminate\nagainst her because of her pregnancy and that, in any\nevent, she could establish a prima facie case of disparate\ntreatment under the McDonnell Douglas framework. See\nApp. 60\u201362.\n  After discovery, UPS filed a motion for summary judg-\nment. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a). In reply, Young\npointed to favorable facts that she believed were either\nundisputed or that, while disputed, she could prove. They\ninclude the following:\n   1. Young worked as a UPS driver, picking up and de-\n      livering packages carried by air.

UPS\u2019 occupational health manager, the official \u201cre-\n       sponsible for most issues relating to employee\n       health and ability to work\u201d at Young\u2019s UPS facility,\n       App. 568\u2013569, told Young that she could not return\n       to work during her pregnancy because she could\n       not satisfy UPS\u2019 lifting requirements, see Memo-\n       randum 17\u221218; 2011 WL 665321, *5 (D Md., Feb.\n       14, 2011).\n    6. The manager also determined that Young did not\n       qualify for a temporary alternative work assign-\n       ment. Ibid.; see also Memorandum 19\u201320.\n    7. UPS, in a collective-bargaining agreement, had\n       promised to provide temporary alternative work\n       assignments to employees \u201cunable to perform their\n       normal work assignments due to an on-the-job in-\n       jury.\u201d App. 547 (emphasis added); see also Memo-\n       randum 8, 45\u201346.\n    8. The collective-bargaining agreement also provided\n       that UPS would \u201cmake a good faith effort to comply\n       . . . with requests for a reasonable accommodation\n       because of a permanent disability\u201d under the ADA.\n       App. 548; see also Memorandum 7.\n    9. The agreement further stated that UPS would give\n       \u201cinside\u201d jobs to drivers who had lost their DOT cer-\n       tifications because of a failed medical exam, a lost\n       driver\u2019s license, or involvement in a motor vehicle\n       accident.

When Young later asked UPS\u2019 Capital Division\n       Manager to accommodate her disability, he replied\n       that, while she was pregnant, she was \u201ctoo much of\n       a liability\u201d and could \u201cnot come back\u201d until she\n       \u201c \u2018was no longer pregnant.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 20.\n   11. Young remained on a leave of absence (without\n       pay) for much of her pregnancy. Id., at 49.\n   12. Young returned to work as a driver in June 2007,\n       about two months after her baby was born. Id., at\n       21, 61.\n  As direct evidence of intentional discrimination, Young\nrelied, in significant part, on the statement of the Capital\nDivision Manager (10 above). As evidence that she had\nmade out a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas,\nYoung relied, in significant part, on evidence showing that\nUPS would accommodate workers injured on the job (7),\nthose suffering from ADA disabilities (8), and those who\nhad lost their DOT certifications (9). That evidence, she\nsaid, showed that UPS had a light-duty-for-injury policy\nwith respect to numerous \u201cother persons,\u201d but not with\nrespect to pregnant workers. See Memorandum 29.\n  Young introduced further evidence indicating that UPS\nhad accommodated several individuals when they suffered\ndisabilities that created work restrictions similar to hers.\nUPS contests the correctness of some of these facts and\nthe relevance of others. See Brief for Respondent 5, 6, 57.\nBut because we are at the summary judgment stage, and\nbecause there is a genuine dispute as to these facts, we\nview this evidence in the light most favorable to Young,\nthe nonmoving party, see Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372,\n380 (2007):\n   13. Several employees received accommodations while\n       suffering various similar or more serious disabili-\n       ties incurred on the job. See App. 400\u2013401 (10\u2013\n       pound lifting limitation); id., at 635 (foot injury);\n8          YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n        id., at 637 (arm injury).\n    14. Several employees received accommodations follow-\n        ing injury, where the record is unclear as to whether\n        the injury was incurred on or off the job. See id.,\n        at 381 (recurring knee injury); id., at 655 (ankle in-\n        jury); id., at 655 (knee injury); id., at 394\u2212398\n        (stroke); id., at 425, 636\u2013637 (leg injury).\n    15. Several employees received \u201cinside\u201d jobs after los-\n        ing their DOT certifications. See id., at 372 (DOT\n        certification suspended after conviction for driv-\n        ing under the influence); id., at 636, 647 (failed\n        DOT test due to high blood pressure); id., at 640\u2013\n        641 (DOT certification lost due to sleep apnea\n        diagnosis).\n    16. Some employees were accommodated despite the\n        fact that their disabilities had been incurred off the\n        job. See id., at 446 (ankle injury); id., at 433, 635\u2013\n        636 (cancer).\n    17. According to a deposition of a UPS shop steward\n        who had worked for UPS for roughly a decade, id.,\n        at 461, 463, \u201cthe only light duty requested [due to\n        physical] restrictions that became an issue\u201d at UPS\n        \u201cwere with women who were pregnant,\u201d id., at 504.\n   The District Court granted UPS\u2019 motion for summary\njudgment. It concluded that Young could not show inten-\ntional discrimination through direct evidence. 2011 WL\n665321, *10\u2212*12. Nor could she make out a prima facie\ncase of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas. The\ncourt wrote that those with whom Young compared her-\nself\u2014those falling within the on-the-job, DOT, or ADA\ncategories\u2014were too different to qualify as \u201csimilarly\nsituated comparator[s].\u201d 2011 WL 665321, *14. The court\nadded that, in any event, UPS had offered a legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason for failing to accommodate\npregnant women, and Young had not created a genuine\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nissue of material fact as to whether that reason was pre-\ntextual. Id., at *15.\n   On appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed. It wrote that\n\u201cUPS has crafted a pregnancy-blind policy\u201d that is \u201cat\nleast facially a \u2018neutral and legitimate business practice,\u2019\nand not evidence of UPS\u2019s discriminatory animus toward\npregnant workers.\u201d 707 F. 3d 437, 446 (2013). It also\nagreed with the District Court that Young could not show\nthat \u201csimilarly-situated employees outside the protected\nclass received more favorable treatment than Young.\u201d Id.,\nat 450. Specifically, it believed that Young was different\nfrom those workers who were \u201cdisabled under the ADA\u201d\n(which then protected only those with permanent disabili-\nties) because Young was \u201cnot disabled\u201d; her lifting limita-\ntion was only \u201ctemporary and not a significant restriction\non her ability to perform major life activities.\u201d Ibid.\nYoung was also different from those workers who had lost\ntheir DOT certifications because \u201cno legal obstacle stands\nbetween her and her work\u201d and because many with lost\nDOT certifications retained physical (i.e., lifting) capacity\nthat Young lacked. Ibid. And Young was different from\nthose \u201cinjured on the job because, quite simply, her inabil-\nity to work [did] not arise from an on-the-job injury.\u201d Id.,\nat 450\u2013451. Rather, Young more closely resembled \u201can\nemployee who injured his back while picking up his infant\nchild or . . . an employee whose lifting limitation arose\nfrom her off-the-job work as a volunteer firefighter,\u201d nei-\nther of whom would have been eligible for accommodation\nunder UPS\u2019 policies. Id., at 448.\n   Young filed a petition for certiorari essentially asking us\nto review the Fourth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the Preg-\nnancy Discrimination Act. In light of lower-court uncer-\ntainty about the interpretation of the Act, we granted the\npetition. Compare Ensley-Gaines v. Runyon, 100 F. 3d\n1220, 1226 (CA6 1996), with Urbano v. Continental Air-\nlines, Inc., 138 F. 3d 204, 206\u2013208 (CA5 1998); Reeves v.\n10        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSwift Transp.

Beverly Enterprises, Inc., 196\nF. 3d 1309, 1312\u20131314 (CA11 1999).\n                              D\n  We note that statutory changes made after the time of\nYoung\u2019s pregnancy may limit the future significance of our\ninterpretation of the Act. In 2008, Congress expanded the\ndefinition of \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA to make clear that\n\u201cphysical or mental impairment[s] that substantially\nlimi[t]\u201d an individual\u2019s ability to lift, stand, or bend are\nADA-covered disabilities. ADA Amendments Act of 2008,\n122 Stat. 3555, codified at 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a712102(1)\u2013(2). As\ninterpreted by the EEOC, the new statutory definition\nrequires employers to accommodate employees whose\ntemporary lifting restrictions originate off the job. See 29\nCFR pt. 1630, App., \u00a71630.2(j)(1)(ix). We express no view\non these statutory and regulatory changes.\n                               II\n    The parties disagree about the interpretation of the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act\u2019s second clause. As we have\nsaid, see Part I\u2013B, supra, the Act\u2019s first clause specifies\nthat discrimination \u201c \u2018because of sex\u2019 \u201d includes discrimina-\ntion \u201cbecause of . . . pregnancy.\u201d But the meaning of the\nsecond clause is less clear; it adds: \u201c[W]omen affected by\npregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall\nbe treated the same for all employment-related purposes\n. . . as other persons not so affected but similar in their\nability or inability to work.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e(k) (empha-\nsis added). Does this clause mean that courts must com-\npare workers only in respect to the work limitations that\nthey suffer? Does it mean that courts must ignore all\nother similarities or differences between pregnant and\nnonpregnant workers? Or does it mean that courts, when\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeciding who the relevant \u201cother persons\u201d are, may con-\nsider other similarities and differences as well? If so,\nwhich ones?\n   The differences between these possible interpretations\ncome to the fore when a court, as here, must consider a\nworkplace policy that distinguishes between pregnant and\nnonpregnant workers in light of characteristics not related\nto pregnancy. Young poses the problem directly in her\nreply brief when she says that the Act requires giving \u201cthe\nsame accommodations to an employee with a pregnancy-\nrelated work limitation as it would give that employee if\nher work limitation stemmed from a different cause but\nhad a similar effect on her inability to work.\u201d Reply Brief\n15. Suppose the employer would not give \u201cthat [ pregnant]\nemployee\u201d the \u201csame accommodations\u201d as another employee,\nbut the employer\u2019s reason for the difference in treatment\nis that the pregnant worker falls within a facially neutral\ncategory (for example, individuals with off-the-job in-\njuries). What is a court then to do?\n   The parties propose very different answers to this ques-\ntion. Young and the United States believe that the second\nclause of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act \u201crequires an\nemployer to provide the same accommodations to work-\nplace disabilities caused by pregnancy that it provides to\nworkplace disabilities that have other causes but have a\nsimilar effect on the ability to work.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n23. In other words, Young contends that the second clause\nmeans that whenever \u201can employer accommodates only a\nsubset of workers with disabling conditions,\u201d a court\nshould find a Title VII violation if \u201cpregnant workers who\nare similar in the ability to work\u201d do not \u201creceive the same\n[accommodation] even if still other non-pregnant workers\ndo not receive accommodations.\u201d Id., at 28.\n   UPS takes an almost polar opposite view. It contends\nthat the second clause does no more than define sex dis-\ncrimination to include pregnancy discrimination. See\n12        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Respondent 25. Under this view, courts would\ncompare the accommodations an employer provides to\npregnant women with the accommodations it provides to\nothers within a facially neutral category (such as those\nwith off-the-job injuries) to determine whether the em-\nployer has violated Title VII. Cf. post, at 4 (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting) (hereinafter the dissent) (the clause \u201cdoes not\nprohibit denying pregnant women accommodations . . . on\nthe basis of an evenhanded policy\u201d).\n                              A\n   We cannot accept either of these interpretations. Young\nasks us to interpret the second clause broadly and, in her\nview, literally. As just noted, she argues that, as long as\n\u201can employer accommodates only a subset of workers with\ndisabling conditions,\u201d \u201cpregnant workers who are similar\nin the ability to work [must] receive the same treatment\neven if still other nonpregnant workers do not receive\naccommodations.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 28. She adds that,\nbecause the record here contains \u201cevidence that pregnant\nand nonpregnant workers were not treated the same,\u201d that\nis the end of the matter, she must win; there is no need to\nrefer to McDonnell Douglas. Brief for Petitioner 47.\n   The problem with Young\u2019s approach is that it proves too\nmuch. It seems to say that the statute grants pregnant\nworkers a \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d status. As long as an\nemployer provides one or two workers with an accommo-\ndation\u2014say, those with particularly hazardous jobs, or\nthose whose workplace presence is particularly needed, or\nthose who have worked at the company for many years, or\nthose who are over the age of 55\u2014then it must provide\nsimilar accommodations to all pregnant workers (with\ncomparable physical limitations), irrespective of the na-\nture of their jobs, the employer\u2019s need to keep them work-\ning, their ages, or any other criteria.\n   Lower courts have concluded that this could not have\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbeen Congress\u2019 intent in passing the Pregnancy Discrimi-\nnation Act. See, e.g., Urbano, 138 F. 3d, at 206\u2013208;\nReeves, 466 F. 3d, at 641; Serednyj, 656 F. 3d, at 548\u2013549;\nSpivey, 196 F. 3d, at 1312\u20131313. And Young partially\nagrees, for she writes that \u201cthe statute does not require\nemployers to give\u201d to \u201cpregnant workers all of the benefits\nand privileges it extends to other\u201d similarly disabled \u201cem-\nployees when those benefits and privileges are . . . based\non the employee\u2019s tenure or position within the company.\u201d\nReply Brief 15\u201316; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 22\n(\u201c[S]eniority, full-time work, different job classifications,\nall of those things would be permissible distinctions for\nan employer to make to differentiate among who gets\nbenefits\u201d).\n   Young\u2019s last-mentioned concession works well with\nrespect to seniority, for Title VII itself contains a seniority\ndefense, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(h). Hence, seniority is\nnot part of the problem. But otherwise the most-favored-\nnation problem remains, and Young\u2019s concession does not\nsolve it. How, for example, should a court treat special\nbenefits attached to injuries arising out of, say, extra-\nhazardous duty? If Congress intended to allow differences\nin treatment arising out of special duties, special service,\nor special needs, why would it not also have wanted\ncourts to take account of differences arising out of special\n\u201ccauses\u201d\u2014for example, benefits for those who drive (and\nare injured) in extrahazardous conditions?\n   We agree with UPS to this extent: We doubt that Con-\ngress intended to grant pregnant workers an unconditional\nmost-favored-nation status. The language of the statute\ndoes not require that unqualified reading. The second\nclause, when referring to nonpregnant persons with simi-\nlar disabilities, uses the open-ended term \u201cother persons.\u201d\nIt does not say that the employer must treat pregnant\nemployees the \u201csame\u201d as \u201cany other persons\u201d (who are\nsimilar in their ability or inability to work), nor does it\n14        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\notherwise specify which other persons Congress had in\nmind.\n  Moreover, disparate-treatment law normally permits an\nemployer to implement policies that are not intended to\nharm members of a protected class, even if their imple-\nmentation sometimes harms those members, as long as\nthe employer has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpre-\ntextual reason for doing so. See, e.g., Raytheon, 540 U. S.,\nat 51\u201355; Burdine, 450 U. S., at 252\u2013258; McDonnell\nDouglas, 411 U. S., at 802. There is no reason to believe\nCongress intended its language in the Pregnancy Discrim-\nination Act to embody a significant deviation from this\napproach. Indeed, the relevant House Report specifies\nthat the Act \u201creflect[s] no new legislative mandate.\u201d H. R.\nRep. No. 95\u2013948, pp. 3\u20134 (1978) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.).\nAnd the Senate Report states that the Act was designed to\n\u201creestablis[h] the law as it was understood prior to\u201d this\nCourt\u2019s decision in General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429\nU. S. 125 (1976). S. Rep. No. 95\u2013331, p. 8 (1978) (herein-\nafter S. Rep.). See Gilbert, supra, at 147 (Brennan, J.,\ndissenting) (lower courts had held that a disability plan\nthat compensates employees for temporary disabilities but\nnot pregnancy violates Title VII); see also AT&T Corp. v.\nHulteen, 556 U. S. 701, 717, n. 2 (2009) (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting).\n                              B\n  Before Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination\nAct, the EEOC issued guidance stating that \u201c[d]isabilities\ncaused or contributed to by pregnancy . . . are, for all job-\nrelated purposes, temporary disabilities\u201d and that \u201cthe\navailability of . . . benefits and privileges . . . shall be\napplied to disability due to pregnancy or childbirth on the\nsame terms and conditions as they are applied to other\ntemporary disabilities.\u201d      29 CFR \u00a71604.10(b) (1975).\nIndeed, as early as 1972, EEOC guidelines provided:\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cDisabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy . . .\nare, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and\nshould be treated as such under any health or temporary\ndisability insurance or sick leave plan available in connec-\ntion with employment.\u201d 37 Fed. Reg. 6837 (1972) (codified\nin 29 CFR \u00a71604.10(b) (1973)).\n   Soon after the Act was passed, the EEOC issued guid-\nance consistent with its pre-Act statements. The EEOC\nexplained: \u201cDisabilities caused or contributed to by preg-\nnancy . . . for all job-related purposes, shall be treated the\nsame as disabilities caused or contributed to by other\nmedical conditions.\u201d See \u00a71604.10(b) (1979). Moreover,\nthe EEOC stated that \u201c[i]f other employees temporarily\nunable to lift are relieved of these functions, pregnant\nemployees also unable to lift must be temporarily relieved\nof the function.\u201d 29 CFR pt. 1604, App., p. 918.\n   This post-Act guidance, however, does not resolve the\nambiguity of the term \u201cother persons\u201d in the Act\u2019s second\nclause. Rather, it simply tells employers to treat pregnancy-\nrelated disabilities like nonpregnancy-related disabilities,\nwithout clarifying how that instruction should be imple-\nmented when an employer does not treat all nonpregnancy-\nrelated disabilities alike.\n   More recently\u2014in July 2014\u2014the EEOC promulgated\nan additional guideline apparently designed to address\nthis ambiguity. That guideline says that \u201c[a]n employer\nmay not refuse to treat a pregnant worker the same as\nother employees who are similar in their ability or inabil-\nity to work by relying on a policy that makes distinctions\nbased on the source of an employee\u2019s limitations (e.g., a\npolicy of providing light duty only to workers injured on\nthe job).\u201d 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7626\u2013I(A)(5), p.\n626:0009 (July 2014). The EEOC also provided an exam-\nple of disparate treatment that would violate the Act:\n    \u201cAn employer has a policy or practice of providing\n16         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     light duty, subject to availability, for any employee\n     who cannot perform one or more job duties for up to\n     90 days due to injury, illness, or a condition that\n     would be a disability under the ADA. An employee\n     requests a light duty assignment for a 20\u2013pound lift-\n     ing restriction related to her pregnancy. The em-\n     ployer denies the light duty request.\u201d Id., at 626:0013,\n     Example 10.\nThe EEOC further added that \u201can employer may not deny\nlight duty to a pregnant employee based on a policy that\nlimits light duty to employees with on-the-job injuries.\u201d\nId., at 626:0028.\n   The Solicitor General argues that we should give spe-\ncial, if not controlling, weight to this guideline. He points\nout that we have long held that \u201cthe rulings, interpreta-\ntions and opinions\u201d of an agency charged with the mission\nof enforcing a particular statute, \u201cwhile not controlling\nupon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute\na body of experience and informed judgment to which\ncourts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\u201d\nSkidmore v.

See\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26.\n   But we have also held that the \u201cweight of such a judg-\nment in a particular case will depend upon the thorough-\nness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reason-\ning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,\nand all those factors that give it power to persuade, if\nlacking power to control.\u201d Skidmore, supra, at 140. These\nqualifications are relevant here and severely limit the\nEEOC\u2019s July 2014 guidance\u2019s special power to persuade.\n   We come to this conclusion not because of any agency\nlack of \u201cexperience\u201d or \u201cinformed judgment.\u201d Rather, the\ndifficulties are those of timing, \u201cconsistency,\u201d and \u201cthor-\noughness\u201d of \u201cconsideration.\u201d The EEOC promulgated its\n2014 guidelines only recently, after this Court had granted\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

In these circumstances, it is fair to\nsay that the EEOC\u2019s current guidelines take a position\nabout which the EEOC\u2019s previous guidelines were silent.\nAnd that position is inconsistent with positions for\nwhich the Government has long advocated. See Brief for\nDefendant-Appellee in Ensley-Gaines v. Runyon, No. 95\u2013\n1038 (CA6 1996), pp. 26\u201327 (explaining that a reading of the\nAct like Young\u2019s was \u201csimply incorrect\u201d and \u201cruns counter\u201d\nto this Court\u2019s precedents). See also Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 2 (\u201cThe Department of\nJustice, on behalf of the United States Postal Service, has\npreviously taken the position that pregnant employees\nwith work limitations are not similarly situated to em-\nployees with similar limitations caused by on-the-job\ninjuries\u201d). Nor does the EEOC explain the basis of its\nlatest guidance. Does it read the statute, for example,\nas embodying a most-favored-nation status? Why has it\nnow taken a position contrary to the litigation position\nthe Government previously took?           Without further\nexplanation, we cannot rely significantly on the EEOC\u2019s\ndetermination.\n                               C\n    We find it similarly difficult to accept the opposite in-\nterpretation of the Act\u2019s second clause. UPS says that the\nsecond clause simply defines sex discrimination to include\npregnancy discrimination. See Brief for Respondent 25.\nBut that cannot be so.\n    The first clause accomplishes that objective when it\nexpressly amends Title VII\u2019s definitional provision to\nmake clear that Title VII\u2019s words \u201cbecause of sex\u201d and \u201con\nthe basis of sex\u201d \u201cinclude, but are not limited to, because of\nor on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical\nconditions.\u201d 42 U.

We have long held that\n\u201c \u2018a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that,\nif it can be prevented, no clause\u2019 \u201d is rendered \u201c \u2018superflu-\n18         YOUNG v.

But that is what UPS\u2019 interpretation of\nthe second clause would do.\n   The dissent, basically accepting UPS\u2019 interpretation,\nsays that the second clause is not \u201csuperfluous\u201d because it\nadds \u201cclarity.\u201d Post, at 4\u20135 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). It makes \u201cplain,\u201d the dissent adds, that unlaw-\nful discrimination \u201cincludes disfavoring pregnant women\nrelative to other workers of similar inability to work.\u201d\nPost, at 5. Perhaps we fail to understand. McDonnell\nDouglas itself makes clear that courts normally consider\nhow a plaintiff was treated relative to other \u201cpersons of\n[the plaintiff \u2019s] qualifications\u201d (which here include disabil-\nities). 411 U. S., at 802. If the second clause of the Act did\nnot exist, we would still say that an employer who disfa-\nvored pregnant women relative to other workers of similar\nability or inability to work had engaged in pregnancy\ndiscrimination. In a word, there is no need for the \u201cclarifi-\ncation\u201d that the dissent suggests the second sentence\nprovides.\n   Moreover, the interpretation espoused by UPS and the\ndissent would fail to carry out an important congressional\nobjective. As we have noted, Congress\u2019 \u201cunambiguou[s]\u201d\nintent in passing the Act was to overturn \u201cboth the holding\nand the reasoning of the Court in the Gilbert decision.\u201d\nNewport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v.

Although\npregnancy is \u201cconfined to women,\u201d the majority believed it\nwas not \u201ccomparable in all other respects to [the] diseases\nor disabilities\u201d that the plan covered. Id., at 136. Specifi-\ncally, the majority explained that pregnancy \u201cis not a\n\u2018disease\u2019 at all,\u201d nor is it necessarily a result of accident.\nIbid. Neither did the majority see the distinction the\nplan drew as \u201ca subterfuge\u201d or a \u201cpretext\u201d for engaging in\ngender-based discrimination. Ibid. In short, the Gilbert\nmajority reasoned in part just as the dissent reasons here.\nThe employer did \u201cnot distinguish between pregnant\nwomen and others of similar ability or inability because of\npregnancy.\u201d Post, at 2. It distinguished between them on\na neutral ground\u2014i.e., it accommodated only sicknesses\nand accidents, and pregnancy was neither of those. See\n429 U. S., at 136.\n   Simply including pregnancy among Title VII\u2019s protected\ntraits (i.e., accepting UPS\u2019 interpretation) would not over-\nturn Gilbert in full\u2014in particular, it would not respond to\nGilbert\u2019s determination that an employer can treat preg-\nnancy less favorably than diseases or disabilities resulting\nin a similar inability to work. As we explained in Califor-\nnia Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272\n(1987), \u201cthe first clause of the [Act] reflects Congress\u2019\ndisapproval of the reasoning in Gilbert\u201d by \u201cadding preg-\nnancy to the definition of sex discrimination prohibited by\nTitle VII.\u201d Id., at 284. But the second clause was intended\nto do more than that\u2014it \u201cwas intended to overrule the\nholding in Gilbert and to illustrate how discrimination\nagainst pregnancy is to be remedied.\u201d Id., at 285. The\ndissent\u2019s view, like that of UPS\u2019, ignores this precedent.\n                            III\n  The statute lends itself to an interpretation other than\nthose that the parties advocate and that the dissent sets\n20        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforth. Our interpretation minimizes the problems we have\ndiscussed, responds directly to Gilbert, and is consistent\nwith longstanding interpretations of Title VII.\n  In our view, an individual pregnant worker who seeks to\nshow disparate treatment through indirect evidence may\ndo so through application of the McDonnell Douglas\nframework. That framework requires a plaintiff to make\nout a prima facie case of discrimination. But it is \u201cnot\nintended to be an inflexible rule.\u201d Furnco Constr. Corp. v.\nWaters, 438 U. S. 567, 575 (1978). Rather, an individual\nplaintiff may establish a prima facie case by \u201cshowing\nactions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if\nsuch actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely\nthan not that such actions were based on a discriminatory\ncriterion illegal under\u201d Title VII. Id., at 576 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The burden of making this\nshowing is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d Burdine, 450 U. S., at 253. In\nparticular, making this showing is not as burdensome as\nsucceeding on \u201can ultimate finding of fact as to\u201d a discrim-\ninatory employment action. Furnco, supra, at 576. Nei-\nther does it require the plaintiff to show that those whom\nthe employer favored and those whom the employer disfa-\nvored were similar in all but the protected ways. See\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U. S., at 802 (burden met where\nplaintiff showed that employer hired other \u201cqualified\u201d\nindividuals outside the protected class); Furnco, supra, at\n575\u2013577 (same); Burdine, supra, at 253 (same). Cf. Reeves\nv. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S. 133, 142\n(2000) (similar).\n  Thus, a plaintiff alleging that the denial of an accommo-\ndation constituted disparate treatment under the Preg-\nnancy Discrimination Act\u2019s second clause may make out a\nprima facie case by showing, as in McDonnell Douglas,\nthat she belongs to the protected class, that she sought\naccommodation, that the employer did not accommodate\nher, and that the employer did accommodate others \u201csimi-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d\n   The employer may then seek to justify its refusal to\naccommodate the plaintiff by relying on \u201clegitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory\u201d reasons for denying her accommodation.\n411 U. S., at 802. But, consistent with the Act\u2019s basic\nobjective, that reason normally cannot consist simply of a\nclaim that it is more expensive or less convenient to add\npregnant women to the category of those (\u201csimilar in their\nability or inability to work\u201d) whom the employer accom-\nmodates. After all, the employer in Gilbert could in all\nlikelihood have made just such a claim.\n   If the employer offers an apparently \u201clegitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory\u201d reason for its actions, the plaintiff may in\nturn show that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons are in fact\npretextual. We believe that the plaintiff may reach a jury\non this issue by providing sufficient evidence that the\nemployer\u2019s policies impose a significant burden on preg-\nnant workers, and that the employer\u2019s \u201clegitimate, nondis-\ncriminatory\u201d reasons are not sufficiently strong to justify\nthe burden, but rather\u2014when considered along with the\nburden imposed\u2014give rise to an inference of intentional\ndiscrimination.\n   The plaintiff can create a genuine issue of material fact\nas to whether a significant burden exists by providing\nevidence that the employer accommodates a large per-\ncentage of nonpregnant workers while failing to accommo-\ndate a large percentage of pregnant workers. Here, for\nexample, if the facts are as Young says they are, she can\nshow that UPS accommodates most nonpregnant employ-\nees with lifting limitations while categorically failing to\naccommodate pregnant employees with lifting limitations.\nYoung might also add that the fact that UPS has multiple\npolicies that accommodate nonpregnant employees with\nlifting restrictions suggests that its reasons for failing to\naccommodate pregnant employees with lifting restrictions\nare not sufficiently strong\u2014to the point that a jury could\n22        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfind that its reasons for failing to accommodate preg-\nnant employees give rise to an inference of intentional\ndiscrimination.\n   This approach, though limited to the Pregnancy Dis-\ncrimination Act context, is consistent with our longstand-\ning rule that a plaintiff can use circumstantial proof to\nrebut an employer\u2019s apparently legitimate, nondiscrimina-\ntory reasons for treating individuals within a protected\nclass differently than those outside the protected class.\nSee Burdine, supra, at 255, n. 10. In particular, it is\nhardly anomalous (as the dissent makes it out to be, see\npost, at 8\u20139) that a plaintiff may rebut an employer\u2019s\nproffered justifications by showing how a policy operates\nin practice. In McDonnell Douglas itself, we noted that an\nemployer\u2019s \u201cgeneral policy and practice with respect to\nminority employment\u201d\u2014including \u201cstatistics as to\u201d that\npolicy and practice\u2014could be evidence of pretext. 411\nU. S., at 804\u2013805. Moreover, the continued focus on\nwhether the plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence to\ngive rise to an inference of intentional discrimination\navoids confusing the disparate-treatment and disparate-\nimpact doctrines, cf. post, at 8\u201310.\n   Our interpretation of the Act is also, unlike the dis-\nsent\u2019s, consistent with Congress\u2019 intent to overrule Gil-\nbert\u2019s reasoning and result. The dissent says that \u201c[i]f a\npregnant woman is denied an accommodation under a\npolicy that does not discriminate against pregnancy, she\nhas been \u2018treated the same\u2019 as everyone else.\u201d Post, at 2.\nThis logic would have found no problem with the employer\nplan in Gilbert, which \u201cdenied an accommodation\u201d to\npregnant women on the same basis as it denied accommo-\ndations to other employees\u2014i.e., it accommodated only\nsicknesses and accidents, and pregnancy was neither of\nthose. See Part II\u2013C, supra. In arguing to the contrary,\nthe dissent\u2019s discussion of Gilbert relies exclusively on the\nopinions of the dissenting Justices in that case. See post,\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 6\u20137. But Congress\u2019 intent in passing the Act was to\noverrule the Gilbert majority opinion, which viewed the\nemployer\u2019s disability plan as denying coverage to pregnant\nemployees on a neutral basis.\n                             IV\n   Under this interpretation of the Act, the judgment of the\nFourth Circuit must be vacated. A party is entitled to\nsummary judgment if there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to\nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a). We have\nalready outlined the evidence Young introduced. See Part\nI\u2013C, supra. Viewing the record in the light most favorable\nto Young, there is a genuine dispute as to whether UPS\nprovided more favorable treatment to at least some em-\nployees whose situation cannot reasonably be distin-\nguished from Young\u2019s. In other words, Young created a\ngenuine dispute of material fact as to the fourth prong of\nthe McDonnell Douglas analysis.\n   Young also introduced evidence that UPS had three\nseparate accommodation policies (on-the-job, ADA, DOT).\nTaken together, Young argued, these policies significantly\nburdened pregnant women. See App. 504 (shop steward\u2019s\ntestimony that \u201cthe only light duty requested [due to\nphysical] restrictions that became an issue\u201d at UPS \u201cwere\nwith women who were pregnant\u201d). The Fourth Circuit did\nnot consider the combined effects of these policies, nor did\nit consider the strength of UPS\u2019 justifications for each\nwhen combined. That is, why, when the employer accom-\nmodated so many, could it not accommodate pregnant\nwomen as well?\n   We do not determine whether Young created a genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether UPS\u2019 reasons for\nhaving treated Young less favorably than it treated these\nother nonpregnant employees were pretextual.

S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1), made it an unlawful\nemployment practice to discriminate \u201cbecause of [an] in-\ndividual\u2019s . . . sex\u201d but made no mention of discrimina-\ntion because of pregnancy. In General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert,\n429 U. S. 125, 135\u2013140 (1976), this Court held that Title\nVII did not reach pregnancy discrimination. Congress\nresponded by enacting the Pregnancy Discrimination Act\n(PDA), which added subsection (k) to a definitional provi-\nsion, \u00a72000e. Subsection (k) contains two clauses. The\nfirst is straightforward; the second is not.\n                              I\n  The first clause provides that \u201cthe terms \u2018because of sex\u2019\nor \u2018on the basis of sex\u2019 include, but are not limited to,\nbecause of or on the basis of pregnancy.\u201d1 This clause has\nthe effect of adding pregnancy to the list of prohibited\ngrounds (race, sex, etc.) originally included in \u00a72000e\u2013\n2(a)(1). Claims of discrimination under that provision\nrequire proof of discriminatory intent. See, e.g., Ricci v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 While   \u00a72000e\u20132(a) uses the phrase \u201cbecause of . . . sex,\u201d other provi-\nsions governed by the definitions in \u00a72000e use the phrase \u201con the basis\nof . . . sex.\u201d See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132(b), (k)(1)(A). Therefore, subsection (k)\ncovers this phrase as well.\n2         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nDeStefano, 557 U. S. 557, 577 (2009); Watson v. Fort\nWorth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 985\u2013986 (1988).\nThus, as a result of the first clause, an employer engages\nin unlawful discrimination under \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1) if (and\nonly if) the employer\u2019s intent is to discriminate because of\nor on the basis of pregnancy.\n   If an employer treats a pregnant woman unfavorably for\nany other reason, the employer is not guilty of an unlawful\nemployment practice under \u00a72000e\u20132(a), as defined by the\nfirst clause of the PDA. And under this first clause, it does\nnot matter whether the employer\u2019s ground for the unfa-\nvorable treatment is reasonable; all that matters is the\nemployer\u2019s actual intent. Of course, when an employer\nclaims to have made a decision for a reason that does not\nseem to make sense, a factfinder may infer that the em-\nployer\u2019s asserted reason for its action is a pretext for un-\nlawful discrimination. But if the factfinder is convinced\nthat the employer acted for some reason other than preg-\nnancy, the employer cannot be held liable under this\nclause.\n                              II\n   The PDA, however, does not simply prohibit discrimina-\ntion because of or on the basis of pregnancy. Instead, the\nsecond clause in \u00a72000e(k) goes on to say the follow-\ning: \u201cand women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or re-\nlated medical conditions shall be treated the same for all\nemployment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits\nunder fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so\naffected but similar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d\nThis clause raises several difficult questions of interpreta-\ntion that are pertinent to the case now before us.\n                             A\n  First, does this clause simply explain what is meant by\ndiscrimination because of or on the basis of pregnancy? Or\n                      Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndoes it impose an additional restriction on employer con-\nduct? I believe that this clause does not merely explain\nbut instead adds to the language that precedes it.\n   This is the interpretation that is most consistent with\nthe statutory text. This clause begins with the word\n\u201cand,\u201d which certainly suggests that what follows repre-\nsents an addition to what came before.\n   It is also revealing that the second clause makes no\nreference to intent, which is the linchpin of liability under\nthe first clause, and that the second clause is an affirma-\ntive command (an employer \u201cshall\u201d provide equal treat-\nment), while the first clause is negative (it prohibits dis-\ncrimination). If a careful drafter wanted to make it clear\nthat the second clause does no more than explain what is\nmeant by the first, the language of the second clause\nwould have to be substantially modified.\n   Finally, if the second clause does not set out an addi-\ntional restriction on employer conduct, it would appear to\nbe largely, if not entirely, superfluous. See, e.g., Arlington\nCentral School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U. S. 291,\n299, n. 1 (2006) (\u201c[I]t is generally presumed that statutes\ndo not contain surplusage\u201d). As noted, the first clause, by\nadding pregnancy to the list of prohibited grounds for\nadverse employment actions, mandates that discrimina-\ntion because of pregnancy be treated like discrimination\nbecause of race, sex, etc. An employer commits an unlaw-\nful employment practice if it intentionally treats employ-\nees of a particular race or sex less favorably than other\nemployees who are similar in their ability or inability to\nwork. Accordingly, the first clause of the PDA is alone\nsufficient to make it clear that an employer is guilty of an\nunlawful employment practice if it intentionally treats\npregnant employees less favorably than others who are\nsimilar in their ability or inability to work.2 For these\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 2 JUSTICE   SCALIA\u2019s dissent argues, post, at 4\u20136, that the second clause\n4           YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nreasons, I conclude that the second clause does not merely\nexplain the first but adds a further requirement of equal\ntreatment irrespective of intent.\n                            B\n  This leads to the second question: In determining\nwhether pregnant employees have been given the equal\ntreatment that this provision demands, with whom must\nthe pregnant employees be compared? I interpret the\nsecond clause to mean that pregnant employees must be\ncompared with employees performing the same or very\nsimilar jobs. Pregnant employees, the second provision\nstates, must be given the same treatment as other em-\nployees who are \u201csimilar in their ability or inability to\nwork.\u201d An employee\u2019s ability to work\u2014despite illness,\ninjury, or pregnancy\u2014often depends on the tasks that the\nemployee\u2019s job includes. Different jobs have different\ntasks, and different tasks require different abilities.\nSuppose that an employer provides a period of leave with\npay for employees whose jobs require tasks, e.g., lifting\nheavy objects, that they cannot perform because of illness\nor injury. Must the employer provide the same benefits\nfor pregnant employees who are unable to lift heavy ob-\njects but have desk jobs that do not entail heavy lifting?\nThe answer is no. The treatment of pregnant employees\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nserves the useful purpose of clarifying the meaning of discrimination\nbecause of pregnancy. Without the second clause, that dissent main-\ntains, there might be uncertainty as to whether an employer would\ncommit an unlawful employment practice if it excluded pregnancy from\nan otherwise complete disability benefits program. Contrary to the\ndissent, however, I think that the answer to this question would be\nquite obvious based on the first clause of the PDA alone. If an employer\nprovided benefits for every employee who was temporarily unable to\nwork due to any physical condition other than pregnancy, that em-\nployer would be in the same position as an employer who provided similar\nbenefits for employees of every race but one. In both situations, the\nemployer would clearly discriminate on a prohibited ground.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmust be compared with the treatment of nonpregnant\nemployees whose jobs involve the performance of the same\nor very similar tasks.\n                               C\n  This conclusion leads to a third, even more difficult\nquestion: When comparing pregnant employees to non-\npregnant employees in similar jobs, which characteristics\nof the pregnant and nonpregnant employees must be\ntaken into account? The answer, I believe, must be found\nin the reference to \u201cother employees who are similar in\ntheir ability or inability to work.\u201d I see two possible inter-\npretations of this language. The first is that the capacity\nto perform the tasks required by a job is the only relevant\ncharacteristic, but like the Court, ante, at 12\u201314, I cannot\naccept this \u201cmost favored employee\u201d interpretation.\n  This interpretation founders when, as in this case, an\nemployer treats pregnant women less favorably than some\nbut not all nonpregnant employees who have similar jobs\nand are similarly impaired in their ability to perform the\ntasks that these jobs require. In this case, as I will ex-\nplain below, see Part III, United Parcel Service (UPS)\ndrivers who were unable to perform the physical tasks\nrequired by that job fell into three groups: first, nonpreg-\nnant employees who received favorable treatment; second,\nnonpregnant employees who do not receive favorable\ntreatment; and third, pregnant employees who, like the\nnonpregnant employees in the second category, did not\nreceive favorable treatment. Under these circumstances,\nwould the \u201cmost favored employee\u201d interpretation require\nthe employer to treat the pregnant women like the em-\nployees in the first, favored group? Or would it be suffi-\ncient if the employer treated them the same as the non-\npregnant employees in the second group who did not\nreceive favorable treatment?\n  Recall that the second clause of \u00a72000e(k) requires that\n6            YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\npregnant women \u201cbe treated the same for all employment-\nrelated purposes . . . as other persons not so affected but\nsimilar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) Therefore, UPS could say that its policy treated\nthe pregnant employees the same as \u201cother persons\u201d who\nwere similar in their ability or inability to work, namely,\nthose nonpregnant employees in the second category. But\nat the same time, the pregnant drivers like petitioner\ncould say that UPS did not treat them the same as \u201cother\nemployees\u201d who were similar in their ability or inability to\nwork, namely, the nonpregnant employees in the first\ngroup. An interpretation that leads to such a problem\ncannot be correct.3\n  I therefore turn to the other possible interpretation of\nthe phrase \u201csimilar in their ability or inability to work,\u201d\nnamely, that \u201csimilar in the ability or inability to work\u201d\nmeans \u201csimilar in relation to the ability or inability to\nwork.\u201d4 Under this interpretation, pregnant and non-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 The\u201cmost favored employee\u201d interpretation would also lead to wildly\nimplausible results. Suppose, for example, that an employer had a\npolicy of refusing to provide any accommodation for any employee who\nwas unable to work due to any reason but that the employer wished to\nmake an exception for several employees who were seriously injured\nwhile performing acts of extraordinary heroism on the job, for example,\nsaving the lives of numerous fellow employees during a fire in the\nworkplace. If the ability to perform job tasks was the only characteris-\ntic that could be considered, the employer would face the choice of\neither denying any special treatment for the heroic employees or\nproviding all the same benefits to all pregnant employees. It is most\nunlikely that this is what Congress intended. Such a requirement\nwould go beyond anything demanded by any other antidiscrimination\nlaw.\n   4 Opinions have often used the phrase \u201csimilar in\u201d to mean \u201csimilar in\n\nrelation to\u201d or \u201csimilar with respect to.\u201d See, e.g., Kiobel v. Royal Dutch\nPetroleum Co., 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (BREYER, J., concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 3) (\u201csimilar in character and specificity to piracy\u201d);\nWilliams v.

And this means that these two groups\nof employees are not similar in the relevant sense if the\nemployer has a neutral business reason for treating them\ndifferently. I agree with the Court that a sufficient reason\n\u201cnormally cannot consist simply of a claim that it is more\nexpensive or less convenient to add pregnant women to the\ncategory of those . . . whom the employer accommodates.\u201d\nAnte, at 21.5 Otherwise, however, I do not think that the\nsecond clause of the PDA authorizes courts to evaluate the\njustification for a truly neutral rule. The language used in\nthe second clause of the PDA is quite different from that\nused in other antidiscrimination provisions that require\nsuch an evaluation. Cf. \u00a712112(b)(5)(A) (discrimination\nagainst a person with a disability includes \u201cnot making\nreasonable accommodations to the known physical or\nmental limitations of an otherwise qualified . . . employee,\nunless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommo-\ndation would impose an undue hardship on the operation\nof [its] business\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a72000e( j) (employer\nmust reasonably accommodate religious observance, prac-\ntice, and belief unless that would impose an \u201cundue hard-\nship on the conduct of the employer\u2019s business\u201d); \u00a72000e\u2013\n2(k)(1)(A)(i) (business necessity defense in Title VII\ndisparate-impact cases).\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprevent\u201d).

S. 701, 720 (2009) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting)\n(quoting Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462\nU. S. 669, 678 (1983).\n8         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n                              III\n\n  I understand petitioner in this case to assert claims\nunder both the first and second clauses of \u00a72000e(k). With\nrespect to her claim under the first clause, I agree with the\nCourt that the information in the summary judgment\nrecord is sufficient (albeit barely) to take the question to\nthe trier of fact.\n  I believe that the judgment of the Court of Appeals with\nrespect to petitioner\u2019s claim under the second clause must\nalso be vacated. Petitioner sought to be excused during\nher pregnancy from the lifting requirements that were\namong her tasks as a driver. Under the policy that United\nParcel Service claims to have had in force at the time in\nquestion, drivers who were physically unable to perform\nthe tasks required by that position fell into three groups.\n  First, some drivers were reassigned to less physically\ndemanding positions. Included in this group were (a)\nthose who were unable to work as drivers due to an injury\nincurred on the job, (b) those drivers who were unable to\nwork as drivers due to a disability as defined by the Amer-\nicans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and (c) those\ndrivers who, as the result of a medical condition or injury,\nlost the Department of Transportation (DOT) certification\nneeded to work in that capacity.\n  The second group of drivers consisted of those who were\nnot pregnant and were denied transfer to a light-duty job.\nDrivers who were injured off the job fell into this category.\nThe third group was made up of pregnant drivers like\npetitioner.\n  It is obvious that respondent had a neutral reason for\nproviding an accommodation when that was required by\nthe ADA. Respondent also had neutral grounds for\nproviding special accommodations for employees who were\ninjured on the job. If these employees had not been per-\nmitted to work at all, it appears that they would have\nbeen eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See Md.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Code Ann. \u00a79\u2013614 (2008).\n   The accommodations that are provided to drivers who\nlost their DOT certifications, however, are another matter.\nA driver may lose DOT certification for a variety of rea-\nsons, including medical conditions or injuries incurred off\nthe job that impair the driver\u2019s ability to operate a motor\nvehicle. Such drivers may then be transferred to jobs that\ndo not require physical tasks incompatible with their\nillness or injury. It does not appear that respondent has\nprovided any plausible justification for treating these\ndrivers more favorably than drivers who were pregnant.\n   The Court of Appeals provided two grounds for distin-\nguishing petitioner\u2019s situation from that of the drivers who\nhad lost their DOT certifications, see 707 F. 3d 437, 450\n(CA4 2013), but neither is adequate. First, the Court of\nAppeals noted that \u201cno legal obstacle [stood] between\n[petitioner] and her work.\u201d Ibid. But the legal obstacle\nfaced by drivers who have lost DOT certification only\nexplains why those drivers could not continue to perform\nall the tasks required by their ordinary jobs; it does not\nexplain why respondent went further and provided such\ndrivers with a work accommodation. Petitioner\u2019s preg-\nnancy prevented her from continuing her normal work as a\ndriver, just as is the case for a driver who loses DOT certi-\nfication. But respondent had a policy of accommodating\ndrivers who lost DOT certification but not accommodating\npregnant women, like petitioner. The legal obstacle of lost\ncertification cannot explain this difference in treatment.\n   Second, the Court of Appeals observed that \u201c \u2018those with\nDOT certification maintai[n] the ability to perform any\nnumber of demanding physical tasks,\u2019 \u201d ibid., but it is\ndoubtful that this is true in all instances. A driver can\nlose DOT certification due to a great variety of\nmedical conditions, including loss of a limb, 49 CFR\n\u00a7391.41(b)(1) (2013); impairments of the arm, hand, finger,\nfoot, or leg, \u00a7391.41(b)(2)(i) and (ii); cardiovascular disease,\n10        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u00a7391.41(b)(4); respiratory dysfunction, \u00a7391.41(b)(5); high\nblood pressure, \u00a7391.41(b)(6); arthritis, \u00a7391.41(b)(7); and\nepilepsy \u00a7391.41(b)(8). It is not evident\u2014and as far as I\nam aware, the record does not show\u2014that all drivers with\nthese conditions are nevertheless able to perform a great\nmany physically demanding tasks. Nevertheless, re-\nspondent says that it was its policy to transfer such driv-\ners to so-called inside jobs when such positions were avail-\nable. Presumably, respondent did not assign these drivers\nto jobs that they were physically unable to perform. So in\nat least some instances, they must have been assigned to\njobs that did not require them to perform tasks that they\nwere incapable of performing due to the medical condition\nthat caused the loss of DOT certification. Respondent has\nnot explained why pregnant drivers could not have been\ngiven similar consideration.\n  For these reasons, it is not at all clear that respondent\nhad any neutral business ground for treating pregnant\ndrivers less favorably than at least some of its nonpreg-\nnant drivers who were reassigned to other jobs that they\nwere physically capable of performing. I therefore agree\nwith the Court that the decision of the Court of Appeals\nwith respect to petitioner\u2019s claim under the second clause\nof the PDA must be vacated, and the case must be re-\nmanded for further proceedings with respect to that claim.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Teamsters v.\nUnited States, 431 U. S. 324, 335\u2013336, n. 15 (1977). Peggy\nYoung did not establish pregnancy discrimination under\neither theory. She argued that United Parcel Service\u2019s\nrefusal to accommodate her inability to work amounted to\ndisparate treatment, but the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat she had not mustered evidence that UPS denied the\naccommodation with intent to disfavor pregnant women.\n707 F. 3d 437, 449\u2013451 (CA4 2013). And Young never\nbrought a claim of disparate impact.\n   That is why Young and the Court leave behind the part\nof the law defining pregnancy discrimination as sex dis-\ncrimination, and turn to the part requiring that \u201cwomen\naffected by pregnancy . . . be treated the same . . . as other\npersons not so affected but similar in their ability or in-\nability to work.\u201d \u00a72000e(k). The most natural way to\nunderstand the same-treatment clause is that an employer\nmay not distinguish between pregnant women and others\nof similar ability or inability because of pregnancy. Here,\nthat means pregnant women are entitled to accommoda-\ntions on the same terms as other workers with disabling\nconditions. If a pregnant woman is denied an accommoda-\ntion under a policy that does not discriminate against\npregnancy, she has been \u201ctreated the same\u201d as everyone\nelse. UPS\u2019s accommodation for drivers who lose their\ncertifications illustrates the point. A pregnant woman\nwho loses her certification gets the benefit, just like any\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nother worker who loses his. And a pregnant woman who\nkeeps her certification does not get the benefit, again just\nlike any other worker who keeps his. That certainly\nsounds like treating pregnant women and others the\nsame.\n   There is, however, another way to understand \u201ctreated\nthe same,\u201d at least looking at that phrase on its own. One\ncould read it to mean that an employer may not distin-\nguish at all between pregnant women and others of simi-\nlar ability. Here, that would mean pregnant women are\nentitled, not to accommodations on the same terms as\nothers, but to the same accommodations as others, no\nmatter the differences (other than pregnancy) between\nthem. UPS\u2019s accommodation for decertified drivers illus-\ntrates this usage too. There is a sense in which a preg-\nnant woman denied an accommodation (because she kept\nher certification) has not been treated the same as an\ninjured man granted an accommodation (because he lost\nhis certification). He got the accommodation and she did\nnot.\n   Of these two readings, only the first makes sense in the\ncontext of Title VII. The point of Title VII\u2019s bans on dis-\ncrimination is to prohibit employers from treating one\nworker differently from another because of a protected\ntrait. It is not to prohibit employers from treating workers\ndifferently for reasons that have nothing to do with pro-\ntected traits. See Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v.\nBurdine, 450 U. S. 248, 259 (1981). Against that back-\ndrop, a requirement that pregnant women and other\nworkers be treated the same is sensibly read to forbid\ndistinctions that discriminate against pregnancy, not all\ndistinctions whatsoever.\n   Prohibiting employers from making any distinctions\nbetween pregnant workers and others of similar ability\nwould elevate pregnant workers to most favored employ-\nees. If Boeing offered chauffeurs to injured directors, it\n4         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwould have to offer chauffeurs to pregnant mechanics.\nAnd if Disney paid pensions to workers who can no longer\nwork because of old age, it would have to pay pensions to\nworkers who can no longer work because of childbirth. It\nis implausible that Title VII, which elsewhere creates\nguarantees of equal treatment, here alone creates a guar-\nantee of favored treatment.\n   Let it not be overlooked, moreover, that the thrust of the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act is that pregnancy discrimi-\nnation is sex discrimination. Instead of creating a free-\nstanding ban on pregnancy discrimination, the Act makes\nplain that the existing ban on sex discrimination reaches\ndiscrimination because of pregnancy. Reading the same-\ntreatment clause to give pregnant women special protec-\ntion unavailable to other women would clash with this\ncentral theme of the Act, because it would mean that\npregnancy discrimination differs from sex discrimination\nafter all.\n   All things considered, then, the right reading of the\nsame-treatment clause prohibits practices that discrimi-\nnate against pregnant women relative to workers of simi-\nlar ability or inability. It does not prohibit denying preg-\nnant women accommodations, or any other benefit for that\nmatter, on the basis of an evenhanded policy.\n                              II\n  The Court agrees that the same-treatment clause is not\na most-favored-employee law, ante, at 12, but at the same\ntime refuses to adopt the reading I propose\u2014which is the\nonly other reading the clause could conceivably bear. The\nCourt\u2019s reasons for resisting this reading fail to persuade.\n  The Court starts by arguing that the same-treatment\nclause must do more than ban distinctions on the basis of\npregnancy, lest it add nothing to the part of the Act defin-\ning pregnancy discrimination as sex discrimination. Ante,\nat 17. Even so read, however, the same-treatment clause\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndoes add something: clarity. See Newport News Ship-\nbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 678,\nn. 14 (1983) (\u201c[T]he specific language in the second clause\n. . . explains the application of the [first clause]\u201d). Just\ndefining pregnancy discrimination as sex discrimination\ndoes not tell us what it means to discriminate because of\npregnancy. Does pregnancy discrimination include, in\naddition to disfavoring pregnant women relative to the\nworkplace in general, disfavoring them relative to disabled\nworkers in particular? Concretely, does an employer\nengage in pregnancy discrimination by excluding preg-\nnancy from an otherwise complete disability-benefits pro-\ngram? Without the same-treatment clause, the answers\nto these questions would not be obvious. An employer\ncould argue that people do not necessarily think of preg-\nnancy and childbirth as disabilities. Or that it would be\nanomalous to read a law defining pregnancy discrimina-\ntion as sex discrimination to require him to treat pregnancy\nlike a disability, when Title VII does not require him to\ntreat sex like a disability. Or that even if pregnancy were\na disability, it would be sui generis\u2014categorically different\nfrom all other disabling conditions. Cf. Geduldig v. Aiello,\n417 U. S. 484, 494\u2013495 (1974) (holding that a State has a\nrational basis for excluding pregnancy-related disabilities\nfrom a disability-benefits program). With the same-\ntreatment clause, these doubts disappear. By requiring\nthat women affected by pregnancy \u201cbe treated the same\n. . . as other persons not so affected but similar in their\nability or inability to work\u201d (emphasis added), the clause\nmakes plain that pregnancy discrimination includes disfa-\nvoring pregnant women relative to other workers of simi-\nlar inability to work.\n    This clarifying function easily overcomes any charge\nthat the reading I propose makes the same-treatment\nclause \u201c \u2018superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 17\u2013\n18. Perhaps, as the Court suggests, even without the\n6         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame-treatment clause the best reading of the Act would\nprohibit disfavoring pregnant women relative to disabled\nworkers. But laws often make explicit what might already\nhave been implicit, \u201cfor greater caution\u201d and in order \u201cto\nleave nothing to construction.\u201d The Federalist No. 33, pp.\n205\u2013206 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). That is why\nwe have long acknowledged that a \u201csufficient\u201d explanation\nfor the inclusion of a clause can be \u201cfound in the desire to\nremove all doubts\u201d about the meaning of the rest of the\ntext. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 420 (1819).\nThis explanation looks all the more sensible once one\nremembers that the object of the Pregnancy Discrimina-\ntion Act is to displace this Court\u2019s conclusion in General\nElec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125 (1976), that pregnancy\ndiscrimination is not sex discrimination. What could be\nmore natural than for a law whose object is superseding\nearlier judicial interpretation to include a clause whose\nobject is leaving nothing to future judicial interpretation?\n   That brings me to the Court\u2019s remaining argument: the\nclaim that the reading I have set forth would not suffice to\noverturn our decision in Gilbert. Ante, at 18\u201320. Wrong.\nGilbert upheld an otherwise comprehensive disability-\nbenefits plan that singled pregnancy out for disfavor. The\nmost natural reading of the Act overturns that decision,\nbecause it prohibits singling pregnancy out for disfavor.\n   The Court goes astray here because it mistakenly as-\nsumes that the Gilbert plan excluded pregnancy on \u201ca\nneutral ground\u201d\u2014covering sicknesses and accidents but\nnothing else. Ante, at 19. In reality, the plan in Gilbert\nwas not neutral toward pregnancy.

What\nis more, the plan denied coverage even to sicknesses, if\nthey were related to pregnancy or childbirth. Ibid. For\nthat matter, the plan denied coverage to sicknesses that\nwere unrelated to pregnancy or childbirth, if they were\nsuffered during recovery from the birth of a child. Ibid.\nGilbert, there can be no doubt, involved \u201cthe lone exclusion\nof pregnancy from [a] program.\u201d Ibid. The most natural\ninterpretation of the Act easily suffices to make that\nunlawful.\n                             III\n  Dissatisfied with the only two readings that the words of\nthe same-treatment clause could possibly bear, the Court\ndecides that the clause means something in-between. It\ntakes only a couple of waves of the Supreme Wand to\nproduce the desired result. Poof!: The same-treatment\nclause means that a neutral reason for refusing to accom-\nmodate a pregnant woman is pretextual if \u201cthe employer\u2019s\npolicies impose a significant burden on pregnant workers.\u201d\nAnte, at 21. Poof!: This is so only when the employer\u2019s\nreasons \u201care not sufficiently strong to justify the burden.\u201d\nIbid.\n  How we got here from the same-treatment clause is\nanyone\u2019s guess. There is no way to read \u201cshall be treated\nthe same\u201d\u2014or indeed anything else in the clause\u2014to\nmean that courts must balance the significance of the\nburden on pregnant workers against the strength of the\nemployer\u2019s justifications for the policy. That is presum-\nably why the Court does not even try to connect the inter-\npretation it adopts with the text it purports to interpret.\nThe Court has forgotten that statutory purpose and the\npresumption against superfluity are tools for choosing\namong competing reasonable readings of a law, not au-\n8         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthorizations for making up new readings that the law\ncannot reasonably bear.\n   The fun does not stop there. Having ignored the terms\nof the same-treatment clause, the Court proceeds to bun-\ngle the dichotomy between claims of disparate treatment\nand claims of disparate impact. Normally, liability for\ndisparate treatment arises when an employment policy\nhas a \u201cdiscriminatory motive,\u201d while liability for disparate\nimpact arises when the effects of an employment policy\n\u201cfall more harshly on one group than another and cannot\nbe justified by business necessity.\u201d Teamsters, 431 U. S.,\nat 336, n. 15. In the topsy-turvy world created by today\u2019s\ndecision, however, a pregnant woman can establish dis-\nparate treatment by showing that the effects of her em-\nployer\u2019s policy fall more harshly on pregnant women than\non others (the policies \u201cimpose a significant burden on\npregnant workers,\u201d ante, at 21) and are inadequately\njustified (the \u201creasons are not sufficiently strong to justify\nthe burden,\u201d ibid.). The change in labels may be small,\nbut the change in results assuredly is not. Disparate-\ntreatment and disparate-impact claims come with differ-\nent standards of liability, different defenses, and different\nremedies. E.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71981a, 2000e\u20132(k). For\nexample, plaintiffs in disparate-treatment cases can get\ncompensatory and punitive damages as well as equitable\nrelief, but plaintiffs in disparate impact cases can get\nequitable relief only. See \u00a7\u00a71981a, 2000e\u20135(g). A sound\nreading of the same-treatment clause would preserve the\ndistinctions so carefully made elsewhere in the Act; the\nCourt\u2019s reading makes a muddle of them.\n   But (believe it or not) it gets worse. In order to make\nsense of its conflation of disparate impact with disparate\ntreatment, the Court claims that its new test is somehow\n\u201climited to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act context,\u201d yet\nat the same time \u201cconsistent with\u201d the traditional use of\ncircumstantial evidence to show intent to discriminate in\n                   Cite as: 575 U.

A court in a Title VII case,\ntrue enough, may consider a policy\u2019s effects and even its\njustifications\u2014along with \u201c \u2018all of the [other] surrounding\nfacts and circumstances\u2019 \u201d\u2014when trying to ferret out a\npolicy\u2019s motive. Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States,\n433 U. S. 299, 312 (1977). The Court cannot possibly\nthink, however, that its newfangled balancing test reflects\nthis conventional inquiry. It has, after all, just marched\nup and down the hill telling us that the same-treatment\nclause is not (no-no!) \u201c \u2018superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 17\u201318. If the clause merely instructed courts to\nconsider a policy\u2019s effects and justifications the way it\nconsiders other circumstantial evidence of motive, it would\nbe superfluous. So the Court\u2019s balancing test must mean\nsomething else. Even if the effects and justifications of\npolicies are not enough to show intent to discriminate\nunder ordinary Title VII principles, they could (Poof !) still\nshow intent to discriminate for purposes of the pregnancy\nsame-treatment clause. Deliciously incoherent.\n  And all of this to what end? The difference between a\nroutine circumstantial-evidence inquiry into motive and\ntoday\u2019s grotesque effects-and-justifications inquiry into\nmotive, it would seem, is that today\u2019s approach requires\njudges to concentrate on effects and justifications to the\nexclusion of other considerations. But Title VII already\nhas a framework that allows judges to home in on a pol-\nicy\u2019s effects and justifications\u2014disparate impact. Under\nthat framework, it is already unlawful for an employer to\nuse a practice that has a disparate impact on the basis of a\nprotected trait, unless (among other things) the employer\ncan show that the practice \u201cis job related . . . and con-\nsistent with business necessity.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A)(i).\nThe Court does not explain why we need (never mind how\nthe Act could possibly be read to contain) today\u2019s ersatz\ndisparate-impact test, under which the disparate-impact\nelement gives way to the significant-burden criterion and\n10        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe business-necessity defense gives way to the sufficiently-\nstrong-justification standard. Today\u2019s decision can thus\nserve only one purpose: allowing claims that belong under\nTitle VII\u2019s disparate-impact provisions to be brought\nunder its disparate-treatment provisions instead.\n                              IV\n   JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concurrence agrees with the Court\u2019s\nrejection of both conceivable readings of the same-\ntreatment clause, but fashions a different compromise\nbetween them. Under its approach, an employer may\ndeny a pregnant woman a benefit granted to workers who\nperform similar tasks only on the basis of a \u201cneutral busi-\nness ground.\u201d Ante, at 10 (opinion concurring in judg-\nment). This requirement of a \u201cbusiness ground\u201d shadows\nthe Court\u2019s requirement of a \u201csufficiently strong\u201d justifica-\ntion, and, like it, has no footing in the terms of the same-\ntreatment clause. As the concurrence understands the\nwords \u201cshall be treated the same,\u201d an employer must give\npregnant workers the same accommodations (not merely\naccommodations on the same terms) as other workers\n\u201cwho are similar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d\nAnte, at 3\u20134. But the concurrence realizes that requiring\nthe same accommodations to all who are similar in ability\nor inability to work\u2014the only characteristic mentioned in\nthe same-treatment clause\u2014would \u201clead to wildly implau-\nsible results.\u201d Ante, at 6, n. 3. To solve this problem, the\nconcurrence broadens the category of characteristics that\nthe employer may take into account. It allows an em-\nployer to find dissimilarity on the basis of traits other than\nability to work so long as there is a \u201cneutral business\nreason\u201d for considering them\u2014though it immediately adds\nthat cost and inconvenience are not good enough reasons.\nAnte, at 7.

The dissent is\naltogether correct to point out that petitioner here cannot\npoint to a class of her co-workers that was accommodated\nand that would include her but for the particular limita-\ntions imposed by her pregnancy. Many other workers\nwith health-related restrictions were not accommodated\neither. And, in addition, there is no showing here of ani-\nmus or hostility to pregnant women.\n   But as a matter of societal concern, indifference is quite\nanother matter. There must be little doubt that women\nwho are in the work force\u2014by choice, by financial necessity,\nor both\u2014confront a serious disadvantage after becom-\ning pregnant. They may find it difficult to continue to\nwork, at least in their regular assignment, while still\ntaking necessary steps to avoid risks to their health and\nthe health of their future children. This is why the diffi-\nculties pregnant women face in the workplace are and do\nremain an issue of national importance.\n   \u201cHistorically, denial or curtailment of women\u2019s employ-\nment opportunities has been traceable directly to the\npervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and\nworkers second.\u201d Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v.\nHibbs, 538 U.

And after the events giving rise to this litigation,\nCongress passed the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, 122\nStat. 3553, which expands protections for employees with\ntemporary disabilities.

Argued December 3, 2014\u2014Decided March 25, 2015\nThe Pregnancy Discrimination Act added new language to the defini-\n  tions subsection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The first\n  clause of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act specifies that Title VII\u2019s\n  prohibition against sex discrimination applies to discrimination \u201cbe-\n  cause of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical\n  conditions.\u201d 42 U. S. C \u00a72000e(k). The Act\u2019s second clause says that\n  employers must treat \u201cwomen affected by pregnancy . . . the same for\n  all employment-related purposes . . . as other persons not so affected\n  but similar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d Ibid. This case asks\n  the Court to determine how the latter provision applies in the context\n  of an employer\u2019s policy that accommodates many, but not all, workers\n  with nonpregnancy-related disabilities.\n     Petitioner Young was a part-time driver for respondent United\n  Parcel Service (UPS). When she became pregnant, her doctor advised\n  her that she should not lift more than 20 pounds. UPS, however, re-\n  quired drivers like Young to be able to lift up to 70 pounds. UPS told\n  Young that she could not work while under a lifting restriction.\n  Young subsequently filed this federal lawsuit, claiming that UPS act-\n  ed unlawfully in refusing to accommodate her pregnancy-related lift-\n  ing restriction. She brought only a disparate-treatment claim of dis-\n  crimination, which a plaintiff can prove either by direct evidence that\n  a workplace policy, practice, or decision relies expressly on a protect-\n  ed characteristic, or by using the burden-shifting framework set forth\n  in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792. Under that\n  framework, the plaintiff has \u201cthe initial burden\u201d of \u201cestablishing a\n  prima facie case\u201d of discrimination. Id., at 802. If she carries her\n  burden, the employer must have an opportunity \u201cto articulate some\n  legitimate, non-discriminatory reason[s] for\u201d the difference in treat-\n2           YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n ment. Ibid. If the employer articulates such reasons, the plaintiff\n then has \u201can opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n that the reasons . . . were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d Texas Dept.\n of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 253.\n    After discovery, UPS sought summary judgment. In reply, Young\n presented several favorable facts that she believed she could prove.\n In particular, she pointed to UPS policies that accommodated work-\n ers who were injured on the job, had disabilities covered by the Amer-\n icans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), or had lost Department of\n Transportation (DOT) certifications. Pursuant to these policies,\n Young contended, UPS had accommodated several individuals whose\n disabilities created work restrictions similar to hers. She argued that\n these policies showed that UPS discriminated against its pregnant\n employees because it had a light-duty-for-injury policy for numerous\n \u201cother persons,\u201d but not for pregnant workers. UPS responded that,\n since Young did not fall within the on-the-job injury, ADA, or DOT\n categories, it had not discriminated against Young on the basis of\n pregnancy, but had treated her just as it treated all \u201cother\u201d relevant\n \u201cpersons.\u201d\n    The District Court granted UPS summary judgment, concluding,\n inter alia, that Young could not make out a prima facie case of dis-\n crimination under McDonnell Douglas. The court found that those\n with whom Young had compared herself\u2014those falling within the on-\n the-job, DOT, or ADA categories\u2014were too different to qualify as\n \u201csimilarly situated comparator[s].\u201d The Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. An individual pregnant worker who seeks to show disparate\n treatment through indirect evidence may do so through application of\n the McDonnell Douglas framework. Pp. 10\u201323.\n       (a) The parties\u2019 interpretations of the Pregnancy Discrimination\n Act\u2019s second clause are unpersuasive. Pp. 12\u201320.\n         (i) Young claims that as long as \u201can employer accommodates\n only a subset of workers with disabling conditions,\u201d \u201cpregnant work-\n ers who are similar in the ability to work [must] receive the same\n treatment even if still other nonpregnant workers do not receive ac-\n commodations.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 28. Her reading proves too\n much. The Court doubts that Congress intended to grant pregnant\n workers an unconditional \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d status, such that\n employers who provide one or two workers with an accommodation\n must provide similar accommodations to all pregnant workers, irre-\n spective of any other criteria. After all, the second clause of the Act,\n when referring to nonpregnant persons with similar disabilities, uses\n the open-ended term \u201cother persons.\u201d It does not say that the em-\n ployer must treat pregnant employees the \u201csame\u201d as \u201cany other per-\n                   Cite as: 575 U.

Moreover, disparate-\ntreatment law normally allows an employer to implement policies\nthat are not intended to harm members of a protected class, even if\ntheir implementation sometimes harms those members, as long as\nthe employer has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual rea-\nson for doing so. See, e.g., Burdine, supra, at 252\u2013258. There is no\nreason to think Congress intended its language in the Pregnancy\nDiscrimination Act to deviate from that approach. Pp. 12\u201314.\n       (ii) The Solicitor General argues that the Court should give\nspecial, if not controlling, weight to a 2014 Equal Employment Op-\nportunity Commission guideline concerning the application of Title\nVII and the ADA to pregnant employees. But that guideline lacks\nthe timing, \u201cconsistency,\u201d and \u201cthoroughness\u201d of \u201cconsideration\u201d nec-\nessary to \u201cgive it power to persuade.\u201d Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323\nU. S. 134, 140. The guideline was promulgated after certiorari was\ngranted here; it takes a position on which previous EEOC guidelines\nwere silent; it is inconsistent with positions long advocated by the\nGovernment; and the EEOC does not explain the basis for its latest\nguidance. Pp. 14\u201317.\n       (iii) UPS claims that the Act\u2019s second clause simply defines sex\ndiscrimination to include pregnancy discrimination. But that cannot\nbe right, as the first clause of the Act accomplishes that objective.\nReading the Act\u2019s second clause as UPS proposes would thus render\nthe first clause superfluous. It would also fail to carry out a key con-\ngressional objective in passing the Act. The Act was intended to\noverturn the holding and the reasoning of General Elec. Co. v. Gil-\nbert, 429 U. S. 125, which upheld against a Title VII challenge a\ncompany plan that provided nonoccupational sickness and accident\nbenefits to all employees but did not provide disability-benefit pay-\nments for any absence due to pregnancy. Pp. 17\u201320.\n     (b) An individual pregnant worker who seeks to show disparate\ntreatment may make out a prima facie case under the McDonnell\nDouglas framework by showing that she belongs to the protected\nclass, that she sought accommodation, that the employer did not ac-\ncommodate her, and that the employer did accommodate others \u201csim-\nilar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d The employer may then\nseek to justify its refusal to accommodate the plaintiff by relying on\n\u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory\u201d reasons for denying accommodation.\nThat reason normally cannot consist simply of a claim that it is more\nexpensive or less convenient to add pregnant women to the category\nof those whom the employer accommodates. If the employer offers a\n\u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory\u201d reason, the plaintiff may show that it\n4             YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    is in fact pretextual. The plaintiff may reach a jury on this issue by\n    providing sufficient evidence that the employer\u2019s policies impose a\n    significant burden on pregnant workers, and that the employer\u2019s \u201cle-\n    gitimate, nondiscriminatory\u201d reasons are not sufficiently strong to\n    justify the burden, but rather\u2014when considered along with the bur-\n    den imposed\u2014give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.\n    The plaintiff can create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n    a significant burden exists by providing evidence that the employer\n    accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnant workers while fail-\n    ing to accommodate a large percentage of pregnant workers. This\n    approach is consistent with the longstanding rule that a plaintiff can\n    use circumstantial proof to rebut an employer\u2019s apparently legiti-\n    mate, nondiscriminatory reasons, see Burdine, supra, at 255, n. 10,\n    and with Congress\u2019 intent to overrule Gilbert.

Summary judgment is appropriate when\n    there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ.\n    Proc. 56(a). The record here shows that Young created a genuine\n    dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at\n    least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distin-\n    guished from hers. It is left to the Fourth Circuit to determine on\n    remand whether Young also created a genuine issue of material fact\n    as to whether UPS\u2019 reasons for having treated Young less favorably\n    than these other nonpregnant employees were pretextual.

UNITED PARCEL \n\n                SERVICE, INC. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [March 25, 2015]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Pregnancy Discrimination Act makes clear that\nTitle VII\u2019s prohibition against sex discrimination applies\nto discrimination based on pregnancy. It also says that\nemployers must treat \u201cwomen affected by pregnancy . . .\nthe same for all employment-related purposes . . . as other\npersons not so affected but similar in their ability or in-\nability to work.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e(k). We must decide\nhow this latter provision applies in the context of an em-\nployer\u2019s policy that accommodates many, but not all,\nworkers with nonpregnancy-related disabilities.\n  In our view, the Act requires courts to consider the\nextent to which an employer\u2019s policy treats pregnant\nworkers less favorably than it treats nonpregnant workers\nsimilar in their ability or inability to work. And here\u2014as\nin all cases in which an individual plaintiff seeks to show\ndisparate treatment through indirect evidence\u2014it re-\nquires courts to consider any legitimate, nondiscrimina-\ntory, nonpretextual justification for these differences in\ntreatment. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\nU. S. 792, 802 (1973). Ultimately the court must deter-\n2         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmine whether the nature of the employer\u2019s policy and the\nway in which it burdens pregnant women shows that the\nemployer has engaged in intentional discrimination. The\nCourt of Appeals here affirmed a grant of summary judg-\nment in favor of the employer. Given our view of the law,\nwe must vacate that court\u2019s judgment.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n    We begin with a summary of the facts. The petitioner,\nPeggy Young, worked as a part-time driver for the re-\nspondent, United Parcel Service (UPS). Her responsibili-\nties included pickup and delivery of packages that had\narrived by air carrier the previous night. In 2006, after\nsuffering several miscarriages, she became pregnant. Her\ndoctor told her that she should not lift more than 20\npounds during the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy or more\nthan 10 pounds thereafter. App. 580. UPS required driv-\ners like Young to be able to lift parcels weighing up to 70\npounds (and up to 150 pounds with assistance). Id., at\n578. UPS told Young she could not work while under a\nlifting restriction. Young consequently stayed home with-\nout pay during most of the time she was pregnant and\neventually lost her employee medical coverage.\n   Young subsequently brought this federal lawsuit. We\nfocus here on her claim that UPS acted unlawfully in\nrefusing to accommodate her pregnancy-related lifting\nrestriction. Young said that her co-workers were willing\nto help her with heavy packages. She also said that UPS\naccommodated other drivers who were \u201csimilar in their . . .\ninability to work.\u201d She accordingly concluded that UPS\nmust accommodate her as well. See Brief for Petitioner\n30\u201331.\n   UPS responded that the \u201cother persons\u201d whom it had\naccommodated were (1) drivers who had become disabled\non the job, (2) those who had lost their Department of\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nTransportation (DOT) certifications, and (3) those who\nsuffered from a disability covered by the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 327, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a712101 et seq. UPS said that, since Young did not fall\nwithin any of those categories, it had not discriminated\nagainst Young on the basis of pregnancy but had treated\nher just as it treated all \u201cother\u201d relevant \u201cpersons.\u201d See\nBrief for Respondent 34.\n                                B\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids a covered\nemployer to \u201cdiscriminate against any individual with\nrespect to . . . terms, conditions, or privileges of employ-\nment, because of such individual\u2019s . . . sex.\u201d 78 Stat. 253,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). In 1978, Congress enacted the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act, 92 Stat. 2076, which added\nnew language to Title VII\u2019s definitions subsection. The\nfirst clause of the 1978 Act specifies that Title VII\u2019s\n\u201cter[m] \u2018because of sex\u2019 . . . include[s] . . . because of or on\nthe basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical\nconditions.\u201d \u00a72000e(k). The second clause says that\n    \u201cwomen affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related\n    medical conditions shall be treated the same for all\n    employment-related purposes . . . as other persons not\n    so affected but similar in their ability or inability to\n    work . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n   This case requires us to consider the application of the\nsecond clause to a \u201cdisparate-treatment\u201d claim\u2014a claim\nthat an employer intentionally treated a complainant less\nfavorably than employees with the \u201ccomplainant\u2019s qualifi-\ncations\u201d but outside the complainant\u2019s protected class.\nMcDonnell Douglas, supra, at 802. We have said that\n\u201c[l]iability in a disparate-treatment case depends on\nwhether the protected trait actually motivated the em-\nployer\u2019s decision.\u201d Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U. S.\n4         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n44, 52 (2003) (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omit-\nted). We have also made clear that a plaintiff can prove\ndisparate treatment either (1) by direct evidence that a\nworkplace policy, practice, or decision relies expressly on a\nprotected characteristic, or (2) by using the burden-\nshifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas. See\nTrans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 121\n(1985).\n  In McDonnell Douglas, we considered a claim of discrim-\ninatory hiring. We said that, to prove disparate treat-\nment, an individual plaintiff must \u201ccarry the initial bur-\nden\u201d of \u201cestablishing a prima facie case\u201d of discrimination\nby showing\n    \u201c(i) that he belongs to a . . . minority; (ii) that he ap-\n    plied and was qualified for a job for which the employer\n    was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his quali-\n    fications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his\n    rejection, the position remained open and the employer\n    continued to seek applicants from persons of com-\n    plainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d 411 U. S., at 802.\nIf a plaintiff makes this showing, then the employer must\nhave an opportunity \u201cto articulate some legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory reason for\u201d treating employees outside the\nprotected class better than employees within the protected\nclass. Ibid. If the employer articulates such a reason, the\nplaintiff then has \u201can opportunity to prove by a prepon-\nderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered\nby the defendant [i.e., the employer] were not its true\nreasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d Texas\nDept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 253\n(1981).\n   We note that employment discrimination law also cre-\nates what is called a \u201cdisparate-impact\u201d claim. In evaluat-\ning a disparate-impact claim, courts focus on the effects of\nan employment practice, determining whether they are\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunlawful irrespective of motivation or intent. See Raytheon,\nsupra, at 52\u201353; see also Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S.\n557, 578 (2009). But Young has not alleged a disparate-\nimpact claim.\n   Nor has she asserted what we have called a \u201cpattern-or-\npractice\u201d claim. See Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S.\n324, 359 (1977) (explaining that Title VII plaintiffs who\nallege a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of discrimination may estab-\nlish a prima facie case by \u201canother means\u201d); see also id., at\n357 (rejecting contention that the \u201cburden of proof in a\npattern-or-practice case must be equivalent to that out-\nlined in McDonnell Douglas\u201d).\n                            C\n  In July 2007, Young filed a pregnancy discrimination\ncharge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-\nsion (EEOC). In September 2008, the EEOC provided her\nwith a right-to-sue letter. See 29 CFR \u00a71601.28 (2014).\nYoung then filed this complaint in Federal District Court.\nShe argued, among other things, that she could show by\ndirect evidence that UPS had intended to discriminate\nagainst her because of her pregnancy and that, in any\nevent, she could establish a prima facie case of disparate\ntreatment under the McDonnell Douglas framework. See\nApp. 60\u201362.\n  After discovery, UPS filed a motion for summary judg-\nment. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a). In reply, Young\npointed to favorable facts that she believed were either\nundisputed or that, while disputed, she could prove. They\ninclude the following:\n   1. Young worked as a UPS driver, picking up and de-\n      livering packages carried by air. Plaintiff \u2019s Memo-\n      randum in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for\n      Summary Judgment in No. 08\u2013cv\u201302586 (D Md.),\n      pp. 3\u20134 (hereinafter Memorandum).\n   2. Young was pregnant in the fall of 2006. Id., at 15\u201316.\n6         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    3. Young\u2019s doctor recommended that she \u201cnot be re-\n       quired to lift greater than 20 pounds for the first 20\n       weeks of pregnancy and no greater than 10 pounds\n       thereafter.\u201d App. 580; see also Memorandum 17.\n    4. UPS required drivers such as Young to be able to\n       \u201c[l]ift, lower, push, pull, leverage and manipulate\n       . . . packages weighing up to 70 pounds\u201d and to\n       \u201c[a]ssist in moving packages weighing up to 150\n       pounds.\u201d App. 578; see also Memorandum 5.\n    5.

The manager also determined that Young did not\n       qualify for a temporary alternative work assign-\n       ment. Ibid.; see also Memorandum 19\u201320.\n    7. UPS, in a collective-bargaining agreement, had\n       promised to provide temporary alternative work\n       assignments to employees \u201cunable to perform their\n       normal work assignments due to an on-the-job in-\n       jury.\u201d App. 547 (emphasis added); see also Memo-\n       randum 8, 45\u201346.\n    8. The collective-bargaining agreement also provided\n       that UPS would \u201cmake a good faith effort to comply\n       . . . with requests for a reasonable accommodation\n       because of a permanent disability\u201d under the ADA.\n       App. 548; see also Memorandum 7.\n    9. The agreement further stated that UPS would give\n       \u201cinside\u201d jobs to drivers who had lost their DOT cer-\n       tifications because of a failed medical exam, a lost\n       driver\u2019s license, or involvement in a motor vehicle\n       accident.

When Young later asked UPS\u2019 Capital Division\n       Manager to accommodate her disability, he replied\n       that, while she was pregnant, she was \u201ctoo much of\n       a liability\u201d and could \u201cnot come back\u201d until she\n       \u201c \u2018was no longer pregnant.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 20.\n   11. Young remained on a leave of absence (without\n       pay) for much of her pregnancy. Id., at 49.\n   12. Young returned to work as a driver in June 2007,\n       about two months after her baby was born. Id., at\n       21, 61.\n  As direct evidence of intentional discrimination, Young\nrelied, in significant part, on the statement of the Capital\nDivision Manager (10 above). As evidence that she had\nmade out a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas,\nYoung relied, in significant part, on evidence showing that\nUPS would accommodate workers injured on the job (7),\nthose suffering from ADA disabilities (8), and those who\nhad lost their DOT certifications (9). That evidence, she\nsaid, showed that UPS had a light-duty-for-injury policy\nwith respect to numerous \u201cother persons,\u201d but not with\nrespect to pregnant workers. See Memorandum 29.\n  Young introduced further evidence indicating that UPS\nhad accommodated several individuals when they suffered\ndisabilities that created work restrictions similar to hers.\nUPS contests the correctness of some of these facts and\nthe relevance of others. See Brief for Respondent 5, 6, 57.\nBut because we are at the summary judgment stage, and\nbecause there is a genuine dispute as to these facts, we\nview this evidence in the light most favorable to Young,\nthe nonmoving party, see Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372,\n380 (2007):\n   13. Several employees received accommodations while\n       suffering various similar or more serious disabili-\n       ties incurred on the job. See App. 400\u2013401 (10\u2013\n       pound lifting limitation); id., at 635 (foot injury);\n8          YOUNG v.

Several employees received accommodations follow-\n        ing injury, where the record is unclear as to whether\n        the injury was incurred on or off the job. See id.,\n        at 381 (recurring knee injury); id., at 655 (ankle in-\n        jury); id., at 655 (knee injury); id., at 394\u2212398\n        (stroke); id., at 425, 636\u2013637 (leg injury).\n    15. Several employees received \u201cinside\u201d jobs after los-\n        ing their DOT certifications. See id., at 372 (DOT\n        certification suspended after conviction for driv-\n        ing under the influence); id., at 636, 647 (failed\n        DOT test due to high blood pressure); id., at 640\u2013\n        641 (DOT certification lost due to sleep apnea\n        diagnosis).\n    16. Some employees were accommodated despite the\n        fact that their disabilities had been incurred off the\n        job. See id., at 446 (ankle injury); id., at 433, 635\u2013\n        636 (cancer).\n    17.

Id., at *15.\n   On appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed. It wrote that\n\u201cUPS has crafted a pregnancy-blind policy\u201d that is \u201cat\nleast facially a \u2018neutral and legitimate business practice,\u2019\nand not evidence of UPS\u2019s discriminatory animus toward\npregnant workers.\u201d 707 F. 3d 437, 446 (2013). It also\nagreed with the District Court that Young could not show\nthat \u201csimilarly-situated employees outside the protected\nclass received more favorable treatment than Young.\u201d Id.,\nat 450. Specifically, it believed that Young was different\nfrom those workers who were \u201cdisabled under the ADA\u201d\n(which then protected only those with permanent disabili-\nties) because Young was \u201cnot disabled\u201d; her lifting limita-\ntion was only \u201ctemporary and not a significant restriction\non her ability to perform major life activities.\u201d Ibid.\nYoung was also different from those workers who had lost\ntheir DOT certifications because \u201cno legal obstacle stands\nbetween her and her work\u201d and because many with lost\nDOT certifications retained physical (i.e., lifting) capacity\nthat Young lacked. Ibid. And Young was different from\nthose \u201cinjured on the job because, quite simply, her inabil-\nity to work [did] not arise from an on-the-job injury.\u201d Id.,\nat 450\u2013451. Rather, Young more closely resembled \u201can\nemployee who injured his back while picking up his infant\nchild or . . . an employee whose lifting limitation arose\nfrom her off-the-job work as a volunteer firefighter,\u201d nei-\nther of whom would have been eligible for accommodation\nunder UPS\u2019 policies. Id., at 448.\n   Young filed a petition for certiorari essentially asking us\nto review the Fourth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the Preg-\nnancy Discrimination Act. In light of lower-court uncer-\ntainty about the interpretation of the Act, we granted the\npetition. Compare Ensley-Gaines v. Runyon, 100 F. 3d\n1220, 1226 (CA6 1996), with Urbano v.

In 2008, Congress expanded the\ndefinition of \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA to make clear that\n\u201cphysical or mental impairment[s] that substantially\nlimi[t]\u201d an individual\u2019s ability to lift, stand, or bend are\nADA-covered disabilities. ADA Amendments Act of 2008,\n122 Stat. 3555, codified at 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a712102(1)\u2013(2). As\ninterpreted by the EEOC, the new statutory definition\nrequires employers to accommodate employees whose\ntemporary lifting restrictions originate off the job. See 29\nCFR pt. 1630, App., \u00a71630.2(j)(1)(ix). We express no view\non these statutory and regulatory changes.\n                               II\n    The parties disagree about the interpretation of the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act\u2019s second clause. As we have\nsaid, see Part I\u2013B, supra, the Act\u2019s first clause specifies\nthat discrimination \u201c \u2018because of sex\u2019 \u201d includes discrimina-\ntion \u201cbecause of . . . pregnancy.\u201d But the meaning of the\nsecond clause is less clear; it adds: \u201c[W]omen affected by\npregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall\nbe treated the same for all employment-related purposes\n. . . as other persons not so affected but similar in their\nability or inability to work.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e(k) (empha-\nsis added). Does this clause mean that courts must com-\npare workers only in respect to the work limitations that\nthey suffer? Does it mean that courts must ignore all\nother similarities or differences between pregnant and\nnonpregnant workers? Or does it mean that courts, when\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeciding who the relevant \u201cother persons\u201d are, may con-\nsider other similarities and differences as well? If so,\nwhich ones?\n   The differences between these possible interpretations\ncome to the fore when a court, as here, must consider a\nworkplace policy that distinguishes between pregnant and\nnonpregnant workers in light of characteristics not related\nto pregnancy. Young poses the problem directly in her\nreply brief when she says that the Act requires giving \u201cthe\nsame accommodations to an employee with a pregnancy-\nrelated work limitation as it would give that employee if\nher work limitation stemmed from a different cause but\nhad a similar effect on her inability to work.\u201d Reply Brief\n15. Suppose the employer would not give \u201cthat [ pregnant]\nemployee\u201d the \u201csame accommodations\u201d as another employee,\nbut the employer\u2019s reason for the difference in treatment\nis that the pregnant worker falls within a facially neutral\ncategory (for example, individuals with off-the-job in-\njuries). What is a court then to do?\n   The parties propose very different answers to this ques-\ntion. Young and the United States believe that the second\nclause of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act \u201crequires an\nemployer to provide the same accommodations to work-\nplace disabilities caused by pregnancy that it provides to\nworkplace disabilities that have other causes but have a\nsimilar effect on the ability to work.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n23. In other words, Young contends that the second clause\nmeans that whenever \u201can employer accommodates only a\nsubset of workers with disabling conditions,\u201d a court\nshould find a Title VII violation if \u201cpregnant workers who\nare similar in the ability to work\u201d do not \u201creceive the same\n[accommodation] even if still other non-pregnant workers\ndo not receive accommodations.\u201d Id., at 28.\n   UPS takes an almost polar opposite view. It contends\nthat the second clause does no more than define sex dis-\ncrimination to include pregnancy discrimination. See\n12        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Respondent 25. Under this view, courts would\ncompare the accommodations an employer provides to\npregnant women with the accommodations it provides to\nothers within a facially neutral category (such as those\nwith off-the-job injuries) to determine whether the em-\nployer has violated Title VII. Cf. post, at 4 (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting) (hereinafter the dissent) (the clause \u201cdoes not\nprohibit denying pregnant women accommodations . . . on\nthe basis of an evenhanded policy\u201d).\n                              A\n   We cannot accept either of these interpretations. Young\nasks us to interpret the second clause broadly and, in her\nview, literally. As just noted, she argues that, as long as\n\u201can employer accommodates only a subset of workers with\ndisabling conditions,\u201d \u201cpregnant workers who are similar\nin the ability to work [must] receive the same treatment\neven if still other nonpregnant workers do not receive\naccommodations.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 28. She adds that,\nbecause the record here contains \u201cevidence that pregnant\nand nonpregnant workers were not treated the same,\u201d that\nis the end of the matter, she must win; there is no need to\nrefer to McDonnell Douglas. Brief for Petitioner 47.\n   The problem with Young\u2019s approach is that it proves too\nmuch. It seems to say that the statute grants pregnant\nworkers a \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d status. As long as an\nemployer provides one or two workers with an accommo-\ndation\u2014say, those with particularly hazardous jobs, or\nthose whose workplace presence is particularly needed, or\nthose who have worked at the company for many years, or\nthose who are over the age of 55\u2014then it must provide\nsimilar accommodations to all pregnant workers (with\ncomparable physical limitations), irrespective of the na-\nture of their jobs, the employer\u2019s need to keep them work-\ning, their ages, or any other criteria.\n   Lower courts have concluded that this could not have\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbeen Congress\u2019 intent in passing the Pregnancy Discrimi-\nnation Act. See, e.g., Urbano, 138 F. 3d, at 206\u2013208;\nReeves, 466 F. 3d, at 641; Serednyj, 656 F. 3d, at 548\u2013549;\nSpivey, 196 F. 3d, at 1312\u20131313. And Young partially\nagrees, for she writes that \u201cthe statute does not require\nemployers to give\u201d to \u201cpregnant workers all of the benefits\nand privileges it extends to other\u201d similarly disabled \u201cem-\nployees when those benefits and privileges are . . . based\non the employee\u2019s tenure or position within the company.\u201d\nReply Brief 15\u201316; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 22\n(\u201c[S]eniority, full-time work, different job classifications,\nall of those things would be permissible distinctions for\nan employer to make to differentiate among who gets\nbenefits\u201d).\n   Young\u2019s last-mentioned concession works well with\nrespect to seniority, for Title VII itself contains a seniority\ndefense, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(h). Hence, seniority is\nnot part of the problem. But otherwise the most-favored-\nnation problem remains, and Young\u2019s concession does not\nsolve it. How, for example, should a court treat special\nbenefits attached to injuries arising out of, say, extra-\nhazardous duty? If Congress intended to allow differences\nin treatment arising out of special duties, special service,\nor special needs, why would it not also have wanted\ncourts to take account of differences arising out of special\n\u201ccauses\u201d\u2014for example, benefits for those who drive (and\nare injured) in extrahazardous conditions?\n   We agree with UPS to this extent: We doubt that Con-\ngress intended to grant pregnant workers an unconditional\nmost-favored-nation status. The language of the statute\ndoes not require that unqualified reading. The second\nclause, when referring to nonpregnant persons with simi-\nlar disabilities, uses the open-ended term \u201cother persons.\u201d\nIt does not say that the employer must treat pregnant\nemployees the \u201csame\u201d as \u201cany other persons\u201d (who are\nsimilar in their ability or inability to work), nor does it\n14        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\notherwise specify which other persons Congress had in\nmind.\n  Moreover, disparate-treatment law normally permits an\nemployer to implement policies that are not intended to\nharm members of a protected class, even if their imple-\nmentation sometimes harms those members, as long as\nthe employer has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpre-\ntextual reason for doing so. See, e.g., Raytheon, 540 U. S.,\nat 51\u201355; Burdine, 450 U. S., at 252\u2013258; McDonnell\nDouglas, 411 U. S., at 802. There is no reason to believe\nCongress intended its language in the Pregnancy Discrim-\nination Act to embody a significant deviation from this\napproach. Indeed, the relevant House Report specifies\nthat the Act \u201creflect[s] no new legislative mandate.\u201d H. R.\nRep. No. 95\u2013948, pp. 3\u20134 (1978) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.).\nAnd the Senate Report states that the Act was designed to\n\u201creestablis[h] the law as it was understood prior to\u201d this\nCourt\u2019s decision in General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429\nU. S. 125 (1976). S. Rep. No. 95\u2013331, p. 8 (1978) (herein-\nafter S. Rep.). See Gilbert, supra, at 147 (Brennan, J.,\ndissenting) (lower courts had held that a disability plan\nthat compensates employees for temporary disabilities but\nnot pregnancy violates Title VII); see also AT&T Corp. v.\nHulteen, 556 U. S. 701, 717, n. 2 (2009) (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting).\n                              B\n  Before Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination\nAct, the EEOC issued guidance stating that \u201c[d]isabilities\ncaused or contributed to by pregnancy . . . are, for all job-\nrelated purposes, temporary disabilities\u201d and that \u201cthe\navailability of . . . benefits and privileges . . . shall be\napplied to disability due to pregnancy or childbirth on the\nsame terms and conditions as they are applied to other\ntemporary disabilities.\u201d      29 CFR \u00a71604.10(b) (1975).\nIndeed, as early as 1972, EEOC guidelines provided:\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cDisabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy . . .\nare, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and\nshould be treated as such under any health or temporary\ndisability insurance or sick leave plan available in connec-\ntion with employment.\u201d 37 Fed. Reg. 6837 (1972) (codified\nin 29 CFR \u00a71604.10(b) (1973)).\n   Soon after the Act was passed, the EEOC issued guid-\nance consistent with its pre-Act statements. The EEOC\nexplained: \u201cDisabilities caused or contributed to by preg-\nnancy . . . for all job-related purposes, shall be treated the\nsame as disabilities caused or contributed to by other\nmedical conditions.\u201d See \u00a71604.10(b) (1979). Moreover,\nthe EEOC stated that \u201c[i]f other employees temporarily\nunable to lift are relieved of these functions, pregnant\nemployees also unable to lift must be temporarily relieved\nof the function.\u201d 29 CFR pt. 1604, App., p. 918.\n   This post-Act guidance, however, does not resolve the\nambiguity of the term \u201cother persons\u201d in the Act\u2019s second\nclause. Rather, it simply tells employers to treat pregnancy-\nrelated disabilities like nonpregnancy-related disabilities,\nwithout clarifying how that instruction should be imple-\nmented when an employer does not treat all nonpregnancy-\nrelated disabilities alike.\n   More recently\u2014in July 2014\u2014the EEOC promulgated\nan additional guideline apparently designed to address\nthis ambiguity. That guideline says that \u201c[a]n employer\nmay not refuse to treat a pregnant worker the same as\nother employees who are similar in their ability or inabil-\nity to work by relying on a policy that makes distinctions\nbased on the source of an employee\u2019s limitations (e.g., a\npolicy of providing light duty only to workers injured on\nthe job).\u201d 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7626\u2013I(A)(5), p.\n626:0009 (July 2014). The EEOC also provided an exam-\nple of disparate treatment that would violate the Act:\n    \u201cAn employer has a policy or practice of providing\n16         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     light duty, subject to availability, for any employee\n     who cannot perform one or more job duties for up to\n     90 days due to injury, illness, or a condition that\n     would be a disability under the ADA. An employee\n     requests a light duty assignment for a 20\u2013pound lift-\n     ing restriction related to her pregnancy. The em-\n     ployer denies the light duty request.\u201d Id., at 626:0013,\n     Example 10.\nThe EEOC further added that \u201can employer may not deny\nlight duty to a pregnant employee based on a policy that\nlimits light duty to employees with on-the-job injuries.\u201d\nId., at 626:0028.\n   The Solicitor General argues that we should give spe-\ncial, if not controlling, weight to this guideline. He points\nout that we have long held that \u201cthe rulings, interpreta-\ntions and opinions\u201d of an agency charged with the mission\nof enforcing a particular statute, \u201cwhile not controlling\nupon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute\na body of experience and informed judgment to which\ncourts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\u201d\nSkidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944). See\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26.\n   But we have also held that the \u201cweight of such a judg-\nment in a particular case will depend upon the thorough-\nness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reason-\ning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,\nand all those factors that give it power to persuade, if\nlacking power to control.\u201d Skidmore, supra, at 140. These\nqualifications are relevant here and severely limit the\nEEOC\u2019s July 2014 guidance\u2019s special power to persuade.\n   We come to this conclusion not because of any agency\nlack of \u201cexperience\u201d or \u201cinformed judgment.\u201d Rather, the\ndifficulties are those of timing, \u201cconsistency,\u201d and \u201cthor-\noughness\u201d of \u201cconsideration.\u201d The EEOC promulgated its\n2014 guidelines only recently, after this Court had granted\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncertiorari in this case. In these circumstances, it is fair to\nsay that the EEOC\u2019s current guidelines take a position\nabout which the EEOC\u2019s previous guidelines were silent.\nAnd that position is inconsistent with positions for\nwhich the Government has long advocated. See Brief for\nDefendant-Appellee in Ensley-Gaines v. Runyon, No. 95\u2013\n1038 (CA6 1996), pp. 26\u201327 (explaining that a reading of the\nAct like Young\u2019s was \u201csimply incorrect\u201d and \u201cruns counter\u201d\nto this Court\u2019s precedents). See also Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 2 (\u201cThe Department of\nJustice, on behalf of the United States Postal Service, has\npreviously taken the position that pregnant employees\nwith work limitations are not similarly situated to em-\nployees with similar limitations caused by on-the-job\ninjuries\u201d). Nor does the EEOC explain the basis of its\nlatest guidance. Does it read the statute, for example,\nas embodying a most-favored-nation status? Why has it\nnow taken a position contrary to the litigation position\nthe Government previously took?           Without further\nexplanation, we cannot rely significantly on the EEOC\u2019s\ndetermination.\n                               C\n    We find it similarly difficult to accept the opposite in-\nterpretation of the Act\u2019s second clause. UPS says that the\nsecond clause simply defines sex discrimination to include\npregnancy discrimination. See Brief for Respondent 25.\nBut that cannot be so.\n    The first clause accomplishes that objective when it\nexpressly amends Title VII\u2019s definitional provision to\nmake clear that Title VII\u2019s words \u201cbecause of sex\u201d and \u201con\nthe basis of sex\u201d \u201cinclude, but are not limited to, because of\nor on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical\nconditions.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e(k). We have long held that\n\u201c \u2018a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that,\nif it can be prevented, no clause\u2019 \u201d is rendered \u201c \u2018superflu-\n18         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nous, void, or insignificant.\u2019 \u201d TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534\nU. S. 19, 31 (2001) (quoting Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S.\n167, 174 (2001)). But that is what UPS\u2019 interpretation of\nthe second clause would do.\n   The dissent, basically accepting UPS\u2019 interpretation,\nsays that the second clause is not \u201csuperfluous\u201d because it\nadds \u201cclarity.\u201d Post, at 4\u20135 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). It makes \u201cplain,\u201d the dissent adds, that unlaw-\nful discrimination \u201cincludes disfavoring pregnant women\nrelative to other workers of similar inability to work.\u201d\nPost, at 5. Perhaps we fail to understand. McDonnell\nDouglas itself makes clear that courts normally consider\nhow a plaintiff was treated relative to other \u201cpersons of\n[the plaintiff \u2019s] qualifications\u201d (which here include disabil-\nities). 411 U. S., at 802. If the second clause of the Act did\nnot exist, we would still say that an employer who disfa-\nvored pregnant women relative to other workers of similar\nability or inability to work had engaged in pregnancy\ndiscrimination. In a word, there is no need for the \u201cclarifi-\ncation\u201d that the dissent suggests the second sentence\nprovides.\n   Moreover, the interpretation espoused by UPS and the\ndissent would fail to carry out an important congressional\nobjective. As we have noted, Congress\u2019 \u201cunambiguou[s]\u201d\nintent in passing the Act was to overturn \u201cboth the holding\nand the reasoning of the Court in the Gilbert decision.\u201d\nNewport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462\nU. S. 669, 678 (1983); see also post, at 6 (recognizing that\n\u201cthe object of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is to dis-\nplace this Court\u2019s conclusion in [Gilbert]\u201d). In Gilbert, the\nCourt considered a company plan that provided \u201cnonoccu-\npational sickness and accident benefits to all employees\u201d\nwithout providing \u201cdisability-benefit payments for any\nabsence due to pregnancy.\u201d 429 U.

Although\npregnancy is \u201cconfined to women,\u201d the majority believed it\nwas not \u201ccomparable in all other respects to [the] diseases\nor disabilities\u201d that the plan covered. Id., at 136. Specifi-\ncally, the majority explained that pregnancy \u201cis not a\n\u2018disease\u2019 at all,\u201d nor is it necessarily a result of accident.\nIbid. Neither did the majority see the distinction the\nplan drew as \u201ca subterfuge\u201d or a \u201cpretext\u201d for engaging in\ngender-based discrimination. Ibid. In short, the Gilbert\nmajority reasoned in part just as the dissent reasons here.\nThe employer did \u201cnot distinguish between pregnant\nwomen and others of similar ability or inability because of\npregnancy.\u201d Post, at 2. It distinguished between them on\na neutral ground\u2014i.e., it accommodated only sicknesses\nand accidents, and pregnancy was neither of those. See\n429 U. S., at 136.\n   Simply including pregnancy among Title VII\u2019s protected\ntraits (i.e., accepting UPS\u2019 interpretation) would not over-\nturn Gilbert in full\u2014in particular, it would not respond to\nGilbert\u2019s determination that an employer can treat preg-\nnancy less favorably than diseases or disabilities resulting\nin a similar inability to work. As we explained in Califor-\nnia Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272\n(1987), \u201cthe first clause of the [Act] reflects Congress\u2019\ndisapproval of the reasoning in Gilbert\u201d by \u201cadding preg-\nnancy to the definition of sex discrimination prohibited by\nTitle VII.\u201d Id., at 284. But the second clause was intended\nto do more than that\u2014it \u201cwas intended to overrule the\nholding in Gilbert and to illustrate how discrimination\nagainst pregnancy is to be remedied.\u201d Id., at 285. The\ndissent\u2019s view, like that of UPS\u2019, ignores this precedent.\n                            III\n  The statute lends itself to an interpretation other than\nthose that the parties advocate and that the dissent sets\n20        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforth. Our interpretation minimizes the problems we have\ndiscussed, responds directly to Gilbert, and is consistent\nwith longstanding interpretations of Title VII.\n  In our view, an individual pregnant worker who seeks to\nshow disparate treatment through indirect evidence may\ndo so through application of the McDonnell Douglas\nframework. That framework requires a plaintiff to make\nout a prima facie case of discrimination. But it is \u201cnot\nintended to be an inflexible rule.\u201d Furnco Constr. Corp. v.\nWaters, 438 U. S. 567, 575 (1978). Rather, an individual\nplaintiff may establish a prima facie case by \u201cshowing\nactions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if\nsuch actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely\nthan not that such actions were based on a discriminatory\ncriterion illegal under\u201d Title VII. Id., at 576 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The burden of making this\nshowing is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d Burdine, 450 U. S., at 253. In\nparticular, making this showing is not as burdensome as\nsucceeding on \u201can ultimate finding of fact as to\u201d a discrim-\ninatory employment action. Furnco, supra, at 576. Nei-\nther does it require the plaintiff to show that those whom\nthe employer favored and those whom the employer disfa-\nvored were similar in all but the protected ways. See\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U. S., at 802 (burden met where\nplaintiff showed that employer hired other \u201cqualified\u201d\nindividuals outside the protected class); Furnco, supra, at\n575\u2013577 (same); Burdine, supra, at 253 (same).

S., at 802. But, consistent with the Act\u2019s basic\nobjective, that reason normally cannot consist simply of a\nclaim that it is more expensive or less convenient to add\npregnant women to the category of those (\u201csimilar in their\nability or inability to work\u201d) whom the employer accom-\nmodates. After all, the employer in Gilbert could in all\nlikelihood have made just such a claim.\n   If the employer offers an apparently \u201clegitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory\u201d reason for its actions, the plaintiff may in\nturn show that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons are in fact\npretextual. We believe that the plaintiff may reach a jury\non this issue by providing sufficient evidence that the\nemployer\u2019s policies impose a significant burden on preg-\nnant workers, and that the employer\u2019s \u201clegitimate, nondis-\ncriminatory\u201d reasons are not sufficiently strong to justify\nthe burden, but rather\u2014when considered along with the\nburden imposed\u2014give rise to an inference of intentional\ndiscrimination.\n   The plaintiff can create a genuine issue of material fact\nas to whether a significant burden exists by providing\nevidence that the employer accommodates a large per-\ncentage of nonpregnant workers while failing to accommo-\ndate a large percentage of pregnant workers. Here, for\nexample, if the facts are as Young says they are, she can\nshow that UPS accommodates most nonpregnant employ-\nees with lifting limitations while categorically failing to\naccommodate pregnant employees with lifting limitations.\nYoung might also add that the fact that UPS has multiple\npolicies that accommodate nonpregnant employees with\nlifting restrictions suggests that its reasons for failing to\naccommodate pregnant employees with lifting restrictions\nare not sufficiently strong\u2014to the point that a jury could\n22        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfind that its reasons for failing to accommodate preg-\nnant employees give rise to an inference of intentional\ndiscrimination.\n   This approach, though limited to the Pregnancy Dis-\ncrimination Act context, is consistent with our longstand-\ning rule that a plaintiff can use circumstantial proof to\nrebut an employer\u2019s apparently legitimate, nondiscrimina-\ntory reasons for treating individuals within a protected\nclass differently than those outside the protected class.\nSee Burdine, supra, at 255, n. 10. In particular, it is\nhardly anomalous (as the dissent makes it out to be, see\npost, at 8\u20139) that a plaintiff may rebut an employer\u2019s\nproffered justifications by showing how a policy operates\nin practice. In McDonnell Douglas itself, we noted that an\nemployer\u2019s \u201cgeneral policy and practice with respect to\nminority employment\u201d\u2014including \u201cstatistics as to\u201d that\npolicy and practice\u2014could be evidence of pretext. 411\nU. S., at 804\u2013805. Moreover, the continued focus on\nwhether the plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence to\ngive rise to an inference of intentional discrimination\navoids confusing the disparate-treatment and disparate-\nimpact doctrines, cf. post, at 8\u201310.\n   Our interpretation of the Act is also, unlike the dis-\nsent\u2019s, consistent with Congress\u2019 intent to overrule Gil-\nbert\u2019s reasoning and result. The dissent says that \u201c[i]f a\npregnant woman is denied an accommodation under a\npolicy that does not discriminate against pregnancy, she\nhas been \u2018treated the same\u2019 as everyone else.\u201d Post, at 2.\nThis logic would have found no problem with the employer\nplan in Gilbert, which \u201cdenied an accommodation\u201d to\npregnant women on the same basis as it denied accommo-\ndations to other employees\u2014i.e., it accommodated only\nsicknesses and accidents, and pregnancy was neither of\nthose. See Part II\u2013C, supra. In arguing to the contrary,\nthe dissent\u2019s discussion of Gilbert relies exclusively on the\nopinions of the dissenting Justices in that case.

We have\nalready outlined the evidence Young introduced. See Part\nI\u2013C, supra. Viewing the record in the light most favorable\nto Young, there is a genuine dispute as to whether UPS\nprovided more favorable treatment to at least some em-\nployees whose situation cannot reasonably be distin-\nguished from Young\u2019s. In other words, Young created a\ngenuine dispute of material fact as to the fourth prong of\nthe McDonnell Douglas analysis.\n   Young also introduced evidence that UPS had three\nseparate accommodation policies (on-the-job, ADA, DOT).\nTaken together, Young argued, these policies significantly\nburdened pregnant women. See App. 504 (shop steward\u2019s\ntestimony that \u201cthe only light duty requested [due to\nphysical] restrictions that became an issue\u201d at UPS \u201cwere\nwith women who were pregnant\u201d). The Fourth Circuit did\nnot consider the combined effects of these policies, nor did\nit consider the strength of UPS\u2019 justifications for each\nwhen combined. That is, why, when the employer accom-\nmodated so many, could it not accommodate pregnant\nwomen as well?\n   We do not determine whether Young created a genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether UPS\u2019 reasons for\nhaving treated Young less favorably than it treated these\nother nonpregnant employees were pretextual.

S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1), made it an unlawful\nemployment practice to discriminate \u201cbecause of [an] in-\ndividual\u2019s . . . sex\u201d but made no mention of discrimina-\ntion because of pregnancy. In General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert,\n429 U. S. 125, 135\u2013140 (1976), this Court held that Title\nVII did not reach pregnancy discrimination. Congress\nresponded by enacting the Pregnancy Discrimination Act\n(PDA), which added subsection (k) to a definitional provi-\nsion, \u00a72000e. Subsection (k) contains two clauses. The\nfirst is straightforward; the second is not.\n                              I\n  The first clause provides that \u201cthe terms \u2018because of sex\u2019\nor \u2018on the basis of sex\u2019 include, but are not limited to,\nbecause of or on the basis of pregnancy.\u201d1 This clause has\nthe effect of adding pregnancy to the list of prohibited\ngrounds (race, sex, etc.) originally included in \u00a72000e\u2013\n2(a)(1). Claims of discrimination under that provision\nrequire proof of discriminatory intent. See, e.g., Ricci v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 While   \u00a72000e\u20132(a) uses the phrase \u201cbecause of . . . sex,\u201d other provi-\nsions governed by the definitions in \u00a72000e use the phrase \u201con the basis\nof . . . sex.\u201d See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132(b), (k)(1)(A). Therefore, subsection (k)\ncovers this phrase as well.\n2         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nDeStefano, 557 U. S. 557, 577 (2009); Watson v. Fort\nWorth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 985\u2013986 (1988).\nThus, as a result of the first clause, an employer engages\nin unlawful discrimination under \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1) if (and\nonly if) the employer\u2019s intent is to discriminate because of\nor on the basis of pregnancy.\n   If an employer treats a pregnant woman unfavorably for\nany other reason, the employer is not guilty of an unlawful\nemployment practice under \u00a72000e\u20132(a), as defined by the\nfirst clause of the PDA. And under this first clause, it does\nnot matter whether the employer\u2019s ground for the unfa-\nvorable treatment is reasonable; all that matters is the\nemployer\u2019s actual intent. Of course, when an employer\nclaims to have made a decision for a reason that does not\nseem to make sense, a factfinder may infer that the em-\nployer\u2019s asserted reason for its action is a pretext for un-\nlawful discrimination. But if the factfinder is convinced\nthat the employer acted for some reason other than preg-\nnancy, the employer cannot be held liable under this\nclause.\n                              II\n   The PDA, however, does not simply prohibit discrimina-\ntion because of or on the basis of pregnancy. Instead, the\nsecond clause in \u00a72000e(k) goes on to say the follow-\ning: \u201cand women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or re-\nlated medical conditions shall be treated the same for all\nemployment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits\nunder fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so\naffected but similar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d\nThis clause raises several difficult questions of interpreta-\ntion that are pertinent to the case now before us.\n                             A\n  First, does this clause simply explain what is meant by\ndiscrimination because of or on the basis of pregnancy? Or\n                      Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndoes it impose an additional restriction on employer con-\nduct? I believe that this clause does not merely explain\nbut instead adds to the language that precedes it.\n   This is the interpretation that is most consistent with\nthe statutory text. This clause begins with the word\n\u201cand,\u201d which certainly suggests that what follows repre-\nsents an addition to what came before.\n   It is also revealing that the second clause makes no\nreference to intent, which is the linchpin of liability under\nthe first clause, and that the second clause is an affirma-\ntive command (an employer \u201cshall\u201d provide equal treat-\nment), while the first clause is negative (it prohibits dis-\ncrimination). If a careful drafter wanted to make it clear\nthat the second clause does no more than explain what is\nmeant by the first, the language of the second clause\nwould have to be substantially modified.\n   Finally, if the second clause does not set out an addi-\ntional restriction on employer conduct, it would appear to\nbe largely, if not entirely, superfluous. See, e.g., Arlington\nCentral School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U. S. 291,\n299, n. 1 (2006) (\u201c[I]t is generally presumed that statutes\ndo not contain surplusage\u201d). As noted, the first clause, by\nadding pregnancy to the list of prohibited grounds for\nadverse employment actions, mandates that discrimina-\ntion because of pregnancy be treated like discrimination\nbecause of race, sex, etc. An employer commits an unlaw-\nful employment practice if it intentionally treats employ-\nees of a particular race or sex less favorably than other\nemployees who are similar in their ability or inability to\nwork. Accordingly, the first clause of the PDA is alone\nsufficient to make it clear that an employer is guilty of an\nunlawful employment practice if it intentionally treats\npregnant employees less favorably than others who are\nsimilar in their ability or inability to work.2 For these\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 2 JUSTICE   SCALIA\u2019s dissent argues, post, at 4\u20136, that the second clause\n4           YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nreasons, I conclude that the second clause does not merely\nexplain the first but adds a further requirement of equal\ntreatment irrespective of intent.\n                            B\n  This leads to the second question: In determining\nwhether pregnant employees have been given the equal\ntreatment that this provision demands, with whom must\nthe pregnant employees be compared? I interpret the\nsecond clause to mean that pregnant employees must be\ncompared with employees performing the same or very\nsimilar jobs. Pregnant employees, the second provision\nstates, must be given the same treatment as other em-\nployees who are \u201csimilar in their ability or inability to\nwork.\u201d An employee\u2019s ability to work\u2014despite illness,\ninjury, or pregnancy\u2014often depends on the tasks that the\nemployee\u2019s job includes. Different jobs have different\ntasks, and different tasks require different abilities.\nSuppose that an employer provides a period of leave with\npay for employees whose jobs require tasks, e.g., lifting\nheavy objects, that they cannot perform because of illness\nor injury. Must the employer provide the same benefits\nfor pregnant employees who are unable to lift heavy ob-\njects but have desk jobs that do not entail heavy lifting?\nThe answer is no. The treatment of pregnant employees\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nserves the useful purpose of clarifying the meaning of discrimination\nbecause of pregnancy. Without the second clause, that dissent main-\ntains, there might be uncertainty as to whether an employer would\ncommit an unlawful employment practice if it excluded pregnancy from\nan otherwise complete disability benefits program. Contrary to the\ndissent, however, I think that the answer to this question would be\nquite obvious based on the first clause of the PDA alone. If an employer\nprovided benefits for every employee who was temporarily unable to\nwork due to any physical condition other than pregnancy, that em-\nployer would be in the same position as an employer who provided similar\nbenefits for employees of every race but one. In both situations, the\nemployer would clearly discriminate on a prohibited ground.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmust be compared with the treatment of nonpregnant\nemployees whose jobs involve the performance of the same\nor very similar tasks.\n                               C\n  This conclusion leads to a third, even more difficult\nquestion: When comparing pregnant employees to non-\npregnant employees in similar jobs, which characteristics\nof the pregnant and nonpregnant employees must be\ntaken into account? The answer, I believe, must be found\nin the reference to \u201cother employees who are similar in\ntheir ability or inability to work.\u201d I see two possible inter-\npretations of this language. The first is that the capacity\nto perform the tasks required by a job is the only relevant\ncharacteristic, but like the Court, ante, at 12\u201314, I cannot\naccept this \u201cmost favored employee\u201d interpretation.\n  This interpretation founders when, as in this case, an\nemployer treats pregnant women less favorably than some\nbut not all nonpregnant employees who have similar jobs\nand are similarly impaired in their ability to perform the\ntasks that these jobs require. In this case, as I will ex-\nplain below, see Part III, United Parcel Service (UPS)\ndrivers who were unable to perform the physical tasks\nrequired by that job fell into three groups: first, nonpreg-\nnant employees who received favorable treatment; second,\nnonpregnant employees who do not receive favorable\ntreatment; and third, pregnant employees who, like the\nnonpregnant employees in the second category, did not\nreceive favorable treatment. Under these circumstances,\nwould the \u201cmost favored employee\u201d interpretation require\nthe employer to treat the pregnant women like the em-\nployees in the first, favored group? Or would it be suffi-\ncient if the employer treated them the same as the non-\npregnant employees in the second group who did not\nreceive favorable treatment?\n  Recall that the second clause of \u00a72000e(k) requires that\n6            YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\npregnant women \u201cbe treated the same for all employment-\nrelated purposes . . . as other persons not so affected but\nsimilar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) Therefore, UPS could say that its policy treated\nthe pregnant employees the same as \u201cother persons\u201d who\nwere similar in their ability or inability to work, namely,\nthose nonpregnant employees in the second category. But\nat the same time, the pregnant drivers like petitioner\ncould say that UPS did not treat them the same as \u201cother\nemployees\u201d who were similar in their ability or inability to\nwork, namely, the nonpregnant employees in the first\ngroup. An interpretation that leads to such a problem\ncannot be correct.3\n  I therefore turn to the other possible interpretation of\nthe phrase \u201csimilar in their ability or inability to work,\u201d\nnamely, that \u201csimilar in the ability or inability to work\u201d\nmeans \u201csimilar in relation to the ability or inability to\nwork.\u201d4 Under this interpretation, pregnant and non-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 The\u201cmost favored employee\u201d interpretation would also lead to wildly\nimplausible results. Suppose, for example, that an employer had a\npolicy of refusing to provide any accommodation for any employee who\nwas unable to work due to any reason but that the employer wished to\nmake an exception for several employees who were seriously injured\nwhile performing acts of extraordinary heroism on the job, for example,\nsaving the lives of numerous fellow employees during a fire in the\nworkplace. If the ability to perform job tasks was the only characteris-\ntic that could be considered, the employer would face the choice of\neither denying any special treatment for the heroic employees or\nproviding all the same benefits to all pregnant employees. It is most\nunlikely that this is what Congress intended. Such a requirement\nwould go beyond anything demanded by any other antidiscrimination\nlaw.\n   4 Opinions have often used the phrase \u201csimilar in\u201d to mean \u201csimilar in\n\nrelation to\u201d or \u201csimilar with respect to.\u201d See, e.g., Kiobel v. Royal Dutch\nPetroleum Co., 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (BREYER, J., concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 3) (\u201csimilar in character and specificity to piracy\u201d);\nWilliams v.

And this means that these two groups\nof employees are not similar in the relevant sense if the\nemployer has a neutral business reason for treating them\ndifferently. I agree with the Court that a sufficient reason\n\u201cnormally cannot consist simply of a claim that it is more\nexpensive or less convenient to add pregnant women to the\ncategory of those . . . whom the employer accommodates.\u201d\nAnte, at 21.5 Otherwise, however, I do not think that the\nsecond clause of the PDA authorizes courts to evaluate the\njustification for a truly neutral rule. The language used in\nthe second clause of the PDA is quite different from that\nused in other antidiscrimination provisions that require\nsuch an evaluation. Cf. \u00a712112(b)(5)(A) (discrimination\nagainst a person with a disability includes \u201cnot making\nreasonable accommodations to the known physical or\nmental limitations of an otherwise qualified . . . employee,\nunless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommo-\ndation would impose an undue hardship on the operation\nof [its] business\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a72000e( j) (employer\nmust reasonably accommodate religious observance, prac-\ntice, and belief unless that would impose an \u201cundue hard-\nship on the conduct of the employer\u2019s business\u201d); \u00a72000e\u2013\n2(k)(1)(A)(i) (business necessity defense in Title VII\ndisparate-impact cases).\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprevent\u201d).

With\nrespect to her claim under the first clause, I agree with the\nCourt that the information in the summary judgment\nrecord is sufficient (albeit barely) to take the question to\nthe trier of fact.\n  I believe that the judgment of the Court of Appeals with\nrespect to petitioner\u2019s claim under the second clause must\nalso be vacated. Petitioner sought to be excused during\nher pregnancy from the lifting requirements that were\namong her tasks as a driver. Under the policy that United\nParcel Service claims to have had in force at the time in\nquestion, drivers who were physically unable to perform\nthe tasks required by that position fell into three groups.\n  First, some drivers were reassigned to less physically\ndemanding positions. Included in this group were (a)\nthose who were unable to work as drivers due to an injury\nincurred on the job, (b) those drivers who were unable to\nwork as drivers due to a disability as defined by the Amer-\nicans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and (c) those\ndrivers who, as the result of a medical condition or injury,\nlost the Department of Transportation (DOT) certification\nneeded to work in that capacity.\n  The second group of drivers consisted of those who were\nnot pregnant and were denied transfer to a light-duty job.\nDrivers who were injured off the job fell into this category.\nThe third group was made up of pregnant drivers like\npetitioner.\n  It is obvious that respondent had a neutral reason for\nproviding an accommodation when that was required by\nthe ADA. Respondent also had neutral grounds for\nproviding special accommodations for employees who were\ninjured on the job. If these employees had not been per-\nmitted to work at all, it appears that they would have\nbeen eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See Md.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Such drivers may then be transferred to jobs that\ndo not require physical tasks incompatible with their\nillness or injury. It does not appear that respondent has\nprovided any plausible justification for treating these\ndrivers more favorably than drivers who were pregnant.\n   The Court of Appeals provided two grounds for distin-\nguishing petitioner\u2019s situation from that of the drivers who\nhad lost their DOT certifications, see 707 F. 3d 437, 450\n(CA4 2013), but neither is adequate. First, the Court of\nAppeals noted that \u201cno legal obstacle [stood] between\n[petitioner] and her work.\u201d Ibid. But the legal obstacle\nfaced by drivers who have lost DOT certification only\nexplains why those drivers could not continue to perform\nall the tasks required by their ordinary jobs; it does not\nexplain why respondent went further and provided such\ndrivers with a work accommodation. Petitioner\u2019s preg-\nnancy prevented her from continuing her normal work as a\ndriver, just as is the case for a driver who loses DOT certi-\nfication. But respondent had a policy of accommodating\ndrivers who lost DOT certification but not accommodating\npregnant women, like petitioner. The legal obstacle of lost\ncertification cannot explain this difference in treatment.\n   Second, the Court of Appeals observed that \u201c \u2018those with\nDOT certification maintai[n] the ability to perform any\nnumber of demanding physical tasks,\u2019 \u201d ibid., but it is\ndoubtful that this is true in all instances. A driver can\nlose DOT certification due to a great variety of\nmedical conditions, including loss of a limb, 49 CFR\n\u00a7391.41(b)(1) (2013); impairments of the arm, hand, finger,\nfoot, or leg, \u00a7391.41(b)(2)(i) and (ii); cardiovascular disease,\n10        YOUNG v.

It is not evident\u2014and as far as I\nam aware, the record does not show\u2014that all drivers with\nthese conditions are nevertheless able to perform a great\nmany physically demanding tasks. Nevertheless, re-\nspondent says that it was its policy to transfer such driv-\ners to so-called inside jobs when such positions were avail-\nable. Presumably, respondent did not assign these drivers\nto jobs that they were physically unable to perform. So in\nat least some instances, they must have been assigned to\njobs that did not require them to perform tasks that they\nwere incapable of performing due to the medical condition\nthat caused the loss of DOT certification. Respondent has\nnot explained why pregnant drivers could not have been\ngiven similar consideration.\n  For these reasons, it is not at all clear that respondent\nhad any neutral business ground for treating pregnant\ndrivers less favorably than at least some of its nonpreg-\nnant drivers who were reassigned to other jobs that they\nwere physically capable of performing. I therefore agree\nwith the Court that the decision of the Court of Appeals\nwith respect to petitioner\u2019s claim under the second clause\nof the PDA must be vacated, and the case must be re-\nmanded for further proceedings with respect to that claim.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Teamsters v.\nUnited States, 431 U. S. 324, 335\u2013336, n. 15 (1977). Peggy\nYoung did not establish pregnancy discrimination under\neither theory. She argued that United Parcel Service\u2019s\nrefusal to accommodate her inability to work amounted to\ndisparate treatment, but the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat she had not mustered evidence that UPS denied the\naccommodation with intent to disfavor pregnant women.\n707 F. 3d 437, 449\u2013451 (CA4 2013). And Young never\nbrought a claim of disparate impact.\n   That is why Young and the Court leave behind the part\nof the law defining pregnancy discrimination as sex dis-\ncrimination, and turn to the part requiring that \u201cwomen\naffected by pregnancy . . . be treated the same . . . as other\npersons not so affected but similar in their ability or in-\nability to work.\u201d \u00a72000e(k). The most natural way to\nunderstand the same-treatment clause is that an employer\nmay not distinguish between pregnant women and others\nof similar ability or inability because of pregnancy. Here,\nthat means pregnant women are entitled to accommoda-\ntions on the same terms as other workers with disabling\nconditions. If a pregnant woman is denied an accommoda-\ntion under a policy that does not discriminate against\npregnancy, she has been \u201ctreated the same\u201d as everyone\nelse. UPS\u2019s accommodation for drivers who lose their\ncertifications illustrates the point. A pregnant woman\nwho loses her certification gets the benefit, just like any\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nother worker who loses his. And a pregnant woman who\nkeeps her certification does not get the benefit, again just\nlike any other worker who keeps his. That certainly\nsounds like treating pregnant women and others the\nsame.\n   There is, however, another way to understand \u201ctreated\nthe same,\u201d at least looking at that phrase on its own. One\ncould read it to mean that an employer may not distin-\nguish at all between pregnant women and others of simi-\nlar ability. Here, that would mean pregnant women are\nentitled, not to accommodations on the same terms as\nothers, but to the same accommodations as others, no\nmatter the differences (other than pregnancy) between\nthem. UPS\u2019s accommodation for decertified drivers illus-\ntrates this usage too. There is a sense in which a preg-\nnant woman denied an accommodation (because she kept\nher certification) has not been treated the same as an\ninjured man granted an accommodation (because he lost\nhis certification). He got the accommodation and she did\nnot.\n   Of these two readings, only the first makes sense in the\ncontext of Title VII. The point of Title VII\u2019s bans on dis-\ncrimination is to prohibit employers from treating one\nworker differently from another because of a protected\ntrait. It is not to prohibit employers from treating workers\ndifferently for reasons that have nothing to do with pro-\ntected traits. See Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v.\nBurdine, 450 U. S. 248, 259 (1981). Against that back-\ndrop, a requirement that pregnant women and other\nworkers be treated the same is sensibly read to forbid\ndistinctions that discriminate against pregnancy, not all\ndistinctions whatsoever.\n   Prohibiting employers from making any distinctions\nbetween pregnant workers and others of similar ability\nwould elevate pregnant workers to most favored employ-\nees. If Boeing offered chauffeurs to injured directors, it\n4         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwould have to offer chauffeurs to pregnant mechanics.\nAnd if Disney paid pensions to workers who can no longer\nwork because of old age, it would have to pay pensions to\nworkers who can no longer work because of childbirth. It\nis implausible that Title VII, which elsewhere creates\nguarantees of equal treatment, here alone creates a guar-\nantee of favored treatment.\n   Let it not be overlooked, moreover, that the thrust of the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act is that pregnancy discrimi-\nnation is sex discrimination. Instead of creating a free-\nstanding ban on pregnancy discrimination, the Act makes\nplain that the existing ban on sex discrimination reaches\ndiscrimination because of pregnancy. Reading the same-\ntreatment clause to give pregnant women special protec-\ntion unavailable to other women would clash with this\ncentral theme of the Act, because it would mean that\npregnancy discrimination differs from sex discrimination\nafter all.\n   All things considered, then, the right reading of the\nsame-treatment clause prohibits practices that discrimi-\nnate against pregnant women relative to workers of simi-\nlar ability or inability. It does not prohibit denying preg-\nnant women accommodations, or any other benefit for that\nmatter, on the basis of an evenhanded policy.\n                              II\n  The Court agrees that the same-treatment clause is not\na most-favored-employee law, ante, at 12, but at the same\ntime refuses to adopt the reading I propose\u2014which is the\nonly other reading the clause could conceivably bear. The\nCourt\u2019s reasons for resisting this reading fail to persuade.\n  The Court starts by arguing that the same-treatment\nclause must do more than ban distinctions on the basis of\npregnancy, lest it add nothing to the part of the Act defin-\ning pregnancy discrimination as sex discrimination. Ante,\nat 17. Even so read, however, the same-treatment clause\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndoes add something: clarity. See Newport News Ship-\nbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 678,\nn. 14 (1983) (\u201c[T]he specific language in the second clause\n. . . explains the application of the [first clause]\u201d). Just\ndefining pregnancy discrimination as sex discrimination\ndoes not tell us what it means to discriminate because of\npregnancy. Does pregnancy discrimination include, in\naddition to disfavoring pregnant women relative to the\nworkplace in general, disfavoring them relative to disabled\nworkers in particular? Concretely, does an employer\nengage in pregnancy discrimination by excluding preg-\nnancy from an otherwise complete disability-benefits pro-\ngram? Without the same-treatment clause, the answers\nto these questions would not be obvious. An employer\ncould argue that people do not necessarily think of preg-\nnancy and childbirth as disabilities. Or that it would be\nanomalous to read a law defining pregnancy discrimina-\ntion as sex discrimination to require him to treat pregnancy\nlike a disability, when Title VII does not require him to\ntreat sex like a disability. Or that even if pregnancy were\na disability, it would be sui generis\u2014categorically different\nfrom all other disabling conditions. Cf. Geduldig v. Aiello,\n417 U. S. 484, 494\u2013495 (1974) (holding that a State has a\nrational basis for excluding pregnancy-related disabilities\nfrom a disability-benefits program). With the same-\ntreatment clause, these doubts disappear. By requiring\nthat women affected by pregnancy \u201cbe treated the same\n. . . as other persons not so affected but similar in their\nability or inability to work\u201d (emphasis added), the clause\nmakes plain that pregnancy discrimination includes disfa-\nvoring pregnant women relative to other workers of simi-\nlar inability to work.\n    This clarifying function easily overcomes any charge\nthat the reading I propose makes the same-treatment\nclause \u201c \u2018superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 17\u2013\n18. Perhaps, as the Court suggests, even without the\n6         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame-treatment clause the best reading of the Act would\nprohibit disfavoring pregnant women relative to disabled\nworkers. But laws often make explicit what might already\nhave been implicit, \u201cfor greater caution\u201d and in order \u201cto\nleave nothing to construction.\u201d The Federalist No. 33, pp.\n205\u2013206 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). That is why\nwe have long acknowledged that a \u201csufficient\u201d explanation\nfor the inclusion of a clause can be \u201cfound in the desire to\nremove all doubts\u201d about the meaning of the rest of the\ntext. McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 420 (1819).\nThis explanation looks all the more sensible once one\nremembers that the object of the Pregnancy Discrimina-\ntion Act is to displace this Court\u2019s conclusion in General\nElec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125 (1976), that pregnancy\ndiscrimination is not sex discrimination. What could be\nmore natural than for a law whose object is superseding\nearlier judicial interpretation to include a clause whose\nobject is leaving nothing to future judicial interpretation?\n   That brings me to the Court\u2019s remaining argument: the\nclaim that the reading I have set forth would not suffice to\noverturn our decision in Gilbert. Ante, at 18\u201320. Wrong.\nGilbert upheld an otherwise comprehensive disability-\nbenefits plan that singled pregnancy out for disfavor. The\nmost natural reading of the Act overturns that decision,\nbecause it prohibits singling pregnancy out for disfavor.\n   The Court goes astray here because it mistakenly as-\nsumes that the Gilbert plan excluded pregnancy on \u201ca\nneutral ground\u201d\u2014covering sicknesses and accidents but\nnothing else. Ante, at 19. In reality, the plan in Gilbert\nwas not neutral toward pregnancy. It \u201cplace[d] . . . preg-\nnancy in a class by itself,\u201d treating it differently from \u201cany\nother kind\u201d of condition. 429 U. S., at 161 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting).

What\nis more, the plan denied coverage even to sicknesses, if\nthey were related to pregnancy or childbirth. Ibid. For\nthat matter, the plan denied coverage to sicknesses that\nwere unrelated to pregnancy or childbirth, if they were\nsuffered during recovery from the birth of a child. Ibid.\nGilbert, there can be no doubt, involved \u201cthe lone exclusion\nof pregnancy from [a] program.\u201d Ibid. The most natural\ninterpretation of the Act easily suffices to make that\nunlawful.\n                             III\n  Dissatisfied with the only two readings that the words of\nthe same-treatment clause could possibly bear, the Court\ndecides that the clause means something in-between. It\ntakes only a couple of waves of the Supreme Wand to\nproduce the desired result. Poof!: The same-treatment\nclause means that a neutral reason for refusing to accom-\nmodate a pregnant woman is pretextual if \u201cthe employer\u2019s\npolicies impose a significant burden on pregnant workers.\u201d\nAnte, at 21. Poof!: This is so only when the employer\u2019s\nreasons \u201care not sufficiently strong to justify the burden.\u201d\nIbid.\n  How we got here from the same-treatment clause is\nanyone\u2019s guess. There is no way to read \u201cshall be treated\nthe same\u201d\u2014or indeed anything else in the clause\u2014to\nmean that courts must balance the significance of the\nburden on pregnant workers against the strength of the\nemployer\u2019s justifications for the policy. That is presum-\nably why the Court does not even try to connect the inter-\npretation it adopts with the text it purports to interpret.\nThe Court has forgotten that statutory purpose and the\npresumption against superfluity are tools for choosing\namong competing reasonable readings of a law, not au-\n8         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthorizations for making up new readings that the law\ncannot reasonably bear.\n   The fun does not stop there. Having ignored the terms\nof the same-treatment clause, the Court proceeds to bun-\ngle the dichotomy between claims of disparate treatment\nand claims of disparate impact. Normally, liability for\ndisparate treatment arises when an employment policy\nhas a \u201cdiscriminatory motive,\u201d while liability for disparate\nimpact arises when the effects of an employment policy\n\u201cfall more harshly on one group than another and cannot\nbe justified by business necessity.\u201d Teamsters, 431 U. S.,\nat 336, n. 15. In the topsy-turvy world created by today\u2019s\ndecision, however, a pregnant woman can establish dis-\nparate treatment by showing that the effects of her em-\nployer\u2019s policy fall more harshly on pregnant women than\non others (the policies \u201cimpose a significant burden on\npregnant workers,\u201d ante, at 21) and are inadequately\njustified (the \u201creasons are not sufficiently strong to justify\nthe burden,\u201d ibid.). The change in labels may be small,\nbut the change in results assuredly is not. Disparate-\ntreatment and disparate-impact claims come with differ-\nent standards of liability, different defenses, and different\nremedies. E.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71981a, 2000e\u20132(k). For\nexample, plaintiffs in disparate-treatment cases can get\ncompensatory and punitive damages as well as equitable\nrelief, but plaintiffs in disparate impact cases can get\nequitable relief only. See \u00a7\u00a71981a, 2000e\u20135(g). A sound\nreading of the same-treatment clause would preserve the\ndistinctions so carefully made elsewhere in the Act; the\nCourt\u2019s reading makes a muddle of them.\n   But (believe it or not) it gets worse. In order to make\nsense of its conflation of disparate impact with disparate\ntreatment, the Court claims that its new test is somehow\n\u201climited to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act context,\u201d yet\nat the same time \u201cconsistent with\u201d the traditional use of\ncircumstantial evidence to show intent to discriminate in\n                   Cite as: 575 U.

A court in a Title VII case,\ntrue enough, may consider a policy\u2019s effects and even its\njustifications\u2014along with \u201c \u2018all of the [other] surrounding\nfacts and circumstances\u2019 \u201d\u2014when trying to ferret out a\npolicy\u2019s motive. Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States,\n433 U. S. 299, 312 (1977). The Court cannot possibly\nthink, however, that its newfangled balancing test reflects\nthis conventional inquiry. It has, after all, just marched\nup and down the hill telling us that the same-treatment\nclause is not (no-no!) \u201c \u2018superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 17\u201318. If the clause merely instructed courts to\nconsider a policy\u2019s effects and justifications the way it\nconsiders other circumstantial evidence of motive, it would\nbe superfluous. So the Court\u2019s balancing test must mean\nsomething else. Even if the effects and justifications of\npolicies are not enough to show intent to discriminate\nunder ordinary Title VII principles, they could (Poof !) still\nshow intent to discriminate for purposes of the pregnancy\nsame-treatment clause. Deliciously incoherent.\n  And all of this to what end? The difference between a\nroutine circumstantial-evidence inquiry into motive and\ntoday\u2019s grotesque effects-and-justifications inquiry into\nmotive, it would seem, is that today\u2019s approach requires\njudges to concentrate on effects and justifications to the\nexclusion of other considerations. But Title VII already\nhas a framework that allows judges to home in on a pol-\nicy\u2019s effects and justifications\u2014disparate impact. Under\nthat framework, it is already unlawful for an employer to\nuse a practice that has a disparate impact on the basis of a\nprotected trait, unless (among other things) the employer\ncan show that the practice \u201cis job related . . . and con-\nsistent with business necessity.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A)(i).\nThe Court does not explain why we need (never mind how\nthe Act could possibly be read to contain) today\u2019s ersatz\ndisparate-impact test, under which the disparate-impact\nelement gives way to the significant-burden criterion and\n10        YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe business-necessity defense gives way to the sufficiently-\nstrong-justification standard. Today\u2019s decision can thus\nserve only one purpose: allowing claims that belong under\nTitle VII\u2019s disparate-impact provisions to be brought\nunder its disparate-treatment provisions instead.\n                              IV\n   JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concurrence agrees with the Court\u2019s\nrejection of both conceivable readings of the same-\ntreatment clause, but fashions a different compromise\nbetween them. Under its approach, an employer may\ndeny a pregnant woman a benefit granted to workers who\nperform similar tasks only on the basis of a \u201cneutral busi-\nness ground.\u201d Ante, at 10 (opinion concurring in judg-\nment). This requirement of a \u201cbusiness ground\u201d shadows\nthe Court\u2019s requirement of a \u201csufficiently strong\u201d justifica-\ntion, and, like it, has no footing in the terms of the same-\ntreatment clause. As the concurrence understands the\nwords \u201cshall be treated the same,\u201d an employer must give\npregnant workers the same accommodations (not merely\naccommodations on the same terms) as other workers\n\u201cwho are similar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d\nAnte, at 3\u20134. But the concurrence realizes that requiring\nthe same accommodations to all who are similar in ability\nor inability to work\u2014the only characteristic mentioned in\nthe same-treatment clause\u2014would \u201clead to wildly implau-\nsible results.\u201d Ante, at 6, n. 3. To solve this problem, the\nconcurrence broadens the category of characteristics that\nthe employer may take into account. It allows an em-\nployer to find dissimilarity on the basis of traits other than\nability to work so long as there is a \u201cneutral business\nreason\u201d for considering them\u2014though it immediately adds\nthat cost and inconvenience are not good enough reasons.\nAnte, at 7.

UNITED PARCEL \n\n                SERVICE, INC. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                       [March 25, 2015]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY, dissenting.\n   It seems to me proper, in joining JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\ndissent, to add these additional remarks. The dissent is\naltogether correct to point out that petitioner here cannot\npoint to a class of her co-workers that was accommodated\nand that would include her but for the particular limita-\ntions imposed by her pregnancy. Many other workers\nwith health-related restrictions were not accommodated\neither. And, in addition, there is no showing here of ani-\nmus or hostility to pregnant women.\n   But as a matter of societal concern, indifference is quite\nanother matter. There must be little doubt that women\nwho are in the work force\u2014by choice, by financial necessity,\nor both\u2014confront a serious disadvantage after becom-\ning pregnant. They may find it difficult to continue to\nwork, at least in their regular assignment, while still\ntaking necessary steps to avoid risks to their health and\nthe health of their future children. This is why the diffi-\nculties pregnant women face in the workplace are and do\nremain an issue of national importance.\n   \u201cHistorically, denial or curtailment of women\u2019s employ-\nment opportunities has been traceable directly to the\npervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and\nworkers second.\u201d Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v.\nHibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 736 (2003) (quoting The Parental\n2         YOUNG v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nand Medical Leave Act of 1986: Joint Hearing before the\nSubcommittee on Labor\u2013Management Relations and the\nSubcommittee on Labor Standards of the House Commit-\ntee on Education and Labor, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 100\n(1986)). Such \u201cattitudes about pregnancy and childbirth\n. . . have sustained pervasive, often law-sanctioned, re-\nstrictions on a woman\u2019s place among paid workers.\u201d\nAT&T Corp. v. Hulteen, 556 U. S. 701, 724 (2009)\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). Although much progress has\nbeen made in recent decades and many employers have\nvoluntarily adopted policies designed to recruit, accommo-\ndate, and retain employees who are pregnant or have\nyoung children, see Brief for U. S. Women\u2019s Chamber of\nCommerce et al. as Amici Curiae 10\u201314, pregnant employ-\nees continue to be disadvantaged\u2014and often discriminated\nagainst\u2014in the workplace, see Brief of Law Professors\net al. as Amici Curiae 37\u201338.\n    Recognizing the financial and dignitary harm caused by\nthese conditions, Congress and the States have enacted\nlaws to combat or alleviate, at least to some extent, the\ndifficulties faced by pregnant women in the work force.\nMost relevant here, Congress enacted the Pregnancy\nDiscrimination Act (PDA), 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e(k), which\ndefines discrimination on the basis of pregnancy as sex\ndiscrimination for purposes of Title VII and clarifies that\npregnant employees \u201cshall be treated the same\u201d as non-\npregnant employees who are \u201csimilar in their ability or\ninability to work.\u201d The PDA forbids not only disparate\ntreatment but also disparate impact, the latter of which\nprohibits \u201cpractices that are not intended to discriminate\nbut in fact have a disproportionate adverse effect.\u201d Ricci\nv. DeStefano, 557 U. S. 557, 577 (2009). Congress further\nenacted the parental-leave provision of the Family and\nMedical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U. S. C. \u00a72612(a)(1)(A),\nwhich requires certain employers to provide eligible em-\nployees with 12 workweeks of leave because of the birth of\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\na child. And after the events giving rise to this litigation,\nCongress passed the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, 122\nStat. 3553, which expands protections for employees with\ntemporary disabilities. As the parties note, Brief for Peti-\ntioner 37\u201343; Brief for Respondent 21\u201322; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 24\u201325, these amendments and\ntheir implementing regulations, 29 CFR \u00a71630 (2015),\nmay require accommodations for many pregnant employ-\nees, even though pregnancy itself is not expressly classi-\nfied as a disability. Additionally, many States have en-\nacted laws providing certain accommodations for pregnant\nemployees. See, e.g., Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a712945 (West\n2011); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a723:342(4) (West 2010); W. Va.\nCode Ann. \u00a75\u201311B\u20132 (Lexis Supp. 2014); see also Califor-\nnia Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272 (1987)\n(holding that the PDA does not pre-empt such statutes).\nThese Acts honor and safeguard the important contribu-\ntions women make to both the workplace and the Ameri-\ncan family.\n   Today the Court addresses only one of these legal pro-\ntections: the PDA\u2019s prohibition of disparate treatment.\nFor the reasons well stated in JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s dissenting\nopinion, the Court interprets the PDA in a manner that\nrisks \u201cconflation of disparate impact with disparate treat-\nment\u201d by permitting a plaintiff to use a policy\u2019s dispropor-\ntionate burden on pregnant employees as evidence of\npretext. Ante, at 8; see ante, at 21\u201322 (opinion of the\nCourt). In so doing, the Court injects unnecessary confu-\nsion into the accepted burden-shifting framework estab-\nlished in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792\n(1973).\n   With these remarks, I join JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s dissent.\n</pre>",
