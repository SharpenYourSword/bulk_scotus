Argued January 20, 2015\u2014Decided March 31, 2015\nProviders of \u201chabilitation services\u201d under Idaho\u2019s Medicaid plan are\n  reimbursed by the State\u2019s Department of Health and Welfare. Sec-\n  tion 30(A) of the Medicaid Act requires Idaho\u2019s plan to \u201cassure that\n  payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of\n  care\u201d while \u201csafeguard[ing] against unnecessary utilization of . . .\n  care and services.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A). Respondents, pro-\n  viders of habilitation services, sued petitioners, Idaho Health and\n  Welfare Department officials, claiming that Idaho reimbursed them\n  at rates lower than \u00a730(A) permits, and seeking to enjoin petitioners\n  to increase these rates. The District Court entered summary judg-\n  ment for the providers. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that\n  the Supremacy Clause gave the providers an implied right of action,\n  and that they could sue under this implied right of action to seek an\n  injunction requiring Idaho to comply with \u00a730(a).\nHeld: The judgment is reversed.\n567 Fed. Appx. 496, reversed.\n     JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part\n  IV, concluding that the Supremacy Clause does not confer a private\n  right of action, and that Medicaid providers cannot sue for an injunc-\n  tion requiring compliance with \u00a730(a). Pp. 3\u201310.\n     (a) The Supremacy Clause instructs courts to give federal law pri-\n  ority when state and federal law clash. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat.\n  1, 210. But it is not the \u201c \u2018source of any federal rights,\u2019 \u201d Golden State\n  Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 107, and certainly does\n  not create a cause of action. Nothing in the Clause\u2019s text suggests\n  otherwise, and nothing suggests it was ever understood as conferring\n2        ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    a private right of action. Article I vests Congress with broad discre-\n    tion over the manner of implementing its enumerated powers. Art I.,\n    \u00a78; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421. It is unlikely that the\n    Constitution gave Congress broad discretion with regard to the en-\n    actment of laws, while simultaneously limiting Congress\u2019s power over\n    the manner of their implementation, making it impossible to leave\n    the enforcement of federal law to federal actors. Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) Reading the Supremacy Clause not to confer a private right of\n    action is consistent with this Court\u2019s preemption jurisprudence. The\n    ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal\n    officers is the creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history\n    of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England.\n    This Court has never held nor suggested that this judge-made reme-\n    dy, in its application to state officers, rests upon an implied right of\n    action contained in the Supremacy Clause. Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (c) Respondents\u2019 suit cannot proceed in equity. The power of feder-\n    al courts of equity to enjoin unlawful executive action is subject to\n    express and implied statutory limitations. See, e.g., Seminole Tribe\n    of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 74. Here, the express provision of a\n    single remedy for a State\u2019s failure to comply with Medicaid\u2019s re-\n    quirements\u2014the withholding of Medicaid funds by the Secretary of\n    Health and Human Services, 42 U.

S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A)).\n                             I\n  Medicaid is a federal program that subsidizes the\nStates\u2019 provision of medical services to \u201cfamilies with\ndependent children and of aged, blind, or disabled individ-\nuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet\nthe costs of necessary medical services.\u201d \u00a71396\u20131. Like\nother Spending Clause legislation, Medicaid offers the\nStates a bargain: Congress provides federal funds in ex-\nchange for the States\u2019 agreement to spend them in accord-\nance with congressionally imposed conditions.\n  In order to qualify for Medicaid funding, the State of\nIdaho adopted, and the Federal Government approved, a\nMedicaid \u201cplan,\u201d \u00a71396a(a), which Idaho administers\nthrough its Department of Health and Welfare. Idaho\u2019s\nplan includes \u201chabilitation services\u201d\u2014in-home care for\nindividuals who, \u201cbut for the provision of such services . . .\n2    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould require the level of care provided in a hospital or a\nnursing facility or intermediate care facility for the men-\ntally retarded the cost of which could be reimbursed under\nthe State plan,\u201d \u00a71396n(c) and (c)(1). Providers of these\nservices are reimbursed by the Department of Health and\nWelfare.\n  Section 30(A) of the Medicaid Act requires Idaho\u2019s plan\nto:\n    \u201cprovide such methods and procedures relating to the\n    utilization of, and the payment for, care and services\n    available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to\n    safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care\n    and services and to assure that payments are con-\n    sistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care\n    and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that\n    care and services are available under the plan at least\n    to the extent that such care and services are available\n    to the general population in the geographic area . . . .\u201d\n    42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A).\nRespondents are providers of habilitation services to\npersons covered by Idaho\u2019s Medicaid plan. They sued\npetitioners\u2014two officials in Idaho\u2019s Department of Health\nand Welfare\u2014in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Idaho, claiming that Idaho violates \u00a730(A) by\nreimbursing providers of habilitation services at rates\nlower than \u00a730(A) permits. They asked the court to enjoin\npetitioners to increase these rates.\n  The District Court entered summary judgment for the\nproviders, holding that Idaho had not set rates in a man-\nner consistent with \u00a730(A). Inclusion, Inc. v. Armstrong,\n835 F. Supp. 2d 960 (2011). The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\n567 Fed. Appx. 496 (2014). It said that the providers had\n\u201can implied right of action under the Supremacy Clause to\nseek injunctive relief against the enforcement or imple-\nmentation of state legislation.\u201d Id., at 497 (citing Inde-\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

S. ___ (2014).\n                          II\n  The Supremacy Clause, Art. VI, cl. 2, reads:\n      \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United\n    States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and\n    all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the\n    Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme\n    Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall\n    be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or\n    Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d\nIt is apparent that this Clause creates a rule of decision:\nCourts \u201cshall\u201d regard the \u201cConstitution,\u201d and all laws\n\u201cmade in Pursuance thereof,\u201d as \u201cthe supreme Law of the\nLand.\u201d They must not give effect to state laws that con-\nflict with federal laws. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210\n(1824). It is equally apparent that the Supremacy Clause\nis not the \u201c \u2018source of any federal rights,\u2019 \u201d Golden State\nTransit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 107 (1989)\n(quoting Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organiza-\ntion, 441 U. S. 600, 613 (1979)), and certainly does not\ncreate a cause of action. It instructs courts what to do\nwhen state and federal law clash, but is silent regarding\nwho may enforce federal laws in court, and in what cir-\ncumstances they may do so.\n   Hamilton wrote that the Supremacy Clause \u201conly de-\nclares a truth, which flows immediately and necessarily\nfrom the institution of a Federal Government.\u201d The Fed-\neralist No. 33, p. 207 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). And Story de-\nscribed the Clause as \u201ca positive affirmance of that, which\nis necessarily implied.\u201d 3 Commentaries on the Constitu-\ntion of the United States \u00a71831, p. 693 (1833). These\ndescriptions would have been grossly inapt if the Clause\n4    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwere understood to give affected parties a constitutional\n(and hence congressionally unalterable) right to enforce\nfederal laws against the States. And had it been under-\nstood to provide such significant private rights against the\nStates, one would expect to find that mentioned in the\npreratification historical record, which contained ample\ndiscussion of the Supremacy Clause by both supporters\nand opponents of ratification. See C. Drahozal, The Su-\npremacy Clause: A Reference Guide to the United States\nConstitution 25 (2004); The Federalist No. 44, at 306 (J.\nMadison). We are aware of no such mention, and re-\nspondents have not provided any. Its conspicuous absence\nmilitates strongly against their position.\n  Additionally, it is important to read the Supremacy\nClause in the context of the Constitution as a whole.\nArticle I vests Congress with broad discretion over the\nmanner of implementing its enumerated powers, giving it\nauthority to \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and\nproper for carrying [them] into Execution.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78. We\nhave said that this confers upon the Legislature \u201cthat\ndiscretion, with respect to the means by which the powers\n[the Constitution] confers are to be carried into execution,\nwhich will enable that body to perform the high duties\nassigned to it,\u201d McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421\n(1819). It is unlikely that the Constitution gave Congress\nsuch broad discretion with regard to the enactment of\nlaws, while simultaneously limiting Congress\u2019s power over\nthe manner of their implementation, making it impossible\nto leave the enforcement of federal law to federal actors. If\nthe Supremacy Clause includes a private right of action,\nthen the Constitution requires Congress to permit the\nenforcement of its laws by private actors, significantly\ncurtailing its ability to guide the implementation of fed-\neral law. It would be strange indeed to give a clause that\nmakes federal law supreme a reading that limits Con-\ngress\u2019s power to enforce that law, by imposing mandatory\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprivate enforcement\u2014a limitation unheard-of with regard\nto state legislatures.\n  To say that the Supremacy Clause does not confer a\nright of action is not to diminish the significant role that\ncourts play in assuring the supremacy of federal law. For\nonce a case or controversy properly comes before a court,\njudges are bound by federal law. Thus, a court may not\nconvict a criminal defendant of violating a state law that\nfederal law prohibits. See, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Nelson,\n350 U. S. 497, 499, 509 (1956). Similarly, a court may not\nhold a civil defendant liable under state law for conduct\nfederal law requires. See, e.g., Mutual Pharmaceutical Co.\nv. Bartlett, 570 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2013) (slip op., at 13\u2013\n14). And, as we have long recognized, if an individual\nclaims federal law immunizes him from state regulation,\nthe court may issue an injunction upon finding the state\nregulatory actions preempted. Ex parte Young, 209 U. S.\n123, 155\u2013156 (1908).\n  Respondents contend that our preemption jurispru-\ndence\u2014specifically, the fact that we have regularly con-\nsidered whether to enjoin the enforcement of state laws\nthat are alleged to violate federal law\u2014demonstrates that\nthe Supremacy Clause creates a cause of action for its\nviolation. They are incorrect. It is true enough that we\nhave long held that federal courts may in some circum-\nstances grant injunctive relief against state officers who\nare violating, or planning to violate, federal law. See, e.g.,\nOsborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 838\u2013839,\n844 (1824); Ex parte Young, supra, at 150\u2013151 (citing\nDavis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 220 (1873)). But that has\nbeen true not only with respect to violations of federal law\nby state officials, but also with respect to violations of\nfederal law by federal officials. See American School of\nMagnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U. S. 94, 110 (1902);\nsee generally L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative\nAction 152\u2013196 (1965). Thus, the Supremacy Clause need\n6     ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot be (and in light of our textual analysis above, cannot\nbe) the explanation. What our cases demonstrate is that,\n\u201cin a proper case, relief may be given in a court of equity\n. . . to prevent an injurious act by a public officer.\u201d Carroll\nv. Safford, 3 How. 441, 463 (1845).\n    The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by\nstate and federal officers is the creation of courts of equity,\nand reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal\nexecutive action, tracing back to England. See Jaffe &\nHenderson, Judicial Review and the Rule of Law: Histori-\ncal Origins, 72 L. Q. Rev. 345 (1956). It is a judge-made\nremedy, and we have never held or even suggested that, in\nits application to state officers, it rests upon an implied\nright of action contained in the Supremacy Clause. That\nis because, as even the dissent implicitly acknowledges,\npost, at 4 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) it does not. The\nNinth Circuit erred in holding otherwise.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  We turn next to respondents\u2019 contention that, quite\napart from any cause of action conferred by the Supre-\nmacy Clause, this suit can proceed against Idaho in equity.\n  The power of federal courts of equity to enjoin unlawful\nexecutive action is subject to express and implied statu-\ntory limitations. See, e.g., Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Flor-\nida, 517 U. S. 44, 74 (1996). \u201c \u2018Courts of equity can no more\ndisregard statutory and constitutional requirements and\nprovisions than can courts of law.\u2019 \u201d INS v. Pangilinan,\n486 U. S. 875, 883 (1988) (quoting Hedges v. Dixon\nCounty, 150 U. S. 182, 192 (1893); brackets omitted). In\nour view the Medicaid Act implicitly precludes private\nenforcement of \u00a730(A), and respondents cannot, by invok-\ning our equitable powers, circumvent Congress\u2019s exclusion\nof private enforcement.

J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4\u20135).\n   Two aspects of \u00a730(A) establish Congress\u2019s \u201cintent to\nforeclose\u201d equitable relief. Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv.\nComm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 647 (2002). First, the sole\nremedy Congress provided for a State\u2019s failure to comply\nwith Medicaid\u2019s requirements\u2014for the State\u2019s \u201cbreach\u201d of\nthe Spending Clause contract\u2014is the withholding of Medi-\ncaid funds by the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-\nvices. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396c. As we have elsewhere ex-\nplained, the \u201cexpress provision of one method of enforcing\na substantive rule suggests that Congress intended to\npreclude others.\u201d Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275,\n290 (2001).\n   The provision for the Secretary\u2019s enforcement by with-\nholding funds might not, by itself, preclude the availability\nof equitable relief. See Virginia Office for Protection and\nAdvocacy v. Stewart, 563 U. S. 247, ___\u2013___, n. 3 (2011)\n(slip op., at 7\u20138, n. 3). But it does so when combined with\nthe judicially unadministrable nature of \u00a730(A)\u2019s text. It\nis difficult to imagine a requirement broader and less\nspecific than \u00a730(A)\u2019s mandate that state plans provide for\npayments that are \u201cconsistent with efficiency, economy,\nand quality of care,\u201d all the while \u201csafeguard[ing] against\nunnecessary utilization of . . . care and services.\u201d Explicitly\nconferring enforcement of this judgment-laden standard\nupon the Secretary alone establishes, we think, that Con-\ngress \u201cwanted to make the agency remedy that it provided\nexclusive,\u201d thereby achieving \u201cthe expertise, uniformity,\nwidespread consultation, and resulting administrative\nguidance that can accompany agency decisionmaking,\u201d\nand avoiding \u201cthe comparative risk of inconsistent inter-\npretations and misincentives that can arise out of an\noccasional inappropriate application of the statute in a\nprivate action.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 292\n(2002) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). The sheer\ncomplexity associated with enforcing \u00a730(A), coupled with\n8    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe express provision of an administrative remedy, \u00a71396c,\nshows that the Medicaid Act precludes private enforce-\nment of \u00a730(A) in the courts.\n                               B\n   The dissent agrees with us that the Supremacy Clause\ndoes not provide an implied right of action, and that Con-\ngress may displace the equitable relief that is traditionally\navailable to enforce federal law. It disagrees only with our\nconclusion that such displacement has occurred here.\n   The dissent insists that, \u201cbecause Congress is undoubt-\nedly aware of the federal courts\u2019 long-established practice\nof enjoining preempted state action, it should generally be\npresumed to contemplate such enforcement unless it\naffirmatively manifests a contrary intent.\u201d Post, at 4\n(emphasis added). But a \u201clong-established practice\u201d does\nnot justify a rule that denies statutory text its fairest\nreading. Section 30(A), fairly read in the context of the\nMedicaid Act, \u201cdisplay[s] a[n] intent to foreclose\u201d the\navailability of equitable relief. Verizon, supra, at 647. We\nhave no warrant to revise Congress\u2019s scheme simply be-\ncause it did not \u201caffirmatively\u201d preclude the availability of\na judge-made action at equity. See Seminole Tribe, supra,\nat 75 (inferring, in the absence of an \u201caffirmative\u201d state-\nment by Congress, that equitable relief was unavailable).\n   Equally unavailing is the dissent\u2019s reliance on \u00a730(A)\u2019s\nhistory. Section 30(A) was amended, on December 19,\n1989, to include what the dissent calls the \u201cequal access\nmandate,\u201d post, at 9\u2014the requirement that reimburse-\nment rates be \u201csufficient to enlist enough providers so that\ncare and services are available under the plan at least to\nthe extent that such care and services are available to the\ngeneral population in the geographic area.\u201d \u00a76402(a), 103\nStat. 2260. There existed at the time another provision,\nknown as the \u201cBoren Amendment,\u201d that likewise imposed\nbroad requirements on state Medicaid plans. 42 U. S. C.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71396a(a)(13)(A) (1982 ed., Supp. V). Lower courts had\ninterpreted the Boren Amendment to be privately enforce-\nable under \u00a71983. From this, the dissent infers that, when\nCongress amended \u00a730(A), it could not \u201chave failed to\nanticipate\u201d that \u00a730(A)\u2019s broad language\u2014or at least that\nof the equal access mandate\u2014would be interpreted as\nenforceable in a private action. Thus, concludes the dis-\nsent, Congress\u2019s failure to expressly preclude the private\nenforcement of \u00a730(A) suggests it intended not to preclude\nprivate enforcement. Post, at 10.\n   This argument appears to rely on the prior-construction\ncanon; the rule that, when \u201cjudicial interpretations have\nsettled the meaning of an existing statutory provision,\nrepetition of the same language in a new statute\u201d is pre-\nsumed to incorporate that interpretation. Bragdon v.\nAbbott, 524 U. S. 624, 645 (1998). But that canon has no\napplication here. The language of the two provisions is\nnowhere near identical; and even if it had been, the ques-\ntion whether the Boren Amendment permitted private\nactions was far from \u201csettled.\u201d When Congress amended\n\u00a730(A) in 1989, this Court had already granted certiorari\nto decide, but had not yet decided, whether the Boren\nAmendment could be enforced through a \u00a71983 suit. See\nBaliles v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 493 U. S. 808 (Oct. 2,\n1989) (granting certiorari). Our decision permitting a\n\u00a71983 action did not issue until June 14, 1990\u2014almost six\nmonths after the amendment to \u00a730(A). Wilder v. Virginia\nHospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498.* The existence of a granted\npetition for certiorari demonstrates quite clearly that the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Respondents do not claim that Wilder establishes precedent for a\nprivate cause of action in this case. They do not assert a \u00a71983 action,\nsince our later opinions plainly repudiate the ready implication of a\n\u00a71983 action that Wilder exemplified. See Gonzaga, Univ. v. Due, 536\nU. S. 273, 283 (2002) (expressly \u201creject[ing] the notion,\u201d implicit in\nWilder, \u201cthat our cases permit anything short of an unambiguously\nconferred right to support a cause of action brought under \u00a71983\u201d).\n10   ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                                the\n                     Opinion of S   Court\n                                 CALIA, J.\n\nquestion whether the Boren Amendment could be pri-\nvately enforced was unsettled at the time of \u00a730(A)\u2019s 1989\namendment\u2014so that if Congress was aware of the parallel\n(which is highly doubtful) the course that awareness\nwould have prompted (if any) would not have been legisla-\ntive silence but rather express specification of the availa-\nbility of private enforcement (if that was what Congress\nintended).\n   Finally, the dissent speaks as though we leave these\nplaintiffs with no resort. That is not the case. Their relief\nmust be sought initially through the Secretary rather than\nthrough the courts. The dissent\u2019s complaint that the\nsanction available to the Secretary (the cut-off of funding)\nis too massive to be a realistic source of relief seems to us\nmistaken. We doubt that the Secretary\u2019s notice to a\nState that its compensation scheme is inadequate will be\nignored.\n                             IV\n   The last possible source of a cause of action for respond-\nents is the Medicaid Act itself. They do not claim that,\nand rightly so. Section 30(A) lacks the sort of rights-\ncreating language needed to imply a private right of ac-\ntion. Sandoval, supra at 286\u2013287. It is phrased as a\ndirective to the federal agency charged with approving\nstate Medicaid plans, not as a conferral of the right to sue\nupon the beneficiaries of the State\u2019s decision to participate\nin Medicaid. The Act says that the \u201cSecretary shall ap-\nprove any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in\nsubsection (a),\u201d the subsection that includes \u00a730(A). 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71396a(b).

Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). The notion\nthat respondents have a right to sue derives, perhaps,\nfrom the fact that they are beneficiaries of the federal-\nstate Medicaid agreement, and that intended beneficiar-\nies, in modern times at least, can sue to enforce the obli-\ngations of private contracting parties. See 13 R. Lord,\nWilliston on Contracts \u00a7\u00a737:12\u201337.13, pp. 123\u2013135 (4th ed.\n2013). We doubt, to begin with, that providers are intended\nbeneficiaries (as opposed to mere incidental beneficiar-\nies) of the Medicaid agreement, which was concluded for\nthe benefit of the infirm whom the providers were to serve,\nrather than for the benefit of the providers themselves.\nSee Pharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of America v.\nWalsh, 538 U. S. 644, 683 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring\nin judgment). More fundamentally, however, the modern\njurisprudence permitting intended beneficiaries to sue\ndoes not generally apply to contracts between a private\nparty and the government, Astra USA, Inc. v.

I believe the answer to this\nquestion is no.\n   That answer does not follow from the application of a\nsimple, fixed legal formula separating federal statutes\nthat may underlie this kind of injunctive action from those\nthat may not. \u201c[T]he statute books are too many, the laws\ntoo diverse, and their purposes too complex, for any single\nlegal formula to offer\u201d courts \u201cmore than general guid-\nance.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 291 (2012)\n(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). Rather, I believe\nthat several characteristics of the federal statute before\nus, when taken together, make clear that Congress in-\ntended to foreclose respondents from bringing this particu-\nlar action for injunctive relief.\n   For one thing, as the majority points out, \u00a730(A) of the\nMedicaid Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A), sets forth a\n2    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nfederal mandate that is broad and nonspecific. See ante,\nat 7. But, more than that, \u00a730(A) applies its broad stand-\nards to the setting of rates. The history of ratemaking\ndemonstrates that administrative agencies are far better\nsuited to this task than judges. More than a century ago,\nCongress created the Interstate Commerce Commission,\nthe first great federal regulatory rate-setting agency, and\nendowed it with authority to set \u201creasonable\u201d railroad\nrates. Ch. 104, 24 Stat. 379 (1887). It did so in part be-\ncause judicial efforts to maintain reasonable rate levels\nhad proved inadequate. See I. Sharfman, Railway Regula-\ntion: An Analysis of the Underlying Problems in Railway\nEconomics from the Standpoint of Government Regulation\n43\u201344 (1915).\n   Reading \u00a730(A) underscores the complexity and nonju-\ndicial nature of the rate-setting task. That provision\nrequires State Medicaid plans to \u201cassure that payments\nare consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care\nand are sufficient to enlist enough providers\u201d to assure\n\u201ccare and services\u201d equivalent to that \u201cavailable to the\ngeneral population in the geographic area.\u201d \u00a71396a(a)\n(30)(A). The methods that a state agency, such as Idaho\u2019s\nDepartment of Health and Welfare, uses to make this kind\nof determination may involve subsidiary determinations\nof, for example, the actual cost of providing quality ser-\nvices, including personnel and total operating expenses;\nchanges in public expectations with respect to delivery of\nservices; inflation; a comparison of rates paid in neighbor-\ning States for comparable services; and a comparison of\nany rates paid for comparable services in other public or\nprivate capacities. See App. to Reply to Brief in Opposi-\ntion 16; Idaho Code Ann. \u00a756\u2013118 (2012).\n   At the same time, \u00a730(A) applies broadly, covering\nreimbursements provided to approximately 1.36 million\ndoctors, serving over 69 million patients across the Nation.\nSee Dept. of Health and Human Servs., Office of Inspector\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

And States engage in\ntime-consuming efforts to obtain public input on proposed\nplan amendments. See, e.g., Kansas Medicaid: Design and\nImplementation of a Public Input and Stakeholder Con-\nsult Process (Sept. 16, 2011) (prepared by Deloitte Con-\nsulting, LLP) (describing public input on Kansas\u2019 proposed\nMedicaid amendments).\n   I recognize that federal courts have long become accus-\ntomed to reviewing for reasonableness or constitutionality\nthe rate-setting determinations made by agencies. See 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7706; FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591,\n602\u2013606 (1944). But this is not such an action. Instead,\nthe lower courts here, relying on the rate-setting standard\narticulated in Orthopaedic Hospital v. Belshe, 103 F. 3d\n1491 (CA9 1997), required the State to set rates that\n\u201capproximate the cost of quality care provided efficiently\nand economically.\u201d Id., at 1496. See Inclusion, Inc. v.\nArmstrong, 835 F. Supp. 2d 960, 963\u2013964 (Idaho 2011),\naff\u2019d, 567 Fed. Appx. 496 (CA9 2014). To find in the law a\nbasis for courts to engage in such direct rate-setting could\nset a precedent for allowing other similar actions, poten-\ntially resulting in rates set by federal judges (of whom\nthere are several hundred) outside the ordinary channel of\nfederal judicial review of agency decisionmaking. The\nconsequence, I fear, would be increased litigation, incon-\nsistent results, and disorderly administration of highly\ncomplex federal programs that demand public consulta-\ntion, administrative guidance and coherence for their\nsuccess. I do not believe Congress intended to allow a\nstatute-based injunctive action that poses such risks (and\nthat has the other features I mention).\n   I recognize that courts might in particular instances be\nable to resolve rate-related requests for injunctive relief\nquite easily. But I see no easy way to separate in advance\nthe potentially simple sheep from the more harmful rate-\n4     ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nmaking goats. In any event, this case, I fear, belongs in\nthe latter category. See Belshe, supra, at 1496. Compare\nBrief for Respondents 2, n. 1 (claiming that respondents\nseek only to enforce federally approved methodology), with\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5, n. 2 (the rele-\nvant methodology has not been approved). See also Idaho\nCode Ann. \u00a756\u2013118 (describing in general terms what\nappears to be a complex rate-setting methodology, while\nleaving unclear the extent to which Idaho is bound to use,\nrather than merely consider, actual provider costs).\n  For another thing, like the majority, I would ask why, in\nthe complex rate-setting area, other forms of relief are\ninadequate. If the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-\nvices concludes that a State is failing to follow legally\nrequired federal rules, the Secretary can withhold federal\nfunds. See ante, at 7 (citing 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396c). If with-\nholding funds does not work, the federal agency may be\nable to sue a State to compel compliance with federal\nrules. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 52 (Solicitor General and\nrespondents acknowledging that the Federal Government\nmight be able to sue a State to enjoin it from paying less\nthan what \u00a730(A) requires). Cf., e.g., Arizona v. United\nStates, 567 U. S. __ (2012) (allowing similar action in\nanother context).\n   Moreover, why could respondents not ask the federal\nagency to interpret its rules to respondents\u2019 satisfaction, to\nmodify those rules, to promulgate new rules or to enforce\nold ones? See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7553(e). Normally, when such\nrequests are denied, an injured party can seek judicial\nreview of the agency\u2019s refusal on the grounds that it is\n\u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\nnot in accordance with law.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7702, 706(2)(A). And an\ninjured party can ask the court to \u201ccompel agency action\nunlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7702,\n706(1).

See Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 527 (2007). As a result, it may\nbe difficult for respondents to prevail on an APA claim\nunless it stems from an agency\u2019s particularly egregious\nfailure to act. But, if that is so, it is because Congress\ndecided to vest broad discretion in the agency to interpret\nand to enforce \u00a730(A).

To the contrary,\nthis Court has adjudicated such requests for equitable\nrelief since the early days of the Republic. Nevertheless,\ntoday the Court holds that Congress has foreclosed private\nparties from invoking the equitable powers of the federal\ncourts to require States to comply with \u00a730(A) of the Medi-\ncaid Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A). It does so without\npointing to the sort of detailed remedial scheme we have\npreviously deemed necessary to establish congressional\nintent to preclude resort to equity. Instead, the Court\nrelies on Congress\u2019 provision for agency enforcement of\n\u00a730(A)\u2014an enforcement mechanism of the sort we have\nalready definitively determined not to foreclose private\nactions\u2014and on the mere fact that \u00a730(A) contains rela-\ntively broad language. As I cannot agree that these statu-\ntory provisions demonstrate the requisite congressional\nintent to restrict the equitable authority of the federal\ncourts, I respectfully dissent.\n2    ARMSTRONG v.

Perhaps the most famous exposition of this\nprinciple is our decision in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123\n(1908), from which the doctrine derives its usual name.\nThere, we held that the shareholders of a railroad could\nseek an injunction preventing the Minnesota attorney\ngeneral from enforcing a state law setting maximum\nrailroad rates because the Eleventh Amendment did not\nprovide the officials with immunity from such an action\nand the federal court had the \u201cpower\u201d in equity to \u201cgrant a\ntemporary injunction.\u201d Id., at 148. This Court had earlier\nrecognized similar equitable authority in Osborn v. Bank\nof United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), in which a federal\ncourt issued an injunction prohibiting an Ohio official from\nexecuting a state law taxing the Bank of the United\nStates. Id., at 838\u2013839. We affirmed in relevant part,\nconcluding that the case was \u201ccognizable in a Court of\nequity,\u201d and holding it to be \u201cproper\u201d to grant equitable\nrelief insofar as the state tax was \u201crepugnant\u201d to the\nfederal law creating the national bank. Id., at 839, 859.\nMore recently, we confirmed the vitality of this doctrine in\nFree Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting\nOversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477 (2010).

A claim that a state law contravenes a federal\nstatute is \u201cbasically constitutional in nature, deriving its\nforce from the operation of the Supremacy Clause,\u201d Doug-\nlas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265, 271\u2013272\n(1977), and the application of preempted state law is\ntherefore \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d Crosby v. National Foreign\nTrade Council, 530 U.

We have thus long entertained\nsuits in which a party seeks prospective equitable protec-\ntion from an injurious and preempted state law without\nregard to whether the federal statute at issue itself pro-\nvided a right to bring an action.

Indeed, for this reason, we have\ncharacterized \u201cthe availability of prospective relief of the\nsort awarded in Ex parte Young\u201d as giving \u201clife to the\nSupremacy Clause.\u201d Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68\n4     ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n(1985).\n  Thus, even though the Court is correct that it is some-\nwhat misleading to speak of \u201can implied right of action\ncontained in the Supremacy Clause,\u201d ante, at 6, that does\nnot mean that parties may not enforce the Supremacy\nClause by bringing suit to enjoin preempted state action.\nAs the Court also recognizes, we \u201chave long held that\nfederal courts may in some circumstances grant injunctive\nrelief against state officers who are violating, or planning\nto violate, federal law.\u201d Ante, at 5.\n                              B\n  Most important for purposes of this case is not the mere\nexistence of this equitable authority, but the fact that it is\nexceedingly well established\u2014supported, as the Court\nputs it, by a \u201clong history.\u201d Ante, at 6. Congress may, if it\nso chooses, either expressly or implicitly preclude Ex parte\nYoung enforcement actions with respect to a particular\nstatute or category of lawsuit. See, e.g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a71341\n(prohibiting federal judicial restraints on the collection of\nstate taxes); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S.\n44, 75\u201376 (1996) (comprehensive alternative remedial\nscheme can establish Congress\u2019 intent to foreclose Ex parte\nYoung actions). But because Congress is undoubtedly\naware of the federal courts\u2019 long-established practice of\nenjoining preempted state action, it should generally be\npresumed to contemplate such enforcement unless it\naffirmatively manifests a contrary intent. \u201cUnless a stat-\nute in so many words, or by a necessary and inescapable\ninference, restricts the court\u2019s jurisdiction in equity, the\nfull scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and ap-\nplied.\u201d Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U. S. 395, 398\n(1946).\n  In this respect, equitable preemption actions differ from\nsuits brought by plaintiffs invoking 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 or an\nimplied right of action to enforce a federal statute. Suits\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Stanley, 483\nU. S. 669, 683 (1987). By contrast, a plaintiff invoking\n\u00a71983 or an implied statutory cause of action may seek a\nvariety of remedies\u2014including damages\u2014from a poten-\ntially broad range of parties. Rather than simply pointing\nto background equitable principles authorizing the action\nthat Congress presumably has not overridden, such a\nplaintiff must demonstrate specific congressional intent to\ncreate a statutory right to these remedies. See Gonzaga\nUniv. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 290 (2002); Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286 (2001); see also Golden State\nTransit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 114 (1989)\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (Because a preemption claim\ndoes not seek to enforce a statutory right, \u201c[t]he injured\nparty does not need \u00a71983 to vest in him a right to assert\nthat an attempted exercise of jurisdiction or control vio-\nlates the proper distribution of powers within the federal\nsystem\u201d). For these reasons, the principles that we have\ndeveloped to determine whether a statute creates an\nimplied right of action, or is enforceable through \u00a71983,\nare not transferable to the Ex parte Young context.\n                                II\n  In concluding that Congress has \u201cimplicitly preclude[d]\nprivate enforcement of \u00a730(A),\u201d ante, at 6, the Court ig-\nnores this critical distinction and threatens the vitality of\nour Ex parte Young jurisprudence. The Court identifies\nonly a single prior decision\u2014Seminole Tribe\u2014in which we\nhave ever discerned such congressional intent to foreclose\nequitable enforcement of a statutory mandate. Ante, at 6.\nEven the most cursory review of that decision reveals how\nfar afield it is from this case.\n  In Seminole Tribe, the plaintiff Indian Tribe had in-\nvoked Ex parte Young in seeking to compel the State of\n6    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nFlorida to \u201cnegotiate in good faith with [the] tribe toward\nthe formation of a compact\u201d governing certain gaming\nactivities, as required by a provision of the Indian Gaming\nRegulatory Act, 25 U. S. C. \u00a72710(d)(3). 517 U. S., at 47.\nWe rejected this effort, observing that \u201cCongress passed\n\u00a72710(d)(3) in conjunction with the carefully crafted and\nintricate remedial scheme set forth in \u00a72710(d)(7).\u201d Id., at\n73\u201374. That latter provision allowed a tribe to sue for\nviolations of the duty to negotiate 180 days after request-\ning such negotiations, but specifically limited the remedy\nthat a court could grant to \u201can order directing the State\nand the Indian tribe to conclude a compact within 60\ndays,\u201d and provided that the only sanction for the violation\nof such an order would be to require the parties to \u201csub-\nmit a proposed compact to a mediator.\u201d Id., at 74;\n\u00a7\u00a72710(d)(7)(B)(i), (iii), (iv). The statute further directed\nthat if the State should fail to abide by the mediator\u2019s\nselected compact, the sole remedy would be for the Secre-\ntary of the Interior, in consultation with the tribe, to\nprescribe regulations governing gaming. See 517 U. S., at\n74\u201375; \u00a72710(d)(7)(B)(vii). We concluded that Congress\nmust have intended this procedural route to be the exclu-\nsive means of enforcing \u00a72710(d)(3). As we explained: \u201cIf\n\u00a72710(d)(3) could be enforced in a suit under Ex parte\nYoung, \u00a72710(d)(7) would have been superfluous; it is\ndifficult to see why an Indian tribe would suffer through\nthe intricate scheme of \u00a72710(d)(7) when more complete\nand more immediate relief would be available under\nEx parte Young.\u201d 517 U. S., at 75.\n  What is the equivalent \u201ccarefully crafted and intricate\nremedial scheme\u201d for enforcement of \u00a730(A)? The Court\nrelies on two aspects of the Medicaid Act, but, whether\nconsidered separately or in combination, neither suffices.\n  First, the Court cites 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396c, which author-\nizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to\nwithhold federal Medicaid payments to a State in whole or\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nin part if the Secretary determines that the State has\nfailed to comply with the obligations set out in \u00a71396a,\nincluding \u00a730(A). See ante, at 7\u20138. But in striking con-\ntrast to the remedial provision set out in the Indian Gam-\ning Regulatory Act, \u00a71396c provides no specific procedure\nthat parties actually affected by a State\u2019s violation of its\nstatutory obligations may invoke in lieu of Ex parte\nYoung\u2014leaving them without any other avenue for seek-\ning relief from the State. Nor will \u00a71396c always provide a\nparticularly effective means for redressing a State\u2019s viola-\ntions: If the State has violated \u00a730(A) by refusing to reim-\nburse medical providers at a level \u201csufficient to enlist\nenough providers so that care and services are available\u201d\nto Medicaid beneficiaries to the same extent as they are\navailable to \u201cthe general population,\u201d agency action result-\ning in a reduced flow of federal funds to that State will\noften be self-defeating. \u00a71396a(30)(A); see Brief for For-\nmer HHS Officials as Amici Curiae 18 (noting that HHS is\noften reluctant to initiate compliance actions because a\n\u201cstate\u2019s non-compliance creates a damned-if-you-do,\ndamned-if-you-don\u2019t scenario where the withholding of\nstate funds will lead to depriving the poor of essential\nmedical assistance\u201d). Far from rendering \u00a71396c \u201csuper-\nfluous,\u201d then, Ex parte Young actions would seem to be an\nanticipated and possibly necessary supplement to this\nlimited agency-enforcement mechanism. Seminole Tribe,\n517 U. S., at 75. Indeed, presumably for these reasons, we\nrecently rejected the very contention the Court now ac-\ncepts, holding that \u201c[t]he fact that the Federal Govern-\nment can exercise oversight of a federal spending program\nand even withhold or withdraw funds . . . does not demon-\nstrate that Congress has displayed an intent not to pro-\nvide the more complete and more immediate relief that\nwould otherwise be available under Ex parte Young.\u201d\nVirginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart, 563\nU. S. 247, ____\u2013____, n. 3 (2011) (slip op., at 7\u20138, n. 3)\n8     ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Section 1396c also parallels other provisions scattered\nthroughout the Social Security Act that likewise authorize\nthe withholding of federal funds to States that fail to fulfill\ntheir obligations. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7609(a), 1204, 1354. Yet, we\nhave consistently authorized judicial enforcement of the\nAct. See Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 6 (1980) (collect-\ning cases). Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397 (1970), pro-\nvides a fitting illustration. There, we considered a provi-\nsion of the Social Security Act mandating that, in\ncalculating benefits for participants in the Aid to Families\nwith Dependent Children Program, States make adjust-\nments \u201c \u2018to reflect fully changes in living costs.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n412 (quoting \u00a7602(a)(23) (1964 ed., Supp. IV)). We ex-\npressed no hesitation in concluding that federal courts\ncould require compliance with this obligation, explaining:\n\u201cIt is . . . peculiarly part of the duty of this tribunal, no\nless in the welfare field than in other areas of the law, to\nresolve disputes as to whether federal funds allocated to\nthe States are being expended in consonance with the\nconditions that Congress has attached to their use.\u201d Id.,\nat 422\u2013423. We so held notwithstanding the existence of\nan enforcement provision permitting a federal agency to\n\u201cmake a total or partial cutoff of federal funds.\u201d See id., at\n406, n. 8 (citing \u00a71316).\n   Second, perhaps attempting to reconcile its treatment of\n\u00a71396c (2012 ed.) with this longstanding precedent, the\nCourt focuses on the particular language of \u00a730(A), con-\ntending that this provision, at least, is so \u201cjudicially un-\nadministrable\u201d that Congress must have intended to\npreclude its enforcement in private suits. Ante, at 7.\nAdmittedly, the standard set out in \u00a730(A) is fairly broad,\nrequiring that a state Medicaid plan:\n     \u201cprovide such methods and procedures relating to the\n     utilization of, and the payment for, care and services\n     available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

The spe-\ncific equal access mandate invoked by the plaintiffs in this\ncase\u2014that reimbursement rates be \u201csufficient to enlist\nenough providers so that care and services are available\nunder the plan at least to the extent that such care and\nservices are available to the general population in the\ngeographic area\u201d\u2014was added to \u00a730(A) in 1989. 103 Stat.\n2260. At that time, multiple Federal Courts of Appeals\nhad held that the so-called Boren Amendment to the\nMedicaid Act was enforceable pursuant to \u00a71983\u2014as we\nsoon thereafter concluded it was. See Wilder v. Virginia\nHospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498, 504\u2013505, 524 (1990). The\nBoren Amendment employed language quite similar to\nthat used in \u00a730(A), requiring that a state plan:\n     \u201cprovide . . . for payment . . . of the hospital services,\n     nursing facility services, and services in an interme-\n     diate care facility for the mentally retarded provided\n     under the plan through the use of rates . . . which the\n     State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the\n     Secretary, are reasonable and adequate to meet the\n     costs which must be incurred by efficiently and eco-\n     nomically operated facilities in order to provide care\n10    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n     and services in conformity with applicable State and\n     Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety\n     standards and to assure that individuals eligible for\n     medical assistance have reasonable access . . . to in-\n     patient hospital services of adequate quality.\u201d\n     \u00a71396a(a)(13)(A) (1982 ed., Supp. V).\nIt is hard to believe that the Congress that enacted the\noperative version of \u00a730(A) could have failed to anticipate\nthat it might be similarly enforceable. Even if, as the\nCourt observes, the question whether the Boren Amend-\nment was enforceable under \u00a71983 was \u201cunsettled at the\ntime,\u201d ante, at 10 (emphasis deleted), surely Congress\nwould have spoken with far more clarity had it actually\nintended to preclude private enforcement of \u00a730(A)\nthrough not just \u00a71983 but also Ex parte Young.\n   Of course, the broad scope of \u00a730(A)\u2019s language is not\nirrelevant. But rather than compelling the conclusion that\nthe provision is wholly unenforceable by private parties,\nits breadth counsels in favor of interpreting \u00a730(A) to\nprovide substantial leeway to States, so that only in rare\nand extreme circumstances could a State actually be held\nto violate its mandate. The provision\u2019s scope may also\noften require a court to rely on HHS, which is \u201ccompara-\ntively expert in the statute\u2019s subject matter.\u201d Douglas v.\nIndependent Living Center of Southern Cal., Inc., 565 U. S\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7). When the agency has made\na determination with respect to what legal standard\nshould apply, or the validity of a State\u2019s procedures for\nimplementing its Medicaid plan, that determination\nshould be accorded the appropriate deference. See, e.g.,\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun-\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984); Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,\n323 U. S. 134 (1944).

S., at 406\u2013407; Pharmaceutical Re-\nsearch and Mfrs. of America v. Walsh, 538 U. S. 644, 673\n(2003) (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). Finally, because the authority invoked for\nenforcing \u00a730(A) is equitable in nature, a plaintiff is not\nentitled to relief as of right, but only in the sound discre-\ntion of the court. See Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell,\n480 U. S. 531, 542 (1987). Given the courts\u2019 ability to both\nrespect States\u2019 legitimate choices and defer to the federal\nagency when necessary, I see no basis for presuming that\nCongress believed the Judiciary to be completely incapable\nof enforcing \u00a730(A).*\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * That is not to say that the Court of Appeals in this case necessarily\napplied \u00a730(A) correctly. Indeed, there are good reasons to think the\ncourt construed \u00a730(A) to impose an overly stringent obligation on the\nStates. While the Ninth Circuit has understood \u00a730(A) to compel\nStates to \u201crely on responsible cost studies,\u201d and to reimburse for ser-\nvices at rates that \u201capproximate the cost of quality care provided\nefficiently and economically,\u201d Orthopaedic Hospital v. Belshe, 103 F. 3d\n1491, 1496 (1997), other courts have read \u00a730(A) to require only that\nrates be high enough to ensure that services are available to Medicaid\nparticipants. See Pennsylvania Pharmacists Assn. v. Houstoun, 283\nF. 3d 531, 538 (CA3 2002); Evergreen Presbyterian Ministries, Inc. v.\nHood, 235 F. 3d 908, 928\u2013929 (CA5 2000); Methodist Hospitals, Inc. v.\nSullivan, 91 F. 3d 1026, 1030 (CA7 1996). This Court declined to grant\ncertiorari to address whether the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of \u00a730(A) is\ncorrect. See 573 U. S. ___ (2014). But JUSTICE BREYER, in his concur-\nrence, appears to mistake that question about the merits of the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s standard for the question this Court actually granted certio-\nrari to address\u2014that is, whether \u00a730 is judicially enforceable at all.\nSee ante, at 3\u20134 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judg-\nment). To answer that question, one need only recognize, as JUSTICE\nBREYER does, that \u201cfederal courts have long become accustomed to\nreviewing for reasonableness or constitutionality the rate-setting\ndeterminations made by agencies.\u201d Ante, at 3. A private party who\ninvokes the jurisdiction of the federal courts in order to enjoin a state\nagency\u2019s implementation of rates that are so unreasonably low as to\nviolate \u00a730(A) seeks a determination of exactly this sort.\n12   ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                         *     *    *\n  In sum, far from identifying a \u201ccarefully crafted . . .\nremedial scheme\u201d demonstrating that Congress intended\nto foreclose Ex parte Young enforcement of \u00a730(A), Semi-\nnole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 73\u201374, the Court points only to\ntwo provisions.       The first is \u00a71396c, an agency-\nenforcement provision that, given our precedent, cannot\npreclude private actions. The second is \u00a730(A) itself,\nwhich, while perhaps broad, cannot be understood to mani-\nfest congressional intent to preclude judicial involvement.\n  The Court\u2019s error today has very real consequences.\nPreviously, a State that set reimbursement rates so low\nthat providers were unwilling to furnish a covered service\nfor those who need it could be compelled by those affected\nto respect the obligation imposed by \u00a730(A). Now, it must\nsuffice that a federal agency, with many programs to\noversee, has authority to address such violations through\nthe drastic and often counterproductive measure of with-\nholding the funds that pay for such services. Because a\nfaithful application of our precedents would have led to a\ncontrary result, I respectfully dissent.\n",

Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) Reading the Supremacy Clause not to confer a private right of\n    action is consistent with this Court\u2019s preemption jurisprudence. The\n    ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal\n    officers is the creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history\n    of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England.\n    This Court has never held nor suggested that this judge-made reme-\n    dy, in its application to state officers, rests upon an implied right of\n    action contained in the Supremacy Clause.

The power of feder-\n    al courts of equity to enjoin unlawful executive action is subject to\n    express and implied statutory limitations. See, e.g., Seminole Tribe\n    of Fla. v.

It is equally apparent that the Supremacy Clause\nis not the \u201c \u2018source of any federal rights,\u2019 \u201d Golden State\nTransit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 107 (1989)\n(quoting Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organiza-\ntion, 441 U. S. 600, 613 (1979)), and certainly does not\ncreate a cause of action. It instructs courts what to do\nwhen state and federal law clash, but is silent regarding\nwho may enforce federal laws in court, and in what cir-\ncumstances they may do so.\n   Hamilton wrote that the Supremacy Clause \u201conly de-\nclares a truth, which flows immediately and necessarily\nfrom the institution of a Federal Government.\u201d The Fed-\neralist No. 33, p. 207 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). And Story de-\nscribed the Clause as \u201ca positive affirmance of that, which\nis necessarily implied.\u201d 3 Commentaries on the Constitu-\ntion of the United States \u00a71831, p. 693 (1833). These\ndescriptions would have been grossly inapt if the Clause\n4    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwere understood to give affected parties a constitutional\n(and hence congressionally unalterable) right to enforce\nfederal laws against the States. And had it been under-\nstood to provide such significant private rights against the\nStates, one would expect to find that mentioned in the\npreratification historical record, which contained ample\ndiscussion of the Supremacy Clause by both supporters\nand opponents of ratification. See C. Drahozal, The Su-\npremacy Clause: A Reference Guide to the United States\nConstitution 25 (2004); The Federalist No. 44, at 306 (J.\nMadison). We are aware of no such mention, and re-\nspondents have not provided any. Its conspicuous absence\nmilitates strongly against their position.\n  Additionally, it is important to read the Supremacy\nClause in the context of the Constitution as a whole.\nArticle I vests Congress with broad discretion over the\nmanner of implementing its enumerated powers, giving it\nauthority to \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and\nproper for carrying [them] into Execution.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78. We\nhave said that this confers upon the Legislature \u201cthat\ndiscretion, with respect to the means by which the powers\n[the Constitution] confers are to be carried into execution,\nwhich will enable that body to perform the high duties\nassigned to it,\u201d McCulloch v.

It is unlikely that the Constitution gave Congress\nsuch broad discretion with regard to the enactment of\nlaws, while simultaneously limiting Congress\u2019s power over\nthe manner of their implementation, making it impossible\nto leave the enforcement of federal law to federal actors. If\nthe Supremacy Clause includes a private right of action,\nthen the Constitution requires Congress to permit the\nenforcement of its laws by private actors, significantly\ncurtailing its ability to guide the implementation of fed-\neral law. It would be strange indeed to give a clause that\nmakes federal law supreme a reading that limits Con-\ngress\u2019s power to enforce that law, by imposing mandatory\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

For\nonce a case or controversy properly comes before a court,\njudges are bound by federal law. Thus, a court may not\nconvict a criminal defendant of violating a state law that\nfederal law prohibits. See, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Nelson,\n350 U. S. 497, 499, 509 (1956). Similarly, a court may not\nhold a civil defendant liable under state law for conduct\nfederal law requires. See, e.g., Mutual Pharmaceutical Co.\nv. Bartlett, 570 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2013) (slip op., at 13\u2013\n14). And, as we have long recognized, if an individual\nclaims federal law immunizes him from state regulation,\nthe court may issue an injunction upon finding the state\nregulatory actions preempted. Ex parte Young, 209 U. S.\n123, 155\u2013156 (1908).\n  Respondents contend that our preemption jurispru-\ndence\u2014specifically, the fact that we have regularly con-\nsidered whether to enjoin the enforcement of state laws\nthat are alleged to violate federal law\u2014demonstrates that\nthe Supremacy Clause creates a cause of action for its\nviolation. They are incorrect. It is true enough that we\nhave long held that federal courts may in some circum-\nstances grant injunctive relief against state officers who\nare violating, or planning to violate, federal law. See, e.g.,\nOsborn v. Bank of United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85451\"><a href=\"/opinion/85451/osborn-v-bank-of-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 838\u2013839,\n844 (1824); Ex parte Young, supra, at 150\u2013151 (citing\nDavis v.

But that has\nbeen true not only with respect to violations of federal law\nby state officials, but also with respect to violations of\nfederal law by federal officials. See American School of\nMagnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U. S. 94, 110 (1902);\nsee generally L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative\nAction 152\u2013196 (1965).

See Jaffe &\nHenderson, Judicial Review and the Rule of Law: Histori-\ncal Origins, 72 L. Q. Rev. 345 (1956). It is a judge-made\nremedy, and we have never held or even suggested that, in\nits application to state officers, it rests upon an implied\nright of action contained in the Supremacy Clause. That\nis because, as even the dissent implicitly acknowledges,\npost, at 4 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) it does not. The\nNinth Circuit erred in holding otherwise.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  We turn next to respondents\u2019 contention that, quite\napart from any cause of action conferred by the Supre-\nmacy Clause, this suit can proceed against Idaho in equity.\n  The power of federal courts of equity to enjoin unlawful\nexecutive action is subject to express and implied statu-\ntory limitations. See, e.g., Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Flor-\nida, 517 U. S. 44, 74 (1996). \u201c \u2018Courts of equity can no more\ndisregard statutory and constitutional requirements and\nprovisions than can courts of law.\u2019 \u201d INS v. Pangilinan,\n486 U.

In\nour view the Medicaid Act implicitly precludes private\nenforcement of \u00a730(A), and respondents cannot, by invok-\ning our equitable powers, circumvent Congress\u2019s exclusion\nof private enforcement.

J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4\u20135).\n   Two aspects of \u00a730(A) establish Congress\u2019s \u201cintent to\nforeclose\u201d equitable relief. Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv.\nComm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 647 (2002). First, the sole\nremedy Congress provided for a State\u2019s failure to comply\nwith Medicaid\u2019s requirements\u2014for the State\u2019s \u201cbreach\u201d of\nthe Spending Clause contract\u2014is the withholding of Medi-\ncaid funds by the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-\nvices. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396c. As we have elsewhere ex-\nplained, the \u201cexpress provision of one method of enforcing\na substantive rule suggests that Congress intended to\npreclude others.\u201d Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275,\n290 (2001).\n   The provision for the Secretary\u2019s enforcement by with-\nholding funds might not, by itself, preclude the availability\nof equitable relief. See Virginia Office for Protection and\nAdvocacy v. Stewart, 563 U. S. 247, ___\u2013___, n. 3 (2011)\n(slip op., at 7\u20138, n. 3). But it does so when combined with\nthe judicially unadministrable nature of \u00a730(A)\u2019s text. It\nis difficult to imagine a requirement broader and less\nspecific than \u00a730(A)\u2019s mandate that state plans provide for\npayments that are \u201cconsistent with efficiency, economy,\nand quality of care,\u201d all the while \u201csafeguard[ing] against\nunnecessary utilization of . . . care and services.\u201d Explicitly\nconferring enforcement of this judgment-laden standard\nupon the Secretary alone establishes, we think, that Con-\ngress \u201cwanted to make the agency remedy that it provided\nexclusive,\u201d thereby achieving \u201cthe expertise, uniformity,\nwidespread consultation, and resulting administrative\nguidance that can accompany agency decisionmaking,\u201d\nand avoiding \u201cthe comparative risk of inconsistent inter-\npretations and misincentives that can arise out of an\noccasional inappropriate application of the statute in a\nprivate action.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 292\n(2002) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). The sheer\ncomplexity associated with enforcing \u00a730(A), coupled with\n8    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe express provision of an administrative remedy, \u00a71396c,\nshows that the Medicaid Act precludes private enforce-\nment of \u00a730(A) in the courts.\n                               B\n   The dissent agrees with us that the Supremacy Clause\ndoes not provide an implied right of action, and that Con-\ngress may displace the equitable relief that is traditionally\navailable to enforce federal law. It disagrees only with our\nconclusion that such displacement has occurred here.\n   The dissent insists that, \u201cbecause Congress is undoubt-\nedly aware of the federal courts\u2019 long-established practice\nof enjoining preempted state action, it should generally be\npresumed to contemplate such enforcement unless it\naffirmatively manifests a contrary intent.\u201d Post, at 4\n(emphasis added). But a \u201clong-established practice\u201d does\nnot justify a rule that denies statutory text its fairest\nreading. Section 30(A), fairly read in the context of the\nMedicaid Act, \u201cdisplay[s] a[n] intent to foreclose\u201d the\navailability of equitable relief. Verizon, supra, at 647. We\nhave no warrant to revise Congress\u2019s scheme simply be-\ncause it did not \u201caffirmatively\u201d preclude the availability of\na judge-made action at equity. See Seminole Tribe, supra,\nat 75 (inferring, in the absence of an \u201caffirmative\u201d state-\nment by Congress, that equitable relief was unavailable).\n   Equally unavailing is the dissent\u2019s reliance on \u00a730(A)\u2019s\nhistory. Section 30(A) was amended, on December 19,\n1989, to include what the dissent calls the \u201cequal access\nmandate,\u201d post, at 9\u2014the requirement that reimburse-\nment rates be \u201csufficient to enlist enough providers so that\ncare and services are available under the plan at least to\nthe extent that such care and services are available to the\ngeneral population in the geographic area.\u201d \u00a76402(a), 103\nStat. 2260. There existed at the time another provision,\nknown as the \u201cBoren Amendment,\u201d that likewise imposed\nbroad requirements on state Medicaid plans. 42 U. S. C.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71396a(a)(13)(A) (1982 ed., Supp. V). Lower courts had\ninterpreted the Boren Amendment to be privately enforce-\nable under \u00a71983. From this, the dissent infers that, when\nCongress amended \u00a730(A), it could not \u201chave failed to\nanticipate\u201d that \u00a730(A)\u2019s broad language\u2014or at least that\nof the equal access mandate\u2014would be interpreted as\nenforceable in a private action. Thus, concludes the dis-\nsent, Congress\u2019s failure to expressly preclude the private\nenforcement of \u00a730(A) suggests it intended not to preclude\nprivate enforcement. Post, at 10.\n   This argument appears to rely on the prior-construction\ncanon; the rule that, when \u201cjudicial interpretations have\nsettled the meaning of an existing statutory provision,\nrepetition of the same language in a new statute\u201d is pre-\nsumed to incorporate that interpretation. Bragdon v.\nAbbott, 524 U. S. 624, 645 (1998). But that canon has no\napplication here. The language of the two provisions is\nnowhere near identical; and even if it had been, the ques-\ntion whether the Boren Amendment permitted private\nactions was far from \u201csettled.\u201d When Congress amended\n\u00a730(A) in 1989, this Court had already granted certiorari\nto decide, but had not yet decided, whether the Boren\nAmendment could be enforced through a \u00a71983 suit. See\nBaliles v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 493 U. S. 808 (Oct. 2,\n1989) (granting certiorari). Our decision permitting a\n\u00a71983 action did not issue until June 14, 1990\u2014almost six\nmonths after the amendment to \u00a730(A). Wilder v. Virginia\nHospital Assn., 496 U.

They do not assert a \u00a71983 action,\nsince our later opinions plainly repudiate the ready implication of a\n\u00a71983 action that Wilder exemplified. See Gonzaga, Univ. v. Due, 536\nU. S. 273, 283 (2002) (expressly \u201creject[ing] the notion,\u201d implicit in\nWilder, \u201cthat our cases permit anything short of an unambiguously\nconferred right to support a cause of action brought under \u00a71983\u201d).\n10   ARMSTRONG v.

That is not the case. Their relief\nmust be sought initially through the Secretary rather than\nthrough the courts. The dissent\u2019s complaint that the\nsanction available to the Secretary (the cut-off of funding)\nis too massive to be a realistic source of relief seems to us\nmistaken. We doubt that the Secretary\u2019s notice to a\nState that its compensation scheme is inadequate will be\nignored.\n                             IV\n   The last possible source of a cause of action for respond-\nents is the Medicaid Act itself. They do not claim that,\nand rightly so. Section 30(A) lacks the sort of rights-\ncreating language needed to imply a private right of ac-\ntion. Sandoval, supra at 286\u2013287. It is phrased as a\ndirective to the federal agency charged with approving\nstate Medicaid plans, not as a conferral of the right to sue\nupon the beneficiaries of the State\u2019s decision to participate\nin Medicaid. The Act says that the \u201cSecretary shall ap-\nprove any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in\nsubsection (a),\u201d the subsection that includes \u00a730(A). 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71396a(b).

Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). The notion\nthat respondents have a right to sue derives, perhaps,\nfrom the fact that they are beneficiaries of the federal-\nstate Medicaid agreement, and that intended beneficiar-\nies, in modern times at least, can sue to enforce the obli-\ngations of private contracting parties. See 13 R. Lord,\nWilliston on Contracts \u00a7\u00a737:12\u201337.13, pp. 123\u2013135 (4th ed.\n2013). We doubt, to begin with, that providers are intended\nbeneficiaries (as opposed to mere incidental beneficiar-\nies) of the Medicaid agreement, which was concluded for\nthe benefit of the infirm whom the providers were to serve,\nrather than for the benefit of the providers themselves.\nSee Pharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of America v.\nWalsh, 538 U.

More fundamentally, however, the modern\njurisprudence permitting intended beneficiaries to sue\ndoes not generally apply to contracts between a private\nparty and the government, Astra USA, Inc. v.

I believe the answer to this\nquestion is no.\n   That answer does not follow from the application of a\nsimple, fixed legal formula separating federal statutes\nthat may underlie this kind of injunctive action from those\nthat may not. \u201c[T]he statute books are too many, the laws\ntoo diverse, and their purposes too complex, for any single\nlegal formula to offer\u201d courts \u201cmore than general guid-\nance.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 291 (2012)\n(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). Rather, I believe\nthat several characteristics of the federal statute before\nus, when taken together, make clear that Congress in-\ntended to foreclose respondents from bringing this particu-\nlar action for injunctive relief.\n   For one thing, as the majority points out, \u00a730(A) of the\nMedicaid Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A), sets forth a\n2    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nfederal mandate that is broad and nonspecific. See ante,\nat 7. But, more than that, \u00a730(A) applies its broad stand-\nards to the setting of rates. The history of ratemaking\ndemonstrates that administrative agencies are far better\nsuited to this task than judges. More than a century ago,\nCongress created the Interstate Commerce Commission,\nthe first great federal regulatory rate-setting agency, and\nendowed it with authority to set \u201creasonable\u201d railroad\nrates. Ch. 104, 24 Stat. 379 (1887). It did so in part be-\ncause judicial efforts to maintain reasonable rate levels\nhad proved inadequate. See I. Sharfman, Railway Regula-\ntion: An Analysis of the Underlying Problems in Railway\nEconomics from the Standpoint of Government Regulation\n43\u201344 (1915).\n   Reading \u00a730(A) underscores the complexity and nonju-\ndicial nature of the rate-setting task. That provision\nrequires State Medicaid plans to \u201cassure that payments\nare consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care\nand are sufficient to enlist enough providers\u201d to assure\n\u201ccare and services\u201d equivalent to that \u201cavailable to the\ngeneral population in the geographic area.\u201d \u00a71396a(a)\n(30)(A). The methods that a state agency, such as Idaho\u2019s\nDepartment of Health and Welfare, uses to make this kind\nof determination may involve subsidiary determinations\nof, for example, the actual cost of providing quality ser-\nvices, including personnel and total operating expenses;\nchanges in public expectations with respect to delivery of\nservices; inflation; a comparison of rates paid in neighbor-\ning States for comparable services; and a comparison of\nany rates paid for comparable services in other public or\nprivate capacities. See App. to Reply to Brief in Opposi-\ntion 16; Idaho Code Ann. \u00a756\u2013118 (2012).\n   At the same time, \u00a730(A) applies broadly, covering\nreimbursements provided to approximately 1.36 million\ndoctors, serving over 69 million patients across the Nation.\nSee Dept. of Health and Human Servs., Office of Inspector\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

And States engage in\ntime-consuming efforts to obtain public input on proposed\nplan amendments. See, e.g., Kansas Medicaid: Design and\nImplementation of a Public Input and Stakeholder Con-\nsult Process (Sept. 16, 2011) (prepared by Deloitte Con-\nsulting, LLP) (describing public input on Kansas\u2019 proposed\nMedicaid amendments).\n   I recognize that federal courts have long become accus-\ntomed to reviewing for reasonableness or constitutionality\nthe rate-setting determinations made by agencies. See 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7706; FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591,\n602\u2013606 (1944). But this is not such an action. Instead,\nthe lower courts here, relying on the rate-setting standard\narticulated in Orthopaedic Hospital v. Belshe, 103 F. 3d\n1491 (CA9 1997), required the State to set rates that\n\u201capproximate the cost of quality care provided efficiently\nand economically.\u201d Id., at 1496. See Inclusion, Inc. v.\nArmstrong, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

To find in the law a\nbasis for courts to engage in such direct rate-setting could\nset a precedent for allowing other similar actions, poten-\ntially resulting in rates set by federal judges (of whom\nthere are several hundred) outside the ordinary channel of\nfederal judicial review of agency decisionmaking. The\nconsequence, I fear, would be increased litigation, incon-\nsistent results, and disorderly administration of highly\ncomplex federal programs that demand public consulta-\ntion, administrative guidance and coherence for their\nsuccess. I do not believe Congress intended to allow a\nstatute-based injunctive action that poses such risks (and\nthat has the other features I mention).\n   I recognize that courts might in particular instances be\nable to resolve rate-related requests for injunctive relief\nquite easily. But I see no easy way to separate in advance\nthe potentially simple sheep from the more harmful rate-\n4     ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nmaking goats. In any event, this case, I fear, belongs in\nthe latter category. See Belshe, supra, at 1496. Compare\nBrief for Respondents 2, n. 1 (claiming that respondents\nseek only to enforce federally approved methodology), with\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5, n. 2 (the rele-\nvant methodology has not been approved). See also Idaho\nCode Ann. \u00a756\u2013118 (describing in general terms what\nappears to be a complex rate-setting methodology, while\nleaving unclear the extent to which Idaho is bound to use,\nrather than merely consider, actual provider costs).\n  For another thing, like the majority, I would ask why, in\nthe complex rate-setting area, other forms of relief are\ninadequate. If the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-\nvices concludes that a State is failing to follow legally\nrequired federal rules, the Secretary can withhold federal\nfunds. See ante, at 7 (citing 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396c). If with-\nholding funds does not work, the federal agency may be\nable to sue a State to compel compliance with federal\nrules. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 52 (Solicitor General and\nrespondents acknowledging that the Federal Government\nmight be able to sue a State to enjoin it from paying less\nthan what \u00a730(A) requires). Cf., e.g., Arizona v. United\nStates, 567 U. S. __ (2012) (allowing similar action in\nanother context).\n   Moreover, why could respondents not ask the federal\nagency to interpret its rules to respondents\u2019 satisfaction, to\nmodify those rules, to promulgate new rules or to enforce\nold ones? See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7553(e). Normally, when such\nrequests are denied, an injured party can seek judicial\nreview of the agency\u2019s refusal on the grounds that it is\n\u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\nnot in accordance with law.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7702, 706(2)(A). And an\ninjured party can ask the court to \u201ccompel agency action\nunlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7702,\n706(1).

See Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 527 (2007). As a result, it may\nbe difficult for respondents to prevail on an APA claim\nunless it stems from an agency\u2019s particularly egregious\nfailure to act. But, if that is so, it is because Congress\ndecided to vest broad discretion in the agency to interpret\nand to enforce \u00a730(A).

To the contrary,\nthis Court has adjudicated such requests for equitable\nrelief since the early days of the Republic. Nevertheless,\ntoday the Court holds that Congress has foreclosed private\nparties from invoking the equitable powers of the federal\ncourts to require States to comply with \u00a730(A) of the Medi-\ncaid Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A). It does so without\npointing to the sort of detailed remedial scheme we have\npreviously deemed necessary to establish congressional\nintent to preclude resort to equity. Instead, the Court\nrelies on Congress\u2019 provision for agency enforcement of\n\u00a730(A)\u2014an enforcement mechanism of the sort we have\nalready definitively determined not to foreclose private\nactions\u2014and on the mere fact that \u00a730(A) contains rela-\ntively broad language. As I cannot agree that these statu-\ntory provisions demonstrate the requisite congressional\nintent to restrict the equitable authority of the federal\ncourts, I respectfully dissent.\n2    ARMSTRONG v.

Perhaps the most famous exposition of this\nprinciple is our decision in Ex parte Young, 209 U.

By contrast, a plaintiff invoking\n\u00a71983 or an implied statutory cause of action may seek a\nvariety of remedies\u2014including damages\u2014from a poten-\ntially broad range of parties. Rather than simply pointing\nto background equitable principles authorizing the action\nthat Congress presumably has not overridden, such a\nplaintiff must demonstrate specific congressional intent to\ncreate a statutory right to these remedies. See Gonzaga\nUniv. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 290 (2002); Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286 (2001); see also Golden State\nTransit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U.

For these reasons, the principles that we have\ndeveloped to determine whether a statute creates an\nimplied right of action, or is enforceable through \u00a71983,\nare not transferable to the Ex parte Young context.\n                                II\n  In concluding that Congress has \u201cimplicitly preclude[d]\nprivate enforcement of \u00a730(A),\u201d ante, at 6, the Court ig-\nnores this critical distinction and threatens the vitality of\nour Ex parte Young jurisprudence. The Court identifies\nonly a single prior decision\u2014Seminole Tribe\u2014in which we\nhave ever discerned such congressional intent to foreclose\nequitable enforcement of a statutory mandate. Ante, at 6.\nEven the most cursory review of that decision reveals how\nfar afield it is from this case.\n  In Seminole Tribe, the plaintiff Indian Tribe had in-\nvoked Ex parte Young in seeking to compel the State of\n6    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nFlorida to \u201cnegotiate in good faith with [the] tribe toward\nthe formation of a compact\u201d governing certain gaming\nactivities, as required by a provision of the Indian Gaming\nRegulatory Act, 25 U. S. C. \u00a72710(d)(3). 517 U. S., at 47.\nWe rejected this effort, observing that \u201cCongress passed\n\u00a72710(d)(3) in conjunction with the carefully crafted and\nintricate remedial scheme set forth in \u00a72710(d)(7).\u201d Id., at\n73\u201374. That latter provision allowed a tribe to sue for\nviolations of the duty to negotiate 180 days after request-\ning such negotiations, but specifically limited the remedy\nthat a court could grant to \u201can order directing the State\nand the Indian tribe to conclude a compact within 60\ndays,\u201d and provided that the only sanction for the violation\nof such an order would be to require the parties to \u201csub-\nmit a proposed compact to a mediator.\u201d Id., at 74;\n\u00a7\u00a72710(d)(7)(B)(i), (iii), (iv). The statute further directed\nthat if the State should fail to abide by the mediator\u2019s\nselected compact, the sole remedy would be for the Secre-\ntary of the Interior, in consultation with the tribe, to\nprescribe regulations governing gaming. See 517 U. S., at\n74\u201375; \u00a72710(d)(7)(B)(vii). We concluded that Congress\nmust have intended this procedural route to be the exclu-\nsive means of enforcing \u00a72710(d)(3). As we explained: \u201cIf\n\u00a72710(d)(3) could be enforced in a suit under Ex parte\nYoung, \u00a72710(d)(7) would have been superfluous; it is\ndifficult to see why an Indian tribe would suffer through\nthe intricate scheme of \u00a72710(d)(7) when more complete\nand more immediate relief would be available under\nEx parte Young.\u201d 517 U. S., at 75.\n  What is the equivalent \u201ccarefully crafted and intricate\nremedial scheme\u201d for enforcement of \u00a730(A)? The Court\nrelies on two aspects of the Medicaid Act, but, whether\nconsidered separately or in combination, neither suffices.\n  First, the Court cites 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396c, which author-\nizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to\nwithhold federal Medicaid payments to a State in whole or\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nin part if the Secretary determines that the State has\nfailed to comply with the obligations set out in \u00a71396a,\nincluding \u00a730(A). See ante, at 7\u20138. But in striking con-\ntrast to the remedial provision set out in the Indian Gam-\ning Regulatory Act, \u00a71396c provides no specific procedure\nthat parties actually affected by a State\u2019s violation of its\nstatutory obligations may invoke in lieu of Ex parte\nYoung\u2014leaving them without any other avenue for seek-\ning relief from the State. Nor will \u00a71396c always provide a\nparticularly effective means for redressing a State\u2019s viola-\ntions: If the State has violated \u00a730(A) by refusing to reim-\nburse medical providers at a level \u201csufficient to enlist\nenough providers so that care and services are available\u201d\nto Medicaid beneficiaries to the same extent as they are\navailable to \u201cthe general population,\u201d agency action result-\ning in a reduced flow of federal funds to that State will\noften be self-defeating. \u00a71396a(30)(A); see Brief for For-\nmer HHS Officials as Amici Curiae 18 (noting that HHS is\noften reluctant to initiate compliance actions because a\n\u201cstate\u2019s non-compliance creates a damned-if-you-do,\ndamned-if-you-don\u2019t scenario where the withholding of\nstate funds will lead to depriving the poor of essential\nmedical assistance\u201d). Far from rendering \u00a71396c \u201csuper-\nfluous,\u201d then, Ex parte Young actions would seem to be an\nanticipated and possibly necessary supplement to this\nlimited agency-enforcement mechanism. Seminole Tribe,\n517 U. S., at 75. Indeed, presumably for these reasons, we\nrecently rejected the very contention the Court now ac-\ncepts, holding that \u201c[t]he fact that the Federal Govern-\nment can exercise oversight of a federal spending program\nand even withhold or withdraw funds . . . does not demon-\nstrate that Congress has displayed an intent not to pro-\nvide the more complete and more immediate relief that\nwould otherwise be available under Ex parte Young.\u201d\nVirginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart, 563\nU. S. 247, ____\u2013____, n. 3 (2011) (slip op., at 7\u20138, n. 3)\n8     ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Section 1396c also parallels other provisions scattered\nthroughout the Social Security Act that likewise authorize\nthe withholding of federal funds to States that fail to fulfill\ntheir obligations. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7609(a), 1204, 1354. Yet, we\nhave consistently authorized judicial enforcement of the\nAct. See Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 6 (1980) (collect-\ning cases). Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397 (1970), pro-\nvides a fitting illustration. There, we considered a provi-\nsion of the Social Security Act mandating that, in\ncalculating benefits for participants in the Aid to Families\nwith Dependent Children Program, States make adjust-\nments \u201c \u2018to reflect fully changes in living costs.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n412 (quoting \u00a7602(a)(23) (1964 ed., Supp. IV)). We ex-\npressed no hesitation in concluding that federal courts\ncould require compliance with this obligation, explaining:\n\u201cIt is . . . peculiarly part of the duty of this tribunal, no\nless in the welfare field than in other areas of the law, to\nresolve disputes as to whether federal funds allocated to\nthe States are being expended in consonance with the\nconditions that Congress has attached to their use.\u201d Id.,\nat 422\u2013423. We so held notwithstanding the existence of\nan enforcement provision permitting a federal agency to\n\u201cmake a total or partial cutoff of federal funds.\u201d See id., at\n406, n. 8 (citing \u00a71316).\n   Second, perhaps attempting to reconcile its treatment of\n\u00a71396c (2012 ed.) with this longstanding precedent, the\nCourt focuses on the particular language of \u00a730(A), con-\ntending that this provision, at least, is so \u201cjudicially un-\nadministrable\u201d that Congress must have intended to\npreclude its enforcement in private suits. Ante, at 7.\nAdmittedly, the standard set out in \u00a730(A) is fairly broad,\nrequiring that a state Medicaid plan:\n     \u201cprovide such methods and procedures relating to the\n     utilization of, and the payment for, care and services\n     available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

The spe-\ncific equal access mandate invoked by the plaintiffs in this\ncase\u2014that reimbursement rates be \u201csufficient to enlist\nenough providers so that care and services are available\nunder the plan at least to the extent that such care and\nservices are available to the general population in the\ngeographic area\u201d\u2014was added to \u00a730(A) in 1989. 103 Stat.\n2260. At that time, multiple Federal Courts of Appeals\nhad held that the so-called Boren Amendment to the\nMedicaid Act was enforceable pursuant to \u00a71983\u2014as we\nsoon thereafter concluded it was. See Wilder v. Virginia\nHospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498, 504\u2013505, 524 (1990). The\nBoren Amendment employed language quite similar to\nthat used in \u00a730(A), requiring that a state plan:\n     \u201cprovide . . . for payment . . . of the hospital services,\n     nursing facility services, and services in an interme-\n     diate care facility for the mentally retarded provided\n     under the plan through the use of rates . . . which the\n     State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the\n     Secretary, are reasonable and adequate to meet the\n     costs which must be incurred by efficiently and eco-\n     nomically operated facilities in order to provide care\n10    ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n     and services in conformity with applicable State and\n     Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety\n     standards and to assure that individuals eligible for\n     medical assistance have reasonable access . . . to in-\n     patient hospital services of adequate quality.\u201d\n     \u00a71396a(a)(13)(A) (1982 ed., Supp. V).\nIt is hard to believe that the Congress that enacted the\noperative version of \u00a730(A) could have failed to anticipate\nthat it might be similarly enforceable. Even if, as the\nCourt observes, the question whether the Boren Amend-\nment was enforceable under \u00a71983 was \u201cunsettled at the\ntime,\u201d ante, at 10 (emphasis deleted), surely Congress\nwould have spoken with far more clarity had it actually\nintended to preclude private enforcement of \u00a730(A)\nthrough not just \u00a71983 but also Ex parte Young.\n   Of course, the broad scope of \u00a730(A)\u2019s language is not\nirrelevant. But rather than compelling the conclusion that\nthe provision is wholly unenforceable by private parties,\nits breadth counsels in favor of interpreting \u00a730(A) to\nprovide substantial leeway to States, so that only in rare\nand extreme circumstances could a State actually be held\nto violate its mandate. The provision\u2019s scope may also\noften require a court to rely on HHS, which is \u201ccompara-\ntively expert in the statute\u2019s subject matter.\u201d Douglas v.\nIndependent Living Center of Southern Cal., Inc., 565 U. S\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7). When the agency has made\na determination with respect to what legal standard\nshould apply, or the validity of a State\u2019s procedures for\nimplementing its Medicaid plan, that determination\nshould be accorded the appropriate deference. See, e.g.,\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun-\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984); Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,\n323 U. S. 134 (1944). And if faced with a question that\npresents a special demand for agency expertise, a court\nmight call for the views of the agency, or refer the question\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    11\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nto the agency under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.\nSee Rosado, 397 U. S., at 406\u2013407; Pharmaceutical Re-\nsearch and Mfrs. of America v. Walsh, 538 U. S. 644, 673\n(2003) (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). Finally, because the authority invoked for\nenforcing \u00a730(A) is equitable in nature, a plaintiff is not\nentitled to relief as of right, but only in the sound discre-\ntion of the court. See Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell,\n480 U. S. 531, 542 (1987). Given the courts\u2019 ability to both\nrespect States\u2019 legitimate choices and defer to the federal\nagency when necessary, I see no basis for presuming that\nCongress believed the Judiciary to be completely incapable\nof enforcing \u00a730(A).*\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * That is not to say that the Court of Appeals in this case necessarily\napplied \u00a730(A) correctly. Indeed, there are good reasons to think the\ncourt construed \u00a730(A) to impose an overly stringent obligation on the\nStates. While the Ninth Circuit has understood \u00a730(A) to compel\nStates to \u201crely on responsible cost studies,\u201d and to reimburse for ser-\nvices at rates that \u201capproximate the cost of quality care provided\nefficiently and economically,\u201d Orthopaedic Hospital v. Belshe, 103 F. 3d\n1491, 1496 (1997), other courts have read \u00a730(A) to require only that\nrates be high enough to ensure that services are available to Medicaid\nparticipants. See Pennsylvania Pharmacists Assn. v. Houstoun, 283\nF. 3d 531, 538 (CA3 2002); Evergreen Presbyterian Ministries, Inc. v.\nHood, 235 F. 3d 908, 928\u2013929 (CA5 2000); Methodist Hospitals, Inc. v.\nSullivan, 91 F. 3d 1026, 1030 (CA7 1996). This Court declined to grant\ncertiorari to address whether the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of \u00a730(A) is\ncorrect. See 573 U. S. ___ (2014). But JUSTICE BREYER, in his concur-\nrence, appears to mistake that question about the merits of the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s standard for the question this Court actually granted certio-\nrari to address\u2014that is, whether \u00a730 is judicially enforceable at all.\nSee ante, at 3\u20134 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judg-\nment). To answer that question, one need only recognize, as JUSTICE\nBREYER does, that \u201cfederal courts have long become accustomed to\nreviewing for reasonableness or constitutionality the rate-setting\ndeterminations made by agencies.\u201d Ante, at 3. A private party who\ninvokes the jurisdiction of the federal courts in order to enjoin a state\nagency\u2019s implementation of rates that are so unreasonably low as to\nviolate \u00a730(A) seeks a determination of exactly this sort.\n12   ARMSTRONG v. EXCEPTIONAL CHILD CENTER, INC.\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                         *     *    *\n  In sum, far from identifying a \u201ccarefully crafted . . .\nremedial scheme\u201d demonstrating that Congress intended\nto foreclose Ex parte Young enforcement of \u00a730(A), Semi-\nnole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 73\u201374, the Court points only to\ntwo provisions.       The first is \u00a71396c, an agency-\nenforcement provision that, given our precedent, cannot\npreclude private actions. The second is \u00a730(A) itself,\nwhich, while perhaps broad, cannot be understood to mani-\nfest congressional intent to preclude judicial involvement.\n  The Court\u2019s error today has very real consequences.\nPreviously, a State that set reimbursement rates so low\nthat providers were unwilling to furnish a covered service\nfor those who need it could be compelled by those affected\nto respect the obligation imposed by \u00a730(A). Now, it must\nsuffice that a federal agency, with many programs to\noversee, has authority to address such violations through\nthe drastic and often counterproductive measure of with-\nholding the funds that pay for such services. Because a\nfaithful application of our precedents would have led to a\ncontrary result, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
