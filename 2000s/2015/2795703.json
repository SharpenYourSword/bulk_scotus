KWAI FUN WONG\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 13\u20131074. Argued December 10, 2014\u2014Decided April 22, 2015*\nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides that a tort claim against\n  the United States \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d unless the claimant meets\n  two deadlines. First, a claim must be presented to the appropriate\n  federal agency for administrative review \u201cwithin two years after [the]\n  claim accrues.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72401(b). Second, if the agency denies the\n  claim, the claimant may file suit in federal court \u201cwithin six months\u201d\n  of the agency\u2019s denial. Ibid.\n     Kwai Fun Wong and Marlene June, respondents in Nos. 13\u20131074\n  and 13\u20131075, respectively, each missed one of those deadlines. Wong\n  failed to file her FTCA claim in federal court within 6 months, but\n  argued that that was only because the District Court had not permit-\n  ted her to file that claim until after the period expired. June failed to\n  present her FTCA claim to a federal agency within 2 years, but ar-\n  gued that her untimely filing should be excused because the Govern-\n  ment had, in her view, concealed facts vital to her claim. In each\n  case, the District Court dismissed the FTCA claim for failure to satis-\n  fy \u00a72401(b)\u2019s time bars, holding that, despite any justification for de-\n  lay, those time bars are jurisdictional and not subject to equitable\n  tolling. The Ninth Circuit reversed in both cases, concluding that\n  \u00a72401(b)\u2019s time bars may be equitably tolled.\nHeld: Section 2401(b)\u2019s time limits are subject to equitable tolling.\n  Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, provides\n  the framework for deciding the applicability of equitable tolling to\n  statutes of limitations on suits against the Government. There, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 13\u20131075, United States v. June, Conservator, al-\nso on certiorari to the same court.\n2                UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court adopted a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d that such time bars may\n    be equitably tolled. Id., at 95. Irwin\u2019s presumption may, of course,\n    be rebutted. One way to do so\u2014pursued by the Government here\u2014is\n    to demonstrate that the statute of limitations at issue is jurisdiction-\n    al; if so, the statute cannot be equitably tolled. But this Court will\n    not conclude that a time bar is jurisdictional unless Congress pro-\n    vides a \u201cclear statement\u201d to that effect. Sebelius v. Auburn Regional\n    Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___, ___. And in applying that clear state-\n    ment rule, this Court has said that most time bars, even if mandato-\n    ry and emphatic, are nonjurisdictional. See id., at ___. Congress\n    thus must do something special to tag a statute of limitations as ju-\n    risdictional and so prohibit a court from tolling it. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Congress did no such thing in enacting \u00a72401(b). The text of\n    that provision speaks only to a claim\u2019s timeliness; it does not refer to\n    the jurisdiction of the district courts or address those courts\u2019 authori-\n    ty to hear untimely suits. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n    500, 515. Instead, it \u201creads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute\n    of limitations.\u201d Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631, 647. Statutory\n    context confirms that reading. Congress\u2019s separation of a filing dead-\n    line from a jurisdictional grant often indicates that the deadline is\n    not jurisdictional, and here the FTCA\u2019s jurisdictional grant appears\n    not in \u00a72401(b) but in another section of Title 28, \u00a71346(b)(1). That\n    jurisdictional grant is not expressly conditioned on compliance with\n    \u00a72401(b)\u2019s limitations periods. Finally, assuming it could provide the\n    clear statement that this Court\u2019s cases require, \u00a72401(b)\u2019s legislative\n    history does not clearly demonstrate that Congress intended the pro-\n    vision to impose a jurisdictional bar. Pp. 7\u20139.\n       (c) The Government\u2019s two principal arguments for treating\n    \u00a72401(b) as jurisdictional are unpersuasive and foreclosed by this\n    Court\u2019s precedents. Pp. 9\u201317.\n          (1) The Government first points out that \u00a72401(b) includes the\n    same \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d language as the statute of limitations\n    governing Tucker Act claims, which this Court has held to be juris-\n    dictional. See, e.g., Kendall v. United States, 107 U. S. 123, 125\u2013126.\n    But that phrase was a commonplace in statutes of limitations enact-\n    ed around the time of the FTCA, and it does not carry talismanic ju-\n    risdictional significance. Indeed, this Court has construed the same\n    language to be subject to tolling in the Clayton Act\u2019s statute of limita-\n    tions. See American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, 559.\n    And in two decisions addressing the Tucker Act\u2019s statute of limita-\n    tions, the Court has dismissed the idea that that language is jurisdic-\n    tionally significant. See Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95; John R. Sand &\n    Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 137, 139. The \u201cshall be\n    forever barred\u201d phrase is thus nothing more than an ordinary way to\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  set a statutory deadline. Pp. 9\u201314.\n       (2) The Government next argues that \u00a72401(b) is jurisdictional\n  because it is a condition on the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity.\n  But that argument is foreclosed by Irwin, which considered an identi-\n  cal objection but concluded that even time limits that condition a\n  waiver of immunity may be equitably tolled. See 498 U. S., at 95\u201396.\n  The Government\u2019s invocation of sovereign immunity principles is also\n  peculiarly inapt here. Unlike other waivers of sovereign immunity,\n  the FTCA treats the Government much like a private party, and the\n  Court has accordingly declined to construe the Act narrowly merely\n  because it waives the Government\u2019s immunity from suit. There is no\n  reason to do differently here. Pp. 14\u201317.\nNo. 13\u20131074, 732 F. 3d 1030, and No. 13\u20131075, 550 Fed.

S. C. \u00a72401(b). In each of\nthe two cases we resolve here, the claimant missed one of\nthose deadlines, but requested equitable tolling on the\nground that she had a good reason for filing late. The\nGovernment responded that \u00a72401(b)\u2019s time limits are not\nsubject to tolling because they are jurisdictional re-\nstrictions. Today, we reject the Government\u2019s argument\nand conclude that courts may toll both of the FTCA\u2019s\nlimitations periods.\n2           UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n   In the first case, respondent Kwai Fun Wong asserts\nthat the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)\nfalsely imprisoned her for five days in 1999. As the FTCA\nrequires, Wong first presented that claim to the INS within\ntwo years of the alleged unlawful action. See \u00a72401(b);\n\u00a72675(a). The INS denied the administrative complaint on\nDecember 3, 2001. Under the Act, that gave Wong six\nmonths, until June 3, 2002, to bring her tort claim in\nfederal court. See \u00a72401(b).\n   Several months prior to the INS\u2019s decision, Wong had\nfiled suit in federal district court asserting various non-\nFTCA claims against the Government arising out of the\nsame alleged misconduct. Anticipating the INS\u2019s ruling,\nWong moved in mid-November 2001 to amend the com-\nplaint in that suit by adding her tort claim. On April 5,\n2002, a Magistrate Judge recommended granting Wong\nleave to amend. But the District Court did not finally\nadopt that proposal until June 25\u2014three weeks after the\nFTCA\u2019s 6-month deadline.\n   The Government moved to dismiss the tort claim on the\nground that it was filed late. The District Court at first\nrejected the motion. It recognized that Wong had man-\naged to add her FTCA claim only after \u00a72401(b)\u2019s 6-month\ntime period had expired. But the court equitably tolled\nthat period for all the time between the Magistrate\nJudge\u2019s recommendation and its own order allowing\namendment, thus bringing Wong\u2019s FTCA claim within the\nstatutory deadline. Several years later, the Government\nmoved for reconsideration of that ruling based on an in-\ntervening Ninth Circuit decision. This time, the District\nCourt dismissed Wong\u2019s claim, reasoning that \u00a72401(b)\u2019s\n6-month time bar was jurisdictional and therefore not\nsubject to equitable tolling. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit\nagreed to hear the case en banc to address an intra-circuit\nconflict on the issue. The en banc court held that the 6-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmonth limit is not jurisdictional and that equitable tolling\nis available. Kwai Fun Wong v. Beebe, 732 F. 3d 1030\n(2013). It then confirmed the District Court\u2019s prior ruling\nthat the circumstances here justify tolling because Wong\n\u201cexercis[ed] due diligence\u201d in attempting to amend her\ncomplaint before the statutory deadline. Id., at 1052.\n   The second case before us arises from a deadly highway\naccident. Andrew Booth was killed in 2005 when a car in\nwhich he was riding crossed through a cable median bar-\nrier and crashed into oncoming traffic. The following year,\nrespondent Marlene June, acting on behalf of Booth\u2019s\nyoung son, filed a wrongful death action alleging that the\nState of Arizona and its contractor had negligently con-\nstructed and maintained the median barrier. Years into\nthat state-court litigation, June contends, she discovered\nthat the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) had\napproved installation of the barrier knowing it had not\nbeen properly crash tested.\n   Relying on that new information, June presented a tort\nclaim to the FHWA in 2010, more than five years after the\naccident. The FHWA denied the claim, and June promptly\nfiled this action in federal district court. The court dis-\nmissed the suit because June had failed to submit her\nclaim to the FHWA within two years of the collision. The\nFTCA\u2019s 2-year bar, the court ruled, is jurisdictional and\ntherefore not subject to equitable tolling; accordingly, the\ncourt did not consider June\u2019s contention that tolling was\nproper because the Government had concealed its failure\nto require crash testing. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit\nreversed in light of its recent decision in Wong, thus hold-\ning that \u00a72401(b)\u2019s 2-year deadline, like its 6-month coun-\nterpart, is not jurisdictional and may be tolled. 550 Fed.\nAppx. 505 (2013).\n   We granted certiorari in both cases, 573 U. S. ___\n(2014), to resolve a circuit split about whether courts may\nequitably toll \u00a72401(b)\u2019s two time limits. Compare, e.g., In\n4              UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nre FEMA Trailer Formaldehyde Prods. Liability Litiga-\ntion, 646 F. 3d 185, 190\u2013191 (CA5 2011) (per curiam)\n(tolling not available), with Arteaga v. United States, 711\nF. 3d 828, 832\u2013833 (CA7 2013) (tolling allowed).1 We now\naffirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 rulings.\n                              II\n   Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95\n(1990), sets out the framework for deciding \u201cthe applicabil-\nity of equitable tolling in suits against the Government.\u201d\nIn Irwin, we recognized that time bars in suits between\nprivate parties are presumptively subject to equitable\ntolling. See id., at 95\u201396. That means a court usually\nmay pause the running of a limitations statute in private\nlitigation when a party \u201chas pursued his rights diligently\nbut some extraordinary circumstance\u201d prevents him from\nmeeting a deadline. Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U. S.\n1, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7). We held in Irwin that \u201cthe\nsame rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling\u201d should\nalso apply to suits brought against the United States\nunder a statute waiving sovereign immunity. 498 U. S., at\n95\u201396. Our old \u201cad hoc,\u201d law-by-law approach to deter-\nmining the availability of tolling in those suits, we rea-\nsoned, had produced inconsistency and \u201cunpredictability\u201d\nwithout the offsetting virtue of enhanced \u201cfidelity to the\nintent of Congress.\u201d Id., at 95. Adopting the \u201cgeneral\nrule\u201d used in private litigation, we stated, would\n\u201camount[ ] to little, if any, broadening\u201d of a statutory\nwaiver of immunity. Ibid. Accordingly, we thought such a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although we did not consolidate these cases, we address them to-\n\ngether because everyone agrees that the core arguments for and\nagainst equitable tolling apply equally to both of \u00a72401(b)\u2019s deadlines.\nSee, e.g., Brief for United States in June 15 (\u201cNothing in the text or\nrelevant legislative history . . . suggests that the respective time bars\nshould be interpreted differently with respect to whether they are\njurisdictional or subject to equitable tolling\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npresumption \u201clikely to be a realistic assessment of legisla-\ntive intent as well as a practically useful\u201d rule of interpre-\ntation. Ibid.\n   A rebuttable presumption, of course, may be rebutted, so\nIrwin does not end the matter. When enacting a time bar\nfor a suit against the Government (as for one against a\nprivate party), Congress may reverse the usual rule if it\nchooses. See id., at 96. The Government may therefore\nattempt to establish, through evidence relating to a par-\nticular statute of limitations, that Congress opted to forbid\nequitable tolling.\n   One way to meet that burden\u2014and the way the Gov-\nernment pursues here\u2014is to show that Congress made the\ntime bar at issue jurisdictional.2 When that is so, a liti-\ngant\u2019s failure to comply with the bar deprives a court of all\nauthority to hear a case. Hence, a court must enforce the\nlimitation even if the other party has waived any timeli-\nness objection. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___\u2013\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 5\u20136). And, more crucially here, a\ncourt must do so even if equitable considerations would\nsupport extending the prescribed time period. See John R.\nSand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133\u2013\n134 (2008).3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Government notes, and we agree, that Congress may preclude\n\nequitable tolling of even a nonjurisdictional statute of limitations. See\nBrief for United States in Wong 20; Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medi-\ncal Center, 568 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2013) (slip op., at 6\u20138, 10\u201311) (find-\ning a nonjurisdictional time limit not amenable to tolling). And the\nGovernment contends in passing that even if \u00a72401(b) is nonjurisdic-\ntional, it prohibits equitable tolling. See Brief for United States in\nWong 20. But the Government makes no independent arguments in\nsupport of that position; instead, it relies (and even then implicitly) on\nthe same indicia of congressional intent that, in its view, show that\n\u00a72401(b)\u2019s time limits are jurisdictional. See infra, at 9\u201310, 14\u201315. In\naddressing the Government\u2019s predominant, jurisdictional claim, we\ntherefore also deal with its subsidiary one.\n   3 The dissent takes issue with the sequence in which we decide the\n6               UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Given those harsh consequences, the Government must\nclear a high bar to establish that a statute of limitations is\njurisdictional. In recent years, we have repeatedly held\nthat procedural rules, including time bars, cabin a court\u2019s\npower only if Congress has \u201cclearly state[d]\u201d as much.\nSebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (quoting Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp.,\n546 U. S. 500, 515 (2006)); see Gonzalez, 565 U. S., at ___\u2013\n___ (slip op., at 6\u20137). \u201c[A]bsent such a clear statement, . . .\n\u2018courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d\nAuburn Regional, 568 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 6\u20137)\n(quoting Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 516). That does not mean\n\u201cCongress must incant magic words.\u201d Auburn Regional,\n568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But traditional tools of\nstatutory construction must plainly show that Congress\nimbued a procedural bar with jurisdictional consequences.\n   And in applying that clear statement rule, we have\nmade plain that most time bars are nonjurisdictional.\nSee, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (noting the rarity of\njurisdictional time limits). Time and again, we have de-\nscribed filing deadlines as \u201cquintessential claim-processing\nrules,\u201d which \u201cseek to promote the orderly progress of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\njurisdictional question, contending that we must do so prior to mention-\ning Irwin\u2019s presumption. See post, at 11\u201312 (opinion of ALITO, J.). We\ndo not understand the point\u2014or more precisely, why the dissent thinks\nthe ordering matters. When Congress makes a time bar in a suit\nagainst the Government jurisdictional, one could say (as the dissent\ndoes) that Irwin does not apply, or one could say (as we do) that Irwin\u2019s\npresumption is conclusively rebutted. The bottom line is the same:\nTolling is not available. We frame the inquiry as we do in part because\nthat is how the Government presented the issue. See Brief for United\nStates in Wong 19 (\u201cOne way to show that [Irwin\u2019s presumption is\nrebutted] is to establish that the statutory time limit is a \u2018jurisdictional\u2019\nrestriction\u201d). And we think that choice makes especially good sense in\nthese cases because various aspects of Irwin\u2019s reasoning are central to\nconsidering the parties\u2019 positions on whether \u00a72401(b) is jurisdictional.\nSee infra, at 12\u201317.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

S. 428, 435 (2011);\nsee Auburn Regional, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8);\nScarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 413 (2004). That\nis so, contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, see post, at 4,\n10\u201311, even when the time limit is important (most are)\nand even when it is framed in mandatory terms (again,\nmost are); indeed, that is so \u201chowever emphatic[ally]\u201d\nexpressed those terms may be, Henderson, 562 U. S., at\n439 (quoting Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers,\n558 U. S. 67, 81 (2009)). Congress must do something\nspecial, beyond setting an exception-free deadline, to tag a\nstatute of limitations as jurisdictional and so prohibit a\ncourt from tolling it.\n    In enacting the FTCA, Congress did nothing of that\nkind. It provided no clear statement indicating that\n\u00a72401(b) is the rare statute of limitations that can deprive\na court of jurisdiction. Neither the text nor the context\nnor the legislative history indicates (much less does so\nplainly) that Congress meant to enact something other\nthan a standard time bar.\n   Most important, \u00a72401(b)\u2019s text speaks only to a claim\u2019s\ntimeliness, not to a court\u2019s power. It states that \u201c[a] tort\nclaim against the United States shall be forever barred\nunless it is presented [to the agency] within two years . . .\nor unless action is begun within six months\u201d of the agen-\ncy\u2019s denial of the claim. That is mundane statute-of-\nlimitations language, saying only what every time bar,\nby definition, must: that after a certain time a claim\nis barred. See infra, at 11, n. 7 (citing many similarly\nworded limitations statutes). The language is mandatory\u2014\n\u201cshall\u201d be barred\u2014but (as just noted) that is true of most\nsuch statutes, and we have consistently found it of no\nconsequence. See, e.g., Gonzalez, 565 U. S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 10\u201311). Too, the language might be viewed as\nemphatic\u2014\u201cforever\u201d barred\u2014but (again) we have often\n8              UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nheld that not to matter. See, e.g., Henderson, 562 U. S., at\n439; Union Pacific, 558 U. S., at 81. What matters instead\nis that \u00a72401(b) \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or\nrefer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u201d\nArbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515 (quoting Zipes v. Trans World\nAirlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)). It does not define\na federal court\u2019s jurisdiction over tort claims generally,\naddress its authority to hear untimely suits, or in any way\ncabin its usual equitable powers. Section 2401(b), in\nshort, \u201creads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of\nlimitations,\u201d spelling out a litigant\u2019s filing obligations\nwithout restricting a court\u2019s authority. Holland v. Flor-\nida, 560 U. S. 631, 647 (2010).4\n   Statutory context confirms that reading. This Court has\noften explained that Congress\u2019s separation of a filing\ndeadline from a jurisdictional grant indicates that the\ntime bar is not jurisdictional. See Henderson, 562 U. S., at\n439\u2013440; Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. 154,\n164\u2013165 (2010); Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515; Zipes, 455\nU. S., at 393\u2013394. So too here. Whereas \u00a72401(b) houses\nthe FTCA\u2019s time limitations, a different section of Title 28\nconfers power on federal district courts to hear FTCA\nclaims. See \u00a71346(b)(1) (\u201cdistrict courts . . . shall have\nexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over tort claims against the United\nStates). Nothing conditions the jurisdictional grant on the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The dissent argues that nonjurisdictional time limits typically men-\n\ntion claimants, whereas \u00a72401(b) does not. See post, at 10. But none of\nour precedents have either said or suggested that such a difference\nmatters\u2014that, for example, a statute barring a \u201ctort claim\u201d is jurisdic-\ntional, but one barring a \u201cperson\u2019s tort claim\u201d is not. See, e.g., Zipes,\n455 U. S., at 394, and n. 10 (concluding that a time limit did \u201cnot speak\nin jurisdictional terms\u201d even though it did not refer to a claimant).\nRather, in case after case, we have emphasized another distinction\u2014\nthat jurisdictional statutes speak about jurisdiction, or more generally\nphrased, about a court\u2019s powers. See Auburn Regional, 568 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 7); Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. 154, 160\u2013\n161 (2010); Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Treating \u00a72401(b)\u2019s time bars as jurisdictional\nwould thus disregard the structural divide built into the\nstatute.\n   Finally, even assuming legislative history alone could\nprovide a clear statement (which we doubt), none does so\nhere. The report accompanying the FTCA did not discuss\nwhether \u00a72401(b)\u2019s time limits are jurisdictional. See S.\nRep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946). And in\namending \u00a72401(b) four times after its enactment, Con-\ngress declined again (four times over) to say anything\nspecific about whether the statute of limitations imposes a\njurisdictional bar. Congress thus failed to provide any-\nthing like the clear statement this Court has demanded\nbefore deeming a statute of limitations to curtail a court\u2019s\npower.\n   And so we wind up back where we started, with Irwin\u2019s\n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d that equitable tolling is available in suits\nagainst the Government. 498 U. S., at 95. The justifica-\ntion the Government offers for departing from that princi-\nple fails: Section 2401(b) is not a jurisdictional require-\nment. The time limits in the FTCA are just time limits,\nnothing more. Even though they govern litigation against\nthe Government, a court can toll them on equitable\ngrounds.\n                           III\n  The Government balks at that straightforward analysis,\nclaiming that it overlooks two reasons for thinking\n\u00a72401(b) jurisdictional. But neither of those reasons is\npersuasive. Indeed, our precedents in this area foreclose\nthem both.\n                              A\n  The Government principally contends that \u00a72401(b) is\njurisdictional because it includes the same language as the\n10             UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute of limitations governing contract (and some other\nnon-tort) suits brought against the United States under\nthe Tucker Act. See \u00a72501.5 That statute long provided\nthat such suits \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d if not filed within\nsix years. Act of Mar. 3, 1863, \u00a710, 12 Stat. 767; see Act of\nMar. 3, 1911, \u00a7156, 36 Stat. 1139.6 And this Court repeat-\nedly held that 6-year limit to be jurisdictional and thus not\nsubject to equitable tolling. See Kendall v. United States,\n107 U. S. 123, 125\u2013126 (1883); Finn v. United States, 123\nU. S. 227, 232 (1887); Soriano v. United States, 352 U. S.\n270, 273\u2013274 (1957). When Congress drafted the FTCA\u2019s\ntime bar, it used the same \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d lan-\nguage (though selecting a shorter limitations period). \u201cIn\nthese circumstances,\u201d the Government maintains, \u201cthe\nonly reasonable conclusion is that Congress intended the\nFTCA\u2019s identically worded time limit to be a jurisdictional\nbar.\u201d Brief for United States in Wong 21\u201322. According to\nthe Government, Congress wanted the FTCA to serve as\n\u201ca tort-law analogue to the Tucker Act\u201d and incorporated\nthe words \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d to similarly preclude\nequitable tolling. Reply Brief in Wong 4. (The dissent\nrelies heavily on the same argument. See post, at 4\u20138.)\n  But the Government takes too much from Congress\u2019s\nuse in \u00a72401(b) of an utterly unremarkable phrase. The\n\u201cshall be forever barred\u201d formulation was a commonplace\nin federal limitations statutes for many decades surround-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Tucker Act of 1887, ch. 359, 24 Stat. 505, enlarged the Court of\n\nClaims\u2019 jurisdiction over contract and other non-tort actions against the\nGovernment. The statute of limitations applying to such suits pre-\ndated the Tucker Act by more than two decades.\n  6 During a recodification occurring in 1948 (two years after passage of\n\nthe FTCA), Congress omitted the word \u201cforever\u201d from the Tucker Act\u2019s\nstatute of limitations; since then, it has provided simply that untimely\nclaims \u201cshall be barred.\u201d 28 U.

C. \u00a75412(b)\n(1976 ed.).\n   8 Even before this Court\u2019s decision in American Pipe, Courts of Ap-\n\npeals had unanimously construed the Clayton Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions to allow equitable tolling. See General Elec. Co. v. San Antonio,\n334 F. 2d 480, 484\u2013485 (CA5 1964) (joining six other Circuits in reach-\ning that conclusion). Similarly, every Court of Appeals to have consid-\nered the issue has found that \u00a76 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, which\ncontains the same \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d phrase, permits hearing\nlate claims. See, e.g., Hodgson v. Humphries, 454 F. 2d 1279, 1283\u2013\n1284 (CA10 1972); Ott v. Midland-Ross Corp., 523 F. 2d 1367, 1370\n(CA6 1975); Partlow v. Jewish Orphans\u2019 Home of Southern Cal., Inc.,\n645 F. 2d 757, 760\u2013761 (CA9 1981), abrogated on other grounds by\nHoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U. S. 165 (1989). And so too\nCourts of Appeals unanimously found that the ADEA\u2019s longtime\n(though not current) time bar containing that language was subject to\ntolling. See, e.g., Vance v. Whirlpool Corp., 707 F. 2d 483, 489 (CA4\n12            UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nacknowledged, referring to the \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d\nlocution: \u201c[T]hat type of language has more to do with the\nlegal rhetoric at the time the statute was passed\u201d than\nwith anything else, and should not \u201cmake[ ] a difference\u201d\nto the jurisdictional analysis. Tr. of Oral Arg. in Irwin,\nO. T. 1990, No. 89\u20135867, p. 30. Or, put just a bit differ-\nently: Congress\u2019s inclusion of a phrase endemic to limita-\ntions statutes of that era, at least some of which allow\ntolling, cannot provide the requisite clear statement that a\ntime bar curtails a court\u2019s authority.\n   Indeed, in two decisions directly addressing the Tucker\nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, this Court dismissed the idea\nthat the language the Government relies on here has\njurisdictional significance. Twice we described the words\nin that provision as not meaningfully different from those\nin a nonjurisdictional statute of limitations. And twice we\nmade clear that the jurisdictional status of the Tucker\nAct\u2019s time bar has precious little to do with its phrasing.\n   We first did so in Irwin. Using our newly minted pre-\nsumption, see supra, at 4\u20135, we decided there that the\nlimitations period governing Title VII suits against the\nGovernment, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u201316(c) (1988 ed.), allowed\nequitable tolling. In reaching that conclusion, we com-\npared \u00a72000e\u201316(c)\u2019s text (then stating that an employee\n\u201cmay file a civil action\u201d within 30 days of an agency\u2019s\ndenial of her claim) with the language of the Tucker Act\u2019s\ntime bar. We noted that we had formerly held the Tucker\nAct\u2019s limitations statute to \u201cjurisdictionally bar[ ]\u201d late\nclaims, and we acknowledged the possibility of justifying\nthat different treatment by characterizing its \u201clanguage\n[as] more stringent than\u201d \u00a72000e\u201316(c)\u2019s. Irwin, 498 U. S.,\nat 94\u201395. But we rejected that reasoning, instead finding\nthat the two formulations were materially alike. \u201c[W]e are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1983); Callowhill v.

Leaving for another day the question of what\ndid account for the jurisdictional status of the Tucker Act\u2019s\ntime bar, the Court thus ruled out reliance on its lan-\nguage. In other words, on the core question the Govern-\nment raises here\u2014whether the phrase \u201cshall be forever\nbarred,\u201d as used in both the Tucker Act and the FTCA,\nmanifests a congressional decision to preclude tolling\u2014\nIrwin said no.\n   More recently, John R. Sand reaffirmed that conclusion,\neven as it refused to overturn our century-old view that\nthe Tucker Act\u2019s time bar is jurisdictional. No less than\nthree times, John R. Sand approvingly repeated Irwin\u2019s\nstatement that the textual differences between the Tucker\nAct\u2019s time bar and \u00a72000e\u201316(c) were insignificant\u2014i.e.,\nthat the language of the two provisions could not explain\nwhy the former was jurisdictional and the latter not. See\n552 U. S., at 137, 139 (calling the provisions \u201clinguistically\nsimilar,\u201d \u201csimilar . . . in language,\u201d and \u201csimilarly worded\u201d).\nBut if that were so, John R. Sand asked, why not hold\nthat the Tucker Act\u2019s time limit, like \u00a72000e\u201316(c), is\nnonjurisdictional? The answer came down to two words:\nstare decisis. The Tucker Act\u2019s bar was different because\nit had been the subject of \u201ca definitive earlier interpreta-\ntion.\u201d Id., at 138; see id., at 137; supra, at 10. And for\nthat reason alone, John R. Sand left in place our prior\nconstruction of the Tucker Act\u2019s time limit. See 552 U. S.,\nat 139 (observing, in Justice Brandeis\u2019s words, that \u201cit is\nmore important that\u201d the rule \u201cbe settled than that it be\nsettled right\u201d (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.,\n285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (dissenting opinion))). What is\nspecial about the Tucker Act\u2019s deadline, John R. Sand\nrecognized, comes merely from this Court\u2019s prior rulings,\nnot from Congress\u2019s choice of wording.\n14           UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government thus cannot show that the phrase\n\u201cshall be forever barred\u201d in \u00a72401(b) plainly signifies a\njurisdictional statute, as our decisions require. See supra,\nat 6\u20137. Unlike in John R. Sand, here stare decisis plays\nno role: We have not previously considered whether\n\u00a72401(b) restricts a court\u2019s authority. What we have done\nis to say, again and again, that the core language in that\nprovision has no jurisdictional significance. It is materi-\nally indistinguishable from the language in one nonjurisdic-\ntional time bar (i.e., \u00a72000e\u201316(c)). See Irwin, 498 U. S.,\nat 95; John R. Sand, 552 U. S., at 137, 139. And it is\nidentical to the language in another (i.e., 15 U. S. C. \u00a715b).\nSee American Pipe, 414 U. S., at 559. Yes, we have held\nthat the Tucker Act\u2019s time bar, which includes those same\nwords, constrains a court\u2019s power to hear late claims. But\nas we explained in Irwin, that is not because the phrase\nitself \u201cmanifest[s] a . . . congressional intent with respect\nto the availability of equitable tolling.\u201d 498 U. S., at 95.\nThe words on which the Government pins its hopes are\njust the words of a limitations statute of a particular era.\nAnd nothing else supports the Government\u2019s claim that\nCongress, when enacting the FTCA, wanted to incorporate\nthis Court\u2019s view of the Tucker Act\u2019s time bar\u2014much less\nthat Congress expressed that purported intent with the\nneeded clear statement.\n                            B\n   The Government next contends that at the time of the\nFTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress thought that every limita-\ntions statute applying to suits against the United States,\nhowever framed or worded, cut off a court\u2019s jurisdiction\nover untimely claims. On that view, the particular lan-\nguage of those statutes makes no difference. All that\nmatters is that such time limits function as conditions on\nthe Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. In that\nera\u2014indeed, up until Irwin was decided\u2014those conditions\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwere generally supposed to be \u201cstrictly observed.\u201d So-\nriano, 352 U. S., at 276. That meant, the Government\nurges, that all time limits on actions against the United\nStates \u201ccarr[ied] jurisdictional consequences.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States in Wong 34. Accordingly, the Government\nconcludes, Congress \u201cwould have expected courts to apply\n[\u00a72401(b)] as a jurisdictional requirement\u2014just as condi-\ntions on waivers of sovereign immunity had always been\napplied.\u201d Id., at 32.\n   Irwin, however, forecloses that argument. After all,\nIrwin also considered a pre-Irwin time bar attached to a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. The Government argued\nthere\u2014anticipating its claim here\u2014that because \u00a72000e\u2013\n16(c)\u2019s statute of limitations conditioned such a waiver, it\nmust be jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling.\nSee Brief for Respondents 6, 10, 14, 19, and Tr. of Oral\nArg. 31\u201337, in Irwin, O. T. 1990, No. 89\u20135867. But Irwin\ndisagreed, applying the opposite presumption to a time\nlimit passed two decades earlier. See 498 U. S., at 94\u201396;\nsupra, at 4\u20135. Justice White protested, much as the Gov-\nernment does now, that at the time of \u00a72000e\u201316(c)\u2019s\nenactment, limitations statutes for suits against the Gov-\nernment were \u201cstrictly observed\u201d and not amenable to\ntolling. 498 U. S., at 97 (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (quoting Soriano, 352 U. S., at\n276); see 498 U. S., at 99, n. 2. How could an earlier Con-\ngress, Justice White asked, have \u201chad in mind the Court\u2019s\npresent departure from that longstanding rule\u201d? Ibid.; see\npost, at 9 (asking a variant of the same question). But the\nIrwin Court was undeterred. The Court noted that it had\nnot applied the former rule so consistently as Justice\nWhite suggested. See 498 U. S., at 94. And the Court\ndoubted that the former approach so well reflected con-\ngressional intent: On the contrary, because equitable\ntolling \u201camounts to little, if any, broadening of the con-\ngressional waiver,\u201d we thought that a rule generally allow-\n16           UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning tolling is the more \u201crealistic assessment of legislative\nintent.\u201d Id., at 95; see supra, at 4\u20135. For those reasons,\nthe Court declined to count time bars as jurisdictional\nmerely because they condition waivers of immunity\u2014even\nif Congress enacted the deadline when the Court inter-\npreted limitations statutes differently.\n   In the years since, this Court has repeatedly followed\nIrwin\u2019s lead. We have applied Irwin to pre-Irwin statutes,\njust as we have to statutes that followed in that decision\u2019s\nwake. See Scarborough, 541 U. S., at 420\u2013422; Franconia\nAssociates v. United States, 536 U. S. 129, 145 (2002). To\nbe sure, Irwin\u2019s presumption is rebuttable. But the rebut-\ntal cannot rely on what Irwin itself deemed irrelevant\u2014\nthat Congress passed the statute in an earlier era, when\nthis Court often attached jurisdictional consequence to\nconditions on waivers of sovereign immunity. Rather, the\nrebuttal must identify something distinctive about the\ntime limit at issue, whether enacted then or later\u2014a\nreason for thinking Congress wanted that limitations\nstatute (not all statutes passed in an earlier day) to curtail\na court\u2019s jurisdiction. On the Government\u2019s contrary view,\nIrwin would effectively become only a prospective decision.\nNothing could be less consonant with Irwin\u2019s ambition to\nadopt a \u201cgeneral rule to govern the applicability of equit-\nable tolling in suits against the Government.\u201d 498 U. S.,\nat 95.\n   And the Government\u2019s claim is peculiarly inapt as ap-\nplied to \u00a72401(b) because all that is special about the\nFTCA cuts in favor of allowing equitable tolling. As com-\npared to other waivers of immunity (prominently includ-\ning the Tucker Act), the FTCA treats the United States\nmore like a commoner than like the Crown. The FTCA\u2019s\njurisdictional provision states that courts may hear suits\n\u201cunder circumstances where the United States, if a private\nperson, would be liable to the claimant.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71346(b). And when defining substantive liability for\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntorts, the Act reiterates that the United States is account-\nable \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a\nprivate individual.\u201d \u00a72674. In keeping with those provi-\nsions, this Court has often rejected the Government\u2019s calls\nto cabin the FTCA on the ground that it waives sovereign\nimmunity\u2014and indeed, the Court did so in the years\nimmediately after the Act\u2019s passage, even as it was con-\nstruing other waivers of immunity narrowly. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 338 U. S.\n366, 383 (1949); Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350\nU. S. 61, 65 (1955); Rayonier Inc. v. United States, 352\nU. S. 315, 319\u2013320 (1957). There is no reason to do differ-\nently here. As Irwin recognized, treating the Government\nlike a private person means (among other things) permit-\nting equitable tolling. See 498 U. S., at 95\u201396. So in\nstressing the Government\u2019s equivalence to a private party,\nthe FTCA goes further than the typical statute waiving\nsovereign immunity to indicate that its time bar allows a\ncourt to hear late claims.\n                             IV\n  Our precedents make this a clear-cut case. Irwin re-\nquires an affirmative indication from Congress that it\nintends to preclude equitable tolling in a suit against the\nGovernment. See 498 U. S., at 95\u201396. Congress can\nprovide that signal by making a statute of limitations\njurisdictional. But that requires its own plain statement;\notherwise, we treat a time bar as a mere claims-processing\nrule. See Auburn Regional, 568 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op.,\nat 6, 8). Congress has supplied no such statement here.\nAs this Court has repeatedly stated, nothing about\n\u00a72401(b)\u2019s core language is special; \u201cshall be forever\nbarred\u201d is an ordinary (albeit old-fashioned) way of setting\na deadline, which does not preclude tolling when circum-\nstances warrant. See Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95\u201396; John R.\nSand, 552 U. S., at 137, 139; American Pipe, 414 U. S., at\n18          UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n558\u2013559. And it makes no difference that a time bar\nconditions a waiver of sovereign immunity, even if Con-\ngress enacted the measure when different interpretive\nconventions applied; that is the very point of this Court\u2019s\ndecision to treat time bars in suits against the Govern-\nment, whenever passed, the same as in litigation between\nprivate parties. See Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95\u201396; Scar-\nborough, 541 U. S., at 420\u2013422; Franconia, 536 U. S., at\n145. Accordingly, we hold that the FTCA\u2019s time bars are\nnonjurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling.\n  We affirm the judgments of the U. S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit and remand the cases for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand in\nJune, it is for the District Court to decide whether, on the\nfacts of her case, June is entitled to equitable tolling.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

The FTCA waives the immunity of the United\nStates for certain tort claims but provides that any \u201ctort\nclaim against the United States shall be forever barred\nunless\u201d it is filed with the appropriate agency \u201cwithin\ntwo years after such claim accrues\u201d and in federal court\n\u201cwithin six months after\u201d the agency\u2019s final decision. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72401(b). The statutory text, its historical roots,\nand more than a century of precedents show that this\nabsolute bar is not subject to equitable tolling. I would\nenforce the statute as Congress intended and reverse.\n                            I\n  The FTCA is a waiver of sovereign immunity and must\nbe understood in that context. In the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies, Congress was reluctant to allow individual tort\n2           UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nclaims against the United States. Instead, it granted\nrelief to individuals through private laws enacted solely\nfor those individuals\u2019 benefit. These waivers of sovereign\nimmunity were surgical and sporadic, but \u201cnotoriously\nclumsy,\u201d and by 1946 Congress thought it better to adopt a\n\u201csimplified\u201d approach. Dalehite v. United States, 346 U. S.\n15, 24\u201325 (1953). The FTCA thus waived sovereign im-\nmunity for tort claims against the Government and set out\na procedure for adjudicating those claims.\n   This waiver of sovereign immunity was no trivial mat-\nter. Long before the FTCA, Congress authorized suits\nagainst the Government for contract and property claims\nunder the Tucker Act and a number of predecessor stat-\nutes, but the Tucker Act excluded tort claims from its\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. The concern was obvious:\nAs opposed to the more predictable nature of contractual\nand property claims, tort-based harms are sometimes\nunperceived and open-ended. Even frivolous claims re-\nquire the Federal Government to expend administrative\nand litigation costs, which ultimately fall upon society at-\nlarge. For every dollar spent to defend against or to sat-\nisfy a tort claim against the United States, the Government\nmust either raise taxes or shift funds originally allocated\nto different public programs.\n   To reduce these risks, Congress placed strict limits on\nthe FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. The statute\n\u201cexempts from [its] waiver certain categories of claims,\u201d\nAli v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 218 (2008),\nand includes a broad exemption for claims \u201carising out of\nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, mali-\ncious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrep-\nresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.\u201d\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(h); see also \u00a7\u00a72680(a)\u2013(n). In addition,\nin order to limit the scope and unpredictability of the\nGovernment\u2019s potential liability, the Act exempts from the\nwaiver of sovereign immunity certain types of recovery,\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

See\n\u00a72674.\n  Most relevant here, the FTCA \u201ccondition[s]\u201d its waiver\nof sovereign immunity on strict filing deadlines. United\nStates v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 117 (1979). As enacted in\n1946, the Act granted district courts exclusive jurisdiction\nover tort claims against the Government, \u201c[s]ubject to the\n[other] provisions of \u201d the Act. FTCA, ch. 753, \u00a7410(a), 60\nStat. 843\u2013844. One of those provisions stated that \u201c[e]very\nclaim against the United States cognizable under this title\nshall be forever barred, unless within one year after such\nclaim accrued . . . it is presented in writing to the [rele-\nvant] Federal agency . . . or . . . an action is begun\u201d in\nfederal court. \u00a7420, id., at 845. The current version pro-\nvides in full as follows:\n      \u201cA tort claim against the United States shall be for-\n    ever barred unless it is presented in writing to the\n    appropriate Federal agency within two years after\n    such claim accrues or unless action is begun within\n    six months after the date of mailing, by certified or\n    registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by\n    the agency to which it was presented.\u201d 28 U.

Both of these inquiries\nrequire close attention to the text, context, and history of\nthe Act. And both lead to the conclusion that the FTCA\nallows no equitable tolling.\n4            UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\n                               A\n\n   The FTCA\u2019s filing deadlines are jurisdictional. The\nstatute\u2019s plain text prohibits adjudication of untimely\nclaims. Once the Act\u2019s filing deadlines have run, all un-\ntimely claims \u201cshall be forever barred.\u201d Ibid. These words\nare not qualified or aspirational. They are absolute. If not\nfiled with the agency within two years, or with a federal\ncourt within six months, a claim \u201cshall be\u201d \u201cbarred\u201d \u201cfor-\never.\u201d \u201cShall be forever barred\u201d is not generally understood\nto mean \u201cshould be allowed sometimes.\u201d The statute\nbrooks no exceptions. And because the filing deadlines\nrestrict the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, they\nimpose a limit on the courts\u2019 jurisdiction that \u201cwe should\nnot take it upon ourselves to extend.\u201d Kubrick, supra, at\n117\u2013118.\n   For over 130 years, we have understood these terms as\njurisdictional. When crafting the FTCA\u2019s limitations\nprovision, Congress did not write on a clean slate. Rather,\nit borrowed language from limitations provisions in the\nTucker Act and its predecessor statutes. The 1911 version\nof the Tucker Act included language that was nearly\nidentical to that in the 1946 version of the FTCA: \u201cEvery\nclaim against the United States cognizable by the Court of\nClaims, shall be forever barred unless the petition setting\nforth a statement thereof is filed in the court . . . within six\nyears after the claim first accrues.\u201d \u00a7156, 36 Stat. 1139.\nThat statutory language came, in turn, from the 1863\npredecessor to the Tucker Act. See \u00a710, 12 Stat. 767.\n   As early as 1883, we interpreted these precise terms to\nimpose a \u201cjurisdiction[al]\u201d requirement that the \u201ccourt\nmay not disregard.\u201d Kendall v. United States, 107 U. S.\n123, 125. We emphasized that, when waiving sovereign\nimmunity, Congress \u201cmay restrict the jurisdiction of the\n[courts] to certain classes of demands.\u201d Ibid. And we held\nthat \u201c[t]he express words of the statute leave no room for\ncontention.\u201d Ibid. The Court thus had no \u201cauthority to\n                       Cite as: 575 U.

Ibid.\n   Over the ensuing decades, we repeatedly reaffirmed our\ninterpretation of the phrase. In Finn v. United States, 123\nU. S. 227, 232 (1887), we held that the Government could\nnot waive the jurisdictional time bar and thus that the\n\u201cduty of the court\u201d was \u201cto dismiss the petition\u201d when a\nplaintiff raised an untimely claim. We reached the same\nconclusion in De Arnaud v. United States, 151 U. S. 483,\n495\u2013496 (1894). We reaffirmed the rule in United States\nv. New York, 160 U. S. 598, 616\u2013619 (1896), while holding\nthat there was jurisdiction where the plaintiff presented\nits claim before the statutory deadline. And in Munro v.\nUnited States, 303 U. S. 36, 38, n. 1, 41 (1938), we held\nthat a District Court lacked jurisdiction to resolve un-\ntimely claims, even if the Government waived any objection,\nunder a different statute that incorporated the Tucker\nAct\u2019s time limits. All the while, the lower courts similarly\nenforced the deadline as \u201ca jurisdictional requirement,\ncompliance with which is necessary to enable suit to be\nmaintained against the sovereign.\u201d Compagnie Generale\nTransatlantique v. United States, 51 F. 2d 1053, 1056\n(CA2 1931). Thus, by 1946, the phrase \u201cshall be forever\nbarred\u201d was well understood to deprive federal courts of\njurisdiction over untimely claims.1\n   The FTCA\u2019s statutory terms must be understood in this\ncontext. When Congress crafted the FTCA as a tort-based\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 At times in the past we have too loosely conferred the \u201cjurisdic-\n\ntional\u201d label. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S.\n83, 90 (1998). But our use of the term in this context was conscious, as we\nrecognized in John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S.\n130, 134 (2008) (\u201cJustice Harlan, writing for the Court, said the statute\nwas \u2018jurisdiction[al],\u2019 . . . and that \u2018it [was] the duty of the court to raise\nthe [timeliness] question whether it [was] done by plea or not\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nKendall v.

L. Rev.\n527, 537 (1947))).\n   Indeed, Congress considered departing from the Tucker\nAct\u2019s prohibition on equitable tolling, but decided against\nit. Proposals to include an equitable tolling provision were\n\u201cincluded in nine of the thirty-one bills prior to the enact-\nment of the FTCA,\u201d but \u201cthe Act passed by the 1946 Con-\ngress did not provide for any equitable tolling of the limi-\ntations periods.\u201d Colella & Bain, Revisiting Equitable\nTolling and the Federal Tort Claims Act, 31 Seton Hall\nL. Rev. 174, 195\u2013196 (2000). Instead, it was understood\nthat individuals with claims outside those deadlines could\nturn to Congress for relief through private bills, as they\ndid before the FTCA\u2019s enactment. See id., at 195.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Congress has occasionally modified the FTCA\u2019s limitations provi-\nsion. Initially, the Act required plaintiffs to file suit within one year of\na claim\u2019s accrual, or if the claim was for less than $1,000 to present the\nclaim to the appropriate agency within one year of accrual. FTCA \u00a7420,\n60 Stat. 845. In 1949, to relieve the hardship of the 1-year deadline,\nCongress enlarged the filing deadline to two years. Act of Apr. 25, ch.\n92, \u00a71, 63 Stat. 62. Then, in 1966, it made the filing of an administra-\ntive claim with the appropriate agency a prerequisite to filing suit, and\nit shortened the litigation filing deadline to six months from the agen-\ncy\u2019s denial of the claim. Act of July 18, \u00a7\u00a72(a), 7, 80 Stat. 306, 307. But\nCongress has never suggested that the deadlines could be excused or\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

In Soriano v.\nUnited States, 352 U. S. 270 (1957), we rejected a request\nto allow equitable tolling under the Tucker Act. Confirm-\ning the connection between the Tucker Act and the FTCA,\nwe noted that \u201cstatutes permitting suits for tax refunds,\ntort actions, alien property litigation, patent cases, and\nother claims against the Government would be affected\u201d if\nthe Court allowed equitable tolling under the Tucker Act.\nId., at 275 (emphasis added). And in Kubrick, 444 U. S.,\nat 117\u2013118, we cited Soriano\u2019s warning while emphasizing\nthat the FTCA\u2019s time limits are a condition of the Act\u2019s\nwaiver of sovereign immunity.\n   The lower courts also quickly recognized the statutes\u2019\ncommon heritage and enforced \u00a72401(b) as a jurisdictional\nrequirement. In Anderegg v. United States, 171 F. 2d 127,\n128 (1948) (per curiam), the Fourth Circuit cited Finn and\nMunro while holding that the FTCA\u2019s filing deadline is a\njurisdictional limit that the Government cannot waive.\nThe Fifth Circuit, in Simon v. United States, 244 F. 2d\n703, 705, n. 4 (1957), held that the FTCA\u2019s deadline is a\njurisdictional condition on the Act\u2019s waiver of sovereign\nimmunity and cited Carpenter v. United States, 56 F. 2d\n828, 829 (CA2 1932), a Tucker Act case, to support its\nholding. And in Humphreys v. United States, 272 F. 2d\n411 (1959), the Ninth Circuit similarly relied on Tucker\nAct precedents to hold that \u201cthe District Court has no\njurisdiction over [an untimely FTCA] action,\u201d because no\nwaiver of sovereign immunity exists once the filing dead-\nline \u201chas run.\u201d Id., at 412 (citing Edwards v. United\nStates, 163 F. 2d 268, 269 (CA9 1947), in turn citing Finn\nand Munro). When Congress amended the FTCA in 1966,\nit readopted the \u201cforever barred\u201d language against the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nenlarged by the courts. \n\n8            UNITED STATES v.

S. 581, 593\u2013594 (2004).\n    That meaning, of course, cannot change over time. But\neven if there were any doubt, we recently reaffirmed our\nview in John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552\nU. S. 130 (2008). We explained that, unlike run-of-the-\nmill statutes of limitation, jurisdictional time limits \u201cseek\n. . . to achieve a broader system-related goal, such as\nfacilitating the administration of claims, limiting the scope\nof a governmental waiver of sovereign immunity, or pro-\nmoting judicial efficiency.\u201d Id., at 133 (citations omitted).\nRecounting our decisions in Kendall, Finn, De Arnaud,\nNew York, and Soriano, we \u201creiterated\u201d our understanding\nof the \u201cabsolute nature of the court of claims limitations\nstatute.\u201d 552 U. S., at 135. And we rejected an invitation\nto abandon that interpretation, noting that Congress has\nlong accepted our interpretation of the statute. Id., at 139.\n    The same must be said of the FTCA. As we have often\nexplained, \u201c[w]hen a long line of this Court\u2019s decisions left\nundisturbed by Congress has treated a similar require-\nment as \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019 we will presume that Congress\nintended to follow that course.\u201d Henderson v. Shinseki,\n562 U. S. 428, 436 (2011) (citation and some internal\nquotation marks omitted); Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,\n559 U. S. 154, 168 (2010); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomo-\ntive Engineers, 558 U. S. 67, 82 (2009). Every single deci-\nsion from this Court interpreting the Tucker Act\u2019s \u201csimilar\nrequirement\u201d has treated it as jurisdictional. And there is\nstrong historical evidence that Congress \u201cintended to\nfollow that course.\u201d That should be the end of the matter:\nSection 2410(b)\u2019s filing deadlines are jurisdictional limits\nthat are not subject to equitable tolling.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\n                              B\n\n   Even if the FTCA\u2019s filing deadlines are not jurisdic-\ntional, they still prohibit equitable tolling. To be sure, in\nrecent years, we have grown reluctant to affix the \u201cjuris-\ndictional\u201d label. See, e.g., Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500, 510 (2006); Henderson, supra, at 434\u2013436. \u201cBut\ncalling a rule nonjurisdictional does not mean that it is not\nmandatory.\u201d Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n(slip op., at 10). Where Congress imposes an inflexible\nclaims processing rule, it is our duty to enforce the law\nand prohibit equitable tolling, whether it is jurisdictional\nor not.\n   Here, Congress\u2019 intent is clear. The words of the statute\nleave no doubt that untimely claims are never allowed:\nThey are \u201cforever barred.\u201d This is no weak-kneed com-\nmand. The history underlying the text only bolsters its\napparent meaning, and our repeated reaffirmation of the\nphrase\u2019s meaning should remove any doubt. Congress\nnever meant for equitable tolling to be available under the\nFTCA.\n   The only factor pointing in the opposite direction is our\nsuggestion in Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498\nU. S. 89, 95\u201396 (1990), that we would thenceforth apply a\nrebuttable presumption in favor of equitable tolling in\nsuits against the Government. But it is beyond me how\nIrwin\u2019s judge-made presumption announced in 1990 can\ntrump the obvious meaning of a statute enacted many\ndecades earlier. Cf. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441\nU. S. 677, 718 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., concurring). In any\nevent, Irwin\u2019s rebuttable presumption is overcome in this\ncase. For well over a century, we have recognized the\ninflexible nature of the Tucker Act\u2019s provision. Since its\nadoption, we have recognized that the FTCA\u2019s language\nbears the same meaning as its Tucker Act companion. See\nSoriano, supra, at 275; Kubrick, supra, at 118. And in\nJohn R. Sand & Gravel, we held that our \u201cdefinitive ear-\n10           UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlier interpretation of the\u201d Tucker Act is a \u201csufficient rebut-\ntal\u201d to Irwin\u2019s presumption. 552 U. S., at 138. There is no\nprincipled way to distinguish this case. Section 2401(b)\nallows no equitable tolling.\n                              III\n   The Court\u2019s contrary conclusion is wrong at every step.\nIn its view, \u00a72401(b)\u2019s statutory text is \u201cmundane\u201d lan-\nguage that \u201c \u2018reads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute\nof limitations.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8. But \u201cordinary\u201d nonjurisdic-\ntional time limits are typically directed at claimants. The\ndeadline in Henderson, for example, required that \u201ca\nperson adversely affected by [a Board of Veterans\u2019 Ap-\npeals] decision shall file a notice of appeal . . . within 120\ndays after\u201d the decision. 38 U. S. C. \u00a77266(a) (emphasis\nadded); 562 U. S, at 438. The \u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d limitations\nprovision in Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631, 647 (2010),\nlikewise applied to the \u201cperson\u201d responsible for filing: \u201cA\n1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to\nthe judgment of a State court.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)\n(emphasis added); 560 U. S., at 635. And the provision at\nissue in Irwin was similar, if not an even weaker com-\nmand. It provided that \u201c \u2018[w]ithin thirty days of receipt of\nnotice of final action taken by . . . the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission . . . an employee or applicant for\nemployment . . . may file a civil action.\u2019 \u201d 498 U. S., at 94\n(quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u201316(c) (1998 ed.); emphasis\nadded).\n   Section 2401(b), by contrast, never mentions the claim-\nant, and it is phrased in emphatically absolute terms. It\nsays unequivocally that untimely tort claims against the\nUnited States \u201cshall be forever barred.\u201d Although it does\nnot use the word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d it speaks at least as much\nto the courts (who are \u201cforever barred\u201d from considering\nuntimely claims) as it does to claimants (who are \u201cforever\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   11\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbarred\u201d from bringing stale claims). More important,\nthough, the words in \u00a72401(b) have a well-known meaning\nthat ipse dixit labels cannot overcome.3\n   The majority tells us this \u201cold \u2018ad hoc,\u2019 law-by-law ap-\nproach\u201d\u2014also known as statutory interpretation\u2014has been\nreplaced with a broad presumption in favor of equitable\ntolling and a judicial preference against jurisdictional\nlabels. Ante, at 4. I dispute the premise. But in any\nevent, as I explained above, and as six Members of the\ncurrent Court held in John R. Sand & Gravel, the over-\nwhelming evidence of congressional intent here easily\novertakes Irwin\u2019s rebuttable presumption. Even if we\nwould rather not call \u00a72401(b)\u2019s deadlines \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d\nwith all that label entails, we must nonetheless recognize\nthat Congress never meant to allow equitable tolling.\n   The majority avoids this latter point by declining to give\nit any separate attention. See ante, at 5, n. 2. But we\ncannot conflate the two questions because, though the\nrelevant evidence is the same, the analysis is different. In\nparticular, the majority is wrong to rely on Irwin when\nassessing the jurisdictional question, which is the only\nquestion it really decides. We do not indulge Irwin\u2019s pre-\nsumption when determining whether a requirement is\njurisdictional. Instead, we typically invoke Irwin only\nafter finding that a requirement is not jurisdictional, to\ndecide whether Congress nonetheless intended to prohibit\nequitable tolling. In Henderson, for instance, we never\nmentioned Irwin because the parties did not ask us to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  majority relies on the fact that we have allowed equitable toll-\ning under \u201cforever barred\u201d language in the Clayton Act. See ante, at 10.\nBut there is no evidence that Congress meant to import that statute\u2019s\nterms into the FTCA. Nor does the Clayton Act involve the waiver of\nsovereign immunity for money damages against the Government. The\nTucker Act, by contrast, was clearly the blueprint for the FTCA\u2019s time\nbar, it did involve a waiver of sovereign immunity, and our cases have\nuniformly held that its language is not subject to equitable tolling.\n12             UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\naddress whether the rule was \u201csubject to equitable tolling\nif it [was] not jurisdictional.\u201d 562 U. S., at 442, n. 4.\nLikewise, in Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007), we\nheld that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is juris-\ndictional, without a word about Irwin.4 In Sebelius v.\nAuburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___,\n___\u2013___, (2013) (slip op., at 6\u20137, 11\u201313), we considered\nIrwin only after deciding that a deadline was not jurisdic-\ntional. And in Holland, we held that the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\u2019s time limits are\nnot jurisdictional, without relying on Irwin, and then\nstated that \u201c[w]e have previously made clear that a nonju-\nrisdictional federal statute of limitations is normally\nsubject to a \u2018rebuttable presumption\u2019 in favor \u2018of equitable\ntolling.\u2019 \u201d 560 U. S., at 645\u2013646 (quoting Irwin, supra, at\n95\u201396) (emphasis deleted); cf. Young v. United States, 535\nU. S. 43, 49\u201350 (2002) (invoking Irwin after concluding\nthat a limitations period was not a \u201csubstantive\u201d compo-\nnent of the Bankruptcy Code).5 This error matters be-\ncause the majority\u2019s jurisdictional analysis literally begins\nand ends with Irwin, see ante, at 4\u20135, 18, and thus relies\non a presumption that should have no bearing on the\nquestion. Without that presumption, the majority could\nnot so readily ignore the unmistakable evidence that\n\u00a72401(b)\u2019s limits are jurisdictional.\n                         *    *     *\n  For these reasons, I would hold that \u00a72401(b) does not allow\nequitable tolling, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Even the dissent in Bowles recognized Irwin\u2019s irrelevance: It cited\n\nthe decision only when discussing equitable exceptions to nonjurisdic-\ntional statutes of limitations. 551 U. S., at 219 (opinion of Souter, J.).\n   5 We considered Irwin in John R. Sand & Gravel while holding that\n\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72501\u2019s time limits are jurisdictional. But we did so only to\nreject the suggestion that Irwin compelled a contrary result. So there,\ntoo, Irwin\u2019s presumption did not influence the jurisdictional question.\nNor did it influence the outcome in Irwin itself, where we held that\nequitable tolling was not available.

KWAI FUN WONG\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 13\u20131074. Argued December 10, 2014\u2014Decided April 22, 2015*\nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides that a tort claim against\n  the United States \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d unless the claimant meets\n  two deadlines. First, a claim must be presented to the appropriate\n  federal agency for administrative review \u201cwithin two years after [the]\n  claim accrues.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72401(b). Second, if the agency denies the\n  claim, the claimant may file suit in federal court \u201cwithin six months\u201d\n  of the agency\u2019s denial. Ibid.\n     Kwai Fun Wong and Marlene June, respondents in Nos. 13\u20131074\n  and 13\u20131075, respectively, each missed one of those deadlines. Wong\n  failed to file her FTCA claim in federal court within 6 months, but\n  argued that that was only because the District Court had not permit-\n  ted her to file that claim until after the period expired. June failed to\n  present her FTCA claim to a federal agency within 2 years, but ar-\n  gued that her untimely filing should be excused because the Govern-\n  ment had, in her view, concealed facts vital to her claim. In each\n  case, the District Court dismissed the FTCA claim for failure to satis-\n  fy \u00a72401(b)\u2019s time bars, holding that, despite any justification for de-\n  lay, those time bars are jurisdictional and not subject to equitable\n  tolling. The Ninth Circuit reversed in both cases, concluding that\n  \u00a72401(b)\u2019s time bars may be equitably tolled.\nHeld: Section 2401(b)\u2019s time limits are subject to equitable tolling.\n  Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, provides\n  the framework for deciding the applicability of equitable tolling to\n  statutes of limitations on suits against the Government. There, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 13\u20131075, United States v. June, Conservator, al-\nso on certiorari to the same court.\n2                UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court adopted a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d that such time bars may\n    be equitably tolled. Id., at 95. Irwin\u2019s presumption may, of course,\n    be rebutted. One way to do so\u2014pursued by the Government here\u2014is\n    to demonstrate that the statute of limitations at issue is jurisdiction-\n    al; if so, the statute cannot be equitably tolled. But this Court will\n    not conclude that a time bar is jurisdictional unless Congress pro-\n    vides a \u201cclear statement\u201d to that effect. Sebelius v. Auburn Regional\n    Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___, ___. And in applying that clear state-\n    ment rule, this Court has said that most time bars, even if mandato-\n    ry and emphatic, are nonjurisdictional. See id., at ___. Congress\n    thus must do something special to tag a statute of limitations as ju-\n    risdictional and so prohibit a court from tolling it. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Congress did no such thing in enacting \u00a72401(b). The text of\n    that provision speaks only to a claim\u2019s timeliness; it does not refer to\n    the jurisdiction of the district courts or address those courts\u2019 authori-\n    ty to hear untimely suits. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n    500, 515. Instead, it \u201creads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute\n    of limitations.\u201d Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631, 647. Statutory\n    context confirms that reading. Congress\u2019s separation of a filing dead-\n    line from a jurisdictional grant often indicates that the deadline is\n    not jurisdictional, and here the FTCA\u2019s jurisdictional grant appears\n    not in \u00a72401(b) but in another section of Title 28, \u00a71346(b)(1). That\n    jurisdictional grant is not expressly conditioned on compliance with\n    \u00a72401(b)\u2019s limitations periods. Finally, assuming it could provide the\n    clear statement that this Court\u2019s cases require, \u00a72401(b)\u2019s legislative\n    history does not clearly demonstrate that Congress intended the pro-\n    vision to impose a jurisdictional bar. Pp. 7\u20139.\n       (c) The Government\u2019s two principal arguments for treating\n    \u00a72401(b) as jurisdictional are unpersuasive and foreclosed by this\n    Court\u2019s precedents. Pp. 9\u201317.\n          (1) The Government first points out that \u00a72401(b) includes the\n    same \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d language as the statute of limitations\n    governing Tucker Act claims, which this Court has held to be juris-\n    dictional. See, e.g., Kendall v. United States, 107 U. S. 123, 125\u2013126.\n    But that phrase was a commonplace in statutes of limitations enact-\n    ed around the time of the FTCA, and it does not carry talismanic ju-\n    risdictional significance. Indeed, this Court has construed the same\n    language to be subject to tolling in the Clayton Act\u2019s statute of limita-\n    tions. See American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, 559.\n    And in two decisions addressing the Tucker Act\u2019s statute of limita-\n    tions, the Court has dismissed the idea that that language is jurisdic-\n    tionally significant. See Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95; John R. Sand &\n    Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 137, 139. The \u201cshall be\n    forever barred\u201d phrase is thus nothing more than an ordinary way to\n                    Cite as: 575 U.

Pp. 9\u201314.\n       (2) The Government next argues that \u00a72401(b) is jurisdictional\n  because it is a condition on the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity.\n  But that argument is foreclosed by Irwin, which considered an identi-\n  cal objection but concluded that even time limits that condition a\n  waiver of immunity may be equitably tolled. See 498 U. S., at 95\u201396.\n  The Government\u2019s invocation of sovereign immunity principles is also\n  peculiarly inapt here. Unlike other waivers of sovereign immunity,\n  the FTCA treats the Government much like a private party, and the\n  Court has accordingly declined to construe the Act narrowly merely\n  because it waives the Government\u2019s immunity from suit. There is no\n  reason to do differently here. Pp. 14\u201317.\nNo. 13\u20131074, 732 F. 3d 1030, and No. 13\u20131075, 550 Fed.

As the FTCA\nrequires, Wong first presented that claim to the INS within\ntwo years of the alleged unlawful action. See \u00a72401(b);\n\u00a72675(a). The INS denied the administrative complaint on\nDecember 3, 2001. Under the Act, that gave Wong six\nmonths, until June 3, 2002, to bring her tort claim in\nfederal court. See \u00a72401(b).\n   Several months prior to the INS\u2019s decision, Wong had\nfiled suit in federal district court asserting various non-\nFTCA claims against the Government arising out of the\nsame alleged misconduct. Anticipating the INS\u2019s ruling,\nWong moved in mid-November 2001 to amend the com-\nplaint in that suit by adding her tort claim. On April 5,\n2002, a Magistrate Judge recommended granting Wong\nleave to amend. But the District Court did not finally\nadopt that proposal until June 25\u2014three weeks after the\nFTCA\u2019s 6-month deadline.\n   The Government moved to dismiss the tort claim on the\nground that it was filed late. The District Court at first\nrejected the motion. It recognized that Wong had man-\naged to add her FTCA claim only after \u00a72401(b)\u2019s 6-month\ntime period had expired. But the court equitably tolled\nthat period for all the time between the Magistrate\nJudge\u2019s recommendation and its own order allowing\namendment, thus bringing Wong\u2019s FTCA claim within the\nstatutory deadline. Several years later, the Government\nmoved for reconsideration of that ruling based on an in-\ntervening Ninth Circuit decision. This time, the District\nCourt dismissed Wong\u2019s claim, reasoning that \u00a72401(b)\u2019s\n6-month time bar was jurisdictional and therefore not\nsubject to equitable tolling. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit\nagreed to hear the case en banc to address an intra-circuit\nconflict on the issue. The en banc court held that the 6-\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

It then confirmed the District Court\u2019s prior ruling\nthat the circumstances here justify tolling because Wong\n\u201cexercis[ed] due diligence\u201d in attempting to amend her\ncomplaint before the statutory deadline. Id., at 1052.\n   The second case before us arises from a deadly highway\naccident. Andrew Booth was killed in 2005 when a car in\nwhich he was riding crossed through a cable median bar-\nrier and crashed into oncoming traffic. The following year,\nrespondent Marlene June, acting on behalf of Booth\u2019s\nyoung son, filed a wrongful death action alleging that the\nState of Arizona and its contractor had negligently con-\nstructed and maintained the median barrier. Years into\nthat state-court litigation, June contends, she discovered\nthat the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) had\napproved installation of the barrier knowing it had not\nbeen properly crash tested.\n   Relying on that new information, June presented a tort\nclaim to the FHWA in 2010, more than five years after the\naccident. The FHWA denied the claim, and June promptly\nfiled this action in federal district court. The court dis-\nmissed the suit because June had failed to submit her\nclaim to the FHWA within two years of the collision. The\nFTCA\u2019s 2-year bar, the court ruled, is jurisdictional and\ntherefore not subject to equitable tolling; accordingly, the\ncourt did not consider June\u2019s contention that tolling was\nproper because the Government had concealed its failure\nto require crash testing. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit\nreversed in light of its recent decision in Wong, thus hold-\ning that \u00a72401(b)\u2019s 2-year deadline, like its 6-month coun-\nterpart, is not jurisdictional and may be tolled. 550 Fed.\nAppx. 505 (2013).\n   We granted certiorari in both cases, 573 U. S. ___\n(2014), to resolve a circuit split about whether courts may\nequitably toll \u00a72401(b)\u2019s two time limits. Compare, e.g., In\n4              UNITED STATES v.

Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95\n(1990), sets out the framework for deciding \u201cthe applicabil-\nity of equitable tolling in suits against the Government.\u201d\nIn Irwin, we recognized that time bars in suits between\nprivate parties are presumptively subject to equitable\ntolling. See id., at 95\u201396. That means a court usually\nmay pause the running of a limitations statute in private\nlitigation when a party \u201chas pursued his rights diligently\nbut some extraordinary circumstance\u201d prevents him from\nmeeting a deadline. Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U. S.\n1, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7). We held in Irwin that \u201cthe\nsame rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling\u201d should\nalso apply to suits brought against the United States\nunder a statute waiving sovereign immunity. 498 U. S., at\n95\u201396. Our old \u201cad hoc,\u201d law-by-law approach to deter-\nmining the availability of tolling in those suits, we rea-\nsoned, had produced inconsistency and \u201cunpredictability\u201d\nwithout the offsetting virtue of enhanced \u201cfidelity to the\nintent of Congress.\u201d Id., at 95. Adopting the \u201cgeneral\nrule\u201d used in private litigation, we stated, would\n\u201camount[ ] to little, if any, broadening\u201d of a statutory\nwaiver of immunity. Ibid. Accordingly, we thought such a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although we did not consolidate these cases, we address them to-\n\ngether because everyone agrees that the core arguments for and\nagainst equitable tolling apply equally to both of \u00a72401(b)\u2019s deadlines.\nSee, e.g., Brief for United States in June 15 (\u201cNothing in the text or\nrelevant legislative history . . . suggests that the respective time bars\nshould be interpreted differently with respect to whether they are\njurisdictional or subject to equitable tolling\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npresumption \u201clikely to be a realistic assessment of legisla-\ntive intent as well as a practically useful\u201d rule of interpre-\ntation. Ibid.\n   A rebuttable presumption, of course, may be rebutted, so\nIrwin does not end the matter. When enacting a time bar\nfor a suit against the Government (as for one against a\nprivate party), Congress may reverse the usual rule if it\nchooses. See id., at 96. The Government may therefore\nattempt to establish, through evidence relating to a par-\nticular statute of limitations, that Congress opted to forbid\nequitable tolling.\n   One way to meet that burden\u2014and the way the Gov-\nernment pursues here\u2014is to show that Congress made the\ntime bar at issue jurisdictional.2 When that is so, a liti-\ngant\u2019s failure to comply with the bar deprives a court of all\nauthority to hear a case. Hence, a court must enforce the\nlimitation even if the other party has waived any timeli-\nness objection. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___\u2013\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 5\u20136). And, more crucially here, a\ncourt must do so even if equitable considerations would\nsupport extending the prescribed time period. See John R.\nSand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133\u2013\n134 (2008).3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Government notes, and we agree, that Congress may preclude\n\nequitable tolling of even a nonjurisdictional statute of limitations. See\nBrief for United States in Wong 20; Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medi-\ncal Center, 568 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2013) (slip op., at 6\u20138, 10\u201311) (find-\ning a nonjurisdictional time limit not amenable to tolling). And the\nGovernment contends in passing that even if \u00a72401(b) is nonjurisdic-\ntional, it prohibits equitable tolling. See Brief for United States in\nWong 20. But the Government makes no independent arguments in\nsupport of that position; instead, it relies (and even then implicitly) on\nthe same indicia of congressional intent that, in its view, show that\n\u00a72401(b)\u2019s time limits are jurisdictional. See infra, at 9\u201310, 14\u201315. In\naddressing the Government\u2019s predominant, jurisdictional claim, we\ntherefore also deal with its subsidiary one.\n   3 The dissent takes issue with the sequence in which we decide the\n6               UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Given those harsh consequences, the Government must\nclear a high bar to establish that a statute of limitations is\njurisdictional. In recent years, we have repeatedly held\nthat procedural rules, including time bars, cabin a court\u2019s\npower only if Congress has \u201cclearly state[d]\u201d as much.\nSebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (quoting Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp.,\n546 U. S. 500, 515 (2006)); see Gonzalez, 565 U. S., at ___\u2013\n___ (slip op., at 6\u20137). \u201c[A]bsent such a clear statement, . . .\n\u2018courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d\nAuburn Regional, 568 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But traditional tools of\nstatutory construction must plainly show that Congress\nimbued a procedural bar with jurisdictional consequences.\n   And in applying that clear statement rule, we have\nmade plain that most time bars are nonjurisdictional.\nSee, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (noting the rarity of\njurisdictional time limits). Time and again, we have de-\nscribed filing deadlines as \u201cquintessential claim-processing\nrules,\u201d which \u201cseek to promote the orderly progress of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\njurisdictional question, contending that we must do so prior to mention-\ning Irwin\u2019s presumption. See post, at 11\u201312 (opinion of ALITO, J.). We\ndo not understand the point\u2014or more precisely, why the dissent thinks\nthe ordering matters. When Congress makes a time bar in a suit\nagainst the Government jurisdictional, one could say (as the dissent\ndoes) that Irwin does not apply, or one could say (as we do) that Irwin\u2019s\npresumption is conclusively rebutted. The bottom line is the same:\nTolling is not available. We frame the inquiry as we do in part because\nthat is how the Government presented the issue. See Brief for United\nStates in Wong 19 (\u201cOne way to show that [Irwin\u2019s presumption is\nrebutted] is to establish that the statutory time limit is a \u2018jurisdictional\u2019\nrestriction\u201d). And we think that choice makes especially good sense in\nthese cases because various aspects of Irwin\u2019s reasoning are central to\nconsidering the parties\u2019 positions on whether \u00a72401(b) is jurisdictional.\nSee infra, at 12\u201317.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

S. 428, 435 (2011);\nsee Auburn Regional, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8);\nScarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 413 (2004). That\nis so, contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, see post, at 4,\n10\u201311, even when the time limit is important (most are)\nand even when it is framed in mandatory terms (again,\nmost are); indeed, that is so \u201chowever emphatic[ally]\u201d\nexpressed those terms may be, Henderson, 562 U. S., at\n439 (quoting Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers,\n558 U. S. 67, 81 (2009)). Congress must do something\nspecial, beyond setting an exception-free deadline, to tag a\nstatute of limitations as jurisdictional and so prohibit a\ncourt from tolling it.\n    In enacting the FTCA, Congress did nothing of that\nkind. It provided no clear statement indicating that\n\u00a72401(b) is the rare statute of limitations that can deprive\na court of jurisdiction. Neither the text nor the context\nnor the legislative history indicates (much less does so\nplainly) that Congress meant to enact something other\nthan a standard time bar.\n   Most important, \u00a72401(b)\u2019s text speaks only to a claim\u2019s\ntimeliness, not to a court\u2019s power. It states that \u201c[a] tort\nclaim against the United States shall be forever barred\nunless it is presented [to the agency] within two years . . .\nor unless action is begun within six months\u201d of the agen-\ncy\u2019s denial of the claim. That is mundane statute-of-\nlimitations language, saying only what every time bar,\nby definition, must: that after a certain time a claim\nis barred. See infra, at 11, n. 7 (citing many similarly\nworded limitations statutes). The language is mandatory\u2014\n\u201cshall\u201d be barred\u2014but (as just noted) that is true of most\nsuch statutes, and we have consistently found it of no\nconsequence. See, e.g., Gonzalez, 565 U. S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 10\u201311). Too, the language might be viewed as\nemphatic\u2014\u201cforever\u201d barred\u2014but (again) we have often\n8              UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nheld that not to matter. See, e.g., Henderson, 562 U. S., at\n439; Union Pacific, 558 U. S., at 81. What matters instead\nis that \u00a72401(b) \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or\nrefer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u201d\nArbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515 (quoting Zipes v. Trans World\nAirlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)). It does not define\na federal court\u2019s jurisdiction over tort claims generally,\naddress its authority to hear untimely suits, or in any way\ncabin its usual equitable powers. Section 2401(b), in\nshort, \u201creads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of\nlimitations,\u201d spelling out a litigant\u2019s filing obligations\nwithout restricting a court\u2019s authority. Holland v. Flor-\nida, 560 U. S. 631, 647 (2010).4\n   Statutory context confirms that reading. This Court has\noften explained that Congress\u2019s separation of a filing\ndeadline from a jurisdictional grant indicates that the\ntime bar is not jurisdictional. See Henderson, 562 U. S., at\n439\u2013440; Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. 154,\n164\u2013165 (2010); Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515; Zipes, 455\nU. S., at 393\u2013394. So too here. Whereas \u00a72401(b) houses\nthe FTCA\u2019s time limitations, a different section of Title 28\nconfers power on federal district courts to hear FTCA\nclaims. See \u00a71346(b)(1) (\u201cdistrict courts . . . shall have\nexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over tort claims against the United\nStates). Nothing conditions the jurisdictional grant on the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The dissent argues that nonjurisdictional time limits typically men-\n\ntion claimants, whereas \u00a72401(b) does not. See post, at 10. But none of\nour precedents have either said or suggested that such a difference\nmatters\u2014that, for example, a statute barring a \u201ctort claim\u201d is jurisdic-\ntional, but one barring a \u201cperson\u2019s tort claim\u201d is not. See, e.g., Zipes,\n455 U. S., at 394, and n. 10 (concluding that a time limit did \u201cnot speak\nin jurisdictional terms\u201d even though it did not refer to a claimant).\nRather, in case after case, we have emphasized another distinction\u2014\nthat jurisdictional statutes speak about jurisdiction, or more generally\nphrased, about a court\u2019s powers. See Auburn Regional, 568 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 7); Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. 154, 160\u2013\n161 (2010); Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Treating \u00a72401(b)\u2019s time bars as jurisdictional\nwould thus disregard the structural divide built into the\nstatute.\n   Finally, even assuming legislative history alone could\nprovide a clear statement (which we doubt), none does so\nhere. The report accompanying the FTCA did not discuss\nwhether \u00a72401(b)\u2019s time limits are jurisdictional. See S.\nRep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946). And in\namending \u00a72401(b) four times after its enactment, Con-\ngress declined again (four times over) to say anything\nspecific about whether the statute of limitations imposes a\njurisdictional bar. Congress thus failed to provide any-\nthing like the clear statement this Court has demanded\nbefore deeming a statute of limitations to curtail a court\u2019s\npower.\n   And so we wind up back where we started, with Irwin\u2019s\n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d that equitable tolling is available in suits\nagainst the Government. 498 U. S., at 95. The justifica-\ntion the Government offers for departing from that princi-\nple fails: Section 2401(b) is not a jurisdictional require-\nment. The time limits in the FTCA are just time limits,\nnothing more. Even though they govern litigation against\nthe Government, a court can toll them on equitable\ngrounds.\n                           III\n  The Government balks at that straightforward analysis,\nclaiming that it overlooks two reasons for thinking\n\u00a72401(b) jurisdictional. But neither of those reasons is\npersuasive. Indeed, our precedents in this area foreclose\nthem both.\n                              A\n  The Government principally contends that \u00a72401(b) is\njurisdictional because it includes the same language as the\n10             UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute of limitations governing contract (and some other\nnon-tort) suits brought against the United States under\nthe Tucker Act.

See Kendall v. United States,\n107 U. S. 123, 125\u2013126 (1883); Finn v. United States, 123\nU. S. 227, 232 (1887); Soriano v. United States, 352 U. S.\n270, 273\u2013274 (1957). When Congress drafted the FTCA\u2019s\ntime bar, it used the same \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d lan-\nguage (though selecting a shorter limitations period). \u201cIn\nthese circumstances,\u201d the Government maintains, \u201cthe\nonly reasonable conclusion is that Congress intended the\nFTCA\u2019s identically worded time limit to be a jurisdictional\nbar.\u201d Brief for United States in Wong 21\u201322. According to\nthe Government, Congress wanted the FTCA to serve as\n\u201ca tort-law analogue to the Tucker Act\u201d and incorporated\nthe words \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d to similarly preclude\nequitable tolling. Reply Brief in Wong 4. (The dissent\nrelies heavily on the same argument. See post, at 4\u20138.)\n  But the Government takes too much from Congress\u2019s\nuse in \u00a72401(b) of an utterly unremarkable phrase. The\n\u201cshall be forever barred\u201d formulation was a commonplace\nin federal limitations statutes for many decades surround-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Tucker Act of 1887, ch. 359, 24 Stat. 505, enlarged the Court of\n\nClaims\u2019 jurisdiction over contract and other non-tort actions against the\nGovernment. The statute of limitations applying to such suits pre-\ndated the Tucker Act by more than two decades.\n  6 During a recodification occurring in 1948 (two years after passage of\n\nthe FTCA), Congress omitted the word \u201cforever\u201d from the Tucker Act\u2019s\nstatute of limitations; since then, it has provided simply that untimely\nclaims \u201cshall be barred.\u201d 28 U.

C. \u00a75412(b)\n(1976 ed.).\n   8 Even before this Court\u2019s decision in American Pipe, Courts of Ap-\n\npeals had unanimously construed the Clayton Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions to allow equitable tolling. See General Elec. Co. v. San Antonio,\n334 F. 2d 480, 484\u2013485 (CA5 1964) (joining six other Circuits in reach-\ning that conclusion). Similarly, every Court of Appeals to have consid-\nered the issue has found that \u00a76 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, which\ncontains the same \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d phrase, permits hearing\nlate claims. See, e.g., Hodgson v. Humphries, 454 F. 2d 1279, 1283\u2013\n1284 (CA10 1972); Ott v. Midland-Ross Corp., 523 F. 2d 1367, 1370\n(CA6 1975); Partlow v. Jewish Orphans\u2019 Home of Southern Cal., Inc.,\n645 F. 2d 757, 760\u2013761 (CA9 1981), abrogated on other grounds by\nHoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U. S. 165 (1989). And so too\nCourts of Appeals unanimously found that the ADEA\u2019s longtime\n(though not current) time bar containing that language was subject to\ntolling. See, e.g., Vance v. Whirlpool Corp., 707 F. 2d 483, 489 (CA4\n12            UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nacknowledged, referring to the \u201cshall be forever barred\u201d\nlocution: \u201c[T]hat type of language has more to do with the\nlegal rhetoric at the time the statute was passed\u201d than\nwith anything else, and should not \u201cmake[ ] a difference\u201d\nto the jurisdictional analysis. Tr. of Oral Arg. in Irwin,\nO. T. 1990, No. 89\u20135867, p. 30. Or, put just a bit differ-\nently: Congress\u2019s inclusion of a phrase endemic to limita-\ntions statutes of that era, at least some of which allow\ntolling, cannot provide the requisite clear statement that a\ntime bar curtails a court\u2019s authority.\n   Indeed, in two decisions directly addressing the Tucker\nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, this Court dismissed the idea\nthat the language the Government relies on here has\njurisdictional significance. Twice we described the words\nin that provision as not meaningfully different from those\nin a nonjurisdictional statute of limitations. And twice we\nmade clear that the jurisdictional status of the Tucker\nAct\u2019s time bar has precious little to do with its phrasing.\n   We first did so in Irwin. Using our newly minted pre-\nsumption, see supra, at 4\u20135, we decided there that the\nlimitations period governing Title VII suits against the\nGovernment, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u201316(c) (1988 ed.), allowed\nequitable tolling. In reaching that conclusion, we com-\npared \u00a72000e\u201316(c)\u2019s text (then stating that an employee\n\u201cmay file a civil action\u201d within 30 days of an agency\u2019s\ndenial of her claim) with the language of the Tucker Act\u2019s\ntime bar. We noted that we had formerly held the Tucker\nAct\u2019s limitations statute to \u201cjurisdictionally bar[ ]\u201d late\nclaims, and we acknowledged the possibility of justifying\nthat different treatment by characterizing its \u201clanguage\n[as] more stringent than\u201d \u00a72000e\u201316(c)\u2019s. Irwin, 498 U. S.,\nat 94\u201395. But we rejected that reasoning, instead finding\nthat the two formulations were materially alike. \u201c[W]e are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1983); Callowhill v.

S. ____ (2015)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot persuaded,\u201d we stated, \u201cthat the difference between\nthem is enough to manifest a different congressional\nintent with respect to the availability of equitable tolling.\u201d\nId., at 95. Leaving for another day the question of what\ndid account for the jurisdictional status of the Tucker Act\u2019s\ntime bar, the Court thus ruled out reliance on its lan-\nguage. In other words, on the core question the Govern-\nment raises here\u2014whether the phrase \u201cshall be forever\nbarred,\u201d as used in both the Tucker Act and the FTCA,\nmanifests a congressional decision to preclude tolling\u2014\nIrwin said no.\n   More recently, John R. Sand reaffirmed that conclusion,\neven as it refused to overturn our century-old view that\nthe Tucker Act\u2019s time bar is jurisdictional. No less than\nthree times, John R. Sand approvingly repeated Irwin\u2019s\nstatement that the textual differences between the Tucker\nAct\u2019s time bar and \u00a72000e\u201316(c) were insignificant\u2014i.e.,\nthat the language of the two provisions could not explain\nwhy the former was jurisdictional and the latter not. See\n552 U. S., at 137, 139 (calling the provisions \u201clinguistically\nsimilar,\u201d \u201csimilar . . . in language,\u201d and \u201csimilarly worded\u201d).\nBut if that were so, John R. Sand asked, why not hold\nthat the Tucker Act\u2019s time limit, like \u00a72000e\u201316(c), is\nnonjurisdictional? The answer came down to two words:\nstare decisis. The Tucker Act\u2019s bar was different because\nit had been the subject of \u201ca definitive earlier interpreta-\ntion.\u201d Id., at 138; see id., at 137; supra, at 10. And for\nthat reason alone, John R. Sand left in place our prior\nconstruction of the Tucker Act\u2019s time limit. See 552 U. S.,\nat 139 (observing, in Justice Brandeis\u2019s words, that \u201cit is\nmore important that\u201d the rule \u201cbe settled than that it be\nsettled right\u201d (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.,\n285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (dissenting opinion))). What is\nspecial about the Tucker Act\u2019s deadline, John R. Sand\nrecognized, comes merely from this Court\u2019s prior rulings,\nnot from Congress\u2019s choice of wording.\n14           UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government thus cannot show that the phrase\n\u201cshall be forever barred\u201d in \u00a72401(b) plainly signifies a\njurisdictional statute, as our decisions require. See supra,\nat 6\u20137. Unlike in John R. Sand, here stare decisis plays\nno role: We have not previously considered whether\n\u00a72401(b) restricts a court\u2019s authority. What we have done\nis to say, again and again, that the core language in that\nprovision has no jurisdictional significance. It is materi-\nally indistinguishable from the language in one nonjurisdic-\ntional time bar (i.e., \u00a72000e\u201316(c)). See Irwin, 498 U. S.,\nat 95; John R. Sand, 552 U. S., at 137, 139. And it is\nidentical to the language in another (i.e., 15 U. S. C. \u00a715b).\nSee American Pipe, 414 U. S., at 559. Yes, we have held\nthat the Tucker Act\u2019s time bar, which includes those same\nwords, constrains a court\u2019s power to hear late claims. But\nas we explained in Irwin, that is not because the phrase\nitself \u201cmanifest[s] a . . . congressional intent with respect\nto the availability of equitable tolling.\u201d 498 U. S., at 95.\nThe words on which the Government pins its hopes are\njust the words of a limitations statute of a particular era.\nAnd nothing else supports the Government\u2019s claim that\nCongress, when enacting the FTCA, wanted to incorporate\nthis Court\u2019s view of the Tucker Act\u2019s time bar\u2014much less\nthat Congress expressed that purported intent with the\nneeded clear statement.\n                            B\n   The Government next contends that at the time of the\nFTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress thought that every limita-\ntions statute applying to suits against the United States,\nhowever framed or worded, cut off a court\u2019s jurisdiction\nover untimely claims. On that view, the particular lan-\nguage of those statutes makes no difference. All that\nmatters is that such time limits function as conditions on\nthe Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. In that\nera\u2014indeed, up until Irwin was decided\u2014those conditions\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwere generally supposed to be \u201cstrictly observed.\u201d So-\nriano, 352 U. S., at 276. That meant, the Government\nurges, that all time limits on actions against the United\nStates \u201ccarr[ied] jurisdictional consequences.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States in Wong 34. Accordingly, the Government\nconcludes, Congress \u201cwould have expected courts to apply\n[\u00a72401(b)] as a jurisdictional requirement\u2014just as condi-\ntions on waivers of sovereign immunity had always been\napplied.\u201d Id., at 32.\n   Irwin, however, forecloses that argument. After all,\nIrwin also considered a pre-Irwin time bar attached to a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. The Government argued\nthere\u2014anticipating its claim here\u2014that because \u00a72000e\u2013\n16(c)\u2019s statute of limitations conditioned such a waiver, it\nmust be jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling.\nSee Brief for Respondents 6, 10, 14, 19, and Tr. of Oral\nArg. 31\u201337, in Irwin, O. T. 1990, No. 89\u20135867. But Irwin\ndisagreed, applying the opposite presumption to a time\nlimit passed two decades earlier. See 498 U. S., at 94\u201396;\nsupra, at 4\u20135. Justice White protested, much as the Gov-\nernment does now, that at the time of \u00a72000e\u201316(c)\u2019s\nenactment, limitations statutes for suits against the Gov-\nernment were \u201cstrictly observed\u201d and not amenable to\ntolling. 498 U. S., at 97 (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (quoting Soriano, 352 U. S., at\n276); see 498 U. S., at 99, n. 2. How could an earlier Con-\ngress, Justice White asked, have \u201chad in mind the Court\u2019s\npresent departure from that longstanding rule\u201d? Ibid.; see\npost, at 9 (asking a variant of the same question). But the\nIrwin Court was undeterred. The Court noted that it had\nnot applied the former rule so consistently as Justice\nWhite suggested. See 498 U. S., at 94. And the Court\ndoubted that the former approach so well reflected con-\ngressional intent: On the contrary, because equitable\ntolling \u201camounts to little, if any, broadening of the con-\ngressional waiver,\u201d we thought that a rule generally allow-\n16           UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning tolling is the more \u201crealistic assessment of legislative\nintent.\u201d Id., at 95; see supra, at 4\u20135. For those reasons,\nthe Court declined to count time bars as jurisdictional\nmerely because they condition waivers of immunity\u2014even\nif Congress enacted the deadline when the Court inter-\npreted limitations statutes differently.\n   In the years since, this Court has repeatedly followed\nIrwin\u2019s lead. We have applied Irwin to pre-Irwin statutes,\njust as we have to statutes that followed in that decision\u2019s\nwake. See Scarborough, 541 U. S., at 420\u2013422; Franconia\nAssociates v. United States, 536 U. S. 129, 145 (2002). To\nbe sure, Irwin\u2019s presumption is rebuttable. But the rebut-\ntal cannot rely on what Irwin itself deemed irrelevant\u2014\nthat Congress passed the statute in an earlier era, when\nthis Court often attached jurisdictional consequence to\nconditions on waivers of sovereign immunity. Rather, the\nrebuttal must identify something distinctive about the\ntime limit at issue, whether enacted then or later\u2014a\nreason for thinking Congress wanted that limitations\nstatute (not all statutes passed in an earlier day) to curtail\na court\u2019s jurisdiction. On the Government\u2019s contrary view,\nIrwin would effectively become only a prospective decision.\nNothing could be less consonant with Irwin\u2019s ambition to\nadopt a \u201cgeneral rule to govern the applicability of equit-\nable tolling in suits against the Government.\u201d 498 U. S.,\nat 95.\n   And the Government\u2019s claim is peculiarly inapt as ap-\nplied to \u00a72401(b) because all that is special about the\nFTCA cuts in favor of allowing equitable tolling. As com-\npared to other waivers of immunity (prominently includ-\ning the Tucker Act), the FTCA treats the United States\nmore like a commoner than like the Crown. The FTCA\u2019s\njurisdictional provision states that courts may hear suits\n\u201cunder circumstances where the United States, if a private\nperson, would be liable to the claimant.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71346(b). And when defining substantive liability for\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntorts, the Act reiterates that the United States is account-\nable \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a\nprivate individual.\u201d \u00a72674. In keeping with those provi-\nsions, this Court has often rejected the Government\u2019s calls\nto cabin the FTCA on the ground that it waives sovereign\nimmunity\u2014and indeed, the Court did so in the years\nimmediately after the Act\u2019s passage, even as it was con-\nstruing other waivers of immunity narrowly. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 338 U. S.\n366, 383 (1949); Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350\nU. S. 61, 65 (1955); Rayonier Inc. v. United States, 352\nU. S. 315, 319\u2013320 (1957). There is no reason to do differ-\nently here. As Irwin recognized, treating the Government\nlike a private person means (among other things) permit-\nting equitable tolling. See 498 U. S., at 95\u201396. So in\nstressing the Government\u2019s equivalence to a private party,\nthe FTCA goes further than the typical statute waiving\nsovereign immunity to indicate that its time bar allows a\ncourt to hear late claims.\n                             IV\n  Our precedents make this a clear-cut case. Irwin re-\nquires an affirmative indication from Congress that it\nintends to preclude equitable tolling in a suit against the\nGovernment. See 498 U. S., at 95\u201396. Congress can\nprovide that signal by making a statute of limitations\njurisdictional. But that requires its own plain statement;\notherwise, we treat a time bar as a mere claims-processing\nrule. See Auburn Regional, 568 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op.,\nat 6, 8). Congress has supplied no such statement here.\nAs this Court has repeatedly stated, nothing about\n\u00a72401(b)\u2019s core language is special; \u201cshall be forever\nbarred\u201d is an ordinary (albeit old-fashioned) way of setting\na deadline, which does not preclude tolling when circum-\nstances warrant. See Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95\u201396; John R.\nSand, 552 U. S., at 137, 139; American Pipe, 414 U. S., at\n18          UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n558\u2013559. And it makes no difference that a time bar\nconditions a waiver of sovereign immunity, even if Con-\ngress enacted the measure when different interpretive\nconventions applied; that is the very point of this Court\u2019s\ndecision to treat time bars in suits against the Govern-\nment, whenever passed, the same as in litigation between\nprivate parties. See Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95\u201396; Scar-\nborough, 541 U. S., at 420\u2013422; Franconia, 536 U. S., at\n145. Accordingly, we hold that the FTCA\u2019s time bars are\nnonjurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling.\n  We affirm the judgments of the U. S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit and remand the cases for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand in\nJune, it is for the District Court to decide whether, on the\nfacts of her case, June is entitled to equitable tolling.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

The FTCA waives the immunity of the United\nStates for certain tort claims but provides that any \u201ctort\nclaim against the United States shall be forever barred\nunless\u201d it is filed with the appropriate agency \u201cwithin\ntwo years after such claim accrues\u201d and in federal court\n\u201cwithin six months after\u201d the agency\u2019s final decision. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72401(b). The statutory text, its historical roots,\nand more than a century of precedents show that this\nabsolute bar is not subject to equitable tolling. I would\nenforce the statute as Congress intended and reverse.\n                            I\n  The FTCA is a waiver of sovereign immunity and must\nbe understood in that context. In the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies, Congress was reluctant to allow individual tort\n2           UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nclaims against the United States. Instead, it granted\nrelief to individuals through private laws enacted solely\nfor those individuals\u2019 benefit. These waivers of sovereign\nimmunity were surgical and sporadic, but \u201cnotoriously\nclumsy,\u201d and by 1946 Congress thought it better to adopt a\n\u201csimplified\u201d approach. Dalehite v. United States, 346 U. S.\n15, 24\u201325 (1953). The FTCA thus waived sovereign im-\nmunity for tort claims against the Government and set out\na procedure for adjudicating those claims.\n   This waiver of sovereign immunity was no trivial mat-\nter. Long before the FTCA, Congress authorized suits\nagainst the Government for contract and property claims\nunder the Tucker Act and a number of predecessor stat-\nutes, but the Tucker Act excluded tort claims from its\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. The concern was obvious:\nAs opposed to the more predictable nature of contractual\nand property claims, tort-based harms are sometimes\nunperceived and open-ended. Even frivolous claims re-\nquire the Federal Government to expend administrative\nand litigation costs, which ultimately fall upon society at-\nlarge. For every dollar spent to defend against or to sat-\nisfy a tort claim against the United States, the Government\nmust either raise taxes or shift funds originally allocated\nto different public programs.\n   To reduce these risks, Congress placed strict limits on\nthe FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. The statute\n\u201cexempts from [its] waiver certain categories of claims,\u201d\nAli v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 218 (2008),\nand includes a broad exemption for claims \u201carising out of\nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, mali-\ncious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrep-\nresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.\u201d\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(h); see also \u00a7\u00a72680(a)\u2013(n). In addition,\nin order to limit the scope and unpredictability of the\nGovernment\u2019s potential liability, the Act exempts from the\nwaiver of sovereign immunity certain types of recovery,\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

See\n\u00a72674.\n  Most relevant here, the FTCA \u201ccondition[s]\u201d its waiver\nof sovereign immunity on strict filing deadlines. United\nStates v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 117 (1979). As enacted in\n1946, the Act granted district courts exclusive jurisdiction\nover tort claims against the Government, \u201c[s]ubject to the\n[other] provisions of \u201d the Act. FTCA, ch. 753, \u00a7410(a), 60\nStat. 843\u2013844.

Both of these inquiries\nrequire close attention to the text, context, and history of\nthe Act. And both lead to the conclusion that the FTCA\nallows no equitable tolling.\n4            UNITED STATES v.

If not\nfiled with the agency within two years, or with a federal\ncourt within six months, a claim \u201cshall be\u201d \u201cbarred\u201d \u201cfor-\never.\u201d \u201cShall be forever barred\u201d is not generally understood\nto mean \u201cshould be allowed sometimes.\u201d The statute\nbrooks no exceptions. And because the filing deadlines\nrestrict the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, they\nimpose a limit on the courts\u2019 jurisdiction that \u201cwe should\nnot take it upon ourselves to extend.\u201d Kubrick, supra, at\n117\u2013118.\n   For over 130 years, we have understood these terms as\njurisdictional. When crafting the FTCA\u2019s limitations\nprovision, Congress did not write on a clean slate. Rather,\nit borrowed language from limitations provisions in the\nTucker Act and its predecessor statutes. The 1911 version\nof the Tucker Act included language that was nearly\nidentical to that in the 1946 version of the FTCA: \u201cEvery\nclaim against the United States cognizable by the Court of\nClaims, shall be forever barred unless the petition setting\nforth a statement thereof is filed in the court . . . within six\nyears after the claim first accrues.\u201d \u00a7156, 36 Stat. 1139.\nThat statutory language came, in turn, from the 1863\npredecessor to the Tucker Act. See \u00a710, 12 Stat. 767.\n   As early as 1883, we interpreted these precise terms to\nimpose a \u201cjurisdiction[al]\u201d requirement that the \u201ccourt\nmay not disregard.\u201d Kendall v. United States, 107 U. S.\n123, 125. We emphasized that, when waiving sovereign\nimmunity, Congress \u201cmay restrict the jurisdiction of the\n[courts] to certain classes of demands.\u201d Ibid. And we held\nthat \u201c[t]he express words of the statute leave no room for\ncontention.\u201d Ibid. The Court thus had no \u201cauthority to\n                       Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                        5\n\n                            ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nengraft\u201d an equitable tolling provision where Congress had\nso clearly constrained the judiciary\u2019s authority. Ibid.\n   Over the ensuing decades, we repeatedly reaffirmed our\ninterpretation of the phrase. In Finn v. United States, 123\nU. S. 227, 232 (1887), we held that the Government could\nnot waive the jurisdictional time bar and thus that the\n\u201cduty of the court\u201d was \u201cto dismiss the petition\u201d when a\nplaintiff raised an untimely claim. We reached the same\nconclusion in De Arnaud v. United States, 151 U. S. 483,\n495\u2013496 (1894). We reaffirmed the rule in United States\nv. New York, 160 U. S. 598, 616\u2013619 (1896), while holding\nthat there was jurisdiction where the plaintiff presented\nits claim before the statutory deadline. And in Munro v.\nUnited States, 303 U. S. 36, 38, n. 1, 41 (1938), we held\nthat a District Court lacked jurisdiction to resolve un-\ntimely claims, even if the Government waived any objection,\nunder a different statute that incorporated the Tucker\nAct\u2019s time limits. All the while, the lower courts similarly\nenforced the deadline as \u201ca jurisdictional requirement,\ncompliance with which is necessary to enable suit to be\nmaintained against the sovereign.\u201d Compagnie Generale\nTransatlantique v. United States, 51 F. 2d 1053, 1056\n(CA2 1931). Thus, by 1946, the phrase \u201cshall be forever\nbarred\u201d was well understood to deprive federal courts of\njurisdiction over untimely claims.1\n   The FTCA\u2019s statutory terms must be understood in this\ncontext. When Congress crafted the FTCA as a tort-based\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 At times in the past we have too loosely conferred the \u201cjurisdic-\n\ntional\u201d label. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S.\n83, 90 (1998). But our use of the term in this context was conscious, as we\nrecognized in John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S.\n130, 134 (2008) (\u201cJustice Harlan, writing for the Court, said the statute\nwas \u2018jurisdiction[al],\u2019 . . . and that \u2018it [was] the duty of the court to raise\nthe [timeliness] question whether it [was] done by plea or not\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nKendall v. United States, 107 U. S. 123, 125 (1883))). And it was\ncorrect.\n6                UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nanalogue to the Tucker Act, it consciously borrowed the\nwell-known wording of the Tucker Act\u2019s filing deadline.\nThen, as now, it was settled that \u201c[i]n adopting the lan-\nguage used in an earlier act, Congress must be considered\nto have adopted also the construction given by this Court\nto such language, and made it a part of the enactment.\u201d\nHecht v. Malley, 265 U. S. 144, 153 (1924); see also\nShapiro v. United States, 335 U. S. 1, 16 (1948); Sekhar v.\nUnited States, 570 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2013) (slip op., at 3\u2013\n4) (\u201c \u2018[I]f a word is obviously transplanted from another\nlegal source, whether the common law or other legislation,\nit brings the old soil with it\u2019 \u201d (quoting Frankfurter, Some\nReflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev.\n527, 537 (1947))).\n   Indeed, Congress considered departing from the Tucker\nAct\u2019s prohibition on equitable tolling, but decided against\nit. Proposals to include an equitable tolling provision were\n\u201cincluded in nine of the thirty-one bills prior to the enact-\nment of the FTCA,\u201d but \u201cthe Act passed by the 1946 Con-\ngress did not provide for any equitable tolling of the limi-\ntations periods.\u201d Colella & Bain, Revisiting Equitable\nTolling and the Federal Tort Claims Act, 31 Seton Hall\nL. Rev. 174, 195\u2013196 (2000). Instead, it was understood\nthat individuals with claims outside those deadlines could\nturn to Congress for relief through private bills, as they\ndid before the FTCA\u2019s enactment. See id., at 195.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Congress has occasionally modified the FTCA\u2019s limitations provi-\nsion. Initially, the Act required plaintiffs to file suit within one year of\na claim\u2019s accrual, or if the claim was for less than $1,000 to present the\nclaim to the appropriate agency within one year of accrual. FTCA \u00a7420,\n60 Stat. 845. In 1949, to relieve the hardship of the 1-year deadline,\nCongress enlarged the filing deadline to two years. Act of Apr. 25, ch.\n92, \u00a71, 63 Stat. 62. Then, in 1966, it made the filing of an administra-\ntive claim with the appropriate agency a prerequisite to filing suit, and\nit shortened the litigation filing deadline to six months from the agen-\ncy\u2019s denial of the claim. Act of July 18, \u00a7\u00a72(a), 7, 80 Stat. 306, 307. But\nCongress has never suggested that the deadlines could be excused or\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)      7\n\n                            ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   The evidence of statutory meaning does not end there.\nWe reaffirmed the phase\u2019s jurisdictional nature in the\ndecades following the FTCA\u2019s enactment. In Soriano v.\nUnited States, 352 U. S. 270 (1957), we rejected a request\nto allow equitable tolling under the Tucker Act. Confirm-\ning the connection between the Tucker Act and the FTCA,\nwe noted that \u201cstatutes permitting suits for tax refunds,\ntort actions, alien property litigation, patent cases, and\nother claims against the Government would be affected\u201d if\nthe Court allowed equitable tolling under the Tucker Act.\nId., at 275 (emphasis added). And in Kubrick, 444 U. S.,\nat 117\u2013118, we cited Soriano\u2019s warning while emphasizing\nthat the FTCA\u2019s time limits are a condition of the Act\u2019s\nwaiver of sovereign immunity.\n   The lower courts also quickly recognized the statutes\u2019\ncommon heritage and enforced \u00a72401(b) as a jurisdictional\nrequirement. In Anderegg v. United States, 171 F. 2d 127,\n128 (1948) (per curiam), the Fourth Circuit cited Finn and\nMunro while holding that the FTCA\u2019s filing deadline is a\njurisdictional limit that the Government cannot waive.\nThe Fifth Circuit, in Simon v. United States, 244 F. 2d\n703, 705, n. 4 (1957), held that the FTCA\u2019s deadline is a\njurisdictional condition on the Act\u2019s waiver of sovereign\nimmunity and cited Carpenter v. United States, 56 F. 2d\n828, 829 (CA2 1932), a Tucker Act case, to support its\nholding. And in Humphreys v. United States, 272 F. 2d\n411 (1959), the Ninth Circuit similarly relied on Tucker\nAct precedents to hold that \u201cthe District Court has no\njurisdiction over [an untimely FTCA] action,\u201d because no\nwaiver of sovereign immunity exists once the filing dead-\nline \u201chas run.\u201d Id., at 412 (citing Edwards v. United\nStates, 163 F. 2d 268, 269 (CA9 1947), in turn citing Finn\nand Munro). When Congress amended the FTCA in 1966,\nit readopted the \u201cforever barred\u201d language against the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nenlarged by the courts. \n\n8            UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbackdrop of Soriano and the lower courts\u2019 interpretation of\nthe phrase. We must therefore assume that Congress\nmeant to keep the universally recognized meaning of those\nwords. See, e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.\nCline, 540 U. S. 581, 593\u2013594 (2004).\n    That meaning, of course, cannot change over time. But\neven if there were any doubt, we recently reaffirmed our\nview in John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552\nU. S. 130 (2008). We explained that, unlike run-of-the-\nmill statutes of limitation, jurisdictional time limits \u201cseek\n. . . to achieve a broader system-related goal, such as\nfacilitating the administration of claims, limiting the scope\nof a governmental waiver of sovereign immunity, or pro-\nmoting judicial efficiency.\u201d Id., at 133 (citations omitted).\nRecounting our decisions in Kendall, Finn, De Arnaud,\nNew York, and Soriano, we \u201creiterated\u201d our understanding\nof the \u201cabsolute nature of the court of claims limitations\nstatute.\u201d 552 U. S., at 135. And we rejected an invitation\nto abandon that interpretation, noting that Congress has\nlong accepted our interpretation of the statute. Id., at 139.\n    The same must be said of the FTCA. As we have often\nexplained, \u201c[w]hen a long line of this Court\u2019s decisions left\nundisturbed by Congress has treated a similar require-\nment as \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019 we will presume that Congress\nintended to follow that course.\u201d Henderson v. Shinseki,\n562 U. S. 428, 436 (2011) (citation and some internal\nquotation marks omitted); Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,\n559 U. S. 154, 168 (2010); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomo-\ntive Engineers, 558 U. S. 67, 82 (2009). Every single deci-\nsion from this Court interpreting the Tucker Act\u2019s \u201csimilar\nrequirement\u201d has treated it as jurisdictional. And there is\nstrong historical evidence that Congress \u201cintended to\nfollow that course.\u201d That should be the end of the matter:\nSection 2410(b)\u2019s filing deadlines are jurisdictional limits\nthat are not subject to equitable tolling.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\n                              B\n\n   Even if the FTCA\u2019s filing deadlines are not jurisdic-\ntional, they still prohibit equitable tolling. To be sure, in\nrecent years, we have grown reluctant to affix the \u201cjuris-\ndictional\u201d label. See, e.g., Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500, 510 (2006); Henderson, supra, at 434\u2013436. \u201cBut\ncalling a rule nonjurisdictional does not mean that it is not\nmandatory.\u201d Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n(slip op., at 10). Where Congress imposes an inflexible\nclaims processing rule, it is our duty to enforce the law\nand prohibit equitable tolling, whether it is jurisdictional\nor not.\n   Here, Congress\u2019 intent is clear. The words of the statute\nleave no doubt that untimely claims are never allowed:\nThey are \u201cforever barred.\u201d This is no weak-kneed com-\nmand. The history underlying the text only bolsters its\napparent meaning, and our repeated reaffirmation of the\nphrase\u2019s meaning should remove any doubt. Congress\nnever meant for equitable tolling to be available under the\nFTCA.\n   The only factor pointing in the opposite direction is our\nsuggestion in Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498\nU. S. 89, 95\u201396 (1990), that we would thenceforth apply a\nrebuttable presumption in favor of equitable tolling in\nsuits against the Government. But it is beyond me how\nIrwin\u2019s judge-made presumption announced in 1990 can\ntrump the obvious meaning of a statute enacted many\ndecades earlier. Cf. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441\nU. S. 677, 718 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., concurring). In any\nevent, Irwin\u2019s rebuttable presumption is overcome in this\ncase. For well over a century, we have recognized the\ninflexible nature of the Tucker Act\u2019s provision. Since its\nadoption, we have recognized that the FTCA\u2019s language\nbears the same meaning as its Tucker Act companion. See\nSoriano, supra, at 275; Kubrick, supra, at 118. And in\nJohn R. Sand & Gravel, we held that our \u201cdefinitive ear-\n10           UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlier interpretation of the\u201d Tucker Act is a \u201csufficient rebut-\ntal\u201d to Irwin\u2019s presumption. 552 U. S., at 138. There is no\nprincipled way to distinguish this case. Section 2401(b)\nallows no equitable tolling.\n                              III\n   The Court\u2019s contrary conclusion is wrong at every step.\nIn its view, \u00a72401(b)\u2019s statutory text is \u201cmundane\u201d lan-\nguage that \u201c \u2018reads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute\nof limitations.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8. But \u201cordinary\u201d nonjurisdic-\ntional time limits are typically directed at claimants. The\ndeadline in Henderson, for example, required that \u201ca\nperson adversely affected by [a Board of Veterans\u2019 Ap-\npeals] decision shall file a notice of appeal . . . within 120\ndays after\u201d the decision. 38 U. S. C. \u00a77266(a) (emphasis\nadded); 562 U. S, at 438. The \u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d limitations\nprovision in Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631, 647 (2010),\nlikewise applied to the \u201cperson\u201d responsible for filing: \u201cA\n1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to\nthe judgment of a State court.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)\n(emphasis added); 560 U. S., at 635. And the provision at\nissue in Irwin was similar, if not an even weaker com-\nmand. It provided that \u201c \u2018[w]ithin thirty days of receipt of\nnotice of final action taken by . . . the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission . . . an employee or applicant for\nemployment . . . may file a civil action.\u2019 \u201d 498 U. S., at 94\n(quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u201316(c) (1998 ed.); emphasis\nadded).\n   Section 2401(b), by contrast, never mentions the claim-\nant, and it is phrased in emphatically absolute terms. It\nsays unequivocally that untimely tort claims against the\nUnited States \u201cshall be forever barred.\u201d Although it does\nnot use the word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d it speaks at least as much\nto the courts (who are \u201cforever barred\u201d from considering\nuntimely claims) as it does to claimants (who are \u201cforever\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   11\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbarred\u201d from bringing stale claims). More important,\nthough, the words in \u00a72401(b) have a well-known meaning\nthat ipse dixit labels cannot overcome.3\n   The majority tells us this \u201cold \u2018ad hoc,\u2019 law-by-law ap-\nproach\u201d\u2014also known as statutory interpretation\u2014has been\nreplaced with a broad presumption in favor of equitable\ntolling and a judicial preference against jurisdictional\nlabels. Ante, at 4. I dispute the premise. But in any\nevent, as I explained above, and as six Members of the\ncurrent Court held in John R. Sand & Gravel, the over-\nwhelming evidence of congressional intent here easily\novertakes Irwin\u2019s rebuttable presumption. Even if we\nwould rather not call \u00a72401(b)\u2019s deadlines \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d\nwith all that label entails, we must nonetheless recognize\nthat Congress never meant to allow equitable tolling.\n   The majority avoids this latter point by declining to give\nit any separate attention. See ante, at 5, n. 2. But we\ncannot conflate the two questions because, though the\nrelevant evidence is the same, the analysis is different. In\nparticular, the majority is wrong to rely on Irwin when\nassessing the jurisdictional question, which is the only\nquestion it really decides. We do not indulge Irwin\u2019s pre-\nsumption when determining whether a requirement is\njurisdictional. Instead, we typically invoke Irwin only\nafter finding that a requirement is not jurisdictional, to\ndecide whether Congress nonetheless intended to prohibit\nequitable tolling. In Henderson, for instance, we never\nmentioned Irwin because the parties did not ask us to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  majority relies on the fact that we have allowed equitable toll-\ning under \u201cforever barred\u201d language in the Clayton Act. See ante, at 10.\nBut there is no evidence that Congress meant to import that statute\u2019s\nterms into the FTCA. Nor does the Clayton Act involve the waiver of\nsovereign immunity for money damages against the Government. The\nTucker Act, by contrast, was clearly the blueprint for the FTCA\u2019s time\nbar, it did involve a waiver of sovereign immunity, and our cases have\nuniformly held that its language is not subject to equitable tolling.\n12             UNITED STATES v. KWAI FUN WONG\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\naddress whether the rule was \u201csubject to equitable tolling\nif it [was] not jurisdictional.\u201d 562 U. S., at 442, n. 4.\nLikewise, in Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007), we\nheld that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is juris-\ndictional, without a word about Irwin.4 In Sebelius v.\nAuburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___,\n___\u2013___, (2013) (slip op., at 6\u20137, 11\u201313), we considered\nIrwin only after deciding that a deadline was not jurisdic-\ntional. And in Holland, we held that the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\u2019s time limits are\nnot jurisdictional, without relying on Irwin, and then\nstated that \u201c[w]e have previously made clear that a nonju-\nrisdictional federal statute of limitations is normally\nsubject to a \u2018rebuttable presumption\u2019 in favor \u2018of equitable\ntolling.\u2019 \u201d 560 U. S., at 645\u2013646 (quoting Irwin, supra, at\n95\u201396) (emphasis deleted); cf. Young v. United States, 535\nU. S. 43, 49\u201350 (2002) (invoking Irwin after concluding\nthat a limitations period was not a \u201csubstantive\u201d compo-\nnent of the Bankruptcy Code).5 This error matters be-\ncause the majority\u2019s jurisdictional analysis literally begins\nand ends with Irwin, see ante, at 4\u20135, 18, and thus relies\non a presumption that should have no bearing on the\nquestion. Without that presumption, the majority could\nnot so readily ignore the unmistakable evidence that\n\u00a72401(b)\u2019s limits are jurisdictional.\n                         *    *     *\n  For these reasons, I would hold that \u00a72401(b) does not allow\nequitable tolling, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Even the dissent in Bowles recognized Irwin\u2019s irrelevance: It cited\n\nthe decision only when discussing equitable exceptions to nonjurisdic-\ntional statutes of limitations. 551 U. S., at 219 (opinion of Souter, J.).\n   5 We considered Irwin in John R. Sand & Gravel while holding that\n\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72501\u2019s time limits are jurisdictional. But we did so only to\nreject the suggestion that Irwin compelled a contrary result. So there,\ntoo, Irwin\u2019s presumption did not influence the jurisdictional question.\nNor did it influence the outcome in Irwin itself, where we held that\nequitable tolling was not available.
