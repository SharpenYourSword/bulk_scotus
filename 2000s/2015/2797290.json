FLORIDA BAR\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA\n\n    No. 13\u20131499. Argued January 20, 2015\u2014Decided April 29, 2015\nFlorida is one of 39 States where voters elect judges at the polls. To\n  promote public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary, the Florida\n  Supreme Court adopted Canon 7C(1) of its Code of Judicial Conduct,\n  which provides that judicial candidates \u201cshall not personally solicit\n  campaign funds . . . but may establish committees of responsible per-\n  sons\u201d to raise money for election campaigns.\n     Petitioner Lanell Williams-Yulee (Yulee) mailed and posted online\n  a letter soliciting financial contributions to her campaign for judicial\n  office. The Florida Bar disciplined her for violating a Florida Bar\n  Rule requiring candidates to comply with Canon 7C(1), but Yulee\n  contended that the First Amendment protects a judicial candidate\u2019s\n  right to personally solicit campaign funds in an election. The Florida\n  Supreme Court upheld the disciplinary sanctions, concluding that\n  Canon 7C(1) is narrowly tailored to serve the State\u2019s compelling in-\n  terest.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n138 So. 3d 379, affirmed.\n    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court, except\n  as to Part II, concluding that the First Amendment permits Canon\n  7C(1)\u2019s ban on the personal solicitation of campaign funds by judicial\n  candidates. Pp. 8\u201322.\n    (a) Florida\u2019s interest in preserving public confidence in the integri-\n  ty of its judiciary is compelling. The State may conclude that judges,\n  charged with exercising strict neutrality and independence, cannot\n  supplicate campaign donors without diminishing public confidence in\n  judicial integrity. Simply put, the public may lack confidence in a\n  judge\u2019s ability to administer justice without fear or favor if he comes\n  to office by asking for favors. This Court\u2019s precedents have recog-\n  nized the \u201cvital state interest\u201d in safeguarding \u201c \u2018public confidence in\n2                  WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the fairness and integrity of the nation\u2019s elected judges,\u2019 \u201d Caperton v.\n    A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. 868, 889. Unlike the legislature or\n    the executive, the judiciary \u201chas no influence over either the sword or\n    the purse,\u201d Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (A. Hamilton), so its authority\n    depends in large measure on the public\u2019s willingness to respect and\n    follow its decisions. Public perception of judicial integrity is accord-\n    ingly \u201c \u2018a state interest of the highest order.\u2019 \u201d 556 U. S., at 889.\n       A State\u2019s interest in preserving public confidence in the integrity of\n    its judiciary extends beyond its interest in preventing the appearance\n    of corruption in legislative and executive elections, because a judge\u2019s\n    role differs from that of a politician. Republican Party of Minn. v.\n    White, 536 U. S. 765, 783. Unlike a politician, who is expected to be\n    appropriately responsive to the preferences of supporters, a judge in\n    deciding cases may not follow the preferences of his supporters or\n    provide any special consideration to his campaign donors. As in\n    White, therefore, precedents applying the First Amendment to politi-\n    cal elections have little bearing on the issues here.\n       The vast majority of elected judges in States allowing personal so-\n    licitation serve with fairness and honor, but in the eyes of the public,\n    a judicial candidate\u2019s personal solicitation could result (even unknow-\n    ingly) in \u201ca possible temptation . . . which might lead him not to hold\n    the balance nice, clear and true.\u201d Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 532.\n    That risk is especially pronounced where most donors are lawyers\n    and litigants who may appear before the judge they are supporting.\n    In short, it is the regrettable but unavoidable appearance that judges\n    who personally ask for money may diminish their integrity that\n    prompted the Supreme Court of Florida and most other States to sev-\n    er the direct link between judicial candidates and campaign contribu-\n    tors. Pp. 9\u201312.\n       (b) Canon 7C(1) raises no fatal underinclusivity concerns. The so-\n    licitation ban aims squarely at the conduct most likely to undermine\n    public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary: personal requests\n    for money by judges and judicial candidates. The Canon applies ev-\n    enhandedly to all judges and judicial candidates, regardless of view-\n    point or means of solicitation. And unlike some laws that have been\n    found impermissibly underinclusive, Canon 7C(1) is not riddled with\n    exceptions.\n       Yulee relies heavily on the provision of Canon 7C(1) that allows so-\n    licitation by a candidate\u2019s campaign committee. But Florida, along\n    with most other States, has reasonably concluded that solicitation by\n    the candidate personally creates a categorically different and more\n    severe risk of undermining public confidence than does solicitation by\n    a campaign committee. When the judicial candidate himself asks for\n    money, the stakes are higher for all involved. A judicial candidate\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nasking for money places his name and reputation behind the request,\nand the solicited individual knows that the same person who signed\nthe fundraising letter might one day sign the judgment. This dynam-\nic inevitably creates pressure for the recipient to comply, in a way\nthat solicitation by a third party does not. Just as inevitably, the\npersonal involvement of the candidate in the solicitation creates the\npublic appearance that the candidate will remember who says yes,\nand who says no. However similar the two solicitations may be in\nsubstance, a State may conclude that they present markedly different\nappearances to the public.\n   Permitting a judicial candidate to write thank you notes to cam-\npaign donors likewise does not detract from the State\u2019s interest in\npreserving public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. The\nState\u2019s compelling interest is implicated most directly by the candi-\ndate\u2019s personal solicitation itself. A failure to ban thank you notes for\ncontributions not solicited by the candidate does not undercut the\nBar\u2019s rationale.\n   In addition, the State has a good reason for allowing candidates to\nwrite thank you notes and raise money through committees. These\naccommodations reflect Florida\u2019s effort to respect the First Amend-\nment interests of candidates and their contributors\u2014to resolve the\n\u201cfundamental tension between the ideal character of the judicial of-\nfice and the real world of electoral politics.\u201d Chisom v. Roemer, 501\nU. S. 380, 400. The State should not be punished for leaving open\nmore, rather than fewer, avenues of expression, especially when\nthere is no indication of a pretextual motive for the selective re-\nstriction of speech. Pp. 12\u201316.\n   (c) Canon 7C(1) is also not overinclusive. By any measure, it re-\nstricts a narrow slice of speech. It leaves judicial candidates free to\ndiscuss any issue with any person at any time; to write letters, give\nspeeches, and put up billboards; to contact potential supporters in\nperson, on the phone, or online; and to promote their campaigns\nthrough the media. Though they cannot ask for money, they can di-\nrect their campaign committees to do so.\n   Yulee concedes that Canon 7C(1) is valid in numerous applications,\nbut she contends that the Canon cannot constitutionally be applied to\nher chosen form of solicitation: a letter posted online and distributed\nvia mass mailing. This argument misperceives the breadth of the\ncompelling interest underlying Canon 7C(1). Florida has reasonably\ndetermined that personal appeals for money by a judicial candidate\ninherently create an appearance of impropriety that may cause the\npublic to lose confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. That inter-\nest may be implicated to varying degrees in particular contexts, but\nthe interest remains whenever the public perceives the judge person-\n4                 WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ally asking for money. Canon 7C(1) must be narrowly tailored, not\n    \u201cperfectly tailored.\u201d Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 209. The\n    First Amendment does not confine a State to addressing evils in their\n    most acute form. Here, Florida has concluded that all personal solici-\n    tations by judicial candidates create a public appearance that un-\n    dermines confidence in the integrity of the judiciary; banning all per-\n    sonal solicitations by judicial candidates is narrowly tailored to\n    address that concern.\n      Yulee errs in contending that Florida can accomplish its compelling\n    interest through recusal rules and campaign contribution limits. A\n    rule requiring recusal in every case in which a lawyer or litigant\n    made a campaign contribution would disable many jurisdictions, and\n    a flood of postelection recusal motions could exacerbate the very ap-\n    pearance problem the State is trying to solve. As for contribution\n    limits, Florida already applies them to judicial elections, and this\n    Court has never held that adopting such limits precludes a State\n    from pursuing its compelling interests through additional means.\n      The desirability of judicial elections is a question that has sparked\n    disagreement for more than 200 years, but it is not the Court\u2019s place\n    to resolve that enduring debate. The Court\u2019s limited task is to apply\n    the Constitution to the question presented in this case. Judicial can-\n    didates have a First Amendment right to speak in support of their\n    campaigns. States have a compelling interest in preserving public\n    confidence in their judiciaries. When the State adopts a narrowly tai-\n    lored restriction like the one at issue here, those principles do not\n    conflict. A State\u2019s decision to elect judges does not compel it to com-\n    promise public confidence in their integrity. Pp. 16\u201322.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

The Constitution permits States to make a\ndifferent choice, and most of them have done so. In 39\nStates, voters elect trial or appellate judges at the polls.\nIn an effort to preserve public confidence in the integrity\nof their judiciaries, many of those States prohibit judges\nand judicial candidates from personally soliciting funds for\ntheir campaigns. We must decide whether the First\nAmendment permits such restrictions on speech.\n  We hold that it does. Judges are not politicians, even\nwhen they come to the bench by way of the ballot. And a\nState\u2019s decision to elect its judiciary does not compel it to\ntreat judicial candidates like campaigners for political\noffice. A State may assure its people that judges will\napply the law without fear or favor\u2014and without having\npersonally asked anyone for money. We affirm the judg-\nment of the Florida Supreme Court.\n2             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   When Florida entered the Union in 1845, its Constitu-\ntion provided for trial and appellate judges to be elected by\nthe General Assembly. Florida soon followed more than a\ndozen of its sister States in transferring authority to elect\njudges to the voting public. See J. Shugerman, The Peo-\nple\u2019s Courts: Pursuing Judicial Independence in America\n103\u2013122 (2012). The experiment did not last long in the\nSunshine State. The war came, and Florida\u2019s 1868 Consti-\ntution returned judicial selection to the political branches.\nOver time, however, the people reclaimed the power to\nelect the state bench: Supreme Court justices in 1885 and\ntrial court judges in 1942. See Little, An Overview of the\nHistorical Development of the Judicial Article of the Flor-\nida Constitution, 19 Stetson L. Rev. 1, 40 (1989).\n   In the early 1970s, four Florida Supreme Court justices\nresigned from office following corruption scandals. Florida\nvoters responded by amending their Constitution again.\nUnder the system now in place, appellate judges are ap-\npointed by the Governor from a list of candidates proposed\nby a nominating committee\u2014a process known as \u201cmerit\nselection.\u201d Then, every six years, voters decide whether to\nretain incumbent appellate judges for another term. Trial\njudges are still elected by popular vote, unless the local\njurisdiction opts instead for merit selection. Fla. Const.,\nArt. V, \u00a710; Hawkins, Perspective on Judicial Merit Reten-\ntion in Florida, 64 Fla. L. Rev. 1421, 1423\u20131428 (2012).\n   Amid the corruption scandals of the 1970s, the Florida\nSupreme Court adopted a new Code of Judicial Conduct.\n281 So. 2d 21 (1973). In its present form, the first sen-\ntence of Canon 1 reads, \u201cAn independent and honorable\njudiciary is indispensable to justice in our society.\u201d Code of\nJudicial Conduct for the State of Florida 6 (2014). Canon 1\ninstructs judges to observe \u201chigh standards of conduct\u201d so\nthat \u201cthe integrity and independence of the judiciary may\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Canon 2 directs that a judge \u201cshall\nact at all times in a manner that promotes public confi-\ndence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\nId., at 7. Other provisions prohibit judges from lending\nthe prestige of their offices to private interests, engaging\nin certain business transactions, and personally partici-\npating in soliciting funds for nonprofit organizations.\nCanons 2B, 5C(3)(b)(i), 5D; id., at 7, 23, 24.\n  Canon 7C(1) governs fundraising in judicial elections.\nThe Canon, which is based on a provision in the Ameri-\ncan Bar Association\u2019s Model Code of Judicial Conduct,\nprovides:\n     \u201cA candidate, including an incumbent judge, for a ju-\n    dicial office that is filled by public election between\n    competing candidates shall not personally solicit cam-\n    paign funds, or solicit attorneys for publicly stated\n    support, but may establish committees of responsible\n    persons to secure and manage the expenditure of\n    funds for the candidate\u2019s campaign and to obtain pub-\n    lic statements of support for his or her candidacy.\n    Such committees are not prohibited from soliciting\n    campaign contributions and public support from any\n    person or corporation authorized by law.\u201d Id., at 38.\n  Florida statutes impose additional restrictions on cam-\npaign fundraising in judicial elections. Contributors may\nnot donate more than $1,000 per election to a trial court\ncandidate or more than $3,000 per retention election to a\nSupreme Court justice. Fla. Stat. \u00a7106.08(1)(a) (2014).\nCampaign committee treasurers must file periodic reports\ndisclosing the names of contributors and the amount of\neach contribution. \u00a7106.07.\n  Judicial candidates can seek guidance about campaign\nethics rules from the Florida Judicial Ethics Advisory\nCommittee.

An Aid to\nUnderstanding Canon 7, pp. 51\u201358 (2014).\n   Like Florida, most other States prohibit judicial candi-\ndates from soliciting campaign funds personally, but allow\nthem to raise money through committees. According to\nthe American Bar Association, 30 of the 39 States that\nelect trial or appellate judges have adopted restrictions\nsimilar to Canon 7C(1). Brief for American Bar Associa-\ntion as Amicus Curiae 4.\n                              B\n  Lanell Williams-Yulee, who refers to herself as Yulee,\nhas practiced law in Florida since 1991. In September\n2009, she decided to run for a seat on the county court for\nHillsborough County, a jurisdiction of about 1.3 million\npeople that includes the city of Tampa. Shortly after filing\npaperwork to enter the race, Yulee drafted a letter an-\nnouncing her candidacy. The letter described her experi-\nence and desire to \u201cbring fresh ideas and positive solutions\nto the Judicial bench.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a. The\nletter then stated:\n    \u201cAn early contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250, or\n    $500, made payable to \u2018Lanell Williams-Yulee Cam-\n    paign for County Judge\u2019, will help raise the initial\n    funds needed to launch the campaign and get our\n    message out to the public.

She\nalso posted the letter on her campaign Web site.\n  Yulee\u2019s bid for the bench did not unfold as she had\nhoped. She lost the primary to the incumbent judge.\nThen the Florida Bar filed a complaint against her. As\nrelevant here, the Bar charged her with violating Rule 4\u2013\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n8.2(b) of the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar. That Rule\nrequires judicial candidates to comply with applicable\nprovisions of Florida\u2019s Code of Judicial Conduct, including\nthe ban on personal solicitation of campaign funds in\nCanon 7C(1).\n  Yulee admitted that she had signed and sent the fund-\nraising letter. But she argued that the Bar could not\ndiscipline her for that conduct because the First Amend-\nment protects a judicial candidate\u2019s right to solicit cam-\npaign funds in an election.* The Florida Supreme Court\nappointed a referee, who held a hearing and recommended\na finding of guilt. As a sanction, the referee recommended\nthat Yulee be publicly reprimanded and ordered to pay the\ncosts of the proceeding ($1,860). App. to Pet. for Cert.\n19a\u201325a.\n  The Florida Supreme Court adopted the referee\u2019s rec-\nommendations. 138 So. 3d 379 (2014). The court ex-\nplained that Canon 7C(1) \u201cclearly restricts a judicial can-\ndidate\u2019s speech\u201d and therefore must be \u201cnarrowly tailored\nto serve a compelling state interest.\u201d Id., at 384. The\ncourt held that the Canon satisfies that demanding in-\nquiry. First, the court reasoned, prohibiting judicial can-\ndidates from personally soliciting funds furthers Florida\u2019s\ncompelling interest in \u201cpreserving the integrity of [its]\njudiciary and maintaining the public\u2019s confidence in an\nimpartial judiciary.\u201d     Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted; alteration in original). In the court\u2019s view, \u201cper-\nsonal solicitation of campaign funds, even by mass mail-\ning, raises an appearance of impropriety and calls into\nquestion, in the public\u2019s mind, the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d\nId., at 385. Second, the court concluded that Canon 7C(1)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Yulee also contended that she had not violated Canon 7C(1), which\napplies to \u201ca judicial office that is filled by public election between\ncompeting candidates,\u201d because the incumbent judge had not declared\nhis campaign for reelection at the time she sent her solicitation letter.\nShe has since abandoned that argument.\n6             WILLIAMS-YULEE v.

S. ___ (2014).\n                              II\n   The First Amendment provides that Congress \u201cshall\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d The\nFourteenth Amendment makes that prohibition applicable\nto the States. Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359, 368\n(1931). The parties agree that Canon 7C(1) restricts\nYulee\u2019s speech on the basis of its content by prohibiting\nher from soliciting contributions to her election campaign.\nThe parties disagree, however, about the level of scrutiny\nthat should govern our review.\n   We have applied exacting scrutiny to laws restricting\nthe solicitation of contributions to charity, upholding the\nspeech limitations only if they are narrowly tailored to\nserve a compelling interest. See Riley v. National Federa\u00ad\ntion of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 798 (1988); id.,\nat 810 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).

Applying a lesser standard of scrutiny to such\nspeech would threaten \u201cthe exercise of rights so vital to\nthe maintenance of democratic institutions.\u201d Schneider v.\nState (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 161 (1939).\n   The principles underlying these charitable solicitation\ncases apply with even greater force here. Before asking\nfor money in her fundraising letter, Yulee explained her\nfitness for the bench and expressed her vision for the\njudiciary. Her stated purpose for the solicitation was to\nget her \u201cmessage out to the public.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n32a. As we have long recognized, speech about public\nissues and the qualifications of candidates for elected\noffice commands the highest level of First Amendment\nprotection. See Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic\nCentral Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989). Indeed, in our\nonly prior case concerning speech restrictions on a candi-\ndate for judicial office, this Court and both parties as-\nsumed that strict scrutiny applied. Republican Party of\nMinn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765, 774 (2002).\n   Although the Florida Supreme Court upheld Canon\n7C(1) under strict scrutiny, the Florida Bar and several\namici contend that we should subject the Canon to a more\npermissive standard: that it be \u201cclosely drawn\u201d to match a\n\u201csufficiently important interest.\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424\nU. S. 1, 25 (1976) (per curiam). The \u201cclosely drawn\u201d\nstandard is a poor fit for this case. The Court adopted\nthat test in Buckley to address a claim that campaign\ncontribution limits violated a contributor\u2019s \u201cfreedom of\npolitical association.\u201d Id., at 24\u201325. Here, Yulee does not\nclaim that Canon 7C(1) violates her right to free associa-\ntion; she argues that it violates her right to free speech.\nAnd the Florida Bar can hardly dispute that the Canon\ninfringes Yulee\u2019s freedom to discuss candidates and public\n8             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nissues\u2014namely, herself and her qualifications to be a\njudge. The Bar\u2019s call to import the \u201cclosely drawn\u201d test\nfrom the contribution limit context into a case about solici-\ntation therefore has little avail.\n  As several of the Bar\u2019s amici note, we applied the \u201cclosely\ndrawn\u201d test to solicitation restrictions in McConnell v.\nFederal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93, 136 (2003), over-\nruled in part by Citizens United v. Federal Election\nComm\u2019n, 558 U. S. 310 (2010). But the Court in that case\ndetermined that the solicitation restrictions operated\nprimarily to prevent circumvention of the contribution\nlimits, which were the subject of the \u201cclosely drawn\u201d test\nin the first place. 540 U. S., at 138\u2013139. McConnell offers\nno help to the Bar here, because Florida did not adopt\nCanon 7C(1) as an anticircumvention measure.\n  In sum, we hold today what we assumed in White: A\nState may restrict the speech of a judicial candidate only if\nthe restriction is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\ninterest.\n                             III\n  The Florida Bar faces a demanding task in defending\nCanon 7C(1) against Yulee\u2019s First Amendment challenge.\nWe have emphasized that \u201cit is the rare case\u201d in which a\nState demonstrates that a speech restriction is narrowly\ntailored to serve a compelling interest. Burson v. Free\u00ad\nman, 504 U. S. 191, 211 (1992) (plurality opinion). But\nthose cases do arise. See ibid.; Holder v. Humanitarian\nLaw Project, 561 U. S. 1, 25\u201339 (2010); McConnell, 540\nU. S., at 314 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.); cf. Adarand Con\u00ad\nstructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 237 (1995) (\u201cwe wish\nto dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is \u2018strict in theory,\nbut fatal in fact\u2019 \u201d). Here, Canon 7C(1) advances the\nState\u2019s compelling interest in preserving public confidence\nin the integrity of the judiciary, and it does so through\nmeans narrowly tailored to avoid unnecessarily abridging\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nspeech. This is therefore one of the rare cases in which a\nspeech restriction withstands strict scrutiny.\n                              A\n  The Florida Supreme Court adopted Canon 7C(1) to\npromote the State\u2019s interests in \u201cprotecting the integrity of\nthe judiciary\u201d and \u201cmaintaining the public\u2019s confidence in\nan impartial judiciary.\u201d 138 So. 3d, at 385. The way the\nCanon advances those interests is intuitive: Judges,\ncharged with exercising strict neutrality and independ-\nence, cannot supplicate campaign donors without dimin-\nishing public confidence in judicial integrity. This princi-\nple dates back at least eight centuries to Magna Carta,\nwhich proclaimed, \u201cTo no one will we sell, to no one will\nwe refuse or delay, right or justice.\u201d Cl. 40 (1215), in W.\nMcKechnie, Magna Carta, A Commentary on the Great\nCharter of King John 395 (2d ed. 1914). The same concept\nunderlies the common law judicial oath, which binds a\njudge to \u201cdo right to all manner of people . . . without fear\nor favour, affection or ill-will,\u201d 10 Encyclopaedia of the\nLaws of England 105 (2d ed. 1908), and the oath that each\nof us took to \u201cadminister justice without respect to per-\nsons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich,\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7453. Simply put, Florida and most other States\nhave concluded that the public may lack confidence in a\njudge\u2019s ability to administer justice without fear or favor if\nhe comes to office by asking for favors.\n  The interest served by Canon 7C(1) has firm support in\nour precedents. We have recognized the \u201cvital state inter-\nest\u201d in safeguarding \u201cpublic confidence in the fairness and\nintegrity of the nation\u2019s elected judges.\u201d Caperton v. A. T.\nMassey Coal Co., 556 U. S. 868, 889 (2009) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted). The importance of public confi-\ndence in the integrity of judges stems from the place of\nthe judiciary in the government. Unlike the executive or the\nlegislature, the judiciary \u201chas no influence over either the\n10            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsword or the purse; . . . neither force nor will but merely\njudgment.\u201d The Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (C. Rossiter ed.\n1961) (A. Hamilton) (capitalization altered). The judici-\nary\u2019s authority therefore depends in large measure on the\npublic\u2019s willingness to respect and follow its decisions. As\nJustice Frankfurter once put it for the Court, \u201cjustice must\nsatisfy the appearance of justice.\u201d Offutt v. United States,\n348 U. S. 11, 14 (1954). It follows that public perception of\njudicial integrity is \u201ca state interest of the highest order.\u201d\nCaperton, 556 U. S., at 889 (quoting White, 536 U. S., at\n793 (KENNEDY, J., concurring)).\n   The principal dissent observes that bans on judicial\ncandidate solicitation lack a lengthy historical pedigree.\nPost, at 1\u20132 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). We do not dispute that\nfact, but it has no relevance here. As the precedent cited\nby the principal dissent demonstrates, a history and tradi-\ntion of regulation are important factors in determining\nwhether to recognize \u201cnew categories of unprotected\nspeech.\u201d Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3); see post, at 1. But\nnobody argues that solicitation of campaign funds by\njudicial candidates is a category of unprotected speech. As\nexplained above, the First Amendment fully applies to\nYulee\u2019s speech. The question is instead whether that\nAmendment permits the particular regulation of speech at\nissue here.\n   The parties devote considerable attention to our cases\nanalyzing campaign finance restrictions in political elec-\ntions. But a State\u2019s interest in preserving public confi-\ndence in the integrity of its judiciary extends beyond its\ninterest in preventing the appearance of corruption in\nlegislative and executive elections. As we explained in\nWhite, States may regulate judicial elections differently\nthan they regulate political elections, because the role of\njudges differs from the role of politicians. 536 U. S., at\n783; id., at 805 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). Politicians are\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpected to be appropriately responsive to the preferences\nof their supporters. Indeed, such \u201cresponsiveness is key to\nthe very concept of self-governance through elected offi-\ncials.\u201d McCutcheon v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 572 U. S.\n___, ___ (2014) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 39). The\nsame is not true of judges. In deciding cases, a judge is\nnot to follow the preferences of his supporters, or provide\nany special consideration to his campaign donors. A judge\ninstead must \u201cobserve the utmost fairness,\u201d striving to be\n\u201cperfectly and completely independent, with nothing to\ninfluence or controul him but God and his conscience.\u201d\nAddress of John Marshall, in Proceedings and Debates of\nthe Virginia State Convention of 1829\u20131830, p. 616 (1830).\nAs in White, therefore, our precedents applying the First\nAmendment to political elections have little bearing on the\nissues here.\n   The vast majority of elected judges in States that allow\npersonal solicitation serve with fairness and honor. But\n\u201c[e]ven if judges were able to refrain from favoring donors,\nthe mere possibility that judges\u2019 decisions may be moti-\nvated by the desire to repay campaign contributions is\nlikely to undermine the public\u2019s confidence in the judiciary.\u201d\nWhite, 536 U. S., at 790 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). In the\neyes of the public, a judge\u2019s personal solicitation could\nresult (even unknowingly) in \u201ca possible temptation . . .\nwhich might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear\nand true.\u201d Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 532 (1927). That\nrisk is especially pronounced because most donors are\nlawyers and litigants who may appear before the judge\nthey are supporting. See A. Bannon, E. Velasco, L. Casey,\n& L. Reagan, The New Politics of Judicial Elections: 2011\u2013\n12, p. 15 (2013).\n   The concept of public confidence in judicial integrity\ndoes not easily reduce to precise definition, nor does it\nlend itself to proof by documentary record. But no one\ndenies that it is genuine and compelling. In short, it is the\n12            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nregrettable but unavoidable appearance that judges who\npersonally ask for money may diminish their integrity\nthat prompted the Supreme Court of Florida and most\nother States to sever the direct link between judicial can-\ndidates and campaign contributors. As the Supreme\nCourt of Oregon explained, \u201cthe spectacle of lawyers or\npotential litigants directly handing over money to judicial\ncandidates should be avoided if the public is to have faith\nin the impartiality of its judiciary.\u201d In re Fadeley, 310\nOre. 548, 565, 802 P. 2d 31, 41 (1990). Moreover, personal\nsolicitation by a judicial candidate \u201cinevitably places the\nsolicited individuals in a position to fear retaliation if they\nfail to financially support that candidate.\u201d Simes, 368\nArk., at 585, 247 S. W. 3d, at 882. Potential litigants then\nfear that \u201cthe integrity of the judicial system has been\ncompromised, forcing them to search for an attorney in\npart based upon the criteria of which attorneys have made\nthe obligatory contributions.\u201d Ibid. A State\u2019s decision to\nelect its judges does not require it to tolerate these risks.\nThe Florida Bar\u2019s interest is compelling.\n                             B\n  Yulee acknowledges the State\u2019s compelling interest in\njudicial integrity. She argues, however, that the Canon\u2019s\nfailure to restrict other speech equally damaging to judi-\ncial integrity and its appearance undercuts the Bar\u2019s\nposition. In particular, she notes that Canon 7C(1) allows\na judge\u2019s campaign committee to solicit money, which\narguably reduces public confidence in the integrity of the\njudiciary just as much as a judge\u2019s personal solicitation.\nYulee also points out that Florida permits judicial candi-\ndates to write thank you notes to campaign donors, which\nensures that candidates know who contributes and who\ndoes not.\n  It is always somewhat counterintuitive to argue that a\nlaw violates the First Amendment by abridging too little\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nspeech. We have recognized, however, that underinclu-\nsiveness can raise \u201cdoubts about whether the government\nis in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than\ndisfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.\u201d Brown,\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). In a textbook illustration\nof that principle, we invalidated a city\u2019s ban on ritual\nanimal sacrifices because the city failed to regulate vast\nswaths of conduct that similarly diminished its asserted\ninterests in public health and animal welfare. Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 543\u2013\n547 (1993).\n  Underinclusiveness can also reveal that a law does not\nactually advance a compelling interest. For example, a\nState\u2019s decision to prohibit newspapers, but not electronic\nmedia, from releasing the names of juvenile defendants\nsuggested that the law did not advance its stated purpose\nof protecting youth privacy. Smith v. Daily Mail Publish\u00ad\ning Co., 443 U. S. 97, 104\u2013105 (1979).\n  Although a law\u2019s underinclusivity raises a red flag, the\nFirst Amendment imposes no freestanding \u201cunderinclu-\nsiveness limitation.\u201d R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377,\n387 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). A State\nneed not address all aspects of a problem in one fell swoop;\npolicymakers may focus on their most pressing concerns.\nWe have accordingly upheld laws\u2014even under strict\nscrutiny\u2014that conceivably could have restricted even\ngreater amounts of speech in service of their stated inter-\nests. Burson, 504 U. S., at 207; see McConnell, 540 U. S.,\nat 207\u2013208; Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490,\n511\u2013512 (1981) (plurality opinion); Buckley, 424 U. S., at\n105.\n  Viewed in light of these principles, Canon 7C(1) raises\nno fatal underinclusivity concerns. The solicitation ban\naims squarely at the conduct most likely to undermine\npublic confidence in the integrity of the judiciary: personal\nrequests for money by judges and judicial candidates. The\n14           WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCanon applies evenhandedly to all judges and judicial\ncandidates, regardless of their viewpoint or chosen means\nof solicitation. And unlike some laws that we have found\nimpermissibly underinclusive, Canon 7C(1) is not riddled\nwith exceptions. See City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43,\n52\u201353 (1994). Indeed, the Canon contains zero exceptions\nto its ban on personal solicitation.\n   Yulee relies heavily on the provision of Canon 7C(1) that\nallows solicitation by a candidate\u2019s campaign committee.\nBut Florida, along with most other States, has reasonably\nconcluded that solicitation by the candidate personally\ncreates a categorically different and more severe risk of\nundermining public confidence than does solicitation by a\ncampaign committee. The identity of the solicitor matters,\nas anyone who has encountered a Girl Scout selling cook-\nies outside a grocery store can attest. When the judicial\ncandidate himself asks for money, the stakes are higher\nfor all involved. The candidate has personally invested his\ntime and effort in the fundraising appeal; he has placed\nhis name and reputation behind the request. The solicited\nindividual knows that, and also knows that the solicitor\nmight be in a position to singlehandedly make decisions of\ngreat weight: The same person who signed the fundraising\nletter might one day sign the judgment. This dynamic\ninevitably creates pressure for the recipient to comply, and\nit does so in a way that solicitation by a third party does\nnot. Just as inevitably, the personal involvement of the\ncandidate in the solicitation creates the public appearance\nthat the candidate will remember who says yes, and who\nsays no.\n   In short, personal solicitation by judicial candidates\nimplicates a different problem than solicitation by cam-\npaign committees. However similar the two solicitations\nmay be in substance, a State may conclude that they\npresent markedly different appearances to the public.\nFlorida\u2019s choice to allow solicitation by campaign commit-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntees does not undermine its decision to ban solicitation by\njudges.\n   Likewise, allowing judicial candidates to write thank\nyou notes to campaign donors does not detract from the\nState\u2019s interest in preserving public confidence in the\nintegrity of the judiciary. Yulee argues that permitting\nthank you notes heightens the likelihood of actual bias by\nensuring that judicial candidates know who supported\ntheir campaigns, and ensuring that the supporter knows\nthat the candidate knows. Maybe so. But the State\u2019s\ncompelling interest is implicated most directly by the\ncandidate\u2019s personal solicitation itself. A failure to ban\nthank you notes for contributions not solicited by the\ncandidate does not undercut the Bar\u2019s rationale.\n   In addition, the State has a good reason for allowing\ncandidates to write thank you notes and raise money\nthrough committees. These accommodations reflect Flor-\nida\u2019s effort to respect the First Amendment interests of\ncandidates and their contributors\u2014to resolve the \u201cfunda-\nmental tension between the ideal character of the judicial\noffice and the real world of electoral politics.\u201d Chisom v.\nRoemer, 501 U. S. 380, 400 (1991). They belie the princi-\npal dissent\u2019s suggestion that Canon 7C(1) reflects general\n\u201chostility toward judicial campaigning\u201d and has \u201cnothing\nto do with the appearances created by judges\u2019 asking for\nmoney.\u201d Post, at 11. Nothing?\n   The principal dissent also suggests that Canon 7C(1) is\nunderinclusive because Florida does not ban judicial can-\ndidates from asking individuals for personal gifts or loans.\nPost, at 10. But Florida law treats a personal \u201cgift\u201d or\n\u201cloan\u201d as a campaign contribution if the donor makes it\n\u201cfor the purpose of influencing the results of an election,\u201d\nFla. Stat. \u00a7106.011(5)(a), and Florida\u2019s Judicial Qualifica-\ntions Commission has determined that a judicial candi-\ndate violates Canon 7C(1) by personally soliciting such a\nloan. See In re Turner, 76 So. 3d 898, 901\u2013902 (Fla. 2011).\n16            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nIn any event, Florida can ban personal solicitation of\ncampaign funds by judicial candidates without making\nthem obey a comprehensive code to leading an ethical life.\nUnderinclusivity creates a First Amendment concern\nwhen the State regulates one aspect of a problem while\ndeclining to regulate a different aspect of the problem that\naffects its stated interest in a comparable way. See Flor-\nida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 540 (1989). The princi-\npal dissent offers no basis to conclude that judicial candi-\ndates are in the habit of soliciting personal loans, football\ntickets, or anything of the sort. Post, at 10. Even under\nstrict scrutiny, \u201c[t]he First Amendment does not require\nStates to regulate for problems that do not exist.\u201d Burson,\n504 U. S., at 207 (State\u2019s regulation of political solicitation\naround a polling place, but not charitable or commercial\nsolicitation, was not fatally underinclusive under strict\nscrutiny).\n   Taken to its logical conclusion, the position advanced by\nYulee and the principal dissent is that Florida may ban\nthe solicitation of funds by judicial candidates only if the\nState bans all solicitation of funds in judicial elections.\nThe First Amendment does not put a State to that all-or-\nnothing choice. We will not punish Florida for leaving\nopen more, rather than fewer, avenues of expression,\nespecially when there is no indication that the selective\nrestriction of speech reflects a pretextual motive.\n                            C\n  After arguing that Canon 7C(1) violates the First\nAmendment because it restricts too little speech, Yulee\nargues that the Canon violates the First Amendment\nbecause it restricts too much. In her view, the Canon is\nnot narrowly tailored to advance the State\u2019s compelling\ninterest through the least restrictive means. See United\nStates v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S.\n803, 813 (2000).\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   By any measure, Canon 7C(1) restricts a narrow slice of\nspeech. A reader of JUSTICE KENNEDY\u2019s dissent could be\nforgiven for concluding that the Court has just upheld a\nlatter-day version of the Alien and Sedition Acts, approv-\ning \u201cstate censorship\u201d that \u201clocks the First Amendment\nout,\u201d imposes a \u201cgag\u201d on candidates, and inflicts \u201cdead\nweight\u201d on a \u201csilenced\u201d public debate. Post, at 2\u20134. But in\nreality, Canon 7C(1) leaves judicial candidates free to\ndiscuss any issue with any person at any time. Candi-\ndates can write letters, give speeches, and put up bill-\nboards. They can contact potential supporters in person,\non the phone, or online. They can promote their cam-\npaigns on radio, television, or other media. They cannot\nsay, \u201cPlease give me money.\u201d They can, however, direct\ntheir campaign committees to do so. Whatever else may\nbe said of the Canon, it is surely not a \u201cwildly dispropor-\ntionate restriction upon speech.\u201d Post, at 1 (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting).\n   Indeed, Yulee concedes\u2014and the principal dissent\nseems to agree, post, at 8\u2014that Canon 7C(1) is valid in\nnumerous applications. Yulee acknowledges that Florida\ncan prohibit judges from soliciting money from lawyers\nand litigants appearing before them. Reply Brief 18. In\naddition, she says the State \u201cmight\u201d be able to ban \u201cdirect\none-to-one solicitation of lawyers and individuals or busi-\nnesses that could reasonably appear in the court for which\nthe individual is a candidate.\u201d Ibid. She also suggests\nthat the Bar could forbid \u201cin person\u201d solicitation by judi-\ncial candidates. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; cf. Ohralik v. Ohio\nState Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447 (1978) (permitting State to\nban in person solicitation of clients by lawyers). But Yulee\nargues that the Canon cannot constitutionally be applied\nto her chosen form of solicitation: a letter posted online\nand distributed via mass mailing. No one, she contends,\nwill lose confidence in the integrity of the judiciary based\non personal solicitation to such a broad audience.\n18            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   This argument misperceives the breadth of the compel-\nling interest that underlies Canon 7C(1). Florida has\nreasonably determined that personal appeals for money by\na judicial candidate inherently create an appearance of\nimpropriety that may cause the public to lose confidence in\nthe integrity of the judiciary. That interest may be impli-\ncated to varying degrees in particular contexts, but the\ninterest remains whenever the public perceives the judge\npersonally asking for money.\n   Moreover, the lines Yulee asks us to draw are unwork-\nable. Even under her theory of the case, a mass mailing\nwould create an appearance of impropriety if addressed to\na list of all lawyers and litigants with pending cases. So\nwould a speech soliciting contributions from the 100 most\nfrequently appearing attorneys in the jurisdiction. Yulee\nsays she might accept a ban on one-to-one solicitation, but\nis the public impression really any different if a judicial\ncandidate tries to buttonhole not one prospective donor\nbut two at a time? Ten? Yulee also agrees that in person\nsolicitation creates a problem. But would the public\u2019s\nconcern recede if the request for money came in a phone\ncall or a text message?\n   We decline to wade into this swamp. The First Amend-\nment requires that Canon 7C(1) be narrowly tailored, not\nthat it be \u201cperfectly tailored.\u201d Burson, 504 U. S., at 209.\nThe impossibility of perfect tailoring is especially apparent\nwhen the State\u2019s compelling interest is as intangible as\npublic confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. Yulee is\nof course correct that some personal solicitations raise\ngreater concerns than others. A judge who passes the hat\nin the courthouse creates a more serious appearance of\nimpropriety than does a judicial candidate who makes a\ntasteful plea for support on the radio. But most problems\narise in greater and lesser gradations, and the First\nAmendment does not confine a State to addressing evils in\ntheir most acute form. See id., at 210.

S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconcluded that all personal solicitations by judicial candi-\ndates create a public appearance that undermines confi-\ndence in the integrity of the judiciary; banning all personal\nsolicitations by judicial candidates is narrowly tailored to\naddress that concern.\n   In considering Yulee\u2019s tailoring arguments, we are\nmindful that most States with elected judges have deter-\nmined that drawing a line between personal solicitation by\ncandidates and solicitation by committees is necessary to\npreserve public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.\nThese considered judgments deserve our respect, especially\nbecause they reflect sensitive choices by States in an area\ncentral to their own governance\u2014how to select those who\n\u201csit as their judges.\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452,\n460 (1991).\n   Finally, Yulee contends that Florida can accomplish its\ncompelling interest through the less restrictive means of\nrecusal rules and campaign contribution limits. We dis-\nagree. A rule requiring judges to recuse themselves from\nevery case in which a lawyer or litigant made a campaign\ncontribution would disable many jurisdictions. And a\nflood of postelection recusal motions could \u201cerode public\nconfidence in judicial impartiality\u201d and thereby exacerbate\nthe very appearance problem the State is trying to solve.\nCaperton, 556 U. S., at 891 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).\nMoreover, the rule that Yulee envisions could create a\nperverse incentive for litigants to make campaign contri-\nbutions to judges solely as a means to trigger their later\nrecusal\u2014a form of peremptory strike against a judge that\nwould enable transparent forum shopping.\n   As for campaign contribution limits, Florida already\napplies them to judicial elections. Fla. Stat. \u00a7106.08(1)(a).\nA State may decide that the threat to public confidence\ncreated by personal solicitation exists apart from the\namount of money that a judge or judicial candidate seeks.\nEven if Florida decreased its contribution limit, the ap-\n20            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npearance that judges who personally solicit funds might\nimproperly favor their campaign donors would remain.\nAlthough the Court has held that contribution limits\nadvance the interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption\nand its appearance in political elections, we have never\nheld that adopting contribution limits precludes a State\nfrom pursuing its compelling interests through additional\nmeans. And in any event, a State has compelling interests\nin regulating judicial elections that extend beyond its\ninterests in regulating political elections, because judges\nare not politicians.\n   In sum, because Canon 7C(1) is narrowly tailored to\nserve a compelling government interest, the First\nAmendment poses no obstacle to its enforcement in this\ncase. As a result of our decision, Florida may continue to\nprohibit judicial candidates from personally soliciting\ncampaign funds, while allowing them to raise money\nthrough committees and to otherwise communicate their\nelectoral messages in practically any way. The principal\ndissent faults us for not answering a slew of broader ques-\ntions, such as whether Florida may cap a judicial candi-\ndate\u2019s spending or ban independent expenditures by cor-\nporations. Post, at 8\u20139. Yulee has not asked these\nquestions, and for good reason\u2014they are far afield from\nthe narrow regulation actually at issue in this case.\n   We likewise have no cause to consider whether the\ncitizens of States that elect their judges have decided\nanything about the \u201coracular sanctity of judges\u201d or whether\njudges are due \u201ca hearty helping of humble pie.\u201d Post,\nat 12. The principal dissent could be right that the deci-\nsion to adopt judicial elections \u201cprobably springs,\u201d at least\nin part, from a desire to make judges more accountable to\nthe public, ibid., although the history on this matter is\nmore complicated.

Both methods have given our\nNation jurists of wisdom and rectitude who have devoted\nthemselves to maintaining \u201cthe public\u2019s respect . . . and a\nreserve of public goodwill, without becoming subservient\nto public opinion.\u201d Rehnquist, Judicial Independence, 38\nU. Rich. L. Rev. 579, 596 (2004).\n   It is not our place to resolve this enduring debate. Our\nlimited task is to apply the Constitution to the question\npresented in this case. Judicial candidates have a First\nAmendment right to speak in support of their campaigns.\nStates have a compelling interest in preserving public\nconfidence in their judiciaries.

Addressing the Government\u2019s\nasserted interest in preventing \u201cinfluence over or access to\nelected officials,\u201d id., at 359, the Court observed that\n\u201c[f ]avoritism and influence\u201d are inevitable \u201cin representa-\ntive politics.\u201d Ibid. (quoting McConnell v. Federal Elec-\ntion Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93, 297 (KENNEDY, J., concurring\nin judgment in part and dissenting in part); emphasis\nadded). A plurality of the Court responded similarly in\nMcCutcheon v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 572 U.

But even if one agrees with\nthose judgments, they are geared to elections for repre-\nsentative posts, and should have \u201clittle bearing\u201d on judicial\nelections.

S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nFirst Amendment exists.\n   Because Canon 7C(1) restricts fully protected speech on\nthe basis of content, it presumptively violates the First\nAmendment. We may uphold it only if the State meets its\nburden of showing that the Canon survives strict scru-\ntiny\u2014that is to say, only if it shows that the Canon is nar-\nrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. I do not for a\nmoment question the Court\u2019s conclusion that States have\ndifferent compelling interests when regulating judicial\nelections than when regulating political ones. Unlike a\nlegislator, a judge must be impartial\u2014without bias for or\nagainst any party or attorney who comes before him. I\naccept for the sake of argument that States have a compel-\nling interest in ensuring that its judges are seen to be\nimpartial. I will likewise assume that a judicial candi-\ndate\u2019s request to a litigant or attorney presents a danger\nof coercion that a political candidate\u2019s request to a con-\nstituent does not. But Canon 7C(1) does not narrowly\ntarget concerns about impartiality or its appearance; it ap-\nplies even when the person asked for a financial contribu-\ntion has no chance of ever appearing in the candidate\u2019s\ncourt. And Florida does not invoke concerns about coer-\ncion, presumably because the Canon bans solicitations re-\ngardless of whether their object is a lawyer, litigant, or\nother person vulnerable to judicial pressure. So Canon\n7C(1) fails exacting scrutiny and infringes the First\nAmendment.       This case should have been just that\nstraightforward.\n                              II\n  The Court concludes that Florida may prohibit personal\nsolicitations by judicial candidates as a means of preserv-\ning \u201cpublic confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.\u201d\nAnte, at 8. It purports to reach this destination by\napplying strict scrutiny, but it would be more accurate\nto say that it does so by applying the appearance of strict\n4            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nscrutiny.\n                              A\n   The first sign that mischief is afoot comes when the\nCourt describes Florida\u2019s compelling interest. The State\nmust first identify its objective with precision before one\ncan tell whether that interest is compelling and whether\nthe speech restriction narrowly targets it. In White, for\nexample, the Court did not allow a State to invoke hazy\nconcerns about judicial impartiality in justification of an\nethics rule against judicial candidates\u2019 announcing their\npositions on legal issues. 536 U. S., at 775. The Court\ninstead separately analyzed the State\u2019s concerns about\njudges\u2019 bias against parties, preconceptions on legal is-\nsues, and openmindedness, and explained why each con-\ncern (and each for a different reason) did not suffice to\nsustain the rule. Id., at 775\u2013780.\n   In stark contrast to White, the Court today relies on\nFlorida\u2019s invocation of an ill-defined interest in \u201cpublic\nconfidence in judicial integrity.\u201d The Court at first sug-\ngests that \u201cjudicial integrity\u201d involves the \u201cability to ad-\nminister justice without fear or favor.\u201d Ante, at 9. As its\nopinion unfolds, however, today\u2019s concept of judicial integ-\nrity turns out to be \u201ca mere thing of wax in the hands of\nthe judiciary, which they may twist, and shape into any\nform they please.\u201d 12 The Works of Thomas Jefferson 137\n(P. Ford ed. 1905). When the Court explains how solicita-\ntion undermines confidence in judicial integrity, integrity\nstarts to sound like saintliness. It involves independence\nfrom any \u201c \u2018possible temptation\u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018might lead\u2019 \u201d the\njudge, \u201ceven unknowingly,\u201d to favor one party. Ante, at 11\n(emphasis added). When the Court turns to distinguish-\ning in-person solicitation from solicitation by proxy, the\nany-possible-temptation standard no longer helps and\nthus drops out. The critical factors instead become the\n\u201cpressure\u201d a listener feels during a solicitation and the\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

But when it comes\ntime to explain Florida\u2019s decision to allow candidates to\nwrite thank-you notes, the \u201cappearance that the candidate\n. . . remember[s] who says yes\u201d gets nary a mention. Ante,\nat 14\u201315. And when the Court confronts Florida\u2019s decision\nto prohibit mass-mailed solicitations, concern about pres-\nsure fades away. Ante, at 18. More outrageous still, the\nCourt at times molds the interest in the perception that\njudges have integrity into an interest in the perception\nthat judges do not solicit\u2014for example when it says, \u201call\npersonal solicitations by judicial candidates create a public\nappearance that undermines confidence in the integrity of\nthe judiciary; banning all personal solicitations by judicial\ncandidates is narrowly tailored to address that concern.\u201d\nAnte, at 19. This is not strict scrutiny; it is sleight of\nhand.\n                              B\n  The Court\u2019s twistifications have not come to an end;\nindeed, they are just beginning. In order to uphold Canon\n7C(1) under strict scrutiny, Florida must do more than\npoint to a vital public objective brooding overhead. The\nState must also meet a difficult burden of demonstrating\nthat the speech restriction substantially advances the\nclaimed objective. The State \u201cbears the risk of uncertainty,\u201d\nso \u201cambiguous proof will not suffice.\u201d Entertainment\nMerchants, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). In an arrest-\ning illustration, this Court held that a law punishing lies\nabout winning military decorations like the Congressional\nMedal of Honor failed exacting scrutiny, because the\nGovernment could not satisfy its \u201cheavy burden\u201d of prov-\ning that \u201cthe public\u2019s general perception of military\nawards is diluted by false claims.\u201d United States v. Alva-\nrez, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (plurality opinion) (slip op.,\nat 14).\n6             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n    Now that we have a case about the public\u2019s perception of\njudicial honor rather than its perception of military hon-\nors, the Justices of this Court change the rules. The Court\nannounces, on the basis of its \u201cintuiti[on],\u201d that allowing\npersonal solicitations will make litigants worry that\n\u201c \u2018judges\u2019 decisions may be motivated by the desire to repay\ncampaign contributions.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 11. But this case is not\nabout whether Yulee has the right to receive campaign\ncontributions. It is about whether she has the right to ask\nfor campaign contributions that Florida\u2019s statutory law\nalready allows her to receive. Florida bears the burden of\nshowing that banning requests for lawful contributions\nwill improve public confidence in judges\u2014not just a little\nbit, but significantly, because \u201cthe Government does not\nhave a compelling interest in each marginal percentage\npoint by which its goals are advanced.\u201d Entertainment\nMerchants, supra, at ___, n. 9 (slip op., at 16, n. 9).\n  Neither the Court nor the State identifies the slightest\nevidence that banning requests for contributions will\nsubstantially improve public trust in judges. Nor does\ncommon sense make this happy forecast obvious. The\nconcept of judicial integrity \u201cdates back at least eight\ncenturies,\u201d ante, at 9, and judicial elections in America\ndate back more than two centuries, supra, at 1\u2014but rules\nagainst personal solicitations date back only to 1972,\nsupra, at 2. The peaceful coexistence of judicial elections\nand personal solicitations for most of our history calls into\ndoubt any claim that allowing personal solicitations would\nimperil public faith in judges. Many States allow judicial\ncandidates to ask for contributions even today, but nobody\nsuggests that public confidence in judges fares worse in\nthese jurisdictions than elsewhere. And in any event, if\ncandidates\u2019 appeals for money are \u201c \u2018characteristically\nintertwined\u2019 \u201d with discussion of qualifications and views\non public issues, ante, at 7 (plurality opinion), how can the\nCourt be so sure that the public will regard them as im-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nproprieties rather than as legitimate instances of cam-\npaigning? In the final analysis, Florida comes nowhere\nnear making the convincing demonstration required by\nour cases that the speech restriction in this case substan-\ntially advances its objective.\n                               C\n   But suppose we play along with the premise that pro-\nhibiting solicitations will significantly improve the public\nreputation of judges. Even then, Florida must show that\nthe ban restricts no more speech than necessary to achieve\nthe objective. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.\nFCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989).\n   Canon 7C(1) falls miles short of satisfying this require-\nment. The Court seems to accept Florida\u2019s claim that\nsolicitations erode public confidence by creating the per-\nception that judges are selling justice to lawyers and\nlitigants. Ante, at 9. Yet the Canon prohibits candidates\nfrom asking for money from anybody\u2014even from someone\nwho is neither lawyer nor litigant, even from someone who\n(because of recusal rules) cannot possibly appear before\nthe candidate as lawyer or litigant. Yulee thus may not\ncall up an old friend, a cousin, or even her parents to ask\nfor a donation to her campaign. The State has not come\nup with a plausible explanation of how soliciting someone\nwho has no chance of appearing in the candidate\u2019s court\nwill diminish public confidence in judges.\n   No less important, Canon 7C(1) bans candidates from\nasking for contributions even in messages that do not\ntarget any listener in particular\u2014mass-mailed letters,\nflyers posted on telephone poles, speeches to large gather-\nings, and Web sites addressed to the general public. Mes-\nsages like these do not share the features that lead the\nCourt to pronounce personal solicitations a menace to\npublic confidence in the judiciary. Consider online solici-\ntations. They avoid \u201c \u2018the spectacle of lawyers or potential\n8             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nlitigants directly handing over money to judicial candi-\ndates,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 12. People who come across online solici-\ntations do not feel \u201cpressure\u201d to comply with the request,\nante, at 14. Nor does the candidate\u2019s signature on the\nonline solicitation suggest \u201cthat the candidate will re-\nmember who says yes, and who says no,\u201d ibid. Yet Canon\n7C(1) prohibits these and similar solicitations anyway.\nThis tailoring is as narrow as the Court\u2019s scrutiny is strict.\n   Perhaps sensing the fragility of the initial claim that all\nsolicitations threaten public confidence in judges, the\nCourt argues that \u201cthe lines Yulee asks [it] to draw are\nunworkable.\u201d Ante, at 18. That is a difficulty of the\nCourt\u2019s own imagination. In reality, the Court could have\nchosen from a whole spectrum of workable rules. It could\nhave held that States may regulate no more than solicita-\ntion of participants in pending cases, or solicitation of\npeople who are likely to appear in the candidate\u2019s court, or\neven solicitation of any lawyer or litigant. And it could\nhave ruled that candidates have the right to make fund-\nraising appeals that are not directed to any particular\nlistener (like requests in mass-mailed letters), or at least\nfundraising appeals plainly directed to the general public\n(like requests placed online). The Supreme Court of Flor-\nida has made similar accommodations in other settings. It\nallows sitting judges to solicit memberships in civic organ-\nizations if (among other things) the solicitee is not \u201clikely\never to appear before the court on which the judge serves.\u201d\nCode of Judicial Conduct for the State of Florida 23 (2014)\n(Judicial Conduct Code). And it allows sitting judges to\naccept gifts if (among other things) \u201cthe donor is not a\nparty or other person . . . whose interests have come or are\nlikely to come before the judge.\u201d Id., at 24. It is not too\nmuch to ask that the State show election speech similar\nconsideration.\n   The Court\u2019s accusation of unworkability also suffers\nfrom a bit of a pot-kettle problem. Consider the many\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nreal-world questions left open by today\u2019s decision. Does\nthe First Amendment permit restricting a candidate\u2019s\nappearing at an event where somebody else asks for cam-\npaign funds on his behalf? See Florida Judicial Ethics\nAdvisory Committee Opinion No. 2012\u201314 (JEAC Op.).\nDoes it permit prohibiting the candidate\u2019s family from\nmaking personal solicitations? See ibid. Does it allow\nprohibiting the candidate from participating in the crea-\ntion of a Web site that solicits funds, even if the candi-\ndate\u2019s name does not appear next to the request? See\nJEAC Op. No. 2008\u201311. More broadly, could Florida ban\nthank-you notes to donors? Cap a candidate\u2019s campaign\nspending? Restrict independent spending by people other\nthan the candidate? Ban independent spending by corpo-\nrations? And how, by the way, are judges supposed to\ndecide whether these measures promote public confidence\nin judicial integrity, when the Court does not even have a\nconsistent theory about what it means by \u201cjudicial integ-\nrity\u201d? For the Court to wring its hands about workability\nunder these circumstances is more than one should have\nto bear.\n                              D\n  Even if Florida could show that banning all personal\nappeals for campaign funds is necessary to protect public\nconfidence in judicial integrity, the Court must overpower\none last sentinel of free speech before it can uphold Canon\n7C(1). Among its other functions, the First Amendment is\na kind of Equal Protection Clause for ideas. The state\nordinarily may not regulate one message because it harms\na government interest yet refuse to regulate other mes-\nsages that impair the interest in a comparable way. Ap-\nplying this principle, we invalidated a law that prohibited\npicketing dwellings but made an exception for picketing\nabout labor issues; the State could not show that labor\npicketing harmed its asserted interest in residential pri-\n10              WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nvacy any less than other kinds of picketing. Carey v.\nBrown, 447 U. S. 455, 464\u2013465 (1980). In another case, we\nset aside a ban on showing movies containing nudity in\ndrive-in theaters, because the government did not demon-\nstrate that movies with nude scenes would distract pass-\ning drivers any more than, say, movies with violent\nscenes. Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 214\u2013215\n(1975).\n   The Court\u2019s decision disregards these principles. The\nCourt tells us that \u201call personal solicitations by judicial\ncandidates create a public appearance that undermines\nconfidence in the integrity of the judiciary.\u201d Ante, at 19.\nBut Canon 7C(1) does not restrict all personal solicita-\ntions; it restricts only personal solicitations related to\ncampaigns. The part of the Canon challenged here prohib-\nits personal pleas for \u201ccampaign funds,\u201d and the Canon\nelsewhere prohibits personal appeals to attorneys for\n\u201cpublicly stated support.\u201d Judicial Conduct Code 38. So\nalthough Canon 7C(1) prevents Yulee from asking a law-\nyer for a few dollars to help her buy campaign pamphlets,\nit does not prevent her asking the same lawyer for a per-\nsonal loan, access to his law firm\u2019s luxury suite at the local\nfootball stadium, or even a donation to help her fight the\nFlorida Bar\u2019s charges. What could possibly justify these\ndistinctions? Surely the Court does not believe that re-\nquests for campaign favors erode public confidence in a\nway that requests for favors unrelated to elections do not.\nCould anyone say with a straight face that it looks worse\nfor a candidate to say \u201cplease give my campaign $25\u201d than\nto say \u201cplease give me $25\u201d?*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Neither Florida nor the Court identifies any other ethics rule that\nwould prevent candidates like Yulee from asking for favors unrelated to\nelections, and I know of none. The Supreme Court of Florida has\nadopted various rules restricting sitting judges\u2019 solicitation and ac-\nceptance of favors, but these rules do not bind challengers like Yulee.\n                      Cite as: 575 U.

This analysis elides the\ndistinction between selectivity on the basis of content and\nselectivity on other grounds. Because the First Amend-\nment does not prohibit underinclusiveness as such, law-\nmakers may target a problem only at certain times or in\ncertain places. Because the First Amendment does pro-\nhibit content discrimination as such, lawmakers may not\ntarget a problem only in certain messages. Explaining\nthis distinction, we have said that the First Amendment\nwould allow banning obscenity \u201conly in certain media or\nmarkets\u201d but would preclude banning \u201conly that obscenity\nwhich includes offensive political messages.\u201d R. A. V. v.\nSt. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 387\u2013388 (1992) (emphasis delet-\ned). This case involves selectivity on the basis of content.\nThe Florida Supreme Court has decided to eliminate the\nappearances associated with \u201cpersonal appeals for money,\u201d\nante, at 18, when the appeals seek money for a campaign\nbut not when the appeals seek money for other purposes.\nThat distinction violates the First Amendment. See\nErznoznik, supra, at 215.\n  Even on the Court\u2019s own terms, Canon 7C(1) cannot\nstand. The Court concedes that \u201cunderinclusiveness can\nraise \u2018doubts about whether the government is in fact\npursuing the interest it invokes.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 13. Canon\n7C(1)\u2019s scope suggests that it has nothing to do with the\nappearances created by judges\u2019 asking for money, and\neverything to do with hostility toward judicial campaign-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSee, e.g., Canon 4D(2)(a), Judicial Conduct Code 18\u201319 (\u201cA judge as [a\nmember or officer of an organization] . . . shall not personally or directly\nparticipate in the solicitation of funds . . . \u201d); Canon 5D(5), id., at 24 (\u201cA\njudge shall not accept . . . a gift, bequest, favor or loan . . .\u201d); JEAC Op.\nNo. 2010\u201314 (\u201c[J]udicial candidates are only governed by Canon 7, and\nnot by the remainder of the Code of Judicial Conduct\u201d).\n12           WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ning. How else to explain the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision to ban all personal appeals for campaign funds\n(even when the solicitee could never appear before the\ncandidate), but to tolerate appeals for other kinds of funds\n(even when the solicitee will surely appear before the\ncandidate)? It should come as no surprise that the ABA,\nwhose model rules the Florida Supreme Court followed\nwhen framing Canon 7C(1), opposes judicial elections\u2014\npreferring instead a system in which (surprise!) a commit-\ntee of lawyers proposes candidates from among whom the\nGovernor must make his selection. See White, 536 U. S.,\nat 787.\n   The Court tries to strike a pose of neutrality between\nappointment and election of judges, but no one should be\ndeceived. A Court that sees impropriety in a candidate\u2019s\nrequest for any contributions to his election campaign does\nnot much like judicial selection by the people. One cannot\nhave judicial elections without judicial campaigns, and\njudicial campaigns without funds for campaigning, and\nfunds for campaigning without asking for them. When a\nsociety decides that its judges should be elected, it neces-\nsarily decides that selection by the people is more im-\nportant than the oracular sanctity of judges, their immun-\nity from the (shudder!) indignity of begging for funds, and\ntheir exemption from those shadows of impropriety that\nfall over the proletarian public officials who must run for\noffice. A free society, accustomed to electing its rulers,\ndoes not much care whether the rulers operate through\nstatute and executive order, or through judicial distortion\nof statute, executive order, and constitution. The prescrip-\ntion that judges be elected probably springs from the\npeople\u2019s realization that their judges can become their\nrulers\u2014and (it must be said) from just a deep-down feel-\ning that members of the Third Branch will profit from a\nhearty helping of humble pie, and from a severe reduction\nof their great remove from the (ugh!) People. (It should\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

In any case, hostility to campaigning by\njudges entitles the people of Florida to amend their Con-\nstitution to replace judicial elections with the selection of\njudges by lawyers\u2019 committees; it does not entitle the\nFlorida Supreme Court to adopt, or this Court to endorse,\na rule of judicial conduct that abridges candidates\u2019 speech\nin the judicial elections that the Florida Constitution\nprescribes.\n                          *    *    *\n   This Court has not been shy to enforce the First\nAmendment in recent Terms\u2014even in cases that do not\ninvolve election speech.

S. 460 (2010); Enter-\ntainment Merchants, 564 U. S. ___; Alvarez, 567 U.

FLORIDA BAR\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncampaigns for political office\u201d). As James Madison ob-\nserved: \u201cA popular Government, without popular infor-\nmation, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a\nFarce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. [A] people who\nmean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves\nwith the power which knowledge gives.\u201d Letter to William\nT. Berry (Aug. 4, 1822), in J. Madison, Writings 790\n(J. Rakove ed. 1999). The Court\u2019s decision in this case im-\nperils the content neutrality essential both for individual\nspeech and the election process.\n   With all due respect for the Court, it seems fair and\nnecessary to say its decision rests on two premises, neither\none correct. One premise is that in certain elections\u2014here\nan election to choose the best qualified judge\u2014the public\nlacks the necessary judgment to make an informed choice.\nInstead, the State must protect voters by altering the\nusual dynamics of free speech. The other premise is that\nsince judges should be accorded special respect and dig-\nnity, their election can be subject to certain content-based\nrules that would be unacceptable in other elections. In my\nrespectful view neither premise can justify the speech\nrestriction at issue here. Although States have a compel-\nling interest in seeking to ensure the appearance and the\nreality of an impartial judiciary, it does not follow that the\nState may alter basic First Amendment principles in\npursuing that goal. See Republican Party of Minn. v.\nWhite, 536 U. S. 765, 788 (2002).\n   While any number of troubling consequences will follow\nfrom the Court\u2019s ruling, a simple example can suffice to\nillustrate the dead weight its decision now ties to public\ndebate. Assume a judge retires, and two honest lawyers,\nDoe and Roe, seek the vacant position. Doe is a respected,\nprominent lawyer who has been active in the community\nand is well known to business and civic leaders. Roe, a\nlawyer of extraordinary ability and high ethical standards,\nkeeps a low profile. As soon as Doe announces his or her\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncandidacy, a campaign committee organizes of its own\naccord and begins raising funds. But few know or hear\nabout Roe\u2019s potential candidacy, and no one with resources\nor connections is available to assist in raising the funds\nnecessary for even a modest plan to speak to the elec-\ntorate. Today the Court says the State can censor Roe\u2019s\nspeech, imposing a gag on his or her request for funds, no\nmatter how close Roe is to the potential benefactor or\ndonor. The result is that Roe\u2019s personal freedom, the right\nof speech, is cut off by the State.\n   The First Amendment consequences of the Court\u2019s\nruling do not end with its denial of the individual\u2019s right to\nspeak. For the very purpose of the candidate\u2019s fundraising\nwas to facilitate a larger speech process: an election cam-\npaign. By cutting off one candidate\u2019s personal freedom to\nspeak, the broader campaign debate that might have\nfollowed\u2014a debate that might have been informed by new\nideas and insights from both candidates\u2014now is silenced.\n   Elections are a paradigmatic forum for speech. Though\npresent day campaign rhetoric all too often might thwart\nor obscure deliberative discourse, the idea of elections is\nthat voters can engage in, or at least consider, a principled\ndebate. That debate can be a means to find consensus for\na civic course that is prudent and wise. This pertains both\nto issues and to the choice of elected officials. The First\nAmendment seeks to make the idea of discussion, open\ndebate, and consensus-building a reality. But the Court\ndecides otherwise. The Court locks the First Amendment\nout.\n   Whether an election is the best way to choose a judge is\nitself the subject of fair debate. But once the people of a\nState choose to have elections, the First Amendment\nprotects the candidate\u2019s right to speak and the public\u2019s\nensuing right to open and robust debate. See ibid. One\nadvantage of judicial elections is the opportunity offered\nfor the public to become more knowledgeable about their\n4             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncourts and their law. This might stimulate discourse over\nthe requisite and highest ethical standards for the judici-\nary, including whether the people should elect a judge who\npersonally solicits campaign funds. Yet now that teaching\nprocess is hindered by state censorship. By allowing the\nState\u2019s speech restriction, the Court undermines the\neducational process that free speech in elections should\nfacilitate.\n  It is not within our Nation\u2019s First Amendment tradition\nto abridge speech simply because the government believes\na question is too difficult or too profound for voters. If the\nState is concerned about unethical campaign practices, it\nneed not revert to the assumption that voters themselves\nare insensitive to ethics. Judicial elections were created to\nenable citizens to decide for themselves which judges are\nbest qualified and which are most likely to \u201cstand by the\nconstitution of the State against the encroachment of\npower.\u201d Report of the Debates and Proceedings of the\nConvention for the Revision of the Constitution of the\nState of New York 672 (1846). The Court should not now\npresume citizens are unequipped for that task when it\ncomes to judging for themselves who should judge them.\n  If there is concern about principled, decent, and\nthoughtful discourse in election campaigns, the First\nAmendment provides the answer. That answer is more\nspeech. See, e.g., Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 377\n(1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (when the government\nobjects to speech, \u201cthe remedy to be applied is more\nspeech, not enforced silence\u201d). For example, candidates\nmight themselves agree to appoint members of a panel\ncharged with periodic evaluation of campaign statements,\ncandor, and fairness. Those evaluations could be made\npublic. And any number of private organizations or voter\ngroups seeking to evaluate campaign rhetoric could do the\nsame. See White, supra, at 795 (KENNEDY, J. concurring).\n  Modern communication technologies afford voters and\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncandidates an unparalleled opportunity to engage in the\ncampaign and election process. These technologies may\nencourage a discourse that is principled and informed.\nThe Internet, in particular, has increased in a dramatic\nway the rapidity and pervasiveness with which ideas may\nspread. Whether as a result of disclosure laws or a candi-\ndate\u2019s voluntary decision to make the campaign transpar-\nent, the Internet can reveal almost at once how a candi-\ndate sought funds; who the donors were; and what\namounts they gave. Indeed, disclosure requirements offer\na powerful, speech-enhancing method of deterring corrup-\ntion\u2014one that does not impose limits on how and when\npeople can speak. See Doe v. Reed, 561 U. S. 186, 199\n(2010) (\u201cPublic disclosure also promotes transparency and\naccountability in the electoral process to an extent other\nmeasures cannot\u201d). Based on disclosures the voters can\ndecide, among other matters, whether the public is well\nserved by an elected judiciary; how each candidate defines\nappropriate campaign conduct (which may speak volumes\nabout his or her judicial demeanor); and what persons and\ngroups support or oppose a particular candidate. See\nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 67 (1976) (per curiam). With\ndetailed information about a candidate\u2019s practices in\nsoliciting funds, voters may be better informed in choosing\nthose judges who are prepared to do justice \u201cwithout fear\nor favor.\u201d 10 Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England 105\n(2d ed. 1908). The speech the Court now holds foreclosed\nmight itself have been instructive in this regard, and it\ncould have been open to the electorate\u2019s scrutiny. Judicial\nelections, no less than other elections, presuppose faith in\ndemocracy. Judicial elections are no exception to the\npremise that elections can teach.\n   In addition to narrowing the First Amendment\u2019s reach,\nthere is another flaw in the Court\u2019s analysis. That is its\nerror in the application of strict scrutiny. The Court\u2019s\nevisceration of that judicial standard now risks long-term\n6             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nharm to what was once the Court\u2019s own preferred First\nAmendment test. As JUSTICE SCALIA well explains, the\nstate law at issue fails strict scrutiny for any number of\nreasons. The candidate who is not wealthy or well con-\nnected cannot ask even a close friend or relative for a bit of\nfinancial help, despite the lack of any increased risk of\npartiality and despite the fact that disclosure laws might\nbe enacted to make the solicitation and support public.\nThis law comes nowhere close to being narrowly tailored.\nAnd by saying that it survives that vital First Amendment\nrequirement, the Court now writes what is literally a\ncasebook guide to eviscerating strict scrutiny any time the\nCourt encounters speech it dislikes. On these premises,\nand for the reasons explained in more detail by JUSTICE\nSCALIA, it is necessary for me to file this respectful dissent.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

The Florida rule before us regulates speech\nthat is part of the process of selecting those who wield the\npower of the State. Such speech lies at the heart of the\nprotection provided by the First Amendment. The Florida\nrule regulates that speech based on content and must\ntherefore satisfy strict scrutiny. This means that it must\nbe narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest.\nFlorida has a compelling interest in making sure that its\ncourts decide cases impartially and in accordance with the\nlaw and that its citizens have no good reason to lack confi-\ndence that its courts are performing their proper role. But\nthe Florida rule is not narrowly tailored to serve that\ninterest.\n  Indeed, this rule is about as narrowly tailored as a\nburlap bag. It applies to all solicitations made in the\nname of a candidate for judicial office\u2014including, as was\nthe case here, a mass mailing. It even applies to an ad in\na newspaper. It applies to requests for contributions in\nany amount, and it applies even if the person solicited is\nnot a lawyer, has never had any interest at stake in any\ncase in the court in question, and has no prospect of ever\nhaving any interest at stake in any litigation in that court.\n2             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nIf this rule can be characterized as narrowly tailored, then\nnarrow tailoring has no meaning, and strict scrutiny,\nwhich is essential to the protection of free speech, is seri-\nously impaired.\n   When petitioner sent out a form letter requesting cam-\npaign contributions, she was well within her First\nAmendment rights. The Florida Supreme Court violated\nthe Constitution when it imposed a financial penalty and\nstained her record with a finding that she had engaged in\nunethical conduct. I would reverse the judgment of the\nFlorida Supreme Court.\n",

Argued January 20, 2015\u2014Decided April 29, 2015\nFlorida is one of 39 States where voters elect judges at the polls. To\n  promote public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary, the Florida\n  Supreme Court adopted Canon 7C(1) of its Code of Judicial Conduct,\n  which provides that judicial candidates \u201cshall not personally solicit\n  campaign funds . . . but may establish committees of responsible per-\n  sons\u201d to raise money for election campaigns.\n     Petitioner Lanell Williams-Yulee (Yulee) mailed and posted online\n  a letter soliciting financial contributions to her campaign for judicial\n  office.

Pp. 8\u201322.\n    (a) Florida\u2019s interest in preserving public confidence in the integri-\n  ty of its judiciary is compelling. The State may conclude that judges,\n  charged with exercising strict neutrality and independence, cannot\n  supplicate campaign donors without diminishing public confidence in\n  judicial integrity. Simply put, the public may lack confidence in a\n  judge\u2019s ability to administer justice without fear or favor if he comes\n  to office by asking for favors. This Court\u2019s precedents have recog-\n  nized the \u201cvital state interest\u201d in safeguarding \u201c \u2018public confidence in\n2                  WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the fairness and integrity of the nation\u2019s elected judges,\u2019 \u201d Caperton v.\n    A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. 868, 889. Unlike the legislature or\n    the executive, the judiciary \u201chas no influence over either the sword or\n    the purse,\u201d Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (A. Hamilton), so its authority\n    depends in large measure on the public\u2019s willingness to respect and\n    follow its decisions. Public perception of judicial integrity is accord-\n    ingly \u201c \u2018a state interest of the highest order.\u2019 \u201d 556 U. S., at 889.\n       A State\u2019s interest in preserving public confidence in the integrity of\n    its judiciary extends beyond its interest in preventing the appearance\n    of corruption in legislative and executive elections, because a judge\u2019s\n    role differs from that of a politician. Republican Party of Minn. v.\n    White, 536 U. S. 765, 783. Unlike a politician, who is expected to be\n    appropriately responsive to the preferences of supporters, a judge in\n    deciding cases may not follow the preferences of his supporters or\n    provide any special consideration to his campaign donors. As in\n    White, therefore, precedents applying the First Amendment to politi-\n    cal elections have little bearing on the issues here.\n       The vast majority of elected judges in States allowing personal so-\n    licitation serve with fairness and honor, but in the eyes of the public,\n    a judicial candidate\u2019s personal solicitation could result (even unknow-\n    ingly) in \u201ca possible temptation . . . which might lead him not to hold\n    the balance nice, clear and true.\u201d Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 532.\n    That risk is especially pronounced where most donors are lawyers\n    and litigants who may appear before the judge they are supporting.\n    In short, it is the regrettable but unavoidable appearance that judges\n    who personally ask for money may diminish their integrity that\n    prompted the Supreme Court of Florida and most other States to sev-\n    er the direct link between judicial candidates and campaign contribu-\n    tors. Pp. 9\u201312.\n       (b) Canon 7C(1) raises no fatal underinclusivity concerns. The so-\n    licitation ban aims squarely at the conduct most likely to undermine\n    public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary: personal requests\n    for money by judges and judicial candidates. The Canon applies ev-\n    enhandedly to all judges and judicial candidates, regardless of view-\n    point or means of solicitation. And unlike some laws that have been\n    found impermissibly underinclusive, Canon 7C(1) is not riddled with\n    exceptions.\n       Yulee relies heavily on the provision of Canon 7C(1) that allows so-\n    licitation by a candidate\u2019s campaign committee. But Florida, along\n    with most other States, has reasonably concluded that solicitation by\n    the candidate personally creates a categorically different and more\n    severe risk of undermining public confidence than does solicitation by\n    a campaign committee. When the judicial candidate himself asks for\n    money, the stakes are higher for all involved. A judicial candidate\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nasking for money places his name and reputation behind the request,\nand the solicited individual knows that the same person who signed\nthe fundraising letter might one day sign the judgment. This dynam-\nic inevitably creates pressure for the recipient to comply, in a way\nthat solicitation by a third party does not. Just as inevitably, the\npersonal involvement of the candidate in the solicitation creates the\npublic appearance that the candidate will remember who says yes,\nand who says no. However similar the two solicitations may be in\nsubstance, a State may conclude that they present markedly different\nappearances to the public.\n   Permitting a judicial candidate to write thank you notes to cam-\npaign donors likewise does not detract from the State\u2019s interest in\npreserving public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. The\nState\u2019s compelling interest is implicated most directly by the candi-\ndate\u2019s personal solicitation itself. A failure to ban thank you notes for\ncontributions not solicited by the candidate does not undercut the\nBar\u2019s rationale.\n   In addition, the State has a good reason for allowing candidates to\nwrite thank you notes and raise money through committees. These\naccommodations reflect Florida\u2019s effort to respect the First Amend-\nment interests of candidates and their contributors\u2014to resolve the\n\u201cfundamental tension between the ideal character of the judicial of-\nfice and the real world of electoral politics.\u201d Chisom v. Roemer, 501\nU. S. 380, 400. The State should not be punished for leaving open\nmore, rather than fewer, avenues of expression, especially when\nthere is no indication of a pretextual motive for the selective re-\nstriction of speech. Pp. 12\u201316.\n   (c) Canon 7C(1) is also not overinclusive. By any measure, it re-\nstricts a narrow slice of speech. It leaves judicial candidates free to\ndiscuss any issue with any person at any time; to write letters, give\nspeeches, and put up billboards; to contact potential supporters in\nperson, on the phone, or online; and to promote their campaigns\nthrough the media. Though they cannot ask for money, they can di-\nrect their campaign committees to do so.\n   Yulee concedes that Canon 7C(1) is valid in numerous applications,\nbut she contends that the Canon cannot constitutionally be applied to\nher chosen form of solicitation: a letter posted online and distributed\nvia mass mailing. This argument misperceives the breadth of the\ncompelling interest underlying Canon 7C(1). Florida has reasonably\ndetermined that personal appeals for money by a judicial candidate\ninherently create an appearance of impropriety that may cause the\npublic to lose confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. That inter-\nest may be implicated to varying degrees in particular contexts, but\nthe interest remains whenever the public perceives the judge person-\n4                 WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ally asking for money. Canon 7C(1) must be narrowly tailored, not\n    \u201cperfectly tailored.\u201d Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 209. The\n    First Amendment does not confine a State to addressing evils in their\n    most acute form. Here, Florida has concluded that all personal solici-\n    tations by judicial candidates create a public appearance that un-\n    dermines confidence in the integrity of the judiciary; banning all per-\n    sonal solicitations by judicial candidates is narrowly tailored to\n    address that concern.\n      Yulee errs in contending that Florida can accomplish its compelling\n    interest through recusal rules and campaign contribution limits. A\n    rule requiring recusal in every case in which a lawyer or litigant\n    made a campaign contribution would disable many jurisdictions, and\n    a flood of postelection recusal motions could exacerbate the very ap-\n    pearance problem the State is trying to solve. As for contribution\n    limits, Florida already applies them to judicial elections, and this\n    Court has never held that adopting such limits precludes a State\n    from pursuing its compelling interests through additional means.\n      The desirability of judicial elections is a question that has sparked\n    disagreement for more than 200 years, but it is not the Court\u2019s place\n    to resolve that enduring debate. The Court\u2019s limited task is to apply\n    the Constitution to the question presented in this case. Judicial can-\n    didates have a First Amendment right to speak in support of their\n    campaigns. States have a compelling interest in preserving public\n    confidence in their judiciaries. When the State adopts a narrowly tai-\n    lored restriction like the one at issue here, those principles do not\n    conflict. A State\u2019s decision to elect judges does not compel it to com-\n    promise public confidence in their integrity. Pp. 16\u201322.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

The Constitution permits States to make a\ndifferent choice, and most of them have done so. In 39\nStates, voters elect trial or appellate judges at the polls.\nIn an effort to preserve public confidence in the integrity\nof their judiciaries, many of those States prohibit judges\nand judicial candidates from personally soliciting funds for\ntheir campaigns. We must decide whether the First\nAmendment permits such restrictions on speech.\n  We hold that it does. Judges are not politicians, even\nwhen they come to the bench by way of the ballot. And a\nState\u2019s decision to elect its judiciary does not compel it to\ntreat judicial candidates like campaigners for political\noffice. A State may assure its people that judges will\napply the law without fear or favor\u2014and without having\npersonally asked anyone for money.

Florida soon followed more than a\ndozen of its sister States in transferring authority to elect\njudges to the voting public. See J. Shugerman, The Peo-\nple\u2019s Courts: Pursuing Judicial Independence in America\n103\u2013122 (2012). The experiment did not last long in the\nSunshine State. The war came, and Florida\u2019s 1868 Consti-\ntution returned judicial selection to the political branches.\nOver time, however, the people reclaimed the power to\nelect the state bench: Supreme Court justices in 1885 and\ntrial court judges in 1942. See Little, An Overview of the\nHistorical Development of the Judicial Article of the Flor-\nida Constitution, 19 Stetson L. Rev. 1, 40 (1989).\n   In the early 1970s, four Florida Supreme Court justices\nresigned from office following corruption scandals. Florida\nvoters responded by amending their Constitution again.\nUnder the system now in place, appellate judges are ap-\npointed by the Governor from a list of candidates proposed\nby a nominating committee\u2014a process known as \u201cmerit\nselection.\u201d Then, every six years, voters decide whether to\nretain incumbent appellate judges for another term. Trial\njudges are still elected by popular vote, unless the local\njurisdiction opts instead for merit selection. Fla. Const.,\nArt.

In September\n2009, she decided to run for a seat on the county court for\nHillsborough County, a jurisdiction of about 1.3 million\npeople that includes the city of Tampa. Shortly after filing\npaperwork to enter the race, Yulee drafted a letter an-\nnouncing her candidacy.

She\nalso posted the letter on her campaign Web site.\n  Yulee\u2019s bid for the bench did not unfold as she had\nhoped. She lost the primary to the incumbent judge.\nThen the Florida Bar filed a complaint against her.

The court ex-\nplained that Canon 7C(1) \u201cclearly restricts a judicial can-\ndidate\u2019s speech\u201d and therefore must be \u201cnarrowly tailored\nto serve a compelling state interest.\u201d Id., at 384. The\ncourt held that the Canon satisfies that demanding in-\nquiry. First, the court reasoned, prohibiting judicial can-\ndidates from personally soliciting funds furthers Florida\u2019s\ncompelling interest in \u201cpreserving the integrity of [its]\njudiciary and maintaining the public\u2019s confidence in an\nimpartial judiciary.\u201d     Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted; alteration in original). In the court\u2019s view, \u201cper-\nsonal solicitation of campaign funds, even by mass mail-\ning, raises an appearance of impropriety and calls into\nquestion, in the public\u2019s mind, the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d\nId., at 385.

But the court found it persuasive\nthat every State Supreme Court that had considered\nsimilar fundraising provisions\u2014along with several Fed-\neral Courts of Appeals\u2014had upheld the laws against First\nAmendment challenges.

The parties agree that Canon 7C(1) restricts\nYulee\u2019s speech on the basis of its content by prohibiting\nher from soliciting contributions to her election campaign.\nThe parties disagree, however, about the level of scrutiny\nthat should govern our review.\n   We have applied exacting scrutiny to laws restricting\nthe solicitation of contributions to charity, upholding the\nspeech limitations only if they are narrowly tailored to\nserve a compelling interest. See Riley v. National Federa\u00ad\ntion of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 798 (1988); id.,\nat 810 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).

Applying a lesser standard of scrutiny to such\nspeech would threaten \u201cthe exercise of rights so vital to\nthe maintenance of democratic institutions.\u201d Schneider v.\nState (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 161 (1939).\n   The principles underlying these charitable solicitation\ncases apply with even greater force here. Before asking\nfor money in her fundraising letter, Yulee explained her\nfitness for the bench and expressed her vision for the\njudiciary. Her stated purpose for the solicitation was to\nget her \u201cmessage out to the public.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n32a. As we have long recognized, speech about public\nissues and the qualifications of candidates for elected\noffice commands the highest level of First Amendment\nprotection. See Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic\nCentral Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989). Indeed, in our\nonly prior case concerning speech restrictions on a candi-\ndate for judicial office, this Court and both parties as-\nsumed that strict scrutiny applied. Republican Party of\nMinn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765, 774 (2002).\n   Although the Florida Supreme Court upheld Canon\n7C(1) under strict scrutiny, the Florida Bar and several\namici contend that we should subject the Canon to a more\npermissive standard: that it be \u201cclosely drawn\u201d to match a\n\u201csufficiently important interest.\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424\nU. S. 1, 25 (1976) (per curiam). The \u201cclosely drawn\u201d\nstandard is a poor fit for this case. The Court adopted\nthat test in Buckley to address a claim that campaign\ncontribution limits violated a contributor\u2019s \u201cfreedom of\npolitical association.\u201d Id., at 24\u201325. Here, Yulee does not\nclaim that Canon 7C(1) violates her right to free associa-\ntion; she argues that it violates her right to free speech.\nAnd the Florida Bar can hardly dispute that the Canon\ninfringes Yulee\u2019s freedom to discuss candidates and public\n8             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nissues\u2014namely, herself and her qualifications to be a\njudge. The Bar\u2019s call to import the \u201cclosely drawn\u201d test\nfrom the contribution limit context into a case about solici-\ntation therefore has little avail.\n  As several of the Bar\u2019s amici note, we applied the \u201cclosely\ndrawn\u201d test to solicitation restrictions in McConnell v.\nFederal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93, 136 (2003), over-\nruled in part by Citizens United v. Federal Election\nComm\u2019n, 558 U. S. 310 (2010). But the Court in that case\ndetermined that the solicitation restrictions operated\nprimarily to prevent circumvention of the contribution\nlimits, which were the subject of the \u201cclosely drawn\u201d test\nin the first place. 540 U. S., at 138\u2013139. McConnell offers\nno help to the Bar here, because Florida did not adopt\nCanon 7C(1) as an anticircumvention measure.\n  In sum, we hold today what we assumed in White: A\nState may restrict the speech of a judicial candidate only if\nthe restriction is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\ninterest.\n                             III\n  The Florida Bar faces a demanding task in defending\nCanon 7C(1) against Yulee\u2019s First Amendment challenge.\nWe have emphasized that \u201cit is the rare case\u201d in which a\nState demonstrates that a speech restriction is narrowly\ntailored to serve a compelling interest. Burson v. Free\u00ad\nman, 504 U. S. 191, 211 (1992) (plurality opinion). But\nthose cases do arise. See ibid.; Holder v. Humanitarian\nLaw Project, 561 U. S. 1, 25\u201339 (2010); McConnell, 540\nU. S., at 314 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.); cf. Adarand Con\u00ad\nstructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 237 (1995) (\u201cwe wish\nto dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is \u2018strict in theory,\nbut fatal in fact\u2019 \u201d). Here, Canon 7C(1) advances the\nState\u2019s compelling interest in preserving public confidence\nin the integrity of the judiciary, and it does so through\nmeans narrowly tailored to avoid unnecessarily abridging\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nspeech. This is therefore one of the rare cases in which a\nspeech restriction withstands strict scrutiny.\n                              A\n  The Florida Supreme Court adopted Canon 7C(1) to\npromote the State\u2019s interests in \u201cprotecting the integrity of\nthe judiciary\u201d and \u201cmaintaining the public\u2019s confidence in\nan impartial judiciary.\u201d 138 So. 3d, at 385. The way the\nCanon advances those interests is intuitive: Judges,\ncharged with exercising strict neutrality and independ-\nence, cannot supplicate campaign donors without dimin-\nishing public confidence in judicial integrity. This princi-\nple dates back at least eight centuries to Magna Carta,\nwhich proclaimed, \u201cTo no one will we sell, to no one will\nwe refuse or delay, right or justice.\u201d Cl. 40 (1215), in W.\nMcKechnie, Magna Carta, A Commentary on the Great\nCharter of King John 395 (2d ed. 1914). The same concept\nunderlies the common law judicial oath, which binds a\njudge to \u201cdo right to all manner of people . . . without fear\nor favour, affection or ill-will,\u201d 10 Encyclopaedia of the\nLaws of England 105 (2d ed. 1908), and the oath that each\nof us took to \u201cadminister justice without respect to per-\nsons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich,\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7453. Simply put, Florida and most other States\nhave concluded that the public may lack confidence in a\njudge\u2019s ability to administer justice without fear or favor if\nhe comes to office by asking for favors.\n  The interest served by Canon 7C(1) has firm support in\nour precedents. We have recognized the \u201cvital state inter-\nest\u201d in safeguarding \u201cpublic confidence in the fairness and\nintegrity of the nation\u2019s elected judges.\u201d Caperton v. A. T.\nMassey Coal Co., 556 U. S. 868, 889 (2009) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted). The importance of public confi-\ndence in the integrity of judges stems from the place of\nthe judiciary in the government. Unlike the executive or the\nlegislature, the judiciary \u201chas no influence over either the\n10            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsword or the purse; . . . neither force nor will but merely\njudgment.\u201d The Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (C. Rossiter ed.\n1961) (A. Hamilton) (capitalization altered). The judici-\nary\u2019s authority therefore depends in large measure on the\npublic\u2019s willingness to respect and follow its decisions. As\nJustice Frankfurter once put it for the Court, \u201cjustice must\nsatisfy the appearance of justice.\u201d Offutt v. United States,\n348 U. S. 11, 14 (1954). It follows that public perception of\njudicial integrity is \u201ca state interest of the highest order.\u201d\nCaperton, 556 U. S., at 889 (quoting White, 536 U. S., at\n793 (KENNEDY, J., concurring)).\n   The principal dissent observes that bans on judicial\ncandidate solicitation lack a lengthy historical pedigree.\nPost, at 1\u20132 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). We do not dispute that\nfact, but it has no relevance here. As the precedent cited\nby the principal dissent demonstrates, a history and tradi-\ntion of regulation are important factors in determining\nwhether to recognize \u201cnew categories of unprotected\nspeech.\u201d Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3); see post, at 1. But\nnobody argues that solicitation of campaign funds by\njudicial candidates is a category of unprotected speech. As\nexplained above, the First Amendment fully applies to\nYulee\u2019s speech. The question is instead whether that\nAmendment permits the particular regulation of speech at\nissue here.\n   The parties devote considerable attention to our cases\nanalyzing campaign finance restrictions in political elec-\ntions. But a State\u2019s interest in preserving public confi-\ndence in the integrity of its judiciary extends beyond its\ninterest in preventing the appearance of corruption in\nlegislative and executive elections. As we explained in\nWhite, States may regulate judicial elections differently\nthan they regulate political elections, because the role of\njudges differs from the role of politicians. 536 U. S., at\n783; id., at 805 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). Politicians are\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Indeed, such \u201cresponsiveness is key to\nthe very concept of self-governance through elected offi-\ncials.\u201d McCutcheon v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 572 U. S.\n___, ___ (2014) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 39). The\nsame is not true of judges. In deciding cases, a judge is\nnot to follow the preferences of his supporters, or provide\nany special consideration to his campaign donors. A judge\ninstead must \u201cobserve the utmost fairness,\u201d striving to be\n\u201cperfectly and completely independent, with nothing to\ninfluence or controul him but God and his conscience.\u201d\nAddress of John Marshall, in Proceedings and Debates of\nthe Virginia State Convention of 1829\u20131830, p. 616 (1830).\nAs in White, therefore, our precedents applying the First\nAmendment to political elections have little bearing on the\nissues here.\n   The vast majority of elected judges in States that allow\npersonal solicitation serve with fairness and honor. But\n\u201c[e]ven if judges were able to refrain from favoring donors,\nthe mere possibility that judges\u2019 decisions may be moti-\nvated by the desire to repay campaign contributions is\nlikely to undermine the public\u2019s confidence in the judiciary.\u201d\nWhite, 536 U. S., at 790 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). In the\neyes of the public, a judge\u2019s personal solicitation could\nresult (even unknowingly) in \u201ca possible temptation . . .\nwhich might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear\nand true.\u201d Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 532 (1927). That\nrisk is especially pronounced because most donors are\nlawyers and litigants who may appear before the judge\nthey are supporting. See A. Bannon, E. Velasco, L. Casey,\n& L. Reagan, The New Politics of Judicial Elections: 2011\u2013\n12, p. 15 (2013).\n   The concept of public confidence in judicial integrity\ndoes not easily reduce to precise definition, nor does it\nlend itself to proof by documentary record. But no one\ndenies that it is genuine and compelling. In short, it is the\n12            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nregrettable but unavoidable appearance that judges who\npersonally ask for money may diminish their integrity\nthat prompted the Supreme Court of Florida and most\nother States to sever the direct link between judicial can-\ndidates and campaign contributors. As the Supreme\nCourt of Oregon explained, \u201cthe spectacle of lawyers or\npotential litigants directly handing over money to judicial\ncandidates should be avoided if the public is to have faith\nin the impartiality of its judiciary.\u201d In re Fadeley, 310\nOre. 548, 565, 802 P. 2d 31, 41 (1990). Moreover, personal\nsolicitation by a judicial candidate \u201cinevitably places the\nsolicited individuals in a position to fear retaliation if they\nfail to financially support that candidate.\u201d Simes, 368\nArk., at 585, 247 S. W. 3d, at 882. Potential litigants then\nfear that \u201cthe integrity of the judicial system has been\ncompromised, forcing them to search for an attorney in\npart based upon the criteria of which attorneys have made\nthe obligatory contributions.\u201d Ibid. A State\u2019s decision to\nelect its judges does not require it to tolerate these risks.\nThe Florida Bar\u2019s interest is compelling.\n                             B\n  Yulee acknowledges the State\u2019s compelling interest in\njudicial integrity. She argues, however, that the Canon\u2019s\nfailure to restrict other speech equally damaging to judi-\ncial integrity and its appearance undercuts the Bar\u2019s\nposition. In particular, she notes that Canon 7C(1) allows\na judge\u2019s campaign committee to solicit money, which\narguably reduces public confidence in the integrity of the\njudiciary just as much as a judge\u2019s personal solicitation.\nYulee also points out that Florida permits judicial candi-\ndates to write thank you notes to campaign donors, which\nensures that candidates know who contributes and who\ndoes not.\n  It is always somewhat counterintuitive to argue that a\nlaw violates the First Amendment by abridging too little\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

We have recognized, however, that underinclu-\nsiveness can raise \u201cdoubts about whether the government\nis in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than\ndisfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.\u201d Brown,\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). In a textbook illustration\nof that principle, we invalidated a city\u2019s ban on ritual\nanimal sacrifices because the city failed to regulate vast\nswaths of conduct that similarly diminished its asserted\ninterests in public health and animal welfare. Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 543\u2013\n547 (1993).\n  Underinclusiveness can also reveal that a law does not\nactually advance a compelling interest. For example, a\nState\u2019s decision to prohibit newspapers, but not electronic\nmedia, from releasing the names of juvenile defendants\nsuggested that the law did not advance its stated purpose\nof protecting youth privacy. Smith v. Daily Mail Publish\u00ad\ning Co., 443 U. S. 97, 104\u2013105 (1979).\n  Although a law\u2019s underinclusivity raises a red flag, the\nFirst Amendment imposes no freestanding \u201cunderinclu-\nsiveness limitation.\u201d R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377,\n387 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). A State\nneed not address all aspects of a problem in one fell swoop;\npolicymakers may focus on their most pressing concerns.\nWe have accordingly upheld laws\u2014even under strict\nscrutiny\u2014that conceivably could have restricted even\ngreater amounts of speech in service of their stated inter-\nests. Burson, 504 U. S., at 207; see McConnell, 540 U. S.,\nat 207\u2013208; Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490,\n511\u2013512 (1981) (plurality opinion); Buckley, 424 U. S., at\n105.\n  Viewed in light of these principles, Canon 7C(1) raises\nno fatal underinclusivity concerns. The solicitation ban\naims squarely at the conduct most likely to undermine\npublic confidence in the integrity of the judiciary: personal\nrequests for money by judges and judicial candidates. The\n14           WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCanon applies evenhandedly to all judges and judicial\ncandidates, regardless of their viewpoint or chosen means\nof solicitation. And unlike some laws that we have found\nimpermissibly underinclusive, Canon 7C(1) is not riddled\nwith exceptions. See City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43,\n52\u201353 (1994). Indeed, the Canon contains zero exceptions\nto its ban on personal solicitation.\n   Yulee relies heavily on the provision of Canon 7C(1) that\nallows solicitation by a candidate\u2019s campaign committee.\nBut Florida, along with most other States, has reasonably\nconcluded that solicitation by the candidate personally\ncreates a categorically different and more severe risk of\nundermining public confidence than does solicitation by a\ncampaign committee. The identity of the solicitor matters,\nas anyone who has encountered a Girl Scout selling cook-\nies outside a grocery store can attest. When the judicial\ncandidate himself asks for money, the stakes are higher\nfor all involved. The candidate has personally invested his\ntime and effort in the fundraising appeal; he has placed\nhis name and reputation behind the request. The solicited\nindividual knows that, and also knows that the solicitor\nmight be in a position to singlehandedly make decisions of\ngreat weight: The same person who signed the fundraising\nletter might one day sign the judgment. This dynamic\ninevitably creates pressure for the recipient to comply, and\nit does so in a way that solicitation by a third party does\nnot. Just as inevitably, the personal involvement of the\ncandidate in the solicitation creates the public appearance\nthat the candidate will remember who says yes, and who\nsays no.\n   In short, personal solicitation by judicial candidates\nimplicates a different problem than solicitation by cam-\npaign committees. However similar the two solicitations\nmay be in substance, a State may conclude that they\npresent markedly different appearances to the public.\nFlorida\u2019s choice to allow solicitation by campaign commit-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntees does not undermine its decision to ban solicitation by\njudges.\n   Likewise, allowing judicial candidates to write thank\nyou notes to campaign donors does not detract from the\nState\u2019s interest in preserving public confidence in the\nintegrity of the judiciary. Yulee argues that permitting\nthank you notes heightens the likelihood of actual bias by\nensuring that judicial candidates know who supported\ntheir campaigns, and ensuring that the supporter knows\nthat the candidate knows. Maybe so. But the State\u2019s\ncompelling interest is implicated most directly by the\ncandidate\u2019s personal solicitation itself. A failure to ban\nthank you notes for contributions not solicited by the\ncandidate does not undercut the Bar\u2019s rationale.\n   In addition, the State has a good reason for allowing\ncandidates to write thank you notes and raise money\nthrough committees. These accommodations reflect Flor-\nida\u2019s effort to respect the First Amendment interests of\ncandidates and their contributors\u2014to resolve the \u201cfunda-\nmental tension between the ideal character of the judicial\noffice and the real world of electoral politics.\u201d Chisom v.\nRoemer, 501 U. S. 380, 400 (1991). They belie the princi-\npal dissent\u2019s suggestion that Canon 7C(1) reflects general\n\u201chostility toward judicial campaigning\u201d and has \u201cnothing\nto do with the appearances created by judges\u2019 asking for\nmoney.\u201d Post, at 11. Nothing?\n   The principal dissent also suggests that Canon 7C(1) is\nunderinclusive because Florida does not ban judicial can-\ndidates from asking individuals for personal gifts or loans.\nPost, at 10. But Florida law treats a personal \u201cgift\u201d or\n\u201cloan\u201d as a campaign contribution if the donor makes it\n\u201cfor the purpose of influencing the results of an election,\u201d\nFla. Stat. \u00a7106.011(5)(a), and Florida\u2019s Judicial Qualifica-\ntions Commission has determined that a judicial candi-\ndate violates Canon 7C(1) by personally soliciting such a\nloan.

FLORIDA BAR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nIn any event, Florida can ban personal solicitation of\ncampaign funds by judicial candidates without making\nthem obey a comprehensive code to leading an ethical life.\nUnderinclusivity creates a First Amendment concern\nwhen the State regulates one aspect of a problem while\ndeclining to regulate a different aspect of the problem that\naffects its stated interest in a comparable way. See Flor-\nida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 540 (1989). The princi-\npal dissent offers no basis to conclude that judicial candi-\ndates are in the habit of soliciting personal loans, football\ntickets, or anything of the sort. Post, at 10. Even under\nstrict scrutiny, \u201c[t]he First Amendment does not require\nStates to regulate for problems that do not exist.\u201d Burson,\n504 U. S., at 207 (State\u2019s regulation of political solicitation\naround a polling place, but not charitable or commercial\nsolicitation, was not fatally underinclusive under strict\nscrutiny).\n   Taken to its logical conclusion, the position advanced by\nYulee and the principal dissent is that Florida may ban\nthe solicitation of funds by judicial candidates only if the\nState bans all solicitation of funds in judicial elections.\nThe First Amendment does not put a State to that all-or-\nnothing choice. We will not punish Florida for leaving\nopen more, rather than fewer, avenues of expression,\nespecially when there is no indication that the selective\nrestriction of speech reflects a pretextual motive.\n                            C\n  After arguing that Canon 7C(1) violates the First\nAmendment because it restricts too little speech, Yulee\nargues that the Canon violates the First Amendment\nbecause it restricts too much. In her view, the Canon is\nnot narrowly tailored to advance the State\u2019s compelling\ninterest through the least restrictive means. See United\nStates v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S.\n803, 813 (2000).\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   By any measure, Canon 7C(1) restricts a narrow slice of\nspeech. A reader of JUSTICE KENNEDY\u2019s dissent could be\nforgiven for concluding that the Court has just upheld a\nlatter-day version of the Alien and Sedition Acts, approv-\ning \u201cstate censorship\u201d that \u201clocks the First Amendment\nout,\u201d imposes a \u201cgag\u201d on candidates, and inflicts \u201cdead\nweight\u201d on a \u201csilenced\u201d public debate. Post, at 2\u20134. But in\nreality, Canon 7C(1) leaves judicial candidates free to\ndiscuss any issue with any person at any time. Candi-\ndates can write letters, give speeches, and put up bill-\nboards. They can contact potential supporters in person,\non the phone, or online. They can promote their cam-\npaigns on radio, television, or other media. They cannot\nsay, \u201cPlease give me money.\u201d They can, however, direct\ntheir campaign committees to do so. Whatever else may\nbe said of the Canon, it is surely not a \u201cwildly dispropor-\ntionate restriction upon speech.\u201d Post, at 1 (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting).\n   Indeed, Yulee concedes\u2014and the principal dissent\nseems to agree, post, at 8\u2014that Canon 7C(1) is valid in\nnumerous applications. Yulee acknowledges that Florida\ncan prohibit judges from soliciting money from lawyers\nand litigants appearing before them. Reply Brief 18. In\naddition, she says the State \u201cmight\u201d be able to ban \u201cdirect\none-to-one solicitation of lawyers and individuals or busi-\nnesses that could reasonably appear in the court for which\nthe individual is a candidate.\u201d Ibid. She also suggests\nthat the Bar could forbid \u201cin person\u201d solicitation by judi-\ncial candidates. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; cf. Ohralik v. Ohio\nState Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447 (1978) (permitting State to\nban in person solicitation of clients by lawyers). But Yulee\nargues that the Canon cannot constitutionally be applied\nto her chosen form of solicitation: a letter posted online\nand distributed via mass mailing. No one, she contends,\nwill lose confidence in the integrity of the judiciary based\non personal solicitation to such a broad audience.\n18            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   This argument misperceives the breadth of the compel-\nling interest that underlies Canon 7C(1). Florida has\nreasonably determined that personal appeals for money by\na judicial candidate inherently create an appearance of\nimpropriety that may cause the public to lose confidence in\nthe integrity of the judiciary. That interest may be impli-\ncated to varying degrees in particular contexts, but the\ninterest remains whenever the public perceives the judge\npersonally asking for money.\n   Moreover, the lines Yulee asks us to draw are unwork-\nable. Even under her theory of the case, a mass mailing\nwould create an appearance of impropriety if addressed to\na list of all lawyers and litigants with pending cases. So\nwould a speech soliciting contributions from the 100 most\nfrequently appearing attorneys in the jurisdiction. Yulee\nsays she might accept a ban on one-to-one solicitation, but\nis the public impression really any different if a judicial\ncandidate tries to buttonhole not one prospective donor\nbut two at a time? Ten? Yulee also agrees that in person\nsolicitation creates a problem. But would the public\u2019s\nconcern recede if the request for money came in a phone\ncall or a text message?\n   We decline to wade into this swamp. The First Amend-\nment requires that Canon 7C(1) be narrowly tailored, not\nthat it be \u201cperfectly tailored.\u201d Burson, 504 U. S., at 209.\nThe impossibility of perfect tailoring is especially apparent\nwhen the State\u2019s compelling interest is as intangible as\npublic confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. Yulee is\nof course correct that some personal solicitations raise\ngreater concerns than others. A judge who passes the hat\nin the courthouse creates a more serious appearance of\nimpropriety than does a judicial candidate who makes a\ntasteful plea for support on the radio. But most problems\narise in greater and lesser gradations, and the First\nAmendment does not confine a State to addressing evils in\ntheir most acute form. See id., at 210. Here, Florida has\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconcluded that all personal solicitations by judicial candi-\ndates create a public appearance that undermines confi-\ndence in the integrity of the judiciary; banning all personal\nsolicitations by judicial candidates is narrowly tailored to\naddress that concern.\n   In considering Yulee\u2019s tailoring arguments, we are\nmindful that most States with elected judges have deter-\nmined that drawing a line between personal solicitation by\ncandidates and solicitation by committees is necessary to\npreserve public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.\nThese considered judgments deserve our respect, especially\nbecause they reflect sensitive choices by States in an area\ncentral to their own governance\u2014how to select those who\n\u201csit as their judges.\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452,\n460 (1991).\n   Finally, Yulee contends that Florida can accomplish its\ncompelling interest through the less restrictive means of\nrecusal rules and campaign contribution limits. We dis-\nagree. A rule requiring judges to recuse themselves from\nevery case in which a lawyer or litigant made a campaign\ncontribution would disable many jurisdictions. And a\nflood of postelection recusal motions could \u201cerode public\nconfidence in judicial impartiality\u201d and thereby exacerbate\nthe very appearance problem the State is trying to solve.\nCaperton, 556 U. S., at 891 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).\nMoreover, the rule that Yulee envisions could create a\nperverse incentive for litigants to make campaign contri-\nbutions to judges solely as a means to trigger their later\nrecusal\u2014a form of peremptory strike against a judge that\nwould enable transparent forum shopping.\n   As for campaign contribution limits, Florida already\napplies them to judicial elections. Fla. Stat. \u00a7106.08(1)(a).\nA State may decide that the threat to public confidence\ncreated by personal solicitation exists apart from the\namount of money that a judge or judicial candidate seeks.\nEven if Florida decreased its contribution limit, the ap-\n20            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npearance that judges who personally solicit funds might\nimproperly favor their campaign donors would remain.\nAlthough the Court has held that contribution limits\nadvance the interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption\nand its appearance in political elections, we have never\nheld that adopting contribution limits precludes a State\nfrom pursuing its compelling interests through additional\nmeans. And in any event, a State has compelling interests\nin regulating judicial elections that extend beyond its\ninterests in regulating political elections, because judges\nare not politicians.\n   In sum, because Canon 7C(1) is narrowly tailored to\nserve a compelling government interest, the First\nAmendment poses no obstacle to its enforcement in this\ncase. As a result of our decision, Florida may continue to\nprohibit judicial candidates from personally soliciting\ncampaign funds, while allowing them to raise money\nthrough committees and to otherwise communicate their\nelectoral messages in practically any way. The principal\ndissent faults us for not answering a slew of broader ques-\ntions, such as whether Florida may cap a judicial candi-\ndate\u2019s spending or ban independent expenditures by cor-\nporations. Post, at 8\u20139. Yulee has not asked these\nquestions, and for good reason\u2014they are far afield from\nthe narrow regulation actually at issue in this case.\n   We likewise have no cause to consider whether the\ncitizens of States that elect their judges have decided\nanything about the \u201coracular sanctity of judges\u201d or whether\njudges are due \u201ca hearty helping of humble pie.\u201d Post,\nat 12. The principal dissent could be right that the deci-\nsion to adopt judicial elections \u201cprobably springs,\u201d at least\nin part, from a desire to make judges more accountable to\nthe public, ibid., although the history on this matter is\nmore complicated.

Faithful application of our precedents would have\nmade short work of this wildly disproportionate restriction\nupon speech. Intent upon upholding the Canon, however,\nthe Court flattens one settled First Amendment principle\nafter another.\n                               I\n  The first axiom of the First Amendment is this: As a\ngeneral rule, the state has no power to ban speech on the\nbasis of its content. One need not equate judges with\npoliticians to see that this principle does not grow weaker\nmerely because the censored speech is a judicial candi-\ndate\u2019s request for a campaign contribution. Our cases hold\nthat speech enjoys the full protection of the First Amend-\nment unless a widespread and longstanding tradition\nratifies its regulation. Brown v. Entertainment Merchants\nAssn., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3). No such\ntradition looms here. Georgia became the first State to\nelect its judges in 1812, and judicial elections had spread\nto a large majority of the States by the time of the Civil\n2             WILLIAMS-YULEE v.

Yet there appears to have been no regulation\nof judicial candidates\u2019 speech throughout the 19th and\nearly 20th centuries. Ibid. The American Bar Association\nfirst proposed ethics rules concerning speech of judicial\ncandidates in 1924, but these rules did not achieve wide-\nspread adoption until after the Second World War. Id., at\n786.\n   Rules against soliciting campaign contributions arrived\nmore recently still. The ABA first proposed a canon advis-\ning against it in 1972, and a canon prohibiting it only in\n1990. See Brief for American Bar Association as Amicus\nCuriae 2\u20134. Even now, 9 of the 39 States that elect judges\nallow judicial candidates to ask for campaign contribu-\ntions. See id., at 4. In the absence of any long-settled\ncustom about judicial candidates\u2019 speech in general or\ntheir solicitations in particular, we have no basis for relax-\ning the rules that normally apply to laws that suppress\nspeech because of content.\n   One likewise need not equate judges with politicians to\nsee that the electoral setting calls for all the more vigi-\nlance in ensuring observance of the First Amendment.\nWhen a candidate asks someone for a campaign contribu-\ntion, he tends (as the principal opinion acknowledges) also\nto talk about his qualifications for office and his views on\npublic issues. Ante, at 6\u20137 (plurality opinion). This ex-\npression lies at the heart of what the First Amendment is\nmeant to protect. In addition, banning candidates from\nasking for money personally \u201cfavors some candidates over\nothers\u2014incumbent judges (who benefit from their current\nstatus) over non-judicial candidates, the well-to-do (who\nmay not need to raise any money at all) over lower-income\ncandidates, and the well-connected (who have an army of\npotential fundraisers) over outsiders.\u201d Carey v. Wolnitzek,\n614 F. 3d 189, 204 (CA6 2010). This danger of legislated\n(or judicially imposed) favoritism is the very reason the\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nFirst Amendment exists.\n   Because Canon 7C(1) restricts fully protected speech on\nthe basis of content, it presumptively violates the First\nAmendment. We may uphold it only if the State meets its\nburden of showing that the Canon survives strict scru-\ntiny\u2014that is to say, only if it shows that the Canon is nar-\nrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. I do not for a\nmoment question the Court\u2019s conclusion that States have\ndifferent compelling interests when regulating judicial\nelections than when regulating political ones. Unlike a\nlegislator, a judge must be impartial\u2014without bias for or\nagainst any party or attorney who comes before him. I\naccept for the sake of argument that States have a compel-\nling interest in ensuring that its judges are seen to be\nimpartial. I will likewise assume that a judicial candi-\ndate\u2019s request to a litigant or attorney presents a danger\nof coercion that a political candidate\u2019s request to a con-\nstituent does not. But Canon 7C(1) does not narrowly\ntarget concerns about impartiality or its appearance; it ap-\nplies even when the person asked for a financial contribu-\ntion has no chance of ever appearing in the candidate\u2019s\ncourt. And Florida does not invoke concerns about coer-\ncion, presumably because the Canon bans solicitations re-\ngardless of whether their object is a lawyer, litigant, or\nother person vulnerable to judicial pressure. So Canon\n7C(1) fails exacting scrutiny and infringes the First\nAmendment.       This case should have been just that\nstraightforward.\n                              II\n  The Court concludes that Florida may prohibit personal\nsolicitations by judicial candidates as a means of preserv-\ning \u201cpublic confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.\u201d\nAnte, at 8. It purports to reach this destination by\napplying strict scrutiny, but it would be more accurate\nto say that it does so by applying the appearance of strict\n4            WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nscrutiny.\n                              A\n   The first sign that mischief is afoot comes when the\nCourt describes Florida\u2019s compelling interest. The State\nmust first identify its objective with precision before one\ncan tell whether that interest is compelling and whether\nthe speech restriction narrowly targets it. In White, for\nexample, the Court did not allow a State to invoke hazy\nconcerns about judicial impartiality in justification of an\nethics rule against judicial candidates\u2019 announcing their\npositions on legal issues. 536 U. S., at 775. The Court\ninstead separately analyzed the State\u2019s concerns about\njudges\u2019 bias against parties, preconceptions on legal is-\nsues, and openmindedness, and explained why each con-\ncern (and each for a different reason) did not suffice to\nsustain the rule. Id., at 775\u2013780.\n   In stark contrast to White, the Court today relies on\nFlorida\u2019s invocation of an ill-defined interest in \u201cpublic\nconfidence in judicial integrity.\u201d The Court at first sug-\ngests that \u201cjudicial integrity\u201d involves the \u201cability to ad-\nminister justice without fear or favor.\u201d Ante, at 9. As its\nopinion unfolds, however, today\u2019s concept of judicial integ-\nrity turns out to be \u201ca mere thing of wax in the hands of\nthe judiciary, which they may twist, and shape into any\nform they please.\u201d 12 The Works of Thomas Jefferson 137\n(P. Ford ed. 1905). When the Court explains how solicita-\ntion undermines confidence in judicial integrity, integrity\nstarts to sound like saintliness. It involves independence\nfrom any \u201c \u2018possible temptation\u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018might lead\u2019 \u201d the\njudge, \u201ceven unknowingly,\u201d to favor one party. Ante, at 11\n(emphasis added). When the Court turns to distinguish-\ning in-person solicitation from solicitation by proxy, the\nany-possible-temptation standard no longer helps and\nthus drops out. The critical factors instead become the\n\u201cpressure\u201d a listener feels during a solicitation and the\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

But when it comes\ntime to explain Florida\u2019s decision to allow candidates to\nwrite thank-you notes, the \u201cappearance that the candidate\n. . . remember[s] who says yes\u201d gets nary a mention. Ante,\nat 14\u201315. And when the Court confronts Florida\u2019s decision\nto prohibit mass-mailed solicitations, concern about pres-\nsure fades away. Ante, at 18. More outrageous still, the\nCourt at times molds the interest in the perception that\njudges have integrity into an interest in the perception\nthat judges do not solicit\u2014for example when it says, \u201call\npersonal solicitations by judicial candidates create a public\nappearance that undermines confidence in the integrity of\nthe judiciary; banning all personal solicitations by judicial\ncandidates is narrowly tailored to address that concern.\u201d\nAnte, at 19. This is not strict scrutiny; it is sleight of\nhand.\n                              B\n  The Court\u2019s twistifications have not come to an end;\nindeed, they are just beginning. In order to uphold Canon\n7C(1) under strict scrutiny, Florida must do more than\npoint to a vital public objective brooding overhead. The\nState must also meet a difficult burden of demonstrating\nthat the speech restriction substantially advances the\nclaimed objective. The State \u201cbears the risk of uncertainty,\u201d\nso \u201cambiguous proof will not suffice.\u201d Entertainment\nMerchants, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). In an arrest-\ning illustration, this Court held that a law punishing lies\nabout winning military decorations like the Congressional\nMedal of Honor failed exacting scrutiny, because the\nGovernment could not satisfy its \u201cheavy burden\u201d of prov-\ning that \u201cthe public\u2019s general perception of military\nawards is diluted by false claims.\u201d United States v. Alva-\nrez, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (plurality opinion) (slip op.,\nat 14).\n6             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n    Now that we have a case about the public\u2019s perception of\njudicial honor rather than its perception of military hon-\nors, the Justices of this Court change the rules. The Court\nannounces, on the basis of its \u201cintuiti[on],\u201d that allowing\npersonal solicitations will make litigants worry that\n\u201c \u2018judges\u2019 decisions may be motivated by the desire to repay\ncampaign contributions.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 11. But this case is not\nabout whether Yulee has the right to receive campaign\ncontributions. It is about whether she has the right to ask\nfor campaign contributions that Florida\u2019s statutory law\nalready allows her to receive. Florida bears the burden of\nshowing that banning requests for lawful contributions\nwill improve public confidence in judges\u2014not just a little\nbit, but significantly, because \u201cthe Government does not\nhave a compelling interest in each marginal percentage\npoint by which its goals are advanced.\u201d Entertainment\nMerchants, supra, at ___, n. 9 (slip op., at 16, n. 9).\n  Neither the Court nor the State identifies the slightest\nevidence that banning requests for contributions will\nsubstantially improve public trust in judges. Nor does\ncommon sense make this happy forecast obvious. The\nconcept of judicial integrity \u201cdates back at least eight\ncenturies,\u201d ante, at 9, and judicial elections in America\ndate back more than two centuries, supra, at 1\u2014but rules\nagainst personal solicitations date back only to 1972,\nsupra, at 2. The peaceful coexistence of judicial elections\nand personal solicitations for most of our history calls into\ndoubt any claim that allowing personal solicitations would\nimperil public faith in judges. Many States allow judicial\ncandidates to ask for contributions even today, but nobody\nsuggests that public confidence in judges fares worse in\nthese jurisdictions than elsewhere. And in any event, if\ncandidates\u2019 appeals for money are \u201c \u2018characteristically\nintertwined\u2019 \u201d with discussion of qualifications and views\non public issues, ante, at 7 (plurality opinion), how can the\nCourt be so sure that the public will regard them as im-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nproprieties rather than as legitimate instances of cam-\npaigning? In the final analysis, Florida comes nowhere\nnear making the convincing demonstration required by\nour cases that the speech restriction in this case substan-\ntially advances its objective.\n                               C\n   But suppose we play along with the premise that pro-\nhibiting solicitations will significantly improve the public\nreputation of judges. Even then, Florida must show that\nthe ban restricts no more speech than necessary to achieve\nthe objective. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.\nFCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989).\n   Canon 7C(1) falls miles short of satisfying this require-\nment. The Court seems to accept Florida\u2019s claim that\nsolicitations erode public confidence by creating the per-\nception that judges are selling justice to lawyers and\nlitigants. Ante, at 9. Yet the Canon prohibits candidates\nfrom asking for money from anybody\u2014even from someone\nwho is neither lawyer nor litigant, even from someone who\n(because of recusal rules) cannot possibly appear before\nthe candidate as lawyer or litigant. Yulee thus may not\ncall up an old friend, a cousin, or even her parents to ask\nfor a donation to her campaign. The State has not come\nup with a plausible explanation of how soliciting someone\nwho has no chance of appearing in the candidate\u2019s court\nwill diminish public confidence in judges.\n   No less important, Canon 7C(1) bans candidates from\nasking for contributions even in messages that do not\ntarget any listener in particular\u2014mass-mailed letters,\nflyers posted on telephone poles, speeches to large gather-\nings, and Web sites addressed to the general public. Mes-\nsages like these do not share the features that lead the\nCourt to pronounce personal solicitations a menace to\npublic confidence in the judiciary. Consider online solici-\ntations. They avoid \u201c \u2018the spectacle of lawyers or potential\n8             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nlitigants directly handing over money to judicial candi-\ndates,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 12. People who come across online solici-\ntations do not feel \u201cpressure\u201d to comply with the request,\nante, at 14. Nor does the candidate\u2019s signature on the\nonline solicitation suggest \u201cthat the candidate will re-\nmember who says yes, and who says no,\u201d ibid. Yet Canon\n7C(1) prohibits these and similar solicitations anyway.\nThis tailoring is as narrow as the Court\u2019s scrutiny is strict.\n   Perhaps sensing the fragility of the initial claim that all\nsolicitations threaten public confidence in judges, the\nCourt argues that \u201cthe lines Yulee asks [it] to draw are\nunworkable.\u201d Ante, at 18. That is a difficulty of the\nCourt\u2019s own imagination. In reality, the Court could have\nchosen from a whole spectrum of workable rules. It could\nhave held that States may regulate no more than solicita-\ntion of participants in pending cases, or solicitation of\npeople who are likely to appear in the candidate\u2019s court, or\neven solicitation of any lawyer or litigant. And it could\nhave ruled that candidates have the right to make fund-\nraising appeals that are not directed to any particular\nlistener (like requests in mass-mailed letters), or at least\nfundraising appeals plainly directed to the general public\n(like requests placed online). The Supreme Court of Flor-\nida has made similar accommodations in other settings. It\nallows sitting judges to solicit memberships in civic organ-\nizations if (among other things) the solicitee is not \u201clikely\never to appear before the court on which the judge serves.\u201d\nCode of Judicial Conduct for the State of Florida 23 (2014)\n(Judicial Conduct Code). And it allows sitting judges to\naccept gifts if (among other things) \u201cthe donor is not a\nparty or other person . . . whose interests have come or are\nlikely to come before the judge.\u201d Id., at 24. It is not too\nmuch to ask that the State show election speech similar\nconsideration.\n   The Court\u2019s accusation of unworkability also suffers\nfrom a bit of a pot-kettle problem. Consider the many\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nreal-world questions left open by today\u2019s decision. Does\nthe First Amendment permit restricting a candidate\u2019s\nappearing at an event where somebody else asks for cam-\npaign funds on his behalf? See Florida Judicial Ethics\nAdvisory Committee Opinion No. 2012\u201314 (JEAC Op.).\nDoes it permit prohibiting the candidate\u2019s family from\nmaking personal solicitations? See ibid. Does it allow\nprohibiting the candidate from participating in the crea-\ntion of a Web site that solicits funds, even if the candi-\ndate\u2019s name does not appear next to the request? See\nJEAC Op. No. 2008\u201311. More broadly, could Florida ban\nthank-you notes to donors? Cap a candidate\u2019s campaign\nspending? Restrict independent spending by people other\nthan the candidate? Ban independent spending by corpo-\nrations? And how, by the way, are judges supposed to\ndecide whether these measures promote public confidence\nin judicial integrity, when the Court does not even have a\nconsistent theory about what it means by \u201cjudicial integ-\nrity\u201d? For the Court to wring its hands about workability\nunder these circumstances is more than one should have\nto bear.\n                              D\n  Even if Florida could show that banning all personal\nappeals for campaign funds is necessary to protect public\nconfidence in judicial integrity, the Court must overpower\none last sentinel of free speech before it can uphold Canon\n7C(1). Among its other functions, the First Amendment is\na kind of Equal Protection Clause for ideas. The state\nordinarily may not regulate one message because it harms\na government interest yet refuse to regulate other mes-\nsages that impair the interest in a comparable way. Ap-\nplying this principle, we invalidated a law that prohibited\npicketing dwellings but made an exception for picketing\nabout labor issues; the State could not show that labor\npicketing harmed its asserted interest in residential pri-\n10              WILLIAMS-YULEE v.

In another case, we\nset aside a ban on showing movies containing nudity in\ndrive-in theaters, because the government did not demon-\nstrate that movies with nude scenes would distract pass-\ning drivers any more than, say, movies with violent\nscenes. Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 214\u2013215\n(1975).\n   The Court\u2019s decision disregards these principles. The\nCourt tells us that \u201call personal solicitations by judicial\ncandidates create a public appearance that undermines\nconfidence in the integrity of the judiciary.\u201d Ante, at 19.\nBut Canon 7C(1) does not restrict all personal solicita-\ntions; it restricts only personal solicitations related to\ncampaigns. The part of the Canon challenged here prohib-\nits personal pleas for \u201ccampaign funds,\u201d and the Canon\nelsewhere prohibits personal appeals to attorneys for\n\u201cpublicly stated support.\u201d Judicial Conduct Code 38. So\nalthough Canon 7C(1) prevents Yulee from asking a law-\nyer for a few dollars to help her buy campaign pamphlets,\nit does not prevent her asking the same lawyer for a per-\nsonal loan, access to his law firm\u2019s luxury suite at the local\nfootball stadium, or even a donation to help her fight the\nFlorida Bar\u2019s charges. What could possibly justify these\ndistinctions? Surely the Court does not believe that re-\nquests for campaign favors erode public confidence in a\nway that requests for favors unrelated to elections do not.\nCould anyone say with a straight face that it looks worse\nfor a candidate to say \u201cplease give my campaign $25\u201d than\nto say \u201cplease give me $25\u201d?*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Neither Florida nor the Court identifies any other ethics rule that\nwould prevent candidates like Yulee from asking for favors unrelated to\nelections, and I know of none. The Supreme Court of Florida has\nadopted various rules restricting sitting judges\u2019 solicitation and ac-\nceptance of favors, but these rules do not bind challengers like Yulee.\n                      Cite as: 575 U.

This analysis elides the\ndistinction between selectivity on the basis of content and\nselectivity on other grounds. Because the First Amend-\nment does not prohibit underinclusiveness as such, law-\nmakers may target a problem only at certain times or in\ncertain places. Because the First Amendment does pro-\nhibit content discrimination as such, lawmakers may not\ntarget a problem only in certain messages. Explaining\nthis distinction, we have said that the First Amendment\nwould allow banning obscenity \u201conly in certain media or\nmarkets\u201d but would preclude banning \u201conly that obscenity\nwhich includes offensive political messages.\u201d R. A. V. v.\nSt. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 387\u2013388 (1992) (emphasis delet-\ned). This case involves selectivity on the basis of content.\nThe Florida Supreme Court has decided to eliminate the\nappearances associated with \u201cpersonal appeals for money,\u201d\nante, at 18, when the appeals seek money for a campaign\nbut not when the appeals seek money for other purposes.\nThat distinction violates the First Amendment. See\nErznoznik, supra, at 215.\n  Even on the Court\u2019s own terms, Canon 7C(1) cannot\nstand. The Court concedes that \u201cunderinclusiveness can\nraise \u2018doubts about whether the government is in fact\npursuing the interest it invokes.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 13. Canon\n7C(1)\u2019s scope suggests that it has nothing to do with the\nappearances created by judges\u2019 asking for money, and\neverything to do with hostility toward judicial campaign-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSee, e.g., Canon 4D(2)(a), Judicial Conduct Code 18\u201319 (\u201cA judge as [a\nmember or officer of an organization] . . . shall not personally or directly\nparticipate in the solicitation of funds . . . \u201d); Canon 5D(5), id., at 24 (\u201cA\njudge shall not accept . . . a gift, bequest, favor or loan . . .\u201d); JEAC Op.\nNo. 2010\u201314 (\u201c[J]udicial candidates are only governed by Canon 7, and\nnot by the remainder of the Code of Judicial Conduct\u201d).\n12           WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ning. How else to explain the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision to ban all personal appeals for campaign funds\n(even when the solicitee could never appear before the\ncandidate), but to tolerate appeals for other kinds of funds\n(even when the solicitee will surely appear before the\ncandidate)? It should come as no surprise that the ABA,\nwhose model rules the Florida Supreme Court followed\nwhen framing Canon 7C(1), opposes judicial elections\u2014\npreferring instead a system in which (surprise!) a commit-\ntee of lawyers proposes candidates from among whom the\nGovernor must make his selection. See White, 536 U. S.,\nat 787.\n   The Court tries to strike a pose of neutrality between\nappointment and election of judges, but no one should be\ndeceived. A Court that sees impropriety in a candidate\u2019s\nrequest for any contributions to his election campaign does\nnot much like judicial selection by the people. One cannot\nhave judicial elections without judicial campaigns, and\njudicial campaigns without funds for campaigning, and\nfunds for campaigning without asking for them. When a\nsociety decides that its judges should be elected, it neces-\nsarily decides that selection by the people is more im-\nportant than the oracular sanctity of judges, their immun-\nity from the (shudder!) indignity of begging for funds, and\ntheir exemption from those shadows of impropriety that\nfall over the proletarian public officials who must run for\noffice. A free society, accustomed to electing its rulers,\ndoes not much care whether the rulers operate through\nstatute and executive order, or through judicial distortion\nof statute, executive order, and constitution. The prescrip-\ntion that judges be elected probably springs from the\npeople\u2019s realization that their judges can become their\nrulers\u2014and (it must be said) from just a deep-down feel-\ning that members of the Third Branch will profit from a\nhearty helping of humble pie, and from a severe reduction\nof their great remove from the (ugh!) People. (It should\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

In any case, hostility to campaigning by\njudges entitles the people of Florida to amend their Con-\nstitution to replace judicial elections with the selection of\njudges by lawyers\u2019 committees; it does not entitle the\nFlorida Supreme Court to adopt, or this Court to endorse,\na rule of judicial conduct that abridges candidates\u2019 speech\nin the judicial elections that the Florida Constitution\nprescribes.\n                          *    *    *\n   This Court has not been shy to enforce the First\nAmendment in recent Terms\u2014even in cases that do not\ninvolve election speech. It has accorded robust protection\nto depictions of animal torture, sale of violent video games\nto children, and lies about having won military medals.\nSee United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. 460 (2010); Enter-\ntainment Merchants, 564 U. S. ___; Alvarez, 567 U. S. ___.\nWho would have thought that the same Court would today\nexert such heroic efforts to save so plain an abridgement of\nthe freedom of speech? It is no great mystery what is\ngoing on here. The judges of this Court, like the judges of\nthe Supreme Court of Florida who promulgated Canon\n7C(1), evidently consider the preservation of public respect\nfor the courts a policy objective of the highest order. So it\nis\u2014but so too are preventing animal torture, protecting\nthe innocence of children, and honoring valiant soldiers.\nThe Court did not relax the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of\nfreedom of speech when legislatures pursued those goals;\nit should not relax the guarantee when the Supreme Court\nof Florida pursues this one.

It is\nwritten to underscore, too, the irony in the Court\u2019s having\nweakened the rigors of the First Amendment in a case\nconcerning elections, a paradigmatic forum for speech and\na process intended to protect freedom in so many other\nmanifestations.\n  First Amendment protections are both personal and\nstructural. Free speech begins with the right of each\nperson to think and then to express his or her own ideas.\nProtecting this personal sphere of intellect and conscience,\nin turn, creates structural safeguards for many of the\nprocesses that define a free society. The individual speech\nhere is political speech. The process is a fair election.\nThese realms ought to be the last place, not the first, for\nthe Court to allow unprecedented content-based re-\nstrictions on speech. See Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401\nU. S. 265, 272 (1971) (the First Amendment has its \u201cfullest\nand most urgent application precisely to the conduct of\n2             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncampaigns for political office\u201d). As James Madison ob-\nserved: \u201cA popular Government, without popular infor-\nmation, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a\nFarce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. [A] people who\nmean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves\nwith the power which knowledge gives.\u201d Letter to William\nT. Berry (Aug. 4, 1822), in J. Madison, Writings 790\n(J. Rakove ed. 1999). The Court\u2019s decision in this case im-\nperils the content neutrality essential both for individual\nspeech and the election process.\n   With all due respect for the Court, it seems fair and\nnecessary to say its decision rests on two premises, neither\none correct. One premise is that in certain elections\u2014here\nan election to choose the best qualified judge\u2014the public\nlacks the necessary judgment to make an informed choice.\nInstead, the State must protect voters by altering the\nusual dynamics of free speech. The other premise is that\nsince judges should be accorded special respect and dig-\nnity, their election can be subject to certain content-based\nrules that would be unacceptable in other elections. In my\nrespectful view neither premise can justify the speech\nrestriction at issue here. Although States have a compel-\nling interest in seeking to ensure the appearance and the\nreality of an impartial judiciary, it does not follow that the\nState may alter basic First Amendment principles in\npursuing that goal. See Republican Party of Minn. v.\nWhite, 536 U. S. 765, 788 (2002).\n   While any number of troubling consequences will follow\nfrom the Court\u2019s ruling, a simple example can suffice to\nillustrate the dead weight its decision now ties to public\ndebate. Assume a judge retires, and two honest lawyers,\nDoe and Roe, seek the vacant position. Doe is a respected,\nprominent lawyer who has been active in the community\nand is well known to business and civic leaders. Roe, a\nlawyer of extraordinary ability and high ethical standards,\nkeeps a low profile. As soon as Doe announces his or her\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncandidacy, a campaign committee organizes of its own\naccord and begins raising funds. But few know or hear\nabout Roe\u2019s potential candidacy, and no one with resources\nor connections is available to assist in raising the funds\nnecessary for even a modest plan to speak to the elec-\ntorate. Today the Court says the State can censor Roe\u2019s\nspeech, imposing a gag on his or her request for funds, no\nmatter how close Roe is to the potential benefactor or\ndonor. The result is that Roe\u2019s personal freedom, the right\nof speech, is cut off by the State.\n   The First Amendment consequences of the Court\u2019s\nruling do not end with its denial of the individual\u2019s right to\nspeak. For the very purpose of the candidate\u2019s fundraising\nwas to facilitate a larger speech process: an election cam-\npaign. By cutting off one candidate\u2019s personal freedom to\nspeak, the broader campaign debate that might have\nfollowed\u2014a debate that might have been informed by new\nideas and insights from both candidates\u2014now is silenced.\n   Elections are a paradigmatic forum for speech. Though\npresent day campaign rhetoric all too often might thwart\nor obscure deliberative discourse, the idea of elections is\nthat voters can engage in, or at least consider, a principled\ndebate. That debate can be a means to find consensus for\na civic course that is prudent and wise. This pertains both\nto issues and to the choice of elected officials. The First\nAmendment seeks to make the idea of discussion, open\ndebate, and consensus-building a reality. But the Court\ndecides otherwise. The Court locks the First Amendment\nout.\n   Whether an election is the best way to choose a judge is\nitself the subject of fair debate. But once the people of a\nState choose to have elections, the First Amendment\nprotects the candidate\u2019s right to speak and the public\u2019s\nensuing right to open and robust debate. See ibid. One\nadvantage of judicial elections is the opportunity offered\nfor the public to become more knowledgeable about their\n4             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncourts and their law. This might stimulate discourse over\nthe requisite and highest ethical standards for the judici-\nary, including whether the people should elect a judge who\npersonally solicits campaign funds. Yet now that teaching\nprocess is hindered by state censorship. By allowing the\nState\u2019s speech restriction, the Court undermines the\neducational process that free speech in elections should\nfacilitate.\n  It is not within our Nation\u2019s First Amendment tradition\nto abridge speech simply because the government believes\na question is too difficult or too profound for voters. If the\nState is concerned about unethical campaign practices, it\nneed not revert to the assumption that voters themselves\nare insensitive to ethics. Judicial elections were created to\nenable citizens to decide for themselves which judges are\nbest qualified and which are most likely to \u201cstand by the\nconstitution of the State against the encroachment of\npower.\u201d Report of the Debates and Proceedings of the\nConvention for the Revision of the Constitution of the\nState of New York 672 (1846). The Court should not now\npresume citizens are unequipped for that task when it\ncomes to judging for themselves who should judge them.\n  If there is concern about principled, decent, and\nthoughtful discourse in election campaigns, the First\nAmendment provides the answer. That answer is more\nspeech. See, e.g., Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 377\n(1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (when the government\nobjects to speech, \u201cthe remedy to be applied is more\nspeech, not enforced silence\u201d). For example, candidates\nmight themselves agree to appoint members of a panel\ncharged with periodic evaluation of campaign statements,\ncandor, and fairness. Those evaluations could be made\npublic. And any number of private organizations or voter\ngroups seeking to evaluate campaign rhetoric could do the\nsame. See White, supra, at 795 (KENNEDY, J. concurring).\n  Modern communication technologies afford voters and\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncandidates an unparalleled opportunity to engage in the\ncampaign and election process. These technologies may\nencourage a discourse that is principled and informed.\nThe Internet, in particular, has increased in a dramatic\nway the rapidity and pervasiveness with which ideas may\nspread. Whether as a result of disclosure laws or a candi-\ndate\u2019s voluntary decision to make the campaign transpar-\nent, the Internet can reveal almost at once how a candi-\ndate sought funds; who the donors were; and what\namounts they gave. Indeed, disclosure requirements offer\na powerful, speech-enhancing method of deterring corrup-\ntion\u2014one that does not impose limits on how and when\npeople can speak. See Doe v. Reed, 561 U. S. 186, 199\n(2010) (\u201cPublic disclosure also promotes transparency and\naccountability in the electoral process to an extent other\nmeasures cannot\u201d). Based on disclosures the voters can\ndecide, among other matters, whether the public is well\nserved by an elected judiciary; how each candidate defines\nappropriate campaign conduct (which may speak volumes\nabout his or her judicial demeanor); and what persons and\ngroups support or oppose a particular candidate. See\nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 67 (1976) (per curiam). With\ndetailed information about a candidate\u2019s practices in\nsoliciting funds, voters may be better informed in choosing\nthose judges who are prepared to do justice \u201cwithout fear\nor favor.\u201d 10 Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England 105\n(2d ed. 1908). The speech the Court now holds foreclosed\nmight itself have been instructive in this regard, and it\ncould have been open to the electorate\u2019s scrutiny. Judicial\nelections, no less than other elections, presuppose faith in\ndemocracy. Judicial elections are no exception to the\npremise that elections can teach.\n   In addition to narrowing the First Amendment\u2019s reach,\nthere is another flaw in the Court\u2019s analysis. That is its\nerror in the application of strict scrutiny. The Court\u2019s\nevisceration of that judicial standard now risks long-term\n6             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nharm to what was once the Court\u2019s own preferred First\nAmendment test. As JUSTICE SCALIA well explains, the\nstate law at issue fails strict scrutiny for any number of\nreasons. The candidate who is not wealthy or well con-\nnected cannot ask even a close friend or relative for a bit of\nfinancial help, despite the lack of any increased risk of\npartiality and despite the fact that disclosure laws might\nbe enacted to make the solicitation and support public.\nThis law comes nowhere close to being narrowly tailored.\nAnd by saying that it survives that vital First Amendment\nrequirement, the Court now writes what is literally a\ncasebook guide to eviscerating strict scrutiny any time the\nCourt encounters speech it dislikes. On these premises,\nand for the reasons explained in more detail by JUSTICE\nSCALIA, it is necessary for me to file this respectful dissent.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

The Florida rule before us regulates speech\nthat is part of the process of selecting those who wield the\npower of the State. Such speech lies at the heart of the\nprotection provided by the First Amendment. The Florida\nrule regulates that speech based on content and must\ntherefore satisfy strict scrutiny. This means that it must\nbe narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest.\nFlorida has a compelling interest in making sure that its\ncourts decide cases impartially and in accordance with the\nlaw and that its citizens have no good reason to lack confi-\ndence that its courts are performing their proper role. But\nthe Florida rule is not narrowly tailored to serve that\ninterest.\n  Indeed, this rule is about as narrowly tailored as a\nburlap bag. It applies to all solicitations made in the\nname of a candidate for judicial office\u2014including, as was\nthe case here, a mass mailing. It even applies to an ad in\na newspaper. It applies to requests for contributions in\nany amount, and it applies even if the person solicited is\nnot a lawyer, has never had any interest at stake in any\ncase in the court in question, and has no prospect of ever\nhaving any interest at stake in any litigation in that court.\n2             WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nIf this rule can be characterized as narrowly tailored, then\nnarrow tailoring has no meaning, and strict scrutiny,\nwhich is essential to the protection of free speech, is seri-\nously impaired.\n   When petitioner sent out a form letter requesting cam-\npaign contributions, she was well within her First\nAmendment rights. The Florida Supreme Court violated\nthe Constitution when it imposed a financial penalty and\nstained her record with a finding that she had engaged in\nunethical conduct. I would reverse the judgment of the\nFlorida Supreme Court.\n</pre>",
