EQUAL EMPLOYMENT \n\n            OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 13\u20131019. Argued January 13, 2015\u2014Decided April 29, 2015\nBefore suing an employer for employment discrimination under Title\n  VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Employment Oppor-\n  tunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) must first \u201cendeavor to\n  eliminate [the] alleged unlawful employment practice by informal\n  methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a72000e\u20135(b). Once the Commission determines that conciliation has\n  failed, it may file suit in federal court. \u00a72000e\u20135(f)(1). However,\n  \u201c[n]othing said or done during\u201d conciliation may be \u201cused as evidence\n  in a subsequent proceeding without written consent of the persons\n  concerned.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(b).\n     After investigating a sex discrimination charge against petitioner\n  Mach Mining, LLC, respondent EEOC determined that reasonable\n  cause existed to believe that the company had engaged in unlawful\n  hiring practices. The Commission sent a letter inviting Mach Mining\n  and the complainant to participate in informal conciliation proceed-\n  ings and notifying them that a representative would be contacting\n  them to begin the process. About a year later, the Commission sent\n  Mach Mining another letter stating that it had determined that con-\n  ciliation efforts had been unsuccessful. The Commission then sued\n  Mach Mining in federal court. In its answer, Mach Mining alleged\n  that the Commission had not attempted to conciliate in good faith.\n  The Commission countered that its conciliation efforts were not sub-\n  ject to judicial review and that, regardless, the two letters it sent to\n  Mach Mining provided adequate proof that it had fulfilled its statuto-\n  ry duty. The District Court agreed that it could review the adequacy\n  of the Commission\u2019s efforts, but granted the Commission leave to\n  immediately appeal. The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the\n2                    MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    Commission\u2019s statutory conciliation obligation was unreviewable.\nHeld:\n    1. Courts have authority to review whether the EEOC has fulfilled\n its Title VII duty to attempt conciliation. This Court has recognized\n a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that Congress means to allow judicial review\n of administrative action. Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family\n Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 670. That presumption is rebuttable when\n a statute\u2019s language or structure demonstrates that Congress intend-\n ed an agency to police itself. Block v. Community Nutrition Institute,\n 467 U. S. 340, 349, 351. But nothing rebuts that presumption here.\n    By its choice of language, Congress imposed a mandatory duty on\n the EEOC to attempt conciliation and made that duty a precondition\n to filing a lawsuit. Such compulsory prerequisites are routinely en-\n forced by courts in Title VII litigation. And though Congress gave the\n EEOC wide latitude to choose which \u201cinformal methods\u201d to use, it did\n not deprive courts of judicially manageable criteria by which to re-\n view the conciliation process. By its terms, the statutory obligation\n to attempt conciliation necessarily entails communication between\n the parties concerning the alleged unlawful employment practice.\n The statute therefore requires the EEOC to notify the employer of\n the claim and give the employer an opportunity to discuss the matter.\n In enforcing that statutory condition, a court applies a manageable\n standard. Pp. 4\u20138.\n    2. The appropriate scope of judicial review of the EEOC\u2019s concilia-\n tion activities is narrow, enforcing only the EEOC\u2019s statutory obliga-\n tion to give the employer notice and an opportunity to achieve volun-\n tary compliance.        This limited review respects the expansive\n discretion that Title VII gives the EEOC while still ensuring that it\n follows the law.\n    The Government\u2019s suggestion that review be limited to checking\n the facial validity of its two letters to Mach Mining falls short of Title\n VII\u2019s demands. That standard would merely accept the EEOC\u2019s word\n that it followed the law, whereas the aim of judicial review is to veri-\n fy that the EEOC actually tried to conciliate a discrimination charge.\n Citing the standard set out in the National Labor Relations Act,\n Mach Mining proposes review for whether the EEOC engaged in\n good-faith negotiation, laying out a number of specific requirements\n to implement that standard. But the NLRA\u2019s process-based approach\n provides a poor analogy for Title VII, which ultimately cares about\n substantive outcomes and eschews any reciprocal duty to negotiate in\n good faith. Mach Mining\u2019s proposed code of conduct also conflicts\n with the wide latitude Congress gave the Commission to decide how\n to conduct and when to end conciliation efforts. And because infor-\n mation obtained during conciliation would be necessary evidence in a\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  good-faith determination proceeding, Mach Mining\u2019s brand of review\n  would violate Title VII\u2019s confidentiality protections.\n     The proper scope of review thus matches the terms of Title VII\u2019s\n  conciliation provision. In order to comply with that provision, the\n  EEOC must inform the employer about the specific discrimination al-\n  legation. Such notice must describe what the employer has done and\n  which employees (or class of employees) have suffered. And the\n  EEOC must try to engage the employer in a discussion in order to\n  give the employer a chance to remedy the allegedly discriminatory\n  practice. A sworn affidavit from the EEOC stating that it has per-\n  formed these obligations should suffice to show that it has met the\n  conciliation requirement. Should the employer present concrete evi-\n  dence that the EEOC did not provide the requisite information about\n  the charge or attempt to engage in a discussion about conciliating the\n  claim, a court must conduct the factfinding necessary to resolve that\n  limited dispute. Should it find for the employer, the appropriate\n  remedy is to order the EEOC to undertake the mandated conciliation\n  efforts.

EQUAL EM-\n    PLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [April 29, 2015] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Before suing an employer for discrimination, the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commis-\nsion) must try to remedy unlawful workplace practices\nthrough informal methods of conciliation. This case re-\nquires us to decide whether and how courts may review\nthose efforts. We hold that a court may review whether\nthe EEOC satisfied its statutory obligation to attempt\nconciliation before filing suit. But we find that the scope\nof that review is narrow, thus recognizing the EEOC\u2019s\nextensive discretion to determine the kind and amount of\ncommunication with an employer appropriate in any given\ncase.\n                              I\n  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 241,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e et seq., sets out a detailed, multi-step\nprocedure through which the Commission enforces the\nstatute\u2019s prohibition on employment discrimination. The\nprocess generally starts when \u201ca person claiming to be\naggrieved\u201d files a charge of an unlawful workplace practice\nwith the EEOC. \u00a72000e\u20135(b). At that point, the EEOC\n2               MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnotifies the employer of the complaint and undertakes an\ninvestigation. See ibid. If the Commission finds no \u201crea-\nsonable cause\u201d to think that the allegation has merit, it\ndismisses the charge and notifies the parties. Ibid. The\ncomplainant may then pursue her own lawsuit if she\nchooses. See \u00a72000e\u20135(f )(1).\n  If, on the other hand, the Commission finds reasonable\ncause, it must first \u201cendeavor to eliminate [the] alleged\nunlawful employment practice by informal methods of\nconference, conciliation, and persuasion.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(b). To\nensure candor in those discussions, the statute limits the\ndisclosure and use of the participants\u2019 statements: \u201cNoth-\ning said or done during and as a part of such informal\nendeavors\u201d may be publicized by the Commission or \u201cused\nas evidence in a subsequent proceeding without the writ-\nten consent of the persons concerned.\u201d Ibid. The statute\nleaves to the EEOC the ultimate decision whether to\naccept a settlement or instead to bring a lawsuit. So long\nas \u201cthe Commission has been unable to secure from the\nrespondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to the\nCommission\u201d itself, the EEOC may sue the employer.\n\u00a72000e\u20135(f )(1).\n  This case began when a woman filed a charge with the\nEEOC claiming that petitioner Mach Mining, LLC, had\nrefused to hire her as a coal miner because of her sex. The\nCommission investigated the allegation and found reason-\nable cause to believe that Mach Mining had discriminated\nagainst the complainant, along with a class of women who\nhad similarly applied for mining jobs. See App. 15. In a\nletter announcing that determination, the EEOC invited\nboth the company and the complainant to participate in\n\u201cinformal methods\u201d of dispute resolution, promising that a\nCommission representative would soon \u201ccontact [them] to\nbegin the conciliation process.\u201d Id., at 16. The record does\nnot disclose what happened next. But about a year later,\nthe Commission sent Mach Mining a second letter, stating\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat \u201csuch conciliation efforts as are required by law have\noccurred and have been unsuccessful\u201d and that any fur-\nther efforts would be \u201cfutile.\u201d Id., at 18\u201319.\n   The EEOC then sued Mach Mining in federal district\ncourt alleging sex discrimination in hiring. The Commis-\nsion\u2019s complaint maintained that \u201c[a]ll conditions prece-\ndent to the institution of this lawsuit\u201d\u2014including an\nattempt to end the challenged practice through concilia-\ntion\u2014\u201cha[d] been fulfilled.\u201d Id., at 22. In its answer,\nMach Mining contested that statement, asserting that the\nEEOC had failed to \u201cconciliat[e] in good faith\u201d prior to\nfiling suit. Id., at 30.\n   The Commission subsequently moved for summary\njudgment on that issue, contending that its \u201cconciliation\nefforts are not subject to judicial review.\u201d Motion for\nSummary Judgment in No. 3:11\u2013cv\u201300879 (SD Ill.), p. 1.\nAt most, the Commission argued, the court could inspect\nthe EEOC\u2019s two letters to Mach Mining to confirm that the\nEEOC had met its duty to attempt conciliation. See id., at\n11, 19. Mach Mining responded by urging the court to\nconsider the overall \u201creasonable[ness]\u201d of the EEOC\u2019s\nefforts, based on evidence the company would present\nabout the conciliation process. Memorandum in Opposi-\ntion to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in No. 3:11\u2013\ncv\u201300879 (SD Ill.), p. 20. The trial court agreed with Mach\nMining that it should review whether the Commission had\nmade \u201ca sincere and reasonable effort to negotiate.\u201d Civ.\nNo. 11\u2013879 (SD Ill., Jan. 28, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n40a, 2013 WL 319337, *5 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). At the EEOC\u2019s request, the court then authorized an\nimmediate appeal of its ruling. See Civ. No. 11\u2013879 (SD\nIll., May 20, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a\u201355a, 2013\nWL 2177770, *5\u2013*6; 28 U. S. C. \u00a71292(b).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed,\nholding that \u201cthe statutory directive to attempt concilia-\ntion\u201d is \u201cnot subject to judicial review.\u201d 738 F. 3d 171, 177\n4                  MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n(2013). According to the court, that provision entrusts\nconciliation \u201csolely to the EEOC\u2019s expert judgment\u201d and\nthus provides no \u201cworkable standard\u201d of review for courts\nto apply. Id., at 174, 177. The Seventh Circuit further\nreasoned that judicial review of the conciliation process\nwould \u201cundermine enforcement of Title VII\u201d by \u201cpro-\ntract[ing] and complicat[ing]\u201d discrimination suits. Id., at\n178\u2013179 (quoting Doe v. Oberweis Diary, 456 F. 3d 704,\n710 (CA7 2006)). In its concluding paragraph, however,\nthe court indicated that it had in fact subjected the\nEEOC\u2019s activities to a smidgen of review: Because the\nCommission \u201cpled on the face of its complaint that it ha[d]\ncomplied with all\u201d prerequisites to suit and because its two\nletters to Mach Mining were \u201cfacially sufficient\u201d to show\nthat conciliation had occurred, the court stated, \u201cour re-\nview of [that process] is satisfied.\u201d 738 F. 3d, at 184.\n  Other Courts of Appeals have held that Title VII allows\njudicial review of the EEOC\u2019s conciliation efforts, but\nwithout agreeing on what that review entails.1 We granted\ncertiorari, 573 U. S. ___ (2014), to address whether and\nto what extent such an attempt to conciliate is subject to\njudicial consideration.\n                             II\n   Congress rarely intends to prevent courts from enforcing\nits directives to federal agencies. For that reason, this\nCourt applies a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d favoring judicial\nreview of administrative action. Bowen v. Michigan Acad-\nemy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 670 (1986). That\npresumption is rebuttable: It fails when a statute\u2019s lan-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See, e.g., EEOC v. Asplundh Tree Expert Co., 340 F. 3d 1256, 1259\n\n(CA11 2003) (holding that the EEOC must, among other things, \u201cre-\nspond in a reasonable and flexible manner to the reasonable attitudes\nof the employer\u201d); EEOC v. Keco Industries, Inc., 748 F. 2d 1097, 1102\n(CA6 1984) (holding that the EEOC must \u201cmake a good faith effort to\nconciliate\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nguage or structure demonstrates that Congress wanted an\nagency to police its own conduct. See Block v. Community\nNutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 349, 351 (1984). But the\nagency bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d in attempting to show that\nCongress \u201cprohibit[ed] all judicial review\u201d of the agency\u2019s\ncompliance with a legislative mandate.            Dunlop v.\nBachowski, 421 U. S. 560, 567 (1975).\n   Title VII, as the Government acknowledges, imposes a\nduty on the EEOC to attempt conciliation of a discrimina-\ntion charge prior to filing a lawsuit. See Brief for Re-\nspondent 20. That obligation is a key component of the\nstatutory scheme. In pursuing the goal of \u201cbring[ing]\nemployment discrimination to an end,\u201d Congress chose\n\u201c[c]ooperation and voluntary compliance\u201d as its \u201cpreferred\nmeans.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U. S. 219, 228\n(1982) (quoting Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415\nU. S. 36, 44 (1974)). Accordingly, the statute provides, as\nearlier noted, that the Commission \u201cshall endeavor to\neliminate [an] alleged unlawful employment practice by\ninformal methods of conference, conciliation, and persua-\nsion.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(b); see supra, at 2. That language is\nmandatory, not precatory. Cf. National Railroad Passen-\nger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 109 (2002)\n(noting that the word \u201cshall\u201d admits of no discretion). And\nthe duty it imposes serves as a necessary precondition to\nfiling a lawsuit. Only if the Commission is \u201cunable to\nsecure\u201d an acceptable conciliation agreement\u2014that is, only\nif its attempt to conciliate has failed\u2014may a claim against\nthe employer go forward. \u00a72000e\u20135(f )(1).\n   Courts routinely enforce such compulsory prerequisites\nto suit in Title VII litigation (and in many other contexts\nbesides). An employee, for example, may bring a Title VII\nclaim only if she has first filed a timely charge with the\nEEOC\u2014and a court will usually dismiss a complaint for\nfailure to do so. See, e.g., id., at 104\u2013105, 114\u2013115. Simi-\nlarly, an employee must obtain a right-to-sue letter before\n6                MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbringing suit\u2014and a court will typically insist on satisfac-\ntion of that condition. See, e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nv. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 798 (1973); see also, e.g., Hall-\nstrom v. Tillamook County, 493 U. S. 20, 26 (1989) (up-\nholding dismissal of an environmental suit for failure to\ncomply with a notice provision serving as a \u201ccondition\nprecedent\u201d); United States v. Zucca, 351 U. S. 91 (1956)\n(affirming dismissal of a denaturalization suit because of\nthe Government\u2019s failure to comply with a mandatory\nprerequisite). That ordinary part of Title VII litigation\u2014\nsee a prerequisite to suit, enforce a prerequisite to suit\u2014\nsupports judicial review of the EEOC\u2019s compliance with\nthe law\u2019s conciliation provision.\n   The Government, reiterating the Seventh Circuit\u2019s view,\ncontests that conclusion, arguing that Title VII provides\n\u201cno standards by which to judge\u201d the EEOC\u2019s performance\nof its statutory duty. Brief for Respondent 17. The Gov-\nernment highlights the broad leeway the statute gives the\nEEOC to decide how to engage in, and when to give up on,\nconciliation. In granting that discretion, the Government\ncontends, Congress deprived courts of any \u201cjudicially\nmanageable\u201d criteria with which to review the EEOC\u2019s\nefforts. Id., at 36 (quoting Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S.\n821, 830 (1985)). And in that way Congress \u201cdemon-\nstrate[d] [its] intention to preclude judicial review.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 39.\n   But in thus denying that Title VII creates a \u201creviewable\nprerequisite to suit,\u201d the Government takes its observation\nabout discretion too far. Id., at 37 (quoting 738 F. 3d, at\n175). Yes, the statute provides the EEOC with wide lati-\ntude over the conciliation process, and that feature be-\ncomes significant when we turn to defining the proper\nscope of judicial review. See infra, at 10\u201311. But no,\nCongress has not left everything to the Commission.\nConsider if the EEOC declined to make any attempt to\nconciliate a claim\u2014if, after finding reasonable cause to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupport a charge, the EEOC took the employer straight to\ncourt. In such a case, Title VII would offer a perfectly\nserviceable standard for judicial review: Without any\n\u201cendeavor\u201d at all, the EEOC would have failed to satisfy a\nnecessary condition of litigation.\n   Still more, the statute provides certain concrete stand-\nards pertaining to what that endeavor must entail. Again,\nthink of how the statute describes the obligatory attempt:\n\u201cto eliminate [the] alleged unlawful employment practice\nby informal methods of conference, conciliation, and per-\nsuasion.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(b). Those specified methods neces-\nsarily involve communication between parties, including\nthe exchange of information and views. As one dictionary\nvariously defines the terms, they involve \u201cconsultation or\ndiscussion,\u201d an attempt to \u201creconcile\u201d different positions,\nand a \u201cmeans of argument, reasoning, or entreaty.\u201d Amer-\nican Heritage Dictionary 385, 382, 1318 (5th ed. 2011).\nThat communication, moreover, concerns a particular\nthing: the \u201calleged unlawful employment practice.\u201d So the\nEEOC, to meet the statutory condition, must tell the\nemployer about the claim\u2014essentially, what practice has\nharmed which person or class\u2014and must provide the\nemployer with an opportunity to discuss the matter in an\neffort to achieve voluntary compliance. See also infra, at\n13. If the Commission does not take those specified ac-\ntions, it has not satisfied Title VII\u2019s requirement to at-\ntempt conciliation. And in insisting that the Commission\ndo so, as the statutory language directs, a court applies a\nmanageable standard.\n   Absent such review, the Commission\u2019s compliance with\nthe law would rest in the Commission\u2019s hands alone. We\nneed not doubt the EEOC\u2019s trustworthiness, or its fidelity\nto law, to shy away from that result. We need only\nknow\u2014and know that Congress knows\u2014that legal lapses\nand violations occur, and especially so when they have no\nconsequence. That is why this Court has so long applied a\n8               MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstrong presumption favoring judicial review of administra-\ntive action. See supra, at 4\u20135. Nothing overcomes that\npresumption with respect to the EEOC\u2019s duty to attempt\nconciliation of employment discrimination claims.\n                              III\n  That conclusion raises a second dispute between the\nparties: What is the proper scope of judicial review of the\nEEOC\u2019s conciliation activities? The Government (once\nhaving accepted the necessity for some review) proposes\nthat courts rely solely on facial examination of certain\nEEOC documents. Mach Mining argues for far more\nintrusive review, in part analogizing to the way judges\nsuperintend bargaining between employers and unions.\nWe accept neither suggestion, because we think neither\nconsistent with the choices Congress made in enacting\nTitle VII. The appropriate scope of review enforces the\nstatute\u2019s requirements as just described\u2014in brief, that the\nEEOC afford the employer a chance to discuss and rectify\na specified discriminatory practice\u2014but goes no further.\nSee supra, at 7; infra, at 13. Such limited review respects\nthe expansive discretion that Title VII gives to the EEOC\nover the conciliation process, while still ensuring that the\nCommission follows the law.\n  The Government argues for the most minimalist form of\nreview imaginable. Echoing the final paragraph of the\ndecision below, the Government observes that the EEOC,\nin line with its standard practice, wrote two letters to\nMach Mining. See supra, at 2\u20133, 4. The first, after an-\nnouncing the Commission\u2019s finding of reasonable cause,\ninformed the company that \u201c[a] representative of this\noffice will be in contact with each party in the near future\nto begin the conciliation process.\u201d App. 16. The second,\nsent about a year later, stated that the legally mandated\nconciliation attempt had \u201coccurred\u201d and failed. Id., at 18.\nAccording to the Government, those \u201cbookend\u201d letters are\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nall a court ever needs for review, because they \u201cestablish\u201d\nthat the EEOC met its obligation to attempt conciliation.\nBrief for Respondent 21.\n  But review of that kind falls short of what Title VII\ndemands because the EEOC\u2019s bookend letters fail to prove\nwhat the Government claims. Contrary to its intimation,\nthose letters do not themselves fulfill the conciliation\ncondition: The first declares only that the process will\nstart soon, and the second only that it has concluded. The\ntwo letters, to be sure, may provide indirect evidence that\nconciliation efforts happened in the interim; the later one\nexpressly represents as much. But suppose an employer\ncontests that statement. Let us say the employer files an\naffidavit alleging that although the EEOC promised to\nmake contact, it in fact did not. In that circumstance, to\ntreat the letters as sufficient\u2014to take them at face value,\nas the Government wants\u2014is simply to accept the EEOC\u2019s\nsay-so that it complied with the law. And as earlier ex-\nplained, the point of judicial review is instead to verify the\nEEOC\u2019s say-so\u2014that is, to determine that the EEOC\nactually, and not just purportedly, tried to conciliate a\ndiscrimination charge. See supra, at 7\u20138. For that, a\ncourt needs more than the two bookend letters the Gov-\nernment proffers.\n  Mach Mining, for its part, would have a court do a deep\ndive into the conciliation process. Citing the standard set\nout in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), Mach\nMining wants a court to consider whether the EEOC has\n\u201cnegotiate[d] in good faith\u201d over a discrimination claim.\nBrief for Petitioner 37; see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7158(d) (imposing a\nduty on employers and unions to bargain \u201cin good faith\nwith respect to . . . terms and conditions of employment\u201d).\nThat good-faith obligation, Mach Mining maintains, here\nincorporates a number of specific requirements. In every\ncase, the EEOC must let the employer know the \u201cmini-\nmum . . . it would take to resolve\u201d the claim\u2014that is, the\n10               MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsmallest remedial award the EEOC would accept. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63. The Commission must also lay out \u201cthe\nfactual and legal basis for\u201d all its positions, including the\ncalculations underlying any monetary request. Brief for\nPetitioner 39. And the Commission must refrain from\nmaking \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d offers; rather, the EEOC has\nto go back and forth with the employer, considering and\naddressing its various counter-offers and giving it suffi-\ncient time at each turn \u201cto review and respond.\u201d Id., at 40.\nThe function of judicial review, Mach Mining concludes, is\nto compel the Commission to abide by these rules.\n  To begin, however, we reject any analogy between the\nNLRA and Title VII. The NLRA is about process and\nprocess alone. It creates a sphere of bargaining\u2014in which\nboth sides have a mutual obligation to deal fairly\u2014\nwithout expressing any preference as to the substantive\nagreements the parties should reach. See \u00a7\u00a7151, 158(d).\nBy contrast, Title VII ultimately cares about substantive\nresults, while eschewing any reciprocal duties of good-\nfaith negotiation. Its conciliation provision explicitly\nserves a substantive mission: to \u201celiminate\u201d unlawful\ndiscrimination from the workplace. 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u2013\n5(b). In discussing a claim with an employer, the EEOC\nmust always insist upon legal compliance; and the em-\nployer, for its part, has no duty at all to confer or exchange\nproposals, but only to refrain from any discrimination.\nThose differences make judicial review of the NLRA\u2019s duty\nof good-faith bargaining a poor model for review of Title\nVII\u2019s conciliation requirement. In addressing labor dis-\nputes, courts have devised a detailed body of rules to\npolice good-faith dealing divorced from outcomes\u2014and so\nto protect the NLRA\u2019s core procedural apparatus. But\nthose kinds of rules do not properly apply to a law that\ntreats the conciliation process not as an end in itself, but\nonly as a tool to redress workplace discrimination.\n  More concretely, Mach Mining\u2019s proposed code of con-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nduct conflicts with the latitude Title VII gives the Com-\nmission to pursue voluntary compliance with the law\u2019s\ncommands. Every aspect of Title VII\u2019s conciliation provi-\nsion smacks of flexibility. To begin with, the EEOC need\nonly \u201cendeavor\u201d to conciliate a claim, without having to\ndevote a set amount of time or resources to that project.\n\u00a72000e\u20135(b). Further, the attempt need not involve any\nspecific steps or measures; rather, the Commission may\nuse in each case whatever \u201cinformal\u201d means of \u201cconfer-\nence, conciliation, and persuasion\u201d it deems appropriate.\nIbid. And the EEOC alone decides whether in the end to\nmake an agreement or resort to litigation: The Commis-\nsion may sue whenever \u201cunable to secure\u201d terms \u201caccept-\nable to the Commission.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(f )(1) (emphasis added).\nAll that leeway respecting how to seek voluntary compli-\nance and when to quit the effort is at odds with Mach\nMining\u2019s bargaining checklist. Congress left to the EEOC\nsuch strategic decisions as whether to make a bare-\nminimum offer, to lay all its cards on the table, or to re-\nspond to each of an employer\u2019s counter-offers, however far\nafield. So too Congress granted the EEOC discretion over\nthe pace and duration of conciliation efforts, the plasticity\nor firmness of its negotiating positions, and the content of\nits demands for relief. For a court to assess any of those\nchoices\u2014as Mach Mining urges and many courts have\ndone, see n. 1, supra\u2014is not to enforce the law Congress\nwrote, but to impose extra procedural requirements. Such\njudicial review extends too far.\n   Mach Mining\u2019s brand of review would also flout Title\nVII\u2019s protection of the confidentiality of conciliation ef-\nforts. The statute, recall, provides that \u201c[n]othing said or\ndone during and as a part of such informal endeavors may\nbe made public by the Commission . . . or used as evidence\nin a subsequent proceeding without the written consent of\nthe persons concerned\u201d\u2014both the employer and the com-\nplainant. \u00a72000e\u20135(b); see EEOC v. Associated Dry Goods\n12                   MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCorp., 449 U. S. 590, 598, and n. 13 (1981). But the judi-\ncial inquiry Mach Mining proposes would necessitate the\ndisclosure and use of such information in a later Title VII\nsuit: How else could a court address an allegation that the\nEEOC failed to comply with all the negotiating rules Mach\nMining espouses?2 The proof is in this very case: The\nDistrict Court held that it could not strike from the record\ndescriptions of the conciliation process because they spoke\nto whether the EEOC had made a \u201csincere and reasonable\neffort to negotiate.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see supra, at 3. The court thus\nfailed to give effect to the law\u2019s non-disclosure provision.\nAnd in so doing, the court undermined the conciliation\nprocess itself, because confidentiality promotes candor in\ndiscussions and thereby enhances the prospects for\nagreement. As this Court has explained, \u201c[t]he maximum\nresults from the voluntary approach will be achieved if \u201d\nthe parties know that statements they make cannot come\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Mach Mining tries to show that broad judicial review is compatible\n\nwith Title VII\u2019s non-disclosure provision, but fails to do so. The com-\npany first contends that the statutory bar is limited to \u201cusing what was\nsaid or done in a conciliation as evidence going to the merits of the\nclaims.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 27 (emphasis added). But to make that\nargument, Mach Mining must add many words to the text (those shown\nhere in italics). The actual language refers to \u201cevidence in a subse-\nquent proceeding,\u201d without carving out evidence relating to non-merits\nissues. 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20135(b). And in any case, under Mach Mining\u2019s\nown view of Title VII, compliance with the conciliation mandate is a\nmerits issue, because it is a necessary \u201celement of the [EEOC\u2019s] claim,\nwhich the [EEOC] must plead and prove.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 9; see\nid., at 31. Mach Mining therefore presents a back-up argument: \u201c[T]he\nconfidentiality limitation should be deemed waived\u201d when the employer\nputs conciliation at issue. Id., at 30. But again, to effect a waiver Title\nVII requires \u201cthe written consent of the persons concerned,\u201d which\nincludes not just the employer but the complainant too. \u00a72000e\u20135(b);\nsee supra, at 11. And the employer\u2019s decision to contest the EEOC\u2019s\nconciliation efforts cannot waive, by \u201cdeem[ing]\u201d or otherwise, the\nemployee\u2019s statutory rights.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nback to haunt them in litigation. Associated Dry Goods\nCorp., 449 U. S., at 599, n. 16 (quoting 110 Cong. Rec.\n8193 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Dirksen)). And conversely,\nthe minimum results will be achieved if a party can hope\nto use accounts of those discussions to derail or delay a\nmeritorious claim.\n   By contrast with these flawed proposals, the proper\nscope of judicial review matches the terms of Title VII\u2019s\nconciliation provision, as we earlier described them. See\nsupra, at 7. The statute demands, once again, that the\nEEOC communicate in some way (through \u201cconference,\nconciliation, and persuasion\u201d) about an \u201calleged unlawful\nemployment practice\u201d in an \u201cendeavor\u201d to achieve an\nemployer\u2019s voluntary compliance. \u00a72000e\u20135(b). That\nmeans the EEOC must inform the employer about the\nspecific allegation, as the Commission typically does in a\nletter announcing its determination of \u201creasonable cause.\u201d\nIbid. Such notice properly describes both what the em-\nployer has done and which employees (or what class of\nemployees) have suffered as a result. And the EEOC must\ntry to engage the employer in some form of discussion\n(whether written or oral), so as to give the employer an\nopportunity to remedy the allegedly discriminatory prac-\ntice. Judicial review of those requirements (and nothing\nelse) ensures that the Commission complies with the\nstatute. At the same time, that relatively barebones\nreview allows the EEOC to exercise all the expansive\ndiscretion Title VII gives it to decide how to conduct concil-\niation efforts and when to end them. And such review can\noccur consistent with the statute\u2019s non-disclosure provi-\nsion, because a court looks only to whether the EEOC\nattempted to confer about a charge, and not to what hap-\npened (i.e., statements made or positions taken) during\nthose discussions.\n   A sworn affidavit from the EEOC stating that it has\nperformed the obligations noted above but that its efforts\n14               MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhave failed will usually suffice to show that it has met the\nconciliation requirement. Cf. United States v. Clarke, 573\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6) (\u201c[A]bsent contrary\nevidence, the [agency] can satisfy [the relevant] standard\nby submitting a simple affidavit from\u201d the agency repre-\nsentative involved). If, however, the employer provides\ncredible evidence of its own, in the form of an affidavit or\notherwise, indicating that the EEOC did not provide the\nrequisite information about the charge or attempt to\nengage in a discussion about conciliating the claim, a court\nmust conduct the factfinding necessary to decide that\nlimited dispute. Cf. id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 6\u20137).\nShould the court find in favor of the employer, the appro-\npriate remedy is to order the EEOC to undertake the\nmandated efforts to obtain voluntary compliance. See\n\u00a72000e\u20135(f )(1) (authorizing a stay of a Title VII action for\nthat purpose).\n                              IV\n  Judicial review of administrative action is the norm in\nour legal system, and nothing in Title VII withdraws the\ncourts\u2019 authority to determine whether the EEOC has\nfulfilled its duty to attempt conciliation of claims. But the\nscope of that review is narrow, reflecting the abundant\ndiscretion the law gives the EEOC to decide the kind and\nextent of discussions appropriate in a given case. In ad-\ndressing a claim like Mach Mining\u2019s, courts may not im-\npinge on that latitude and on the Commission\u2019s concomi-\ntant responsibility to eliminate unlawful workplace\ndiscrimination.\n  For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed-\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n",

However,\n  \u201c[n]othing said or done during\u201d conciliation may be \u201cused as evidence\n  in a subsequent proceeding without written consent of the persons\n  concerned.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(b).\n     After investigating a sex discrimination charge against petitioner\n  Mach Mining, LLC, respondent EEOC determined that reasonable\n  cause existed to believe that the company had engaged in unlawful\n  hiring practices. The Commission sent a letter inviting Mach Mining\n  and the complainant to participate in informal conciliation proceed-\n  ings and notifying them that a representative would be contacting\n  them to begin the process. About a year later, the Commission sent\n  Mach Mining another letter stating that it had determined that con-\n  ciliation efforts had been unsuccessful. The Commission then sued\n  Mach Mining in federal court. In its answer, Mach Mining alleged\n  that the Commission had not attempted to conciliate in good faith.\n  The Commission countered that its conciliation efforts were not sub-\n  ject to judicial review and that, regardless, the two letters it sent to\n  Mach Mining provided adequate proof that it had fulfilled its statuto-\n  ry duty. The District Court agreed that it could review the adequacy\n  of the Commission\u2019s efforts, but granted the Commission leave to\n  immediately appeal. The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the\n2                    MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    Commission\u2019s statutory conciliation obligation was unreviewable.\nHeld:\n    1. Courts have authority to review whether the EEOC has fulfilled\n its Title VII duty to attempt conciliation. This Court has recognized\n a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that Congress means to allow judicial review\n of administrative action. Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family\n Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 670. That presumption is rebuttable when\n a statute\u2019s language or structure demonstrates that Congress intend-\n ed an agency to police itself. Block v. Community Nutrition Institute,\n 467 U. S. 340, 349, 351. But nothing rebuts that presumption here.\n    By its choice of language, Congress imposed a mandatory duty on\n the EEOC to attempt conciliation and made that duty a precondition\n to filing a lawsuit. Such compulsory prerequisites are routinely en-\n forced by courts in Title VII litigation. And though Congress gave the\n EEOC wide latitude to choose which \u201cinformal methods\u201d to use, it did\n not deprive courts of judicially manageable criteria by which to re-\n view the conciliation process. By its terms, the statutory obligation\n to attempt conciliation necessarily entails communication between\n the parties concerning the alleged unlawful employment practice.\n The statute therefore requires the EEOC to notify the employer of\n the claim and give the employer an opportunity to discuss the matter.\n In enforcing that statutory condition, a court applies a manageable\n standard. Pp. 4\u20138.\n    2. The appropriate scope of judicial review of the EEOC\u2019s concilia-\n tion activities is narrow, enforcing only the EEOC\u2019s statutory obliga-\n tion to give the employer notice and an opportunity to achieve volun-\n tary compliance.        This limited review respects the expansive\n discretion that Title VII gives the EEOC while still ensuring that it\n follows the law.\n    The Government\u2019s suggestion that review be limited to checking\n the facial validity of its two letters to Mach Mining falls short of Title\n VII\u2019s demands. That standard would merely accept the EEOC\u2019s word\n that it followed the law, whereas the aim of judicial review is to veri-\n fy that the EEOC actually tried to conciliate a discrimination charge.\n Citing the standard set out in the National Labor Relations Act,\n Mach Mining proposes review for whether the EEOC engaged in\n good-faith negotiation, laying out a number of specific requirements\n to implement that standard. But the NLRA\u2019s process-based approach\n provides a poor analogy for Title VII, which ultimately cares about\n substantive outcomes and eschews any reciprocal duty to negotiate in\n good faith. Mach Mining\u2019s proposed code of conduct also conflicts\n with the wide latitude Congress gave the Commission to decide how\n to conduct and when to end conciliation efforts. And because infor-\n mation obtained during conciliation would be necessary evidence in a\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

In order to comply with that provision, the\n  EEOC must inform the employer about the specific discrimination al-\n  legation. Such notice must describe what the employer has done and\n  which employees (or class of employees) have suffered. And the\n  EEOC must try to engage the employer in a discussion in order to\n  give the employer a chance to remedy the allegedly discriminatory\n  practice. A sworn affidavit from the EEOC stating that it has per-\n  formed these obligations should suffice to show that it has met the\n  conciliation requirement. Should the employer present concrete evi-\n  dence that the EEOC did not provide the requisite information about\n  the charge or attempt to engage in a discussion about conciliating the\n  claim, a court must conduct the factfinding necessary to resolve that\n  limited dispute. Should it find for the employer, the appropriate\n  remedy is to order the EEOC to undertake the mandated conciliation\n  efforts.

But we find that the scope\nof that review is narrow, thus recognizing the EEOC\u2019s\nextensive discretion to determine the kind and amount of\ncommunication with an employer appropriate in any given\ncase.\n                              I\n  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 241,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e et seq., sets out a detailed, multi-step\nprocedure through which the Commission enforces the\nstatute\u2019s prohibition on employment discrimination. The\nprocess generally starts when \u201ca person claiming to be\naggrieved\u201d files a charge of an unlawful workplace practice\nwith the EEOC. \u00a72000e\u20135(b). At that point, the EEOC\n2               MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnotifies the employer of the complaint and undertakes an\ninvestigation. See ibid. If the Commission finds no \u201crea-\nsonable cause\u201d to think that the allegation has merit, it\ndismisses the charge and notifies the parties. Ibid. The\ncomplainant may then pursue her own lawsuit if she\nchooses. See \u00a72000e\u20135(f )(1).\n  If, on the other hand, the Commission finds reasonable\ncause, it must first \u201cendeavor to eliminate [the] alleged\nunlawful employment practice by informal methods of\nconference, conciliation, and persuasion.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(b). To\nensure candor in those discussions, the statute limits the\ndisclosure and use of the participants\u2019 statements: \u201cNoth-\ning said or done during and as a part of such informal\nendeavors\u201d may be publicized by the Commission or \u201cused\nas evidence in a subsequent proceeding without the writ-\nten consent of the persons concerned.\u201d Ibid. The statute\nleaves to the EEOC the ultimate decision whether to\naccept a settlement or instead to bring a lawsuit. So long\nas \u201cthe Commission has been unable to secure from the\nrespondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to the\nCommission\u201d itself, the EEOC may sue the employer.\n\u00a72000e\u20135(f )(1).\n  This case began when a woman filed a charge with the\nEEOC claiming that petitioner Mach Mining, LLC, had\nrefused to hire her as a coal miner because of her sex. The\nCommission investigated the allegation and found reason-\nable cause to believe that Mach Mining had discriminated\nagainst the complainant, along with a class of women who\nhad similarly applied for mining jobs. See App. 15. In a\nletter announcing that determination, the EEOC invited\nboth the company and the complainant to participate in\n\u201cinformal methods\u201d of dispute resolution, promising that a\nCommission representative would soon \u201ccontact [them] to\nbegin the conciliation process.\u201d Id., at 16. The record does\nnot disclose what happened next. But about a year later,\nthe Commission sent Mach Mining a second letter, stating\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat \u201csuch conciliation efforts as are required by law have\noccurred and have been unsuccessful\u201d and that any fur-\nther efforts would be \u201cfutile.\u201d Id., at 18\u201319.\n   The EEOC then sued Mach Mining in federal district\ncourt alleging sex discrimination in hiring. The Commis-\nsion\u2019s complaint maintained that \u201c[a]ll conditions prece-\ndent to the institution of this lawsuit\u201d\u2014including an\nattempt to end the challenged practice through concilia-\ntion\u2014\u201cha[d] been fulfilled.\u201d Id., at 22. In its answer,\nMach Mining contested that statement, asserting that the\nEEOC had failed to \u201cconciliat[e] in good faith\u201d prior to\nfiling suit. Id., at 30.\n   The Commission subsequently moved for summary\njudgment on that issue, contending that its \u201cconciliation\nefforts are not subject to judicial review.\u201d Motion for\nSummary Judgment in No. 3:11\u2013cv\u201300879 (SD Ill.), p. 1.\nAt most, the Commission argued, the court could inspect\nthe EEOC\u2019s two letters to Mach Mining to confirm that the\nEEOC had met its duty to attempt conciliation. See id., at\n11, 19. Mach Mining responded by urging the court to\nconsider the overall \u201creasonable[ness]\u201d of the EEOC\u2019s\nefforts, based on evidence the company would present\nabout the conciliation process. Memorandum in Opposi-\ntion to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in No. 3:11\u2013\ncv\u201300879 (SD Ill.), p. 20.

EEOC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n(2013). According to the court, that provision entrusts\nconciliation \u201csolely to the EEOC\u2019s expert judgment\u201d and\nthus provides no \u201cworkable standard\u201d of review for courts\nto apply. Id., at 174, 177. The Seventh Circuit further\nreasoned that judicial review of the conciliation process\nwould \u201cundermine enforcement of Title VII\u201d by \u201cpro-\ntract[ing] and complicat[ing]\u201d discrimination suits. Id., at\n178\u2013179 (quoting Doe v. Oberweis Diary, 456 F. 3d 704,\n710 (CA7 2006)). In its concluding paragraph, however,\nthe court indicated that it had in fact subjected the\nEEOC\u2019s activities to a smidgen of review: Because the\nCommission \u201cpled on the face of its complaint that it ha[d]\ncomplied with all\u201d prerequisites to suit and because its two\nletters to Mach Mining were \u201cfacially sufficient\u201d to show\nthat conciliation had occurred, the court stated, \u201cour re-\nview of [that process] is satisfied.\u201d 738 F. 3d, at 184.\n  Other Courts of Appeals have held that Title VII allows\njudicial review of the EEOC\u2019s conciliation efforts, but\nwithout agreeing on what that review entails.1 We granted\ncertiorari, 573 U. S. ___ (2014), to address whether and\nto what extent such an attempt to conciliate is subject to\njudicial consideration.\n                             II\n   Congress rarely intends to prevent courts from enforcing\nits directives to federal agencies. For that reason, this\nCourt applies a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d favoring judicial\nreview of administrative action. Bowen v. Michigan Acad-\nemy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 670 (1986). That\npresumption is rebuttable: It fails when a statute\u2019s lan-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See, e.g., EEOC v. Asplundh Tree Expert Co., 340 F. 3d 1256, 1259\n\n(CA11 2003) (holding that the EEOC must, among other things, \u201cre-\nspond in a reasonable and flexible manner to the reasonable attitudes\nof the employer\u201d); EEOC v. Keco Industries, Inc., 748 F. 2d 1097, 1102\n(CA6 1984) (holding that the EEOC must \u201cmake a good faith effort to\nconciliate\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nguage or structure demonstrates that Congress wanted an\nagency to police its own conduct. See Block v. Community\nNutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 349, 351 (1984). But the\nagency bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d in attempting to show that\nCongress \u201cprohibit[ed] all judicial review\u201d of the agency\u2019s\ncompliance with a legislative mandate.            Dunlop v.\nBachowski, 421 U. S. 560, 567 (1975).\n   Title VII, as the Government acknowledges, imposes a\nduty on the EEOC to attempt conciliation of a discrimina-\ntion charge prior to filing a lawsuit. See Brief for Re-\nspondent 20. That obligation is a key component of the\nstatutory scheme. In pursuing the goal of \u201cbring[ing]\nemployment discrimination to an end,\u201d Congress chose\n\u201c[c]ooperation and voluntary compliance\u201d as its \u201cpreferred\nmeans.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U. S. 219, 228\n(1982) (quoting Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415\nU. S. 36, 44 (1974)). Accordingly, the statute provides, as\nearlier noted, that the Commission \u201cshall endeavor to\neliminate [an] alleged unlawful employment practice by\ninformal methods of conference, conciliation, and persua-\nsion.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(b); see supra, at 2. That language is\nmandatory, not precatory. Cf. National Railroad Passen-\nger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 109 (2002)\n(noting that the word \u201cshall\u201d admits of no discretion). And\nthe duty it imposes serves as a necessary precondition to\nfiling a lawsuit. Only if the Commission is \u201cunable to\nsecure\u201d an acceptable conciliation agreement\u2014that is, only\nif its attempt to conciliate has failed\u2014may a claim against\nthe employer go forward. \u00a72000e\u20135(f )(1).\n   Courts routinely enforce such compulsory prerequisites\nto suit in Title VII litigation (and in many other contexts\nbesides). An employee, for example, may bring a Title VII\nclaim only if she has first filed a timely charge with the\nEEOC\u2014and a court will usually dismiss a complaint for\nfailure to do so. See, e.g., id., at 104\u2013105, 114\u2013115. Simi-\nlarly, an employee must obtain a right-to-sue letter before\n6                MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbringing suit\u2014and a court will typically insist on satisfac-\ntion of that condition. See, e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nv. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 798 (1973); see also, e.g., Hall-\nstrom v. Tillamook County, 493 U. S. 20, 26 (1989) (up-\nholding dismissal of an environmental suit for failure to\ncomply with a notice provision serving as a \u201ccondition\nprecedent\u201d); United States v. Zucca, 351 U. S. 91 (1956)\n(affirming dismissal of a denaturalization suit because of\nthe Government\u2019s failure to comply with a mandatory\nprerequisite). That ordinary part of Title VII litigation\u2014\nsee a prerequisite to suit, enforce a prerequisite to suit\u2014\nsupports judicial review of the EEOC\u2019s compliance with\nthe law\u2019s conciliation provision.\n   The Government, reiterating the Seventh Circuit\u2019s view,\ncontests that conclusion, arguing that Title VII provides\n\u201cno standards by which to judge\u201d the EEOC\u2019s performance\nof its statutory duty. Brief for Respondent 17. The Gov-\nernment highlights the broad leeway the statute gives the\nEEOC to decide how to engage in, and when to give up on,\nconciliation. In granting that discretion, the Government\ncontends, Congress deprived courts of any \u201cjudicially\nmanageable\u201d criteria with which to review the EEOC\u2019s\nefforts. Id., at 36 (quoting Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S.\n821, 830 (1985)). And in that way Congress \u201cdemon-\nstrate[d] [its] intention to preclude judicial review.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 39.\n   But in thus denying that Title VII creates a \u201creviewable\nprerequisite to suit,\u201d the Government takes its observation\nabout discretion too far. Id., at 37 (quoting 738 F. 3d, at\n175). Yes, the statute provides the EEOC with wide lati-\ntude over the conciliation process, and that feature be-\ncomes significant when we turn to defining the proper\nscope of judicial review. See infra, at 10\u201311. But no,\nCongress has not left everything to the Commission.\nConsider if the EEOC declined to make any attempt to\nconciliate a claim\u2014if, after finding reasonable cause to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupport a charge, the EEOC took the employer straight to\ncourt. In such a case, Title VII would offer a perfectly\nserviceable standard for judicial review: Without any\n\u201cendeavor\u201d at all, the EEOC would have failed to satisfy a\nnecessary condition of litigation.\n   Still more, the statute provides certain concrete stand-\nards pertaining to what that endeavor must entail. Again,\nthink of how the statute describes the obligatory attempt:\n\u201cto eliminate [the] alleged unlawful employment practice\nby informal methods of conference, conciliation, and per-\nsuasion.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(b). Those specified methods neces-\nsarily involve communication between parties, including\nthe exchange of information and views. As one dictionary\nvariously defines the terms, they involve \u201cconsultation or\ndiscussion,\u201d an attempt to \u201creconcile\u201d different positions,\nand a \u201cmeans of argument, reasoning, or entreaty.\u201d Amer-\nican Heritage Dictionary 385, 382, 1318 (5th ed. 2011).\nThat communication, moreover, concerns a particular\nthing: the \u201calleged unlawful employment practice.\u201d So the\nEEOC, to meet the statutory condition, must tell the\nemployer about the claim\u2014essentially, what practice has\nharmed which person or class\u2014and must provide the\nemployer with an opportunity to discuss the matter in an\neffort to achieve voluntary compliance. See also infra, at\n13. If the Commission does not take those specified ac-\ntions, it has not satisfied Title VII\u2019s requirement to at-\ntempt conciliation. And in insisting that the Commission\ndo so, as the statutory language directs, a court applies a\nmanageable standard.\n   Absent such review, the Commission\u2019s compliance with\nthe law would rest in the Commission\u2019s hands alone. We\nneed not doubt the EEOC\u2019s trustworthiness, or its fidelity\nto law, to shy away from that result. We need only\nknow\u2014and know that Congress knows\u2014that legal lapses\nand violations occur, and especially so when they have no\nconsequence. That is why this Court has so long applied a\n8               MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstrong presumption favoring judicial review of administra-\ntive action. See supra, at 4\u20135. Nothing overcomes that\npresumption with respect to the EEOC\u2019s duty to attempt\nconciliation of employment discrimination claims.\n                              III\n  That conclusion raises a second dispute between the\nparties: What is the proper scope of judicial review of the\nEEOC\u2019s conciliation activities? The Government (once\nhaving accepted the necessity for some review) proposes\nthat courts rely solely on facial examination of certain\nEEOC documents. Mach Mining argues for far more\nintrusive review, in part analogizing to the way judges\nsuperintend bargaining between employers and unions.\nWe accept neither suggestion, because we think neither\nconsistent with the choices Congress made in enacting\nTitle VII. The appropriate scope of review enforces the\nstatute\u2019s requirements as just described\u2014in brief, that the\nEEOC afford the employer a chance to discuss and rectify\na specified discriminatory practice\u2014but goes no further.\nSee supra, at 7; infra, at 13. Such limited review respects\nthe expansive discretion that Title VII gives to the EEOC\nover the conciliation process, while still ensuring that the\nCommission follows the law.\n  The Government argues for the most minimalist form of\nreview imaginable. Echoing the final paragraph of the\ndecision below, the Government observes that the EEOC,\nin line with its standard practice, wrote two letters to\nMach Mining. See supra, at 2\u20133, 4. The first, after an-\nnouncing the Commission\u2019s finding of reasonable cause,\ninformed the company that \u201c[a] representative of this\noffice will be in contact with each party in the near future\nto begin the conciliation process.\u201d App. 16. The second,\nsent about a year later, stated that the legally mandated\nconciliation attempt had \u201coccurred\u201d and failed. Id., at 18.\nAccording to the Government, those \u201cbookend\u201d letters are\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nall a court ever needs for review, because they \u201cestablish\u201d\nthat the EEOC met its obligation to attempt conciliation.\nBrief for Respondent 21.\n  But review of that kind falls short of what Title VII\ndemands because the EEOC\u2019s bookend letters fail to prove\nwhat the Government claims. Contrary to its intimation,\nthose letters do not themselves fulfill the conciliation\ncondition: The first declares only that the process will\nstart soon, and the second only that it has concluded. The\ntwo letters, to be sure, may provide indirect evidence that\nconciliation efforts happened in the interim; the later one\nexpressly represents as much. But suppose an employer\ncontests that statement. Let us say the employer files an\naffidavit alleging that although the EEOC promised to\nmake contact, it in fact did not. In that circumstance, to\ntreat the letters as sufficient\u2014to take them at face value,\nas the Government wants\u2014is simply to accept the EEOC\u2019s\nsay-so that it complied with the law. And as earlier ex-\nplained, the point of judicial review is instead to verify the\nEEOC\u2019s say-so\u2014that is, to determine that the EEOC\nactually, and not just purportedly, tried to conciliate a\ndiscrimination charge. See supra, at 7\u20138. For that, a\ncourt needs more than the two bookend letters the Gov-\nernment proffers.\n  Mach Mining, for its part, would have a court do a deep\ndive into the conciliation process. Citing the standard set\nout in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), Mach\nMining wants a court to consider whether the EEOC has\n\u201cnegotiate[d] in good faith\u201d over a discrimination claim.\nBrief for Petitioner 37; see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7158(d) (imposing a\nduty on employers and unions to bargain \u201cin good faith\nwith respect to . . . terms and conditions of employment\u201d).\nThat good-faith obligation, Mach Mining maintains, here\nincorporates a number of specific requirements. In every\ncase, the EEOC must let the employer know the \u201cmini-\nmum . . . it would take to resolve\u201d the claim\u2014that is, the\n10               MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsmallest remedial award the EEOC would accept. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63. The Commission must also lay out \u201cthe\nfactual and legal basis for\u201d all its positions, including the\ncalculations underlying any monetary request. Brief for\nPetitioner 39. And the Commission must refrain from\nmaking \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d offers; rather, the EEOC has\nto go back and forth with the employer, considering and\naddressing its various counter-offers and giving it suffi-\ncient time at each turn \u201cto review and respond.\u201d Id., at 40.\nThe function of judicial review, Mach Mining concludes, is\nto compel the Commission to abide by these rules.\n  To begin, however, we reject any analogy between the\nNLRA and Title VII. The NLRA is about process and\nprocess alone. It creates a sphere of bargaining\u2014in which\nboth sides have a mutual obligation to deal fairly\u2014\nwithout expressing any preference as to the substantive\nagreements the parties should reach. See \u00a7\u00a7151, 158(d).\nBy contrast, Title VII ultimately cares about substantive\nresults, while eschewing any reciprocal duties of good-\nfaith negotiation. Its conciliation provision explicitly\nserves a substantive mission: to \u201celiminate\u201d unlawful\ndiscrimination from the workplace. 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u2013\n5(b). In discussing a claim with an employer, the EEOC\nmust always insist upon legal compliance; and the em-\nployer, for its part, has no duty at all to confer or exchange\nproposals, but only to refrain from any discrimination.\nThose differences make judicial review of the NLRA\u2019s duty\nof good-faith bargaining a poor model for review of Title\nVII\u2019s conciliation requirement. In addressing labor dis-\nputes, courts have devised a detailed body of rules to\npolice good-faith dealing divorced from outcomes\u2014and so\nto protect the NLRA\u2019s core procedural apparatus. But\nthose kinds of rules do not properly apply to a law that\ntreats the conciliation process not as an end in itself, but\nonly as a tool to redress workplace discrimination.\n  More concretely, Mach Mining\u2019s proposed code of con-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nduct conflicts with the latitude Title VII gives the Com-\nmission to pursue voluntary compliance with the law\u2019s\ncommands. Every aspect of Title VII\u2019s conciliation provi-\nsion smacks of flexibility. To begin with, the EEOC need\nonly \u201cendeavor\u201d to conciliate a claim, without having to\ndevote a set amount of time or resources to that project.\n\u00a72000e\u20135(b). Further, the attempt need not involve any\nspecific steps or measures; rather, the Commission may\nuse in each case whatever \u201cinformal\u201d means of \u201cconfer-\nence, conciliation, and persuasion\u201d it deems appropriate.\nIbid. And the EEOC alone decides whether in the end to\nmake an agreement or resort to litigation: The Commis-\nsion may sue whenever \u201cunable to secure\u201d terms \u201caccept-\nable to the Commission.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(f )(1) (emphasis added).\nAll that leeway respecting how to seek voluntary compli-\nance and when to quit the effort is at odds with Mach\nMining\u2019s bargaining checklist. Congress left to the EEOC\nsuch strategic decisions as whether to make a bare-\nminimum offer, to lay all its cards on the table, or to re-\nspond to each of an employer\u2019s counter-offers, however far\nafield. So too Congress granted the EEOC discretion over\nthe pace and duration of conciliation efforts, the plasticity\nor firmness of its negotiating positions, and the content of\nits demands for relief. For a court to assess any of those\nchoices\u2014as Mach Mining urges and many courts have\ndone, see n. 1, supra\u2014is not to enforce the law Congress\nwrote, but to impose extra procedural requirements. Such\njudicial review extends too far.\n   Mach Mining\u2019s brand of review would also flout Title\nVII\u2019s protection of the confidentiality of conciliation ef-\nforts. The statute, recall, provides that \u201c[n]othing said or\ndone during and as a part of such informal endeavors may\nbe made public by the Commission . . . or used as evidence\nin a subsequent proceeding without the written consent of\nthe persons concerned\u201d\u2014both the employer and the com-\nplainant. \u00a72000e\u20135(b); see EEOC v. Associated Dry Goods\n12                   MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCorp., 449 U. S. 590, 598, and n. 13 (1981). But the judi-\ncial inquiry Mach Mining proposes would necessitate the\ndisclosure and use of such information in a later Title VII\nsuit: How else could a court address an allegation that the\nEEOC failed to comply with all the negotiating rules Mach\nMining espouses?2 The proof is in this very case: The\nDistrict Court held that it could not strike from the record\ndescriptions of the conciliation process because they spoke\nto whether the EEOC had made a \u201csincere and reasonable\neffort to negotiate.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see supra, at 3. The court thus\nfailed to give effect to the law\u2019s non-disclosure provision.\nAnd in so doing, the court undermined the conciliation\nprocess itself, because confidentiality promotes candor in\ndiscussions and thereby enhances the prospects for\nagreement. As this Court has explained, \u201c[t]he maximum\nresults from the voluntary approach will be achieved if \u201d\nthe parties know that statements they make cannot come\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Mach Mining tries to show that broad judicial review is compatible\n\nwith Title VII\u2019s non-disclosure provision, but fails to do so. The com-\npany first contends that the statutory bar is limited to \u201cusing what was\nsaid or done in a conciliation as evidence going to the merits of the\nclaims.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 27 (emphasis added). But to make that\nargument, Mach Mining must add many words to the text (those shown\nhere in italics). The actual language refers to \u201cevidence in a subse-\nquent proceeding,\u201d without carving out evidence relating to non-merits\nissues. 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20135(b). And in any case, under Mach Mining\u2019s\nown view of Title VII, compliance with the conciliation mandate is a\nmerits issue, because it is a necessary \u201celement of the [EEOC\u2019s] claim,\nwhich the [EEOC] must plead and prove.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 9; see\nid., at 31. Mach Mining therefore presents a back-up argument: \u201c[T]he\nconfidentiality limitation should be deemed waived\u201d when the employer\nputs conciliation at issue. Id., at 30. But again, to effect a waiver Title\nVII requires \u201cthe written consent of the persons concerned,\u201d which\nincludes not just the employer but the complainant too. \u00a72000e\u20135(b);\nsee supra, at 11. And the employer\u2019s decision to contest the EEOC\u2019s\nconciliation efforts cannot waive, by \u201cdeem[ing]\u201d or otherwise, the\nemployee\u2019s statutory rights.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nback to haunt them in litigation. Associated Dry Goods\nCorp., 449 U. S., at 599, n. 16 (quoting 110 Cong. Rec.\n8193 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Dirksen)). And conversely,\nthe minimum results will be achieved if a party can hope\nto use accounts of those discussions to derail or delay a\nmeritorious claim.\n   By contrast with these flawed proposals, the proper\nscope of judicial review matches the terms of Title VII\u2019s\nconciliation provision, as we earlier described them. See\nsupra, at 7. The statute demands, once again, that the\nEEOC communicate in some way (through \u201cconference,\nconciliation, and persuasion\u201d) about an \u201calleged unlawful\nemployment practice\u201d in an \u201cendeavor\u201d to achieve an\nemployer\u2019s voluntary compliance. \u00a72000e\u20135(b). That\nmeans the EEOC must inform the employer about the\nspecific allegation, as the Commission typically does in a\nletter announcing its determination of \u201creasonable cause.\u201d\nIbid. Such notice properly describes both what the em-\nployer has done and which employees (or what class of\nemployees) have suffered as a result. And the EEOC must\ntry to engage the employer in some form of discussion\n(whether written or oral), so as to give the employer an\nopportunity to remedy the allegedly discriminatory prac-\ntice. Judicial review of those requirements (and nothing\nelse) ensures that the Commission complies with the\nstatute. At the same time, that relatively barebones\nreview allows the EEOC to exercise all the expansive\ndiscretion Title VII gives it to decide how to conduct concil-\niation efforts and when to end them. And such review can\noccur consistent with the statute\u2019s non-disclosure provi-\nsion, because a court looks only to whether the EEOC\nattempted to confer about a charge, and not to what hap-\npened (i.e., statements made or positions taken) during\nthose discussions.\n   A sworn affidavit from the EEOC stating that it has\nperformed the obligations noted above but that its efforts\n14               MACH MINING, LLC v. EEOC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhave failed will usually suffice to show that it has met the\nconciliation requirement. Cf. United States v. Clarke, 573\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6) (\u201c[A]bsent contrary\nevidence, the [agency] can satisfy [the relevant] standard\nby submitting a simple affidavit from\u201d the agency repre-\nsentative involved). If, however, the employer provides\ncredible evidence of its own, in the form of an affidavit or\notherwise, indicating that the EEOC did not provide the\nrequisite information about the charge or attempt to\nengage in a discussion about conciliating the claim, a court\nmust conduct the factfinding necessary to decide that\nlimited dispute. Cf. id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 6\u20137).\nShould the court find in favor of the employer, the appro-\npriate remedy is to order the EEOC to undertake the\nmandated efforts to obtain voluntary compliance. See\n\u00a72000e\u20135(f )(1) (authorizing a stay of a Title VII action for\nthat purpose).\n                              IV\n  Judicial review of administrative action is the norm in\nour legal system, and nothing in Title VII withdraws the\ncourts\u2019 authority to determine whether the EEOC has\nfulfilled its duty to attempt conciliation of claims. But the\nscope of that review is narrow, reflecting the abundant\ndiscretion the law gives the EEOC to decide the kind and\nextent of discussions appropriate in a given case. In ad-\ndressing a claim like Mach Mining\u2019s, courts may not im-\npinge on that latitude and on the Commission\u2019s concomi-\ntant responsibility to eliminate unlawful workplace\ndiscrimination.\n  For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed-\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
