BLUE HILLS BANK, FKA HYDE PARK\n\n                 SAVINGS BANK \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n        No. 14\u2013116.      Argued April 1, 2015\u2014Decided May 4, 2015\nAfter filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, petitioner Bullard submitted a\n  proposed repayment plan to the Bankruptcy Court. Respondent Blue\n  Hills Bank, Bullard\u2019s mortgage lender, objected to the plan\u2019s treat-\n  ment of its claim. The Bankruptcy Court sustained the Bank\u2019s objec-\n  tion and declined to confirm the plan. Bullard appealed to the First\n  Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP). The BAP concluded that\n  the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s denial of confirmation was not a final, ap-\n  pealable order, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7158(a)(1), but heard the appeal under\n  a provision permitting interlocutory appeals \u201cwith leave of the court,\u201d\n  \u00a7158(a)(3), and agreed with the Bankruptcy Court that Bullard\u2019s pro-\n  posed plan was not allowed. Bullard appealed to the First Circuit,\n  but it dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. It concluded that its jurisdic-\n  tion depended on the finality of the BAP\u2019s order, which in turn de-\n  pended on the finality of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order. And it found\n  that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order denying confirmation was not final\n  so long as Bullard remained free to propose another plan.\nHeld: A bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying confirmation of a debtor\u2019s\n proposed repayment plan is not a final order that the debtor can im-\n mediately appeal. Pp. 4\u201312.\n    (a) Congress has long treated orders in bankruptcy cases as imme-\n diately appealable \u201cif they finally dispose of discrete disputes within\n the larger case,\u201d Howard Delivery Service, Inc. v. Zurich American\n Ins. Co., 547 U. S. 651, 657, n. 3. This approach is reflected in the\n current statute, which provides that bankruptcy appeals as of right\n may be taken not only from final judgments in cases but from \u201cfinal\n judgments, orders, and decrees . . . in cases and proceedings.\u201d 28\n U. S. C. \u00a7158(a). Bullard argues that a bankruptcy court conducts a\n2                   BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    separate proceeding each time it reviews a proposed plan, and there-\n    fore a court\u2019s order either confirming or denying a plan terminates\n    the proceeding and is final and immediately appealable. But the rel-\n    evant proceeding is the entire process of attempting to arrive at an\n    approved plan that would allow the bankruptcy case to move for-\n    ward. Only plan confirmation, or case dismissal, alters the status\n    quo and fixes the parties\u2019 rights and obligations; denial of confirma-\n    tion with leave to amend changes little and can hardly be described\n    as final. Additional considerations\u2014that the statute defining core\n    bankruptcy proceedings lists \u201cconfirmations of plans,\u201d \u00a7157(b)(2)(L),\n    but omits any reference to denials; that immediate appeals from de-\n    nials would result in delays and inefficiencies that requirements of\n    finality are designed to constrain; and that a debtor\u2019s inability to im-\n    mediately appeal a denial encourages the debtor to work with credi-\n    tors and the trustee to develop a confirmable plan\u2014bolster the con-\n    clusion that the relevant proceeding is the entire process culminating\n    in confirmation or dismissal. Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (b) The Solicitor General suggests that because bankruptcy dis-\n    putes are generally classified as either \u201cadversary proceedings\u201d or\n    \u201ccontested matters,\u201d and because an order denying confirmation and\n    an order granting confirmation both resolve a contested matter, both\n    should be considered final. This argument simply assumes that con-\n    firmation is appealable because it resolves a contested matter, and\n    that therefore anything else that resolves the contested matter must\n    also be appealable. But one could just as easily contend that confir-\n    mation is appealable because it resolves the entire plan consideration\n    process, while denial is not because it does not. Any asymmetry in\n    denying the debtor an immediate appeal from a denial while allowing\n    a creditor an immediate appeal from a confirmation simply reflects\n    the fact that confirmation allows the bankruptcy to go forward and\n    alters the legal relationships among the parties, while denial lacks\n    such significant consequences. Nor is it clear that the asymmetry\n    will always advantage creditors. Finally, Bullard contends that un-\n    less denial orders are final, a debtor will be required to choose be-\n    tween two untenable options: either accept dismissal of the case and\n    then appeal, or propose an amended but unwanted plan and appeal\n    its confirmation. These options will often be unsatisfying, but our lit-\n    igation system has long accepted that certain burdensome rulings\n    will be \u201conly imperfectly reparable\u201d by the appellate process.

That\n    prospect is made tolerable by the Court\u2019s confidence that bankruptcy\n    courts rule correctly most of the time and by the existence of several\n    mechanisms for interlocutory review, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7158(a)(3), (d)(2), which\n    \u201cserve as useful safety valves for promptly correcting serious errors\u201d\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

BULLARD, PETITIONER v. BLUE HILLS \n\n     BANK, FKA HYDE PARK SAVINGS BANK\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                  [May 4, 2015]\n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code affords individuals\nreceiving regular income an opportunity to obtain some\nrelief from their debts while retaining their property. To\nproceed under Chapter 13, a debtor must propose a plan to\nuse future income to repay a portion (or in the rare case\nall) of his debts over the next three to five years. If the\nbankruptcy court confirms the plan and the debtor suc\u00ad\ncessfully carries it out, he receives a discharge of his debts\naccording to the plan.\n  The bankruptcy court may, however, decline to confirm\na proposed repayment plan because it is inconsistent with\nthe Code. Although the debtor is usually given an oppor\u00ad\ntunity to submit a revised plan, he may be convinced that\nthe original plan complied with the Code and that the\nbankruptcy court was wrong to deny confirmation. The\nquestion presented is whether such an order denying\nconfirmation is a \u201cfinal\u201d order that the debtor can immedi\u00ad\nately appeal. We hold that it is not.\n2              BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n  In December 2010, Louis Bullard filed a petition for\nChapter 13 bankruptcy in Federal Bankruptcy Court in\nMassachusetts. A week later he filed a proposed repay\u00ad\nment plan listing the various claims he anticipated credi\u00ad\ntors would file and the monthly amounts he planned to\npay on each claim over the five-year life of his plan. See\n11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71321, 1322. Chief among Bullard\u2019s debts\nwas the roughly $346,000 he owed to Blue Hills Bank,\nwhich held a mortgage on a multifamily house Bullard\nowned. Bullard\u2019s plan indicated that the mortgage was\nsignificantly \u201cunderwater\u201d: that is, the house was worth\nsubstantially less than the amount Bullard owed the\nBank.\n  Before submitting his plan for court approval, Bullard\namended it three times over the course of a year to more\naccurately reflect the value of the house, the terms of the\nmortgage, the amounts of creditors\u2019 claims, and his pro\u00ad\nposed payments. See \u00a71323 (allowing preconfirmation\nmodification). Bullard\u2019s third amended plan\u2014the one at\nissue here\u2014proposed a \u201chybrid\u201d treatment of his debt to\nthe Bank. He proposed splitting the debt into a secured\nclaim in the amount of the house\u2019s then-current value\n(which he estimated at $245,000), and an unsecured claim\nfor the remainder (roughly $101,000). Under the plan,\nBullard would continue making his regular mortgage\npayments toward the secured claim, which he would even\u00ad\ntually repay in full, long after the conclusion of his bank\u00ad\nruptcy case. He would treat the unsecured claim, how\u00ad\never, the same as any other unsecured debt, paying only as\nmuch on it as his income would allow over the course of\nhis five-year plan. At the end of this period the remaining\nbalance on the unsecured portion of the loan would be\ndischarged. In total, Bullard\u2019s plan called for him to pay\nonly about $5,000 of the $101,000 unsecured claim.\n  The Bank (no surprise) objected to the plan and, after a\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhearing, the Bankruptcy Court declined to confirm it.\nIn re Bullard, 475 B. R. 304 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mass. 2012). The\ncourt concluded that Chapter 13 did not allow Bullard to\nsplit the Bank\u2019s claim as he proposed unless he paid the\nsecured portion in full during the plan period. Id., at 314.\nThe court acknowledged, however, that other Bankruptcy\nCourts in the First Circuit had approved such arrange\u00ad\nments. Id., at 309. The Bankruptcy Court ordered\nBullard to submit a new plan within 30 days. Id., at 314.\n   Bullard appealed to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\n(BAP) of the First Circuit. The BAP first addressed its\njurisdiction under the bankruptcy appeals statute, noting\nthat a party can immediately appeal only \u201cfinal\u201d orders of\na bankruptcy court. In re Bullard, 494 B. R. 92, 95 (2013)\n(citing 28 U. S. C. \u00a7158(a)(1)). The BAP concluded that\nthe order denying plan confirmation was not final because\nBullard was \u201cfree to propose an alternate plan.\u201d 494 B. R.,\nat 95. The BAP nonetheless exercised its discretion to\nhear the appeal under a provision that allows interlocu\u00ad\ntory appeals \u201cwith leave of the court.\u201d \u00a7158(a)(3). The BAP\ngranted such leave because the confirmation dispute\ninvolved a \u201ccontrolling question of law . . . as to which\nthere is substantial ground for difference of opinion,\u201d and\n\u201can immediate appeal [would] materially advance the\nultimate termination of the litigation.\u201d 494 B. R., at 95,\nand n. 5. On the merits, the BAP agreed with the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court that Bullard\u2019s proposed treatment of the\nBank\u2019s claim was not allowed. Id., at 96\u2013101.\n   Bullard sought review in the Court of Appeals for the\nFirst Circuit, but that court dismissed his appeal for lack\nof jurisdiction. In re Bullard, 752 F. 3d 483 (2014). The\nFirst Circuit noted that because the BAP had not certified\nthe appeal under \u00a7158(d)(2), the only possible source of\nCourt of Appeals jurisdiction was \u00a7158(d)(1), which al\u00ad\nlowed appeal of only a final order of the BAP. Id., at 485,\nand n. 3. And under First Circuit precedent \u201can order of\n4              BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe BAP cannot be final unless the underlying bankruptcy\ncourt order is final.\u201d Id., at 485. The Court of Appeals\naccordingly examined whether a bankruptcy court\u2019s denial\nof plan confirmation is a final order, a question that it\nrecognized had divided the Circuits. Adopting the major\u00ad\nity view, the First Circuit concluded that an order denying\nconfirmation is not final so long as the debtor remains free\nto propose another plan. Id., at 486\u2013490.\n   We granted certiorari. 574 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                             II\n  In ordinary civil litigation, a case in federal district\ncourt culminates in a \u201cfinal decisio[n],\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291,\na ruling \u201cby which a district court disassociates itself from\na case,\u201d Swint v. Chambers County Comm\u2019n, 514 U. S. 35,\n42 (1995). A party can typically appeal as of right only\nfrom that final decision. This rule reflects the conclusion\nthat \u201c[p]ermitting piecemeal, prejudgment appeals . . .\nundermines \u2018efficient judicial administration\u2019 and en\u00ad\ncroaches upon the prerogatives of district court judges,\nwho play a \u2018special role\u2019 in managing ongoing litigation.\u201d\nMohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. 100, 106\n(2009) (quoting Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord,\n449 U. S. 368, 374 (1981)).\n  The rules are different in bankruptcy. A bankruptcy\ncase involves \u201can aggregation of individual controversies,\u201d\nmany of which would exist as stand-alone lawsuits but for\nthe bankrupt status of the debtor. 1 Collier on Bankruptcy\n\u00b65.08[1][b], p. 5\u201342 (16th ed. 2014). Accordingly, \u201cCon\u00ad\ngress has long provided that orders in bankruptcy cases\nmay be immediately appealed if they finally dispose of\ndiscrete disputes within the larger case.\u201d Howard Delivery\nService, Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co., 547 U. S. 651,\n657, n. 3 (2006) (internal quotation marks and emphasis\nomitted). The current bankruptcy appeals statute reflects\nthis approach: It authorizes appeals as of right not only\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom final judgments in cases but from \u201cfinal judgments,\norders, and decrees . . . in cases and proceedings.\u201d \u00a7158(a).\n   The present dispute is about how to define the immedi\u00ad\nately appealable \u201cproceeding\u201d in the context of the consid\u00ad\neration of Chapter 13 plans. Bullard argues for a plan-by\u00ad\nplan approach. Each time the bankruptcy court reviews a\nproposed plan, he says, it conducts a separate proceeding.\nOn this view, an order denying confirmation and an order\ngranting confirmation both terminate that proceeding, and\nboth are therefore final and appealable.\n   In the Bank\u2019s view Bullard is slicing the case too thin.\nThe relevant \u201cproceeding,\u201d it argues, is the entire process\nof considering plans, which terminates only when a plan is\nconfirmed or\u2014if the debtor fails to offer any confirmable\nplan\u2014when the case is dismissed. An order denying\nconfirmation is not final, so long as it leaves the debtor\nfree to propose another plan.\n   We agree with the Bank: The relevant proceeding is the\nprocess of attempting to arrive at an approved plan that\nwould allow the bankruptcy to move forward. This is so,\nfirst and foremost, because only plan confirmation\u2014or\ncase dismissal\u2014alters the status quo and fixes the rights\nand obligations of the parties. When the bankruptcy court\nconfirms a plan, its terms become binding on debtor and\ncreditor alike. 11 U. S. C. \u00a71327(a). Confirmation has\npreclusive effect, foreclosing relitigation of \u201cany issue\nactually litigated by the parties and any issue necessarily\ndetermined by the confirmation order.\u201d             8 Collier\n\u00b61327.02[1][c], at 1327\u20136; see also United Student Aid\nFunds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U. S. 260, 275 (2010) (finding\na confirmation order \u201cenforceable and binding\u201d on a credi\u00ad\ntor notwithstanding legal error when the creditor \u201chad\nnotice of the error and failed to object or timely appeal\u201d).\nSubject to certain exceptions, confirmation \u201cvests all of the\nproperty of the [bankruptcy] estate in the debtor,\u201d and\nrenders that property \u201cfree and clear of any claim or inter\u00ad\n6              BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nest of any creditor provided for by the plan.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71327(b),\n(c). Confirmation also triggers the Chapter 13 trustee\u2019s\nduty to distribute to creditors those funds already received\nfrom the debtor. \u00a71326(a)(2).\n   When confirmation is denied and the case is dismissed\nas a result, the consequences are similarly significant.\nDismissal of course dooms the possibility of a discharge\nand the other benefits available to a debtor under Chapter\n13. Dismissal lifts the automatic stay entered at the start\nof bankruptcy, exposing the debtor to creditors\u2019 legal\nactions and collection efforts. \u00a7362(c)(2). And it can limit\nthe availability of an automatic stay in a subsequent\nbankruptcy case. \u00a7362(c)(3).\n   Denial of confirmation with leave to amend, by contrast,\nchanges little. The automatic stay persists. The parties\u2019\nrights and obligations remain unsettled. The trustee\ncontinues to collect funds from the debtor in anticipation\nof a different plan\u2019s eventual confirmation. The possibility\nof discharge lives on. \u201cFinal\u201d does not describe this state\nof affairs. An order denying confirmation does rule out the\nspecific arrangement of relief embodied in a particular\nplan. But that alone does not make the denial final any\nmore than, say, a car buyer\u2019s declining to pay the sticker\nprice is viewed as a \u201cfinal\u201d purchasing decision by either\nthe buyer or seller. \u201cIt ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over.\u201d\n   Several additional considerations bolster our conclusion\nthat the relevant \u201cproceeding\u201d is the entire process culmi\u00ad\nnating in confirmation or dismissal. First is a textual\nclue. Among the list of \u201ccore proceedings\u201d statutorily\nentrusted to bankruptcy judges are \u201cconfirmations of\nplans.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(L). Although this item\nhardly clinches the matter for the Bank\u2014the provision\u2019s\npurpose is not to explain appealability\u2014it does cut in the\nBank\u2019s favor. The presence of the phrase \u201cconfirmations of\nplans,\u201d combined with the absence of any reference to\ndenials, suggests that Congress viewed the larger confir\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmation process as the \u201cproceeding,\u201d not the ruling on each\nspecific plan.\n   In Bullard\u2019s view the debtor can appeal the denial of the\nfirst plan he submits to the bankruptcy court. If the court\nof appeals affirms the denial, the debtor can then revise\nthe plan. If the new plan is also denied confirmation,\nanother appeal can ensue. And so on. As Bullard\u2019s case\nshows, each climb up the appellate ladder and slide down\nthe chute can take more than a year. Avoiding such de\u00ad\nlays and inefficiencies is precisely the reason for a rule of\nfinality. It does not make much sense to define the perti\u00ad\nnent proceeding so narrowly that the requirement of\nfinality would do little work as a meaningful constraint on\nthe availability of appellate review.\n   Bullard responds that concerns about frequent piece\u00ad\nmeal appeals are misplaced in this context. Debtors do\nnot typically have the money or incentives to take appeals\nover small beer issues. They will only appeal the rela\u00ad\ntively rare denials based on significant legal rulings\u2014\nprecisely the cases that should proceed promptly to the\ncourts of appeals. Brief for Petitioner 43\u201346.\n   Bullard\u2019s assurance notwithstanding, debtors may often\nview, in good faith or bad, the prospect of appeals as im\u00ad\nportant leverage in dealing with creditors. An appeal\nextends the automatic stay that comes with bankruptcy,\nwhich can cost creditors money and allow a debtor to\nretain property he might lose if the Chapter 13 proceeding\nturns out not to be viable. These concerns are heightened\nif the same rule applies in Chapter 11, as the parties\nassume. Chapter 11 debtors, often business entities, are\nmore likely to have the resources to appeal and may do so\non narrow issues. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. But even if\nBullard is correct that such appeals will be rare, that does\nnot much support his broader point that an appeal of right\nshould be allowed in every case. It is odd, after all, to\nargue in favor of allowing more appeals by emphasizing\n8              BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat almost nobody will take them.\n  We think that in the ordinary case treating only confir\u00ad\nmation or dismissal as final will not unfairly burden a\ndebtor. He retains the valuable exclusive right to propose\nplans, which he can modify freely. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71321,\n1323. The knowledge that he will have no guaranteed\nappeal from a denial should encourage the debtor to work\nwith creditors and the trustee to develop a confirmable\nplan as promptly as possible. And expedition is always an\nimportant consideration in bankruptcy.\n                              III\n   Bullard and the Solicitor General present several argu\u00ad\nments for treating each plan denial as final, but we are not\npersuaded.\n   The Solicitor General notes that disputes in bankruptcy\nare generally classified as either \u201cadversary proceedings,\u201d\nessentially full civil lawsuits carried out under the um\u00ad\nbrella of the bankruptcy case, or \u201ccontested matters,\u201d an\nundefined catchall for other issues the parties dispute.\nSee Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7001 (listing ten adversary\nproceedings); Rule 9014 (addressing \u201ccontested matter[s]\nnot otherwise governed by these rules\u201d). An objection to a\nplan initiates a contested matter. See Rule 3015(f). Ev\u00ad\neryone agrees that an order resolving that matter by over\u00ad\nruling the objection and confirming the plan is final. As\nthe Solicitor General sees it, an order denying confirma\u00ad\ntion would also resolve that contested matter, so such an\norder should also be considered final. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 19\u201322.\n   The scope of the Solicitor General\u2019s argument is unclear.\nAt points his brief appears to argue that an order resolv\u00ad\ning any contested matter is final and immediately appeal-\nable. That version of the argument has the virtue of rest\u00ad\ning on a general principle\u2014but the vice of being\nimplausible. As a leading treatise notes, the list of con\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntested matters is \u201cendless\u201d and covers all sorts of minor\ndisagreements. 10 Collier \u00b69014.01, at 9014\u20133. The\nconcept of finality cannot stretch to cover, for example, an\norder resolving a disputed request for an extension of\ntime.\n  At other points, the Solicitor General appears to argue\nthat because one possible resolution of this particular\ncontested matter (confirmation) is final, the other (denial)\nmust be as well. But this argument begs the question. It\nsimply assumes that confirmation is appealable because it\nresolves a contested matter, and that therefore anything\nelse that resolves the contested matter must also be ap\u00ad\npealable. But one can just as easily contend that confir\u00ad\nmation is appealable because it resolves the entire plan\nconsideration process, and that therefore the entire pro\u00ad\ncess is the \u201cproceeding.\u201d A decision that does not resolve\nthe entire plan consideration process\u2014denial\u2014is therefore\nnot appealable.\n  Perhaps the Solicitor General\u2019s suggestion is that a\nseparately appealable \u201cproceeding\u201d must coincide precisely\nwith a particular \u201cadversary proceeding\u201d or \u201ccontested\nmatter\u201d under the Bankruptcy Rules. He does not, how\u00ad\never, provide any support for such a suggestion. More\nbroadly, it is of course quite common for the finality of a\ndecision to depend on which way the decision goes. An\norder granting a motion for summary judgment is final; an\norder denying such a motion is not.\n  Bullard and the Solicitor General also contend that our\nrule creates an unfair asymmetry: If the bankruptcy court\nsustains an objection and denies confirmation, the debtor\n(always the plan proponent in Chapter 13) must go back to\nthe drafting table and try again; but if the bankruptcy\ncourt overrules an objection and grants confirmation, a\ncreditor can appeal without delay. But any asymmetry in\nthis regard simply reflects the fact that confirmation\nallows the bankruptcy to go forward and alters the legal\n10             BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelationships among the parties, while denial does not\nhave such significant consequences.\n   Moreover, it is not clear that this asymmetry will always\nadvantage creditors. Consider a creditor who strongly\nsupports a proposed plan because it treats him well. If\nthe bankruptcy court sustains an objection from another\ncreditor\u2014perhaps because the plan treats the first credi\u00ad\ntor too well\u2014the first creditor might have as keen an\ninterest in a prompt appeal as the debtor. And yet, under\nthe rule we adopt, that creditor too would have to await\nfurther developments.\n   Bullard also raises a more practical objection. If denial\norders are not final, he says, there will be no effective\nmeans of obtaining appellate review of the denied pro\u00ad\nposal. The debtor\u2019s only two options would be to seek or\naccept dismissal of his case and then appeal, or to propose\nan amended plan and appeal its confirmation.\n   The first option is not realistic, Bullard contends, be\u00ad\ncause dismissal means the end of the automatic stay\nagainst creditors\u2019 collection efforts. Without the stay, the\ndebtor might lose the very property at issue in the rejected\nplan. Even if a bankruptcy court agrees to maintain the\nstay pending appeal, the debtor is still risking his entire\nbankruptcy case on the appeal.\n   The second option is no better, says Bullard. An ac\u00ad\nceptable, confirmable alternative may not exist. Even if\none does, its confirmation might have immediate and\nirreversible effects\u2014such as the sale or transfer of prop\u00ad\nerty\u2014and a court is unlikely to stay its execution. More\u00ad\nover, it simply wastes time and money to place the debtor\nin the position of seeking approval of a plan he does not\nwant.\n   All good points. We do not doubt that in many cases\nthese options may be, as the court below put it, \u201cunappeal\u00ad\ning.\u201d 752 F. 3d, at 487.

S. 863, 872\n(1994). This prospect is made tolerable in part by our\nconfidence that bankruptcy courts, like trial courts in\nordinary litigation, rule correctly most of the time. And\neven when they slip, many of their errors\u2014wrongly con\u00ad\ncluding, say, that a debtor should pay unsecured creditors\n$400 a month rather than $300\u2014will not be of a sort that\njustifies the costs entailed by a system of universal imme\u00ad\ndiate appeals.\n  Sometimes, of course, a question will be important\nenough that it should be addressed immediately.\nBullard\u2019s case could well fit the bill: The confirmability of\nhis hybrid plan presented a pure question of law that had\ndivided bankruptcy courts in the First Circuit and would\nmake a substantial financial difference to the parties. But\nthere are several mechanisms for interlocutory review to\naddress such cases. First, a district court or BAP can (as\nthe BAP did in this case) grant leave to hear such an\nappeal. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7158(a)(3). A debtor who appeals to\nthe district court and loses there can seek certification to\nthe court of appeals under the general interlocutory ap\u00ad\npeals statute, \u00a71292(b). See Connecticut Nat. Bank v.\nGermain, 503 U. S. 249 (1992).\n  Another interlocutory mechanism is provided in\n\u00a7158(d)(2). That provision allows a bankruptcy court,\ndistrict court, BAP, or the parties acting jointly to certify a\nbankruptcy court\u2019s order to the court of appeals, which\nthen has discretion to hear the matter. Unlike \u00a71292(b),\nwhich permits certification only when three enumerated\nfactors suggesting importance are all present, \u00a7158(d)(2)\npermits certification when any one of several such factors\nexists, a distinction that allows a broader range of inter\u00ad\nlocutory decisions to make their way to the courts of ap\u00ad\npeals. While discretionary review mechanisms such as\nthese \u201cdo not provide relief in every case, they serve as\n12             BULLARD v.

But Bullard did, after all, obtain one layer\nof interlocutory review when the BAP granted him leave\nto appeal under \u00a7158(a)(3). He also sought certification to\nthe Court of Appeals under \u00a7158(d)(2), but the BAP denied\nhis request for reasons that are not entirely clear. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 17a. The fact that Bullard was not\nable to obtain further merits review in the First Circuit in\nthis particular instance does not undermine our expecta\u00ad\ntion that lower courts will certify and accept interlocutory\nappeals from plan denials in appropriate cases.\n                      *     *    *\n  Because the Court of Appeals correctly held that the\norder denying confirmation was not final, its judgment is\n\n                                                  Affirmed.\n",

Argued April 1, 2015\u2014Decided May 4, 2015\nAfter filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, petitioner Bullard submitted a\n  proposed repayment plan to the Bankruptcy Court. Respondent Blue\n  Hills Bank, Bullard\u2019s mortgage lender, objected to the plan\u2019s treat-\n  ment of its claim. The Bankruptcy Court sustained the Bank\u2019s objec-\n  tion and declined to confirm the plan. Bullard appealed to the First\n  Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP). The BAP concluded that\n  the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s denial of confirmation was not a final, ap-\n  pealable order, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7158(a)(1), but heard the appeal under\n  a provision permitting interlocutory appeals \u201cwith leave of the court,\u201d\n  \u00a7158(a)(3), and agreed with the Bankruptcy Court that Bullard\u2019s pro-\n  posed plan was not allowed. Bullard appealed to the First Circuit,\n  but it dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. It concluded that its jurisdic-\n  tion depended on the finality of the BAP\u2019s order, which in turn de-\n  pended on the finality of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order. And it found\n  that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order denying confirmation was not final\n  so long as Bullard remained free to propose another plan.\nHeld: A bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying confirmation of a debtor\u2019s\n proposed repayment plan is not a final order that the debtor can im-\n mediately appeal. Pp. 4\u201312.\n    (a) Congress has long treated orders in bankruptcy cases as imme-\n diately appealable \u201cif they finally dispose of discrete disputes within\n the larger case,\u201d Howard Delivery Service, Inc. v. Zurich American\n Ins. Co., 547 U. S. 651, 657, n. 3. This approach is reflected in the\n current statute, which provides that bankruptcy appeals as of right\n may be taken not only from final judgments in cases but from \u201cfinal\n judgments, orders, and decrees . . . in cases and proceedings.\u201d 28\n U. S. C. \u00a7158(a). Bullard argues that a bankruptcy court conducts a\n2                   BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    separate proceeding each time it reviews a proposed plan, and there-\n    fore a court\u2019s order either confirming or denying a plan terminates\n    the proceeding and is final and immediately appealable. But the rel-\n    evant proceeding is the entire process of attempting to arrive at an\n    approved plan that would allow the bankruptcy case to move for-\n    ward. Only plan confirmation, or case dismissal, alters the status\n    quo and fixes the parties\u2019 rights and obligations; denial of confirma-\n    tion with leave to amend changes little and can hardly be described\n    as final. Additional considerations\u2014that the statute defining core\n    bankruptcy proceedings lists \u201cconfirmations of plans,\u201d \u00a7157(b)(2)(L),\n    but omits any reference to denials; that immediate appeals from de-\n    nials would result in delays and inefficiencies that requirements of\n    finality are designed to constrain; and that a debtor\u2019s inability to im-\n    mediately appeal a denial encourages the debtor to work with credi-\n    tors and the trustee to develop a confirmable plan\u2014bolster the con-\n    clusion that the relevant proceeding is the entire process culminating\n    in confirmation or dismissal. Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (b) The Solicitor General suggests that because bankruptcy dis-\n    putes are generally classified as either \u201cadversary proceedings\u201d or\n    \u201ccontested matters,\u201d and because an order denying confirmation and\n    an order granting confirmation both resolve a contested matter, both\n    should be considered final. This argument simply assumes that con-\n    firmation is appealable because it resolves a contested matter, and\n    that therefore anything else that resolves the contested matter must\n    also be appealable. But one could just as easily contend that confir-\n    mation is appealable because it resolves the entire plan consideration\n    process, while denial is not because it does not. Any asymmetry in\n    denying the debtor an immediate appeal from a denial while allowing\n    a creditor an immediate appeal from a confirmation simply reflects\n    the fact that confirmation allows the bankruptcy to go forward and\n    alters the legal relationships among the parties, while denial lacks\n    such significant consequences. Nor is it clear that the asymmetry\n    will always advantage creditors. Finally, Bullard contends that un-\n    less denial orders are final, a debtor will be required to choose be-\n    tween two untenable options: either accept dismissal of the case and\n    then appeal, or propose an amended but unwanted plan and appeal\n    its confirmation. These options will often be unsatisfying, but our lit-\n    igation system has long accepted that certain burdensome rulings\n    will be \u201conly imperfectly reparable\u201d by the appellate process.

BULLARD, PETITIONER v. BLUE HILLS \n\n     BANK, FKA HYDE PARK SAVINGS BANK\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                  [May 4, 2015]\n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code affords individuals\nreceiving regular income an opportunity to obtain some\nrelief from their debts while retaining their property. To\nproceed under Chapter 13, a debtor must propose a plan to\nuse future income to repay a portion (or in the rare case\nall) of his debts over the next three to five years. If the\nbankruptcy court confirms the plan and the debtor suc\u00ad\ncessfully carries it out, he receives a discharge of his debts\naccording to the plan.\n  The bankruptcy court may, however, decline to confirm\na proposed repayment plan because it is inconsistent with\nthe Code. Although the debtor is usually given an oppor\u00ad\ntunity to submit a revised plan, he may be convinced that\nthe original plan complied with the Code and that the\nbankruptcy court was wrong to deny confirmation. The\nquestion presented is whether such an order denying\nconfirmation is a \u201cfinal\u201d order that the debtor can immedi\u00ad\nately appeal. We hold that it is not.\n2              BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n  In December 2010, Louis Bullard filed a petition for\nChapter 13 bankruptcy in Federal Bankruptcy Court in\nMassachusetts. A week later he filed a proposed repay\u00ad\nment plan listing the various claims he anticipated credi\u00ad\ntors would file and the monthly amounts he planned to\npay on each claim over the five-year life of his plan. See\n11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71321, 1322. Chief among Bullard\u2019s debts\nwas the roughly $346,000 he owed to Blue Hills Bank,\nwhich held a mortgage on a multifamily house Bullard\nowned. Bullard\u2019s plan indicated that the mortgage was\nsignificantly \u201cunderwater\u201d: that is, the house was worth\nsubstantially less than the amount Bullard owed the\nBank.\n  Before submitting his plan for court approval, Bullard\namended it three times over the course of a year to more\naccurately reflect the value of the house, the terms of the\nmortgage, the amounts of creditors\u2019 claims, and his pro\u00ad\nposed payments. See \u00a71323 (allowing preconfirmation\nmodification). Bullard\u2019s third amended plan\u2014the one at\nissue here\u2014proposed a \u201chybrid\u201d treatment of his debt to\nthe Bank. He proposed splitting the debt into a secured\nclaim in the amount of the house\u2019s then-current value\n(which he estimated at $245,000), and an unsecured claim\nfor the remainder (roughly $101,000). Under the plan,\nBullard would continue making his regular mortgage\npayments toward the secured claim, which he would even\u00ad\ntually repay in full, long after the conclusion of his bank\u00ad\nruptcy case. He would treat the unsecured claim, how\u00ad\never, the same as any other unsecured debt, paying only as\nmuch on it as his income would allow over the course of\nhis five-year plan. At the end of this period the remaining\nbalance on the unsecured portion of the loan would be\ndischarged. In total, Bullard\u2019s plan called for him to pay\nonly about $5,000 of the $101,000 unsecured claim.\n  The Bank (no surprise) objected to the plan and, after a\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhearing, the Bankruptcy Court declined to confirm it.\nIn re Bullard, 475 B. R. 304 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mass. 2012). The\ncourt concluded that Chapter 13 did not allow Bullard to\nsplit the Bank\u2019s claim as he proposed unless he paid the\nsecured portion in full during the plan period. Id., at 314.\nThe court acknowledged, however, that other Bankruptcy\nCourts in the First Circuit had approved such arrange\u00ad\nments. Id., at 309. The Bankruptcy Court ordered\nBullard to submit a new plan within 30 days. Id., at 314.\n   Bullard appealed to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\n(BAP) of the First Circuit. The BAP first addressed its\njurisdiction under the bankruptcy appeals statute, noting\nthat a party can immediately appeal only \u201cfinal\u201d orders of\na bankruptcy court. In re Bullard, 494 B. R. 92, 95 (2013)\n(citing 28 U. S. C. \u00a7158(a)(1)). The BAP concluded that\nthe order denying plan confirmation was not final because\nBullard was \u201cfree to propose an alternate plan.\u201d 494 B. R.,\nat 95. The BAP nonetheless exercised its discretion to\nhear the appeal under a provision that allows interlocu\u00ad\ntory appeals \u201cwith leave of the court.\u201d \u00a7158(a)(3). The BAP\ngranted such leave because the confirmation dispute\ninvolved a \u201ccontrolling question of law . . . as to which\nthere is substantial ground for difference of opinion,\u201d and\n\u201can immediate appeal [would] materially advance the\nultimate termination of the litigation.\u201d 494 B. R., at 95,\nand n. 5. On the merits, the BAP agreed with the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court that Bullard\u2019s proposed treatment of the\nBank\u2019s claim was not allowed. Id., at 96\u2013101.\n   Bullard sought review in the Court of Appeals for the\nFirst Circuit, but that court dismissed his appeal for lack\nof jurisdiction. In re Bullard, 752 F. 3d 483 (2014). The\nFirst Circuit noted that because the BAP had not certified\nthe appeal under \u00a7158(d)(2), the only possible source of\nCourt of Appeals jurisdiction was \u00a7158(d)(1), which al\u00ad\nlowed appeal of only a final order of the BAP. Id., at 485,\nand n. 3. And under First Circuit precedent \u201can order of\n4              BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe BAP cannot be final unless the underlying bankruptcy\ncourt order is final.\u201d Id., at 485. The Court of Appeals\naccordingly examined whether a bankruptcy court\u2019s denial\nof plan confirmation is a final order, a question that it\nrecognized had divided the Circuits. Adopting the major\u00ad\nity view, the First Circuit concluded that an order denying\nconfirmation is not final so long as the debtor remains free\nto propose another plan. Id., at 486\u2013490.\n   We granted certiorari. 574 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                             II\n  In ordinary civil litigation, a case in federal district\ncourt culminates in a \u201cfinal decisio[n],\u201d 28 U. S.

Carpenter, 558 U. S. 100, 106\n(2009) (quoting Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord,\n449 U. S. 368, 374 (1981)).\n  The rules are different in bankruptcy. A bankruptcy\ncase involves \u201can aggregation of individual controversies,\u201d\nmany of which would exist as stand-alone lawsuits but for\nthe bankrupt status of the debtor. 1 Collier on Bankruptcy\n\u00b65.08[1][b], p. 5\u201342 (16th ed. 2014). Accordingly, \u201cCon\u00ad\ngress has long provided that orders in bankruptcy cases\nmay be immediately appealed if they finally dispose of\ndiscrete disputes within the larger case.\u201d Howard Delivery\nService, Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co., 547 U. S. 651,\n657, n. 3 (2006) (internal quotation marks and emphasis\nomitted). The current bankruptcy appeals statute reflects\nthis approach: It authorizes appeals as of right not only\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom final judgments in cases but from \u201cfinal judgments,\norders, and decrees . . . in cases and proceedings.\u201d \u00a7158(a).\n   The present dispute is about how to define the immedi\u00ad\nately appealable \u201cproceeding\u201d in the context of the consid\u00ad\neration of Chapter 13 plans. Bullard argues for a plan-by\u00ad\nplan approach. Each time the bankruptcy court reviews a\nproposed plan, he says, it conducts a separate proceeding.\nOn this view, an order denying confirmation and an order\ngranting confirmation both terminate that proceeding, and\nboth are therefore final and appealable.\n   In the Bank\u2019s view Bullard is slicing the case too thin.\nThe relevant \u201cproceeding,\u201d it argues, is the entire process\nof considering plans, which terminates only when a plan is\nconfirmed or\u2014if the debtor fails to offer any confirmable\nplan\u2014when the case is dismissed. An order denying\nconfirmation is not final, so long as it leaves the debtor\nfree to propose another plan.\n   We agree with the Bank: The relevant proceeding is the\nprocess of attempting to arrive at an approved plan that\nwould allow the bankruptcy to move forward. This is so,\nfirst and foremost, because only plan confirmation\u2014or\ncase dismissal\u2014alters the status quo and fixes the rights\nand obligations of the parties. When the bankruptcy court\nconfirms a plan, its terms become binding on debtor and\ncreditor alike. 11 U. S. C. \u00a71327(a). Confirmation has\npreclusive effect, foreclosing relitigation of \u201cany issue\nactually litigated by the parties and any issue necessarily\ndetermined by the confirmation order.\u201d             8 Collier\n\u00b61327.02[1][c], at 1327\u20136; see also United Student Aid\nFunds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U. S. 260, 275 (2010) (finding\na confirmation order \u201cenforceable and binding\u201d on a credi\u00ad\ntor notwithstanding legal error when the creditor \u201chad\nnotice of the error and failed to object or timely appeal\u201d).\nSubject to certain exceptions, confirmation \u201cvests all of the\nproperty of the [bankruptcy] estate in the debtor,\u201d and\nrenders that property \u201cfree and clear of any claim or inter\u00ad\n6              BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nest of any creditor provided for by the plan.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71327(b),\n(c). Confirmation also triggers the Chapter 13 trustee\u2019s\nduty to distribute to creditors those funds already received\nfrom the debtor. \u00a71326(a)(2).\n   When confirmation is denied and the case is dismissed\nas a result, the consequences are similarly significant.\nDismissal of course dooms the possibility of a discharge\nand the other benefits available to a debtor under Chapter\n13. Dismissal lifts the automatic stay entered at the start\nof bankruptcy, exposing the debtor to creditors\u2019 legal\nactions and collection efforts. \u00a7362(c)(2). And it can limit\nthe availability of an automatic stay in a subsequent\nbankruptcy case. \u00a7362(c)(3).\n   Denial of confirmation with leave to amend, by contrast,\nchanges little. The automatic stay persists. The parties\u2019\nrights and obligations remain unsettled. The trustee\ncontinues to collect funds from the debtor in anticipation\nof a different plan\u2019s eventual confirmation. The possibility\nof discharge lives on. \u201cFinal\u201d does not describe this state\nof affairs. An order denying confirmation does rule out the\nspecific arrangement of relief embodied in a particular\nplan. But that alone does not make the denial final any\nmore than, say, a car buyer\u2019s declining to pay the sticker\nprice is viewed as a \u201cfinal\u201d purchasing decision by either\nthe buyer or seller. \u201cIt ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over.\u201d\n   Several additional considerations bolster our conclusion\nthat the relevant \u201cproceeding\u201d is the entire process culmi\u00ad\nnating in confirmation or dismissal. First is a textual\nclue. Among the list of \u201ccore proceedings\u201d statutorily\nentrusted to bankruptcy judges are \u201cconfirmations of\nplans.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(L). Although this item\nhardly clinches the matter for the Bank\u2014the provision\u2019s\npurpose is not to explain appealability\u2014it does cut in the\nBank\u2019s favor. The presence of the phrase \u201cconfirmations of\nplans,\u201d combined with the absence of any reference to\ndenials, suggests that Congress viewed the larger confir\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmation process as the \u201cproceeding,\u201d not the ruling on each\nspecific plan.\n   In Bullard\u2019s view the debtor can appeal the denial of the\nfirst plan he submits to the bankruptcy court. If the court\nof appeals affirms the denial, the debtor can then revise\nthe plan. If the new plan is also denied confirmation,\nanother appeal can ensue. And so on. As Bullard\u2019s case\nshows, each climb up the appellate ladder and slide down\nthe chute can take more than a year. Avoiding such de\u00ad\nlays and inefficiencies is precisely the reason for a rule of\nfinality. It does not make much sense to define the perti\u00ad\nnent proceeding so narrowly that the requirement of\nfinality would do little work as a meaningful constraint on\nthe availability of appellate review.\n   Bullard responds that concerns about frequent piece\u00ad\nmeal appeals are misplaced in this context. Debtors do\nnot typically have the money or incentives to take appeals\nover small beer issues. They will only appeal the rela\u00ad\ntively rare denials based on significant legal rulings\u2014\nprecisely the cases that should proceed promptly to the\ncourts of appeals. Brief for Petitioner 43\u201346.\n   Bullard\u2019s assurance notwithstanding, debtors may often\nview, in good faith or bad, the prospect of appeals as im\u00ad\nportant leverage in dealing with creditors. An appeal\nextends the automatic stay that comes with bankruptcy,\nwhich can cost creditors money and allow a debtor to\nretain property he might lose if the Chapter 13 proceeding\nturns out not to be viable. These concerns are heightened\nif the same rule applies in Chapter 11, as the parties\nassume. Chapter 11 debtors, often business entities, are\nmore likely to have the resources to appeal and may do so\non narrow issues. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. But even if\nBullard is correct that such appeals will be rare, that does\nnot much support his broader point that an appeal of right\nshould be allowed in every case. It is odd, after all, to\nargue in favor of allowing more appeals by emphasizing\n8              BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat almost nobody will take them.\n  We think that in the ordinary case treating only confir\u00ad\nmation or dismissal as final will not unfairly burden a\ndebtor. He retains the valuable exclusive right to propose\nplans, which he can modify freely. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71321,\n1323. The knowledge that he will have no guaranteed\nappeal from a denial should encourage the debtor to work\nwith creditors and the trustee to develop a confirmable\nplan as promptly as possible. And expedition is always an\nimportant consideration in bankruptcy.\n                              III\n   Bullard and the Solicitor General present several argu\u00ad\nments for treating each plan denial as final, but we are not\npersuaded.\n   The Solicitor General notes that disputes in bankruptcy\nare generally classified as either \u201cadversary proceedings,\u201d\nessentially full civil lawsuits carried out under the um\u00ad\nbrella of the bankruptcy case, or \u201ccontested matters,\u201d an\nundefined catchall for other issues the parties dispute.\nSee Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7001 (listing ten adversary\nproceedings); Rule 9014 (addressing \u201ccontested matter[s]\nnot otherwise governed by these rules\u201d). An objection to a\nplan initiates a contested matter. See Rule 3015(f). Ev\u00ad\neryone agrees that an order resolving that matter by over\u00ad\nruling the objection and confirming the plan is final. As\nthe Solicitor General sees it, an order denying confirma\u00ad\ntion would also resolve that contested matter, so such an\norder should also be considered final. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 19\u201322.\n   The scope of the Solicitor General\u2019s argument is unclear.\nAt points his brief appears to argue that an order resolv\u00ad\ning any contested matter is final and immediately appeal-\nable. That version of the argument has the virtue of rest\u00ad\ning on a general principle\u2014but the vice of being\nimplausible. As a leading treatise notes, the list of con\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntested matters is \u201cendless\u201d and covers all sorts of minor\ndisagreements. 10 Collier \u00b69014.01, at 9014\u20133. The\nconcept of finality cannot stretch to cover, for example, an\norder resolving a disputed request for an extension of\ntime.\n  At other points, the Solicitor General appears to argue\nthat because one possible resolution of this particular\ncontested matter (confirmation) is final, the other (denial)\nmust be as well. But this argument begs the question. It\nsimply assumes that confirmation is appealable because it\nresolves a contested matter, and that therefore anything\nelse that resolves the contested matter must also be ap\u00ad\npealable. But one can just as easily contend that confir\u00ad\nmation is appealable because it resolves the entire plan\nconsideration process, and that therefore the entire pro\u00ad\ncess is the \u201cproceeding.\u201d A decision that does not resolve\nthe entire plan consideration process\u2014denial\u2014is therefore\nnot appealable.\n  Perhaps the Solicitor General\u2019s suggestion is that a\nseparately appealable \u201cproceeding\u201d must coincide precisely\nwith a particular \u201cadversary proceeding\u201d or \u201ccontested\nmatter\u201d under the Bankruptcy Rules. He does not, how\u00ad\never, provide any support for such a suggestion. More\nbroadly, it is of course quite common for the finality of a\ndecision to depend on which way the decision goes. An\norder granting a motion for summary judgment is final; an\norder denying such a motion is not.\n  Bullard and the Solicitor General also contend that our\nrule creates an unfair asymmetry: If the bankruptcy court\nsustains an objection and denies confirmation, the debtor\n(always the plan proponent in Chapter 13) must go back to\nthe drafting table and try again; but if the bankruptcy\ncourt overrules an objection and grants confirmation, a\ncreditor can appeal without delay. But any asymmetry in\nthis regard simply reflects the fact that confirmation\nallows the bankruptcy to go forward and alters the legal\n10             BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelationships among the parties, while denial does not\nhave such significant consequences.\n   Moreover, it is not clear that this asymmetry will always\nadvantage creditors. Consider a creditor who strongly\nsupports a proposed plan because it treats him well. If\nthe bankruptcy court sustains an objection from another\ncreditor\u2014perhaps because the plan treats the first credi\u00ad\ntor too well\u2014the first creditor might have as keen an\ninterest in a prompt appeal as the debtor. And yet, under\nthe rule we adopt, that creditor too would have to await\nfurther developments.\n   Bullard also raises a more practical objection. If denial\norders are not final, he says, there will be no effective\nmeans of obtaining appellate review of the denied pro\u00ad\nposal. The debtor\u2019s only two options would be to seek or\naccept dismissal of his case and then appeal, or to propose\nan amended plan and appeal its confirmation.\n   The first option is not realistic, Bullard contends, be\u00ad\ncause dismissal means the end of the automatic stay\nagainst creditors\u2019 collection efforts. Without the stay, the\ndebtor might lose the very property at issue in the rejected\nplan. Even if a bankruptcy court agrees to maintain the\nstay pending appeal, the debtor is still risking his entire\nbankruptcy case on the appeal.\n   The second option is no better, says Bullard. An ac\u00ad\nceptable, confirmable alternative may not exist. Even if\none does, its confirmation might have immediate and\nirreversible effects\u2014such as the sale or transfer of prop\u00ad\nerty\u2014and a court is unlikely to stay its execution. More\u00ad\nover, it simply wastes time and money to place the debtor\nin the position of seeking approval of a plan he does not\nwant.\n   All good points. We do not doubt that in many cases\nthese options may be, as the court below put it, \u201cunappeal\u00ad\ning.\u201d 752 F. 3d, at 487. But our litigation system has long\naccepted that certain burdensome rulings will be \u201conly\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimperfectly reparable\u201d by the appellate process. Digital\nEquipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 872\n(1994). This prospect is made tolerable in part by our\nconfidence that bankruptcy courts, like trial courts in\nordinary litigation, rule correctly most of the time. And\neven when they slip, many of their errors\u2014wrongly con\u00ad\ncluding, say, that a debtor should pay unsecured creditors\n$400 a month rather than $300\u2014will not be of a sort that\njustifies the costs entailed by a system of universal imme\u00ad\ndiate appeals.\n  Sometimes, of course, a question will be important\nenough that it should be addressed immediately.\nBullard\u2019s case could well fit the bill: The confirmability of\nhis hybrid plan presented a pure question of law that had\ndivided bankruptcy courts in the First Circuit and would\nmake a substantial financial difference to the parties. But\nthere are several mechanisms for interlocutory review to\naddress such cases. First, a district court or BAP can (as\nthe BAP did in this case) grant leave to hear such an\nappeal. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7158(a)(3). A debtor who appeals to\nthe district court and loses there can seek certification to\nthe court of appeals under the general interlocutory ap\u00ad\npeals statute, \u00a71292(b). See Connecticut Nat. Bank v.\nGermain, 503 U. S. 249 (1992).\n  Another interlocutory mechanism is provided in\n\u00a7158(d)(2). That provision allows a bankruptcy court,\ndistrict court, BAP, or the parties acting jointly to certify a\nbankruptcy court\u2019s order to the court of appeals, which\nthen has discretion to hear the matter. Unlike \u00a71292(b),\nwhich permits certification only when three enumerated\nfactors suggesting importance are all present, \u00a7158(d)(2)\npermits certification when any one of several such factors\nexists, a distinction that allows a broader range of inter\u00ad\nlocutory decisions to make their way to the courts of ap\u00ad\npeals. While discretionary review mechanisms such as\nthese \u201cdo not provide relief in every case, they serve as\n12             BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nuseful safety valves for promptly correcting serious errors\u201d\nand addressing important legal questions. Mohawk In-\ndustries, 558 U. S., at 111 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted).\n   Bullard maintains that interlocutory appeals are inef\u00ad\nfective because lower courts have been too reticent in\ngranting them. But Bullard did, after all, obtain one layer\nof interlocutory review when the BAP granted him leave\nto appeal under \u00a7158(a)(3). He also sought certification to\nthe Court of Appeals under \u00a7158(d)(2), but the BAP denied\nhis request for reasons that are not entirely clear. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 17a. The fact that Bullard was not\nable to obtain further merits review in the First Circuit in\nthis particular instance does not undermine our expecta\u00ad\ntion that lower courts will certify and accept interlocutory\nappeals from plan denials in appropriate cases.\n                      *     *    *\n  Because the Court of Appeals correctly held that the\norder denying confirmation was not final, its judgment is\n\n                                                  Affirmed.\n</pre>",
