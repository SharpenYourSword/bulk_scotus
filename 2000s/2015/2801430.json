EDISON INTERNATIONAL ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 13\u2013550.      Argued February 24, 2015\u2014Decided May 18, 2015\nIn 2007, petitioners, beneficiaries of the Edison 401(k) Savings Plan\n  (Plan), sued Plan fiduciaries, respondents Edison International and\n  others, to recover damages for alleged losses suffered by the Plan\n  from alleged breaches of respondents\u2019 fiduciary duties. As relevant\n  here, petitioners argued that respondents violated their fiduciary du-\n  ties with respect to three mutual funds added to the Plan in 1999 and\n  three mutual funds added to the Plan in 2002. Petitioners argued\n  that respondents acted imprudently by offering six higher priced re-\n  tail-class mutual funds as Plan investments when materially identi-\n  cal lower priced institutional-class mutual funds were available. Be-\n  cause ERISA requires a breach of fiduciary duty complaint to be filed\n  no more than six years after \u201cthe date of the last action which consti-\n  tutes a part of the breach or violation\u201d or \u201cin the case of an omission\n  the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or\n  violation,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a71113, the District Court held that petitioners\u2019\n  complaint as to the 1999 funds was untimely because they were in-\n  cluded in the Plan more than six years before the complaint was\n  filed, and the circumstances had not changed enough within the 6-\n  year statutory period to place respondents under an obligation to re-\n  view the mutual funds and to convert them to lower priced institu-\n  tional-class funds. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that peti-\n  tioners had not established a change in circumstances that might\n  trigger an obligation to conduct a full due diligence review of the\n  1999 funds within the 6-year statutory period.\nHeld: The Ninth Circuit erred by applying \u00a71113\u2019s statutory bar to a\n breach of fiduciary duty claim based on the initial selection of the in-\n vestments without considering the contours of the alleged breach of\n fiduciary duty. ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duty is \u201cderived from the common\n2                       TIBBLE v. EDISON INT\u2019L\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    law of trusts,\u201d Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension\n    Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559, 570, which provides\n    that a trustee has a continuing duty\u2014separate and apart from the\n    duty to exercise prudence in selecting investments at the outset\u2014to\n    monitor, and remove imprudent, trust investments. So long as a\n    plaintiff\u2019s claim alleging breach of the continuing duty of prudence\n    occurred within six years of suit, the claim is timely. This Court ex-\n    presses no view on the scope of respondents\u2019 fiduciary duty in this\n    case, e.g., whether a review of the contested mutual funds is required,\n    and, if so, just what kind of review. A fiduciary must discharge his\n    responsibilities \u201cwith the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\u201d that a\n    prudent person \u201cacting in a like capacity and familiar with such mat-\n    ters\u201d would use. \u00a71104(a)(1). The case is remanded for the Ninth\n    Circuit to consider petitioners\u2019 claims that respondents breached\n    their duties within the relevant 6-year statutory period under \u00a71113,\n    recognizing the importance of analogous trust law.

S. C. \u00a71113. The\nquestion before us concerns application of this provision to\nthe timeliness of a fiduciary duty complaint. It requires\nus to consider whether a fiduciary\u2019s allegedly imprudent\nretention of an investment is an \u201caction\u201d or \u201comission\u201d that\ntriggers the running of the 6-year limitations period.\n\n   In 2007, several individual beneficiaries of the Edison\n401(k) Savings Plan (Plan) filed a lawsuit on behalf of the\nPlan and all similarly situated beneficiaries (collectively,\npetitioners) against Edison International and others (col-\nlectively, respondents). Petitioners sought to recover\ndamages for alleged losses suffered by the Plan, in addi-\ntion to injunctive and other equitable relief based on al-\n2                   TIBBLE v. EDISON INT\u2019L\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nleged breaches of respondents\u2019 fiduciary duties.\n   The Plan is a defined-contribution plan, meaning that\nparticipants\u2019 retirement benefits are limited to the value\nof their own individual investment accounts, which is\ndetermined by the market performance of employee and\nemployer contributions, less expenses. Expenses, such as\nmanagement or administrative fees, can sometimes signif-\nicantly reduce the value of an account in a defined-\ncontribution plan.\n   As relevant here, petitioners argued that respondents\nviolated their fiduciary duties with respect to three mu-\ntual funds added to the Plan in 1999 and three mutual funds\nadded to the Plan in 2002. Petitioners argued that re-\nspondents acted imprudently by offering six higher priced\nretail-class mutual funds as Plan investments when mate-\nrially identical lower priced institutional-class mutual\nfunds were available (the lower price reflects lower admin-\nistrative costs). Specifically, petitioners claimed that a large\ninstitutional investor with billions of dollars, like the Plan,\ncan obtain materially identical lower priced institutional-\nclass mutual funds that are not available to a retail inves-\ntor. Petitioners asked, how could respondents have acted\nprudently in offering the six higher priced retail-class\nmutual funds when respondents could have offered them\neffectively the same six mutual funds at the lower price\noffered to institutional investors like the Plan?\n   As to the three funds added to the Plan in 2002, the\nDistrict Court agreed. It wrote that respondents had \u201cnot\noffered any credible explanation\u201d for offering retail-class,\ni.e., higher priced mutual funds that \u201ccost the Plan partic-\nipants wholly unnecessary [administrative] fees,\u201d and it\nconcluded that, with respect to those mutual funds, re-\nspondents had failed to exercise \u201cthe care, skill, prudence\nand diligence under the circumstances\u201d that ERISA de-\nmands of fiduciaries. No. CV 07\u20135359 (CD Cal., July 8,\n2010), App. to Pet. for Cert. 65, 130, 142, 109.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   As to the three funds added to the Plan in 1999, how-\never, the District Court held that petitioners\u2019 claims were\nuntimely because, unlike the other contested mutual\nfunds, these mutual funds were included in the Plan more\nthan six years before the complaint was filed in 2007. 639\nF. Supp. 2d 1074, 1119\u20131120 (CD Cal. 2009). As a result,\nthe 6-year statutory period had run.\n   The District Court allowed petitioners to argue that,\ndespite the 1999 selection of the three mutual funds, their\ncomplaint was nevertheless timely because these funds\nunderwent significant changes within the 6-year statutory\nperiod that should have prompted respondents to undertake\na full due-diligence review and convert the higher priced\nretail-class mutual funds to lower priced institutional-\nclass mutual funds. App. to Pet. for Cert. 142\u2013150.\n   The District Court concluded, however, that petitioners\nhad not met their burden of showing that a prudent fidu-\nciary would have undertaken a full due-diligence review of\nthese funds as a result of the alleged changed circum-\nstances. According to the District Court, the circumstances\nhad not changed enough to place respondents under an\nobligation to review the mutual funds and to convert them\nto lower priced institutional-class mutual funds. Ibid.\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court as to the\nsix mutual funds. 729 F. 3d 1110 (2013). With respect to\nthe three mutual funds added in 1999, the Ninth Circuit\nheld that petitioners\u2019 claims were untimely because peti-\ntioners had not established a change in circumstances that\nmight trigger an obligation to review and to change in-\nvestments within the 6-year statutory period. Petitioners\nfiled a petition for certiorari asking us to review this latter\nholding. We agreed to do so.\n\n  Section 1113 reads, in relevant part, that \u201c[n]o action\nmay be commenced with respect to a fiduciary\u2019s breach of\nany responsibility, duty, or obligation\u201d after the earlier of\n4                  TIBBLE v. EDISON INT\u2019L\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201csix years after (A) the date of the last action which consti-\ntuted a part of the breach or violation, or (B) in the case of\nan omission the latest date on which the fiduciary could\nhave cured the breach or violation.\u201d Both clauses of that\nprovision require only a \u201cbreach or violation\u201d to start the\n6-year period.     Petitioners contend that respondents\nbreached the duty of prudence by offering higher priced\nretail-class mutual funds when the same investments\nwere available as lower priced institutional-class mutual\nfunds.\n   The Ninth Circuit, without considering the role of the\nfiduciary\u2019s duty of prudence under trust law, rejected\npetitioners\u2019 claims as untimely under \u00a71113 on the basis\nthat respondents had selected the three mutual funds\nmore than six years before petitioners brought this action.\nThe Ninth Circuit correctly asked whether the \u201clast action\nwhich constituted a part of the breach or violation\u201d of\nrespondents\u2019 duty of prudence occurred within the rele-\nvant 6-year period. It focused, however, upon the act of\n\u201cdesignating an investment for inclusion\u201d to start the 6-\nyear period. 729 F. 3d, at 1119. The Ninth Circuit stated\nthat \u201c[c]haracterizing the mere continued offering of a\nplan option, without more, as a subsequent breach would\nrender\u201d the statute meaningless and could even expose\npresent fiduciaries to liability for decisions made decades\nago. Id., at 1120. But the Ninth Circuit jumped from this\nobservation to the conclusion that only a significant\nchange in circumstances could engender a new breach of a\nfiduciary duty, stating that the District Court was \u201centirely\ncorrect\u201d to have entertained the \u201cpossibility\u201d that \u201csig-\nnificant changes\u201d occurring \u201cwithin the limitations period\u201d\nmight require \u201c \u2018a full due diligence review of the funds,\u2019 \u201d\nequivalent to the diligence review that respondents con-\nduct when adding new funds to the Plan. Ibid.\n\n    We believe the Ninth Circuit erred by applying a statu-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntory bar to a claim of a \u201cbreach or violation\u201d of a fiduciary\nduty without considering the nature of the fiduciary duty.\nThe Ninth Circuit did not recognize that under trust law a\nfiduciary is required to conduct a regular review of its\ninvestment with the nature and timing of the review\ncontingent on the circumstances. Of course, after the\nNinth Circuit considers trust-law principles, it is possible\nthat it will conclude that respondents did indeed conduct\nthe sort of review that a prudent fiduciary would have\nconducted absent a significant change in circumstances.\n   An ERISA fiduciary must discharge his responsibility\n\u201cwith the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\u201d that a pru-\ndent person \u201cacting in a like capacity and familiar with\nsuch matters\u201d would use. \u00a71104(a)(1); see also Fifth Third\nBancorp v. Dudenhoeffer, 573 U. S. ___ (2014). We have\noften noted that an ERISA fiduciary\u2019s duty is \u201cderived\nfrom the common law of trusts.\u201d Central States, Southeast\n& Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport,\nInc., 472 U. S. 559, 570 (1985). In determining the con-\ntours of an ERISA fiduciary\u2019s duty, courts often must look\nto the law of trusts. We are aware of no reason why the\nNinth Circuit should not do so here.\n   Under trust law, a trustee has a continuing duty to\nmonitor trust investments and remove imprudent ones.\nThis continuing duty exists separate and apart from the\ntrustee\u2019s duty to exercise prudence in selecting invest-\nments at the outset. The Bogert treatise states that \u201c[t]he\ntrustee cannot assume that if investments are legal and\nproper for retention at the beginning of the trust, or when\npurchased, they will remain so indefinitely.\u201d A. Hess, G.\nBogert, & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7684, pp.\n145\u2013146 (3d ed. 2009) (Bogert 3d). Rather, the trustee\nmust \u201csystematic[ally] conside[r] all the investments of the\ntrust at regular intervals\u201d to ensure that they are appro-\npriate. Bogert 3d \u00a7684, at 147\u2013148; see also In re Stark\u2019s\nEstate, 15 N. Y. S. 729, 731 (Surr. Ct. 1891) (stating that a\n6                  TIBBLE v. EDISON INT\u2019L\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrustee must \u201cexercis[e] a reasonable degree of diligence in\nlooking after the security after the investment had been\nmade\u201d); Johns v. Herbert, 2 App. D. C. 485, 499 (1894)\n(holding trustee liable for failure to discharge his \u201cduty to\nwatch the investment with reasonable care and dili-\ngence\u201d). The Restatement (Third) of Trusts states the\nfollowing:\n    \u201c[A] trustee\u2019s duties apply not only in making invest-\n    ments but also in monitoring and reviewing invest-\n    ments, which is to be done in a manner that is\n    reasonable and appropriate to the particular invest-\n    ments, courses of action, and strategies involved.\u201d \u00a790,\n    Comment b, p. 295 (2007).\nThe Uniform Prudent Investor Act confirms that\n\u201c[m]anaging embraces monitoring\u201d and that a trustee has\n\u201ccontinuing responsibility for oversight of the suitability of\nthe investments already made.\u201d \u00a72, Comment, 7B U. L. A.\n21 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Scott on\nTrusts implies as much by stating that, \u201c[w]hen the trust\nestate includes assets that are inappropriate as trust\ninvestments, the trustee is ordinarily under a duty to\ndispose of them within a reasonable time.\u201d 4 A. Scott, W.\nFratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and Ascher on Trusts\n\u00a719.3.1, p. 1439 (5th ed. 2007). Bogert says the same.\nBogert 3d \u00a7685, at 156\u2013157 (explaining that if an invest-\nment is determined to be imprudent, the trustee \u201cmust\ndispose of it within a reasonable time\u201d); see, e.g., State\nStreet Trust Co. v. DeKalb, 259 Mass. 578, 583, 157 N. E.\n334, 336 (1927) (trustee was required to take action to\n\u201cprotect the rights of the beneficiaries\u201d when the value of\ntrust assets declined).\n   In short, under trust law, a fiduciary normally has a\ncontinuing duty of some kind to monitor investments and\nremove imprudent ones. A plaintiff may allege that a\nfiduciary breached the duty of prudence by failing to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproperly monitor investments and remove imprudent\nones. In such a case, so long as the alleged breach of the\ncontinuing duty occurred within six years of suit, the\nclaim is timely. The Ninth Circuit erred by applying a 6-\nyear statutory bar based solely on the initial selection of\nthe three funds without considering the contours of the\nalleged breach of fiduciary duty.\n   The parties now agree that the duty of prudence in-\nvolves a continuing duty to monitor investments and\nremove imprudent ones under trust law. Brief for Peti-\ntioners 24 (\u201cTrust law imposes a duty to examine the\nprudence of existing investments periodically and to re-\nmove imprudent investments\u201d); Brief for Respondents 3\n(\u201cAll agree that a fiduciary has an ongoing duty to monitor\ntrust investments to ensure that they remain prudent\u201d);\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7 (\u201cThe duty of\nprudence under ERISA, as under trust law, requires plan\nfiduciaries with investment responsibility to examine\nperiodically the prudence of existing investments and to\nremove imprudent investments within a reasonable period\nof time\u201d). The parties disagree, however, with respect to\nthe scope of that responsibility. Did it require a review of\nthe contested mutual funds here, and if so, just what kind\nof review did it require? A fiduciary must discharge his\nresponsibilities \u201cwith the care, skill, prudence, and dili-\ngence\u201d that a prudent person \u201cacting in a like capacity and\nfamiliar with such matters\u201d would use. \u00a71104(a)(1). We\nexpress no view on the scope of respondents\u2019 fiduciary duty\nin this case. We remand for the Ninth Circuit to consider\npetitioners\u2019 claims that respondents breached their duties\nwithin the relevant 6-year period under \u00a71113, recognizing\nthe importance of analogous trust law.\n   A final point: Respondents argue that petitioners did not\nraise the claim below that respondents committed new\nbreaches of the duty of prudence by failing to monitor\ntheir investments and remove imprudent ones absent a\n8                  TIBBLE v. EDISON INT\u2019L\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsignificant change in circumstances. We leave any ques-\ntions of forfeiture for the Ninth Circuit on remand. The\nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment is vacated, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n",

Argued February 24, 2015\u2014Decided May 18, 2015\nIn 2007, petitioners, beneficiaries of the Edison 401(k) Savings Plan\n  (Plan), sued Plan fiduciaries, respondents Edison International and\n  others, to recover damages for alleged losses suffered by the Plan\n  from alleged breaches of respondents\u2019 fiduciary duties. As relevant\n  here, petitioners argued that respondents violated their fiduciary du-\n  ties with respect to three mutual funds added to the Plan in 1999 and\n  three mutual funds added to the Plan in 2002. Petitioners argued\n  that respondents acted imprudently by offering six higher priced re-\n  tail-class mutual funds as Plan investments when materially identi-\n  cal lower priced institutional-class mutual funds were available. Be-\n  cause ERISA requires a breach of fiduciary duty complaint to be filed\n  no more than six years after \u201cthe date of the last action which consti-\n  tutes a part of the breach or violation\u201d or \u201cin the case of an omission\n  the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or\n  violation,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a71113, the District Court held that petitioners\u2019\n  complaint as to the 1999 funds was untimely because they were in-\n  cluded in the Plan more than six years before the complaint was\n  filed, and the circumstances had not changed enough within the 6-\n  year statutory period to place respondents under an obligation to re-\n  view the mutual funds and to convert them to lower priced institu-\n  tional-class funds. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that peti-\n  tioners had not established a change in circumstances that might\n  trigger an obligation to conduct a full due diligence review of the\n  1999 funds within the 6-year statutory period.\nHeld: The Ninth Circuit erred by applying \u00a71113\u2019s statutory bar to a\n breach of fiduciary duty claim based on the initial selection of the in-\n vestments without considering the contours of the alleged breach of\n fiduciary duty. ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duty is \u201cderived from the common\n2                       TIBBLE v. EDISON INT\u2019L\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    law of trusts,\u201d Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension\n    Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559, 570, which provides\n    that a trustee has a continuing duty\u2014separate and apart from the\n    duty to exercise prudence in selecting investments at the outset\u2014to\n    monitor, and remove imprudent, trust investments. So long as a\n    plaintiff\u2019s claim alleging breach of the continuing duty of prudence\n    occurred within six years of suit, the claim is timely. This Court ex-\n    presses no view on the scope of respondents\u2019 fiduciary duty in this\n    case, e.g., whether a review of the contested mutual funds is required,\n    and, if so, just what kind of review. A fiduciary must discharge his\n    responsibilities \u201cwith the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\u201d that a\n    prudent person \u201cacting in a like capacity and familiar with such mat-\n    ters\u201d would use. \u00a71104(a)(1). The case is remanded for the Ninth\n    Circuit to consider petitioners\u2019 claims that respondents breached\n    their duties within the relevant 6-year statutory period under \u00a71113,\n    recognizing the importance of analogous trust law.

S. C. \u00a71113. The\nquestion before us concerns application of this provision to\nthe timeliness of a fiduciary duty complaint. It requires\nus to consider whether a fiduciary\u2019s allegedly imprudent\nretention of an investment is an \u201caction\u201d or \u201comission\u201d that\ntriggers the running of the 6-year limitations period.\n\n   In 2007, several individual beneficiaries of the Edison\n401(k) Savings Plan (Plan) filed a lawsuit on behalf of the\nPlan and all similarly situated beneficiaries (collectively,\npetitioners) against Edison International and others (col-\nlectively, respondents). Petitioners sought to recover\ndamages for alleged losses suffered by the Plan, in addi-\ntion to injunctive and other equitable relief based on al-\n2                   TIBBLE v. EDISON INT\u2019L\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nleged breaches of respondents\u2019 fiduciary duties.\n   The Plan is a defined-contribution plan, meaning that\nparticipants\u2019 retirement benefits are limited to the value\nof their own individual investment accounts, which is\ndetermined by the market performance of employee and\nemployer contributions, less expenses. Expenses, such as\nmanagement or administrative fees, can sometimes signif-\nicantly reduce the value of an account in a defined-\ncontribution plan.\n   As relevant here, petitioners argued that respondents\nviolated their fiduciary duties with respect to three mu-\ntual funds added to the Plan in 1999 and three mutual funds\nadded to the Plan in 2002. Petitioners argued that re-\nspondents acted imprudently by offering six higher priced\nretail-class mutual funds as Plan investments when mate-\nrially identical lower priced institutional-class mutual\nfunds were available (the lower price reflects lower admin-\nistrative costs). Specifically, petitioners claimed that a large\ninstitutional investor with billions of dollars, like the Plan,\ncan obtain materially identical lower priced institutional-\nclass mutual funds that are not available to a retail inves-\ntor. Petitioners asked, how could respondents have acted\nprudently in offering the six higher priced retail-class\nmutual funds when respondents could have offered them\neffectively the same six mutual funds at the lower price\noffered to institutional investors like the Plan?\n   As to the three funds added to the Plan in 2002, the\nDistrict Court agreed. It wrote that respondents had \u201cnot\noffered any credible explanation\u201d for offering retail-class,\ni.e., higher priced mutual funds that \u201ccost the Plan partic-\nipants wholly unnecessary [administrative] fees,\u201d and it\nconcluded that, with respect to those mutual funds, re-\nspondents had failed to exercise \u201cthe care, skill, prudence\nand diligence under the circumstances\u201d that ERISA de-\nmands of fiduciaries.

As a result,\nthe 6-year statutory period had run.\n   The District Court allowed petitioners to argue that,\ndespite the 1999 selection of the three mutual funds, their\ncomplaint was nevertheless timely because these funds\nunderwent significant changes within the 6-year statutory\nperiod that should have prompted respondents to undertake\na full due-diligence review and convert the higher priced\nretail-class mutual funds to lower priced institutional-\nclass mutual funds. App. to Pet. for Cert. 142\u2013150.\n   The District Court concluded, however, that petitioners\nhad not met their burden of showing that a prudent fidu-\nciary would have undertaken a full due-diligence review of\nthese funds as a result of the alleged changed circum-\nstances. According to the District Court, the circumstances\nhad not changed enough to place respondents under an\nobligation to review the mutual funds and to convert them\nto lower priced institutional-class mutual funds. Ibid.\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court as to the\nsix mutual funds. 729 F. 3d 1110 (2013). With respect to\nthe three mutual funds added in 1999, the Ninth Circuit\nheld that petitioners\u2019 claims were untimely because peti-\ntioners had not established a change in circumstances that\nmight trigger an obligation to review and to change in-\nvestments within the 6-year statutory period. Petitioners\nfiled a petition for certiorari asking us to review this latter\nholding. We agreed to do so.\n\n  Section 1113 reads, in relevant part, that \u201c[n]o action\nmay be commenced with respect to a fiduciary\u2019s breach of\nany responsibility, duty, or obligation\u201d after the earlier of\n4                  TIBBLE v. EDISON INT\u2019L\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201csix years after (A) the date of the last action which consti-\ntuted a part of the breach or violation, or (B) in the case of\nan omission the latest date on which the fiduciary could\nhave cured the breach or violation.\u201d Both clauses of that\nprovision require only a \u201cbreach or violation\u201d to start the\n6-year period.     Petitioners contend that respondents\nbreached the duty of prudence by offering higher priced\nretail-class mutual funds when the same investments\nwere available as lower priced institutional-class mutual\nfunds.\n   The Ninth Circuit, without considering the role of the\nfiduciary\u2019s duty of prudence under trust law, rejected\npetitioners\u2019 claims as untimely under \u00a71113 on the basis\nthat respondents had selected the three mutual funds\nmore than six years before petitioners brought this action.\nThe Ninth Circuit correctly asked whether the \u201clast action\nwhich constituted a part of the breach or violation\u201d of\nrespondents\u2019 duty of prudence occurred within the rele-\nvant 6-year period. It focused, however, upon the act of\n\u201cdesignating an investment for inclusion\u201d to start the 6-\nyear period. 729 F. 3d, at 1119. The Ninth Circuit stated\nthat \u201c[c]haracterizing the mere continued offering of a\nplan option, without more, as a subsequent breach would\nrender\u201d the statute meaningless and could even expose\npresent fiduciaries to liability for decisions made decades\nago. Id., at 1120. But the Ninth Circuit jumped from this\nobservation to the conclusion that only a significant\nchange in circumstances could engender a new breach of a\nfiduciary duty, stating that the District Court was \u201centirely\ncorrect\u201d to have entertained the \u201cpossibility\u201d that \u201csig-\nnificant changes\u201d occurring \u201cwithin the limitations period\u201d\nmight require \u201c \u2018a full due diligence review of the funds,\u2019 \u201d\nequivalent to the diligence review that respondents con-\nduct when adding new funds to the Plan. Ibid.\n\n    We believe the Ninth Circuit erred by applying a statu-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntory bar to a claim of a \u201cbreach or violation\u201d of a fiduciary\nduty without considering the nature of the fiduciary duty.\nThe Ninth Circuit did not recognize that under trust law a\nfiduciary is required to conduct a regular review of its\ninvestment with the nature and timing of the review\ncontingent on the circumstances. Of course, after the\nNinth Circuit considers trust-law principles, it is possible\nthat it will conclude that respondents did indeed conduct\nthe sort of review that a prudent fiduciary would have\nconducted absent a significant change in circumstances.\n   An ERISA fiduciary must discharge his responsibility\n\u201cwith the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\u201d that a pru-\ndent person \u201cacting in a like capacity and familiar with\nsuch matters\u201d would use. \u00a71104(a)(1); see also Fifth Third\nBancorp v. Dudenhoeffer, 573 U. S. ___ (2014). We have\noften noted that an ERISA fiduciary\u2019s duty is \u201cderived\nfrom the common law of trusts.\u201d Central States, Southeast\n& Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport,\nInc., 472 U. S. 559, 570 (1985). In determining the con-\ntours of an ERISA fiduciary\u2019s duty, courts often must look\nto the law of trusts. We are aware of no reason why the\nNinth Circuit should not do so here.\n   Under trust law, a trustee has a continuing duty to\nmonitor trust investments and remove imprudent ones.\nThis continuing duty exists separate and apart from the\ntrustee\u2019s duty to exercise prudence in selecting invest-\nments at the outset. The Bogert treatise states that \u201c[t]he\ntrustee cannot assume that if investments are legal and\nproper for retention at the beginning of the trust, or when\npurchased, they will remain so indefinitely.\u201d A. Hess, G.\nBogert, & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7684, pp.\n145\u2013146 (3d ed. 2009) (Bogert 3d). Rather, the trustee\nmust \u201csystematic[ally] conside[r] all the investments of the\ntrust at regular intervals\u201d to ensure that they are appro-\npriate. Bogert 3d \u00a7684, at 147\u2013148; see also In re Stark\u2019s\nEstate, 15 N. Y. S. 729, 731 (Surr. Ct. 1891) (stating that a\n6                  TIBBLE v. EDISON INT\u2019L\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrustee must \u201cexercis[e] a reasonable degree of diligence in\nlooking after the security after the investment had been\nmade\u201d); Johns v. Herbert, 2 App. D. C. 485, 499 (1894)\n(holding trustee liable for failure to discharge his \u201cduty to\nwatch the investment with reasonable care and dili-\ngence\u201d). The Restatement (Third) of Trusts states the\nfollowing:\n    \u201c[A] trustee\u2019s duties apply not only in making invest-\n    ments but also in monitoring and reviewing invest-\n    ments, which is to be done in a manner that is\n    reasonable and appropriate to the particular invest-\n    ments, courses of action, and strategies involved.\u201d \u00a790,\n    Comment b, p. 295 (2007).\nThe Uniform Prudent Investor Act confirms that\n\u201c[m]anaging embraces monitoring\u201d and that a trustee has\n\u201ccontinuing responsibility for oversight of the suitability of\nthe investments already made.\u201d \u00a72, Comment, 7B U. L. A.\n21 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Scott on\nTrusts implies as much by stating that, \u201c[w]hen the trust\nestate includes assets that are inappropriate as trust\ninvestments, the trustee is ordinarily under a duty to\ndispose of them within a reasonable time.\u201d 4 A. Scott, W.\nFratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and Ascher on Trusts\n\u00a719.3.1, p. 1439 (5th ed. 2007). Bogert says the same.\nBogert 3d \u00a7685, at 156\u2013157 (explaining that if an invest-\nment is determined to be imprudent, the trustee \u201cmust\ndispose of it within a reasonable time\u201d); see, e.g., State\nStreet Trust Co. v. DeKalb, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583, 157 N. E.\n334, 336 (1927) (trustee was required to take action to\n\u201cprotect the rights of the beneficiaries\u201d when the value of\ntrust assets declined).\n   In short, under trust law, a fiduciary normally has a\ncontinuing duty of some kind to monitor investments and\nremove imprudent ones. A plaintiff may allege that a\nfiduciary breached the duty of prudence by failing to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproperly monitor investments and remove imprudent\nones. In such a case, so long as the alleged breach of the\ncontinuing duty occurred within six years of suit, the\nclaim is timely. The Ninth Circuit erred by applying a 6-\nyear statutory bar based solely on the initial selection of\nthe three funds without considering the contours of the\nalleged breach of fiduciary duty.\n   The parties now agree that the duty of prudence in-\nvolves a continuing duty to monitor investments and\nremove imprudent ones under trust law. Brief for Peti-\ntioners 24 (\u201cTrust law imposes a duty to examine the\nprudence of existing investments periodically and to re-\nmove imprudent investments\u201d); Brief for Respondents 3\n(\u201cAll agree that a fiduciary has an ongoing duty to monitor\ntrust investments to ensure that they remain prudent\u201d);\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7 (\u201cThe duty of\nprudence under ERISA, as under trust law, requires plan\nfiduciaries with investment responsibility to examine\nperiodically the prudence of existing investments and to\nremove imprudent investments within a reasonable period\nof time\u201d). The parties disagree, however, with respect to\nthe scope of that responsibility. Did it require a review of\nthe contested mutual funds here, and if so, just what kind\nof review did it require? A fiduciary must discharge his\nresponsibilities \u201cwith the care, skill, prudence, and dili-\ngence\u201d that a prudent person \u201cacting in a like capacity and\nfamiliar with such matters\u201d would use. \u00a71104(a)(1). We\nexpress no view on the scope of respondents\u2019 fiduciary duty\nin this case. We remand for the Ninth Circuit to consider\npetitioners\u2019 claims that respondents breached their duties\nwithin the relevant 6-year period under \u00a71113, recognizing\nthe importance of analogous trust law.\n   A final point: Respondents argue that petitioners did not\nraise the claim below that respondents committed new\nbreaches of the duty of prudence by failing to monitor\ntheir investments and remove imprudent ones absent a\n8                  TIBBLE v. EDISON INT\u2019L\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsignificant change in circumstances. We leave any ques-\ntions of forfeiture for the Ninth Circuit on remand. The\nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment is vacated, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
