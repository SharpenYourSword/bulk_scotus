UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 13–1487. Argued February 24, 2015—Decided May 18, 2015\nAfter being charged with the felony offense of distributing marijuana,\n  petitioner Tony Henderson was required as a condition of his bail to\n  turn over firearms that he lawfully owned. Henderson ultimately\n  pleaded guilty, and, as a felon, was prohibited under 18 U. S. C.\n  §922(g) from possessing his (or any other) firearms. Henderson\n  therefore asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which had cus-\n  tody of his firearms, to transfer them to his friend. But the agency\n  refused to do so. Henderson then filed a motion in federal district\n  court seeking to transfer his firearms, but the court denied the mo-\n  tion on the ground that Henderson’s requested transfer would give\n  him constructive possession of the firearms in violation of §922(g).\n  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A court-ordered transfer of a felon’s lawfully owned firearms from\n Government custody to a third party is not barred by §922(g) if the\n court is satisfied that the recipient will not give the felon control over\n the firearms, so that he could either use them or direct their use.\n Federal courts have equitable authority to order law enforcement to\n return property obtained during the course of a criminal proceeding\n to its rightful owner. Section 922(g), however, bars a court from or-\n dering guns returned to a felon-owner like Henderson, because that\n would place the owner in violation of the law. And because §922(g)\n bans constructive as well as actual possession, it also prevents a\n court from ordering the transfer of a felon’s guns to someone willing\n to give the felon access to them or to accede to the felon’s instructions\n about their future use.\n    The Government goes further, arguing that §922(g) prevents all\n transfers to a third party, no matter how independent of the felon’s\n influence, unless that recipient is a licensed firearms dealer or other\n2                   HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    third party who will sell the guns on the open market. But that view\n    conflates possession, which §922(g) prohibits, with an owner’s right\n    merely to alienate his property, which it does not. After all, the Gov-\n    ernment’s reading of §922(g) would prohibit a felon from disposing of\n    his firearms even when he would lack any control over and thus not\n    possess them before, during, or after the disposition. That reading\n    would also extend §922(g)’s scope far beyond its purpose; preventing\n    a felon like Henderson from disposing of his firearms, even in ways\n    that guarantee he never uses them again, does nothing to advance\n    the statute’s goal of keeping firearms away from felons. Finally, the\n    Government’s insistence that a felon cannot select a third-party re-\n    cipient over whom he exercises no influence fits poorly with its con-\n    cession that a felon may select a firearms dealer or third party to sell\n    his guns. The Government’s reading of §922(g) is thus overbroad.\n       Accordingly, a court may approve the transfer of a felon’s guns con-\n    sistently with §922(g) if, but only if, the recipient will not grant the\n    felon control over those weapons. One way to ensure that result is to\n    order that the guns be turned over to a firearms dealer, himself inde-\n    pendent of the felon’s control, for subsequent sale on the open mar-\n    ket. But that is not the only option; a court, with proper assurances\n    from the recipient, may also grant a felon’s request to transfer his\n    guns to a person who expects to maintain custody of them. Either\n    way, once a court is satisfied that the transferee will not allow the\n    felon to exert any influence over the firearms, the court has equitable\n    power to accommodate the felon’s transfer request.

If convicted, such a person cannot re-\ncover his guns because a federal statute, 18 U. S. C.\n§922(g), prohibits any felon from possessing firearms. In\nthis case, we consider what §922(g) allows a court to do\nwhen a felon instead seeks the transfer of his guns to\neither a firearms dealer (for future sale on the open mar-\nket) or some other third party. We hold that §922(g) does\nnot bar such a transfer unless it would allow the felon to\nlater control the guns, so that he could either use them or\ndirect their use.\n                            I\n  The Federal Government charged petitioner Tony Hen-\nderson, then a U. S. Border Patrol agent, with the felony\noffense of distributing marijuana.    See 21 U. S. C.\n§§841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D). A Magistrate Judge required that\nHenderson surrender all his firearms as a condition of his\nrelease on bail. Henderson complied, and the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI) took custody of the guns.\n2                 HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSoon afterward, Henderson pleaded guilty to the distribu-\ntion charge; as a result of that conviction, §922(g) prevents\nhim from legally repossessing his firearms.\n   Following his release from prison, Henderson asked the\nFBI to transfer the guns to Robert Rosier, a friend who\nhad agreed to purchase them for an unspecified price. The\nFBI denied the request. In a letter to Henderson, it ex-\nplained that “the release of the firearms to [Rosier] would\nplace you in violation of [§922(g)], as it would amount to\nconstructive possession” of the guns. App. 121.\n   Henderson then returned to the court that had handled\nhis criminal case to seek release of his firearms. Invoking\nthe court’s equitable powers, Henderson asked for an\norder directing the FBI to transfer the guns either to his\nwife or to Rosier. The District Court denied the motion,\nconcluding (as the FBI had) that Henderson could not\n“transfer the firearms or receive money from their sale”\nwithout “constructive[ly] possessi[ng]” them in violation of\n§922(g). No. 3:06–cr–211 (MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2012), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 5a–6a, 12a. The Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit affirmed on the same ground, reasoning\nthat granting Henderson’s motion would amount to giving\na felon “constructive possession” of his firearms. 555 Fed.\nAppx. 851, 853 (2014) (per curiam).1\n——————\n   1 The Court of Appeals added that Henderson’s “equitable argument\n\nrings hollow” because a convicted felon has “unclean hands to demand\nreturn [or transfer] of his firearms.” 555 Fed. Appx., at 854. That view\nis wrong, as all parties now agree. See Brief for Petitioner 35–39; Brief\nfor United States 31, n. 8; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 42. The unclean hands\ndoctrine proscribes equitable relief when, but only when, an individ-\nual’s misconduct has “immediate and necessary relation to the equity\nthat he seeks.” Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., 290 U. S.\n240, 245 (1933). The doctrine might apply, for example, if a felon\nrequests the return or transfer of property used in furtherance of his\noffense. See, e.g., United States v. Kaczynski, 551 F. 3d 1120, 1129–\n1130 (CA9 2009) (holding that the Unabomber had unclean hands to\nrequest the return of bomb-making materials). But Henderson’s felony\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We granted certiorari, 574 U. S. ___ (2014), to resolve a\ncircuit split over whether, as the courts below held,\n§922(g) categorically prohibits a court from approving a\nconvicted felon’s request to transfer his firearms to an-\nother person.2 We now vacate the decision below.\n                              II\n   A federal court has equitable authority, even after a\ncriminal proceeding has ended, to order a law enforcement\nagency to turn over property it has obtained during the\ncase to the rightful owner or his designee. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Martinez, 241 F. 3d 1329, 1330–1331 (CA11\n2001) (citing numerous appellate decisions to that effect);\nTr. of Oral Arg. 41 (Solicitor General agreeing). Congress,\nhowever, may cabin that power in various ways. As rele-\nvant here, §922(g) makes it unlawful for any person con-\nvicted of a felony to “possess in or affecting commerce[ ]\nany firearm or ammunition.” That provision prevents a\ncourt from instructing an agency to return guns in its\ncustody to a felon-owner like Henderson, because that\nwould place him in violation of the law. The question here\nis how §922(g) affects a court’s authority to instead direct\nthe transfer of such firearms to a third party.\n   Section 922(g) proscribes possession alone, but covers\npossession in every form. By its terms, §922(g) does not\nprohibit a felon from owning firearms. Rather, it inter-\nferes with a single incident of ownership—one of the pro-\nverbial sticks in the bundle of property rights—by pre-\n\n——————\nconviction had nothing to do with his firearms, so the unclean hands\nrule has no role to play here.\n  2 Compare 555 Fed. Appx. 851, 853–854 (CA11 2014) (per curiam)\n\n(case below) (holding that §922(g) bars any transfer); United States v.\nFelici, 208 F. 3d 667, 670 (CA8 2000) (same), with United States v.\nZaleski, 686 F. 3d 90, 92–94 (CA2 2012) (holding that §922(g) permits\nsome transfers); United States v. Miller, 588 F. 3d 418, 419–420 (CA7\n2009) (same).\n4              HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nventing the felon from knowingly possessing his (or an-\nother person’s) guns. But that stick is a thick one, encom-\npassing what the criminal law recognizes as “actual” and\n“constructive” possession alike. 2A K. O’Malley, J. Grenig,\n& W. Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Crimi-\nnal §39.12, p. 55 (6th ed. 2009) (hereinafter O’Malley); see\nNational Safe Deposit Co. v. Stead, 232 U. S. 58, 67 (1914)\n(noting that in “legal terminology” the word “possession” is\n“interchangeably used to describe” both the actual and the\nconstructive kinds). Actual possession exists when a\nperson has direct physical control over a thing. See\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1047 (5th ed. 1979) (hereinafter\nBlack’s); 2A O’Malley §39.12, at 55. Constructive posses-\nsion is established when a person, though lacking such\nphysical custody, still has the power and intent to exercise\ncontrol over the object. See Black’s 1047; 2A O’Malley\n§39.12, at 55. Section 922(g) thus prevents a felon not\nonly from holding his firearms himself but also from main-\ntaining control over those guns in the hands of others.\n  That means, as all parties agree, that §922(g) prevents a\ncourt from ordering the sale or other transfer of a felon’s\nguns to someone willing to give the felon access to them or\nto accede to the felon’s instructions about their future use.\nSee Brief for United States 23; Reply Brief 12. In such a\ncase, the felon would have control over the guns, even\nwhile another person kept physical custody. The idea of\nconstructive possession is designed to preclude just that\nresult, “allow[ing] the law to reach beyond puppets to\npuppeteers.” United States v. Al-Rekabi, 454 F. 3d 1113,\n1118 (CA10 2006). A felon cannot evade the strictures of\n§922(g) by arranging a sham transfer that leaves him in\neffective control of his guns. And because that is so, a\ncourt may no more approve such a transfer than order the\nreturn of the firearms to the felon himself.\n  The Government argues that §922(g) prohibits still\nmore—that it bars a felon, except in one circumstance,\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom transferring his firearms to another person, no mat-\nter how independent of the felon’s influence. According to\nthe Government, a felon “exercises his right to control” his\nfirearms, and thus violates §922(g)’s broad ban on posses-\nsion, merely by “select[ing] the[ir] first recipient,” because\nthat choice “determine[s] who [will] (and who [will] not)\nnext have access to the firearms.” Brief for United States\n24. And that remains so even if a felon never retakes\nphysical custody of the guns and needs a court order to\napprove and effectuate the proposed transfer. The felon\n(so says the Government) still exerts enough sway over the\nguns’ disposition to “have constructive possession” of\nthem. Id., at 25. The only time that is not true, the Gov-\nernment claims, is when a felon asks the court to transfer\nthe guns to a licensed dealer or other party who will sell\nthe guns for him on the open market. See id., at 20–22;\nTr. of Oral Arg. 18–21. Because the felon then does not\ncontrol the firearms’ final destination, the Government\navers, he does not constructively possess them and a court\nmay approve the transfer. See ibid.\n   But the Government’s theory wrongly conflates the right\nto possess a gun with another incident of ownership,\nwhich §922(g) does not affect: the right merely to sell or\notherwise dispose of that item. Cf. Andrus v. Allard, 444\nU. S. 51, 65–66 (1979) (distinguishing between entitle-\nments to possess and sell property). Consider the scenario\nthat the Government claims would violate §922(g). The\nfelon has nothing to do with his guns before, during, or\nafter the transaction in question, except to nominate their\nrecipient. Prior to the transfer, the guns sit in an evidence\nvault, under the sole custody of law enforcement officers.\nAssuming the court approves the proposed recipient, FBI\nagents handle the firearms’ physical conveyance, without\nthe felon’s participation. Afterward, the purchaser or\nother custodian denies the felon any access to or influence\nover the guns; the recipient alone decides where to store\n6                HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthem, when to loan them out, how to use them, and so on.\nIn short, the arrangement serves only to divest the felon of\nhis firearms—and even that much depends on a court’s\napproving the designee’s fitness and ordering the transfer\nto go forward. Such a felon exercises not a possessory\ninterest (whether directly or through another), but instead\na naked right of alienation—the capacity to sell or transfer\nhis guns, unaccompanied by any control over them.3\n   The Government’s view of what counts as “possession”\nwould also extend §922(g)’s scope far beyond its purpose.\nCongress enacted that ban to keep firearms away from\nfelons like Henderson, for fear that they would use those\nguns irresponsibly. See Small v. United States, 544 U. S.\n385, 393 (2005). Yet on the Government’s construction,\n§922(g) would prevent Henderson from disposing of his\nfirearms even in ways that guarantee he never uses them\nagain, solely because he played a part in selecting their\n——————\n   3 The Government calls our attention to several cases in which courts\n\nhave found constructive possession of firearms based on evidence that a\nfelon negotiated and arranged a sale of guns while using a third party\nto make the physical handoff to the buyer. See, e.g., United States v.\nNungaray, 697 F. 3d 1114, 1116–1119 (CA9 2012); United States v.\nVirciglio, 441 F. 2d 1295, 1297–1298 (CA5 1971). But the facts in the\ncited cases bear no similarity to those here. In each, the defendant-\nfelon controlled the guns’ movement both before and during the trans-\naction at issue (and even was present at the delivery site). As the\nGovernment explains, the felon could “make a gun appear” at the time\nand place of his choosing and decide what would happen to it once it got\nthere. Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. Indeed, he could have chosen to take the\nfirearms for himself or direct them to someone under his influence. The\nfelon’s management of the sale thus exemplified, and served as evi-\ndence of, his broader command over the guns’ location and use—the\nvery hallmark of possession. But as just explained, that kind of control\nis absent when a felon can do no more than nominate an independent\nrecipient for firearms in a federal agency’s custody. The decisions the\nGovernment invokes thus have no bearing on this case; nor does our\ndecision here, which addresses only §922(g)’s application to court-\nsupervised transfers of guns, prevent the Government from bringing\ncharges under §922(g) in cases resembling those cited.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntransferee. He could not, for example, place those guns in\na secure trust for distribution to his children after his\ndeath. He could not sell them to someone halfway around\nthe world. He could not even donate them to a law en-\nforcement agency. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. Results of that\nkind would do nothing to advance §922(g)’s purpose.\n   Finally, the Government’s expansive idea of constructive\npossession fits poorly with its concession that a felon in\nHenderson’s position may select a firearms dealer or other\nthird party to sell his guns and give him the proceeds.\nAfter all, the felon chooses the guns’ “first recipient” in\nthat case too, deciding who “next ha[s] access to the fire-\narms.” Brief for United States 24; see supra, at 5. If (as\nthe Government argues) that is all it takes to exercise\ncontrol over and thus constructively possess an item, then\n(contrary to the Government’s view) the felon would vio-\nlate §922(g) merely by selecting a dealer to sell his guns.\nTo be sure, that person will predictably convey the fire-\narms to someone whom the felon does not know and can-\nnot control: That is why the Government, as a practical\nmatter, has no worries about the transfer. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 19–21. But that fact merely demonstrates how the\nGovernment’s view of §922(g) errs in its focus in a case\nlike this one. What matters here is not whether a felon\nplays a role in deciding where his firearms should go next:\nThat test would logically prohibit a transfer even when\nthe chosen recipient will later sell the guns to someone\nelse. What matters instead is whether the felon will have\nthe ability to use or direct the use of his firearms after\nthe transfer. That is what gives the felon constructive\npossession.\n   Accordingly, a court facing a motion like Henderson’s\nmay approve the transfer of guns consistently with §922(g)\nif, but only if, that disposition prevents the felon from\nlater exercising control over those weapons, so that he\ncould either use them or tell someone else how to do so.\n8              HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOne way to ensure that result, as the Government notes,\nis to order that the guns be turned over to a firearms\ndealer, himself independent of the felon’s control, for\nsubsequent sale on the open market. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Zaleski, 686 F. 3d 90, 92–94 (CA2 2012). Indeed,\nwe can see no reason, absent exceptional circumstances, to\ndisapprove a felon’s motion for such a sale, whether or not\nhe has picked the vendor. That option, however, is not the\nonly one available under §922(g). A court may also grant\na felon’s request to transfer his guns to a person who\nexpects to maintain custody of them, so long as the recipi-\nent will not allow the felon to exert any influence over\ntheir use. In considering such a motion, the court may\nproperly seek certain assurances: for example, it may ask\nthe proposed transferee to promise to keep the guns away\nfrom the felon, and to acknowledge that allowing him to\nuse them would aid and abet a §922(g) violation. See id.,\nat 94; United States v. Miller, 588 F. 3d 418, 420 (CA7\n2009). Even such a pledge, of course, might fail to provide\nan adequate safeguard, and a court should then disap-\nprove the transfer. See, e.g., State v. Fadness, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"890254\"><a href=\"/opinion/890254/state-v-fadness/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341–342, 268 P. 3d 17, 30 (2012) (upholding a trial\ncourt’s finding that the assurances given by a felon’s par-\nents were not credible). But when a court is satisfied that\na felon will not retain control over his guns, §922(g) does\nnot apply, and the court has equitable power to accommo-\ndate the felon’s request.\n   Neither of the courts below assessed Henderson’s mo-\ntion for a transfer of his firearms in accord with these\nprinciples. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 2801431, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/05/18/henderson_v._united_states.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued February 24, 2015—Decided May 18, 2015\nAfter being charged with the felony offense of distributing marijuana,\n  petitioner Tony Henderson was required as a condition of his bail to\n  turn over firearms that he lawfully owned. Henderson ultimately\n  pleaded guilty, and, as a felon, was prohibited under 18 U. S. C.\n  §922(g) from possessing his (or any other) firearms. Henderson\n  therefore asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which had cus-\n  tody of his firearms, to transfer them to his friend. But the agency\n  refused to do so. Henderson then filed a motion in federal district\n  court seeking to transfer his firearms, but the court denied the mo-\n  tion on the ground that Henderson’s requested transfer would give\n  him constructive possession of the firearms in violation of §922(g).\n  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A court-ordered transfer of a felon’s lawfully owned firearms from\n Government custody to a third party is not barred by §922(g) if the\n court is satisfied that the recipient will not give the felon control over\n the firearms, so that he could either use them or direct their use.\n Federal courts have equitable authority to order law enforcement to\n return property obtained during the course of a criminal proceeding\n to its rightful owner. Section 922(g), however, bars a court from or-\n dering guns returned to a felon-owner like Henderson, because that\n would place the owner in violation of the law. And because §922(g)\n bans constructive as well as actual possession, it also prevents a\n court from ordering the transfer of a felon’s guns to someone willing\n to give the felon access to them or to accede to the felon’s instructions\n about their future use.\n    The Government goes further, arguing that §922(g) prevents all\n transfers to a third party, no matter how independent of the felon’s\n influence, unless that recipient is a licensed firearms dealer or other\n2                   HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    third party who will sell the guns on the open market. But that view\n    conflates possession, which §922(g) prohibits, with an owner’s right\n    merely to alienate his property, which it does not. After all, the Gov-\n    ernment’s reading of §922(g) would prohibit a felon from disposing of\n    his firearms even when he would lack any control over and thus not\n    possess them before, during, or after the disposition. That reading\n    would also extend §922(g)’s scope far beyond its purpose; preventing\n    a felon like Henderson from disposing of his firearms, even in ways\n    that guarantee he never uses them again, does nothing to advance\n    the statute’s goal of keeping firearms away from felons. Finally, the\n    Government’s insistence that a felon cannot select a third-party re-\n    cipient over whom he exercises no influence fits poorly with its con-\n    cession that a felon may select a firearms dealer or third party to sell\n    his guns. The Government’s reading of §922(g) is thus overbroad.\n       Accordingly, a court may approve the transfer of a felon’s guns con-\n    sistently with §922(g) if, but only if, the recipient will not grant the\n    felon control over those weapons. One way to ensure that result is to\n    order that the guns be turned over to a firearms dealer, himself inde-\n    pendent of the felon’s control, for subsequent sale on the open mar-\n    ket. But that is not the only option; a court, with proper assurances\n    from the recipient, may also grant a felon’s request to transfer his\n    guns to a person who expects to maintain custody of them. Either\n    way, once a court is satisfied that the transferee will not allow the\n    felon to exert any influence over the firearms, the court has equitable\n    power to accommodate the felon’s transfer request.

If convicted, such a person cannot re-\ncover his guns because a federal statute, 18 U. S. C.\n§922(g), prohibits any felon from possessing firearms. In\nthis case, we consider what §922(g) allows a court to do\nwhen a felon instead seeks the transfer of his guns to\neither a firearms dealer (for future sale on the open mar-\nket) or some other third party. We hold that §922(g) does\nnot bar such a transfer unless it would allow the felon to\nlater control the guns, so that he could either use them or\ndirect their use.\n                            I\n  The Federal Government charged petitioner Tony Hen-\nderson, then a U. S. Border Patrol agent, with the felony\noffense of distributing marijuana.    See 21 U. S. C.\n§§841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D). A Magistrate Judge required that\nHenderson surrender all his firearms as a condition of his\nrelease on bail. Henderson complied, and the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI) took custody of the guns.\n2                 HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSoon afterward, Henderson pleaded guilty to the distribu-\ntion charge; as a result of that conviction, §922(g) prevents\nhim from legally repossessing his firearms.\n   Following his release from prison, Henderson asked the\nFBI to transfer the guns to Robert Rosier, a friend who\nhad agreed to purchase them for an unspecified price. The\nFBI denied the request. In a letter to Henderson, it ex-\nplained that “the release of the firearms to [Rosier] would\nplace you in violation of [§922(g)], as it would amount to\nconstructive possession” of the guns. App. 121.\n   Henderson then returned to the court that had handled\nhis criminal case to seek release of his firearms. Invoking\nthe court’s equitable powers, Henderson asked for an\norder directing the FBI to transfer the guns either to his\nwife or to Rosier. The District Court denied the motion,\nconcluding (as the FBI had) that Henderson could not\n“transfer the firearms or receive money from their sale”\nwithout “constructive[ly] possessi[ng]” them in violation of\n§922(g). No. 3:06–cr–211 (MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2012), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 5a–6a, 12a. The Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit affirmed on the same ground, reasoning\nthat granting Henderson’s motion would amount to giving\na felon “constructive possession” of his firearms. 555 Fed.\nAppx. 851, 853 (2014) (per curiam).1\n——————\n   1 The Court of Appeals added that Henderson’s “equitable argument\n\nrings hollow” because a convicted felon has “unclean hands to demand\nreturn [or transfer] of his firearms.” 555 Fed. Appx., at 854. That view\nis wrong, as all parties now agree. See Brief for Petitioner 35–39; Brief\nfor United States 31, n. 8; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 42. The unclean hands\ndoctrine proscribes equitable relief when, but only when, an individ-\nual’s misconduct has “immediate and necessary relation to the equity\nthat he seeks.” Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., 290 U. S.\n240, 245 (1933). The doctrine might apply, for example, if a felon\nrequests the return or transfer of property used in furtherance of his\noffense. See, e.g., United States v. Kaczynski, 551 F. 3d 1120, 1129–\n1130 (CA9 2009) (holding that the Unabomber had unclean hands to\nrequest the return of bomb-making materials). But Henderson’s felony\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We granted certiorari, 574 U. S. ___ (2014), to resolve a\ncircuit split over whether, as the courts below held,\n§922(g) categorically prohibits a court from approving a\nconvicted felon’s request to transfer his firearms to an-\nother person.2 We now vacate the decision below.\n                              II\n   A federal court has equitable authority, even after a\ncriminal proceeding has ended, to order a law enforcement\nagency to turn over property it has obtained during the\ncase to the rightful owner or his designee. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Martinez, 241 F. 3d 1329, 1330–1331 (CA11\n2001) (citing numerous appellate decisions to that effect);\nTr. of Oral Arg. 41 (Solicitor General agreeing). Congress,\nhowever, may cabin that power in various ways. As rele-\nvant here, §922(g) makes it unlawful for any person con-\nvicted of a felony to “possess in or affecting commerce[ ]\nany firearm or ammunition.” That provision prevents a\ncourt from instructing an agency to return guns in its\ncustody to a felon-owner like Henderson, because that\nwould place him in violation of the law. The question here\nis how §922(g) affects a court’s authority to instead direct\nthe transfer of such firearms to a third party.\n   Section 922(g) proscribes possession alone, but covers\npossession in every form. By its terms, §922(g) does not\nprohibit a felon from owning firearms. Rather, it inter-\nferes with a single incident of ownership—one of the pro-\nverbial sticks in the bundle of property rights—by pre-\n\n——————\nconviction had nothing to do with his firearms, so the unclean hands\nrule has no role to play here.\n  2 Compare 555 Fed. Appx. 851, 853–854 (CA11 2014) (per curiam)\n\n(case below) (holding that §922(g) bars any transfer); United States v.\nFelici, 208 F. 3d 667, 670 (CA8 2000) (same), with United States v.\nZaleski, 686 F. 3d 90, 92–94 (CA2 2012) (holding that §922(g) permits\nsome transfers); United States v. Miller, 588 F. 3d 418, 419–420 (CA7\n2009) (same).\n4              HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nventing the felon from knowingly possessing his (or an-\nother person’s) guns. But that stick is a thick one, encom-\npassing what the criminal law recognizes as “actual” and\n“constructive” possession alike. 2A K. O’Malley, J. Grenig,\n& W. Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Crimi-\nnal §39.12, p. 55 (6th ed. 2009) (hereinafter O’Malley); see\nNational Safe Deposit Co. v. Stead, 232 U. S. 58, 67 (1914)\n(noting that in “legal terminology” the word “possession” is\n“interchangeably used to describe” both the actual and the\nconstructive kinds). Actual possession exists when a\nperson has direct physical control over a thing. See\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1047 (5th ed. 1979) (hereinafter\nBlack’s); 2A O’Malley §39.12, at 55. Constructive posses-\nsion is established when a person, though lacking such\nphysical custody, still has the power and intent to exercise\ncontrol over the object. See Black’s 1047; 2A O’Malley\n§39.12, at 55. Section 922(g) thus prevents a felon not\nonly from holding his firearms himself but also from main-\ntaining control over those guns in the hands of others.\n  That means, as all parties agree, that §922(g) prevents a\ncourt from ordering the sale or other transfer of a felon’s\nguns to someone willing to give the felon access to them or\nto accede to the felon’s instructions about their future use.\nSee Brief for United States 23; Reply Brief 12. In such a\ncase, the felon would have control over the guns, even\nwhile another person kept physical custody. The idea of\nconstructive possession is designed to preclude just that\nresult, “allow[ing] the law to reach beyond puppets to\npuppeteers.” United States v. Al-Rekabi, 454 F. 3d 1113,\n1118 (CA10 2006). A felon cannot evade the strictures of\n§922(g) by arranging a sham transfer that leaves him in\neffective control of his guns. And because that is so, a\ncourt may no more approve such a transfer than order the\nreturn of the firearms to the felon himself.\n  The Government argues that §922(g) prohibits still\nmore—that it bars a felon, except in one circumstance,\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom transferring his firearms to another person, no mat-\nter how independent of the felon’s influence. According to\nthe Government, a felon “exercises his right to control” his\nfirearms, and thus violates §922(g)’s broad ban on posses-\nsion, merely by “select[ing] the[ir] first recipient,” because\nthat choice “determine[s] who [will] (and who [will] not)\nnext have access to the firearms.” Brief for United States\n24. And that remains so even if a felon never retakes\nphysical custody of the guns and needs a court order to\napprove and effectuate the proposed transfer. The felon\n(so says the Government) still exerts enough sway over the\nguns’ disposition to “have constructive possession” of\nthem. Id., at 25. The only time that is not true, the Gov-\nernment claims, is when a felon asks the court to transfer\nthe guns to a licensed dealer or other party who will sell\nthe guns for him on the open market. See id., at 20–22;\nTr. of Oral Arg. 18–21. Because the felon then does not\ncontrol the firearms’ final destination, the Government\navers, he does not constructively possess them and a court\nmay approve the transfer. See ibid.\n   But the Government’s theory wrongly conflates the right\nto possess a gun with another incident of ownership,\nwhich §922(g) does not affect: the right merely to sell or\notherwise dispose of that item. Cf. Andrus v. Allard, 444\nU. S. 51, 65–66 (1979) (distinguishing between entitle-\nments to possess and sell property). Consider the scenario\nthat the Government claims would violate §922(g). The\nfelon has nothing to do with his guns before, during, or\nafter the transaction in question, except to nominate their\nrecipient. Prior to the transfer, the guns sit in an evidence\nvault, under the sole custody of law enforcement officers.\nAssuming the court approves the proposed recipient, FBI\nagents handle the firearms’ physical conveyance, without\nthe felon’s participation. Afterward, the purchaser or\nother custodian denies the felon any access to or influence\nover the guns; the recipient alone decides where to store\n6                HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthem, when to loan them out, how to use them, and so on.\nIn short, the arrangement serves only to divest the felon of\nhis firearms—and even that much depends on a court’s\napproving the designee’s fitness and ordering the transfer\nto go forward. Such a felon exercises not a possessory\ninterest (whether directly or through another), but instead\na naked right of alienation—the capacity to sell or transfer\nhis guns, unaccompanied by any control over them.3\n   The Government’s view of what counts as “possession”\nwould also extend §922(g)’s scope far beyond its purpose.\nCongress enacted that ban to keep firearms away from\nfelons like Henderson, for fear that they would use those\nguns irresponsibly. See Small v. United States, 544 U. S.\n385, 393 (2005). Yet on the Government’s construction,\n§922(g) would prevent Henderson from disposing of his\nfirearms even in ways that guarantee he never uses them\nagain, solely because he played a part in selecting their\n——————\n   3 The Government calls our attention to several cases in which courts\n\nhave found constructive possession of firearms based on evidence that a\nfelon negotiated and arranged a sale of guns while using a third party\nto make the physical handoff to the buyer. See, e.g., United States v.\nNungaray, 697 F. 3d 1114, 1116–1119 (CA9 2012); United States v.\nVirciglio, 441 F. 2d 1295, 1297–1298 (CA5 1971). But the facts in the\ncited cases bear no similarity to those here. In each, the defendant-\nfelon controlled the guns’ movement both before and during the trans-\naction at issue (and even was present at the delivery site). As the\nGovernment explains, the felon could “make a gun appear” at the time\nand place of his choosing and decide what would happen to it once it got\nthere. Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. Indeed, he could have chosen to take the\nfirearms for himself or direct them to someone under his influence. The\nfelon’s management of the sale thus exemplified, and served as evi-\ndence of, his broader command over the guns’ location and use—the\nvery hallmark of possession. But as just explained, that kind of control\nis absent when a felon can do no more than nominate an independent\nrecipient for firearms in a federal agency’s custody. The decisions the\nGovernment invokes thus have no bearing on this case; nor does our\ndecision here, which addresses only §922(g)’s application to court-\nsupervised transfers of guns, prevent the Government from bringing\ncharges under §922(g) in cases resembling those cited.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntransferee. He could not, for example, place those guns in\na secure trust for distribution to his children after his\ndeath. He could not sell them to someone halfway around\nthe world. He could not even donate them to a law en-\nforcement agency. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. Results of that\nkind would do nothing to advance §922(g)’s purpose.\n   Finally, the Government’s expansive idea of constructive\npossession fits poorly with its concession that a felon in\nHenderson’s position may select a firearms dealer or other\nthird party to sell his guns and give him the proceeds.\nAfter all, the felon chooses the guns’ “first recipient” in\nthat case too, deciding who “next ha[s] access to the fire-\narms.” Brief for United States 24; see supra, at 5. If (as\nthe Government argues) that is all it takes to exercise\ncontrol over and thus constructively possess an item, then\n(contrary to the Government’s view) the felon would vio-\nlate §922(g) merely by selecting a dealer to sell his guns.\nTo be sure, that person will predictably convey the fire-\narms to someone whom the felon does not know and can-\nnot control: That is why the Government, as a practical\nmatter, has no worries about the transfer. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 19–21. But that fact merely demonstrates how the\nGovernment’s view of §922(g) errs in its focus in a case\nlike this one. What matters here is not whether a felon\nplays a role in deciding where his firearms should go next:\nThat test would logically prohibit a transfer even when\nthe chosen recipient will later sell the guns to someone\nelse. What matters instead is whether the felon will have\nthe ability to use or direct the use of his firearms after\nthe transfer. That is what gives the felon constructive\npossession.\n   Accordingly, a court facing a motion like Henderson’s\nmay approve the transfer of guns consistently with §922(g)\nif, but only if, that disposition prevents the felon from\nlater exercising control over those weapons, so that he\ncould either use them or tell someone else how to do so.\n8              HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOne way to ensure that result, as the Government notes,\nis to order that the guns be turned over to a firearms\ndealer, himself independent of the felon’s control, for\nsubsequent sale on the open market. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Zaleski, 686 F. 3d 90, 92–94 (CA2 2012). Indeed,\nwe can see no reason, absent exceptional circumstances, to\ndisapprove a felon’s motion for such a sale, whether or not\nhe has picked the vendor. That option, however, is not the\nonly one available under §922(g). A court may also grant\na felon’s request to transfer his guns to a person who\nexpects to maintain custody of them, so long as the recipi-\nent will not allow the felon to exert any influence over\ntheir use. In considering such a motion, the court may\nproperly seek certain assurances: for example, it may ask\nthe proposed transferee to promise to keep the guns away\nfrom the felon, and to acknowledge that allowing him to\nuse them would aid and abet a §922(g) violation. See id.,\nat 94; United States v. Miller, 588 F. 3d 418, 420 (CA7\n2009). Even such a pledge, of course, might fail to provide\nan adequate safeguard, and a court should then disap-\nprove the transfer. See, e.g., State v. Fadness, 363 Mont.\n322, 341–342, 268 P. 3d 17, 30 (2012) (upholding a trial\ncourt’s finding that the assurances given by a felon’s par-\nents were not credible). But when a court is satisfied that\na felon will not retain control over his guns, §922(g) does\nnot apply, and the court has equitable power to accommo-\ndate the felon’s request.\n   Neither of the courts below assessed Henderson’s mo-\ntion for a transfer of his firearms in accord with these\nprinciples. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2801431/", "sha1": "af3ff092dbb8f16a1eb70e964eb0c98a56c22ffe", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-05-18T08:01:54.329692"}
