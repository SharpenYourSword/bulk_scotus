TOLLEFSON ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 13\u20131333. Argued February 23, 2015\u2014Decided May 18, 2015*\nOrdinarily, a federal litigant who is too poor to pay court fees may pro-\n  ceed in forma pauperis. This means that the litigant may commence\n  a civil action without prepaying fees or paying certain expenses. See\n  28 U. S. C. \u00a71915(a). But a special \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision prevents\n  a court from affording in forma pauperis status to a prisoner who\n \u201chas, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated . . . , brought an\n action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on\n the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim up-\n on which relief may be granted.\u201d \u00a71915(g).\n    Petitioner Coleman, a state prisoner, filed three federal lawsuits\n that were dismissed on grounds enumerated in \u00a71915(g). While the\n third dismissal was pending on appeal, he filed four additional feder-\n al lawsuits, moving to proceed in forma pauperis in each. The Dis-\n trict Court refused to permit him to proceed in forma pauperis in any\n of those lawsuits, holding that a prior dismissal is a strike under\n \u00a71915(g) even if it is pending on appeal. The Sixth Circuit agreed\n with the District Court.\nHeld: A prior dismissal on one of \u00a71915(g)\u2019s statutorily enumerated\n  grounds counts as a strike, even if the dismissal is the subject of an\n  ongoing appeal. Pp. 4\u20139.\n       (a) Coleman suggests that that a dismissal should count as a\n  strike only once appellate review is complete. But the word \u201cdis-\n  missed\u201d does not normally include subsequent appellate activity.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    * Together with Coleman, aka Coleman-Bey v. Bowerman et al.;\nColeman, aka Coleman-Bey v. Dykehouse et al., and Coleman, aka\nColeman-Bey v. Vroman et al. (see this Court\u2019s Rule 12.4), also on certi-\norari to the same court.\n2                       COLEMAN v. TOLLEFSON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    See, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 294. And \u00a71915 itself de-\n    scribes dismissal as an action taken by a single court, not as a se-\n    quence of events involving multiple courts. See \u00a71915(e). Coleman\n    further contends that the phrase \u201cprior occasions\u201d creates ambiguity.\n    But nothing about that phrase transforms a dismissal into a dismis-\n    sal-plus-appellate-review. In the context of \u00a71915(g), a \u201cprior occa-\n    sion\u201d merely means a previous instance in which a \u201cprisoner has . . .\n    brought an action or appeal . . . that was dismissed on\u201d statutorily\n    enumerated grounds.\n       A literal reading of the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision is consistent with\n    the statute\u2019s treatment of the trial and appellate states of litigation\n    as distinct. See \u00a7\u00a71915(a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(1), (e)(2), (g). It is also sup-\n    ported by the way in which the law ordinarily treats trial court\n    judgments, i.e., a judgment normally takes effect despite a pending\n    appeal, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 62; Fed. Rule App. Proc. 8(a), and its\n    preclusive effect is generally immediate, notwithstanding any appeal,\n    see Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, 527.\n       Finally, the statute\u2019s purpose favors this Court\u2019s interpretation.\n    The \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision was \u201cdesigned to filter out the bad\n    claims and facilitate consideration of the good,\u201d Jones v. Bock, 549\n    U. S. 199, 204. To refuse to count a prior dismissal because of a\n    pending appeal would produce a leaky filter, because a prisoner could\n    file many new lawsuits before reaching the end of the often lengthy\n    appellate process. By contrast, the Court perceives no great risk that\n    an erroneous trial court dismissal might wrongly deprive a prisoner\n    of in forma pauperis status in a subsequent lawsuit. Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (b) Coleman also argues that if the dismissal of a third complaint\n    counts as a third strike, a litigant will lose the ability to appeal in\n    forma pauperis from that strike itself. He believes this is a result\n    that Congress could not possibly have intended. Because Coleman is\n    not appealing from a third-strike trial-court dismissal here, the Court\n    declines to address that question.

This means that the\nlitigant may commence a civil action without prepaying\nfees or paying certain expenses. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71915.\nBut a special \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision prevents a court\nfrom affording in forma pauperis status where the litigant\nis a prisoner and he or she \u201chas, on 3 or more prior occa\u00ad\nsions, while incarcerated . . . , brought an action or appeal\nin a court of the United States that was dismissed on the\ngrounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a\nclaim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d \u00a71915(g).\n   Prior to this litigation, a Federal District Court had\ndismissed on those grounds three actions brought by a\n2                 COLEMAN v. TOLLEFSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate prisoner. While the third dismissal was pending on\nappeal, the prisoner sought to bring several additional\nactions in the federal courts. The question before us is\nwhether the prisoner may litigate his new actions in forma\npauperis. Where an appeals court has not yet decided\nwhether a prior dismissal is legally proper, should courts\ncount, or should they ignore, that dismissal when calcu\u00ad\nlating how many qualifying dismissals the litigant has\nsuffered?\n  We conclude that the courts must count the dismissal\neven though it remains pending on appeal. The litigant\nhere has accumulated three prior dismissals on statutorily\nenumerated grounds. Consequently, a court may not\nafford him in forma pauperis status with respect to his\nadditional civil actions.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  Congress first enacted an in forma pauperis statute in\n1892. See Act of July 20, ch. 209, 27 Stat. 252. Congress\nrecognized that \u201cno citizen sh[ould] be denied an oppor\u00ad\ntunity to commence, prosecute, or defend an action, civil or\ncriminal, in any court of the United States, solely because\nhis poverty makes it impossible for him to pay or secure\nthe costs.\u201d Adkins v. E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 335\nU. S. 331, 342 (1948) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIt therefore permitted a citizen to \u201ccommence and prose\u00ad\ncute to conclusion any such . . . action without being re\u00ad\nquired to prepay fees or costs, or give security therefor\nbefore or after bringing suit.\u201d \u00a71, 27 Stat. 252. The cur\u00ad\nrent statute permits an individual to litigate a federal\naction in forma pauperis if the individual files an affidavit\nstating, among other things, that he or she is unable to\nprepay fees \u201cor give security therefor.\u201d         28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71915(a)(1).\n  Even in 1892, \u201cCongress recognized . . . that a litigant\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhose filing fees and court costs are assumed by the pub\u00ad\nlic, unlike a paying litigant, lacks an economic incentive to\nrefrain from filing frivolous, malicious, or repetitive law\u00ad\nsuits.\u201d Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S. 319, 324 (1989).\nAnd as the years passed, Congress came to see that pris\u00ad\noner suits in particular represented a disproportionate\nshare of federal filings. Jones v. Bock, 549 U. S. 199, 202\u2013\n203 (2007). It responded by \u201cenact[ing] a variety of re\u00ad\nforms designed to filter out the bad claims [filed by prison\u00ad\ners] and facilitate consideration of the good.\u201d Id., at 204.\nAmong those reforms was the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule here at\nissue. The rule, which applies to in forma pauperis status,\nreads in its entirety as follows:\n    \u201cIn no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or ap\u00ad\n    peal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding [in\n    forma pauperis] if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior\n    occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facil\u00ad\n    ity, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United\n    States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is\n    frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon\n    which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is\n    under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d\n    \u00a71915(g).\n                             B\n  The petitioner, Andr\u00e9 Lee Coleman, is incarcerated at\nthe Baraga Correctional Facility in Michigan. By 2010,\nthree federal lawsuits filed by Coleman during his incar\u00ad\nceration had been dismissed as frivolous (or on other\ngrounds enumerated in \u00a71915(g)). Nonetheless, when\nColeman filed four new federal lawsuits between April\n2010 and January 2011, he moved to proceed in forma\npauperis in each. He denied that his third dismissed\nlawsuit counted as a strike under \u00a71915(g). That is be\u00ad\ncause he had appealed the dismissal, and the appeals\ncourt had not yet ruled. Thus, in Coleman\u2019s view, he had\n4                 COLEMAN v. TOLLEFSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfewer than three qualifying dismissals, and was eligible\nfor in forma pauperis status under the statute.\n   The District Court rejected Coleman\u2019s argument. It held\nthat \u201ca dismissal counts as a strike even if it is pending on\nappeal at the time that the plaintiff files his new action.\u201d\nNo. 10\u2013cv\u2013337 (WD Mich., Apr. 12, 2011), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 21a, 24a. It thus refused to permit Coleman to\nproceed in forma pauperis in any of his four suits.\n   On appeal, a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit agreed\nwith the District Court. 733 F. 3d 175 (2013). It resolved\nthe four cases using slightly different procedures. In one\nof the four cases, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment. In the remaining three cases, it denied\nColeman\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.\nIt subsequently dismissed the three cases for want of\nprosecution after Coleman failed to pay the appellate\nfiling fees.\n   In contrast to the Sixth Circuit, the vast majority of the\nother Courts of Appeals have held that a prior dismissal\non a statutorily enumerated ground does not count as a\nstrike while an appeal of that dismissal remains pending.\nSee Henslee v. Keller, 681 F. 3d 538, 541 (CA4 2012) (list\u00ad\ning, and joining, courts that have adopted the majority\nview). In light of the division of opinion among the Cir\u00ad\ncuits, we granted Coleman\u2019s petition for certiorari.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n   In our view, the Sixth Circuit majority correctly applied\n\u00a71915(g). A prior dismissal on a statutorily enumerated\nground counts as a strike even if the dismissal is the\nsubject of an appeal. That, after all, is what the statute\nliterally says. The \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision applies where\na prisoner \u201chas, on 3 or more prior occasions . . . brought\nan action or appeal . . . that was dismissed on\u201d certain\ngrounds. \u00a71915(g) (emphasis added). Coleman believes\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat we should read the statute as if it referred to an\n\u201caffirmed dismissal,\u201d as if it considered a trial court dis\u00ad\nmissal to be provisional, or as if it meant that a dismissal\nfalls within the statute\u2019s scope only when the litigant has\nno further chance to secure a reversal. But the statute\nitself says none of these things.\n   Instead, the statute refers to whether an action or ap\u00ad\npeal \u201cwas dismissed.\u201d \u00a71915(g). The linguistic term \u201cdis\u00ad\nmiss,\u201d taken alone, does not normally include subsequent\nappellate activity. See, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.\n291, 294 (1995) (\u201c[T]he District Court dismissed [the]\nlawsuit for failure to state a claim. . . . However, the Court\nof Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment\u201d); Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 158\n(1996) (\u201cThe Suffolk Circuit Court dismissed petitioner\u2019s\nstate petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Virginia\nSupreme Court affirmed the dismissal\u201d). Indeed, \u00a71915\nitself describes dismissal as an action taken by a single\ncourt, not as a sequence of events involving multiple\ncourts. See \u00a71915(e)(2) (\u201c[T]he court shall dismiss the case\nat any time if the court determines that\u2014(A) the allega\u00ad\ntion of poverty is untrue; or (B) the action or appeal\u2014(i) is\nfrivolous or malicious; [or] (ii) fails to state a claim on\nwhich relief may be granted\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Coleman insists that \u00a71915(g) is not so clear. Even if\nthe term \u201cdismissed\u201d is unambiguous, contends Coleman,\nthe phrase \u201cprior occasions\u201d creates ambiguity. Coleman\nobserves that the phrase \u201c \u2018may refer to a single moment or\nto a continuing event: to an appeal, independent of the\nunderlying action, or to the continuing claim, inclusive of\nboth the action and its appeal.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 17\n(quoting Henslee, supra, at 542). Coleman believes that a\n\u201cprior occasion\u201d in the context of \u00a71915(g) may therefore\ninclude both a dismissal on an enumerated ground and\nany subsequent appeal.\n   We find it difficult to agree. Linguistically speaking, we\n6                  COLEMAN v. TOLLEFSON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsee nothing about the phrase \u201cprior occasions\u201d that would\ntransform a dismissal into a dismissal-plus-appellate\u00ad\nreview. An \u201coccasion\u201d is \u201ca particular occurrence,\u201d a \u201chap\u00ad\npening,\u201d or an \u201cincident.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Interna\u00ad\ntional Dictionary 1560 (3d ed. 1993). And the statute\nprovides the content of that occurrence, happening, or\nincident: It is an instance in which a \u201cprisoner has . . .\nbrought an action or appeal in a court of the United States\nthat was dismissed on\u201d statutorily enumerated grounds.\n\u00a71915(g). Under the plain language of the statute, when\nColeman filed the suits at issue here, he had already\nexperienced three such \u201cprior occasions.\u201d\n   Our literal reading of the phrases \u201cprior occasions\u201d and\n\u201cwas dismissed\u201d is consistent with the statute\u2019s discussion\nof actions and appeals. The in forma pauperis statute\nrepeatedly treats the trial and appellate stages of litiga\u00ad\ntion as distinct. See \u00a7\u00a71915(a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(1), (e)(2), (g).\nRelated provisions reflect a congressional focus upon trial\ncourt dismissal as an important separate element of the\nstatutory scheme. See \u00a71915A (requiring a district court\nto screen certain prisoner complaints \u201cas soon as practica\u00ad\nble\u201d and to dismiss any portion of the complaint that \u201cis\nfrivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted\u201d); 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(c)(1) (similar).\nWe have found nothing in these provisions indicating that\nCongress considered a trial court dismissal and an appel\u00ad\nlate court decision as if they were a single entity\u2014or that\nCongress intended the former to take effect only when\naffirmed by the latter.\n   Our literal reading of the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision also\nis supported by the way in which the law ordinarily treats\ntrial court judgments. Unless a court issues a stay, a trial\ncourt\u2019s judgment (say, dismissing a case) normally takes\neffect despite a pending appeal. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n62; Fed. Rule App. Proc. 8(a). And a judgment\u2019s preclusive\neffect is generally immediate, notwithstanding any appeal.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, 527 (2003) (\u201cTyp\u00ad\nically, a federal judgment becomes final for . . . claim\npreclusion purposes when the district court disassociates\nitself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court\nof first instance save execution of the judgment\u201d). The\nordinary rules of civil procedure thus provide additional\nsupport for our interpretation of the statute. See Jones,\n549 U. S., at 211\u2013216 (applying the ordinary rules of civil\nprocedure where the procedural requirements for prison\nlitigation do not call for an alternative).\n   Finally, the statute\u2019s purpose favors our interpretation.\nThe \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision was \u201cdesigned to filter out\nthe bad claims and facilitate consideration of the good.\u201d\nId., at 204. To refuse to count a prior dismissal because of\na pending appeal would produce a leaky filter. Appeals\ntake time. During that time, a prisoner could file many\nlawsuits, including additional lawsuits that are frivolous,\nmalicious, or fail to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. Indeed, Coleman filed these four cases after he\nsuffered his third qualifying dismissal, in October 2009,\nand before the affirmance of that order, in March 2011.\n   We recognize that our interpretation of the statute may\ncreate a different risk: An erroneous trial court dismissal\nmight wrongly deprive a prisoner of in forma pauperis\nstatus with respect to lawsuits filed after a dismissal but\nbefore its reversal on appeal. But that risk does not seem\ngreat. For one thing, the Solicitor General informs us that\nhe has been able to identify only two instances in which a\nCourt of Appeals has reversed a District Court\u2019s issuance\nof a third strike. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n22, n. 5. For another, where a court of appeals reverses a\nthird strike, in some instances the prisoner will be able to\nrefile his or her lawsuit after the reversal, seeking in\nforma pauperis status at that time. Further, if the statute\nof limitations governing that lawsuit has run out before\nthe court of appeals reverses the third strike, the Solicitor\n8                 COLEMAN v. TOLLEFSON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nGeneral assures us that prisoners will find relief in Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 60(b). According to the Solicitor\nGeneral, a prisoner may move to reopen his or her interim\nlawsuits (reinstating the cases as of the dates originally\nfiled) and may then seek in forma pauperis status anew.\nIn any event, we believe our interpretation of the statute\nhews more closely to its meaning and objective than does\nColeman\u2019s alternative.\n                             B\n  Coleman makes an additional argument. He poses a\nhypothetical: What if this case had involved an attempt to\nappeal from the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his third com\u00ad\nplaint instead of an attempt to file several additional\ncomplaints? If the dismissal were counted as his third\nstrike, Coleman asserts, he would lose the ability to ap\u00ad\npeal in forma pauperis from that strike itself. He believes\nthat this result, which potentially could deprive him of\nappellate review, would be unfair. He further believes\nthat it would be such a departure from the federal courts\u2019\nnormal appellate practice that Congress could not possibly\nhave intended it.\n  The Solicitor General, while subscribing to our interpre\u00ad\ntation of the statute, supports Coleman on this point. The\nSolicitor General says that we can and should read the\nstatute to afford a prisoner in forma pauperis status with\nrespect to an appeal from a third qualifying dismissal\u2014\neven if it does not allow a prisoner to file a fourth case\nduring that time. He believes that the statute, in refer\u00ad\nring to dismissals \u201con 3 or more prior occasions,\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71915(g) (emphasis added), means that a trial\ncourt dismissal qualifies as a strike only if it occurred in a\nprior, different, lawsuit.\n  We need not, and do not, now decide whether the Solici\u00ad\ntor General\u2019s interpretation (or some other interpretation\nwith the same result) is correct. That is because Coleman\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nis not here appealing from a third-strike trial-court dis\u00ad\nmissal. He is appealing from the denial of in forma pau-\nperis status with respect to several separate suits filed\nafter the trial court dismissed his earlier third-strike suit.\nWith respect to those suits, the earlier dismissals certainly\ntook place on \u201cprior occasions.\u201d If and when the situation\nthat Coleman hypothesizes does arise, the courts can\nconsider the problem in context.\n                       *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, we hold that a prisoner who has\naccumulated three prior qualifying dismissals under\n\u00a71915(g) may not file an additional suit in forma pauperis\nwhile his appeal of one such dismissal is pending. The\njudgments of the Court of Appeals are\n                                                 Affirmed.\n",

Argued February 23, 2015\u2014Decided May 18, 2015*\nOrdinarily, a federal litigant who is too poor to pay court fees may pro-\n  ceed in forma pauperis. This means that the litigant may commence\n  a civil action without prepaying fees or paying certain expenses. See\n  28 U. S. C. \u00a71915(a). But a special \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision prevents\n  a court from affording in forma pauperis status to a prisoner who\n \u201chas, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated . . . , brought an\n action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on\n the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim up-\n on which relief may be granted.\u201d \u00a71915(g).\n    Petitioner Coleman, a state prisoner, filed three federal lawsuits\n that were dismissed on grounds enumerated in \u00a71915(g). While the\n third dismissal was pending on appeal, he filed four additional feder-\n al lawsuits, moving to proceed in forma pauperis in each. The Dis-\n trict Court refused to permit him to proceed in forma pauperis in any\n of those lawsuits, holding that a prior dismissal is a strike under\n \u00a71915(g) even if it is pending on appeal. The Sixth Circuit agreed\n with the District Court.\nHeld: A prior dismissal on one of \u00a71915(g)\u2019s statutorily enumerated\n  grounds counts as a strike, even if the dismissal is the subject of an\n  ongoing appeal. Pp. 4\u20139.\n       (a) Coleman suggests that that a dismissal should count as a\n  strike only once appellate review is complete. But the word \u201cdis-\n  missed\u201d does not normally include subsequent appellate activity.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    * Together with Coleman, aka Coleman-Bey v. Bowerman et al.;\nColeman, aka Coleman-Bey v. Dykehouse et al., and Coleman, aka\nColeman-Bey v. Vroman et al. (see this Court\u2019s Rule 12.4), also on certi-\norari to the same court.\n2                       COLEMAN v. TOLLEFSON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    See, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 294. And \u00a71915 itself de-\n    scribes dismissal as an action taken by a single court, not as a se-\n    quence of events involving multiple courts. See \u00a71915(e). Coleman\n    further contends that the phrase \u201cprior occasions\u201d creates ambiguity.\n    But nothing about that phrase transforms a dismissal into a dismis-\n    sal-plus-appellate-review. In the context of \u00a71915(g), a \u201cprior occa-\n    sion\u201d merely means a previous instance in which a \u201cprisoner has . . .\n    brought an action or appeal . . . that was dismissed on\u201d statutorily\n    enumerated grounds.\n       A literal reading of the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision is consistent with\n    the statute\u2019s treatment of the trial and appellate states of litigation\n    as distinct. See \u00a7\u00a71915(a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(1), (e)(2), (g). It is also sup-\n    ported by the way in which the law ordinarily treats trial court\n    judgments, i.e., a judgment normally takes effect despite a pending\n    appeal, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 62; Fed. Rule App. Proc. 8(a), and its\n    preclusive effect is generally immediate, notwithstanding any appeal,\n    see Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, 527.\n       Finally, the statute\u2019s purpose favors this Court\u2019s interpretation.\n    The \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision was \u201cdesigned to filter out the bad\n    claims and facilitate consideration of the good,\u201d Jones v. Bock, 549\n    U. S. 199, 204. To refuse to count a prior dismissal because of a\n    pending appeal would produce a leaky filter, because a prisoner could\n    file many new lawsuits before reaching the end of the often lengthy\n    appellate process. By contrast, the Court perceives no great risk that\n    an erroneous trial court dismissal might wrongly deprive a prisoner\n    of in forma pauperis status in a subsequent lawsuit. Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (b) Coleman also argues that if the dismissal of a third complaint\n    counts as a third strike, a litigant will lose the ability to appeal in\n    forma pauperis from that strike itself. He believes this is a result\n    that Congress could not possibly have intended. Because Coleman is\n    not appealing from a third-strike trial-court dismissal here, the Court\n    declines to address that question.

This means that the\nlitigant may commence a civil action without prepaying\nfees or paying certain expenses. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71915.\nBut a special \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision prevents a court\nfrom affording in forma pauperis status where the litigant\nis a prisoner and he or she \u201chas, on 3 or more prior occa\u00ad\nsions, while incarcerated . . . , brought an action or appeal\nin a court of the United States that was dismissed on the\ngrounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a\nclaim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d \u00a71915(g).\n   Prior to this litigation, a Federal District Court had\ndismissed on those grounds three actions brought by a\n2                 COLEMAN v. TOLLEFSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate prisoner. While the third dismissal was pending on\nappeal, the prisoner sought to bring several additional\nactions in the federal courts. The question before us is\nwhether the prisoner may litigate his new actions in forma\npauperis. Where an appeals court has not yet decided\nwhether a prior dismissal is legally proper, should courts\ncount, or should they ignore, that dismissal when calcu\u00ad\nlating how many qualifying dismissals the litigant has\nsuffered?\n  We conclude that the courts must count the dismissal\neven though it remains pending on appeal. The litigant\nhere has accumulated three prior dismissals on statutorily\nenumerated grounds. Consequently, a court may not\nafford him in forma pauperis status with respect to his\nadditional civil actions.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  Congress first enacted an in forma pauperis statute in\n1892. See Act of July 20, ch. 209, 27 Stat. 252. Congress\nrecognized that \u201cno citizen sh[ould] be denied an oppor\u00ad\ntunity to commence, prosecute, or defend an action, civil or\ncriminal, in any court of the United States, solely because\nhis poverty makes it impossible for him to pay or secure\nthe costs.\u201d Adkins v. E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 335\nU. S. 331, 342 (1948) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIt therefore permitted a citizen to \u201ccommence and prose\u00ad\ncute to conclusion any such . . . action without being re\u00ad\nquired to prepay fees or costs, or give security therefor\nbefore or after bringing suit.\u201d \u00a71, 27 Stat. 252. The cur\u00ad\nrent statute permits an individual to litigate a federal\naction in forma pauperis if the individual files an affidavit\nstating, among other things, that he or she is unable to\nprepay fees \u201cor give security therefor.\u201d         28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71915(a)(1).\n  Even in 1892, \u201cCongress recognized . . . that a litigant\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhose filing fees and court costs are assumed by the pub\u00ad\nlic, unlike a paying litigant, lacks an economic incentive to\nrefrain from filing frivolous, malicious, or repetitive law\u00ad\nsuits.\u201d Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S. 319, 324 (1989).\nAnd as the years passed, Congress came to see that pris\u00ad\noner suits in particular represented a disproportionate\nshare of federal filings. Jones v. Bock, 549 U. S. 199, 202\u2013\n203 (2007). It responded by \u201cenact[ing] a variety of re\u00ad\nforms designed to filter out the bad claims [filed by prison\u00ad\ners] and facilitate consideration of the good.\u201d Id., at 204.\nAmong those reforms was the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule here at\nissue. The rule, which applies to in forma pauperis status,\nreads in its entirety as follows:\n    \u201cIn no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or ap\u00ad\n    peal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding [in\n    forma pauperis] if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior\n    occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facil\u00ad\n    ity, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United\n    States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is\n    frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon\n    which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is\n    under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d\n    \u00a71915(g).\n                             B\n  The petitioner, Andr\u00e9 Lee Coleman, is incarcerated at\nthe Baraga Correctional Facility in Michigan. By 2010,\nthree federal lawsuits filed by Coleman during his incar\u00ad\nceration had been dismissed as frivolous (or on other\ngrounds enumerated in \u00a71915(g)). Nonetheless, when\nColeman filed four new federal lawsuits between April\n2010 and January 2011, he moved to proceed in forma\npauperis in each. He denied that his third dismissed\nlawsuit counted as a strike under \u00a71915(g). That is be\u00ad\ncause he had appealed the dismissal, and the appeals\ncourt had not yet ruled. Thus, in Coleman\u2019s view, he had\n4                 COLEMAN v. TOLLEFSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfewer than three qualifying dismissals, and was eligible\nfor in forma pauperis status under the statute.\n   The District Court rejected Coleman\u2019s argument. It held\nthat \u201ca dismissal counts as a strike even if it is pending on\nappeal at the time that the plaintiff files his new action.\u201d\nNo. 10\u2013cv\u2013337 (WD Mich., Apr. 12, 2011), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 21a, 24a. It thus refused to permit Coleman to\nproceed in forma pauperis in any of his four suits.\n   On appeal, a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit agreed\nwith the District Court. 733 F. 3d 175 (2013). It resolved\nthe four cases using slightly different procedures. In one\nof the four cases, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment. In the remaining three cases, it denied\nColeman\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.\nIt subsequently dismissed the three cases for want of\nprosecution after Coleman failed to pay the appellate\nfiling fees.\n   In contrast to the Sixth Circuit, the vast majority of the\nother Courts of Appeals have held that a prior dismissal\non a statutorily enumerated ground does not count as a\nstrike while an appeal of that dismissal remains pending.\nSee Henslee v. Keller, 681 F. 3d 538, 541 (CA4 2012) (list\u00ad\ning, and joining, courts that have adopted the majority\nview). In light of the division of opinion among the Cir\u00ad\ncuits, we granted Coleman\u2019s petition for certiorari.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n   In our view, the Sixth Circuit majority correctly applied\n\u00a71915(g). A prior dismissal on a statutorily enumerated\nground counts as a strike even if the dismissal is the\nsubject of an appeal. That, after all, is what the statute\nliterally says. The \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision applies where\na prisoner \u201chas, on 3 or more prior occasions . . . brought\nan action or appeal . . . that was dismissed on\u201d certain\ngrounds. \u00a71915(g) (emphasis added). Coleman believes\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat we should read the statute as if it referred to an\n\u201caffirmed dismissal,\u201d as if it considered a trial court dis\u00ad\nmissal to be provisional, or as if it meant that a dismissal\nfalls within the statute\u2019s scope only when the litigant has\nno further chance to secure a reversal. But the statute\nitself says none of these things.\n   Instead, the statute refers to whether an action or ap\u00ad\npeal \u201cwas dismissed.\u201d \u00a71915(g). The linguistic term \u201cdis\u00ad\nmiss,\u201d taken alone, does not normally include subsequent\nappellate activity. See, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.\n291, 294 (1995) (\u201c[T]he District Court dismissed [the]\nlawsuit for failure to state a claim. . . . However, the Court\nof Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment\u201d); Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 158\n(1996) (\u201cThe Suffolk Circuit Court dismissed petitioner\u2019s\nstate petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Virginia\nSupreme Court affirmed the dismissal\u201d). Indeed, \u00a71915\nitself describes dismissal as an action taken by a single\ncourt, not as a sequence of events involving multiple\ncourts. See \u00a71915(e)(2) (\u201c[T]he court shall dismiss the case\nat any time if the court determines that\u2014(A) the allega\u00ad\ntion of poverty is untrue; or (B) the action or appeal\u2014(i) is\nfrivolous or malicious; [or] (ii) fails to state a claim on\nwhich relief may be granted\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Coleman insists that \u00a71915(g) is not so clear. Even if\nthe term \u201cdismissed\u201d is unambiguous, contends Coleman,\nthe phrase \u201cprior occasions\u201d creates ambiguity. Coleman\nobserves that the phrase \u201c \u2018may refer to a single moment or\nto a continuing event: to an appeal, independent of the\nunderlying action, or to the continuing claim, inclusive of\nboth the action and its appeal.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 17\n(quoting Henslee, supra, at 542). Coleman believes that a\n\u201cprior occasion\u201d in the context of \u00a71915(g) may therefore\ninclude both a dismissal on an enumerated ground and\nany subsequent appeal.\n   We find it difficult to agree. Linguistically speaking, we\n6                  COLEMAN v. TOLLEFSON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsee nothing about the phrase \u201cprior occasions\u201d that would\ntransform a dismissal into a dismissal-plus-appellate\u00ad\nreview. An \u201coccasion\u201d is \u201ca particular occurrence,\u201d a \u201chap\u00ad\npening,\u201d or an \u201cincident.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Interna\u00ad\ntional Dictionary 1560 (3d ed. 1993). And the statute\nprovides the content of that occurrence, happening, or\nincident: It is an instance in which a \u201cprisoner has . . .\nbrought an action or appeal in a court of the United States\nthat was dismissed on\u201d statutorily enumerated grounds.\n\u00a71915(g). Under the plain language of the statute, when\nColeman filed the suits at issue here, he had already\nexperienced three such \u201cprior occasions.\u201d\n   Our literal reading of the phrases \u201cprior occasions\u201d and\n\u201cwas dismissed\u201d is consistent with the statute\u2019s discussion\nof actions and appeals. The in forma pauperis statute\nrepeatedly treats the trial and appellate stages of litiga\u00ad\ntion as distinct. See \u00a7\u00a71915(a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(1), (e)(2), (g).\nRelated provisions reflect a congressional focus upon trial\ncourt dismissal as an important separate element of the\nstatutory scheme. See \u00a71915A (requiring a district court\nto screen certain prisoner complaints \u201cas soon as practica\u00ad\nble\u201d and to dismiss any portion of the complaint that \u201cis\nfrivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted\u201d); 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(c)(1) (similar).\nWe have found nothing in these provisions indicating that\nCongress considered a trial court dismissal and an appel\u00ad\nlate court decision as if they were a single entity\u2014or that\nCongress intended the former to take effect only when\naffirmed by the latter.\n   Our literal reading of the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision also\nis supported by the way in which the law ordinarily treats\ntrial court judgments. Unless a court issues a stay, a trial\ncourt\u2019s judgment (say, dismissing a case) normally takes\neffect despite a pending appeal. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n62; Fed. Rule App. Proc. 8(a). And a judgment\u2019s preclusive\neffect is generally immediate, notwithstanding any appeal.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, 527 (2003) (\u201cTyp\u00ad\nically, a federal judgment becomes final for . . . claim\npreclusion purposes when the district court disassociates\nitself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court\nof first instance save execution of the judgment\u201d). The\nordinary rules of civil procedure thus provide additional\nsupport for our interpretation of the statute. See Jones,\n549 U. S., at 211\u2013216 (applying the ordinary rules of civil\nprocedure where the procedural requirements for prison\nlitigation do not call for an alternative).\n   Finally, the statute\u2019s purpose favors our interpretation.\nThe \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision was \u201cdesigned to filter out\nthe bad claims and facilitate consideration of the good.\u201d\nId., at 204. To refuse to count a prior dismissal because of\na pending appeal would produce a leaky filter. Appeals\ntake time. During that time, a prisoner could file many\nlawsuits, including additional lawsuits that are frivolous,\nmalicious, or fail to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. Indeed, Coleman filed these four cases after he\nsuffered his third qualifying dismissal, in October 2009,\nand before the affirmance of that order, in March 2011.\n   We recognize that our interpretation of the statute may\ncreate a different risk: An erroneous trial court dismissal\nmight wrongly deprive a prisoner of in forma pauperis\nstatus with respect to lawsuits filed after a dismissal but\nbefore its reversal on appeal. But that risk does not seem\ngreat. For one thing, the Solicitor General informs us that\nhe has been able to identify only two instances in which a\nCourt of Appeals has reversed a District Court\u2019s issuance\nof a third strike. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n22, n. 5. For another, where a court of appeals reverses a\nthird strike, in some instances the prisoner will be able to\nrefile his or her lawsuit after the reversal, seeking in\nforma pauperis status at that time. Further, if the statute\nof limitations governing that lawsuit has run out before\nthe court of appeals reverses the third strike, the Solicitor\n8                 COLEMAN v. TOLLEFSON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nGeneral assures us that prisoners will find relief in Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 60(b). According to the Solicitor\nGeneral, a prisoner may move to reopen his or her interim\nlawsuits (reinstating the cases as of the dates originally\nfiled) and may then seek in forma pauperis status anew.\nIn any event, we believe our interpretation of the statute\nhews more closely to its meaning and objective than does\nColeman\u2019s alternative.\n                             B\n  Coleman makes an additional argument. He poses a\nhypothetical: What if this case had involved an attempt to\nappeal from the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his third com\u00ad\nplaint instead of an attempt to file several additional\ncomplaints? If the dismissal were counted as his third\nstrike, Coleman asserts, he would lose the ability to ap\u00ad\npeal in forma pauperis from that strike itself. He believes\nthat this result, which potentially could deprive him of\nappellate review, would be unfair. He further believes\nthat it would be such a departure from the federal courts\u2019\nnormal appellate practice that Congress could not possibly\nhave intended it.\n  The Solicitor General, while subscribing to our interpre\u00ad\ntation of the statute, supports Coleman on this point. The\nSolicitor General says that we can and should read the\nstatute to afford a prisoner in forma pauperis status with\nrespect to an appeal from a third qualifying dismissal\u2014\neven if it does not allow a prisoner to file a fourth case\nduring that time. He believes that the statute, in refer\u00ad\nring to dismissals \u201con 3 or more prior occasions,\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71915(g) (emphasis added), means that a trial\ncourt dismissal qualifies as a strike only if it occurred in a\nprior, different, lawsuit.\n  We need not, and do not, now decide whether the Solici\u00ad\ntor General\u2019s interpretation (or some other interpretation\nwith the same result) is correct. That is because Coleman\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nis not here appealing from a third-strike trial-court dis\u00ad\nmissal. He is appealing from the denial of in forma pau-\nperis status with respect to several separate suits filed\nafter the trial court dismissed his earlier third-strike suit.\nWith respect to those suits, the earlier dismissals certainly\ntook place on \u201cprior occasions.\u201d If and when the situation\nthat Coleman hypothesizes does arise, the courts can\nconsider the problem in context.\n                       *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, we hold that a prisoner who has\naccumulated three prior qualifying dismissals under\n\u00a71915(g) may not file an additional suit in forma pauperis\nwhile his appeal of one such dismissal is pending. The\njudgments of the Court of Appeals are\n                                                 Affirmed.\n</pre>",
