Argued March 23, 2015\u2014Decided May 18, 2015\nRespondent Sheehan lived in a group home for individuals with mental\n  illness. After Sheehan began acting erratically and threatened to kill\n  her social worker, the City and County of San Francisco (San Fran-\n  cisco) dispatched police officers Reynolds and Holder to help escort\n  Sheehan to a facility for temporary evaluation and treatment. When\n  the officers first entered Sheehan\u2019s room, she grabbed a knife and\n  threatened to kill them. They retreated and closed the door. Con-\n  cerned about what Sheehan might do behind the closed door, and\n  without considering if they could accommodate her disability, the of-\n  ficers reentered her room. Sheehan, knife in hand, again confronted\n  them. After pepper spray proved ineffective, the officers shot\n  Sheehan multiple times. Sheehan later sued petitioner San Francis-\n  co for, among other things, violating Title II of the Americans with\n  Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) by arresting her without accommodat-\n  ing her disability. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a712132. She also sued petitioners\n  Reynolds and Holder in their personal capacities under 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71983, claiming that they violated her Fourth Amendment rights.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment because it concluded\n  that officers making an arrest are not required to determine whether\n  their actions would comply with the ADA before protecting them-\n  selves and others, and also that Reynolds and Holder did not violate\n  the Constitution. Vacating in part, the Ninth Circuit held that the\n  ADA applied and that a jury must decide whether San Francisco\n  should have accommodated Sheehan. The court also held that Reyn-\n  olds and Holder are not entitled to qualified immunity because it is\n  clearly established that, absent an objective need for immediate en-\n  try, officers cannot forcibly enter the home of an armed, mentally ill\n2             CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                         v.

The question whether \u00a712132 \u201crequires law enforcement officers\n to provide accommodations to an armed, violent, and mentally ill\n suspect in the course of bringing the suspect into custody,\u201d Pet. for\n Cert. i, is dismissed as improvidently granted. Certiorari was grant-\n ed on the understanding that San Francisco would argue that Title II\n of the ADA does not apply when an officer faces an armed and dan-\n gerous individual. Instead, San Francisco merely argues that\n Sheehan was not \u201cqualified\u201d for an accommodation, \u00a712132, because\n she \u201cpose[d] a direct threat to the health or safety of others,\u201d which\n threat could not \u201cbe eliminated by a modification of policies, practices\n or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services,\u201d 28\n CFR \u00a7\u00a735.139(a), 35.104. This argument was not passed on by the\n court below. The decision to dismiss this question as improvidently\n granted, moreover, is reinforced by the parties\u2019 failure to address the\n related question whether a public entity can be vicariously liable for\n damages under Title II for an arrest made by its police officers.\n Pp. 7\u201310.\n    2. Reynolds and Holder are entitled to qualified immunity from lia-\n bility for the injuries suffered by Sheehan. Public officials are im-\n mune from suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 unless they have \u201cviolated a\n statutory or constitutional right that was \u2018 \u201c \u2018clearly established\u2019 \u201d \u2019 at\n the time of the challenged conduct,\u201d Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U. S.\n ___, ___, an exacting standard that \u201cgives government officials\n breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments,\u201d Ash-\n croft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___. The officers did not violate the\n Fourth Amendment when they opened Sheehan\u2019s door the first time,\n and there is no doubt that they could have opened her door the sec-\n ond time without violating her rights had Sheehan not been disabled.\n Their use of force was also reasonable. The only question therefore is\n whether they violated the Fourth Amendment when they decided to\n reopen Sheehan\u2019s door rather than attempt to accommodate her dis-\n ability. Because any such Fourth Amendment right, even assuming\n it exists, was not clearly established, Reynolds and Holder are enti-\n tled to qualified immunity. Likewise, an alleged failure on the part of\n the officers to follow their training does not itself negate qualified\n immunity where it would otherwise be warranted.

After reviewing the parties\u2019\nsubmissions, we dismiss the first question as improvidently\ngranted. We decide the second question and hold that\nthe officers are entitled to qualified immunity because\nthey did not violate any clearly established Fourth\nAmendment rights.\n                             I\n   Petitioners are the City and County of San Francisco,\nCalifornia (San Francisco), and two police officers, Ser-\ngeant Kimberly Reynolds and Officer Kathrine Holder.\nRespondent is Teresa Sheehan, a woman who suffers from\na schizoaffective disorder. Because this case arises in a\nsummary judgment posture, we view the facts in the light\nmost favorable to Sheehan, the nonmoving party. See,\ne.g., Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2014)\n(slip op., at 1\u20132).\n2          CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                       v. SHEEHAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n  In August 2008, Sheehan lived in a group home for\npeople dealing with mental illness. Although she shared\ncommon areas of the building with others, she had a pri-\nvate room. On August 7, Heath Hodge, a social worker\nwho supervised the counseling staff in the building, at-\ntempted to visit Sheehan to conduct a welfare check.\nHodge was concerned because Sheehan had stopped tak-\ning her medication, no longer spoke with her psychiatrist,\nand reportedly was no longer changing her clothes or\neating. See 743 F. 3d 1211, 1218 (CA9 2014); App. 23\u201324.\n  Hodge knocked on Sheehan\u2019s door but received no an-\nswer. He then used a key to enter her room and found\nSheehan on her bed. Initially, she would not respond to\nquestions. But she then sprang up, reportedly yelling,\n\u201cGet out of here! You don\u2019t have a warrant! I have a\nknife, and I\u2019ll kill you if I have to.\u201d Hodge left without\nseeing whether she actually had a knife, and Sheehan\nslammed the door shut behind him. See 743 F. 3d, at\n1218.\n  Sheehan, Hodge realized, required \u201csome sort of inter-\nvention,\u201d App. 96, but he also knew that he would need\nhelp. Hodge took steps to clear the building of other peo-\nple and completed an application to have Sheehan de-\ntained for temporary evaluation and treatment. See Cal.\nWelf. & Inst. Code Ann. \u00a75150 (West 2015 Cum. Supp.)\n(authorizing temporary detention of someone who \u201cas a\nresult of a mental health disorder, is a danger to others, or\nto himself or herself, or gravely disabled\u201d). On that appli-\ncation, Hodge checked off boxes indicating that Sheehan\nwas a \u201cthreat to others\u201d and \u201cgravely disabled,\u201d but he did\nnot mark that she was a danger to herself. 743 F. 3d, at\n1218. He telephoned the police and asked for help to take\nSheehan to a secure facility.\n  Officer Holder responded to police dispatch and headed\ntoward the group home. When she arrived, Holder re-\nviewed the temporary-detention application and spoke\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwith Hodge. Holder then sought assistance from Sergeant\nReynolds, a more experienced officer. After Reynolds\narrived and was brought up to speed, Hodge spoke with a\nnurse at the psychiatric emergency services unit at San\nFrancisco General Hospital who said that the hospital\nwould be able to admit Sheehan.\n  Accompanied by Hodge, the officers went to Sheehan\u2019s\nroom, knocked on her door, announced who they were, and\ntold Sheehan that \u201cwe want to help you.\u201d App. 36. When\nSheehan did not answer, the officers used Hodge\u2019s key to\nenter the room. Sheehan reacted violently. She grabbed a\nkitchen knife with an approximately 5-inch blade and\nbegan approaching the officers, yelling something along\nthe lines of \u201cI am going to kill you. I don\u2019t need help. Get\nout.\u201d Ibid. See also id., at 284 (\u201c[Q.] Did you tell them I\u2019ll\nkill you if you don\u2019t get out of here? A. Yes\u201d). The offic-\ners\u2014who did not have their weapons drawn\u2014\u201cretreated\nand Sheehan closed the door, leaving Sheehan in her room\nand the officers and Hodge in the hallway.\u201d 743 F. 3d, at\n1219. The officers called for backup and sent Hodge\ndownstairs to let in reinforcements when they arrived.\n  The officers were concerned that the door to Sheehan\u2019s\nroom was closed. They worried that Sheehan, out of their\nsight, might gather more weapons\u2014Reynolds had already\nobserved other knives in her room, see App. 228\u2014or even\ntry to flee through the back window, id., at 227. Because\nSheehan\u2019s room was on the second floor, she likely would\nhave needed a ladder to escape. Fire escapes, however,\nare common in San Francisco, and the officers did not\nknow whether Sheehan\u2019s room had such an escape. (Nei-\nther officer asked Hodge about a fire escape, but if they\nhad, it seems he \u201cprobably\u201d would have said there was\none, id., at 117). With the door closed, all that Reynolds\nand Holder knew for sure was that Sheehan was unstable,\nshe had just threatened to kill three people, and she had a\n4             CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                          v. SHEEHAN\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nweapon.1\n  Reynolds and Holder had to make a decision. They\ncould wait for backup\u2014indeed, they already heard sirens.\nOr they could quickly reenter the room and try to subdue\nSheehan before more time elapsed. Because Reynolds\nbelieved that the situation \u201crequired [their] immediate\nattention,\u201d id., at 235, the officers chose reentry. In mak-\ning that decision, they did not pause to consider whether\nSheehan\u2019s disability should be accommodated. See 743\nF. 3d, at 1219. The officers obviously knew that Sheehan\nwas unwell, but in Reynolds\u2019 words, that was \u201ca secondary\nissue\u201d given that they were \u201cfaced with a violent woman\nwho had already threatened to kill her social worker\u201d and\n\u201ctwo uniformed police officers.\u201d App. 235.\n  The officers ultimately decided that Holder\u2014the larger\nofficer\u2014should push the door open while Reynolds used\npepper spray on Sheehan. With pistols drawn, the officers\nmoved in. When Sheehan, knife in hand, saw them, she\nagain yelled for them to leave. She may also have again\nsaid that she was going to kill them. Sheehan is \u201cnot\nsure\u201d if she threatened death a second time, id., at 284,\nbut \u201cconcedes that it was her intent to resist arrest and to\nuse the knife,\u201d 743 F. 3d, at 1220. In any event, Reynolds\nbegan pepper-spraying Sheehan in the face, but Sheehan\nwould not drop the knife. When Sheehan was only a few\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The officers also may have feared that another person was with\n\nSheehan. Reynolds testified that the officers had not been \u201cable to do a\ncomplete assessment of the entire room.\u201d App. 38. Sheehan, by con-\ntrast, testified during a deposition that the officers \u201ccould see . . . that\nno one else was in the room.\u201d Id., at 279. Before the Ninth Circuit,\nSheehan conceded that some of her deposition testimony \u201csmacks of\nirrationality that begs the question whether any of it is credible.\u201d Brief\nfor Appellant in No. 11\u201316401 (CA9), p. 41; see also Reply Brief in No.\n11\u201316401, p. 17 (explaining that \u201cthe inherent inconsistences in her\ntestimony cast suspicion over all of it\u201d). We need not decide whether\nthere is a genuine dispute of fact here because the officers\u2019 other,\nindependent concerns make this point immaterial.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfeet away, Holder shot her twice, but she did not collapse.\nReynolds then fired multiple shots.2 After Sheehan finally\nfell, a third officer (who had just arrived) kicked the knife\nout of her hand. Sheehan survived.\n   Sometime later, San Francisco prosecuted Sheehan for\nassault with a deadly weapon, assault on a peace officer\nwith a deadly weapon, and making criminal threats. The\njury acquitted Sheehan of making threats but was unable\nto reach a verdict on the assault counts, and prosecutors\ndecided not to retry her.\n   Sheehan then brought suit, alleging, among other\nthings, that San Francisco violated the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 327, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a712101 et seq., by subduing her in a manner that did not\nreasonably accommodate her disability. She also sued\nReynolds and Holder in their personal capacities under\nRev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, for violating her\nFourth Amendment rights. In support of her claims, she\noffered testimony from a former deputy police chief, Lou\nReiter, who contended that Reynolds and Holder fell short\nof their training by not using practices designed to mini-\nmize the risk of violence when dealing with the mentally\nill.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for\npetitioners. Relying on Hainze v. Richards, 207 F. 3d 795\n(CA5 2000), the court held that officers making an arrest\nare not required \u201cto first determine whether their actions\nwould comply with the ADA before protecting themselves\nand others.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 80. The court also held\nthat the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nThe court wrote that the officers \u201chad no way of knowing\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 There  is a dispute regarding whether Sheehan was on the ground\nfor the last shot. This dispute is not material: \u201cEven if Sheehan was on\nthe ground, she was certainly not subdued.\u201d 743 F. 3d 1211, 1230 (CA9\n2014).\n6          CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                       v. SHEEHAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether [Sheehan] might escape through a back window\nor fire escape, whether she might hurt herself, or whether\nthere was anyone else in her room whom she might hurt.\u201d\nId., at 71. In addition, the court observed that Holder did\nnot begin shooting until it was necessary for her to do so in\norder \u201cto protect herself \u201d and that \u201cReynolds used deadly\nforce only after she found that pepper spray was not\nenough force to contain the situation.\u201d Id., at 75, 76\u201377.\n  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit vacated in part. Relevant\nhere, the panel held that because the ADA covers public\n\u201cservices, programs, or activities,\u201d \u00a712132, the ADA\u2019s\naccommodation requirement should be read to \u201cto encom-\npass \u2018anything a public entity does,\u2019 \u201d 743 F. 3d, at 1232.\nThe Ninth Circuit agreed \u201cthat exigent circumstances\ninform the reasonableness analysis under the ADA,\u201d ibid.,\nbut concluded that it was for a jury to decide whether San\nFrancisco should have accommodated Sheehan by, for\ninstance, \u201crespect[ing] her comfort zone, engag[ing] in non-\nthreatening communications and us[ing] the passage of\ntime to defuse the situation rather than precipitating a\ndeadly confrontation.\u201d Id., at 1233.\n  As to Reynolds and Holder, the panel held that their\ninitial entry into Sheehan\u2019s room was lawful and that,\nafter the officers opened the door for the second time, they\nreasonably used their firearms when the pepper spray\nfailed to stop Sheehan\u2019s advance. Nonetheless, the panel\nalso held that a jury could find that the officers \u201cprovoked\u201d\nSheehan by needlessly forcing that second confrontation.\nId., at 1216, 1229. The panel further found that it was\nclearly established that an officer cannot \u201cforcibly enter\nthe home of an armed, mentally ill subject who had been\nacting irrationally and had threatened anyone who en-\ntered when there was no objective need for immediate\nentry.\u201d Id., at 1229. Dissenting in part, Judge Graber\nwould have held that the officers were entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

We\ngranted the petition. 574 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                              II\n   Title II of the ADA commands that \u201cno qualified indi-\nvidual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability,\nbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits\nof the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or\nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a712132. The first question on which we granted\nreview asks whether this provision \u201crequires law enforce-\nment officers to provide accommodations to an armed,\nviolent, and mentally ill suspect in the course of bringing\nthe suspect into custody.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. When we\ngranted review, we understood this question to embody\nwhat appears to be the thrust of the argument that San\nFrancisco made in the Ninth Circuit, namely that \u201c \u2018Title II\ndoes not apply to an officer\u2019s on-the-street responses to\nreported disturbances or other similar incidents, whether\nor not those calls involve subjects with mental disabilities,\nprior to the officer\u2019s securing the scene and ensuring that\nthere is no threat to human life.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Appellees in\nNo. 11\u201316401 (CA9), p. 36 (quoting Hainze, supra, at 801;\nemphasis added); see also Brief for Appellees in No. 11\u2013\n16401, at 37 (similar).\n   As San Francisco explained in its reply brief at the\ncertiorari stage, resolving its \u201cquestion presented\u201d \u201cdoes\nnot require a fact-intensive \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019\ninquiry,\u201d since \u201cthe only question for this Court to resolve\nis whether any accommodation of an armed and violent\nindividual is reasonable or required under Title II of the\nADA.\u201d Reply to Brief in Opposition 3.\n   Having persuaded us to grant certiorari, San Francisco\nchose to rely on a different argument than what it pressed\nbelow.

Putting these authorities together, San Fran-\ncisco argues that \u201ca person who poses a direct threat or\nsignificant risk to the safety of others is not qualified for\naccommodations under the ADA,\u201d Brief for Petitioners 17.\nContending that Sheehan clearly posed a \u201cdirect threat,\u201d\nSan Francisco concludes that she was therefore not \u201cquali-\nfied\u201d for an accommodation.\n   Though, to be sure, this \u201cqualified\u201d argument does ap-\npear in San Francisco\u2019s certiorari petition, San Francisco\nnever hinted at it in the Ninth Circuit. The Court does\nnot ordinarily decide questions that were not passed on\nbelow. More than that, San Francisco\u2019s new argument\neffectively concedes that the relevant provision of the\nADA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a712132, may \u201crequir[e] law enforcement\nofficers to provide accommodations to an armed, violent,\nand mentally ill suspect in the course of bringing the\nsuspect into custody.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. This is so because\nthere may be circumstances in which any \u201csignificant risk\u201d\npresented by \u201can armed, violent, and mentally ill suspect\u201d\ncan be \u201celiminated by a modification of policies, practices\nor procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or\nservices.\u201d\n   The argument that San Francisco now advances is\npredicated on the proposition that the ADA governs the\nmanner in which a qualified individual with a disability is\narrested. The relevant provision provides that a public\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nentity may not \u201cexclud[e]\u201d a qualified individual with a\ndisability from \u201cparticipat[ing] in,\u201d and may not \u201cden[y]\u201d\nthat individual the \u201cbenefits of[,] the services, programs,\nor activities of a public entity.\u201d \u00a712132. This language\nwould apply to an arrest if an arrest is an \u201cactivity\u201d in\nwhich the arrestee \u201cparticipat[es]\u201d or from which the\narrestee may \u201cbenefi[t].\u201d\n   This same provision also commands that \u201cno qualified\nindividual with a disability shall be . . . subjected to dis-\ncrimination by any [public] entity.\u201d Ibid. This part of the\nstatute would apply to an arrest if the failure to arrest an\nindividual with a mental disability in a manner that\nreasonably accommodates that disability constitutes \u201cdis-\ncrimination.\u201d Ibid.\n   Whether the statutory language quoted above applies to\narrests is an important question that would benefit from\nbriefing and an adversary presentation. But San Fran-\ncisco, the United States as amicus curiae, and Sheehan all\nargue (or at least accept) that \u00a712132 applies to arrests.\nNo one argues the contrary view. As a result, we do not\nthink that it would be prudent to decide the question in\nthis case.\n   Our decision not to decide whether the ADA applies to\narrests is reinforced by the parties\u2019 failure to address a\nrelated question: whether a public entity can be liable for\ndamages under Title II for an arrest made by its police\nofficers. Only public entities are subject to Title II, see,\ne.g., Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S.\n206, 208 (1998), and the parties agree that such an entity\ncan be held vicariously liable for money damages for the\npurposeful or deliberately indifferent conduct of its em-\nployees. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\u201312, 22. But we have\nnever decided whether that is correct, and we decline to do\nso here, in the absence of adversarial briefing.\n   Because certiorari jurisdiction exists to clarify the law,\nits exercise \u201cis not a matter of right, but of judicial discre-\n10           CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                         v. SHEEHAN\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion.\u201d Supreme Court Rule 10. Exercising that discretion,\nwe dismiss the first question presented as improvidently\ngranted. See, e.g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v.\nGarrett, 531 U. S. 356, 360, n. 1 (2001) (partial dismissal);\nParker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 323 (1991) (same).\n                             III\n   The second question presented is whether Reynolds and\nHolder can be held personally liable for the injuries that\nSheehan suffered. We conclude they are entitled to quali-\nfied immunity.3\n   Public officials are immune from suit under 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71983 unless they have \u201cviolated a statutory or constitu-\ntional right that was clearly established at the time of the\nchallenged conduct.\u201d Plumhoff, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12) (internal quotation marks omitted). An officer\n\u201ccannot be said to have violated a clearly established right\nunless the right\u2019s contours were sufficiently definite that\nany reasonable official in [his] shoes would have under-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Not satisfied with dismissing question one, which concerns San\n\nFrancisco\u2019s liability, our dissenting colleagues would further punish\nSan Francisco by dismissing question two as well. See post, at 3\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.) (arguing that deciding the second question would\n\u201creward\u201d San Francisco and \u201cspar[e it] the significant expense of\ndefending the suit, and satisfying any judgment, against the individual\npetitioners\u201d). But question two concerns the liability of the individual\nofficers. Whatever contractual obligations San Francisco may (or may\nnot) have to represent and indemnify the officers are not our concern.\nAt a minimum, these officers have a personal interest in the correctness\nof the judgment below, which holds that they may have violated the\nConstitution. Moreover, when we granted the petition, we determined\nthat both questions independently merited review. Because of the\nimportance of qualified immunity \u201cto society as a whole,\u201d Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 814 (1982), the Court often corrects lower\ncourts when they wrongly subject individual officers to liability. See,\ne.g., Carroll v. Carman, 574 U. S. ___ (2014) (per curiam); Wood v.\nMoss, 572 U. S. ___ (2014); Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U. S. ___ (2014);\nStanton v. Sims, 571 U. S. ___ (2013) (per curiam); Reichle v. Howards,\n566 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstood that he was violating it,\u201d ibid., meaning that \u201cexist-\ning precedent . . . placed the statutory or constitutional\nquestion beyond debate.\u201d Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9). This exacting standard\n\u201cgives government officials breathing room to make rea-\nsonable but mistaken judgments\u201d by \u201cprotect[ing] all but\nthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate\nthe law.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n   In this case, although we disagree with the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the question of qualified\nimmunity, we agree with its analysis in many respects.\nFor instance, there is no doubt that the officers did not\nviolate any federal right when they opened Sheehan\u2019s door\nthe first time. See 743 F. 3d, at 1216, 1223. Reynolds and\nHolder knocked on the door, announced that they were\npolice officers, and informed Sheehan that they wanted to\nhelp her. When Sheehan did not come to the door, they\nentered her room. This was not unconstitutional. \u201c[L]aw\nenforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant\nto render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or\nto protect an occupant from imminent injury.\u201d Brigham\nCity v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006). See also Ken-\ntucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6).\n   Nor is there any doubt that had Sheehan not been dis-\nabled, the officers could have opened her door the second\ntime without violating any constitutional rights. For one\nthing, \u201cbecause the two entries were part of a single,\ncontinuous search or seizure, the officers [were] not re-\nquired to justify the continuing emergency with respect to\nthe second entry.\u201d 743 F. 3d, at 1224 (following Michigan\nv. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499, 511 (1978)). In addition, Reynolds\nand Holder knew that Sheehan had a weapon and had\nthreatened to use it to kill three people. They also knew\nthat delay could make the situation more dangerous. The\nFourth Amendment standard is reasonableness, and it is\nreasonable for police to move quickly if delay \u201cwould\n12         CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                       v. SHEEHAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\ngravely endanger their lives or the lives of others.\u201d War-\nden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298\u2013299\n(1967). This is true even when, judged with the benefit of\nhindsight, the officers may have made \u201csome mistakes.\u201d\nHeien v. North Carolina, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op.,\nat 5). The Constitution is not blind to \u201cthe fact that police\nofficers are often forced to make split-second judgments.\u201d\nPlumhoff, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8).\n   We also agree with the Ninth Circuit that after the\nofficers opened Sheehan\u2019s door the second time, their use\nof force was reasonable.         Reynolds tried to subdue\nSheehan with pepper spray, but Sheehan kept coming at\nthe officers until she was \u201conly a few feet from a cornered\nOfficer Holder.\u201d 743 F. 3d, at 1229. At this point, the use\nof potentially deadly force was justified. See Scott v.\nHarris, 550 U. S. 372, 384 (2007). Nothing in the Fourth\nAmendment barred Reynolds and Holder from protecting\nthemselves, even though it meant firing multiple rounds.\nSee Plumhoff, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11).\n   The real question, then, is whether, despite these dan-\ngerous circumstances, the officers violated the Fourth\nAmendment when they decided to reopen Sheehan\u2019s door\nrather than attempting to accommodate her disability.\nHere we come to another problem. San Francisco, whose\nattorneys represent Reynolds and Holder, devotes scant\nbriefing to this question. Instead, San Francisco argues\nalmost exclusively that even if it is assumed that there\nwas a Fourth Amendment violation, the right was not\nclearly established. This Court, of course, could decide the\nconstitutional question anyway. See Pearson v. Callahan,\n555 U. S. 223, 242 (2009) (recognizing discretion). But\nbecause this question has not been adequately briefed, we\ndecline to do so. See id., at 239. Rather, we simply decide\nwhether the officers\u2019 failure to accommodate Sheehan\u2019s\nillness violated clearly established law. It did not.\n   To begin, nothing in our cases suggests the constitu-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional rule applied by the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit\nfocused on Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989), but\nGraham holds only that the \u201c \u2018objective reasonableness\u2019 \u201d\ntest applies to excessive-force claims under the Fourth\nAmendment. See id., at 388. That is far too general a\nproposition to control this case. \u201cWe have repeatedly told\ncourts\u2014and the Ninth Circuit in particular\u2014not to define\nclearly established law at a high level of generality.\u201d al-\nKidd, supra, at ___ (citation omitted) (slip op., at 10); cf.\nLopez v. Smith, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip\nop., at 5). Qualified immunity is no immunity at all if\n\u201cclearly established\u201d law can simply be defined as the\nright to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n   Even a cursory glance at the facts of Graham confirms\njust how different that case is from this one. That case did\nnot involve a dangerous, obviously unstable person mak-\ning threats, much less was there a weapon involved.\nThere is a world of difference between needlessly with-\nholding sugar from an innocent person who is suffering\nfrom an insulin reaction, see Graham, supra, at 388\u2013389,\nand responding to the perilous situation Reynolds and\nHolder confronted. Graham is a nonstarter.\n   Moving beyond Graham, the Ninth Circuit also turned\nto two of its own cases. But even if \u201ca controlling circuit\nprecedent could constitute clearly established federal law\nin these circumstances,\u201d Carroll v. Carman, 574 U. S. ___,\n___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4), it does not do so\nhere.\n   The Ninth Circuit first pointed to Deorle v. Rutherford,\n272 F. 3d 1272 (CA9 2001), but from the very first para-\ngraph of that opinion we learn that Deorle involved an\nofficer\u2019s use of a beanbag gun to subdue \u201can emotionally\ndisturbed\u201d person who \u201cwas unarmed, had not attacked or\neven touched anyone, had generally obeyed the instruc-\ntions given him by various police officers, and had not\ncommitted any serious offense.\u201d Id., at 1275. The officer\n14            CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                          v. SHEEHAN\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthere, moreover, \u201cobserved Deorle at close proximity for\nabout five to ten minutes before shooting him\u201d in the face.\nSee id., at 1281. Whatever the merits of the decision in\nDeorle, the differences between that case and the case\nbefore us leap from the page. Unlike Deorle, Sheehan was\ndangerous, recalcitrant, law-breaking, and out of sight.\n   The Ninth Circuit also leaned on Alexander v. City and\nCounty of San Francisco, 29 F. 3d 1355 (CA9 1994), an-\nother case involving mental illness. There, officials from\nSan Francisco attempted to enter Henry Quade\u2019s home\n\u201cfor the primary purpose of arresting him\u201d even though\nthey lacked an arrest warrant. Id., at 1361. Quade, in\nresponse, fired a handgun; police officers \u201cshot back, and\nQuade died from gunshot wounds shortly thereafter.\u201d Id.,\nat 1358. The panel concluded that a jury should decide\nwhether the officers used excessive force. The court rea-\nsoned that the officers provoked the confrontation because\nthere were no \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d excusing their\nentrance. Id., at 1361.\n   Alexander too is a poor fit. As Judge Graber observed\nbelow in her dissent, the Ninth Circuit has long read\nAlexander narrowly. See 743 F. 3d, at 1235 (Graber, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Billing-\nton v. Smith, 292 F. 3d 1177 (CA9 2002)). Under Ninth\nCircuit law,4 an entry that otherwise complies with the\nFourth Amendment is not rendered unreasonable because\nit provokes a violent reaction. See id., at 1189\u20131190.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Our citation to Ninth Circuit cases should not be read to suggest our\n\nagreement (or, for that matter, disagreement) with them. The Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s \u201cprovocation\u201d rule, for instance, has been sharply questioned\nelsewhere. See Livermore v. Lubelan, 476 F. 3d 397, 406\u2013407 (CA6\n2007); see also, e.g., Hector v. Watt, 235 F. 3d 154, 160 (CA3 2001) (\u201c[I]f\nthe officers\u2019 use of force was reasonable given the plaintiff\u2019s acts, then\ndespite the illegal entry, the plaintiff\u2019s own conduct would be an inter-\nvening cause\u201d). Whatever their merits, all that matters for our quali-\nfied immunity analysis is that they do not clearly establish any right\nthat the officers violated.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnder this rule, qualified immunity necessarily applies\nhere because, as explained above, competent officers could\nhave believed that the second entry was justified under\nboth continuous search and exigent circumstance ration-\nales. Indeed, even if Reynolds and Holder misjudged the\nsituation, Sheehan cannot \u201cestablish a Fourth Amend-\nment violation based merely on bad tactics that result in a\ndeadly confrontation that could have been avoided.\u201d Id.,\nat 1190. Courts must not judge officers with \u201cthe 20/20\nvision of hindsight.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Graham, 490 U. S., at\n396).\n   When Graham, Deorle, and Alexander are viewed to-\ngether, the central error in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning\nis apparent. The panel majority concluded that these\nthree cases \u201cwould have placed any reasonable, competent\nofficer on notice that it is unreasonable to forcibly enter\nthe home of an armed, mentally ill suspect who had been\nacting irrationally and had threatened anyone who en-\ntered when there was no objective need for immediate\nentry.\u201d 743 F. 3d, at 1229. But even assuming that is\ntrue, no precedent clearly established that there was not\n\u201can objective need for immediate entry\u201d here. No matter\nhow carefully a reasonable officer read Graham, Deorle,\nand Alexander beforehand, that officer could not know\nthat reopening Sheehan\u2019s door to prevent her from escap-\ning or gathering more weapons would violate the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s test, even if all the disputed facts are viewed in\nrespondent\u2019s favor. Without that \u201cfair notice,\u201d an officer is\nentitled to qualified immunity. See, e.g., Plumhoff, 572\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n   Nor does it matter for purposes of qualified immunity\nthat Sheehan\u2019s expert, Reiter, testified that the officers\ndid not follow their training. According to Reiter, San\nFrancisco trains its officers when dealing with the mentally\nill to \u201censure that sufficient resources are brought to the\nscene,\u201d \u201ccontain the subject\u201d and \u201crespect the suspect\u2019s\n16          CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                        v.

Likewise, San Fran-\ncisco\u2019s policy is \u201c \u2018to use hostage negotiators\u2019 \u201d when dealing\nwith \u201c \u2018a suspect [who] resists arrest by barricading him-\nself.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 8 (quoting San Francisco Police Department\nGeneral Order 8.02, \u00a7II(B) (Aug. 3, 1994), online at\nhttp://www.sf-police.org (as visited May 14, 2015, and\navailable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file)).\n   Even if an officer acts contrary to her training, however,\n(and here, given the generality of that training, it is not at\nall clear that Reynolds and Holder did so), that does not\nitself negate qualified immunity where it would otherwise\nbe warranted. Rather, so long as \u201ca reasonable officer\ncould have believed that his conduct was justified,\u201d a\nplaintiff cannot \u201cavoi[d] summary judgment by simply\nproducing an expert\u2019s report that an officer\u2019s conduct\nleading up to a deadly confrontation was imprudent,\ninappropriate, or even reckless.\u201d Billington, supra, at\n1189. Cf. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 216, n. 6 (2001)\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201c \u2018[I]n close cases,\na jury does not automatically get to second-guess these life\nand death decisions, even though a plaintiff has an expert\nand a plausible claim that the situation could better have\nbeen handled differently\u2019 \u201d (quoting Roy v. Inhabitants of\nLewiston, 42 F. 3d 691, 695 (CA1 1994))). Considering the\nspecific situation confronting Reynolds and Holder, they\nhad sufficient reason to believe that their conduct was\njustified.\n   Finally, to the extent that a \u201crobust consensus of cases\nof persuasive authority\u201d could itself clearly establish the\nfederal right respondent alleges, al-Kidd, 563 U.

See Appellees\u2019 Answering Brief in No.\n11\u201316401 (CA9), pp. 35\u201337 (\u201c[T]he ADA does not apply to\npolice officers\u2019 responses to violent individuals who happen\nto be mentally ill, where officers have not yet brought the\nviolent situation under control\u201d).\n  Imagine our surprise, then, when the petitioners\u2019 prin-\ncipal brief, reply brief, and oral argument had nary a word\n2          CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                            v. SHEEHAN\n        SCALIA, J., concurring\n                        Opinion inof\n                                   part and,dissenting\n                                     SCALIA J.         in part\n\nto say about that subject. Instead, petitioners bluntly\nannounced in their principal brief that they \u201cdo not assert\nthat the actions of individual police officers [in arresting\nviolent and armed disabled persons] are never subject to\nscrutiny under Title II,\u201d and proclaimed that \u201c[t]he only\nADA issue here is what Title II requires of individual\nofficers who are facing an armed and dangerous suspect.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioners 34 (emphasis added). In other words,\nthe issue is not (as the petition had asserted) whether Title\nII applies to arrests of violent, mentally ill individuals, but\nrather how it applies under the circumstances of this case,\nwhere the plaintiff threatened officers with a weapon. We\nwere thus deprived of the opportunity to consider, and\nsettle, a controverted question of law that has divided the\nCircuits, and were invited instead to decide an ADA ques-\ntion that has relevance only if we assume the Ninth Cir-\ncuit correctly resolved the antecedent, unargued question\non which we granted certiorari. The Court is correct to\ndismiss the first QP as improvidently granted.\n   Why, one might ask, would a petitioner take a position\non a Circuit split that it had no intention of arguing, or at\nleast was so little keen to argue that it cast the argument\naside uninvited? The answer is simple. Petitioners in-\ncluded that issue to induce us to grant certiorari. As the\nCourt rightly observes, there are numerous reasons why\nwe would not have agreed to hear petitioners\u2019 first QP if\ntheir petition for certiorari presented it in the same form\nthat it was argued on the merits. See ante, at 7\u201310. But it\nis also true that there was little chance that we would\nhave taken this case to decide only the second, fact-bound\nQP\u2014that is, whether the individual petitioners are en-\ntitled to qualified immunity on respondent\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment claim.\n   This Court\u2019s Rule 10, entitled \u201cConsiderations Govern-\ning Review on Certiorari,\u201d says that certiorari will be\ngranted \u201conly for compelling reasons,\u201d which include the\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

The Rule concludes: \u201cA petition for a writ of\ncertiorari is rarely granted when the asserted error con-\nsists of erroneous factual findings or the misapplication of\na properly stated rule of law.\u201d The second QP implicates,\nat most, the latter. It is unlikely that we would have\ngranted certiorari on that question alone.\n   But (and here is what lies beneath the present case)\nwhen we do grant certiorari on a question for which there\nis a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d for our review, we often also grant\ncertiorari on attendant questions that are not inde-\npendently \u201ccertworthy,\u201d but that are sufficiently connected\nto the ultimate disposition of the case that the efficient\nadministration of justice supports their consideration. In\nother words, by promising argument on the Circuit conflict\nthat their first question presented, petitioners got us to\ngrant certiorari not only on the first question but also on\nthe second.\n   I would not reward such bait-and-switch tactics by\nproceeding to decide the independently \u201cuncertworthy\u201d\nsecond question. And make no mistake about it: Today\u2019s\njudgment is a reward. It gives the individual petitioners\nall that they seek, and spares San Francisco the signifi-\ncant expense of defending the suit, and satisfying any\njudgment, against the individual petitioners.* I would not\nencourage future litigants to seek review premised on\narguments they never plan to press, secure in the\nknowledge that once they find a toehold on this Court\u2019s\ndocket, we will consider whatever workaday arguments\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * San Francisco will still be subject to liability under the ADA if the\ntrial court determines that the facts demanded accommodation. The\nCourt of Appeals vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment that the ADA\nwas inapplicable to police arrests of violent and armed disabled per-\nsons, and remanded for the accommodation determination.\n4          CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                            v.

To be sure, ex post\u2014after\nthe Court has improvidently decided the uncertworthy\nquestion\u2014it appears that refusal to reverse the judgment\nbelow would have left a wrong unrighted. Ex ante, how-\never\u2014before we considered and deliberated upon the second\nQP but after petitioners\u2019 principal brief made clear that\nthey would not address the Circuit conflict presented by\nthe first QP\u2014we had no more assurance that this question\nwas decided incorrectly than we do for the thousands of\nother uncertworthy questions we refuse to hear each\nTerm. Many of them have undoubtedly been decided\nwrongly, but we are not, and for well over a century have\nnot been, a court of error correction. The fair course\u2014the\njust course\u2014is to treat this now-nakedly uncertworthy\nquestion the way we treat all others: by declining to decide\nit. In fact, there is in this case an even greater reason to\ndecline: to avoid being snookered, and to deter future\nsnookering.\n   Because I agree with the Court that \u201ccertiorari jurisdic-\ntion exists to clarify the law,\u201d ante, at 9 (emphasis added),\nI would dismiss both questions presented as improvidently\ngranted.\n",

Argued March 23, 2015\u2014Decided May 18, 2015\nRespondent Sheehan lived in a group home for individuals with mental\n  illness. After Sheehan began acting erratically and threatened to kill\n  her social worker, the City and County of San Francisco (San Fran-\n  cisco) dispatched police officers Reynolds and Holder to help escort\n  Sheehan to a facility for temporary evaluation and treatment. When\n  the officers first entered Sheehan\u2019s room, she grabbed a knife and\n  threatened to kill them. They retreated and closed the door. Con-\n  cerned about what Sheehan might do behind the closed door, and\n  without considering if they could accommodate her disability, the of-\n  ficers reentered her room. Sheehan, knife in hand, again confronted\n  them. After pepper spray proved ineffective, the officers shot\n  Sheehan multiple times. Sheehan later sued petitioner San Francis-\n  co for, among other things, violating Title II of the Americans with\n  Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) by arresting her without accommodat-\n  ing her disability. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a712132. She also sued petitioners\n  Reynolds and Holder in their personal capacities under 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71983, claiming that they violated her Fourth Amendment rights.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment because it concluded\n  that officers making an arrest are not required to determine whether\n  their actions would comply with the ADA before protecting them-\n  selves and others, and also that Reynolds and Holder did not violate\n  the Constitution. Vacating in part, the Ninth Circuit held that the\n  ADA applied and that a jury must decide whether San Francisco\n  should have accommodated Sheehan.

The question whether \u00a712132 \u201crequires law enforcement officers\n to provide accommodations to an armed, violent, and mentally ill\n suspect in the course of bringing the suspect into custody,\u201d Pet. for\n Cert. i, is dismissed as improvidently granted. Certiorari was grant-\n ed on the understanding that San Francisco would argue that Title II\n of the ADA does not apply when an officer faces an armed and dan-\n gerous individual. Instead, San Francisco merely argues that\n Sheehan was not \u201cqualified\u201d for an accommodation, \u00a712132, because\n she \u201cpose[d] a direct threat to the health or safety of others,\u201d which\n threat could not \u201cbe eliminated by a modification of policies, practices\n or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services,\u201d 28\n CFR \u00a7\u00a735.139(a), 35.104. This argument was not passed on by the\n court below. The decision to dismiss this question as improvidently\n granted, moreover, is reinforced by the parties\u2019 failure to address the\n related question whether a public entity can be vicariously liable for\n damages under Title II for an arrest made by its police officers.\n Pp. 7\u201310.\n    2. Reynolds and Holder are entitled to qualified immunity from lia-\n bility for the injuries suffered by Sheehan. Public officials are im-\n mune from suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 unless they have \u201cviolated a\n statutory or constitutional right that was \u2018 \u201c \u2018clearly established\u2019 \u201d \u2019 at\n the time of the challenged conduct,\u201d Plumhoff v.

S. ___, ___. The officers did not violate the\n Fourth Amendment when they opened Sheehan\u2019s door the first time,\n and there is no doubt that they could have opened her door the sec-\n ond time without violating her rights had Sheehan not been disabled.\n Their use of force was also reasonable. The only question therefore is\n whether they violated the Fourth Amendment when they decided to\n reopen Sheehan\u2019s door rather than attempt to accommodate her dis-\n ability. Because any such Fourth Amendment right, even assuming\n it exists, was not clearly established, Reynolds and Holder are enti-\n tled to qualified immunity. Likewise, an alleged failure on the part of\n the officers to follow their training does not itself negate qualified\n immunity where it would otherwise be warranted.

After reviewing the parties\u2019\nsubmissions, we dismiss the first question as improvidently\ngranted.

Because this case arises in a\nsummary judgment posture, we view the facts in the light\nmost favorable to Sheehan, the nonmoving party. See,\ne.g., Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2014)\n(slip op., at 1\u20132).\n2          CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                       v. SHEEHAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n  In August 2008, Sheehan lived in a group home for\npeople dealing with mental illness. Although she shared\ncommon areas of the building with others, she had a pri-\nvate room. On August 7, Heath Hodge, a social worker\nwho supervised the counseling staff in the building, at-\ntempted to visit Sheehan to conduct a welfare check.\nHodge was concerned because Sheehan had stopped tak-\ning her medication, no longer spoke with her psychiatrist,\nand reportedly was no longer changing her clothes or\neating. See 743 F. 3d 1211, 1218 (CA9 2014); App. 23\u201324.\n  Hodge knocked on Sheehan\u2019s door but received no an-\nswer. He then used a key to enter her room and found\nSheehan on her bed. Initially, she would not respond to\nquestions. But she then sprang up, reportedly yelling,\n\u201cGet out of here! You don\u2019t have a warrant! I have a\nknife, and I\u2019ll kill you if I have to.\u201d Hodge left without\nseeing whether she actually had a knife, and Sheehan\nslammed the door shut behind him. See 743 F. 3d, at\n1218.\n  Sheehan, Hodge realized, required \u201csome sort of inter-\nvention,\u201d App. 96, but he also knew that he would need\nhelp. Hodge took steps to clear the building of other peo-\nple and completed an application to have Sheehan de-\ntained for temporary evaluation and treatment. See Cal.\nWelf. & Inst. Code Ann. \u00a75150 (West 2015 Cum. Supp.)\n(authorizing temporary detention of someone who \u201cas a\nresult of a mental health disorder, is a danger to others, or\nto himself or herself, or gravely disabled\u201d). On that appli-\ncation, Hodge checked off boxes indicating that Sheehan\nwas a \u201cthreat to others\u201d and \u201cgravely disabled,\u201d but he did\nnot mark that she was a danger to herself. 743 F. 3d, at\n1218. He telephoned the police and asked for help to take\nSheehan to a secure facility.\n  Officer Holder responded to police dispatch and headed\ntoward the group home. When she arrived, Holder re-\nviewed the temporary-detention application and spoke\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwith Hodge. Holder then sought assistance from Sergeant\nReynolds, a more experienced officer. After Reynolds\narrived and was brought up to speed, Hodge spoke with a\nnurse at the psychiatric emergency services unit at San\nFrancisco General Hospital who said that the hospital\nwould be able to admit Sheehan.\n  Accompanied by Hodge, the officers went to Sheehan\u2019s\nroom, knocked on her door, announced who they were, and\ntold Sheehan that \u201cwe want to help you.\u201d App. 36. When\nSheehan did not answer, the officers used Hodge\u2019s key to\nenter the room. Sheehan reacted violently. She grabbed a\nkitchen knife with an approximately 5-inch blade and\nbegan approaching the officers, yelling something along\nthe lines of \u201cI am going to kill you. I don\u2019t need help. Get\nout.\u201d Ibid. See also id., at 284 (\u201c[Q.] Did you tell them I\u2019ll\nkill you if you don\u2019t get out of here? A. Yes\u201d). The offic-\ners\u2014who did not have their weapons drawn\u2014\u201cretreated\nand Sheehan closed the door, leaving Sheehan in her room\nand the officers and Hodge in the hallway.\u201d 743 F. 3d, at\n1219. The officers called for backup and sent Hodge\ndownstairs to let in reinforcements when they arrived.\n  The officers were concerned that the door to Sheehan\u2019s\nroom was closed. They worried that Sheehan, out of their\nsight, might gather more weapons\u2014Reynolds had already\nobserved other knives in her room, see App. 228\u2014or even\ntry to flee through the back window, id., at 227. Because\nSheehan\u2019s room was on the second floor, she likely would\nhave needed a ladder to escape. Fire escapes, however,\nare common in San Francisco, and the officers did not\nknow whether Sheehan\u2019s room had such an escape. (Nei-\nther officer asked Hodge about a fire escape, but if they\nhad, it seems he \u201cprobably\u201d would have said there was\none, id., at 117). With the door closed, all that Reynolds\nand Holder knew for sure was that Sheehan was unstable,\nshe had just threatened to kill three people, and she had a\n4             CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                          v. SHEEHAN\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nweapon.1\n  Reynolds and Holder had to make a decision. They\ncould wait for backup\u2014indeed, they already heard sirens.\nOr they could quickly reenter the room and try to subdue\nSheehan before more time elapsed. Because Reynolds\nbelieved that the situation \u201crequired [their] immediate\nattention,\u201d id., at 235, the officers chose reentry. In mak-\ning that decision, they did not pause to consider whether\nSheehan\u2019s disability should be accommodated. See 743\nF. 3d, at 1219. The officers obviously knew that Sheehan\nwas unwell, but in Reynolds\u2019 words, that was \u201ca secondary\nissue\u201d given that they were \u201cfaced with a violent woman\nwho had already threatened to kill her social worker\u201d and\n\u201ctwo uniformed police officers.\u201d App. 235.\n  The officers ultimately decided that Holder\u2014the larger\nofficer\u2014should push the door open while Reynolds used\npepper spray on Sheehan. With pistols drawn, the officers\nmoved in. When Sheehan, knife in hand, saw them, she\nagain yelled for them to leave. She may also have again\nsaid that she was going to kill them. Sheehan is \u201cnot\nsure\u201d if she threatened death a second time, id., at 284,\nbut \u201cconcedes that it was her intent to resist arrest and to\nuse the knife,\u201d 743 F. 3d, at 1220. In any event, Reynolds\nbegan pepper-spraying Sheehan in the face, but Sheehan\nwould not drop the knife. When Sheehan was only a few\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The officers also may have feared that another person was with\n\nSheehan. Reynolds testified that the officers had not been \u201cable to do a\ncomplete assessment of the entire room.\u201d App. 38. Sheehan, by con-\ntrast, testified during a deposition that the officers \u201ccould see . . . that\nno one else was in the room.\u201d Id., at 279. Before the Ninth Circuit,\nSheehan conceded that some of her deposition testimony \u201csmacks of\nirrationality that begs the question whether any of it is credible.\u201d Brief\nfor Appellant in No. 11\u201316401 (CA9), p. 41; see also Reply Brief in No.\n11\u201316401, p. 17 (explaining that \u201cthe inherent inconsistences in her\ntestimony cast suspicion over all of it\u201d). We need not decide whether\nthere is a genuine dispute of fact here because the officers\u2019 other,\nindependent concerns make this point immaterial.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfeet away, Holder shot her twice, but she did not collapse.\nReynolds then fired multiple shots.2 After Sheehan finally\nfell, a third officer (who had just arrived) kicked the knife\nout of her hand. Sheehan survived.\n   Sometime later, San Francisco prosecuted Sheehan for\nassault with a deadly weapon, assault on a peace officer\nwith a deadly weapon, and making criminal threats. The\njury acquitted Sheehan of making threats but was unable\nto reach a verdict on the assault counts, and prosecutors\ndecided not to retry her.\n   Sheehan then brought suit, alleging, among other\nthings, that San Francisco violated the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 327, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a712101 et seq., by subduing her in a manner that did not\nreasonably accommodate her disability. She also sued\nReynolds and Holder in their personal capacities under\nRev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, for violating her\nFourth Amendment rights. In support of her claims, she\noffered testimony from a former deputy police chief, Lou\nReiter, who contended that Reynolds and Holder fell short\nof their training by not using practices designed to mini-\nmize the risk of violence when dealing with the mentally\nill.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for\npetitioners. Relying on Hainze v. Richards, 207 F. 3d 795\n(CA5 2000), the court held that officers making an arrest\nare not required \u201cto first determine whether their actions\nwould comply with the ADA before protecting themselves\nand others.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 80. The court also held\nthat the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nThe court wrote that the officers \u201chad no way of knowing\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 There  is a dispute regarding whether Sheehan was on the ground\nfor the last shot. This dispute is not material: \u201cEven if Sheehan was on\nthe ground, she was certainly not subdued.\u201d 743 F. 3d 1211, 1230 (CA9\n2014).\n6          CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                       v. SHEEHAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether [Sheehan] might escape through a back window\nor fire escape, whether she might hurt herself, or whether\nthere was anyone else in her room whom she might hurt.\u201d\nId., at 71. In addition, the court observed that Holder did\nnot begin shooting until it was necessary for her to do so in\norder \u201cto protect herself \u201d and that \u201cReynolds used deadly\nforce only after she found that pepper spray was not\nenough force to contain the situation.\u201d Id., at 75, 76\u201377.\n  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit vacated in part. Relevant\nhere, the panel held that because the ADA covers public\n\u201cservices, programs, or activities,\u201d \u00a712132, the ADA\u2019s\naccommodation requirement should be read to \u201cto encom-\npass \u2018anything a public entity does,\u2019 \u201d 743 F. 3d, at 1232.\nThe Ninth Circuit agreed \u201cthat exigent circumstances\ninform the reasonableness analysis under the ADA,\u201d ibid.,\nbut concluded that it was for a jury to decide whether San\nFrancisco should have accommodated Sheehan by, for\ninstance, \u201crespect[ing] her comfort zone, engag[ing] in non-\nthreatening communications and us[ing] the passage of\ntime to defuse the situation rather than precipitating a\ndeadly confrontation.\u201d Id., at 1233.\n  As to Reynolds and Holder, the panel held that their\ninitial entry into Sheehan\u2019s room was lawful and that,\nafter the officers opened the door for the second time, they\nreasonably used their firearms when the pepper spray\nfailed to stop Sheehan\u2019s advance. Nonetheless, the panel\nalso held that a jury could find that the officers \u201cprovoked\u201d\nSheehan by needlessly forcing that second confrontation.\nId., at 1216, 1229. The panel further found that it was\nclearly established that an officer cannot \u201cforcibly enter\nthe home of an armed, mentally ill subject who had been\nacting irrationally and had threatened anyone who en-\ntered when there was no objective need for immediate\nentry.\u201d Id., at 1229. Dissenting in part, Judge Graber\nwould have held that the officers were entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

We\ngranted the petition. 574 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                              II\n   Title II of the ADA commands that \u201cno qualified indi-\nvidual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability,\nbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits\nof the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or\nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a712132. The first question on which we granted\nreview asks whether this provision \u201crequires law enforce-\nment officers to provide accommodations to an armed,\nviolent, and mentally ill suspect in the course of bringing\nthe suspect into custody.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. When we\ngranted review, we understood this question to embody\nwhat appears to be the thrust of the argument that San\nFrancisco made in the Ninth Circuit, namely that \u201c \u2018Title II\ndoes not apply to an officer\u2019s on-the-street responses to\nreported disturbances or other similar incidents, whether\nor not those calls involve subjects with mental disabilities,\nprior to the officer\u2019s securing the scene and ensuring that\nthere is no threat to human life.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Appellees in\nNo. 11\u201316401 (CA9), p. 36 (quoting Hainze, supra, at 801;\nemphasis added); see also Brief for Appellees in No. 11\u2013\n16401, at 37 (similar).\n   As San Francisco explained in its reply brief at the\ncertiorari stage, resolving its \u201cquestion presented\u201d \u201cdoes\nnot require a fact-intensive \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019\ninquiry,\u201d since \u201cthe only question for this Court to resolve\nis whether any accommodation of an armed and violent\nindividual is reasonable or required under Title II of the\nADA.\u201d Reply to Brief in Opposition 3.\n   Having persuaded us to grant certiorari, San Francisco\nchose to rely on a different argument than what it pressed\nbelow. In its brief in this Court, San Francisco focuses on\n8          CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                       v. SHEEHAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statutory phrase \u201cqualified individual,\u201d \u00a712132, and a\nregulation declaring that Title II \u201cdoes not require a public\nentity to permit an individual to participate in or benefit\nfrom the services, programs, or activities of that public\nentity when that individual poses a direct threat to the\nhealth or safety of others.\u201d 28 CFR \u00a735.139(a) (2014).\nAnother regulation defines a \u201cdirect threat\u201d as \u201ca signifi-\ncant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be\neliminated by a modification of policies, practices or proce-\ndures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.\u201d\n\u00a735.104. Putting these authorities together, San Fran-\ncisco argues that \u201ca person who poses a direct threat or\nsignificant risk to the safety of others is not qualified for\naccommodations under the ADA,\u201d Brief for Petitioners 17.\nContending that Sheehan clearly posed a \u201cdirect threat,\u201d\nSan Francisco concludes that she was therefore not \u201cquali-\nfied\u201d for an accommodation.\n   Though, to be sure, this \u201cqualified\u201d argument does ap-\npear in San Francisco\u2019s certiorari petition, San Francisco\nnever hinted at it in the Ninth Circuit. The Court does\nnot ordinarily decide questions that were not passed on\nbelow. More than that, San Francisco\u2019s new argument\neffectively concedes that the relevant provision of the\nADA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a712132, may \u201crequir[e] law enforcement\nofficers to provide accommodations to an armed, violent,\nand mentally ill suspect in the course of bringing the\nsuspect into custody.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. This is so because\nthere may be circumstances in which any \u201csignificant risk\u201d\npresented by \u201can armed, violent, and mentally ill suspect\u201d\ncan be \u201celiminated by a modification of policies, practices\nor procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or\nservices.\u201d\n   The argument that San Francisco now advances is\npredicated on the proposition that the ADA governs the\nmanner in which a qualified individual with a disability is\narrested. The relevant provision provides that a public\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nentity may not \u201cexclud[e]\u201d a qualified individual with a\ndisability from \u201cparticipat[ing] in,\u201d and may not \u201cden[y]\u201d\nthat individual the \u201cbenefits of[,] the services, programs,\nor activities of a public entity.\u201d \u00a712132. This language\nwould apply to an arrest if an arrest is an \u201cactivity\u201d in\nwhich the arrestee \u201cparticipat[es]\u201d or from which the\narrestee may \u201cbenefi[t].\u201d\n   This same provision also commands that \u201cno qualified\nindividual with a disability shall be . . . subjected to dis-\ncrimination by any [public] entity.\u201d Ibid. This part of the\nstatute would apply to an arrest if the failure to arrest an\nindividual with a mental disability in a manner that\nreasonably accommodates that disability constitutes \u201cdis-\ncrimination.\u201d Ibid.\n   Whether the statutory language quoted above applies to\narrests is an important question that would benefit from\nbriefing and an adversary presentation. But San Fran-\ncisco, the United States as amicus curiae, and Sheehan all\nargue (or at least accept) that \u00a712132 applies to arrests.\nNo one argues the contrary view. As a result, we do not\nthink that it would be prudent to decide the question in\nthis case.\n   Our decision not to decide whether the ADA applies to\narrests is reinforced by the parties\u2019 failure to address a\nrelated question: whether a public entity can be liable for\ndamages under Title II for an arrest made by its police\nofficers. Only public entities are subject to Title II, see,\ne.g., Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S.\n206, 208 (1998), and the parties agree that such an entity\ncan be held vicariously liable for money damages for the\npurposeful or deliberately indifferent conduct of its em-\nployees. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\u201312, 22. But we have\nnever decided whether that is correct, and we decline to do\nso here, in the absence of adversarial briefing.\n   Because certiorari jurisdiction exists to clarify the law,\nits exercise \u201cis not a matter of right, but of judicial discre-\n10           CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                         v.

See, e.g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v.\nGarrett, 531 U. S. 356, 360, n. 1 (2001) (partial dismissal);\nParker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 323 (1991) (same).\n                             III\n   The second question presented is whether Reynolds and\nHolder can be held personally liable for the injuries that\nSheehan suffered. We conclude they are entitled to quali-\nfied immunity.3\n   Public officials are immune from suit under 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71983 unless they have \u201cviolated a statutory or constitu-\ntional right that was clearly established at the time of the\nchallenged conduct.\u201d Plumhoff, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12) (internal quotation marks omitted). An officer\n\u201ccannot be said to have violated a clearly established right\nunless the right\u2019s contours were sufficiently definite that\nany reasonable official in [his] shoes would have under-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Not satisfied with dismissing question one, which concerns San\n\nFrancisco\u2019s liability, our dissenting colleagues would further punish\nSan Francisco by dismissing question two as well. See post, at 3\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.) (arguing that deciding the second question would\n\u201creward\u201d San Francisco and \u201cspar[e it] the significant expense of\ndefending the suit, and satisfying any judgment, against the individual\npetitioners\u201d). But question two concerns the liability of the individual\nofficers. Whatever contractual obligations San Francisco may (or may\nnot) have to represent and indemnify the officers are not our concern.\nAt a minimum, these officers have a personal interest in the correctness\nof the judgment below, which holds that they may have violated the\nConstitution. Moreover, when we granted the petition, we determined\nthat both questions independently merited review. Because of the\nimportance of qualified immunity \u201cto society as a whole,\u201d Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 814 (1982), the Court often corrects lower\ncourts when they wrongly subject individual officers to liability. See,\ne.g., Carroll v. Carman, 574 U. S. ___ (2014) (per curiam); Wood v.\nMoss, 572 U. S. ___ (2014); Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U. S. ___ (2014);\nStanton v. Sims, 571 U. S. ___ (2013) (per curiam); Reichle v. Howards,\n566 U.

S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9). This exacting standard\n\u201cgives government officials breathing room to make rea-\nsonable but mistaken judgments\u201d by \u201cprotect[ing] all but\nthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate\nthe law.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n   In this case, although we disagree with the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the question of qualified\nimmunity, we agree with its analysis in many respects.\nFor instance, there is no doubt that the officers did not\nviolate any federal right when they opened Sheehan\u2019s door\nthe first time. See 743 F. 3d, at 1216, 1223. Reynolds and\nHolder knocked on the door, announced that they were\npolice officers, and informed Sheehan that they wanted to\nhelp her. When Sheehan did not come to the door, they\nentered her room. This was not unconstitutional. \u201c[L]aw\nenforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant\nto render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or\nto protect an occupant from imminent injury.\u201d Brigham\nCity v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006). See also Ken-\ntucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6).\n   Nor is there any doubt that had Sheehan not been dis-\nabled, the officers could have opened her door the second\ntime without violating any constitutional rights. For one\nthing, \u201cbecause the two entries were part of a single,\ncontinuous search or seizure, the officers [were] not re-\nquired to justify the continuing emergency with respect to\nthe second entry.\u201d 743 F. 3d, at 1224 (following Michigan\nv. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499, 511 (1978)). In addition, Reynolds\nand Holder knew that Sheehan had a weapon and had\nthreatened to use it to kill three people. They also knew\nthat delay could make the situation more dangerous. The\nFourth Amendment standard is reasonableness, and it is\nreasonable for police to move quickly if delay \u201cwould\n12         CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                       v.

This is true even when, judged with the benefit of\nhindsight, the officers may have made \u201csome mistakes.\u201d\nHeien v. North Carolina, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op.,\nat 5). The Constitution is not blind to \u201cthe fact that police\nofficers are often forced to make split-second judgments.\u201d\nPlumhoff, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8).\n   We also agree with the Ninth Circuit that after the\nofficers opened Sheehan\u2019s door the second time, their use\nof force was reasonable.         Reynolds tried to subdue\nSheehan with pepper spray, but Sheehan kept coming at\nthe officers until she was \u201conly a few feet from a cornered\nOfficer Holder.\u201d 743 F. 3d, at 1229. At this point, the use\nof potentially deadly force was justified. See Scott v.\nHarris, 550 U. S. 372, 384 (2007). Nothing in the Fourth\nAmendment barred Reynolds and Holder from protecting\nthemselves, even though it meant firing multiple rounds.\nSee Plumhoff, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11).\n   The real question, then, is whether, despite these dan-\ngerous circumstances, the officers violated the Fourth\nAmendment when they decided to reopen Sheehan\u2019s door\nrather than attempting to accommodate her disability.\nHere we come to another problem. San Francisco, whose\nattorneys represent Reynolds and Holder, devotes scant\nbriefing to this question. Instead, San Francisco argues\nalmost exclusively that even if it is assumed that there\nwas a Fourth Amendment violation, the right was not\nclearly established. This Court, of course, could decide the\nconstitutional question anyway. See Pearson v. Callahan,\n555 U. S. 223, 242 (2009) (recognizing discretion). But\nbecause this question has not been adequately briefed, we\ndecline to do so. See id., at 239. Rather, we simply decide\nwhether the officers\u2019 failure to accommodate Sheehan\u2019s\nillness violated clearly established law. It did not.\n   To begin, nothing in our cases suggests the constitu-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional rule applied by the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit\nfocused on Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989), but\nGraham holds only that the \u201c \u2018objective reasonableness\u2019 \u201d\ntest applies to excessive-force claims under the Fourth\nAmendment. See id., at 388. That is far too general a\nproposition to control this case. \u201cWe have repeatedly told\ncourts\u2014and the Ninth Circuit in particular\u2014not to define\nclearly established law at a high level of generality.\u201d al-\nKidd, supra, at ___ (citation omitted) (slip op., at 10); cf.\nLopez v. Smith, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip\nop., at 5). Qualified immunity is no immunity at all if\n\u201cclearly established\u201d law can simply be defined as the\nright to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n   Even a cursory glance at the facts of Graham confirms\njust how different that case is from this one. That case did\nnot involve a dangerous, obviously unstable person mak-\ning threats, much less was there a weapon involved.\nThere is a world of difference between needlessly with-\nholding sugar from an innocent person who is suffering\nfrom an insulin reaction, see Graham, supra, at 388\u2013389,\nand responding to the perilous situation Reynolds and\nHolder confronted. Graham is a nonstarter.\n   Moving beyond Graham, the Ninth Circuit also turned\nto two of its own cases. But even if \u201ca controlling circuit\nprecedent could constitute clearly established federal law\nin these circumstances,\u201d Carroll v. Carman, 574 U. S. ___,\n___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4), it does not do so\nhere.\n   The Ninth Circuit first pointed to Deorle v. Rutherford,\n272 F. 3d 1272 (CA9 2001), but from the very first para-\ngraph of that opinion we learn that Deorle involved an\nofficer\u2019s use of a beanbag gun to subdue \u201can emotionally\ndisturbed\u201d person who \u201cwas unarmed, had not attacked or\neven touched anyone, had generally obeyed the instruc-\ntions given him by various police officers, and had not\ncommitted any serious offense.\u201d Id., at 1275. The officer\n14            CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                          v. SHEEHAN\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthere, moreover, \u201cobserved Deorle at close proximity for\nabout five to ten minutes before shooting him\u201d in the face.\nSee id., at 1281. Whatever the merits of the decision in\nDeorle, the differences between that case and the case\nbefore us leap from the page. Unlike Deorle, Sheehan was\ndangerous, recalcitrant, law-breaking, and out of sight.\n   The Ninth Circuit also leaned on Alexander v. City and\nCounty of San Francisco, 29 F. 3d 1355 (CA9 1994), an-\nother case involving mental illness. There, officials from\nSan Francisco attempted to enter Henry Quade\u2019s home\n\u201cfor the primary purpose of arresting him\u201d even though\nthey lacked an arrest warrant. Id., at 1361. Quade, in\nresponse, fired a handgun; police officers \u201cshot back, and\nQuade died from gunshot wounds shortly thereafter.\u201d Id.,\nat 1358. The panel concluded that a jury should decide\nwhether the officers used excessive force. The court rea-\nsoned that the officers provoked the confrontation because\nthere were no \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d excusing their\nentrance. Id., at 1361.\n   Alexander too is a poor fit. As Judge Graber observed\nbelow in her dissent, the Ninth Circuit has long read\nAlexander narrowly. See 743 F. 3d, at 1235 (Graber, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Billing-\nton v. Smith, 292 F. 3d 1177 (CA9 2002)). Under Ninth\nCircuit law,4 an entry that otherwise complies with the\nFourth Amendment is not rendered unreasonable because\nit provokes a violent reaction. See id., at 1189\u20131190.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Our citation to Ninth Circuit cases should not be read to suggest our\n\nagreement (or, for that matter, disagreement) with them. The Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s \u201cprovocation\u201d rule, for instance, has been sharply questioned\nelsewhere. See Livermore v. Lubelan, 476 F. 3d 397, 406\u2013407 (CA6\n2007); see also, e.g., Hector v. Watt, 235 F. 3d 154, 160 (CA3 2001) (\u201c[I]f\nthe officers\u2019 use of force was reasonable given the plaintiff\u2019s acts, then\ndespite the illegal entry, the plaintiff\u2019s own conduct would be an inter-\nvening cause\u201d). Whatever their merits, all that matters for our quali-\nfied immunity analysis is that they do not clearly establish any right\nthat the officers violated.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnder this rule, qualified immunity necessarily applies\nhere because, as explained above, competent officers could\nhave believed that the second entry was justified under\nboth continuous search and exigent circumstance ration-\nales. Indeed, even if Reynolds and Holder misjudged the\nsituation, Sheehan cannot \u201cestablish a Fourth Amend-\nment violation based merely on bad tactics that result in a\ndeadly confrontation that could have been avoided.\u201d Id.,\nat 1190. Courts must not judge officers with \u201cthe 20/20\nvision of hindsight.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Graham, 490 U. S., at\n396).\n   When Graham, Deorle, and Alexander are viewed to-\ngether, the central error in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning\nis apparent. The panel majority concluded that these\nthree cases \u201cwould have placed any reasonable, competent\nofficer on notice that it is unreasonable to forcibly enter\nthe home of an armed, mentally ill suspect who had been\nacting irrationally and had threatened anyone who en-\ntered when there was no objective need for immediate\nentry.\u201d 743 F. 3d, at 1229. But even assuming that is\ntrue, no precedent clearly established that there was not\n\u201can objective need for immediate entry\u201d here. No matter\nhow carefully a reasonable officer read Graham, Deorle,\nand Alexander beforehand, that officer could not know\nthat reopening Sheehan\u2019s door to prevent her from escap-\ning or gathering more weapons would violate the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s test, even if all the disputed facts are viewed in\nrespondent\u2019s favor. Without that \u201cfair notice,\u201d an officer is\nentitled to qualified immunity. See, e.g., Plumhoff, 572\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n   Nor does it matter for purposes of qualified immunity\nthat Sheehan\u2019s expert, Reiter, testified that the officers\ndid not follow their training.

The petition assured us\n(quite accurately), and devoted a section of its argument to\nthe point, that \u201cThe Circuits Are In Conflict On This\nQuestion.\u201d Id., at 18. And petitioners faulted the Ninth\nCircuit for \u201cholding that the ADA\u2019s reasonable accommo-\ndation requirement applies to officers facing violent cir-\ncumstances,\u201d a conclusion that was \u201cin direct conflict with\nthe categorical prohibition on such claims adopted by the\nFifth and Sixth Circuits.\u201d Ibid. Petitioners had expressly\nadvocated for the Fifth and Sixth Circuits\u2019 position in the\nCourt of Appeals. See Appellees\u2019 Answering Brief in No.\n11\u201316401 (CA9), pp. 35\u201337 (\u201c[T]he ADA does not apply to\npolice officers\u2019 responses to violent individuals who happen\nto be mentally ill, where officers have not yet brought the\nviolent situation under control\u201d).\n  Imagine our surprise, then, when the petitioners\u2019 prin-\ncipal brief, reply brief, and oral argument had nary a word\n2          CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                            v. SHEEHAN\n        SCALIA, J., concurring\n                        Opinion inof\n                                   part and,dissenting\n                                     SCALIA J.         in part\n\nto say about that subject. Instead, petitioners bluntly\nannounced in their principal brief that they \u201cdo not assert\nthat the actions of individual police officers [in arresting\nviolent and armed disabled persons] are never subject to\nscrutiny under Title II,\u201d and proclaimed that \u201c[t]he only\nADA issue here is what Title II requires of individual\nofficers who are facing an armed and dangerous suspect.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioners 34 (emphasis added). In other words,\nthe issue is not (as the petition had asserted) whether Title\nII applies to arrests of violent, mentally ill individuals, but\nrather how it applies under the circumstances of this case,\nwhere the plaintiff threatened officers with a weapon. We\nwere thus deprived of the opportunity to consider, and\nsettle, a controverted question of law that has divided the\nCircuits, and were invited instead to decide an ADA ques-\ntion that has relevance only if we assume the Ninth Cir-\ncuit correctly resolved the antecedent, unargued question\non which we granted certiorari. The Court is correct to\ndismiss the first QP as improvidently granted.\n   Why, one might ask, would a petitioner take a position\non a Circuit split that it had no intention of arguing, or at\nleast was so little keen to argue that it cast the argument\naside uninvited? The answer is simple. Petitioners in-\ncluded that issue to induce us to grant certiorari. As the\nCourt rightly observes, there are numerous reasons why\nwe would not have agreed to hear petitioners\u2019 first QP if\ntheir petition for certiorari presented it in the same form\nthat it was argued on the merits. See ante, at 7\u201310. But it\nis also true that there was little chance that we would\nhave taken this case to decide only the second, fact-bound\nQP\u2014that is, whether the individual petitioners are en-\ntitled to qualified immunity on respondent\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment claim.\n   This Court\u2019s Rule 10, entitled \u201cConsiderations Govern-\ning Review on Certiorari,\u201d says that certiorari will be\ngranted \u201conly for compelling reasons,\u201d which include the\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                     3\n\n          SCALIA, J., concurring\n                          Opinioninof\n                                    part and,dissenting\n                                      SCALIA J.         in part\n\nexistence of conflicting decisions on issues of law among\nfederal courts of appeals, among state courts of last resort,\nor between federal courts of appeals and state courts of\nlast resort. The Rule concludes: \u201cA petition for a writ of\ncertiorari is rarely granted when the asserted error con-\nsists of erroneous factual findings or the misapplication of\na properly stated rule of law.\u201d The second QP implicates,\nat most, the latter. It is unlikely that we would have\ngranted certiorari on that question alone.\n   But (and here is what lies beneath the present case)\nwhen we do grant certiorari on a question for which there\nis a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d for our review, we often also grant\ncertiorari on attendant questions that are not inde-\npendently \u201ccertworthy,\u201d but that are sufficiently connected\nto the ultimate disposition of the case that the efficient\nadministration of justice supports their consideration. In\nother words, by promising argument on the Circuit conflict\nthat their first question presented, petitioners got us to\ngrant certiorari not only on the first question but also on\nthe second.\n   I would not reward such bait-and-switch tactics by\nproceeding to decide the independently \u201cuncertworthy\u201d\nsecond question. And make no mistake about it: Today\u2019s\njudgment is a reward. It gives the individual petitioners\nall that they seek, and spares San Francisco the signifi-\ncant expense of defending the suit, and satisfying any\njudgment, against the individual petitioners.* I would not\nencourage future litigants to seek review premised on\narguments they never plan to press, secure in the\nknowledge that once they find a toehold on this Court\u2019s\ndocket, we will consider whatever workaday arguments\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * San Francisco will still be subject to liability under the ADA if the\ntrial court determines that the facts demanded accommodation. The\nCourt of Appeals vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment that the ADA\nwas inapplicable to police arrests of violent and armed disabled per-\nsons, and remanded for the accommodation determination.\n4          CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n                            v. SHEEHAN\n        SCALIA, J., concurring\n                        Opinion inof\n                                   part and,dissenting\n                                     SCALIA J.         in part\n\nthey choose to present in their merits briefs.\n   There is no injustice in my vote to dismiss both ques-\ntions as improvidently granted. To be sure, ex post\u2014after\nthe Court has improvidently decided the uncertworthy\nquestion\u2014it appears that refusal to reverse the judgment\nbelow would have left a wrong unrighted. Ex ante, how-\never\u2014before we considered and deliberated upon the second\nQP but after petitioners\u2019 principal brief made clear that\nthey would not address the Circuit conflict presented by\nthe first QP\u2014we had no more assurance that this question\nwas decided incorrectly than we do for the thousands of\nother uncertworthy questions we refuse to hear each\nTerm. Many of them have undoubtedly been decided\nwrongly, but we are not, and for well over a century have\nnot been, a court of error correction. The fair course\u2014the\njust course\u2014is to treat this now-nakedly uncertworthy\nquestion the way we treat all others: by declining to decide\nit. In fact, there is in this case an even greater reason to\ndecline: to avoid being snookered, and to deter future\nsnookering.\n   Because I agree with the Court that \u201ccertiorari jurisdic-\ntion exists to clarify the law,\u201d ante, at 9 (emphasis added),\nI would dismiss both questions presented as improvidently\ngranted.\n</pre>",
