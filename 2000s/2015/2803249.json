SHARIF\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 13\u2013935.      Argued January 14, 2015\u2014Decided May 26, 2015\nRespondent Richard Sharif tried to discharge a debt he owed petition-\n  ers, Wellness International Network, Ltd., and its owners (collective-\n  ly Wellness), in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Wellness sought, inter\n  alia, a declaratory judgment from the Bankruptcy Court, contending\n  that a trust Sharif claimed to administer was in fact Sharif\u2019s alter-\n  ego, and that its assets were his personal property and part of his\n  bankruptcy estate. The Bankruptcy Court eventually entered a de-\n  fault judgment against Sharif. While Sharif\u2019s appeal was pending in\n  District Court, but before briefing concluded, this Court held that Ar-\n  ticle III forbids bankruptcy courts to enter a final judgment on claims\n  that seek only to \u201caugment\u201d the bankruptcy estate and would other-\n  wise \u201cexis[t] without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d Stern v.\n  Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___. After briefing closed, Sharif sought\n  permission to file a supplemental brief raising a Stern objection. The\n  District Court denied the motion, finding it untimely, and affirmed\n  the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment. As relevant here, the Seventh\n  Circuit determined that Sharif\u2019s Stern objection could not be waived\n  because it implicated structural interests and reversed on the alter-\n  ego claim, holding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional\n  authority to enter final judgment on that claim.\nHeld:\n    1. Article III permits bankruptcy judges to adjudicate Stern claims\n with the parties\u2019 knowing and voluntary consent. Pp. 8\u201317.\n       (a) The foundational case supporting the adjudication of legal\n disputes by non-Article III judges with the consent of the parties is\n Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833. There,\n the Court held that the right to adjudication before an Article III\n2            WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    court is \u201cpersonal\u201d and therefore \u201csubject to waiver.\u201d Id., at 848. The\n    Court also recognized that if Article III\u2019s structural interests as \u201c \u2018an\n    inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and bal-\n    ances\u2019 \u201d are implicated, \u201cthe parties cannot by consent cure the consti-\n    tutional difficulty.\u201d Id., at 850\u2013851. The importance of consent was\n    reiterated in two later cases involving the Federal Magistrates Act\u2019s\n    assignment of non-Article III magistrate judges to supervise voir dire\n    in felony trials. In Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, the Court\n    held that a magistrate judge was not permitted to select a jury with-\n    out the defendant\u2019s consent, id., at 864. But in Peretz v. United\n    States, 501 U. S. 923, the Court stated that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s consent\n    significantly changes the constitutional analysis,\u201d id., at 932. Be-\n    cause an Article III court retained supervisory authority over the\n    process, the Court found \u201cno structural protections . . . implicated\u201d\n    and upheld the Magistrate Judge\u2019s action. Id., at 937. Pp. 8\u201312.\n         (b) The question whether allowing bankruptcy courts to decide\n    Stern claims by consent would \u201cimpermissibly threate[n] the institu-\n    tional integrity of the Judicial Branch,\u201d Schor, 478 U. S., at 851, must\n    be decided \u201cwith an eye to the practical effect that the\u201d practice \u201cwill\n    have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary,\u201d\n    ibid. For several reasons, this practice does not usurp the constitu-\n    tional prerogatives of Article III courts. Bankruptcy judges are ap-\n    pointed and may be removed by Article III judges, see 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7\u00a7152(a)(1), (e); \u201cserve as judicial officers of the United States district\n    court,\u201d \u00a7151; and collectively \u201cconstitute a unit of the district court\u201d\n    for the district in which they serve, \u00a7152(a)(1). Bankruptcy courts\n    hear matters solely on a district court\u2019s reference, \u00a7157(a), and pos-\n    sess no free-floating authority to decide claims traditionally heard by\n    Article III courts, see Schor, 478 U. S., at 854, 856. \u201c[T]he decision to\n    invoke\u201d the bankruptcy court\u2019s authority \u201cis left entirely to the par-\n    ties,\u201d id., at 855, and \u201cthe power of the federal judiciary to take juris-\n    diction\u201d remains in place, ibid. Finally, there is no indication that\n    Congress gave bankruptcy courts the ability to decide Stern claims in\n    an effort to aggrandize itself or humble the Judiciary. See, e.g.,\n    Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937. Pp. 12\u201315.\n         (c) Stern does not compel a different result. It turned on the fact\n    that the litigant \u201cdid not truly consent to\u201d resolution of the claim\n    against it in a non-Article III forum, 564 U. S., at ___, and thus, does\n    not govern the question whether litigants may validly consent to ad-\n    judication by a bankruptcy court. Moreover, expanding Stern to hold\n    that a litigant may not waive the right to an Article III court through\n    consent would be inconsistent with that opinion\u2019s own description of\n    its holding as \u201ca \u2018narrow\u2019 one\u201d that did \u201cnot change all that much\u201d\n    about the division of labor between district and bankruptcy courts.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  Id., at ___. Pp. 15\u201317.\n     2. Consent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court need not be ex-\n  press, but must be knowing and voluntary. Neither the Constitution\n  nor the relevant statute\u2014which requires \u201cthe consent of all parties to\n  the proceeding\u201d to hear a Stern claim, \u00a7157(c)(2)\u2014mandates express\n  consent. Such a requirement would be in great tension with this\n  Court\u2019s holding that substantially similar language in \u00a7636(c)\u2014which\n  authorizes magistrate judges to conduct proceedings \u201c[u]pon consent\n  of the parties\u201d\u2014permits waiver based on \u201cactions rather than words,\u201d\n  Roell v. Withrow, 538 U. S. 580, 589. Roell\u2019s implied consent stand-\n  ard supplies the appropriate rule for bankruptcy court adjudications\n  and makes clear that a litigant\u2019s consent\u2014whether express or im-\n  plied\u2014must be knowing and voluntary. Pp. 18\u201319.\n     3. The Seventh Circuit should decide on remand whether Sharif\u2019s\n  actions evinced the requisite knowing and voluntary consent and\n  whether Sharif forfeited his Stern argument below.

RICHARD SHARIF\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [May 26, 2015]\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Article III, \u00a71, of the Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he\njudicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one\nsupreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Con-\ngress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d Con-\ngress has in turn established 94 District Courts and 13\nCourts of Appeals, composed of judges who enjoy the\nprotections of Article III: life tenure and pay that cannot\nbe diminished. Because these protections help to ensure\nthe integrity and independence of the Judiciary, \u201cwe have\nlong recognized that, in general, Congress may not with-\ndraw from\u201d the Article III courts \u201cany matter which, from\nits nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in\nequity, or in admiralty.\u201d Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 18) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Congress has also authorized the appointment of bank-\nruptcy and magistrate judges, who do not enjoy the protec-\ntions of Article III, to assist Article III courts in their\nwork. The number of magistrate and bankruptcy judge-\nships exceeds the number of circuit and district judge-\n2          WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nships.1 And it is no exaggeration to say that without the\ndistinguished service of these judicial colleagues, the work\nof the federal court system would grind nearly to a halt.2\n   Congress\u2019 efforts to align the responsibilities of non-\nArticle III judges with the boundaries set by the Constitu-\ntion have not always been successful. In Northern Pipe-\nline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50\n(1982) (plurality opinion), and more recently in Stern, this\nCourt held that Congress violated Article III by authoriz-\ning bankruptcy judges to decide certain claims for which\nlitigants are constitutionally entitled to an Article III\nadjudication. This case presents the question whether\nArticle III allows bankruptcy judges to adjudicate such\nclaims with the parties\u2019 consent. We hold that Article III\nis not violated when the parties knowingly and voluntarily\nconsent to adjudication by a bankruptcy judge.\n                            I\n                            A\n  Before 1978, district courts typically delegated bank-\nruptcy proceedings to \u201creferees.\u201d Executive Benefits Ins.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Congress has authorized 179 circuit judgeships and 677 district\n\njudgeships, a total of 856.

S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4).\nUnder the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, bankruptcy referees\nhad \u201c[s]ummary jurisdiction\u201d over \u201cclaims involving \u2018prop-\nerty in the actual or constructive possession of the bank-\nruptcy court\u2019 \u201d\u2014that is, over the apportionment of the\nbankruptcy estate among creditors.           Ibid. (alteration\nomitted). They could preside over other proceedings\u2014\nmatters implicating the court\u2019s \u201cplenary jurisdiction\u201d\u2014by\nconsent. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5); see also MacDonald v.\nPlymouth County Trust Co., 286 U. S. 263, 266\u2013267\n(1932).\n   In 1978, Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Reform Act,\nwhich repealed the 1898 Act and gave the newly created\nbankruptcy courts power \u201cmuch broader than that exer-\ncised under the former referee system.\u201d Northern Pipe-\nline, 458 U. S., at 54. The Act \u201c[e]liminat[ed] the distinc-\ntion between \u2018summary\u2019 and \u2018plenary\u2019 jurisdiction\u201d and\nenabled bankruptcy courts to decide \u201call \u2018civil proceedings\narising under title 11 [the Bankruptcy title] or arising\nin or related to cases under title 11.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (emphasis de-\nleted). Congress thus vested bankruptcy judges with most\nof the \u201c\u2018powers of a court of equity, law, and admiralty,\u2019\u201d id.,\nat 55, without affording them the benefits of Article III.\nThis Court therefore held parts of the system unconstitu-\ntional in Northern Pipeline.\n   Congress responded by enacting the Bankruptcy\nAmendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. Under\nthat Act, district courts have original jurisdiction over\nbankruptcy cases and related proceedings. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71334(a), (b).

But it\ngave bankruptcy courts more limited author-ity in non-\ncore proceedings: They may \u201chear and determine\u201d such\nproceedings, and \u201center appropriate orders and judg-\nments,\u201d only \u201cwith the consent of all the parties to the\nproceeding.\u201d \u00a7157(c)(2). Absent consent, bankruptcy\ncourts in non-core proceedings may only \u201csubmit proposed\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law,\u201d which the district\ncourts review de novo. \u00a7157(c)(1).\n                            B\n  Petitioner Wellness International Network is a manu-\nfacturer of health and nutrition products.4 Wellness and\nrespondent Sharif entered into a contract under which\nSharif would distribute Wellness\u2019 products.

Sharif repeatedly ignored Wellness\u2019 discovery\nrequests and other litigation obligations, resulting in an\nentry of default judgment for Wellness. The District Court\neventually sanctioned Sharif by awarding Wellness over\n$650,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. This case arises from Well-\nness\u2019 long-running\u2014and so far unsuccessful\u2014efforts to\ncollect on that judgment.\n   In February 2009, Sharif filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin the Northern District of Illinois. The bankruptcy peti-\ntion listed Wellness as a creditor. Wellness requested\ndocuments concerning Sharif \u2019s assets, which Sharif did\nnot provide. Wellness later obtained a loan application\nSharif had filed in 2002, listing more than $5 million in\nassets. When confronted, Sharif informed Wellness and\nthe Chapter 7 trustee that he had lied on the loan applica-\ntion. The listed assets, Sharif claimed, were actually\nowned by the Soad Wattar Living Trust (Trust), an entity\nSharif said he administered on behalf of his mother, and\nfor the benefit of his sister. Wellness pressed Sharif\nfor information on the Trust, but Sharif again failed to\nrespond.\n   Wellness filed a five-count adversary complaint against\nSharif in the Bankruptcy Court. See App. 5\u201322. Counts\nI\u2013IV of the complaint objected to the discharge of Sharif \u2019s\ndebts because, among other reasons, Sharif had concealed\nproperty by claiming that it was owned by the Trust.\nCount V of the complaint sought a declaratory judgment\nthat the Trust was Sharif \u2019s alter ego and that its assets\nshould therefore be treated as part of Sharif \u2019s bankruptcy\nestate. Id., at 21. In his answer, Sharif admitted that the\nadversary proceeding was a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7157(b)\u2014i.e., a proceeding in which the Bankruptcy\nCourt could enter final judgment subject to appeal. See\n\u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1), (2)(J); App. 24. Indeed, Sharif requested\njudgment in his favor on all counts of Wellness\u2019 complaint\n6        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand urged the Bankruptcy Court to \u201cfind that the Soad\nWattar Living Trust is not property of the [bankruptcy]\nestate.\u201d Id., at 44.\n   A familiar pattern of discovery evasion ensued. Well-\nness responded by filing a motion for sanctions, or, in the\nalternative, to compel discovery. Granting the motion to\ncompel, the Bankruptcy Court warned Sharif that if he did\nnot respond to Wellness\u2019 discovery requests a default\njudgment would be entered against him. Sharif eventu-\nally complied with some discovery obligations, but did not\nproduce any documents related to the Trust.\n   In July 2010, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling\nfinding that Sharif had violated the court\u2019s discovery\norder. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a\u2013120a. It accordingly\ndenied Sharif \u2019s request to discharge his debts and entered\na default judgment against him in the adversary proceed-\ning. And it declared, as requested by count V of Wellness\u2019\ncomplaint, that the assets supposedly held by the Trust\nwere in fact property of Sharif \u2019s bankruptcy estate be-\ncause Sharif \u201ctreats [the Trust\u2019s] assets as his own prop-\nerty.\u201d Id., at 119a.\n   Sharif appealed to the District Court. Six weeks before\nSharif filed his opening brief in the District Court, this\nCourt decided Stern. In Stern, the Court held that Article\nIII prevents bankruptcy courts from entering final judg-\nment on claims that seek only to \u201caugment\u201d the bankruptcy\nestate and would otherwise \u201cexis[t] without regard to\nany bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d 564 U.

The\nSeventh Circuit acknowledged that ordinarily Sharif \u2019s\nStern objection would \u201cnot [be] preserved because he\nwaited too long to assert it.\u201d 727 F. 3d, at 767.5 But the\ncourt determined that the ordinary rule did not apply\nbecause Sharif \u2019s argument concerned \u201cthe allocation of\nauthority between bankruptcy courts and district courts\u201d\nunder Article III, and thus \u201cimplicate[d] structural inter-\nests.\u201d Id., at 771. Based on those separation-of-powers\nconsiderations, the court held that \u201ca litigant may not\nwaive\u201d a Stern objection. Id., at 773. Turning to the\nmerits of Sharif \u2019s contentions, the Seventh Circuit agreed\nwith the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of counts I\u2013IV of\nWellness\u2019 adversary complaint. It further concluded,\nhowever, that count V of the complaint alleged a so-called\n\u201cStern claim,\u201d that is, \u201ca claim designated for final adjudi-\ncation in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter, but\nprohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional\nmatter.\u201d Executive Benefits, 573 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n4). The Seventh Circuit therefore ruled that the Bank-\nruptcy Court lacked constitutional authority to enter final\njudgment on count V.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Although the Seventh Circuit referred to Sharif\u2019s failure to raise his\n\nStern argument in a timely manner as a waiver, that court has since\nclarified that its decision rested on forfeiture. See Peterson v. Somers\nDublin Ltd., 729 F. 3d 741, 747 (2013) (\u201cThe issue in Wellness Interna-\ntional Network was forfeiture rather than waiver\u201d).\n   6 The Seventh Circuit concluded its opinion by considering the rem-\n\nedy for the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s purportedly unconstitutional issuance\nof a final judgment. The court determined that if count V of Wellness\u2019\ncomplaint raised a core claim, the only statutorily authorized remedy\nwould be for the District Court to withdraw the reference to the Bank-\nruptcy Court and set a new discovery schedule. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s\nreasoning on this point was rejected by our decision last Term in\nExecutive Benefits, which held that district courts may treat Stern\n8         WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

The CFTC ruled against\nSchor on the counterclaims. This Court upheld that ruling\nagainst both statutory and constitutional challenges.\n  On the constitutional question (the one relevant here)\nthe Court began by holding that Schor had \u201cwaived any\nright he may have possessed to the full trial of [the bro-\nker\u2019s] counterclaim before an Article III court.\u201d Id., at 849.\nThe Court then explained why this waiver legitimated the\nCFTC\u2019s exercise of authority: \u201c[A]s a personal right, Arti-\ncle III\u2019s guarantee of an impartial and independent federal\nadjudication is subject to waiver, just as are other per-\nsonal constitutional rights\u201d\u2014such as the right to a jury\u2014\n\u201cthat dictate the procedures by which civil and criminal\nmatters must be tried.\u201d Id., at 848\u2013849.\n  The Court went on to state that a litigant\u2019s waiver of his\n\u201cpersonal right\u201d to an Article III court is not always dis-\npositive because Article III \u201cnot only preserves to litigants\ntheir interest in an impartial and independent federal\nadjudication of claims . . . , but also serves as \u2018an insepa-\nrable element of the constitutional system of checks and\nbalances.\u2019 . . .

SHARIF\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n     \u201cthe decision to invoke this forum is left entirely to the\n     parties and the power of the federal judiciary to take\n     jurisdiction of these matters is unaffected. In such\n     circumstances, separation of powers concerns are di-\n     minished, for it seems self-evident that just as Con-\n     gress may encourage parties to settle a dispute out of\n     court or resort to arbitration without impermissible\n     incursions on the separation of powers, Congress may\n     make available a quasi-judicial mechanism through\n     which willing parties may, at their option, elect to re-\n     solve their differences.\u201d Id., at 855.\nThe option for parties to submit their disputes to a non-\nArticle III adjudicator was at most a \u201cde minimis\u201d in-\nfringement on the prerogative of the federal courts. Id., at\n856.\n   A few years after Schor, the Court decided a pair of\ncases\u2014Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858 (1989), and\nPeretz v. United States, 501 U. S. 923 (1991)\u2014that reiter-\nated the importance of consent to the constitutional analy-\nsis. Both cases concerned whether the Federal Magis-\ntrates Act authorized magistrate judges to preside over\njury selection in a felony trial;8 the difference was that\nPeretz consented to the practice while Gomez did not.\nThat difference was dispositive.\n   In Gomez, the Court interpreted the statute as not\nallowing magistrate judges to supervise voir dire without\nconsent, emphasizing the constitutional concerns that\nmight otherwise arise. See 490 U. S., at 864. In Peretz,\nthe Court upheld the Magistrate Judge\u2019s action, stating\nthat \u201cthe defendant\u2019s consent significantly changes the\nconstitutional analysis.\u201d 501 U. S., at 932. The Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Inrelevant part, the Act provides that district courts may assign\nmagistrate judges certain enumerated duties as well as \u201csuch additional\nduties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and the laws of\nthe United States.\u201d 28 U.

S., at 848), and that \u201c[t]he\nmost basic rights of criminal defendants are similarly\nsubject to waiver,\u201d 501 U. S., at 936. And \u201c[e]ven assum-\ning that a litigant may not waive structural protections\nprovided by Article III,\u201d the Court found \u201cno such struc-\ntural protections . . . implicated by\u201d a magistrate judge\u2019s\nsupervision of voir dire:\n     \u201cMagistrates are appointed and subject to removal by\n     Article III judges. The \u2018ultimate decision\u2019 whether to\n     invoke the magistrate\u2019s assistance is made by the dis-\n     trict court, subject to veto by the parties. The decision\n     whether to empanel the jury whose selection a magis-\n     trate has supervised also remains entirely with the\n     district court. Because \u2018the entire process takes place\n     under the district court\u2019s total control and jurisdic-\n     tion,\u2019 there is no danger that use of the magistrate in-\n     volves a \u2018congressional attemp[t] \u201cto transfer jurisdic-\n     tion [to non-Article III tribunals] for the purpose of\n     emasculating\u201d constitutional courts.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 937 (ci-\n     tations omitted; alteration in original).9\n  The lesson of Schor, Peretz, and the history that preced-\ned them is plain: The entitlement to an Article III adjudi-\ncator is \u201ca personal right\u201d and thus ordinarily \u201csubject to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Discounting the relevance of Gomez and Peretz, the principal dissent\n\nemphasizes that neither case concerned the entry of final judgment by\na non-Article III actor. See post, at 16 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Here\nagain, the principal dissent\u2019s insistence on formalism leads it astray.\nAs we explained in Peretz, the \u201cresponsibility and importance [of]\npresiding over voir dire at a felony trial\u201d is equivalent to the \u201csupervi-\nsion of entire civil and misdemeanor trials,\u201d 501 U.

Article III also serves a\nstructural purpose, \u201cbarring congressional attempts \u2018to\ntransfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III tribunals] for the\npurpose of emasculating\u2019 constitutional courts and thereby\nprevent[ing] \u2018the encroachment or aggrandizement of one\nbranch at the expense of the other.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 850 (citations\nomitted). But allowing Article I adjudicators to decide\nclaims submitted to them by consent does not offend the\nseparation of powers so long as Article III courts retain\nsupervisory authority over the process.\n                              B\n   The question here, then, is whether allowing bankruptcy\ncourts to decide Stern claims by consent would \u201cimper-\nmissibly threate[n] the institutional integrity of the Judi-\ncial Branch.\u201d Schor, 478 U. S., at 851. And that question\nmust be decided not by \u201cformalistic and unbending rules,\u201d\nbut \u201cwith an eye to the practical effect that the\u201d practice\n\u201cwill have on the constitutionally assigned role of the\nfederal judiciary.\u201d Ibid.; see Thomas v.

Bankruptcy judges, like\nmagistrate judges, \u201care appointed and subject to removal\nby Article III judges,\u201d Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937; see 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7152(a)(1), (e). They \u201cserve as judicial officers of\nthe United States district court,\u201d \u00a7151, and collectively\n\u201cconstitute a unit of the district court\u201d for that district,\n\u00a7152(a)(1). Just as \u201c[t]he \u2018ultimate decision\u2019 whether to\ninvoke [a] magistrate [judge]\u2019s assistance is made by the\ndistrict court,\u201d Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937, bankruptcy courts\nhear matters solely on a district court\u2019s reference, \u00a7157(a),\nwhich the district court may withdraw sua sponte or at the\nrequest of a party, \u00a7157(d). \u201c[S]eparation of powers con-\ncerns are diminished\u201d when, as here, \u201cthe decision to\ninvoke [a non-Article III] forum is left entirely to the\nparties and the power of the federal judiciary to take\njurisdiction\u201d remains in place. Schor, 478 U. S., at 855.\n   Furthermore, like the CFTC in Schor, bankruptcy\ncourts possess no free-floating authority to decide claims\ntraditionally heard by Article III courts. Their ability to\nresolve such matters is limited to \u201ca narrow class of com-\nmon law claims as an incident to the [bankruptcy courts\u2019]\nprimary, and unchallenged, adjudicative function.\u201d Id., at\n854. \u201cIn such circumstances, the magnitude of any intru-\nsion on the Judicial Branch can only be termed de mini-\nmis.\u201d Id., at 856.\n   Finally, there is no indication that Congress gave bank-\nruptcy courts the ability to decide Stern claims in an effort\nto aggrandize itself or humble the Judiciary. As in Peretz,\n\u201c[b]ecause \u2018the entire process takes place under the district\ncourt\u2019s total control and jurisdiction,\u2019 there is no danger\nthat use of the [bankruptcy court] involves a \u2018congres-\nsional attemp[t] \u201cto transfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III\ntribunals] for the purpose of emasculating\u201d constitutional\ncourts.\u2019 \u201d 501 U.

Post, at 16. That argument misapprehends\nboth Schor and the nature of our analysis. What Schor forbids is using\nconsent to excuse an actual violation of Article III. See 478 U. S., at\n850\u2013851 (\u201cTo the extent that th[e] structural principle [protected by\nArticle III] is implicated in a given case, the parties cannot by consent\ncure the constitutional difficulty . . .\u201d (emphasis added)). But Schor\nconfirms that consent remains highly relevant when determining, as we\ndo here, whether a particular adjudication in fact raises constitutional\nconcerns. See id., at 855 (\u201cseparation of powers concerns are dimin-\nished\u201d when \u201cthe decision to invoke [a non-Article III] forum is left\nentirely to the parties\u201d). Thus, we do not rely on Sharif\u2019s consent to\n\u201ccur[e]\u201d a violation of Article III. His consent shows, in part, why no\nsuch violation has occurred. Cf.

That is because Stern\u2014like its predecessor, North-\nern Pipeline\u2014turned on the fact that the litigant \u201cdid not\ntruly consent to\u201d resolution of the claim against it in a\nnon-Article III forum. 564 U.

There, the Court considered whether\nbankruptcy judges \u201ccould \u2018constitutionally be vested with\njurisdiction to decide [a] state-law contract claim\u2019 against\nan entity that was not otherwise part of the bankruptcy\nproceedings.\u201d 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). In answer-\ning that question in the negative, both the plurality and\nthen-Justice Rehnquist, concurring in the judgment, noted\nthat the entity in question did not consent to the bank-\nruptcy court\u2019s adjudication of the claim. See 458 U. S., at\n80, n. 31 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (opinion of\nRehnquist, J.). The Court confirmed in two later cases\nthat Northern Pipeline turned on the lack of consent. See\nSchor, 478 U. S., at 849 (\u201c[I]n Northern Pipeline, . . . the\nabsence of consent to an initial adjudication before a non-\nArticle III tribunal was relied on as a significant factor in\ndetermining that Article III forbade such adjudication\u201d);\nThomas, 473 U. S., at 584.\n   Stern presented the same scenario. The majority cited\nthe dissent\u2019s observation that Northern Pipeline \u201cestab-\nlish[ed] only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article\nIII court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment,\nand issue binding orders in a traditional contract action\narising under state law, without consent of the litigants,\nand subject only to ordinary appellate review,\u201d 564 U.

That could not have been a fair\ncharacterization of the decision if it meant that bank-\nruptcy judges could no longer exercise their longstanding\nauthority to resolve claims submitted to them by consent.\nInterpreting Stern to bar consensual adjudications by\nbankruptcy courts would \u201cmeaningfully chang[e] the\ndivision of labor\u201d in our judicial system, contra, id., at ___\n(slip op., at 37).11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Inadvancing its restrictive view of Stern, the principal dissent\nignores the sweeping jurisprudential implications of its position. If, as\nthe principal dissent suggests, consent is irrelevant to the Article III\nanalysis, it is difficult to see how Schor and Peretz were not wrongly\ndecided. But those decisions obviously remain good law. It is the\nprincipal dissent\u2019s position that breaks with our precedents. See Plaut\nv. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.

The Court has\nnever done what Sharif and the principal dissent would\nhave us do\u2014hold that a litigant who has the right to an\nArticle III court may not waive that right through his\nconsent.\n                               D\n   The principal dissent warns darkly of the consequences\nof today\u2019s decision. See post, at 17\u201320. To hear the princi-\npal dissent tell it, the world will end not in fire, or ice, but\nin a bankruptcy court. The response to these ominous\npredictions is the same now as it was when Justice Bren-\nnan, dissenting in Schor, first made them nearly 30 years\nago:\n      \u201cThis is not to say, of course, that if Congress created\n    a phalanx of non-Article III tribunals equipped to\n    handle the entire business of the Article III courts\n    without any Article III supervision or control and\n    without evidence of valid and specific legislative ne-\n    cessities, the fact that the parties had the election to\n    proceed in their forum of choice would necessarily\n    save the scheme from constitutional attack. But this\n    case obviously bears no resemblance to such a sce-\n    nario . . . .\u201d 478 U. S., at 855 (citations omitted).\n   Adjudication based on litigant consent has been a con-\nsistent feature of the federal court system since its incep-\ntion. Reaffirming that unremarkable fact, we are confi-\ndent, poses no great threat to anyone\u2019s birthrights,\nconstitutional or otherwise.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ntural independence can never be waived simply does not accord with\n\nour cases\u201d).\n\n18         WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n  Sharif contends that to the extent litigants may validly\nconsent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court, such con-\nsent must be express. We disagree.\n  Nothing in the Constitution requires that consent to\nadjudication by a bankruptcy court be express. Nor does\nthe relevant statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157, mandate express\nconsent; it states only that a bankruptcy court must obtain\n\u201cthe consent\u201d\u2014consent simpliciter\u2014\u201cof all parties to the\nproceeding\u201d before hearing and determining a non-core\nclaim. \u00a7157(c)(2). And a requirement of express consent\nwould be in great tension with our decision in Roell v.\nWithrow, 538 U. S. 580 (2003). That case concerned the\ninterpretation of \u00a7636(c), which authorizes magistrate\njudges to \u201cconduct any or all proceedings in a jury or non-\njury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the\ncase,\u201d with \u201cthe consent of the parties.\u201d12 The specific\nquestion in Roell was whether, as a statutory matter, the\n\u201cconsent\u201d required by \u00a7636(c) had to be express. The\ndissent argued that \u201c[r]eading \u00a7636(c)(1) to require ex-\npress consent not only is more consistent with the text of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Consistent with our precedents, the Courts of Appeals have unani-\n\nmously upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7636(c).

But the majority\u2014thus placed on\nnotice of the constitutional concern\u2014was untroubled by it,\nopining that \u201cthe Article III right is substantially honored\u201d\nby permitting waiver based on \u201cactions rather than\nwords.\u201d Id., at 589, 590.\n   The implied consent standard articulated in Roell sup-\nplies the appropriate rule for adjudications by bankruptcy\ncourts under \u00a7157. Applied in the bankruptcy context,\nthat standard possesses the same pragmatic virtues\u2014\nincreasing judicial efficiency and checking gamesman-\nship\u2014that motivated our adoption of it for consent-based\nadjudications by magistrate judges. See id., at 590. It\nbears emphasizing, however, that a litigant\u2019s consent\u2014\nwhether express or implied\u2014must still be knowing and\nvoluntary. Roell makes clear that the key inquiry is\nwhether \u201cthe litigant or counsel was made aware of the\nneed for consent and the right to refuse it, and still volun-\ntarily appeared to try the case\u201d before the non-Article III\nadjudicator. Ibid.; see also id., at 588, n. 5 (\u201cnotification of\nthe right to refuse\u201d adjudication by a non-Article III court\n\u201cis a prerequisite to any inference of consent\u201d).13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Even though the Constitution does not require that consent be\n\nexpress, it is good practice for courts to seek express statements of\nconsent or nonconsent, both to ensure irrefutably that any waiver of the\nright to Article III adjudication is knowing and voluntary and to limit\nsubsequent litigation over the consent issue. Statutes or judicial rules\nmay require express consent where the Constitution does not. Indeed,\nthe Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure already require that\npleadings in adversary proceedings before a bankruptcy court \u201ccontain\na statement that the proceeding is core or non-core and, if non-core,\nthat the pleader does or does not consent to entry of final orders or\njudgment by the bankruptcy judge.\u201d Fed.

The Court faithfully applies Commodity\nFutures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U.

When this\nRule was promulgated, no one was thinking about a Stern\nclaim. But now, assuming that Rule 7012(b) represents a\npermissible interpretation of \u00a7157, the question arises\nwhether a Stern claim should be treated as a non-core or\ncore claim for purposes of the bankruptcy rules.

See 2\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries *471\u2013488. This historical\npractice, combined with Congress\u2019s constitutional author-\nity to enact bankruptcy laws, confirms that Congress may\nassign to non-Article III courts adjudications involving\n\u201cthe restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at\nthe core of the federal bankruptcy power.\u201d Northern Pipe-\nline, 458 U.

In Northern Pipeline, the Court invalidated statu\u00ad\ntory provisions that permitted a bankruptcy court to enter\nfinal judgment on a creditor\u2019s state law claim for breach of\ncontract. Because that claim arose not from the bankruptcy\nbut from independent common law sources, a majority\nof the Court determined that Article III required an adju\u00ad\ndicator with life tenure and salary protection. See id., at\n84; id., at 90\u201391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Congress responded to Northern Pipeline by allowing\nbankruptcy courts to render final judgments only in \u201ccore\u201d\nbankruptcy proceedings. 28 U.

S., at ___\n(slip op., at 34). Like the contract claim in Northern Pipe-\nline, the tort claim in Stern involved \u201cthe stuff of the tradi\u00ad\ntional actions at common law tried by the courts at West\u00ad\nminster in 1789.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting\nNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 90 (Rehnquist, J., concur\u00ad\nring in judgment)). Congress had no power under the\nConstitution to assign the resolution of such a claim to a\njudge who lacked the structural protections of Article III.\n                              B\n  The question here is whether the claim Wellness sub\u00ad\nmitted to the Bankruptcy Court is a \u201cStern claim\u201d that\nrequires final adjudication by an Article III court. See\nExecutive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 573 U. S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2014) (slip op., at 8\u20139) (assuming without decid\u00ad\ning that a fraudulent conveyance action is a \u201cStern claim\u201d).\nAs the Court recounts, Wellness alleged that Sharif had\nconcealed about $5 million of assets by claiming that they\nwere owned by a trust. Wellness sought a declaratory\njudgment that the trust was in fact Sharif \u2019s alter ego and\nthat its assets should accordingly be part of his bankruptcy\nestate. The Bankruptcy Court granted final judgment\n(based on Sharif \u2019s default) to Wellness, declaring that the\ntrust assets were part of Sharif \u2019s estate because he had\ntreated them as his own property. Ante, at 5\u20136.\n  In my view, Article III likely poses no barrier to the\nBankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of Wellness\u2019s claim. At its\nmost basic level, bankruptcy is \u201can adjudication of inter\u00ad\nests claimed in a res.\u201d Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323,\n329 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted). Wellness\nasked the Bankruptcy Court to declare that assets held by\nSharif are part of that res. Defining what constitutes the\n6        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nestate is the necessary starting point of every bankruptcy;\na court cannot divide up the estate without first knowing\nwhat\u2019s in it. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a7541(a). As the Solicitor\nGeneral explains, \u201cIdentifying the property of the estate is\ntherefore inescapably central to the restructuring of the\ndebtor-creditor relationship.\u201d Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 14.\n   Identifying property that constitutes the estate has long\nbeen a central feature of bankruptcy adjudication. Eng\u00ad\nlish bankruptcy commissioners had authority not only to\ncollect property in the debtor\u2019s possession, but also to\n\u201ccause any house or tenement of the bankrupt to be bro\u00ad\nken open,\u201d in order to uncover and seize property the\ndebtor had concealed. 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\n*485. America\u2019s first bankruptcy statute, enacted by\nCongress in 1800, similarly gave commissioners \u201cpower to\ntake into their possession, all the estate, real and personal,\nof every nature and description to which the [debtor] may\nbe entitled, either in law or equity, in any manner whatso\u00ad\never.\u201d \u00a75, 2 Stat. 23. That is peculiarly a bankruptcy\npower.\n   The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 provides further support for\nWellness\u2019s position. Under that Act, bankruptcy referees\nhad authority to exercise \u201csummary\u201d jurisdiction over\ncertain claims, while other claims could only be adjudi-\ncated in \u201cplenary\u201d proceedings before an Article III district\ncourt. See Arkison, 573 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 4\u20135).\nThis Court interpreted the 1898 Act to permit bankruptcy\nreferees to exercise summary jurisdiction to determine\nwhether property in the actual or constructive possession\nof a debtor should come within the estate, at least when no\nthird party asserted more than a \u201cmerely colorable\u201d claim\nto the property. Mueller v. Nugent, 184 U. S. 1, 15 (1902).\nIn the legal parlance of the times, a \u201cmerely colorable\u201d\nclaim was one that existed \u201cin appearance only, and not in\nreality.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 223 (1891).

Taubel-\nScott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, 264 U. S. 426, 431\u2013433 (1924).\n   Here, Sharif does not contest that he held legal title to\nthe assets in the trust. Assuming that no third party\nasserted a substantial adverse claim to those assets\u2014an\ninquiry for the Bankruptcy Court on remand\u2014Wellness\u2019s\nalter ego claim fits comfortably into the category of cases\nthat bankruptcy referees could have decided by them\u00ad\nselves under the 1898 Act.\n   In Mueller, for example, this Court held that a bank\u00ad\nruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction over\nproperty in the possession of a third party acting as the\ndebtor\u2019s agent. 184 U. S., at 14\u201317; see Black\u2019s Law Dic\u00ad\ntionary 302 (10th ed. 2014) (example of a merely \u201ccolor\u00ad\nable\u201d claim is \u201cone made by a person holding property as an\nagent or bailee of the bankrupt\u201d). Similarly, this Court\nheld that a bankruptcy referee could exercise summary\njurisdiction over a creditor\u2019s claim that the debtor had\nconcealed assets under the veil of a corporate entity that\nwas \u201cnothing but a sham and a cloak.\u201d Sampsell v. Impe-\nrial Paper & Color Corp., 313 U. S. 215, 216\u2013217 (1941)\n(internal quotation marks omitted), rev\u2019g 114 F. 2d 49, 52\n(CA9 1940) (describing creditor\u2019s claim that corporation\nwas debtor\u2019s \u201calter ego\u201d). As the Court explained in\nSampsell, the \u201clegal existence of the affiliated corporation\u201d\ndid not automatically require a plenary proceeding, be\u00ad\ncause \u201c[m]ere legal paraphernalia will not suffice to trans\u00ad\nform into a substantial adverse claimant a corporation\nwhose affairs are so closely assimilated to the affairs of the\ndominant stockholder that in substance it is little more\nthan his corporate pocket.\u201d 313 U. S., at 218. Just as the\nbankruptcy referee in that case had authority to decide\nwhether assets allegedly concealed behind the corporate\nveil belonged to the bankruptcy estate, the Bankruptcy\n8        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nCourt here had authority to decide whether the assets\nallegedly concealed in the trust belonged to Sharif \u2019s\nestate.\n   Sharif contends that Wellness\u2019s alter ego claim is more\nlike an allegation of a fraudulent conveyance, which this\nCourt has implied must be adjudicated by an Article III\ncourt. See Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33,\n56 (1989); Arkison, 573 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u20139).\nAlthough both actions aim to remedy a debtor\u2019s deception,\nthey differ in a critical respect. A fraudulent conveyance\nclaim seeks assets in the hands of a third party, while an\nalter ego claim targets only the debtor\u2019s \u201csecond self.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 76 (2d ed. 1954).\nThat distinction is significant given bankruptcy\u2019s historic\ndomain over property within the actual or constructive\n\u201cpossession [of] the bankrupt at the time of the filing of\nthe petition.\u201d Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 309\nU. S. 478, 481 (1940). Through a fraudulent conveyance, a\ndishonest debtor relinquishes possession of assets before\nfiling for bankruptcy. Reclaiming those assets for the\nestate requires depriving third parties of property within\ntheir otherwise lawful possession and control, an action\nthat \u201cquintessentially\u201d required a suit at common law.\nGranfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 56. By contrast, a debtor\u2019s\npossession of property provided \u201can adequate basis\u201d for a\nbankruptcy referee to adjudicate a dispute over title in a\nsummary proceeding. Thompson, 309 U. S., at 482; see\nMueller, 184 U. S., at 15\u201316 (distinguishing claim to prop\u00ad\nerty in possession of debtor\u2019s agent from fraudulent con\u00ad\nveyance claim in determining that bankruptcy referee\ncould exercise summary jurisdiction).\n   In sum, unlike the fraudulent conveyance claim in\nGranfinanciera, Wellness\u2019s alter ego claim alleges that\nassets within Sharif \u2019s actual or constructive possession\nbelong to his estate. And unlike the breach of contract\nand tort claims at issue in Northern Pipeline and Stern,\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nWellness\u2019s claim stems not from any independent source of\nlaw but \u201cfrom the bankruptcy itself.\u201d Stern, 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 34). Provided that no third party asserted\na substantial adverse claim to the trust assets, Wellness\u2019s\nclaim therefore falls within the narrow historical excep\u00ad\ntion that permits a non-Article III adjudicator in certain\nbankruptcy proceedings. I would reverse the contrary\nholding by the Court of Appeals and end our inquiry there,\nrather than deciding a broader question that may not be\nnecessary to the disposition of this case.\n                              II\n   The Court \u201cexpresses no view\u201d on whether Wellness\u2019s\nclaim was a Stern claim. Ante, at 8, n. 7. Instead, the\nCourt concludes that the Bankruptcy Court had constitu\u00ad\ntional authority to enter final judgment on Wellness\u2019s\nclaim either way. The majority rests its decision on Sha\u00ad\nrif \u2019s purported consent to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s adjudi\u00ad\ncation. But Sharif has no authority to compromise the\nstructural separation of powers or agree to an exercise of\njudicial power outside Article III. His consent therefore\ncannot cure a constitutional violation.\n                              A\n   \u201c[I]f there is a principle in our Constitution . . . more\nsacred than another,\u201d James Madison said on the floor of\nthe First Congress, \u201cit is that which separates the Legisla\u00ad\ntive, Executive, and Judicial powers.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong.\n581 (1789). A strong word, \u201csacred.\u201d Madison was the\nprincipal drafter of the Constitution, and he knew what he\nwas talking about. By diffusing federal powers among\nthree different branches, and by protecting each branch\nagainst incursions from the others, the Framers devised a\nstructure of government that promotes both liberty and\naccountability.

Klein, 13 Wall. 128\n(1872); Hayburn\u2019s Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792).\n   In these and other cases, we have emphasized that the\nvalues of liberty and accountability protected by the sepa\u00ad\nration of powers belong not to any branch of the Govern\u00ad\nment but to the Nation as a whole. See Bowsher, 478\nU. S., at 722. A branch\u2019s consent to a diminution of its\nconstitutional powers therefore does not mitigate the\nharm or cure the wrong. \u201cLiberty is always at stake when\none or more of the branches seek to transgress the separa\u00ad\ntion of powers.\u201d Clinton v.

To the contrary, the branches\u2019 \u201centhusi\u00ad\nasm\u201d for the offending arrangements \u201c \u2018sharpened rather\nthan blunted\u2019 our review.\u201d Noel Canning, 573 U. S., at ___\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4) (quot\u00ad\ning Chadha, 462 U. S, at 944). In short, because the\nstructural provisions of the Constitution protect liberty\nand not just government entities, \u201cthe separation of pow\u00ad\ners does not depend on . . . whether \u2018the encroached-upon\nbranch approves the encroachment.\u2019 \u201d PCAOB, 561 U.

Just as a branch of Government\nmay not consent away the individual liberty interest\nprotected by the separation of powers, so too an individual\nmay not consent away the institutional interest protected\nby the separation of powers. To be sure, a private litigant\nmay consensually relinquish individual constitutional\nrights. A federal criminal defendant, for example, may\nknowingly and voluntarily waive his Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial by pleading guilty to a charged offense.\nSee Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). But\nthat same defendant may not agree to stand trial on fed\u00ad\neral charges before a state court, a foreign court, or a moot\ncourt, because those courts have no constitutional author\u00ad\n12       WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

A \u201clack of federal jurisdiction cannot be\nwaived or be overcome by an agreement of the parties.\u201d\nMitchell v. Maurer, 293 U. S. 237, 244 (1934).\n   As the majority recognizes, the Court\u2019s most extensive\ndiscussion of litigant consent in a separation of powers\ncase occurred in Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v.\nSchor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986). There the Court held that\nArticle III confers both a \u201cpersonal right\u201d that can be\nwaived through consent and a structural component that\n\u201csafeguards the role of the Judicial Branch in our tripar\u00ad\ntite system.\u201d Id., at 848, 850. \u201cTo the extent that this\nstructural principle is implicated in a given case, the\nparties cannot by consent cure the constitutional difficulty\nfor the same reason that the parties by consent cannot\nconfer on federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction beyond\nthe limitations imposed by Article III.\u201d Id., at 850\u2013851.\nThus, when \u201cArticle III limitations are at issue, notions of\nconsent and waiver cannot be dispositive because the\nlimitations serve institutional interests that the parties\ncannot be expected to protect.\u201d Id., at 851.\n   Schor\u2019s holding that a private litigant can consent to an\nArticle III violation that affects only his \u201cpersonal right\u201d\nhas been vigorously contested. See id., at 867 (Brennan,\nJ., dissenting) (\u201cBecause the individual and structural\ninterests served by Article III are coextensive, I do not\nbelieve that a litigant may ever waive his right to an\nArticle III tribunal where one is constitutionally re\u00ad\nquired\u201d); Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 70 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). But\nwhatever the merits of that position, nobody disputes that\nSchor forbids a litigant from consenting to a constitutional\nviolation when the structural component of Article III \u201cis\nimplicated.\u201d 478 U. S., at 850\u2013851. Thus, the key inquiry\nin this case\u2014as the majority puts it\u2014is \u201cwhether allowing\nbankruptcy courts to decide Stern claims by consent would\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

S.,\nat 851; alteration omitted).\n   One need not search far to find the answer. In Stern,\nthis Court applied the analysis from Schor to bankruptcy\ncourts and concluded that they lack Article III authority to\nenter final judgments on matters now known as Stern\nclaims. The Court noted that bankruptcy courts, unlike\nthe administrative agency in Schor, were endowed by\nCongress with \u201csubstantive jurisdiction reaching any area\nof the corpus juris,\u201d power to render final judgments en\u00ad\nforceable without any action by Article III courts, and\nauthority to adjudicate counterclaims entirely independ\u00ad\nent of the bankruptcy itself. 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op.,\nat 25\u201329). The Court concluded that allowing Congress to\nbestow such authority on non-Article III courts would\n\u201ccompromise the integrity of the system of separated\npowers and the role of the Judiciary in that system.\u201d Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 38). If there was any room for doubt\nabout the basis for its holding, the Court dispelled it by\nasking a question: \u201cIs there really a threat to the separa\u00ad\ntion of powers where Congress has conferred the judicial\npower outside Article III only over certain counterclaims\nin bankruptcy?\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 37). \u201cThe short but\nemphatic answer is yes.\u201d Ibid.\n   In other words, allowing bankruptcy courts to decide\nStern claims by consent would \u201cimpermissibly threaten\nthe institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.\u201d Ante, at\n12 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). It is\nlittle wonder that the Court of Appeals felt itself bound by\nStern and Schor to hold that Sharif \u2019s consent could not\ncure the Stern violation. 727 F. 3d 751, 771 (CA7 2013).\nOther Courts of Appeals have adopted the same reading.\nSee In re BP RE, L. P., 735 F. 3d 279, 287 (CA5 2013);\nWaldman v. Stone, 698 F. 3d 910, 917\u2013918 (CA6 2012).\n   The majority attempts to avoid this conclusion through\n14       WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nan imaginative reconstruction of Stern. As the majority\nsees it, Stern \u201cturned on the fact that the litigant \u2018did not\ntruly consent to\u2019 resolution of the claim\u201d against him in\nthe Bankruptcy Court. Ante, at 15 (quoting 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 27)). That is not a proper reading of the\ndecision. The constitutional analysis in Stern, spanning\n22 pages, contained exactly one affirmative reference to\nthe lack of consent. See ibid. That reference came amid a\nlong list of factors distinguishing the proceeding in Stern\nfrom the proceedings in Schor and other \u201cpublic rights\u201d\ncases. 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 27\u201329). Stern\u2019s\nsubsequent sentences made clear that the notions of con\u00ad\nsent relied upon by the Court in Schor did not apply in\nbankruptcy because \u201ccreditors lack an alternative forum to\nthe bankruptcy court in which to pursue their claims.\u201d\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 28) (quoting Granfinanciera,\n492 U. S., at 59, n. 14). Put simply, the litigant in Stern\ndid not consent because he could not consent given the\nnature of bankruptcy.\n  There was an opinion in Stern that turned heavily on\nconsent: the dissent. 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (opinion of\nBREYER, J.) (slip op., at 12\u201314). The Stern majority re\u00ad\nsponded to the dissent with a counterfactual: Even if\nconsent were relevant to the analysis, that factor would\nnot change the result because the litigant did not truly\nconsent. Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 28\u201329). Moreover,\nStern held that \u201cit does not matter who\u201d authorizes a\nbankruptcy judge to render final judgments on Stern\nclaims, because the \u201cconstitutional bar remains.\u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 36). That holding is incompatible with the\nmajority\u2019s conclusion today that two litigants can author\u00ad\nize a bankruptcy judge to render final judgments on Stern\nclaims, despite the constitutional bar that remains.\n  The majority also relies heavily on the supervision and\ncontrol that Article III courts exercise over bankruptcy\ncourts.

The problem is that\nCongress has also given bankruptcy courts authority to\nenter final judgments subject only to deferential appellate\nreview, and Article III precludes those judgments when\nthey involve Stern claims. The fact that Article III judges\nplayed a role in the Article III violation does not remedy\nthe constitutional harm. We have already explained why.\n   It is a fundamental principle that no branch of govern\u00ad\nment can delegate its constitutional functions to an actor\nwho lacks authority to exercise those functions.

Article III judges have no constitutional\nauthority to delegate the judicial power\u2014the power to\n\u201crender dispositive judgments\u201d\u2014to non-Article III judges,\nno matter how closely they control or supervise their\nwork. Plaut, 514 U. S., at 219 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   In any event, the majority\u2019s arguments about supervi\u00ad\nsion and control are not new. They were considered and\nrejected in Stern. See 564 U.

The\nmajority points to no differences between the bankruptcy\nproceeding in Stern and the bankruptcy proceeding here,\nexcept for Sharif \u2019s purported consent. The majority thus\ntreats consent as \u201cdispositive\u201d in curing the structural\nseparation of powers violation\u2014precisely what Schor said\nconsent could not do. 478 U. S., at 851.\n                               C\n   Eager to change the subject from Stern, the majority\ndevotes considerable attention to defending the authority\nof magistrate judges, who may conduct certain proceed\u00ad\nings with the consent of the parties under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7636. No one here challenges the constitutionality of\nmagistrate judges or disputes that they, like bankruptcy\njudges, may issue reports and recommendations that are\nreviewed de novo by Article III judges. The cases about\nmagistrate judges cited by the majority therefore have\nlittle bearing on this case, because none of them involved a\nconstitutional challenge to the entry of final judgment by a\nnon-Article III actor. See Roell v. Withrow, 538 U. S. 580\n(2003) (statutory challenge only); Peretz v. United States,\n501 U. S. 923 (1991) (challenge to a magistrate judge\u2019s\nconduct of voir dire in a felony trial); Gomez v. United\nStates, 490 U. S. 858 (1989) (same).\n   The majority also points to 19th-century cases in which\ncourts referred disputes to non-Article III referees, mas\u00ad\nters, or arbitrators. Ante, at 8. In those cases, however, it\nwas the Article III court that ultimately entered final\njudgment. E.g., Thornton v. Carson, 7 Cranch 596, 600\n(1813) (\u201cthe Court was right in entering the judgment for\nthe sums awarded\u201d). Article III courts do refer matters to\nnon-Article III actors for assistance from time to time.\nThis Court does so regularly in original jurisdiction cases.\nSee, e.g., Kansas v. Nebraska, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n(slip op., at 1). But under the Constitution, the \u201cultimate\nresponsibility for deciding\u201d the case must remain with the\nArticle III court. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Colo-\nrado v. New Mexico, 467 U. S. 310, 317 (1984)).\n   The concurrence\u2019s comparison of bankruptcy judges to\narbitrators is similarly inapt. Ante, at 1 (opinion of ALITO,\nJ.). Arbitration is \u201ca matter of contract\u201d by which parties\nagree to resolve their disputes in a private forum. Rent-A-\nCenter, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. 63, 67 (2010).\nSuch an arrangement does not implicate Article III any\nmore than does an agreement between two business part\u00ad\nners to submit a difference of opinion to a mutually trusted\nfriend. Arbitration agreements, like most private con\u00ad\ntracts, can be enforced in court. And Congress, pursuant\nto its Commerce Clause power, has authorized district\ncourts to enter judgments enforcing arbitration awards\nunder certain circumstances. See 9 U. S. C. \u00a79. But this\nordinary scheme of contract enforcement creates no consti\u00ad\ntutional concern. As the concurrence acknowledges, only\nArticle III judges\u2014not arbitrators\u2014may enter final judg\u00ad\nments enforcing arbitration awards. Ante, at 1.\n   The discussion of magistrate judges, masters, arbitra\u00ad\ntors, and the like fits with the majority\u2019s focus on the\nsupposedly dire consequences that would follow a decision\nthat parties cannot consent to the final adjudication of\nStern claims in bankruptcy courts. Of course, it \u201cgoes\nwithout saying\u201d that practical considerations of efficiency\nand convenience cannot trump the structural protections\nof the Constitution. Stern, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n36); see Perez, 575 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 20) (\u201cEven in the face of perceived\nnecessity, the Constitution protects us from ourselves.\u201d).\nAnd I find it hard to believe that the Framers in Philadel\u00ad\nphia, who took great care to ensure that the Judiciary was\n\u201ctruly distinct\u201d from the Legislature, would have been\ncomforted to know that Congress\u2019s incursion here could\n18       WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

S., at 856).\n   In any event, the majority overstates the consequences\nof enforcing the requirements of Article III in this case. As\nexplained in Part I, Wellness\u2019s claim may not be a Stern\nclaim, in which case the bankruptcy statute would apply\nprecisely as Congress wrote it. Even if Wellness\u2019s claim\nwere a Stern claim, the District Court would not need to\nstart from scratch. As this Court held in Arkison, the\nDistrict Court could treat the bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision\nas a recommendation and enter judgment after performing\nde novo review. 573 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   In Stern, the Court cautioned that Congress \u201cmay no\nmore lawfully chip away at the authority of the Judicial\nBranch than it may eliminate it entirely.\u201d 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 37). The majority sees no reason to fret,\nhowever, so long as two private parties consent. Ante, at\n14, n. 10. But such parties are unlikely to carefully weigh\nthe long-term structural independence of the Article III\njudiciary against their own short-term priorities. Perhaps\nthe majority\u2019s acquiescence in this diminution of constitu\u00ad\ntional authority will escape notice. Far more likely, how\u00ad\never, it will amount to the kind of \u201cblueprint for extensive\nexpansion of the legislative power\u201d that we have resisted\nin the past. PCAOB, 561 U. S., at 500 (quoting Metropoli-\ntan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abate-\nment of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 277 (1991)).\n   The encroachment at issue here may seem benign\nenough. Bankruptcy judges are devoted professionals who\nstrive to be fair to all sides, and litigants can be trusted to\nprotect their own interests when deciding whether to\nconsent. But the fact remains that Congress controls the\nsalary and tenure of bankruptcy judges, and the Legisla\u00ad\nture\u2019s present solicitude provides no guarantee of its fu\u00ad\nture restraint. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530,\n534 (1962) (plurality opinion). Once Congress knows that\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nit can assign federal claims to judges outside Article III\nwith the parties\u2019 consent, nothing would limit its exercise\nof that power to bankruptcy. Congress may consider it\nadvantageous to allow claims to be heard before judges\nsubject to greater legislative control in any number of\nareas of federal concern. As for the requirement of con\u00ad\nsent, Congress can find ways to \u201cencourage\u201d consent, say\nby requiring it as a condition of federal benefits. That has\nworked to expand Congress\u2019s power before. See, e.g.,\nCollege Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary\nEd. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999) (\u201cCongress\nmay, in the exercise of its spending power, condition its\ngrant of funds to the States upon their taking certain\nactions that Congress could not require them to take\u201d);\nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 207 (1987) (same).\n   Legislative designs of this kind would not displace the\nArticle III judiciary overnight. But steady erosion of\nArticle III authority, no less than a brazen usurpation,\nviolates the constitutional separation of powers. In a\nFederal Government of limited powers, one branch\u2019s loss is\nanother branch\u2019s gain, see PCAOB, 561 U. S., at 500, so\nwhether a branch aims to \u201carrogate power to itself \u201d or to\n\u201cimpair another in the performance of its constitutional\nduties,\u201d the Constitution forbids the transgression all the\nsame. Loving, 517 U. S., at 757. As we have cautioned,\n\u201c[s]light encroachments create new boundaries from which\nlegions of power can seek new territory to capture.\u201d Stern,\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 38) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   The Framers understood this danger. They warned that\nthe Legislature would inevitably seek to draw greater\npower into its \u201cimpetuous vortex,\u201d The Federalist No. 48,\nat 309 (J. Madison), and that \u201cpower over a man\u2019s subsist\u00ad\nence amounts to a power over his will,\u201d id., No. 79, at 472\n(A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted). In response, the Fram\u00ad\ners adopted the structural protections of Article III, \u201ces\u00ad\n20       WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

S., at\n239. As this Court once put it, invoking Frost, \u201cGood\nfences make good neighbors.\u201d Id., at 240.\n  Ultimately, however, the structural protections of Arti\u00ad\ncle III are only as strong as this Court\u2019s will to enforce\nthem. In Madison\u2019s words, the \u201cgreat security against a\ngradual concentration of the several powers in the same\ndepartment consists in giving to those who administer\neach department the necessary constitutional means and\npersonal motives to resist encroachments of the others.\u201d\nThe Federalist No. 51, at 321\u2013322 (J. Madison). The\nCourt today declines to resist encroachment by the Legis\u00ad\nlature. Instead it holds that a single federal judge, for\nreasons adequate to him, may assign away our hard-won\nconstitutional birthright so long as two private parties\nagree. I hope I will be wrong about the consequences of\nthis decision for the independence of the Judicial Branch.\nBut for now, another literary passage comes to mind: It\nprofits the Court nothing to give its soul for the whole\nworld . . . but to avoid Stern claims?\n  I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

See Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___ (2011). I write\nseparately to highlight a few questions touching on the\nconsent issue that merit closer attention than either the\nCourt or THE CHIEF JUSTICE gives them.\n  I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that individuals cannot\nconsent to violations of the Constitution, but this principle\nhas nothing to do with whose interest the violated provi-\nsion protects. Anytime the Federal Government acts in a\nmanner inconsistent with the separation of powers, it acts\nin excess of its constitutional authority. That authority is\ncarefully defined by the Constitution, and, except through\nArticle V\u2019s amendment process, that document does not\npermit individuals to bestow additional power upon the\nGovernment.\n  The majority today authorizes non-Article III courts to\nadjudicate, with consent, claims that we have held to\nrequire an exercise of the judicial power based on its as-\nsessment that few \u201cstructural interests\u201d are implicated by\nconsent to the adjudication of Stern claims. See ante, at 7,\n12. That reasoning is flawed. It matters not whether we\nthink the particular violation threatens the structure of\n2        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nour Government. Our duty is to enforce the Constitution\nas written, not as revised by private consent, innocuous or\notherwise. Worse, amidst the tempest over whether\n\u201cstructural interests\u201d are implicated when an individual\nconsents to adjudication of Stern claims by a non-Article\nIII court, both the majority and THE CHIEF JUSTICE fail to\ngrapple with the antecedent question: whether a violation\nof the Constitution has actually occurred. That question is\na difficult one, and the majority makes a grave mistake by\nskipping over it in its quest to answer the question whether\nconsent can authorize a constitutional violation. Because\nI would resolve this case on narrower grounds, I need not\ndecide that question here. I nevertheless write separately\nto highlight the complexity of the issues the majority\nsimply brushes past.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   \u201cThe principle, that [the Federal Government] can\nexercise only the powers granted to it, . . . is now univer-\nsally admitted.\u201d McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316,\n405 (1819). A corollary to this principle is that each\nbranch of the Government is limited to the exercise of\nthose powers granted to it. Every violation of the separa-\ntion of powers thus involves an exercise of power in excess\nof the Constitution. And because the only authorities\ncapable of granting power are the Constitution itself, and\nthe people acting through the amendment process, indi-\nvidual consent cannot authorize the Government to exceed\nconstitutional boundaries.\n   This does not mean, however, that consent is invariably\nirrelevant to the constitutional inquiry. Although it may\nnot authorize a constitutional violation, consent may\nprevent one from occurring in the first place. This concept\nis perhaps best understood with the example on which the\nmajority and THE CHIEF JUSTICE both rely: the right to a\n                      Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                     3\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\njury trial. Ante, at 9 (majority opinion); ante, at 11\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).1 Although the Government\nincurably contravenes the Constitution when it acts in\nviolation of the jury trial right, our precedents permit the\nGovernment to convict a criminal defendant without a\njury trial when he waives that right. See Brady v. United\nStates, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). The defendant\u2019s waiver\nis thus a form of consent that lifts a limitation on govern-\nment action by satisfying its terms\u2014that is, the right is\nexercised and honored, not disregarded. See Patton v.\nUnited States, 281 U. S. 276, 296\u2013298 (1930), abrogated on\nother grounds by Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970).\nProvided the Government otherwise acts within its pow-\ners, there is no constitutional violation.\n                              B\n  Consent to the adjudication of Stern claims by bank-\nruptcy courts is a far more complex matter than waiver of\na jury trial. Two potential violations of the separation of\npowers occur whenever bankruptcy courts adjudicate\nStern claims. First, the bankruptcy courts purport to\nexercise power that the Constitution vests exclusively in\nthe judiciary, even though they are not Article III courts\nbecause bankruptcy judges do not enjoy the tenure and\nsalary protections required by Article III. See Art. III, \u00a71.\nSecond, the bankruptcy courts act pursuant to statutory\nauthorization that is itself invalid. For even when acting\npursuant to an enumerated power, such as the bankruptcy\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 There is some dispute whether the guarantee of a jury trial protects\nan individual right, a structural right, or both, raising serious questions\nabout how it should be treated under Commodity Futures Trading\nComm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986). My view, which does not turn\non such taxonomies, leaves no doubt: It is a \u201cfundamental reservation\nof power in our constitutional structure,\u201d Blakely v. Washington, 542\nU. S. 296, 306 (2004), meaning its violation may not be authorized by\nthe consent of the individual.\n4        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npower, Congress exceeds its authority when it purports to\nauthorize a person or entity to perform a function that\nrequires the exercise of a power vested elsewhere by the\nConstitution. See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns.,\nInc., 531 U. S. 457, 472 (2001).\n   Rather than attempt to grapple with these problems,\nthe majority seizes on some statements from Commodity\nFutures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986), to\nresolve the difficult constitutional issue before us. See\nante, at 9\u201312. But to the extent Schor suggests that indi-\nvidual consent could authorize non-Article III courts to\nexercise the judicial power, 478 U. S., at 850\u2013851, it was\nwrongly decided and should be abandoned. Consent to\nadjudication by non-Article III judges may waive whatever\nindividual right to impartial adjudication Article III im-\nplies, thereby lifting that affirmative barrier on Govern-\nment action. But non-Article III courts must still act\nwithin the bounds of their constitutional authority. That\nis, they must act through a power properly delegated to\nthe Federal Government and not vested by the Constitu-\ntion in a different governmental actor. Because the judi-\ncial power is vested exclusively in Article III courts, non-\nArticle III courts may not exercise it.\n   Schor\u2019s justification for authorizing such a transgression\nwas that it judged the \u201cpractical effect [the allocation\nwould] have on the constitutionally assigned role of the\nfederal judiciary\u201d not to be too great. Id., at 851. But we\n\u201ccan[not] preserve a system of separation of powers on the\nbasis of such intuitive judgments regarding \u2018practical\neffects.\u2019 \u201d Granfinanciera, S. A. v.

Our Constitution is not a matter of\nconvenience, to be invoked when we feel uncomfortable\nwith some Government action and cast aside when we do\nnot. See Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., ante, at 5\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n                              II\n  Properly understood, then, the answer to the consent\nquestion in this case depends on whether bankruptcy\ncourts act within the bounds of their constitutional au-\nthority when they adjudicate Stern claims with the con-\nsent of the parties. In order to answer that question, we\nmust consider what form of governmental power that type\nof adjudication requires and whether bankruptcy courts\nare qualified to exercise that power. Department of\nTransportation v. Association of American Railroads, ante,\nat 24 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n  Many Government functions \u201cmay be performed by two\nor more branches without either exceeding its enumerated\npowers under the Constitution.\u201d Ante, at 4. Certain core\nfunctions, however, demand the exercise of legislative,\nexecutive, or judicial power, and their allocation is con-\ntrolled by the Vesting Clauses contained in the first three\narticles of the Constitution. Ibid. We have already held\nthat adjudicating Stern claims, at least without consent of\nthe parties, requires an exercise of the judicial power\nvested exclusively in Article III courts. Stern, 564 U. S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 28\u201329). The difficult question pre-\nsented by this case, which the Court glosses over, is\nwhether the parties\u2019 consent somehow transforms the\nnature of the power exercised.\n                         A\n  As the concepts were understood at the time of the\n6        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfounding, the legislative, executive, and judicial powers\nplayed different roles in the resolution of cases and con-\ntroversies. In this context, the judicial power is the power\n\u201cto determine all differences according to the established\nlaw\u201d; the legislative power is the power to make that\n\u201cestablished law\u201d; and the executive power is the power \u201cto\nback and support the sentence, and to give it due execu-\ntion.\u201d J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government\n\u00a7\u00a7124\u2013126, pp. 62\u201363 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (Locke); see also\nWayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 46 (1825).\n   It should be immediately apparent that consent does not\ntransform the adjudication of Stern claims into a function\nthat requires the exercise of legislative or executive power.\nParties by their consent do not transform the function of\nadjudicating controversies into the functions of creating\nrules or enforcing judgments.\n   The more difficult question is whether consent somehow\neliminates the need for an exercise of the judicial power.\nOur precedents reveal that the resolution of certain cases\nor controversies requires the exercise of that power, but\nthat others \u201cmay or may not\u201d be brought \u201cwithin the cog-\nnizance of [Article III courts], as [Congress] deem[s] proper.\u201d\nMurray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18\nHow. 272, 284 (1856). The distinction generally has to\ndo with the types of rights at issue. Disposition of private\nrights to life, liberty, and property falls within the core of\nthe judicial power, whereas disposition of public rights\ndoes not. From that core of the judicial power, we have\nidentified two narrow historical exceptions. Those excep-\ntions, along with the treatment of cases or controversies\nnot falling within that core, provide useful guidance for\nunderstanding whether bankruptcy courts\u2019 adjudication of\nStern claims with the consent of the parties requires the\nexercise of Article III judicial power.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

Lawson, Territo-\nrial Governments and the Limits of Formalism, 78 Cal. L. Rev. 853, 892\n(1990) (criticizing it as \u201cfatuous\u201d dictum). On the one hand, some early\nevidence suggests that the courts were thought to be dealing primarily\nwith local matters that lie beyond federal judicial cognizance. Pfander,\nArticle I Tribunals, Article III Courts, and the Judicial Power of the\nUnited States, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 643, 706\u2013711 (2004). Yet Canter\ninvolved a controversy indisputably capable of adjudication by Article\nIII courts, because it both arose in admiralty and fell within the Su-\npreme Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. Pfander, supra, at 713\u2013714, n.\n314. The best explanation for this apparent tension is that territorial\ncourts adjudicate matters that Congress may or may not assign to\nArticle III courts, as it wishes. Nelson, Adjudication in the Political\nBranches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 575\u2013576 (2007). To recognize\nCongress\u2019 discretion requires no distortion of the meaning of judicial\npower because Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s reasoning has nothing to do\nwith the intrinsic qualities of the adjudication itself\u2014e.g., whether it\ninvolves \u201cthe stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried by the\n8         WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, 78\u201379\n(1858). Whatever their historical validity, these prece-\ndents exempt cases arising in the territories and in the\nland and naval forces from Article III because of other\nprovisions of the Constitution, not because of the defini-\ntion of judicial power in Article III itself. See Nelson,\nAdjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev.\n559, 576 (2007) (noting that both exceptions enjoy \u201cspecial\ntextual rationales that d[o] not spill over into other\nareas\u201d).\n   The third category consists of so-called \u201cpublic rights\u201d\ncases. Unlike the other two categories, which reflect\ncarve-outs from the core of the judicial power, this cate-\ngory describes cases outside of that core and therefore has\nmore to tell us about the scope of the judicial power.\n   The distinction between disputes involving \u201cpublic\nrights\u201d and those involving \u201cprivate rights\u201d is longstand-\ning, but the contours of the \u201cpublic rights\u201d doctrine have\nbeen the source of much confusion and controversy. See\ngenerally Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 66\u201370 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.) (tracing the evolution of the doctrine). Our\ncases attribute the doctrine to this Court\u2019s mid-19th cen-\ntury decision, Murray\u2019s Lessee, supra. In that case, the\nCourt observed that there are certain cases addressing\n\u201cpublic rights, which may be presented in such form that\nthe judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which\nare susceptible of judicial determination, but which con-\ngress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ncourts of Westminster in 1789,\u201d Stern v.

Smith, 4 Wend. 9, 21 (N. Y. 1829) (Walworth, C.).\nThis distinction is significant to our understanding of\nArticle III, for while the legislative and executive branches\nmay dispose of public rights at will\u2014including through\nnon-Article III adjudications\u2014an exercise of the judicial\npower is required \u201cwhen the government want[s] to act\nauthoritatively upon core private rights that had vested in\na particular individual.\u201d Nelson, supra, at 569; see B&B\nHardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., ante, at 11\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   The distinction was well known at the time of the found-\ning. In the tradition of John Locke, William Blackstone in\nhis Commentaries identified the private rights to life,\nliberty, and property as the three \u201cabsolute\u201d rights\u2014so\ncalled because they \u201cappertain[ed] and belong[ed] to par-\nticular men . . . merely as individuals,\u201d not \u201cto them as\nmembers of society [or] standing in various relations to\neach other\u201d\u2014that is, not dependent upon the will of the\ngovernment. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 119 (1765) (Commentaries); see also Nelson,\nsupra, at 567.3 Public rights, by contrast, belonged to \u201cthe\nwhole community, considered as a community, in its social\naggregate capacity.\u201d 4 Commentaries 5 (1769); see also\nNelson, supra, at 567. As the modern doctrine of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The protection of private rights in the Anglo-American tradition\n\ngoes back to at least Magna Carta. The original 1215 charter is replete\nwith restrictions on the King\u2019s ability to proceed against private rights,\nincluding most notably the provision that \u201c[n]o free man shall be taken,\nimprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, . . .\nexcept by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.\u201d\nA.

L. Rev. 401, 413\n(1958).\n   The Founders carried this idea forward into the Vesting\nClauses of our Constitution. Those Clauses were under-\nstood to play a role in ensuring that the federal courts\nalone could act to deprive individuals of private rights\nbecause the power to act conclusively against those rights\nwas the core of the judicial power. As one early treatise\nexplained, the judiciary is \u201cthat department of the gov-\nernment to whom the protection of the rights of the indi-\nvidual is by the constitution especially confided.\u201d 1 St.\nGeorge Tucker, Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, App. 357\n(1803). If \u201cpublic rights\u201d were not thought to fall within\nthe core of the judicial power, then that could explain why\nCongress would be able to perform or authorize non-\nArticle III adjudications of public rights without trans-\ngressing Article III\u2019s Vesting Clause.\n   Nineteenth-century American jurisprudence confirms\nthat an exercise of the judicial power was thought to be\nnecessary for the disposition of private, but not public,\nrights.4 See B&B Hardware, ante, at 12. The treatment of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Contemporary state-court decisions provide even more explication of\n\nthe distinction between public and private rights, and many expressly\ntie the distinction to the separation of powers. See, e.g., Newland v.\nMarsh, 19 Ill. 376, 383 (1857) (\u201cThe legislative power . . . cannot di-\nrectly reach the property or vested rights of the citizen, by providing for\ntheir forfeiture or transfer to another, without trial and judgment in\nthe courts; for to do so, would be the exercise of a power which belongs\nto another branch of the government, and is forbidden to the legisla-\nture\u201d); see also Gaines v. Gaines, 48 Ky. 295, 301 (1848) (describing the\njudiciary as \u201cthe tribunal appointed by the Constitution and the law,\nfor the ascertainment of private rights and the redress of private\nwrongs\u201d); State ex rel.

See generally Nelson, 107 Colum. L. Rev., at\n577\u2013578 (discussing land patents).         That differential\ntreatment reflected the fact that, once \u201clegal title passed\nout of the United States,\u201d the patent \u201c[u]ndoubtedly\u201d\nconstituted \u201ca vested right\u201d and consequently could \u201conly\nbe divested according to law.\u201d Johnson v. Towsley, 13\nWall. 72, 84\u201385 (1871). By contrast, a party who sought to\nprotect only a \u201cpublic right\u201d in the land had no such vested\nright and could not invoke the intervention of Article III\ncourts. See Smelting Co. v. Kemp, 104 U. S. 636, 647\n(1882) (\u201cIt does not lie in the mouth of a stranger to the\ntitle to complain of the act of the government with respect\nto it\u201d); see also Bagnell v. Broderick, 13 Pet. 436, 450\n(1839) (refusing to examine the propriety of a land patent\non the ground that \u201cCongress has the sole power to declare\nthe dignity and effect of titles emanating from the United\nStates\u201d).\n   Over time, the line between public and private rights\nhas blurred, along with the Court\u2019s treatment of the\njudicial power. See B&B Hardware, ante, at 9\u201310, 12.\nThe source of the confusion may be Murray\u2019s Lessee\u2014the\nputative source of the public rights doctrine itself. Dic-\ntum in the case muddles the distinction between private\nand public rights, and the decision is perhaps better\nread as an expression of the principle of sovereign im-\nmunity. Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 68\u201369 (opinion of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nof person between private parties is judicial, and can only be conferred\non the courts\u201d); see generally T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 175\n(1868) (explaining that only the judicial power was thought capable of\ndisposing of private rights).\n12         WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nSCALIA, J.).5 Some cases appear to have done just that,\nthus reading Murray\u2019s Lessee to apply only in disputes\narising between the Government and others. See, e.g.,\nCrowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50 (1932).\n   Another strain of cases has confused the distinction\nbetween private and public rights, with some cases treat-\ning public rights as the equivalent of private rights enti-\ntled to full judicial review, American School of Magnetic\nHealing v. McAnnulty, 187 U. S. 94, 108 (1902), and\nothers treating what appear to be private rights as public\nrights on which executive action could be conclusive, see,\ne.g., Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U. S.\n381, 401\u2013404 (1940); see also B&B Hardware, ante, at 12\n(observing that Sunshine Anthracite may reflect a unique\nhistorical exception for tax cases). Cf. Northern Pipeline,\n458 U. S., at 84\u201385 (plurality opinion) (discussing other\ncases that appear to reflect the historical distinction\nbetween private rights and rights created by Congress).\nPerhaps this confusion explains why the Court has more\nrecently expanded the concept of public rights to include\nany right \u201cso closely integrated into a public regulatory\nscheme as to be a matter appropriate for agency resolu-\ntion with limited involvement by the Article III judici-\nary.\u201d Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products\nCo., 473 U. S. 568, 593\u2013594 (1985). A return to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Another potential explanation is that Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken\n\nLand & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272 (1856), recognized yet another\nspecial exception to Article III\u2019s allocation of judicial power, applicable\nwhenever the Government exercises its power of taxation. Nelson,\nAdjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 588\u2013\n589 (2007); see also B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc.,\nante, at 12 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (discussing other decisions that\nappear to rest on this exception). To the extent that Murray\u2019s Lessee\npurported to recognize such an exception, how-ever, it did so only in\ndictum after noting that the statute provided a mechanism for judicial\nreview of the accounting decision on which the distress warrant was\nbased. 18 How., at 280\u2013281.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Plank, Why\nBankruptcy Judges Need Not and Should Not Be Article\nIII Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L. J. 567, 608 (1998) (describing\nthe bankruptcy powers vested by Congress in non-Article\nIII judges). Modern bankruptcy courts, however, adjudi-\ncate a far broader array of disputes than their earliest\nhistorical counterparts. And this Court has remained\ncarefully noncommittal about the source of their authority\nto do so. See Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 71 (plurality\nopinion).\n  Applying the historical categories of cases discussed\nabove, one can understand why. Bankruptcy courts clearly\ndo not qualify as territorial courts or courts-martial, but\nthey are not an easy fit in the \u201cpublic rights\u201d category,\neither. No doubt certain aspects of bankruptcy involve\nrights lying outside the core of the judicial power. The\nmost obvious of these is the right to discharge, which a\nparty may obtain if he satisfies certain statutory criteria.\nIbid. Discharge is not itself a private right, but, together\nwith the claims allowance process that precedes it, it can\nact conclusively on the core private rights of the debtor\u2019s\ncreditors. We have nevertheless implicitly recognized that\nthe claims allowance process may proceed in a bankruptcy\ncourt, as can any matter that would necessarily be re-\nsolved by that process, even one that affects core private\nrights. Stern, 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 30\u201331).\nFor this reason, bankruptcy courts and their prede-\n14       WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncessors more likely enjoy a unique, textually based excep-\ntion, much like territorial courts and courts-martial do.\nSee id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).\nThat is, Article I\u2019s Bankruptcy Clause serves to carve\ncases and controversies traditionally subject to resolution\nby bankruptcy commissioners out of Article III, giving\nCongress the discretion, within those historical bounda-\nries, to provide for their resolution outside of Article III\ncourts.\n                              3\n   Because Stern claims by definition fall outside of the\nhistorical boundaries of the bankruptcy carve-out, they are\nsubject to Article III. This means that, if their adjudica-\ntion requires the exercise of the judicial power, then only\nArticle III courts may perform it.\n   Although Stern claims indisputably involve private\nrights, the \u201cpublic rights\u201d doctrine suggests a way in\nwhich party consent may transform the function of adjudi-\ncating Stern claims into one that does not require the\nexercise of the judicial power. The premise of the \u201cpublic\nrights\u201d doctrine, as described above, is not that public\nrights affirmatively require adjudication by some other\ngovernmental power, but that the Government has a freer\nhand when private rights are not at issue. Accordingly,\nthis premise may not require the presence of a public right\nat all, but may apply equally to any situation in which\nprivate rights are not asserted.\n   Party consent, in turn, may have the effect of lifting that\n\u201cprivate rights\u201d bar, much in the way that waiver lifts the\nbar imposed by the right to a jury trial. Individuals may\ndispose of their own private rights freely, without judicial\nintervention. A party who consents to adjudication of a\nStern claim by a bankruptcy court is merely making a\nconditional surrender of whatever private right he has on\nthe line, contingent on some future event\u2014namely, that\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            15\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe bankruptcy court rules against him. Indeed, it is on\nthis logic that the law has long encouraged and permitted\nprivate settlement of disputes, including through the\naction of an arbitrator not vested with the judicial power.\nSee ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 399\n(1868). Perhaps for this reason, decisions discussing the\nrelationship between private rights and the judicial power\nhave emphasized the \u201cinvoluntary divestiture\u201d of a private\nright. Newland v. Marsh, 19 Ill. 376, 382\u2013383 (1857)\n(emphasis added).\n   But all of this does not necessarily mean that the major-\nity has wound up in the right place by the wrong path.\nEven if consent could lift the private-rights barrier to non-\njudicial Government action, it would not necessarily follow\nthat consent removes the Stern adjudication from the core\nof the judicial power. There may be other aspects of the\nadjudication that demand the exercise of the judicial\npower, such as entry of a final judgment enforceable with-\nout any further action by an Article III court. We have\nrecognized that judgments entered by Article III courts\nbear unique qualities that spring from the exercise of the\njudicial power, Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.\n211, 218\u2013219 (1995), and it may be that the entry of a\nfinal judgment bearing these qualities\u2014irrespective of the\nsubject matter of the dispute\u2014is a quintessential judicial\nfunction. See ante, at 16\u201317 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).\nSee generally Northern Pipeline, supra, at 85\u201386, and n.\n38 (plurality opinion) (distinguishing the agency orders at\nissue in Crowell from bankruptcy court orders on this\nground). As Thomas Cooley explained in his influential\ntreatise, \u201cIf the judges should sit to hear . . . controversies\n[beyond their cognizance], they would not sit as a court; at\nthe most they would be arbitrators only, and their . . .\ndecision could not be binding as a judgment, but only as\n16         WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

In particular, if we were to determine that\ncurrent practice accords bankruptcy court judgments a\nfeature that demands the exercise of the judicial power,\nwould that mean that all bankruptcy judgments resolving\nStern claims are void, or only that courts may not give\neffect to that single feature that triggers Article III? The\nparties have briefed none of these issues, so I do not re-\nsolve them. But the number and magnitude of these\nimportant questions\u2014questions implicated by thousands\nof bankruptcy and magistrate judge decisions each year\u2014\nmerit closer attention than the majority has given them.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Numerous 19th-century State Supreme Courts held unconstitutional\n\nlaws authorizing individuals to consent to have their cases heard by an\nindividual not qualified as a judge under provisions of State Consti-\ntutions similar to Article III, \u00a71. See, e.g., Winchester v. Ayres, 4 Iowa\n104 (1853); Haverly Invincible Mining Co. v. Howcutt, 6 Colo. 574, 575\u2013\n576 (1883); Ex parte Alabama State Bar Assn., 92 Ala. 113, 8 So. 768\n(1891); see also Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, at 399. Acknowl-\nedging the similarity between the practices under review and the\nlegitimate practice of private arbitration, many of these decisions\npremised their finding of unconstitutionality on the issuance of a\njudgment or other writ that only judges may issue. See, e.g., Bishop v.\nNelson, 83 Ill. 601 (1876) (per curiam) (\u201cThis was not an arbitration . . .\nbut it was an attempt to confer upon [Mr. Wood] the power of a judge,\nto decide the pending case, and he did decide it, the court carrying out\nhis decision by entering the judgment he had reached, and not [its] own\njudgment\u201d); Van Slyke v. Trempealeau Cty. Farmers\u2019 Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,\n39 Wis. 390, 393 (1876) (\u201cWe cannot look into the bill of exceptions or\nconsider the order denying a new trial, because both are unofficial and\ndevoid of judicial authority\u201d); see also id., at 395\u2013396 (tracing this rule\nback to English understandings of judicial power). These decisions\ntreat the rule as a corollary to the rule that parties may not, by consent,\nconfer jurisdiction. See, e.g., Higby v. Ayres, 14 Kan. 331, 334 (1875);\nHoagland v. Creed, 81 Ill. 506, 507\u2013508 (1876); see also Cooley, supra,\nat 399.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

As instrumen-\ntalities of the Federal Government, the bankruptcy courts\nmust act pursuant to some constitutional grant of author-\nity. Even if the functions bankruptcy courts perform do not\nrequire an exercise of legislative, executive, or judicial\npower, we would need to identify the source of Congress\u2019\nauthority to establish them and to authorize them to act.\n   The historical carve-outs for territorial courts and\ncourts-martial might provide some guidance.

Dynes, 20 How., at 78\u201379.\n   Although our cases examining the constitutionality of\nstatutes allocating the power to the bankruptcy courts\nhave not considered the source of Congress\u2019 authority to\nestablish them, the obvious textual basis is the fourth\nclause of Article I, \u00a78, which empowers Congress to \u201cestab-\nlish . . . uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies\nthroughout the United States.\u201d7 But as with the other two\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 In Northern Pipeline, the plurality rejected the argument that \u201cCon-\n\ngress\u2019 constitutional authority to establish \u2018uniform Laws on the subject\nof Bankruptcies throughout the United States\u2019 carries with it an\n18         WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

Although Stern\nclaims, by definition, lie outside those historical bounda-\nries, a historical practice of allowing broader adjudication\nby bankruptcy commissioners acting with the consent of\nthe parties could alter the analysis. The parties once\nagain do not brief these questions, but they merit closer\nattention by this Court.\n                        *     *    *\n   Whether parties may consent to bankruptcy court adju-\ndication of Stern claims is a difficult constitutional ques-\ntion.

SHARIF\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 13\u2013935.      Argued January 14, 2015\u2014Decided May 26, 2015\nRespondent Richard Sharif tried to discharge a debt he owed petition-\n  ers, Wellness International Network, Ltd., and its owners (collective-\n  ly Wellness), in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Wellness sought, inter\n  alia, a declaratory judgment from the Bankruptcy Court, contending\n  that a trust Sharif claimed to administer was in fact Sharif\u2019s alter-\n  ego, and that its assets were his personal property and part of his\n  bankruptcy estate. The Bankruptcy Court eventually entered a de-\n  fault judgment against Sharif. While Sharif\u2019s appeal was pending in\n  District Court, but before briefing concluded, this Court held that Ar-\n  ticle III forbids bankruptcy courts to enter a final judgment on claims\n  that seek only to \u201caugment\u201d the bankruptcy estate and would other-\n  wise \u201cexis[t] without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d Stern v.\n  Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___. After briefing closed, Sharif sought\n  permission to file a supplemental brief raising a Stern objection. The\n  District Court denied the motion, finding it untimely, and affirmed\n  the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment. As relevant here, the Seventh\n  Circuit determined that Sharif\u2019s Stern objection could not be waived\n  because it implicated structural interests and reversed on the alter-\n  ego claim, holding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional\n  authority to enter final judgment on that claim.\nHeld:\n    1. Article III permits bankruptcy judges to adjudicate Stern claims\n with the parties\u2019 knowing and voluntary consent. Pp. 8\u201317.\n       (a) The foundational case supporting the adjudication of legal\n disputes by non-Article III judges with the consent of the parties is\n Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833. There,\n the Court held that the right to adjudication before an Article III\n2            WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    court is \u201cpersonal\u201d and therefore \u201csubject to waiver.\u201d Id., at 848. The\n    Court also recognized that if Article III\u2019s structural interests as \u201c \u2018an\n    inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and bal-\n    ances\u2019 \u201d are implicated, \u201cthe parties cannot by consent cure the consti-\n    tutional difficulty.\u201d Id., at 850\u2013851. The importance of consent was\n    reiterated in two later cases involving the Federal Magistrates Act\u2019s\n    assignment of non-Article III magistrate judges to supervise voir dire\n    in felony trials. In Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, the Court\n    held that a magistrate judge was not permitted to select a jury with-\n    out the defendant\u2019s consent, id., at 864. But in Peretz v. United\n    States, 501 U. S. 923, the Court stated that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s consent\n    significantly changes the constitutional analysis,\u201d id., at 932. Be-\n    cause an Article III court retained supervisory authority over the\n    process, the Court found \u201cno structural protections . . . implicated\u201d\n    and upheld the Magistrate Judge\u2019s action. Id., at 937. Pp. 8\u201312.\n         (b) The question whether allowing bankruptcy courts to decide\n    Stern claims by consent would \u201cimpermissibly threate[n] the institu-\n    tional integrity of the Judicial Branch,\u201d Schor, 478 U. S., at 851, must\n    be decided \u201cwith an eye to the practical effect that the\u201d practice \u201cwill\n    have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary,\u201d\n    ibid. For several reasons, this practice does not usurp the constitu-\n    tional prerogatives of Article III courts. Bankruptcy judges are ap-\n    pointed and may be removed by Article III judges, see 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7\u00a7152(a)(1), (e); \u201cserve as judicial officers of the United States district\n    court,\u201d \u00a7151; and collectively \u201cconstitute a unit of the district court\u201d\n    for the district in which they serve, \u00a7152(a)(1). Bankruptcy courts\n    hear matters solely on a district court\u2019s reference, \u00a7157(a), and pos-\n    sess no free-floating authority to decide claims traditionally heard by\n    Article III courts, see Schor, 478 U. S., at 854, 856. \u201c[T]he decision to\n    invoke\u201d the bankruptcy court\u2019s authority \u201cis left entirely to the par-\n    ties,\u201d id., at 855, and \u201cthe power of the federal judiciary to take juris-\n    diction\u201d remains in place, ibid. Finally, there is no indication that\n    Congress gave bankruptcy courts the ability to decide Stern claims in\n    an effort to aggrandize itself or humble the Judiciary. See, e.g.,\n    Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937. Pp. 12\u201315.\n         (c) Stern does not compel a different result. It turned on the fact\n    that the litigant \u201cdid not truly consent to\u201d resolution of the claim\n    against it in a non-Article III forum, 564 U. S., at ___, and thus, does\n    not govern the question whether litigants may validly consent to ad-\n    judication by a bankruptcy court. Moreover, expanding Stern to hold\n    that a litigant may not waive the right to an Article III court through\n    consent would be inconsistent with that opinion\u2019s own description of\n    its holding as \u201ca \u2018narrow\u2019 one\u201d that did \u201cnot change all that much\u201d\n    about the division of labor between district and bankruptcy courts.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

Consent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court need not be ex-\n  press, but must be knowing and voluntary. Neither the Constitution\n  nor the relevant statute\u2014which requires \u201cthe consent of all parties to\n  the proceeding\u201d to hear a Stern claim, \u00a7157(c)(2)\u2014mandates express\n  consent. Such a requirement would be in great tension with this\n  Court\u2019s holding that substantially similar language in \u00a7636(c)\u2014which\n  authorizes magistrate judges to conduct proceedings \u201c[u]pon consent\n  of the parties\u201d\u2014permits waiver based on \u201cactions rather than words,\u201d\n  Roell v. Withrow, 538 U. S. 580, 589. Roell\u2019s implied consent stand-\n  ard supplies the appropriate rule for bankruptcy court adjudications\n  and makes clear that a litigant\u2019s consent\u2014whether express or im-\n  plied\u2014must be knowing and voluntary.

RICHARD SHARIF\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [May 26, 2015]\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Article III, \u00a71, of the Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he\njudicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one\nsupreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Con-\ngress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d Con-\ngress has in turn established 94 District Courts and 13\nCourts of Appeals, composed of judges who enjoy the\nprotections of Article III: life tenure and pay that cannot\nbe diminished. Because these protections help to ensure\nthe integrity and independence of the Judiciary, \u201cwe have\nlong recognized that, in general, Congress may not with-\ndraw from\u201d the Article III courts \u201cany matter which, from\nits nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in\nequity, or in admiralty.\u201d Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 18) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Congress has also authorized the appointment of bank-\nruptcy and magistrate judges, who do not enjoy the protec-\ntions of Article III, to assist Article III courts in their\nwork.

In Northern Pipe-\nline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50\n(1982) (plurality opinion), and more recently in Stern, this\nCourt held that Congress violated Article III by authoriz-\ning bankruptcy judges to decide certain claims for which\nlitigants are constitutionally entitled to an Article III\nadjudication. This case presents the question whether\nArticle III allows bankruptcy judges to adjudicate such\nclaims with the parties\u2019 consent. We hold that Article III\nis not violated when the parties knowingly and voluntarily\nconsent to adjudication by a bankruptcy judge.\n                            I\n                            A\n  Before 1978, district courts typically delegated bank-\nruptcy proceedings to \u201creferees.\u201d Executive Benefits Ins.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Congress has authorized 179 circuit judgeships and 677 district\n\njudgeships, a total of 856.

S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4).\nUnder the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, bankruptcy referees\nhad \u201c[s]ummary jurisdiction\u201d over \u201cclaims involving \u2018prop-\nerty in the actual or constructive possession of the bank-\nruptcy court\u2019 \u201d\u2014that is, over the apportionment of the\nbankruptcy estate among creditors.

S. 263, 266\u2013267\n(1932).\n   In 1978, Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Reform Act,\nwhich repealed the 1898 Act and gave the newly created\nbankruptcy courts power \u201cmuch broader than that exer-\ncised under the former referee system.\u201d Northern Pipe-\nline, 458 U.

The Act \u201c[e]liminat[ed] the distinc-\ntion between \u2018summary\u2019 and \u2018plenary\u2019 jurisdiction\u201d and\nenabled bankruptcy courts to decide \u201call \u2018civil proceedings\narising under title 11 [the Bankruptcy title] or arising\nin or related to cases under title 11.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.

Counts\nI\u2013IV of the complaint objected to the discharge of Sharif \u2019s\ndebts because, among other reasons, Sharif had concealed\nproperty by claiming that it was owned by the Trust.\nCount V of the complaint sought a declaratory judgment\nthat the Trust was Sharif \u2019s alter ego and that its assets\nshould therefore be treated as part of Sharif \u2019s bankruptcy\nestate. Id., at 21. In his answer, Sharif admitted that the\nadversary proceeding was a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7157(b)\u2014i.e., a proceeding in which the Bankruptcy\nCourt could enter final judgment subject to appeal. See\n\u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1), (2)(J); App. 24. Indeed, Sharif requested\njudgment in his favor on all counts of Wellness\u2019 complaint\n6        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand urged the Bankruptcy Court to \u201cfind that the Soad\nWattar Living Trust is not property of the [bankruptcy]\nestate.\u201d Id., at 44.\n   A familiar pattern of discovery evasion ensued. Well-\nness responded by filing a motion for sanctions, or, in the\nalternative, to compel discovery. Granting the motion to\ncompel, the Bankruptcy Court warned Sharif that if he did\nnot respond to Wellness\u2019 discovery requests a default\njudgment would be entered against him. Sharif eventu-\nally complied with some discovery obligations, but did not\nproduce any documents related to the Trust.\n   In July 2010, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling\nfinding that Sharif had violated the court\u2019s discovery\norder. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a\u2013120a. It accordingly\ndenied Sharif \u2019s request to discharge his debts and entered\na default judgment against him in the adversary proceed-\ning. And it declared, as requested by count V of Wellness\u2019\ncomplaint, that the assets supposedly held by the Trust\nwere in fact property of Sharif \u2019s bankruptcy estate be-\ncause Sharif \u201ctreats [the Trust\u2019s] assets as his own prop-\nerty.\u201d Id., at 119a.\n   Sharif appealed to the District Court. Six weeks before\nSharif filed his opening brief in the District Court, this\nCourt decided Stern. In Stern, the Court held that Article\nIII prevents bankruptcy courts from entering final judg-\nment on claims that seek only to \u201caugment\u201d the bankruptcy\nestate and would otherwise \u201cexis[t] without regard to\nany bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d 564 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 27, 34). Sharif did not cite Stern in his opening\nbrief. Rather, after the close of briefing, Sharif moved for\nleave to file a supplemental brief, arguing that in light of\nIn re Ortiz, 665 F. 3d 906 (CA7 2011)\u2014a recently issued\ndecision interpreting Stern\u2014\u201cthe bankruptcy court\u2019s order\nshould only be treated as a report and recommendation.\u201d\nApp. 145.

The\nSeventh Circuit acknowledged that ordinarily Sharif \u2019s\nStern objection would \u201cnot [be] preserved because he\nwaited too long to assert it.\u201d 727 F. 3d, at 767.5 But the\ncourt determined that the ordinary rule did not apply\nbecause Sharif \u2019s argument concerned \u201cthe allocation of\nauthority between bankruptcy courts and district courts\u201d\nunder Article III, and thus \u201cimplicate[d] structural inter-\nests.\u201d Id., at 771. Based on those separation-of-powers\nconsiderations, the court held that \u201ca litigant may not\nwaive\u201d a Stern objection. Id., at 773. Turning to the\nmerits of Sharif \u2019s contentions, the Seventh Circuit agreed\nwith the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of counts I\u2013IV of\nWellness\u2019 adversary complaint. It further concluded,\nhowever, that count V of the complaint alleged a so-called\n\u201cStern claim,\u201d that is, \u201ca claim designated for final adjudi-\ncation in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter, but\nprohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional\nmatter.\u201d Executive Benefits, 573 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n4). The Seventh Circuit therefore ruled that the Bank-\nruptcy Court lacked constitutional authority to enter final\njudgment on count V.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Although the Seventh Circuit referred to Sharif\u2019s failure to raise his\n\nStern argument in a timely manner as a waiver, that court has since\nclarified that its decision rested on forfeiture. See Peterson v. Somers\nDublin Ltd., 729 F. 3d 741, 747 (2013) (\u201cThe issue in Wellness Interna-\ntional Network was forfeiture rather than waiver\u201d).\n   6 The Seventh Circuit concluded its opinion by considering the rem-\n\nedy for the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s purportedly unconstitutional issuance\nof a final judgment. The court determined that if count V of Wellness\u2019\ncomplaint raised a core claim, the only statutorily authorized remedy\nwould be for the District Court to withdraw the reference to the Bank-\nruptcy Court and set a new discovery schedule. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s\nreasoning on this point was rejected by our decision last Term in\nExecutive Benefits, which held that district courts may treat Stern\n8         WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

The CFTC ruled against\nSchor on the counterclaims. This Court upheld that ruling\nagainst both statutory and constitutional challenges.\n  On the constitutional question (the one relevant here)\nthe Court began by holding that Schor had \u201cwaived any\nright he may have possessed to the full trial of [the bro-\nker\u2019s] counterclaim before an Article III court.\u201d Id., at 849.\nThe Court then explained why this waiver legitimated the\nCFTC\u2019s exercise of authority: \u201c[A]s a personal right, Arti-\ncle III\u2019s guarantee of an impartial and independent federal\nadjudication is subject to waiver, just as are other per-\nsonal constitutional rights\u201d\u2014such as the right to a jury\u2014\n\u201cthat dictate the procedures by which civil and criminal\nmatters must be tried.\u201d Id., at 848\u2013849.\n  The Court went on to state that a litigant\u2019s waiver of his\n\u201cpersonal right\u201d to an Article III court is not always dis-\npositive because Article III \u201cnot only preserves to litigants\ntheir interest in an impartial and independent federal\nadjudication of claims . . . , but also serves as \u2018an insepa-\nrable element of the constitutional system of checks and\nbalances.\u2019 . . .

In such\n     circumstances, separation of powers concerns are di-\n     minished, for it seems self-evident that just as Con-\n     gress may encourage parties to settle a dispute out of\n     court or resort to arbitration without impermissible\n     incursions on the separation of powers, Congress may\n     make available a quasi-judicial mechanism through\n     which willing parties may, at their option, elect to re-\n     solve their differences.\u201d Id., at 855.\nThe option for parties to submit their disputes to a non-\nArticle III adjudicator was at most a \u201cde minimis\u201d in-\nfringement on the prerogative of the federal courts. Id., at\n856.\n   A few years after Schor, the Court decided a pair of\ncases\u2014Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858 (1989), and\nPeretz v. United States, 501 U. S. 923 (1991)\u2014that reiter-\nated the importance of consent to the constitutional analy-\nsis. Both cases concerned whether the Federal Magis-\ntrates Act authorized magistrate judges to preside over\njury selection in a felony trial;8 the difference was that\nPeretz consented to the practice while Gomez did not.\nThat difference was dispositive.\n   In Gomez, the Court interpreted the statute as not\nallowing magistrate judges to supervise voir dire without\nconsent, emphasizing the constitutional concerns that\nmight otherwise arise. See 490 U. S., at 864. In Peretz,\nthe Court upheld the Magistrate Judge\u2019s action, stating\nthat \u201cthe defendant\u2019s consent significantly changes the\nconstitutional analysis.\u201d 501 U. S., at 932.

S., at 848), and that \u201c[t]he\nmost basic rights of criminal defendants are similarly\nsubject to waiver,\u201d 501 U. S., at 936. And \u201c[e]ven assum-\ning that a litigant may not waive structural protections\nprovided by Article III,\u201d the Court found \u201cno such struc-\ntural protections . . . implicated by\u201d a magistrate judge\u2019s\nsupervision of voir dire:\n     \u201cMagistrates are appointed and subject to removal by\n     Article III judges. The \u2018ultimate decision\u2019 whether to\n     invoke the magistrate\u2019s assistance is made by the dis-\n     trict court, subject to veto by the parties. The decision\n     whether to empanel the jury whose selection a magis-\n     trate has supervised also remains entirely with the\n     district court. Because \u2018the entire process takes place\n     under the district court\u2019s total control and jurisdic-\n     tion,\u2019 there is no danger that use of the magistrate in-\n     volves a \u2018congressional attemp[t] \u201cto transfer jurisdic-\n     tion [to non-Article III tribunals] for the purpose of\n     emasculating\u201d constitutional courts.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 937 (ci-\n     tations omitted; alteration in original).9\n  The lesson of Schor, Peretz, and the history that preced-\ned them is plain: The entitlement to an Article III adjudi-\ncator is \u201ca personal right\u201d and thus ordinarily \u201csubject to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Discounting the relevance of Gomez and Peretz, the principal dissent\n\nemphasizes that neither case concerned the entry of final judgment by\na non-Article III actor. See post, at 16 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Here\nagain, the principal dissent\u2019s insistence on formalism leads it astray.\nAs we explained in Peretz, the \u201cresponsibility and importance [of]\npresiding over voir dire at a felony trial\u201d is equivalent to the \u201csupervi-\nsion of entire civil and misdemeanor trials,\u201d 501 U.

Article III also serves a\nstructural purpose, \u201cbarring congressional attempts \u2018to\ntransfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III tribunals] for the\npurpose of emasculating\u2019 constitutional courts and thereby\nprevent[ing] \u2018the encroachment or aggrandizement of one\nbranch at the expense of the other.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 850 (citations\nomitted). But allowing Article I adjudicators to decide\nclaims submitted to them by consent does not offend the\nseparation of powers so long as Article III courts retain\nsupervisory authority over the process.\n                              B\n   The question here, then, is whether allowing bankruptcy\ncourts to decide Stern claims by consent would \u201cimper-\nmissibly threate[n] the institutional integrity of the Judi-\ncial Branch.\u201d Schor, 478 U. S., at 851. And that question\nmust be decided not by \u201cformalistic and unbending rules,\u201d\nbut \u201cwith an eye to the practical effect that the\u201d practice\n\u201cwill have on the constitutionally assigned role of the\nfederal judiciary.\u201d Ibid.; see Thomas v.

Bankruptcy judges, like\nmagistrate judges, \u201care appointed and subject to removal\nby Article III judges,\u201d Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937; see 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7152(a)(1), (e). They \u201cserve as judicial officers of\nthe United States district court,\u201d \u00a7151, and collectively\n\u201cconstitute a unit of the district court\u201d for that district,\n\u00a7152(a)(1). Just as \u201c[t]he \u2018ultimate decision\u2019 whether to\ninvoke [a] magistrate [judge]\u2019s assistance is made by the\ndistrict court,\u201d Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937, bankruptcy courts\nhear matters solely on a district court\u2019s reference, \u00a7157(a),\nwhich the district court may withdraw sua sponte or at the\nrequest of a party, \u00a7157(d). \u201c[S]eparation of powers con-\ncerns are diminished\u201d when, as here, \u201cthe decision to\ninvoke [a non-Article III] forum is left entirely to the\nparties and the power of the federal judiciary to take\njurisdiction\u201d remains in place. Schor, 478 U. S., at 855.\n   Furthermore, like the CFTC in Schor, bankruptcy\ncourts possess no free-floating authority to decide claims\ntraditionally heard by Article III courts. Their ability to\nresolve such matters is limited to \u201ca narrow class of com-\nmon law claims as an incident to the [bankruptcy courts\u2019]\nprimary, and unchallenged, adjudicative function.\u201d Id., at\n854. \u201cIn such circumstances, the magnitude of any intru-\nsion on the Judicial Branch can only be termed de mini-\nmis.\u201d Id., at 856.\n   Finally, there is no indication that Congress gave bank-\nruptcy courts the ability to decide Stern claims in an effort\nto aggrandize itself or humble the Judiciary. As in Peretz,\n\u201c[b]ecause \u2018the entire process takes place under the district\ncourt\u2019s total control and jurisdiction,\u2019 there is no danger\nthat use of the [bankruptcy court] involves a \u2018congres-\nsional attemp[t] \u201cto transfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III\ntribunals] for the purpose of emasculating\u201d constitutional\ncourts.\u2019 \u201d 501 U.

Post, at 16. That argument misapprehends\nboth Schor and the nature of our analysis. What Schor forbids is using\nconsent to excuse an actual violation of Article III. See 478 U.

But Schor\nconfirms that consent remains highly relevant when determining, as we\ndo here, whether a particular adjudication in fact raises constitutional\nconcerns. See id., at 855 (\u201cseparation of powers concerns are dimin-\nished\u201d when \u201cthe decision to invoke [a non-Article III] forum is left\nentirely to the parties\u201d). Thus, we do not rely on Sharif\u2019s consent to\n\u201ccur[e]\u201d a violation of Article III. His consent shows, in part, why no\nsuch violation has occurred. Cf.

See 458 U. S., at\n80, n. 31 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (opinion of\nRehnquist, J.). The Court confirmed in two later cases\nthat Northern Pipeline turned on the lack of consent. See\nSchor, 478 U. S., at 849 (\u201c[I]n Northern Pipeline, . . . the\nabsence of consent to an initial adjudication before a non-\nArticle III tribunal was relied on as a significant factor in\ndetermining that Article III forbade such adjudication\u201d);\nThomas, 473 U. S., at 584.\n   Stern presented the same scenario. The majority cited\nthe dissent\u2019s observation that Northern Pipeline \u201cestab-\nlish[ed] only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article\nIII court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment,\nand issue binding orders in a traditional contract action\narising under state law, without consent of the litigants,\nand subject only to ordinary appellate review,\u201d 564 U.

Because Stern was premised on non-\nconsent to adjudication by the Bankruptcy Court, the\n\u201cconstitutional bar\u201d it announced, see post, at 14\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), simply does not govern the\nquestion whether litigants may validly consent to adjudi-\ncation by a bankruptcy court.\n   An expansive reading of Stern, moreover, would be\ninconsistent with the opinion\u2019s own description of its\nholding. The Court in Stern took pains to note that the\nquestion before it was \u201ca \u2018narrow\u2019 one,\u201d and that its answer\ndid \u201cnot change all that much\u201d about the division of labor\nbetween district courts and bankruptcy courts. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 37); see also id., at ___ (slip op., at 38) (stating\nthat Congress had exceeded the limitations of Article III\n\u201cin one isolated respect\u201d). That could not have been a fair\ncharacterization of the decision if it meant that bank-\nruptcy judges could no longer exercise their longstanding\nauthority to resolve claims submitted to them by consent.\nInterpreting Stern to bar consensual adjudications by\nbankruptcy courts would \u201cmeaningfully chang[e] the\ndivision of labor\u201d in our judicial system, contra, id., at ___\n(slip op., at 37).11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Inadvancing its restrictive view of Stern, the principal dissent\nignores the sweeping jurisprudential implications of its position. If, as\nthe principal dissent suggests, consent is irrelevant to the Article III\nanalysis, it is difficult to see how Schor and Peretz were not wrongly\ndecided. But those decisions obviously remain good law. It is the\nprincipal dissent\u2019s position that breaks with our precedents. See Plaut\nv. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.

The Court has\nnever done what Sharif and the principal dissent would\nhave us do\u2014hold that a litigant who has the right to an\nArticle III court may not waive that right through his\nconsent.\n                               D\n   The principal dissent warns darkly of the consequences\nof today\u2019s decision. See post, at 17\u201320. To hear the princi-\npal dissent tell it, the world will end not in fire, or ice, but\nin a bankruptcy court. The response to these ominous\npredictions is the same now as it was when Justice Bren-\nnan, dissenting in Schor, first made them nearly 30 years\nago:\n      \u201cThis is not to say, of course, that if Congress created\n    a phalanx of non-Article III tribunals equipped to\n    handle the entire business of the Article III courts\n    without any Article III supervision or control and\n    without evidence of valid and specific legislative ne-\n    cessities, the fact that the parties had the election to\n    proceed in their forum of choice would necessarily\n    save the scheme from constitutional attack. But this\n    case obviously bears no resemblance to such a sce-\n    nario . . . .\u201d 478 U. S., at 855 (citations omitted).\n   Adjudication based on litigant consent has been a con-\nsistent feature of the federal court system since its incep-\ntion.

SHARIF\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n  Sharif contends that to the extent litigants may validly\nconsent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court, such con-\nsent must be express. We disagree.\n  Nothing in the Constitution requires that consent to\nadjudication by a bankruptcy court be express. Nor does\nthe relevant statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157, mandate express\nconsent; it states only that a bankruptcy court must obtain\n\u201cthe consent\u201d\u2014consent simpliciter\u2014\u201cof all parties to the\nproceeding\u201d before hearing and determining a non-core\nclaim. \u00a7157(c)(2). And a requirement of express consent\nwould be in great tension with our decision in Roell v.\nWithrow, 538 U. S. 580 (2003). That case concerned the\ninterpretation of \u00a7636(c), which authorizes magistrate\njudges to \u201cconduct any or all proceedings in a jury or non-\njury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the\ncase,\u201d with \u201cthe consent of the parties.\u201d12 The specific\nquestion in Roell was whether, as a statutory matter, the\n\u201cconsent\u201d required by \u00a7636(c) had to be express. The\ndissent argued that \u201c[r]eading \u00a7636(c)(1) to require ex-\npress consent not only is more consistent with the text of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Consistent with our precedents, the Courts of Appeals have unani-\n\nmously upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7636(c).

S., at 595\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.). But the majority\u2014thus placed on\nnotice of the constitutional concern\u2014was untroubled by it,\nopining that \u201cthe Article III right is substantially honored\u201d\nby permitting waiver based on \u201cactions rather than\nwords.\u201d Id., at 589, 590.\n   The implied consent standard articulated in Roell sup-\nplies the appropriate rule for adjudications by bankruptcy\ncourts under \u00a7157. Applied in the bankruptcy context,\nthat standard possesses the same pragmatic virtues\u2014\nincreasing judicial efficiency and checking gamesman-\nship\u2014that motivated our adoption of it for consent-based\nadjudications by magistrate judges. See id., at 590. It\nbears emphasizing, however, that a litigant\u2019s consent\u2014\nwhether express or implied\u2014must still be knowing and\nvoluntary. Roell makes clear that the key inquiry is\nwhether \u201cthe litigant or counsel was made aware of the\nneed for consent and the right to refuse it, and still volun-\ntarily appeared to try the case\u201d before the non-Article III\nadjudicator. Ibid.; see also id., at 588, n. 5 (\u201cnotification of\nthe right to refuse\u201d adjudication by a non-Article III court\n\u201cis a prerequisite to any inference of consent\u201d).13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Even though the Constitution does not require that consent be\n\nexpress, it is good practice for courts to seek express statements of\nconsent or nonconsent, both to ensure irrefutably that any waiver of the\nright to Article III adjudication is knowing and voluntary and to limit\nsubsequent litigation over the consent issue. Statutes or judicial rules\nmay require express consent where the Constitution does not. Indeed,\nthe Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure already require that\npleadings in adversary proceedings before a bankruptcy court \u201ccontain\na statement that the proceeding is core or non-core and, if non-core,\nthat the pleader does or does not consent to entry of final orders or\njudgment by the bankruptcy judge.\u201d Fed.

The Court faithfully applies Commodity\nFutures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U.

When this\nRule was promulgated, no one was thinking about a Stern\nclaim. But now, assuming that Rule 7012(b) represents a\npermissible interpretation of \u00a7157, the question arises\nwhether a Stern claim should be treated as a non-core or\ncore claim for purposes of the bankruptcy rules.

See 2\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries *471\u2013488. This historical\npractice, combined with Congress\u2019s constitutional author-\nity to enact bankruptcy laws, confirms that Congress may\nassign to non-Article III courts adjudications involving\n\u201cthe restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at\nthe core of the federal bankruptcy power.\u201d Northern Pipe-\nline, 458 U. S., at 71 (plurality opinion).\n   Although Congress may assign some bankruptcy pro\u00ad\nceedings to non-Article III courts, there are limits on that\npower. In Northern Pipeline, the Court invalidated statu\u00ad\ntory provisions that permitted a bankruptcy court to enter\nfinal judgment on a creditor\u2019s state law claim for breach of\ncontract. Because that claim arose not from the bankruptcy\nbut from independent common law sources, a majority\nof the Court determined that Article III required an adju\u00ad\ndicator with life tenure and salary protection. See id., at\n84; id., at 90\u201391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Congress responded to Northern Pipeline by allowing\nbankruptcy courts to render final judgments only in \u201ccore\u201d\nbankruptcy proceedings. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b). Those\njudgments may be appealed to district courts and re\u00ad\nviewed under deferential standards. \u00a7158(a). In non-core\nproceedings, bankruptcy judges may submit proposed\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, which the district\ncourt must review de novo before entering final judgment.\n\u00a7157(c)(1).\n   In Stern, we faced the question whether a bankruptcy\ncourt could enter final judgment on an action defined by\nCongress as a \u201ccore\u201d proceeding\u2014an estate\u2019s counterclaim\nagainst a creditor based on state tort law. \u00a7157(b)(2)(C).\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nWe said no. Because the tort claim neither \u201cstem[med]\nfrom the bankruptcy itself \u201d nor would \u201cnecessarily be\nresolved in the claims allowance process,\u201d it fell outside\nthe recognized exceptions to Article III. 564 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 34). Like the contract claim in Northern Pipe-\nline, the tort claim in Stern involved \u201cthe stuff of the tradi\u00ad\ntional actions at common law tried by the courts at West\u00ad\nminster in 1789.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting\nNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 90 (Rehnquist, J., concur\u00ad\nring in judgment)). Congress had no power under the\nConstitution to assign the resolution of such a claim to a\njudge who lacked the structural protections of Article III.\n                              B\n  The question here is whether the claim Wellness sub\u00ad\nmitted to the Bankruptcy Court is a \u201cStern claim\u201d that\nrequires final adjudication by an Article III court. See\nExecutive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 573 U. S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2014) (slip op., at 8\u20139) (assuming without decid\u00ad\ning that a fraudulent conveyance action is a \u201cStern claim\u201d).\nAs the Court recounts, Wellness alleged that Sharif had\nconcealed about $5 million of assets by claiming that they\nwere owned by a trust. Wellness sought a declaratory\njudgment that the trust was in fact Sharif \u2019s alter ego and\nthat its assets should accordingly be part of his bankruptcy\nestate. The Bankruptcy Court granted final judgment\n(based on Sharif \u2019s default) to Wellness, declaring that the\ntrust assets were part of Sharif \u2019s estate because he had\ntreated them as his own property. Ante, at 5\u20136.\n  In my view, Article III likely poses no barrier to the\nBankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of Wellness\u2019s claim. At its\nmost basic level, bankruptcy is \u201can adjudication of inter\u00ad\nests claimed in a res.\u201d Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323,\n329 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted). Wellness\nasked the Bankruptcy Court to declare that assets held by\nSharif are part of that res. Defining what constitutes the\n6        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nestate is the necessary starting point of every bankruptcy;\na court cannot divide up the estate without first knowing\nwhat\u2019s in it. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a7541(a). As the Solicitor\nGeneral explains, \u201cIdentifying the property of the estate is\ntherefore inescapably central to the restructuring of the\ndebtor-creditor relationship.\u201d Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 14.\n   Identifying property that constitutes the estate has long\nbeen a central feature of bankruptcy adjudication. Eng\u00ad\nlish bankruptcy commissioners had authority not only to\ncollect property in the debtor\u2019s possession, but also to\n\u201ccause any house or tenement of the bankrupt to be bro\u00ad\nken open,\u201d in order to uncover and seize property the\ndebtor had concealed. 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\n*485. America\u2019s first bankruptcy statute, enacted by\nCongress in 1800, similarly gave commissioners \u201cpower to\ntake into their possession, all the estate, real and personal,\nof every nature and description to which the [debtor] may\nbe entitled, either in law or equity, in any manner whatso\u00ad\never.\u201d \u00a75, 2 Stat. 23. That is peculiarly a bankruptcy\npower.\n   The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 provides further support for\nWellness\u2019s position. Under that Act, bankruptcy referees\nhad authority to exercise \u201csummary\u201d jurisdiction over\ncertain claims, while other claims could only be adjudi-\ncated in \u201cplenary\u201d proceedings before an Article III district\ncourt. See Arkison, 573 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 4\u20135).\nThis Court interpreted the 1898 Act to permit bankruptcy\nreferees to exercise summary jurisdiction to determine\nwhether property in the actual or constructive possession\nof a debtor should come within the estate, at least when no\nthird party asserted more than a \u201cmerely colorable\u201d claim\nto the property. Mueller v. Nugent, 184 U. S. 1, 15 (1902).\nIn the legal parlance of the times, a \u201cmerely colorable\u201d\nclaim was one that existed \u201cin appearance only, and not in\nreality.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 223 (1891). So a bank\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction over\nproperty in the debtor\u2019s possession as long as no third\nparty asserted a \u201csubstantial adverse\u201d claim. Taubel-\nScott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, 264 U. S. 426, 431\u2013433 (1924).\n   Here, Sharif does not contest that he held legal title to\nthe assets in the trust. Assuming that no third party\nasserted a substantial adverse claim to those assets\u2014an\ninquiry for the Bankruptcy Court on remand\u2014Wellness\u2019s\nalter ego claim fits comfortably into the category of cases\nthat bankruptcy referees could have decided by them\u00ad\nselves under the 1898 Act.\n   In Mueller, for example, this Court held that a bank\u00ad\nruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction over\nproperty in the possession of a third party acting as the\ndebtor\u2019s agent. 184 U. S., at 14\u201317; see Black\u2019s Law Dic\u00ad\ntionary 302 (10th ed. 2014) (example of a merely \u201ccolor\u00ad\nable\u201d claim is \u201cone made by a person holding property as an\nagent or bailee of the bankrupt\u201d). Similarly, this Court\nheld that a bankruptcy referee could exercise summary\njurisdiction over a creditor\u2019s claim that the debtor had\nconcealed assets under the veil of a corporate entity that\nwas \u201cnothing but a sham and a cloak.\u201d Sampsell v. Impe-\nrial Paper & Color Corp., 313 U. S. 215, 216\u2013217 (1941)\n(internal quotation marks omitted), rev\u2019g 114 F. 2d 49, 52\n(CA9 1940) (describing creditor\u2019s claim that corporation\nwas debtor\u2019s \u201calter ego\u201d). As the Court explained in\nSampsell, the \u201clegal existence of the affiliated corporation\u201d\ndid not automatically require a plenary proceeding, be\u00ad\ncause \u201c[m]ere legal paraphernalia will not suffice to trans\u00ad\nform into a substantial adverse claimant a corporation\nwhose affairs are so closely assimilated to the affairs of the\ndominant stockholder that in substance it is little more\nthan his corporate pocket.\u201d 313 U. S., at 218. Just as the\nbankruptcy referee in that case had authority to decide\nwhether assets allegedly concealed behind the corporate\nveil belonged to the bankruptcy estate, the Bankruptcy\n8        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nCourt here had authority to decide whether the assets\nallegedly concealed in the trust belonged to Sharif \u2019s\nestate.\n   Sharif contends that Wellness\u2019s alter ego claim is more\nlike an allegation of a fraudulent conveyance, which this\nCourt has implied must be adjudicated by an Article III\ncourt. See Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33,\n56 (1989); Arkison, 573 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u20139).\nAlthough both actions aim to remedy a debtor\u2019s deception,\nthey differ in a critical respect. A fraudulent conveyance\nclaim seeks assets in the hands of a third party, while an\nalter ego claim targets only the debtor\u2019s \u201csecond self.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 76 (2d ed. 1954).\nThat distinction is significant given bankruptcy\u2019s historic\ndomain over property within the actual or constructive\n\u201cpossession [of] the bankrupt at the time of the filing of\nthe petition.\u201d Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 309\nU. S. 478, 481 (1940). Through a fraudulent conveyance, a\ndishonest debtor relinquishes possession of assets before\nfiling for bankruptcy. Reclaiming those assets for the\nestate requires depriving third parties of property within\ntheir otherwise lawful possession and control, an action\nthat \u201cquintessentially\u201d required a suit at common law.\nGranfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 56. By contrast, a debtor\u2019s\npossession of property provided \u201can adequate basis\u201d for a\nbankruptcy referee to adjudicate a dispute over title in a\nsummary proceeding. Thompson, 309 U. S., at 482; see\nMueller, 184 U. S., at 15\u201316 (distinguishing claim to prop\u00ad\nerty in possession of debtor\u2019s agent from fraudulent con\u00ad\nveyance claim in determining that bankruptcy referee\ncould exercise summary jurisdiction).\n   In sum, unlike the fraudulent conveyance claim in\nGranfinanciera, Wellness\u2019s alter ego claim alleges that\nassets within Sharif \u2019s actual or constructive possession\nbelong to his estate. And unlike the breach of contract\nand tort claims at issue in Northern Pipeline and Stern,\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nWellness\u2019s claim stems not from any independent source of\nlaw but \u201cfrom the bankruptcy itself.\u201d Stern, 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 34). Provided that no third party asserted\na substantial adverse claim to the trust assets, Wellness\u2019s\nclaim therefore falls within the narrow historical excep\u00ad\ntion that permits a non-Article III adjudicator in certain\nbankruptcy proceedings. I would reverse the contrary\nholding by the Court of Appeals and end our inquiry there,\nrather than deciding a broader question that may not be\nnecessary to the disposition of this case.\n                              II\n   The Court \u201cexpresses no view\u201d on whether Wellness\u2019s\nclaim was a Stern claim. Ante, at 8, n. 7. Instead, the\nCourt concludes that the Bankruptcy Court had constitu\u00ad\ntional authority to enter final judgment on Wellness\u2019s\nclaim either way. The majority rests its decision on Sha\u00ad\nrif \u2019s purported consent to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s adjudi\u00ad\ncation. But Sharif has no authority to compromise the\nstructural separation of powers or agree to an exercise of\njudicial power outside Article III. His consent therefore\ncannot cure a constitutional violation.\n                              A\n   \u201c[I]f there is a principle in our Constitution . . . more\nsacred than another,\u201d James Madison said on the floor of\nthe First Congress, \u201cit is that which separates the Legisla\u00ad\ntive, Executive, and Judicial powers.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong.\n581 (1789). A strong word, \u201csacred.\u201d Madison was the\nprincipal drafter of the Constitution, and he knew what he\nwas talking about. By diffusing federal powers among\nthree different branches, and by protecting each branch\nagainst incursions from the others, the Framers devised a\nstructure of government that promotes both liberty and\naccountability.

To the contrary, the branches\u2019 \u201centhusi\u00ad\nasm\u201d for the offending arrangements \u201c \u2018sharpened rather\nthan blunted\u2019 our review.\u201d Noel Canning, 573 U.

In short, because the\nstructural provisions of the Constitution protect liberty\nand not just government entities, \u201cthe separation of pow\u00ad\ners does not depend on . . . whether \u2018the encroached-upon\nbranch approves the encroachment.\u2019 \u201d PCAOB, 561 U. S.,\nat 497 (quoting New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,\n182 (1992)).\n                               B\n   If a branch of the Federal Government may not consent\nto a violation of the separation of powers, surely a private\nlitigant may not do so. Just as a branch of Government\nmay not consent away the individual liberty interest\nprotected by the separation of powers, so too an individual\nmay not consent away the institutional interest protected\nby the separation of powers. To be sure, a private litigant\nmay consensually relinquish individual constitutional\nrights. A federal criminal defendant, for example, may\nknowingly and voluntarily waive his Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial by pleading guilty to a charged offense.\nSee Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). But\nthat same defendant may not agree to stand trial on fed\u00ad\neral charges before a state court, a foreign court, or a moot\ncourt, because those courts have no constitutional author\u00ad\n12       WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

A \u201clack of federal jurisdiction cannot be\nwaived or be overcome by an agreement of the parties.\u201d\nMitchell v. Maurer, 293 U. S. 237, 244 (1934).\n   As the majority recognizes, the Court\u2019s most extensive\ndiscussion of litigant consent in a separation of powers\ncase occurred in Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v.\nSchor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986). There the Court held that\nArticle III confers both a \u201cpersonal right\u201d that can be\nwaived through consent and a structural component that\n\u201csafeguards the role of the Judicial Branch in our tripar\u00ad\ntite system.\u201d Id., at 848, 850. \u201cTo the extent that this\nstructural principle is implicated in a given case, the\nparties cannot by consent cure the constitutional difficulty\nfor the same reason that the parties by consent cannot\nconfer on federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction beyond\nthe limitations imposed by Article III.\u201d Id., at 850\u2013851.\nThus, when \u201cArticle III limitations are at issue, notions of\nconsent and waiver cannot be dispositive because the\nlimitations serve institutional interests that the parties\ncannot be expected to protect.\u201d Id., at 851.\n   Schor\u2019s holding that a private litigant can consent to an\nArticle III violation that affects only his \u201cpersonal right\u201d\nhas been vigorously contested. See id., at 867 (Brennan,\nJ., dissenting) (\u201cBecause the individual and structural\ninterests served by Article III are coextensive, I do not\nbelieve that a litigant may ever waive his right to an\nArticle III tribunal where one is constitutionally re\u00ad\nquired\u201d); Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 70 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). But\nwhatever the merits of that position, nobody disputes that\nSchor forbids a litigant from consenting to a constitutional\nviolation when the structural component of Article III \u201cis\nimplicated.\u201d 478 U. S., at 850\u2013851. Thus, the key inquiry\nin this case\u2014as the majority puts it\u2014is \u201cwhether allowing\nbankruptcy courts to decide Stern claims by consent would\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

S.,\nat 851; alteration omitted).\n   One need not search far to find the answer. In Stern,\nthis Court applied the analysis from Schor to bankruptcy\ncourts and concluded that they lack Article III authority to\nenter final judgments on matters now known as Stern\nclaims. The Court noted that bankruptcy courts, unlike\nthe administrative agency in Schor, were endowed by\nCongress with \u201csubstantive jurisdiction reaching any area\nof the corpus juris,\u201d power to render final judgments en\u00ad\nforceable without any action by Article III courts, and\nauthority to adjudicate counterclaims entirely independ\u00ad\nent of the bankruptcy itself. 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op.,\nat 25\u201329). The Court concluded that allowing Congress to\nbestow such authority on non-Article III courts would\n\u201ccompromise the integrity of the system of separated\npowers and the role of the Judiciary in that system.\u201d Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 38). If there was any room for doubt\nabout the basis for its holding, the Court dispelled it by\nasking a question: \u201cIs there really a threat to the separa\u00ad\ntion of powers where Congress has conferred the judicial\npower outside Article III only over certain counterclaims\nin bankruptcy?\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 37). \u201cThe short but\nemphatic answer is yes.\u201d Ibid.\n   In other words, allowing bankruptcy courts to decide\nStern claims by consent would \u201cimpermissibly threaten\nthe institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.\u201d Ante, at\n12 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). It is\nlittle wonder that the Court of Appeals felt itself bound by\nStern and Schor to hold that Sharif \u2019s consent could not\ncure the Stern violation. 727 F. 3d 751, 771 (CA7 2013).\nOther Courts of Appeals have adopted the same reading.\nSee In re BP RE, L. P., 735 F. 3d 279, 287 (CA5 2013);\nWaldman v. Stone, 698 F. 3d 910, 917\u2013918 (CA6 2012).\n   The majority attempts to avoid this conclusion through\n14       WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nan imaginative reconstruction of Stern. As the majority\nsees it, Stern \u201cturned on the fact that the litigant \u2018did not\ntruly consent to\u2019 resolution of the claim\u201d against him in\nthe Bankruptcy Court. Ante, at 15 (quoting 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 27)). That is not a proper reading of the\ndecision. The constitutional analysis in Stern, spanning\n22 pages, contained exactly one affirmative reference to\nthe lack of consent. See ibid. That reference came amid a\nlong list of factors distinguishing the proceeding in Stern\nfrom the proceedings in Schor and other \u201cpublic rights\u201d\ncases. 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 27\u201329). Stern\u2019s\nsubsequent sentences made clear that the notions of con\u00ad\nsent relied upon by the Court in Schor did not apply in\nbankruptcy because \u201ccreditors lack an alternative forum to\nthe bankruptcy court in which to pursue their claims.\u201d\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 28) (quoting Granfinanciera,\n492 U. S., at 59, n. 14). Put simply, the litigant in Stern\ndid not consent because he could not consent given the\nnature of bankruptcy.\n  There was an opinion in Stern that turned heavily on\nconsent: the dissent. 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (opinion of\nBREYER, J.) (slip op., at 12\u201314). The Stern majority re\u00ad\nsponded to the dissent with a counterfactual: Even if\nconsent were relevant to the analysis, that factor would\nnot change the result because the litigant did not truly\nconsent. Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 28\u201329). Moreover,\nStern held that \u201cit does not matter who\u201d authorizes a\nbankruptcy judge to render final judgments on Stern\nclaims, because the \u201cconstitutional bar remains.\u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 36). That holding is incompatible with the\nmajority\u2019s conclusion today that two litigants can author\u00ad\nize a bankruptcy judge to render final judgments on Stern\nclaims, despite the constitutional bar that remains.\n  The majority also relies heavily on the supervision and\ncontrol that Article III courts exercise over bankruptcy\ncourts.

The problem is that\nCongress has also given bankruptcy courts authority to\nenter final judgments subject only to deferential appellate\nreview, and Article III precludes those judgments when\nthey involve Stern claims. The fact that Article III judges\nplayed a role in the Article III violation does not remedy\nthe constitutional harm. We have already explained why.\n   It is a fundamental principle that no branch of govern\u00ad\nment can delegate its constitutional functions to an actor\nwho lacks authority to exercise those functions. See\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n472 (2001); Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 311\n(1936). Such delegations threaten liberty and thwart\naccountability by empowering entities that lack the struc\u00ad\ntural protections the Framers carefully devised. See\nDepartment of Transportation v. Association of American\nRailroads, 575 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2015) (ALITO, J., con\u00ad\ncurring) (slip op., at 6\u20137); id., at ___\u2013___ (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2\u20133); Mistretta v.\nUnited States, 488 U. S. 361, 417\u2013422 (1989) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). Article III judges have no constitutional\nauthority to delegate the judicial power\u2014the power to\n\u201crender dispositive judgments\u201d\u2014to non-Article III judges,\nno matter how closely they control or supervise their\nwork. Plaut, 514 U. S., at 219 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   In any event, the majority\u2019s arguments about supervi\u00ad\nsion and control are not new. They were considered and\nrejected in Stern. See 564 U.

The\nmajority points to no differences between the bankruptcy\nproceeding in Stern and the bankruptcy proceeding here,\nexcept for Sharif \u2019s purported consent. The majority thus\ntreats consent as \u201cdispositive\u201d in curing the structural\nseparation of powers violation\u2014precisely what Schor said\nconsent could not do. 478 U. S., at 851.\n                               C\n   Eager to change the subject from Stern, the majority\ndevotes considerable attention to defending the authority\nof magistrate judges, who may conduct certain proceed\u00ad\nings with the consent of the parties under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7636. No one here challenges the constitutionality of\nmagistrate judges or disputes that they, like bankruptcy\njudges, may issue reports and recommendations that are\nreviewed de novo by Article III judges. The cases about\nmagistrate judges cited by the majority therefore have\nlittle bearing on this case, because none of them involved a\nconstitutional challenge to the entry of final judgment by a\nnon-Article III actor. See Roell v. Withrow, 538 U. S. 580\n(2003) (statutory challenge only); Peretz v. United States,\n501 U. S. 923 (1991) (challenge to a magistrate judge\u2019s\nconduct of voir dire in a felony trial); Gomez v. United\nStates, 490 U. S. 858 (1989) (same).\n   The majority also points to 19th-century cases in which\ncourts referred disputes to non-Article III referees, mas\u00ad\nters, or arbitrators. Ante, at 8. In those cases, however, it\nwas the Article III court that ultimately entered final\njudgment. E.g., Thornton v. Carson, 7 Cranch 596, 600\n(1813) (\u201cthe Court was right in entering the judgment for\nthe sums awarded\u201d). Article III courts do refer matters to\nnon-Article III actors for assistance from time to time.\nThis Court does so regularly in original jurisdiction cases.\nSee, e.g., Kansas v. Nebraska, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n(slip op., at 1). But under the Constitution, the \u201cultimate\nresponsibility for deciding\u201d the case must remain with the\nArticle III court. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Colo-\nrado v. New Mexico, 467 U. S. 310, 317 (1984)).\n   The concurrence\u2019s comparison of bankruptcy judges to\narbitrators is similarly inapt. Ante, at 1 (opinion of ALITO,\nJ.). Arbitration is \u201ca matter of contract\u201d by which parties\nagree to resolve their disputes in a private forum. Rent-A-\nCenter, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. 63, 67 (2010).\nSuch an arrangement does not implicate Article III any\nmore than does an agreement between two business part\u00ad\nners to submit a difference of opinion to a mutually trusted\nfriend. Arbitration agreements, like most private con\u00ad\ntracts, can be enforced in court. And Congress, pursuant\nto its Commerce Clause power, has authorized district\ncourts to enter judgments enforcing arbitration awards\nunder certain circumstances. See 9 U. S. C. \u00a79. But this\nordinary scheme of contract enforcement creates no consti\u00ad\ntutional concern. As the concurrence acknowledges, only\nArticle III judges\u2014not arbitrators\u2014may enter final judg\u00ad\nments enforcing arbitration awards. Ante, at 1.\n   The discussion of magistrate judges, masters, arbitra\u00ad\ntors, and the like fits with the majority\u2019s focus on the\nsupposedly dire consequences that would follow a decision\nthat parties cannot consent to the final adjudication of\nStern claims in bankruptcy courts. Of course, it \u201cgoes\nwithout saying\u201d that practical considerations of efficiency\nand convenience cannot trump the structural protections\nof the Constitution. Stern, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n36); see Perez, 575 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 20) (\u201cEven in the face of perceived\nnecessity, the Constitution protects us from ourselves.\u201d).\nAnd I find it hard to believe that the Framers in Philadel\u00ad\nphia, who took great care to ensure that the Judiciary was\n\u201ctruly distinct\u201d from the Legislature, would have been\ncomforted to know that Congress\u2019s incursion here could\n18       WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

S., at 856).\n   In any event, the majority overstates the consequences\nof enforcing the requirements of Article III in this case. As\nexplained in Part I, Wellness\u2019s claim may not be a Stern\nclaim, in which case the bankruptcy statute would apply\nprecisely as Congress wrote it. Even if Wellness\u2019s claim\nwere a Stern claim, the District Court would not need to\nstart from scratch. As this Court held in Arkison, the\nDistrict Court could treat the bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision\nas a recommendation and enter judgment after performing\nde novo review. 573 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   In Stern, the Court cautioned that Congress \u201cmay no\nmore lawfully chip away at the authority of the Judicial\nBranch than it may eliminate it entirely.\u201d 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 37). The majority sees no reason to fret,\nhowever, so long as two private parties consent. Ante, at\n14, n. 10. But such parties are unlikely to carefully weigh\nthe long-term structural independence of the Article III\njudiciary against their own short-term priorities. Perhaps\nthe majority\u2019s acquiescence in this diminution of constitu\u00ad\ntional authority will escape notice. Far more likely, how\u00ad\never, it will amount to the kind of \u201cblueprint for extensive\nexpansion of the legislative power\u201d that we have resisted\nin the past. PCAOB, 561 U. S., at 500 (quoting Metropoli-\ntan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abate-\nment of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 277 (1991)).\n   The encroachment at issue here may seem benign\nenough. Bankruptcy judges are devoted professionals who\nstrive to be fair to all sides, and litigants can be trusted to\nprotect their own interests when deciding whether to\nconsent. But the fact remains that Congress controls the\nsalary and tenure of bankruptcy judges, and the Legisla\u00ad\nture\u2019s present solicitude provides no guarantee of its fu\u00ad\nture restraint. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530,\n534 (1962) (plurality opinion). Once Congress knows that\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nit can assign federal claims to judges outside Article III\nwith the parties\u2019 consent, nothing would limit its exercise\nof that power to bankruptcy. Congress may consider it\nadvantageous to allow claims to be heard before judges\nsubject to greater legislative control in any number of\nareas of federal concern. As for the requirement of con\u00ad\nsent, Congress can find ways to \u201cencourage\u201d consent, say\nby requiring it as a condition of federal benefits. That has\nworked to expand Congress\u2019s power before. See, e.g.,\nCollege Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary\nEd. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999) (\u201cCongress\nmay, in the exercise of its spending power, condition its\ngrant of funds to the States upon their taking certain\nactions that Congress could not require them to take\u201d);\nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 207 (1987) (same).\n   Legislative designs of this kind would not displace the\nArticle III judiciary overnight. But steady erosion of\nArticle III authority, no less than a brazen usurpation,\nviolates the constitutional separation of powers. In a\nFederal Government of limited powers, one branch\u2019s loss is\nanother branch\u2019s gain, see PCAOB, 561 U. S., at 500, so\nwhether a branch aims to \u201carrogate power to itself \u201d or to\n\u201cimpair another in the performance of its constitutional\nduties,\u201d the Constitution forbids the transgression all the\nsame. Loving, 517 U. S., at 757. As we have cautioned,\n\u201c[s]light encroachments create new boundaries from which\nlegions of power can seek new territory to capture.\u201d Stern,\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 38) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   The Framers understood this danger. They warned that\nthe Legislature would inevitably seek to draw greater\npower into its \u201cimpetuous vortex,\u201d The Federalist No. 48,\nat 309 (J. Madison), and that \u201cpower over a man\u2019s subsist\u00ad\nence amounts to a power over his will,\u201d id., No. 79, at 472\n(A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted). In response, the Fram\u00ad\ners adopted the structural protections of Article III, \u201ces\u00ad\n20       WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

S., at\n239. As this Court once put it, invoking Frost, \u201cGood\nfences make good neighbors.\u201d Id., at 240.\n  Ultimately, however, the structural protections of Arti\u00ad\ncle III are only as strong as this Court\u2019s will to enforce\nthem. In Madison\u2019s words, the \u201cgreat security against a\ngradual concentration of the several powers in the same\ndepartment consists in giving to those who administer\neach department the necessary constitutional means and\npersonal motives to resist encroachments of the others.\u201d\nThe Federalist No. 51, at 321\u2013322 (J. Madison). The\nCourt today declines to resist encroachment by the Legis\u00ad\nlature. Instead it holds that a single federal judge, for\nreasons adequate to him, may assign away our hard-won\nconstitutional birthright so long as two private parties\nagree. I hope I will be wrong about the consequences of\nthis decision for the independence of the Judicial Branch.\nBut for now, another literary passage comes to mind: It\nprofits the Court nothing to give its soul for the whole\nworld . . . but to avoid Stern claims?\n  I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

See Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___ (2011). I write\nseparately to highlight a few questions touching on the\nconsent issue that merit closer attention than either the\nCourt or THE CHIEF JUSTICE gives them.\n  I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that individuals cannot\nconsent to violations of the Constitution, but this principle\nhas nothing to do with whose interest the violated provi-\nsion protects. Anytime the Federal Government acts in a\nmanner inconsistent with the separation of powers, it acts\nin excess of its constitutional authority. That authority is\ncarefully defined by the Constitution, and, except through\nArticle V\u2019s amendment process, that document does not\npermit individuals to bestow additional power upon the\nGovernment.\n  The majority today authorizes non-Article III courts to\nadjudicate, with consent, claims that we have held to\nrequire an exercise of the judicial power based on its as-\nsessment that few \u201cstructural interests\u201d are implicated by\nconsent to the adjudication of Stern claims. See ante, at 7,\n12. That reasoning is flawed. It matters not whether we\nthink the particular violation threatens the structure of\n2        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nour Government. Our duty is to enforce the Constitution\nas written, not as revised by private consent, innocuous or\notherwise. Worse, amidst the tempest over whether\n\u201cstructural interests\u201d are implicated when an individual\nconsents to adjudication of Stern claims by a non-Article\nIII court, both the majority and THE CHIEF JUSTICE fail to\ngrapple with the antecedent question: whether a violation\nof the Constitution has actually occurred. That question is\na difficult one, and the majority makes a grave mistake by\nskipping over it in its quest to answer the question whether\nconsent can authorize a constitutional violation. Because\nI would resolve this case on narrower grounds, I need not\ndecide that question here. I nevertheless write separately\nto highlight the complexity of the issues the majority\nsimply brushes past.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   \u201cThe principle, that [the Federal Government] can\nexercise only the powers granted to it, . . . is now univer-\nsally admitted.\u201d McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n405 (1819). A corollary to this principle is that each\nbranch of the Government is limited to the exercise of\nthose powers granted to it. Every violation of the separa-\ntion of powers thus involves an exercise of power in excess\nof the Constitution. And because the only authorities\ncapable of granting power are the Constitution itself, and\nthe people acting through the amendment process, indi-\nvidual consent cannot authorize the Government to exceed\nconstitutional boundaries.\n   This does not mean, however, that consent is invariably\nirrelevant to the constitutional inquiry. Although it may\nnot authorize a constitutional violation, consent may\nprevent one from occurring in the first place. This concept\nis perhaps best understood with the example on which the\nmajority and THE CHIEF JUSTICE both rely: the right to a\n                      Cite as: 575 U.

J., dissenting).1 Although the Government\nincurably contravenes the Constitution when it acts in\nviolation of the jury trial right, our precedents permit the\nGovernment to convict a criminal defendant without a\njury trial when he waives that right. See Brady v. United\nStates, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). The defendant\u2019s waiver\nis thus a form of consent that lifts a limitation on govern-\nment action by satisfying its terms\u2014that is, the right is\nexercised and honored, not disregarded. See Patton v.\nUnited States, 281 U. S. 276, 296\u2013298 (1930), abrogated on\nother grounds by Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970).\nProvided the Government otherwise acts within its pow-\ners, there is no constitutional violation.\n                              B\n  Consent to the adjudication of Stern claims by bank-\nruptcy courts is a far more complex matter than waiver of\na jury trial. Two potential violations of the separation of\npowers occur whenever bankruptcy courts adjudicate\nStern claims. First, the bankruptcy courts purport to\nexercise power that the Constitution vests exclusively in\nthe judiciary, even though they are not Article III courts\nbecause bankruptcy judges do not enjoy the tenure and\nsalary protections required by Article III. See Art. III, \u00a71.\nSecond, the bankruptcy courts act pursuant to statutory\nauthorization that is itself invalid. For even when acting\npursuant to an enumerated power, such as the bankruptcy\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 There is some dispute whether the guarantee of a jury trial protects\nan individual right, a structural right, or both, raising serious questions\nabout how it should be treated under Commodity Futures Trading\nComm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986). My view, which does not turn\non such taxonomies, leaves no doubt: It is a \u201cfundamental reservation\nof power in our constitutional structure,\u201d Blakely v. Washington, 542\nU. S. 296, 306 (2004), meaning its violation may not be authorized by\nthe consent of the individual.\n4        WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npower, Congress exceeds its authority when it purports to\nauthorize a person or entity to perform a function that\nrequires the exercise of a power vested elsewhere by the\nConstitution. See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns.,\nInc., 531 U. S. 457, 472 (2001).\n   Rather than attempt to grapple with these problems,\nthe majority seizes on some statements from Commodity\nFutures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986), to\nresolve the difficult constitutional issue before us. See\nante, at 9\u201312. But to the extent Schor suggests that indi-\nvidual consent could authorize non-Article III courts to\nexercise the judicial power, 478 U. S., at 850\u2013851, it was\nwrongly decided and should be abandoned. Consent to\nadjudication by non-Article III judges may waive whatever\nindividual right to impartial adjudication Article III im-\nplies, thereby lifting that affirmative barrier on Govern-\nment action. But non-Article III courts must still act\nwithin the bounds of their constitutional authority. That\nis, they must act through a power properly delegated to\nthe Federal Government and not vested by the Constitu-\ntion in a different governmental actor. Because the judi-\ncial power is vested exclusively in Article III courts, non-\nArticle III courts may not exercise it.\n   Schor\u2019s justification for authorizing such a transgression\nwas that it judged the \u201cpractical effect [the allocation\nwould] have on the constitutionally assigned role of the\nfederal judiciary\u201d not to be too great.

In order to answer that question, we\nmust consider what form of governmental power that type\nof adjudication requires and whether bankruptcy courts\nare qualified to exercise that power.

The distinction generally has to\ndo with the types of rights at issue. Disposition of private\nrights to life, liberty, and property falls within the core of\nthe judicial power, whereas disposition of public rights\ndoes not. From that core of the judicial power, we have\nidentified two narrow historical exceptions. Those excep-\ntions, along with the treatment of cases or controversies\nnot falling within that core, provide useful guidance for\nunderstanding whether bankruptcy courts\u2019 adjudication of\nStern claims with the consent of the parties requires the\nexercise of Article III judicial power.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

Lawson, Territo-\nrial Governments and the Limits of Formalism, 78 Cal. L. Rev. 853, 892\n(1990) (criticizing it as \u201cfatuous\u201d dictum). On the one hand, some early\nevidence suggests that the courts were thought to be dealing primarily\nwith local matters that lie beyond federal judicial cognizance. Pfander,\nArticle I Tribunals, Article III Courts, and the Judicial Power of the\nUnited States, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 643, 706\u2013711 (2004). Yet Canter\ninvolved a controversy indisputably capable of adjudication by Article\nIII courts, because it both arose in admiralty and fell within the Su-\npreme Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. Pfander, supra, at 713\u2013714, n.\n314. The best explanation for this apparent tension is that territorial\ncourts adjudicate matters that Congress may or may not assign to\nArticle III courts, as it wishes. Nelson, Adjudication in the Political\nBranches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 575\u2013576 (2007).

Whatever their historical validity, these prece-\ndents exempt cases arising in the territories and in the\nland and naval forces from Article III because of other\nprovisions of the Constitution, not because of the defini-\ntion of judicial power in Article III itself. See Nelson,\nAdjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev.\n559, 576 (2007) (noting that both exceptions enjoy \u201cspecial\ntextual rationales that d[o] not spill over into other\nareas\u201d).\n   The third category consists of so-called \u201cpublic rights\u201d\ncases. Unlike the other two categories, which reflect\ncarve-outs from the core of the judicial power, this cate-\ngory describes cases outside of that core and therefore has\nmore to tell us about the scope of the judicial power.\n   The distinction between disputes involving \u201cpublic\nrights\u201d and those involving \u201cprivate rights\u201d is longstand-\ning, but the contours of the \u201cpublic rights\u201d doctrine have\nbeen the source of much confusion and controversy. See\ngenerally Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 66\u201370 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.) (tracing the evolution of the doctrine). Our\ncases attribute the doctrine to this Court\u2019s mid-19th cen-\ntury decision, Murray\u2019s Lessee, supra. In that case, the\nCourt observed that there are certain cases addressing\n\u201cpublic rights, which may be presented in such form that\nthe judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which\nare susceptible of judicial determination, but which con-\ngress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ncourts of Westminster in 1789,\u201d Stern v.

Hargis Industries, Inc., ante, at 11\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   The distinction was well known at the time of the found-\ning. In the tradition of John Locke, William Blackstone in\nhis Commentaries identified the private rights to life,\nliberty, and property as the three \u201cabsolute\u201d rights\u2014so\ncalled because they \u201cappertain[ed] and belong[ed] to par-\nticular men . . . merely as individuals,\u201d not \u201cto them as\nmembers of society [or] standing in various relations to\neach other\u201d\u2014that is, not dependent upon the will of the\ngovernment. 1 W.

The original 1215 charter is replete\nwith restrictions on the King\u2019s ability to proceed against private rights,\nincluding most notably the provision that \u201c[n]o free man shall be taken,\nimprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, . . .\nexcept by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.\u201d\nA.

L. Rev. 401, 413\n(1958).\n   The Founders carried this idea forward into the Vesting\nClauses of our Constitution. Those Clauses were under-\nstood to play a role in ensuring that the federal courts\nalone could act to deprive individuals of private rights\nbecause the power to act conclusively against those rights\nwas the core of the judicial power. As one early treatise\nexplained, the judiciary is \u201cthat department of the gov-\nernment to whom the protection of the rights of the indi-\nvidual is by the constitution especially confided.\u201d 1 St.\nGeorge Tucker, Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, App. 357\n(1803). If \u201cpublic rights\u201d were not thought to fall within\nthe core of the judicial power, then that could explain why\nCongress would be able to perform or authorize non-\nArticle III adjudications of public rights without trans-\ngressing Article III\u2019s Vesting Clause.\n   Nineteenth-century American jurisprudence confirms\nthat an exercise of the judicial power was thought to be\nnecessary for the disposition of private, but not public,\nrights.4 See B&B Hardware, ante, at 12.

By contrast, a party who sought to\nprotect only a \u201cpublic right\u201d in the land had no such vested\nright and could not invoke the intervention of Article III\ncourts. See Smelting Co. v.

See, e.g.,\nCrowell v. Benson, 285 U.

McAnnulty, 187 U. S. 94, 108 (1902), and\nothers treating what appear to be private rights as public\nrights on which executive action could be conclusive, see,\ne.g., Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v.

Northern Pipeline,\n458 U.

Plank, Why\nBankruptcy Judges Need Not and Should Not Be Article\nIII Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L. J. 567, 608 (1998) (describing\nthe bankruptcy powers vested by Congress in non-Article\nIII judges). Modern bankruptcy courts, however, adjudi-\ncate a far broader array of disputes than their earliest\nhistorical counterparts. And this Court has remained\ncarefully noncommittal about the source of their authority\nto do so. See Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 71 (plurality\nopinion).\n  Applying the historical categories of cases discussed\nabove, one can understand why. Bankruptcy courts clearly\ndo not qualify as territorial courts or courts-martial, but\nthey are not an easy fit in the \u201cpublic rights\u201d category,\neither. No doubt certain aspects of bankruptcy involve\nrights lying outside the core of the judicial power. The\nmost obvious of these is the right to discharge, which a\nparty may obtain if he satisfies certain statutory criteria.\nIbid. Discharge is not itself a private right, but, together\nwith the claims allowance process that precedes it, it can\nact conclusively on the core private rights of the debtor\u2019s\ncreditors. We have nevertheless implicitly recognized that\nthe claims allowance process may proceed in a bankruptcy\ncourt, as can any matter that would necessarily be re-\nsolved by that process, even one that affects core private\nrights. Stern, 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 30\u201331).\nFor this reason, bankruptcy courts and their prede-\n14       WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncessors more likely enjoy a unique, textually based excep-\ntion, much like territorial courts and courts-martial do.\nSee id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).\nThat is, Article I\u2019s Bankruptcy Clause serves to carve\ncases and controversies traditionally subject to resolution\nby bankruptcy commissioners out of Article III, giving\nCongress the discretion, within those historical bounda-\nries, to provide for their resolution outside of Article III\ncourts.\n                              3\n   Because Stern claims by definition fall outside of the\nhistorical boundaries of the bankruptcy carve-out, they are\nsubject to Article III. This means that, if their adjudica-\ntion requires the exercise of the judicial power, then only\nArticle III courts may perform it.\n   Although Stern claims indisputably involve private\nrights, the \u201cpublic rights\u201d doctrine suggests a way in\nwhich party consent may transform the function of adjudi-\ncating Stern claims into one that does not require the\nexercise of the judicial power. The premise of the \u201cpublic\nrights\u201d doctrine, as described above, is not that public\nrights affirmatively require adjudication by some other\ngovernmental power, but that the Government has a freer\nhand when private rights are not at issue. Accordingly,\nthis premise may not require the presence of a public right\nat all, but may apply equally to any situation in which\nprivate rights are not asserted.\n   Party consent, in turn, may have the effect of lifting that\n\u201cprivate rights\u201d bar, much in the way that waiver lifts the\nbar imposed by the right to a jury trial. Individuals may\ndispose of their own private rights freely, without judicial\nintervention. A party who consents to adjudication of a\nStern claim by a bankruptcy court is merely making a\nconditional surrender of whatever private right he has on\nthe line, contingent on some future event\u2014namely, that\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Indeed, it is on\nthis logic that the law has long encouraged and permitted\nprivate settlement of disputes, including through the\naction of an arbitrator not vested with the judicial power.\nSee ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 399\n(1868). Perhaps for this reason, decisions discussing the\nrelationship between private rights and the judicial power\nhave emphasized the \u201cinvoluntary divestiture\u201d of a private\nright. Newland v. Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 382\u2013383 (1857)\n(emphasis added).\n   But all of this does not necessarily mean that the major-\nity has wound up in the right place by the wrong path.\nEven if consent could lift the private-rights barrier to non-\njudicial Government action, it would not necessarily follow\nthat consent removes the Stern adjudication from the core\nof the judicial power. There may be other aspects of the\nadjudication that demand the exercise of the judicial\npower, such as entry of a final judgment enforceable with-\nout any further action by an Article III court. We have\nrecognized that judgments entered by Article III courts\nbear unique qualities that spring from the exercise of the\njudicial power, Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.\n211, 218\u2013219 (1995), and it may be that the entry of a\nfinal judgment bearing these qualities\u2014irrespective of the\nsubject matter of the dispute\u2014is a quintessential judicial\nfunction. See ante, at 16\u201317 (ROBERTS, C.

SHARIF\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nan award.\u201d Cooley, supra, at 399.6\n  Ultimately, this case implicates difficult questions about\nthe nature of bankruptcy procedure, judicial power, and\nremedies. In particular, if we were to determine that\ncurrent practice accords bankruptcy court judgments a\nfeature that demands the exercise of the judicial power,\nwould that mean that all bankruptcy judgments resolving\nStern claims are void, or only that courts may not give\neffect to that single feature that triggers Article III? The\nparties have briefed none of these issues, so I do not re-\nsolve them. But the number and magnitude of these\nimportant questions\u2014questions implicated by thousands\nof bankruptcy and magistrate judge decisions each year\u2014\nmerit closer attention than the majority has given them.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Numerous 19th-century State Supreme Courts held unconstitutional\n\nlaws authorizing individuals to consent to have their cases heard by an\nindividual not qualified as a judge under provisions of State Consti-\ntutions similar to Article III, \u00a71.

Acknowl-\nedging the similarity between the practices under review and the\nlegitimate practice of private arbitration, many of these decisions\npremised their finding of unconstitutionality on the issuance of a\njudgment or other writ that only judges may issue.

As instrumen-\ntalities of the Federal Government, the bankruptcy courts\nmust act pursuant to some constitutional grant of author-\nity. Even if the functions bankruptcy courts perform do not\nrequire an exercise of legislative, executive, or judicial\npower, we would need to identify the source of Congress\u2019\nauthority to establish them and to authorize them to act.\n   The historical carve-outs for territorial courts and\ncourts-martial might provide some guidance. The Court\nhas anchored Congress\u2019 authority to create territorial\ncourts in \u201cthe general right of sovereignty which exists in\nthe government, or in virtue of that clause which enables\nCongress to make all needful rules and regulations, re-\nspecting the territory belonging to the United States.\u201d\nCanter, 1 Pet., at 546. And it has anchored Congress\u2019\nauthority to create courts-martial in Congress\u2019 Article I\npowers concerning the Army and Navy, understood along-\nside the Sixth Amendment\u2019s exception of \u201c \u2018cases arising in\nthe land or naval forces,\u2019 \u201d from the grand jury require-\nment, and Article II\u2019s requirement that the President\nserve as commander in chief. Dynes, 20 How., at 78\u201379.\n   Although our cases examining the constitutionality of\nstatutes allocating the power to the bankruptcy courts\nhave not considered the source of Congress\u2019 authority to\nestablish them, the obvious textual basis is the fourth\nclause of Article I, \u00a78, which empowers Congress to \u201cestab-\nlish . . . uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies\nthroughout the United States.\u201d7 But as with the other two\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 In Northern Pipeline, the plurality rejected the argument that \u201cCon-\n\ngress\u2019 constitutional authority to establish \u2018uniform Laws on the subject\nof Bankruptcies throughout the United States\u2019 carries with it an\n18         WELLNESS INT\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nhistorical carve-outs, Congress\u2019 power to establish tribu-\nnals within that grant is informed by historical under-\nstandings of the bankruptcy power.8 We have suggested\nthat, under this historical understanding, Congress has\nthe power to establish bankruptcy courts that exercise\njurisdiction akin to that of bankruptcy commissioners in\nEngland, subject to review traditionally had in England.\nAnte, at 3\u20134 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). Although Stern\nclaims, by definition, lie outside those historical bounda-\nries, a historical practice of allowing broader adjudication\nby bankruptcy commissioners acting with the consent of\nthe parties could alter the analysis. The parties once\nagain do not brief these questions, but they merit closer\nattention by this Court.\n                        *     *    *\n   Whether parties may consent to bankruptcy court adju-\ndication of Stern claims is a difficult constitutional ques-\ntion. It turns on issues that are not adequately considered\nby the Court or briefed by the parties. And it cannot\u2014and\nshould not\u2014be resolved through a cursory reading of\nSchor, which itself is hardly a model of careful constitu-\ntional interpretation. For these reasons, I would resolve\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ninherent power to establish legislative courts capable of adjudicating\n\u2018bankruptcy-related controversies.\u2019 \u201d Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v.\nMarathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 72 (1982) (plurality opinion)\n(citation omitted). In that context, however, it was considering whether\nArticle III imposes limits on Congress\u2019 bankruptcy power, id., at 73,\nwhich is a distinct question from whether Congress has the power to\nestablish bankruptcy courts as an antecedent matter, leaving aside any\nArticle III limitations.\n   8 I would be wary of concluding that every grant of lawmaking au-\n\nthority to Congress includes the power to establish \u201clegislative courts\u201d\nas part of its legislative scheme. Some have suggested that Congress\u2019\nauthority to establish tribunals pursuant to substantive grants of\nauthority is informed and limited by its Article I power to \u201cconstitute\nTribunals inferior to the supreme Court,\u201d U.
