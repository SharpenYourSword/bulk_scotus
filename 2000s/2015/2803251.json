Argued March 31, 2015—Decided May 26, 2015\nPetitioner Commil USA, LLC, holder of a patent for a method of im-\n  plementing short-range wireless networks, filed suit, claiming that\n  respondent Cisco Systems, Inc., a maker and seller of wireless net-\n  working equipment, had directly infringed Commil’s patent in its\n  networking equipment and had induced others to infringe the patent\n  by selling the infringing equipment for them to use. After two trials,\n  Cisco was found liable for both direct and induced infringement.\n  With regard to inducement, Cisco had raised the defense that it had a\n  good-faith belief that Commil’s patent was invalid, but the District\n  Court found Cisco’s supporting evidence inadmissible. The Federal\n  Circuit affirmed the District Court’s judgment in part, vacated in\n  part, and remanded, holding, as relevant here, that the trial court\n  erred in excluding Cisco’s evidence of its good-faith belief that Com-\n  mil’s patent was invalid.\nHeld: A defendant’s belief regarding patent validity is not a defense to\n an induced infringement claim. Pp. 5–14.\n    (a) While this case centers on inducement liability, 35 U. S. C.\n §271(b), which attaches only if the defendant knew of the patent and\n that “the induced acts constitute patent infringement,” Global-Tech\n Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 563 U. S. ___, ___, the discussion here\n also refers to direct infringement, §271(a), a strict-liability offense in\n which a defendant’s mental state is irrelevant, and contributory in-\n fringement, §271(c), which, like inducement liability, requires\n knowledge of the patent in suit and knowledge of patent infringe-\n ment, Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S.\n 476, 488 (Aro II). Pp. 5–6.\n    (b) In Global-Tech, this Court held that “induced infringement . . .\n requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringe-\n2             COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ment,” 563 U. S., at ___, relying on the reasoning of Aro II, a contrib-\n    utory infringement case, because the mental state imposed in each\n    instance is similar. Contrary to the claim of Commil and the Gov-\n    ernment as amicus, it was not only knowledge of the existence of re-\n    spondent’s patent that led the Court to affirm the liability finding in\n    Global-Tech, but also the fact that petitioner’s actions demonstrated\n    that it knew it would be causing customers to infringe respondent’s\n    patent. 563 U. S., at ___. Qualifying or limiting that holding could\n    make a person, or entity, liable for induced or contributory infringe-\n    ment even though he did not know the acts were infringing. Global-\n    Tech requires more, namely proof the defendant knew the acts were\n    infringing. And that opinion was clear in rejecting any lesser mental\n    state as the standard. Id., at ___. Pp. 6–9.\n       (c) Because induced infringement and validity are separate issues\n    and have separate defenses under the Act, belief regarding validity\n    cannot negate §271(b)’s scienter requirement of “actively induce[d]\n    infringement,” i.e., the intent to “bring about the desired result” of in-\n    fringement, 563 U. S., at ___. When infringement is the issue, the\n    patent’s validity is not the question to be confronted. See Cardinal\n    Chemical Co. v. Morton Int’l, Inc., 508 U. S. 83. Otherwise, the long\n    held presumption that a patent is valid, §282(a), would be under-\n    mined, permitting circumvention of the high bar—the clear and con-\n    vincing standard—that defendants must surmount to rebut the pre-\n    sumption. See Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U. S. ___,\n    ___–___. To be sure, if a patent is shown to be invalid, there is no pa-\n    tent to be infringed. But the orderly administration of the patent\n    system requires courts to interpret and implement the statutory\n    framework to determine the procedures and sequences that the par-\n    ties must follow to prove the act of wrongful inducement and any re-\n    lated issues of patent validity.\n       There are practical reasons not to create a defense of belief in inva-\n    lidity for induced infringement. Accused inducers who believe a pa-\n    tent is invalid have other, proper ways to obtain a ruling to that ef-\n    fect, including, e.g., seeking ex parte reexamination of the patent by\n    the Patent and Trademark Office, something Cisco did here. Creat-\n    ing such a defense could also have negative consequences, including,\n    e.g., rendering litigation more burdensome for all involved. Pp. 9–13.\n       (d) District courts have the authority and responsibility to ensure\n    that frivolous cases—brought by companies using patents as a sword\n    to go after defendants for money—are dissuaded, though no issue of\n    frivolity has been raised here. Safeguards—including, e.g., sanction-\n    ing attorneys for bringing such suits, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11—\n    combined with the avenues that accused inducers have to obtain rul-\n    ings on the validity of patents, militate in favor of maintaining the\n                      Cite as: 575 U.

One form of\npatent injury occurs if unauthorized persons or entities\ncopy, use, or otherwise infringe upon the patented inven-\ntion. Another form of injury to the patent holder or his\nlicensees can occur when the actor induces others to in-\nfringe the patent. In the instant case, both forms of in-\njury—direct infringement and wrongful inducement of\nothers to commit infringement—were alleged. After two\ntrials, the defendant was found liable for both types of\ninjury. The dispute now before the Court concerns the\ninducement aspect of the case.\n                            I\n  The patent holder who commenced this action is the\npetitioner here, Commil USA, LLC. The technical details\nof Commil’s patent are not at issue.

In order to cover the\nlarge space, the system needs multiple base stations so a\nuser can move around the area and still stay connected.\nCommil’s patent relates to a method of providing faster\nand more reliable communications between devices and\nbase stations. The particular claims of Commil’s patent\nare discussed in the opinion of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit. 720 F. 3d 1361, 1364–\n1365, 1372 (2013).\n  Commil brought this action against Cisco Systems, Inc.,\nwhich makes and sells wireless networking equipment. In\n2007, Commil sued Cisco in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas. Cisco is the re-\nspondent here. Commil alleged that Cisco had infringed\nCommil’s patent by making and using networking equip-\nment. In addition Commil alleged that Cisco had induced\nothers to infringe the patent by selling the infringing\nequipment for them to use, in contravention of Commil’s\nexclusive patent rights.\n  At the first trial, the jury concluded that Commil’s\npatent was valid and that Cisco had directly infringed.\nThe jury awarded Commil $3.7 million in damages. As to\ninduced infringement, the jury found Cisco not liable.\nCommil filed a motion for a new trial on induced infringe-\nment and damages, which the District Court granted\nbecause of certain inappropriate comments Cisco’s counsel\nhad made during the first trial.\n  A month before the second trial Cisco went to the United\nStates Patent and Trademark Office and asked it to re-\nexamine the validity of Commil’s patent. The Office\ngranted the request; but, undoubtedly to Cisco’s disap-\npointment, it confirmed the validity of Commil’s patent.\nApp. 159, 162.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Back in the District Court, the second trial proceeded,\nlimited to the issues of inducement and damages on that\nissue and direct infringement. As a defense to the claim of\ninducement, Cisco argued it had a good-faith belief that\nCommil’s patent was invalid. It sought to introduce evi-\ndence to support that assertion. The District Court, how-\never, ruled that Cisco’s proffered evidence of its good-faith\nbelief in the patent’s invalidity was inadmissible. While\nthe District Court’s order does not provide the reason for\nthe ruling, it seems the court excluded this evidence on the\nassumption that belief in invalidity is not a defense to a\nplaintiff ’s claim that the defendant induced others to\ninfringe.\n   At the close of trial, and over Cisco’s objection, the Dis-\ntrict Court instructed the jury that it could find induce-\nment if “Cisco actually intended to cause the acts that\nconstitute . . . direct infringement and that Cisco knew or\nshould have known that its actions would induce actual\ninfringement.” Id., at 21. The jury returned a verdict for\nCommil on induced infringement and awarded $63.7\nmillion in damages.\n   After the verdict, but before judgment, this Court issued\nits decision in Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A.,\n563 U. S. ___ (2011). That case, as will be discussed in\nmore detail, held that, in an action for induced infringe-\nment, it is necessary for the plaintiff to show that the\nalleged inducer knew of the patent in question and knew\nthe induced acts were infringing. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10). Relying on that case, Cisco again urged that the\njury instruction was incorrect because it did not state\nknowledge as the governing standard for inducement\nliability. The District Court denied Cisco’s motion and\nentered judgment in Commil’s favor.\n   Cisco appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals affirmed in\npart, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceed-\n4         COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nings. The court concluded it was error for the District\nCourt to have instructed the jury that Cisco could be liable\nfor induced infringement if it “ ‘knew or should have\nknown’ ” that its customers infringed. 720 F. 3d, at 1366.\nThe panel held that “induced infringement ‘requires\nknowledge that the induced acts constitute patent in-\nfringement.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Global-Tech, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 10)). By stating that Cisco could be found\nliable if it “ ‘knew or should have known that its actions\nwould induce actual infringement,’ ” the Court of Appeals\nexplained, the District Court had allowed “the jury to find\n[Cisco] liable based on mere negligence where knowledge\nis required.” 720 F. 3d, at 1366. That ruling, which re-\nquires a new trial on the inducement claim with a corrected\ninstruction on knowledge, is not in question here.\n   What is at issue is the second holding of the Court of\nAppeals, addressing Cisco’s contention that the trial court\ncommitted further error in excluding Cisco’s evidence that\nit had a good-faith belief that Commil’s patent was in-\nvalid. Beginning with the observation that it is “axiomatic\nthat one cannot infringe an invalid patent,” the Court of\nAppeals reasoned that “evidence of an accused inducer’s\ngood-faith belief of invalidity may negate the requisite\nintent for induced infringement.” Id., at 1368. The court\nsaw “no principled distinction between a good-faith belief\nof invalidity and a good-faith belief of non-infringement for\nthe purpose of whether a defendant possessed the specific\nintent to induce infringement of a patent.” Ibid.\n   Judge Newman dissented on that point. In Judge\nNewman’s view a defendant’s good-faith belief in a pa-\ntent’s invalidity is not a defense to induced infringement.\nShe reasoned that “whether there is infringement in fact\ndoes not depend on the belief of the accused infringer that\nit might succeed in invalidating the patent.” Id., at 1374\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Both\nparties filed petitions for rehearing en banc, which were\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndenied. 737 F. 3d 699, 700 (2013). Five judges, however,\nwould have granted rehearing en banc to consider the\nquestion whether a good-faith belief in invalidity is a\ndefense to induced infringement. Id., at 700 (Reyna, J.,\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n  This Court granted certiorari to decide that question.\n574 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                              II\n  Although the precise issue to be addressed concerns a\nclaim of improper inducement to infringe, the discussion\nto follow refers as well to direct infringement and contrib-\nutory infringement, so it is instructive at the outset to set\nforth the statutory provisions pertaining to these three\nforms of liability. These three relevant provisions are\nfound in §271 of the Patent Act. 35 U. S. C. §271.\n  Subsection (a) governs direct infringement and provides:\n      “Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever\n    without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells\n    any patented invention, within the United States or\n    imports into the United States any patented invention\n    during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the\n    patent.”\nUnder this form of liability, a defendant’s mental state is\nirrelevant. Direct infringement is a strict-liability offense.\nGlobal-Tech, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5, n. 2).\n   Subsection (b) governs induced infringement:\n      “Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent\n    shall be liable as an infringer.”\nIn contrast to direct infringement, liability for inducing\ninfringement attaches only if the defendant knew of the\npatent and that “the induced acts constitute patent in-\nfringement.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). In Commil and\nthe Government’s view, not only is knowledge or belief in\n6         COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe patent’s validity irrelevant, they further argue the\nparty charged with inducing infringement need not know\nthat the acts it induced would infringe. On this latter\npoint, they are incorrect, as will be explained below.\n  Subsection (c) deals with contributory infringement:\n       “Whoever offers to sell or sells within the United\n    States or imports into the United States a component\n    of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or\n    composition, or a material or apparatus for use in\n    practicing a patented process, constituting a material\n    part of the invention, knowing the same to be espe-\n    cially made or especially adapted for use in an in-\n    fringement of such patent, and not a staple article or\n    commodity of commerce suitable for substantial non-\n    infringing use, shall be liable as a contributory\n    infringer.”\nLike induced infringement, contributory infringement\nrequires knowledge of the patent in suit and knowledge of\npatent infringement. Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top\nReplacement Co., 377 U. S. 476, 488 (1964) (Aro II).\n  This case asks a question of first impression: whether\nknowledge of, or belief in, a patent’s validity is required\nfor induced infringement under §271(b).\n                             A\n   Before turning to the question presented, it is necessary\nto reaffirm what the Court held in Global-Tech. Commil\nand the Government (which supports Commil in this case)\nargue that Global-Tech should be read as holding that\nonly knowledge of the patent is required for induced in-\nfringement. That, as will be explained, would contravene\nGlobal-Tech’s explicit holding that liability for induced\ninfringement can only attach if the defendant knew of the\npatent and knew as well that “the induced acts constitute\npatent infringement.” 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In Global-Tech, the plaintiff, SEB, had invented and\npatented a deep fryer. A few years later, Sunbeam asked\nPentalpha to supply deep fryers for Sunbeam to sell. To\nmake the deep fryer, Pentalpha bought an SEB fryer and\ncopied all but the cosmetic features. Pentalpha then sold\nthe fryers to Sunbeam, which in turn sold them to custom-\ners. SEB sued Pentalpha for induced infringement, argu-\ning Pentalpha had induced Sunbeam and others to sell the\ninfringing fryers in violation of SEB’s patent rights. In\ndefense, Pentalpha argued it did not know the deep fryer\nit copied was patented and therefore could not be liable for\ninducing anyone to infringe SEB’s patent. The question\npresented to this Court was “whether a party who ‘actively\ninduces infringement of a patent’ under 35 U. S. C. §271(b)\nmust know that the induced acts constitute patent in-\nfringement.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).\n   After noting the language of §271(b) and the case law\nprior to passage of the Patent Act did not resolve the\nquestion, the Global-Tech Court turned to Aro II, a case\nabout contributory infringement. The Global-Tech Court\ndeemed that rules concerning contributory infringement\nwere relevant to induced infringement, because the men-\ntal state imposed in each instance is similar. Before the\nPatent Act, inducing infringement was not a separate\ntheory of indirect liability but was evidence of contributory\ninfringement. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). Thus, in\nmany respects, it is proper to find common ground in the\ntwo theories of liability.\n   Aro II concluded that to be liable for contributory in-\nfringement, a defendant must know the acts were infring-\ning. 377 U. S., at 488. In Global-Tech, the Court said this\nreasoning was applicable, explaining as follows:\n      “Based on this premise, it follows that the same\n    knowledge is needed for induced infringement under\n    §271(b). As noted, the two provisions have a common\n8         COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    origin in the pre-1952 understanding of contributory\n    infringement, and the language of the two provisions\n    creates the same difficult interpretive choice. It\n    would thus be strange to hold that knowledge of the\n    relevant patent is needed under §271(c) but not under\n    §271(b).\n      “Accordingly, we now hold that induced infringe-\n    ment under §271(b) requires knowledge that the in-\n    duced acts constitute patent infringement.” 563 U. S.,\n    at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n  In support of Commil, the Government argues against\nthe clear language of Global-Tech. According to the Gov-\nernment, all Global-Tech requires is knowledge of the\npatent: “The Court did not definitively resolve whether\nSection 271(b) additionally requires knowledge of the\ninfringing nature of the induced acts.” Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 9. See also Brief for Petitioner\n17. Together, Commil and the Government claim the\n“factual circumstances” of Global-Tech “did not require”\nthe Court to decide whether knowledge of infringement is\nrequired for inducement liability. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12. See also Brief for Petitioner 23–24.\nBut in the Court’s Global-Tech decision, its description of\nthe factual circumstances suggests otherwise. The Court\nconcluded there was enough evidence to support a finding\nthat Pentalpha knew “the infringing nature of the sales it\nencouraged Sunbeam to make.” 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14). It was not only knowledge of the existence of SEB’s\npatent that led the Court to affirm the liability finding but\nalso it was the fact that Pentalpha copied “all but the\ncosmetic features of SEB’s fryer,” demonstrating Pental-\npha knew it would be causing customers to infringe SEB’s\npatent. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\n  Accepting the Government and Commil’s argument\nwould require this Court to depart from its prior holding.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). See also id., at ___\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1) (“The Court is\ncorrect, in my view, to conclude that . . . to induce in-\nfringement a defendant must know the acts constitute\npatent infringement” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nAnd the Global-Tech rationale is sound. Qualifying or\nlimiting its holding, as the Government and Commil seek\nto do, would lead to the conclusion, both in inducement\nand contributory infringement cases, that a person, or\nentity, could be liable even though he did not know the\nacts were infringing. In other words, even if the defendant\nreads the patent’s claims differently from the plaintiff, and\nthat reading is reasonable, he would still be liable because\nhe knew the acts might infringe. Global-Tech requires\nmore. It requires proof the defendant knew the acts were\ninfringing. And the Court’s opinion was clear in rejecting\nany lesser mental state as the standard. Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 13–14).\n                              B\n  The question the Court confronts today concerns whether\na defendant’s belief regarding patent validity is a defense\nto a claim of induced infringement. It is not. The scienter\nelement for induced infringement concerns infringement;\nthat is a different issue than validity. Section 271(b)\nrequires that the defendant “actively induce[d] infringe-\nment.” That language requires intent to “bring about the\ndesired result,” which is infringement. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 4). And because infringement and validity are separate\nissues under the Act, belief regarding validity cannot\nnegate the scienter required under §271(b).\n  When infringement is the issue, the validity of the\npatent is not the question to be confronted. In Cardinal\nChemical Co. v. Morton Int’l, Inc., 508 U. S. 83 (1993), the\nCourt explained, “A party seeking a declaratory judgment\nof invalidity presents a claim independent of the patent-\n10        COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nee’s charge of infringement.” Id., at 96. It further held\nnoninfringement and invalidity were “alternative grounds”\nfor dismissing the suit. Id., at 98. And in Deposit Guaranty\nNat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326 (1980), the Court\nexplained that an accused infringer “may prevail either by\nsuccessfully attacking the validity of the patent or by\nsuccessfully defending the charge of infringement.” Id., at\n334. These explanations are in accord with the long-\naccepted truth—perhaps the axiom—that infringement\nand invalidity are separate matters under patent law. See\nPandrol USA, LP v. Airboss R. Prods., Inc., 320 F. 3d\n1354, 1365 (CA Fed. 2003).\n   Indeed, the issues of infringement and validity appear\nin separate parts of the Patent Act. Part III of the Act\ndeals with “Patents and Protection of Patent Rights,”\nincluding the right to be free from infringement. §§251–\n329. Part II, entitled “Patentability of Inventions and\nGrants of Patents,” defines what constitutes a valid pa-\ntent. §§100–212. Further, noninfringement and invalidity\nare listed as two separate defenses, see §§282(b)(1), (2),\nand defendants are free to raise either or both of them.\nSee Cardinal, supra, at 98. Were this Court to interpret\n§271(b) as permitting a defense of belief in invalidity, it\nwould conflate the issues of infringement and validity.\n   Allowing this new defense would also undermine a\npresumption that is a “common core of thought and truth”\nreflected in this Court’s precedents for a century. Radio\nCorp. of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc.,\n293 U. S. 1, 8 (1934). Under the Patent Act, and the case\nlaw before its passage, a patent is “presumed valid.”\n§282(a); id., at 8. That presumption takes away any need\nfor a plaintiff to prove his patent is valid to bring a claim.\nBut if belief in invalidity were a defense to induced in-\nfringement, the force of that presumption would be less-\nened to a drastic degree, for a defendant could prevail if he\nproved he reasonably believed the patent was invalid.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThat would circumvent the high bar Congress is presumed\nto have chosen: the clear and convincing standard. See\nMicrosoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U. S. ___, ___–\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 8–10). Defendants must meet that\nstandard to rebut the presumption of validity. Ibid.\n   To say that an invalid patent cannot be infringed, or\nthat someone cannot be induced to infringe an invalid\npatent, is in one sense a simple truth, both as a matter of\nlogic and semantics. See M. Swift & Sons, Inc. v. W. H.\nCoe Mfg. Co., 102 F. 2d 391, 396 (CA1 1939). But the\nquestions courts must address when interpreting and\nimplementing the statutory framework require a determi-\nnation of the procedures and sequences that the parties\nmust follow to prove the act of wrongful inducement and\nany related issues of patent validity. “Validity and in-\nfringement are distinct issues, bearing different burdens,\ndifferent presumptions, and different evidence.”           720\nF. 3d, at 1374 (opinion of Newman, J.). To be sure, if at\nthe end of the day, an act that would have been an in-\nfringement or an inducement to infringe pertains to a\npatent that is shown to be invalid, there is no patent to be\ninfringed. But the allocation of the burden to persuade on\nthese questions, and the timing for the presentations of\nthe relevant arguments, are concerns of central relevance\nto the orderly administration of the patent system.\n   Invalidity is an affirmative defense that “can preclude\nenforcement of a patent against otherwise infringing\nconduct.” 6A Chisum on Patents §19.01, p. 19–5 (2015).\nAn accused infringer can, of course, attempt to prove that\nthe patent in suit is invalid; if the patent is indeed invalid,\nand shown to be so under proper procedures, there is no\nliability. See i4i, supra, at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–12).\nThat is because invalidity is not a defense to infringement,\nit is a defense to liability. And because of that fact, a\nbelief as to invalidity cannot negate the scienter required\nfor induced infringement.\n12        COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   There are also practical reasons not to create a defense\nbased on a good-faith belief in invalidity. First and fore-\nmost, accused inducers who believe a patent is invalid\nhave various proper ways to obtain a ruling to that effect.\nThey can file a declaratory judgment action asking a\nfederal court to declare the patent invalid. See MedIm-\nmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 137 (2007).\nThey can seek inter partes review at the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board and receive a decision as to validity within\n12 to 18 months. See §316. Or they can, as Cisco did\nhere, seek ex parte reexamination of the patent by the\nPatent and Trademark Office. §302. And, of course, any\naccused infringer who believes the patent in suit is invalid\nmay raise the affirmative defense of invalidity. §282(b)(2).\nIf the defendant is successful, he will be immune from\nliability.\n   Creating a defense of belief in invalidity, furthermore,\nwould have negative consequences. It can render litiga-\ntion more burdensome for everyone involved. Every ac-\ncused inducer would have an incentive to put forth a\ntheory of invalidity and could likely come up with myriad\narguments. See Sloan, Think it is Invalid? A New Defense\nto Negate Intent for Induced Infringement, 23 Fed. Cir.\nB. J. 613, 618 (2013). And since “it is often more difficult\nto determine whether a patent is valid than whether it has\nbeen infringed,” Cardinal, 508 U. S., at 99, accused induc-\ners would likely find it easier to prevail on a defense re-\ngarding the belief of invalidity than noninfringement. In\naddition the need to respond to the defense will increase\ndiscovery costs and multiply the issues the jury must\nresolve. Indeed, the jury would be put to the difficult task\nof separating the defendant’s belief regarding validity\nfrom the actual issue of validity.\n   As a final note, “[o]ur law is . . . no stranger to the possi-\nbility that an act may be ‘intentional’ for purposes of civil\nliability, even if the actor lacked actual knowledge that\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nher conduct violated the law.” Jerman v. Carlisle, McNel-\nlie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., 559 U. S. 573, 582–\n583 (2010). Tortious interference with a contract provides\nan apt example. While the invalidity of a contract is a\ndefense to tortious interference, belief in validity is irrele-\nvant. Restatement (Second) of Torts §766, Comment i\n(1979). See also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.\nOwen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 110 (5th ed.\n1984). In a similar way, a trespass “can be committed\ndespite the actor’s mistaken belief that she has a legal\nright to enter the property.” Jerman, supra, at 583 (citing\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §164, and Comment e\n(1963–1964)). And of course, “[t]he general rule that\nignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to\ncriminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the American\nlegal system.” Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 199\n(1991). In the usual case, “I thought it was legal” is no\ndefense. That concept mirrors this Court’s holding that\nbelief in invalidity will not negate the scienter required\nunder §271(b).\n                             III\n   The Court is well aware that an “industry has developed\nin which firms use patents not as a basis for producing\nand selling goods but, instead, primarily for obtaining\nlicensing fees.” eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547\nU. S. 388, 396 (2006) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Some\ncompanies may use patents as a sword to go after defend-\nants for money, even when their claims are frivolous. This\ntactic is often pursued through demand letters, which\n“may be sent very broadly and without prior investigation,\nmay assert vague claims of infringement, and may be\ndesigned to obtain payments that are based more on the\ncosts of defending litigation than on the merit of the pa-\ntent claims.” L. Greisman, Prepared Statement of the\nFederal Trade Commission on Discussion Draft of Patent\n14        COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDemand Letter Legislation before the Subcommittee on\nCommerce, Manufacturing, and Trade of the House Com-\nmittee on Energy and Commerce 2 (2014). This behavior\ncan impose a “harmful tax on innovation.” Ibid.\n  No issue of frivolity has been raised by the parties in\nthis case, nor does it arise on the facts presented to this\nCourt. Nonetheless, it is still necessary and proper to\nstress that district courts have the authority and respon-\nsibility to ensure frivolous cases are dissuaded. If frivo-\nlous cases are filed in federal court, it is within the power\nof the court to sanction attorneys for bringing such suits.\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11. It is also within the district\ncourt’s discretion to award attorney’s fees to prevailing\nparties in “exceptional cases.” 35 U. S. C. §285; see also\nOctane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572\nU. S. ___, ___–___ (2014) (slip op., at 7–8). These safe-\nguards, combined with the avenues that accused inducers\nhave to obtain rulings on the validity of patents, militate\nin favor of maintaining the separation expressed through-\nout the Patent Act between infringement and validity.\nThis dichotomy means that belief in invalidity is no de-\nfense to a claim of induced infringement.\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

S. C. §271(b) does not “requir[e]\nknowledge of the infringing nature of the induced acts.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9; see also Brief\nfor Petitioner 15–44. I disagree, however, with the Court’s\nholding that good-faith belief in a patent’s invalidity is not\na defense to induced infringement.\n   Infringing a patent means invading a patentee’s exclu-\nsive right to practice his claimed invention. Crown Die &\nTool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine Works, 261 U. S. 24, 40\n(1923) (quoting 3 W. Robinson, Law of Patents §937, pp.\n122–123 (1890)). Only valid patents confer this right to\nexclusivity—invalid patents do not. FTC v. Actavis, Inc.,\n570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8). It follows, as\nnight the day, that only valid patents can be infringed. To\ntalk of infringing an invalid patent is to talk nonsense.\n   Induced infringement, we have said, “requires\nknowledge that the induced acts constitute patent in-\nfringement.” Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A.,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10). Because only\nvalid patents can be infringed, anyone with a good-faith\nbelief in a patent’s invalidity necessarily believes the\n2         COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npatent cannot be infringed. And it is impossible for any-\none who believes that a patent cannot be infringed to\ninduce actions that he knows will infringe it. A good-faith\nbelief that a patent is invalid is therefore a defense to\ninduced infringement of that patent.\n   The Court makes four arguments in support of the\ncontrary position. None seems to me persuasive. First, it\nnotes that the Patent Act treats infringement and validity\nas distinct issues. Ante, at 9–10. That is true. It is also\nirrelevant. Saying that infringement cannot exist without\na valid patent does not “conflate the issues of infringement\nand validity,” ante, at 10, any more than saying that water\ncannot exist without oxygen “conflates” water and oxygen.\nRecognizing that infringement requires validity is entirely\nconsistent with the “long-accepted truth . . . that infringe-\nment and invalidity are separate matters under patent\nlaw.” Ibid.\n   The Court next insists that permitting the defense at\nissue would undermine the statutory presumption of\nvalidity. Ante, at 10–11. It would do no such thing. By\nreason of the statutory presumption of validity, §282(a),\npatents can be held invalid only by “clear and convincing\nevidence.” Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 1). This presumption is\nnot weakened by treating a good-faith belief in invalidity\nas a defense to induced infringement. An alleged inducer\nwho succeeds in this defense does not thereby call a pa-\ntent’s validity into question. He merely avoids liability for\na third party’s infringement of a valid patent, in no way\nundermining that patent’s presumed validity.\n   Next, the Court says that “invalidity is not a defense to\ninfringement, it is a defense to liability.” Ante, at 11.\nThat is an assertion, not an argument. Again, to infringe\na patent is to invade the patentee’s right of exclusivity.\nAn invalid patent confers no such right. How is it possible\nto interfere with rights that do not exist? The Court has\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nno answer.\n   That brings me to the Court’s weakest argument: that\nthere are “practical reasons not to create a defense based\non a good-faith belief in invalidity.” Ante, at 12 (emphasis\nadded); see also ibid. (“Creating a defense of belief in\ninvalidity, furthermore, would have negative consequences”\n(emphasis added)). Ours is not a common-law court.\nErie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78 (1938). We do\nnot, or at least should not, create defenses to statutory\nliability—and that is not what this dissent purports to do.\nOur task is to interpret the Patent Act, and to decide\nwhether it makes a good-faith belief in a patent’s invalid-\nity a defense to induced infringement. Since, as we said in\nGlobal-Tech, supra, the Act makes knowledge of infringe-\nment a requirement for induced-infringement liability;\nand since there can be no infringement (and hence no\nknowledge of infringement) of an invalid patent; good-\nfaith belief in invalidity is a defense. I may add, however,\nthat if the desirability of the rule we adopt were a proper\nconsideration, it is by no means clear that the Court’s\nholding, which increases the in terrorem power of patent\ntrolls, is preferable. The Court seemingly acknowledges\nthat consequence in Part III of its opinion.\n   For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 2803251, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/05/26/commil_usa_llc_v._cisco_systems_inc..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 31, 2015—Decided May 26, 2015\nPetitioner Commil USA, LLC, holder of a patent for a method of im-\n  plementing short-range wireless networks, filed suit, claiming that\n  respondent Cisco Systems, Inc., a maker and seller of wireless net-\n  working equipment, had directly infringed Commil’s patent in its\n  networking equipment and had induced others to infringe the patent\n  by selling the infringing equipment for them to use. After two trials,\n  Cisco was found liable for both direct and induced infringement.\n  With regard to inducement, Cisco had raised the defense that it had a\n  good-faith belief that Commil’s patent was invalid, but the District\n  Court found Cisco’s supporting evidence inadmissible. The Federal\n  Circuit affirmed the District Court’s judgment in part, vacated in\n  part, and remanded, holding, as relevant here, that the trial court\n  erred in excluding Cisco’s evidence of its good-faith belief that Com-\n  mil’s patent was invalid.\nHeld: A defendant’s belief regarding patent validity is not a defense to\n an induced infringement claim. Pp. 5–14.\n    (a) While this case centers on inducement liability, 35 U. S.

Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S.\n 476, 488 (Aro II).

S., at ___, relying on the reasoning of Aro II, a contrib-\n    utory infringement case, because the mental state imposed in each\n    instance is similar. Contrary to the claim of Commil and the Gov-\n    ernment as amicus, it was not only knowledge of the existence of re-\n    spondent’s patent that led the Court to affirm the liability finding in\n    Global-Tech, but also the fact that petitioner’s actions demonstrated\n    that it knew it would be causing customers to infringe respondent’s\n    patent. 563 U. S., at ___. Qualifying or limiting that holding could\n    make a person, or entity, liable for induced or contributory infringe-\n    ment even though he did not know the acts were infringing. Global-\n    Tech requires more, namely proof the defendant knew the acts were\n    infringing. And that opinion was clear in rejecting any lesser mental\n    state as the standard. Id., at ___. Pp. 6–9.\n       (c) Because induced infringement and validity are separate issues\n    and have separate defenses under the Act, belief regarding validity\n    cannot negate §271(b)’s scienter requirement of “actively induce[d]\n    infringement,” i.e., the intent to “bring about the desired result” of in-\n    fringement, 563 U. S., at ___. When infringement is the issue, the\n    patent’s validity is not the question to be confronted. See Cardinal\n    Chemical Co. v. Morton Int’l, Inc., 508 U. S. 83. Otherwise, the long\n    held presumption that a patent is valid, §282(a), would be under-\n    mined, permitting circumvention of the high bar—the clear and con-\n    vincing standard—that defendants must surmount to rebut the pre-\n    sumption. See Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U. S. ___,\n    ___–___. To be sure, if a patent is shown to be invalid, there is no pa-\n    tent to be infringed. But the orderly administration of the patent\n    system requires courts to interpret and implement the statutory\n    framework to determine the procedures and sequences that the par-\n    ties must follow to prove the act of wrongful inducement and any re-\n    lated issues of patent validity.\n       There are practical reasons not to create a defense of belief in inva-\n    lidity for induced infringement. Accused inducers who believe a pa-\n    tent is invalid have other, proper ways to obtain a ruling to that ef-\n    fect, including, e.g., seeking ex parte reexamination of the patent by\n    the Patent and Trademark Office, something Cisco did here.

The particular claims of Commil’s patent\nare discussed in the opinion of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit. 720 F. 3d 1361, 1364–\n1365, 1372 (2013).\n  Commil brought this action against Cisco Systems, Inc.,\nwhich makes and sells wireless networking equipment. In\n2007, Commil sued Cisco in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas. Cisco is the re-\nspondent here. Commil alleged that Cisco had infringed\nCommil’s patent by making and using networking equip-\nment. In addition Commil alleged that Cisco had induced\nothers to infringe the patent by selling the infringing\nequipment for them to use, in contravention of Commil’s\nexclusive patent rights.\n  At the first trial, the jury concluded that Commil’s\npatent was valid and that Cisco had directly infringed.\nThe jury awarded Commil $3.7 million in damages. As to\ninduced infringement, the jury found Cisco not liable.\nCommil filed a motion for a new trial on induced infringe-\nment and damages, which the District Court granted\nbecause of certain inappropriate comments Cisco’s counsel\nhad made during the first trial.\n  A month before the second trial Cisco went to the United\nStates Patent and Trademark Office and asked it to re-\nexamine the validity of Commil’s patent. The Office\ngranted the request; but, undoubtedly to Cisco’s disap-\npointment, it confirmed the validity of Commil’s patent.\nApp. 159, 162.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Back in the District Court, the second trial proceeded,\nlimited to the issues of inducement and damages on that\nissue and direct infringement. As a defense to the claim of\ninducement, Cisco argued it had a good-faith belief that\nCommil’s patent was invalid. It sought to introduce evi-\ndence to support that assertion. The District Court, how-\never, ruled that Cisco’s proffered evidence of its good-faith\nbelief in the patent’s invalidity was inadmissible. While\nthe District Court’s order does not provide the reason for\nthe ruling, it seems the court excluded this evidence on the\nassumption that belief in invalidity is not a defense to a\nplaintiff ’s claim that the defendant induced others to\ninfringe.\n   At the close of trial, and over Cisco’s objection, the Dis-\ntrict Court instructed the jury that it could find induce-\nment if “Cisco actually intended to cause the acts that\nconstitute . . . direct infringement and that Cisco knew or\nshould have known that its actions would induce actual\ninfringement.” Id., at 21. The jury returned a verdict for\nCommil on induced infringement and awarded $63.7\nmillion in damages.\n   After the verdict, but before judgment, this Court issued\nits decision in Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A.,\n563 U. S. ___ (2011). That case, as will be discussed in\nmore detail, held that, in an action for induced infringe-\nment, it is necessary for the plaintiff to show that the\nalleged inducer knew of the patent in question and knew\nthe induced acts were infringing. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10). Relying on that case, Cisco again urged that the\njury instruction was incorrect because it did not state\nknowledge as the governing standard for inducement\nliability. The District Court denied Cisco’s motion and\nentered judgment in Commil’s favor.\n   Cisco appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals affirmed in\npart, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceed-\n4         COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nings. The court concluded it was error for the District\nCourt to have instructed the jury that Cisco could be liable\nfor induced infringement if it “ ‘knew or should have\nknown’ ” that its customers infringed. 720 F. 3d, at 1366.\nThe panel held that “induced infringement ‘requires\nknowledge that the induced acts constitute patent in-\nfringement.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Global-Tech, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 10)). By stating that Cisco could be found\nliable if it “ ‘knew or should have known that its actions\nwould induce actual infringement,’ ” the Court of Appeals\nexplained, the District Court had allowed “the jury to find\n[Cisco] liable based on mere negligence where knowledge\nis required.” 720 F. 3d, at 1366. That ruling, which re-\nquires a new trial on the inducement claim with a corrected\ninstruction on knowledge, is not in question here.\n   What is at issue is the second holding of the Court of\nAppeals, addressing Cisco’s contention that the trial court\ncommitted further error in excluding Cisco’s evidence that\nit had a good-faith belief that Commil’s patent was in-\nvalid. Beginning with the observation that it is “axiomatic\nthat one cannot infringe an invalid patent,” the Court of\nAppeals reasoned that “evidence of an accused inducer’s\ngood-faith belief of invalidity may negate the requisite\nintent for induced infringement.” Id., at 1368. The court\nsaw “no principled distinction between a good-faith belief\nof invalidity and a good-faith belief of non-infringement for\nthe purpose of whether a defendant possessed the specific\nintent to induce infringement of a patent.” Ibid.\n   Judge Newman dissented on that point. In Judge\nNewman’s view a defendant’s good-faith belief in a pa-\ntent’s invalidity is not a defense to induced infringement.\nShe reasoned that “whether there is infringement in fact\ndoes not depend on the belief of the accused infringer that\nit might succeed in invalidating the patent.” Id., at 1374\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Both\nparties filed petitions for rehearing en banc, which were\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndenied. 737 F. 3d 699, 700 (2013). Five judges, however,\nwould have granted rehearing en banc to consider the\nquestion whether a good-faith belief in invalidity is a\ndefense to induced infringement. Id., at 700 (Reyna, J.,\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n  This Court granted certiorari to decide that question.\n574 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                              II\n  Although the precise issue to be addressed concerns a\nclaim of improper inducement to infringe, the discussion\nto follow refers as well to direct infringement and contrib-\nutory infringement, so it is instructive at the outset to set\nforth the statutory provisions pertaining to these three\nforms of liability. These three relevant provisions are\nfound in §271 of the Patent Act. 35 U. S. C. §271.\n  Subsection (a) governs direct infringement and provides:\n      “Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever\n    without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells\n    any patented invention, within the United States or\n    imports into the United States any patented invention\n    during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the\n    patent.”\nUnder this form of liability, a defendant’s mental state is\nirrelevant. Direct infringement is a strict-liability offense.\nGlobal-Tech, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5, n. 2).\n   Subsection (b) governs induced infringement:\n      “Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent\n    shall be liable as an infringer.”\nIn contrast to direct infringement, liability for inducing\ninfringement attaches only if the defendant knew of the\npatent and that “the induced acts constitute patent in-\nfringement.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). In Commil and\nthe Government’s view, not only is knowledge or belief in\n6         COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe patent’s validity irrelevant, they further argue the\nparty charged with inducing infringement need not know\nthat the acts it induced would infringe. On this latter\npoint, they are incorrect, as will be explained below.\n  Subsection (c) deals with contributory infringement:\n       “Whoever offers to sell or sells within the United\n    States or imports into the United States a component\n    of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or\n    composition, or a material or apparatus for use in\n    practicing a patented process, constituting a material\n    part of the invention, knowing the same to be espe-\n    cially made or especially adapted for use in an in-\n    fringement of such patent, and not a staple article or\n    commodity of commerce suitable for substantial non-\n    infringing use, shall be liable as a contributory\n    infringer.”\nLike induced infringement, contributory infringement\nrequires knowledge of the patent in suit and knowledge of\npatent infringement. Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top\nReplacement Co., 377 U. S. 476, 488 (1964) (Aro II).\n  This case asks a question of first impression: whether\nknowledge of, or belief in, a patent’s validity is required\nfor induced infringement under §271(b).\n                             A\n   Before turning to the question presented, it is necessary\nto reaffirm what the Court held in Global-Tech. Commil\nand the Government (which supports Commil in this case)\nargue that Global-Tech should be read as holding that\nonly knowledge of the patent is required for induced in-\nfringement. That, as will be explained, would contravene\nGlobal-Tech’s explicit holding that liability for induced\ninfringement can only attach if the defendant knew of the\npatent and knew as well that “the induced acts constitute\npatent infringement.” 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In Global-Tech, the plaintiff, SEB, had invented and\npatented a deep fryer. A few years later, Sunbeam asked\nPentalpha to supply deep fryers for Sunbeam to sell. To\nmake the deep fryer, Pentalpha bought an SEB fryer and\ncopied all but the cosmetic features. Pentalpha then sold\nthe fryers to Sunbeam, which in turn sold them to custom-\ners. SEB sued Pentalpha for induced infringement, argu-\ning Pentalpha had induced Sunbeam and others to sell the\ninfringing fryers in violation of SEB’s patent rights. In\ndefense, Pentalpha argued it did not know the deep fryer\nit copied was patented and therefore could not be liable for\ninducing anyone to infringe SEB’s patent. The question\npresented to this Court was “whether a party who ‘actively\ninduces infringement of a patent’ under 35 U. S. C. §271(b)\nmust know that the induced acts constitute patent in-\nfringement.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).\n   After noting the language of §271(b) and the case law\nprior to passage of the Patent Act did not resolve the\nquestion, the Global-Tech Court turned to Aro II, a case\nabout contributory infringement. The Global-Tech Court\ndeemed that rules concerning contributory infringement\nwere relevant to induced infringement, because the men-\ntal state imposed in each instance is similar. Before the\nPatent Act, inducing infringement was not a separate\ntheory of indirect liability but was evidence of contributory\ninfringement. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). Thus, in\nmany respects, it is proper to find common ground in the\ntwo theories of liability.\n   Aro II concluded that to be liable for contributory in-\nfringement, a defendant must know the acts were infring-\ning. 377 U. S., at 488. In Global-Tech, the Court said this\nreasoning was applicable, explaining as follows:\n      “Based on this premise, it follows that the same\n    knowledge is needed for induced infringement under\n    §271(b). As noted, the two provisions have a common\n8         COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    origin in the pre-1952 understanding of contributory\n    infringement, and the language of the two provisions\n    creates the same difficult interpretive choice. It\n    would thus be strange to hold that knowledge of the\n    relevant patent is needed under §271(c) but not under\n    §271(b).\n      “Accordingly, we now hold that induced infringe-\n    ment under §271(b) requires knowledge that the in-\n    duced acts constitute patent infringement.” 563 U. S.,\n    at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n  In support of Commil, the Government argues against\nthe clear language of Global-Tech. According to the Gov-\nernment, all Global-Tech requires is knowledge of the\npatent: “The Court did not definitively resolve whether\nSection 271(b) additionally requires knowledge of the\ninfringing nature of the induced acts.” Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 9. See also Brief for Petitioner\n17. Together, Commil and the Government claim the\n“factual circumstances” of Global-Tech “did not require”\nthe Court to decide whether knowledge of infringement is\nrequired for inducement liability. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12. See also Brief for Petitioner 23–24.\nBut in the Court’s Global-Tech decision, its description of\nthe factual circumstances suggests otherwise. The Court\nconcluded there was enough evidence to support a finding\nthat Pentalpha knew “the infringing nature of the sales it\nencouraged Sunbeam to make.” 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14). It was not only knowledge of the existence of SEB’s\npatent that led the Court to affirm the liability finding but\nalso it was the fact that Pentalpha copied “all but the\ncosmetic features of SEB’s fryer,” demonstrating Pental-\npha knew it would be causing customers to infringe SEB’s\npatent. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\n  Accepting the Government and Commil’s argument\nwould require this Court to depart from its prior holding.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). See also id., at ___\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1) (“The Court is\ncorrect, in my view, to conclude that . . . to induce in-\nfringement a defendant must know the acts constitute\npatent infringement” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nAnd the Global-Tech rationale is sound. Qualifying or\nlimiting its holding, as the Government and Commil seek\nto do, would lead to the conclusion, both in inducement\nand contributory infringement cases, that a person, or\nentity, could be liable even though he did not know the\nacts were infringing. In other words, even if the defendant\nreads the patent’s claims differently from the plaintiff, and\nthat reading is reasonable, he would still be liable because\nhe knew the acts might infringe. Global-Tech requires\nmore. It requires proof the defendant knew the acts were\ninfringing. And the Court’s opinion was clear in rejecting\nany lesser mental state as the standard. Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 13–14).\n                              B\n  The question the Court confronts today concerns whether\na defendant’s belief regarding patent validity is a defense\nto a claim of induced infringement. It is not. The scienter\nelement for induced infringement concerns infringement;\nthat is a different issue than validity. Section 271(b)\nrequires that the defendant “actively induce[d] infringe-\nment.” That language requires intent to “bring about the\ndesired result,” which is infringement. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 4). And because infringement and validity are separate\nissues under the Act, belief regarding validity cannot\nnegate the scienter required under §271(b).\n  When infringement is the issue, the validity of the\npatent is not the question to be confronted. In Cardinal\nChemical Co. v. Morton Int’l, Inc., 508 U. S. 83 (1993), the\nCourt explained, “A party seeking a declaratory judgment\nof invalidity presents a claim independent of the patent-\n10        COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nee’s charge of infringement.” Id., at 96. It further held\nnoninfringement and invalidity were “alternative grounds”\nfor dismissing the suit. Id., at 98. And in Deposit Guaranty\nNat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326 (1980), the Court\nexplained that an accused infringer “may prevail either by\nsuccessfully attacking the validity of the patent or by\nsuccessfully defending the charge of infringement.” Id., at\n334. These explanations are in accord with the long-\naccepted truth—perhaps the axiom—that infringement\nand invalidity are separate matters under patent law. See\nPandrol USA, LP v. Airboss R. Prods., Inc., 320 F. 3d\n1354, 1365 (CA Fed. 2003).\n   Indeed, the issues of infringement and validity appear\nin separate parts of the Patent Act. Part III of the Act\ndeals with “Patents and Protection of Patent Rights,”\nincluding the right to be free from infringement. §§251–\n329. Part II, entitled “Patentability of Inventions and\nGrants of Patents,” defines what constitutes a valid pa-\ntent. §§100–212. Further, noninfringement and invalidity\nare listed as two separate defenses, see §§282(b)(1), (2),\nand defendants are free to raise either or both of them.\nSee Cardinal, supra, at 98. Were this Court to interpret\n§271(b) as permitting a defense of belief in invalidity, it\nwould conflate the issues of infringement and validity.\n   Allowing this new defense would also undermine a\npresumption that is a “common core of thought and truth”\nreflected in this Court’s precedents for a century. Radio\nCorp. of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc.,\n293 U. S. 1, 8 (1934). Under the Patent Act, and the case\nlaw before its passage, a patent is “presumed valid.”\n§282(a); id., at 8. That presumption takes away any need\nfor a plaintiff to prove his patent is valid to bring a claim.\nBut if belief in invalidity were a defense to induced in-\nfringement, the force of that presumption would be less-\nened to a drastic degree, for a defendant could prevail if he\nproved he reasonably believed the patent was invalid.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThat would circumvent the high bar Congress is presumed\nto have chosen: the clear and convincing standard. See\nMicrosoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U. S. ___, ___–\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 8–10). Defendants must meet that\nstandard to rebut the presumption of validity. Ibid.\n   To say that an invalid patent cannot be infringed, or\nthat someone cannot be induced to infringe an invalid\npatent, is in one sense a simple truth, both as a matter of\nlogic and semantics. See M. Swift & Sons, Inc. v. W. H.\nCoe Mfg. Co., 102 F. 2d 391, 396 (CA1 1939). But the\nquestions courts must address when interpreting and\nimplementing the statutory framework require a determi-\nnation of the procedures and sequences that the parties\nmust follow to prove the act of wrongful inducement and\nany related issues of patent validity. “Validity and in-\nfringement are distinct issues, bearing different burdens,\ndifferent presumptions, and different evidence.”           720\nF. 3d, at 1374 (opinion of Newman, J.). To be sure, if at\nthe end of the day, an act that would have been an in-\nfringement or an inducement to infringe pertains to a\npatent that is shown to be invalid, there is no patent to be\ninfringed. But the allocation of the burden to persuade on\nthese questions, and the timing for the presentations of\nthe relevant arguments, are concerns of central relevance\nto the orderly administration of the patent system.\n   Invalidity is an affirmative defense that “can preclude\nenforcement of a patent against otherwise infringing\nconduct.” 6A Chisum on Patents §19.01, p. 19–5 (2015).\nAn accused infringer can, of course, attempt to prove that\nthe patent in suit is invalid; if the patent is indeed invalid,\nand shown to be so under proper procedures, there is no\nliability. See i4i, supra, at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–12).\nThat is because invalidity is not a defense to infringement,\nit is a defense to liability. And because of that fact, a\nbelief as to invalidity cannot negate the scienter required\nfor induced infringement.\n12        COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   There are also practical reasons not to create a defense\nbased on a good-faith belief in invalidity. First and fore-\nmost, accused inducers who believe a patent is invalid\nhave various proper ways to obtain a ruling to that effect.\nThey can file a declaratory judgment action asking a\nfederal court to declare the patent invalid. See MedIm-\nmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 137 (2007).\nThey can seek inter partes review at the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board and receive a decision as to validity within\n12 to 18 months. See §316. Or they can, as Cisco did\nhere, seek ex parte reexamination of the patent by the\nPatent and Trademark Office. §302. And, of course, any\naccused infringer who believes the patent in suit is invalid\nmay raise the affirmative defense of invalidity. §282(b)(2).\nIf the defendant is successful, he will be immune from\nliability.\n   Creating a defense of belief in invalidity, furthermore,\nwould have negative consequences. It can render litiga-\ntion more burdensome for everyone involved. Every ac-\ncused inducer would have an incentive to put forth a\ntheory of invalidity and could likely come up with myriad\narguments. See Sloan, Think it is Invalid? A New Defense\nto Negate Intent for Induced Infringement, 23 Fed. Cir.\nB. J. 613, 618 (2013). And since “it is often more difficult\nto determine whether a patent is valid than whether it has\nbeen infringed,” Cardinal, 508 U. S., at 99, accused induc-\ners would likely find it easier to prevail on a defense re-\ngarding the belief of invalidity than noninfringement. In\naddition the need to respond to the defense will increase\ndiscovery costs and multiply the issues the jury must\nresolve. Indeed, the jury would be put to the difficult task\nof separating the defendant’s belief regarding validity\nfrom the actual issue of validity.\n   As a final note, “[o]ur law is . . . no stranger to the possi-\nbility that an act may be ‘intentional’ for purposes of civil\nliability, even if the actor lacked actual knowledge that\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nher conduct violated the law.” Jerman v. Carlisle, McNel-\nlie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., 559 U. S. 573, 582–\n583 (2010). Tortious interference with a contract provides\nan apt example. While the invalidity of a contract is a\ndefense to tortious interference, belief in validity is irrele-\nvant. Restatement (Second) of Torts §766, Comment i\n(1979). See also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.\nOwen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 110 (5th ed.\n1984). In a similar way, a trespass “can be committed\ndespite the actor’s mistaken belief that she has a legal\nright to enter the property.” Jerman, supra, at 583 (citing\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §164, and Comment e\n(1963–1964)). And of course, “[t]he general rule that\nignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to\ncriminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the American\nlegal system.” Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 199\n(1991). In the usual case, “I thought it was legal” is no\ndefense. That concept mirrors this Court’s holding that\nbelief in invalidity will not negate the scienter required\nunder §271(b).\n                             III\n   The Court is well aware that an “industry has developed\nin which firms use patents not as a basis for producing\nand selling goods but, instead, primarily for obtaining\nlicensing fees.” eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547\nU. S. 388, 396 (2006) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Some\ncompanies may use patents as a sword to go after defend-\nants for money, even when their claims are frivolous. This\ntactic is often pursued through demand letters, which\n“may be sent very broadly and without prior investigation,\nmay assert vague claims of infringement, and may be\ndesigned to obtain payments that are based more on the\ncosts of defending litigation than on the merit of the pa-\ntent claims.” L. Greisman, Prepared Statement of the\nFederal Trade Commission on Discussion Draft of Patent\n14        COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDemand Letter Legislation before the Subcommittee on\nCommerce, Manufacturing, and Trade of the House Com-\nmittee on Energy and Commerce 2 (2014). This behavior\ncan impose a “harmful tax on innovation.” Ibid.\n  No issue of frivolity has been raised by the parties in\nthis case, nor does it arise on the facts presented to this\nCourt. Nonetheless, it is still necessary and proper to\nstress that district courts have the authority and respon-\nsibility to ensure frivolous cases are dissuaded. If frivo-\nlous cases are filed in federal court, it is within the power\nof the court to sanction attorneys for bringing such suits.\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11. It is also within the district\ncourt’s discretion to award attorney’s fees to prevailing\nparties in “exceptional cases.” 35 U. S. C. §285; see also\nOctane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572\nU. S. ___, ___–___ (2014) (slip op., at 7–8). These safe-\nguards, combined with the avenues that accused inducers\nhave to obtain rulings on the validity of patents, militate\nin favor of maintaining the separation expressed through-\nout the Patent Act between infringement and validity.\nThis dichotomy means that belief in invalidity is no de-\nfense to a claim of induced infringement.\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

S. C. §271(b) does not “requir[e]\nknowledge of the infringing nature of the induced acts.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9; see also Brief\nfor Petitioner 15–44. I disagree, however, with the Court’s\nholding that good-faith belief in a patent’s invalidity is not\na defense to induced infringement.\n   Infringing a patent means invading a patentee’s exclu-\nsive right to practice his claimed invention. Crown Die &\nTool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine Works, 261 U. S. 24, 40\n(1923) (quoting 3 W. Robinson, Law of Patents §937, pp.\n122–123 (1890)). Only valid patents confer this right to\nexclusivity—invalid patents do not. FTC v. Actavis, Inc.,\n570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8). It follows, as\nnight the day, that only valid patents can be infringed. To\ntalk of infringing an invalid patent is to talk nonsense.\n   Induced infringement, we have said, “requires\nknowledge that the induced acts constitute patent in-\nfringement.” Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A.,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10). Because only\nvalid patents can be infringed, anyone with a good-faith\nbelief in a patent’s invalidity necessarily believes the\n2         COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npatent cannot be infringed. And it is impossible for any-\none who believes that a patent cannot be infringed to\ninduce actions that he knows will infringe it. A good-faith\nbelief that a patent is invalid is therefore a defense to\ninduced infringement of that patent.\n   The Court makes four arguments in support of the\ncontrary position. None seems to me persuasive. First, it\nnotes that the Patent Act treats infringement and validity\nas distinct issues. Ante, at 9–10. That is true. It is also\nirrelevant. Saying that infringement cannot exist without\na valid patent does not “conflate the issues of infringement\nand validity,” ante, at 10, any more than saying that water\ncannot exist without oxygen “conflates” water and oxygen.\nRecognizing that infringement requires validity is entirely\nconsistent with the “long-accepted truth . . . that infringe-\nment and invalidity are separate matters under patent\nlaw.” Ibid.\n   The Court next insists that permitting the defense at\nissue would undermine the statutory presumption of\nvalidity. Ante, at 10–11. It would do no such thing. By\nreason of the statutory presumption of validity, §282(a),\npatents can be held invalid only by “clear and convincing\nevidence.” Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 1). This presumption is\nnot weakened by treating a good-faith belief in invalidity\nas a defense to induced infringement. An alleged inducer\nwho succeeds in this defense does not thereby call a pa-\ntent’s validity into question. He merely avoids liability for\na third party’s infringement of a valid patent, in no way\nundermining that patent’s presumed validity.\n   Next, the Court says that “invalidity is not a defense to\ninfringement, it is a defense to liability.” Ante, at 11.\nThat is an assertion, not an argument. Again, to infringe\na patent is to invade the patentee’s right of exclusivity.\nAn invalid patent confers no such right. How is it possible\nto interfere with rights that do not exist? The Court has\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nno answer.\n   That brings me to the Court’s weakest argument: that\nthere are “practical reasons not to create a defense based\non a good-faith belief in invalidity.” Ante, at 12 (emphasis\nadded); see also ibid. (“Creating a defense of belief in\ninvalidity, furthermore, would have negative consequences”\n(emphasis added)). Ours is not a common-law court.\nErie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78 (1938). We do\nnot, or at least should not, create defenses to statutory\nliability—and that is not what this dissent purports to do.\nOur task is to interpret the Patent Act, and to decide\nwhether it makes a good-faith belief in a patent’s invalid-\nity a defense to induced infringement. Since, as we said in\nGlobal-Tech, supra, the Act makes knowledge of infringe-\nment a requirement for induced-infringement liability;\nand since there can be no infringement (and hence no\nknowledge of infringement) of an invalid patent; good-\nfaith belief in invalidity is a defense. I may add, however,\nthat if the desirability of the rule we adopt were a proper\nconsideration, it is by no means clear that the Court’s\nholding, which increases the in terrorem power of patent\ntrolls, is preferable. The Court seemingly acknowledges\nthat consequence in Part III of its opinion.\n   For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2803251/", "sha1": "cbc6189926f4092bccd8b81bfcac18684116ae13", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-05-26T08:03:12.406951"}
