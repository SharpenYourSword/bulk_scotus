CITY AND COUNTY\n\n    OF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, ET AL. \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 14–704.   Decided June 8, 2015\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins,\ndissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n   “Self-defense is a basic right” and “the central compo-\nnent” of the Second Amendment’s guarantee of an individ-\nual’s right to keep and bear arms. McDonald v. Chicago,\n561 U. S. 742, 767 (2010) (emphasis deleted). Less than a\ndecade ago, we explained that an ordinance requiring\nfirearms in the home to be kept inoperable, without an\nexception for self-defense, conflicted with the Second\nAmendment because it “ma[de] it impossible for citizens to\nuse [their firearms] for the core lawful purpose of self-\ndefense.” District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570,\n630 (2008). Despite the clarity with which we described\nthe Second Amendment’s core protection for the right of\nself-defense, lower courts, including the ones here, have\nfailed to protect it. Because Second Amendment rights are\nno less protected by our Constitution than other rights\nenumerated in that document, I would have granted this\npetition.\n                             I\n   Section 4512 of the San Francisco Police Code provides\nthat “[n]o person shall keep a handgun within a residence\nowned or controlled by that person unless” (1) “the hand-\ngun is stored in a locked container or disabled with a\ntrigger lock that has been approved by the California\nDepartment of Justice” or (2) “[t]he handgun is carried on\n2    JACKSON v.

The law applies across the board,\nregardless of whether children are present in the home. A\nviolation of the law is punishable by up to six months of\nimprisonment and/or a fine of up to $1,000. §4512(e).\n   Petitioners—six San Francisco residents who keep\nhandguns in their homes, as well as two organizations—\nfiled suit to challenge this law under the Second Amend-\nment. According to petitioners, the law impermissibly\nrendered their handguns “[in]operable for the purpose of\nimmediate self-defense” in the home. Heller, supra, at\n635. Because it is impossible to “carry” a firearm on one’s\nperson while sleeping, for example, petitioners contended\nthat the law effectively denies them their right to self-\ndefense at times when their potential need for that de-\nfense is most acute. In support of that point, they cited a\nDepartment of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, sur-\nvey estimating that over 60 percent of all robberies of\noccupied dwellings between 2003 and 2007 occurred be-\ntween 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n   The District Court for the Northern District of Califor-\nnia denied them a preliminary injunction, and the U. S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The\nCourt of Appeals readily acknowledged that the law “bur-\ndens the core of the Second Amendment right” because\n“[h]aving to retrieve handguns from locked containers or\nremoving trigger locks makes it more difficult ‘for citizens\nto use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense’ in\nthe home.” 746 F. 3d 953, 964 (2014) (quoting Heller,\nsupra, at 630). But it reasoned that this was not a “severe\nburden” justifying the application of strict scrutiny be-\ncause “a modern gun safe may be opened quickly.” 746\nF. 3d, at 964. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court\nevaluated San Francisco’s proffered “evidence that guns\n                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nkept in the home are most often used in suicides and\nagainst family and friends rather than in self-defense and\nthat children are particularly at risk of injury and death.”\nId., at 965. The court concluded that the law served “a\nsignificant government interest by reducing the number of\ngun-related injuries and deaths from having an unlocked\nhandgun in the home” and was “substantially related” to\nthat interest. Id., at 966.\n                             II\n  The decision of the Court of Appeals is in serious tension\nwith Heller. We explained in Heller that the Second\nAmendment codified a right “ ‘inherited from our English\nancestors,’ ” a key component of which is the right to keep\nand bear arms for the lawful purpose of self-defense. 554\nU. S., at 599. We therefore rejected as inconsistent with\nthe Second Amendment a ban on possession of handguns\nin the home because “handguns are the most popular\nweapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home”\nand because a trigger-lock requirement prevented resi-\ndents from rendering their firearms “operable for the\npurpose of immediate self-defense.” Id., at 629, 635. San\nFrancisco’s law allows residents to use their handguns for\nthe purpose of self-defense, but it prohibits them from\nkeeping those handguns “operable for the purpose of im-\nmediate self-defense” when not carried on their person.\nThe law thus burdens their right to self-defense at the\ntimes they are most vulnerable—when they are sleeping,\nbathing, changing clothes, or otherwise indisposed. There\nis consequently no question that San Francisco’s law\nburdens the core of the Second Amendment right.\n  That burden is significant. One petitioner, an elderly\nwoman who lives alone, explained that she is currently\nforced to store her handgun in a lock box and that if an\nintruder broke into her home at night, she would need to\n“turn on the light, find [her] glasses, find the key to the\n4    JACKSON v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlockbox, insert the key in the lock and unlock the box\n(under the stress of the emergency), and then get [her]\ngun before being in position to defend [herself].” Declara-\ntion of Espanola Jackson in Support of Motion for Prelim-\ninary Injunction, Record in Case 3:09–cv–02143 (ND Cal.),\nDoc. 136–3, p. 2. As she is over 79 years old, that would\n“not [be] an easy task.” Ibid. Another petitioner stated\nthat she is forced to store her gun in a code-operated safe\nand, in the event of an emergency, would need to get to\nthat safe, remember her code under stress, and correctly\nenter it before she could retrieve her gun and be in a\nposition to defend herself. If she erroneously entered the\nnumber due to stress, the safe would impose a delay before\nshe could try again. A third petitioner explained that he\nwould face the same challenge and, in the event the bat-\ntery drains on his battery-operated safe, would need to\nlocate a backup key to access his handgun. In an emer-\ngency situation, the delay imposed by this law could pre-\nvent San Francisco residents from using their handguns\nfor the lawful purpose of self-defense. And that delay\ncould easily be the difference between life and death.\n   Since our decision in Heller, members of the Courts of\nAppeals have disagreed about whether and to what extent\nthe tiers-of-scrutiny analysis should apply to burdens on\nSecond Amendment rights. Compare Heller v. District of\nColumbia, 670 F. 3d 1244 (CADC 2011) (“We ask first\nwhether a particular provision impinges upon a right\nprotected by the Second Amendment; if it does, then we go\non to determine whether the provision passes muster\nunder the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny”),\nwith id., at 1271 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (“In my view,\nHeller and McDonald leave little doubt that courts are to\nassess gun bans and regulations based on text, history,\nand tradition, not by a balancing test such as strict or\nintermediate scrutiny”). One need not resolve that dispute\nto know that something was seriously amiss in the deci-\n                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsion below. In that decision, the Court of Appeals recog-\nnized that the law “burdens the core of the Second\nAmendment right,” yet concluded that, because the law’s\nburden was not as “severe” as the one at issue in Heller, it\nwas “not a substantial burden on the Second Amendment\nright itself.” 746 F. 3d, at 963–965. But nothing in our\ndecision in Heller suggested that a law must rise to the\nlevel of the absolute prohibition at issue in that case to\nconstitute a “substantial burden” on the core of the Second\nAmendment right. And when a law burdens a constitu-\ntionally protected right, we have generally required a\nhigher showing than the Court of Appeals demanded here.\nSee generally Heller, 554 U. S., at 628–635; Turner Broad-\ncasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 662 (1994)\n(explaining that even intermediate scrutiny requires that\na regulation not “burden substantially more speech than is\nnecessary to further the government’s legitimate inter-\nests” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The Court should have granted a writ of certiorari to\nreview this questionable decision and to reiterate that\ncourts may not engage in this sort of judicial assessment\nas to the severity of a burden imposed on core Second\nAmendment rights. See Heller, 554 U. S., at 634 (“The\nvery enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of\ngovernment—even the Third Branch of Government—the\npower to decide on a case-by-case basis what is really\nworth insisting upon”); id., at 635 (explaining that the\nSecond Amendment “elevates above all other interests the\nright of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in\ndefense of hearth and home”).\n   The Court’s refusal to review this decision is difficult to\naccount for in light of its repeated willingness to review\nsplitless decisions involving alleged violations of other\nconstitutional rights. See, e.g., Glossip v. Gross, 574 U. S.\n___ (2015) (cert. granted) (Eighth Amendment); Ontario v.\nQuon, 560 U. S. 746 (2010) (Fourth Amendment); Hill v.\n6    JACKSON v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nColorado, 530 U. S. 703 (2000) (First Amendment). In-\ndeed, the Court has been willing to review splitless deci-\nsions involving alleged violations of rights it has never\npreviously enforced. See, e.g., BMW of North America, Inc.\nv. Gore, 517 U. S. 559 (1996) (right to limit on punitive\ndamages awards). And it has even gone so far as to review\nsplitless decisions involving alleged violations of rights\nexpressly foreclosed by precedent. See, e.g., Boumediene v.\nBush, 553 U. S. 723 (2008) (right of aliens held outside\nU. S. territory to the privilege of habeas corpus); Lawrence\nv. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003) (right to engage in adult,\nconsensual same-sex intimate behavior). I see no reason\nthat challenges based on Second Amendment rights\nshould be treated differently.\n                       *     *     *\n  We warned in Heller that “[a] constitutional guarantee\nsubject to future judges’ assessments of its usefulness is\nno constitutional guarantee at all.” 554 U. S., at 634. The\nCourt of Appeals in this case recognized that San Francis-\nco’s law burdened the core component of the Second\nAmendment guarantee, yet upheld the law. Because of\nthe importance of the constitutional right at stake and the\nquestionable nature of the Court of Appeals’ judgment, I\nwould have granted a writ of certiorari.\n</pre>", "id": 2806207, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/06/08/jackson_v._city_and_county_of_san_francisco.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 576 U.
