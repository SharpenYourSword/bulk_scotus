This plain language explicitly strips the courts of appeals of the ability to hear petitioners' claims on direct review. However, because Congress has not spoken with sufficient clarity to strip the district courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions raising identical claims, see INS v.

In the alternative, they argue that we might construe the same provisions as stripping jurisdiction from the courts of appeals over only some matters, leaving in place their jurisdiction to directly review petitions raising claims previously cognizable under § 2241. <i>Id.,</i> at 42-44.</p>\n<p>We agree with petitioners that leaving aliens without a forum for adjudicating claims such as those raised in this case would raise serious constitutional questions. We also agree with petitionersand the Court of Appealsthat these concerns can best be alleviated by construing the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of that statute not to preclude aliens such as petitioners from pursuing habeas relief pursuant to § 2241. See <i>St. Cyr, ante,</i> at 314.</p>\n<p>Finding no support in the text or history of § 1252 for concluding that the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to hear petitions such as those brought in this case, but concluding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*352</span> that Congress has not spoken with sufficient clarity to strip the district courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions raising identical claims, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in all particulars.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i> </p>\n<p>Justice O'Connor, dissenting.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in the companion case of <i>INS</i> v. <i>St. Cyr, ante,</i> p. 326, I agree with Justice Scalia's proposed disposition of the instant case.</p>\n<p>Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in the companion case of <i>INS</i> v. <i>St. Cyr, ante,</i> p. 326, I would vacate the judgment of the court below and remand with instructions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, with prejudice to petitioners Calcano-Martinez's and Madrid's refiling in the District Court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   <i>Martha W. Barnett, Jeffrey L. Bleich, Gerald Neuman,</i> and <i>Kelly M. Klaus</i> filed a brief for the American Bar Association as <i>amicus curiae.</i> </p>\n<p>[1]  An additional difference between the old and the new statute with regard to petitions for review is one of nomenclature. In keeping with a statute-wide change in terminology, the new provision refers to orders of \"removal\" rather than orders of \"deportation\" or \"exclusion.\" Compare 8 U. S. C. § 1252(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V), with § 1105a (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p>[2]  The scope of this preclusion is not entirely clear. Though the text of the provision is quite broad, it is not without its ambiguities. Throughout this litigation, the Government has conceded that the courts of appeals have the power to hear petitions challenging the factual determinations thought to trigger the jurisdiction-stripping provision (such as whether an individual is an alien and whether he or she has been convicted of an \"aggravated felony\" within the meaning of the statute). See Brief for Respondent 22-23. In addition, the Government has also conceded that the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to review \"substantial constitutional challenges\" raised by aliens who come within the strictures of § 1252(a)(2)(C). See <i>id.,</i> at 23-24. As the petitions in this case do not raise any of these types of issues, we need not address this point further. Nonetheless, it remains instructive that the Government acknowledges that background principles of statutory construction and constitutional concerns must be considered in determining the scope of IIRIRA's jurisdiction-stripping provisions.</p>\n<p>[3]  All three petitioners were convicted of controlled substance offenses for which they served between four months and four years in prison. Each concedes that his or her crime is an \"aggravated felony\" as defined in 8 U. S. C. § 1101(a)(43), which renders him or her removable pursuant to § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 118453, "judges": "Stevens", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/118453/", "sha1": "a3fdc7dd01c715da31df4e410353b81c942bcbab", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": "2000-079", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:20:34"}
