He was sentenced to death on October 4, 1975. In 1981, five days before his scheduled execution, a Federal District Court issued a stay to permit consideration of his first federal habeas petition. This petition was temporarily successful. The Court of Appeals held that Foster's sentence was constitutionally defective because the trial court had failed to state required findings regarding mitigating factors. But four months later the court withdrew relief, saying that it had wrongly raised the question <i>sua sponte.

The courts again stayed the execution. From 1987 to 1992, the Florida courts twice vacated Foster's sentence because the trial court had failed properly to consider certain mitigating factors. New sentencing proceedings followed. Each time Foster was again sentenced to death. Foster's latest resentencing took place in 1993, 18 years after his initial sentence and 10 years after the Court of Appeals first found error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Foster now asks this Court to consider his claim that his execution, following these lengthy proceedings, would violate the Constitution's prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" JUSTICE STEVENS and I have previously argued that the Court should hear this kind of claim.

Snell, Capital Punishment 2000, p. 12 (Dec. 2001). A little over two years ago, there were only eight prisoners in the United States who had been under sentence of death for 24 years or more, and none who had been on death row for 27 years. <i>Id.,</i> at 13.
