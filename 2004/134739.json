The Court of Appeal held that petitioner was entitled to relief under <i>People</i> v. <i>Wheeler,</i> 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978), and <i>Batson</i> v. <i>Kentucky, supra.</i> 105 Cal.

It also noted petitioner's separate evidentiary and prosecutorial misconduct claims, App. 87, but did not determine whether those claims would independently support reversal of petitioner's conviction.
