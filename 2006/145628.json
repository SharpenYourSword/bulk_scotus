OREGON\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OREGON\n\n    No. 04–10566.       Argued March 29, 2006—Decided June 28, 2006*\nArticle 36(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations pro\n  vides that if a person detained by a foreign country “so requests, the\n  competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, in\n  form the consular post of the sending State” of such detention, and\n  “inform the [detainee] of his rights under this sub-paragraph.” Arti\n  cle 36(2) specifies: “The rights referred to in paragraph 1 . . . shall be\n  exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving\n  State, subject to the proviso . . . that the said laws . . . must enable\n  full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded\n  under this Article are intended.” Along with the Convention, the\n  United States ratified the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compul\n  sory Settlement of Disputes, which provides: “Disputes arising out of\n  the . . . Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the\n  International Court of Justice [(ICJ)].” The United States withdrew\n  from the Protocol on March 7, 2005.\n     Petitioner in No. 04–10566, Moises Sanchez-Llamas, is a Mexican\n  national. When he was arrested after an exchange of gunfire with\n  police, officers did not inform him that he could ask to have the Mexi\n  can Consulate notified of his detention. During interrogation, he\n  made incriminating statements regarding the shootout. Before his\n  trial for attempted murder and other offenses, Sanchez-Llamas\n  moved to suppress those statements on the ground, inter alia, that\n  the authorities had failed to comply with Article 36. The state court\n  denied that motion and Sanchez-Llamas was convicted and sentenced\n  to prison, and the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed.

Johnson, Director, Virginia\nDepartment of Corrections, on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Vir\nginia.\n2                    SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    preme Court also affirmed, concluding that Article 36 does not create\n    rights to consular access or notification that a detained individual\n    can enforce in a judicial proceeding.\n       Petitioner in No. 05–51, Mario Bustillo, a Honduran national, was\n    arrested and charged with murder, but police never informed him\n    that he could request that the Honduran Consulate be notified of his\n    detention. He was convicted and sentenced to prison, and his convic\n    tion and sentence were affirmed on appeal. He then filed a habeas\n    petition in state court arguing, for the first time, that authorities had\n    violated his right to consular notification under Article 36. The court\n    dismissed that claim as procedurally barred because he had failed to\n    raise it at trial or on appeal. The Virginia Supreme Court found no\n    reversible error.\nHeld: Even assuming without deciding that the Convention creates\n judicially enforceable rights, suppression is not an appropriate rem\n edy for a violation, and a State may apply its regular procedural de\n fault rules to Convention claims. Pp. 7–25.\n     (a) Because petitioners are not in any event entitled to relief, the\n Court need not resolve whether the Convention grants individuals\n enforceable rights, but assumes, without deciding, that Article 36\n does so. Pp. 7–8.\n     (b) Neither the Convention itself nor this Court’s precedents apply\n ing the exclusionary rule support suppression of a defendant’s state\n ments to police as a remedy for an Article 36 violation.\n     The Convention does not mandate suppression or any other specific\n remedy, but expressly leaves Article 36’s implementation to domestic\n law: Article 36 rights must “be exercised in conformity with the laws\n . . . of the receiving State.” Art. 36(2). Sanchez-Llamas’ argument\n that suppression is appropriate under United States law and should\n be required under the Court’s authority to develop remedies for the\n enforcement of federal law in state-court criminal proceedings is re\n jected. “It is beyond dispute that [this Court does] not hold a super\n visory power over the [state] courts.” Dickerson v. United States, 530\n U. S. 428, 438. The exclusionary rule cases on which Sanchez-Llamas\n principally relies are inapplicable because they rest on the Court’s\n supervisory authority over federal courts.\n     The Court’s authority to create a judicial remedy applicable in\n state court must therefore lie, if anywhere, in the treaty itself.\n Where a treaty provides for a particular judicial remedy, courts must\n apply it as a requirement of federal law. Cf., e.g., United States v.\n Giordano, 416 U. S. 505, 524–525. But where a treaty does not pro\n vide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it is not for\n the federal courts to impose one on the States through lawmaking of\n their own. Even if the “full effect” language of Article 36(2) implicitly\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nrequires a judicial remedy, as Sanchez-Llamas claims, that Article\nequally requires that Article 36(1) rights be exercised in conformity\nwith domestic law. Under domestic law, the exclusionary rule is not\na remedy this Court applies lightly. It has been used primarily to de\nter certain Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations, including, e.g.,\nunconstitutional searches and seizures, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643,\n655–657, and confessions exacted in violation of the right against\ncompelled self-incrimination or due process, Dickerson, supra, at 435.\nIn contrast, Article 36 has nothing to do with searches or interroga\ntions and, indeed, does not guarantee defendants any assistance at\nall. It secures for foreign nationals only the right to have their consu\nlate informed of their arrest or detention—not to have their consulate\nintervene, or to have police cease their investigation pending any\nsuch notice or intervention. Moreover, the failure to inform a defen\ndant of his Article 36 rights is unlikely, with any frequency, to pro\nduce unreliable confessions, see Watkins v. Sowders, 449 U. S. 341,\n347, or to give the police any practical advantage in obtaining in\ncriminating evidence, see Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 217.\nSuppression would also be a vastly disproportionate remedy for an\nArticle 36 violation. The interests Sanchez-Llamas claims Article 36\nadvances are effectively protected by other constitutional and statu\ntory requirements, including the right to an attorney and to protec\ntion against compelled self-incrimination. Finally, suppression is not\nthe only means of vindicating Article 36 rights. For example, diplo\nmatic avenues—the primary means of enforcing the Vienna Conven\ntion—remain open. Pp. 8–15.\n   (c) States may subject Article 36 claims to the same procedural de\nfault rules that apply generally to other federal-law claims.\n   This question is controlled by the Court’s holding in Breard v.\nGreene, 523 U. S. 371, 375, that the petitioner’s failure to raise an Ar\nticle 36 claim in state court prevented him from having the claim\nheard in a subsequent federal habeas proceeding. Bustillo’s two rea\nsons why Breard does not control are rejected.\n   First, he argues that Breard’s procedural default holding was un\nnecessary to the result because the petitioner there could not demon\nstrate prejudice from the default and because, in any event, the later\nenacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 su\nperseded any right the petitioner had under the Vienna Convention\nto have his claim heard on collateral review. Resolution of the proce\ndural default question, however, was the principal reason for denying\nthe Breard petitioner’s claim, and the discussion of the issue occupied\nthe bulk of the Court’s reasoning. See 523 U. S., at 375–377. It is no\nanswer to argue that the procedural default holding was unnecessary\nsimply because the petitioner had several other ways to lose.\n4                     SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       Second, Bustillo asserts that since Breard, the ICJ’s LaGrand and\n    Avena decisions have interpreted the Convention to preclude the ap\n    plication of procedural default rules to Article 36 claims. Although\n    the ICJ’s interpretation deserves “respectful consideration,” Breard,\n    supra, at 375, it does not compel the Court to reconsider Breard’s un\n    derstanding of the Convention. “The judicial Power of the United\n    States” is “vested in one supreme Court . . . and . . . inferior courts.”\n    U. S. Const., Art. III, §1. That “power . . . extend[s] to . . . treaties,”\n    Art. III, §2, and includes the duty “to say what the law is,” Marbury\n    v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177. If treaties are to be given effect as\n    federal law, determining their meaning as a matter of federal law “is\n    emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department,”\n    headed by the “one supreme Court.” Ibid. Nothing in the ICJ’s\n    structure or purpose suggests that its interpretations were intended\n    to be binding on U. S. courts. Even according “respectful considera\n    tion,” the ICJ’s interpretation cannot overcome the plain import of\n    Article 36(2), which states that the rights it implements “shall be ex\n    ercised in conformity with the laws . . . of the receiving State.” In the\n    United States, this means that the rule of procedural default—which\n    applies even to claimed violations of our own Constitution, see Engle\n    v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129—applies also to Vienna Convention\n    claims. Bustillo points to nothing in the drafting history of Article 36\n    or in the contemporary practice of other Convention signatories that\n    undermines this conclusion. LaGrand’s conclusion that applying the\n    procedural default rule denies “full effect” to the purposes of Article\n    36, by preventing courts from attaching legal significance to an Arti\n    cle 36 violation, is inconsistent with the basic framework of an adver\n    sary system. Such a system relies chiefly on the parties to raise sig\n    nificant issues and present them to the courts in the appropriate\n    manner at the appropriate time for adjudication. See Castro v.\n    United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386. Procedural default rules generally\n    take on greater importance in an adversary system than in the sort of\n    magistrate-directed, inquisitorial legal system characteristic of many\n    of the other Convention signatories. Under the ICJ’s reading of “full\n    effect,” Article 36 claims could trump not only procedural default\n    rules, but any number of other rules requiring parties to present\n    their legal claims at the appropriate time for adjudication, such as\n    statutes of limitations and prohibitions against filing successive ha\n    beas petitions. This sweeps too broadly, for it reads the “full effect”\n    proviso in a way that leaves little room for the clear instruction in\n    Article 36(2) that Article 36 rights “be exercised in conformity with\n    the laws . . . of the receiving State.” A comparison with a suspect’s\n    rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, disposes of Bustillo’s\n    “full effect” claim. Although the failure to inform defendants of their\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  right to consular notification may prevent them from becoming aware\n  of their Article 36 rights and asserting them at trial, precisely the\n  same thing is true of Miranda rights. Nevertheless, if a defendant\n  fails to raise his Miranda claim at trial, procedural default rules may\n  bar him from raising the claim in a subsequent postconviction pro\n  ceeding. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87. Bustillo’s attempt to\n  analogize an Article 36 claim to a claim under Brady v. Maryland,\n  373 U. S. 83, that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evi\n  dence is inapt. Finally, his argument that Article 36 claims are most\n  appropriately raised post-trial or on collateral review under Massaro\n  v. United States, 538 U. S. 500, is rejected. See Dickerson, supra, at\n  438. Pp. 15–25.\n     (d) The Court’s holding in no way disparages the Convention’s im\n  portance. It is no slight to the Convention to deny petitioners’ claims\n  under the same principles this Court would apply to claims under an\n  Act of Congress or the Constitution itself.

S. T. 77, 100–101, T. I. A. S. No. 6820, ad\ndresses communication between an individual and his\nconsular officers when the individual is detained by au\nthorities in a foreign country. These consolidated cases\nconcern the availability of judicial relief for violations of\nArticle 36. We are confronted with three questions. First,\ndoes Article 36 create rights that defendants may invoke\nagainst the detaining authorities in a criminal trial or in a\npostconviction proceeding? Second, does a violation of\nArticle 36 require suppression of a defendant’s statements\n2                  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto police? Third, may a State, in a postconviction proceed\ning, treat a defendant’s Article 36 claim as defaulted\nbecause he failed to raise the claim at trial? We conclude,\neven assuming the Convention creates judicially enforce\nable rights, that suppression is not an appropriate remedy\nfor a violation of Article 36, and that a State may apply its\nregular rules of procedural default to Article 36 claims.\nWe therefore affirm the decisions below.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The Vienna Convention was drafted in 1963 with the\npurpose, evident in its preamble, of “contribut[ing] to the\ndevelopment of friendly relations among nations, irrespec\ntive of their differing constitutional and social systems.”\n21 U.

Id., at 77.\n   Article 36 of the Convention concerns consular officers’\naccess to their nationals detained by authorities in a\nforeign country. The article provides that “if he so re\nquests, the competent authorities of the receiving State\nshall, without delay, inform the consular post of the send\ning State if, within its consular district, a national of that\nState is arrested or committed to prison or to custody\npending trial or is detained in any other manner.” Art.\n36(1)(b), id., at 101.1 In other words, when a national of\n——————\n    1 In\n       its entirety, Article 36 of the Vienna Convention states:\n  “1.

Article\n36(1)(b) further states that “[t]he said authorities shall\ninform the person concerned [i.e., the detainee] without\ndelay of his rights under this sub-paragraph.” Ibid. The\nConvention also provides guidance regarding how these\nrequirements, and the other requirements of Article 36,\nare to be implemented:\n     “The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article\n     shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\n     regulations of the receiving State, subject to the pro\n     viso, however, that the said laws and regulations\n     must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for\n     which the rights accorded under this Article are in\n     tended.” Art. 36(2), ibid.\n\n——————\nshall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if,\nwithin its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or\ncommitted to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any\nother manner.

In December 1999, he was involved in an exchange\nof gunfire with police in which one officer suffered a gun\nshot wound in the leg. Police arrested Sanchez-Llamas\nand gave him warnings under Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU. S. 436 (1966), in both English and Spanish. At no time,\nhowever, did they inform him that he could ask to have\nthe Mexican Consulate notified of his detention.\n   Shortly after the arrest and Miranda warnings, police\ninterrogated Sanchez-Llamas with the assistance of an\ninterpreter. In the course of the interrogation, Sanchez-\nLlamas made several incriminating statements regarding\nthe shootout with police. He was charged with attempted\naggravated murder, attempted murder, and several other\noffenses. Before trial, Sanchez-Llamas moved to suppress\nthe statements he made to police. He argued that sup\npression was warranted because the statements were\nmade involuntarily and because the authorities had failed\nto comply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention.

That eve\nning, outside the restaurant, James Merry was struck in\nthe head with a baseball bat as he stood smoking a ciga\nrette. He died several days later. Several witnesses at the\nscene identified Bustillo as the assailant. Police arrested\nBustillo the morning after the attack and eventually\ncharged him with murder. Authorities never informed\nhim that he could request to have the Honduran Consu\nlate notified of his detention.\n  At trial, the defense pursued a theory that another man,\nknown as “Sirena,” was responsible for the attack. Two\ndefense witnesses testified that Bustillo was not the killer.\nOne of the witnesses specifically identified the attacker as\nSirena. In addition, a third defense witness stated that\nshe had seen Sirena on a flight to Honduras the day after\nthe victim died. In its closing argument before the jury,\nthe prosecution dismissed the defense theory about Si\nrena. See App. in No. 05–51, p. 21 (“This whole Sirena\nthing, I don’t want to dwell on it too much.

There, for\nthe first time, he argued that authorities had violated his\nright to consular notification under Article 36 of the Vi\nenna Convention. He claimed that if he had been advised\nof his right to confer with the Honduran Consulate, he\n“would have done so without delay.” App. in No. 05–51,\np. 60. Moreover, the Honduran Consulate executed an\naffidavit stating that “it would have endeavoured to help\nMr. Bustillo in his defense” had it learned of his detention\nprior to trial. Id., at 74. Bustillo insisted that the consu\nlate could have helped him locate Sirena prior to trial. His\nhabeas petition also argued, as part of a claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel, that his attorney should have advised\nhim of his right to notify the Honduran Consulate of his\narrest and detention.2\n   The state habeas court dismissed Bustillo’s Vienna\nConvention claim as “procedurally barred” because he had\nfailed to raise the issue at trial or on appeal. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. in No. 05–51, p. 43a. The court also denied Bust\nillo’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, ruling that\n\n——————\n  2 Bustillo’s habeas petition also presented newly acquired evidence\n\nthat tended to cast doubt on his conviction. Most notably, he produced\na secretly recorded videotape in which Sirena admitted killing Merry\nand stated that Bustillo had been wrongly convicted. App. in No. 05–\n51, pp. 38, 54. In addition, Bustillo argued that the prosecution vio\nlated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), by failing to disclose that\non the night of the crime, police had questioned a man named “Julio C.\nOsorto,” who is now known to be the same man as “Sirena.” The police\nreport concerning the encounter stated that Sirena appeared to have\nketchup on his pants. Bustillo contends that these stains might in fact\nhave been the victim’s blood. The Commonwealth disputes this. The\nstate habeas court found “no evidence of any transfer of the victim’s\nblood to the assailant,” and concluded that the undisclosed encounter\nbetween police and Sirena was not material under Brady.

Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). App. in No.\n05–51, p. 132. In an order refusing Bustillo’s petition for\nappeal, the Supreme Court of Virginia found “no reversi\nble error” in the habeas court’s dismissal of the Vienna\nConvention claim. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 05–51, p.\n1a. We granted certiorari to consider the Vienna Conven\ntion issue. 546 U. S. ___ (2005).\n                               II\n   We granted certiorari as to three questions presented in\nthese cases: (1) whether Article 36 of the Vienna Conven\ntion grants rights that may be invoked by individuals in a\njudicial proceeding; (2) whether suppression of evidence is\na proper remedy for a violation of Article 36; and (3)\nwhether an Article 36 claim may be deemed forfeited\nunder state procedural rules because a defendant failed to\nraise the claim at trial.\n   As a predicate to their claims for relief, Sanchez-Llamas\nand Bustillo each argue that Article 36 grants them an\nindividually enforceable right to request that their consu\nlar officers be notified of their detention, and an accompa\nnying right to be informed by authorities of the availabil\nity of consular notification. Respondents and the United\nStates, as amicus curiae, strongly dispute this contention.\nThey argue that “there is a presumption that a treaty will\nbe enforced through political and diplomatic channels,\nrather than through the courts.” Brief for United States 11;\nibid. (quoting Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580, 598 (1884)\n(a treaty “ ‘is primarily a compact between independent\nnations,’ ” and “ ‘depends for the enforcement of its provi\nsions on the interest and the honor of the governments\nwhich are parties to it’ ”)). Because we conclude that\nSanchez-Llamas and Bustillo are not in any event entitled\n8               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto relief on their claims, we find it unnecessary to resolve\nthe question whether the Vienna Convention grants indi\nviduals enforceable rights. Therefore, for purposes of\naddressing petitioners’ claims, we assume, without decid\ning, that Article 36 does grant Bustillo and Sanchez-\nLlamas such rights.\n                               A\n   Sanchez-Llamas argues that the trial court was re\nquired to suppress his statements to police because au\nthorities never told him of his rights under Article 36. He\nrefrains, however, from arguing that the Vienna Conven\ntion itself mandates suppression. We think this a wise\nconcession. The Convention does not prescribe specific\nremedies for violations of Article 36. Rather, it expressly\nleaves the implementation of Article 36 to domestic law:\nRights under Article 36 are to “be exercised in conformity\nwith the laws and regulations of the receiving State.” Art.\n36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. As far as the text of the Conven\ntion is concerned, the question of the availability of the\nexclusionary rule for Article 36 violations is a matter of\ndomestic law.\n   It would be startling if the Convention were read to\nrequire suppression. The exclusionary rule as we know it\nis an entirely American legal creation. See Bivens v. Six\nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 415 (1971)\n(Burger, C. J., dissenting) (the exclusionary rule “is unique\nto American jurisprudence”). More than 40 years after the\ndrafting of the Convention, the automatic exclusionary\nrule applied in our courts is still “universally rejected” by\nother countries. Bradley, Mapp Goes Abroad, 52 Case W.\nRes. L. Rev. 375, 399–400 (2001); see also Zicherman v.\nKorean Air Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217, 226 (1996) (postratifica\ntion understanding “traditionally considered” as an aid to\ntreaty interpretation).

They argue that\nour cases suppressing evidence obtained in violation of\nfederal statutes are grounded in our supervisory authority\nover the federal courts—an authority that does not extend\nto state-court proceedings. Brief for Respondent in No.\n04–10566, pp. 42–43; Brief for United States 32–34; see\nMcNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, 341 (1943) (sup\npressing evidence for violation of federal statute requiring\npersons arrested without a warrant to be promptly pre\nsented to a judicial officer); Mallory v. United States, 354\nU. S. 449 (1957) (suppressing evidence for violation of simi\nlar requirement of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(a)); Miller v.\nUnited States, 357 U. S. 301 (1958) (suppressing evidence\nobtained incident to an arrest that violated 18 U. S. C.\n§3109). Unless required to do so by the Convention itself,\nthey argue, we cannot direct Oregon courts to exclude\nSanchez-Llamas’ statements from his criminal trial.\n  To the extent Sanchez-Llamas argues that we should\ninvoke our supervisory authority, the law is clear: “It is\nbeyond dispute that we do not hold a supervisory power\nover the courts of the several States.” Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 438 (2000); see also Smith v. Phillips,\n455 U. S. 209, 221 (1982) (“Federal courts hold no supervi\nsory authority over state judicial proceedings and may\nintervene only to correct wrongs of constitutional dimen\nsion”). The cases on which Sanchez-Llamas principally\nrelies are inapplicable in light of the limited reach of our\nsupervisory powers. Mallory and McNabb plainly rest on\nour supervisory authority.        Mallory, supra, at 453;\nMcNabb, supra, at 340. And while Miller is not clear\nabout its authority for requiring suppression, we have\nunderstood it to have a similar basis. See Ker v. Califor\nnia, 374 U. S. 23, 31 (1963).\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   We also agree with the State of Oregon and the United\nStates that our authority to create a judicial remedy appli\ncable in state court must lie, if anywhere, in the treaty itself.\nUnder the Constitution, the President has the power, “by\nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make\nTreaties.” Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The United States ratified the\nConvention with the expectation that it would be inter\npreted according to its terms. See Restatement (Third) of\nForeign Relations Law of the United States §325(1) (1986)\n(“An international agreement is to be interpreted in good\nfaith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to\nits terms in their context and in the light of its object and\npurpose”). If we were to require suppression for Article 36\nviolations without some authority in the Convention, we\nwould in effect be supplementing those terms by enlarging\nthe obligations of the United States under the Convention.\nThis is entirely inconsistent with the judicial function. Cf.\nThe Amiable Isabella, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (1821) (Story, J.) (“[T]o\nalter, amend, or add to any treaty, by inserting any clause,\nwhether small or great, important or trivial, would be on our\npart an usurpation of power, and not an exercise of judicial\nfunctions. It would be to make, and not to construe a\ntreaty”).\n   Of course, it is well established that a self-executing\ntreaty binds the States pursuant to the Supremacy Clause,\nand that the States therefore must recognize the force of the\ntreaty in the course of adjudicating the rights of litigants.\nSee, e.g., Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U. S. 483 (1880). And\nwhere a treaty provides for a particular judicial remedy,\nthere is no issue of intruding on the constitutional pre\nrogatives of the States or the other federal branches.\nCourts must apply the remedy as a requirement of federal\nlaw. Cf. 18 U. S. C. §2515; United States v. Giordano, 416\nU. S. 505, 524–525 (1974). But where a treaty does not\nprovide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it\nis not for the federal courts to impose one on the States\n12              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough lawmaking of their own.\n   Sanchez-Llamas argues that the language of the Con\nvention implicitly requires a judicial remedy because it\nstates that the laws and regulations governing the exer\ncise of Article 36 rights “must enable full effect to be given\nto the purposes for which the rights . . . are intended,” Art.\n36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). In his view,\nalthough “full effect” may not automatically require an\nexclusionary rule, it does require an appropriate judicial\nremedy of some kind. There is reason to doubt this inter\npretation. In particular, there is little indication that\nother parties to the Convention have interpreted Article\n36 to require a judicial remedy in the context of criminal\nprosecutions. See Department of State Answers to Ques\ntions Posed by the First Circuit in United States v. Nai\nFook Li, No. 97–2034 etc., p. A–9 (Oct. 15, 1999) (“We are\nunaware of any country party to the [Vienna Convention]\nthat provides remedies for violations of consular notifica\ntion through its domestic criminal justice system”).\n   Nevertheless, even if Sanchez-Llamas is correct that\nArticle 36 implicitly requires a judicial remedy, the Con\nvention equally states that Article 36 rights “shall be\nexercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of\nthe receiving State.” Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. Under\nour domestic law, the exclusionary rule is not a remedy we\napply lightly. “[O]ur cases have repeatedly emphasized\nthat the rule’s ‘costly toll’ upon truth-seeking and law\nenforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those\nurging application of the rule.” Pennsylvania Bd. of Proba\ntion and Parole v. Scott, 524 U. S. 357, 364–365 (1998).\nBecause the rule’s social costs are considerable, suppres\nsion is warranted only where the rule’s “ ‘remedial objec\ntives are thought most efficaciously served.’ ” United\nStates v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 908 (1984) (quoting United\nStates v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 348 (1974)).\n   We have applied the exclusionary rule primarily to deter\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstitutional violations. In particular, we have ruled that\nthe Constitution requires the exclusion of evidence ob\ntained by certain violations of the Fourth Amendment, see\nTaylor v. Alabama, 457 U. S. 687, 694 (1982) (arrests in\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment); Mapp v. Ohio, 367\nU. S. 643, 655–657 (1961) (unconstitutional searches and\nseizures), and confessions exacted by police in violation of\nthe right against compelled self-incrimination or due proc\ness, see Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 435 (failure to give Miranda\nwarnings); Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560, 568 (1958)\n(involuntary confessions).\n   The few cases in which we have suppressed evidence for\nstatutory violations do not help Sanchez-Llamas. In those\ncases, the excluded evidence arose directly out of statutory\nviolations that implicated important Fourth and Fifth\nAmendment interests. McNabb, for example, involved the\nsuppression of incriminating statements obtained during a\nprolonged detention of the defendants, in violation of a\nstatute requiring persons arrested without a warrant to be\npromptly presented to a judicial officer. We noted that the\nstatutory right was intended to “avoid all the evil implica\ntions of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime,”\n318 U. S., at 344, and later stated that McNabb was “re\nsponsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment\npolicy that . . . face[d] us . . . as to the states” in Miranda,\n384 U. S., at 463. Similarly, in Miller, we required sup\npression of evidence that was the product of a search\nincident to an unlawful arrest. 357 U. S., at 305; see\nCalifornia v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621, 624 (1991) (“We have\nlong understood that the Fourth Amendment’s protection\nagainst ‘unreasonable . . . seizures’ includes seizure of the\nperson”).\n   The violation of the right to consular notification, in\ncontrast, is at best remotely connected to the gathering of\nevidence. Article 36 has nothing whatsoever to do with\nsearches or interrogations. Indeed, Article 36 does not\n14              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nguarantee defendants any assistance at all. The provision\nsecures only a right of foreign nationals to have their\nconsulate informed of their arrest or detention—not to\nhave their consulate intervene, or to have law enforcement\nauthorities cease their investigation pending any such\nnotice or intervention. In most circumstances, there is\nlikely to be little connection between an Article 36 viola\ntion and evidence or statements obtained by police.\n   Moreover, the reasons we often require suppression for\nFourth and Fifth Amendment violations are entirely\nabsent from the consular notification context. We require\nexclusion of coerced confessions both because we disap\nprove of such coercion and because such confessions tend\nto be unreliable. Watkins v. Sowders, 449 U. S. 341, 347\n(1981). We exclude the fruits of unreasonable searches on\nthe theory that without a strong deterrent, the constraints\nof the Fourth Amendment might be too easily disregarded\nby law enforcement. Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S.\n206, 217 (1960). The situation here is quite different. The\nfailure to inform a defendant of his Article 36 rights is\nunlikely, with any frequency, to produce unreliable confes\nsions. And unlike the search-and-seizure context—where\nthe need to obtain valuable evidence may tempt authori\nties to transgress Fourth Amendment limitations—police\nwin little, if any, practical advantage from violating Arti\ncle 36. Suppression would be a vastly disproportionate\nremedy for an Article 36 violation.\n   Sanchez-Llamas counters that the failure to inform\ndefendants of their right to consular notification gives\nthem “a misleadingly incomplete picture of [their] legal\noptions,” Brief for Petitioner in No. 04–10566, p. 42, and\nthat suppression will give authorities an incentive to abide\nby Article 36.\n   Leaving aside the suggestion that it is the role of police\ngenerally to advise defendants of their legal options, we\nthink other constitutional and statutory requirements\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neffectively protect the interests served, in Sanchez-Llamas’\nview, by Article 36. A foreign national detained on suspi\ncion of crime, like anyone else in our country, enjoys under\nour system the protections of the Due Process Clause.\nAmong other things, he is entitled to an attorney, and is\nprotected against compelled self-incrimination. See Wong\nWing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 238 (1896) (“[A]ll\npersons within the territory of the United States are enti\ntled to the protection guaranteed by” the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments). Article 36 adds little to these “legal options,”\nand we think it unnecessary to apply the exclusionary rule\nwhere other constitutional and statutory protections—many\nof them already enforced by the exclusionary rule—\nsafeguard the same interests Sanchez-Llamas claims are\nadvanced by Article 36.\n   Finally, suppression is not the only means of vindicating\nVienna Convention rights. A defendant can raise an\nArticle 36 claim as part of a broader challenge to the\nvoluntariness of his statements to police. If he raises an\nArticle 36 violation at trial, a court can make appropriate\naccommodations to ensure that the defendant secures, to\nthe extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance. Of\ncourse, diplomatic avenues—the primary means of enforc\ning the Convention—also remain open.\n   In sum, neither the Vienna Convention itself nor our\nprecedents applying the exclusionary rule support sup\npression of Sanchez-Llamas’ statements to police.\n                             B\n  The Virginia courts denied petitioner Bustillo’s Article\n36 claim on the ground that he failed to raise it at trial or\non direct appeal. The general rule in federal habeas cases\nis that a defendant who fails to raise a claim on direct\nappeal is barred from raising the claim on collateral re\nview. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S. 500, 504\n(2003); Bousley v. United States, 523 U. S. 614, 621 (1998).\n16              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThere is an exception if a defendant can demonstrate both\n“cause” for not raising the claim at trial, and “prejudice”\nfrom not having done so. Massaro, supra, at 504. Like\nmany States, Virginia applies a similar rule in state post-\nconviction proceedings, and did so here to bar Bustillo’s\nVienna Convention claim. Normally, in our review of\nstate-court judgments, such rules constitute an adequate\nand independent state-law ground preventing us from\nreviewing the federal claim. Coleman v. Thompson, 501\nU. S. 722, 729 (1991). Bustillo contends, however, that\nstate procedural default rules cannot apply to Article 36\nclaims. He argues that the Convention requires that\nArticle 36 rights be given “ ‘full effect’ ” and that Virginia’s\nprocedural default rules “prevented any effect (much less\n‘full effect’) from being given to” those rights. Brief for\nPetitioner in No. 05–51, p. 35.\n   This is not the first time we have been asked to set aside\nprocedural default rules for a Vienna Convention claim.\nRespondent Johnson and the United States persuasively\nargue that this question is controlled by our decision in\nBreard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam). In\nBreard, the petitioner failed to raise an Article 36 claim in\nstate court—at trial or on collateral review—and then\nsought to have the claim heard in a subsequent federal\nhabeas proceeding. Id., at 375. He argued that “the Con\nvention is the ‘supreme law of the land’ and thus trumps\nthe procedural default doctrine.” Ibid. We rejected this\nargument as “plainly incorrect,” for two reasons. Ibid.\nFirst, we observed, “it has been recognized in interna\ntional law that, absent a clear and express statement to\nthe contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State\ngovern the implementation of the treaty in that State.”\nIbid. Furthermore, we reasoned that while treaty protec\ntions such as Article 36 may constitute supreme federal\nlaw, this is “no less true of provisions of the Constitution\nitself, to which rules of procedural default apply.” Id., at\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n376. In light of Breard’s holding, Bustillo faces an uphill\ntask in arguing that the Convention requires States to set\naside their procedural default rules for Article 36 claims.\n  Bustillo offers two reasons why Breard does not control\nhis case. He first argues that Breard’s holding concerning\nprocedural default was “unnecessary to the result,” Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 05–51, p. 45, because the petitioner\nthere could not demonstrate prejudice from the default\nand because, in any event, a subsequent federal statute—\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996, 110 Stat. 1214—superseded any right the petitioner\nhad under the Vienna Convention to have his claim heard\non collateral review. We find Bustillo’s contention unper\nsuasive. Our resolution of the procedural default question\nin Breard was the principal reason for the denial of the\npetitioner’s claim, and the discussion of the issue occupied\nthe bulk of our reasoning. See 523 U. S., at 375–377. It is\nno answer to argue, as Bustillo does, that the holding in\nBreard was “unnecessary” simply because the petitioner in\nthat case had several ways to lose. See Richmond Screw\nAnchor Co. v. United States, 275 U. S. 331, 340 (1928).\n  Bustillo’s second reason is less easily dismissed. He\nargues that since Breard, the ICJ has interpreted the\nVienna Convention to preclude the application of proce\ndural default rules to Article 36 claims. The LaGrand\nCase (F. R. G. v. U. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment of\nJune 27) (LaGrand), and the Case Concerning Avena and\nother Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No.\n128 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (Avena), were brought before\nthe ICJ by the governments of Germany and Mexico,\nrespectively, on behalf of several of their nationals facing\ndeath sentences in the United States. The foreign gov\nernments claimed that their nationals had not been in\nformed of their right to consular notification.

OREGON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n“full effect” to the purposes of the Convention, as required\nby Article 36. The ICJ agreed, explaining that the defen\ndants had procedurally defaulted their claims “because of\nthe failure of the American authorities to comply with\ntheir obligation under Article 36.” LaGrand, supra, at\n497, ¶91; see also Avena, supra, ¶113. Application of the\nprocedural default rule in such circumstances, the ICJ\nreasoned, “prevented [courts] from attaching any legal\nsignificance” to the fact that the violation of Article 36\nkept the foreign governments from assisting in their na\ntionals’ defense. LaGrand, supra, at 497, ¶91; see also\nAvena, supra, ¶113.\n   Bustillo argues that LaGrand and Avena warrant revis\niting the procedural default holding of Breard. In a simi\nlar vein, several amici contend that “the United States is\nobligated to comply with the Convention, as interpreted by\nthe ICJ.” Brief for ICJ Experts 11 (emphases added). We\ndisagree. Although the ICJ’s interpretation deserves\n“respectful consideration,” Breard, supra, at 375, we con\nclude that it does not compel us to reconsider our under\nstanding of the Convention in Breard.4\n   Under our Constitution, “[t]he judicial Power of the\nUnited States” is “vested in one supreme Court, and in\nsuch inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to\ntime ordain and establish.” Art. III, §1. That “judicial\nPower . . . extend[s] to . . . Treaties.” Id., §2. And, as Chief\nJustice Marshall famously explained, that judicial power\n\n——————\n  4 The dissent, in light of LaGrand and Avena, “would read Breard . . .\n\nas not saying that the Convention never trumps any procedural default\nrule.” Post, at 26 (opinion of BREYER, J.). This requires more than\n“reading an exception into Breard’s language,” post, at 27, amounting\ninstead to overruling Breard’s plain holding that the Convention does\nnot trump the procedural default doctrine. While the appeal of such a\ncourse to a Breard dissenter may be clear, see 523 U. S., at 380\n(BREYER, J., dissenting), “respectful consideration” of precedent should\nbegin at home.\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nincludes the duty “to say what the law is.” Marbury v.\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). If treaties are to be\ngiven effect as federal law under our legal system, deter\nmining their meaning as a matter of federal law “is em\nphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart\nment,” headed by the “one supreme Court” established by\nthe Constitution. Ibid.; see also Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 378–379 (2000) (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (“At the\ncore of [the judicial] power is the federal courts’ independent\nresponsibility—independent from its coequal branches in\nthe Federal Government, and independent from the sepa\nrate authority of the several States—to interpret federal\nlaw”). It is against this background that the United States\nratified, and the Senate gave its advice and consent to, the\nvarious agreements that govern referral of Vienna Con\nvention disputes to the ICJ.\n  Nothing in the structure or purpose of the ICJ suggests\nthat its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on\nour courts.5 The ICJ’s decisions have “no binding force\n——————\n   5 The dissent’s extensive list of lower court opinions that have “looked\n\nto the ICJ for guidance,” post, at 21–22, is less impressive than first\nappears. Many of the cited opinions merely refer to, or briefly describe,\nICJ decisions without in any way relying on them as authority. See,\ne.g., Committee of United States Citizens Living in Nicaragua v.\nReagan, 859 F. 2d 929, 932, 935 (CADC 1988); Conservation Law\nFoundation of New England v. Secretary of Interior, 790 F. 2d 965, 967\n(CA1 1986); Narenji v. Civiletti, 617 F. 2d 745, 748 (CADC 1979); Diggs\nv. Richardson, 555 F. 2d 848, 849 (CADC 1976); Rogers v. Societe\nInternationale Pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S. A.,\n278 F. 2d 268, 273, n. 3 (CADC 1960) (Fahy, J., dissenting). Others cite\nICJ opinions alongside law review articles for general propositions\nabout international law. See, e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Islamic Republic\nof Iran, 52 F. 3d 346, 352 (CADC 1995); Princz v. Federal Republic of\nGermany, 26 F. 3d 1166, 1180, 1184 (CADC 1994) (Wald, J., dissent\ning); Sadat v. Mertes, 615 F. 2d 1176, 1187, n. 14 (CA7 1980); United\nStates v. Postal, 589 F. 2d 862, 869 (CA5 1979). Moreover, all but two\nof the cited decisions from this Court concern technical issues of bound\nary demarcation. See post, at 21.\n20              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexcept between the parties and in respect of that particu\nlar case,” Statute of the International Court of Justice,\nArt. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945) (emphasis\nadded). Any interpretation of law the ICJ renders in the\ncourse of resolving particular disputes is thus not binding\nprecedent even as to the ICJ itself; there is accordingly\nlittle reason to think that such interpretations were in\ntended to be controlling on our courts. The ICJ’s principal\npurpose is to arbitrate particular disputes between na\ntional governments. Id., at 1055 (ICJ is “the principal\njudicial organ of the United Nations”); see also Art. 34, id.,\nat 1059 (“Only states [i.e., countries] may be parties in\ncases before the Court”). While each member of the\nUnited Nations has agreed to comply with decisions of the\nICJ “in any case to which it is a party,” United Nations\nCharter, Art. 94(1), 59 Stat. 1051, T. S. No. 933 (1945), the\nCharter’s procedure for noncompliance—referral to the\nSecurity Council by the aggrieved state—contemplates\nquintessentially international remedies, Art. 94(2), ibid.\n   In addition, “[w]hile courts interpret treaties for them\nselves, the meaning given them by the departments of\ngovernment particularly charged with their negotiation\nand enforcement is given great weight.” Kolovrat v. Ore\ngon, 366 U. S. 187, 194 (1961). Although the United\nStates has agreed to “discharge its international obliga\ntions” in having state courts give effect to the decision in\nAvena, it has not taken the view that the ICJ’s interpreta\ntion of Article 36 is binding on our courts. President Bush,\nMemorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005),\nApp. to Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nMedellín v. Dretke, O. T. 2004, No. 04–5928, p. 9a. More\nover, shortly after Avena, the United States withdrew\nfrom the Optional Protocol concerning Vienna Convention\ndisputes. Whatever the effect of Avena and LaGrand\nbefore this withdrawal, it is doubtful that our courts\nshould give decisive weight to the interpretation of a\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntribunal whose jurisdiction in this area is no longer recog\nnized by the United States.\n   LaGrand and Avena are therefore entitled only to the\n“respectful consideration” due an interpretation of an\ninternational agreement by an international court.\nBreard, 523 U. S., at 375. Even according such considera\ntion, the ICJ’s interpretation cannot overcome the plain\nimport of Article 36. As we explained in Breard, the pro\ncedural rules of domestic law generally govern the imple\nmentation of an international treaty. Ibid. In addition,\nArticle 36 makes clear that the rights it provides “shall be\nexercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of\nthe receiving State” provided that “full effect . . . be given\nto the purposes for which the rights accorded under this\nArticle are intended.” Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. In\nthe United States, this means that the rule of procedural\ndefault—which applies even to claimed violations of our\nConstitution, see Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129\n(1982)—applies also to Vienna Convention claims. Busti\nllo points to nothing in the drafting history of Article 36 or\nin the contemporary practice of other signatories that\nundermines this conclusion.\n   The ICJ concluded that where a defendant was not\nnotified of his rights under Article 36, application of the\nprocedural default rule failed to give “full effect” to the\npurposes of Article 36 because it prevented courts from\nattaching “legal significance” to the Article 36 violation.\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 497–498, ¶¶90–91. This reason\ning overlooks the importance of procedural default rules in\nan adversary system, which relies chiefly on the parties to\nraise significant issues and present them to the courts in\nthe appropriate manner at the appropriate time for adju\ndication. See Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386\n(2003) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (“Our adversary system is designed around the\npremise that the parties know what is best for them, and\n22              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nare responsible for advancing the facts and arguments\nentitling them to relief”). Procedural default rules are\ndesigned to encourage parties to raise their claims promptly\nand to vindicate “the law’s important interest in the finality\nof judgments.” Massaro, 538 U. S., at 504. The conse\nquence of failing to raise a claim for adjudication at the\nproper time is generally forfeiture of that claim. As a\nresult, rules such as procedural default routinely deny “legal\nsignificance”—in the Avena and LaGrand sense—to other\nwise viable legal claims.\n   Procedural default rules generally take on greater im\nportance in an adversary system such as ours than in the\nsort of magistrate-directed, inquisitorial legal system\ncharacteristic of many of the other countries that are\nsignatories to the Vienna Convention. “What makes a\nsystem adversarial rather than inquisitorial is . . . the\npresence of a judge who does not (as an inquisitor does)\nconduct the factual and legal investigation himself, but\ninstead decides on the basis of facts and arguments pro\nand con adduced by the parties.” McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501\nU. S. 171, 181, n. 2 (1991). In an inquisitorial system, the\nfailure to raise a legal error can in part be attributed to the\nmagistrate, and thus to the state itself. In our system,\nhowever, the responsibility for failing to raise an issue\ngenerally rests with the parties themselves.\n   The ICJ’s interpretation of Article 36 is inconsistent\nwith the basic framework of an adversary system. Under\nthe ICJ’s reading of “full effect,” Article 36 claims could\ntrump not only procedural default rules, but any number\nof other rules requiring parties to present their legal\nclaims at the appropriate time for adjudication. If the\nState’s failure to inform the defendant of his Article 36\nrights generally excuses the defendant’s failure to comply\nwith relevant procedural rules, then presumably rules\nsuch as statutes of limitations and prohibitions against\nfiling successive habeas petitions must also yield in the\n                       Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                       23\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nface of Article 36 claims. This sweeps too broadly, for it\nreads the “full effect” proviso in a way that leaves little\nroom for Article 36’s clear instruction that Article 36\nrights “shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\nregulations of the receiving State.” Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T.,\nat 101.6\n——————\n  6 The  dissent would read the ICJ’s decisions to require that proce\ndural default rules give way only where “the State is unwilling to\nprovide some other effective remedy, for example (if the lawyer acts\nincompetently in respect to Convention rights of which the lawyer was\naware) an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.” Post, at 25 (opinion\nof BREYER, J.). But both LaGrand and Avena indicate that the avail\nability of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not an adequate\nremedy for an Article 36 violation. See LaGrand Case (F. R. G. v.\nU. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466, 497, ¶91 (Judgment of June 27) (requiring\nsuspension of state procedural default rule even though “United States\ncourts could and did examine the professional competence of counsel\nassigned to the indigent LaGrands by reference to United States\nconstitutional standards”); see also Case Concerning Avena and other\nMexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128, ¶134 (Judg\nment of Mar. 31).\n   To the extent the dissent suggests that the ICJ’s decisions could be\nread to prevent application of procedural default rules where a defen\ndant’s attorney is unaware of Article 36, see post, at 24–25 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.), this interpretation of the Convention is in sharp conflict\nwith the role of counsel in our system. “Attorney ignorance or inadver\ntence is not ‘cause’ because the attorney is the petitioner’s agent when\nacting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner\nmust ‘bear the risk of attorney error.’ ” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 753 (1991) (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986)).\nUnder our system, an attorney’s lack of knowledge does not excuse the\ndefendant’s default, unless the attorney’s overall representation falls\nbelow what is required by the Sixth Amendment. In any event, Bustillo\nhimself does not argue that the applicability of procedural default rules\nhinges on whether a foreign national’s attorney was aware of Article 36.\nSee Brief for Petitioner in No. 05–51, p. 38 (“[A] lawyer may not,\nconsistent with the purposes of Article 36, unilaterally forfeit a foreign\nnational’s opportunity to communicate with his consulate”). In fact,\nBustillo has conceded that his “attorney at trial was aware of his\nclient’s rights under the Vienna Convention.” App. in No. 05–51,\np. 203, n. 5.\n24              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Much as Sanchez-Llamas cannot show that suppression\nis an appropriate remedy for Article 36 violations under\ndomestic law principles, so too Bustillo cannot show that\nnormally applicable procedural default rules should be\nsuspended in light of the type of right he claims. In this\nregard, a comparison of Article 36 and a suspect’s rights\nunder Miranda disposes of Bustillo’s claim. Bustillo con\ntends that applying procedural default rules to Article 36\nrights denies such rights “full effect” because the violation\nitself—i.e., the failure to inform defendants of their right\nto consular notification—prevents them from becoming\naware of their Article 36 rights and asserting them at\ntrial. Of course, precisely the same thing is true of rights\nunder Miranda. Police are required to advise suspects\nthat they have a right to remain silent and a right to an\nattorney. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 479; see also\nDickerson, 530 U. S., at 435. If police do not give such\nwarnings, and counsel fails to object, it is equally true that\na suspect may not be “aware he even had such rights until\nwell after his trial had concluded.” Brief for Petitioner in\nNo. 05–51, p. 35. Nevertheless, it is well established that\nwhere a defendant fails to raise a Miranda claim at trial,\nprocedural default rules may bar him from raising the\nclaim in a subsequent postconviction proceeding. Wain\nwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977).\n   Bustillo responds that an Article 36 claim more closely\nresembles a claim, under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963), that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory\nevidence—a type of claim that often can be asserted for\nthe first time only in postconviction proceedings. See\nUnited States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U. S. 74, 83, n. 9\n(2004). The analogy is inapt. In the case of a Brady claim,\nit is impossible for the defendant to know as a factual\nmatter that a violation has occurred before the exculpa\ntory evidence is disclosed. By contrast, a defendant is well\naware of the fact that he was not informed of his Article 36\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrights, even if the legal significance of that fact eludes him.\n   Finally, relying on Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S.\n500, Bustillo argues that Article 36 claims “are most ap\npropriately raised post-trial or on collateral review.” Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 05–51, p. 39. Massaro held that\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel may be raised\nfor the first time in a proceeding under 28 U. S. C. §2255.\nThat decision, however, involved the question of the\nproper forum for federal habeas claims. Bustillo, by con\ntrast, asks us to require the States to hear Vienna Conven\ntion claims raised for the first time in state postconviction\nproceedings. Given that the Convention itself imposes no\nsuch requirement, we do not perceive any grounds for us\nto revise state procedural rules in this fashion. See\nDickerson, supra, at 438.\n   We therefore conclude, as we did in Breard, that claims\nunder Article 36 of the Vienna Convention may be sub\njected to the same procedural default rules that apply\ngenerally to other federal-law claims.\n                        *    *      *\n  Although these cases involve the delicate question of the\napplication of an international treaty, the issues in many\nways turn on established principles of domestic law. Our\nholding in no way disparages the importance of the Vienna\nConvention. The relief petitioners request is, by any meas\nure, extraordinary. Sanchez-Llamas seeks a suppression\nremedy for an asserted right with little if any connection to\nthe gathering of evidence; Bustillo requests an exception to\nprocedural rules that is accorded to almost no other right,\nincluding many of our most fundamental constitutional\nprotections. It is no slight to the Convention to deny\npetitioners’ claims under the same principles we would\napply to an Act of Congress, or to the Constitution itself.\n  The judgments of the Supreme Court of Oregon and the\nSupreme Court of Virginia are affirmed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

As to the suppression and procedural\ndefault issues, I join the Court’s judgment. The dissenting\nopinion veers away from the two cases here for review,\nimagining other situations unlike those at hand. In nei\nther of the cases before us would I remand for further\nproceedings.\n  I turn first to the question whether a violation of Article\n36 requires suppression of statements to police officers in\nSanchez-Llamas’ case and others like it. Shortly after his\narrest and in advance of any police interrogation, Sanchez-\nLlamas received the warnings required by Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), in both English and Spanish.\nTr. 122 (Nov. 16, 2000). He indicated that he understood\n2                 SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                 GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthose warnings, id., at 123, telling the police that he had\nlived in the United States for approximately 11 years, id., at\n124, 143, 177. After a break in questioning, Sanchez-\nLlamas again received Miranda warnings in Spanish, and\nagain indicated that he understood them. Id., at 129, 176.\nSanchez-Llamas, with his life experience in the United\nStates, scarcely resembles the uncomprehending detainee\nimagined by JUSTICE BREYER, post, at 30. Such a detainee\nwould have little need to invoke the Vienna Convention, for\nMiranda warnings a defendant is unable to comprehend\ngive the police no green light for interrogation. Moran v.\nBurbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421 (1986) (a defendant’s waiver of\nMiranda rights must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent,\ni.e., “the product of a free and deliberate choice . . . made\nwith a full awareness of both the nature of the right being\nabandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon\nit”); United States v. Garibay, 143 F. 3d 534, 537–540 (CA9\n1998) (defendant, who had difficulty understanding English,\ndid not knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda\nrights where the police recited the Miranda warnings only\nin English); United States v. Short, 790 F. 2d 464, 469 (CA6\n1986) (defendant’s limited comprehension of English cast\nsubstantial doubt on the validity of her Miranda waiver).1\n   In contrast to Miranda warnings, which must be given\non the spot before the police interrogate, Article 36 of the\nVienna Convention does not require the arresting author\nity to contact the consular post instantly. See Case Con\ncerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v.\n——————\n    1 Before\n           trial, Sanchez-Llamas moved to suppress his statements to\npolice on voluntariness grounds.

The Court explains, and I agree, that it would\nbe extraordinary to hold that defendants, unaware of their\nMiranda rights because the police failed to convey the\nrequired warnings, would be subject to a State’s proce\ndural default rules, but defendants not told of Article 36\nrights would face no such hindrance. See ante, at 24.\nFurthermore, as the dissent apparently recognizes, in the\nfederal court system, a later-in-time statute, codifying a\nfederal procedural default rule, would “supersed[e] any\ninconsistent provision in the Convention.” Post, at 25–26\n(citing Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam)).\nIn my view, it would be unseemly, to say the least, for this\nCourt to command state courts to relax their identical, or\neven less stringent procedural default rules, while federal\ncourts operate without constraint in this regard. Post, at\n26. That state of affairs, surely productive of friction in\nour federal system, should be resisted if there is a plausi\nble choice, i.e., if a reasonable interpretation of the federal\nstatute and international accord would avoid the conflict.\n   Critical for me, Bustillo has conceded that his “attorney\nat trial was aware of his client’s rights under the Vienna\nConvention.” App. in No. 05–51, p. 203, n. 5. Given the\nknowledge of the Vienna Convention that Bustillo’s lawyer\npossessed, this case fails to meet the dissent’s (and the\nInternational Court of Justice’s) first condition for overrid\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

C. J., ¶113); accord post, at 6, 16, 18, 23.\nNothing the State did or omitted to do here “precluded\ncounsel from . . . rais[ing] the question of a violation of the\nVienna Convention in the initial trial.” Ibid. Had counsel\ndone so, the trial court could have made “appropriate\naccommodations to ensure that the defendant secure[d], to\nthe extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance.”\nAnte, at 15.3\n  In short, if there are some times when a Convention\nviolation, standing alone, might warrant suppression, or\nthe displacement of a State’s ordinarily applicable proce\ndural default rules, neither Sanchez-Llamas’ case nor\nBustillo’s belongs in that category.\n\n\n——————\n  3 Furthermore, once Bustillo became aware of his Vienna Convention\n\nrights, nothing prevented him from raising an ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claim predicated on his trial counsel’s failure to assert the\nState’s violation of those rights. Through such a claim, as the dissent\nacknowledges, see post, at 16, 19, 25, 29, “full effect” could have been\ngiven to Article 36, without dishonoring state procedural rules that are\ncompatible with due process. Bustillo did not include a Vienna-\nConvention-based, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim along with his\ndirect Vienna Convention claim in his initial habeas petition. He later\nsought to amend his petition to add an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim, but the court held that the amendment did not relate back to the\ninitial pleading. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26, 42. The state court therefore\nrejected Bustillo’s ineffectiveness claim as barred by the applicable\nstate statute of limitations. App. 132.

We granted certiorari in\nthese cases to consider three related questions: (1) May a\ncriminal defendant raise a claim (at trial or in a postcon\nviction proceeding) that state officials violated this provi\nsion? (2) May a State apply its usual procedural default\nrules to Convention claims, thereby denying the defendant\nthe right to raise the claim in a postconviction proceeding\n2               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\non the ground that the defendant failed to raise the claim\nat trial? And (3) is suppression of a defendant’s confession\n(made to police after a violation of the Convention) an\nappropriate remedy?\n   The Court assumes, but does not decide, that the an\nswer to the first question is “yes.” Ante, at 7–8. It an\nswers the second question by holding that a State always\nmay apply its ordinary procedural default rules to a de\nfendant’s claim of a Convention violation. Ante, at 15–25.\nIts answer to the third question is that suppression is\nnever an appropriate remedy for a Convention violation.\nAnte, at 8–15.\n   Unlike the majority, I would decide the first question\nand answer it affirmatively. A criminal defendant may, at\ntrial or in a postconviction proceeding, raise the claim that\nstate authorities violated the Convention in his case. My\nanswer to the second question is that sometimes state\nprocedural default rules must yield to the Convention’s\ninsistence that domestic laws “enable full effect to be given\nto the purposes for which” Article 36’s “rights . . . are\nintended.” Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. And my answer\nto the third question is that suppression may sometimes\nprovide an appropriate remedy. After answering these\nquestions, I would remand these cases, thereby permitting\nthe States to apply their own procedural and remedial\nlaws, but with the understanding that the Federal Consti\ntution requires that the application of those laws be con\nsistent with the Convention’s demand for an effective\nremedy for an Article 36 violation.

The United States and 169 other na\ntions have ratified the Convention. Its adoption in 1963\nwas perhaps “the single most important event in the\nentire history of the consular institution.” L. Lee, Consu\nlar Law and Practice 26 (2d ed. 1991). The Convention\ndefines consular functions to include “protecting in the\nreceiving State the interests of the sending State and of its\nnationals,” and “helping and assisting nationals . . . of the\nsending State.” Arts. 5(a), (e), 21 U. S. T., at 82–83. The\nUnited States ratified the Convention in 1969.\n   Article 36 of the Convention governs relations between a\nconsulate and its nationals, particularly those who have\nbeen arrested by the host country. Its object is to assure\nconsular communication and assistance to such nationals,\nwho may not fully understand the host country’s legal\nregime or even speak its language. Article 36 reads as\nfollows:\n    “1. With a view to facilitating the exercise of consular\n    functions relating to nationals of the sending State:\n      “(a) consular officers shall be free to communicate\n    with nationals of the sending State and to have access\n    to them. Nationals of the sending State shall have the\n    same freedom with respect to communication with\n    and access to consular officers of the sending State;\n      “(b) if he so requests, the competent authorities of\n    the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the\n    consular post of the sending State if, within its consu\n    lar district, a national of that State is arrested or\n    committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is\n    detained in any other manner. Any communication\n    addressed to the consular post by the person arrested,\n    in prison, custody or detention shall also be forwarded\n    by the said authorities without delay. The said au\n    thorities shall inform the person concerned without de\n4               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v.

The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Arti\n    cle shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\n    regulations of the receiving State, subject to the pro\n    viso, however, that the said laws and regulations\n    must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for\n    which the rights accorded under this Article are in\n    tended.” 21 U. S. T., at 100–101 (emphasis added).\nThe U. S. State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual has\nlong stressed the importance the United States places\nupon these provisions. It says, “[O]ne of the basic func\ntions of a consular office has been to provide a ‘cultural\nbridge’ between the host community and the [U. S. na\ntional]. No one needs that cultural bridge more than the\nindividual U. S. citizen who has been arrested in a foreign\ncountry or imprisoned in a foreign jail.” 7 Foreign Affairs\nManual §401 (1984); see also id., §§401–426 (2004).\n                              B\n  In 1969, the United States also ratified (but the Presi\ndent has since withdrawn from) an Optional Protocol to\nthe Convention. See Optional Protocol Concerning the\nCompulsory Settlement of Disputes (Optional Protocol),\nApr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 325, T. I. A. S.

J. 466 (Judgment of June 27) (LaGrand)\n(case brought by Germany); Case Concerning Avena and\nother Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No.\n128 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (Avena) (case brought by\nMexico).\n   In Germany’s case, the ICJ rejected the United States’\nclaim that the “rights of consular notification and access\nunder [Article 36] are rights of States, and not of individu\nals.” LaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 19–20, ¶76. It held in\nstead that (1) if an arrested foreign national is prejudiced\nby the host country’s failure to inform him of his Article 36\nrights, and (2) if that individual has “been subjected to\nprolonged detention or convicted and sentenced to severe\npenalties,” then a diplomatic apology alone is not a suffi\ncient remedy. Id., at 32–33, ¶125. Rather, the Convention\nrequires the host country, in that case the United States,\n“to allow the review and reconsideration of the” foreign\nnational’s “conviction and sentence by taking account of\nthe violation of the rights set forth in the Convention.”\nIbid. The ICJ added that “[t]he choice of means” for pro\nviding this review “must be left to the United States.”\nIbid. In addition, the ICJ stated that in the case before it,\napplication of a procedural default rule (that is, the rule\nthat the LaGrands could not bring their Convention\nclaims in habeas proceedings because they had not raised\nthose claims at trial) violated Article 36(2) of the Conven\ntion because it “had the effect of preventing ‘full effect\n[from being] given to the purposes for which the rights\naccorded under this article are intended.’ ” Id., at 22, ¶91\n(quoting Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101). In the ICJ’s view,\nit was “the failure of the American authorities to comply”\nwith Article 36 that prevented the LaGrands from raising\ntheir claims earlier. LaGrand, supra, at 22, ¶91.\n   In Mexico’s case, the ICJ reiterated its view that Article\n36, in addition to imposing obligations on member nations,\n6               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nalso allows foreign nationals to bring claims based on\nthose violations in domestic judicial proceedings. The ICJ\nnoted that, as a matter of international law, breach of a\ntreaty ordinarily “ ‘involves an obligation to make repara\ntion in an adequate form.’ ” Avena, supra, ¶119 (quoting\nFactory at Chorzów, Jurisdiction, 1927, P. C. I. J., ser. A,\nNo. 9, p. 21). Applying that principle to the Convention,\nthe ICJ concluded that “the remedy to make good . . .\nviolations [of Article 36] should consist in an obligation on\nthe United States to permit review and reconsideration of\nthese nationals’ cases by the United States courts . . . with\na view to ascertaining whether in each case the violation\n. . . caused actual prejudice to the defendant in the process\nof administration of criminal justice.” Avena, 2004 I. C. J.,\n¶121 (emphasis added). The court added that this “review\nand reconsideration,” to be “effective,” must “fully ex\namin[e] and tak[e] into account” any such prejudice to the\ndefendant. Id., ¶138. The ICJ declined to specify the\nmeans by which American courts should provide such\n“review and reconsideration.” Instead, the ICJ said, the\nappropriate remedy depends upon an examination of “the\nconcrete circumstances of each case” and should be deter\nmined “by the United States courts concerned in the proc\ness of their review and reconsideration.” Id., ¶127.\n    In respect to procedural default, the ICJ referenced\nwhat it said in LaGrand, while adding the critically im\nportant qualification that the cases in which the Conven\ntion blocked application of a procedural default rule were\nthose in which it was “the failure of the United States\nitself to inform” an arrested foreign national of his right to\ncontact the consulate that “precluded counsel from being\nin a position to have raised the question of a violation of\nthe Vienna Convention in the initial trial.” Avena, supra,\n¶113.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The Court assumes that the answer to this\nquestion is “yes,” but it does not decide the matter because\nit concludes in any event that the petitioners are not\nentitled to the remedies they seek. As explained below, I\nwould resolve those remedial questions differently.\nHence, I must decide, rather than assume, the answer to\nthe first question presented.\n  Regardless, the first question raises an important issue\nof federal law that has arisen hundreds of times in the\nlower federal and state courts. See generally Wooster,\nConstruction and Application of Vienna Convention on\n8               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v.

And the issue often arises in\na legal context where statutes or procedural requirements\narguably block this Court’s speedy review. See Medellín v.\nDretke, 544 U. S. 660 (2005) (per curiam). We granted the\npetitions for certiorari in significant part in order to decide\nthis question. And, given its importance, we should do so.\n   In answering the question it is common ground that the\nConvention is “self-executi[ng].” See S. Exec. Rep. No. 91–\n9, p. 5 (1969); see also Brief for Respondent in No. 04–\n10566, pp. 9–10; Brief for Respondent in No. 05–51, p. 23.\nThat is to say, the Convention “operates of itself without\nthe aid of any legislative provision.” Foster v.

The parties also agree that we need\nnot decide whether the Convention creates a “private right\nof action,” i.e., a private right that would allow an individ\nual to bring a lawsuit for enforcement of the Convention or\nfor damages based on its violation. Rather, the question\nhere is whether the Convention provides, in these cases,\nlaw applicable in legal proceedings that might have been\nbrought irrespective of the Vienna Convention claim, here\nan ordinary criminal appeal and an ordinary postconvic\ntion proceeding.\n   Bustillo, for example, has brought an action under a\nVirginia statute that allows any convicted person to seek\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrelease from custody on the ground that “he is detained\nwithout lawful authority.” Va. Code Ann. §8.01–654(A)(1)\n(Lexis 2005). Sanchez-Llamas has challenged his state\ncriminal conviction on direct appeal, and in that proceed\ning he is entitled to claim that his conviction violates state\nor federal law. In both cases the petitioners argue that a\ncourt decision favoring the prosecution would violate the\nConvention (as properly interpreted), and therefore the\nConstitution forbids any such decision. See U. S. Const.,\nArt. VI, cl. 2. This argument in effect claims that the\nConvention itself provides applicable law that here would\nfavor the petitioners if, but only if, they are correct as to\ntheir interpretation of the Convention (which is, of course,\na different matter).\n  The petitioners must be right in respect to their claim\nthat the Convention provides law that here courts could\napply in their respective proceedings. The Convention is a\ntreaty. And “all Treaties made . . . under the Authority of\nthe United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land;\nand the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby.”\nU. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. As Chief Justice Marshall long\nago explained, under the Supremacy Clause a treaty is “to\nbe regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of\nthe legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the\naid of any legislative provision.” Foster, supra, at 314.\n  Directly to the point, this Court stated long ago that a\ntreaty “is a law of the land as an act of Congress is, when\never its provisions prescribe a rule by which the rights of\nthe private citizen or subject may be determined. And\nwhen such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court\nof justice,” in such a case the court is to “resor[t] to the\ntreaty for a rule of decision for the case before it as it\nwould to a statute.” Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580,\n598–599 (1884).\n  As noted above, see supra, at 8, the parties agree that\nthe Convention “operates of itself without the aid of any\n10              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlegislative provision.” Foster, supra, at 314. The question,\nthen, is the one this Court set forth in the Head Money\nCases: Does the Convention set forth a “law” with the legal\nstature of an Act of Congress? And as the Court ex\nplained, we are to answer that question by asking, does\nthe Convention “prescribe a rule by which the rights of the\nprivate citizen . . . may be determined”? Are the obliga\ntions set forth in Article 36(1)(b) “of a nature to be en\nforced in a court of justice”?\n   The “nature” of the Convention provisions raised by the\npetitioners indicates that they are intended to set forth\nstandards that are judicially enforceable. Those provi\nsions consist of the rights of a foreign national “arrested”\nor “detained in any other manner” (1) to have, on his\n“reques[t],” the “consular post” “inform[ed]” of that arrest\nor detention; (2) to have forwarded “without delay” any\n“communication addressed to the consular post”; and (3) to\nbe “inform[ed] . . . without delay” of those two “rights.”\nArt. 36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. These rights do not differ\nin their “nature” from other procedural rights that courts\ncommonly enforce. Cf. U. S. Const., Amdt. 6 (“In all crimi\nnal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to\nbe informed of the nature and cause of the accusation”);\nibid. (“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy\nthe right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his\ndefence”); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\n   Moreover, the language of Article 36 speaks directly of\nthe “rights” of the individual foreign national. See Art.\n36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (“The said authorities shall\ninform the person concerned without delay of his rights\nunder this sub-paragraph” (emphasis added)). Article 36\nthus stands in stark contrast to other provisions of the\nConvention, which speak in terms of the rights of the\nmember nations or consular officials. Cf. Art. 9, id., at 86\n(discussing “the right of any of the Contracting Parties to\nfix the designation of consular officers” (emphasis added));\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nArt. 34, id., at 98 (consular officials shall have “freedom of\nmovement and travel”); Art. 35, id., at 99 (consular offi\ncials shall have “freedom of communication”); Art. 41(1),\nid., at 103 (“Consular officers shall not be liable to arrest\nor detention pending trial”).\n    Suppose that a pre-Miranda federal statute had said\nthat arresting authorities “shall inform a detained person\nwithout delay of his right to counsel.” Would courts not\nhave automatically assumed that this statute created\napplicable law that a criminal defendant could invoke at\ntrial? What more would the statute have to say? See\nMedellín, 544 U. S., at 687 (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (“And\nif a statute were to provide, for example, that arresting\nauthorities ‘shall inform a detained person without delay\nof his right to counsel,’ ” what “more would be required” to\npermit “a defendant” to “invoke that statute”?).\n    Further, this Court has routinely permitted individuals\nto enforce treaty provisions similar to Article 36 in domes\ntic judicial proceedings. In United States v. Rauscher, 119\nU. S. 407, 410–411 (1886), for example, this Court con\ncluded that the defendant could raise as a defense in his\nfederal criminal trial the violation of an extradition treaty\nthat said, “ ‘It is agreed that the United States and Her\nBritannic Majesty shall, upon mutual requisitions by them\n. . . deliver up to justice all persons’ ” charged with certain\ncrimes in the other country. Similarly, in Kolovrat v.\nOregon, 366 U. S. 187, 191, n. 6 (1961), the Court held that\nforeign nationals could challenge a state law limiting their\nright to recover an inheritance based on a treaty providing\nthat “ ‘[i]n all that concerns the right of acquiring, possess\ning or disposing of every kind of property . . . citizens of\n[each country who reside in the other] shall enjoy the\nrights which the respective laws grant . . . in each of these\nstates to the subjects of the most favored nation.’ ” And in\nAsakura v. Seattle, 265 U. S. 332, 340 (1924), the Court\nallowed a foreign national to challenge a city ordinance\n12              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nforbidding noncitizens from working as pawnbrokers\nunder a treaty stating that “ ‘citizens or subjects of each of\nthe High Contracting Parties shall have liberty . . . to\ncarry on trade’ ” and “ ‘generally to do anything incident to\nor necessary for trade upon the same terms as native\ncitizens or subjects.’ ”\n   In all these cases, the Court recognized that (1) a treaty\nobligated the United States to treat foreign nationals in a\ncertain manner; (2) the obligation had been breached by\nthe Government’s conduct; and (3) the foreign national\ncould therefore seek redress for that breach in a judicial\nproceeding, even though the treaty did not specifically\nmention judicial enforcement of its guarantees or even\nexpressly state that its provisions were intended to confer\nrights on the foreign national. Language and context\nargue yet more strongly here in favor of permitting a\ncriminal defendant in an appropriate case to find in the\nConvention a law to apply in the proceeding against him.\n   In addition, the Government concedes that individual\nconsular officials may enforce other provisions of the Con\nvention in American courts. For example, Article 43(1)\ngrants consular officials immunity from “the jurisdiction of\nthe” host country’s “judicial or administrative authorities”\nfor “acts performed in the exercise of consular functions.”\n21 U. S. T., at 104. The federal courts have held that a\nconsular official may raise Article 43(1) in a judicial pro\nceeding, even though that provision does not expressly\nmention a judicial remedy. See, e.g., Risk v. Halvorsen,\n936 F. 2d 393, 397 (CA9 1991); Gerritsen v. de la Madrid\nHurtado, 819 F. 2d 1511, 1515–1516 (CA9 1987); see also\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 2 (citing\nwith approval these cases). What in Article 36 warrants\ntreating it differently in this respect?\n   Finally, the international tribunal that the United\nStates agreed would resolve disputes about the interpreta\ntion of the Convention, the ICJ, has twice ruled that an\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\narrested foreign national may raise a violation of the\narresting authorities’ obligation to “inform [him] without\ndelay of his rights under” Article 36(1) in an American\njudicial proceeding. See Avena, 2004 I. C. J. No. 128;\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J. 466. That conclusion, as an “inter\npretation of an international agreement by an interna\ntional court” deserves our “ ‘respectful consideration.’ ”\nAnte, at 21. That “respectful consideration,” for reasons I\nshall explain, see infra, at 18–21, counsels in favor of an\ninterpretation that is consistent with the ICJ’s reading of\nthe Convention here.\n   The Government says to the contrary that Article 36 is\n“addressed solely to the rights of States and not private\nindividuals”; hence, a foreign national may not claim in an\nAmerican court that a State has convicted him without the\nconsular notification that Article 36 requires. Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 7. But its arguments are\nnot persuasive. The Government rests this conclusion\nprimarily upon its claim that there is a “long-established\npresumption that treaties and other international agree\nments do not create judicially enforceable individual\nrights.” Id., at 11.\n   The problem with that argument is that no such pre\nsumption exists. The Government cites three cases in\nsupport of its position, Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U. S. 447,\n474 (1913); Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 195\n(1888); and Foster, 2 Pet., at 306–307. The first of these,\nCharlton, says that the question whether a treaty has\nbeen abrogated by another nation’s violations is a matter\nwith which “ ‘judicial tribunals have nothing to do.’ ” 229\nU. S., at 474. The second, Whitney, says that whether a\nsubsequent federal statute that abrogates a treaty violates\nthe United States’ treaty obligations is a matter that has\n“not been confided to the judiciary.” 124 U. S., at 195.\nThe third, Foster, says that in “a controversy between two\nnations concerning national boundary, it is scarcely possi\n14              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nble that the courts of either should refuse to abide by the\nmeasures adopted by its own government.” 2 Pet., at 307.\nWhat have these issues to do with the present one? How\ndo these cases support the presumption that the Govern\nment claims?\n   Regardless, as I have just said, see supra, at 9, the Head\nMoney Cases make clear that a treaty may confer certain\nenforceable “rights upon the citizens or subjects of one of\nthe nations residing in the territorial limits of the other.”\n112 U. S., at 598; see also 2 Restatement (Third) on For\neign Relations Law of the United States §907 (1986) (here\ninafter Restatement) (“A private person having rights\nagainst the United States under an international agree\nment may assert those rights in courts in the United\nStates”). And the language of the Convention makes clear\nthat it is such a treaty. Indeed, to my knowledge no other\nnation’s courts (or perhaps no more than one) have held to\nthe contrary. The cases cited by the respondents and the\nGovernment do not say otherwise. See Judgment of Nov.\n7, 2001, 5 BGHSt 116 (Germany) (deciding in light of\nLaGrand that the Convention creates individual rights,\nbut declining to suppress confession); Queen v. Abbrederis\n(1981) 51 F. L. R. 99, 115 (Ct. Crim. App. New South\nWales (Australia)) (deciding that Convention does not\n“affect the carrying out of an investigation by interroga\ntion of a foreign person coming to this country”). But see\nQueen v. Van Bergen [2000] 261 A. R. 387, 390 (Ct. App.\nAlberta (Canada)) (noting in dictum that the Convention\n“creates an obligation between states and is not one owed\nto the national,” but affirming denial of suppression mo\ntion on the ground that “there was in any event no proven\nprejudice to” the defendant). See also Queen v. Partak,\n[2001] 160 C. C. C. 3d 553 (Ont. Super. Ct. of J.) (applying\nVan Bergen’s “serious prejudice” test to conclude that\ndefendant’s statements were admissible); compare cases\ncited infra, at 31–32.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  The Government also points out that the Executive\nBranch’s interpretation of treaty provisions is entitled to\n“great weight.” Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagli\nano, 457 U. S. 176, 184–185 (1982). I agree with this\npresumption. But the Executive’s views on our treaty\nobligations are “not conclusive.” Ibid.; see Perkins v. Elg,\n307 U. S. 325, 328, 337–342 (1939) (declining to adopt\nExecutive’s treaty interpretation); Johnson v. Browne, 205\nU. S. 309, 319–321 (1907) (same); De Lima v. Bidwell, 182\nU. S. 1, 181, 194–199 (1901) (same). Where language, the\nnature of the right, and the ICJ’s interpretation of the\ntreaty taken separately or together so strongly point to an\nintent to confer enforceable rights upon an individual, I\ncannot find in the simple fact of the Executive Branch’s\ncontrary view sufficient reason to adopt the Government’s\ninterpretation of the Convention.\n  Accordingly, I would allow the petitioners to raise their\nclaims based on violations of the Convention in their\nrespective state-court proceedings.\n                               III\n   The more difficult issue, I believe, concerns the nature\nof the Convention’s requirements as to remedy. In par\nticular, Bustillo’s case concerns a state procedural default\nrule. When, if ever, does the Convention require a state\ncourt to set aside such a rule in order to hear a criminal\ndefendant’s claim that the police did not “inform” him of\nhis “right” to communicate with his “consular post”? Art.\n36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. The Court says that the\nanswer is “never.” See ante, at 15–25. In its view, the\nConvention does not under any circumstances trump a\nState’s ordinary procedural rules requiring a defendant to\nassert his claims at trial or lose them forever.\n   In my view, Article 36 of the Convention requires a less\nabsolute answer. Article 36 says that the rights it sets\nforth “shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\n16              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nregulations of the receiving State,” but it instantly adds,\n“subject to the proviso . . . that the said laws and regula\ntions must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for\nwhich the [Article 36] rights are . . . intended.” Art. 36(2),\n21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). The proviso means\nthat a State’s ordinary procedural default rules apply\nunless (1) the defendant’s failure to raise a Convention\nmatter (e.g., that police failed to inform him of his Article\n36 rights) can itself be traced to the failure of the police (or\nother governmental authorities) to inform the defendant of\nthose Convention rights, and (2) state law does not pro\nvide any other effective way for the defendant to raise that\nissue (say, through a claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel).\n   Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, as\nI have just noted, Article 36 says both that its rights “shall\nbe exercised in conformity with” the host country’s “laws\nand regulations” and that those “laws and regulations\nmust enable full effect to be given” to the purposes for\nwhich those rights “are intended.” This interpretation\nmakes both the “conformity” requirement and the “full\neffect” requirement meaningful.\n   Second, the Convention’s drafting history supports this\ninterpretation. The first draft of the Vienna Convention\nwas written by the International Law Commission. Arti\ncle 36(2) of that draft required only that domestic laws\n“not nullify” the rights afforded by the Convention. Draft\nArticles on Consular Relations Adopted by the Interna\ntional Law Commission at its Thirteenth Session, Art.\n36(2), reprinted in L. Lee, Vienna Convention on Consular\nRelations 237 (1966). A later amendment substituted the\n“full effect” phrase over the strenuous objection of several\nnegotiating countries whose delegates argued that the\nphrase would “modify the criminal law and regulations or\nthe criminal procedure of the receiving state.” 1 United\nNations Conference on Consular Relations, Official Re\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            17\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncords, Summary records of plenary meetings and of the\nmeetings of the First and Second Committees, U. N. Doc.\nA/CONF.25/16, ¶26, p. 38 (1963) (statement of Romania).\nSee also id., at ¶30, p. 38–39 (statement of Congo, Leo\npoldville) (amendment “implied the revision of certain\nlaws or regulations, which it would be difficult to carry out\nin practice”); id., 12th mtg., ¶4, at 40 (statement of Union\nof Soviet Socialist Republics) (rejecting the amendment\nbecause it would “force [signatories] to alter their criminal\nlaws and regulations”); id., 20th mtg., ¶81, at 84 (state\nment of Romania) (same); id., ¶95, at 86 (statement of\nCzechoslovakia) (same).\n  Based on this objection, the Soviet Union proposed\nreverting to the original language. The United Kingdom\nopposed that measure, explaining that it supported the\n“full effect” version because the initial (“not nullify”)\nversion\n     “meant that the laws and regulations of the receiving\n     State would govern the rights specified . . . provided\n     that they did not render those rights completely inop\n     erative—for ‘to nullify’ meant to ‘render completely\n     inoperative.’ But rights could be seriously impaired\n     without becoming completely inoperative. . . . Consu\n     lar officials should, of course, comply with the laws\n     and regulations of the receiving State in such matters\n     as the times for visiting prisoners, but it was most\n     important that the substance of the rights and obliga\n     tions specified . . . should be preserved.” Id., ¶¶6–7, at\n     40.\nNo one disagreed with the United Kingdom’s understand\ning of the words “full effect.” And with that understand\ning, the delegates voted down the Soviet Union’s proposal\nto revert to the original language, and ultimately adopted\nthe provision with the words “full effect.” Id., ¶109, at 87.\nAs so enacted, the provision reflects the “essential princi\n18              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nple of international law . . . ‘that reparation must, as far as\npossible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act\nand reestablish the situation which would, in all probabil\nity, have existed if that act had not been committed.’ ” 2\nRestatement §901, at 343.\n   Third, the decisions of the ICJ, fairly read, interpret the\nConvention similarly. In LaGrand and Avena, the ICJ\nread the Convention as authorizing an individual foreign\nnational to raise an Article 36 violation at trial or in a\npostconviction proceeding. See Avena, 2004 I. C. J., ¶121;\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 32–33, ¶125. The ICJ added\nthat the Convention requires member states to provide\n“effective” remedies in their courts for Convention viola\ntions. See Avena, supra, ¶138. And the ICJ made two\ncritical statements in respect to procedural default rules.\nIn LaGrand, the court said that in “itself, the [procedural\ndefault] rule does not violate Article 36 of the Vienna\nConvention.” 2001 I. C. J., at 22, ¶90 (emphasis added).\nRather, the “problem arises when the procedural default\nrule does not allow the detained individual to challenge a\nconviction and sentence by claiming . . . that the compe\ntent national authorities failed to comply with their obli\ngation to provide the requisite consular information ‘with\nout delay.’ ” Ibid. And the ICJ later specified that the\nConvention forbids American States to apply a procedural\ndefault rule to bar assertion of a Convention violation\nclaim “where it has been the failure of the United States [or\nof a State] itself to inform that may have precluded counsel\nfrom being in a position to have raised the question of a\nviolation of the Vienna Convention in the initial trial.”\nAvena, 2004 I. C. J., ¶113 (emphasis added).\n   This last statement indicates that the ICJ understood\nthe Convention to prevent application of a procedural\ndefault rule only where the arresting authorities’ failure to\ninform the foreign national of his Convention rights\nbrought about the procedural default in the first place.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nTaken together, the above statements make clear that the\nICJ read the Convention simply to require an effective\nremedy. It stated repeatedly that it did not dictate what\nthat remedy would be, as long it was offered as part of the\n“judicial process.” Id., ¶140–141. Hence, if the State\nprovides some other effective remedy, for example, review\nfor prejudice through a claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, then the Convention would not forbid application\nof ordinary procedural default rules. See ABA Guidelines\nfor the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel\nin Death Penalty Cases 10.6 (Rev. ed. 2003) (discussing\ndefense counsel’s obligation to seek consular assistance);\nValdez v. Oklahoma, 46 P. 3d 703, 710 (Okla. Crim. App.\n2002) (granting postconviction relief to a defendant who\nhad failed to raise a Vienna Convention violation at trial,\nbecause he showed that his lawyer “could have obtained\nfinancial, legal and investigative assistance from his\nconsulate” that would have produced important new evi\ndence); see also Ledezma v. State, 626 N. W. 2d 134, 152\n(Iowa 2001) (concluding that “all criminal defense attor\nneys representing foreign nationals should be aware of the\nright to consular access as provided by Article 36, and\nshould advise their clients of this right” because local\ncounsel “are not equipped to provide the same services as\nthe local consulate”); cf. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374\n(2005).\n   I will assume that the ICJ’s interpretation does not bind\nthis Court in this case. Statute of the International Court\nof Justice, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945) (ICJ\ndecisions have “binding force” only “between the parties\nand in respect of that particular case”). But as the major\nity points out, the ICJ’s decisions on this issue nonetheless\nwarrant our “ ‘respectful consideration.’ ” Ante, at 21.\nThat “respectful consideration” reflects the understanding\nthat uniformity is an important goal of treaty interpreta\ntion. See Olympic Airways v. Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 660\n20             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[I]t is reasonable to im\npute to the parties an intent that their respective courts\nstrive to interpret the treaty consistently”). And the ICJ’s\nposition as an international court specifically charged with\nthe duty to interpret numerous international treaties\n(including the Convention) provides a natural point of\nreference for national courts seeking that uniformity. See\nCounter-Memorial of the United States in Avena, 2004\nI. C. J. No. 128, p. 61, n. 128 (Nov. 3, 2003) (even if ICJ\ndecision binds only in particular case, “it is well-settled”\nthat an ICJ decision “may serve as authority beyond a\nparticular case”; citing authorities); Ordonez & Reilly,\nEffect of the Jurisprudence of the International Court of\nJustice on National Courts, in International Law Deci\nsions in National Courts 335, 365 (T. Franck & G. Fox eds.\n1996) (noting that ICJ cases interpreting treaties “are\nroutinely cited by domestic judges” in many countries “as\nevidence of international law”).\n   That “respectful consideration” also reflects an under\nstanding of the ICJ’s expertise in matters of treaty inter\npretation, a branch of international law. The ICJ’s opin\nions “are persuasive evidence” of what “[international] law\nis.” 1 Restatement §103, comment b, at 37; see also Mor\nrison, Treaties as a Source of Jurisdiction, Especially in\nU. S. Practice, in The International Court of Justice at a\nCrossroads 58, 61 (L. Damrosch ed. 1987); The Paquete\nHabana, 175 U. S. 677, 700 (1900) (“[T]rustworthy evi\ndence of what [international] law really is” can be found in\n“the works of jurists and commentators, who by years of\nlabor, research and experience have made themselves\npeculiarly well acquainted with the subjects of which they\ntreat”); L.

S. ____ (2006)           23\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand history, but also with the ICJ’s interpretation of the\nsame treaty provision. In creating this last-mentioned\nconflict, as far as I can tell, the Court’s decision is un\nprecedented.\n   The Court supports its interpretation in three basic\nways. First, the majority says that “respectful considera\ntion” does not require us to agree with a decision that is\nclearly wrong. And, it says, the ICJ’s decision is clearly\nwrong. The ICJ’s interpretation of Article 36, the major\nity says, would permit a Convention violation claim to\n“trump not only procedural default rules, but any number\nof other rules requiring parties to present their legal\nclaims at the appropriate time for adjudication.” Ante, at\n22. That interpretation, it adds, “overlooks the impor\ntance of procedural default rules in an adversary system,”\nand is “inconsistent with the basic framework” of that\n“system.” Ante, at 21–22.\n   The majority’s argument, however, overlooks what the\nICJ actually said, overstates what it actually meant, and\nis inconsistent with what it actually did. In Avena and\nLaGrand, the ICJ did not say that the Convention neces\nsarily trumps any, let alone all, procedural rules that\nwould otherwise bar assertion of a Convention violation\nclaim. Nor did it say that the Convention necessarily\ntrumps all procedural default rules. Rather, it said that\nthe Convention prohibits application of those rules to a\nConvention violation claim only “where it has been the\nfailure of the United States [or of a State] itself to inform\nthat may have precluded counsel from being in a position\nto have raised the question of a violation of the Vienna\nConvention in the initial trial.” Avena, 2004 I. C. J., ¶113\n(emphasis added). Thus, Article 36(2) precludes proce\ndural default only where the defendant’s failure to bring\nhis claim sooner is the result of the underlying violation.\nSince procedural default rules themselves typically excuse\ndefaults where a defendant shows “cause and prejudice,” it\n24             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nis difficult to see how this statement “overlooks the impor\ntance of procedural default rules in an adversary system,”\nor is “inconsistent with the basic framework” of that\n“system.”\n   Moreover, Avena and LaGrand make clear what the\nICJ’s language taken in context means: The Convention\nrequires effective national remedies; hence local proce\ndural rules must give way (to the Convention’s “full effect”\nrequirement) when, but only when, it is the failure of the\narresting authorities to inform the defendant of his Con\nvention rights that prevented the defendant from bringing\nhis claim sooner. The opinions nowhere suggest that a\nState must provide a procedural remedy to a defendant\nwho, for example, sleeps on his rights.\n   Consider, too, what the ICJ did in Avena, a case that\nclarified the court’s earlier LaGrand opinion. It did not\nhold that American courts must ignore their procedural\ndefault rules in each of the 54 individual cases at issue.\nRather, it held that domestic courts must provide “review\nand reconsideration” in each case. Avena, 2004 I. C. J.,\n¶153(9). It nowhere forbids a state court conducting such a\n“review” to bar claims not timely made provided that the\nviolation did not itself cause the delay. See id., ¶139.\n   Perhaps the ICJ’s opinions are open to different inter\npretations. But how does reading those opinions as creat\ning an extreme rule of law, as reflecting a lack of under\nstanding of the “adversary system,” show “respectful\nconsideration”? To show that kind of respect, we must\nread the opinions in light of the Convention’s underlying\nlanguage and purposes and ask whether, or to what ex\ntent, they require modification of a State’s ordinary proce\ndural rules. See Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (laws and\nregulations “must enable full effect to be given to the\npurposes for which the rights accorded under this Article\nare intended” (emphasis added)).\n   Nothing in Avena suggests, for example, that an ar\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           25\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrested foreign national who was already aware of his\nrights under Article 36, or who had a lawyer who was\naware of those rights, necessarily would be entitled to an\nexemption from the State’s procedural default rules under\nArticle 36(2). Instead, as I have explained, see supra, at\n18–19, 23, Avena says only that Article 36(2) requires a\nstate court to excuse a procedural default rule where the\nState failed to inform the defendant of his consular access\nrights, and the defendant was not aware of those rights,\nand the State is unwilling to provide some other effective\nremedy, for example (if the lawyer acts incompetently in\nrespect to Convention rights of which the lawyer was\naware) an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The\nCourt’s reluctance to give LaGrand and Avena this per\nfectly reasonable interpretation reflects a failure to pro\nvide in practice the “respectful consideration” that we all\nbelieve the law demands.\n   The Court also relies on Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371\n(1998) (per curiam). In that case a foreign national, claim\ning a Convention violation, sought federal habeas corpus.\nThis Court upheld a denial of relief on the ground that the\nlower courts had correctly found that Breard procedurally\ndefaulted his Convention violation claim by failing to\ntimely raise it in his state-court proceedings. In reaching\nits conclusion, the Court rejected Breard’s claim that the\nConvention trumped the procedural default rule. Its\nreasons were (1) that “it has been recognized in interna\ntional law that, absent a clear and express statement to\nthe contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State\ngovern the implementation of the treaty in that State,” id.,\nat 375; (2) that this principle is “embodied in the Vienna\nConvention itself, which provides that the rights ex\npressed in the Convention ‘shall be exercised in conformity\nwith the laws and regulations of the receiving State,’ ”\nibid.; and (3) that the federal procedural default rule, as a\nlater-in-time federal statute, superseded any inconsistent\n26              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprovision in the Convention, id., at 376.\n    I do not believe that Breard controls the outcome of\nthese cases. With respect to the third ground for the\nCourt’s decision, Breard concerned a federal, rather than\n(as in Bustillo’s case) a state, procedural default rule.\nThose different kinds of rules are treated differently under\nthe Supremacy Clause. See ibid. (applying the rule that\n“ ‘an Act of Congress . . . is on a full parity with a treaty,\nand . . . when a statute which is subsequent in time is\ninconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of\nconflict renders the treaty null’ ”). Contrary to JUSTICE\nGINSBURG’s view, then, ante, at 4, there is no anomaly in\ntreating state law differently from federal law for these\npurposes, if Congress chooses to enact legislation binding\nonly the federal government in respect to a matter covered\nby a treaty that binds both the federal government and\nthe States. Therefore, reading the Convention to require\nthe state courts to set aside Virginia’s procedural default\nrule in Bustillo’s case (assuming for argument’s sake that\nhis case meets the criteria I have described, see supra, at\n15–16) would not call into question, let alone overrule,\n“Breard’s plain holding that the Convention does not\ntrump the [federal] procedural default doctrine,” ante, at\n18, n. 4 (opinion of the Court), even if that ruling on its\nown terms is still good law after Avena and LaGrand.\n    Moreover, the ICJ decided Avena and LaGrand after\nthis Court decided Breard. And it is not difficult to recon\ncile those cases with Breard because they do not directly\nconflict with Breard’s result. Rather, they interpret Arti\ncle 36(2) to require state procedural default rules some\ntimes to give way to the Convention, namely, when those\nrules prevent effective remedy by barring assertion of a\nclaim because of a delay caused by the Convention viola\ntion itself. I would read Breard as consistent with this\ninterpretation, i.e., as not saying that the Convention\nnever trumps any procedural default rule.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          27\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court complains that this treatment of Breard fails\nto give our own opinions “ ‘respectful consideration.’ ”\nAnte, at 18, n. 4. In fact, our opinions are entitled to far\nmore than respectful consideration; they are entitled to\nfull stare decisis effect. But, as I have explained, reading\nBreard not to decide the outcome in this case would nei\nther overrule Breard’s holding, nor reject outright its\nreading of the Convention. And, in any event, as a matter\nof the law of stare decisis, a modified reading of Breard is\nappropriate in light of the fact that the ICJ’s later deci\nsions amount to a “significant . . . subsequent develop\nment” of the law sufficient to lead to a reconsideration of\npast precedent. Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 236\n(1997); United States v. Percheman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85813\"><a href=\"/opinion/85813/united-states-v-percheman/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1833) (revis\niting prior treaty interpretation when new international\nlaw has come to light); see also Medellín, 544 U. S., at 689\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting) (“In the past the Court has\nrevisited its interpretation of a treaty when new interna\ntional law has come to light” (citing Percheman, supra, at\n89)). Indeed, the Court seems to recognize as much, in\nthat it spends a full six pages explaining why the ICJ’s\ninterpretation of the Convention is incorrect, see ante, at\n18–24, rather than simply rejecting Bustillo’s argument on\nthe ground that “ ‘respectful consideration’ of precedent\nshould begin at home.” Ante, at 18, n. 4.\n   And there are other reasons not to place too much reli\nance on the breadth of Breard’s language. Breard is a per\ncuriam decision that the Court had to reach within the few\nhours available between the time a petition for certiorari\nwas filed and a scheduled execution, the decision is fairly\nrecent, and the modification to which I refer requires no\nmore than reading an exception into Breard’s language,\nlanguage that in any event was not central to the Court’s\nholding.\n   The modification is appropriate too because the “full\neffect” proviso in Article 36(2) provides a “clear and ex\n28              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npress statement” that sometimes the Convention might\ntrump a domestic procedural rule. And in any event, it is\nnot even clear that such a clear statement rule actually\nexists. Breard’s statement of a presumption that only a\ntreaty provision with a “clear and express statement” can\ntrump “the procedural rules of the forum State,” 523 U. S.,\nat 375, is in tension with more fundamental interpretive\nrules in this area. See, e.g., Jordan v. Tashiro, 278 U. S.\n123, 127 (1928) (treaties must be construed liberally to\nprotect substantial rights); Asakura, 265 U. S., at 342\n(same); see also Vienna Convention on the Law of Trea\nties, opened for signature May 23, 1969, Art. 27, 1115\nU. N. T. S. 331, T. S. No. 58 (1980), 8 I. L. M. 679 (1969)\n(treaty parties may not invoke domestic law as an excuse\nfor failing to conform to their treaty obligations).\n   Indeed, the cases Breard cites for the proposition that a\nclear and express statement is required to trump a domes\ntic procedural rule seem not to establish it. Sun Oil Co. v.\nWortman, 486 U. S. 717, 723 (1988) (Court said only that\nit was a “rule in international law at the time the Consti\ntution was adopted” that procedural rules “may be gov\nerned by forum law even when the substance of the claim\nmust be governed by another State’s law”; case involved\ndomestic law and the Constitution’s Full Faith and Credit\nClause); Le Roy v.

United States Dist. Court for South\nern Dist. of Iowa, 482 U. S. 522, 539–540, and n. 25 (1987)\n(case involving a specific treaty, not a general interpretive\nstandard).\n   Finally, the Court says it would be odd to treat Conven\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           29\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntion rights more favorably than rights protected by the\nU. S. Constitution. Ante, at 24. But “[a] treaty is in its\nnature a contract between two nations,” Foster, 2 Pet., at\n314, and nations are of course free to agree to grant one\nanother’s citizens protections that differ from the protec\ntions enjoyed by citizens at home, particularly when cir\ncumstances call for differential treatment. See infra, at\n30.\n   In sum, I find strong reasons for interpreting the Con\nvention as sometimes prohibiting a state court from apply\ning its ordinarily procedural default rule to a Convention\nviolation claim. The fact that the ICJ reached a similar\nconclusion in LaGrand and Avena adds strength to those\nreasons. And I cannot agree with the majority’s argu\nments to the contrary.\n   Consequently, I would remand No. 05–51 so that Busti\nllo can argue to the Virginia state courts that they should\nmodify their ordinary procedural default requirements. I\nwould leave it to the state courts to determine in the first\ninstance whether state law has provided Bustillo the\neffective remedy that the Convention requires and how it\nhas done so (whether through “cause and prejudice” excep\ntions, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, or other\nways). Cf. LaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 33, ¶125 (the “choice\nof [implementing] means must be left to the United\nStates”).\n                              IV\n  The final question presented asks whether a Convention\nviolation “result[s] in the suppression” of the evidence, say\na confession, that a foreign national provided police before\nbeing informed of his Convention rights. Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 04–10566, p. i. The majority answers in absolute\nterms, stating that “suppression is not an appropriate\nremedy for a violation of the Convention.” See ante, at 2.\nI agree with the majority insofar as it rejects the argu\n30             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nment that the Convention creates a Miranda-style “auto\nmatic exclusionary rule.” Ante, at 8; see also Miranda,\n384 U. S., at 471; cf., e.g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643\n(1961); Franks v. Delaware, 438 U. S. 154 (1978). But I do\nnot agree with the absolute nature of its statement.\nRather, sometimes suppression could prove the only effec\ntive remedy. And, if that is so, then the Convention,\nwhich insists upon effective remedies, would require sup\npression in an appropriate case. Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at\n101.\n   Much depends upon the circumstances. It may be true\nthat in “most circumstances, there is likely to be little\nconnection between an Article 36 violation and evidence or\nstatements obtained by police.” Ante, at 14. Miranda\nsurely helps, for it guarantees that police will inform an\narrested foreign national of his right to contact a lawyer.\nBut one cannot guarantee in advance that Miranda will\nadequately cure every seriously prejudicial failure to in\nform an arrested person of his right to contact his consular\npost. One can imagine a case, for example, involving a\nforeign national who speaks little English, who comes from\na country where confessions made to the police cannot be\nused in court as evidence, who does not understand that a\nstate-provided lawyer can provide him crucial assistance in\nan interrogation, and whose native community has great\nfear of police abuse. Indeed, Sanchez-Llamas made allega\ntions similar to these in his case. Brief for Petitioner San\nchez-Llamas 5-7; see also Brief for the Government of the\nUnited Mexican States as Amicus Curiae 10.\n   While JUSTICE GINSBURG is correct that a defendant\nwho is prejudiced under the Convention may be able to\nshow that his confession is involuntary under Miranda,\nante, at 2, I am not persuaded that this will always be so.\nA person who fully understands his Miranda rights but\ndoes not fully understand the implications of these rights\nfor our legal system may or may not be able to show that\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          31\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhis confession was involuntary under Miranda, but he will\ncertainly have a claim under the Vienna Convention. In\nsuch a case suppression of a confession may prove the only\neffective remedy. I would not rule out the existence of\nsuch cases in advance.\n  Furthermore, the majority is wrong to say that it would\n“be startling if the Convention were read to require sup\npression” in such cases because suppression “is an entirely\nAmerican legal creation.” Ante, at 8 (opinion of the Court).\nI put to the side the fact that “suppression” is in origin a\nBritish, not an American, remedy. See Dickerson v.\nUnited States, 530 U. S. 428, 433 (2000) (noting that “the\nroots of the [Miranda] test developed in the common law”\nand citing English cases); see also King v. Warickshall, 1\nLeach 262, 263–264, 168 Eng. Rep. 234, 235 (K. B. 1783)\n(coerced confessions are inadmissible in British courts).\nRegardless, it is not “startling” to read the Convention as\nsometimes requiring suppression. That is because those\nwho wrote the Convention were fully aware that the crimi\nnal justice systems of different nations differ in important\nways. They did not list particular remedies. They used\ngeneral language. That language requires every member\nnation to give “full effect” to Article 36(1)’s “purposes.”\nArt. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. That language leaves it up\nto each nation to determine how to implement Article\n36(1)’s requirements. Avena, 2004 I. C. J., ¶127; LaGrand,\nsupra, at 32–33, ¶125. But as a matter of logic and pur\npose that language must also insist upon the use of sup\npression if and when there are circumstances in which\nsuppression provides the only effective remedy.\n  These differences may also help to explain what the\nmajority says is the disturbing circumstance that “nearly\nall” other signatories to the Convention “refuse to recog\nnize” suppression “as a matter of domestic law,” and there\nfore that “Sanchez-Llamas would [not] be afforded the\nrelief he seeks here in any of the other 169 countries party\n32             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto the Vienna Convention.” Ante, at 9. In fact, there are\nseveral cases from common-law jurisdictions suggesting\nthat suppression is an appropriate remedy for a Conven\ntion violation. See, e.g., Tan Seng Kiah v. Queen (2001)\n160 F. L. R. 26 (Ct. Crim. App. N. Terr.) (Australian case\nsuppressing confession obtained in violation of statute\nrequiring police to notify defendant of right to contact\nconsulate upon arrest); Queen v. Tan [2001] W. A. S. C.\n275 (Sup. Ct. W. Australia in Crim.) (Australian case\nconsidering but declining to suppress evidence based on\nviolation of same statute); Regina v. Partak, 160 C. C. C.\n3d, at ¶63 (Canada) (concluding that suppression is inap\npropriate, not because it was never a proper remedy under\nthe Vienna Convention but because the defendant “com\npletely failed to demonstrate any prejudice arising from\nthe failure of the police to notify him of his consular\nrights”).\n   I concede the absence of such cases from civil law juris\ndictions. But the criminal justice systems in those nations\ndiffer from our own in significant ways. Civil-law nations,\nfor example, typically rely more heavily than do we upon\njudicial investigation, questioning by a neutral magistrate,\nthe compiling of all evidence into a dossier, and later\nreview of that dossier at trial by judges who may sit with\nout our type of jury. In such a system, formal suppression\nproceedings may prove less frequent. Judges, as a matter\nof practice, may simply disregard improperly obtained\nevidence, they may discount the significance of that evi\ndence, or they may adjust the nature of future proceedings\nor even the final sentence accordingly.

The\nexistence of cases in such nations where a court denies a\ndefense request to suppress, of course, might well shed\nlight on that nation’s readiness to provide an effective\nremedy.

OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsomehow the petitioners here are asking the United States\nto provide that which other countries deny, an effective\nremedy.\n                               V\n   The United States joined the Vienna Convention, and\nurged other nations to join, in order to promote “the or\nderly and effective conduct of consular relations between\nStates,” and to guarantee “the protection of our citizens\nabroad.” Vienna Convention on Consular Relations with\nOptional Protocol, S. Exec. Doc. No. E, 91st Cong., 1st\nSess., 60, 75 (1969). In doing so, the United States, along\nwith the other 169 nations that ratified the Convention,\nundertook a complex task. They sought not only to protect\ntheir consular posts, but also to assure that their nationals\nwould have access to those posts when arrested abroad.\nBut how to enforce those rights poses a difficult question\nbecause the enforcement mechanism inevitably will vary\ndepending upon the details of a nation’s legal system. For\npractical, legal, and political, reasons, it is difficult to\nwrite enforcement details into an international treaty.\nYet without any such guarantees it may prove difficult to\nprevent an individual nation, through application of its\nsystem’s details, from denying in practice the rights that\nthe treaty sought to assure.\n   The Convention deals with this problem by including a\ngeneral provision that both severely limits the treaty’s\nintrusion into the functioning of a domestic legal system\nand also safeguards consular access rights from serious\ndomestic neglect. It does so by stating that those rights\nshall “be exercised in conformity with the laws and regula\ntions of the receiving State,” provided that those laws and\nregulations give “full effect” to Article 36(1)’s purposes.\nArt. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101.\n   Applying this provision to our own legal system, I would\nseek to minimize the Convention’s intrusion and federal\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

That is why I believe that the Convention here\nrequires individual States to make an exception (akin to a\n“cause and prejudice” exception) to a state procedural\ndefault rule if (1) the defendant’s failure to raise a claim of\na Convention violation in a timely manner itself was a\nproduct of that violation, and (2) state law provides no\nother procedural means through which the State’s courts\ncan provide “review,” “reconsideration,” and effective\nrelief. Similarly, I would hold that whether the Conven\ntion requires a state court to suppress a confession ob\ntained after an Article 36 violation depends on whether\nsuppression is the only remedy available that will effec\ntively cure related prejudice. And because neither state\ncourt applied this standard below, I would remand each\ncase for that initial consideration. See 338 Ore., at 269,\n108 P. 3d, at 574 (rejecting Sanchez-Llamas’ request for\nsuppression remedy solely on the ground that the Conven\ntion “does not create rights that individual foreign nation\nals may assert in a criminal proceeding”); App. to Pet. for\nCert. 47a (rejecting Bustillo’s request for state postconvic\ntion relief based on a standard different from that set forth\nhere).\n   The interpretation of the Convention that I would adopt\nis consistent with the ICJ’s own interpretation and should\nnot impose significant new burdens upon state criminal\njustice systems. America’s legal traditions have long\nincluded detailed rules for discovering and curing prejudi\ncial legal errors. Indeed, many States already have “cause\nand prejudice” exceptions likely broad enough to provide\nthe “effective” relief the Convention demands. And, in any\nevent, it leaves the States free to apply their own judicial\nremedies in light of, and bounded by, the Convention’s\ngeneral instructions.\n   The Court, I fear, does not rise to the interpretive chal\n36              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlenge. Rather than seek to apply Article 36’s language\nand purposes to the federal/state relationships that char\nacterize America’s legal system, it simply rejects the no\ntion that Article 36(2) sets forth any relevant requirement.\nThat approach leaves States free to deny effective relief for\nConvention violations, despite America’s promise to pro\nvide just such relief. That approach risks weakening\nrespect abroad for the rights of foreign nationals, a respect\nthat America, in 1969, sought to make effective through\nout the world. And it increases the difficulties faced by\nthe United States and other nations who would, through\nbinding treaties, strengthen the role that law can play in\nassuring all citizens, including American citizens, fair\ntreatment throughout the world.\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145628, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2006/06/28/Sanchez-Llamas_v._Oregon.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2005                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 29, 2006—Decided June 28, 2006*\nArticle 36(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations pro\n  vides that if a person detained by a foreign country “so requests, the\n  competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, in\n  form the consular post of the sending State” of such detention, and\n  “inform the [detainee] of his rights under this sub-paragraph.” Arti\n  cle 36(2) specifies: “The rights referred to in paragraph 1 . . . shall be\n  exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving\n  State, subject to the proviso . . . that the said laws . . . must enable\n  full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded\n  under this Article are intended.” Along with the Convention, the\n  United States ratified the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compul\n  sory Settlement of Disputes, which provides: “Disputes arising out of\n  the . . . Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the\n  International Court of Justice [(ICJ)].” The United States withdrew\n  from the Protocol on March 7, 2005.\n     Petitioner in No. 04–10566, Moises Sanchez-Llamas, is a Mexican\n  national.

During interrogation, he\n  made incriminating statements regarding the shootout. Before his\n  trial for attempted murder and other offenses, Sanchez-Llamas\n  moved to suppress those statements on the ground, inter alia, that\n  the authorities had failed to comply with Article 36.

He was convicted and sentenced to prison, and his convic\n    tion and sentence were affirmed on appeal. He then filed a habeas\n    petition in state court arguing, for the first time, that authorities had\n    violated his right to consular notification under Article 36. The court\n    dismissed that claim as procedurally barred because he had failed to\n    raise it at trial or on appeal. The Virginia Supreme Court found no\n    reversible error.\nHeld: Even assuming without deciding that the Convention creates\n judicially enforceable rights, suppression is not an appropriate rem\n edy for a violation, and a State may apply its regular procedural de\n fault rules to Convention claims. Pp. 7–25.\n     (a) Because petitioners are not in any event entitled to relief, the\n Court need not resolve whether the Convention grants individuals\n enforceable rights, but assumes, without deciding, that Article 36\n does so. Pp. 7–8.\n     (b) Neither the Convention itself nor this Court’s precedents apply\n ing the exclusionary rule support suppression of a defendant’s state\n ments to police as a remedy for an Article 36 violation.\n     The Convention does not mandate suppression or any other specific\n remedy, but expressly leaves Article 36’s implementation to domestic\n law: Article 36 rights must “be exercised in conformity with the laws\n . . . of the receiving State.” Art. 36(2). Sanchez-Llamas’ argument\n that suppression is appropriate under United States law and should\n be required under the Court’s authority to develop remedies for the\n enforcement of federal law in state-court criminal proceedings is re\n jected. “It is beyond dispute that [this Court does] not hold a super\n visory power over the [state] courts.” Dickerson v. United States, 530\n U. S. 428, 438. The exclusionary rule cases on which Sanchez-Llamas\n principally relies are inapplicable because they rest on the Court’s\n supervisory authority over federal courts.\n     The Court’s authority to create a judicial remedy applicable in\n state court must therefore lie, if anywhere, in the treaty itself.\n Where a treaty provides for a particular judicial remedy, courts must\n apply it as a requirement of federal law. Cf., e.g., United States v.\n Giordano, 416 U. S. 505, 524–525. But where a treaty does not pro\n vide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it is not for\n the federal courts to impose one on the States through lawmaking of\n their own. Even if the “full effect” language of Article 36(2) implicitly\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nrequires a judicial remedy, as Sanchez-Llamas claims, that Article\nequally requires that Article 36(1) rights be exercised in conformity\nwith domestic law. Under domestic law, the exclusionary rule is not\na remedy this Court applies lightly. It has been used primarily to de\nter certain Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations, including, e.g.,\nunconstitutional searches and seizures, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643,\n655–657, and confessions exacted in violation of the right against\ncompelled self-incrimination or due process, Dickerson, supra, at 435.\nIn contrast, Article 36 has nothing to do with searches or interroga\ntions and, indeed, does not guarantee defendants any assistance at\nall. It secures for foreign nationals only the right to have their consu\nlate informed of their arrest or detention—not to have their consulate\nintervene, or to have police cease their investigation pending any\nsuch notice or intervention. Moreover, the failure to inform a defen\ndant of his Article 36 rights is unlikely, with any frequency, to pro\nduce unreliable confessions, see Watkins v. Sowders, 449 U. S. 341,\n347, or to give the police any practical advantage in obtaining in\ncriminating evidence, see Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 217.\nSuppression would also be a vastly disproportionate remedy for an\nArticle 36 violation. The interests Sanchez-Llamas claims Article 36\nadvances are effectively protected by other constitutional and statu\ntory requirements, including the right to an attorney and to protec\ntion against compelled self-incrimination. Finally, suppression is not\nthe only means of vindicating Article 36 rights. For example, diplo\nmatic avenues—the primary means of enforcing the Vienna Conven\ntion—remain open. Pp. 8–15.\n   (c) States may subject Article 36 claims to the same procedural de\nfault rules that apply generally to other federal-law claims.\n   This question is controlled by the Court’s holding in Breard v.\nGreene, 523 U. S. 371, 375, that the petitioner’s failure to raise an Ar\nticle 36 claim in state court prevented him from having the claim\nheard in a subsequent federal habeas proceeding. Bustillo’s two rea\nsons why Breard does not control are rejected.\n   First, he argues that Breard’s procedural default holding was un\nnecessary to the result because the petitioner there could not demon\nstrate prejudice from the default and because, in any event, the later\nenacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 su\nperseded any right the petitioner had under the Vienna Convention\nto have his claim heard on collateral review. Resolution of the proce\ndural default question, however, was the principal reason for denying\nthe Breard petitioner’s claim, and the discussion of the issue occupied\nthe bulk of the Court’s reasoning. See 523 U. S., at 375–377. It is no\nanswer to argue that the procedural default holding was unnecessary\nsimply because the petitioner had several other ways to lose.\n4                     SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       Second, Bustillo asserts that since Breard, the ICJ’s LaGrand and\n    Avena decisions have interpreted the Convention to preclude the ap\n    plication of procedural default rules to Article 36 claims. Although\n    the ICJ’s interpretation deserves “respectful consideration,” Breard,\n    supra, at 375, it does not compel the Court to reconsider Breard’s un\n    derstanding of the Convention. “The judicial Power of the United\n    States” is “vested in one supreme Court . . . and . . . inferior courts.”\n    U. S. Const., Art. III, §1. That “power . . . extend[s] to . . . treaties,”\n    Art. III, §2, and includes the duty “to say what the law is,” Marbury\n    v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177. If treaties are to be given effect as\n    federal law, determining their meaning as a matter of federal law “is\n    emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department,”\n    headed by the “one supreme Court.” Ibid. Nothing in the ICJ’s\n    structure or purpose suggests that its interpretations were intended\n    to be binding on U. S. courts. Even according “respectful considera\n    tion,” the ICJ’s interpretation cannot overcome the plain import of\n    Article 36(2), which states that the rights it implements “shall be ex\n    ercised in conformity with the laws . . . of the receiving State.” In the\n    United States, this means that the rule of procedural default—which\n    applies even to claimed violations of our own Constitution, see Engle\n    v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129—applies also to Vienna Convention\n    claims. Bustillo points to nothing in the drafting history of Article 36\n    or in the contemporary practice of other Convention signatories that\n    undermines this conclusion. LaGrand’s conclusion that applying the\n    procedural default rule denies “full effect” to the purposes of Article\n    36, by preventing courts from attaching legal significance to an Arti\n    cle 36 violation, is inconsistent with the basic framework of an adver\n    sary system. Such a system relies chiefly on the parties to raise sig\n    nificant issues and present them to the courts in the appropriate\n    manner at the appropriate time for adjudication. See Castro v.\n    United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386. Procedural default rules generally\n    take on greater importance in an adversary system than in the sort of\n    magistrate-directed, inquisitorial legal system characteristic of many\n    of the other Convention signatories. Under the ICJ’s reading of “full\n    effect,” Article 36 claims could trump not only procedural default\n    rules, but any number of other rules requiring parties to present\n    their legal claims at the appropriate time for adjudication, such as\n    statutes of limitations and prohibitions against filing successive ha\n    beas petitions. This sweeps too broadly, for it reads the “full effect”\n    proviso in a way that leaves little room for the clear instruction in\n    Article 36(2) that Article 36 rights “be exercised in conformity with\n    the laws . . . of the receiving State.” A comparison with a suspect’s\n    rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, disposes of Bustillo’s\n    “full effect” claim. Although the failure to inform defendants of their\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  right to consular notification may prevent them from becoming aware\n  of their Article 36 rights and asserting them at trial, precisely the\n  same thing is true of Miranda rights. Nevertheless, if a defendant\n  fails to raise his Miranda claim at trial, procedural default rules may\n  bar him from raising the claim in a subsequent postconviction pro\n  ceeding. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87. Bustillo’s attempt to\n  analogize an Article 36 claim to a claim under Brady v. Maryland,\n  373 U. S. 83, that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evi\n  dence is inapt. Finally, his argument that Article 36 claims are most\n  appropriately raised post-trial or on collateral review under Massaro\n  v. United States, 538 U. S. 500, is rejected. See Dickerson, supra, at\n  438. Pp. 15–25.\n     (d) The Court’s holding in no way disparages the Convention’s im\n  portance.

These consolidated cases\nconcern the availability of judicial relief for violations of\nArticle 36. We are confronted with three questions.

Second, does a violation of\nArticle 36 require suppression of a defendant’s statements\n2                  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto police? Third, may a State, in a postconviction proceed\ning, treat a defendant’s Article 36 claim as defaulted\nbecause he failed to raise the claim at trial? We conclude,\neven assuming the Convention creates judicially enforce\nable rights, that suppression is not an appropriate remedy\nfor a violation of Article 36, and that a State may apply its\nregular rules of procedural default to Article 36 claims.\nWe therefore affirm the decisions below.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The Vienna Convention was drafted in 1963 with the\npurpose, evident in its preamble, of “contribut[ing] to the\ndevelopment of friendly relations among nations, irrespec\ntive of their differing constitutional and social systems.”\n21 U.

No. 6820.\nThe Optional Protocol provides that “[d]isputes arising out\nof the interpretation or application of the Convention shall\nlie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International\nCourt of Justice [(ICJ)],” and allows parties to the Protocol\nto bring such disputes before the ICJ.

In December 1999, he was involved in an exchange\nof gunfire with police in which one officer suffered a gun\nshot wound in the leg. Police arrested Sanchez-Llamas\nand gave him warnings under Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU. S. 436 (1966), in both English and Spanish. At no time,\nhowever, did they inform him that he could ask to have\nthe Mexican Consulate notified of his detention.\n   Shortly after the arrest and Miranda warnings, police\ninterrogated Sanchez-Llamas with the assistance of an\ninterpreter. In the course of the interrogation, Sanchez-\nLlamas made several incriminating statements regarding\nthe shootout with police. He was charged with attempted\naggravated murder, attempted murder, and several other\noffenses. Before trial, Sanchez-Llamas moved to suppress\nthe statements he made to police. He argued that sup\npression was warranted because the statements were\nmade involuntarily and because the authorities had failed\nto comply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. The\ntrial court denied the motion. The case proceeded to trial,\nand Sanchez-Llamas was convicted and sentenced to 201⁄2\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The\nOregon Court of Appeals affirmed. Judgt. order reported\nat 191 Ore. App. 399, 84 P. 3d 1133 (2004). The Oregon\nSupreme Court also affirmed, concluding that Article 36\n“does not create rights to consular access or notification\nthat are enforceable by detained individuals in a judicial\nproceeding.” 338 Ore. 267, 276, 108 P. 3d 573, 578 (2005)\n(en banc). We granted certiorari. 546 U. S. ___ (2005).\n                               C\n  Petitioner Mario Bustillo, a Honduran national, was\nwith several other men at a restaurant in Springfield,\nVirginia, on the night of December 10, 1997. That eve\nning, outside the restaurant, James Merry was struck in\nthe head with a baseball bat as he stood smoking a ciga\nrette. He died several days later. Several witnesses at the\nscene identified Bustillo as the assailant. Police arrested\nBustillo the morning after the attack and eventually\ncharged him with murder. Authorities never informed\nhim that he could request to have the Honduran Consu\nlate notified of his detention.\n  At trial, the defense pursued a theory that another man,\nknown as “Sirena,” was responsible for the attack. Two\ndefense witnesses testified that Bustillo was not the killer.\nOne of the witnesses specifically identified the attacker as\nSirena. In addition, a third defense witness stated that\nshe had seen Sirena on a flight to Honduras the day after\nthe victim died. In its closing argument before the jury,\nthe prosecution dismissed the defense theory about Si\nrena. See App. in No. 05–51, p. 21 (“This whole Sirena\nthing, I don’t want to dwell on it too much. It’s very con\nvenient that Mr. Sirena apparently isn’t available”). A\njury convicted Bustillo of first-degree murder, and he was\nsentenced to 30 years in prison. His conviction and sen\n6                  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntence were affirmed on appeal.\n   After his conviction became final, Bustillo filed a peti\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. There, for\nthe first time, he argued that authorities had violated his\nright to consular notification under Article 36 of the Vi\nenna Convention. He claimed that if he had been advised\nof his right to confer with the Honduran Consulate, he\n“would have done so without delay.” App. in No. 05–51,\np. 60. Moreover, the Honduran Consulate executed an\naffidavit stating that “it would have endeavoured to help\nMr. Bustillo in his defense” had it learned of his detention\nprior to trial. Id., at 74. Bustillo insisted that the consu\nlate could have helped him locate Sirena prior to trial. His\nhabeas petition also argued, as part of a claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel, that his attorney should have advised\nhim of his right to notify the Honduran Consulate of his\narrest and detention.2\n   The state habeas court dismissed Bustillo’s Vienna\nConvention claim as “procedurally barred” because he had\nfailed to raise the issue at trial or on appeal. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. in No. 05–51, p. 43a. The court also denied Bust\nillo’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, ruling that\n\n——————\n  2 Bustillo’s habeas petition also presented newly acquired evidence\n\nthat tended to cast doubt on his conviction. Most notably, he produced\na secretly recorded videotape in which Sirena admitted killing Merry\nand stated that Bustillo had been wrongly convicted. App. in No. 05–\n51, pp. 38, 54. In addition, Bustillo argued that the prosecution vio\nlated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), by failing to disclose that\non the night of the crime, police had questioned a man named “Julio C.\nOsorto,” who is now known to be the same man as “Sirena.” The police\nreport concerning the encounter stated that Sirena appeared to have\nketchup on his pants. Bustillo contends that these stains might in fact\nhave been the victim’s blood. The Commonwealth disputes this. The\nstate habeas court found “no evidence of any transfer of the victim’s\nblood to the assailant,” and concluded that the undisclosed encounter\nbetween police and Sirena was not material under Brady.

Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). App. in No.\n05–51, p. 132.

S. ___ (2005).\n                               II\n   We granted certiorari as to three questions presented in\nthese cases: (1) whether Article 36 of the Vienna Conven\ntion grants rights that may be invoked by individuals in a\njudicial proceeding; (2) whether suppression of evidence is\na proper remedy for a violation of Article 36; and (3)\nwhether an Article 36 claim may be deemed forfeited\nunder state procedural rules because a defendant failed to\nraise the claim at trial.\n   As a predicate to their claims for relief, Sanchez-Llamas\nand Bustillo each argue that Article 36 grants them an\nindividually enforceable right to request that their consu\nlar officers be notified of their detention, and an accompa\nnying right to be informed by authorities of the availabil\nity of consular notification. Respondents and the United\nStates, as amicus curiae, strongly dispute this contention.\nThey argue that “there is a presumption that a treaty will\nbe enforced through political and diplomatic channels,\nrather than through the courts.” Brief for United States 11;\nibid. (quoting Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580, 598 (1884)\n(a treaty “ ‘is primarily a compact between independent\nnations,’ ” and “ ‘depends for the enforcement of its provi\nsions on the interest and the honor of the governments\nwhich are parties to it’ ”)). Because we conclude that\nSanchez-Llamas and Bustillo are not in any event entitled\n8               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto relief on their claims, we find it unnecessary to resolve\nthe question whether the Vienna Convention grants indi\nviduals enforceable rights. Therefore, for purposes of\naddressing petitioners’ claims, we assume, without decid\ning, that Article 36 does grant Bustillo and Sanchez-\nLlamas such rights.\n                               A\n   Sanchez-Llamas argues that the trial court was re\nquired to suppress his statements to police because au\nthorities never told him of his rights under Article 36. He\nrefrains, however, from arguing that the Vienna Conven\ntion itself mandates suppression. We think this a wise\nconcession. The Convention does not prescribe specific\nremedies for violations of Article 36. Rather, it expressly\nleaves the implementation of Article 36 to domestic law:\nRights under Article 36 are to “be exercised in conformity\nwith the laws and regulations of the receiving State.” Art.\n36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. As far as the text of the Conven\ntion is concerned, the question of the availability of the\nexclusionary rule for Article 36 violations is a matter of\ndomestic law.\n   It would be startling if the Convention were read to\nrequire suppression. The exclusionary rule as we know it\nis an entirely American legal creation. See Bivens v. Six\nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 415 (1971)\n(Burger, C. J., dissenting) (the exclusionary rule “is unique\nto American jurisprudence”). More than 40 years after the\ndrafting of the Convention, the automatic exclusionary\nrule applied in our courts is still “universally rejected” by\nother countries. Bradley, Mapp Goes Abroad, 52 Case W.\nRes. L. Rev. 375, 399–400 (2001); see also Zicherman v.\nKorean Air Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217, 226 (1996) (postratifica\ntion understanding “traditionally considered” as an aid to\ntreaty interpretation). It is implausible that other signato\nries to the Convention thought it to require a remedy that\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

According to the Harty Declaration, the\nAmerican Embassy in Brazil has been advised that Brazil considers\nconsular notification to be a right under the Brazilian Constitution.\nNeither the declaration nor the parties point to a case in which a\nBrazilian court has suppressed evidence because of a violation of that\nright.\n   In a few cases, as several amici point out, the United Kingdom and\nAustralia appear to have applied a discretionary rule of exclusion for\nviolations of domestic statutes implementing the Vienna Convention.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26, and n. 9; Brief for\nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae\n16–23.

OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n04–10566, p. 11.\n  For their part, the State of Oregon and the United\nStates, as amicus curiae, contend that we lack any such\nauthority over state-court proceedings. They argue that\nour cases suppressing evidence obtained in violation of\nfederal statutes are grounded in our supervisory authority\nover the federal courts—an authority that does not extend\nto state-court proceedings. Brief for Respondent in No.\n04–10566, pp. 42–43; Brief for United States 32–34; see\nMcNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, 341 (1943) (sup\npressing evidence for violation of federal statute requiring\npersons arrested without a warrant to be promptly pre\nsented to a judicial officer); Mallory v. United States, 354\nU. S. 449 (1957) (suppressing evidence for violation of simi\nlar requirement of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(a)); Miller v.\nUnited States, 357 U. S. 301 (1958) (suppressing evidence\nobtained incident to an arrest that violated 18 U. S. C.\n§3109). Unless required to do so by the Convention itself,\nthey argue, we cannot direct Oregon courts to exclude\nSanchez-Llamas’ statements from his criminal trial.\n  To the extent Sanchez-Llamas argues that we should\ninvoke our supervisory authority, the law is clear: “It is\nbeyond dispute that we do not hold a supervisory power\nover the courts of the several States.” Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 438 (2000); see also Smith v. Phillips,\n455 U. S. 209, 221 (1982) (“Federal courts hold no supervi\nsory authority over state judicial proceedings and may\nintervene only to correct wrongs of constitutional dimen\nsion”). The cases on which Sanchez-Llamas principally\nrelies are inapplicable in light of the limited reach of our\nsupervisory powers. Mallory and McNabb plainly rest on\nour supervisory authority.        Mallory, supra, at 453;\nMcNabb, supra, at 340. And while Miller is not clear\nabout its authority for requiring suppression, we have\nunderstood it to have a similar basis. See Ker v. Califor\nnia, 374 U. S. 23, 31 (1963).\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   We also agree with the State of Oregon and the United\nStates that our authority to create a judicial remedy appli\ncable in state court must lie, if anywhere, in the treaty itself.\nUnder the Constitution, the President has the power, “by\nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make\nTreaties.” Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The United States ratified the\nConvention with the expectation that it would be inter\npreted according to its terms. See Restatement (Third) of\nForeign Relations Law of the United States §325(1) (1986)\n(“An international agreement is to be interpreted in good\nfaith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to\nits terms in their context and in the light of its object and\npurpose”). If we were to require suppression for Article 36\nviolations without some authority in the Convention, we\nwould in effect be supplementing those terms by enlarging\nthe obligations of the United States under the Convention.\nThis is entirely inconsistent with the judicial function. Cf.\nThe Amiable Isabella, 6 Wheat. 1, 71 (1821) (Story, J.) (“[T]o\nalter, amend, or add to any treaty, by inserting any clause,\nwhether small or great, important or trivial, would be on our\npart an usurpation of power, and not an exercise of judicial\nfunctions. It would be to make, and not to construe a\ntreaty”).\n   Of course, it is well established that a self-executing\ntreaty binds the States pursuant to the Supremacy Clause,\nand that the States therefore must recognize the force of the\ntreaty in the course of adjudicating the rights of litigants.\nSee, e.g., Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U. S. 483 (1880). And\nwhere a treaty provides for a particular judicial remedy,\nthere is no issue of intruding on the constitutional pre\nrogatives of the States or the other federal branches.\nCourts must apply the remedy as a requirement of federal\nlaw. Cf. 18 U. S. C. §2515; United States v. Giordano, 416\nU. S. 505, 524–525 (1974). But where a treaty does not\nprovide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it\nis not for the federal courts to impose one on the States\n12              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough lawmaking of their own.\n   Sanchez-Llamas argues that the language of the Con\nvention implicitly requires a judicial remedy because it\nstates that the laws and regulations governing the exer\ncise of Article 36 rights “must enable full effect to be given\nto the purposes for which the rights . . . are intended,” Art.\n36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). In his view,\nalthough “full effect” may not automatically require an\nexclusionary rule, it does require an appropriate judicial\nremedy of some kind. There is reason to doubt this inter\npretation. In particular, there is little indication that\nother parties to the Convention have interpreted Article\n36 to require a judicial remedy in the context of criminal\nprosecutions. See Department of State Answers to Ques\ntions Posed by the First Circuit in United States v. Nai\nFook Li, No. 97–2034 etc., p. A–9 (Oct. 15, 1999) (“We are\nunaware of any country party to the [Vienna Convention]\nthat provides remedies for violations of consular notifica\ntion through its domestic criminal justice system”).\n   Nevertheless, even if Sanchez-Llamas is correct that\nArticle 36 implicitly requires a judicial remedy, the Con\nvention equally states that Article 36 rights “shall be\nexercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of\nthe receiving State.” Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. Under\nour domestic law, the exclusionary rule is not a remedy we\napply lightly. “[O]ur cases have repeatedly emphasized\nthat the rule’s ‘costly toll’ upon truth-seeking and law\nenforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those\nurging application of the rule.” Pennsylvania Bd. of Proba\ntion and Parole v. Scott, 524 U. S. 357, 364–365 (1998).\nBecause the rule’s social costs are considerable, suppres\nsion is warranted only where the rule’s “ ‘remedial objec\ntives are thought most efficaciously served.’ ” United\nStates v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 908 (1984) (quoting United\nStates v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 348 (1974)).\n   We have applied the exclusionary rule primarily to deter\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstitutional violations. In particular, we have ruled that\nthe Constitution requires the exclusion of evidence ob\ntained by certain violations of the Fourth Amendment, see\nTaylor v. Alabama, 457 U. S. 687, 694 (1982) (arrests in\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment); Mapp v. Ohio, 367\nU. S. 643, 655–657 (1961) (unconstitutional searches and\nseizures), and confessions exacted by police in violation of\nthe right against compelled self-incrimination or due proc\ness, see Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 435 (failure to give Miranda\nwarnings); Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560, 568 (1958)\n(involuntary confessions).\n   The few cases in which we have suppressed evidence for\nstatutory violations do not help Sanchez-Llamas. In those\ncases, the excluded evidence arose directly out of statutory\nviolations that implicated important Fourth and Fifth\nAmendment interests. McNabb, for example, involved the\nsuppression of incriminating statements obtained during a\nprolonged detention of the defendants, in violation of a\nstatute requiring persons arrested without a warrant to be\npromptly presented to a judicial officer. We noted that the\nstatutory right was intended to “avoid all the evil implica\ntions of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime,”\n318 U. S., at 344, and later stated that McNabb was “re\nsponsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment\npolicy that . . . face[d] us . . . as to the states” in Miranda,\n384 U. S., at 463. Similarly, in Miller, we required sup\npression of evidence that was the product of a search\nincident to an unlawful arrest. 357 U. S., at 305; see\nCalifornia v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621, 624 (1991) (“We have\nlong understood that the Fourth Amendment’s protection\nagainst ‘unreasonable . . . seizures’ includes seizure of the\nperson”).\n   The violation of the right to consular notification, in\ncontrast, is at best remotely connected to the gathering of\nevidence. Article 36 has nothing whatsoever to do with\nsearches or interrogations. Indeed, Article 36 does not\n14              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nguarantee defendants any assistance at all. The provision\nsecures only a right of foreign nationals to have their\nconsulate informed of their arrest or detention—not to\nhave their consulate intervene, or to have law enforcement\nauthorities cease their investigation pending any such\nnotice or intervention. In most circumstances, there is\nlikely to be little connection between an Article 36 viola\ntion and evidence or statements obtained by police.\n   Moreover, the reasons we often require suppression for\nFourth and Fifth Amendment violations are entirely\nabsent from the consular notification context. We require\nexclusion of coerced confessions both because we disap\nprove of such coercion and because such confessions tend\nto be unreliable. Watkins v. Sowders, 449 U. S. 341, 347\n(1981). We exclude the fruits of unreasonable searches on\nthe theory that without a strong deterrent, the constraints\nof the Fourth Amendment might be too easily disregarded\nby law enforcement. Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S.\n206, 217 (1960). The situation here is quite different. The\nfailure to inform a defendant of his Article 36 rights is\nunlikely, with any frequency, to produce unreliable confes\nsions. And unlike the search-and-seizure context—where\nthe need to obtain valuable evidence may tempt authori\nties to transgress Fourth Amendment limitations—police\nwin little, if any, practical advantage from violating Arti\ncle 36. Suppression would be a vastly disproportionate\nremedy for an Article 36 violation.\n   Sanchez-Llamas counters that the failure to inform\ndefendants of their right to consular notification gives\nthem “a misleadingly incomplete picture of [their] legal\noptions,” Brief for Petitioner in No. 04–10566, p. 42, and\nthat suppression will give authorities an incentive to abide\nby Article 36.\n   Leaving aside the suggestion that it is the role of police\ngenerally to advise defendants of their legal options, we\nthink other constitutional and statutory requirements\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neffectively protect the interests served, in Sanchez-Llamas’\nview, by Article 36. A foreign national detained on suspi\ncion of crime, like anyone else in our country, enjoys under\nour system the protections of the Due Process Clause.\nAmong other things, he is entitled to an attorney, and is\nprotected against compelled self-incrimination. See Wong\nWing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 238 (1896) (“[A]ll\npersons within the territory of the United States are enti\ntled to the protection guaranteed by” the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments). Article 36 adds little to these “legal options,”\nand we think it unnecessary to apply the exclusionary rule\nwhere other constitutional and statutory protections—many\nof them already enforced by the exclusionary rule—\nsafeguard the same interests Sanchez-Llamas claims are\nadvanced by Article 36.\n   Finally, suppression is not the only means of vindicating\nVienna Convention rights. A defendant can raise an\nArticle 36 claim as part of a broader challenge to the\nvoluntariness of his statements to police. If he raises an\nArticle 36 violation at trial, a court can make appropriate\naccommodations to ensure that the defendant secures, to\nthe extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance. Of\ncourse, diplomatic avenues—the primary means of enforc\ning the Convention—also remain open.\n   In sum, neither the Vienna Convention itself nor our\nprecedents applying the exclusionary rule support sup\npression of Sanchez-Llamas’ statements to police.\n                             B\n  The Virginia courts denied petitioner Bustillo’s Article\n36 claim on the ground that he failed to raise it at trial or\non direct appeal. The general rule in federal habeas cases\nis that a defendant who fails to raise a claim on direct\nappeal is barred from raising the claim on collateral re\nview. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S. 500, 504\n(2003); Bousley v. United States, 523 U. S. 614, 621 (1998).\n16              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThere is an exception if a defendant can demonstrate both\n“cause” for not raising the claim at trial, and “prejudice”\nfrom not having done so. Massaro, supra, at 504. Like\nmany States, Virginia applies a similar rule in state post-\nconviction proceedings, and did so here to bar Bustillo’s\nVienna Convention claim. Normally, in our review of\nstate-court judgments, such rules constitute an adequate\nand independent state-law ground preventing us from\nreviewing the federal claim. Coleman v. Thompson, 501\nU. S. 722, 729 (1991). Bustillo contends, however, that\nstate procedural default rules cannot apply to Article 36\nclaims. He argues that the Convention requires that\nArticle 36 rights be given “ ‘full effect’ ” and that Virginia’s\nprocedural default rules “prevented any effect (much less\n‘full effect’) from being given to” those rights. Brief for\nPetitioner in No. 05–51, p. 35.\n   This is not the first time we have been asked to set aside\nprocedural default rules for a Vienna Convention claim.\nRespondent Johnson and the United States persuasively\nargue that this question is controlled by our decision in\nBreard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam). In\nBreard, the petitioner failed to raise an Article 36 claim in\nstate court—at trial or on collateral review—and then\nsought to have the claim heard in a subsequent federal\nhabeas proceeding. Id., at 375. He argued that “the Con\nvention is the ‘supreme law of the land’ and thus trumps\nthe procedural default doctrine.” Ibid. We rejected this\nargument as “plainly incorrect,” for two reasons. Ibid.\nFirst, we observed, “it has been recognized in interna\ntional law that, absent a clear and express statement to\nthe contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State\ngovern the implementation of the treaty in that State.”\nIbid. Furthermore, we reasoned that while treaty protec\ntions such as Article 36 may constitute supreme federal\nlaw, this is “no less true of provisions of the Constitution\nitself, to which rules of procedural default apply.” Id., at\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n376. In light of Breard’s holding, Bustillo faces an uphill\ntask in arguing that the Convention requires States to set\naside their procedural default rules for Article 36 claims.\n  Bustillo offers two reasons why Breard does not control\nhis case. He first argues that Breard’s holding concerning\nprocedural default was “unnecessary to the result,” Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 05–51, p. 45, because the petitioner\nthere could not demonstrate prejudice from the default\nand because, in any event, a subsequent federal statute—\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996, 110 Stat. 1214—superseded any right the petitioner\nhad under the Vienna Convention to have his claim heard\non collateral review. We find Bustillo’s contention unper\nsuasive. Our resolution of the procedural default question\nin Breard was the principal reason for the denial of the\npetitioner’s claim, and the discussion of the issue occupied\nthe bulk of our reasoning. See 523 U. S., at 375–377. It is\nno answer to argue, as Bustillo does, that the holding in\nBreard was “unnecessary” simply because the petitioner in\nthat case had several ways to lose. See Richmond Screw\nAnchor Co. v. United States, 275 U. S. 331, 340 (1928).\n  Bustillo’s second reason is less easily dismissed. He\nargues that since Breard, the ICJ has interpreted the\nVienna Convention to preclude the application of proce\ndural default rules to Article 36 claims. The LaGrand\nCase (F. R. G. v. U. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment of\nJune 27) (LaGrand), and the Case Concerning Avena and\nother Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No.\n128 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (Avena), were brought before\nthe ICJ by the governments of Germany and Mexico,\nrespectively, on behalf of several of their nationals facing\ndeath sentences in the United States. The foreign gov\nernments claimed that their nationals had not been in\nformed of their right to consular notification. They further\nargued that application of the procedural default rule to\ntheir nationals’ Vienna Convention claims failed to give\n18                 SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n“full effect” to the purposes of the Convention, as required\nby Article 36. The ICJ agreed, explaining that the defen\ndants had procedurally defaulted their claims “because of\nthe failure of the American authorities to comply with\ntheir obligation under Article 36.” LaGrand, supra, at\n497, ¶91; see also Avena, supra, ¶113. Application of the\nprocedural default rule in such circumstances, the ICJ\nreasoned, “prevented [courts] from attaching any legal\nsignificance” to the fact that the violation of Article 36\nkept the foreign governments from assisting in their na\ntionals’ defense. LaGrand, supra, at 497, ¶91; see also\nAvena, supra, ¶113.\n   Bustillo argues that LaGrand and Avena warrant revis\niting the procedural default holding of Breard. In a simi\nlar vein, several amici contend that “the United States is\nobligated to comply with the Convention, as interpreted by\nthe ICJ.” Brief for ICJ Experts 11 (emphases added). We\ndisagree. Although the ICJ’s interpretation deserves\n“respectful consideration,” Breard, supra, at 375, we con\nclude that it does not compel us to reconsider our under\nstanding of the Convention in Breard.4\n   Under our Constitution, “[t]he judicial Power of the\nUnited States” is “vested in one supreme Court, and in\nsuch inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to\ntime ordain and establish.” Art. III, §1. That “judicial\nPower . . . extend[s] to . . . Treaties.” Id., §2. And, as Chief\nJustice Marshall famously explained, that judicial power\n\n——————\n  4 The dissent, in light of LaGrand and Avena, “would read Breard . . .\n\nas not saying that the Convention never trumps any procedural default\nrule.” Post, at 26 (opinion of BREYER, J.). This requires more than\n“reading an exception into Breard’s language,” post, at 27, amounting\ninstead to overruling Breard’s plain holding that the Convention does\nnot trump the procedural default doctrine. While the appeal of such a\ncourse to a Breard dissenter may be clear, see 523 U. S., at 380\n(BREYER, J., dissenting), “respectful consideration” of precedent should\nbegin at home.\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nincludes the duty “to say what the law is.” Marbury v.\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). If treaties are to be\ngiven effect as federal law under our legal system, deter\nmining their meaning as a matter of federal law “is em\nphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart\nment,” headed by the “one supreme Court” established by\nthe Constitution. Ibid.; see also Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 378–379 (2000) (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (“At the\ncore of [the judicial] power is the federal courts’ independent\nresponsibility—independent from its coequal branches in\nthe Federal Government, and independent from the sepa\nrate authority of the several States—to interpret federal\nlaw”). It is against this background that the United States\nratified, and the Senate gave its advice and consent to, the\nvarious agreements that govern referral of Vienna Con\nvention disputes to the ICJ.\n  Nothing in the structure or purpose of the ICJ suggests\nthat its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on\nour courts.5 The ICJ’s decisions have “no binding force\n——————\n   5 The dissent’s extensive list of lower court opinions that have “looked\n\nto the ICJ for guidance,” post, at 21–22, is less impressive than first\nappears. Many of the cited opinions merely refer to, or briefly describe,\nICJ decisions without in any way relying on them as authority. See,\ne.g., Committee of United States Citizens Living in Nicaragua v.\nReagan, 859 F. 2d 929, 932, 935 (CADC 1988); Conservation Law\nFoundation of New England v. Secretary of Interior, 790 F. 2d 965, 967\n(CA1 1986); Narenji v. Civiletti, 617 F. 2d 745, 748 (CADC 1979); Diggs\nv. Richardson, 555 F. 2d 848, 849 (CADC 1976); Rogers v. Societe\nInternationale Pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S. A.,\n278 F. 2d 268, 273, n. 3 (CADC 1960) (Fahy, J., dissenting). Others cite\nICJ opinions alongside law review articles for general propositions\nabout international law. See, e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Islamic Republic\nof Iran, 52 F. 3d 346, 352 (CADC 1995); Princz v. Federal Republic of\nGermany, 26 F. 3d 1166, 1180, 1184 (CADC 1994) (Wald, J., dissent\ning); Sadat v. Mertes, 615 F. 2d 1176, 1187, n. 14 (CA7 1980); United\nStates v. Postal, 589 F. 2d 862, 869 (CA5 1979). Moreover, all but two\nof the cited decisions from this Court concern technical issues of bound\nary demarcation. See post, at 21.\n20              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexcept between the parties and in respect of that particu\nlar case,” Statute of the International Court of Justice,\nArt. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945) (emphasis\nadded). Any interpretation of law the ICJ renders in the\ncourse of resolving particular disputes is thus not binding\nprecedent even as to the ICJ itself; there is accordingly\nlittle reason to think that such interpretations were in\ntended to be controlling on our courts. The ICJ’s principal\npurpose is to arbitrate particular disputes between na\ntional governments. Id., at 1055 (ICJ is “the principal\njudicial organ of the United Nations”); see also Art. 34, id.,\nat 1059 (“Only states [i.e., countries] may be parties in\ncases before the Court”). While each member of the\nUnited Nations has agreed to comply with decisions of the\nICJ “in any case to which it is a party,” United Nations\nCharter, Art. 94(1), 59 Stat. 1051, T. S. No. 933 (1945), the\nCharter’s procedure for noncompliance—referral to the\nSecurity Council by the aggrieved state—contemplates\nquintessentially international remedies, Art. 94(2), ibid.\n   In addition, “[w]hile courts interpret treaties for them\nselves, the meaning given them by the departments of\ngovernment particularly charged with their negotiation\nand enforcement is given great weight.” Kolovrat v. Ore\ngon, 366 U. S. 187, 194 (1961). Although the United\nStates has agreed to “discharge its international obliga\ntions” in having state courts give effect to the decision in\nAvena, it has not taken the view that the ICJ’s interpreta\ntion of Article 36 is binding on our courts. President Bush,\nMemorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005),\nApp. to Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nMedellín v. Dretke, O. T. 2004, No. 04–5928, p. 9a. More\nover, shortly after Avena, the United States withdrew\nfrom the Optional Protocol concerning Vienna Convention\ndisputes. Whatever the effect of Avena and LaGrand\nbefore this withdrawal, it is doubtful that our courts\nshould give decisive weight to the interpretation of a\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntribunal whose jurisdiction in this area is no longer recog\nnized by the United States.\n   LaGrand and Avena are therefore entitled only to the\n“respectful consideration” due an interpretation of an\ninternational agreement by an international court.\nBreard, 523 U. S., at 375. Even according such considera\ntion, the ICJ’s interpretation cannot overcome the plain\nimport of Article 36. As we explained in Breard, the pro\ncedural rules of domestic law generally govern the imple\nmentation of an international treaty. Ibid. In addition,\nArticle 36 makes clear that the rights it provides “shall be\nexercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of\nthe receiving State” provided that “full effect . . . be given\nto the purposes for which the rights accorded under this\nArticle are intended.” Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. In\nthe United States, this means that the rule of procedural\ndefault—which applies even to claimed violations of our\nConstitution, see Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129\n(1982)—applies also to Vienna Convention claims. Busti\nllo points to nothing in the drafting history of Article 36 or\nin the contemporary practice of other signatories that\nundermines this conclusion.\n   The ICJ concluded that where a defendant was not\nnotified of his rights under Article 36, application of the\nprocedural default rule failed to give “full effect” to the\npurposes of Article 36 because it prevented courts from\nattaching “legal significance” to the Article 36 violation.\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 497–498, ¶¶90–91. This reason\ning overlooks the importance of procedural default rules in\nan adversary system, which relies chiefly on the parties to\nraise significant issues and present them to the courts in\nthe appropriate manner at the appropriate time for adju\ndication. See Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386\n(2003) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (“Our adversary system is designed around the\npremise that the parties know what is best for them, and\n22              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nare responsible for advancing the facts and arguments\nentitling them to relief”). Procedural default rules are\ndesigned to encourage parties to raise their claims promptly\nand to vindicate “the law’s important interest in the finality\nof judgments.” Massaro, 538 U. S., at 504. The conse\nquence of failing to raise a claim for adjudication at the\nproper time is generally forfeiture of that claim. As a\nresult, rules such as procedural default routinely deny “legal\nsignificance”—in the Avena and LaGrand sense—to other\nwise viable legal claims.\n   Procedural default rules generally take on greater im\nportance in an adversary system such as ours than in the\nsort of magistrate-directed, inquisitorial legal system\ncharacteristic of many of the other countries that are\nsignatories to the Vienna Convention. “What makes a\nsystem adversarial rather than inquisitorial is . . . the\npresence of a judge who does not (as an inquisitor does)\nconduct the factual and legal investigation himself, but\ninstead decides on the basis of facts and arguments pro\nand con adduced by the parties.” McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501\nU. S. 171, 181, n. 2 (1991). In an inquisitorial system, the\nfailure to raise a legal error can in part be attributed to the\nmagistrate, and thus to the state itself. In our system,\nhowever, the responsibility for failing to raise an issue\ngenerally rests with the parties themselves.\n   The ICJ’s interpretation of Article 36 is inconsistent\nwith the basic framework of an adversary system. Under\nthe ICJ’s reading of “full effect,” Article 36 claims could\ntrump not only procedural default rules, but any number\nof other rules requiring parties to present their legal\nclaims at the appropriate time for adjudication. If the\nState’s failure to inform the defendant of his Article 36\nrights generally excuses the defendant’s failure to comply\nwith relevant procedural rules, then presumably rules\nsuch as statutes of limitations and prohibitions against\nfiling successive habeas petitions must also yield in the\n                       Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                       23\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nface of Article 36 claims. This sweeps too broadly, for it\nreads the “full effect” proviso in a way that leaves little\nroom for Article 36’s clear instruction that Article 36\nrights “shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\nregulations of the receiving State.” Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T.,\nat 101.6\n——————\n  6 The  dissent would read the ICJ’s decisions to require that proce\ndural default rules give way only where “the State is unwilling to\nprovide some other effective remedy, for example (if the lawyer acts\nincompetently in respect to Convention rights of which the lawyer was\naware) an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.” Post, at 25 (opinion\nof BREYER, J.). But both LaGrand and Avena indicate that the avail\nability of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not an adequate\nremedy for an Article 36 violation. See LaGrand Case (F. R. G. v.\nU. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466, 497, ¶91 (Judgment of June 27) (requiring\nsuspension of state procedural default rule even though “United States\ncourts could and did examine the professional competence of counsel\nassigned to the indigent LaGrands by reference to United States\nconstitutional standards”); see also Case Concerning Avena and other\nMexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128, ¶134 (Judg\nment of Mar. 31).\n   To the extent the dissent suggests that the ICJ’s decisions could be\nread to prevent application of procedural default rules where a defen\ndant’s attorney is unaware of Article 36, see post, at 24–25 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.), this interpretation of the Convention is in sharp conflict\nwith the role of counsel in our system. “Attorney ignorance or inadver\ntence is not ‘cause’ because the attorney is the petitioner’s agent when\nacting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner\nmust ‘bear the risk of attorney error.’ ” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 753 (1991) (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986)).\nUnder our system, an attorney’s lack of knowledge does not excuse the\ndefendant’s default, unless the attorney’s overall representation falls\nbelow what is required by the Sixth Amendment. In any event, Bustillo\nhimself does not argue that the applicability of procedural default rules\nhinges on whether a foreign national’s attorney was aware of Article 36.\nSee Brief for Petitioner in No. 05–51, p. 38 (“[A] lawyer may not,\nconsistent with the purposes of Article 36, unilaterally forfeit a foreign\nnational’s opportunity to communicate with his consulate”). In fact,\nBustillo has conceded that his “attorney at trial was aware of his\nclient’s rights under the Vienna Convention.” App. in No. 05–51,\np. 203, n. 5.\n24              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Much as Sanchez-Llamas cannot show that suppression\nis an appropriate remedy for Article 36 violations under\ndomestic law principles, so too Bustillo cannot show that\nnormally applicable procedural default rules should be\nsuspended in light of the type of right he claims. In this\nregard, a comparison of Article 36 and a suspect’s rights\nunder Miranda disposes of Bustillo’s claim. Bustillo con\ntends that applying procedural default rules to Article 36\nrights denies such rights “full effect” because the violation\nitself—i.e., the failure to inform defendants of their right\nto consular notification—prevents them from becoming\naware of their Article 36 rights and asserting them at\ntrial. Of course, precisely the same thing is true of rights\nunder Miranda. Police are required to advise suspects\nthat they have a right to remain silent and a right to an\nattorney. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 479; see also\nDickerson, 530 U. S., at 435. If police do not give such\nwarnings, and counsel fails to object, it is equally true that\na suspect may not be “aware he even had such rights until\nwell after his trial had concluded.” Brief for Petitioner in\nNo. 05–51, p. 35. Nevertheless, it is well established that\nwhere a defendant fails to raise a Miranda claim at trial,\nprocedural default rules may bar him from raising the\nclaim in a subsequent postconviction proceeding. Wain\nwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977).\n   Bustillo responds that an Article 36 claim more closely\nresembles a claim, under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963), that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory\nevidence—a type of claim that often can be asserted for\nthe first time only in postconviction proceedings. See\nUnited States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U. S. 74, 83, n. 9\n(2004). The analogy is inapt. In the case of a Brady claim,\nit is impossible for the defendant to know as a factual\nmatter that a violation has occurred before the exculpa\ntory evidence is disclosed. By contrast, a defendant is well\naware of the fact that he was not informed of his Article 36\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrights, even if the legal significance of that fact eludes him.\n   Finally, relying on Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S.\n500, Bustillo argues that Article 36 claims “are most ap\npropriately raised post-trial or on collateral review.” Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 05–51, p. 39. Massaro held that\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel may be raised\nfor the first time in a proceeding under 28 U. S. C. §2255.\nThat decision, however, involved the question of the\nproper forum for federal habeas claims. Bustillo, by con\ntrast, asks us to require the States to hear Vienna Conven\ntion claims raised for the first time in state postconviction\nproceedings. Given that the Convention itself imposes no\nsuch requirement, we do not perceive any grounds for us\nto revise state procedural rules in this fashion. See\nDickerson, supra, at 438.\n   We therefore conclude, as we did in Breard, that claims\nunder Article 36 of the Vienna Convention may be sub\njected to the same procedural default rules that apply\ngenerally to other federal-law claims.\n                        *    *      *\n  Although these cases involve the delicate question of the\napplication of an international treaty, the issues in many\nways turn on established principles of domestic law. Our\nholding in no way disparages the importance of the Vienna\nConvention. The relief petitioners request is, by any meas\nure, extraordinary. Sanchez-Llamas seeks a suppression\nremedy for an asserted right with little if any connection to\nthe gathering of evidence; Bustillo requests an exception to\nprocedural rules that is accorded to almost no other right,\nincluding many of our most fundamental constitutional\nprotections. It is no slight to the Convention to deny\npetitioners’ claims under the same principles we would\napply to an Act of Congress, or to the Constitution itself.\n  The judgments of the Supreme Court of Oregon and the\nSupreme Court of Virginia are affirmed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The dissenting\nopinion veers away from the two cases here for review,\nimagining other situations unlike those at hand. In nei\nther of the cases before us would I remand for further\nproceedings.\n  I turn first to the question whether a violation of Article\n36 requires suppression of statements to police officers in\nSanchez-Llamas’ case and others like it. Shortly after his\narrest and in advance of any police interrogation, Sanchez-\nLlamas received the warnings required by Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), in both English and Spanish.\nTr. 122 (Nov. 16, 2000). He indicated that he understood\n2                 SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                 GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthose warnings, id., at 123, telling the police that he had\nlived in the United States for approximately 11 years, id., at\n124, 143, 177. After a break in questioning, Sanchez-\nLlamas again received Miranda warnings in Spanish, and\nagain indicated that he understood them. Id., at 129, 176.\nSanchez-Llamas, with his life experience in the United\nStates, scarcely resembles the uncomprehending detainee\nimagined by JUSTICE BREYER, post, at 30. Such a detainee\nwould have little need to invoke the Vienna Convention, for\nMiranda warnings a defendant is unable to comprehend\ngive the police no green light for interrogation. Moran v.\nBurbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421 (1986) (a defendant’s waiver of\nMiranda rights must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent,\ni.e., “the product of a free and deliberate choice . . . made\nwith a full awareness of both the nature of the right being\nabandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon\nit”); United States v. Garibay, 143 F. 3d 534, 537–540 (CA9\n1998) (defendant, who had difficulty understanding English,\ndid not knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda\nrights where the police recited the Miranda warnings only\nin English); United States v. Short, 790 F. 2d 464, 469 (CA6\n1986) (defendant’s limited comprehension of English cast\nsubstantial doubt on the validity of her Miranda waiver).1\n   In contrast to Miranda warnings, which must be given\non the spot before the police interrogate, Article 36 of the\nVienna Convention does not require the arresting author\nity to contact the consular post instantly. See Case Con\ncerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v.\n——————\n    1 Before\n           trial, Sanchez-Llamas moved to suppress his statements to\npolice on voluntariness grounds. The trial court denied the motion,\nfinding that clear and convincing evidence established Sanchez-Llamas’\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights.

No. 128, ¶97 (Judgment of Mar. 31)\n(Avena) (United States’s notification of Mexican consulate\nwithin three working days of detainee’s arrest satisfied\nArticle 36(1)(b)’s “without delay” requirement); U.

Nor does that\nArticle demand that questioning await notice to, and a\nresponse from, consular officials.2 It is unsurprising,\ntherefore, that the well researched dissenting opinion has\nnot found even a single case in which any court, any place\nhas in fact found suppression an appropriate remedy\nbased on no provision of domestic law, but solely on an\narresting officer’s failure to comply with Article 36 of the\nVienna Convention. See post, at 32; ante, at 9, n. 3.\n  The Court points out, and I agree, that in fitting circum\nstances, a defendant might successfully “raise an Article\n36 claim as part of a broader challenge to the voluntari\nness of [a detainee’s] statements to police.” Ante, at 15. In\nthat way, “full effect” could be given to Article 36 in a\n——————\n  2 See Declaration of Ambassador Maura A.

Avena,\n2004 I. C. J., ¶87 (recognizing that Article 36(1)(b)’s requirement that\nauthorities “ ‘inform the person concerned without delay of his rights’\ncannot be interpreted to signify that the provision of such information\nmust necessarily precede any interrogation, so that the commencement of\ninterrogation before the information is given would be a breach of Article\n36”).\n4               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n               GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmanner consistent with U. S. rules and regulations. But\nthe question presented here is whether suppression is\nwarranted simply because the State’s authorities failed to\ncomply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. Neither\nthe Convention itself nor the practice of our treaty part\nners establishes Sanchez-Llamas’ entitlement to such a\nremedy. See El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan\nTseng, 525 U. S. 155, 175–176 (1999) (construing the\nWarsaw Convention in accord with the views of the United\nStates’s treaty partners).\n   As to the procedural default issue, I note first two\nanomalies. The Court explains, and I agree, that it would\nbe extraordinary to hold that defendants, unaware of their\nMiranda rights because the police failed to convey the\nrequired warnings, would be subject to a State’s proce\ndural default rules, but defendants not told of Article 36\nrights would face no such hindrance. See ante, at 24.\nFurthermore, as the dissent apparently recognizes, in the\nfederal court system, a later-in-time statute, codifying a\nfederal procedural default rule, would “supersed[e] any\ninconsistent provision in the Convention.” Post, at 25–26\n(citing Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam)).\nIn my view, it would be unseemly, to say the least, for this\nCourt to command state courts to relax their identical, or\neven less stringent procedural default rules, while federal\ncourts operate without constraint in this regard. Post, at\n26. That state of affairs, surely productive of friction in\nour federal system, should be resisted if there is a plausi\nble choice, i.e., if a reasonable interpretation of the federal\nstatute and international accord would avoid the conflict.\n   Critical for me, Bustillo has conceded that his “attorney\nat trial was aware of his client’s rights under the Vienna\nConvention.” App. in No. 05–51, p. 203, n. 5. Given the\nknowledge of the Vienna Convention that Bustillo’s lawyer\npossessed, this case fails to meet the dissent’s (and the\nInternational Court of Justice’s) first condition for overrid\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

C. J., ¶113); accord post, at 6, 16, 18, 23.\nNothing the State did or omitted to do here “precluded\ncounsel from . . . rais[ing] the question of a violation of the\nVienna Convention in the initial trial.” Ibid. Had counsel\ndone so, the trial court could have made “appropriate\naccommodations to ensure that the defendant secure[d], to\nthe extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance.”\nAnte, at 15.3\n  In short, if there are some times when a Convention\nviolation, standing alone, might warrant suppression, or\nthe displacement of a State’s ordinarily applicable proce\ndural default rules, neither Sanchez-Llamas’ case nor\nBustillo’s belongs in that category.\n\n\n——————\n  3 Furthermore, once Bustillo became aware of his Vienna Convention\n\nrights, nothing prevented him from raising an ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claim predicated on his trial counsel’s failure to assert the\nState’s violation of those rights. Through such a claim, as the dissent\nacknowledges, see post, at 16, 19, 25, 29, “full effect” could have been\ngiven to Article 36, without dishonoring state procedural rules that are\ncompatible with due process. Bustillo did not include a Vienna-\nConvention-based, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim along with his\ndirect Vienna Convention claim in his initial habeas petition. He later\nsought to amend his petition to add an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim, but the court held that the amendment did not relate back to the\ninitial pleading. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26, 42. The state court therefore\nrejected Bustillo’s ineffectiveness claim as barred by the applicable\nstate statute of limitations. App. 132.

We granted certiorari in\nthese cases to consider three related questions: (1) May a\ncriminal defendant raise a claim (at trial or in a postcon\nviction proceeding) that state officials violated this provi\nsion? (2) May a State apply its usual procedural default\nrules to Convention claims, thereby denying the defendant\nthe right to raise the claim in a postconviction proceeding\n2               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\non the ground that the defendant failed to raise the claim\nat trial? And (3) is suppression of a defendant’s confession\n(made to police after a violation of the Convention) an\nappropriate remedy?\n   The Court assumes, but does not decide, that the an\nswer to the first question is “yes.” Ante, at 7–8. It an\nswers the second question by holding that a State always\nmay apply its ordinary procedural default rules to a de\nfendant’s claim of a Convention violation. Ante, at 15–25.\nIts answer to the third question is that suppression is\nnever an appropriate remedy for a Convention violation.\nAnte, at 8–15.\n   Unlike the majority, I would decide the first question\nand answer it affirmatively. A criminal defendant may, at\ntrial or in a postconviction proceeding, raise the claim that\nstate authorities violated the Convention in his case. My\nanswer to the second question is that sometimes state\nprocedural default rules must yield to the Convention’s\ninsistence that domestic laws “enable full effect to be given\nto the purposes for which” Article 36’s “rights . . . are\nintended.” Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. And my answer\nto the third question is that suppression may sometimes\nprovide an appropriate remedy. After answering these\nquestions, I would remand these cases, thereby permitting\nthe States to apply their own procedural and remedial\nlaws, but with the understanding that the Federal Consti\ntution requires that the application of those laws be con\nsistent with the Convention’s demand for an effective\nremedy for an Article 36 violation.

The United States and 169 other na\ntions have ratified the Convention. Its adoption in 1963\nwas perhaps “the single most important event in the\nentire history of the consular institution.” L. Lee, Consu\nlar Law and Practice 26 (2d ed. 1991). The Convention\ndefines consular functions to include “protecting in the\nreceiving State the interests of the sending State and of its\nnationals,” and “helping and assisting nationals . . . of the\nsending State.” Arts. 5(a), (e), 21 U. S. T., at 82–83. The\nUnited States ratified the Convention in 1969.\n   Article 36 of the Convention governs relations between a\nconsulate and its nationals, particularly those who have\nbeen arrested by the host country. Its object is to assure\nconsular communication and assistance to such nationals,\nwho may not fully understand the host country’s legal\nregime or even speak its language. Article 36 reads as\nfollows:\n    “1. With a view to facilitating the exercise of consular\n    functions relating to nationals of the sending State:\n      “(a) consular officers shall be free to communicate\n    with nationals of the sending State and to have access\n    to them. Nationals of the sending State shall have the\n    same freedom with respect to communication with\n    and access to consular officers of the sending State;\n      “(b) if he so requests, the competent authorities of\n    the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the\n    consular post of the sending State if, within its consu\n    lar district, a national of that State is arrested or\n    committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is\n    detained in any other manner. Any communication\n    addressed to the consular post by the person arrested,\n    in prison, custody or detention shall also be forwarded\n    by the said authorities without delay. The said au\n    thorities shall inform the person concerned without de\n4               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v.

The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Arti\n    cle shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\n    regulations of the receiving State, subject to the pro\n    viso, however, that the said laws and regulations\n    must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for\n    which the rights accorded under this Article are in\n    tended.” 21 U. S. T., at 100–101 (emphasis added).\nThe U. S. State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual has\nlong stressed the importance the United States places\nupon these provisions. It says, “[O]ne of the basic func\ntions of a consular office has been to provide a ‘cultural\nbridge’ between the host community and the [U. S. na\ntional]. No one needs that cultural bridge more than the\nindividual U. S. citizen who has been arrested in a foreign\ncountry or imprisoned in a foreign jail.” 7 Foreign Affairs\nManual §401 (1984); see also id., §§401–426 (2004).\n                              B\n  In 1969, the United States also ratified (but the Presi\ndent has since withdrawn from) an Optional Protocol to\nthe Convention. See Optional Protocol Concerning the\nCompulsory Settlement of Disputes (Optional Protocol),\nApr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 325, T. I. A. S.

J. 466 (Judgment of June 27) (LaGrand)\n(case brought by Germany); Case Concerning Avena and\nother Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No.\n128 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (Avena) (case brought by\nMexico).\n   In Germany’s case, the ICJ rejected the United States’\nclaim that the “rights of consular notification and access\nunder [Article 36] are rights of States, and not of individu\nals.” LaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 19–20, ¶76. It held in\nstead that (1) if an arrested foreign national is prejudiced\nby the host country’s failure to inform him of his Article 36\nrights, and (2) if that individual has “been subjected to\nprolonged detention or convicted and sentenced to severe\npenalties,” then a diplomatic apology alone is not a suffi\ncient remedy. Id., at 32–33, ¶125. Rather, the Convention\nrequires the host country, in that case the United States,\n“to allow the review and reconsideration of the” foreign\nnational’s “conviction and sentence by taking account of\nthe violation of the rights set forth in the Convention.”\nIbid. The ICJ added that “[t]he choice of means” for pro\nviding this review “must be left to the United States.”\nIbid. In addition, the ICJ stated that in the case before it,\napplication of a procedural default rule (that is, the rule\nthat the LaGrands could not bring their Convention\nclaims in habeas proceedings because they had not raised\nthose claims at trial) violated Article 36(2) of the Conven\ntion because it “had the effect of preventing ‘full effect\n[from being] given to the purposes for which the rights\naccorded under this article are intended.’ ” Id., at 22, ¶91\n(quoting Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101). In the ICJ’s view,\nit was “the failure of the American authorities to comply”\nwith Article 36 that prevented the LaGrands from raising\ntheir claims earlier. LaGrand, supra, at 22, ¶91.\n   In Mexico’s case, the ICJ reiterated its view that Article\n36, in addition to imposing obligations on member nations,\n6               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nalso allows foreign nationals to bring claims based on\nthose violations in domestic judicial proceedings. The ICJ\nnoted that, as a matter of international law, breach of a\ntreaty ordinarily “ ‘involves an obligation to make repara\ntion in an adequate form.’ ” Avena, supra, ¶119 (quoting\nFactory at Chorzów, Jurisdiction, 1927, P. C. I. J., ser. A,\nNo. 9, p. 21). Applying that principle to the Convention,\nthe ICJ concluded that “the remedy to make good . . .\nviolations [of Article 36] should consist in an obligation on\nthe United States to permit review and reconsideration of\nthese nationals’ cases by the United States courts . . . with\na view to ascertaining whether in each case the violation\n. . . caused actual prejudice to the defendant in the process\nof administration of criminal justice.” Avena, 2004 I. C. J.,\n¶121 (emphasis added). The court added that this “review\nand reconsideration,” to be “effective,” must “fully ex\namin[e] and tak[e] into account” any such prejudice to the\ndefendant. Id., ¶138. The ICJ declined to specify the\nmeans by which American courts should provide such\n“review and reconsideration.” Instead, the ICJ said, the\nappropriate remedy depends upon an examination of “the\nconcrete circumstances of each case” and should be deter\nmined “by the United States courts concerned in the proc\ness of their review and reconsideration.” Id., ¶127.\n    In respect to procedural default, the ICJ referenced\nwhat it said in LaGrand, while adding the critically im\nportant qualification that the cases in which the Conven\ntion blocked application of a procedural default rule were\nthose in which it was “the failure of the United States\nitself to inform” an arrested foreign national of his right to\ncontact the consulate that “precluded counsel from being\nin a position to have raised the question of a violation of\nthe Vienna Convention in the initial trial.” Avena, supra,\n¶113.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The Court assumes that the answer to this\nquestion is “yes,” but it does not decide the matter because\nit concludes in any event that the petitioners are not\nentitled to the remedies they seek. As explained below, I\nwould resolve those remedial questions differently.\nHence, I must decide, rather than assume, the answer to\nthe first question presented.\n  Regardless, the first question raises an important issue\nof federal law that has arisen hundreds of times in the\nlower federal and state courts.

And the issue often arises in\na legal context where statutes or procedural requirements\narguably block this Court’s speedy review. See Medellín v.\nDretke, 544 U. S. 660 (2005) (per curiam). We granted the\npetitions for certiorari in significant part in order to decide\nthis question. And, given its importance, we should do so.\n   In answering the question it is common ground that the\nConvention is “self-executi[ng].” See S. Exec. Rep. No. 91–\n9, p. 5 (1969); see also Brief for Respondent in No. 04–\n10566, pp. 9–10; Brief for Respondent in No. 05–51, p. 23.\nThat is to say, the Convention “operates of itself without\nthe aid of any legislative provision.” Foster v. Neilson, 2\nPet. 253, 314 (1829). The parties also agree that we need\nnot decide whether the Convention creates a “private right\nof action,” i.e., a private right that would allow an individ\nual to bring a lawsuit for enforcement of the Convention or\nfor damages based on its violation. Rather, the question\nhere is whether the Convention provides, in these cases,\nlaw applicable in legal proceedings that might have been\nbrought irrespective of the Vienna Convention claim, here\nan ordinary criminal appeal and an ordinary postconvic\ntion proceeding.\n   Bustillo, for example, has brought an action under a\nVirginia statute that allows any convicted person to seek\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrelease from custody on the ground that “he is detained\nwithout lawful authority.” Va. Code Ann. §8.01–654(A)(1)\n(Lexis 2005). Sanchez-Llamas has challenged his state\ncriminal conviction on direct appeal, and in that proceed\ning he is entitled to claim that his conviction violates state\nor federal law. In both cases the petitioners argue that a\ncourt decision favoring the prosecution would violate the\nConvention (as properly interpreted), and therefore the\nConstitution forbids any such decision. See U. S. Const.,\nArt. VI, cl. 2. This argument in effect claims that the\nConvention itself provides applicable law that here would\nfavor the petitioners if, but only if, they are correct as to\ntheir interpretation of the Convention (which is, of course,\na different matter).\n  The petitioners must be right in respect to their claim\nthat the Convention provides law that here courts could\napply in their respective proceedings. The Convention is a\ntreaty. And “all Treaties made . . . under the Authority of\nthe United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land;\nand the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby.”\nU. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. As Chief Justice Marshall long\nago explained, under the Supremacy Clause a treaty is “to\nbe regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of\nthe legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the\naid of any legislative provision.” Foster, supra, at 314.\n  Directly to the point, this Court stated long ago that a\ntreaty “is a law of the land as an act of Congress is, when\never its provisions prescribe a rule by which the rights of\nthe private citizen or subject may be determined. And\nwhen such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court\nof justice,” in such a case the court is to “resor[t] to the\ntreaty for a rule of decision for the case before it as it\nwould to a statute.” Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580,\n598–599 (1884).\n  As noted above, see supra, at 8, the parties agree that\nthe Convention “operates of itself without the aid of any\n10              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlegislative provision.” Foster, supra, at 314. The question,\nthen, is the one this Court set forth in the Head Money\nCases: Does the Convention set forth a “law” with the legal\nstature of an Act of Congress? And as the Court ex\nplained, we are to answer that question by asking, does\nthe Convention “prescribe a rule by which the rights of the\nprivate citizen . . . may be determined”? Are the obliga\ntions set forth in Article 36(1)(b) “of a nature to be en\nforced in a court of justice”?\n   The “nature” of the Convention provisions raised by the\npetitioners indicates that they are intended to set forth\nstandards that are judicially enforceable. Those provi\nsions consist of the rights of a foreign national “arrested”\nor “detained in any other manner” (1) to have, on his\n“reques[t],” the “consular post” “inform[ed]” of that arrest\nor detention; (2) to have forwarded “without delay” any\n“communication addressed to the consular post”; and (3) to\nbe “inform[ed] . . . without delay” of those two “rights.”\nArt. 36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. These rights do not differ\nin their “nature” from other procedural rights that courts\ncommonly enforce. Cf. U. S. Const., Amdt. 6 (“In all crimi\nnal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to\nbe informed of the nature and cause of the accusation”);\nibid. (“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy\nthe right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his\ndefence”); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\n   Moreover, the language of Article 36 speaks directly of\nthe “rights” of the individual foreign national. See Art.\n36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (“The said authorities shall\ninform the person concerned without delay of his rights\nunder this sub-paragraph” (emphasis added)). Article 36\nthus stands in stark contrast to other provisions of the\nConvention, which speak in terms of the rights of the\nmember nations or consular officials. Cf. Art. 9, id., at 86\n(discussing “the right of any of the Contracting Parties to\nfix the designation of consular officers” (emphasis added));\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nArt. 34, id., at 98 (consular officials shall have “freedom of\nmovement and travel”); Art. 35, id., at 99 (consular offi\ncials shall have “freedom of communication”); Art. 41(1),\nid., at 103 (“Consular officers shall not be liable to arrest\nor detention pending trial”).\n    Suppose that a pre-Miranda federal statute had said\nthat arresting authorities “shall inform a detained person\nwithout delay of his right to counsel.” Would courts not\nhave automatically assumed that this statute created\napplicable law that a criminal defendant could invoke at\ntrial? What more would the statute have to say? See\nMedellín, 544 U. S., at 687 (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (“And\nif a statute were to provide, for example, that arresting\nauthorities ‘shall inform a detained person without delay\nof his right to counsel,’ ” what “more would be required” to\npermit “a defendant” to “invoke that statute”?).\n    Further, this Court has routinely permitted individuals\nto enforce treaty provisions similar to Article 36 in domes\ntic judicial proceedings. In United States v. Rauscher, 119\nU. S. 407, 410–411 (1886), for example, this Court con\ncluded that the defendant could raise as a defense in his\nfederal criminal trial the violation of an extradition treaty\nthat said, “ ‘It is agreed that the United States and Her\nBritannic Majesty shall, upon mutual requisitions by them\n. . . deliver up to justice all persons’ ” charged with certain\ncrimes in the other country. Similarly, in Kolovrat v.\nOregon, 366 U. S. 187, 191, n. 6 (1961), the Court held that\nforeign nationals could challenge a state law limiting their\nright to recover an inheritance based on a treaty providing\nthat “ ‘[i]n all that concerns the right of acquiring, possess\ning or disposing of every kind of property . . . citizens of\n[each country who reside in the other] shall enjoy the\nrights which the respective laws grant . . . in each of these\nstates to the subjects of the most favored nation.’ ” And in\nAsakura v. Seattle, 265 U. S. 332, 340 (1924), the Court\nallowed a foreign national to challenge a city ordinance\n12              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nforbidding noncitizens from working as pawnbrokers\nunder a treaty stating that “ ‘citizens or subjects of each of\nthe High Contracting Parties shall have liberty . . . to\ncarry on trade’ ” and “ ‘generally to do anything incident to\nor necessary for trade upon the same terms as native\ncitizens or subjects.’ ”\n   In all these cases, the Court recognized that (1) a treaty\nobligated the United States to treat foreign nationals in a\ncertain manner; (2) the obligation had been breached by\nthe Government’s conduct; and (3) the foreign national\ncould therefore seek redress for that breach in a judicial\nproceeding, even though the treaty did not specifically\nmention judicial enforcement of its guarantees or even\nexpressly state that its provisions were intended to confer\nrights on the foreign national. Language and context\nargue yet more strongly here in favor of permitting a\ncriminal defendant in an appropriate case to find in the\nConvention a law to apply in the proceeding against him.\n   In addition, the Government concedes that individual\nconsular officials may enforce other provisions of the Con\nvention in American courts. For example, Article 43(1)\ngrants consular officials immunity from “the jurisdiction of\nthe” host country’s “judicial or administrative authorities”\nfor “acts performed in the exercise of consular functions.”\n21 U. S. T., at 104. The federal courts have held that a\nconsular official may raise Article 43(1) in a judicial pro\nceeding, even though that provision does not expressly\nmention a judicial remedy. See, e.g., Risk v. Halvorsen,\n936 F. 2d 393, 397 (CA9 1991); Gerritsen v. de la Madrid\nHurtado, 819 F. 2d 1511, 1515–1516 (CA9 1987); see also\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 2 (citing\nwith approval these cases). What in Article 36 warrants\ntreating it differently in this respect?\n   Finally, the international tribunal that the United\nStates agreed would resolve disputes about the interpreta\ntion of the Convention, the ICJ, has twice ruled that an\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\narrested foreign national may raise a violation of the\narresting authorities’ obligation to “inform [him] without\ndelay of his rights under” Article 36(1) in an American\njudicial proceeding. See Avena, 2004 I. C. J. No. 128;\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J. 466. That conclusion, as an “inter\npretation of an international agreement by an interna\ntional court” deserves our “ ‘respectful consideration.’ ”\nAnte, at 21. That “respectful consideration,” for reasons I\nshall explain, see infra, at 18–21, counsels in favor of an\ninterpretation that is consistent with the ICJ’s reading of\nthe Convention here.\n   The Government says to the contrary that Article 36 is\n“addressed solely to the rights of States and not private\nindividuals”; hence, a foreign national may not claim in an\nAmerican court that a State has convicted him without the\nconsular notification that Article 36 requires. Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 7. But its arguments are\nnot persuasive. The Government rests this conclusion\nprimarily upon its claim that there is a “long-established\npresumption that treaties and other international agree\nments do not create judicially enforceable individual\nrights.” Id., at 11.\n   The problem with that argument is that no such pre\nsumption exists. The Government cites three cases in\nsupport of its position, Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U. S. 447,\n474 (1913); Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 195\n(1888); and Foster, 2 Pet., at 306–307. The first of these,\nCharlton, says that the question whether a treaty has\nbeen abrogated by another nation’s violations is a matter\nwith which “ ‘judicial tribunals have nothing to do.’ ” 229\nU. S., at 474. The second, Whitney, says that whether a\nsubsequent federal statute that abrogates a treaty violates\nthe United States’ treaty obligations is a matter that has\n“not been confided to the judiciary.” 124 U. S., at 195.\nThe third, Foster, says that in “a controversy between two\nnations concerning national boundary, it is scarcely possi\n14              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nble that the courts of either should refuse to abide by the\nmeasures adopted by its own government.” 2 Pet., at 307.\nWhat have these issues to do with the present one? How\ndo these cases support the presumption that the Govern\nment claims?\n   Regardless, as I have just said, see supra, at 9, the Head\nMoney Cases make clear that a treaty may confer certain\nenforceable “rights upon the citizens or subjects of one of\nthe nations residing in the territorial limits of the other.”\n112 U. S., at 598; see also 2 Restatement (Third) on For\neign Relations Law of the United States §907 (1986) (here\ninafter Restatement) (“A private person having rights\nagainst the United States under an international agree\nment may assert those rights in courts in the United\nStates”). And the language of the Convention makes clear\nthat it is such a treaty. Indeed, to my knowledge no other\nnation’s courts (or perhaps no more than one) have held to\nthe contrary. The cases cited by the respondents and the\nGovernment do not say otherwise. See Judgment of Nov.\n7, 2001, 5 BGHSt 116 (Germany) (deciding in light of\nLaGrand that the Convention creates individual rights,\nbut declining to suppress confession); Queen v. Abbrederis\n(1981) 51 F. L. R. 99, 115 (Ct. Crim. App. New South\nWales (Australia)) (deciding that Convention does not\n“affect the carrying out of an investigation by interroga\ntion of a foreign person coming to this country”). But see\nQueen v. Van Bergen [2000] 261 A. R. 387, 390 (Ct. App.\nAlberta (Canada)) (noting in dictum that the Convention\n“creates an obligation between states and is not one owed\nto the national,” but affirming denial of suppression mo\ntion on the ground that “there was in any event no proven\nprejudice to” the defendant). See also Queen v. Partak,\n[2001] 160 C. C. C. 3d 553 (Ont. Super. Ct. of J.) (applying\nVan Bergen’s “serious prejudice” test to conclude that\ndefendant’s statements were admissible); compare cases\ncited infra, at 31–32.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  The Government also points out that the Executive\nBranch’s interpretation of treaty provisions is entitled to\n“great weight.” Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagli\nano, 457 U. S. 176, 184–185 (1982). I agree with this\npresumption. But the Executive’s views on our treaty\nobligations are “not conclusive.” Ibid.; see Perkins v. Elg,\n307 U. S. 325, 328, 337–342 (1939) (declining to adopt\nExecutive’s treaty interpretation); Johnson v. Browne, 205\nU. S. 309, 319–321 (1907) (same); De Lima v. Bidwell, 182\nU. S. 1, 181, 194–199 (1901) (same). Where language, the\nnature of the right, and the ICJ’s interpretation of the\ntreaty taken separately or together so strongly point to an\nintent to confer enforceable rights upon an individual, I\ncannot find in the simple fact of the Executive Branch’s\ncontrary view sufficient reason to adopt the Government’s\ninterpretation of the Convention.\n  Accordingly, I would allow the petitioners to raise their\nclaims based on violations of the Convention in their\nrespective state-court proceedings.\n                               III\n   The more difficult issue, I believe, concerns the nature\nof the Convention’s requirements as to remedy. In par\nticular, Bustillo’s case concerns a state procedural default\nrule. When, if ever, does the Convention require a state\ncourt to set aside such a rule in order to hear a criminal\ndefendant’s claim that the police did not “inform” him of\nhis “right” to communicate with his “consular post”? Art.\n36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. The Court says that the\nanswer is “never.” See ante, at 15–25. In its view, the\nConvention does not under any circumstances trump a\nState’s ordinary procedural rules requiring a defendant to\nassert his claims at trial or lose them forever.\n   In my view, Article 36 of the Convention requires a less\nabsolute answer. Article 36 says that the rights it sets\nforth “shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\n16              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nregulations of the receiving State,” but it instantly adds,\n“subject to the proviso . . . that the said laws and regula\ntions must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for\nwhich the [Article 36] rights are . . . intended.” Art. 36(2),\n21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). The proviso means\nthat a State’s ordinary procedural default rules apply\nunless (1) the defendant’s failure to raise a Convention\nmatter (e.g., that police failed to inform him of his Article\n36 rights) can itself be traced to the failure of the police (or\nother governmental authorities) to inform the defendant of\nthose Convention rights, and (2) state law does not pro\nvide any other effective way for the defendant to raise that\nissue (say, through a claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel).\n   Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, as\nI have just noted, Article 36 says both that its rights “shall\nbe exercised in conformity with” the host country’s “laws\nand regulations” and that those “laws and regulations\nmust enable full effect to be given” to the purposes for\nwhich those rights “are intended.” This interpretation\nmakes both the “conformity” requirement and the “full\neffect” requirement meaningful.\n   Second, the Convention’s drafting history supports this\ninterpretation. The first draft of the Vienna Convention\nwas written by the International Law Commission. Arti\ncle 36(2) of that draft required only that domestic laws\n“not nullify” the rights afforded by the Convention. Draft\nArticles on Consular Relations Adopted by the Interna\ntional Law Commission at its Thirteenth Session, Art.\n36(2), reprinted in L. Lee, Vienna Convention on Consular\nRelations 237 (1966). A later amendment substituted the\n“full effect” phrase over the strenuous objection of several\nnegotiating countries whose delegates argued that the\nphrase would “modify the criminal law and regulations or\nthe criminal procedure of the receiving state.” 1 United\nNations Conference on Consular Relations, Official Re\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            17\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncords, Summary records of plenary meetings and of the\nmeetings of the First and Second Committees, U. N. Doc.\nA/CONF.25/16, ¶26, p. 38 (1963) (statement of Romania).\nSee also id., at ¶30, p. 38–39 (statement of Congo, Leo\npoldville) (amendment “implied the revision of certain\nlaws or regulations, which it would be difficult to carry out\nin practice”); id., 12th mtg., ¶4, at 40 (statement of Union\nof Soviet Socialist Republics) (rejecting the amendment\nbecause it would “force [signatories] to alter their criminal\nlaws and regulations”); id., 20th mtg., ¶81, at 84 (state\nment of Romania) (same); id., ¶95, at 86 (statement of\nCzechoslovakia) (same).\n  Based on this objection, the Soviet Union proposed\nreverting to the original language. The United Kingdom\nopposed that measure, explaining that it supported the\n“full effect” version because the initial (“not nullify”)\nversion\n     “meant that the laws and regulations of the receiving\n     State would govern the rights specified . . . provided\n     that they did not render those rights completely inop\n     erative—for ‘to nullify’ meant to ‘render completely\n     inoperative.’ But rights could be seriously impaired\n     without becoming completely inoperative. . . . Consu\n     lar officials should, of course, comply with the laws\n     and regulations of the receiving State in such matters\n     as the times for visiting prisoners, but it was most\n     important that the substance of the rights and obliga\n     tions specified . . . should be preserved.” Id., ¶¶6–7, at\n     40.\nNo one disagreed with the United Kingdom’s understand\ning of the words “full effect.” And with that understand\ning, the delegates voted down the Soviet Union’s proposal\nto revert to the original language, and ultimately adopted\nthe provision with the words “full effect.” Id., ¶109, at 87.\nAs so enacted, the provision reflects the “essential princi\n18              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nple of international law . . . ‘that reparation must, as far as\npossible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act\nand reestablish the situation which would, in all probabil\nity, have existed if that act had not been committed.’ ” 2\nRestatement §901, at 343.\n   Third, the decisions of the ICJ, fairly read, interpret the\nConvention similarly. In LaGrand and Avena, the ICJ\nread the Convention as authorizing an individual foreign\nnational to raise an Article 36 violation at trial or in a\npostconviction proceeding. See Avena, 2004 I. C. J., ¶121;\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 32–33, ¶125. The ICJ added\nthat the Convention requires member states to provide\n“effective” remedies in their courts for Convention viola\ntions. See Avena, supra, ¶138. And the ICJ made two\ncritical statements in respect to procedural default rules.\nIn LaGrand, the court said that in “itself, the [procedural\ndefault] rule does not violate Article 36 of the Vienna\nConvention.” 2001 I. C. J., at 22, ¶90 (emphasis added).\nRather, the “problem arises when the procedural default\nrule does not allow the detained individual to challenge a\nconviction and sentence by claiming . . . that the compe\ntent national authorities failed to comply with their obli\ngation to provide the requisite consular information ‘with\nout delay.’ ” Ibid. And the ICJ later specified that the\nConvention forbids American States to apply a procedural\ndefault rule to bar assertion of a Convention violation\nclaim “where it has been the failure of the United States [or\nof a State] itself to inform that may have precluded counsel\nfrom being in a position to have raised the question of a\nviolation of the Vienna Convention in the initial trial.”\nAvena, 2004 I. C. J., ¶113 (emphasis added).\n   This last statement indicates that the ICJ understood\nthe Convention to prevent application of a procedural\ndefault rule only where the arresting authorities’ failure to\ninform the foreign national of his Convention rights\nbrought about the procedural default in the first place.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nTaken together, the above statements make clear that the\nICJ read the Convention simply to require an effective\nremedy. It stated repeatedly that it did not dictate what\nthat remedy would be, as long it was offered as part of the\n“judicial process.” Id., ¶140–141. Hence, if the State\nprovides some other effective remedy, for example, review\nfor prejudice through a claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, then the Convention would not forbid application\nof ordinary procedural default rules. See ABA Guidelines\nfor the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel\nin Death Penalty Cases 10.6 (Rev. ed. 2003) (discussing\ndefense counsel’s obligation to seek consular assistance);\nValdez v. Oklahoma, 46 P. 3d 703, 710 (Okla. Crim. App.\n2002) (granting postconviction relief to a defendant who\nhad failed to raise a Vienna Convention violation at trial,\nbecause he showed that his lawyer “could have obtained\nfinancial, legal and investigative assistance from his\nconsulate” that would have produced important new evi\ndence); see also Ledezma v. State, 626 N. W. 2d 134, 152\n(Iowa 2001) (concluding that “all criminal defense attor\nneys representing foreign nationals should be aware of the\nright to consular access as provided by Article 36, and\nshould advise their clients of this right” because local\ncounsel “are not equipped to provide the same services as\nthe local consulate”); cf. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374\n(2005).\n   I will assume that the ICJ’s interpretation does not bind\nthis Court in this case. Statute of the International Court\nof Justice, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945) (ICJ\ndecisions have “binding force” only “between the parties\nand in respect of that particular case”). But as the major\nity points out, the ICJ’s decisions on this issue nonetheless\nwarrant our “ ‘respectful consideration.’ ” Ante, at 21.\nThat “respectful consideration” reflects the understanding\nthat uniformity is an important goal of treaty interpreta\ntion. See Olympic Airways v. Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 660\n20             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[I]t is reasonable to im\npute to the parties an intent that their respective courts\nstrive to interpret the treaty consistently”). And the ICJ’s\nposition as an international court specifically charged with\nthe duty to interpret numerous international treaties\n(including the Convention) provides a natural point of\nreference for national courts seeking that uniformity. See\nCounter-Memorial of the United States in Avena, 2004\nI. C. J. No. 128, p. 61, n. 128 (Nov. 3, 2003) (even if ICJ\ndecision binds only in particular case, “it is well-settled”\nthat an ICJ decision “may serve as authority beyond a\nparticular case”; citing authorities); Ordonez & Reilly,\nEffect of the Jurisprudence of the International Court of\nJustice on National Courts, in International Law Deci\nsions in National Courts 335, 365 (T. Franck & G. Fox eds.\n1996) (noting that ICJ cases interpreting treaties “are\nroutinely cited by domestic judges” in many countries “as\nevidence of international law”).\n   That “respectful consideration” also reflects an under\nstanding of the ICJ’s expertise in matters of treaty inter\npretation, a branch of international law.

S. ____ (2006)           23\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand history, but also with the ICJ’s interpretation of the\nsame treaty provision. In creating this last-mentioned\nconflict, as far as I can tell, the Court’s decision is un\nprecedented.\n   The Court supports its interpretation in three basic\nways. First, the majority says that “respectful considera\ntion” does not require us to agree with a decision that is\nclearly wrong. And, it says, the ICJ’s decision is clearly\nwrong. The ICJ’s interpretation of Article 36, the major\nity says, would permit a Convention violation claim to\n“trump not only procedural default rules, but any number\nof other rules requiring parties to present their legal\nclaims at the appropriate time for adjudication.” Ante, at\n22. That interpretation, it adds, “overlooks the impor\ntance of procedural default rules in an adversary system,”\nand is “inconsistent with the basic framework” of that\n“system.” Ante, at 21–22.\n   The majority’s argument, however, overlooks what the\nICJ actually said, overstates what it actually meant, and\nis inconsistent with what it actually did. In Avena and\nLaGrand, the ICJ did not say that the Convention neces\nsarily trumps any, let alone all, procedural rules that\nwould otherwise bar assertion of a Convention violation\nclaim. Nor did it say that the Convention necessarily\ntrumps all procedural default rules. Rather, it said that\nthe Convention prohibits application of those rules to a\nConvention violation claim only “where it has been the\nfailure of the United States [or of a State] itself to inform\nthat may have precluded counsel from being in a position\nto have raised the question of a violation of the Vienna\nConvention in the initial trial.” Avena, 2004 I. C. J., ¶113\n(emphasis added). Thus, Article 36(2) precludes proce\ndural default only where the defendant’s failure to bring\nhis claim sooner is the result of the underlying violation.\nSince procedural default rules themselves typically excuse\ndefaults where a defendant shows “cause and prejudice,” it\n24             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nis difficult to see how this statement “overlooks the impor\ntance of procedural default rules in an adversary system,”\nor is “inconsistent with the basic framework” of that\n“system.”\n   Moreover, Avena and LaGrand make clear what the\nICJ’s language taken in context means: The Convention\nrequires effective national remedies; hence local proce\ndural rules must give way (to the Convention’s “full effect”\nrequirement) when, but only when, it is the failure of the\narresting authorities to inform the defendant of his Con\nvention rights that prevented the defendant from bringing\nhis claim sooner. The opinions nowhere suggest that a\nState must provide a procedural remedy to a defendant\nwho, for example, sleeps on his rights.\n   Consider, too, what the ICJ did in Avena, a case that\nclarified the court’s earlier LaGrand opinion. It did not\nhold that American courts must ignore their procedural\ndefault rules in each of the 54 individual cases at issue.\nRather, it held that domestic courts must provide “review\nand reconsideration” in each case. Avena, 2004 I. C. J.,\n¶153(9). It nowhere forbids a state court conducting such a\n“review” to bar claims not timely made provided that the\nviolation did not itself cause the delay. See id., ¶139.\n   Perhaps the ICJ’s opinions are open to different inter\npretations. But how does reading those opinions as creat\ning an extreme rule of law, as reflecting a lack of under\nstanding of the “adversary system,” show “respectful\nconsideration”? To show that kind of respect, we must\nread the opinions in light of the Convention’s underlying\nlanguage and purposes and ask whether, or to what ex\ntent, they require modification of a State’s ordinary proce\ndural rules. See Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (laws and\nregulations “must enable full effect to be given to the\npurposes for which the rights accorded under this Article\nare intended” (emphasis added)).\n   Nothing in Avena suggests, for example, that an ar\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           25\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrested foreign national who was already aware of his\nrights under Article 36, or who had a lawyer who was\naware of those rights, necessarily would be entitled to an\nexemption from the State’s procedural default rules under\nArticle 36(2). Instead, as I have explained, see supra, at\n18–19, 23, Avena says only that Article 36(2) requires a\nstate court to excuse a procedural default rule where the\nState failed to inform the defendant of his consular access\nrights, and the defendant was not aware of those rights,\nand the State is unwilling to provide some other effective\nremedy, for example (if the lawyer acts incompetently in\nrespect to Convention rights of which the lawyer was\naware) an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The\nCourt’s reluctance to give LaGrand and Avena this per\nfectly reasonable interpretation reflects a failure to pro\nvide in practice the “respectful consideration” that we all\nbelieve the law demands.\n   The Court also relies on Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371\n(1998) (per curiam). In that case a foreign national, claim\ning a Convention violation, sought federal habeas corpus.\nThis Court upheld a denial of relief on the ground that the\nlower courts had correctly found that Breard procedurally\ndefaulted his Convention violation claim by failing to\ntimely raise it in his state-court proceedings. In reaching\nits conclusion, the Court rejected Breard’s claim that the\nConvention trumped the procedural default rule. Its\nreasons were (1) that “it has been recognized in interna\ntional law that, absent a clear and express statement to\nthe contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State\ngovern the implementation of the treaty in that State,” id.,\nat 375; (2) that this principle is “embodied in the Vienna\nConvention itself, which provides that the rights ex\npressed in the Convention ‘shall be exercised in conformity\nwith the laws and regulations of the receiving State,’ ”\nibid.; and (3) that the federal procedural default rule, as a\nlater-in-time federal statute, superseded any inconsistent\n26              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprovision in the Convention, id., at 376.\n    I do not believe that Breard controls the outcome of\nthese cases. With respect to the third ground for the\nCourt’s decision, Breard concerned a federal, rather than\n(as in Bustillo’s case) a state, procedural default rule.\nThose different kinds of rules are treated differently under\nthe Supremacy Clause. See ibid. (applying the rule that\n“ ‘an Act of Congress . . . is on a full parity with a treaty,\nand . . . when a statute which is subsequent in time is\ninconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of\nconflict renders the treaty null’ ”). Contrary to JUSTICE\nGINSBURG’s view, then, ante, at 4, there is no anomaly in\ntreating state law differently from federal law for these\npurposes, if Congress chooses to enact legislation binding\nonly the federal government in respect to a matter covered\nby a treaty that binds both the federal government and\nthe States. Therefore, reading the Convention to require\nthe state courts to set aside Virginia’s procedural default\nrule in Bustillo’s case (assuming for argument’s sake that\nhis case meets the criteria I have described, see supra, at\n15–16) would not call into question, let alone overrule,\n“Breard’s plain holding that the Convention does not\ntrump the [federal] procedural default doctrine,” ante, at\n18, n. 4 (opinion of the Court), even if that ruling on its\nown terms is still good law after Avena and LaGrand.\n    Moreover, the ICJ decided Avena and LaGrand after\nthis Court decided Breard. And it is not difficult to recon\ncile those cases with Breard because they do not directly\nconflict with Breard’s result. Rather, they interpret Arti\ncle 36(2) to require state procedural default rules some\ntimes to give way to the Convention, namely, when those\nrules prevent effective remedy by barring assertion of a\nclaim because of a delay caused by the Convention viola\ntion itself. I would read Breard as consistent with this\ninterpretation, i.e., as not saying that the Convention\nnever trumps any procedural default rule.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          27\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court complains that this treatment of Breard fails\nto give our own opinions “ ‘respectful consideration.’ ”\nAnte, at 18, n. 4. In fact, our opinions are entitled to far\nmore than respectful consideration; they are entitled to\nfull stare decisis effect. But, as I have explained, reading\nBreard not to decide the outcome in this case would nei\nther overrule Breard’s holding, nor reject outright its\nreading of the Convention. And, in any event, as a matter\nof the law of stare decisis, a modified reading of Breard is\nappropriate in light of the fact that the ICJ’s later deci\nsions amount to a “significant . . . subsequent develop\nment” of the law sufficient to lead to a reconsideration of\npast precedent. Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 236\n(1997); United States v. Percheman, 7 Pet. 51 (1833) (revis\niting prior treaty interpretation when new international\nlaw has come to light); see also Medellín, 544 U. S., at 689\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting) (“In the past the Court has\nrevisited its interpretation of a treaty when new interna\ntional law has come to light” (citing Percheman, supra, at\n89)). Indeed, the Court seems to recognize as much, in\nthat it spends a full six pages explaining why the ICJ’s\ninterpretation of the Convention is incorrect, see ante, at\n18–24, rather than simply rejecting Bustillo’s argument on\nthe ground that “ ‘respectful consideration’ of precedent\nshould begin at home.” Ante, at 18, n. 4.\n   And there are other reasons not to place too much reli\nance on the breadth of Breard’s language. Breard is a per\ncuriam decision that the Court had to reach within the few\nhours available between the time a petition for certiorari\nwas filed and a scheduled execution, the decision is fairly\nrecent, and the modification to which I refer requires no\nmore than reading an exception into Breard’s language,\nlanguage that in any event was not central to the Court’s\nholding.\n   The modification is appropriate too because the “full\neffect” proviso in Article 36(2) provides a “clear and ex\n28              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npress statement” that sometimes the Convention might\ntrump a domestic procedural rule. And in any event, it is\nnot even clear that such a clear statement rule actually\nexists. Breard’s statement of a presumption that only a\ntreaty provision with a “clear and express statement” can\ntrump “the procedural rules of the forum State,” 523 U. S.,\nat 375, is in tension with more fundamental interpretive\nrules in this area. See, e.g., Jordan v. Tashiro, 278 U. S.\n123, 127 (1928) (treaties must be construed liberally to\nprotect substantial rights); Asakura, 265 U. S., at 342\n(same); see also Vienna Convention on the Law of Trea\nties, opened for signature May 23, 1969, Art. 27, 1115\nU. N. T. S. 331, T. S. No. 58 (1980), 8 I. L. M. 679 (1969)\n(treaty parties may not invoke domestic law as an excuse\nfor failing to conform to their treaty obligations).\n   Indeed, the cases Breard cites for the proposition that a\nclear and express statement is required to trump a domes\ntic procedural rule seem not to establish it. Sun Oil Co. v.\nWortman, 486 U. S. 717, 723 (1988) (Court said only that\nit was a “rule in international law at the time the Consti\ntution was adopted” that procedural rules “may be gov\nerned by forum law even when the substance of the claim\nmust be governed by another State’s law”; case involved\ndomestic law and the Constitution’s Full Faith and Credit\nClause); Le Roy v. Crowninshield, 15 F. Cas. 362, 365, 371\n(Mass. 1820) (case involved conflict of laws, not an inter\nnational treaty); Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v.\nSchlunk, 486 U. S. 694, 700 (1988) (case said that “we\nalmost necessarily must refer to the internal law of the\nforum state” to find a service of process standard if a\ntreaty “does not prescribe” it); Société Nationale Indus\ntrielle Aérospatiale v. United States Dist. Court for South\nern Dist. of Iowa, 482 U. S. 522, 539–540, and n. 25 (1987)\n(case involving a specific treaty, not a general interpretive\nstandard).\n   Finally, the Court says it would be odd to treat Conven\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           29\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntion rights more favorably than rights protected by the\nU. S. Constitution. Ante, at 24. But “[a] treaty is in its\nnature a contract between two nations,” Foster, 2 Pet., at\n314, and nations are of course free to agree to grant one\nanother’s citizens protections that differ from the protec\ntions enjoyed by citizens at home, particularly when cir\ncumstances call for differential treatment. See infra, at\n30.\n   In sum, I find strong reasons for interpreting the Con\nvention as sometimes prohibiting a state court from apply\ning its ordinarily procedural default rule to a Convention\nviolation claim. The fact that the ICJ reached a similar\nconclusion in LaGrand and Avena adds strength to those\nreasons. And I cannot agree with the majority’s argu\nments to the contrary.\n   Consequently, I would remand No. 05–51 so that Busti\nllo can argue to the Virginia state courts that they should\nmodify their ordinary procedural default requirements. I\nwould leave it to the state courts to determine in the first\ninstance whether state law has provided Bustillo the\neffective remedy that the Convention requires and how it\nhas done so (whether through “cause and prejudice” excep\ntions, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, or other\nways). Cf. LaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 33, ¶125 (the “choice\nof [implementing] means must be left to the United\nStates”).\n                              IV\n  The final question presented asks whether a Convention\nviolation “result[s] in the suppression” of the evidence, say\na confession, that a foreign national provided police before\nbeing informed of his Convention rights. Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 04–10566, p. i. The majority answers in absolute\nterms, stating that “suppression is not an appropriate\nremedy for a violation of the Convention.” See ante, at 2.\nI agree with the majority insofar as it rejects the argu\n30             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nment that the Convention creates a Miranda-style “auto\nmatic exclusionary rule.” Ante, at 8; see also Miranda,\n384 U. S., at 471; cf., e.g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643\n(1961); Franks v. Delaware, 438 U. S. 154 (1978). But I do\nnot agree with the absolute nature of its statement.\nRather, sometimes suppression could prove the only effec\ntive remedy. And, if that is so, then the Convention,\nwhich insists upon effective remedies, would require sup\npression in an appropriate case. Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at\n101.\n   Much depends upon the circumstances. It may be true\nthat in “most circumstances, there is likely to be little\nconnection between an Article 36 violation and evidence or\nstatements obtained by police.” Ante, at 14. Miranda\nsurely helps, for it guarantees that police will inform an\narrested foreign national of his right to contact a lawyer.\nBut one cannot guarantee in advance that Miranda will\nadequately cure every seriously prejudicial failure to in\nform an arrested person of his right to contact his consular\npost. One can imagine a case, for example, involving a\nforeign national who speaks little English, who comes from\na country where confessions made to the police cannot be\nused in court as evidence, who does not understand that a\nstate-provided lawyer can provide him crucial assistance in\nan interrogation, and whose native community has great\nfear of police abuse. Indeed, Sanchez-Llamas made allega\ntions similar to these in his case. Brief for Petitioner San\nchez-Llamas 5-7; see also Brief for the Government of the\nUnited Mexican States as Amicus Curiae 10.\n   While JUSTICE GINSBURG is correct that a defendant\nwho is prejudiced under the Convention may be able to\nshow that his confession is involuntary under Miranda,\nante, at 2, I am not persuaded that this will always be so.\nA person who fully understands his Miranda rights but\ndoes not fully understand the implications of these rights\nfor our legal system may or may not be able to show that\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          31\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhis confession was involuntary under Miranda, but he will\ncertainly have a claim under the Vienna Convention. In\nsuch a case suppression of a confession may prove the only\neffective remedy. I would not rule out the existence of\nsuch cases in advance.\n  Furthermore, the majority is wrong to say that it would\n“be startling if the Convention were read to require sup\npression” in such cases because suppression “is an entirely\nAmerican legal creation.” Ante, at 8 (opinion of the Court).\nI put to the side the fact that “suppression” is in origin a\nBritish, not an American, remedy. See Dickerson v.\nUnited States, 530 U. S. 428, 433 (2000) (noting that “the\nroots of the [Miranda] test developed in the common law”\nand citing English cases); see also King v. Warickshall, 1\nLeach 262, 263–264, 168 Eng. Rep. 234, 235 (K. B. 1783)\n(coerced confessions are inadmissible in British courts).\nRegardless, it is not “startling” to read the Convention as\nsometimes requiring suppression. That is because those\nwho wrote the Convention were fully aware that the crimi\nnal justice systems of different nations differ in important\nways. They did not list particular remedies. They used\ngeneral language. That language requires every member\nnation to give “full effect” to Article 36(1)’s “purposes.”\nArt. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. That language leaves it up\nto each nation to determine how to implement Article\n36(1)’s requirements. Avena, 2004 I. C. J., ¶127; LaGrand,\nsupra, at 32–33, ¶125. But as a matter of logic and pur\npose that language must also insist upon the use of sup\npression if and when there are circumstances in which\nsuppression provides the only effective remedy.\n  These differences may also help to explain what the\nmajority says is the disturbing circumstance that “nearly\nall” other signatories to the Convention “refuse to recog\nnize” suppression “as a matter of domestic law,” and there\nfore that “Sanchez-Llamas would [not] be afforded the\nrelief he seeks here in any of the other 169 countries party\n32             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto the Vienna Convention.” Ante, at 9. In fact, there are\nseveral cases from common-law jurisdictions suggesting\nthat suppression is an appropriate remedy for a Conven\ntion violation. See, e.g., Tan Seng Kiah v. Queen (2001)\n160 F. L. R. 26 (Ct. Crim. App. N. Terr.) (Australian case\nsuppressing confession obtained in violation of statute\nrequiring police to notify defendant of right to contact\nconsulate upon arrest); Queen v. Tan [2001] W. A. S. C.\n275 (Sup. Ct. W. Australia in Crim.) (Australian case\nconsidering but declining to suppress evidence based on\nviolation of same statute); Regina v. Partak, 160 C. C. C.\n3d, at ¶63 (Canada) (concluding that suppression is inap\npropriate, not because it was never a proper remedy under\nthe Vienna Convention but because the defendant “com\npletely failed to demonstrate any prejudice arising from\nthe failure of the police to notify him of his consular\nrights”).\n   I concede the absence of such cases from civil law juris\ndictions. But the criminal justice systems in those nations\ndiffer from our own in significant ways. Civil-law nations,\nfor example, typically rely more heavily than do we upon\njudicial investigation, questioning by a neutral magistrate,\nthe compiling of all evidence into a dossier, and later\nreview of that dossier at trial by judges who may sit with\nout our type of jury. In such a system, formal suppression\nproceedings may prove less frequent. Judges, as a matter\nof practice, may simply disregard improperly obtained\nevidence, they may discount the significance of that evi\ndence, or they may adjust the nature of future proceedings\nor even the final sentence accordingly. See Damaška,\nEvidentiary Barriers to Conviction and Two Models of\nCriminal Procedure: A Comparative Study, 121 U. Pa.\nL. Rev. 506, 522 (1972) (explaining why many civil law\nsystem “provisions regulating the interrogation of defen\ndants are silent as to the admissibility of testimony ob\ntained in violation of proper interrogation procedures”);\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Rev. 799, 831 (1997) (“Because [civil law] courts decide\nboth questions of law and of fact, exclusionary rules in\n[those] courts are more appropriately described as rules of\ndecision than rules of exclusion—what evidence the fact-\nfinder may use to support its decision, rather than what\nevidence may be presented to the factfinder. The presid\ning judge is well acquainted with all evidence in the dos\nsier and often must ‘put aside’ or ‘forget about’ evidence\nwhich legally cannot be used to support the judgment”);\nBradley, The Exclusionary Rule in Germany, 96 Harv.\nL. Rev. 1032, 1065 (1982) (noting that in German inquisi\ntorial system, for many police violations, “the fact that\nevidence was legally or illegally obtained is not disposi\ntive”; instead, the “decision to admit or suppress will be\ndetermined by balancing the relative importance of the\ndefendant’s privacy rights against the seriousness of the\noffense charged”); Declaration of Professor Thomas Wei\ngend, Annex 3 to Counter-Memorial of the United States,\nin Avena, 2004 I. C. J. No. 128, p. A367, ¶20 (Oct. 22,\n2003) (noting that in the German and Dutch legal\nsystems, a procedural violation can lead to a reduced\nsentence).\n   Thus, the absence of reported decisions formally sup\npressing confessions obtained in violation of the Conven\ntion tells us nothing at all about whether such nations\ngive “full effect” to the “purposes” of Article 36(1). The\nexistence of cases in such nations where a court denies a\ndefense request to suppress, of course, might well shed\nlight on that nation’s readiness to provide an effective\nremedy. The Solicitor General cites one (and only one)\nsuch case. See Judgment of Nov. 7, 2001, 5 BGHSt 116\n(deciding in light of LaGrand that the Convention creates\nindividual rights, but declining to suppress confession).\nThat is the only support I have found for the claim that\n34              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsomehow the petitioners here are asking the United States\nto provide that which other countries deny, an effective\nremedy.\n                               V\n   The United States joined the Vienna Convention, and\nurged other nations to join, in order to promote “the or\nderly and effective conduct of consular relations between\nStates,” and to guarantee “the protection of our citizens\nabroad.” Vienna Convention on Consular Relations with\nOptional Protocol, S. Exec. Doc. No. E, 91st Cong., 1st\nSess., 60, 75 (1969). In doing so, the United States, along\nwith the other 169 nations that ratified the Convention,\nundertook a complex task. They sought not only to protect\ntheir consular posts, but also to assure that their nationals\nwould have access to those posts when arrested abroad.\nBut how to enforce those rights poses a difficult question\nbecause the enforcement mechanism inevitably will vary\ndepending upon the details of a nation’s legal system. For\npractical, legal, and political, reasons, it is difficult to\nwrite enforcement details into an international treaty.\nYet without any such guarantees it may prove difficult to\nprevent an individual nation, through application of its\nsystem’s details, from denying in practice the rights that\nthe treaty sought to assure.\n   The Convention deals with this problem by including a\ngeneral provision that both severely limits the treaty’s\nintrusion into the functioning of a domestic legal system\nand also safeguards consular access rights from serious\ndomestic neglect. It does so by stating that those rights\nshall “be exercised in conformity with the laws and regula\ntions of the receiving State,” provided that those laws and\nregulations give “full effect” to Article 36(1)’s purposes.\nArt. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101.\n   Applying this provision to our own legal system, I would\nseek to minimize the Convention’s intrusion and federal\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            35\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nintrusion into the workings of state legal systems while\nsimultaneously keeping faith with the Convention’s basic\nobjectives. That is why I believe that the Convention here\nrequires individual States to make an exception (akin to a\n“cause and prejudice” exception) to a state procedural\ndefault rule if (1) the defendant’s failure to raise a claim of\na Convention violation in a timely manner itself was a\nproduct of that violation, and (2) state law provides no\nother procedural means through which the State’s courts\ncan provide “review,” “reconsideration,” and effective\nrelief. Similarly, I would hold that whether the Conven\ntion requires a state court to suppress a confession ob\ntained after an Article 36 violation depends on whether\nsuppression is the only remedy available that will effec\ntively cure related prejudice. And because neither state\ncourt applied this standard below, I would remand each\ncase for that initial consideration. See 338 Ore., at 269,\n108 P. 3d, at 574 (rejecting Sanchez-Llamas’ request for\nsuppression remedy solely on the ground that the Conven\ntion “does not create rights that individual foreign nation\nals may assert in a criminal proceeding”); App. to Pet. for\nCert. 47a (rejecting Bustillo’s request for state postconvic\ntion relief based on a standard different from that set forth\nhere).\n   The interpretation of the Convention that I would adopt\nis consistent with the ICJ’s own interpretation and should\nnot impose significant new burdens upon state criminal\njustice systems. America’s legal traditions have long\nincluded detailed rules for discovering and curing prejudi\ncial legal errors. Indeed, many States already have “cause\nand prejudice” exceptions likely broad enough to provide\nthe “effective” relief the Convention demands. And, in any\nevent, it leaves the States free to apply their own judicial\nremedies in light of, and bounded by, the Convention’s\ngeneral instructions.\n   The Court, I fear, does not rise to the interpretive chal\n36              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlenge. Rather than seek to apply Article 36’s language\nand purposes to the federal/state relationships that char\nacterize America’s legal system, it simply rejects the no\ntion that Article 36(2) sets forth any relevant requirement.\nThat approach leaves States free to deny effective relief for\nConvention violations, despite America’s promise to pro\nvide just such relief. That approach risks weakening\nrespect abroad for the rights of foreign nationals, a respect\nthat America, in 1969, sought to make effective through\nout the world. And it increases the difficulties faced by\nthe United States and other nations who would, through\nbinding treaties, strengthen the role that law can play in\nassuring all citizens, including American citizens, fair\ntreatment throughout the world.\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145628/", "sha1": "14029f187327c13e9272c1aaf75f6e52c144b172", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2005-083", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:06:04"}
