MURPHY ET VIR. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 05–18. Argued April 19, 2006—Decided June 26, 2006\nAfter respondents prevailed in their Individuals with Disabilities Edu\n  cation Act (IDEA) action to require petitioner school board to pay for\n  their son’s private school tuition, they sought fees for services ren\n  dered by an educational consultant during the proceedings, relying\n  on an IDEA provision that permits a court to “award reasonable at\n  torneys’ fees as part of the costs” to prevailing parents, 20 U. S. C.\n  §1415(i)(3)(B). The District Court granted their motion in part. Af\n  firming, the Second Circuit noted that, under Crawford Fitting Co. v.\n  J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, and West Virginia Univ. Hospitals,\n  Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be\n  read to permit recovery of expert fees without explicit statutory au\n  thority, but concluded that a congressional Conference Committee\n  Report relating to §1415(i)(3)(B) and a footnote in Casey referencing\n  that Report showed that the IDEA authorized such reimbursement.\nHeld: Section §1415(i)(3)(B) does not authorize prevailing parents to\n recover expert fees. Pp. 3–12.\n    (a) The resolution of this question is guided by the fact that Con\n gress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause. While\n Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses fed\n eral money to the States, any conditions it attaches to a State’s ac\n ceptance of such funds must be set out “unambiguously.” Pennhurst\n State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17. Fund re\n cipients are bound only by those conditions that they accept “volun\n tarily and knowingly,” ibid., and States cannot knowingly accept con\n ditions of which they are “unaware” or which they are “unable to\n ascertain,” ibid. Thus, the question here is whether the IDEA fur\n nishes clear notice regarding expert fees. Pp. 3–4.\n2         ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                          MURPHY                                                  \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n       (b) The Court begins with the IDEA’s text, for if its “language is\n    plain,” the courts’ function “ ‘ “is to enforce it according to its terms.” ’ ”\n    Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530\n    U. S. 1, 6. While §1415(i)(3)(B) provides for an award of “reasonable\n    attorneys’ fees,” it does not even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds\n    makes a State responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for the\n    services of experts. “Costs” is a term of art that does not generally\n    include expert fees. The use of “costs” rather than “expenses”\n    strongly suggests that §1415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-\n    ended provision making States liable for all expenses. Moreover,\n    §1415(i)(3)(B) says not that a court may award “costs” but that it may\n    award attorney’s fees “as part of the costs.” This language simply\n    adds reasonable attorney’s fees to the list of recoverable costs set out\n    in 28 U. S. C. §1920, the general statute covering taxation of costs,\n    which is strictly limited by §1821. Thus, §1415(i)(3)(B)’s text does not\n    authorize an award of additional expert fees, and it certainly fails to\n    present the clear notice required by the Spending Clause. Other\n    IDEA provisions point strongly in the same direction. Of little sig\n    nificance here is a provision in the Handicapped Children’s Protec\n    tion Act of 1986 requiring the General Accounting Office to collect\n    data on awards to prevailing parties in IDEA cases, but making no\n    mention of consultants or experts or their fees. And the fact that the\n    provision directed the GAO to compile data on the hours spent by\n    consultants in IDEA cases does not mean that Congress intended for\n    States to compensate prevailing parties for fees billed by these con\n    sultants. Pp. 4–8.\n       (c) Crawford Fitting Co. and Casey strongly reinforce the conclu\n    sion that the IDEA does not unambiguously authorize prevailing\n    parents to recover expert fees. Crawford Fitting Co.’s reasoning sup\n    ports the conclusion that the term “costs” in §1415(i)(3)(B), like\n    “costs” in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), the provision at issue\n    there, is defined by the categories of expenses enumerated in 28\n    U. S. C. §1920. This conclusion is buttressed by the principle, recog\n    nized in Crawford Fitting Co., that no statute will be construed to au\n    thorize taxing witness fees as costs unless the statute “refer[s] explic\n    itly to witness fees.” 482 U. S., at 445. The conclusion that the IDEA\n    does not authorize expert fee awards is confirmed even more dra\n    matically by Casey, where the Court held that 42 U. S. C. §1988, a\n    fee-shifting provision with wording virtually identical to that of 20\n    U. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B), did not empower a district court to award ex\n    pert fees to a prevailing party. 482 U. S., at 102. The Second Circuit\n    misunderstood the meaning of the Casey footnote on which it relied.\n    That footnote did not state that the Conference Committee Report set\n    out the correct interpretation of §1415(i)(3)(B) or provided the clear\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

Its thrust was simply\n  that “attorneys’ fees,” standing alone, is generally not understood as\n  encompassing expert fees. Pp. 8–11.\n    (d) Respondents’ additional arguments are unpersuasive. The\n  IDEA’s goals of “ensur[ing] that all children with disabilities have\n  available to them a free appropriate public education,”\n  §1400(d)(1)(A), and of safeguarding parents’ right to challenge ad\n  verse school decisions are too general to provide much support for\n  their reading of the IDEA. And the IDEA’s legislative history is in\n  sufficient help, where everything other than that history overwhelm\n  ingly suggests that expert fees may not be recovered.

The District Court granted respon\ndents’ request in part. It held that only the value of Arons’\ntime spent between the hearing request and the ruling in\nrespondents’ favor could properly be considered charges\nincurred in an “action or proceeding brought” under the\nAct, see 20 U.

This reduced the maximum recov\nery to $8,650. The District Court also held that Arons, a\nnonlawyer, could be compensated only for time spent on\nexpert consulting services, not for time spent on legal\nrepresentation, id., at *4, but it concluded that all the\nrelevant time could be characterized as falling within the\ncompensable category, and thus allowed compensation for\nthe full $8,650, id., at *10.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\n402 F. 3d 332 (2005). Acknowledging that other Circuits\nhad taken the opposite view, the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that “Congress intended to and did\nauthorize the reimbursement of expert fees in IDEA ac\ntions.” Id., at 336. The court began by discussing two\ndecisions of this Court holding that expert fees could not\nbe recovered as taxed costs under particular cost- or fee-\nshifting provisions. See Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gib\nbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 (1987) (interpreting Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 54(d) and 28 U. S. C. §1920); West Virginia Univ.\nHospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83 (1991) (interpreting 42\nU. S. C. §1988 (1988 ed.)). According to these decisions, the\ncourt noted, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be read\nto permit a prevailing party to recover expert fees without\n“‘explicit statutory authority’ indicating that Congress\nintended for that sort of fee-shifting.” 402 F. 3d, at 336.\n   Ultimately, though, the court was persuaded by a state\nment in the Conference Committee Report relating to 20\nU. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B) and by a footnote in Casey that\nmade reference to that Report. 402 F. 3d, at 336–337\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Based on\nthese authorities, the court concluded that it was required\nto interpret the IDEA to authorize the award of the costs\nthat prevailing parents incur in hiring experts. 402 F. 3d,\nat 336.\n   We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. ____ (2006), to resolve\nthe conflict among the Circuits with respect to whether\nCongress authorized the compensation of expert fees to\nprevailing parents in IDEA actions. Compare Goldring v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 416 F. 3d 70, 73–77 (CADC 2005);\nNeosho R-V School Dist. v. Clark ex rel. Clark, 315 F. 3d\n1022, 1031–1033 (CA8 2003); T. D. v. LaGrange School\nDist. No. 102, 349 F. 3d 469, 480–482 (CA7 2003), with\n402 F. 3d 332 (CA2 2005). We now reverse.\n                              II\n  Our resolution of the question presented in this case is\nguided by the fact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursu\nant to the Spending Clause. U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1;\nsee Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. ____ (2005). Like its\nstatutory predecessor, the IDEA provides federal funds to\nassist state and local agencies in educating children with\ndisabilities “and conditions such funding upon a State’s\ncompliance with extensive goals and procedures.” Board of\nEd. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester\nCty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 179 (1982).\n  Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it\ndisburses federal money to the States, see, e.g., South\nDakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206–207 (1987), but when\nCongress attaches conditions to a State’s acceptance of\nfederal funds, the conditions must be set out “unambigu\nously,” see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halder\nman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981); Rowley, supra, at 204, n. 26.\n“[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is\nmuch in the nature of a contract,” and therefore, to be bound\nby “federally imposed conditions,” recipients of federal funds\n4     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\nmust accept them “voluntarily and knowingly.” Pennhurst,\n451 U. S., at 17. States cannot knowingly accept conditions\nof which they are “unaware” or which they are “unable to\nascertain.” Ibid. Thus, in the present case, we must view\nthe IDEA from the perspective of a state official who is\nengaged in the process of deciding whether the State should\naccept IDEA funds and the obligations that go with those\nfunds. We must ask whether such a state official would\nclearly understand that one of the obligations of the Act is\nthe obligation to compensate prevailing parents for expert\nfees. In other words, we must ask whether the IDEA\nfurnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in\nthis case.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n  In considering whether the IDEA provides clear notice,\nwe begin with the text. We have “stated time and again\nthat courts must presume that a legislature says in a\nstatute what it means and means in a statute what it says\nthere.” Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249,\n253–254 (1992). When the statutory “language is plain, the\nsole function of the courts—at least where the disposition\nrequired by the text is not absurd—is to enforce it according\nto its terms.” Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union\nPlanters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000) (quoting United\nStates v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241\n(1989), in turn quoting Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S.\n470, 485 (1917); internal quotation marks omitted).\n  The governing provision of the IDEA, 20 U. S. C.\n§1415(i)(3)(B), provides that “[i]n any action or proceeding\nbrought under this section, the court, in its discretion,\nmay award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs”\nto the parents of “a child with a disability” who is the\n“prevailing party.” While this provision provides for an\naward of “reasonable attorneys’ fees,” this provision does\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds makes a\nState responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for\nservices rendered by experts.\n   Respondents contend that we should interpret the term\n“costs” in accordance with its meaning in ordinary usage\nand that §1415(i)(3)(B) should therefore be read to “au\nthorize reimbursement of all costs parents incur in IDEA\nproceedings, including expert costs.” Brief for Respon\ndents 17.\n   This argument has multiple flaws. For one thing, as the\nCourt of Appeals in this case acknowledged, “ ‘costs’ is a\nterm of art that generally does not include expert fees.”\n402 F. 3d, at 336. The use of this term of art, rather than\na term such as “expenses,” strongly suggests that\n§1415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-ended provi\nsion that makes participating States liable for all expenses\nincurred by prevailing parents in connection with an\nIDEA case—for example, travel and lodging expenses or\nlost wages due to time taken off from work. Moreover,\ncontrary to respondents’ suggestion, §1415(i)(3)(B) does\nnot say that a court may award “costs” to prevailing par\nents; rather, it says that a court may award reasonable\nattorney’s fees “as part of the costs” to prevailing parents.\nThis language simply adds reasonable attorney’s fees\nincurred by prevailing parents to the list of costs that\nprevailing parents are otherwise entitled to recover. This\nlist of otherwise recoverable costs is obviously the list set\nout in 28 U. S. C. §1920, the general statute governing the\ntaxation of costs in federal court, and the recovery of\nwitness fees under §1920 is strictly limited by §1821,\nwhich authorizes travel reimbursement and a $40 per\ndiem. Thus, the text of 20 U. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B) does not\nauthorize an award of any additional expert fees, and it\ncertainly fails to provide the clear notice that is required\nunder the Spending Clause.\n   Other provisions of the IDEA point strongly in the same\n6     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\ndirection. While authorizing the award of reasonable\nattorney’s fees, the Act contains detailed provisions that\nare designed to ensure that such awards are indeed rea\nsonable. See §§1415(i)(3)(C)–(G). The absence of any\ncomparable provisions relating to expert fees strongly\nsuggests that recovery of expert fees is not authorized.\nMoreover, the lack of any reference to expert fees in\n§1415(d)(2) gives rise to a similar inference. This provi\nsion, which generally requires that parents receive “a full\nexplanation of the procedural safeguards” available under\n§1415 and refers expressly to “attorneys’ fees,” makes no\nmention of expert fees.\n                               B\n   Respondents contend that their interpretation of\n§1415(i)(3)(B) is supported by a provision of the Handi\ncapped Children’s Protection Act of 1986 that required the\nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) to collect certain data,\n§4(b)(3), 100 Stat. 797 (hereinafter GAO study provision),\nbut this provision is of little significance for present pur\nposes. The GAO study provision directed the Comptroller\nGeneral, acting through the GAO, to compile data on,\namong other things: “(A) the specific amount of attorneys’\nfees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party” in\nIDEA cases for a particular period of time, and (B) “the\nnumber of hours spent by personnel, including attorneys\nand consultants, involved in the action or proceeding, and\nexpenses incurred by the parents and the State educa\ntional agency and local educational agency.” Id., at 797–\n798.\n   Subparagraph (A) would provide some support for re\nspondents’ position if it directed the GAO to compile data\non awards to prevailing parties of the expense of hiring\nconsultants, but that is not what subparagraph (A) says.\nSubparagraph (A) makes no mention of consultants or\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                       7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nexperts or their fees.1\n  Subparagraph (B) similarly does not help respondents.\nSubparagraph (B), which directs the GAO to study “the\nnumber of hours spent [in IDEA cases] by personnel,\nincluding . . . consultants,” says nothing about the award\nof fees to such consultants. Just because Congress di\nrected the GAO to compile statistics on the hours spent by\nconsultants in IDEA cases, it does not follow that Con\ngress meant for States to compensate prevailing parties\nfor the fees billed by these consultants.\n  Respondents maintain that “Congress’ direction to the\nGAO would be inexplicable if Congress did not anticipate\nthat the expenses for ‘consultants’ would be recoverable,”\nBrief for Respondents 19, but this is incorrect. There are\nmany reasons why Congress might have wanted the GAO\nto gather data on expenses that were not to be taxed as\ncosts. Knowing the costs incurred by IDEA litigants might\nbe useful in considering future procedural amendments\n(which might affect these costs) or a future amendment\nregarding fee shifting. And, in fact, it is apparent that the\n——————\n  1 Because   subparagraph (A) refers to both “costs” and “expenses”\nawarded to prevailing parties and because it is generally presumed that\nstatutory language is not superfluous, it could be argued that this provi\nsion manifests the expectation that prevailing parties would be awarded\ncertain “expenses” not included in the list of “costs” set out in 28 U. S. C.\n§1920 and that expert fees were intended to be among these unenumer\nated “expenses.” This argument fails because, whatever expectation this\nlanguage might seem to evidence, the fact remains that neither 20 U. S. C.\n§1415 nor any other provision of the IDEA authorizes the award of any\n“expenses” other than “costs.” Recognizing this, respondents argue not\nthat they are entitled to recover “expenses” that are not “costs,” but that\nexpert fees are recoverable “costs.” As a result, the reference to awards of\nboth “expenses” and “costs” does not support respondents’ position. The\nreference to “expenses” may relate to IDEA actions brought in state court,\n§1415(i)(2)(A), where “expenses” other than “costs” might be receivable.\nOr the reference may be surplusage. While it is generally presumed that\nstatutes do not contain surplusage, instances of surplusage are not\nunknown.\n8          ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                           MURPHY                                            \n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\nGAO study provision covered expenses that could not be\ntaxed as costs. For example, the GAO was instructed to\ncompile statistics on the hours spent by all attorneys\ninvolved in an IDEA action or proceeding, even though the\nAct did not provide for the recovery of attorney’s fees by a\nprevailing state or local educational agency.2 Similarly,\nthe GAO was directed to compile data on “expenses in\ncurred by the parents,” not just those parents who prevail\nand are thus eligible to recover taxed costs.\n  In sum, the terms of the IDEA overwhelmingly support\nthe conclusion that prevailing parents may not recover the\ncosts of experts or consultants. Certainly the terms of the\nIDEA fail to provide the clear notice that would be needed\nto attach such a condition to a State’s receipt of IDEA\nfunds.\n                              IV\n   Thus far, we have considered only the text of the IDEA,\nbut perhaps the strongest support for our interpretation of\nthe IDEA is supplied by our decisions and reasoning in\nCrawford Fitting, 482 U. S. 437, and Casey, 499 U. S. 83.\nIn light of those decisions, we do not see how it can be said\nthat the IDEA gives a State unambiguous notice regarding\nliability for expert fees.\n   In Crawford Fitting, the Court rejected an argument\nvery similar to respondents’ argument that the term\n“costs” in §1415(i)(3)(B) should be construed as an open-\nended reference to prevailing parents’ expenses. It was\nargued in Crawford Fitting that Federal Rule of Civil\n——————\n    2 In\n      2000, the attorneys’ fees provision provided only an award to\nprevailing parents. See 20 U. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B). In 2004, Congress\namended §1415(i)(3)(B) to include two additional awards. See §101,\n118 Stat. 2724. The amendments provided awards “to a prevailing\nparty who is a State educational agency or local educational agency”\nwhere the complaint filed is frivolous or presented for an improper\npurpose, such as to harass, delay, or increase the cost of litigation. See\n20 U. S. C. A. §§1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(II)–(III) (Supp. 2006).\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nProcedure 54(d), which provides for the award of “costs” to\na prevailing party, authorizes the award of costs not listed\nin 28 U. S. C. §1821. 482 U. S., at 439. The Court held,\nhowever, that Rule 54(d) does not give a district judge\n“discretion to tax whatever costs may seem appropriate”;\nrather, the term “costs” in Rule 54(d) is defined by the list\nset out in §1920. Id., at 441. Because the recovery of\nwitness fees, see §1920(3), is strictly limited by §1821, the\nCourt observed, a broader interpretation of Rule 54(d)\nwould mean that the Rule implicitly effected a partial\nrepeal of those provisions. Id., at 442. But, the Court\nwarned, “[w]e will not lightly infer that Congress has\nrepealed §§1920 and 1821, either through Rule 54(d) or\nany other provision not referring explicitly to witness\nfees.” Id., at 445.\n  The reasoning of Crawford Fitting strongly supports the\nconclusion that the term “costs” in 20 U. S. C.\n§1415(i)(3)(B), like the same term in Rule 54(d), is defined\nby the categories of expenses enumerated in 28 U. S. C.\n§1920. This conclusion is buttressed by the principle,\nrecognized in Crawford Fitting, that no statute will be\nconstrued as authorizing the taxation of witness fees as\ncosts unless the statute “refer[s] explicitly to witness fees.”\n482 U. S., at 445; see also ibid. (“absent explicit statutory\nor contractual authorization for the taxation of the ex\npenses of a litigant’s witness as costs, federal courts are\nbound by the limitations set out in 28 U. S. C. §1821 and\n§1920”).\n  Our decision in Casey confirms even more dramatically\nthat the IDEA does not authorize an award of expert fees.\nIn Casey, as noted above, we interpreted a fee-shifting\nprovision, 42 U. S. C. §1988, the relevant wording of which\nwas virtually identical to the wording of 20 U. S. C.\n§1415(i)(3)(B). Compare ibid. (authorizing the award of\n“reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs” to prevail\ning parents) with 42 U. S. C. §1988(b) (1988 ed.) (permit\n10    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                    \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\nting prevailing parties in certain civil rights actions to be\nawarded “a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs”).\nWe held that §1988 did not empower a district court to\naward expert fees to a prevailing party. Casey, supra, at\n102. To decide in favor of respondents here, we would\nhave to interpret the virtually identical language in 20\nU. S. C. §1415 as having exactly the opposite meaning.\nIndeed, we would have to go further and hold that the\nrelevant language in the IDEA unambiguously means\nexactly the opposite of what the nearly identical language\nin 42 U. S. C. §1988 was held to mean in Casey.\n   The Court of Appeals, as noted above, was heavily influ\nenced by a Casey footnote, see 402 F. 3d, at 336–337 (quot\ning 499 U. S., at 91–92, n. 5), but the court misunderstood\nthe footnote’s meaning. The text accompanying the foot\nnote argued, based on an analysis of several fee-shifting\nstatutes, that the term “attorney’s fees” does not include\nexpert fees. Id., at 88–91. In the footnote, we commented\non petitioners’ invocation of the Conference Committee\nReport relating to 20 U. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B), which stated:\n“ ‘The conferees intend[ed] that the term “attorneys’ fees as\npart of the costs” include reasonable expenses and fees of\nexpert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or\nevaluation which is found to be necessary for the prepara\ntion of the . . . case.’ ” 499 U. S., at 91–92, n. 5 (quoting\nH. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99–687, at 5; ellipsis in original).\nThis statement, the footnote commented, was “an appar\nent effort to depart from ordinary meaning and to define a\nterm of art.” 499 U. S., at 92, n. 5. The footnote did not\nstate that the Conference Committee Report set out the\ncorrect interpretation of §1415(i)(3)(B), much less that the\nReport was sufficient, despite the language of the statute,\nto provide the clear notice required under the Spending\nClause. The thrust of the footnote was simply that the\nterm “attorneys’ fees,” standing alone, is generally not\nunderstood as encompassing expert fees. Thus, Crawford\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

S. C.\n§1400(d)(1)(A) as well as the goal of “safeguard[ing] the\nrights of parents to challenge school decisions that ad\nversely affect their child.” Brief for Respondents 20.\nThese goals, however, are too general to provide much\nsupport for respondents’ reading of the terms of the IDEA.\nThe IDEA obviously does not seek to promote these goals\nat the expense of all other considerations, including fiscal\nconsiderations. Because the IDEA is not intended in all\ninstances to further the broad goals identified by the\nrespondents at the expense of fiscal considerations, the\ngoals cited by respondents do little to bolster their argu\nment on the narrow question presented here.3\n  Finally, respondents vigorously argue that Congress\nclearly intended for prevailing parents to be compensated\nfor expert fees. They rely on the legislative history of\n§1415 and in particular on the following statement in the\n\n——————\n  3 Respondents note that a GAO report stated that expert witness fees\n\nare reimbursable expenses. See Brief for Respondents 19 (citing GAO,\nSpecial Education: The Attorney Fees Provision of Public Law 99–372,\np. 13 (Nov. 1989)). But this passing reference in a report issued by an\nagency not responsible for implementing the IDEA is plainly insuffi\ncient to provide clear notice regarding the scope of the conditions\nattached to the receipt of IDEA funds.\n12    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

Putting the\nlegislative history aside, we see virtually no support for\nrespondents’ position.

The Court extracts from Pennhurst State School and\nHospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981), a “clear\nnotice” requirement, and deems it applicable in this case\nbecause Congress enacted the Individuals with Disabili\nties Education Act (IDEA), as it did the legislation at issue\nin Pennhurst, pursuant to the Spending Clause. Ante, at\n3–4. That extraction, in my judgment, is unwarranted.\nPennhurst’s “clear notice” requirement should not be\nunmoored from its context. The Court there confronted a\nplea to impose “an unexpected condition for compliance—a\nnew [programmatic] obligation for participating States.”\nBell v. New Jersey, 461 U. S. 773, 790, n. 17 (1983). The\ncontroversy here is lower key: It concerns not the educa\ntional programs IDEA directs school districts to provide,\nbut “the remedies available against a noncomplying [dis\ntrict].” Ibid; see post, at 9–11 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n   The Court’s repeated references to a Spending Clause\nderived “clear notice” requirement, see ante, at 3–4, 6, 8,\n11, and n. 3, 12, are questionable on other grounds as well.\nFor one thing, IDEA was enacted not only pursuant to\n2      ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                        MURPHY                                        \n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nCongress’ Spending Clause authority, but also pursuant to\n§5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Smith v. Robinson,\n468 U. S. 992, 1009 (1984) (IDEA’s predecessor, the Educa\ntion of the Handicapped Act, was “set up by Congress to\naid the States in complying with their constitutional\nobligations to provide public education for handicapped\nchildren.”). Furthermore, no “clear notice” prop is needed\nin this case given the twin pillars on which the Court’s\njudgment securely rests. First, as the Court explains,\nante, at 4–6, the specific, attorneys’-fees-oriented, provi\nsions of IDEA, i.e., 20 U. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B)–(G);\n§1415(d)(2)(L), “overwhelmingly support the conclusion\nthat prevailing parents may not recover the costs of ex\nperts or consultants,” ante, at 8. Those provisions place\ncontrols on fees recoverable for attorneys’ services, without\nmentioning costs parents might incur for other profes\nsional services and controls geared to those costs. Second,\nas the Court develops, prior decisions closely in point\n“strongly suppor[t],” even “confir[m] . . . dramatically,”\ntoday’s holding that IDEA trains on attorneys’ fees and\ndoes not authorize an award covering amounts paid or\npayable for the services of an educational consultant.\nAnte, at 9 (citing Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc.,\n482 U. S. 437 (1987), and West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc.\nv. Casey, 499 U. S. 83 (1991)).\n   For the contrary conclusion, JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent\nrelies dominantly on a Conference Report stating the\nconferees’ view that the term “attorneys’ fees as part of the\ncosts” includes “expenses and fees of expert witnesses” and\npayments for tests necessary for the preparation of a case.\nH.

See post, at 5–8 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\nBut Congress did not compose §1415(i)(3)(B)’s text,2 as it\ndid the texts of other statutes too numerous and varied to\nignore, to alter the common import of the terms “attorneys’\nfees” and “costs” in the context of expense-allocation legis\nlation. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §1988(c) (2000 ed. and Supp.\nIII) (added in 1991 specifically to “include expert fees as\npart of the attorney’s fee”); Casey, 499 U. S., at 88–92, and\nn. 4 (citing variously composed statutes that “explicitly\nshift expert . . . fees as well as attorney’s fees”). Given the\n——————\ncosts’ include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the\nreasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be neces\nsary for the preparation of the parent or guardian’s case in the action or\nproceeding, as well as traditional costs incurred in the course of litigat\ning a case.” H. R. Conf. Rep. 99–687, at 5.\n  Although the Conference Report goes on to consider other matters,\nincluding controls on attorneys’ fees, nothing further is said on expert\nwitness fees or test costs.\n  2At the time the Conference Report was submitted to the Senate and\n\nHouse, sponsors of the legislation did not mention anything on the floor\nabout expert or consultant fees. They were altogether clear, however,\nthat the purpose of the legislation was to “reverse” this Court’s decision\nin Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984). In Smith, the Court held\nthat, under the statute as then designed, prevailing parents were not\nentitled to attorneys’ fees. See 132 Cong. Rec. 16823 (1986) (remarks of\nSen. Weicker) (“In adopting this legislation, we are rejecting the rea\nsoning of the Supreme Court in Smith versus Robinson.”); id., at 16824\n(remarks of Sen.

Unlike the Court, I believe that the word\n“costs” includes, and authorizes payment of, the costs of\nexperts.

First, that\nis what Congress said it intended by the phrase. Second,\nthat interpretation furthers the IDEA’s statutorily defined\npurposes.\n                              A\n   Congress added the IDEA’s cost-shifting provision when\nit enacted the Handicapped Children’s Protection Act of\n1986 (HCPA), 100 Stat. 796. Senator Lowell Weicker\nintroduced the relevant bill in 1985. 131 Cong. Rec. 1979–\n1980 (1985). As introduced, it sought to overturn this\nCourt’s determination that the then-current version of the\nIDEA (and other civil rights statutes) did not authorize\ncourts to award attorneys’ fees to prevailing parents in\nIDEA cases. See Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984).\nThe bill provided that “[i]n any action or proceeding\nbrought under this subsection, the court, in its discretion,\nmay award a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs\nto a parent or legal representative of a handicapped child\nor youth who is the prevailing party.” 131 Cong. Rec.\n1980; see S. Rep. No. 99–112, p. 2 (1985).\n   After hearings and debate, several Senators introduced\na new bill in the Senate that would have put a cap on\nattorneys’ fees for legal services lawyers, but at the same\ntime would have explicitly authorized the award of “a\nreasonable attorney’s fee, reasonable witness fees, and\nother reasonable expenses of the civil action, in addition to\nthe costs to a parent . . . who is the prevailing party.” Id.,\nat 7 (emphasis added). While no Senator objected to the\nlatter provision, some objected to the cap. See, e.g., id., at\n17–18 (Additional Views of Senators Kerry, Kennedy, Pell,\nDodd, Simon, Metzenbaum and Matsunaga) (accepting\ncost-shifting provision, but objecting to cap and other\naspects of the bill).

Id.,\nat 15–16 (Additional Views of Senators Hatch, Weicker,\nStafford, Dole, Pell, Matsunaga, Simon, Kerry, Kennedy,\nMetzenbaum, Dodd, and Grassley); 131 Cong. Rec. 21389.\n  Senator Weicker explained that the bill:\n    “will enable courts to compensate parents for what\n    ever reasonable costs they had to incur to fully secure\n    what was guaranteed to them by the EHA. As in other\n    fee shifting statutes, it is our intent that such awards\n    will include, at the discretion of the court, reasonable\n    attorney’s fees, necessary expert witness fees, and other\n    reasonable expenses which were necessary for parents\n    to vindicate their claim to a free appropriate public\n    education for their handicapped child.” Id., at 21390\n    (emphasis added).\nNot a word of opposition to this statement (or the provi\nsion) was voiced on the Senate floor, and S. 415 passed\nwithout a recorded vote. Id., at 21393.\n  The House version of the bill also reflected an intention\nto authorize recovery of expert costs. Following the House\nhearings, the Committee on Education and Labor pro\nduced a substitute bill that authorized courts to “award\nreasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses and costs” to prevail\ning parents. H. R. Rep. No. 99–296, pp. 1, 5 (1985) (em\nphasis added). The House Report stated that\n    “The phrase ‘expenses and costs’ includes expenses of\n    expert witnesses; the reasonable costs of any study, re\n    port, test, or project which is found to be necessary for\n    the preparation of the parents’ or guardian’s due proc\n    ess hearing, state administrative review or civil action;\n    as well as traditional costs and expenses incurred in\n    the course of litigating a case (e.g., depositions and in\n    terrogatories).” Id., at 6 (emphasis added).\n4     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

R. 1523\nreached the floor, another substitute bill was introduced.\n131 Cong. Rec. 31369 (1985). This new bill did not change\nin any respect the text of the authorization of expenses\nand costs. It did add a provision, however, that directed\nthe General Accounting Office (GAO)—now known as the\nGovernment Accountability Office, see 31 U. S. C. A. §731\nnote (Supp. 2006)—to study and report to Congress on the\nfiscal impact of the cost-shifting provision. See id., at\n31369–31370. The newly substituted bill passed the\nHouse without a recorded vote. Id., at 31377.\n   Members of the House and Senate (including all of the\nprimary sponsors of the HCPA) then met in conference to\nwork out certain differences. At the conclusion of those\nnegotiations, they produced a Conference Report, which\ncontained the text of the agreed-upon bill and a “Joint\nExplanatory Statement of the Committee of the Confer\nence.” See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99–687 (1986), Appendix\nA, infra. The Conference accepted the House bill’s GAO\nprovision with “an amendment expanding the data collec\ntion requirements of the GAO study to include information\nregarding the amount of funds expended by local educa\ntional agencies and state educational agencies on civil\nactions and administrative proceedings.” Id., at 7. And it\naccepted (with minor changes) the cost-shifting provisions\nprovided in both the Senate and House versions. The\nconferees explained:\n    “With slightly different wording, both the Senate bill\n    and the House amendment provide for the awarding\n    of attorneys’ fees in addition to costs. The Senate re\n    cedes to the House and the House recedes to the Sen\n    ate with an amendment clarifying that ‘the court, in\n    its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys’ fees\n    as part of the costs . . .’ This change in wording incor\n    porates the Supreme Court[’s] Marek v.

A motion was put to each to adopt the Confer\nence Report, and both the Senate and the House agreed to\nthe Conference Report by voice votes. See Appendix B,\ninfra, at 22 (Senate); Appendix C, infra, at 23 (House). No\nobjection was raised to the Conference Report’s statement\nthat the cost-shifting provision was intended to authorize\nexpert costs. I concede that “sponsors of the legislation did\nnot mention anything on the floor about expert or consult\nant fees” at the time the Conference Report was submit\nted. Ante, at 3, n. 2 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). But I do not believe that silence\nis significant in light of the fact that every Senator and\nthree of the five Representatives who spoke on the floor\nhad previously signed his name to the Conference Re\nport—a Report that made Congress’ intent clear on the\nfirst page of its explanation. See Appendix A, infra, at 19.\nAnd every Senator and Representative that took the floor\npreceding the votes voiced his strong support for the Con\nference Report. 132 Cong. Rec. 16823–16825 (1986) (Sen\nate); id., at 17607–17612 (House). The upshot is that\nMembers of both Houses of Congress voted to adopt both\nthe statutory text before us and the Conference Report\nthat made clear that the statute’s words include the expert\ncosts here in question.\n                          B\n  The Act’s basic purpose further supports interpreting\n6     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

It assures parents that they may question a\nschool district’s decisions about what is “appropriate” for\ntheir child. And in doing so, they may secure the help of\nexperts. §1415(h)(1) (parents have “the right to be accom\npanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with\nspecial knowledge or training with respect to the problems\nof children with disabilities”); see generally Schaffer v.\nWeast, 546 U.

See Brief for Respondents\n28, n. 17 (collecting District Court decisions awarding\nexpert costs ranging from $200 to $7,600, and noting three\nreported cases in which expert awards exceeded $10,000).\nThe costs of experts may not make much of a dent in a\nschool district’s budget, as many of the experts they use in\nIDEA proceedings are already on the staff. Cf. Oberti v.\nBoard of Ed. Clementon School Dist., 995 F. 2d 1204, 1219\n(CA3 1993). But to parents, the award of costs may mat\nter enormously. Without potential reimbursement, par\nents may well lack the services of experts entirely. See\nDepartment of Education, M.

That is why this\nCourt has previously avoided interpretations that would\nbring about this kind of result. See School Comm. of\nBurlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass., 471 U. S. 359\n(1985) (construing IDEA provision granting equitable\nauthority to courts to include the power to order reim\nbursement for parents who switch their child to private\nschools if that decision later proves correct); id., at 370\n(without cost reimbursement for prevailing parents, “the\nchild’s right to a free appropriate public education, the\nparents’ right to participate fully in developing a proper\nindividualized education plan (IEP), and all of the proce\ndural safeguards would be less than complete”); Florence\nCounty School Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U. S. 7, 13 (1993)\n(holding that prevailing parents are not barred from reim\nbursement for switching their child to a private school\nthat does not meet the IDEA’s definition of a free and\nappropriate education). In Carter, we explained: “IDEA\nwas intended to ensure that children with disabilities\nreceive an education that is both appropriate and free. To\nread the provisions of §1401(a)(18) to bar reimbursement\nin the circumstances of this case would defeat this statu\ntory purpose.” Id., at 13–14 (citation omitted).\n  To read the word “costs” as requiring successful parents\nto bear their own expenses for experts suffers from the\nsame problem. Today’s result will leave many parents and\nguardians “without an expert with the firepower to match\nthe opposition,” Schaffer, supra, at __ (slip op., at 11), a far\ncry from the level playing field that Congress envisioned.\n                            II\n    The majority makes essentially three arguments against\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthis interpretation. It says that the statute’s purpose and\n“legislative history is simply not enough” to overcome: (1)\nthe fact that this is a Spending Clause case; (2) the text of\nthe statute; and (3) our prior cases which hold that the\nterm “costs” does not include expert costs. Ante, at 12. I\ndo not find these arguments convincing.\n                              A\n   At the outset the majority says that it “is guided by the\nfact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the\nSpending Clause.” Ante, at 3. “In a Spending Clause\ncase,” the majority adds, “the key is not what a majority of\nthe Members of both Houses intend but what the States\nare clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with\nthe acceptance of those funds.” Ante, at 12. Thus, the\nstatute’s “conditions must be set out ‘unambiguously.’ ”\nAnte, at 3–4 (citing Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981) and Rowley, 458 U. S., at\n204, n. 26). And “[w]e must ask” whether the statute\n“furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in\nthis case.” Ante, at 4.\n   I agree that the statute on its face does not clearly tell\nthe States that they must pay expert fees to prevailing\nparents. But I do not agree that the majority has posed\nthe right question. For one thing, we have repeatedly\nexamined the nature and extent of the financial burdens\nthat the IDEA imposes without reference to the Spending\nClause or any “clear-statement rule.” See, e.g., Burling\nton, supra, at 369 (private school fees); Carter, supra, at 13\n(same); Smith, 468 U. S., at 1010–1011 (attorneys’ fees);\nCedar Rapids Community School Dist. v. Garret F., 526\nU. S. 66, 76–79 (1999) (continuous nursing service); but\nsee id., at 83 (THOMAS, J., joined by KENNEDY, J., dissent\ning). Those cases did not ask whether the statute “fur\nnishes clear notice” to the affirmative obligation or liabil\nity at issue.\n10    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n   For another thing, neither Pennhurst nor any other case\nsuggests that every spending detail of a Spending Clause\nstatute must be spelled out with unusual clarity. To the\ncontrary, we have held that Pennhurst’s requirement that\nCongress “unambiguously” set out “a condition on the\ngrant of federal money” does not necessarily apply to\nlegislation setting forth “the remedies available against a\nnoncomplying State.” Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U. S. 773,\n790, n. 17 (1983) (emphasis added) (rejecting Pennhurst\nbased argument that Elementary and Secondary Educa\ntion Act of 1965 did not unambiguously provide that the\nSecretary could recover federal funds that are misused by\na State). We have added that Pennhurst does not require\nCongress “specifically” to “identify” and “proscribe each\ncondition in [Spending Clause] legislation.” Jackson v.\nBirmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167, 183 (2005) (reject\ning argument that Pennhurst precluded interpreting Title\nIX’s private cause of action to encompass retaliation (in\nternal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); see also\nBennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 665–666\n(1985). And we have denied any implication that “suits\nunder Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or\nthat contract-law principles apply to all issues that they\nraise.” Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 188–189, n. 2\n(2002) (emphasis added).\n   These statements and holdings are not surprising. After\nall, the basic objective of Pennhurst’s clear-statement\nrequirement does not demand textual clarity in respect to\nevery detail. That is because ambiguity about the precise\nnature of a statutory program’s details—particularly\nwhere they are of a kind that States might have antici\npated—is rarely relevant to the basic question: Would the\nStates have accepted the Federal Government’s funds had\nthey only known the nature of the accompanying condi\ntions? Often, the later filling-in of details through judicial\ninterpretation will not lead one to wonder whether fund\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          11\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ning recipients would have agreed to enter the basic pro\ngram at all. Given the nature of such details, it is clear\nthat the States would have entered the program regard\nless. At the same time, to view each statutory detail of a\nhighly complex federal/state program (involving say,\ntransportation, schools, the environment) simply through\nthe lens of linguistic clarity, rather than to assess its\nmeanings in terms of basic legislative purpose, is to risk a\nset of judicial interpretations that can prevent the pro\ngram, overall, from achieving its basic objectives or that\nmight well reduce a program in its details to incoherence.\n   This case is about just such a detail. Permitting parents\nto recover expert fees will not lead to awards of “indeter\nminate magnitude, untethered to compensable harm” and\nconsequently will not “pose a concern that recipients of\nfederal funding could not reasonably have anticipated.”\nBarnes, 536 U. S., at 191 (SOUTER, J., joined by O’Connor,\nJ., concurring) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Unlike, say, punitive damages, an award of\ncosts to expert parties is neither “unorthodox” nor “inde\nterminate,” and thus does not throw into doubt whether\nthe States would have entered into the program. Id., at\n188. If determinations as to whether the IDEA requires\nStates to provide continuing nursing services, Cedar Rap\nids, supra, or reimbursement for private school tuition,\nBurlington, supra, do not call for linguistic clarity, then\nthe precise content of recoverable “costs” does not call for\nsuch clarity here a fortiori.\n                           B\n  If the Court believes that the statute’s language is\nunambiguous, I must disagree. The provision at issue\nsays that a court “may award reasonable attorneys’ fees as\npart of the costs” to parents who prevail in an action\nbrought under the Act. 20 U. S. C. A. §1415(i)(3)(B) (Supp.\n2006). The statute neither defines the word “costs” nor\n12    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\npoints to any other source of law for a definition. And the\nword “costs,” alone, says nothing at all about which costs\nfalls within its scope.\n   Neither does the statutory phrase—“as part of the costs\nto the parents of a child with a disability who is the pre\nvailing party”—taken in its entirety unambiguously fore\nclose an award of expert fees. I agree that, read literally,\nthat provision does not clearly grant authority to award\nany costs at all. And one might read it, as the Court does,\nas referencing another federal statute, 28 U. S. C. §1920,\nwhich provides that authority. See ante, at 5; see also\n§1920 (federal taxation of cost statute). But such a read\ning is not inevitable. The provision (indeed, the entire\nAct) says nothing about that other statute. And one can,\nconsistent with the language, read the provision as both\nembodying a general authority to award costs while also\nspecifying the inclusion of “reasonable attorneys’ fees” as\npart of those costs (as saying, for example, that a court\n“may award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of [a] costs\n[award]”).\n   This latter reading, while linguistically the less natural,\nis legislatively the more likely. The majority’s alternative\nreading, by cross-referencing only the federal general cost-\nawarding statute (which applies solely in federal courts),\nwould produce a jumble of different cost definitions appli\ncable to similar IDEA administrative and state-court\nproceedings in different States. See §1920 (“A judge or\nclerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the\nfollowing. . . .” (emphasis added)). This result is particu\nlarly odd, as all IDEA actions must begin in state due\nprocess hearings, where the federal cost statute clearly\ndoes not apply, and the overwhelming majority of these\nactions are never appealed to any court.

And when parents\ndo appeal, they can file their actions in either state or\nfederal courts. 20 U. S. C. A. §1415(i)(2)(A) (Supp. 2006).\n  Would Congress “obviously” have wanted the content of\nthe word “costs” to vary from State to State, proceeding to\nproceeding? Ante, at 5. Why? At most, the majority’s\nreading of the text is plausible; it is not the only possible\nreading.\n                                C\n   The majority’s most persuasive argument does not focus\non either the Spending Clause or lack of statutory ambigu\nity. Rather, the majority says that “costs” is a term of art.\nIn light of the law’s long practice of excluding expert fees\nfrom the scope of the word “costs,” along with this Court’s\ncases interpreting the word similarly in other statutes, the\n“legislative history is simply not enough.” Ante, at 12.\n   I am perfectly willing to assume that the majority is\ncorrect about the traditional scope of the word “costs.” In\ntwo cases this Court has held that the word “costs” is\nlimited to the list set forth in 28 U. S. C. §1920 and does\nnot include fees paid to experts. See Crawford Fitting Co.\nv. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 (1987) (interpreting Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 54(d)); West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v.\nCasey, 499 U. S. 83 (1991) (interpreting 42 U. S. C. §1988\n(1988 ed.)). But Congress is free to redefine terms of art.\nSee, e.g., Casey, 499 U. S., at 88–90 (citing examples of\nstatutes that shift “‘costs of litigation (including . . . expert\nwitness fees)’ ”). And we have suggested that it might well\n14    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

Id., at 91–92, n. 5 (charac\nterizing language as an “apparent effort to depart from\nordinary meaning and to define a term of art” and noting\nthat Congress made no such “effort” in respect to 42 U. S. C.\n§1988).\n   Regardless, here the statute itself indicates that Con\ngress did not intend to use the word “costs” as a term of\nart. The HCPA, which added the cost-shifting provision\n(in §2) to the IDEA, also added another provision (in §4)\ndirecting the GAO to “conduct a study of the impact of the\namendments to the [IDEA] made by section 2” over a 31⁄2\nyear period following the Act’s effective date. §4(a), 100\nStat. 797. To determine the fiscal impact of §2 (the cost-\nshifting provision), §4 ordered the GAO to submit a report\nto Congress containing, among other things, the following\ninformation:\n     “Data, for a geographically representative select sam\n     ple of States, indicating (A) the specific amount of at\n     torneys’ fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the pre\n     vailing party, in each action and proceeding under\n     [§2] from the date of the enactment of this Act\n     through fiscal year 1988, and the range of such fees,\n     costs and expenses awarded in the actions and pro\n     ceedings under such section, categorized by type of\n     complaint and (B) for the same sample as in (A) the\n     number of hours spent by personnel, including attor\n     neys and consultants, involved in the action or pro\n     ceeding, and expenses incurred by the parents and the\n     State educational agency and local educational\n     agency.” §4(b)(3), id., at 797–798 (emphasis added).\n  If Congress intended the word “costs” in §2 to authorize\nan award of only those costs listed in the federal cost\nstatute, why did it use the word “expenses” in §4(b)(3)(A)\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Nor does the federal costs statute cover any\nexpenses—at least not any that Congress could have\nwanted the GAO to study. Cf. 28 U. S. C. §1920 (referring\nonly once to “expenses,” and doing so solely to refer to\nspecial interpretation services provided in actions initiated\nby the United States).\n  Further, why did Congress, when asking the GAO (in\nthe statute itself) to study the “numbers of hours spent by\npersonnel” include among those personnel both attorneys\n“and consultants”? Who but experts could those consult\nants be? Why would Congress want the GAO to study the\nhours that those experts “spent,” unless it thought that it\nwould help keep track of the “costs” that the statute\nimposed?\n  Of course, one might, through speculation, find other\nanswers to these questions. One might, for example,\nimagine that Congress wanted the GAO to study the\nexpenses that payment of expert fees engendered in state-\ncourt proceedings where state, but not federal, law re\nquires that “ ‘expenses’ other than ‘costs’ might be receiv\nable.” Ante, at 7, n. 1; but see supra, at 12-13. Or one\nmight think that the word “expenses” is surplusage. Ante,\nat 7, n. 1; but see Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174\n(2001) (expressing Court’s “ ‘reluctan[ce] to treat statutory\nterms as surplusage in any setting,’” but especially when\nthey play “a pivotal role in the statutory scheme”). Or one\nmight believe that Congress was interested in the hours\nthese experts spent, but not in the fees they obtained.\nAnte, at 7. But these answers are not necessarily consis\ntent with the purpose of the GAO study provision, a pur\npose revealed by the language of the provision and its\nposition in the statute. Its placement and its reference to\n§2 indicate that Congress ordered the study to help it keep\ntrack of the magnitude of the reimbursements that an\n16    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD.

And the only\nreimbursement requirement that §2 mandates is the\npayment of “costs.”\n   But why speculate about this? We know what Congress\nintended the GAO study to cover. It told the GAO in its\nConference Report that the word “costs” included the costs\nof experts. And, not surprisingly, the GAO made clear\nthat it understood precisely what Congress asked it to do.\nIn its final report, the GAO wrote: “Parents can receive\nreimbursement from state or local education agencies for\nsome or all of their attorney fees and related expenses if\nthey are the prevailing party in part or all of administra\ntive hearings or court proceedings. Expert witness fees,\ncosts of tests or evaluations found to be necessary during\nthe case, and court costs for services rendered during ad\nministrative and court proceedings are examples of reim\nbursable expenses.” GAO, Briefing Report to Congres\nsional Requesters, Special Education: The Attorney Fees\nProvision of Public Law 99–372 GAO/HRD–22BR, p. 13\n(Nov. 1989). At the very least, this amounts to some indi\ncation that Congress intended the word “costs,” not as a\nterm of art, not as it was used in the statutes at issue in\nCasey and Crawford Fitting, but rather as including cer\ntain additional “expenses.” If that is so, the claims of\ntradition, of the interpretation this Court has given other\nstatutes, cannot be so strong as to prevent us from exam\nining the legislative history. And that history could not be\nmore clear about the matter: Congress intended the\nstatutory phrase “attorneys’ fees as part of the costs” to\ninclude the costs of experts. See Part I, supra.\n                           III\n For the reasons I have set forth, I cannot agree with the\nmajority’s conclusion.

And our ultimate\njudicial goal is to interpret language in light of the statute’s\npurpose. Only by seeking that purpose can we avoid the\nsubstitution of judicial for legislative will. Only by reading\nlanguage in its light can we maintain the democratic link\nbetween voters, legislators, statutes, and ultimate imple\nmentation, upon which the legitimacy of our constitutional\nsystem rests.\n   In my view, to keep faith with that interpretive goal, we\nmust retain all traditional interpretive tools—text, struc\nture, history, and purpose. And, because faithful interpre\ntation is art as well as science, we cannot, through rule or\ncanon, rule out the use of any of these tools, automatically\nand in advance. Cf. Helvering v. Gregory, 69 F. 2d 809,\n810–811 (CA2 1934) (L. Hand, J.).\n   Nothing in the Constitution forbids us from giving\nsignificant weight to legislative history. By disregarding a\nclear statement in a legislative report adopted without\nopposition in both Houses of Congress, the majority has\nreached a result no Member of Congress expected or\novertly desired. It has adopted an interpretation that\nundercuts, rather than furthers, the statute’s purpose, a\n“free” and “appropriate” public education for “all” children\nwith disabilities. See Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,\n532 U. S. 105, 133 (2001) (STEVENS, J., joined by SOUTER,\nGINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., dissenting) (“A method of\nstatutory interpretation that is deliberately uninformed,\nand hence unconstrained, may produce a result that is\nconsistent with a court’s own views of how things should\nbe, but it may also defeat the very purpose for which a\nprovision was enacted”). And it has adopted an approach\nthat, I fear, divorces law from life. See Duncan, supra, at\n193 (BREYER, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n18   ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD.

MURPHY ET VIR. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 05–18. Argued April 19, 2006—Decided June 26, 2006\nAfter respondents prevailed in their Individuals with Disabilities Edu\n  cation Act (IDEA) action to require petitioner school board to pay for\n  their son’s private school tuition, they sought fees for services ren\n  dered by an educational consultant during the proceedings, relying\n  on an IDEA provision that permits a court to “award reasonable at\n  torneys’ fees as part of the costs” to prevailing parents, 20 U. S. C.\n  §1415(i)(3)(B). The District Court granted their motion in part. Af\n  firming, the Second Circuit noted that, under Crawford Fitting Co. v.\n  J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, and West Virginia Univ. Hospitals,\n  Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be\n  read to permit recovery of expert fees without explicit statutory au\n  thority, but concluded that a congressional Conference Committee\n  Report relating to §1415(i)(3)(B) and a footnote in Casey referencing\n  that Report showed that the IDEA authorized such reimbursement.\nHeld: Section §1415(i)(3)(B) does not authorize prevailing parents to\n recover expert fees. Pp. 3–12.\n    (a) The resolution of this question is guided by the fact that Con\n gress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause. While\n Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses fed\n eral money to the States, any conditions it attaches to a State’s ac\n ceptance of such funds must be set out “unambiguously.” Pennhurst\n State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17. Fund re\n cipients are bound only by those conditions that they accept “volun\n tarily and knowingly,” ibid., and States cannot knowingly accept con\n ditions of which they are “unaware” or which they are “unable to\n ascertain,” ibid. Thus, the question here is whether the IDEA fur\n nishes clear notice regarding expert fees. Pp. 3–4.\n2         ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                          MURPHY                                                  \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n       (b) The Court begins with the IDEA’s text, for if its “language is\n    plain,” the courts’ function “ ‘ “is to enforce it according to its terms.” ’ ”\n    Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530\n    U. S. 1, 6. While §1415(i)(3)(B) provides for an award of “reasonable\n    attorneys’ fees,” it does not even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds\n    makes a State responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for the\n    services of experts. “Costs” is a term of art that does not generally\n    include expert fees. The use of “costs” rather than “expenses”\n    strongly suggests that §1415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-\n    ended provision making States liable for all expenses. Moreover,\n    §1415(i)(3)(B) says not that a court may award “costs” but that it may\n    award attorney’s fees “as part of the costs.” This language simply\n    adds reasonable attorney’s fees to the list of recoverable costs set out\n    in 28 U. S. C. §1920, the general statute covering taxation of costs,\n    which is strictly limited by §1821. Thus, §1415(i)(3)(B)’s text does not\n    authorize an award of additional expert fees, and it certainly fails to\n    present the clear notice required by the Spending Clause. Other\n    IDEA provisions point strongly in the same direction. Of little sig\n    nificance here is a provision in the Handicapped Children’s Protec\n    tion Act of 1986 requiring the General Accounting Office to collect\n    data on awards to prevailing parties in IDEA cases, but making no\n    mention of consultants or experts or their fees. And the fact that the\n    provision directed the GAO to compile data on the hours spent by\n    consultants in IDEA cases does not mean that Congress intended for\n    States to compensate prevailing parties for fees billed by these con\n    sultants. Pp. 4–8.\n       (c) Crawford Fitting Co. and Casey strongly reinforce the conclu\n    sion that the IDEA does not unambiguously authorize prevailing\n    parents to recover expert fees. Crawford Fitting Co.’s reasoning sup\n    ports the conclusion that the term “costs” in §1415(i)(3)(B), like\n    “costs” in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), the provision at issue\n    there, is defined by the categories of expenses enumerated in 28\n    U. S. C. §1920. This conclusion is buttressed by the principle, recog\n    nized in Crawford Fitting Co., that no statute will be construed to au\n    thorize taxing witness fees as costs unless the statute “refer[s] explic\n    itly to witness fees.” 482 U. S., at 445. The conclusion that the IDEA\n    does not authorize expert fee awards is confirmed even more dra\n    matically by Casey, where the Court held that 42 U. S. C. §1988, a\n    fee-shifting provision with wording virtually identical to that of 20\n    U. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B), did not empower a district court to award ex\n    pert fees to a prevailing party. 482 U. S., at 102. The Second Circuit\n    misunderstood the meaning of the Casey footnote on which it relied.\n    That footnote did not state that the Conference Committee Report set\n    out the correct interpretation of §1415(i)(3)(B) or provided the clear\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

Its thrust was simply\n  that “attorneys’ fees,” standing alone, is generally not understood as\n  encompassing expert fees. Pp. 8–11.\n    (d) Respondents’ additional arguments are unpersuasive. The\n  IDEA’s goals of “ensur[ing] that all children with disabilities have\n  available to them a free appropriate public education,”\n  §1400(d)(1)(A), and of safeguarding parents’ right to challenge ad\n  verse school decisions are too general to provide much support for\n  their reading of the IDEA. And the IDEA’s legislative history is in\n  sufficient help, where everything other than that history overwhelm\n  ingly suggests that expert fees may not be recovered.

Supp. 2d 354 (SDNY\n2000), and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\naffirmed, 297 F. 3d 195 (2002).\n  As prevailing parents, respondents then sought $29,350\nin fees for the services of an educational consultant,\n2     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B). 2003 WL 21694398, *9\n(SDNY, July 22, 2003). This reduced the maximum recov\nery to $8,650. The District Court also held that Arons, a\nnonlawyer, could be compensated only for time spent on\nexpert consulting services, not for time spent on legal\nrepresentation, id., at *4, but it concluded that all the\nrelevant time could be characterized as falling within the\ncompensable category, and thus allowed compensation for\nthe full $8,650, id., at *10.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\n402 F. 3d 332 (2005). Acknowledging that other Circuits\nhad taken the opposite view, the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that “Congress intended to and did\nauthorize the reimbursement of expert fees in IDEA ac\ntions.” Id., at 336. The court began by discussing two\ndecisions of this Court holding that expert fees could not\nbe recovered as taxed costs under particular cost- or fee-\nshifting provisions. See Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gib\nbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 (1987) (interpreting Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 54(d) and 28 U. S. C. §1920); West Virginia Univ.\nHospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83 (1991) (interpreting 42\nU. S. C. §1988 (1988 ed.)). According to these decisions, the\ncourt noted, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be read\nto permit a prevailing party to recover expert fees without\n“‘explicit statutory authority’ indicating that Congress\nintended for that sort of fee-shifting.” 402 F. 3d, at 336.\n   Ultimately, though, the court was persuaded by a state\nment in the Conference Committee Report relating to 20\nU. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B) and by a footnote in Casey that\nmade reference to that Report. 402 F. 3d, at 336–337\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

No. 102, 349 F. 3d 469, 480–482 (CA7 2003), with\n402 F. 3d 332 (CA2 2005). We now reverse.\n                              II\n  Our resolution of the question presented in this case is\nguided by the fact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursu\nant to the Spending Clause. U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1;\nsee Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. ____ (2005). Like its\nstatutory predecessor, the IDEA provides federal funds to\nassist state and local agencies in educating children with\ndisabilities “and conditions such funding upon a State’s\ncompliance with extensive goals and procedures.” Board of\nEd. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester\nCty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 179 (1982).\n  Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it\ndisburses federal money to the States, see, e.g., South\nDakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206–207 (1987), but when\nCongress attaches conditions to a State’s acceptance of\nfederal funds, the conditions must be set out “unambigu\nously,” see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halder\nman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981); Rowley, supra, at 204, n. 26.\n“[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is\nmuch in the nature of a contract,” and therefore, to be bound\nby “federally imposed conditions,” recipients of federal funds\n4     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\nmust accept them “voluntarily and knowingly.” Pennhurst,\n451 U. S., at 17. States cannot knowingly accept conditions\nof which they are “unaware” or which they are “unable to\nascertain.” Ibid. Thus, in the present case, we must view\nthe IDEA from the perspective of a state official who is\nengaged in the process of deciding whether the State should\naccept IDEA funds and the obligations that go with those\nfunds. We must ask whether such a state official would\nclearly understand that one of the obligations of the Act is\nthe obligation to compensate prevailing parents for expert\nfees. In other words, we must ask whether the IDEA\nfurnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in\nthis case.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n  In considering whether the IDEA provides clear notice,\nwe begin with the text. We have “stated time and again\nthat courts must presume that a legislature says in a\nstatute what it means and means in a statute what it says\nthere.” Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249,\n253–254 (1992). When the statutory “language is plain, the\nsole function of the courts—at least where the disposition\nrequired by the text is not absurd—is to enforce it according\nto its terms.” Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union\nPlanters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000) (quoting United\nStates v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241\n(1989), in turn quoting Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S.\n470, 485 (1917); internal quotation marks omitted).\n  The governing provision of the IDEA, 20 U. S. C.\n§1415(i)(3)(B), provides that “[i]n any action or proceeding\nbrought under this section, the court, in its discretion,\nmay award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs”\nto the parents of “a child with a disability” who is the\n“prevailing party.” While this provision provides for an\naward of “reasonable attorneys’ fees,” this provision does\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds makes a\nState responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for\nservices rendered by experts.\n   Respondents contend that we should interpret the term\n“costs” in accordance with its meaning in ordinary usage\nand that §1415(i)(3)(B) should therefore be read to “au\nthorize reimbursement of all costs parents incur in IDEA\nproceedings, including expert costs.” Brief for Respon\ndents 17.\n   This argument has multiple flaws. For one thing, as the\nCourt of Appeals in this case acknowledged, “ ‘costs’ is a\nterm of art that generally does not include expert fees.”\n402 F. 3d, at 336. The use of this term of art, rather than\na term such as “expenses,” strongly suggests that\n§1415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-ended provi\nsion that makes participating States liable for all expenses\nincurred by prevailing parents in connection with an\nIDEA case—for example, travel and lodging expenses or\nlost wages due to time taken off from work. Moreover,\ncontrary to respondents’ suggestion, §1415(i)(3)(B) does\nnot say that a court may award “costs” to prevailing par\nents; rather, it says that a court may award reasonable\nattorney’s fees “as part of the costs” to prevailing parents.\nThis language simply adds reasonable attorney’s fees\nincurred by prevailing parents to the list of costs that\nprevailing parents are otherwise entitled to recover. This\nlist of otherwise recoverable costs is obviously the list set\nout in 28 U. S. C. §1920, the general statute governing the\ntaxation of costs in federal court, and the recovery of\nwitness fees under §1920 is strictly limited by §1821,\nwhich authorizes travel reimbursement and a $40 per\ndiem. Thus, the text of 20 U. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B) does not\nauthorize an award of any additional expert fees, and it\ncertainly fails to provide the clear notice that is required\nunder the Spending Clause.\n   Other provisions of the IDEA point strongly in the same\n6     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\ndirection. While authorizing the award of reasonable\nattorney’s fees, the Act contains detailed provisions that\nare designed to ensure that such awards are indeed rea\nsonable. See §§1415(i)(3)(C)–(G). The absence of any\ncomparable provisions relating to expert fees strongly\nsuggests that recovery of expert fees is not authorized.\nMoreover, the lack of any reference to expert fees in\n§1415(d)(2) gives rise to a similar inference. This provi\nsion, which generally requires that parents receive “a full\nexplanation of the procedural safeguards” available under\n§1415 and refers expressly to “attorneys’ fees,” makes no\nmention of expert fees.\n                               B\n   Respondents contend that their interpretation of\n§1415(i)(3)(B) is supported by a provision of the Handi\ncapped Children’s Protection Act of 1986 that required the\nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) to collect certain data,\n§4(b)(3), 100 Stat. 797 (hereinafter GAO study provision),\nbut this provision is of little significance for present pur\nposes. The GAO study provision directed the Comptroller\nGeneral, acting through the GAO, to compile data on,\namong other things: “(A) the specific amount of attorneys’\nfees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party” in\nIDEA cases for a particular period of time, and (B) “the\nnumber of hours spent by personnel, including attorneys\nand consultants, involved in the action or proceeding, and\nexpenses incurred by the parents and the State educa\ntional agency and local educational agency.” Id., at 797–\n798.\n   Subparagraph (A) would provide some support for re\nspondents’ position if it directed the GAO to compile data\non awards to prevailing parties of the expense of hiring\nconsultants, but that is not what subparagraph (A) says.\nSubparagraph (A) makes no mention of consultants or\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                       7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nexperts or their fees.1\n  Subparagraph (B) similarly does not help respondents.\nSubparagraph (B), which directs the GAO to study “the\nnumber of hours spent [in IDEA cases] by personnel,\nincluding . . . consultants,” says nothing about the award\nof fees to such consultants. Just because Congress di\nrected the GAO to compile statistics on the hours spent by\nconsultants in IDEA cases, it does not follow that Con\ngress meant for States to compensate prevailing parties\nfor the fees billed by these consultants.\n  Respondents maintain that “Congress’ direction to the\nGAO would be inexplicable if Congress did not anticipate\nthat the expenses for ‘consultants’ would be recoverable,”\nBrief for Respondents 19, but this is incorrect. There are\nmany reasons why Congress might have wanted the GAO\nto gather data on expenses that were not to be taxed as\ncosts. Knowing the costs incurred by IDEA litigants might\nbe useful in considering future procedural amendments\n(which might affect these costs) or a future amendment\nregarding fee shifting. And, in fact, it is apparent that the\n——————\n  1 Because   subparagraph (A) refers to both “costs” and “expenses”\nawarded to prevailing parties and because it is generally presumed that\nstatutory language is not superfluous, it could be argued that this provi\nsion manifests the expectation that prevailing parties would be awarded\ncertain “expenses” not included in the list of “costs” set out in 28 U. S. C.\n§1920 and that expert fees were intended to be among these unenumer\nated “expenses.” This argument fails because, whatever expectation this\nlanguage might seem to evidence, the fact remains that neither 20 U. S. C.\n§1415 nor any other provision of the IDEA authorizes the award of any\n“expenses” other than “costs.” Recognizing this, respondents argue not\nthat they are entitled to recover “expenses” that are not “costs,” but that\nexpert fees are recoverable “costs.” As a result, the reference to awards of\nboth “expenses” and “costs” does not support respondents’ position. The\nreference to “expenses” may relate to IDEA actions brought in state court,\n§1415(i)(2)(A), where “expenses” other than “costs” might be receivable.\nOr the reference may be surplusage. While it is generally presumed that\nstatutes do not contain surplusage, instances of surplusage are not\nunknown.\n8          ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                           MURPHY                                            \n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\nGAO study provision covered expenses that could not be\ntaxed as costs. For example, the GAO was instructed to\ncompile statistics on the hours spent by all attorneys\ninvolved in an IDEA action or proceeding, even though the\nAct did not provide for the recovery of attorney’s fees by a\nprevailing state or local educational agency.2 Similarly,\nthe GAO was directed to compile data on “expenses in\ncurred by the parents,” not just those parents who prevail\nand are thus eligible to recover taxed costs.\n  In sum, the terms of the IDEA overwhelmingly support\nthe conclusion that prevailing parents may not recover the\ncosts of experts or consultants. Certainly the terms of the\nIDEA fail to provide the clear notice that would be needed\nto attach such a condition to a State’s receipt of IDEA\nfunds.\n                              IV\n   Thus far, we have considered only the text of the IDEA,\nbut perhaps the strongest support for our interpretation of\nthe IDEA is supplied by our decisions and reasoning in\nCrawford Fitting, 482 U. S. 437, and Casey, 499 U. S. 83.\nIn light of those decisions, we do not see how it can be said\nthat the IDEA gives a State unambiguous notice regarding\nliability for expert fees.\n   In Crawford Fitting, the Court rejected an argument\nvery similar to respondents’ argument that the term\n“costs” in §1415(i)(3)(B) should be construed as an open-\nended reference to prevailing parents’ expenses. It was\nargued in Crawford Fitting that Federal Rule of Civil\n——————\n    2 In\n      2000, the attorneys’ fees provision provided only an award to\nprevailing parents. See 20 U. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B). In 2004, Congress\namended §1415(i)(3)(B) to include two additional awards. See §101,\n118 Stat. 2724. The amendments provided awards “to a prevailing\nparty who is a State educational agency or local educational agency”\nwhere the complaint filed is frivolous or presented for an improper\npurpose, such as to harass, delay, or increase the cost of litigation. See\n20 U. S. C. A. §§1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(II)–(III) (Supp. 2006).\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nProcedure 54(d), which provides for the award of “costs” to\na prevailing party, authorizes the award of costs not listed\nin 28 U. S. C. §1821. 482 U. S., at 439. The Court held,\nhowever, that Rule 54(d) does not give a district judge\n“discretion to tax whatever costs may seem appropriate”;\nrather, the term “costs” in Rule 54(d) is defined by the list\nset out in §1920. Id., at 441. Because the recovery of\nwitness fees, see §1920(3), is strictly limited by §1821, the\nCourt observed, a broader interpretation of Rule 54(d)\nwould mean that the Rule implicitly effected a partial\nrepeal of those provisions. Id., at 442. But, the Court\nwarned, “[w]e will not lightly infer that Congress has\nrepealed §§1920 and 1821, either through Rule 54(d) or\nany other provision not referring explicitly to witness\nfees.” Id., at 445.\n  The reasoning of Crawford Fitting strongly supports the\nconclusion that the term “costs” in 20 U. S. C.\n§1415(i)(3)(B), like the same term in Rule 54(d), is defined\nby the categories of expenses enumerated in 28 U. S. C.\n§1920. This conclusion is buttressed by the principle,\nrecognized in Crawford Fitting, that no statute will be\nconstrued as authorizing the taxation of witness fees as\ncosts unless the statute “refer[s] explicitly to witness fees.”\n482 U. S., at 445; see also ibid. (“absent explicit statutory\nor contractual authorization for the taxation of the ex\npenses of a litigant’s witness as costs, federal courts are\nbound by the limitations set out in 28 U. S. C. §1821 and\n§1920”).\n  Our decision in Casey confirms even more dramatically\nthat the IDEA does not authorize an award of expert fees.\nIn Casey, as noted above, we interpreted a fee-shifting\nprovision, 42 U. S. C. §1988, the relevant wording of which\nwas virtually identical to the wording of 20 U. S. C.\n§1415(i)(3)(B). Compare ibid. (authorizing the award of\n“reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs” to prevail\ning parents) with 42 U. S. C. §1988(b) (1988 ed.) (permit\n10    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                    \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\nting prevailing parties in certain civil rights actions to be\nawarded “a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs”).\nWe held that §1988 did not empower a district court to\naward expert fees to a prevailing party. Casey, supra, at\n102. To decide in favor of respondents here, we would\nhave to interpret the virtually identical language in 20\nU. S. C. §1415 as having exactly the opposite meaning.\nIndeed, we would have to go further and hold that the\nrelevant language in the IDEA unambiguously means\nexactly the opposite of what the nearly identical language\nin 42 U. S. C. §1988 was held to mean in Casey.\n   The Court of Appeals, as noted above, was heavily influ\nenced by a Casey footnote, see 402 F. 3d, at 336–337 (quot\ning 499 U. S., at 91–92, n. 5), but the court misunderstood\nthe footnote’s meaning. The text accompanying the foot\nnote argued, based on an analysis of several fee-shifting\nstatutes, that the term “attorney’s fees” does not include\nexpert fees. Id., at 88–91. In the footnote, we commented\non petitioners’ invocation of the Conference Committee\nReport relating to 20 U. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B), which stated:\n“ ‘The conferees intend[ed] that the term “attorneys’ fees as\npart of the costs” include reasonable expenses and fees of\nexpert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or\nevaluation which is found to be necessary for the prepara\ntion of the . . . case.’ ” 499 U. S., at 91–92, n. 5 (quoting\nH. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99–687, at 5; ellipsis in original).\nThis statement, the footnote commented, was “an appar\nent effort to depart from ordinary meaning and to define a\nterm of art.” 499 U. S., at 92, n. 5. The footnote did not\nstate that the Conference Committee Report set out the\ncorrect interpretation of §1415(i)(3)(B), much less that the\nReport was sufficient, despite the language of the statute,\nto provide the clear notice required under the Spending\nClause. The thrust of the footnote was simply that the\nterm “attorneys’ fees,” standing alone, is generally not\nunderstood as encompassing expert fees. Thus, Crawford\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

S. C.\n§1400(d)(1)(A) as well as the goal of “safeguard[ing] the\nrights of parents to challenge school decisions that ad\nversely affect their child.” Brief for Respondents 20.\nThese goals, however, are too general to provide much\nsupport for respondents’ reading of the terms of the IDEA.\nThe IDEA obviously does not seek to promote these goals\nat the expense of all other considerations, including fiscal\nconsiderations. Because the IDEA is not intended in all\ninstances to further the broad goals identified by the\nrespondents at the expense of fiscal considerations, the\ngoals cited by respondents do little to bolster their argu\nment on the narrow question presented here.3\n  Finally, respondents vigorously argue that Congress\nclearly intended for prevailing parents to be compensated\nfor expert fees. They rely on the legislative history of\n§1415 and in particular on the following statement in the\n\n——————\n  3 Respondents note that a GAO report stated that expert witness fees\n\nare reimbursable expenses. See Brief for Respondents 19 (citing GAO,\nSpecial Education: The Attorney Fees Provision of Public Law 99–372,\np. 13 (Nov. 1989)). But this passing reference in a report issued by an\nagency not responsible for implementing the IDEA is plainly insuffi\ncient to provide clear notice regarding the scope of the conditions\nattached to the receipt of IDEA funds.\n12    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

Putting the\nlegislative history aside, we see virtually no support for\nrespondents’ position. Under these circumstances, where\neverything other than the legislative history overwhelm\ning suggests that expert fees may not be recovered, the\nlegislative history is simply not enough. In a Spending\nClause case, the key is not what a majority of the Mem\nbers of both Houses intend but what the States are clearly\ntold regarding the conditions that go along with the accep\ntance of those funds.

The Court extracts from Pennhurst State School and\nHospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981), a “clear\nnotice” requirement, and deems it applicable in this case\nbecause Congress enacted the Individuals with Disabili\nties Education Act (IDEA), as it did the legislation at issue\nin Pennhurst, pursuant to the Spending Clause. Ante, at\n3–4. That extraction, in my judgment, is unwarranted.\nPennhurst’s “clear notice” requirement should not be\nunmoored from its context. The Court there confronted a\nplea to impose “an unexpected condition for compliance—a\nnew [programmatic] obligation for participating States.”\nBell v. New Jersey, 461 U. S. 773, 790, n. 17 (1983). The\ncontroversy here is lower key: It concerns not the educa\ntional programs IDEA directs school districts to provide,\nbut “the remedies available against a noncomplying [dis\ntrict].” Ibid; see post, at 9–11 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n   The Court’s repeated references to a Spending Clause\nderived “clear notice” requirement, see ante, at 3–4, 6, 8,\n11, and n. 3, 12, are questionable on other grounds as well.\nFor one thing, IDEA was enacted not only pursuant to\n2      ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

See Smith v. Robinson,\n468 U. S. 992, 1009 (1984) (IDEA’s predecessor, the Educa\ntion of the Handicapped Act, was “set up by Congress to\naid the States in complying with their constitutional\nobligations to provide public education for handicapped\nchildren.”). Furthermore, no “clear notice” prop is needed\nin this case given the twin pillars on which the Court’s\njudgment securely rests. First, as the Court explains,\nante, at 4–6, the specific, attorneys’-fees-oriented, provi\nsions of IDEA, i.e., 20 U. S. C. §1415(i)(3)(B)–(G);\n§1415(d)(2)(L), “overwhelmingly support the conclusion\nthat prevailing parents may not recover the costs of ex\nperts or consultants,” ante, at 8. Those provisions place\ncontrols on fees recoverable for attorneys’ services, without\nmentioning costs parents might incur for other profes\nsional services and controls geared to those costs. Second,\nas the Court develops, prior decisions closely in point\n“strongly suppor[t],” even “confir[m] . . . dramatically,”\ntoday’s holding that IDEA trains on attorneys’ fees and\ndoes not authorize an award covering amounts paid or\npayable for the services of an educational consultant.\nAnte, at 9 (citing Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc.,\n482 U. S. 437 (1987), and West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc.\nv. Casey, 499 U. S. 83 (1991)).\n   For the contrary conclusion, JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent\nrelies dominantly on a Conference Report stating the\nconferees’ view that the term “attorneys’ fees as part of the\ncosts” includes “expenses and fees of expert witnesses” and\npayments for tests necessary for the preparation of a case.\nH.

See post, at 5–8 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\nBut Congress did not compose §1415(i)(3)(B)’s text,2 as it\ndid the texts of other statutes too numerous and varied to\nignore, to alter the common import of the terms “attorneys’\nfees” and “costs” in the context of expense-allocation legis\nlation. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §1988(c) (2000 ed. and Supp.\nIII) (added in 1991 specifically to “include expert fees as\npart of the attorney’s fee”); Casey, 499 U.

They were altogether clear, however,\nthat the purpose of the legislation was to “reverse” this Court’s decision\nin Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984). In Smith, the Court held\nthat, under the statute as then designed, prevailing parents were not\nentitled to attorneys’ fees. See 132 Cong. Rec. 16823 (1986) (remarks of\nSen. Weicker) (“In adopting this legislation, we are rejecting the rea\nsoning of the Supreme Court in Smith versus Robinson.”); id., at 16824\n(remarks of Sen.

Unlike the Court, I believe that the word\n“costs” includes, and authorizes payment of, the costs of\nexperts. The word “costs” does not define its own scope.\nNeither does the phrase “attorneys’ fees as part of costs.”\nBut Members of Congress did make clear their intent by,\namong other things, approving a Conference Report that\nspecified that “the term ‘attorneys’ fees as part of the costs’\ninclude[s] reasonable expenses of expert witnesses and\nreasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to\nbe necessary for the preparation of the parent or guard\nian’s case in the action or proceeding.” H.

No\nSenator or Representative voiced any opposition to this\nstatement in the discussion preceding the vote on the\nConference Report—the last vote on the bill before it was\nsent to the President. I can find no good reason for this\nCourt to interpret the language of this statute as meaning\nthe precise opposite of what Congress told us it intended.\n2     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n                              I\n   There are two strong reasons for interpreting the statu\ntory phrase to include the award of expert fees. First, that\nis what Congress said it intended by the phrase. Second,\nthat interpretation furthers the IDEA’s statutorily defined\npurposes.\n                              A\n   Congress added the IDEA’s cost-shifting provision when\nit enacted the Handicapped Children’s Protection Act of\n1986 (HCPA), 100 Stat. 796. Senator Lowell Weicker\nintroduced the relevant bill in 1985. 131 Cong. Rec. 1979–\n1980 (1985). As introduced, it sought to overturn this\nCourt’s determination that the then-current version of the\nIDEA (and other civil rights statutes) did not authorize\ncourts to award attorneys’ fees to prevailing parents in\nIDEA cases. See Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984).\nThe bill provided that “[i]n any action or proceeding\nbrought under this subsection, the court, in its discretion,\nmay award a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs\nto a parent or legal representative of a handicapped child\nor youth who is the prevailing party.” 131 Cong. Rec.\n1980; see S. Rep. No. 99–112, p. 2 (1985).\n   After hearings and debate, several Senators introduced\na new bill in the Senate that would have put a cap on\nattorneys’ fees for legal services lawyers, but at the same\ntime would have explicitly authorized the award of “a\nreasonable attorney’s fee, reasonable witness fees, and\nother reasonable expenses of the civil action, in addition to\nthe costs to a parent . . . who is the prevailing party.” Id.,\nat 7 (emphasis added). While no Senator objected to the\nlatter provision, some objected to the cap. See, e.g., id., at\n17–18 (Additional Views of Senators Kerry, Kennedy, Pell,\nDodd, Simon, Metzenbaum and Matsunaga) (accepting\ncost-shifting provision, but objecting to cap and other\naspects of the bill). A bipartisan group of Senators, led by\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nSenators Hatch and Weicker, proposed an alternative bill\nthat authorized courts to award “a reasonable attorney’s\nfee in addition to the costs to a parent” who prevailed. Id.,\nat 15–16 (Additional Views of Senators Hatch, Weicker,\nStafford, Dole, Pell, Matsunaga, Simon, Kerry, Kennedy,\nMetzenbaum, Dodd, and Grassley); 131 Cong. Rec. 21389.\n  Senator Weicker explained that the bill:\n    “will enable courts to compensate parents for what\n    ever reasonable costs they had to incur to fully secure\n    what was guaranteed to them by the EHA. As in other\n    fee shifting statutes, it is our intent that such awards\n    will include, at the discretion of the court, reasonable\n    attorney’s fees, necessary expert witness fees, and other\n    reasonable expenses which were necessary for parents\n    to vindicate their claim to a free appropriate public\n    education for their handicapped child.” Id., at 21390\n    (emphasis added).\nNot a word of opposition to this statement (or the provi\nsion) was voiced on the Senate floor, and S. 415 passed\nwithout a recorded vote. Id., at 21393.\n  The House version of the bill also reflected an intention\nto authorize recovery of expert costs. Following the House\nhearings, the Committee on Education and Labor pro\nduced a substitute bill that authorized courts to “award\nreasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses and costs” to prevail\ning parents. H. R. Rep. No. 99–296, pp. 1, 5 (1985) (em\nphasis added). The House Report stated that\n    “The phrase ‘expenses and costs’ includes expenses of\n    expert witnesses; the reasonable costs of any study, re\n    port, test, or project which is found to be necessary for\n    the preparation of the parents’ or guardian’s due proc\n    ess hearing, state administrative review or civil action;\n    as well as traditional costs and expenses incurred in\n    the course of litigating a case (e.g., depositions and in\n    terrogatories).” Id., at 6 (emphasis added).\n4     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                  \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nNo one objected to this statement. By the time H. R. 1523\nreached the floor, another substitute bill was introduced.\n131 Cong. Rec. 31369 (1985). This new bill did not change\nin any respect the text of the authorization of expenses\nand costs. It did add a provision, however, that directed\nthe General Accounting Office (GAO)—now known as the\nGovernment Accountability Office, see 31 U. S. C. A. §731\nnote (Supp. 2006)—to study and report to Congress on the\nfiscal impact of the cost-shifting provision. See id., at\n31369–31370. The newly substituted bill passed the\nHouse without a recorded vote. Id., at 31377.\n   Members of the House and Senate (including all of the\nprimary sponsors of the HCPA) then met in conference to\nwork out certain differences. At the conclusion of those\nnegotiations, they produced a Conference Report, which\ncontained the text of the agreed-upon bill and a “Joint\nExplanatory Statement of the Committee of the Confer\nence.” See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99–687 (1986), Appendix\nA, infra. The Conference accepted the House bill’s GAO\nprovision with “an amendment expanding the data collec\ntion requirements of the GAO study to include information\nregarding the amount of funds expended by local educa\ntional agencies and state educational agencies on civil\nactions and administrative proceedings.” Id., at 7. And it\naccepted (with minor changes) the cost-shifting provisions\nprovided in both the Senate and House versions. The\nconferees explained:\n    “With slightly different wording, both the Senate bill\n    and the House amendment provide for the awarding\n    of attorneys’ fees in addition to costs. The Senate re\n    cedes to the House and the House recedes to the Sen\n    ate with an amendment clarifying that ‘the court, in\n    its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys’ fees\n    as part of the costs . . .’ This change in wording incor\n    porates the Supreme Court[’s] Marek v.

The conferees intend that the\n     term ‘attorneys’ fees as part of the costs’ include rea\n     sonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the\n     reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is\n     found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent\n     or guardian’s case in the action or proceeding, as well\n     as traditional costs incurred in the course of litigating\n     a case.” Id., at 5 (emphasis added; citation omitted).\n   The Conference Report was returned to the Senate and\nthe House. A motion was put to each to adopt the Confer\nence Report, and both the Senate and the House agreed to\nthe Conference Report by voice votes. See Appendix B,\ninfra, at 22 (Senate); Appendix C, infra, at 23 (House). No\nobjection was raised to the Conference Report’s statement\nthat the cost-shifting provision was intended to authorize\nexpert costs. I concede that “sponsors of the legislation did\nnot mention anything on the floor about expert or consult\nant fees” at the time the Conference Report was submit\nted. Ante, at 3, n. 2 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). But I do not believe that silence\nis significant in light of the fact that every Senator and\nthree of the five Representatives who spoke on the floor\nhad previously signed his name to the Conference Re\nport—a Report that made Congress’ intent clear on the\nfirst page of its explanation. See Appendix A, infra, at 19.\nAnd every Senator and Representative that took the floor\npreceding the votes voiced his strong support for the Con\nference Report. 132 Cong. Rec. 16823–16825 (1986) (Sen\nate); id., at 17607–17612 (House). The upshot is that\nMembers of both Houses of Congress voted to adopt both\nthe statutory text before us and the Conference Report\nthat made clear that the statute’s words include the expert\ncosts here in question.\n                          B\n  The Act’s basic purpose further supports interpreting\n6     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

It assures parents that they may question a\nschool district’s decisions about what is “appropriate” for\ntheir child. And in doing so, they may secure the help of\nexperts. §1415(h)(1) (parents have “the right to be accom\npanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with\nspecial knowledge or training with respect to the problems\nof children with disabilities”); see generally Schaffer v.\nWeast, 546 U.

See Brief for Respondents\n28, n. 17 (collecting District Court decisions awarding\nexpert costs ranging from $200 to $7,600, and noting three\nreported cases in which expert awards exceeded $10,000).\nThe costs of experts may not make much of a dent in a\nschool district’s budget, as many of the experts they use in\nIDEA proceedings are already on the staff. Cf. Oberti v.\nBoard of Ed. Clementon School Dist., 995 F. 2d 1204, 1219\n(CA3 1993). But to parents, the award of costs may mat\nter enormously. Without potential reimbursement, par\nents may well lack the services of experts entirely. See\nDepartment of Education, M.

That is why this\nCourt has previously avoided interpretations that would\nbring about this kind of result. See School Comm. of\nBurlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass., 471 U. S. 359\n(1985) (construing IDEA provision granting equitable\nauthority to courts to include the power to order reim\nbursement for parents who switch their child to private\nschools if that decision later proves correct); id., at 370\n(without cost reimbursement for prevailing parents, “the\nchild’s right to a free appropriate public education, the\nparents’ right to participate fully in developing a proper\nindividualized education plan (IEP), and all of the proce\ndural safeguards would be less than complete”); Florence\nCounty School Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U. S. 7, 13 (1993)\n(holding that prevailing parents are not barred from reim\nbursement for switching their child to a private school\nthat does not meet the IDEA’s definition of a free and\nappropriate education). In Carter, we explained: “IDEA\nwas intended to ensure that children with disabilities\nreceive an education that is both appropriate and free. To\nread the provisions of §1401(a)(18) to bar reimbursement\nin the circumstances of this case would defeat this statu\ntory purpose.” Id., at 13–14 (citation omitted).\n  To read the word “costs” as requiring successful parents\nto bear their own expenses for experts suffers from the\nsame problem. Today’s result will leave many parents and\nguardians “without an expert with the firepower to match\nthe opposition,” Schaffer, supra, at __ (slip op., at 11), a far\ncry from the level playing field that Congress envisioned.\n                            II\n    The majority makes essentially three arguments against\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

It says that the statute’s purpose and\n“legislative history is simply not enough” to overcome: (1)\nthe fact that this is a Spending Clause case; (2) the text of\nthe statute; and (3) our prior cases which hold that the\nterm “costs” does not include expert costs. Ante, at 12. I\ndo not find these arguments convincing.\n                              A\n   At the outset the majority says that it “is guided by the\nfact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the\nSpending Clause.” Ante, at 3. “In a Spending Clause\ncase,” the majority adds, “the key is not what a majority of\nthe Members of both Houses intend but what the States\nare clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with\nthe acceptance of those funds.” Ante, at 12. Thus, the\nstatute’s “conditions must be set out ‘unambiguously.’ ”\nAnte, at 3–4 (citing Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981) and Rowley, 458 U. S., at\n204, n. 26). And “[w]e must ask” whether the statute\n“furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in\nthis case.” Ante, at 4.\n   I agree that the statute on its face does not clearly tell\nthe States that they must pay expert fees to prevailing\nparents. But I do not agree that the majority has posed\nthe right question. For one thing, we have repeatedly\nexamined the nature and extent of the financial burdens\nthat the IDEA imposes without reference to the Spending\nClause or any “clear-statement rule.” See, e.g., Burling\nton, supra, at 369 (private school fees); Carter, supra, at 13\n(same); Smith, 468 U.

To the\ncontrary, we have held that Pennhurst’s requirement that\nCongress “unambiguously” set out “a condition on the\ngrant of federal money” does not necessarily apply to\nlegislation setting forth “the remedies available against a\nnoncomplying State.” Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U. S. 773,\n790, n. 17 (1983) (emphasis added) (rejecting Pennhurst\nbased argument that Elementary and Secondary Educa\ntion Act of 1965 did not unambiguously provide that the\nSecretary could recover federal funds that are misused by\na State). We have added that Pennhurst does not require\nCongress “specifically” to “identify” and “proscribe each\ncondition in [Spending Clause] legislation.” Jackson v.\nBirmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167, 183 (2005) (reject\ning argument that Pennhurst precluded interpreting Title\nIX’s private cause of action to encompass retaliation (in\nternal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); see also\nBennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 665–666\n(1985). And we have denied any implication that “suits\nunder Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or\nthat contract-law principles apply to all issues that they\nraise.” Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 188–189, n. 2\n(2002) (emphasis added).\n   These statements and holdings are not surprising. After\nall, the basic objective of Pennhurst’s clear-statement\nrequirement does not demand textual clarity in respect to\nevery detail. That is because ambiguity about the precise\nnature of a statutory program’s details—particularly\nwhere they are of a kind that States might have antici\npated—is rarely relevant to the basic question: Would the\nStates have accepted the Federal Government’s funds had\nthey only known the nature of the accompanying condi\ntions? Often, the later filling-in of details through judicial\ninterpretation will not lead one to wonder whether fund\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          11\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ning recipients would have agreed to enter the basic pro\ngram at all. Given the nature of such details, it is clear\nthat the States would have entered the program regard\nless. At the same time, to view each statutory detail of a\nhighly complex federal/state program (involving say,\ntransportation, schools, the environment) simply through\nthe lens of linguistic clarity, rather than to assess its\nmeanings in terms of basic legislative purpose, is to risk a\nset of judicial interpretations that can prevent the pro\ngram, overall, from achieving its basic objectives or that\nmight well reduce a program in its details to incoherence.\n   This case is about just such a detail. Permitting parents\nto recover expert fees will not lead to awards of “indeter\nminate magnitude, untethered to compensable harm” and\nconsequently will not “pose a concern that recipients of\nfederal funding could not reasonably have anticipated.”\nBarnes, 536 U. S., at 191 (SOUTER, J., joined by O’Connor,\nJ., concurring) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Unlike, say, punitive damages, an award of\ncosts to expert parties is neither “unorthodox” nor “inde\nterminate,” and thus does not throw into doubt whether\nthe States would have entered into the program. Id., at\n188. If determinations as to whether the IDEA requires\nStates to provide continuing nursing services, Cedar Rap\nids, supra, or reimbursement for private school tuition,\nBurlington, supra, do not call for linguistic clarity, then\nthe precise content of recoverable “costs” does not call for\nsuch clarity here a fortiori.\n                           B\n  If the Court believes that the statute’s language is\nunambiguous, I must disagree. The provision at issue\nsays that a court “may award reasonable attorneys’ fees as\npart of the costs” to parents who prevail in an action\nbrought under the Act. 20 U. S. C. A. §1415(i)(3)(B) (Supp.\n2006). The statute neither defines the word “costs” nor\n12    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\npoints to any other source of law for a definition. And the\nword “costs,” alone, says nothing at all about which costs\nfalls within its scope.\n   Neither does the statutory phrase—“as part of the costs\nto the parents of a child with a disability who is the pre\nvailing party”—taken in its entirety unambiguously fore\nclose an award of expert fees. I agree that, read literally,\nthat provision does not clearly grant authority to award\nany costs at all. And one might read it, as the Court does,\nas referencing another federal statute, 28 U. S. C. §1920,\nwhich provides that authority. See ante, at 5; see also\n§1920 (federal taxation of cost statute). But such a read\ning is not inevitable. The provision (indeed, the entire\nAct) says nothing about that other statute. And one can,\nconsistent with the language, read the provision as both\nembodying a general authority to award costs while also\nspecifying the inclusion of “reasonable attorneys’ fees” as\npart of those costs (as saying, for example, that a court\n“may award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of [a] costs\n[award]”).\n   This latter reading, while linguistically the less natural,\nis legislatively the more likely. The majority’s alternative\nreading, by cross-referencing only the federal general cost-\nawarding statute (which applies solely in federal courts),\nwould produce a jumble of different cost definitions appli\ncable to similar IDEA administrative and state-court\nproceedings in different States. See §1920 (“A judge or\nclerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the\nfollowing. . . .” (emphasis added)). This result is particu\nlarly odd, as all IDEA actions must begin in state due\nprocess hearings, where the federal cost statute clearly\ndoes not apply, and the overwhelming majority of these\nactions are never appealed to any court. See GAO, Report\nto the Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Health,\nEducation, Labor and Pensions, U. S. Senate, Special\nEducation: Numbers of Formal Disputes are Generally\n                   Cite as: 548 U.

And when parents\ndo appeal, they can file their actions in either state or\nfederal courts. 20 U. S. C. A. §1415(i)(2)(A) (Supp. 2006).\n  Would Congress “obviously” have wanted the content of\nthe word “costs” to vary from State to State, proceeding to\nproceeding? Ante, at 5. Why? At most, the majority’s\nreading of the text is plausible; it is not the only possible\nreading.\n                                C\n   The majority’s most persuasive argument does not focus\non either the Spending Clause or lack of statutory ambigu\nity. Rather, the majority says that “costs” is a term of art.\nIn light of the law’s long practice of excluding expert fees\nfrom the scope of the word “costs,” along with this Court’s\ncases interpreting the word similarly in other statutes, the\n“legislative history is simply not enough.” Ante, at 12.\n   I am perfectly willing to assume that the majority is\ncorrect about the traditional scope of the word “costs.” In\ntwo cases this Court has held that the word “costs” is\nlimited to the list set forth in 28 U. S. C. §1920 and does\nnot include fees paid to experts. See Crawford Fitting Co.\nv. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 (1987) (interpreting Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 54(d)); West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v.\nCasey, 499 U. S. 83 (1991) (interpreting 42 U. S. C. §1988\n(1988 ed.)). But Congress is free to redefine terms of art.\nSee, e.g., Casey, 499 U. S., at 88–90 (citing examples of\nstatutes that shift “‘costs of litigation (including . . . expert\nwitness fees)’ ”). And we have suggested that it might well\n14    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n                       MURPHY\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndo so through a statutory provision worded in a manner\nsimilar to the statute here—indeed, we cited the Conference\nReport language here at issue. Id., at 91–92, n. 5 (charac\nterizing language as an “apparent effort to depart from\nordinary meaning and to define a term of art” and noting\nthat Congress made no such “effort” in respect to 42 U. S. C.\n§1988).\n   Regardless, here the statute itself indicates that Con\ngress did not intend to use the word “costs” as a term of\nart. The HCPA, which added the cost-shifting provision\n(in §2) to the IDEA, also added another provision (in §4)\ndirecting the GAO to “conduct a study of the impact of the\namendments to the [IDEA] made by section 2” over a 31⁄2\nyear period following the Act’s effective date. §4(a), 100\nStat. 797. To determine the fiscal impact of §2 (the cost-\nshifting provision), §4 ordered the GAO to submit a report\nto Congress containing, among other things, the following\ninformation:\n     “Data, for a geographically representative select sam\n     ple of States, indicating (A) the specific amount of at\n     torneys’ fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the pre\n     vailing party, in each action and proceeding under\n     [§2] from the date of the enactment of this Act\n     through fiscal year 1988, and the range of such fees,\n     costs and expenses awarded in the actions and pro\n     ceedings under such section, categorized by type of\n     complaint and (B) for the same sample as in (A) the\n     number of hours spent by personnel, including attor\n     neys and consultants, involved in the action or pro\n     ceeding, and expenses incurred by the parents and the\n     State educational agency and local educational\n     agency.” §4(b)(3), id., at 797–798 (emphasis added).\n  If Congress intended the word “costs” in §2 to authorize\nan award of only those costs listed in the federal cost\nstatute, why did it use the word “expenses” in §4(b)(3)(A)\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nas part of the “amount awarded to the prevailing party”?\nWhen used as a term of art, after all, “costs” does not cover\nexpenses. Nor does the federal costs statute cover any\nexpenses—at least not any that Congress could have\nwanted the GAO to study. Cf. 28 U. S. C. §1920 (referring\nonly once to “expenses,” and doing so solely to refer to\nspecial interpretation services provided in actions initiated\nby the United States).\n  Further, why did Congress, when asking the GAO (in\nthe statute itself) to study the “numbers of hours spent by\npersonnel” include among those personnel both attorneys\n“and consultants”? Who but experts could those consult\nants be? Why would Congress want the GAO to study the\nhours that those experts “spent,” unless it thought that it\nwould help keep track of the “costs” that the statute\nimposed?\n  Of course, one might, through speculation, find other\nanswers to these questions. One might, for example,\nimagine that Congress wanted the GAO to study the\nexpenses that payment of expert fees engendered in state-\ncourt proceedings where state, but not federal, law re\nquires that “ ‘expenses’ other than ‘costs’ might be receiv\nable.” Ante, at 7, n. 1; but see supra, at 12-13. Or one\nmight think that the word “expenses” is surplusage. Ante,\nat 7, n. 1; but see Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174\n(2001) (expressing Court’s “ ‘reluctan[ce] to treat statutory\nterms as surplusage in any setting,’” but especially when\nthey play “a pivotal role in the statutory scheme”). Or one\nmight believe that Congress was interested in the hours\nthese experts spent, but not in the fees they obtained.\nAnte, at 7. But these answers are not necessarily consis\ntent with the purpose of the GAO study provision, a pur\npose revealed by the language of the provision and its\nposition in the statute. Its placement and its reference to\n§2 indicate that Congress ordered the study to help it keep\ntrack of the magnitude of the reimbursements that an\n16    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                  \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nearlier part of the new statute (namely, §2) mandated.\nSee 100 Stat. 797 (stating that purpose of GAO study was\nto determine the “impact” of “section 2”). And the only\nreimbursement requirement that §2 mandates is the\npayment of “costs.”\n   But why speculate about this? We know what Congress\nintended the GAO study to cover. It told the GAO in its\nConference Report that the word “costs” included the costs\nof experts. And, not surprisingly, the GAO made clear\nthat it understood precisely what Congress asked it to do.\nIn its final report, the GAO wrote: “Parents can receive\nreimbursement from state or local education agencies for\nsome or all of their attorney fees and related expenses if\nthey are the prevailing party in part or all of administra\ntive hearings or court proceedings. Expert witness fees,\ncosts of tests or evaluations found to be necessary during\nthe case, and court costs for services rendered during ad\nministrative and court proceedings are examples of reim\nbursable expenses.” GAO, Briefing Report to Congres\nsional Requesters, Special Education: The Attorney Fees\nProvision of Public Law 99–372 GAO/HRD–22BR, p. 13\n(Nov. 1989). At the very least, this amounts to some indi\ncation that Congress intended the word “costs,” not as a\nterm of art, not as it was used in the statutes at issue in\nCasey and Crawford Fitting, but rather as including cer\ntain additional “expenses.” If that is so, the claims of\ntradition, of the interpretation this Court has given other\nstatutes, cannot be so strong as to prevent us from exam\nining the legislative history. And that history could not be\nmore clear about the matter: Congress intended the\nstatutory phrase “attorneys’ fees as part of the costs” to\ninclude the costs of experts. See Part I, supra.\n                           III\n For the reasons I have set forth, I cannot agree with the\nmajority’s conclusion.

And our ultimate\njudicial goal is to interpret language in light of the statute’s\npurpose. Only by seeking that purpose can we avoid the\nsubstitution of judicial for legislative will. Only by reading\nlanguage in its light can we maintain the democratic link\nbetween voters, legislators, statutes, and ultimate imple\nmentation, upon which the legitimacy of our constitutional\nsystem rests.\n   In my view, to keep faith with that interpretive goal, we\nmust retain all traditional interpretive tools—text, struc\nture, history, and purpose. And, because faithful interpre\ntation is art as well as science, we cannot, through rule or\ncanon, rule out the use of any of these tools, automatically\nand in advance. Cf. Helvering v. Gregory, 69 F. 2d 809,\n810–811 (CA2 1934) (L. Hand, J.).\n   Nothing in the Constitution forbids us from giving\nsignificant weight to legislative history. By disregarding a\nclear statement in a legislative report adopted without\nopposition in both Houses of Congress, the majority has\nreached a result no Member of Congress expected or\novertly desired. It has adopted an interpretation that\nundercuts, rather than furthers, the statute’s purpose, a\n“free” and “appropriate” public education for “all” children\nwith disabilities. See Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,\n532 U. S. 105, 133 (2001) (STEVENS, J., joined by SOUTER,\nGINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., dissenting) (“A method of\nstatutory interpretation that is deliberately uninformed,\nand hence unconstrained, may produce a result that is\nconsistent with a court’s own views of how things should\nbe, but it may also defeat the very purpose for which a\nprovision was enacted”). And it has adopted an approach\nthat, I fear, divorces law from life. See Duncan, supra, at\n193 (BREYER, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n18   ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD.
