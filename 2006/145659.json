She <span class=\"star-pagination\">*322</span> later died of complications stemming from her injuries. Petitioner was convicted by a South Carolina jury of murder, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, first-degree burglary, and robbery, and he was sentenced to death. <i>State</i> v. <i>Holmes,</i> 320 S. C. 259, 262, 464 S. E. 2d 334, 336 (1995). The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed his convictions and sentence, and this Court denied certiorari. <i>Ibid.,</i> cert. denied, 517 U. S. 1248 (1996). Upon state postconviction review, however, petitioner was granted a new trial. 361 S. C. 333, 335, n. 1, 605 S. E. 2d 19, 20, n. 1 (2004).</p>\n<p>At the second trial, the prosecution relied heavily on the following forensic evidence:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) [Petitioner's] palm print was found just above the door knob on the interior side of the front door of the victim's house; (2) fibers consistent with a black sweat-shirt owned by [petitioner] were found on the victim's bed sheets; (3) matching blue fibers were found on the victim's pink nightgown and on [petitioner's] blue jeans; (4) microscopically consistent fibers were found on the pink nightgown and on [petitioner's] underwear; (5) [petitioner's] underwear contained a mixture of DNA from two individuals, and 99.99% of the population other than [petitioner] and the victim were excluded as contributors to that mixture; and (6) [petitioner's] tank top was found to contain a mixture of [petitioner's] blood and the victim's blood.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24.</blockquote>\n<p>In addition, the prosecution introduced evidence that petitioner had been seen near Stewart's home within an hour of the time when, according to the prosecution's evidence, the attack took place. <i>Id.,</i> at 337-338, 343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 21, 24.</p>\n<p>As a major part of his defense, petitioner attempted to undermine the State's forensic evidence by suggesting that it had been contaminated and that certain law enforcement officers had engaged in a plot to frame him. <i>Id.,</i> at 339, 605 S. E. 2d, at 22. Petitioner's expert witnesses criticized the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*323</span> procedures used by the police in handling the fiber and DNA evidence and in collecting the fingerprint evidence. App. 299-311, 313-323. Another defense expert provided testimony that petitioner cited as supporting his claim that the palm print had been planted by the police. <i>Id.,</i> at 326-327.</p>\n<p>Petitioner also sought to introduce proof that another man, Jimmy McCaw White, had attacked Stewart. 361 S. C., at 340, 605 S. E. 2d, at 22. At a pretrial hearing, petitioner proffered several witnesses who placed White in the victim's neighborhood on the morning of the assault, as well as four other witnesses who testified that White had either acknowledged that petitioner was \"`innocent'\" or had actually admitted to committing the crimes. <i>Id.,</i> at 340-342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 22-23. One witness recounted that when he asked White about the \"word . . . on the street\" that White was responsible for Stewart's murder, White \"put his head down and he raised his head back up and he said, well, you know I like older women.\" App. 119. According to this witness, White added that \"he did what they say he did\" and that he had \"no regrets about it at all.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 120. Another witness, who had been incarcerated with White, testified that White had admitted to assaulting Stewart, that a police officer had asked the witness to testify falsely against petitioner, and that employees of the prosecutor's office, while soliciting the witness' cooperation, had spoken of manufacturing evidence against petitioner. <i>Id.,</i> at 38-50. White testified at the pretrial hearing and denied making the incriminating statements. 361 S. C., at 341-342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 23. He also provided an alibi for the time of the crime, but another witness refuted his alibi. <i>Id.,</i> at 342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 23.</p>\n<p>The trial court excluded petitioner's third-party guilt evidence citing <i>State</i> v. <i>Gregory,</i> 198 S. C. 98, 16 S. E. 2d 532 (1941), which held that such evidence is admissible if it \"`raise[s] a reasonable inference or presumption as to [the defendant's] own innocence'\" but is not admissible if it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*324</span> merely \"`cast[s] a bare suspicion upon another'\" or \"`raise[s] a conjectural inference as to the commission of the crime by another.'\" App. 133-134 (quoting <i>Gregory, supra,</i> at 104, 16 S. E. 2d, at 534). On appeal, the South Carolina Supreme Court found no error in the exclusion of petitioner's third-party guilt evidence. Citing both <i>Gregory</i> and its later decision in <i>State</i> v. <i>Gay,</i> 343 S. C. 543, 541 S. E. 2d 541 (2001), the State Supreme Court held that \"where there is strong evidence of an appellant's guilt, especially where there is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's alleged guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant's own innocence.\" 361 S. C., at 342-343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24. Applying this standard, the court held that petitioner could not \"overcome the forensic evidence against him to raise a reasonable inference of his own innocence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24. We granted certiorari. 545 U. S. 1164 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>\"[S]tate and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Scheffer,</i> 523 U. S. 303, 308 (1998); see also <i>Crane</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 476 U. S. 683, 689-690 (1986); <i>Marshall</i> v. <i>Lonberger,</i> 459 U. S. 422, 438, n. 6 (1983); <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>Mississippi,</i> 410 U. S. 284, 302-303 (1973); <i>Spencer</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 385 U. S. 554, 564 (1967). This latitude, however, has limits. \"Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants `a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.'\" <i>Crane, supra,</i> at 690 (quoting <i>California</i> v. <i>Trombetta,</i> 467 U. S. 479, 485 (1984); citations omitted). This right is abridged by evidence rules that \"infring[e] upon a weighty interest of the accused\" and are \"`arbitrary' or `disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.'\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*325</span> <i>Scheffer, supra,</i> at 308 (quoting <i>Rock</i> v. <i>Arkansas,</i> 483 U. S. 44, 58, 56 (1987)).</p>\n<p>This Court's cases contain several illustrations of \"arbitrary\" rules, <i>i. e.,</i> rules that excluded important defense evidence but that did not serve any legitimate interests. In <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 388 U. S. 14 (1967), state statutes barred a person who had been charged as a participant in a crime from testifying in defense of another alleged participant unless the witness had been acquitted. As a result, when the defendant in <i>Washington</i> was tried for murder, he was precluded from calling as a witness a person who had been charged and previously convicted of committing the same murder. Holding that the defendant's right to put on a defense had been violated, we noted that the rule embodied in the statutes could not \"even be defended on the ground that it rationally sets apart a group of persons who are particularly likely to commit perjury\" since the rule allowed an alleged participant to testify if he or she had been acquitted or was called by the prosecution. <i>Id.,</i> at 22-23.</p>\n<p>A similar constitutional violation occurred in <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>Mississippi, supra</i><i>.</i> A murder defendant called as a witness a man named McDonald, who had previously confessed to the murder. When McDonald repudiated the confession on the stand, the defendant was denied permission to examine McDonald as an adverse witness based on the State's \"`voucher' rule,\" which barred parties from impeaching their own witnesses. <i>Id.,</i> at 294. In addition, because the state hearsay rule did not include an exception for statements against penal interest, the defendant was not permitted to introduce evidence that McDonald had made self-incriminating statements to three other persons. Noting that the State had not even attempted to \"defend\" or \"explain [the] underlying rationale\" of the \"voucher rule,\" <i>id.,</i> at 297, this Court held that \"the exclusion of [the evidence of McDonald's out-of-court statements], coupled with the State's refusal to permit [the defendant] to cross-examine McDonald, denied him a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*326</span> trial in accord with traditional and fundamental standards of due process,\" <i>id.,</i> at 302.</p>\n<p>Another arbitrary rule was held unconstitutional in <i>Crane</i> v. <i>Kentucky, supra</i><i>.</i> There, the defendant was prevented from attempting to show at trial that his confession was unreliable because of the circumstances under which it was obtained, and neither the State Supreme Court nor the prosecution \"advanced any rational justification for the wholesale exclusion of this body of potentially exculpatory evidence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 691.</p>\n<p>In <i>Rock</i> v. <i>Arkansas, supra</i><i>,</i> this Court held that a rule prohibiting hypnotically refreshed testimony was unconstitutional because \"[w]holesale inadmissibility of a defendant's testimony is an arbitrary restriction on the right to testify in the absence of clear evidence by the State repudiating the validity of all post-hypnosis recollections.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 61. By contrast, in <i>Scheffer, supra,</i> we held that a rule excluding all polygraph evidence did not abridge the right to present a defense because the rule \"serve[d] several legitimate interests in the criminal trial process,\" was \"neither arbitrary nor disproportionate in promoting these ends,\" and did not \"implicate a sufficiently weighty interest of the defendant.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 309.</p>\n<p>While the Constitution thus prohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote, well-established rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Fed. Rule Evid. 403; Uniform Rule of Evid. 45 (1953); ALI, Model Code of Evidence Rule 303 (1942); 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence §§ 1863, 1904 (1904). Plainly referring to rules of this type, we have stated that the Constitution permits judges \"to exclude evidence that is `repetitive . . ., only marginally relevant' or poses an undue risk of `harassment, prejudice, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*327</span> [or] confusion of the issues.'\" <i>Crane,</i> 476 U. S., at 689-690 (quoting <i>Delaware</i> v. <i>Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U. S. 673, 679 (1986); ellipsis and brackets in original). See also <i>Montana</i> v. <i>Egelhoff,</i> 518 U. S. 37, 42 (1996) (plurality opinion) (terming such rules \"familiar and unquestionably constitutional\").</p>\n<p>A specific application of this principle is found in rules regulating the admission of evidence proffered by criminal defendants to show that someone else committed the crime with which they are charged. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 41 C. J. S., Homicide § 216, pp. 56-58 (1991) (\"Evidence tending to show the commission by another person of the crime charged may be introduced by accused when it is inconsistent with, and raises a reasonable doubt of, his own guilt; but frequently matters offered in evidence for this purpose are so remote and lack such connection with the crime that they are excluded\"); 40A Am. Jur. 2d, Homicide § 286, pp. 136-138 (1999) (\"[T]he accused may introduce any legal evidence tending to prove that another person may have committed the crime with which the defendant is charged . . . . [Such evidence] may be excluded where it does not sufficiently connect the other person to the crime, as, for example, where the evidence is speculative or remote, or does not tend to prove or disprove a material fact in issue at the defendant's trial\" (footnotes omitted)). Such rules are widely accepted,<sup>[*]</sup> and neither petitioner nor his <i>amici</i> challenge them here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*328</span> In <i>Gregory,</i> the South Carolina Supreme Court adopted and applied a rule apparently intended to be of this type, given the court's references to the \"applicable rule\" from Corpus Juris and American Jurisprudence:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`[E]vidence offered by accused as to the commission of the crime by another person must be limited to such facts as are inconsistent with his own guilt, and to such facts as raise a reasonable inference or presumption as to his own innocence; evidence which can have (no) other effect than to cast a bare suspicion upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference as to the commission of the crime by another, is not admissible. . . . [B]efore such testimony can be received, there must be such proof of connection with it, such a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such other person as the guilty party.'\" 198 S. C., at 104-105, 16 S. E. 2d, at 534-535 (quoting 16 C. J., Criminal Law § 1085, p. 560 (1918), and 20 Am. Jur., Evidence § 265, p. 254 (1939); footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>In <i>Gay</i> and this case, however, the South Carolina Supreme Court radically changed and extended the rule. In <i>Gay,</i> after recognizing the standard applied in <i>Gregory,</i> the court stated that \"[i]n view of the strong evidence of appellant's guiltespecially the forensic evidence . . . the proffered evidence . . . did not raise `a reasonable inference' as to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*329</span> appellant's own innocence.\" 343 S. C., at 550, 541 S. E. 2d, at 545 (quoting <i>Gregory, supra,</i> at 104, 16 S. E. 2d, at 534, in turn quoting 16 C. J., § 1085, at 560). Similarly, in the present case, as noted, the State Supreme Court applied the rule that \"where there is strong evidence of [a defendant's] guilt, especially where there is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's alleged guilt\" may (or perhaps must) be excluded. 361 S. C., at 342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24.</p>\n<p>Under this rule, the trial judge does not focus on the probative value or the potential adverse effects of admitting the defense evidence of third-party guilt. Instead, the critical inquiry concerns the strength of the prosecution's case: If the prosecution's case is strong enough, the evidence of third-party guilt is excluded even if that evidence, if viewed independently, would have great probative value and even if it would not pose an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as applied in this case, the South Carolina Supreme Court's rule seems to call for little, if any, examination of the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses or the reliability of its evidence. Here, for example, the defense strenuously claimed that the prosecution's forensic evidence was so unreliable (due to mishandling and a deliberate plot to frame petitioner) that the evidence should not have even been admitted. The South Carolina Supreme Court responded that these challenges did not entirely \"eviscerate\" the forensic evidence and that the defense challenges went to the weight and not to the admissibility of that evidence. <i>Id.,</i> at 343, n. 8, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24, n. 8. Yet, in evaluating the prosecution's forensic evidence and deeming it to be \"strong\"and thereby justifying exclusion of petitioner's third-party guilt evidencethe South Carolina Supreme Court made no mention of the defense challenges to the prosecution's evidence.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*330</span> Interpreted in this way, the rule applied by the State Supreme Court does not rationally serve the end that the <i>Gregory</i> rule and its analogues in other jurisdictions were designed to promote, <i>i. e.,</i> to focus the trial on the central issues by excluding evidence that has only a very weak logical connection to the central issues. The rule applied in this case appears to be based on the following logic: Where (1) it is clear that only one person was involved in the commission of a particular crime and (2) there is strong evidence that the defendant was the perpetrator, it follows that evidence of third-party guilt must be weak. But this logic depends on an accurate evaluation of the prosecution's proof, and the true strength of the prosecution's proof cannot be assessed without considering challenges to the reliability of the prosecution's evidence. Just because the prosecution's evidence, <i>if credited,</i> would provide strong support for a guilty verdict, it does not follow that evidence of third-party guilt has only a weak logical connection to the central issues in the case. And where the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses or the reliability of its evidence is not conceded, the strength of the prosecution's case cannot be assessed without making the sort of factual findings that have traditionally been reserved for the trier of fact and that the South Carolina courts did not purport to make in this case.</p>\n<p>The rule applied in this case is no more logical than its converse would be, <i>i. e.,</i> a rule barring the prosecution from introducing evidence of a defendant's guilt if the defendant is able to proffer, at a pretrial hearing, evidence that, if believed, strongly supports a verdict of not guilty. In the present case, for example, petitioner proffered evidence that, if believed, squarely proved that White, not petitioner, was the perpetrator. It would make no sense, however, to hold that this proffer precluded the prosecution from introducing its evidence, including the forensic evidence that, if credited, provided strong proof of petitioner's guilt.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*331</span> The point is that, by evaluating the strength of only one party's evidence, no logical conclusion can be reached regarding the strength of contrary evidence offered by the other side to rebut or cast doubt. Because the rule applied by the State Supreme Court in this case did not heed this point, the rule is \"arbitrary\" in the sense that it does not rationally serve the end that the <i>Gregory</i> rule and other similar third-party guilt rules were designed to further. Nor has the State identified any other legitimate end that the rule serves. It follows that the rule applied in this case by the State Supreme Court violates a criminal defendant's right to have \"`a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.'\" <i>Crane,</i> 476 U. S., at 690 (quoting <i>Trombetta,</i> 467 U. S., at 485).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for Forty Professors of Evidence Law by <i>Samuel R.

She <span class=\"star-pagination\">*322</span> later died of complications stemming from her injuries. Petitioner was convicted by a South Carolina jury of murder, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, first-degree burglary, and robbery, and he was sentenced to death. <i>State</i> v. <i>Holmes,</i> 320 S. C. 259, 262, 464 S. E. 2d 334, 336 (1995). The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed his convictions and sentence, and this Court denied certiorari. <i>Ibid.,</i> cert. denied, 517 U. S. 1248 (1996). Upon state postconviction review, however, petitioner was granted a new trial. 361 S. C. 333, 335, n. 1, 605 S. E. 2d 19, 20, n. 1 (2004).</p>\n<p>At the second trial, the prosecution relied heavily on the following forensic evidence:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) [Petitioner's] palm print was found just above the door knob on the interior side of the front door of the victim's house; (2) fibers consistent with a black sweat-shirt owned by [petitioner] were found on the victim's bed sheets; (3) matching blue fibers were found on the victim's pink nightgown and on [petitioner's] blue jeans; (4) microscopically consistent fibers were found on the pink nightgown and on [petitioner's] underwear; (5) [petitioner's] underwear contained a mixture of DNA from two individuals, and 99.99% of the population other than [petitioner] and the victim were excluded as contributors to that mixture; and (6) [petitioner's] tank top was found to contain a mixture of [petitioner's] blood and the victim's blood.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24.</blockquote>\n<p>In addition, the prosecution introduced evidence that petitioner had been seen near Stewart's home within an hour of the time when, according to the prosecution's evidence, the attack took place. <i>Id.,</i> at 337-338, 343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 21, 24.</p>\n<p>As a major part of his defense, petitioner attempted to undermine the State's forensic evidence by suggesting that it had been contaminated and that certain law enforcement officers had engaged in a plot to frame him. <i>Id.,</i> at 339, 605 S. E. 2d, at 22. Petitioner's expert witnesses criticized the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*323</span> procedures used by the police in handling the fiber and DNA evidence and in collecting the fingerprint evidence. App. 299-311, 313-323. Another defense expert provided testimony that petitioner cited as supporting his claim that the palm print had been planted by the police. <i>Id.,</i> at 326-327.</p>\n<p>Petitioner also sought to introduce proof that another man, Jimmy McCaw White, had attacked Stewart. 361 S. C., at 340, 605 S. E. 2d, at 22. At a pretrial hearing, petitioner proffered several witnesses who placed White in the victim's neighborhood on the morning of the assault, as well as four other witnesses who testified that White had either acknowledged that petitioner was \"`innocent'\" or had actually admitted to committing the crimes. <i>Id.,</i> at 340-342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 22-23. One witness recounted that when he asked White about the \"word . . . on the street\" that White was responsible for Stewart's murder, White \"put his head down and he raised his head back up and he said, well, you know I like older women.\" App. 119. According to this witness, White added that \"he did what they say he did\" and that he had \"no regrets about it at all.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 120. Another witness, who had been incarcerated with White, testified that White had admitted to assaulting Stewart, that a police officer had asked the witness to testify falsely against petitioner, and that employees of the prosecutor's office, while soliciting the witness' cooperation, had spoken of manufacturing evidence against petitioner. <i>Id.,</i> at 38-50. White testified at the pretrial hearing and denied making the incriminating statements. 361 S. C., at 341-342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 23. He also provided an alibi for the time of the crime, but another witness refuted his alibi. <i>Id.,</i> at 342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 23.</p>\n<p>The trial court excluded petitioner's third-party guilt evidence citing <i>State</i> v. <i>Gregory,</i> 198 S. C. 98, 16 S. E. 2d 532 (1941), which held that such evidence is admissible if it \"`raise[s] a reasonable inference or presumption as to [the defendant's] own innocence'\" but is not admissible if it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*324</span> merely \"`cast[s] a bare suspicion upon another'\" or \"`raise[s] a conjectural inference as to the commission of the crime by another.'\" App. 133-134 (quoting <i>Gregory, supra,</i> at 104, 16 S. E. 2d, at 534). On appeal, the South Carolina Supreme Court found no error in the exclusion of petitioner's third-party guilt evidence. Citing both <i>Gregory</i> and its later decision in <i>State</i> v. <i>Gay,</i> 343 S. C. 543, 541 S. E. 2d 541 (2001), the State Supreme Court held that \"where there is strong evidence of an appellant's guilt, especially where there is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's alleged guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant's own innocence.\" 361 S. C., at 342-343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24. Applying this standard, the court held that petitioner could not \"overcome the forensic evidence against him to raise a reasonable inference of his own innocence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24. We granted certiorari. 545 U. S. 1164 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>\"[S]tate and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Scheffer,</i> 523 U. S. 303, 308 (1998); see also <i>Crane</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 476 U. S. 683, 689-690 (1986); <i>Marshall</i> v. <i>Lonberger,</i> 459 U. S. 422, 438, n. 6 (1983); <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>Mississippi,</i> 410 U. S. 284, 302-303 (1973); <i>Spencer</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 385 U. S. 554, 564 (1967). This latitude, however, has limits. \"Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants `a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.'\" <i>Crane, supra,</i> at 690 (quoting <i>California</i> v. <i>Trombetta,</i> 467 U. S. 479, 485 (1984); citations omitted). This right is abridged by evidence rules that \"infring[e] upon a weighty interest of the accused\" and are \"`arbitrary' or `disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.'\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*325</span> <i>Scheffer, supra,</i> at 308 (quoting <i>Rock</i> v. <i>Arkansas,</i> 483 U. S. 44, 58, 56 (1987)).</p>\n<p>This Court's cases contain several illustrations of \"arbitrary\" rules, <i>i. e.,</i> rules that excluded important defense evidence but that did not serve any legitimate interests. In <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 388 U. S. 14 (1967), state statutes barred a person who had been charged as a participant in a crime from testifying in defense of another alleged participant unless the witness had been acquitted. As a result, when the defendant in <i>Washington</i> was tried for murder, he was precluded from calling as a witness a person who had been charged and previously convicted of committing the same murder. Holding that the defendant's right to put on a defense had been violated, we noted that the rule embodied in the statutes could not \"even be defended on the ground that it rationally sets apart a group of persons who are particularly likely to commit perjury\" since the rule allowed an alleged participant to testify if he or she had been acquitted or was called by the prosecution. <i>Id.,</i> at 22-23.</p>\n<p>A similar constitutional violation occurred in <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>Mississippi, supra</i><i>.</i> A murder defendant called as a witness a man named McDonald, who had previously confessed to the murder. When McDonald repudiated the confession on the stand, the defendant was denied permission to examine McDonald as an adverse witness based on the State's \"`voucher' rule,\" which barred parties from impeaching their own witnesses. <i>Id.,</i> at 294. In addition, because the state hearsay rule did not include an exception for statements against penal interest, the defendant was not permitted to introduce evidence that McDonald had made self-incriminating statements to three other persons. Noting that the State had not even attempted to \"defend\" or \"explain [the] underlying rationale\" of the \"voucher rule,\" <i>id.,</i> at 297, this Court held that \"the exclusion of [the evidence of McDonald's out-of-court statements], coupled with the State's refusal to permit [the defendant] to cross-examine McDonald, denied him a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*326</span> trial in accord with traditional and fundamental standards of due process,\" <i>id.,</i> at 302.</p>\n<p>Another arbitrary rule was held unconstitutional in <i>Crane</i> v. <i>Kentucky, supra</i><i>.</i> There, the defendant was prevented from attempting to show at trial that his confession was unreliable because of the circumstances under which it was obtained, and neither the State Supreme Court nor the prosecution \"advanced any rational justification for the wholesale exclusion of this body of potentially exculpatory evidence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 691.</p>\n<p>In <i>Rock</i> v. <i>Arkansas, supra</i><i>,</i> this Court held that a rule prohibiting hypnotically refreshed testimony was unconstitutional because \"[w]holesale inadmissibility of a defendant's testimony is an arbitrary restriction on the right to testify in the absence of clear evidence by the State repudiating the validity of all post-hypnosis recollections.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 61. By contrast, in <i>Scheffer, supra,</i> we held that a rule excluding all polygraph evidence did not abridge the right to present a defense because the rule \"serve[d] several legitimate interests in the criminal trial process,\" was \"neither arbitrary nor disproportionate in promoting these ends,\" and did not \"implicate a sufficiently weighty interest of the defendant.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 309.</p>\n<p>While the Constitution thus prohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote, well-established rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Fed. Rule Evid. 403; Uniform Rule of Evid. 45 (1953); ALI, Model Code of Evidence Rule 303 (1942); 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence §§ 1863, 1904 (1904). Plainly referring to rules of this type, we have stated that the Constitution permits judges \"to exclude evidence that is `repetitive . . ., only marginally relevant' or poses an undue risk of `harassment, prejudice, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*327</span> [or] confusion of the issues.'\" <i>Crane,</i> 476 U. S., at 689-690 (quoting <i>Delaware</i> v. <i>Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U. S. 673, 679 (1986); ellipsis and brackets in original). See also <i>Montana</i> v. <i>Egelhoff,</i> 518 U. S. 37, 42 (1996) (plurality opinion) (terming such rules \"familiar and unquestionably constitutional\").</p>\n<p>A specific application of this principle is found in rules regulating the admission of evidence proffered by criminal defendants to show that someone else committed the crime with which they are charged. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 41 C. J. S., Homicide § 216, pp. 56-58 (1991) (\"Evidence tending to show the commission by another person of the crime charged may be introduced by accused when it is inconsistent with, and raises a reasonable doubt of, his own guilt; but frequently matters offered in evidence for this purpose are so remote and lack such connection with the crime that they are excluded\"); 40A Am. Jur. 2d, Homicide § 286, pp. 136-138 (1999) (\"[T]he accused may introduce any legal evidence tending to prove that another person may have committed the crime with which the defendant is charged . . . . [Such evidence] may be excluded where it does not sufficiently connect the other person to the crime, as, for example, where the evidence is speculative or remote, or does not tend to prove or disprove a material fact in issue at the defendant's trial\" (footnotes omitted)). Such rules are widely accepted,<sup>[*]</sup> and neither petitioner nor his <i>amici</i> challenge them here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*328</span> In <i>Gregory,</i> the South Carolina Supreme Court adopted and applied a rule apparently intended to be of this type, given the court's references to the \"applicable rule\" from Corpus Juris and American Jurisprudence:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`[E]vidence offered by accused as to the commission of the crime by another person must be limited to such facts as are inconsistent with his own guilt, and to such facts as raise a reasonable inference or presumption as to his own innocence; evidence which can have (no) other effect than to cast a bare suspicion upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference as to the commission of the crime by another, is not admissible. . . . [B]efore such testimony can be received, there must be such proof of connection with it, such a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such other person as the guilty party.'\" 198 S. C., at 104-105, 16 S. E. 2d, at 534-535 (quoting 16 C. J., Criminal Law § 1085, p. 560 (1918), and 20 Am. Jur., Evidence § 265, p. 254 (1939); footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>In <i>Gay</i> and this case, however, the South Carolina Supreme Court radically changed and extended the rule. In <i>Gay,</i> after recognizing the standard applied in <i>Gregory,</i> the court stated that \"[i]n view of the strong evidence of appellant's guiltespecially the forensic evidence . . . the proffered evidence . . . did not raise `a reasonable inference' as to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*329</span> appellant's own innocence.\" 343 S. C., at 550, 541 S. E. 2d, at 545 (quoting <i>Gregory, supra,</i> at 104, 16 S. E. 2d, at 534, in turn quoting 16 C. J., § 1085, at 560). Similarly, in the present case, as noted, the State Supreme Court applied the rule that \"where there is strong evidence of [a defendant's] guilt, especially where there is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's alleged guilt\" may (or perhaps must) be excluded. 361 S. C., at 342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24.</p>\n<p>Under this rule, the trial judge does not focus on the probative value or the potential adverse effects of admitting the defense evidence of third-party guilt. Instead, the critical inquiry concerns the strength of the prosecution's case: If the prosecution's case is strong enough, the evidence of third-party guilt is excluded even if that evidence, if viewed independently, would have great probative value and even if it would not pose an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as applied in this case, the South Carolina Supreme Court's rule seems to call for little, if any, examination of the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses or the reliability of its evidence. Here, for example, the defense strenuously claimed that the prosecution's forensic evidence was so unreliable (due to mishandling and a deliberate plot to frame petitioner) that the evidence should not have even been admitted. The South Carolina Supreme Court responded that these challenges did not entirely \"eviscerate\" the forensic evidence and that the defense challenges went to the weight and not to the admissibility of that evidence. <i>Id.,</i> at 343, n. 8, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24, n. 8. Yet, in evaluating the prosecution's forensic evidence and deeming it to be \"strong\"and thereby justifying exclusion of petitioner's third-party guilt evidencethe South Carolina Supreme Court made no mention of the defense challenges to the prosecution's evidence.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*330</span> Interpreted in this way, the rule applied by the State Supreme Court does not rationally serve the end that the <i>Gregory</i> rule and its analogues in other jurisdictions were designed to promote, <i>i. e.,</i> to focus the trial on the central issues by excluding evidence that has only a very weak logical connection to the central issues. The rule applied in this case appears to be based on the following logic: Where (1) it is clear that only one person was involved in the commission of a particular crime and (2) there is strong evidence that the defendant was the perpetrator, it follows that evidence of third-party guilt must be weak. But this logic depends on an accurate evaluation of the prosecution's proof, and the true strength of the prosecution's proof cannot be assessed without considering challenges to the reliability of the prosecution's evidence. Just because the prosecution's evidence, <i>if credited,</i> would provide strong support for a guilty verdict, it does not follow that evidence of third-party guilt has only a weak logical connection to the central issues in the case. And where the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses or the reliability of its evidence is not conceded, the strength of the prosecution's case cannot be assessed without making the sort of factual findings that have traditionally been reserved for the trier of fact and that the South Carolina courts did not purport to make in this case.</p>\n<p>The rule applied in this case is no more logical than its converse would be, <i>i. e.,</i> a rule barring the prosecution from introducing evidence of a defendant's guilt if the defendant is able to proffer, at a pretrial hearing, evidence that, if believed, strongly supports a verdict of not guilty. In the present case, for example, petitioner proffered evidence that, if believed, squarely proved that White, not petitioner, was the perpetrator. It would make no sense, however, to hold that this proffer precluded the prosecution from introducing its evidence, including the forensic evidence that, if credited, provided strong proof of petitioner's guilt.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*331</span> The point is that, by evaluating the strength of only one party's evidence, no logical conclusion can be reached regarding the strength of contrary evidence offered by the other side to rebut or cast doubt. Because the rule applied by the State Supreme Court in this case did not heed this point, the rule is \"arbitrary\" in the sense that it does not rationally serve the end that the <i>Gregory</i> rule and other similar third-party guilt rules were designed to further. Nor has the State identified any other legitimate end that the rule serves. It follows that the rule applied in this case by the State Supreme Court violates a criminal defendant's right to have \"`a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.'\" <i>Crane,</i> 476 U. S., at 690 (quoting <i>Trombetta,</i> 467 U. S., at 485).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for Forty Professors of Evidence Law by <i>Samuel R.

SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n    No. 04–1327.       Argued February 22, 2006—Decided May 1, 2006\nAt petitioner’s South Carolina trial for murder and related crimes, the\n  prosecution relied heavily on forensic evidence that strongly sup\n  ported petitioner’s guilt. Petitioner sought to undermine the State’s\n  forensic evidence by introducing expert testimony suggesting that the\n  evidence had been contaminated and that the police had engaged in a\n  plot to frame him. Petitioner also sought to introduce evidence that\n  another man, Jimmy McCaw White, had been in the victim’s\n  neighborhood on the morning of the assault and that White had ei\n  ther acknowledged petitioner’s innocence or admitted to committing\n  the crimes himself. In White’s pretrial testimony, he denied making\n  the incriminating statements and provided an alibi for the time of the\n  assault.\n     The trial court excluded petitioner’s third-party guilt evidence cit\n  ing the State Supreme Court’s Gregory decision, which held such evi\n  dence admissible if it raises a reasonable inference as to the defen\n  dant’s own innocence, but inadmissible if it merely casts a bare\n  suspicion or raises a conjectural inference as to another’s guilt. Af\n  firming the trial court, the State Supreme Court cited both Gregory\n  and its later decision in Gay, and held that where there is strong fo\n  rensic evidence of an appellant’s guilt, proffered evidence about a\n  third party’s alleged guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to\n  the appellant’s own innocence. Applying this standard, the court\n  held that petitioner could not overcome the forensic evidence against\n  him.\nHeld: A criminal defendant’s federal constitutional rights are violated\n by an evidence rule under which the defendant may not introduce\n evidence of third-party guilt if the prosecution has introduced foren\n sic evidence that, if believed, strongly supports a guilty verdict.\n “[S]tate and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Con\n2                    HOLMES v. SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    stitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials.”\n    United States v. Scheffer, 523 U. S. 303, 308. This latitude, however,\n    has limits. “Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the\n    Fourteenth Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confronta\n    tion clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees\n    criminal defendants ‘a meaningful opportunity to present a complete\n    defense.’ ” Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 690. This right is\n    abridged by evidence rules that “infring[e] upon a weighty interest of\n    the accused” and are “ ‘arbitrary’ or ‘disproportionate to the purposes\n    they are designed to serve.’ ” Scheffer, supra, at 308.\n       While the Constitution thus prohibits the exclusion of defense evi\n    dence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are dis\n    proportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote, well-\n    established rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if\n    its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as un\n    fair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the\n    jury. An application of this principle is found in rules regulating the\n    admission of evidence proffered by criminal defendants to show that\n    someone else committed the crime with which they are charged.\n    Such rules are widely accepted and are not challenged here.\n       In Gregory, the South Carolina Supreme Court adopted and ap\n    plied a rule intended to be of this type. In Gay and this case, how\n    ever, that court radically changed and extended the Gregory rule by\n    holding that, where there is strong evidence of a defendant’s guilt,\n    especially strong forensic evidence, proffered evidence about a third\n    party’s alleged guilt may (or perhaps must) be excluded. Under this\n    rule, the trial judge does not focus on the probative value or the po\n    tential adverse effects of admitting the defense evidence of third-\n    party guilt. Instead, the critical inquiry concerns the strength of the\n    prosecution’s case: If the prosecution’s case is strong enough, the evi\n    dence of third-party guilt is excluded even if that evidence, if viewed\n    independently, would have great probative value and even if it would\n    not pose an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the\n    issues. Furthermore, as applied below, the rule seems to call for lit\n    tle, if any, examination of the credibility of the prosecution’s wit\n    nesses or the reliability of its evidence.\n      By evaluating the strength of only one party’s evidence, no logical\n    conclusion can be reached regarding the strength of contrary evi\n    dence offered by the other side to rebut or cast doubt. Because the\n    rule applied below did not heed this point, the rule is “arbitrary” in\n    the sense that it does not rationally serve the end that the Gregory\n    rule and other similar third-party guilt rules were designed to fur\n    ther. Nor has the State identified any other legitimate end served by\n                     Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  the rule. Thus, the rule violates a criminal defendant’s right to have\n  “ ‘a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.’ ” Crane,\n  supra, at 690. Pp. 4–11.\n361 S. C. 333, 605 S.

SOUTH \n\n                 CAROLINA\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH\n                      CAROLINA\n                                  [May 1, 2006]\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case presents the question whether a criminal\ndefendant’s federal constitutional rights are violated by an\nevidence rule under which the defendant may not intro\nduce proof of third-party guilt if the prosecution has intro\nduced forensic evidence that, if believed, strongly supports\na guilty verdict.\n                               I\n   On the morning of December 31, 1989, 86-year-old Mary\nStewart was beaten, raped, and robbed in her home. She\nlater died of complications stemming from her injuries.\nPetitioner was convicted by a South Carolina jury of mur\nder, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, first-degree\nburglary, and robbery, and he was sentenced to death.\nState v. Holmes, 320 S. C. 259, 262, 464 S. E. 2d 334, 336\n(1995). The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed his\nconvictions and sentence, and this Court denied certiorari.\nIbid., cert. denied, 517 U. S. 1248 (1996). Upon state post-\nconviction review, however, petitioner was granted a new\ntrial. 361 S. C. 333, 335, n. 1, 605 S. E. 2d 19, 20, n. 1\n(2004).\n2               HOLMES v. SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the second trial, the prosecution relied heavily on the\nfollowing forensic evidence:\n    “(1) [Petitioner’s] palm print was found just above the\n    door knob on the interior side of the front door of the\n    victim’s house; (2) fibers consistent with a black\n    sweatshirt owned by [petitioner] were found on the\n    victim’s bed sheets; (3) matching blue fibers were\n    found on the victim’s pink nightgown and on [peti\n    tioner’s] blue jeans; (4) microscopically consistent fi\n    bers were found on the pink nightgown and on [peti\n    tioner’s] underwear; (5) [petitioner’s] underwear\n    contained a mixture of DNA from two individuals, and\n    99.99% of the population other than [petitioner] and\n    the victim were excluded as contributors to that mix\n    ture; and (6) [petitioner’s] tank top was found to con\n    tain a mixture of [petitioner’s] blood and the victim’s\n    blood.” Id., at 343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24.\nIn addition, the prosecution introduced evidence that\npetitioner had been seen near Stewart’s home within an\nhour of the time when, according to the prosecution’s\nevidence, the attack took place. Id., at 337–338, 343, 605\nS. E. 2d, at 21, 24.\n   As a major part of his defense, petitioner attempted to\nundermine the State’s forensic evidence by suggesting that\nit had been contaminated and that certain law enforce\nment officers had engaged in a plot to frame him. Id., at\n339, 605 S. E. 2d, at 22. Petitioner’s expert witnesses\ncriticized the procedures used by the police in handling the\nfiber and DNA evidence and in collecting the fingerprint\nevidence. App. 299–311, 313–323. Another defense expert\nprovided testimony that petitioner cited as supporting his\nclaim that the palm print had been planted by the police.\nId., at 326–327.\n   Petitioner also sought to introduce proof that another\nman, Jimmy McCaw White, had attacked Stewart. 361\n                   Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nS. C., at 340, 605 S. E. 2d, at 22. At a pretrial hearing,\npetitioner proffered several witnesses who placed White in\nthe victim’s neighborhood on the morning of the assault,\nas well as four other witnesses who testified that White\nhad either acknowledged that petitioner was “ ‘innocent’ ”\nor had actually admitted to committing the crimes. Id., at\n340–342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 22–23. One witness recounted\nthat when he asked White about the “word . . . on the\nstreet” that White was responsible for Stewart’s murder,\nWhite “put his head down and he raised his head back up\nand he said, well, you know I like older women.” App. 119.\nAccording to this witness, White added that “he did what\nthey say he did” and that he had “no regrets about it at\nall.” Id., at 120. Another witness, who had been incarcer\nated with White, testified that White had admitted to\nassaulting Stewart, that a police officer had asked the\nwitness to testify falsely against petitioner, and that\nemployees of the prosecutor’s office, while soliciting the\nwitness’ cooperation, had spoken of manufacturing evi\ndence against petitioner. Id., at 38–50. White testified at\nthe pretrial hearing and denied making the incriminating\nstatements. 361 S. C., at 341–342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 23. He\nalso provided an alibi for the time of the crime, but an\nother witness refuted his alibi. Id., at 342, 605 S. E. 2d, at\n23.\n    The trial court excluded petitioner’s third-party guilt\nevidence citing State v. Gregory, 198 S. C. 98, 16 S. E. 2d\n532 (1941), which held that such evidence is admissible if it\n“ ‘raise[s] a reasonable inference or presumption as to [the\ndefendant’s] own innocence’ ” but is not admissible if it\nmerely “ ‘cast[s] a bare suspicion upon another’ ” or “ ‘raise[s]\na conjectural inference as to the commission of the crime by\nanother.’ ” App. 133–134 (quoting Gregory, supra, at 104,\n16 S. E. 2d, at 534). On appeal, the South Carolina Su\npreme Court found no error in the exclusion of petitioner’s\nthird-party guilt evidence. Citing both Gregory and its\n4               HOLMES v. SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlater decision in State v. Gay, 343 S. C. 543, 541 S. E. 2d\n541 (2001), the State Supreme Court held that “where there\nis strong evidence of an appellant’s guilt, especially where\nthere is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence\nabout a third party’s alleged guilt does not raise a reason\nable inference as to the appellant’s own innocence.” 361\nS. C., at 342–343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24. Applying this stan\ndard, the court held that petitioner could not “overcome the\nforensic evidence against him to raise a reasonable infer\nence of his own innocence.” Id., at 343, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24.\nWe granted certiorari. 545 U. S. ___ (2005).\n                              II\n   “[S]tate and federal rulemakers have broad latitude\nunder the Constitution to establish rules excluding evi\ndence from criminal trials.” United States v. Scheffer, 523\nU. S. 303, 308 (1998); see also Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S.\n683, 689–690 (1986); Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U. S. 422,\n438, n. 6 (1983); Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284,\n302–303 (1973); Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 564 (1967).\nThis latitude, however, has limits. “Whether rooted di\nrectly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation\nclauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guaran\ntees criminal defendants ‘a meaningful opportunity to\npresent a complete defense.’ ” Crane, supra, at 690 (quot\ning California v. Trombetta, 467 U. S. 479, 485 (1984);\ncitations omitted). This right is abridged by evidence rules\nthat “infring[e] upon a weighty interest of the accused”\nand are “ ‘arbitrary’ or ‘disproportionate to the purposes\nthey are designed to serve.’ ” Scheffer, supra, at 308 (quot\ning Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44, 58, 56 (1987)).\n   This Court’s cases contain several illustrations of “arbi\ntrary” rules, i.e., rules that excluded important defense\nevidence but that did not serve any legitimate interests.\nIn Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14 (1967), state statutes\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbarred a person who had been charged as a participant in\na crime from testifying in defense of another alleged par\nticipant unless the witness had been acquitted. As a\nresult, when the defendant in Washington was tried for\nmurder, he was precluded from calling as a witness a\nperson who had been charged and previously convicted of\ncommitting the same murder. Holding that the defen\ndant’s right to put on a defense had been violated, we\nnoted that the rule embodied in the statutes could not\n“even be defended on the ground that it rationally sets\napart a group of persons who are particularly likely to\ncommit perjury” since the rule allowed an alleged partici\npant to testify if he or she had been acquitted or was\ncalled by the prosecution. Id., at 22–23.\n   A similar constitutional violation occurred in Chambers\nv. Mississippi, supra. A murder defendant called as a\nwitness a man named McDonald, who had previously\nconfessed to the murder. When McDonald repudiated the\nconfession on the stand, the defendant was denied permis\nsion to examine McDonald as an adverse witness based on\nthe State’s “ ‘voucher’ rule,” which barred parties from\nimpeaching their own witnesses. Id., at 294. In addition,\nbecause the state hearsay rule did not include an excep\ntion for statements against penal interest, the defendant\nwas not permitted to introduce evidence that McDonald\nhad made self-incriminating statements to three other\npersons. Noting that the State had not even attempted to\n“defend” or “explain [the] underlying rationale” of the\n“voucher rule,” id., at 297, this Court held that “the exclu\nsion of [the evidence of McDonald’s out-of-court state\nments], coupled with the State’s refusal to permit [the\ndefendant] to cross-examine McDonald, denied him a trial\nin accord with traditional and fundamental standards of\ndue process,” id., at 302.\n   Another arbitrary rule was held unconstitutional in\nCrane v. Kentucky, supra. There, the defendant was pre\n6               HOLMES v. SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nvented from attempting to show at trial that his confession\nwas unreliable because of the circumstances under which\nit was obtained, and neither the State Supreme Court nor\nthe prosecution “advanced any rational justification for\nthe wholesale exclusion of this body of potentially exculpa\ntory evidence.” Id., at 691.\n   In Rock v. Arkansas, supra, this Court held that a rule\nprohibiting hypnotically refreshed testimony was uncon\nstitutional because “[w]holesale inadmissibility of a defen\ndant’s testimony is an arbitrary restriction on the right to\ntestify in the absence of clear evidence by the State repu\ndiating the validity of all post-hypnotic recollections.” Id.,\nat 61. By contrast, in United States v. Scheffer, supra, we\nheld that a rule excluding all polygraph evidence did not\nabridge the right to present a defense because the rule\n“serve[d] several legitimate interests in the criminal trial\nprocess,” was “neither arbitrary nor disproportionate in\npromoting these ends,” and did not “implicate a suffi\nciently weighty interest of the defendant.” Id., at 309.\n   While the Constitution thus prohibits the exclusion of\ndefense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate\npurpose or that are disproportionate to the ends that they\nare asserted to promote, well-established rules of evidence\npermit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative\nvalue is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead\nthe jury. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Evid. 403; Uniform Rule of\nEvid. 45 (1953); ALI, Model Code of Evidence Rule 303\n(1942); 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence §§1863, 1904 (1904).\nPlainly referring to rules of this type, we have stated that\nthe Constitution permits judges “to exclude evidence that\nis ‘repetitive . . . , only marginally relevant’ or poses an\nundue risk of ‘harassment, prejudice, [or] confusion of the\nissues.’ ” Crane, supra, at 689–690 (quoting Delaware v.\nVan Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 679 (1986); ellipsis and brack\nets in original). See also Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U. S. 37,\n                     Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n42 (1996) (plurality opinion) (terming such rules “familiar\nand unquestionably constitutional”).\n  A specific application of this principle is found in rules\nregulating the admission of evidence proffered by criminal\ndefendants to show that someone else committed the\ncrime with which they are charged. See, e.g., 41 C. J. S.,\nHomicide §216, pp. 56–58 (1991) (“Evidence tending to\nshow the commission by another person of the crime\ncharged may be introduced by accused when it is inconsis\ntent with, and raises a reasonable doubt of, his own guilt;\nbut frequently matters offered in evidence for this purpose\nare so remote and lack such connection with the crime\nthat they are excluded”); 40A Am. Jur. 2d, Homicide §286,\npp. 136–138 (1999) (“[T]he accused may introduce any\nlegal evidence tending to prove that another person may\nhave committed the crime with which the defendant is\ncharged . . . . [Such evidence] may be excluded where it\ndoes not sufficiently connect the other person to the crime,\nas, for example, where the evidence is speculative or re\nmote, or does not tend to prove or disprove a material fact\nin issue at the defendant’s trial” (footnotes omitted)).\nSuch rules are widely accepted,* and neither petitioner\n——————\n  * See, e.g., Smithart v.

E. 2d, at 545 (quoting Gregory, supra, at 104,\n16 S. E. 2d, at 534, in turn quoting 16 C. J., §1085, at 560).\nSimilarly, in the present case, as noted, the State Supreme\nCourt applied the rule that “where there is strong evi\ndence of [a defendant’s] guilt, especially where there is\nstrong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a\nthird party’s alleged guilt” may (or perhaps must) be\nexcluded. 361 S. C., at 342, 605 S. E. 2d, at 24.\n   Under this rule, the trial judge does not focus on the\nprobative value or the potential adverse effects of admit\nting the defense evidence of third-party guilt. Instead, the\ncritical inquiry concerns the strength of the prosecution’s\ncase: If the prosecution’s case is strong enough, the evi\ndence of third-party guilt is excluded even if that evidence,\nif viewed independently, would have great probative value\nand even if it would not pose an undue risk of harassment,\nprejudice, or confusion of the issues.\n   Furthermore, as applied in this case, the South Carolina\nSupreme Court’s rule seems to call for little, if any, exami\nnation of the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses or\nthe reliability of its evidence. Here, for example, the de\nfense strenuously claimed that the prosecution’s forensic\nevidence was so unreliable (due to mishandling and a\ndeliberate plot to frame petitioner) that the evidence\nshould not have even been admitted. The South Carolina\nSupreme Court responded that these challenges did not\nentirely “eviscerate” the forensic evidence and that the\ndefense challenges went to the weight and not to the ad\nmissibility of that evidence. Id., at 343, n. 8, 605 S. E. 2d,\nat 24, n. 8. Yet, in evaluating the prosecution’s forensic\nevidence and deeming it to be “strong”—and thereby justi\nfying exclusion of petitioner’s third-party guilt evidence—\nthe South Carolina Supreme Court made no mention of the\ndefense challenges to the prosecution’s evidence.\n   Interpreted in this way, the rule applied by the State\nSupreme Court does not rationally serve the end that the\n10              HOLMES v. SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGregory rule and its analogues in other jurisdictions were\ndesigned to promote, i.e., to focus the trial on the central\nissues by excluding evidence that has only a very weak\nlogical connection to the central issues. The rule applied\nin this case appears to be based on the following logic:\nWhere (1) it is clear that only one person was involved in\nthe commission of a particular crime and (2) there is\nstrong evidence that the defendant was the perpetrator, it\nfollows that evidence of third-party guilt must be weak.\nBut this logic depends on an accurate evaluation of the\nprosecution’s proof, and the true strength of the prosecu\ntion’s proof cannot be assessed without considering chal\nlenges to the reliability of the prosecution’s evidence. Just\nbecause the prosecution’s evidence, if credited, would\nprovide strong support for a guilty verdict, it does not\nfollow that evidence of third-party guilt has only a weak\nlogical connection to the central issues in the case. And\nwhere the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses or the\nreliability of its evidence is not conceded, the strength of\nthe prosecution’s case cannot be assessed without making\nthe sort of factual findings that have traditionally been\nreserved for the trier of fact and that the South Carolina\ncourts did not purport to make in this case.\n   The rule applied in this case is no more logical than its\nconverse would be, i.e., a rule barring the prosecution from\nintroducing evidence of a defendant’s guilt if the defendant\nis able to proffer, at a pretrial hearing, evidence that, if\nbelieved, strongly supports a verdict of not guilty. In the\npresent case, for example, the petitioner proffered evi\ndence that, if believed, squarely proved that White, not\npetitioner, was the perpetrator. It would make no sense,\nhowever, to hold that this proffer precluded the prosecu\ntion from introducing its evidence, including the forensic\nevidence that, if credited, provided strong proof of the\npetitioner’s guilt.\n   The point is that, by evaluating the strength of only one\n                  Cite as: 547 U.

Because the rule applied\nby the State Supreme Court in this case did not heed this\npoint, the rule is “arbitrary” in the sense that it does not\nrationally serve the end that the Gregory rule and other\nsimilar third-party guilt rules were designed to further.\nNor has the State identified any other legitimate end that\nthe rule serves. It follows that the rule applied in this case\nby the State Supreme Court violates a criminal defendant’s\nright to have “ ‘a meaningful opportunity to present a com\nplete defense.’ ” Crane, 476 U. S., at 690 (quoting Trom\nbetta, 467 U.
