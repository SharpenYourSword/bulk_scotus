S. C. § 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The respondents, Michelle Thomas and her immediate family, applied for asylum. They checked boxes on the application form that indicated their claim rested upon fear of persecution in their native South Africa because of (1) their \"political opinion[s],\" and (2) their \"membership in a particular social group.\" In proceedings before the Immigration Judge, they emphasized their fear of persecution because of their race (they are white) and their kinship with Michelle's father-in-law, \"Boss Ronnie,\" a white South African who allegedly held racist views and mistreated black workers at the company at which he was a foreman. The Immigration Judge, focusing upon questions of race and political views, rejected their claim. And the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), responding to the Thomases' primarily race-related arguments, summarily affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p>On review, a Ninth Circuit panel held by a 2-to-1 vote that the BIA had not adequately considered the Thomases' claim of persecution because of \"membership in a particular social group, as relatives of Boss Ronnie.\" <i>Thomas</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 359 F. 3d 1169, 1177 (2004). The Ninth Circuit took the matter en banc.

The dissenting judges argued that the question \"whether the Thomases <i>are</i> a `particular social group'\" should first be considered by the relevant administrative agency. <i>Id.,</i> at 1193 (opinion of Rymer, J.)

Applying these \"basic legal principles,\" we concluded that \"every consideration that classically supports the law's ordinary remand requirement does so here.\" <i>Ventura,</i> 537 U.

Decided April 17, 2006 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the\nAttorney General to grant an alien asylum if the alien\ncannot return to another country because of “persecution\nor a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race,\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social\ngroup, or political opinion.” §101(a)(42)(A), as added, §201,\n94 Stat. 102, 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added).\nThe respondents, Michelle Thomas and her immediate\nfamily, applied for asylum. They checked boxes on the\napplication form that indicated their claim rested upon\nfear of persecution in their native South Africa because of\n(1) their “political opinion[s],” and (2) their “membership\nin a particular social group.” In proceedings before the\nImmigration Judge, they emphasized their fear of persecu\ntion because of their race (they are white) and their kin\nship with Michelle’s father-in-law, “Boss Ronnie,” a white\nSouth African who allegedly held racist views and mis\ntreated black workers at the company at which he was a\nforeman. The Immigration Judge, focusing upon ques\ntions of race and political views, rejected their claim. And\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), responding to the\nThomases’ primarily race-related arguments, summarily\naffirmed that decision.\n   On review, a Ninth Circuit panel held by a 2-to-1 vote\nthat the Board had not adequately considered the\nThomases’ claim of persecution because of “membership in\na particular social group, as relatives of Boss Ronnie.”\n2                    GONZALES v. THOMAS\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nThomas v. Ashcroft, 359 F. 3d 1169, 1177 (2004). The\nNinth Circuit took the matter en banc. The en banc court,\noverruling what it considered aberrant contrary Circuit\nprecedent, unanimously held that in principle “a family\nmay constitute a social group for the purposes of the refu\ngee statutes.” 409 F. 3d 1177, 1187 (2005) (en banc) (em\nphasis added) (overruling, inter alia, Estrada-Posadas v.\nINS, 924 F. 2d 916 (CA9 1991)). In so doing, the court\nrelied on earlier BIA opinions holding that certain “kin\nship ties” fall within the statutory term. See id., at 1180,\n1184-1186.\n   The court then went on to hold, over the dissent of four\njudges, that the particular family at issue, namely “ ‘per\nsons related to Boss Ronnie,’ ” fell within the scope of the\nstatutory term “particular social group” and that the\n“Thomases were attacked and threatened because they\nbelonged to the particular social group of ‘persons related\nto Boss Ronnie’ . . . .” 409 F. 3d, at 1189. The dissenting\njudges argued that the question “whether the Thomases\nare a ‘particular social group’ ” should first be considered\nby the relevant administrative agency. Id., at 1193 (opin\nion of Rymer, J.) (emphasis in original). And they said\nthat the majority’s contrary decision was inconsistent with\nthis Court’s holding in INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U. S.\n12, 18 (2002) (per curiam).\n   The Solicitor General now asks us to grant certiorari to\nconsider whether the Ninth Circuit “erred in holding, in\nthe first instance and without prior resolution of the ques\ntions by the” relevant administrative agency, “that mem\nbers of a family can and do constitute a ‘particular social\ngroup’ within the meaning of” the Act. Pet. for Cert. I. He\nargues that a court’s role in an immigration case is typi\ncally one of “ ‘review, not of first view.’ ” Id., at 29 (quoting\nCutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.

And he con\ncludes that “the Ninth Circuit’s error is so obvious in light\nof Ventura that summary reversal would be appropriate.”\nPet. for Cert. 29.\n    We agree with the Solicitor General. The Ninth Cir\ncuit’s failure to remand is legally erroneous, and that error\nis “obvious in light of Ventura,” itself a summary reversal.\n    The alien in Ventura sought asylum on grounds of a\nreasonable fear of “persecution” in Guatemala “ ‘on ac\ncount of . . . [a] political opinion.’ ” 537 U. S., at 13. The\nBIA held that the alien did not qualify for asylum be\ncause whatever persecution he faced when he left Gua\ntemala in 1993 was not on account of a “ ‘political opin\nion.’ ” Ibid. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the\nrecord showed that in 1993 the alien did indeed face\npolitically based persecution in Guatemala. The Circuit\nthen went on to consider the Government’s alternative\nargument—that, in any event, conditions within Guate\nmala had improved to the point that political persecution\nwas no longer likely. Ibid. And the Circuit rejected this\n“ ‘changed circumstances’ ” claim without first giving the\nagency an opportunity to consider the matter. Id., at 14.\n    We reversed the Ninth Circuit summarily. We pointed\nout that “[w]ithin broad limits the law entrusts the agency\nto make the basic asylum eligibility decision.” Id., at 16.\n“In such circumstances,” we added, a “ ‘judicial judgment\ncannot be made to do service for an administrative judg\nment.’ ” Ibid. (quoting SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80,\n88 (1943)). “A court of appeals ‘is not generally empowered\nto conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being re\nviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an\ninquiry.’ ” Ventura, supra, at 16 (quoting Florida Power &\nLight Co. v. Lorion, 470 U. S. 729, 744 (1985)). “Rather,\n‘the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to\nremand to the agency for additional investigation or ex\nplanation.’ ” Ventura, supra, at 16 (quoting Florida Power\n4                  GONZALES v.

Applying these “basic legal\nprinciples,” we concluded that “every consideration that\nclassically supports the law’s ordinary remand require\nment does so here.” Ventura, 537 U. S., at 16, 17.\n  We must reach the same conclusion in the present case.\nThe agency has not yet considered whether Boss Ronnie’s\nfamily presents the kind of “kinship ties” that constitute a\n“particular social group.” The matter requires determin\ning the facts and deciding whether the facts as found fall\nwithin a statutory term. And as we said in Ventura:\n    “The agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the\n    matter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an\n    initial determination; and, in doing so, it can, through\n    informed discussion and analysis, help a court later\n    determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway\n    that the law provides.” Id., at 17.\n  We can find no special circumstance here that might\nhave justified the Ninth Circuit’s determination of the\nmatter in the first instance. Thus, as in Ventura, the\nCourt of Appeals should have applied the “ordinary ‘re\nmand’ rule.” Id., at 18.\n  We grant the petition for certiorari. We vacate the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals.
