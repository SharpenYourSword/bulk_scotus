No. 2</i> v. <i>Hyde,</i> 466 U. S. 2 (1984), we repeated the well-settled proposition that \"if the Government has granted the seller a patent or similar monopoly over a product, it is fair to presume that the inability to buy the product elsewhere gives the seller market power.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 16. This presumption of market power, applicable in the antitrust context when a seller conditions its sale of a patented product (the \"tying\" product) on the purchase of a second product (the \"tied\" product), has its foundation in the judicially created patent misuse doctrine. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Loew's Inc.,</i> 371 U. S. 38, 46 (1962). In 1988, Congress substantially undermined that foundation, amending the Patent Act to eliminate the market power presumption in patent misuse cases. See 102 Stat. 4676, codified at 35 U. S. C. § 271(d). The question presented to us today is whether the presumption of market power in a patented product should survive as a matter of antitrust law despite its demise in patent law. We conclude that the mere fact that a tying product is patented does not support such a presumption.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioners, Trident, Inc., and its parent, Illinois Tool Works Inc., manufacture and market printing systems that include three relevant components: (1) a patented piezoelectric impulse ink jet printhead; (2) a patented ink container, consisting of a bottle and valved cap, which attaches to the printhead; and (3) specially designed, but unpatented, ink. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> Petitioners sell their systems to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are licensed to incorporate the printheads and containers into printers that are in turn sold to companies for use in printing barcodes on cartons and packaging materials. The OEMs agree that they will purchase their ink exclusively from petitioners, and that neither they nor their customers will refill the patented containers with ink of any kind.</p>\n<p>Respondent, Independent Ink, Inc., has developed an ink with the same chemical composition as the ink sold by petitioners. After an infringement action brought by Trident against Independent was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, Independent filed suit against Trident seeking a judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of Trident's patents.<sup>[1]</sup> In an amended complaint, it alleged that petitioners are engaged in illegal tying and monopolization in violation of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. 15 U. S. C. §§ 1, 2.</p>\n<p>After discovery, the District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment on the Sherman Act claims. <i>Independent Ink, Inc.</i> v. <i>Trident, Inc.,</i> 210 F. Supp. 2d 1155, 1177 (CD Cal. 2002). It rejected respondent's submission that petitioners \"necessarily have market power in the market for the tying product as a matter of law solely by virtue of the patent on their printhead system, thereby rendering [the] tying arrangements <i>per se</i> violations of the antitrust laws.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1159. Finding that respondent had submitted no affirmative evidence defining the relevant market or establishing petitioners' power within it, the court concluded that respondent could not prevail on either antitrust claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 1167, 1173, 1177. The parties settled their other claims, and respondent appealed.</p>\n<p>After a careful review of the \"long history of Supreme Court consideration of the legality of tying arrangements,\" 396 F. 3d 1342, 1346 (2005), the Court of Appeals for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> Federal Circuit reversed the District Court's decision as to respondent's § 1 claim, <i>id.,</i> at 1354. Placing special reliance on our decisions in <i>International Salt Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 332 U. S. 392 (1947), and <i>Loew's,</i> 371 U. S. 38, as well as our <i>Jefferson Parish</i> dictum, and after taking note of the academic criticism of those cases, it concluded that the \"fundamental error\" in petitioners' submission was its disregard of \"the duty of a court of appeals to follow the precedents of the Supreme Court until the Court itself chooses to expressly overrule them.\" 396 F. 3d, at 1351. We granted certiorari to undertake a fresh examination of the history of both the judicial and legislative appraisals of tying arrangements. 545 U. S. 1127 (2005). Our review is informed by extensive scholarly comment and a change in position by the administrative agencies charged with enforcement of the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>American courts first encountered tying arrangements in the course of patent infringement litigation. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co.</i> v. <i>Eureka Specialty Co.,</i> 77 F. 288 (CA6 1896). Such a case came before this Court in <i>Henry</i> v. <i>A. B. Dick Co.,</i> 224 U. S. 1 (1912), in which, as in the case we decide today, unpatented ink was the product that was \"tied\" to the use of a patented product through the use of a licensing agreement. Without commenting on the tying arrangement, the Court held that use of a competitor's ink in violation of a condition of the agreementthat the rotary mimeograph \"`may be used only with the stencil, paper, ink and other supplies made by A. B. Dick Co.'\"constituted infringement of the patent on the machine. <i>Id.,</i> at 25-26. Chief Justice White dissented, explaining his disagreement with the Court's approval of a practice that he regarded as an \"attempt to increase the scope of the monopoly granted by a patent ... which tend[s] to increase monopoly and to burden the public in the exercise of their common rights.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 70. Two years later, Congress <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> endorsed Chief Justice White's disapproval of tying arrangements, enacting § 3 of the Clayton Act. See 38 Stat. 731 (applying to \"patented or unpatented\" products); see also <i>Motion Picture Patents Co.</i> v. <i>Universal Film Mfg. Co.,</i> 243 U. S. 502, 517-518 (1917) (explaining that, in light of § 3 of the Clayton Act, <i>A. B. Dick</i> \"must be regarded as overruled\"). And in this Court's subsequent cases reviewing the legality of tying arrangements we, too, embraced Chief Justice White's disapproval of those arrangements. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Standard Oil Co. of Cal.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 337 U. S. 293, 305-306 (1949); <i>Mercoid Corp.</i> v. <i>Mid-Continent Investment Co.,</i> 320 U. S. 661, 664-665 (1944).</p>\n<p>In the years since <i>A. B. Dick,</i> four different rules of law have supported challenges to tying arrangements. They have been condemned as improper extensions of the patent monopoly under the patent misuse doctrine, as unfair methods of competition under § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U. S. C. § 45, as contracts tending to create a monopoly under § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 14, and as contracts in restraint of trade under § 1 of the Sherman Act.<sup>[2]</sup> In all of those instances, the justification for the challenge rested on either an assumption or a showing that the defendant's position of power in the market for the tying product was being used to restrain competition in the market for the tied product. As we explained in <i>Jefferson Parish,</i> 466 U. S., at 12, \"[o]ur cases have concluded that the essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms.\"</p>\n<p>Over the years, however, this Court's strong disapproval of tying arrangements has substantially diminished. Rather than relying on assumptions, in its more recent opinions the Court has required a showing of market power in the tying product. Our early opinions consistently assumed that \"[t]ying arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition.\" <i>Standard Oil Co.,</i> 337 U. S., at 305-306. In 1962, in <i>Loew's,</i> 371 U. S., at 47-48, the Court relied on this assumption despite evidence of significant competition in the market for the tying product. And as recently as 1969, Justice Black, writing for the majority, relied on the assumption as support for the proposition \"that, at least when certain prerequisites are met, arrangements of this kind are illegal in and of themselves, and no specific showing of unreasonable competitive effect is required.\" <i>Fortner Enterprises, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States Steel Corp.,</i> 394 U. S. 495, 498-499 <i>(Fortner I)</i><i>.</i> Explaining the Court's decision to allow the suit to proceed to trial, he stated that \"decisions rejecting the need for proof of truly dominant power over the tying product have all been based on a recognition that because tying arrangements generally serve no legitimate business purpose that cannot be achieved in some less restrictive way, the presence of any appreciable restraint on competition provides a sufficient reason for invalidating the tie.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 503.</p>\n<p>Reflecting a changing view of tying arrangements, four Justices dissented in <i>Fortner I,</i> arguing that the challenged \"tie\"the extension of a $2 million line of credit on condition that the borrower purchase prefabricated houses from the defendantmight well have served a legitimate purpose. <i>Id.,</i> at 510 (opinion of White, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 520 (opinion of Fortas, J.). In his opinion, Justice White noted that promotional tie-ins may provide \"uniquely advantageous deals\" to purchasers. <i>Id.,</i> at 519. And Justice Fortas concluded that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> arrangement was best characterized as \"a sale of a single product with the incidental provision of financing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 522.</p>\n<p>The dissenters' view that tying arrangements may well be procompetitive ultimately prevailed; indeed, it did so in the very same lawsuit. After the Court remanded the suit in <i>Fortner I,</i> a bench trial resulted in judgment for the plaintiff, and the case eventually made its way back to this Court. Upon return, we unanimously held that the plaintiff's failure of proof on the issue of market power was fatal to its case the plaintiff had proved \"nothing more than a willingness to provide cheap financing in order to sell expensive houses.\" <i>United States Steel Corp.</i> v. <i>Fortner Enterprises, Inc.,</i> 429 U. S. 610, 622 (1977) <i>(Fortner II)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>The assumption that \"[t]ying arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition,\" rejected in <i>Fortner II,</i> has not been endorsed in any opinion since. Instead, it was again rejected just seven years later in <i>Jefferson Parish,</i> where, as in <i>Fortner II,</i> we unanimously reversed a Court of Appeals judgment holding that an alleged tying arrangement constituted a <i>per se</i> violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. 466 U. S., at 5. Like the product at issue in the <i>Fortner</i> cases, the tying product in <i>Jefferson Parish</i>hospital serviceswas unpatented, and our holding again rested on the conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to prove sufficient power in the tying product market to restrain competition in the market for the tied productservices of anesthesiologists. 466 U. S., at 28-29.</p>\n<p>In rejecting the application of a <i>per se</i> rule that all tying arrangements constitute antitrust violations, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]e have condemned tying arrangements when the seller has some special abilityusually called `market power'to force a purchaser to do something that he would not do in a competitive market....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>... . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> \"<i>Per se</i> condemnationcondemnation without inquiry into actual market conditionsis only appropriate if the existence of forcing is probable. Thus, application of the <i>per se</i> rule focuses on the probability of anticompetitive consequences....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"For example, if the Government has granted the seller a patent or similar monopoly over a product, it is fair to presume that the inability to buy the product elsewhere gives the seller market power. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Loew's Inc.,</i> 371 U. S., at 45-47. Any effort to enlarge the scope of the patent monopoly by using the market power it confers to restrain competition in the market for a second product will undermine competition on the merits in that second market. Thus, the sale or lease of a patented item on condition that the buyer make all his purchases of a separate tied product from the patentee is unlawful.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 13-16 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Notably, nothing in our opinion suggested a rebuttable presumption of market power applicable to tying arrangements involving a patent on the tying good. See <i>infra,</i> at 44; cf. 396 F. 3d, at 1352. Instead, it described the rule that a contract to sell a patented product on condition that the purchaser buy unpatented goods exclusively from the patentee is a <i>per se</i> violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>Justice O'Connor wrote separately in <i>Jefferson Parish,</i> concurring in the judgment on the ground that the case did not involve a true tying arrangement because, in her view, surgical services and anesthesia were not separate products. 466 U. S., at 43. In her opinion, she questioned not only the propriety of treating any tying arrangement as a <i>per se</i> violation of the Sherman Act, <i>id.,</i> at 35, but also the validity of the presumption that a patent always gives the patentee significant market power, observing that the presumption was actually a product of our patent misuse cases rather than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> our antitrust jurisprudence, <i>id.,</i> at 37-38, n. 7. It is that presumption, a vestige of the Court's historical distrust of tying arrangements, that we address squarely today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Justice O'Connor was, of course, correct in her assertion that the presumption that a patent confers market power arose outside the antitrust context as part of the patent misuse doctrine. That doctrine had its origins in <i>Motion Picture Patents Co.</i> v. <i>Universal Film Mfg. Co.,</i> 243 U. S. 502 (1917), which found no support in the patent laws for the proposition that a patentee may \"prescribe by notice attached to a patented machine the conditions of its use and the supplies which must be used in the operation of it, under pain of infringement of the patent,\" <i>id.,</i> at 509. Although <i>Motion Picture Patents Co.</i> simply narrowed the scope of possible patent infringement claims, it formed the basis for the Court's subsequent decisions creating a patent misuse defense to infringement claims when a patentee uses its patent \"as the effective means of restraining competition with its sale of an unpatented article.\" <i>Morton Salt Co.</i> v. <i>G. S. Suppiger Co.,</i> 314 U. S. 488, 490 (1942); see also, <i>e. g., </i><i>Carbice Corp. of America</i> v. <i>American Patents Development Corp.,</i> 283 U. S. 27, 31 (1931).</p>\n<p>Without any analysis of actual market conditions, these patent misuse decisions assumed that, by tying the purchase of unpatented goods to the sale of the patented good, the patentee was \"restraining competition,\" <i>Morton Salt,</i> 314 U. S., at 490, or \"secur[ing] a limited monopoly of an unpatented material,\" <i>Mercoid,</i> 320 U. S., at 664; see also <i>Carbice,</i> 283 U. S., at 31-32. In other words, these decisions presumed \"[t]he requisite economic power\" over the tying product such that the patentee could \"extend [its] economic control to unpatented products.\" <i>Loew's,</i> 371 U. S., at 45-46.</p>\n<p>The presumption that a patent confers market power migrated from patent law to antitrust law in <i>International</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> <i>Salt Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 332 U. S. 392 (1947). In that case, we affirmed a District Court decision holding that leases of patented machines requiring the lessees to use the defendant's unpatented salt products violated § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act as a matter of law. <i>Id.,</i> at 396. Although the Court's opinion does not discuss market power or the patent misuse doctrine, it assumes that \"[t]he volume of business affected by these contracts cannot be said to be insignificant or insubstantial and the tendency of the arrangement to accomplishment of monopoly seems obvious.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The assumption that tying contracts \"ten[d] ... to accomplishment of monopoly\" can be traced to the Government's brief in <i>International Salt,</i> which relied heavily on our earlier patent misuse decision in <i>Morton Salt.</i> The Government described <i>Morton Salt</i> as \"present[ing] a factual situation almost identical with the instant case,\" and it asserted that \"although the Court in that case did not find it necessary to decide whether the antitrust laws were violated, its language, its reasoning, and its citations indicate that the policy underlying the decision was the same as that of the Sherman Act.\" Brief for United States in <i>International Salt Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1947, No. 46, p. 19 (United States Brief). Building on its assertion that <i>International Salt</i> was logically indistinguishable from <i>Morton Salt,</i> the Government argued that this Court should place tying arrangements involving patented products in the category of <i>per se</i> violations of the Sherman Act. United States Brief 26-33.</p>\n<p>Our opinion in <i>International Salt</i> clearly shows that we accepted the Government's invitation to import the presumption of market power in a patented product into our antitrust jurisprudence. While we cited <i>Morton Salt</i> only for the narrower proposition that the defendant's patents did not confer any right to restrain competition in unpatented salt or afford the defendant any immunity from the antitrust laws, <i>International Salt,</i> 332 U. S., at 395-396, given the fact that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> the defendant was selling its unpatented salt at competitive prices, <i>id.,</i> at 396-397, the rule adopted in <i>International Salt</i> necessarily accepted the Government's submission that the earlier patent misuse cases supported the broader proposition \"that this type of restraint is unlawful on its face under the Sherman Act,\" United States Brief 12.</p>\n<p>Indeed, later in the same Term we cited <i>International Salt</i> for the proposition that the license of \"a patented device on condition that unpatented materials be employed in conjunction with the patented device\" is an example of a restraint that is \"illegal <i>per se.</i>\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Columbia Steel Co.,</i> 334 U. S. 495, 522-523, and n. 22 (1948). And in subsequent cases we have repeatedly grounded the presumption of market power over a patented device in <i>International Salt.</i> See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Loew's,</i> 371 U. S., at 45-46; <i>Times-Picayune Publishing Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 345 U. S. 594, 608 (1953); <i>Standard Oil Co.,</i> 337 U. S., at 304.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Although the patent misuse doctrine and our antitrust jurisprudence became intertwined in <i>International Salt,</i> subsequent events initiated their untwining. This process has ultimately led to today's reexamination of the presumption of <i>per se</i> illegality of a tying arrangement involving a patented product, the first case since 1947 in which we have granted review to consider the presumption's continuing validity.</p>\n<p>Three years before we decided <i>International Salt,</i> this Court had expanded the scope of the patent misuse doctrine to include not only supplies or materials used by a patented device, but also tying arrangements involving a combination patent and \"unpatented material or [a] device [that] is itself an integral part of the structure embodying the patent.\" <i>Mercoid,</i> 320 U. S., at 665; see also <i>Dawson Chemical Co.</i> v. <i>Rohm &amp; Haas Co.,</i> 448 U. S. 176, 188-198 (1980) (describing in detail <i>Mercoid</i> and the cases leading up to it). In reaching this conclusion, the Court explained that it could see \"no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> difference in principle\" between cases involving elements essential to the inventive character of the patent and elements peripheral to it; both, in the Court's view, were attempts to \"expan[d] the patent beyond the legitimate scope of its monopoly.\" <i>Mercoid,</i> 320 U. S., at 665.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, Congress codified the patent laws for the first time. See 66 Stat. 792, codified at 35 U. S. C. § 1 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. III). At least partly in response to our <i>Mercoid</i> decision, Congress included a provision in its codification that excluded some conduct, such as a tying arrangement involving the sale of a patented product tied to an \"essential\" or \"nonstaple\" product that has no use except as part of the patented product or method, from the scope of the patent misuse doctrine. § 271(d); see also <i>Dawson,</i> 448 U. S., at 214. Thus, at the same time that our antitrust jurisprudence continued to rely on the assumption that \"tying arrangements generally serve no legitimate business purpose,\" <i>Fortner I,</i> 394 U. S., at 503, Congress began chipping away at the assumption in the patent misuse context from whence it came.</p>\n<p>It is Congress' most recent narrowing of the patent misuse defense, however, that is directly relevant to this case. Four years after our decision in <i>Jefferson Parish</i> repeated the patent-equals-market-power presumption, 466 U. S., at 16, Congress amended the Patent Code to eliminate that presumption in the patent misuse context, 102 Stat. 4676. The relevant provision reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement or contributory infringement of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his having done one or more of the following: ... (5) conditioned the license of any rights to the patent or the sale of the patented product on the acquisition of a license to rights in another patent or purchase of a separate product, <i>unless, in view of the circumstances, the patent owner has</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> <i>market power in the relevant market for the patent or patented product on which the license or sale is conditioned.</i>\" 35 U. S. C. § 271(d)(5) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The italicized clause makes it clear that Congress did not intend the mere existence of a patent to constitute the requisite \"market power.\" Indeed, fairly read, it provides that without proof that Trident had market power in the relevant market, its conduct at issue in this case was neither \"misuse\" nor an \"illegal extension of the patent right.\"</p>\n<p>While the 1988 amendment does not expressly refer to the antitrust laws, it certainly invites a reappraisal of the <i>per se</i> rule announced in <i>International Salt.</i><sup>[3]</sup> A rule denying a patentee the right to enjoin an infringer is significantly less severe than a rule that makes the conduct at issue a federal crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. See 15 U. S. C. § 1. It would be absurd to assume that Congress intended to provide that the use of a patent that merited punishment as a felony would not constitute \"misuse.\" Moreover, given the fact that the patent misuse doctrine provided the basis for the market power presumption, it would be anomalous to preserve the presumption in antitrust after Congress has eliminated its foundation. Cf. 10 P. Areeda, H. Hovenkamp, &amp; E. Elhauge, Antitrust Law ¶ 1737c (2d ed. 2004) (hereinafter Areeda).</p>\n<p>After considering the congressional judgment reflected in the 1988 amendment, we conclude that tying arrangements involving patented products should be evaluated under the standards applied in cases like <i>Fortner II</i> and <i>Jefferson Parish</i> rather than under the <i>per se</i> rule applied in <i>Morton Salt</i> and <i>Loew's.</i> While some such arrangements are still unlawful, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> such as those that are the product of a true monopoly or a marketwide conspiracy, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Paramount Pictures, Inc.,</i> 334 U. S. 131, 145-146 (1948), that conclusion must be supported by proof of power in the relevant market rather than by a mere presumption thereof.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Rather than arguing that we should retain the rule of <i>per se</i> illegality, respondent contends that we should endorse a rebuttable presumption that patentees possess market power when they condition the purchase of the patented product on an agreement to buy unpatented goods exclusively from the patentee. Cf. <i>supra,</i> at 37-38. Respondent recognizes that a large number of valid patents have little, if any, commercial significance, but submits that those that are used to impose tying arrangements on unwilling purchasers likely do exert significant market power. Hence, in respondent's view, the presumption would have no impact on patents of only slight value and would be justified, subject to being rebutted by evidence offered by the patentee, in cases in which the patent has sufficient value to enable the patentee to insist on acceptance of the tie.</p>\n<p>Respondent also offers a narrower alternative, suggesting that we differentiate between tying arrangements involving the simultaneous purchase of two products that are arguably two components of a single productsuch as the provision of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> surgical services and anesthesiology in the same operation, <i>Jefferson Parish,</i> 466 U. S., at 43 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), or the licensing of one copyrighted film on condition that the licensee take a package of several films in the same transaction, <i>Loew's,</i> 371 U. S. 38and a tying arrangement involving the purchase of unpatented goods over a period of time, a so-called \"requirements tie.\" See also Brief for Barry Nalebuff et al. as <i>Amici Curiae.</i> According to respondent, we should recognize a presumption of market power when faced with the latter type of arrangements because they provide a means for charging large volume purchasers a higher royalty for use of the patent than small purchasers must pay, a form of discrimination that \"is strong evidence of market power.\" Brief for Respondent 27; see generally <i>Jefferson Parish,</i> 466 U. S., at 15, n. 23 (discussing price discrimination of this sort and citing sources).</p>\n<p>The opinion that imported the \"patent equals market power\" presumption into our antitrust jurisprudence, however, provides no support for respondent's proposed alternative. In <i>International Salt,</i> it was the existence of the patent on the tying product, rather than the use of a requirements tie, that led the Court to presume market power. 332 U. S., at 395 (\"The appellant's patents confer a limited monopoly of the invention they reward\"). Moreover, the requirements tie in that case did not involve any price discrimination between large volume and small volume purchasers or evidence of noncompetitive pricing. Instead, the leases at issue provided that if any competitor offered salt, the tied product, at a lower price, \"the lessee should be free to buy in the open market, unless appellant would furnish the salt at an equal price.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 396.</p>\n<p>As we have already noted, the vast majority of academic literature recognizes that a patent does not necessarily confer market power. See n. 4, <i>supra.</i> Similarly, while price discrimination may provide evidence of market power, particularly if buttressed by evidence that the patentee has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> charged an above-market price for the tied package, see, <i>e. g.,</i> 10 Areeda ¶ 1769c, it is generally recognized that it also occurs in fully competitive markets, see, <i>e. g.,</i> Baumol &amp; Swanson, The New Economy and Ubiquitous Competitive Price Discrimination: Identifying Defensible Criteria of Market Power, 70 Antitrust L. J. 661, 666 (2003); 9 Areeda ¶ 1711; Landes &amp; Posner 374-375. We are not persuaded that the combination of these two factors should give rise to a presumption of market power when neither is sufficient to do so standing alone. Rather, the lesson to be learned from <i>International Salt</i> and the academic commentary is the same: Many tying arrangements, even those involving patents and requirements ties, are fully consistent with a free, competitive market. For this reason, we reject both respondent's proposed rebuttable presumption and their narrower alternative.</p>\n<p>It is no doubt the virtual consensus among economists that has persuaded the enforcement agencies to reject the position that the Government took when it supported the <i>per se</i> rule that the Court adopted in the 1940's. See <i>supra,</i> at 39. In antitrust guidelines issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in 1995, the enforcement agencies stated that in the exercise of their prosecutorial discretion they \"will not presume that a patent, copyright, or trade secret necessarily confers market power upon its owner.\" U. S. Dept. of Justice and FTC, Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property § 2.2 (Apr. 6, 1995), http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/guidelines/0558.pdf (as visited Feb. 24, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). While that choice is not binding on the Court, it would be unusual for the Judiciary to replace the normal rule of lenity that is applied in criminal cases with a rule of severity for a special category of antitrust cases.</p>\n<p>Congress, the antitrust enforcement agencies, and most economists have all reached the conclusion that a patent does not necessarily confer market power upon the patentee. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> Today, we reach the same conclusion, and therefore hold that, in all cases involving a tying arrangement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant has market power in the tying product.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>In this case, respondent reasonably relied on our prior opinions in moving for summary judgment without offering evidence defining the relevant market or proving that petitioners possess power within it. When the case returns to the District Court, respondent should therefore be given a fair opportunity to develop and introduce evidence on that issue, as well as any other issues that are relevant to its remaining § 1 claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the American Bar Association by <i>Robert J.

O'Connor.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In <i>Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2</i> v. <i>Hyde,</i> 466 U. S. 2 (1984), we repeated the well-settled proposition that \"if the Government has granted the seller a patent or similar monopoly over a product, it is fair to presume that the inability to buy the product elsewhere gives the seller market power.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 16. This presumption of market power, applicable in the antitrust context when a seller conditions its sale of a patented product (the \"tying\" product) on the purchase of a second product (the \"tied\" product), has its foundation in the judicially created patent misuse doctrine. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Loew's Inc.,</i> 371 U. S. 38, 46 (1962). In 1988, Congress substantially undermined that foundation, amending the Patent Act to eliminate the market power presumption in patent misuse cases. See 102 Stat. 4676, codified at 35 U. S. C. § 271(d). The question presented to us today is whether the presumption of market power in a patented product should survive as a matter of antitrust law despite its demise in patent law. We conclude that the mere fact that a tying product is patented does not support such a presumption.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioners, Trident, Inc., and its parent, Illinois Tool Works Inc., manufacture and market printing systems that include three relevant components: (1) a patented piezoelectric impulse ink jet printhead; (2) a patented ink container, consisting of a bottle and valved cap, which attaches to the printhead; and (3) specially designed, but unpatented, ink. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> Petitioners sell their systems to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are licensed to incorporate the printheads and containers into printers that are in turn sold to companies for use in printing barcodes on cartons and packaging materials. The OEMs agree that they will purchase their ink exclusively from petitioners, and that neither they nor their customers will refill the patented containers with ink of any kind.</p>\n<p>Respondent, Independent Ink, Inc., has developed an ink with the same chemical composition as the ink sold by petitioners. After an infringement action brought by Trident against Independent was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, Independent filed suit against Trident seeking a judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of Trident's patents.<sup>[1]</sup> In an amended complaint, it alleged that petitioners are engaged in illegal tying and monopolization in violation of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. 15 U. S. C. §§ 1, 2.</p>\n<p>After discovery, the District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment on the Sherman Act claims. <i>Independent Ink, Inc.</i> v. <i>Trident, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2579570\"><a href=\"/opinion/2579570/independent-ink-inc-v-trident-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span>, 1177 (CD Cal. 2002). It rejected respondent's submission that petitioners \"necessarily have market power in the market for the tying product as a matter of law solely by virtue of the patent on their printhead system, thereby rendering [the] tying arrangements <i>per se</i> violations of the antitrust laws.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1159. Finding that respondent had submitted no affirmative evidence defining the relevant market or establishing petitioners' power within it, the court concluded that respondent could not prevail on either antitrust claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 1167, 1173, 1177. The parties settled their other claims, and respondent appealed.</p>\n<p>After a careful review of the \"long history of Supreme Court consideration of the legality of tying arrangements,\" 396 F. 3d 1342, 1346 (2005), the Court of Appeals for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> Federal Circuit reversed the District Court's decision as to respondent's § 1 claim, <i>id.,</i> at 1354. Placing special reliance on our decisions in <i>International Salt Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 332 U. S. 392 (1947), and <i>Loew's,</i> 371 U. S. 38, as well as our <i>Jefferson Parish</i> dictum, and after taking note of the academic criticism of those cases, it concluded that the \"fundamental error\" in petitioners' submission was its disregard of \"the duty of a court of appeals to follow the precedents of the Supreme Court until the Court itself chooses to expressly overrule them.\" 396 F. 3d, at 1351. We granted certiorari to undertake a fresh examination of the history of both the judicial and legislative appraisals of tying arrangements. 545 U. S. 1127 (2005). Our review is informed by extensive scholarly comment and a change in position by the administrative agencies charged with enforcement of the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>American courts first encountered tying arrangements in the course of patent infringement litigation. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co.</i> v. <i>Eureka Specialty Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></span> (CA6 1896). Such a case came before this Court in <i>Henry</i> v. <i>A. B. Dick Co.,</i> 224 U. S. 1 (1912), in which, as in the case we decide today, unpatented ink was the product that was \"tied\" to the use of a patented product through the use of a licensing agreement. Without commenting on the tying arrangement, the Court held that use of a competitor's ink in violation of a condition of the agreementthat the rotary mimeograph \"`may be used only with the stencil, paper, ink and other supplies made by A. B. Dick Co.'\"constituted infringement of the patent on the machine. <i>Id.,</i> at 25-26. Chief Justice White dissented, explaining his disagreement with the Court's approval of a practice that he regarded as an \"attempt to increase the scope of the monopoly granted by a patent ... which tend[s] to increase monopoly and to burden the public in the exercise of their common rights.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 70. Two years later, Congress <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> endorsed Chief Justice White's disapproval of tying arrangements, enacting § 3 of the Clayton Act. See 38 Stat. 731 (applying to \"patented or unpatented\" products); see also <i>Motion Picture Patents Co.</i> v. <i>Universal Film Mfg. Co.,</i> 243 U. S. 502, 517-518 (1917) (explaining that, in light of § 3 of the Clayton Act, <i>A. B. Dick</i> \"must be regarded as overruled\"). And in this Court's subsequent cases reviewing the legality of tying arrangements we, too, embraced Chief Justice White's disapproval of those arrangements. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Standard Oil Co. of Cal.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 337 U. S. 293, 305-306 (1949); <i>Mercoid Corp.</i> v. <i>Mid-Continent Investment Co.,</i> 320 U. S. 661, 664-665 (1944).</p>\n<p>In the years since <i>A. B. Dick,</i> four different rules of law have supported challenges to tying arrangements. They have been condemned as improper extensions of the patent monopoly under the patent misuse doctrine, as unfair methods of competition under § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U. S. C. § 45, as contracts tending to create a monopoly under § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 14, and as contracts in restraint of trade under § 1 of the Sherman Act.<sup>[2]</sup> In all of those instances, the justification for the challenge rested on either an assumption or a showing that the defendant's position of power in the market for the tying product was being used to restrain competition in the market for the tied product. As we explained in <i>Jefferson Parish,</i> 466 U. S., at 12, \"[o]ur cases have concluded that the essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms.\"</p>\n<p>Over the years, however, this Court's strong disapproval of tying arrangements has substantially diminished. Rather than relying on assumptions, in its more recent opinions the Court has required a showing of market power in the tying product. Our early opinions consistently assumed that \"[t]ying arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition.\" <i>Standard Oil Co.,</i> 337 U. S., at 305-306. In 1962, in <i>Loew's,</i> 371 U. S., at 47-48, the Court relied on this assumption despite evidence of significant competition in the market for the tying product. And as recently as 1969, Justice Black, writing for the majority, relied on the assumption as support for the proposition \"that, at least when certain prerequisites are met, arrangements of this kind are illegal in and of themselves, and no specific showing of unreasonable competitive effect is required.\" <i>Fortner Enterprises, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States Steel Corp.,</i> 394 U. S. 495, 498-499 <i>(Fortner I)</i><i>.</i> Explaining the Court's decision to allow the suit to proceed to trial, he stated that \"decisions rejecting the need for proof of truly dominant power over the tying product have all been based on a recognition that because tying arrangements generally serve no legitimate business purpose that cannot be achieved in some less restrictive way, the presence of any appreciable restraint on competition provides a sufficient reason for invalidating the tie.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 503.</p>\n<p>Reflecting a changing view of tying arrangements, four Justices dissented in <i>Fortner I,</i> arguing that the challenged \"tie\"the extension of a $2 million line of credit on condition that the borrower purchase prefabricated houses from the defendantmight well have served a legitimate purpose. <i>Id.,</i> at 510 (opinion of White, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 520 (opinion of Fortas, J.). In his opinion, Justice White noted that promotional tie-ins may provide \"uniquely advantageous deals\" to purchasers. <i>Id.,</i> at 519. And Justice Fortas concluded that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> arrangement was best characterized as \"a sale of a single product with the incidental provision of financing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 522.</p>\n<p>The dissenters' view that tying arrangements may well be procompetitive ultimately prevailed; indeed, it did so in the very same lawsuit. After the Court remanded the suit in <i>Fortner I,</i> a bench trial resulted in judgment for the plaintiff, and the case eventually made its way back to this Court. Upon return, we unanimously held that the plaintiff's failure of proof on the issue of market power was fatal to its case the plaintiff had proved \"nothing more than a willingness to provide cheap financing in order to sell expensive houses.\" <i>United States Steel Corp.</i> v. <i>Fortner Enterprises, Inc.,</i> 429 U. S. 610, 622 (1977) <i>(Fortner II)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>The assumption that \"[t]ying arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition,\" rejected in <i>Fortner II,</i> has not been endorsed in any opinion since. Instead, it was again rejected just seven years later in <i>Jefferson Parish,</i> where, as in <i>Fortner II,</i> we unanimously reversed a Court of Appeals judgment holding that an alleged tying arrangement constituted a <i>per se</i> violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. 466 U. S., at 5. Like the product at issue in the <i>Fortner</i> cases, the tying product in <i>Jefferson Parish</i>hospital serviceswas unpatented, and our holding again rested on the conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to prove sufficient power in the tying product market to restrain competition in the market for the tied productservices of anesthesiologists. 466 U. S., at 28-29.</p>\n<p>In rejecting the application of a <i>per se</i> rule that all tying arrangements constitute antitrust violations, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]e have condemned tying arrangements when the seller has some special abilityusually called `market power'to force a purchaser to do something that he would not do in a competitive market....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>... . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> \"<i>Per se</i> condemnationcondemnation without inquiry into actual market conditionsis only appropriate if the existence of forcing is probable. Thus, application of the <i>per se</i> rule focuses on the probability of anticompetitive consequences....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"For example, if the Government has granted the seller a patent or similar monopoly over a product, it is fair to presume that the inability to buy the product elsewhere gives the seller market power. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Loew's Inc.,</i> 371 U. S., at 45-47. Any effort to enlarge the scope of the patent monopoly by using the market power it confers to restrain competition in the market for a second product will undermine competition on the merits in that second market. Thus, the sale or lease of a patented item on condition that the buyer make all his purchases of a separate tied product from the patentee is unlawful.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 13-16 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Notably, nothing in our opinion suggested a rebuttable presumption of market power applicable to tying arrangements involving a patent on the tying good. See <i>infra,</i> at 44; cf. 396 F. 3d, at 1352. Instead, it described the rule that a contract to sell a patented product on condition that the purchaser buy unpatented goods exclusively from the patentee is a <i>per se</i> violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>Justice O'Connor wrote separately in <i>Jefferson Parish,</i> concurring in the judgment on the ground that the case did not involve a true tying arrangement because, in her view, surgical services and anesthesia were not separate products. 466 U. S., at 43. In her opinion, she questioned not only the propriety of treating any tying arrangement as a <i>per se</i> violation of the Sherman Act, <i>id.,</i> at 35, but also the validity of the presumption that a patent always gives the patentee significant market power, observing that the presumption was actually a product of our patent misuse cases rather than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> our antitrust jurisprudence, <i>id.,</i> at 37-38, n. 7. It is that presumption, a vestige of the Court's historical distrust of tying arrangements, that we address squarely today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Justice O'Connor was, of course, correct in her assertion that the presumption that a patent confers market power arose outside the antitrust context as part of the patent misuse doctrine. That doctrine had its origins in <i>Motion Picture Patents Co.</i> v. <i>Universal Film Mfg. Co.,</i> 243 U. S. 502 (1917), which found no support in the patent laws for the proposition that a patentee may \"prescribe by notice attached to a patented machine the conditions of its use and the supplies which must be used in the operation of it, under pain of infringement of the patent,\" <i>id.,</i> at 509. Although <i>Motion Picture Patents Co.</i> simply narrowed the scope of possible patent infringement claims, it formed the basis for the Court's subsequent decisions creating a patent misuse defense to infringement claims when a patentee uses its patent \"as the effective means of restraining competition with its sale of an unpatented article.\" <i>Morton Salt Co.</i> v. <i>G. S. Suppiger Co.,</i> 314 U. S. 488, 490 (1942); see also, <i>e. g., </i><i>Carbice Corp. of America</i> v. <i>American Patents Development Corp.,</i> 283 U. S. 27, 31 (1931).</p>\n<p>Without any analysis of actual market conditions, these patent misuse decisions assumed that, by tying the purchase of unpatented goods to the sale of the patented good, the patentee was \"restraining competition,\" <i>Morton Salt,</i> 314 U. S., at 490, or \"secur[ing] a limited monopoly of an unpatented material,\" <i>Mercoid,</i> 320 U. S., at 664; see also <i>Carbice,</i> 283 U. S., at 31-32. In other words, these decisions presumed \"[t]he requisite economic power\" over the tying product such that the patentee could \"extend [its] economic control to unpatented products.\" <i>Loew's,</i> 371 U. S., at 45-46.</p>\n<p>The presumption that a patent confers market power migrated from patent law to antitrust law in <i>International</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> <i>Salt Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 332 U. S. 392 (1947). In that case, we affirmed a District Court decision holding that leases of patented machines requiring the lessees to use the defendant's unpatented salt products violated § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act as a matter of law. <i>Id.,</i> at 396. Although the Court's opinion does not discuss market power or the patent misuse doctrine, it assumes that \"[t]he volume of business affected by these contracts cannot be said to be insignificant or insubstantial and the tendency of the arrangement to accomplishment of monopoly seems obvious.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The assumption that tying contracts \"ten[d] ... to accomplishment of monopoly\" can be traced to the Government's brief in <i>International Salt,</i> which relied heavily on our earlier patent misuse decision in <i>Morton Salt.</i> The Government described <i>Morton Salt</i> as \"present[ing] a factual situation almost identical with the instant case,\" and it asserted that \"although the Court in that case did not find it necessary to decide whether the antitrust laws were violated, its language, its reasoning, and its citations indicate that the policy underlying the decision was the same as that of the Sherman Act.\" Brief for United States in <i>International Salt Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1947, No. 46, p. 19 (United States Brief). Building on its assertion that <i>International Salt</i> was logically indistinguishable from <i>Morton Salt,</i> the Government argued that this Court should place tying arrangements involving patented products in the category of <i>per se</i> violations of the Sherman Act. United States Brief 26-33.</p>\n<p>Our opinion in <i>International Salt</i> clearly shows that we accepted the Government's invitation to import the presumption of market power in a patented product into our antitrust jurisprudence. While we cited <i>Morton Salt</i> only for the narrower proposition that the defendant's patents did not confer any right to restrain competition in unpatented salt or afford the defendant any immunity from the antitrust laws, <i>International Salt,</i> 332 U. S., at 395-396, given the fact that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> the defendant was selling its unpatented salt at competitive prices, <i>id.,</i> at 396-397, the rule adopted in <i>International Salt</i> necessarily accepted the Government's submission that the earlier patent misuse cases supported the broader proposition \"that this type of restraint is unlawful on its face under the Sherman Act,\" United States Brief 12.</p>\n<p>Indeed, later in the same Term we cited <i>International Salt</i> for the proposition that the license of \"a patented device on condition that unpatented materials be employed in conjunction with the patented device\" is an example of a restraint that is \"illegal <i>per se.</i>\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Columbia Steel Co.,</i> 334 U. S. 495, 522-523, and n. 22 (1948). And in subsequent cases we have repeatedly grounded the presumption of market power over a patented device in <i>International Salt.</i> See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Loew's,</i> 371 U. S., at 45-46; <i>Times-Picayune Publishing Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 345 U. S. 594, 608 (1953); <i>Standard Oil Co.,</i> 337 U. S., at 304.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Although the patent misuse doctrine and our antitrust jurisprudence became intertwined in <i>International Salt,</i> subsequent events initiated their untwining. This process has ultimately led to today's reexamination of the presumption of <i>per se</i> illegality of a tying arrangement involving a patented product, the first case since 1947 in which we have granted review to consider the presumption's continuing validity.</p>\n<p>Three years before we decided <i>International Salt,</i> this Court had expanded the scope of the patent misuse doctrine to include not only supplies or materials used by a patented device, but also tying arrangements involving a combination patent and \"unpatented material or [a] device [that] is itself an integral part of the structure embodying the patent.\" <i>Mercoid,</i> 320 U. S., at 665; see also <i>Dawson Chemical Co.</i> v. <i>Rohm &amp; Haas Co.,</i> 448 U. S. 176, 188-198 (1980) (describing in detail <i>Mercoid</i> and the cases leading up to it). In reaching this conclusion, the Court explained that it could see \"no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> difference in principle\" between cases involving elements essential to the inventive character of the patent and elements peripheral to it; both, in the Court's view, were attempts to \"expan[d] the patent beyond the legitimate scope of its monopoly.\" <i>Mercoid,</i> 320 U. S., at 665.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, Congress codified the patent laws for the first time. See 66 Stat. 792, codified at 35 U. S. C. § 1 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. III). At least partly in response to our <i>Mercoid</i> decision, Congress included a provision in its codification that excluded some conduct, such as a tying arrangement involving the sale of a patented product tied to an \"essential\" or \"nonstaple\" product that has no use except as part of the patented product or method, from the scope of the patent misuse doctrine. § 271(d); see also <i>Dawson,</i> 448 U. S., at 214. Thus, at the same time that our antitrust jurisprudence continued to rely on the assumption that \"tying arrangements generally serve no legitimate business purpose,\" <i>Fortner I,</i> 394 U. S., at 503, Congress began chipping away at the assumption in the patent misuse context from whence it came.</p>\n<p>It is Congress' most recent narrowing of the patent misuse defense, however, that is directly relevant to this case. Four years after our decision in <i>Jefferson Parish</i> repeated the patent-equals-market-power presumption, 466 U. S., at 16, Congress amended the Patent Code to eliminate that presumption in the patent misuse context, 102 Stat. 4676. The relevant provision reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement or contributory infringement of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his having done one or more of the following: ... (5) conditioned the license of any rights to the patent or the sale of the patented product on the acquisition of a license to rights in another patent or purchase of a separate product, <i>unless, in view of the circumstances, the patent owner has</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> <i>market power in the relevant market for the patent or patented product on which the license or sale is conditioned.</i>\" 35 U. S. C. § 271(d)(5) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The italicized clause makes it clear that Congress did not intend the mere existence of a patent to constitute the requisite \"market power.\" Indeed, fairly read, it provides that without proof that Trident had market power in the relevant market, its conduct at issue in this case was neither \"misuse\" nor an \"illegal extension of the patent right.\"</p>\n<p>While the 1988 amendment does not expressly refer to the antitrust laws, it certainly invites a reappraisal of the <i>per se</i> rule announced in <i>International Salt.</i><sup>[3]</sup> A rule denying a patentee the right to enjoin an infringer is significantly less severe than a rule that makes the conduct at issue a federal crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. See 15 U. S. C. § 1. It would be absurd to assume that Congress intended to provide that the use of a patent that merited punishment as a felony would not constitute \"misuse.\" Moreover, given the fact that the patent misuse doctrine provided the basis for the market power presumption, it would be anomalous to preserve the presumption in antitrust after Congress has eliminated its foundation. Cf. 10 P. Areeda, H. Hovenkamp, &amp; E. Elhauge, Antitrust Law ¶ 1737c (2d ed. 2004) (hereinafter Areeda).</p>\n<p>After considering the congressional judgment reflected in the 1988 amendment, we conclude that tying arrangements involving patented products should be evaluated under the standards applied in cases like <i>Fortner II</i> and <i>Jefferson Parish</i> rather than under the <i>per se</i> rule applied in <i>Morton Salt</i> and <i>Loew's.</i> While some such arrangements are still unlawful, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> such as those that are the product of a true monopoly or a marketwide conspiracy, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Paramount Pictures, Inc.,</i> 334 U. S. 131, 145-146 (1948), that conclusion must be supported by proof of power in the relevant market rather than by a mere presumption thereof.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Rather than arguing that we should retain the rule of <i>per se</i> illegality, respondent contends that we should endorse a rebuttable presumption that patentees possess market power when they condition the purchase of the patented product on an agreement to buy unpatented goods exclusively from the patentee. Cf. <i>supra,</i> at 37-38. Respondent recognizes that a large number of valid patents have little, if any, commercial significance, but submits that those that are used to impose tying arrangements on unwilling purchasers likely do exert significant market power. Hence, in respondent's view, the presumption would have no impact on patents of only slight value and would be justified, subject to being rebutted by evidence offered by the patentee, in cases in which the patent has sufficient value to enable the patentee to insist on acceptance of the tie.</p>\n<p>Respondent also offers a narrower alternative, suggesting that we differentiate between tying arrangements involving the simultaneous purchase of two products that are arguably two components of a single productsuch as the provision of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> surgical services and anesthesiology in the same operation, <i>Jefferson Parish,</i> 466 U. S., at 43 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), or the licensing of one copyrighted film on condition that the licensee take a package of several films in the same transaction, <i>Loew's,</i> 371 U. S. 38and a tying arrangement involving the purchase of unpatented goods over a period of time, a so-called \"requirements tie.\" See also Brief for Barry Nalebuff et al. as <i>Amici Curiae.</i> According to respondent, we should recognize a presumption of market power when faced with the latter type of arrangements because they provide a means for charging large volume purchasers a higher royalty for use of the patent than small purchasers must pay, a form of discrimination that \"is strong evidence of market power.\" Brief for Respondent 27; see generally <i>Jefferson Parish,</i> 466 U. S., at 15, n. 23 (discussing price discrimination of this sort and citing sources).</p>\n<p>The opinion that imported the \"patent equals market power\" presumption into our antitrust jurisprudence, however, provides no support for respondent's proposed alternative. In <i>International Salt,</i> it was the existence of the patent on the tying product, rather than the use of a requirements tie, that led the Court to presume market power. 332 U. S., at 395 (\"The appellant's patents confer a limited monopoly of the invention they reward\"). Moreover, the requirements tie in that case did not involve any price discrimination between large volume and small volume purchasers or evidence of noncompetitive pricing. Instead, the leases at issue provided that if any competitor offered salt, the tied product, at a lower price, \"the lessee should be free to buy in the open market, unless appellant would furnish the salt at an equal price.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 396.</p>\n<p>As we have already noted, the vast majority of academic literature recognizes that a patent does not necessarily confer market power. See n. 4, <i>supra.</i> Similarly, while price discrimination may provide evidence of market power, particularly if buttressed by evidence that the patentee has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> charged an above-market price for the tied package, see, <i>e. g.,</i> 10 Areeda ¶ 1769c, it is generally recognized that it also occurs in fully competitive markets, see, <i>e. g.,</i> Baumol &amp; Swanson, The New Economy and Ubiquitous Competitive Price Discrimination: Identifying Defensible Criteria of Market Power, 70 Antitrust L. J. 661, 666 (2003); 9 Areeda ¶ 1711; Landes &amp; Posner 374-375. We are not persuaded that the combination of these two factors should give rise to a presumption of market power when neither is sufficient to do so standing alone. Rather, the lesson to be learned from <i>International Salt</i> and the academic commentary is the same: Many tying arrangements, even those involving patents and requirements ties, are fully consistent with a free, competitive market. For this reason, we reject both respondent's proposed rebuttable presumption and their narrower alternative.</p>\n<p>It is no doubt the virtual consensus among economists that has persuaded the enforcement agencies to reject the position that the Government took when it supported the <i>per se</i> rule that the Court adopted in the 1940's. See <i>supra,</i> at 39. In antitrust guidelines issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in 1995, the enforcement agencies stated that in the exercise of their prosecutorial discretion they \"will not presume that a patent, copyright, or trade secret necessarily confers market power upon its owner.\" U. S. Dept. of Justice and FTC, Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property § 2.2 (Apr. 6, 1995), http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/guidelines/0558.pdf (as visited Feb. 24, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). While that choice is not binding on the Court, it would be unusual for the Judiciary to replace the normal rule of lenity that is applied in criminal cases with a rule of severity for a special category of antitrust cases.</p>\n<p>Congress, the antitrust enforcement agencies, and most economists have all reached the conclusion that a patent does not necessarily confer market power upon the patentee. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> Today, we reach the same conclusion, and therefore hold that, in all cases involving a tying arrangement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant has market power in the tying product.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>In this case, respondent reasonably relied on our prior opinions in moving for summary judgment without offering evidence defining the relevant market or proving that petitioners possess power within it. When the case returns to the District Court, respondent should therefore be given a fair opportunity to develop and introduce evidence on that issue, as well as any other issues that are relevant to its remaining § 1 claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the American Bar Association by <i>Robert J.

Argued November 29, 2005—Decided March 1, 2006\nPetitioners manufacture and market printing systems that include a\n  patented printhead and ink container and unpatented ink, which\n  they sell to original equipment manufacturers who agree that they\n  will purchase ink exclusively from petitioners and that neither they\n  nor their customers will refill the patented containers with ink of any\n  kind. Respondent developed ink with the same chemical composition\n  as petitioners’ ink. After petitioner Trident’s infringement action\n  was dismissed, respondent filed suit seeking a judgment of nonin-\n  fringement and invalidity of Trident’s patents on the ground that pe-\n  titioners are engaged in illegal “tying” and monopolization in viola-\n  tion of §§1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Granting petitioners summary\n  judgment, the District Court rejected respondent’s argument that pe-\n  titioners necessarily have market power as a matter of law by virtue\n  of the patent on their printhead system, thereby rendering the tying\n  arrangements per se violations of the antitrust laws. After carefully\n  reviewing this Court’s tying-arrangements decisions, the Federal Cir-\n  cuit reversed as to the §1 claim, concluding that it had to follow this\n  Court’s precedents until overruled by this Court.\nHeld: Because a patent does not necessarily confer market power upon\n the patentee, in all cases involving a tying arrangement, the plaintiff\n must prove that the defendant has market power in the tying prod-\n uct. Pp. 3–17.\n    (a) Over the years, this Court’s strong disapproval of tying ar-\n rangements has substantially diminished, as the Court has moved\n from relying on assumptions to requiring a showing of market power\n in the tying product. The assumption in earlier decisions that such\n “arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of\n2     ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. v.

Hyde, 466 U. S. 2, both of which in-\n    volved unpatented tying products. Nothing in Jefferson Parish sug-\n    gested a rebuttable presumption of market power applicable to tying\n    arrangements involving a patent on the tying good. Pp. 3–8.\n       (b) The presumption that a patent confers market power arose out-\n    side the antitrust context as part of the patent misuse doctrine, and\n    migrated to antitrust law in International Salt Co. v. United States,\n    332 U. S. 392. See also Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., 314\n    U. S. 488; United States v. Loew’s Inc., 371 U. S. 38. Pp. 8–10.\n       (c) When Congress codified the patent laws for the first time, it ini-\n    tiated the untwining of the patent misuse doctrine and antitrust ju-\n    risprudence. At the same time that this Court’s antitrust jurispru-\n    dence continued to rely on the assumption that tying arrangements\n    generally serve no legitimate business purpose, Congress began chip-\n    ping away at that assumption in the patent misuse context from\n    whence it came. Then, four years after Jefferson Parish repeated the\n    presumption that patents confer market power, Congress amended\n    the Patent Code to eliminate it in the patent misuse context. While\n    that amendment does not expressly refer to the antitrust laws, it in-\n    vites reappraisal of International Salt’s per se rule. After considering\n    the congressional judgment reflected in the amendment, this Court\n    concludes that tying arrangements involving patented products\n    should be evaluated under the standards of cases like Fortner II and\n    Jefferson Parish rather than the per se rule in Morton Salt and\n    Loew’s. Any conclusion that an arrangement is unlawful must be\n    supported by proof of power in the relevant market rather than by a\n    mere presumption thereof. Pp. 11–13.\n       (d) Respondent’s alternatives to retention of the per se rule—that\n    the Court endorse a rebuttable presumption that patentees possess\n    market power when they condition the purchase of the patented\n    product on an agreement to buy unpatented goods exclusively from\n    the patentee, or differentiate between tying arrangements involving\n    requirements ties and other types of tying arrangements—are re-\n    jected. Pp. 14–16.\n       (e) Because respondent reasonably relied on this Court’s prior opin-\n    ions in moving for summary judgment without offering evidence of\n    the relevant market or proving petitioners’ power within that mar-\n    ket, respondent should be given a fair opportunity to develop and in-\n    troduce evidence on that issue, as well as other relevant issues, when\n    the case returns to the District Court.

No. 2 v. Hyde, 466\nU. S. 2 (1984), we repeated the well-settled proposition\nthat “if the Government has granted the seller a patent or\nsimilar monopoly over a product, it is fair to presume that\nthe inability to buy the product elsewhere gives the seller\nmarket power.” Id., at 16. This presumption of market\npower, applicable in the antitrust context when a seller\nconditions its sale of a patented product (the “tying” prod-\nuct) on the purchase of a second product (the “tied” prod-\nuct), has its foundation in the judicially created patent\nmisuse doctrine. See United States v. Loew’s Inc., 371\nU. S. 38, 46 (1962). In 1988, Congress substantially un-\ndermined that foundation, amending the Patent Act to\neliminate the market power presumption in patent misuse\ncases. See 102 Stat. 4674, codified at 35 U. S. C. §271(d).\nThe question presented to us today is whether the pre-\nsumption of market power in a patented product should\nsurvive as a matter of antitrust law despite its demise in\npatent law. We conclude that the mere fact that a tying\nproduct is patented does not support such a presumption.\n2   ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. v. INDEPENDENT INK, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n   Petitioners, Trident, Inc., and its parent, Illinois Tool\nWorks Inc., manufacture and market printing systems\nthat include three relevant components: (1) a patented\npiezoelectric impulse ink jet printhead; (2) a patented ink\ncontainer, consisting of a bottle and valved cap, which\nattaches to the printhead; and (3) specially designed, but\nunpatented, ink. Petitioners sell their systems to original\nequipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are licensed to\nincorporate the printheads and containers into printers\nthat are in turn sold to companies for use in printing\nbarcodes on cartons and packaging materials. The OEMs\nagree that they will purchase their ink exclusively from\npetitioners, and that neither they nor their customers will\nrefill the patented containers with ink of any kind.\n   Respondent, Independent Ink, Inc., has developed an\nink with the same chemical composition as the ink sold by\npetitioners. After an infringement action brought by\nTrident against Independent was dismissed for lack of\npersonal jurisdiction, Independent filed suit against Tri-\ndent seeking a judgment of noninfringement and invalid-\nity of Trident’s patents.1 In an amended complaint, it\nalleged that petitioners are engaged in illegal tying and\nmonopolization in violation of §§1 and 2 of the Sherman\nAct. 15 U. S. C. §§1, 2.\n   After discovery, the District Court granted petitioners’\nmotion for summary judgment on the Sherman Act claims.\nIndependent Ink, Inc. v. Trident, Inc., 210 F. Supp. 2d\n1155, 1177 (CD Cal. 2002).

Finding that\nrespondent had submitted no affirmative evidence defin-\ning the relevant market or establishing petitioners’ power\nwithin it, the court concluded that respondent could not\nprevail on either antitrust claim. Id., at 1167, 1173, 1177.\nThe parties settled their other claims, and respondent\nappealed.\n   After a careful review of the “long history of Supreme\nCourt consideration of the legality of tying arrangements,”\n396 F. 3d 1342, 1346 (2005), the Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit reversed the District Court’s decision as to\nrespondent’s §1 claim, id., at 1354.

S. 38, as\nwell as our Jefferson Parish dictum, and after taking note\nof the academic criticism of those cases, it concluded that\nthe “fundamental error” in petitioners’ submission was its\ndisregard of “the duty of a court of appeals to follow the\nprecedents of the Supreme Court until the Court itself\nchooses to expressly overrule them.” 396 F. 3d, at 1351.\nWe granted certiorari to undertake a fresh examination of\nthe history of both the judicial and legislative appraisals of\ntying arrangements. 545 U.

Our review is\ninformed by extensive scholarly comment and a change in\nposition by the administrative agencies charged with\nenforcement of the antitrust laws.\n                             II\n  American courts first encountered tying arrangements\nin the course of patent infringement litigation. See, e.g.,\nHeaton-Peninsular Button-Fastening Co. v. Eureka Spe-\ncialty Co., 77 F. 288 (CA6 1896). Such a case came before\nthis Court in Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1 (1912), in\nwhich, as in the case we decide today, unpatented ink was\nthe product that was “tied” to the use of a patented product\nthrough the use of a licensing agreement. Without com-\n4   ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. v. INDEPENDENT INK, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nmenting on the tying arrangement, the Court held that use\nof a competitor’s ink in violation of a condition of the agree-\nment—that the rotary mimeograph “ ‘may be used only\nwith the stencil, paper, ink and other supplies made by A.\nB. Dick Co.’ ”—constituted infringement of the patent on the\nmachine. Id., at 25–26. Chief Justice White dissented,\nexplaining his disagreement with the Court’s approval of a\npractice that he regarded as an “attempt to increase the\nscope of the monopoly granted by a patent . . . which tend[s]\nto increase monopoly and to burden the public in the exer-\ncise of their common rights.” Id., at 70. Two years later,\nCongress endorsed Chief Justice White’s disapproval of\ntying arrangements, enacting §3 of the Clayton Act. See 38\nStat. 731 (applying to “patented or unpatented” products);\nsee also Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg.\nCo., 243 U. S. 502, 517–518 (1917) (explaining that, in light\nof §3 of the Clayton Act, A. B. Dick “must be regarded as\noverruled”). And in this Court’s subsequent cases reviewing\nthe legality of tying arrangements we, too, embraced Chief\nJustice White’s disapproval of those arrangements. See,\ne.g., Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, 337 U. S. 293,\n305–306 (1949); Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment\nCo., 320 U. S. 661, 664–665 (1944).\n   In the years since A. B. Dick, four different rules of law\nhave supported challenges to tying arrangements. They\nhave been condemned as improper extensions of the pat-\nent monopoly under the patent misuse doctrine, as unfair\nmethods of competition under §5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, 15 U. S. C. §45, as contracts tending to\ncreate a monopoly under §3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C.\n§13a, and as contracts in restraint of trade under §1 of the\nSherman Act.2 In all of those instances, the justification\n——————\n  2 See, e.g., Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v.

S. ____ (2006)                    5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfor the challenge rested on either an assumption or a\nshowing that the defendant’s position of power in the\nmarket for the tying product was being used to restrain\ncompetition in the market for the tied product. As we\nexplained in Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 12, “[o]ur cases\nhave concluded that the essential characteristic of an\ninvalid tying arrangement lies in the seller’s exploitation\nof its control over the tying product to force the buyer into\nthe purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did\nnot want at all, or might have preferred to purchase else-\nwhere on different terms.”\n   Over the years, however, this Court’s strong disapproval\nof tying arrangements has substantially diminished.\nRather than relying on assumptions, in its more recent\nopinions the Court has required a showing of market\npower in the tying product. Our early opinions consis-\ntently assumed that “[t]ying arrangements serve hardly\nany purpose beyond the suppression of competition.”\nStandard Oil Co., 337 U. S., at 305–306. In 1962, in Loew’s,\n371 U. S., at 47–48, the Court relied on this assumption\ndespite evidence of significant competition in the market for\nthe tying product. And as recently as 1969, Justice Black,\nwriting for the majority, relied on the assumption as sup-\nport for the proposition “that, at least when certain prereq-\nuisites are met, arrangements of this kind are illegal in and\nof themselves, and no specific showing of unreasonable\ncompetitive effect is required.” Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v.\nUnited States Steel Corp., 394 U. S. 495, 498–499 (Fortner\nI). Explaining the Court’s decision to allow the suit to pro-\nceed to trial, he stated that “decisions rejecting the need for\nproof of truly dominant power over the tying product have\n\n—————— \n\ntional Salt Co. v.

INDEPENDENT INK, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall been based on a recognition that because tying arrange-\nments generally serve no legitimate business purpose that\ncannot be achieved in some less restrictive way, the pres-\nence of any appreciable restraint on competition provides a\nsufficient reason for invalidating the tie.” Id., at 503.\n   Reflecting a changing view of tying arrangements, four\nJustices dissented in Fortner I, arguing that the chal-\nlenged “tie”—the extension of a $2 million line of credit on\ncondition that the borrower purchase prefabricated houses\nfrom the defendant—might well have served a legitimate\npurpose. Id., at 510 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 520\n(opinion of Fortas, J.). In his opinion, Justice White noted\nthat promotional tie-ins may provide “uniquely advanta-\ngeous deals” to purchasers. Id., at 519. And Justice For-\ntas concluded that the arrangement was best character-\nized as “a sale of a single product with the incidental\nprovision of financing.” Id., at 522.\n   The dissenters’ view that tying arrangements may well\nbe procompetitive ultimately prevailed; indeed, it did so in\nthe very same lawsuit. After the Court remanded the suit\nin Fortner I, a bench trial resulted in judgment for the\nplaintiff, and the case eventually made its way back to\nthis Court. Upon return, we unanimously held that the\nplaintiff’s failure of proof on the issue of market power was\nfatal to its case—the plaintiff had proved “nothing more\nthan a willingness to provide cheap financing in order to\nsell expensive houses.” United States Steel Corp. v.\nFortner Enterprises, Inc., 429 U. S. 610, 622 (1977)\n(Fortner II).\n   The assumption that “[t]ying arrangements serve hardly\nany purpose beyond the suppression of competition,”\nrejected in Fortner II, has not been endorsed in any opin-\nion since. Instead, it was again rejected just seven years\nlater in Jefferson Parish, where, as in Fortner II, we\nunanimously reversed a Court of Appeals judgment hold-\ning that an alleged tying arrangement constituted a per se\n                  Cite as: 547 U.

Like the\nproduct at issue in the Fortner cases, the tying product in\nJefferson Parish—hospital services—was unpatented, and\nour holding again rested on the conclusion that the plaintiff\nhad failed to prove sufficient power in the tying product\nmarket to restrain competition in the market for the tied\nproduct—services of anesthesiologists. 466 U. S., at 28–29.\n  In rejecting the application of a per se rule that all tying\narrangements constitute antitrust violations, we\nexplained:\n    “[W]e have condemned tying arrangements when the\n    seller has some special ability—usually called ‘market\n    power’—to force a purchaser to do something that he\n    would not do in a competitive market. . . .\n         .           .           .           .          .\n       “Per se condemnation—condemnation without in-\n    quiry into actual market conditions—is only appropri-\n    ate if the existence of forcing is probable. Thus, appli-\n    cation of the per se rule focuses on the probability of\n    anticompetitive consequences. . . .\n    “For example, if the Government has granted the\n    seller a patent or similar monopoly over a product, it\n    is fair to presume that the inability to buy the product\n    elsewhere gives the seller market power. United\n    States v. Loew’s Inc., 371 U. S., at 45–47. Any effort\n    to enlarge the scope of the patent monopoly by using\n    the market power it confers to restrain competition in\n    the market for a second product will undermine com-\n    petition on the merits in that second market. Thus,\n    the sale or lease of a patented item on condition that\n    the buyer make all his purchases of a separate tied\n    product from the patentee is unlawful.” Id., at 13–16\n    (footnote omitted).\nNotably, nothing in our opinion suggested a rebuttable\npresumption of market power applicable to tying ar-\n8   ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. v.

Instead, it described the\nrule that a contract to sell a patented product on condition\nthat the purchaser buy unpatented goods exclusively from\nthe patentee is a per se violation of §1 of the Sherman Act.\n  Justice O’Connor wrote separately in Jefferson Parish,\nconcurring in the judgment on the ground that the case did\nnot involve a true tying arrangement because, in her view,\nsurgical services and anesthesia were not separate prod-\nucts. 466 U. S., at 43. In her opinion, she questioned not\nonly the propriety of treating any tying arrangement as a\nper se violation of the Sherman Act, id., at 35, but also the\nvalidity of the presumption that a patent always gives the\npatentee significant market power, observing that the\npresumption was actually a product of our patent misuse\ncases rather than our antitrust jurisprudence, id., at 37–\n38, n. 7. It is that presumption, a vestige of the Court’s\nhistorical distrust of tying arrangements, that we address\nsquarely today.\n                             III\n  Justice O’Connor was, of course, correct in her assertion\nthat the presumption that a patent confers market power\narose outside the antitrust context as part of the patent\nmisuse doctrine. That doctrine had its origins in Motion\nPicture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S.\n502 (1917), which found no support in the patent laws for\nthe proposition that a patentee may “prescribe by notice\nattached to a patented machine the conditions of its use\nand the supplies which must be used in the operation of it,\nunder pain of infringement of the patent,” id., at 509.\nAlthough Motion Picture Patents Co. simply narrowed the\nscope of possible patent infringement claims, it formed the\nbasis for the Court’s subsequent decisions creating a pat-\nent misuse defense to infringement claims when a pat-\nentee uses its patent “as the effective means of restraining\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

S. 488, 490\n(1942); see also, e.g., Carbice Corp. of America v. American\nPatents Development Corp., 283 U. S. 27, 31 (1931).\n  Without any analysis of actual market conditions, these\npatent misuse decisions assumed that, by tying the pur-\nchase of unpatented goods to the sale of the patented good,\nthe patentee was “restraining competition,” Morton Salt,\n314 U. S., at 490, or “secur[ing] a limited monopoly of an\nunpatented material,” Mercoid, 320 U. S., at 664; see also\nCarbice, 283 U. S., at 31–32. In other words, these deci-\nsions presumed “[t]he requisite economic power” over the\ntying product such that the patentee could “extend [its]\neconomic control to unpatented products.” Loew’s, 371\nU. S., at 45–46.\n  The presumption that a patent confers market power\nmigrated from patent law to antitrust law in International\nSalt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392 (1947). In that\ncase, we affirmed a District Court decision holding that\nleases of patented machines requiring the lessees to use\nthe defendant’s unpatented salt products violated §1 of the\nSherman Act and §3 of the Clayton Act as a matter of law.\nId., at 396. Although the Court’s opinion does not discuss\nmarket power or the patent misuse doctrine, it assumes\nthat “[t]he volume of business affected by these contracts\ncannot be said to be insignificant or insubstantial and the\ntendency of the arrangement to accomplishment of mo-\nnopoly seems obvious.” Ibid.\n  The assumption that tying contracts “ten[d] . . . to ac-\ncomplishment of monopoly” can be traced to the Govern-\nment’s brief in International Salt, which relied heavily on\nour earlier patent misuse decision in Morton Salt. The\nGovernment described Morton Salt as “present[ing] a\nfactual situation almost identical with the instant case,”\nand it asserted that “although the Court in that case did\nnot find it necessary to decide whether the antitrust laws\n10   ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. v. INDEPENDENT INK, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwere violated, its language, its reasoning, and its citations\nindicate that the policy underlying the decision was the\nsame as that of the Sherman Act.” Brief for United States\nin International Salt Co. v. United States, O. T. 1947, No.\n46, p. 19 (United States Brief). Building on its assertion\nthat International Salt was logically indistinguishable\nfrom Morton Salt, the Government argued that this Court\nshould place tying arrangements involving patented prod-\nucts in the category of per se violations of the Sherman\nAct. United States Brief 26–33.\n  Our opinion in International Salt clearly shows that we\naccepted the Government’s invitation to import the pre-\nsumption of market power in a patented product into our\nantitrust jurisprudence. While we cited Morton Salt only\nfor the narrower proposition that the defendant’s patents\ndid not confer any right to restrain competition in unpat-\nented salt or afford the defendant any immunity from the\nantitrust laws, International Salt, 332 U. S., at 395–396,\ngiven the fact that the defendant was selling its unpat-\nented salt at competitive prices, id., at 396–397, the rule\nadopted in International Salt necessarily accepted the\nGovernment’s submission that the earlier patent misuse\ncases supported the broader proposition “that this type of\nrestraint is unlawful on its face under the Sherman Act,”\nUnited States Brief 12.\n  Indeed, later in the same Term we cited International\nSalt for the proposition that the license of “a patented\ndevice on condition that unpatented materials be em-\nployed in conjunction with the patented device” is an\nexample of a restraint that is “illegal per se.” United\nStates v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U. S. 495, 522–523, and n.\n22 (1948). And in subsequent cases we have repeatedly\ngrounded the presumption of market power over a patented\ndevice in International Salt. See, e.g., Loew’s, 371 U. S., at\n45–46; Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States,\n345 U. S. 594, 608 (1953); Standard Oil Co., 337 U. S., at\n304.\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

This process\nhas ultimately led to today’s reexamination of the pre-\nsumption of per se illegality of a tying arrangement involv-\ning a patented product, the first case since 1947 in which\nwe have granted review to consider the presumption’s\ncontinuing validity.\n   Three years before we decided International Salt, this\nCourt had expanded the scope of the patent misuse doc-\ntrine to include not only supplies or materials used by a\npatented device, but also tying arrangements involving a\ncombination patent and “unpatented material or [a] device\n[that] is itself an integral part of the structure embodying\nthe patent.” Mercoid, 320 U. S., at 665; see also Dawson\nChemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U. S. 176, 188–198\n(1980) (describing in detail Mercoid and the cases leading\nup to it). In reaching this conclusion, the Court explained\nthat it could see “no difference in principle” between cases\ninvolving elements essential to the inventive character of\nthe patent and elements peripheral to it; both, in the\nCourt’s view, were attempts to “expan[d] the patent be-\nyond the legitimate scope of its monopoly.” Mercoid, 320\nU. S., at 665.\n   Shortly thereafter, Congress codified the patent laws for\nthe first time. See 66 Stat. 792, codified as 35 U. S. C. §1\net seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. III). At least partly in response\nto our Mercoid decision, Congress included a provision in\nits codification that excluded some conduct, such as a\ntying arrangement involving the sale of a patented prod-\nuct tied to an “essential” or “nonstaple” product that has\nno use except as part of the patented product or method,\nfrom the scope of the patent misuse doctrine. §271(d); see\nalso Dawson, 448 U. S., at 214. Thus, at the same time\nthat our antitrust jurisprudence continued to rely on the\n12   ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. v. INDEPENDENT INK, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nassumption that “tying arrangements generally serve no\nlegitimate business purpose,” Fortner I, 394 U. S., at 503,\nCongress began chipping away at the assumption in the\npatent misuse context from whence it came.\n   It is Congress’ most recent narrowing of the patent\nmisuse defense, however, that is directly relevant to this\ncase. Four years after our decision in Jefferson Parish\nrepeated the patent–equals–market–power presumption,\n466 U. S., at 16, Congress amended the Patent Code to\neliminate that presumption in the patent misuse context,\n102 Stat. 4674. The relevant provision reads:\n     “(d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for in-\n     fringement or contributory infringement of a patent\n     shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or il-\n     legal extension of the patent right by reason of his\n     having done one or more of the following: . . . (5) con-\n     ditioned the license of any rights to the patent or the\n     sale of the patented product on the acquisition of a li-\n     cense to rights in another patent or purchase of a\n     separate product, unless, in view of the circumstances,\n     the patent owner has market power in the relevant\n     market for the patent or patented product on which the\n     license or sale is conditioned.” 35 U. S. C. §271(d)(5)\n     (emphasis added).\nThe italicized clause makes it clear that Congress did not\nintend the mere existence of a patent to constitute the\nrequisite “market power.” Indeed, fairly read, it provides\nthat without proof that Trident had market power in the\nrelevant market, its conduct at issue in this case was nei-\nther “misuse” nor an “illegal extension of the patent right.”\n  While the 1988 amendment does not expressly refer to\nthe antitrust laws, it certainly invites a reappraisal of the\nper se rule announced in International Salt.3 A rule deny-\n——————\n 3 While   our opinions have made clear that such an invitation is not\n                      Cite as: 547 U.

See 15 U. S. C. §1. It would be absurd to assume\nthat Congress intended to provide that the use of a patent\nthat merited punishment as a felony would not constitute\n“misuse.” Moreover, given the fact that the patent misuse\ndoctrine provided the basis for the market power pre-\nsumption, it would be anomalous to preserve the presump-\ntion in antitrust after Congress has eliminated its founda-\ntion. Cf. 10 P. Areeda, H. Hovenkamp, & E. Elhauge,\nAntitrust Law ¶1737c (2d ed. 2004) (hereinafter Areeda).\n   After considering the congressional judgment reflected\nin the 1988 amendment, we conclude that tying arrange-\nments involving patented products should be evaluated\nunder the standards applied in cases like Fortner II and\nJefferson Parish rather than under the per se rule applied\nin Morton Salt and Loew’s. While some such arrange-\nments are still unlawful, such as those that are the prod-\nuct of a true monopoly or a marketwide conspiracy, see,\ne.g., United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U. S.\n131, 145–146 (1948), that conclusion must be supported by\nproof of power in the relevant market rather than by a\nmere presumption thereof.4\n——————\nnecessary with respect to cases arising under the Sherman Act, see\nState Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997), it is certainly sufficient to\nwarrant reevaluation of our precedent, id., at 21 (“[T]his Court has\nreconsidered its decisions construing the Sherman Act when the\ntheoretical underpinnings of those decisions are called into serious\nquestion”).\n   4 Our imposition of this requirement accords with the vast majority of\n\nacademic literature on the subject. See, e.g., 10 Areeda ¶1737a\n(“[T]here is no economic basis for inferring any amount of market power\nfrom the mere fact that the defendant holds a valid patent”); Burchfiel,\nPatent Misuse and Antitrust Reform: “Blessed be the Tie?” 4 Harv.

Cf. supra, at 7–8.\nRespondent recognizes that a large number of valid pat-\nents have little, if any, commercial significance, but sub-\nmits that those that are used to impose tying arrange-\nments on unwilling purchasers likely do exert significant\nmarket power. Hence, in respondent’s view, the presump-\ntion would have no impact on patents of only slight value\nand would be justified, subject to being rebutted by evi-\ndence offered by the patentee, in cases in which the patent\nhas sufficient value to enable the patentee to insist on\nacceptance of the tie.\n   Respondent also offers a narrower alternative, suggest-\ning that we differentiate between tying arrangements\ninvolving the simultaneous purchase of two products that\nare arguably two components of a single product—such as\nthe provision of surgical services and anesthesiology in the\nsame operation, Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 43\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment), or the licensing of\none copyrighted film on condition that the licensee take a\npackage of several films in the same transaction, Loew’s,\n371 U.

S., at 15, n. 23 (discussing price\ndiscrimination of this sort and citing sources).\n   The opinion that imported the “patent equals market\npower” presumption into our antitrust jurisprudence,\nhowever, provides no support for respondent’s proposed\nalternative. In International Salt, it was the existence of\nthe patent on the tying product, rather than the use of a\nrequirements tie, that led the Court to presume market\npower. 332 U. S., at 395 (“The appellant’s patents confer a\nlimited monopoly of the invention they reward”). More-\nover, the requirements tie in that case did not involve any\nprice discrimination between large volume and small\nvolume purchasers or evidence of noncompetitive pricing.\nInstead, the leases at issue provided that if any competitor\noffered salt, the tied product, at a lower price, “the lessee\nshould be free to buy in the open market, unless appellant\nwould furnish the salt at an equal price.” Id., at 396.\n   As we have already noted, the vast majority of academic\nliterature recognizes that a patent does not necessarily\nconfer market power. See n. 4, supra. Similarly, while\nprice discrimination may provide evidence of market\npower, particularly if buttressed by evidence that the\npatentee has charged an above-market price for the tied\npackage, see, e.g., 10 Areeda ¶1769c, it is generally recog-\nnized that it also occurs in fully competitive markets, see,\ne.g., Baumol & Swanson, The New Economy and Ubiqui-\ntous Competitive Price Discrimination: Identifying Defen-\nsible Criteria of Market Power, 70 Antitrust L. J. 661, 666\n(2003); 9 Areeda ¶1711; Landes & Posner 374–375. We\nare not persuaded that the combination of these two fac-\ntors should give rise to a presumption of market power\n16   ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. v. INDEPENDENT INK, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen neither is sufficient to do so standing alone. Rather,\nthe lesson to be learned from International Salt and the\nacademic commentary is the same: Many tying arrange-\nments, even those involving patents and requirements\nties, are fully consistent with a free, competitive market.\nFor this reason, we reject both respondent’s proposed\nrebuttable presumption and their narrower alternative.\n   It is no doubt the virtual consensus among economists\nthat has persuaded the enforcement agencies to reject the\nposition that the Government took when it supported the\nper se rule that the Court adopted in the 1940’s. See\nsupra, at 8. In antitrust guidelines issued jointly by the\nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission\nin 1995, the enforcement agencies stated that in the exer-\ncise of their prosecutorial discretion they “will not pre-\nsume that a patent, copyright, or trade secret necessarily\nconfers market power upon its owner.” U. S. Dept. of\nJustice and FTC, Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of\nIntellectual Property §2.2 (Apr. 6, 1995), available at\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/guidelines/0558.pdf      (as\nvisited Feb. 24, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). While that choice is not binding on the Court, it\nwould be unusual for the Judiciary to replace the normal\nrule of lenity that is applied in criminal cases with a rule\nof severity for a special category of antitrust cases.\n   Congress, the antitrust enforcement agencies, and most\neconomists have all reached the conclusion that a patent\ndoes not necessarily confer market power upon the pat-\nentee. Today, we reach the same conclusion, and therefore\nhold that, in all cases involving a tying arrangement, the\nplaintiff must prove that the defendant has market power\nin the tying product.\n                           VI\n  In this case, respondent reasonably relied on our prior\nopinions in moving for summary judgment without offer-\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

Accordingly, the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145673/", "sha1": "d8945071f067351e9469fda5dfce5b5a68050469", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2005-038", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:06:29"}
