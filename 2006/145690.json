The conviction was all the more serious because it subjected him to California's three strikes rule for sentencing. The question at issue in this federal habeas corpus action, however, is the California courts' rejection of Collins' argument that the prosecutor struck a young, African-American woman, Juror 16, from the panel on account of her race. A second African-American juror was also the subject of a peremptory strike, and although Collins challenged that strike in the trial court, on appeal he objected only to the excusal of Juror 16.</p>\n<p>Even prior to this Court's decision in <i>Batson</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 79 (1986), California courts barred peremptory challenges to jurors based on race. <i>People</i> v. <i>Wheeler,</i> 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978). Although our recent decision in <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 545 U.S. 162 (2005), disapproved of the manner in which <i>Wheeler</i> and <i>Batson</i> were implemented in some California cases, the state courts in this case used the correct analytical framework in considering and ruling upon the objection to the prosecutorial strike.</p>\n<p>As race-neutral explanations for striking Juror 16, the prosecutor said that Juror 16 had rolled her eyes in response to a question from the court; that Juror 16 was young and might be too tolerant of a drug crime; and that Juror 16 was single and lacked ties to the community. A further, more troubling part of the prosecutor's unorganized explanation was her reference to Juror 16's gender. The trial court, correctly, disallowed any reliance on that ground. The trial court, furthermore, which had the benefit of observing the prosecutor firsthand over the course of the proceedings, rejected Collins' challenge.</p>\n<blockquote>\"With regard to 016, the court, frankly, did not observe the demeanor of Ms. 016 that was complained of by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*337</span> the District Attorney; however, Ms. 016 was a youthful person, as was [a white male juror the prosecutor also dismissed by peremptory challenge]. And one or more prospective jurors also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The Court is prepared to give the District Attorney the benefit of the doubt as to Ms. 016.\" 2 App. 14-15.</blockquote>\n<p>The California Court of Appeal upheld the conviction and the trial court's ruling on the peremptory challenge. <i>People</i> v. <i>Collins,</i> No. B106939 (Dec. 12, 1997), App. H to Pet. for Cert. 112-117. In its view, youth was a legitimate reason to exercise a peremptory challenge; and, even if it were not, Juror 16's demeanor also supported the strike. <i>Id.,</i> at 116. According to its review of the record, nothing suggested the trial court failed to conduct a searching inquiry of the prosecutor's reasons for striking Juror 16. <i>Id.,</i> at 116-117. The appeals court thus upheld the trial court's ultimate conclusion to credit the prosecutor. <i>Ibid.</i> Without comment, the Supreme Court of California denied Collins' petition for review. App. F, <i>id.,</i> at 96.</p>\n<p>Collins sought collateral relief on this claim in federal court. The United States District Court for the Central District of California dismissed with prejudice Collins' petition for a writ of habeas corpus. App. D, <i>id.,</i> at 91. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions to grant the petition. 348 F.3d 1082 (2003), amended and superseded by 365 F.3d 667 (2004). Noting that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) governed Collins' petition, the panel majority concluded that it was an unreasonable factual determination to credit the prosecutor's race-neutral reasons for striking Juror 16. <i>Id.,</i> at 679. Judge Hall dissented, <i>id.,</i> at 687-691; and later, over the dissent of five judges, the Court of Appeals declined to rehear the case en banc, <i>id.,</i> at 670-673. Though it recited the proper standard of review, the panel majority improperly substituted its evaluation of the record for that of the state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*338</span> trial court. We granted the petition for certiorari, 545 U.S. 1151 (2005), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>A defendant's <i>Batson</i> challenge to a peremptory strike requires a three-step inquiry. First, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has made a prima facie showing that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge on the basis of race. 476 U.S., at 96-97. Second, if the showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to present a race-neutral explanation for striking the juror in question. <i>Id.,</i> at 97-98. Although the prosecutor must present a comprehensible reason, \"[t]he second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible\"; so long as the reason is not inherently discriminatory, it suffices. <i>Purkett</i> v. <i>Elem,</i> 514 U.S. 765, 767-768 (1995) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Third, the court must then determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. <i>Batson, supra,</i> at 98. This final step involves evaluating \"the persuasiveness of the justification\" proffered by the prosecutor, but \"the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\" <i>Purkett, supra,</i> at 768.</p>\n<p>On direct appeal in federal court, the credibility findings a trial court makes in a <i>Batson</i> inquiry are reviewed for clear error. <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 500 U.S. 352, 364-366 (1991) (plurality opinion) (holding that evaluation of a prosecutor's credibility \"lies `peculiarly within a trial judge's province'\"). Under AEDPA, however, a federal habeas court must find the state-court conclusion \"an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(2). Thus, a federal habeas court can only grant Collins' petition if it was unreasonable to credit the prosecutor's race-neutral explanations for the <i>Batson</i> challenge. State-court factual findings, moreover, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*339</span> are presumed correct; the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption by \"clear and convincing evidence.\" ยง 2254(e)(1). See <i>Miller-El</i> v. <i>Dretke,</i> 545 U.S. 231, 240 (2005). Although the Ninth Circuit assumed ยง 2254(e)(1)'s presumption applied in this case, 365 F.3d, at 677, the parties disagree about whether and when it does. We need not address that question. Even assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that only ยง 2254(d)(2) applied in this proceeding, the state-court decision was not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court.</p>\n<p>Because the California Court of Appeal accepted the trial court's credibility finding, the panel majority inquired whether the appellate court made an unreasonable factual determination. See <i>id.,</i> at 682. The panel majority's analysis and conclusions, however, depended entirely on its view of the trial court's credibility holding. The panel majority found no error in the trial court's proceedings or rulings in the first two steps of the <i>Batson</i> inquiry. 365 F.3d, at 677-678. It disagreed, however, with the trial court's conclusions on the third step, holding that it was unreasonable to accept the prosecutor's explanation that Juror 16 was excused on account of her youth and her demeanor. <i>Id.,</i> at 678-687. We conclude the Ninth Circuit erred, for the trial court's credibility determination was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Noting that the trial court had not witnessed Juror 16's purported eye rolling, the panel majority concluded that no reasonable factfinder could have accepted the prosecutor's rendition of the alleged incident because the prosecutor's conduct completely undermined her credibility. <i>Id.,</i> at 683. Having before it only the trial court record, the Court of Appeals majority drew this conclusion based on three considerations: first, the prosecutor's erroneous statement concerning another prospective African-American juror's age; second, the prosecutor's improper attempt to use gender as a basis for exclusion; and third, the majority's skepticism toward <span class=\"star-pagination\">*340</span> the prosecutor's explanation that she struck Juror 16 in part because of her youth and lack of ties to the community. <i>Id.,</i> at 683-684.</p>\n<p>The first reason the panel majority noted for rejecting the trial court's credibility finding pertained not to Juror 16, the subject of Collins' claim on appeal, but to another prospective African-American juror, Juror 19. The prosecutor referred to Juror 19 as \"young\" even though she was a grandmother. This reference to youth took place during a discussion about three prospective jurors, Jurors 6, 16, and 19. Jurors 6 and 16 were both young. As Judge Hall observed, it is quite plausible that the prosecutor simply misspoke with respect to a juror's numerical designation, an error defense counsel may also have committed. <i>Id.,</i> at 688; 2 App. 9. It is a tenuous inference to say that an accidental reference with respect to one juror, Juror 19, undermines the prosecutor's credibility with respect to Juror 16. Seizing on what can plausibly be viewed as an innocent transposition makes little headway toward the conclusion that the prosecutor's explanation was clearly not credible.</p>\n<p>Second, the panel majority concluded that the trial court should have questioned the prosecutor's credibility because of her \"attempt to use gender as a race-neutral basis for excluding Jurors 016 and 019.\" 365 F.3d, at 684. Respondent's trial occurred in August 1996, over two years after our decision in <i>J. E. B.</i> v. <i>Alabama ex rel. T. B.,</i> 511 U.S. 127 (1994), made clear that discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender violates the Equal Protection Clause. Although the record contains a somewhat confusing colloquy on this point, it can be read as indicating that one of the prosecutor's aims in striking Juror 16 was achieving gender balance on the jury. Concerned about the constitutionality of such a strike, the trial court made clear that it would not accept gender as a race-neutral explanation. The panel majority assigned the gender justification more weight than it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*341</span> can bear. The prosecutor provided a number of other permissible and plausible race-neutral reasons, and Collins provides no argument why this portion of the colloquy demonstrates that a reasonable factfinder must conclude the prosecutor lied about the eye rolling and struck Juror 16 based on her race.</p>\n<p>Finally, the panel majority believed to be unsupportable the prosecutor's stated concern that Juror 16 might, as a young and single citizen with no ties to the community, be too tolerant of the crime with which respondent was charged. 365 F.3d, at 680-682, 684. This was so, the majority concluded, because during <i>voir dire</i> Juror 16 replied affirmatively when asked if she believed the crime with which respondent was charged should be illegal and disclaimed any other reason she could not be impartial. <i>Id.,</i> at 680. That the prosecutor claimed to hold such concerns despite Juror 16's <i>voir dire</i> averments does not establish that she offered a pretext. It is not unreasonable to believe the prosecutor remained worried that a young person with few ties to the community might be less willing than an older, more permanent resident to impose a lengthy sentence for possessing a small amount of a controlled substance. Accord, <i>id.,</i> at 690 (Hall, J., dissenting). Even if the prosecutor was overly cautious in this regard, her wariness of the young and the rootless could be seen as race neutral, for she used a peremptory strike on a white male juror, Juror 6, with the same characteristics. 2 App. 5, 14.</p>\n<p>Viewing the panel majority's concerns together, the most generous reading would suggest only that the trial court had reason to question the prosecutor's credibility regarding Juror 16's alleged improper demeanor. That does not, however, compel the conclusion that the trial court had no permissible alternative but to reject the prosecutor's race-neutral justifications and conclude Collins had shown a <i>Batson</i> violation. Reasonable minds reviewing the record <span class=\"star-pagination\">*342</span> might disagree about the prosecutor's credibility, but on habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court's credibility determination.</p>\n<p>The panel majority did not stop at the conclusion that the trial court rendered an unreasonable factual determination in light of the evidence presented. It further concluded that the state courts had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law as determined by this Court. 365 F.3d, at 679; 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1). The question whether a state court errs in determining the facts is a different question from whether it errs in applying the law. In this case there is no demonstration that either the trial court or the California Court of Appeal acted contrary to clearly established federal law in recognizing and applying <i>Batson</i>'s burden-framework. See 2 App. 14-15; App. H to Pet. for Cert. 114-116. The only question, as we have noted, is whether the trial court's factual determination at <i>Batson</i>'s third step was unreasonable. For the reasons discussed above, we conclude it was not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The panel majority's attempt to use a set of debatable inferences to set aside the conclusion reached by the state court does not satisfy AEDPA's requirements for granting a writ of habeas corpus. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>Twenty years ago Justice Thurgood Marshall warned that the test of <i>Batson</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 79 (1986), would fail to ferret out unconstitutional discrimination in the selection of jurors. <i>Id.,</i> at 102-103 (concurring opinion) (\"The decision today will not end the racial discrimination that peremptories inject into the jury-selection process\"). In my view, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*343</span> history has proved Justice Marshall right. See <i>Miller-El</i> v. <i>Dretke,</i> 545 U.S. 231, 266-267 (2005) (BREYER, J., concurring). And today's case, like <i>Miller-El,</i> helps to illustrate <i>Batson</i>'s fundamental failings.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the prosecutor's inability in this case to provide a clear explanation of why she exercised her peremptory challenges may well reflect the more general fact that the exercise of a peremptory challenge can rest upon instinct not reason. Insofar as <i>Batson</i> asks prosecutors to explain the unexplainable, how can it succeed? <i>Miller-El,</i> 545 U.S., at 267-268 (BREYER, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>For another thing, the trial judge's uncertainty about the legal validity of the exercise of peremptory challenges in this case may reflect the more general fact that, sometimes, no one, not even the lawyer herself, can be certain whether a decision to exercise a peremptory challenge rests upon an impermissible racial, religious, gender-based, or ethnic stereotype. <i>Ibid.</i> See also <i>Batson, supra,</i> at 106 (Marshall, J., concurring) (noting unconscious internalization of racial stereotypes). How can trial judges second-guess an instinctive judgment the underlying basis for which may be a form of stereotyping invisible even to the prosecutor? <i>Miller-El, supra,</i> at 267-268 (Breyer, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Finally, the case before us makes clear that ordinary mechanisms of judicial review cannot ensure <i>Batson</i>'s effectiveness. The reasons are structural. The trial judge is best placed to consider the factors that underlie credibility: demeanor, context, and atmosphere. And the trial judge is best placed to determine whether, in a borderline case, a prosecutor's hesitation or contradiction reflect (a) deception, or (b) the difficulty of providing a rational reason for an instinctive decision. Appellate judges cannot on the basis of a cold record easily second-guess a trial judge's decision about likely motivation. These circumstances mean that appellate courts will, and must, grant the trial courts considerable leeway in applying <i>Batson.</i> See <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>New</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> <i>York,</i> 500 U.S. 352 (1991). As the present case illustrates, considerations of federalism require federal habeas courts to show yet further deference to state-court judgments. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(2) (state-court factual determination must stand unless \"unreasonable\").</p>\n<p>The upshot is an unresolvable tension between, on the one hand, what Blackstone called an inherently \"`arbitrary and capricious'\" peremptory challenge system, <i>Miller-El, supra,</i> at 272 (Breyer, J., concurring) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 346 (1769)), and, on the other hand, the Constitution's nondiscrimination command. Given this constitutional tension, we may have to choose. <i>Miller-El, supra,</i> at 273 (Breyer, J., concurring); <i>Swain</i> v. <i>Alabama,</i> 380 U.S. 202, 244 (1965) (Goldberg, J., dissenting) (\"Were it necessary to make an absolute choice between the right of a defendant to have a jury chosen in conformity with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and the right to challenge peremptorily, the Constitution compels a choice of the former\"); <i>Batson, supra,</i> at 107 (Marshall, J., concurring) (same).</p>\n<p>I have argued that legal life without peremptories is no longer unthinkable. <i>Miller-El, supra,</i> at 272 (concurring opinion) (citing, <i>inter alia,</i> the experience of England). I continue to believe that we should reconsider <i>Batson</i>'s test and the peremptory challenge system as a whole. Nonetheless, because the Court correctly applies the present legal framework, I concur in its opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the State of Arizona et al. by <i>Brian Sandoval,</i> Attorney General of Nevada, <i>David K.

Although the prosecutor must present a comprehensible reason, \"[t]he second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible\"; so long as the reason is not inherently discriminatory, it suffices. <i>Purkett</i> v. <i>Elem,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117934\"><a href=\"/opinion/117934/purkett-v-elem/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 767-768 (1995) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Third, the court must then determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. <i>Batson, supra,</i> at 98. This final step involves evaluating \"the persuasiveness of the justification\" proffered by the prosecutor, but \"the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\" <i>Purkett, supra,</i> at 768.</p>\n<p>On direct appeal in federal court, the credibility findings a trial court makes in a <i>Batson</i> inquiry are reviewed for clear error. <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112601\"><a href=\"/opinion/112601/hernandez-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 364-366 (1991) (plurality opinion) (holding that evaluation of a prosecutor's credibility \"lies `peculiarly within a trial judge's province'\"). Under AEDPA, however, a federal habeas court must find the state-court conclusion \"an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(2). Thus, a federal habeas court can only grant Collins' petition if it was unreasonable to credit the prosecutor's race-neutral explanations for the <i>Batson</i> challenge. State-court factual findings, moreover, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*339</span> are presumed correct; the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption by \"clear and convincing evidence.\" ยง 2254(e)(1). See <i>Miller-El</i> v. <i>Dretke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799976\"><a href=\"/opinion/799976/miller-el-v-dretke/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 240 (2005). Although the Ninth Circuit assumed ยง 2254(e)(1)'s presumption applied in this case, 365 F.3d, at 677, the parties disagree about whether and when it does. We need not address that question. Even assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that only ยง 2254(d)(2) applied in this proceeding, the state-court decision was not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court.</p>\n<p>Because the California Court of Appeal accepted the trial court's credibility finding, the panel majority inquired whether the appellate court made an unreasonable factual determination. See <i>id.,</i> at 682. The panel majority's analysis and conclusions, however, depended entirely on its view of the trial court's credibility holding. The panel majority found no error in the trial court's proceedings or rulings in the first two steps of the <i>Batson</i> inquiry. 365 F.3d, at 677-678. It disagreed, however, with the trial court's conclusions on the third step, holding that it was unreasonable to accept the prosecutor's explanation that Juror 16 was excused on account of her youth and her demeanor. <i>Id.,</i> at 678-687. We conclude the Ninth Circuit erred, for the trial court's credibility determination was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Noting that the trial court had not witnessed Juror 16's purported eye rolling, the panel majority concluded that no reasonable factfinder could have accepted the prosecutor's rendition of the alleged incident because the prosecutor's conduct completely undermined her credibility. <i>Id.,</i> at 683. Having before it only the trial court record, the Court of Appeals majority drew this conclusion based on three considerations: first, the prosecutor's erroneous statement concerning another prospective African-American juror's age; second, the prosecutor's improper attempt to use gender as a basis for exclusion; and third, the majority's skepticism toward <span class=\"star-pagination\">*340</span> the prosecutor's explanation that she struck Juror 16 in part because of her youth and lack of ties to the community. <i>Id.,</i> at 683-684.</p>\n<p>The first reason the panel majority noted for rejecting the trial court's credibility finding pertained not to Juror 16, the subject of Collins' claim on appeal, but to another prospective African-American juror, Juror 19. The prosecutor referred to Juror 19 as \"young\" even though she was a grandmother. This reference to youth took place during a discussion about three prospective jurors, Jurors 6, 16, and 19. Jurors 6 and 16 were both young. As Judge Hall observed, it is quite plausible that the prosecutor simply misspoke with respect to a juror's numerical designation, an error defense counsel may also have committed. <i>Id.,</i> at 688; 2 App. 9. It is a tenuous inference to say that an accidental reference with respect to one juror, Juror 19, undermines the prosecutor's credibility with respect to Juror 16. Seizing on what can plausibly be viewed as an innocent transposition makes little headway toward the conclusion that the prosecutor's explanation was clearly not credible.</p>\n<p>Second, the panel majority concluded that the trial court should have questioned the prosecutor's credibility because of her \"attempt to use gender as a race-neutral basis for excluding Jurors 016 and 019.\" 365 F.3d, at 684. Respondent's trial occurred in August 1996, over two years after our decision in <i>J. E. B.</i> v. <i>Alabama ex rel. T. B.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117836\"><a href=\"/opinion/117836/jeb-v-alabama-ex-rel-tb/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span> (1994), made clear that discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender violates the Equal Protection Clause. Although the record contains a somewhat confusing colloquy on this point, it can be read as indicating that one of the prosecutor's aims in striking Juror 16 was achieving gender balance on the jury. Concerned about the constitutionality of such a strike, the trial court made clear that it would not accept gender as a race-neutral explanation. The panel majority assigned the gender justification more weight than it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*341</span> can bear. The prosecutor provided a number of other permissible and plausible race-neutral reasons, and Collins provides no argument why this portion of the colloquy demonstrates that a reasonable factfinder must conclude the prosecutor lied about the eye rolling and struck Juror 16 based on her race.</p>\n<p>Finally, the panel majority believed to be unsupportable the prosecutor's stated concern that Juror 16 might, as a young and single citizen with no ties to the community, be too tolerant of the crime with which respondent was charged. 365 F.3d, at 680-682, 684. This was so, the majority concluded, because during <i>voir dire</i> Juror 16 replied affirmatively when asked if she believed the crime with which respondent was charged should be illegal and disclaimed any other reason she could not be impartial. <i>Id.,</i> at 680. That the prosecutor claimed to hold such concerns despite Juror 16's <i>voir dire</i> averments does not establish that she offered a pretext. It is not unreasonable to believe the prosecutor remained worried that a young person with few ties to the community might be less willing than an older, more permanent resident to impose a lengthy sentence for possessing a small amount of a controlled substance. Accord, <i>id.,</i> at 690 (Hall, J., dissenting). Even if the prosecutor was overly cautious in this regard, her wariness of the young and the rootless could be seen as race neutral, for she used a peremptory strike on a white male juror, Juror 6, with the same characteristics. 2 App. 5, 14.</p>\n<p>Viewing the panel majority's concerns together, the most generous reading would suggest only that the trial court had reason to question the prosecutor's credibility regarding Juror 16's alleged improper demeanor. That does not, however, compel the conclusion that the trial court had no permissible alternative but to reject the prosecutor's race-neutral justifications and conclude Collins had shown a <i>Batson</i> violation. Reasonable minds reviewing the record <span class=\"star-pagination\">*342</span> might disagree about the prosecutor's credibility, but on habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court's credibility determination.</p>\n<p>The panel majority did not stop at the conclusion that the trial court rendered an unreasonable factual determination in light of the evidence presented. It further concluded that the state courts had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law as determined by this Court. 365 F.3d, at 679; 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1). The question whether a state court errs in determining the facts is a different question from whether it errs in applying the law. In this case there is no demonstration that either the trial court or the California Court of Appeal acted contrary to clearly established federal law in recognizing and applying <i>Batson</i>'s burden-framework. See 2 App. 14-15; App. H to Pet. for Cert. 114-116. The only question, as we have noted, is whether the trial court's factual determination at <i>Batson</i>'s third step was unreasonable. For the reasons discussed above, we conclude it was not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The panel majority's attempt to use a set of debatable inferences to set aside the conclusion reached by the state court does not satisfy AEDPA's requirements for granting a writ of habeas corpus. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>Twenty years ago Justice Thurgood Marshall warned that the test of <i>Batson</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span> (1986), would fail to ferret out unconstitutional discrimination in the selection of jurors. <i>Id.,</i> at 102-103 (concurring opinion) (\"The decision today will not end the racial discrimination that peremptories inject into the jury-selection process\"). In my view, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*343</span> history has proved Justice Marshall right. See <i>Miller-El</i> v. <i>Dretke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799976\"><a href=\"/opinion/799976/miller-el-v-dretke/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 266-267 (2005) (BREYER, J., concurring). And today's case, like <i>Miller-El,</i> helps to illustrate <i>Batson</i>'s fundamental failings.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the prosecutor's inability in this case to provide a clear explanation of why she exercised her peremptory challenges may well reflect the more general fact that the exercise of a peremptory challenge can rest upon instinct not reason. Insofar as <i>Batson</i> asks prosecutors to explain the unexplainable, how can it succeed? <i>Miller-El,</i> 545 U.S., at 267-268 (BREYER, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>For another thing, the trial judge's uncertainty about the legal validity of the exercise of peremptory challenges in this case may reflect the more general fact that, sometimes, no one, not even the lawyer herself, can be certain whether a decision to exercise a peremptory challenge rests upon an impermissible racial, religious, gender-based, or ethnic stereotype. <i>Ibid.</i> See also <i>Batson, supra,</i> at 106 (Marshall, J., concurring) (noting unconscious internalization of racial stereotypes). How can trial judges second-guess an instinctive judgment the underlying basis for which may be a form of stereotyping invisible even to the prosecutor? <i>Miller-El, supra,</i> at 267-268 (Breyer, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Finally, the case before us makes clear that ordinary mechanisms of judicial review cannot ensure <i>Batson</i>'s effectiveness. The reasons are structural. The trial judge is best placed to consider the factors that underlie credibility: demeanor, context, and atmosphere. And the trial judge is best placed to determine whether, in a borderline case, a prosecutor's hesitation or contradiction reflect (a) deception, or (b) the difficulty of providing a rational reason for an instinctive decision. Appellate judges cannot on the basis of a cold record easily second-guess a trial judge's decision about likely motivation. These circumstances mean that appellate courts will, and must, grant the trial courts considerable leeway in applying <i>Batson.</i> See <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>New</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> <i>York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112601\"><a href=\"/opinion/112601/hernandez-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span> (1991). As the present case illustrates, considerations of federalism require federal habeas courts to show yet further deference to state-court judgments. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(2) (state-court factual determination must stand unless \"unreasonable\").</p>\n<p>The upshot is an unresolvable tension between, on the one hand, what Blackstone called an inherently \"`arbitrary and capricious'\" peremptory challenge system, <i>Miller-El, supra,</i> at 272 (Breyer, J., concurring) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 346 (1769)), and, on the other hand, the Constitution's nondiscrimination command. Given this constitutional tension, we may have to choose. <i>Miller-El, supra,</i> at 273 (Breyer, J., concurring); <i>Swain</i> v. <i>Alabama,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106997\"><a href=\"/opinion/106997/swain-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, 244 (1965) (Goldberg, J., dissenting) (\"Were it necessary to make an absolute choice between the right of a defendant to have a jury chosen in conformity with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and the right to challenge peremptorily, the Constitution compels a choice of the former\"); <i>Batson, supra,</i> at 107 (Marshall, J., concurring) (same).</p>\n<p>I have argued that legal life without peremptories is no longer unthinkable. <i>Miller-El, supra,</i> at 272 (concurring opinion) (citing, <i>inter alia,</i> the experience of England). I continue to believe that we should reconsider <i>Batson</i>'s test and the peremptory challenge system as a whole. Nonetheless, because the Court correctly applies the present legal framework, I concur in its opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the State of Arizona et al. by <i>Brian Sandoval,</i> Attorney General of Nevada, <i>David K.

COLLINS\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\r\n\r\n   No. 04โ52. Argued December 5, 2005โDecided January 18, 2006\r\nAfter the prosecutor struck a young, African-American woman, Juror\r\n  16, from the panel at respondent Collinsโ state-court drug trial,\r\n  Collins objected that the strike was made on account of Juror 16โs\r\n  race. As race-neutral explanations for the strike, the prosecutor said\r\n  that Juror 16 had rolled her eyes in response to a question from the\r\n  court; that she was young and might be too tolerant of a drug crime;\r\n  and that she was single and lacked ties to the community. In reject-\r\n  ing Collinsโ challenge, the trial court declared that it did not observe\r\n  the complained-of demeanor by Juror 16, but noted that she was\r\n  youthful, as was a white male juror also dismissed by peremptory\r\n  challenge, and stated it would give the prosecutor โthe benefit of the\r\n  doubt.โ The prosecutor had also referred to Juror 16โs gender in ex-\r\n  plaining the strike, but the trial court disallowed any reliance on that\r\n  ground. The California Court of Appeal upheld the conviction and\r\n  the trial courtโs ruling on the peremptory challenge, finding that the\r\n  prosecutor permissibly excluded Juror 16 based on her youth. Even if\r\n  youth was not a legitimate reason to exercise a peremptory challenge,\r\n  said the court, Juror 16โs demeanor supported the strike; nothing in\r\n  the record suggested the trial court failed to conduct a searching in-\r\n  quiry of the prosecutorโs reasons for striking her. The California Su-\r\n  preme Court denied review. The Federal District Court dismissed\r\n  Collinsโ habeas petition with prejudice, but the Ninth Circuit re-\r\n  versed and remanded, concluding that, under the Antiterrorism and\r\n  Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the State Court of Ap-\r\n  pealโs affirmance was based on an unreasonable factual determina-\r\n  tion in light of the evidence presented at trial.\r\nHeld: The Ninth Circuitโs attempt to use a set of debatable inferences to\r\n set aside the state courtโs conclusion does not satisfy AEDPAโs re-\r\n2                            RICE v.

S. 79, 98, a defendantโs chal-\r\n    lenge to a peremptory strike allegedly based on race requires, inter\r\n    alia, that the trial court determine whether the defendant has car-\r\n    ried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. This involves\r\n    evaluating โthe persuasiveness of the [prosecutorโs proffered] justifi-\r\n    cationโ for the strike, but โthe ultimate burden of persuasion regard-\r\n    ing racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent\r\n    of the strike.โ Purkett v. Elem, 514 U. S. 765, 768. Because, under\r\n    AEDPA, a federal habeas court must find the state-court conclusion\r\n    โan unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\r\n    presented in the State court proceeding,โ 28 U. S. C. ยง2254(d)(2), a\r\n    federal court can only grant Collinsโ petition if it was unreasonable to\r\n    credit the prosecutorโs race-neutral explanations for the Batson chal-\r\n    lenge. Pp. 3โ4.\r\n       (b) Though the Ninth Circuit recited the proper standard of review,\r\n    it improperly substituted its evaluation of the record for that of the\r\n    state trial court, which, under ยง2254(d)(2), did not make an unrea-\r\n    sonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\r\n    Noting that the trial court had not witnessed Juror 16โs purported\r\n    eye rolling, the Ninth Circuit concluded that no reasonable factfinder\r\n    could have accepted the prosecutorโs rendition of the alleged incident\r\n    because the prosecutor had completely undermined her own credibil-\r\n    ity based on three considerations: her erroneous statement that an-\r\n    other prospective African-American juror, Juror 19, was โyoungโ\r\n    when, in fact, she was a grandmother; the prosecutorโs improper at-\r\n    tempt to use gender as a basis for exclusion; and the Court of Ap-\r\n    pealsโ skepticism toward the prosecutorโs explanation that she struck\r\n    Juror 16 in part because of her youth and lack of ties to the commu-\r\n    nity. As to the first reason, because the prosecutorโs reference to Ju-\r\n    ror 19โs youth occurred during a discussion of three prospective ju-\r\n    rors, two of whom were, indeed, young, it is quite plausible that the\r\n    prosecutor simply misspoke. It is a tenuous inference to say that an\r\n    accidental reference with respect to one juror undermines the prose-\r\n    cutorโs credibility with respect to another. Second, the Ninth Circuit\r\n    assigned the prosecutorโs reference to Juror 16โs gender more weight\r\n    than it can bear, given that the prosecutor provided a number of\r\n    other permissible and plausible race-neutral reasons for excluding\r\n    her. Collins provides no argument why this matter demonstrates\r\n    that a reasonable factfinder must conclude the prosecutor lied about\r\n    the eye rolling and struck Juror 16 based on her race. Finally, even if\r\n    the prosecutorโs concerns about Juror 16โs youth and lack of commu-\r\n    nity ties were overly cautious, her wariness could be seen as race\r\n    neutral, for she used a peremptory strike on a white male juror, Ju-\r\n                     Cite as: 546 U.

Viewing the foregoing concerns\r\n  together, the most generous reading would suggest only that the trial\r\n  court had reason to question the prosecutorโs credibility regarding\r\n  Juror 16โs alleged improper demeanor. That does not, however, com-\r\n  pel the conclusion that the trial court had no permissible alternative\r\n  but to reject the prosecutorโs race-neutral justifications and conclude\r\n  Collins had shown a Batson violation.

Our review confirms that\r\nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erred, misap-\r\nplying settled rules that limit its role and authority.\r\n                              I\r\n  After a 4-day trial in the Superior Court of California for\r\nthe County of Los Angeles, a jury convicted Steven Martell\r\nCollins on one count of possessing cocaine with intent to\r\ndistribute. The conviction was all the more serious be-\r\ncause it subjected him to Californiaโs three strikes rule for\r\nsentencing. The question at issue in this federal habeas\r\ncorpus action, however, is the California courtsโ rejection\r\nof Collinsโ argument that the prosecutor struck a young,\r\nAfrican-American woman, Juror 16, from the panel on\r\naccount of her race. A second African-American juror was\r\nalso the subject of a peremptory strike, and although\r\nCollins challenged that strike in the trial court, on appeal\r\nhe objected only to the excusal of Juror 16.\r\n2                     RICE v. COLLINS\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Even prior to this Courtโs decision in Batson v. Ken-\r\ntucky, 476 U.

S. ___\r\n(2005), disapproved of the manner in which Wheeler and\r\nBatson were implemented in some California cases, the\r\nstate courts in this case used the correct analytical frame-\r\nwork in considering and ruling upon the objection to the\r\nprosecutorial strike.\r\n   As race-neutral explanations for striking Juror 16, the\r\nprosecutor said that Juror 16 had rolled her eyes in re-\r\nsponse to a question from the court; that Juror 16 was\r\nyoung and might be too tolerant of a drug crime; and that\r\nJuror 16 was single and lacked ties to the community. A\r\nfurther, more troubling part of the prosecutorโs unorgan-\r\nized explanation was her reference to Juror 16โs gender.\r\nThe trial court, correctly, disallowed any reliance on that\r\nground. The trial court, furthermore, which had the bene-\r\nfit of observing the prosecutor firsthand over the course of\r\nthe proceedings, rejected Collinsโ challenge.\r\n    โWith regard to 016, the court, frankly, did not ob-\r\n    serve the demeanor of Ms. 016 that was complained of\r\n    by the District Attorney; however, Ms. 016 was a\r\n    youthful person, as was [a white male juror the prose-\r\n    cutor also dismissed by peremptory challenge]. And\r\n    one or more prospective jurors also. The Court is pre-\r\n    pared to give the District Attorney the benefit of the\r\n    doubt as to Ms. 016.โ 2 App. 14โ15.\r\n  The California Court of Appeal upheld the conviction\r\nand the trial courtโs ruling on the peremptory challenge.\r\nPeople v. Collins, No. B106939 (Dec. 12, 1997), App. to Pet.\r\nfor Cert. 112โ117. In its view, youth was a legitimate\r\nreason to exercise a peremptory challenge; and, even if it\r\nwere not, Juror 16โs demeanor also supported the strike.\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nId., at 116. According to its review of the record, nothing\r\nsuggested the trial court failed to conduct a searching\r\ninquiry of the prosecutorโs reasons for striking Juror 16.\r\nId., at 116โ117. The appeals court thus upheld the trial\r\ncourtโs ultimate conclusion to credit the prosecutor. Ibid.\r\nWithout comment, the Supreme Court of California denied\r\nCollinsโ petition for review. Id., at 96.\r\n   Collins sought collateral relief on this claim in federal\r\ncourt. The United States District Court for the Central\r\nDistrict of California dismissed with prejudice Collinsโ\r\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus. Id., at 91. A divided\r\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re-\r\nversed and remanded with instructions to grant the peti-\r\ntion. 348 F. 3d 1082 (2003), amended and superseded by\r\n365 F. 3d 667 (2004). Noting that the Antiterrorism and\r\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) governed\r\nCollinsโ petition, the panel majority concluded that it was\r\nan unreasonable factual determination to credit the prose-\r\ncutorโs race-neutral reasons for striking Juror 16. Id., at\r\n679. Judge Hall dissented, id., at 687โ691; and later, over\r\nthe dissent of five judges, the Court of Appeals declined to\r\nrehear the case en banc, id., at 670โ673. Though it recited\r\nthe proper standard of review, the panel majority improp-\r\nerly substituted its evaluation of the record for that of the\r\nstate trial court. We granted the petition for certiorari,\r\n545 U. S. ___ (2005), and now reverse.\r\n                             II\r\n  A defendantโs Batson challenge to a peremptory strike\r\nrequires a three-step inquiry. First, the trial court must\r\ndetermine whether the defendant has made a prima facie\r\nshowing that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory chal-\r\nlenge on the basis of race. 476 U. S., at 96โ97. Second, if\r\nthe showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to\r\npresent a race-neutral explanation for striking the juror in\r\nquestion. Id., at 97โ98. Although the prosecutor must\r\n4                     RICE v. COLLINS\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npresent a comprehensible reason, โ[t]he second step of this\r\nprocess does not demand an explanation that is persua-\r\nsive, or even plausibleโ; so long as the reason is not inher-\r\nently discriminatory, it suffices. Purkett v. Elem, 514 U. S.\r\n765, 767โ768 (1995) (per curiam). Third, the court must\r\nthen determine whether the defendant has carried his\r\nburden of proving purposeful discrimination. Batson,\r\nsupra, at 98; Miller-El v. Dretke, 545 U. S. ___, ___ (2005)\r\n(slip op., at 18). This final step involves evaluating โthe\r\npersuasiveness of the justificationโ proffered by the prose-\r\ncutor, but โthe ultimate burden of persuasion regarding\r\nracial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the\r\nopponent of the strike.โ Purkett, supra, at 768.\r\n   On direct appeal in federal court, the credibility findings\r\na trial court makes in a Batson inquiry are reviewed for\r\nclear error. Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 364โ\r\n366 (1991) (plurality opinion) (holding that evaluation of a\r\nprosecutorโs credibility โlies โpeculiarly within a trial\r\njudgeโs provinceโ โ). Under AEDPA, however, a federal\r\nhabeas court must find the state-court conclusion โan\r\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\r\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.โ 28\r\nU. S. C. ยง2254(d)(2). Thus, a federal habeas court can only\r\ngrant Collinsโ petition if it was unreasonable to credit the\r\nprosecutorโs race-neutral explanations for the Batson\r\nchallenge. State-court factual findings, moreover, are\r\npresumed correct; the petitioner has the burden of rebut-\r\nting the presumption by โclear and convincing evidence.โ\r\nยง2254(e)(1). See Miller-El, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6).\r\nAlthough the Ninth Circuit assumed ยง2254(e)(1)โs pre-\r\nsumption applied in this case, 365 F. 3d, at 677, the par-\r\nties disagree about whether and when it does. We need\r\nnot address that question. Even assuming, arguendo, that\r\nonly ยง2254(d)(2) applied in this proceeding, the state-court\r\ndecision was not an unreasonable determination of the\r\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the state court.\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Because the California Court of Appeal accepted the\r\ntrial courtโs credibility finding, the panel majority inquired\r\nwhether the appellate court made an unreasonable factual\r\ndetermination. See id., at 682. The panel majorityโs\r\nanalysis and conclusions, however, depended entirely on\r\nits view of the trial courtโs credibility holding. The panel\r\nmajority found no error in the trial courtโs proceedings or\r\nrulings in the first two steps of the Batson inquiry. 365\r\nF. 3d, at 677โ678. It disagreed, however, with the trial\r\ncourtโs conclusions on the third step, holding that it was\r\nunreasonable to accept the prosecutorโs explanation that\r\nJuror 16 was excused on account of her youth and her\r\ndemeanor. Id., at 678โ687. We conclude the Ninth Cir-\r\ncuit erred, for the trial courtโs credibility determination\r\nwas not unreasonable.\r\n   Noting that the trial court had not witnessed Juror 16โs\r\npurported eye rolling, the panel majority concluded that\r\nno reasonable factfinder could have accepted the prosecu-\r\ntorโs rendition of the alleged incident because the prosecu-\r\ntorโs conduct completely undermined her credibility. Id.,\r\nat 683. Having before it only the trial court record, the\r\nCourt of Appeals majority drew this conclusion based on\r\nthree considerations: first, the prosecutorโs erroneous\r\nstatement concerning another prospective African-\r\nAmerican jurorโs age; second, the prosecutorโs improper\r\nattempt to use gender as a basis for exclusion; and third,\r\nthe majorityโs skepticism toward the prosecutorโs explana-\r\ntion that she struck Juror 16 in part because of her youth\r\nand lack of ties to the community. Id., at 683โ684.\r\n   The first reason the panel majority noted for rejecting\r\nthe trial courtโs credibility finding pertained not to Juror\r\n16, the subject of Collinsโ claim on appeal, but to another\r\nprospective African-American juror, Juror 19. The prose-\r\ncutor referred to Juror 19 as โyoungโ even though she was\r\na grandmother. This reference to youth took place during\r\na discussion about three prospective jurors, Jurors 6, 16,\r\n6                     RICE v. COLLINS\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nand 19. Jurors 6 and 16 were both young. As Judge Hall\r\nobserved, it is quite plausible that the prosecutor simply\r\nmisspoke with respect to a jurorโs numerical designation,\r\nan error defense counsel may also have committed. Id., at\r\n688; 2 App. 9. It is a tenuous inference to say that an\r\naccidental reference with respect to one juror, Juror 19,\r\nundermines the prosecutorโs credibility with respect to\r\nJuror 16. Seizing on what can plausibly be viewed as an\r\ninnocent transposition makes little headway toward the\r\nconclusion that the prosecutorโs explanation was clearly\r\nnot credible.\r\n   Second, the panel majority concluded that the trial court\r\nshould have questioned the prosecutorโs credibility be-\r\ncause of her โattempt to use gender as a race-neutral basis\r\nfor excluding Jurors 016 and 019.โ 365 F. 3d, at 684.\r\nRespondentโs trial occurred in August 1996, over two years\r\nafter our decision in J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511\r\nU. S. 127 (1994), made clear that discrimination in jury\r\nselection on the basis of gender violates the Equal Protec-\r\ntion Clause. Although the record contains a somewhat\r\nconfusing colloquy on this point, it can be read as indicat-\r\ning that one of the prosecutorโs aims in striking Juror 16\r\nwas achieving gender balance on the jury. Concerned\r\nabout the constitutionality of such a strike, the trial court\r\nmade clear that it would not accept gender as a race-\r\nneutral explanation. The panel majority assigned the\r\ngender justification more weight than it can bear. The\r\nprosecutor provided a number of other permissible and\r\nplausible race-neutral reasons, and Collins provides no\r\nargument why this portion of the colloquy demonstrates\r\nthat a reasonable factfinder must conclude the prosecutor\r\nlied about the eye rolling and struck Juror 16 based on her\r\nrace.\r\n   Finally, the panel majority believed to be unsupportable\r\nthe prosecutorโs stated concern that Juror 16 might, as a\r\nyoung and single citizen with no ties to the community, be\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntoo tolerant of the crime with which respondent was\r\ncharged. 365 F. 3d, at 680โ682, 684. This was so, the\r\nmajority concluded, because during voir dire Juror 16\r\nreplied affirmatively when asked if she believed the crime\r\nwith which respondent was charged should be illegal and\r\ndisclaimed any other reason she could not be impartial.\r\nId., at 680. That the prosecutor claimed to hold such\r\nconcerns despite Juror 16โs voir dire averments does not\r\nestablish that she offered a pretext. It is not unreasonable\r\nto believe the prosecutor remained worried that a young\r\nperson with few ties to the community might be less will-\r\ning than an older, more permanent resident to impose a\r\nlengthy sentence for possessing a small amount of a con-\r\ntrolled substance. Accord, id., at 690 (Hall, J., dissenting).\r\nEven if the prosecutor was overly cautious in this regard,\r\nher wariness of the young and the rootless could be seen\r\nas race neutral, for she used a peremptory strike on a\r\nwhite male juror, Juror 6, with the same characteristics.\r\n2 App. 5, 14.\r\n  Viewing the panel majorityโs concerns together, the\r\nmost generous reading would suggest only that the trial\r\ncourt had reason to question the prosecutorโs credibility\r\nregarding Juror 16โs alleged improper demeanor. That\r\ndoes not, however, compel the conclusion that the trial\r\ncourt had no permissible alternative but to reject the\r\nprosecutorโs race-neutral justifications and conclude\r\nCollins had shown a Batson violation. Reasonable minds\r\nreviewing the record might disagree about the prosecutorโs\r\ncredibility, but on habeas review that does not suffice to\r\nsupersede the trial courtโs credibility determination.\r\n  The panel majority did not stop at the conclusion that\r\nthe trial court rendered an unreasonable factual determi-\r\nnation in light of the evidence presented. It further con-\r\ncluded that the state courts had unreasonably applied\r\nclearly established federal law as determined by this\r\nCourt. 365 F. 3d, at 679; 28 U. S. C. ยง2254(d)(1). The\r\n8                     RICE v. COLLINS\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nquestion whether a state court errs in determining the\r\nfacts is a different question from whether it errs in apply-\r\ning the law. In this case there is no demonstration that\r\neither the trial court or the California Court of Appeal\r\nacted contrary to clearly established federal law in recog-\r\nnizing and applying Batsonโs burden-framework. See\r\n2 App. 14โ15; App. to Pet. for Cert. 114โ116. The only\r\nquestion, as we have noted, is whether the trial courtโs\r\nfactual determination at Batsonโs third step was unrea-\r\nsonable. For the reasons discussed above, we conclude it\r\nwas not.\r\n                             III\r\n  The panel majorityโs attempt to use a set of debatable\r\ninferences to set aside the conclusion reached by the state\r\ncourt does not satisfy AEDPAโs requirements for granting\r\na writ of habeas corpus. The judgment of the Court of\r\nAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n                                            It is so ordered.\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U.

Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986),\r\nwould fail to ferret out unconstitutional discrimination in\r\nthe selection of jurors. Id., at 102โ103 (concurring opin-\r\nion) (โThe decision today will not end the racial discrimi-\r\nnation that peremptories inject into the jury-selection\r\nprocessโ). In my view, history has proved Justice Mar-\r\nshall right. See Miller-El v. Dretke, 545 U. S. ___, ___\r\n(2005) (slip op., at 1) (BREYER, J., concurring). And todayโs\r\ncase, like Miller-El, helps to illustrate Batsonโs fundamen-\r\ntal failings.\r\n  For one thing, the prosecutorโs inability in this case to\r\nprovide a clear explanation of why she exercised her per-\r\nemptory challenges may well reflect the more general fact\r\nthat the exercise of a peremptory challenge can rest upon\r\ninstinct not reason. Insofar as Batson asks prosecutors to\r\nexplain the unexplainable, how can it succeed? Miller-El,\r\n545 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2โ3) (BREYER, J., concurring).\r\n  For another thing, the trial judgeโs uncertainty about\r\nthe legal validity of the exercise of peremptory challenges\r\nin this case may reflect the more general fact that, some-\r\ntimes, no one, not even the lawyer herself, can be certain\r\nwhether a decision to exercise a peremptory challenge\r\n2                     RICE v. COLLINS\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\r\n\r\nrests upon an impermissible racial, religious, gender-\r\nbased, or ethnic stereotype. Ibid. See also Batson, supra,\r\nat 106 (Marshall, J., concurring) (noting unconscious\r\ninternalization of racial stereotypes). How can trial judges\r\nsecond-guess an instinctive judgment the underlying basis\r\nfor which may be a form of stereotyping invisible even to\r\nthe prosecutor? Miller-El, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2)\r\n(BREYER, J., concurring).\r\n   Finally, the case before us makes clear that ordinary\r\nmechanisms of judicial review cannot assure Batsonโs\r\neffectiveness. The reasons are structural. The trial judge\r\nis best placed to consider the factors that underlie credibil-\r\nity: demeanor, context, and atmosphere. And the trial\r\njudge is best placed to determine whether, in a borderline\r\ncase, a prosecutorโs hesitation or contradiction reflect (a)\r\ndeception, or (b) the difficulty of providing a rational rea-\r\nson for an instinctive decision. Appellate judges cannot on\r\nthe basis of a cold record easily second-guess a trial judgeโs\r\ndecision about likely motivation. These circumstances\r\nmean that appellate courts will, and must, grant the trial\r\ncourts considerable leeway in applying Batson. See Her-\r\nnandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352 (1991). As the present\r\ncase illustrates, considerations of federalism require fed-\r\neral habeas courts to show yet further deference to state-\r\ncourt judgments. See 28 U. S. C. ยง2254(d)(2) (state-court\r\nfactual determination must stand unless โunreasonableโ).\r\n   The upshot is an unresolvable tension between, on the\r\none hand, what Blackstone called an inherently โ โarbi-\r\ntrary and capriciousโ โ peremptory challenge system,\r\nMiller-El, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (BREYER, J., concur-\r\nring) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\r\nLaws of England 346 (1769)), and, on the other hand, the\r\nConstitutionโs nondiscrimination command. Given this\r\nconstitutional tension, we may have to choose.
