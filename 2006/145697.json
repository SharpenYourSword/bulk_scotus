A \"`qualified individual with a disability'\" is defined as \"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*154</span> meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.\" § 12131(2). The Act defines \"`public entity'\" to include \"any State or local government\" and \"any department, agency, . . . or other instrumentality of a State,\" § 12131(1). We have previously held that this term includes state prisons. See <i>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections</i> v. <i>Yeskey,</i> 524 U.S. 206, 210 (1998). Title II authorizes suits by private citizens for money damages against public entities that violate § 12132. See 42 U.S.C. § 12133 (incorporating by reference 29 U.S.C. § 794a).</p>\n<p>In enacting the ADA, Congress \"invoke[d] the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(4). Moreover, the Act provides that \"[a] State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in [a] Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter.\" § 12202. We have accepted this latter statement as an unequivocal expression of Congress's intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity. See <i>Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.</i> v. <i>Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. 356, 363-364 (2001).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner in No. 04-1236, Tony Goodman, is a paraplegic inmate in the Georgia prison system who, at all relevant times, was housed at the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville. After filing numerous administrative grievances in the state prison system, Goodman filed a <i>pro se</i> complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia challenging the conditions of his confinement. He named as defendants the State of Georgia and the Georgia Department of Corrections (state defendants) and several individual prison officials. He brought claims under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, and other provisions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*155</span> not relevant here, seeking both injunctive relief and money damages against all defendants.</p>\n<p>Goodman's <i>pro se</i> complaint and subsequent filings in the District Court included many allegations, both grave and trivial, regarding the conditions of his confinement in the Reidsville prison. Among his more serious allegations, he claimed that he was confined for 23-to-24 hours per day in a 12-by-3-foot cell in which he could not turn his wheelchair around. He alleged that the lack of accessible facilities rendered him unable to use the toilet and shower without assistance, which was often denied. On multiple occasions, he asserted, he had injured himself in attempting to transfer from his wheelchair to the shower or toilet on his own, and, on several other occasions, he had been forced to sit in his own feces and urine while prison officials refused to assist him in cleaning up the waste. He also claimed that he had been denied physical therapy and medical treatment, and denied access to virtually all prison programs and services on account of his disability.</p>\n<p>The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation that the allegations in the complaint were vague and constituted insufficient notice pleading as to Goodman's § 1983 claims. It therefore dismissed the § 1983 claims against all defendants without providing Goodman an opportunity to amend his complaint. The District Court also dismissed his Title II claims against all individual defendants. Later, after our decision in <i>Garrett,</i> the District Court granted summary judgment to the state defendants on Goodman's Title II claims for money damages, holding that those claims were barred by state sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>Goodman appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The United States, petitioner in No. 04-1203, intervened to defend the constitutionality of Title II's abrogation of state sovereign immunity. The Eleventh Circuit determined that the District Court had erred in dismissing all of Goodman's § 1983 claims, because Goodman's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*156</span> multiple <i>pro se</i> filings in the District Court alleged facts sufficient to support \"a limited number of Eighth-Amendment claims under § 1983\" against certain individual defendants. App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-1236, p. 17a, judgt. order reported at 120 Fed. Appx. 785 (2004). The Court of Appeals held that the District Court should have given Goodman leave to amend his complaint to develop three Eighth Amendment claims relating to his conditions of confinement:</p>\n<blockquote>\"First, Goodman alleges that he is not able to move his wheelchair in his cell. If Goodman is to be believed, this effectively amounts to some form of total restraint twenty-three to twenty-four hours-a-day without penal justification. Second, Goodman has alleged several instances in which he was forced to sit in his own bodily waste because prison officials refused to provide assistance. Third, Goodman has alleged sufficient conduct to proceed with a § 1983 claim based on the prison staff's supposed `deliberate indifference' to his serious medical condition of being partially paraplegic . . . .\" App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-1236, pp. 18a-19a (citation and footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>The court remanded the suit to the District Court to permit Goodman to amend his complaint, while cautioning Goodman not to reassert all the § 1983 claims included in his initial complaint, \"some of which [we]re obviously frivolous.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18a.</p>\n<p>The Eleventh Circuit did not address the sufficiency of Goodman's allegations under Title II. Instead, relying on its prior decision in <i>Miller</i> v. <i>King,</i> 384 F.3d 1248 (2004), the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's holding that Goodman's Title II claims for money damages against the State were barred by sovereign immunity. We granted certiorari to consider whether Title II of the ADA validly abrogates state sovereign immunity with respect to the claims at issue here. 544 U.S. 1031 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*157</span> II</h2>\n<p>In reversing the dismissal of Goodman's § 1983 claims, the Eleventh Circuit held that Goodman had alleged actual violations of the Eighth Amendment by state agents on the grounds set forth above. See App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-1236, pp. 18a-19a. The State does not contest this holding, see Brief for Respondents 41-44, and we did not grant certiorari to consider the merits of Goodman's Eighth Amendment claims; we assume without deciding, therefore, that the Eleventh Circuit's treatment of these claims was correct. Moreover, Goodman urges, and the State does not dispute, that this same conduct that violated the Eighth Amendment also violated Title II of the ADA. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 04-1236, p. 46; Brief for Respondents 41-44. In fact, it is quite plausible that the alleged deliberate refusal of prison officials to accommodate Goodman's disability-related needs in such fundamentals as mobility, hygiene, medical care, and virtually all other prison programs constituted \"exclu[sion] from participation in or . . . deni[al of] the benefits of\" the prison's \"services, programs, or activities.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12132; see also <i>Yeskey,</i> 524 U.S., at 210 (noting that the phrase \"services, programs, or activities\" in § 12132 includes recreational, medical, educational, and vocational prison programs). Therefore, Goodman's claims for money damages against the State under Title II were evidently based, at least in large part, on conduct that independently violated the provisions of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <i>Louisiana ex rel. Francis</i> v. <i>Resweber,</i> 329 U.S. 459, 463 (1947) (plurality opinion) (the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Eighth Amendment's guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment). In this respect, Goodman differs from the claimants in our other cases addressing Congress's ability to abrogate sovereign immunity pursuant to its § 5 powers. See <i>Tennessee</i> v. <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S. 509, 543, n. 4 (2004) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (respondents were not actually denied constitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*158</span> rights); <i>Nevada Dept. of Human Resources</i> v. <i>Hibbs,</i> 538 U.S. 721, 752, 755 (2003) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (Nevada provided family leave \"on a gender-neutral basis\" \"a practice which no one contends suffers from a constitutional infirmity\"); <i>Garrett,</i> 531 U.S., at 362, 367-368 (failure to make the special accommodations requested by disabled respondents was not unconstitutional); <i>Kimel</i> v. <i>Florida Bd. of Regents,</i> 528 U.S. 62, 69-70, 83-84 (2000) (most petitioners raised nonconstitutional disparate-impact challenges to the State's age-related policies); <i>Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.</i> v. <i>College Savings Bank,</i> 527 U.S. 627, 643-644, and n. 9 (1999) (Florida satisfied due process by providing remedies for patent infringement by state actors); <i>City of Boerne</i> v. <i>Flores,</i> 521 U.S. 507, 512 (1997) (church building permit denied under neutral law of general applicability).</p>\n<p>While the Members of this Court have disagreed regarding the scope of Congress's \"prophylactic\" enforcement powers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S., at 513 (majority opinion of Stevens, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 538 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 554 (Scalia, J., dissenting), no one doubts that § 5 grants Congress the power to \"enforce . . . the provisions\" of the Amendment by creating private remedies against the States for <i>actual</i> violations of those provisions. \"Section 5 authorizes Congress to create a cause of action through which the citizen may vindicate his Fourteenth Amendment rights.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 559-560 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13); see also <i>Fitzpatrick</i> v. <i>Bitzer,</i> 427 U.S. 445, 456 (1976) (\"In [§ 5] Congress is expressly granted authority to enforce . . . the <i>substantive provisions</i> of the Fourteenth Amendment\" by providing actions for money damages against the States (emphasis added)); <i>Ex parte Virginia,</i> 100 U.S. 339, 346 (1880) (\"The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment are directed to the States . . . . It is these which Congress is empowered to enforce . . .\"). This enforcement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*159</span> power includes the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity by authorizing private suits for damages against the States. See <i>Fitzpatrick, supra,</i> at 456. Thus, insofar as Title II creates a private cause of action for damages against the States for conduct that <i>actually</i> violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity. The Eleventh Circuit erred in dismissing those of Goodman's Title II claims that were based on such unconstitutional conduct.</p>\n<p>From the many allegations in Goodman's <i>pro se</i> complaint and his subsequent filings in the District Court, it is not clear precisely what conduct he intended to allege in support of his Title II claims. Because the Eleventh Circuit did not address the issue, it is likewise unclear to what extent the conduct underlying Goodman's constitutional claims also violated Title II. Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit ordered that the suit be remanded to the District Court to permit Goodman to amend his complaint, but instructed him to revise his factual allegations to exclude his \"frivolous\" claimssome of which are quite far afield from actual constitutional violations (under either the Eighth Amendment or some other constitutional provision), or even from Title II violations. See, <i>e. g.,</i> App. 50 (demanding a \"steam table\" for Goodman's housing unit). It is therefore unclear whether Goodman's amended complaint will assert Title II claims premised on conduct that does <i>not</i> independently violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Once Goodman's complaint is amended, the lower courts will be best situated to determine in the first instance, on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the State's alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*160</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the suit is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 validly abrogates state sovereign immunity at least insofar as it creates a private cause of action for damages against States for conduct that violates the Constitution. <i>Ante,</i> at 159. And the state defendants have correctly chosen not to challenge the Eleventh Circuit's holding that Title II is constitutional insofar as it authorizes prospective injunctive relief against the State. See Brief for Respondents 6; see also <i>Miller</i> v. <i>King,</i> 384 F.3d 1248, 1264 (CA11 2004). Rather than attempting to define the outer limits of Title II's valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity on the basis of the present record, the Court's opinion wisely permits the parties, guided by <i>Tennessee</i> v. <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S. 509 (2004), to create a factual record that will inform that decision.<sup>[*]</sup> I therefore join the opinion.</p>\n<p>It is important to emphasize that although petitioner Goodman's Eighth Amendment claims provide a sufficient basis for reversal, our opinion does not suggest that this is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> the only constitutional right applicable in the prison context and therefore relevant to the abrogation issue. As we explain, when the District Court and the Court of Appeals revisit that issue, they should analyze Goodman's claims to see whether they state \"actual constitutional violations (under either the Eighth Amendment <i>or some other constitutional provision</i>),\" <i>ante,</i> at 159 (emphasis added), and to evaluate whether \"Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity [in such contexts] is nevertheless valid,\" <i>ibid.</i> This approach mirrors that taken in <i>Lane,</i> which identified a constellation of \"basic constitutional guarantees\" that Title II seeks to enforce and ultimately evaluated whether Title II was an appropriate response to the \"class of cases\" at hand. 541 U.S., at 522-523, 531. The Court's focus on Goodman's Eighth Amendment claims arises simply from the fact that those are the only constitutional violations the Eleventh Circuit found him to have alleged properly. See App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-1236, pp. 18a-19a.</p>\n<p>Moreover, our approach today is fully consistent with our recognition that the history of mistreatment leading to Congress' decision to extend Title II's protections to prison inmates was not limited to violations of the Eighth Amendment. See <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S., at 524-525 (describing \"backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment\" leading to enactment of Title II); see also, <i>e. g., </i><i>Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.</i> v. <i>Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. 356, 391-424 (2001) (Appendixes to opinion of Breyer, J., dissenting) (listing submissions made to Congress by the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities showing, for example, that prisoners with developmental disabilities were subject to longer terms of imprisonment than other prisoners); 2 House Committee on Education and Labor, Legislative History of Public Law 101-336: The Americans with Disabilities Act, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 1331 (Comm. Print 1990) (stating that persons with hearing impairments \"have been arrested and held in jail over night without ever knowing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*162</span> their rights nor what they are being held for\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1005 (stating that police arrested a man with AIDS and \"[i]nstead of putting the man in jail, the officers locked him inside his car to spend the night\"); California Dept. of Justice, Attorney General's Commission on Disability: Final Report 103 (Dec. 1989) (finding that inmates with disabilities were unnecessarily \"confined to medical units where access to work, job training, recreation and rehabilitation programs is limited\"). In fact, as the Solicitor General points out in his brief arguing that Title II's damages remedy constitutes appropriate prophylactic legislation in the prison context, the record of mistreatment of prison inmates that Congress reviewed in its deliberations preceding the enactment of Title II was comparable in all relevant respects to the record that we recently held sufficient to uphold the application of that title to the entire class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. See <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S., at 533-534. And while it is true that cases involving inadequate medical care and inhumane conditions of confinement have perhaps been most numerous, courts have also reviewed myriad other types of claims by disabled prisoners, such as allegations of the abridgment of religious liberties, undue censorship, interference with access to the judicial process, and procedural due process violations. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Vitek</i> v. <i>Jones,</i> 445 U.S. 480 (1980) (procedural due process); <i>May</i> v. <i>Sheahan,</i> 226 F.3d 876 (CA7 2000) (access to judicial process, lawyers, legal materials, and reading materials); <i>Littlefield</i> v. <i>Deland,</i> 641 F. 2d 729 (CA10 1981) (access to reading and writing materials); <i>Nolley</i> v. <i>County of Erie,</i> 776 F. Supp. 715 (WDNY 1991) (access to law library and religious services).</p>\n<p>Indeed, given the constellation of rights applicable in the prison context, it is clear that the Eleventh Circuit has erred in identifying only the Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment in performing the first step of the \"congruence and proportionality\" inquiry set <span class=\"star-pagination\">*163</span> forth in <i>City of Boerne</i> v. <i>Flores,</i> 521 U.S. 507 (1997). See <i>Miller,</i> 384 F.3d, at 1272, and n. 28 (declining to entertain United States' argument that <i>Lane</i> requires consideration of constitutional rights beyond those provided by the Eighth Amendment); App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-1236, p. 19a (relying on <i>Miller</i> to find Goodman's Title II claims for money damages barred by the Eleventh Amendment). By reversing the Eleventh Circuit's decision in these cases and remanding for further proceedings, we not only provide the parties an opportunity to create a more substantial factual record, but also provide the District Court and the Court of Appeals the opportunity to apply the <i>Boerne</i> framework properly. Given these benefits, I agree with the Court's decision to await further proceedings before trying to define the extent to which Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity in the prison context.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Together with No. 04-1236, <i>Goodman</i> v. <i>Georgia et al.,</i> also on certiorari to the same court.</p>\n<p>[]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal in both cases were filed for ADAPT et al. by <i>Paul M.

A \"`qualified individual with a disability'\" is defined as \"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*154</span> meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.\" § 12131(2). The Act defines \"`public entity'\" to include \"any State or local government\" and \"any department, agency, . . . or other instrumentality of a State,\" § 12131(1). We have previously held that this term includes state prisons.

Title II authorizes suits by private citizens for money damages against public entities that violate § 12132. See 42 U.S.C. § 12133 (incorporating by reference 29 U.S.C. § 794a).</p>\n<p>In enacting the ADA, Congress \"invoke[d] the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(4). Moreover, the Act provides that \"[a] State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in [a] Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter.\" § 12202. We have accepted this latter statement as an unequivocal expression of Congress's intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity. See <i>Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.</i> v. <i>Garrett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, 363-364 (2001).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner in No. 04-1236, Tony Goodman, is a paraplegic inmate in the Georgia prison system who, at all relevant times, was housed at the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville. After filing numerous administrative grievances in the state prison system, Goodman filed a <i>pro se</i> complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia challenging the conditions of his confinement. He named as defendants the State of Georgia and the Georgia Department of Corrections (state defendants) and several individual prison officials. He brought claims under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, and other provisions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*155</span> not relevant here, seeking both injunctive relief and money damages against all defendants.</p>\n<p>Goodman's <i>pro se</i> complaint and subsequent filings in the District Court included many allegations, both grave and trivial, regarding the conditions of his confinement in the Reidsville prison. Among his more serious allegations, he claimed that he was confined for 23-to-24 hours per day in a 12-by-3-foot cell in which he could not turn his wheelchair around. He alleged that the lack of accessible facilities rendered him unable to use the toilet and shower without assistance, which was often denied. On multiple occasions, he asserted, he had injured himself in attempting to transfer from his wheelchair to the shower or toilet on his own, and, on several other occasions, he had been forced to sit in his own feces and urine while prison officials refused to assist him in cleaning up the waste. He also claimed that he had been denied physical therapy and medical treatment, and denied access to virtually all prison programs and services on account of his disability.</p>\n<p>The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation that the allegations in the complaint were vague and constituted insufficient notice pleading as to Goodman's § 1983 claims. It therefore dismissed the § 1983 claims against all defendants without providing Goodman an opportunity to amend his complaint. The District Court also dismissed his Title II claims against all individual defendants. Later, after our decision in <i>Garrett,</i> the District Court granted summary judgment to the state defendants on Goodman's Title II claims for money damages, holding that those claims were barred by state sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>Goodman appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The United States, petitioner in No. 04-1203, intervened to defend the constitutionality of Title II's abrogation of state sovereign immunity. The Eleventh Circuit determined that the District Court had erred in dismissing all of Goodman's § 1983 claims, because Goodman's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*156</span> multiple <i>pro se</i> filings in the District Court alleged facts sufficient to support \"a limited number of Eighth-Amendment claims under § 1983\" against certain individual defendants. App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-1236, p. 17a, judgt. order reported at 120 Fed. Appx. 785 (2004). The Court of Appeals held that the District Court should have given Goodman leave to amend his complaint to develop three Eighth Amendment claims relating to his conditions of confinement:</p>\n<blockquote>\"First, Goodman alleges that he is not able to move his wheelchair in his cell. If Goodman is to be believed, this effectively amounts to some form of total restraint twenty-three to twenty-four hours-a-day without penal justification. Second, Goodman has alleged several instances in which he was forced to sit in his own bodily waste because prison officials refused to provide assistance. Third, Goodman has alleged sufficient conduct to proceed with a § 1983 claim based on the prison staff's supposed `deliberate indifference' to his serious medical condition of being partially paraplegic . . . .\" App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-1236, pp. 18a-19a (citation and footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>The court remanded the suit to the District Court to permit Goodman to amend his complaint, while cautioning Goodman not to reassert all the § 1983 claims included in his initial complaint, \"some of which [we]re obviously frivolous.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18a.</p>\n<p>The Eleventh Circuit did not address the sufficiency of Goodman's allegations under Title II. Instead, relying on its prior decision in <i>Miller</i> v. <i>King,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></span> (2004), the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's holding that Goodman's Title II claims for money damages against the State were barred by sovereign immunity. We granted certiorari to consider whether Title II of the ADA validly abrogates state sovereign immunity with respect to the claims at issue here. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"144598\"><a href=\"/opinion/144598/united-states-v-georgia-et-al/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span> (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*157</span> II</h2>\n<p>In reversing the dismissal of Goodman's § 1983 claims, the Eleventh Circuit held that Goodman had alleged actual violations of the Eighth Amendment by state agents on the grounds set forth above. See App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-1236, pp. 18a-19a. The State does not contest this holding, see Brief for Respondents 41-44, and we did not grant certiorari to consider the merits of Goodman's Eighth Amendment claims; we assume without deciding, therefore, that the Eleventh Circuit's treatment of these claims was correct. Moreover, Goodman urges, and the State does not dispute, that this same conduct that violated the Eighth Amendment also violated Title II of the ADA. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 04-1236, p. 46; Brief for Respondents 41-44. In fact, it is quite plausible that the alleged deliberate refusal of prison officials to accommodate Goodman's disability-related needs in such fundamentals as mobility, hygiene, medical care, and virtually all other prison programs constituted \"exclu[sion] from participation in or . . . deni[al of] the benefits of\" the prison's \"services, programs, or activities.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12132; see also <i>Yeskey,</i> 524 U.S., at 210 (noting that the phrase \"services, programs, or activities\" in § 12132 includes recreational, medical, educational, and vocational prison programs). Therefore, Goodman's claims for money damages against the State under Title II were evidently based, at least in large part, on conduct that independently violated the provisions of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <i>Louisiana ex rel. Francis</i> v. <i>Resweber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104355\"><a href=\"/opinion/104355/louisiana-ex-rel-francis-v-resweber/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span>, 463 (1947) (plurality opinion) (the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Eighth Amendment's guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment). In this respect, Goodman differs from the claimants in our other cases addressing Congress's ability to abrogate sovereign immunity pursuant to its § 5 powers.

J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 554 (Scalia, J., dissenting), no one doubts that § 5 grants Congress the power to \"enforce . . . the provisions\" of the Amendment by creating private remedies against the States for <i>actual</i> violations of those provisions. \"Section 5 authorizes Congress to create a cause of action through which the citizen may vindicate his Fourteenth Amendment rights.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 559-560 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13); see also <i>Fitzpatrick</i> v. <i>Bitzer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109520\"><a href=\"/opinion/109520/fitzpatrick-v-bitzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span>, 456 (1976) (\"In [§ 5] Congress is expressly granted authority to enforce . . . the <i>substantive provisions</i> of the Fourteenth Amendment\" by providing actions for money damages against the States (emphasis added)); <i>Ex parte Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90041\"><a href=\"/opinion/90041/ex-parte-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>, 346 (1880) (\"The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment are directed to the States . . . . It is these which Congress is empowered to enforce . . .\"). This enforcement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*159</span> power includes the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity by authorizing private suits for damages against the States. See <i>Fitzpatrick, supra,</i> at 456. Thus, insofar as Title II creates a private cause of action for damages against the States for conduct that <i>actually</i> violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity. The Eleventh Circuit erred in dismissing those of Goodman's Title II claims that were based on such unconstitutional conduct.</p>\n<p>From the many allegations in Goodman's <i>pro se</i> complaint and his subsequent filings in the District Court, it is not clear precisely what conduct he intended to allege in support of his Title II claims. Because the Eleventh Circuit did not address the issue, it is likewise unclear to what extent the conduct underlying Goodman's constitutional claims also violated Title II. Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit ordered that the suit be remanded to the District Court to permit Goodman to amend his complaint, but instructed him to revise his factual allegations to exclude his \"frivolous\" claimssome of which are quite far afield from actual constitutional violations (under either the Eighth Amendment or some other constitutional provision), or even from Title II violations. See, <i>e. g.,</i> App. 50 (demanding a \"steam table\" for Goodman's housing unit). It is therefore unclear whether Goodman's amended complaint will assert Title II claims premised on conduct that does <i>not</i> independently violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Once Goodman's complaint is amended, the lower courts will be best situated to determine in the first instance, on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the State's alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*160</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the suit is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 validly abrogates state sovereign immunity at least insofar as it creates a private cause of action for damages against States for conduct that violates the Constitution. <i>Ante,</i> at 159. And the state defendants have correctly chosen not to challenge the Eleventh Circuit's holding that Title II is constitutional insofar as it authorizes prospective injunctive relief against the State. See Brief for Respondents 6; see also <i>Miller</i> v. <i>King,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></span>, 1264 (CA11 2004). Rather than attempting to define the outer limits of Title II's valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity on the basis of the present record, the Court's opinion wisely permits the parties, guided by <i>Tennessee</i> v. <i>Lane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134743\"><a href=\"/opinion/134743/tennessee-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span> (2004), to create a factual record that will inform that decision.<sup>[*]</sup> I therefore join the opinion.</p>\n<p>It is important to emphasize that although petitioner Goodman's Eighth Amendment claims provide a sufficient basis for reversal, our opinion does not suggest that this is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> the only constitutional right applicable in the prison context and therefore relevant to the abrogation issue. As we explain, when the District Court and the Court of Appeals revisit that issue, they should analyze Goodman's claims to see whether they state \"actual constitutional violations (under either the Eighth Amendment <i>or some other constitutional provision</i>),\" <i>ante,</i> at 159 (emphasis added), and to evaluate whether \"Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity [in such contexts] is nevertheless valid,\" <i>ibid.</i> This approach mirrors that taken in <i>Lane,</i> which identified a constellation of \"basic constitutional guarantees\" that Title II seeks to enforce and ultimately evaluated whether Title II was an appropriate response to the \"class of cases\" at hand. 541 U.S., at 522-523, 531. The Court's focus on Goodman's Eighth Amendment claims arises simply from the fact that those are the only constitutional violations the Eleventh Circuit found him to have alleged properly. See App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-1236, pp. 18a-19a.</p>\n<p>Moreover, our approach today is fully consistent with our recognition that the history of mistreatment leading to Congress' decision to extend Title II's protections to prison inmates was not limited to violations of the Eighth Amendment. See <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S., at 524-525 (describing \"backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment\" leading to enactment of Title II); see also, <i>e. g., </i><i>Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.</i> v. <i>Garrett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, 391-424 (2001) (Appendixes to opinion of Breyer, J., dissenting) (listing submissions made to Congress by the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities showing, for example, that prisoners with developmental disabilities were subject to longer terms of imprisonment than other prisoners); 2 House Committee on Education and Labor, Legislative History of Public Law 101-336: The Americans with Disabilities Act, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 1331 (Comm. Print 1990) (stating that persons with hearing impairments \"have been arrested and held in jail over night without ever knowing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*162</span> their rights nor what they are being held for\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1005 (stating that police arrested a man with AIDS and \"[i]nstead of putting the man in jail, the officers locked him inside his car to spend the night\"); California Dept. of Justice, Attorney General's Commission on Disability: Final Report 103 (Dec. 1989) (finding that inmates with disabilities were unnecessarily \"confined to medical units where access to work, job training, recreation and rehabilitation programs is limited\"). In fact, as the Solicitor General points out in his brief arguing that Title II's damages remedy constitutes appropriate prophylactic legislation in the prison context, the record of mistreatment of prison inmates that Congress reviewed in its deliberations preceding the enactment of Title II was comparable in all relevant respects to the record that we recently held sufficient to uphold the application of that title to the entire class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. See <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S., at 533-534. And while it is true that cases involving inadequate medical care and inhumane conditions of confinement have perhaps been most numerous, courts have also reviewed myriad other types of claims by disabled prisoners, such as allegations of the abridgment of religious liberties, undue censorship, interference with access to the judicial process, and procedural due process violations. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Vitek</i> v. <i>Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110231\"><a href=\"/opinion/110231/vitek-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span> (1980) (procedural due process); <i>May</i> v. <i>Sheahan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770435\"><a href=\"/opinion/770435/gregory-may-v-michael-f-sheahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span> (CA7 2000) (access to judicial process, lawyers, legal materials, and reading materials); <i>Littlefield</i> v. <i>Deland,</i> 641 F. 2d 729 (CA10 1981) (access to reading and writing materials); <i>Nolley</i> v. <i>County of Erie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2340752\"><a href=\"/opinion/2340752/nolley-v-county-of-erie/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span> (WDNY 1991) (access to law library and religious services).</p>\n<p>Indeed, given the constellation of rights applicable in the prison context, it is clear that the Eleventh Circuit has erred in identifying only the Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment in performing the first step of the \"congruence and proportionality\" inquiry set <span class=\"star-pagination\">*163</span> forth in <i>City of Boerne</i> v. <i>Flores,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span> (1997). See <i>Miller,</i> 384 F.3d, at 1272, and n. 28 (declining to entertain United States' argument that <i>Lane</i> requires consideration of constitutional rights beyond those provided by the Eighth Amendment); App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-1236, p. 19a (relying on <i>Miller</i> to find Goodman's Title II claims for money damages barred by the Eleventh Amendment). By reversing the Eleventh Circuit's decision in these cases and remanding for further proceedings, we not only provide the parties an opportunity to create a more substantial factual record, but also provide the District Court and the Court of Appeals the opportunity to apply the <i>Boerne</i> framework properly. Given these benefits, I agree with the Court's decision to await further proceedings before trying to define the extent to which Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity in the prison context.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Together with No. 04-1236, <i>Goodman</i> v. <i>Georgia et al.,</i> also on certiorari to the same court.</p>\n<p>[]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal in both cases were filed for ADAPT et al. by <i>Paul M.

Argued November 9, 2005—Decided January 10, 2006*\r\nGoodman, petitioner in No. 04–1236, is a paraplegic who sued respon-\r\n dent state defendants and others, challenging the conditions of his\r\n confinement in a Georgia prison under, inter alia, 42 U. S. C. §1983\r\n and Title II of the Americans with Disability Act of 1990. As relevant\r\n here, the Federal District Court dismissed the §1983 claims because\r\n Goodman’s allegations were vague, and granted respondents sum-\r\n mary judgment on the Title II money damages claims because they\r\n were barred by state sovereign immunity. The United States, peti-\r\n tioner in No. 04–1203, intervened on appeal. The Eleventh Circuit\r\n affirmed the District Court’s judgment as to the Title II claims, but\r\n reversed the §1983 ruling, finding that Goodman had alleged facts\r\n sufficient to support a limited number of Eighth Amendment claims\r\n against state agents and should be permitted to amend his com-\r\n plaint. This Court granted certiorari to decide the validity of Title\r\n II’s abrogation of state sovereign immunity.\r\nHeld: Insofar as Title II creates a private cause of action for damages\r\n   against States for conduct that actually violates the Fourteenth\r\n   Amendment, Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity.\r\n   Pp. 5–8.\r\n      (a) Because this Court assumes that the Eleventh Circuit correctly\r\n   held that Goodman had alleged actual Eighth Amendment violations\r\n   for purposes of §1983, and because respondents do not dispute Good-\r\n   man’s claim that this same conduct violated Title II, Goodman’s Title\r\n   II money damages claims were evidently based, at least in part, on\r\n   conduct that independently violated §1 of the Fourteenth Amend-\r\n——————\r\n   * Together with No. 04–1236, Goodman v. Georgia et al., also on cer-\r\ntiorari to the same court.\r\n2                    UNITED STATES v. GEORGIA\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n    ment. No one doubts that §5 grants Congress the power to enforce\r\n    the Fourteenth Amendment’s provisions by creating private remedies\r\n    against the States for actual violations of those provisions.

S. C. §12131 et seq. (2000 ed. and\r\nSupp. II).\r\n                             I\r\n                             A\r\n  Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual\r\nwith a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be\r\nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of\r\nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or\r\nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” §12132\r\n(2000 ed.). A “ ‘qualified individual with a disability’ ” is\r\ndefined as “an individual with a disability who, with or\r\n2                UNITED STATES v. GEORGIA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nwithout reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or\r\npractices, the removal of architectural, communication, or\r\ntransportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids\r\nand services, meets the essential eligibility requirements\r\nfor the receipt of services or the participation in programs\r\nor activities provided by a public entity.” §12131(2). The\r\nAct defines “ ‘public entity’ ” to include “any State or local\r\ngovernment” and “any department, agency, . . . or other\r\ninstrumentality of a State,” §12131(1). We have previ-\r\nously held that this term includes state prisons. See\r\nPennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206,\r\n210 (1998). Title II authorizes suits by private citizens for\r\nmoney damages against public entities that violate\r\n§12132. See 42 U. S. C. §12133 (incorporating by refer-\r\nence 29 U. S. C. §794a).\r\n   In enacting the ADA, Congress “invoke[d] the sweep of\r\ncongressional authority, including the power to enforce the\r\nfourteenth amendment . . . .” 42 U. S. C. §12101(b)(4).\r\nMoreover, the Act provides that “[a] State shall not be\r\nimmune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitu-\r\ntion of the United States from an action in [a] Federal or\r\nState court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this\r\nchapter.” §12202. We have accepted this latter statement\r\nas an unequivocal expression of Congress’s intent to abro-\r\ngate state sovereign immunity. See Board of Trustees of\r\nUniv. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 363–364 (2001).\r\n                            B\r\n  Petitioner in No. 04–1236, Tony Goodman, is a paraple-\r\ngic inmate in the Georgia prison system who, at all rele-\r\nvant times, was housed at the Georgia State Prison in\r\nReidsville. After filing numerous administrative griev-\r\nances in the state prison system, Goodman filed a pro se\r\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the\r\nSouthern District of Georgia challenging the conditions of\r\nhis confinement. He named as defendants the State of\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nGeorgia and the Georgia Department of Corrections (state\r\ndefendants) and several individual prison officials. He\r\nbrought claims under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983,\r\nTitle II of the ADA, and other provisions not relevant here,\r\nseeking both injunctive relief and money damages against\r\nall defendants.\r\n   Goodman’s pro se complaint and subsequent filings in\r\nthe District Court included many allegations, both grave\r\nand trivial, regarding the conditions of his confinement in\r\nthe Reidsville prison. Among his more serious allegations,\r\nhe claimed that he was confined for 23-to-24 hours per day\r\nin a 12-by-3-foot cell in which he could not turn his wheel-\r\nchair around. He alleged that the lack of accessible facili-\r\nties rendered him unable to use the toilet and shower\r\nwithout assistance, which was often denied. On multiple\r\noccasions, he asserted, he had injured himself in attempt-\r\ning to transfer from his wheelchair to the shower or toilet\r\non his own, and, on several other occasions, he had been\r\nforced to sit in his own feces and urine while prison offi-\r\ncials refused to assist him in cleaning up the waste. He\r\nalso claimed that he had been denied physical therapy and\r\nmedical treatment, and denied access to virtually all\r\nprison programs and services on account of his disability.\r\n   The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s\r\nrecommendation that the allegations in the complaint\r\nwere vague and constituted insufficient notice pleading as\r\nto Goodman’s §1983 claims. It therefore dismissed the\r\n§1983 claims against all defendants without providing\r\nGoodman an opportunity to amend his complaint. The\r\nDistrict Court also dismissed his Title II claims against all\r\nindividual defendants.       Later, after our decision in\r\nGarrett, the District Court granted summary judgment to\r\nthe state defendants on Goodman’s Title II claims for\r\nmoney damages, holding that those claims were barred by\r\nstate sovereign immunity.\r\n   Goodman appealed to the United States Court of Ap-\r\n4               UNITED STATES v. GEORGIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The United States, peti-\r\ntioner in No. 04–1203, intervened to defend the constitu-\r\ntionality of Title II’s abrogation of state sovereign immu-\r\nnity. The Eleventh Circuit determined that the District\r\nCourt had erred in dismissing all of Goodman’s §1983\r\nclaims, because Goodman’s multiple pro se filings in the\r\nDistrict Court alleged facts sufficient to support “a limited\r\nnumber of Eighth-Amendment claims under §1983”\r\nagainst certain individual defendants. App. to Pet. for\r\nCert. in No. 04–1236, p. 17a, judgt. order reported at 120\r\nFed. Appx. 785 (2004). The Court of Appeals held that the\r\nDistrict Court should have given Goodman leave to amend\r\nhis complaint to develop three Eighth Amendment claims\r\nrelating to his conditions of confinement:\r\n    “First, Goodman alleges that he is not able to move\r\n    his wheelchair in his cell. If Goodman is to be be-\r\n    lieved, this effectively amounts to some form of total\r\n    restraint twenty-three to twenty-four hours-a-day\r\n    without penal justification. Second, Goodman has al-\r\n    leged several instances in which he was forced to sit\r\n    in his own bodily waste because prison officials re-\r\n    fused to provide assistance. Third, Goodman has al-\r\n    leged sufficient conduct to proceed with a §1983 claim\r\n    based on the prison staff’s supposed ‘deliberate indif-\r\n    ference’ to his serious medical condition of being par-\r\n    tially paraplegic . . . .” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\r\n    04–1236, pp. 18a–19a (citation and footnote omitted).\r\nThe Court remanded the suit to the District Court to\r\npermit Goodman to amend his complaint, while cautioning\r\nGoodman not to reassert all the §1983 claims included in\r\nhis initial complaint, “some of which [we]re obviously\r\nfrivolous.” Id., at 18a.\r\n   The Eleventh Circuit did not address the sufficiency of\r\nGoodman’s allegations under Title II. Instead, relying on\r\nits prior decision in Miller v. King, 384 F. 3d 1248 (2004),\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)             5\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthe Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s holding\r\nthat Goodman’s Title II claims for money damages against\r\nthe State were barred by sovereign immunity. We granted\r\ncertiorari to consider whether Title II of the ADA validly\r\nabrogates state sovereign immunity with respect to the\r\nclaims at issue here. 544 U. S. ___ (2005).\r\n                               II\r\n   In reversing the dismissal of Goodman’s §1983 claims,\r\nthe Eleventh Circuit held that Goodman had alleged\r\nactual violations of the Eighth Amendment by state\r\nagents on the grounds set forth above. See App. to Pet. for\r\nCert. in No. 04–1236, pp. 18a–19a. The State does not\r\ncontest this holding, see Brief for Respondents 41–44, and\r\nwe did not grant certiorari to consider the merits of Good-\r\nman’s Eighth Amendment claims; we assume without\r\ndeciding, therefore, that the Eleventh Circuit’s treatment\r\nof these claims was correct. Moreover, Goodman urges,\r\nand the State does not dispute, that this same conduct\r\nthat violated the Eighth Amendment also violated Title II\r\nof the ADA. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 04–1236, p. 46;\r\nBrief for Respondents 41–44. In fact, it is quite plausible\r\nthat the alleged deliberate refusal of prison officials to\r\naccommodate Goodman’s disability-related needs in such\r\nfundamentals as mobility, hygiene, medical care, and\r\nvirtually all other prison programs constituted “exclu[sion]\r\nfrom participation in or . . . den[ial of] the benefits of” the\r\nprison’s “services, programs, or activities.” 42 U. S. C.\r\n§12132; see also Yeskey, 524 U. S., at 210 (noting that the\r\nphrase “services, programs, or activities” in §12132 in-\r\ncludes recreational, medical, educational, and vocational\r\nprison programs). Therefore, Goodman’s claims for money\r\ndamages against the State under Title II were evidently\r\nbased, at least in large part, on conduct that independ-\r\nently violated the provisions of §1 of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment. See Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber,\r\n6               UNITED STATES v. GEORGIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n329 U. S. 459, 463 (1947) (the Due Process Clause of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Eighth Amend-\r\nment’s guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment).\r\nIn this respect, Goodman differs from the claimants in our\r\nother cases addressing Congress’s ability to abrogate\r\nsovereign immunity pursuant to its §5 powers. See Ten-\r\nnessee v. Lane, 541 U. S. 509, 543, n. 4 (2004) (Rehnquist,\r\nC. J., dissenting) (respondents were not actually denied\r\nconstitutional rights); Nevada Dept. of Human Resources\r\nv. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 752, 755 (2003) (KENNEDY, J.,\r\ndissenting) (Nevada provided family leave “on a gender-\r\nneutral basis”—“a practice which no one contends suffers\r\nfrom a constitutional infirmity”); Garrett, 531 U. S., at\r\n362, 367–368 (failure to make the special accommodations\r\nrequested by disabled respondents was not unconstitu-\r\ntional); Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.

S. 507, 512 (1997)\r\n(church building permit denied under neutral law of gen-\r\neral applicability).\r\n   While the Members of this Court have disagreed regard-\r\ning the scope of Congress’s “prophylactic” enforcement\r\npowers under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, see, e.g.,\r\nLane, 541 U. S., at 513 (majority opinion of STEVENS, J.);\r\nid., at 538 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); id., at 554\r\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting), no one doubts that §5 grants\r\nCongress the power to “enforce . . . the provisions” of the\r\nAmendment by creating private remedies against the\r\nStates for actual violations of those provisions. “Section 5\r\nauthorizes Congress to create a cause of action through\r\nwhich the citizen may vindicate his Fourteenth Amend-\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nment rights.” Id., at 559–560 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\r\n(citing the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat.\r\n13); see also Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 456 (1976)\r\n(“In [§5] Congress is expressly granted authority to enforce\r\n. . . the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amend-\r\nment” by providing actions for money damages against the\r\nStates (emphasis added)); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339,\r\n346 (1880) (“The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amend-\r\nment are directed to the States . . . . It is these which\r\nCongress is empowered to enforce . . .”). This enforcement\r\npower includes the power to abrogate state sovereign\r\nimmunity by authorizing private suits for damages\r\nagainst the States. See Fitzpatrick, supra, at 456. Thus,\r\ninsofar as Title II creates a private cause of action for\r\ndamages against the States for conduct that actually\r\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II validly abro-\r\ngates state sovereign immunity. The Eleventh Circuit\r\nerred in dismissing those of Goodman’s Title II claims that\r\nwere based on such unconstitutional conduct.\r\n    From the many allegations in Goodman’s pro se com-\r\nplaint and his subsequent filings in the District Court, it is\r\nnot clear precisely what conduct he intended to allege in\r\nsupport of his Title II claims. Because the Eleventh Cir-\r\ncuit did not address the issue, it is likewise unclear to\r\nwhat extent the conduct underlying Goodman’s constitu-\r\ntional claims also violated Title II. Moreover, the Elev-\r\nenth Circuit ordered that the suit be remanded to the\r\nDistrict Court to permit Goodman to amend his complaint,\r\nbut instructed him to revise his factual allegations to\r\nexclude his “frivolous” claims—some of which are quite far\r\nafield from actual constitutional violations (under either\r\nthe Eighth Amendment or some other constitutional pro-\r\nvision), or even from Title II violations. See, e.g., App. 50\r\n(demanding a “steam table” for Goodman’s housing unit).\r\nIt is therefore unclear whether Goodman’s amended com-\r\nplaint will assert Title II claims premised on conduct that\r\n8               UNITED STATES v. GEORGIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ndoes not independently violate the Fourteenth Amend-\r\nment. Once Goodman’s complaint is amended, the lower\r\ncourts will be best situated to determine in the first in-\r\nstance, on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the\r\nState’s alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent\r\nsuch misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amend-\r\nment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II\r\nbut did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether\r\nCongress’s purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as\r\nto that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.\r\n                     *     *    *\r\n  The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and\r\nthe suit is remanded for further proceedings consistent\r\nwith this opinion.\r\n                                         It is so ordered.\r\n                     Cite as: 546 U.

Ante, at 7. And the state defendants\r\nhave correctly chosen not to challenge the Eleventh Cir-\r\ncuit’s holding that Title II is constitutional insofar as it\r\nauthorizes prospective injunctive relief against the State.\r\nSee Brief for Respondents 6; see also Miller v. King, 384 F.\r\n3d 1248, 1264 (CA11 2004). Rather than attempting to\r\ndefine the outer limits of Title II’s valid abrogation of state\r\nsovereign immunity on the basis of the present record, the\r\nCourt’s opinion wisely permits the parties, guided by\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U. S. 509 (2004), to create a factual\r\nrecord that will inform that decision.* I therefore join the\r\n——————\r\n  * Such definition is necessary because Title II prohibits “ ‘a somewhat\r\nbroader swath of conduct’ ” than the Constitution itself forbids. Lane,\r\n2                   UNITED STATES v. GEORGIA\r\n\r\n                         STEVENS, J., concurring\r\n\r\nopinion.\r\n   It is important to emphasize that although petitioner\r\nGoodman’s Eighth Amendment claims provide a sufficient\r\nbasis for reversal, our opinion does not suggest that this is\r\nthe only constitutional right applicable in the prison con-\r\ntext and therefore relevant to the abrogation issue. As we\r\nexplain, when the District Court and the Court of Appeals\r\nrevisit that issue, they should analyze Goodman’s claims\r\nto see whether they state “actual constitutional violations\r\n(under either the Eighth Amendment or some other consti-\r\ntutional provision),” ante, at 7 (emphasis added), and to\r\nevaluate whether “Congress’s purported abrogation of\r\nsovereign immunity in such contexts is nevertheless\r\nvalid,” ante, at 8. This approach mirrors that taken in\r\nLane, which identified a constellation of “basic constitu-\r\ntional guarantees” that Title II seeks to enforce and ulti-\r\nmately evaluated whether Title II was an appropriate\r\nresponse to the “class of cases” at hand. 541 U. S., at 522–\r\n523, 531.      The Court’s focus on Goodman’s Eighth\r\nAmendment claims arises simply from the fact that those\r\nare the only constitutional violations the Eleventh Circuit\r\nfound him to have alleged properly. See App. to Pet. for\r\nCert. in No. 04–1236, pp. 18a–19a.\r\n   Moreover, our approach today is fully consistent with\r\nour recognition that the history of mistreatment leading to\r\nCongress’ decision to extend Title II’s protections to prison\r\ninmates was not limited to violations of the Eighth\r\n\r\n—————— \r\n\r\n541 U. S., at 533, n. 24 (quoting Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528\r\n\r\nU. S. 62, 81 (2000)). While a factual record may not be absolutely\r\nnecessary to our resolution of the question, it will surely aid our under-\r\nstanding of issues such as how, in practice, Title II’s “reasonableness”\r\nrequirement applies in the prison context, cf. Lane, 541 U. S., at 531–\r\n532 (explaining that Title II requires only “ ‘reasonable modifications’ ”),\r\nand therefore whether certain of Goodman’s claims are even covered by\r\nTitle II, cf. App. 83 (complaining of lack of access to, among other\r\nthings, “television, phone calls, [and] entertainment”).\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U.

See Lane,\r\n541 U. S., at 533–534. And while it is true that cases\r\ninvolving inadequate medical care and inhumane condi-\r\ntions of confinement have perhaps been most numerous,\r\ncourts have also reviewed myriad other types of claims by\r\n4               UNITED STATES v. GEORGIA\r\n\r\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\r\n\r\ndisabled prisoners, such as allegations of the abridgment\r\nof religious liberties, undue censorship, interference with\r\naccess to the judicial process, and procedural due process\r\nviolations. See, e.g., Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 (1980)\r\n(procedural due process); May v. Sheahan, 226 F. 3d 876\r\n(CA7 2000) (access to judicial process, lawyers, legal mate-\r\nrials, and reading materials); Littlefield v. Deland, 641 F.\r\n2d 729 (CA10 1981) (access to reading and writing materi-\r\nals); Nolley v. County of Erie, 776 F. Supp. 715 (WDNY\r\n1991) (access to law library and religious services).\r\n  Indeed, given the constellation of rights applicable in\r\nthe prison context, it is clear that the Eleventh Circuit has\r\nerred in identifying only the Eighth Amendment right to\r\nbe free from cruel and unusual punishment in performing\r\nthe first step of the “congruence and proportionality”\r\ninquiry set forth in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507\r\n(1997). See Miller, 384 F. 3d, at 1272, and n. 28 (declining\r\nto entertain United States’ argument that Lane requires\r\nconsideration of constitutional rights beyond those pro-\r\nvided by the Eighth Amendment); App. to Pet. for Cert. in\r\nNo. 04–1236, p. 19a (relying on Miller to find Goodman’s\r\nTitle II claims for money damages barred by the Eleventh\r\nAmendment). By reversing the Eleventh Circuit’s decision\r\nin this case and remanding for further proceedings, we not\r\nonly provide the parties an opportunity to create a more\r\nsubstantial factual record, but also provide the District\r\nCourt and the Court of Appeals the opportunity to apply\r\nthe Boerne framework properly. Given these benefits, I\r\nagree with the Court’s decision to await further proceed-\r\nings before trying to define the extent to which Title II\r\nvalidly abrogates state sovereign immunity in the prison\r\ncontext.\r\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145697/", "sha1": "b3cd4764a3ea17eacf8537bf754da95018d30e3c", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2005-014", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:06:42"}
