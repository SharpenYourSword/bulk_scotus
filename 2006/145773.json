Campbell, Supervising Deputy Attorney General, Mark A. Johnson, Assistant Supervising Deputy Attorney General, Counsel of Record, Sacramento, CA, for Petitioner.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Fernando Belmontes, the respondent here, was tried in 1982 in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of San Joaquin. A jury returned a verdict of murder in the first degree and then determined he should be sentenced to death. The issue before us concerns a jury instruction in the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p>The trial court, following the statute then in effect, directed the jury, with other instructions and in a context to be discussed in more detail, to consider certain specific factors either as aggravating or mitigating. The trial court further instructed the jury to consider \"[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\" App. 184. Under the then-applicable statutory scheme this general or catchall factor was codified at Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 190.3(k) (West 1988); and it is referred to as \"factor (k).\"</p>\n<p>Belmontes contended, on direct review, in state collateral proceedings, and in the federal habeas proceedings giving rise to this case, that factor (k) and the trial court's other instructions barred the jury from considering his forward-looking mitigation evidencespecifically evidence that he likely would lead a constructive life if incarcerated instead of executed. The alleged limitation, in his view, prevented the jury from considering relevant mitigation evidence, in violation of his Eighth Amendment right to present all mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Penry v. Johnson,</i> 532 U.S. 782, 797, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001); <i>Skipper v. South Carolina,</i> 476 U.S. 1, 4-5, 8, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986); <i>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</i> 455 U.S. 104, 112, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). The California Supreme Court, affirming the judgment and sentence, rejected this contention and other challenges. <i>People v. Belmontes,</i> 45 Cal.3d 744, 799-802, 819, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d 310, 341-343, 355 (1988).</p>\n<p>In February 1994, after exhausting state remedies, respondent filed an amended federal habeas petition. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California denied relief, App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a-141a, 145a, but a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, <i>Belmontes v. Woodford,</i> 350 F.3d 861, 908 (2003). Over the dissent of eight judges, the Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc. <i>Belmontes v. Woodford,</i> 359 F.3d 1079 (2004). This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of <i>Brown v. Payton,</i> 544 U.S. 133, 125 S.Ct. 1432, 161 L.Ed.2d 334 (2005). <i>Brown v. Belmontes,</i> 544 U.S. 945, 125 S.Ct. 1697, 161 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). On remand, a divided panel again invalidated respondent's sentence; it distinguished <i>Payton</i> on the grounds that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, though applicable in that case, does not apply here. <i>Belmontes v. Brown,</i> 414 F.3d 1094, 1101-1102 (2005). Over yet another dissent, the Court of Appeals again denied rehearing en banc. <i>Belmontes v. Stokes,</i> 427 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> 663 (2005). We granted certiorari, 547 U.S. 1110, 126 S.Ct. 1909, 164 L.Ed.2d 662 (2006), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The evidence at trial showed that in March 1981, while burglarizing a home where two accomplices had attended a party, respondent unexpectedly encountered 19-year-old Steacy McConnell. Respondent killed her by striking her head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar. Respondent had armed himself with the dumbbell bar before entering the victim's home. See <i>Belmontes, supra,</i> at 760-764, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d, at 315-317.</p>\n<p>In the sentencing phase of his trial Belmontes introduced mitigating evidence to show, <i>inter alia,</i> that he would make positive contributions to society in a structured prison environment. Respondent testified that, during a previous term under the California Youth Authority (CYA), he had behaved in a constructive way, working his way to the number two position on a fire crew in the CYA fire camp in which he was incarcerated. App. 44-45, 53. About that time he had embraced Christianity and entered into a Christian sponsorship program. He admitted that initially he participated in this program to spend time away from the camp. Later, after forming a good relationship with the married couple who were his Christian sponsors, he pursued a more religious life and was baptized. Although his religious commitment lapsed upon his release from the CYA, he testified that he would once again turn to religion whenever he could rededicate himself fully to it. <i>Id.,</i> at 46-48, 53-55. Finally, he answered in the affirmative when asked if he was \"prepared to contribute in anyway [he] can to society if [he was] put in prison for the rest of [his] life.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 58.</p>\n<p>Respondent's former CYA chaplain testified at the sentencing hearing that respondent's conversion appeared genuine. The chaplain, describing respondent as \"salvageable,\" expressed hope that respondent would contribute to prison ministries if given a life sentence. <i>Id.,</i> at 79-83. An assistant chaplain similarly testified that, based on past experience, respondent likely would be adept at counseling other prisoners to avoid the mistakes he had made when they leave prison. <i>Id.,</i> at 95-96. And respondent's Christian sponsors testified he was like a son to them and had been a positive influence on their own son. They also indicated he had participated in various activities at their church. <i>Id.,</i> at 99-103, 110-114.</p>\n<p>After respondent presented his mitigating evidence, the parties made closing arguments discussing respondent's mitigating evidence and how the jury should consider it. Respondent was also allowed to provide his own statement. The trial judge included in his instructions the disputed factor (k) language, an instruction that has since been amended, see Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 8.85(k) (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In two earlier cases this Court considered a constitutional challenge to the factor (k) instruction. See <i>Brown v. Payton, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Boyde v. California,</i> 494 U.S. 370, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990). In <i>Boyde,</i> the Court rejected a claim that factor (k), with its focus on circumstances \"`extenuat[ing] the gravity of the crime,'\" precluded consideration of mitigating evidence unrelated to the crime, such as evidence of the defendant's background and character. <i>Id.,</i> at 377-378, 386, 110 S.Ct. 1190. The \"proper inquiry,\" the Court explained, \"is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Since the defendant in <i>Boyde</i> \"had an opportunity through factor (k) to argue that his background and character `extenuated' or `excused' the seriousness of the crime,\" the Court saw \"no reason to believe that reasonable jurors would resist the view, `long held by society,' that in an appropriate case such evidence would counsel imposition of a sentence less than death.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 382, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (citing <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 319, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989)). During the sentencing phase in <i>Boyde,</i> moreover, the defense had presented extensive evidence regarding background and character, so construing factor (k) to preclude consideration of that evidence would have required the jurors not only to believe that \"the court's instructions transformed all of this `favorable testimony into a virtual charade,'\" 494 U.S., at 383, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (quoting <i>California v. Brown,</i> 479 U.S. 538, 542, 107 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987)), but also to disregard another instruction requiring the jury to \"`<i>consider all of the evidence</i> which has been received during any part of the trial of this case,'\" 494 U.S., at 383, 110 S.Ct. 1190.</p>\n<p>In <i>Payton,</i> the Court again evaluated arguments that factor (k) barred consideration of constitutionally relevant evidencethis time, evidence relating to postcrime rehabilitation, rather than precrime background and character. See 544 U.S., at 135-136, 125 S.Ct. 1432. <i>Payton</i> did not come to this Court, as had <i>Boyde,</i> on direct review, but rather by federal habeas petition subject to AEDPA. Relief was available only if \"the state court's adjudication of the claim `resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.'\" <i>Payton, supra,</i> at 141, 125 S.Ct. 1432 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)). Although the prosecutor in <i>Payton</i> had argued to the juryincorrectlythat factor (k) did not permit consideration of postcrime rehabilitation evidence, this Court concluded that the California Supreme Court reasonably applied <i>Boyde</i> in finding no Eighth Amendment violation. 544 U.S., at 142, 146-147, 125 S.Ct. 1432. Accepting the prosecutor's reading would have required \"the surprising conclusion that remorse could never serve to lessen or excuse a crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 142, 125 S.Ct. 1432. Furthermore, countering any misimpression created by the prosecution's argument, the defense in <i>Payton</i> had presented extensive evidence and argument regarding a postcrime religious conversion and other good behavior. The trial court had instructed the jury to consider all evidence admitted \"`during any part of the trial in this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed,'\" and the prosecution itself \"devoted substantial attention to discounting [the postcrime evidence's] importance as compared to the aggravating factors.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 145-146, 125 S.Ct. 1432. Hence, the state court in <i>Payton</i> could reasonably have concluded that, as in <i>Boyde,</i> there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction to preclude consideration of the postcrime mitigation evidence it had heard. 544 U.S., at 147, 125 S.Ct. 1432.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>As the Court directed in <i>Boyde,</i> we inquire \"whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\" 494 U.S., at 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Here, as in <i>Payton,</i> respondent argues that factor (k) prevented the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> jury from giving effect to his forward-looking evidence. And, as in <i>Payton,</i> respondent's case comes to this Court in federal habeas proceedings collaterally attacking the state court's ruling. Unlike in <i>Payton,</i> however, the federal petition in this case was filed before AEDPA's effective date. AEDPA and its deferential standards of review are thus inapplicable. See <i>Woodford v. Garceau,</i> 538 U.S. 202, 210, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 155 L.Ed.2d 363 (2003). The Court of Appeals distinguished <i>Payton</i> on this ground. See 414 F.3d, at 1101-1102. It was mistaken, however, to find a \"reasonable probability\" that the jury did not consider respondent's future potential. <i>Id.,</i> at 1138.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals erred by adopting a narrow and, we conclude, an unrealistic interpretation of factor (k). \"Most naturally read,\" the Court of Appeals reasoned, \"this instruction allows the jury to consider evidence that bears upon the commission of the crime by the defendant and excuses or mitigates his culpability for the offense.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1134. As both <i>Boyde</i> and <i>Payton</i> explain, however, this interpretation is too confined. \"The instruction did not ... limit the jury's consideration to `any other circumstance <i>of the crime</i> which extenuates the gravity of the crime.' The jury was directed to consider <i>any other circumstance</i> that might excuse the crime.\" <i>Boyde, supra,</i> at 382, 110 S.Ct. 1190; see also <i>Payton, supra,</i> at 141-142, 125 S.Ct. 1432. And just as precrime background and character <i>(Boyde)</i> and postcrime rehabilitation <i>(Payton)</i> may \"extenuat[e] the gravity of the crime,\" so may some likelihood of future good conduct count as a circumstance tending to make a defendant less deserving of the death penalty. Cf. <i>Skipper,</i> 476 U.S., at 4-5, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (explaining that while inferences regarding future conduct do not \"relate specifically to [a defendant's] culpability for the crime he committed,\" those inferences are \"`mitigating' in the sense that they might serve `as a basis for a sentence less than death'\" (quoting <i>Lockett v. Ohio,</i> 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion))).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals failed to heed the full import of <i>Payton's</i> holding, a holding that has significance even where AEDPA is inapplicable. <i>Payton</i> indicated that reading factor (k) to preclude consideration of postcrime evidence would require \"the surprising conclusion that remorse could never serve to lessen or excuse a crime.\" 544 U.S., at 142, 125 S.Ct. 1432. So, too, would it be counterintuitive if a defendant's capacity to redeem himself through good works could not extenuate his offense and render him less deserving of a death sentence.</p>\n<p>In any event, since respondent sought to extrapolate future behavior from precrime conduct, his mitigation theory was more analogous to the good-character evidence examined in <i>Boyde</i> and held to fall within factor (k)'s purview. See 494 U.S., at 381, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (describing the evidence at issue as including evidence of the defendant's \"strength of character\"). Both types of evidence suggest the crime stemmed more from adverse circumstances than from an irredeemable character. See 414 F.3d, at 1141-1142 (O'Scannlain, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); cf. <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> 509 U.S. 350, 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993) (noting that the \"forward-looking\" future-dangerousness inquiry \"is not independent of an assessment of personal culpability\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Our interpretation of factor (k) is the one most consistent with the evidence presented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*476</span> to the jury, the parties' closing arguments, and the other instructions provided by the trial court. Each of these will be discussed in turn.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals recognized, future-conduct evidence was central to the mitigation case presented by the defense. See 414 F.3d, at 1134. Indeed, although the defense also adduced evidence of a troubled upbringing, respondent testified that he could not use his difficult life \"as a crutch to say I am in a situation right now, I'm here now because of that.\" App. 40. Given this assertion, and considering the extensive forward-looking evidence presented at sentencingevidence including testimony from two prison chaplains, respondent's church sponsors, and respondent himselfthe jurors could have disregarded respondent's future potential only if they drew the unlikely inference that \"the court's instructions transformed all of this `favorable testimony into a virtual charade,'\" <i>Boyde, supra,</i> at 383, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (quoting <i>Brown,</i> 479 U.S., at 542, 107 S.Ct. 837). It is improbable the jurors believed that the parties were engaging in an exercise in futility when respondent presented (and both counsel later discussed) his mitigating evidence in open court.</p>\n<p>Arguments by the prosecution and the defense assumed the evidence was relevant. The prosecutor initially discussed the various factors that were to guide the jury. He referred to factor (k) as \"a catchall.\" App. 153. He then discussed respondent's religious experience in some detail. With respect to whether this experience fit within factor (k), he indicated: \"I'm not sure it really fits in there. I'm not sure it really fits in any of them. But I think it appears to be a proper subject of consideration.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 154. These seemingly contradictory statements are explained by the prosecutor's following comments.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor suggested (quite understandably on the record) that respondent's religious evidence was weak. He stated: \"You know, first of all, it's no secret that the evidence upon which the defendant's religious experience rests is somewhat shaky.\" <i>Ibid.</i> He also opined that the experience had to be taken \"with a grain of salt.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 155. The jury would have realized that, when the prosecutor suggested respondent's religious experience did not fit within factor (k), he was discussing the persuasiveness of the evidence, not the jury's ability to consider it. After all, he thought religion was \"a proper subject of consideration.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 154.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor then discussed how the jury should weigh respondent's \"religious awakening\":</p>\n<blockquote>\"I suppose you can say it would be appropriate becausein this fashion: The defendant may be of value to the community later. You recall the people talking about how he would have the opportunity to work with other prisoners in prison. And I think that value to the community is something that you have to weigh in. There's something to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"On the other hand, the fact that someone has religion as opposed to someone doesn't should be no grounds for either giving or withholding life. I mean let's turn it around and look at the other side of the coin. Suppose someone said he didn't belong to a church and didn't talk to a minister. Would that man deserve to die merely because of that? So if he says he has religion, does he deserve the other penalty, life? I don't think that that should be an influencing factor at all in that respect. I don't think the law contemplates that and I don't think it's right.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 155.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*477</span> These remarks confirmed to the jury that it should analyze respondent's future potential, his future \"value to the community.\" <i>Ibid.</i> This is what respondent himself wanted it to do. And while the prosecutor commented that the law did not contemplate jury consideration of respondent's religious conversion, respondent did not argue that the jury should consider the mere fact that he had discovered religion. Rather, as manifested by his arguments on appeal, respondent wanted to use this religious evidence to demonstrate his future \"value to the community,\" not to illustrate his past religious awakening. Nothing the prosecutor said would have convinced the jury that it was forbidden from even considering respondent's religious conversion, though surely the jury could discount it; and nothing the prosecutor said would have led the jury to think it could not consider respondent's future potential, especially since he indicated that this is exactly what the jury had \"to weigh\" in its deliberation. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>After the prosecutor concluded his arguments, the trial judge allowed respondent to speak on his own behalf. Respondent, while not showing any remorse, suggested that life imprisonment offered \"an opportunity to achieve goals and try to better yourself.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 163. He also stated: \"I myself would really like to have my life and try to improve myself.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 164. Respondent's personal pleas were consistent with a trial in which the jury would assess his future prospects in determining what sentence to impose.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel's closing arguments confirm this analysis. To be sure, commenting on the mitigating evidence, he initially indicated: \"I'm not going to insult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here. That is not the reason I asked these people to come in.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166. Read in context defense counsel's remarks did not imply the jury should ignore the mitigating evidence. Rather, conforming to the dichotomy within factor (k) itself, his remarks merely distinguished between a legal excuse and an extenuating circumstance. Cf. Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 190.3(k) (\"[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime\").</p>\n<p>That defense counsel did, in fact, want the jury to take into account respondent's future potential became manifest near the end of his argument. He suggested that the \"people who came in here [and] told you about [respondent]\" provided the jury with \"a game plan\" for what respondent could do with his life. App. 170. He continued: \"We're just suggesting the tip of the iceberg because who knows in 20, 30, 40, 50 years what sorts of things he can do, as he fits into the system, as he learns to set his goals, to contribute something in whatever way he can.\" <i>Ibid.</i> This would have left the jury believing it could and should contemplate respondent's potential.</p>\n<p>Other instructions from the trial court make it quite implausible that the jury would deem itself foreclosed from considering respondent's full case in mitigation. Before enumerating specific factors for considerationfactors including the circumstances of the crime, the defendant's age, and \"[t]he presence or absence of any prior felony conviction,\" <i>id.,</i> at 184, as well as the factor (k) catchallthe judge told the jury: \"In determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 183. After listing the factors, he indicated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"After having heard all of the evidence and after having heard and considered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*478</span> the arguments of counsel, you shall consider, take into account and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon which you have been instructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"If you conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall impose a sentence of death. However, if you determine that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances, you shall impose a sentence of confinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 185.</blockquote>\n<p>The judge then gave a supplemental instruction regarding aggravating and mitigating factors:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I have previously read to you the list of aggravating circumstances which the law permits you to consider if you find that any of them is established by the evidence. These are the only aggravating circumstances that you may consider. You are not allowed to take account of any other facts or circumstances as the basis for deciding that the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"However, the mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose a death penalty or a death sentence upon Mr. Belmontes. You should pay careful attention to each of these factors. Any one of them standing alone may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 185-186.</blockquote>\n<p>Given the evidence and arguments presented to the jury, these instructions eliminate any reasonable likelihood that a juror would consider respondent's future prospects to be beyond the bounds of proper consideration. The judge told the jury to consider \"all of the evidence,\" and \"all of the evidence\" included respondent's forward-looking mitigation case. While the judge did end his broad command to appraise all the evidence with the qualifier \"except as you may be hereafter instructed,\" <i>id.,</i> at 183, he did not later instruct the jury that it should disregard respondent's future potential in prison. The jury could not fairly read the limitation in the instruction to apply to respondent's central mitigation theory. By contrast, in response to a juror's question, the trial judge specifically instructed the jury not to consider whether respondent could receive psychiatric treatment while in prison.</p>\n<p>The sharp contrast between the court's instruction on aggravation (that only enumerated factors could be considered) and its instruction on mitigation (that listed factors were \"merely ... examples,\" <i>id.,</i> at 186) made it clear that the jury was to take a broad view of mitigating evidence. Coming back to back, the instructions conveyed the message that the jury should weigh the finite aggravators against the potentially infinite mitigators. That the trial judge told the jury to \"pay careful attention\" to the listed mitigating factors, <i>ibid.,</i> moreover, did not compel the jury to give them sole consideration. For this to be the case, the jury would have had to fail to take the judge at his word. The judge did not advise the jury to pay exclusive attention to the listed mitigating circumstances, and he had told the jury that these circumstances were simply examples.</p>\n<p>It is implausible that the jury supposed that past deeds pointing to a constructive future could not \"extenuat[e] the gravity of the crime,\" as required by factor (k), much less that such evidence could not be considered at all. <i>Boyde</i> concludes that in jury deliberations \"commonsense understanding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*479</span> of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial [is] likely to prevail over technical hair-splitting.\" 494 U.S., at 381, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Here, far from encouraging the jury to ignore the defense's central evidence, the instructions supported giving it due weight.</p>\n<p>In concluding otherwise, the Court of Appeals cited queries from some of the jurors as evidence of confusion. Although the jury's initial question is not in the record, it appeared to ask the judge about the consequences of failing to reach a unanimous verdict. Cf. 414 F.3d, at 1135. In response, the judge reread portions of the instructions and stated that \"all 12 jurors must agree, if you can.\" App. 190. Before the judge sent the jury back for further deliberation, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HERN: The statement about the aggravation and mitigation of the circumstances, now, that was the listing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: That was the listing, yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HERN: Of those certain factors we were to decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: That is right. It is a balancing process. Mr. Meyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR MEYER: A specific question, would this be an either/or situation, not a one, if you cannot the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: No. It is not that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR MEYER: It is an either/or situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: Exactly. If you can make that either/or decision. If you cannot, then I will discharge you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HAILSTONE: Could I ask a question? I don't know if it is permissible. Is it possible that he could have psychiatric treatment during this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: That is something you cannot consider in making your decision.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 191.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court of Appeals decided Juror Hern's questions indicated she thought (incorrectly) that only listed mitigating factors were on the tablean error, in the Court of Appeals' view, that should have prompted a clarifying instruction confirming that all the mitigating evidence was relevant. 414 F.3d, at 1136. The Court of Appeals further supposed the response to Juror Hailstone's question compounded the problem, since psychiatric treatment presumably would be necessary only in aid of future rehabilitation. <i>Id.,</i> at 1137.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals' analysis is flawed. To begin with, attributing to Juror Hern a dilemma over the scope of mitigation is only one way to interpret her questions, and, as the California Supreme Court observed on direct review, it is not necessarily the correct one, see <i>Belmontes,</i> 45 Cal.3d, at 804, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d, at 344. It is at least as likely that the juror was simply asking for clarification about California's overall balancing process, which requires juries to consider and balance enumerated factors (such as age and criminal history) that are labeled neither as mitigating nor as aggravating. As Juror Hern surmised (but sought to clarify), the jury itself must determine the side of the balance on which each listed factor falls. See Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 190.3 (providing that, \"[i]n determining the penalty, the trier of fact shall take into account\" any relevant listed factors); see generally <i>Tuilaepa v. California,</i> 512 U.S. 967, 978-979, 114 S.Ct. 2630, 129 L.Ed.2d 750 (1994) (noting that the § 190.3 sentencing factors \"do not instruct the sentencer how to weigh any of the facts it finds in deciding upon the ultimate sentence\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*480</span> Even assuming the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted Juror Hern's questions, the court's conclusion that this juror likely ignored forward-looking evidence presupposes what it purports to establish, namely, that forward-looking evidence could not fall within factor (k). As discussed earlier, nothing barred the jury from viewing respondent's future prospects as \"extenuat[ing] the gravity of the crime,\" so nothing barred it from considering such evidence under the rubric of the \"listing.\" As for Juror Hailstone's psychiatric-care question, this inquiry shows that, if anything, the jurors were considering respondent's potential. The trial court's response, far from implying a broad prohibition on forward-looking inferences, was readily explicable by the absence of any evidence in the record regarding psychiatric care.</p>\n<p>In view of our analysis and disposition in this case it is unnecessary to address an argument for reversing the Court of Appeals based on the Court's holding in <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> 509 U.S. 350, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993), a subject raised by Judge O'Scannlain in his separate opinion in the Court of Appeals. See 414 F.3d, at 1141-1142 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>In this case, as in <i>Boyde</i> and as in <i>Payton,</i> the jury heard mitigating evidence, the trial court directed the jury to consider all the evidence presented, and the parties addressed the mitigating evidence in their closing arguments. This Court's cases establish, as a general rule, that a jury in such circumstances is not reasonably likely to believe itself barred from considering the defense's evidence as a factor \"extenuat[ing] the gravity of the crime.\" The factor (k) instruction is consistent with the constitutional right to present mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I adhere to my view that limiting a jury's discretion to consider all mitigating evidence does not violate the Eighth Amendment. See <i>Walton v. Arizona,</i> 497 U.S. 639, 673, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Even accepting the Court's jurisprudence to the contrary, however, this is arguably an easy case, given our reiteration in <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> 509 U.S. 350, 372, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993), that a jury need only \"be able to consider in some manner all of a defendant's relevant mitigating evidence,\" and need not \"be able to give effect to mitigating evidence in every conceivable manner in which the evidence might be relevant.\" But since petitioner has not relied on <i>Johnson,</i> as Judge O'Scannlain did below, see <i>Belmontes v. Brown,</i> 414 F.3d 1094, 1141-1142 (C.A.9 2005) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), I am content to join in full the Court's opinion, which correctly applies <i>Boyde v. California,</i> 494 U.S. 370, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990).</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lockett v. Ohio,</i> 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), the Court set aside Ohio's death penalty statute as unconstitutional because it unduly restricted the mitigating evidence that a jury could consider in deciding whether to impose the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*481</span> death penalty. In his opinion announcing the judgment, Chief Justice Burger wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\"There is no perfect procedure for deciding in which cases governmental authority should be used to impose death. But a statute that prevents the sentencer in all capital cases from giving independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant's character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty. When the choice is between life and death, that risk is unacceptable and incompatible with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 605[, 98 S.Ct. 2954] (plurality opinion).</blockquote>\n<p>The respondent here, Fernando Belmontes, was sentenced to death in 1982, a scant four years after <i>Lockett.</i> See <i>People v. Belmontes,</i> 45 Cal.3d 744, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d 310 (1988). Yet at the time of his sentencing, there remained significant residual confusion as to whether the Constitution obligated States to permit juries to consider evidence that, while not extenuating the defendant's culpability for the crime, might nevertheless call for a sentence less than death. Cf. <i>People v. Easley,</i> 34 Cal.3d 858, 875-880, 196 Cal. Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813, 823-827 (1983) (noting arguments on both sides).</p>\n<p>The California death penalty statute in effect in 1982 quite plainly rested on the assumption that California could preclude the consideration of such evidence. The statute commanded that the jury \"shall impose\" a death sentence if aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, and limited the jury's inquiry to 11 discrete categories of evidence. See Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 190.3 (West 1988). Other than factors relating to the defendant's age and prior criminal record, every one of those categories relates to the severity of the crime of which the defendant was convicted.<sup>[1]</sup> And while the eleventh catchall \"factor (k)\" authorized consideration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*482</span> of \"[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime,\" § 190.3(k), factor (k)'s restrictive language sent the unmistakable message that California juries could properly give no mitigating weight to evidence that did not extenuate the severity of the crime.</p>\n<p>Just a year after respondent's sentencing the California Supreme Court evinced considerable discomfort with factor (k). In <i>People v. Easley</i><i>,</i> after discussing the possible unconstitutionality of the penalty phase instructions, the court inserted a critical footnote effectively amending factor (k) and expanding the evidence that a California jury could properly consider in deciding whether to impose a death sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In order to avoid potential misunderstanding in the future, trial courtsin instructing on [factor (k)]should inform the jury that it may consider as a mitigating factor `any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime' and <i>any other `aspect of [the] defendant's character or record ... that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than</i> death.'\" 34 Cal.3d, at 878, n. 10, 196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d, at 826, n. 10 (emphasis added).<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Although <i>Easley</i> came too late to help respondent, the California Supreme Court's evident concern that capital juries must be permitted to consider evidence beyond that which \"extenuates the gravity of the crime\" proved prescient. In <i>Skipper v. South Carolina,</i> 476 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986)decided two years before the California Supreme Court affirmed respondent's conviction and therefore fully applicable here, see <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> 479 U.S. 314, 322-323, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987)we expressly rejected the argument, presented in Justice Powell's separate opinion, that the States retained the authority to determine what mitigating evidence is relevant \"as long as they do not foreclose consideration of factors that may tend to reduce the defendant's culpability for his crime,\" see <i>Skipper,</i> 476 U.S., at 11, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (opinion concurring in judgment). Apart from the traditional sentencing factors such as \"[e]vidence concerning the degree of the defendant's participation in the crime, or his age and emotional history,\" Justice Powell would have held that States could properly exclude evidence during a capital sentencing proceeding. <i>Id.,</i> at 13, 106 S.Ct. 1669. The majority, however, took a more expansive view. Although it recognized that the probative force of Skipper's excluded evidence \"would not relate specifically to petitioner's culpability <i>for the crime he committed,</i> [there was] no question but that such inferences would be `mitigating' in the sense that they might serve `as a basis for a sentence less than death.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 4-5, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (quoting <i>Lockett,</i> 438 U.S., at 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (plurality opinion); emphasis added). After <i>Skipper,</i> then, the law was clear: A capital jury must be allowed to consider a broader category of mitigating evidence than normally relevant in noncapital proceedings.</p>\n<p>Respondent was sentenced, however, before <i>Easley</i> rewrote factor (k) and before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*483</span> <i>Skipper</i> resolved the confusion over whether States had the constitutional latitude to restrict evidence that did not \"tend to reduce the defendant's culpability for his crime,\" 476 U.S., at 11, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). As the following review of the record will underscore, that confusion pervaded every aspect of respondent's sentencing hearing. It addled the trial judge, the prosecutor, defense counsel, andinevitablythe jurors themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, after the prosecution put on its casewhich consisted mainly of evidence of respondent's previous conduct, see <i>Belmontes,</i> 45 Cal.3d, at 795, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d, at 338-339respondent countered with testimony from his grandfather and his mother. That testimony focused almost entirely on respondent's background: His father drank to excess and savagely beat his wife; his parents were divorced when he was 9 or 10 years old; his mother remarried, but again divorced when respondent was 14 or 15 years old; at this point respondent became difficult to control, and, in 1979, he was sent to the California Youth Authority (Youth Authority); after his release, respondent did not live with his mother, although he kept in touch with her by telephone and was very close with his 15-year-old sister. See generally App. 5-22.</p>\n<p>Next, the jury heard testimony from Robert Martinez and his wife Darlene, both of whom testified that they were close friends with respondent but admitted that they had seen him only once after he was released from the Youth Authority. <i>Id.,</i> at 26-27, 35. Robert further testified that respondent was the best man at his wedding and that, prior to his wedding, the two of them would spend a lot of time together, working on Martinez's car, drinking beer, and smoking marijuana. <i>Id.,</i> at 25, 28. The focus of Darlene's testimony was that she was a born-again Christian, and that, when respondent visited Darlene and her husband after his release from the Youth Authority, he told her that he was also a born-again Christian. <i>Id.,</i> at 35-36.</p>\n<p>Respondent then testified on his own behalf. When asked about his childhood, respondent answered that he \"can't use it as a crutch to say I am in a situation right now, I'm here now because of that.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 40. He went on to describe his relationships with his father and grandfather and to relate his experience at the Youth Authority. <i>Id.,</i> at 41-5. Respondent testified that, while at the Youth Authority, he became involved in a Christian program and developed a relationship with his sponsors in that program, Beverly and Fred Haro. <i>Id.,</i> at 46-48. Upon his release, however, respondent started having problems and abandoned his religious commitment, something he had not yet regained fully at the time of the sentencing hearing. <i>Id.,</i> at 53-54. Respondent then described his life in prison and stated that, were he given a life sentence, he would attempt to make a positive contribution to society. <i>Id.,</i> at 55-58. On cross-examination, most of the prosecutor's questions focused on the sincerity of respondent's religious commitment. <i>Id.,</i> at 58-65.</p>\n<p>The following day, respondent presented testimony from Reverend Dale Barrett and Don Miller, both ministers who worked at the Youth Authority location where respondent was held. Reverend Barrett described the Youth Authority's M-2 program through which respondent was matched with the Haros. <i>Id.,</i> at 74-76. He then testified about respondent's involvement with the church and the M-2 program, and how his interactions with respondent led him to believe that he was \"salvageable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 76-82. Miller similarly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*484</span> testified about respondent's participation in the program and his belief that respondent would be adept at speaking with other prisoners about accepting religion. <i>Id.,</i> at 92, 95-96; see also <i>id.,</i> at 96 (testifying that respondent would \"[d]efinitely... be used in the prison system for this sort of activity\").</p>\n<p>Finally, the jury heard testimony from respondent's sponsors in the M-2 program, Fred and Beverly Haro. The Haros described meeting respondent and their experiences with him. See generally <i>id.,</i> at 99-104; 110-112. They also testified about how close they had grown to respondent and about respondent's embrace of religion. <i>Id.,</i> at 101-102; 112-113.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, the sentencing testimony supports three conclusions: First, excepting questions concerning the sincerity of respondent's religious convictions, there was no significant dispute about the credibility of the witnesses; second, little if any of the testimony extenuated the severity of respondent's crime; and third, the testimony afforded the jury a principled basis for imposing a sentence other than death.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The prosecutor began his closing argument at the penalty phase by describing \"th[e] listing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances\" and instructing the jury that it must \"weigh one against the other.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 148. While he observed that \"there is a proper place for sympathy and passion,\" <i>ibid.,</i> the prosecutor emphasized that the jury could only consider \"the kind of sympathy the instruction tells you to consider [<i>i.e.,</i> sympathy that] naturally arises or properly arises <i>from the factors in aggravation and mitigation,</i>\" <i>id.,</i> at 149 (emphasis added). He repeated to the jury that its duty was to \"simpl[y] weig[h]\" certain factors that the judge \"will tell you that you may take into account,\" <i>id.,</i> at 150-151, and he went through those listed factors one by one, carefully discussing the evidence that supported each factor, <i>id.,</i> at 151-157.</p>\n<p>When the prosecutor turned to factor (k), he directly addressed the theory \"that the defendant's religious experience is within that catchall that relates to the defendant at the time he committed the crime, extenuates the gravity of the crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 154. The prosecutor expressed doubt that the jury could consider the evidence at all, stating \"I'm not sure it really fits in there. I'm not sure it really fits in any of them. But I think it appears to be a proper subject of consideration.\" <i>Ibid.</i> And again, after discussing the evidence supporting respondent's religious experience, the prosecutor questioned: \"[I]s a religious awakening a basis for determining penalty? That's really the issue, how much does that weigh, or does it weigh on one side or the other.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 155. Ultimately, the prosecutor concluded: \"I suppose you can say it would be appropriate becausein this fashion: The defendant may be of value to the community later .... And I think that value to the community is something that you have to weigh in. There's something to that.\" <i>Ibid.</i> But immediately thereafter, the prosecutor told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote>\"On the other hand, the fact that someone has religion as opposed to someone doesn't should be no grounds for either giving or withholding life .... So if he says he has religion, does he deserve the other penalty, life? I don't think that that should be an influencing factor at all in that respect. <i>I don't think the law contemplates that and I don't think it's right.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, the prosecutor described the circumstances of the crime and asserted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*485</span> that \"[a] dreadful crime requires a dreadful penalty ....\" <i>Id.,</i> at 160.</p>\n<p>Following the prosecutor's closing argument, the trial judge allowed respondent to address the jury directly. Respondent again stated that he could not use his childhood as a crutch to explain his mistakes, and he said that his Christianity, too, could not be used as a crutch. <i>Id.,</i> at 162. Respondent then asked to keep his life, explaining that he understood that he had to pay for the victim's death, but that he wanted the opportunity to try to improve himself in the future. <i>Id.,</i> at 163.</p>\n<p>Respondent's attorney, John Schick, then addressed the jury. He made no effort to persuade the jurors that the mitigating evidence somehow extenuated the severity of the crime. On the contrary, he said \"I'm not going to insult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here. That is not the reason I asked these people to come in.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166. Instead, he argued that respondent might be able to make a positive contribution in a prison environment. He spoke about the way that respondent improved after he met Beverly and Fred Haro and about the way that respondent's religion shaped him, observing that religion plays a \"very, very vital function ... in anybody's life.\" <i>Ibid.</i> But Schick took care to emphasize that religion \"does not excuse\" the murder; rather, the point of that mitigating evidence was to let the jury \"know something about the man.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 167, 166. He admitted that respondent \"cannot make it on the outside,\" <i>id.,</i> at 167, recognized that respondent needed to be punished, and asked that the jury impose life in prison, a punishment \"that has meaning, that has teeth in it ...,\" <i>id.,</i> at 169. Critically, Schick contended that life in prison was an appropriate sentence because respondent could, if given the chance, \"contribute something in whatever way he can.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 170.</p>\n<p>In sum, both counsel agreed that <i>none</i> of the mitigating evidence could detract from the gravity of the crime, and defense counsel even insisted that it would \"insult\" the jury to suggest that the mitigating evidence \"excuses in any way what happened.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>At a conference on jury instructions with the two counsel, the trial judge plainly indicated that he believed that factor (k) circumscribed the mitigating evidence the jury could consider. The judge lifted the principal jury instructions verbatim from 7 of the 11 traditional sentencing factors set forth in the statute, App. 184, but he refused defense counsel's request to give the jury a separate list of potential mitigating factors, <i>id.,</i> at 142-143. Among those requested were two that specifically instructed the jury to consider respondent's ability to perform constructive work in prison and to live in confinement without acts of violence. See Brief for Respondent 5, n. 1. Those instructions would have been entirely properindeed, probably mandatedunder our holding in <i>Skipper.</i> But the prosecutor, not having the benefit of <i>Skipper,</i> argued to the judge that \"none [of the proposed mitigating instructions] here ... relates to circumstances concerning the crime. I can't conceal the fact that I think that is the determinative factor in this case.\" App. 142. Agreeing, the judge refused to include the mitigating instructions, making the astonishing statement that the instructions already \"seem to be a little over-laden with the factors in mitigation rather than in aggravation.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Of particular importance, the judge modified defense counsel's request that the jury be told that the instructions did not contain an exhaustive list of mitigating factors. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*486</span> <i>Id.,</i> at 141. While he did give such an instruction, <i>ante,</i> at 477-478, he refused to include the following requested reference to nonstatutory factors: \"`You may also consider any other circumstances [relating to the case or the defendant, Mr. Belmontes,] as reasons for not imposing the death sentence.'\" Brief for Respondent 25-26; contra, App. 186. The judge thus expressly <i>declined</i> to invite the jury to weigh \"potentially infinite mitigators,\" contrary to the Court's assumption today, see <i>ante,</i> at 478. A more accurate summary of his rulings is that the jury could weigh nonstatutory circumstancesbut only if they extenuated the severity of respondent's offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The next morning, the trial judge gave the jurors their instructions. He opened with the unyielding admonition that \"[y]ou must accept and follow the rules of law as I state them to you,\" App. 175, and explained that he was required to read the instructions aloud even though they would have a written copy available during their deliberations, <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>After reading a set of boilerplate instructions, <i>id.,</i> at 176-183, the judge turned to the subject of \"determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant,\" <i>id.,</i> at 183. He told the jury to \"consider all of the evidence ... <i>except as you may be hereafter instructed,</i>\" <i>ibid.</i> (emphasis added), and then stated: \"You shall consider, take into account and be guided by the following factors, if applicable,\" <i>id.,</i> at 183-184. He then proceeded to repeat verbatim 7 of the 11 factors set forth in the statute. <i>Id.,</i> at 184. Except for the reference to the \"age of the defendant at the time of the crime,\" <i>ibid.,</i> every one of those factors related to the severity of the crime itself. See n. 1, <i>supra.</i> The last of them, the factor (k) instruction, focused the jury's attention on any circumstance that \"extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\" <i>Ibid.</i> No factor permitted the jury to consider \"any other `aspect of [the] defendant's character or record ... that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.'\" <i>Easley,</i> 34 Cal.3d, at 878, n. 10, 196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d, at 826, n. 10 (quoting <i>Lockett,</i> 438 U.S., at 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p>Emphasizing the importance of the listing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the judge next instructed the jury that it \"shall consider, take into account and be guided <i>by the applicable factors</i> of aggravating and mitigating circumstances <i>upon which you have been instructed.</i>\" App. 185 (emphasis added). In other words, in reaching its decision, the jury was to consider each of the \"applicable factors\"here, the seven factors the judge just finished readingand no others.</p>\n<p>As the Court points out, <i>ante,</i> at 478, the judge did tell the jury that \"the mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose ... a death sentence...,\" App. 186. But immediately afterwards, he instructed the jury to \"pay careful attention to each of <i>these factors.</i> Any one of them standing alone may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Since none of \"these factors\" (save for the age of the defendant) encompassed any mitigating circumstance unrelated to the severity of the crime, the most natural reading of the instruction is that any mitigating factor <i>that lessens the severity of the offense</i> may support a sentence other than death. On this view, any other mitigating circumstance is simply irrelevant to (in the prosecutor's words) the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*487</span> \"simple weighing\" the jury was tasked with performing. <i>Id.,</i> at 150.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Questions asked by at least six different jurors during almost two full days of deliberation gave the judge an ample opportunity to clarify that the testimony offered on behalf of respondent, if credited by the jury, provided a permissible basis for imposing a sentence other than death. Far from eliminating their obvious confusion, his responses cemented the impression that the jurors' lone duty was to weigh specified, limited statutory factors against each other.</p>\n<p>After a lunch break, the judge reconvened the jury to answer a question that does not appear in the record; in response, the judge merely reread instructions telling the jury that it \"must agree, if [it] can,\" and that it \"shall consider, take into account and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances <i>upon which you have been instructed.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 185, 188-189 (emphasis added). Because all of those factors were traditional sentencing factors, and because none of them permitted consideration of <i>Skipper</i>-type mitigating evidence, the judge's response was the functional equivalent of yet another admonition to disregard most of respondent's evidence.</p>\n<p>After a colloquy between the judge and four different jurors (Hailstone, Wilson, Norton, and Huckabay) about the likelihood of reaching a unanimous verdict,<sup>[3]</sup> other jurors asked the judge a series of questions reflecting a concern about whether it was proper to consider aggravating or mitigating circumstances other than those specifically listed in his instructions:</p>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HERN: The statement about the aggravation and mitigation of the circumstances, now, that was the listing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: That was the listing, yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HERN: Of those certain factors we were to decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: That is right. It is a balancing process. Mr. Meyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR MEYER: A specific question, would this be an either/or situation, not a one, if you cannot the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: No. It is not that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR MEYER: It is an either/or situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: Exactly. If you can make that either/or decision. If you cannot, then I will discharge you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HAILSTONE: Could I ask a question? I don't know if it is permissible. Is it possible that he could have psychiatric treatment during this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> \"THE COURT: That is something you cannot consider in making your decision.\" App. 191.</blockquote>\n<p>The judge's responses strongly suggest that the \"listing\"the listed statutory factorswas all that the jury could properly consider when \"balanc[ing] the sheet.\" See n. 1, <i>supra.</i> But it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how evidence relating to future conduct even arguably \"extenuate[d] the gravity of the crime\"<sup>[4]</sup> under factor (k), and none of those listed factors gave the jury the chance to consider whether respondent might redeem himself in prison. Cf. <i>Brown v. Payton,</i> 544 U.S. 133, 157, 125 S.Ct. 1432, 161 L.Ed.2d 334 (2005) (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\"[I]t would be more than a stretch to say that the seriousness of the crime itself is affected by a defendant's subsequent experience\"). And rather than inviting an open-ended review of mitigating factors that would include consideration of the defendant's possible future behavior in prison, the judge's answers emphasized the constraints on the \"either/or\" decision the jurors had to make.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The arguments of counsel, the actual instructions to the jury, and this colloquy all support the conclusion that the jurors understood their task was to run through the listed statutory factors and weigh them against each other to determine whether respondent should be sentenced to death. Very little of respondent's evidence, however, even arguably \"extenuate[d] the gravity of the crime.\" In my judgment, it is for that reason much more likely than not that the jury believed that the law forbade it from giving that evidence any weight at all. The Court of Appeals therefore correctly set aside respondent's death sentence. See <i>Boyde v. California,</i> 494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990) (plurality opinion) (requiring that a defendant show only that \"there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>Nothing in the Court's opinion in <i>Boyde</i> upsets my view that respondent's death sentence cannot stand. Over the dissent of four Justices, the Court in <i>Boyde</i> both adopted a new \"legal standard for reviewing jury instructions claimed to restrict impermissibly a jury's consideration of relevant evidence,\" <i>id.,</i> at 378, 110 S.Ct. 1190, and approved a blatantly atextual interpretation of the unadorned factor (k) instruction, <i>id.,</i> at 382, and n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Applying its new standard and its dubious reading of factor (k), the Court held that there was \"not a reasonable likelihood that Boyde's jurors interpreted the trial court's instructions to prevent consideration of mitigating evidence of background and character.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 381, 110 S.Ct. 1190.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> The Court rejected Boyde's argument that factor (k) made it impossible for the jury to consider testimony that Boyde had won a prize for dance choreography while in prison, which Boyde argued was <i>Skipper</i>-type evidence relating to whether \"he could lead a useful life behind bars,\" 494 U.S., at 382, n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190. But the Court did not hold or suggest that factor (k) allowed for the consideration of <i>Skipper</i>-type evidence. Instead, the Court found that the evidence of his dance choreography talents was presented as part of his \"overall strategy to portray himself <i>as less culpable</i> than other defendants due to his disadvantaged background and his character strengths,\" 494 U.S., at 382, n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (emphasis added), and therefore fell within the ambit of factor (k). Thus, although the <i>Boyde</i> opinion does not state so explicitly, it assumes that the factor (k) instruction would not permit the jury to consider <i>Skipper</i>-type \"evidence of postcrime good prison behavior to show that [a defendant] would not pose a danger to the prison community if sentenced to life imprisonment rather than death.\" 494 U.S., at 382, n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190; see also <i>Skipper,</i> 476 U.S., at 4, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (recognizing that inferences regarding a defendant's \"probable future conduct if sentenced to life in prison ... would not relate specifically to [the defendant's] culpability for the crime he committed\"); <i>Payton,</i> 544 U.S., at 164, 125 S.Ct. 1432 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\"<i>Boyde</i> did not purport to hold that factor (k) naturally called for consideration of postcrime changes of fundamental views\").</p>\n<p>Here, respondent contends that there is a reasonable likelihood that the judge's instructions prevented the jury from considering precrime, forward-looking mitigation evidence regarding the possibility that he would lead a constructive life in a prison setting. Not only does the Court's opinion in <i>Boyde</i> fail to support the improbable argument that respondent's mitigating evidence falls within factor (k)'s purview, but its reasoning is entirely consistent with the Court of Appeals' contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Court's recent decision in <i>Payton</i> has little bearing here. In <i>Payton,</i> we granted certiorari to decide whether the Ninth Circuit's decision affirming the District Court's grant of habeas relief \"was contrary to the limits on federal habeas review imposed by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\" 544 U.S., at 136, 125 S.Ct. 1432. In concluding that it was, the Court relied heavily on the deferential standard of habeas review established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214. See 544 U.S., at 141, 125 S.Ct. 1432. And Justice BREYER specifically stated that he only joined the five-Justice majority because \"this is a case in which Congress' instruction to defer to the reasonable conclusions of state-court judges makes a critical difference,\" <i>id.,</i> at 148, 125 S.Ct. 1432 (concurring opinion), explaining that, were he a California state judge, he \"would likely hold that Payton's penalty-phase proceedings violated the Eighth Amendment [because] there might well have been a reasonable likelihood that Payton's jury interpreted factor (k) in a way that prevented it from considering constitutionally relevant mitigating evidencenamely, evidence of his postcrime religious conversion,\" <i>ibid.</i> (citation, alteration, and internal quotation marks omitted). The fact that <i>Payton</i> was a case about deference under AEDPA, rather than about a proper understanding of the scope of factor (k), is cause enough to conclude that it does not mandate any specific outcome here.</p>\n<p>Indeed, given that respondent's trial occurred the same year and involved the same jury instructions as Payton's, compare 544 U.S., at 156, 125 S.Ct. 1432 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\"`[Y]ou shall <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial in this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed'\"), with App. 183 (same), and because AEDPA does not apply to respondent's case, there are persuasive reasons for concluding that Justice SOUTER's powerful reasoning in <i>Payton,</i> rather than the majority's deferential review of a California court's opinion, should guide our decision. In his dissenting opinion, Justice SOUTER pointed out that Payton's trial had occurred both before the California Supreme Court had directed trial judges to supplement the factor (k) instruction and before the legislature had amended it. See 544 U.S., at 158, 125 S.Ct. 1432. Without those changes, he correctly concluded, \"any claim that factor (k) called for consideration of a defendant's personal development in the wake of his crime was simply at odds with common attitudes and the English language.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 158-159, 125 S.Ct. 1432.</p>\n<p>Moreover, <i>Payton</i> did not deal with a record that discloses actual confusion among jurors, as this record does. See <i>supra,</i> at 486-488. Nor did it involve a defense attorney who, bolstering the prosecutor's claim that factor (k) did not allow the jury to consider respondent's religious conversion, refused to \"insult\" the jury \"by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here,\" App. 166. Therefore, even ignoring its significantly different procedural posture, <i>Payton,</i> like <i>Boyde,</i> falls far short of compelling the result that the Court reaches today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII</h2>\n<p>Instead of accepting that lay jurors would almost certainly give the words \"circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime\" their ordinary meaning, the Court insists that they would have disregarded their instructions and considered evidence that had nothing whatsoever to do with the crime. This conclusion seems to me to rest on an assumption that the jury had an uncanny ability to predict that future opinions would interpret factor (k) to mean something that neither the judge nor the lawyers thought it meant. Surely the more natural inference is that the jury followed its instructions. See <i>Greer v. Miller,</i> 483 U.S. 756, 766, n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987) (describing our \"presumption\" that juries follow instructions).</p>\n<p>The Court's highly technical parsing of factor (k) depends on linguistic distinctions which would only occur to trained lawyers. See, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 477 (calling attention to the \"dichotomy within factor (k) ... between a legal excuse and an extenuating circumstance\"). And even the lawyers are confused. The prosecutor in <i>Payton</i> believed that \"factor (k) d[oes] not permit consideration of postcrime rehabilitation evidence.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 474. While the majority now blithely characterizes this view as \"incorrec[t],\" <i>ibid.,</i> it is the natural reading of factor (k), and one that jurors would have been likely to accept. Similarly, present-day counsel for the State of California expressed confusion at oral argument as to whether it would have been constitutional for the trial judge to instruct the jury that it could not consider any mitigating evidence unless it extenuated the gravity of the crime, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9 (retreating from the statement that \"[i]t would appear not to be\" constitutional). The Court cannot seriously insist that a group of 12 laypersons had such command of constitutional law that, anticipating <i>Skipper,</i> they took into account evidence outside the ambit of their jury instructions.</p>\n<p>The Court also apparently believes that when the prosecutor in this case suggested <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> that factor (k) meant exactly what it said, <i>supra,</i> at 475-476, the jury would have taken that as merely a comment on respondent's credibility, <i>ante,</i> at 476. But this rests on a clear misreading of the record. Although the prosecutor did argue that respondent lacked sincere religious convictions, he <i>also</i> suggested quite powerfully that the law did not permit the jury to consider those convictions, however sincerely held. See App. 155 (\"I don't think the law contemplates that <i>and</i> I don't think it's right\" (emphasis added)). Nor is there any support for the Court's surprising and inherently contradictory view that while the prosecutor here \"commented that the law did not contemplate jury consideration of respondent's religious conversion,\" <i>ante,</i> at 477, \"<i>[n]othing the prosecutor said</i> would have convinced the jury that it was forbidden from even considering respondent's religious conversion,\" <i>ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Admittedly, as the Court points out, there is a distinction between limiting the jury's consideration to \"circumstance[s] <i>of the crime</i>\" that extenuate its severity, and limiting that consideration to \"<i>any other circumstance</i> that might excuse the crime,\" see <i>ante,</i> at 475 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is highly unlikely, however, that jurors would note that subtle distinction, and even more unlikely that they would consider it significant. Both interpretations of the phrase focus the jury's attention on the crime, and neither includes the evidence at issue in <i>Skipper,</i> which \"[a]lmost by definition ... neither excuses the defendant's crime nor reduces his responsibility for its commission.\" 476 U.S., at 12, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). Read however generously, the factor (k) limitation remains unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The Court makes a similarly unpersuasive argument based on the dubious premise that a juror would understand \"remorse\" to be a species of postcrime evidence that serves to lessen or excuse the crime itself. Even if that were true, it would not follow that jurors could somehow divine that respondent's evidence of a capacity to redeem himself would both \"extenuate his offense and render him less deserving of a death sentence.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 475.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VIII</h2>\n<p>Unless the jurors who imposed the death sentence somehow guessed at the breadth of the rule first announced in <i>Lockett,</i> that sentence was the product of an unconstitutional proceeding. Ironically, both Chief Justice Burger (who wrote the plurality opinion in <i>Lockett</i>) and Justice Powell (who joined it) understood the <i>Lockett</i> rule to extend only to evidence \"that lessens the defendant's culpability for the crime.\" <i>Skipper,</i> 476 U.S., at 12, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C.J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). Given that the authors of <i>Lockett</i> themselves disagreed as to its scope, I am not as sanguine as the Court that the lay members of the jury somehow knew, notwithstanding clear jury instructions, that the testimony presented at the sentencing phase of respondent's trial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> could be part of the \"simple weighing\" the jury was supposed to undertake.</p>\n<p>When the trial judge told the jurors to consider all the evidence \"except as you may be hereinafter instructed,\" App. 183, he directed them to limit their consideration to the traditional sentencing factors set forth in the statute. When the prosecutor told the jurors that \"I don't think the law contemplates\" that respondent's religion lessened the seriousness of respondent's offense, <i>id.,</i> at 155, he reinforced the impression that the jury should confine its deliberations to the listing. And once defense counsel <i>agreed</i> with the prosecutor, saying that \"I'm not going to insult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here,\" <i>id.,</i> at 166, surely at least some of the jurors would have doubted the propriety of speculating about respondent's future conduct in prison as a basis for imposing a sentence less than death.</p>\n<p>The Court today heaps speculation on speculation to reach the strange conclusion, out of step with our case law, that a properly instructed jury disregarded its instructions and considered evidence that fell outside the narrow confines of factor (k). Holding to the contrary, the Court insists, would reduce two days of sentencing testimony to \"a virtual charade,\" <i>ante,</i> at 474 (internal quotation marks omitted) but in so concluding the Court necessarily finds that the judge's instructions were themselves such a \"charade\" that the jury paid them no heed. I simply cannot believe that the jurors took it upon themselves to consider testimony they were all but told they were forbidden from considering; in my view, they must at the very least have been confused as to whether the evidence could appropriately be considered. That confusion has created a risk of error sufficient to warrant relief for a man who has spent more than half his life on death row. Cf. <i>Lackey v. Texas,</i> 514 U.S. 1045, 115 S.Ct. 1421, 131 L.Ed.2d 304 (1995) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari). The incremental value to California of carrying out a death sentence at this late date is far outweighed by the interest in maintaining confidence in the fairness of any proceeding that results in a State's decision to take the life of one of its citizens. See <i>Gardner v. Florida,</i> 430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Those categories are:\n</p>\n<p>\"(a) The circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true ....</p>\n<p>\"(b) The presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use force or violence.</p>\n<p>\"(c) The presence or absence of any prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p>\"(d) Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p>\"(e) Whether or not the victim was a participant in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act.</p>\n<p>\"(f) Whether or not the offense was committed under circumstances which the defendant reasonably believed to be a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.</p>\n<p>\"(g) Whether or not defendant acted under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of another person.</p>\n<p>\"(h) Whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect, or the affects of intoxication.</p>\n<p>\"(i) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.</p>\n<p>\"(j) Whether or not the defendant was an accomplice to the offense and his participation in the commission of the offense was relatively minor.</p>\n<p>\"(k) Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\" Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 190.3 (West 1988).</p>\n<p>The 1988 version of § 190.3 also provided that \"[a]fter having heard and received all of the evidence, ... the trier of fact shall consider, take into account and be guided by the aggravating and mitigating circumstances referred to in this section,\" and \"shall determine whether the penalty shall be death or confinement in state prison for a term of life without the possibility of parole.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The California Legislature also responded to the confusion by amending factor (k) to include \"any sympathetic or other aspect of the defendant's character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not related to the offense for which he is on trial.\" Cal.

A jury returned a verdict of murder in the first degree and then determined he should be sentenced to death. The issue before us concerns a jury instruction in the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p>The trial court, following the statute then in effect, directed the jury, with other instructions and in a context to be discussed in more detail, to consider certain specific factors either as aggravating or mitigating. The trial court further instructed the jury to consider \"[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\" App. 184. Under the then-applicable statutory scheme this general or catchall factor was codified at Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 190.3(k) (West 1988); and it is referred to as \"factor (k).\"</p>\n<p>Belmontes contended, on direct review, in state collateral proceedings, and in the federal habeas proceedings giving rise to this case, that factor (k) and the trial court's other instructions barred the jury from considering his forward-looking mitigation evidencespecifically evidence that he likely would lead a constructive life if incarcerated instead of executed. The alleged limitation, in his view, prevented the jury from considering relevant mitigation evidence, in violation of his Eighth Amendment right to present all mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings.

Respondent killed her by striking her head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar. Respondent had armed himself with the dumbbell bar before entering the victim's home. See <i>Belmontes, supra,</i> at 760-764, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d, at 315-317.</p>\n<p>In the sentencing phase of his trial Belmontes introduced mitigating evidence to show, <i>inter alia,</i> that he would make positive contributions to society in a structured prison environment. Respondent testified that, during a previous term under the California Youth Authority (CYA), he had behaved in a constructive way, working his way to the number two position on a fire crew in the CYA fire camp in which he was incarcerated. App. 44-45, 53. About that time he had embraced Christianity and entered into a Christian sponsorship program. He admitted that initially he participated in this program to spend time away from the camp. Later, after forming a good relationship with the married couple who were his Christian sponsors, he pursued a more religious life and was baptized. Although his religious commitment lapsed upon his release from the CYA, he testified that he would once again turn to religion whenever he could rededicate himself fully to it. <i>Id.,</i> at 46-48, 53-55. Finally, he answered in the affirmative when asked if he was \"prepared to contribute in anyway [he] can to society if [he was] put in prison for the rest of [his] life.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 58.</p>\n<p>Respondent's former CYA chaplain testified at the sentencing hearing that respondent's conversion appeared genuine. The chaplain, describing respondent as \"salvageable,\" expressed hope that respondent would contribute to prison ministries if given a life sentence. <i>Id.,</i> at 79-83. An assistant chaplain similarly testified that, based on past experience, respondent likely would be adept at counseling other prisoners to avoid the mistakes he had made when they leave prison. <i>Id.,</i> at 95-96. And respondent's Christian sponsors testified he was like a son to them and had been a positive influence on their own son. They also indicated he had participated in various activities at their church. <i>Id.,</i> at 99-103, 110-114.</p>\n<p>After respondent presented his mitigating evidence, the parties made closing arguments discussing respondent's mitigating evidence and how the jury should consider it. Respondent was also allowed to provide his own statement. The trial judge included in his instructions the disputed factor (k) language, an instruction that has since been amended, see Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 8.85(k) (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In two earlier cases this Court considered a constitutional challenge to the factor (k) instruction. See <i>Brown v. Payton, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Boyde v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112386\"><a href=\"/opinion/112386/boyde-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990). In <i>Boyde,</i> the Court rejected a claim that factor (k), with its focus on circumstances \"`extenuat[ing] the gravity of the crime,'\" precluded consideration of mitigating evidence unrelated to the crime, such as evidence of the defendant's background and character. <i>Id.,</i> at 377-378, 386, 110 S.Ct. 1190. The \"proper inquiry,\" the Court explained, \"is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Since the defendant in <i>Boyde</i> \"had an opportunity through factor (k) to argue that his background and character `extenuated' or `excused' the seriousness of the crime,\" the Court saw \"no reason to believe that reasonable jurors would resist the view, `long held by society,' that in an appropriate case such evidence would counsel imposition of a sentence less than death.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 382, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (citing <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112325\"><a href=\"/opinion/112325/penry-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 319, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989)). During the sentencing phase in <i>Boyde,</i> moreover, the defense had presented extensive evidence regarding background and character, so construing factor (k) to preclude consideration of that evidence would have required the jurors not only to believe that \"the court's instructions transformed all of this `favorable testimony into a virtual charade,'\" 494 U.S., at 383, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (quoting <i>California v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111797\"><a href=\"/opinion/111797/california-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 542, 107 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987)), but also to disregard another instruction requiring the jury to \"`<i>consider all of the evidence</i> which has been received during any part of the trial of this case,'\" 494 U.S., at 383, 110 S.Ct. 1190.</p>\n<p>In <i>Payton,</i> the Court again evaluated arguments that factor (k) barred consideration of constitutionally relevant evidencethis time, evidence relating to postcrime rehabilitation, rather than precrime background and character. See 544 U.S., at 135-136, 125 S.Ct. 1432. <i>Payton</i> did not come to this Court, as had <i>Boyde,</i> on direct review, but rather by federal habeas petition subject to AEDPA. Relief was available only if \"the state court's adjudication of the claim `resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.'\" <i>Payton, supra,</i> at 141, 125 S.Ct. 1432 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)). Although the prosecutor in <i>Payton</i> had argued to the juryincorrectlythat factor (k) did not permit consideration of postcrime rehabilitation evidence, this Court concluded that the California Supreme Court reasonably applied <i>Boyde</i> in finding no Eighth Amendment violation. 544 U.S., at 142, 146-147, 125 S.Ct. 1432. Accepting the prosecutor's reading would have required \"the surprising conclusion that remorse could never serve to lessen or excuse a crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 142, 125 S.Ct. 1432. Furthermore, countering any misimpression created by the prosecution's argument, the defense in <i>Payton</i> had presented extensive evidence and argument regarding a postcrime religious conversion and other good behavior. The trial court had instructed the jury to consider all evidence admitted \"`during any part of the trial in this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed,'\" and the prosecution itself \"devoted substantial attention to discounting [the postcrime evidence's] importance as compared to the aggravating factors.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 145-146, 125 S.Ct. 1432. Hence, the state court in <i>Payton</i> could reasonably have concluded that, as in <i>Boyde,</i> there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction to preclude consideration of the postcrime mitigation evidence it had heard. 544 U.S., at 147, 125 S.Ct. 1432.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>As the Court directed in <i>Boyde,</i> we inquire \"whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\" 494 U.S., at 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Here, as in <i>Payton,</i> respondent argues that factor (k) prevented the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> jury from giving effect to his forward-looking evidence. And, as in <i>Payton,</i> respondent's case comes to this Court in federal habeas proceedings collaterally attacking the state court's ruling. Unlike in <i>Payton,</i> however, the federal petition in this case was filed before AEDPA's effective date. AEDPA and its deferential standards of review are thus inapplicable. See <i>Woodford v. Garceau,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127903\"><a href=\"/opinion/127903/woodford-v-garceau/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, 210, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 155 L.Ed.2d 363 (2003). The Court of Appeals distinguished <i>Payton</i> on this ground. See 414 F.3d, at 1101-1102. It was mistaken, however, to find a \"reasonable probability\" that the jury did not consider respondent's future potential. <i>Id.,</i> at 1138.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals erred by adopting a narrow and, we conclude, an unrealistic interpretation of factor (k). \"Most naturally read,\" the Court of Appeals reasoned, \"this instruction allows the jury to consider evidence that bears upon the commission of the crime by the defendant and excuses or mitigates his culpability for the offense.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1134. As both <i>Boyde</i> and <i>Payton</i> explain, however, this interpretation is too confined. \"The instruction did not ... limit the jury's consideration to `any other circumstance <i>of the crime</i> which extenuates the gravity of the crime.' The jury was directed to consider <i>any other circumstance</i> that might excuse the crime.\" <i>Boyde, supra,</i> at 382, 110 S.Ct. 1190; see also <i>Payton, supra,</i> at 141-142, 125 S.Ct. 1432. And just as precrime background and character <i>(Boyde)</i> and postcrime rehabilitation <i>(Payton)</i> may \"extenuat[e] the gravity of the crime,\" so may some likelihood of future good conduct count as a circumstance tending to make a defendant less deserving of the death penalty. Cf. <i>Skipper,</i> 476 U.S., at 4-5, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (explaining that while inferences regarding future conduct do not \"relate specifically to [a defendant's] culpability for the crime he committed,\" those inferences are \"`mitigating' in the sense that they might serve `as a basis for a sentence less than death'\" (quoting <i>Lockett v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion))).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals failed to heed the full import of <i>Payton's</i> holding, a holding that has significance even where AEDPA is inapplicable. <i>Payton</i> indicated that reading factor (k) to preclude consideration of postcrime evidence would require \"the surprising conclusion that remorse could never serve to lessen or excuse a crime.\" 544 U.S., at 142, 125 S.Ct. 1432. So, too, would it be counterintuitive if a defendant's capacity to redeem himself through good works could not extenuate his offense and render him less deserving of a death sentence.</p>\n<p>In any event, since respondent sought to extrapolate future behavior from precrime conduct, his mitigation theory was more analogous to the good-character evidence examined in <i>Boyde</i> and held to fall within factor (k)'s purview. See 494 U.S., at 381, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (describing the evidence at issue as including evidence of the defendant's \"strength of character\"). Both types of evidence suggest the crime stemmed more from adverse circumstances than from an irredeemable character. See 414 F.3d, at 1141-1142 (O'Scannlain, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); cf. <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112897\"><a href=\"/opinion/112897/johnson-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993) (noting that the \"forward-looking\" future-dangerousness inquiry \"is not independent of an assessment of personal culpability\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Our interpretation of factor (k) is the one most consistent with the evidence presented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*476</span> to the jury, the parties' closing arguments, and the other instructions provided by the trial court. Each of these will be discussed in turn.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals recognized, future-conduct evidence was central to the mitigation case presented by the defense. See 414 F.3d, at 1134. Indeed, although the defense also adduced evidence of a troubled upbringing, respondent testified that he could not use his difficult life \"as a crutch to say I am in a situation right now, I'm here now because of that.\" App. 40. Given this assertion, and considering the extensive forward-looking evidence presented at sentencingevidence including testimony from two prison chaplains, respondent's church sponsors, and respondent himselfthe jurors could have disregarded respondent's future potential only if they drew the unlikely inference that \"the court's instructions transformed all of this `favorable testimony into a virtual charade,'\" <i>Boyde, supra,</i> at 383, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (quoting <i>Brown,</i> 479 U.S., at 542, 107 S.Ct. 837). It is improbable the jurors believed that the parties were engaging in an exercise in futility when respondent presented (and both counsel later discussed) his mitigating evidence in open court.</p>\n<p>Arguments by the prosecution and the defense assumed the evidence was relevant. The prosecutor initially discussed the various factors that were to guide the jury. He referred to factor (k) as \"a catchall.\" App. 153. He then discussed respondent's religious experience in some detail. With respect to whether this experience fit within factor (k), he indicated: \"I'm not sure it really fits in there. I'm not sure it really fits in any of them. But I think it appears to be a proper subject of consideration.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 154. These seemingly contradictory statements are explained by the prosecutor's following comments.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor suggested (quite understandably on the record) that respondent's religious evidence was weak. He stated: \"You know, first of all, it's no secret that the evidence upon which the defendant's religious experience rests is somewhat shaky.\" <i>Ibid.</i> He also opined that the experience had to be taken \"with a grain of salt.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 155. The jury would have realized that, when the prosecutor suggested respondent's religious experience did not fit within factor (k), he was discussing the persuasiveness of the evidence, not the jury's ability to consider it. After all, he thought religion was \"a proper subject of consideration.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 154.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor then discussed how the jury should weigh respondent's \"religious awakening\":</p>\n<blockquote>\"I suppose you can say it would be appropriate becausein this fashion: The defendant may be of value to the community later. You recall the people talking about how he would have the opportunity to work with other prisoners in prison. And I think that value to the community is something that you have to weigh in. There's something to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"On the other hand, the fact that someone has religion as opposed to someone doesn't should be no grounds for either giving or withholding life. I mean let's turn it around and look at the other side of the coin. Suppose someone said he didn't belong to a church and didn't talk to a minister. Would that man deserve to die merely because of that? So if he says he has religion, does he deserve the other penalty, life? I don't think that that should be an influencing factor at all in that respect. I don't think the law contemplates that and I don't think it's right.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 155.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*477</span> These remarks confirmed to the jury that it should analyze respondent's future potential, his future \"value to the community.\" <i>Ibid.</i> This is what respondent himself wanted it to do. And while the prosecutor commented that the law did not contemplate jury consideration of respondent's religious conversion, respondent did not argue that the jury should consider the mere fact that he had discovered religion. Rather, as manifested by his arguments on appeal, respondent wanted to use this religious evidence to demonstrate his future \"value to the community,\" not to illustrate his past religious awakening. Nothing the prosecutor said would have convinced the jury that it was forbidden from even considering respondent's religious conversion, though surely the jury could discount it; and nothing the prosecutor said would have led the jury to think it could not consider respondent's future potential, especially since he indicated that this is exactly what the jury had \"to weigh\" in its deliberation. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>After the prosecutor concluded his arguments, the trial judge allowed respondent to speak on his own behalf. Respondent, while not showing any remorse, suggested that life imprisonment offered \"an opportunity to achieve goals and try to better yourself.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 163. He also stated: \"I myself would really like to have my life and try to improve myself.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 164. Respondent's personal pleas were consistent with a trial in which the jury would assess his future prospects in determining what sentence to impose.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel's closing arguments confirm this analysis. To be sure, commenting on the mitigating evidence, he initially indicated: \"I'm not going to insult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here. That is not the reason I asked these people to come in.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166. Read in context defense counsel's remarks did not imply the jury should ignore the mitigating evidence. Rather, conforming to the dichotomy within factor (k) itself, his remarks merely distinguished between a legal excuse and an extenuating circumstance. Cf. Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 190.3(k) (\"[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime\").</p>\n<p>That defense counsel did, in fact, want the jury to take into account respondent's future potential became manifest near the end of his argument. He suggested that the \"people who came in here [and] told you about [respondent]\" provided the jury with \"a game plan\" for what respondent could do with his life. App. 170. He continued: \"We're just suggesting the tip of the iceberg because who knows in 20, 30, 40, 50 years what sorts of things he can do, as he fits into the system, as he learns to set his goals, to contribute something in whatever way he can.\" <i>Ibid.</i> This would have left the jury believing it could and should contemplate respondent's potential.</p>\n<p>Other instructions from the trial court make it quite implausible that the jury would deem itself foreclosed from considering respondent's full case in mitigation. Before enumerating specific factors for considerationfactors including the circumstances of the crime, the defendant's age, and \"[t]he presence or absence of any prior felony conviction,\" <i>id.,</i> at 184, as well as the factor (k) catchallthe judge told the jury: \"In determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 183. After listing the factors, he indicated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"After having heard all of the evidence and after having heard and considered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*478</span> the arguments of counsel, you shall consider, take into account and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon which you have been instructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"If you conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall impose a sentence of death. However, if you determine that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances, you shall impose a sentence of confinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 185.</blockquote>\n<p>The judge then gave a supplemental instruction regarding aggravating and mitigating factors:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I have previously read to you the list of aggravating circumstances which the law permits you to consider if you find that any of them is established by the evidence. These are the only aggravating circumstances that you may consider. You are not allowed to take account of any other facts or circumstances as the basis for deciding that the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"However, the mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose a death penalty or a death sentence upon Mr. Belmontes. You should pay careful attention to each of these factors. Any one of them standing alone may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 185-186.</blockquote>\n<p>Given the evidence and arguments presented to the jury, these instructions eliminate any reasonable likelihood that a juror would consider respondent's future prospects to be beyond the bounds of proper consideration. The judge told the jury to consider \"all of the evidence,\" and \"all of the evidence\" included respondent's forward-looking mitigation case. While the judge did end his broad command to appraise all the evidence with the qualifier \"except as you may be hereafter instructed,\" <i>id.,</i> at 183, he did not later instruct the jury that it should disregard respondent's future potential in prison. The jury could not fairly read the limitation in the instruction to apply to respondent's central mitigation theory. By contrast, in response to a juror's question, the trial judge specifically instructed the jury not to consider whether respondent could receive psychiatric treatment while in prison.</p>\n<p>The sharp contrast between the court's instruction on aggravation (that only enumerated factors could be considered) and its instruction on mitigation (that listed factors were \"merely ... examples,\" <i>id.,</i> at 186) made it clear that the jury was to take a broad view of mitigating evidence. Coming back to back, the instructions conveyed the message that the jury should weigh the finite aggravators against the potentially infinite mitigators. That the trial judge told the jury to \"pay careful attention\" to the listed mitigating factors, <i>ibid.,</i> moreover, did not compel the jury to give them sole consideration. For this to be the case, the jury would have had to fail to take the judge at his word. The judge did not advise the jury to pay exclusive attention to the listed mitigating circumstances, and he had told the jury that these circumstances were simply examples.</p>\n<p>It is implausible that the jury supposed that past deeds pointing to a constructive future could not \"extenuat[e] the gravity of the crime,\" as required by factor (k), much less that such evidence could not be considered at all. <i>Boyde</i> concludes that in jury deliberations \"commonsense understanding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*479</span> of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial [is] likely to prevail over technical hair-splitting.\" 494 U.S., at 381, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Here, far from encouraging the jury to ignore the defense's central evidence, the instructions supported giving it due weight.</p>\n<p>In concluding otherwise, the Court of Appeals cited queries from some of the jurors as evidence of confusion. Although the jury's initial question is not in the record, it appeared to ask the judge about the consequences of failing to reach a unanimous verdict. Cf. 414 F.3d, at 1135. In response, the judge reread portions of the instructions and stated that \"all 12 jurors must agree, if you can.\" App. 190. Before the judge sent the jury back for further deliberation, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HERN: The statement about the aggravation and mitigation of the circumstances, now, that was the listing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: That was the listing, yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HERN: Of those certain factors we were to decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: That is right. It is a balancing process. Mr. Meyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR MEYER: A specific question, would this be an either/or situation, not a one, if you cannot the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: No. It is not that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR MEYER: It is an either/or situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: Exactly. If you can make that either/or decision. If you cannot, then I will discharge you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HAILSTONE: Could I ask a question? I don't know if it is permissible. Is it possible that he could have psychiatric treatment during this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: That is something you cannot consider in making your decision.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 191.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court of Appeals decided Juror Hern's questions indicated she thought (incorrectly) that only listed mitigating factors were on the tablean error, in the Court of Appeals' view, that should have prompted a clarifying instruction confirming that all the mitigating evidence was relevant. 414 F.3d, at 1136. The Court of Appeals further supposed the response to Juror Hailstone's question compounded the problem, since psychiatric treatment presumably would be necessary only in aid of future rehabilitation. <i>Id.,</i> at 1137.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals' analysis is flawed. To begin with, attributing to Juror Hern a dilemma over the scope of mitigation is only one way to interpret her questions, and, as the California Supreme Court observed on direct review, it is not necessarily the correct one, see <i>Belmontes,</i> 45 Cal.3d, at 804, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d, at 344. It is at least as likely that the juror was simply asking for clarification about California's overall balancing process, which requires juries to consider and balance enumerated factors (such as age and criminal history) that are labeled neither as mitigating nor as aggravating. As Juror Hern surmised (but sought to clarify), the jury itself must determine the side of the balance on which each listed factor falls. See Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 190.3 (providing that, \"[i]n determining the penalty, the trier of fact shall take into account\" any relevant listed factors); see generally <i>Tuilaepa v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117875\"><a href=\"/opinion/117875/tuilaepa-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 978-979, 114 S.Ct. 2630, 129 L.Ed.2d 750 (1994) (noting that the § 190.3 sentencing factors \"do not instruct the sentencer how to weigh any of the facts it finds in deciding upon the ultimate sentence\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*480</span> Even assuming the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted Juror Hern's questions, the court's conclusion that this juror likely ignored forward-looking evidence presupposes what it purports to establish, namely, that forward-looking evidence could not fall within factor (k). As discussed earlier, nothing barred the jury from viewing respondent's future prospects as \"extenuat[ing] the gravity of the crime,\" so nothing barred it from considering such evidence under the rubric of the \"listing.\" As for Juror Hailstone's psychiatric-care question, this inquiry shows that, if anything, the jurors were considering respondent's potential. The trial court's response, far from implying a broad prohibition on forward-looking inferences, was readily explicable by the absence of any evidence in the record regarding psychiatric care.</p>\n<p>In view of our analysis and disposition in this case it is unnecessary to address an argument for reversing the Court of Appeals based on the Court's holding in <i>Johnson v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112897\"><a href=\"/opinion/112897/johnson-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993), a subject raised by Judge O'Scannlain in his separate opinion in the Court of Appeals. See 414 F.3d, at 1141-1142 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>In this case, as in <i>Boyde</i> and as in <i>Payton,</i> the jury heard mitigating evidence, the trial court directed the jury to consider all the evidence presented, and the parties addressed the mitigating evidence in their closing arguments. This Court's cases establish, as a general rule, that a jury in such circumstances is not reasonably likely to believe itself barred from considering the defense's evidence as a factor \"extenuat[ing] the gravity of the crime.\" The factor (k) instruction is consistent with the constitutional right to present mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I adhere to my view that limiting a jury's discretion to consider all mitigating evidence does not violate the Eighth Amendment.

Even accepting the Court's jurisprudence to the contrary, however, this is arguably an easy case, given our reiteration in <i>Johnson v.

In his opinion announcing the judgment, Chief Justice Burger wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\"There is no perfect procedure for deciding in which cases governmental authority should be used to impose death. But a statute that prevents the sentencer in all capital cases from giving independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant's character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty. When the choice is between life and death, that risk is unacceptable and incompatible with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 605[, 98 S.Ct. 2954] (plurality opinion).</blockquote>\n<p>The respondent here, Fernando Belmontes, was sentenced to death in 1982, a scant four years after <i>Lockett.</i> See <i>People v. Belmontes,</i> 45 Cal.3d 744, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1181055\"><a href=\"/opinion/1181055/people-v-belmontes/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span> (1988). Yet at the time of his sentencing, there remained significant residual confusion as to whether the Constitution obligated States to permit juries to consider evidence that, while not extenuating the defendant's culpability for the crime, might nevertheless call for a sentence less than death. Cf. <i>People v. Easley,</i> 34 Cal.3d 858, 875-880, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2605280\"><a href=\"/opinion/2605280/people-v-easley/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2605280\"><a href=\"/opinion/2605280/people-v-easley/\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 823-827 (1983) (noting arguments on both sides).</p>\n<p>The California death penalty statute in effect in 1982 quite plainly rested on the assumption that California could preclude the consideration of such evidence. The statute commanded that the jury \"shall impose\" a death sentence if aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, and limited the jury's inquiry to 11 discrete categories of evidence. See Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 190.3 (West 1988). Other than factors relating to the defendant's age and prior criminal record, every one of those categories relates to the severity of the crime of which the defendant was convicted.<sup>[1]</sup> And while the eleventh catchall \"factor (k)\" authorized consideration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*482</span> of \"[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime,\" § 190.3(k), factor (k)'s restrictive language sent the unmistakable message that California juries could properly give no mitigating weight to evidence that did not extenuate the severity of the crime.</p>\n<p>Just a year after respondent's sentencing the California Supreme Court evinced considerable discomfort with factor (k). In <i>People v. Easley</i><i>,</i> after discussing the possible unconstitutionality of the penalty phase instructions, the court inserted a critical footnote effectively amending factor (k) and expanding the evidence that a California jury could properly consider in deciding whether to impose a death sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In order to avoid potential misunderstanding in the future, trial courtsin instructing on [factor (k)]should inform the jury that it may consider as a mitigating factor `any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime' and <i>any other `aspect of [the] defendant's character or record ... that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than</i> death.'\" 34 Cal.3d, at 878, n. 10, 196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d, at 826, n. 10 (emphasis added).<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Although <i>Easley</i> came too late to help respondent, the California Supreme Court's evident concern that capital juries must be permitted to consider evidence beyond that which \"extenuates the gravity of the crime\" proved prescient. In <i>Skipper v. South Carolina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111657\"><a href=\"/opinion/111657/skipper-v-south-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986)decided two years before the California Supreme Court affirmed respondent's conviction and therefore fully applicable here, see <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111785\"><a href=\"/opinion/111785/griffith-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 322-323, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987)we expressly rejected the argument, presented in Justice Powell's separate opinion, that the States retained the authority to determine what mitigating evidence is relevant \"as long as they do not foreclose consideration of factors that may tend to reduce the defendant's culpability for his crime,\" see <i>Skipper,</i> 476 U.S., at 11, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (opinion concurring in judgment). Apart from the traditional sentencing factors such as \"[e]vidence concerning the degree of the defendant's participation in the crime, or his age and emotional history,\" Justice Powell would have held that States could properly exclude evidence during a capital sentencing proceeding. <i>Id.,</i> at 13, 106 S.Ct. 1669. The majority, however, took a more expansive view. Although it recognized that the probative force of Skipper's excluded evidence \"would not relate specifically to petitioner's culpability <i>for the crime he committed,</i> [there was] no question but that such inferences would be `mitigating' in the sense that they might serve `as a basis for a sentence less than death.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 4-5, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (quoting <i>Lockett,</i> 438 U.S., at 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (plurality opinion); emphasis added). After <i>Skipper,</i> then, the law was clear: A capital jury must be allowed to consider a broader category of mitigating evidence than normally relevant in noncapital proceedings.</p>\n<p>Respondent was sentenced, however, before <i>Easley</i> rewrote factor (k) and before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*483</span> <i>Skipper</i> resolved the confusion over whether States had the constitutional latitude to restrict evidence that did not \"tend to reduce the defendant's culpability for his crime,\" 476 U.S., at 11, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). As the following review of the record will underscore, that confusion pervaded every aspect of respondent's sentencing hearing. It addled the trial judge, the prosecutor, defense counsel, andinevitablythe jurors themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, after the prosecution put on its casewhich consisted mainly of evidence of respondent's previous conduct, see <i>Belmontes,</i> 45 Cal.3d, at 795, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d, at 338-339respondent countered with testimony from his grandfather and his mother. That testimony focused almost entirely on respondent's background: His father drank to excess and savagely beat his wife; his parents were divorced when he was 9 or 10 years old; his mother remarried, but again divorced when respondent was 14 or 15 years old; at this point respondent became difficult to control, and, in 1979, he was sent to the California Youth Authority (Youth Authority); after his release, respondent did not live with his mother, although he kept in touch with her by telephone and was very close with his 15-year-old sister. See generally App. 5-22.</p>\n<p>Next, the jury heard testimony from Robert Martinez and his wife Darlene, both of whom testified that they were close friends with respondent but admitted that they had seen him only once after he was released from the Youth Authority. <i>Id.,</i> at 26-27, 35. Robert further testified that respondent was the best man at his wedding and that, prior to his wedding, the two of them would spend a lot of time together, working on Martinez's car, drinking beer, and smoking marijuana. <i>Id.,</i> at 25, 28. The focus of Darlene's testimony was that she was a born-again Christian, and that, when respondent visited Darlene and her husband after his release from the Youth Authority, he told her that he was also a born-again Christian. <i>Id.,</i> at 35-36.</p>\n<p>Respondent then testified on his own behalf. When asked about his childhood, respondent answered that he \"can't use it as a crutch to say I am in a situation right now, I'm here now because of that.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 40. He went on to describe his relationships with his father and grandfather and to relate his experience at the Youth Authority. <i>Id.,</i> at 41-5. Respondent testified that, while at the Youth Authority, he became involved in a Christian program and developed a relationship with his sponsors in that program, Beverly and Fred Haro. <i>Id.,</i> at 46-48. Upon his release, however, respondent started having problems and abandoned his religious commitment, something he had not yet regained fully at the time of the sentencing hearing. <i>Id.,</i> at 53-54. Respondent then described his life in prison and stated that, were he given a life sentence, he would attempt to make a positive contribution to society. <i>Id.,</i> at 55-58. On cross-examination, most of the prosecutor's questions focused on the sincerity of respondent's religious commitment. <i>Id.,</i> at 58-65.</p>\n<p>The following day, respondent presented testimony from Reverend Dale Barrett and Don Miller, both ministers who worked at the Youth Authority location where respondent was held. Reverend Barrett described the Youth Authority's M-2 program through which respondent was matched with the Haros. <i>Id.,</i> at 74-76. He then testified about respondent's involvement with the church and the M-2 program, and how his interactions with respondent led him to believe that he was \"salvageable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 76-82. Miller similarly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*484</span> testified about respondent's participation in the program and his belief that respondent would be adept at speaking with other prisoners about accepting religion. <i>Id.,</i> at 92, 95-96; see also <i>id.,</i> at 96 (testifying that respondent would \"[d]efinitely... be used in the prison system for this sort of activity\").</p>\n<p>Finally, the jury heard testimony from respondent's sponsors in the M-2 program, Fred and Beverly Haro. The Haros described meeting respondent and their experiences with him. See generally <i>id.,</i> at 99-104; 110-112. They also testified about how close they had grown to respondent and about respondent's embrace of religion. <i>Id.,</i> at 101-102; 112-113.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, the sentencing testimony supports three conclusions: First, excepting questions concerning the sincerity of respondent's religious convictions, there was no significant dispute about the credibility of the witnesses; second, little if any of the testimony extenuated the severity of respondent's crime; and third, the testimony afforded the jury a principled basis for imposing a sentence other than death.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The prosecutor began his closing argument at the penalty phase by describing \"th[e] listing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances\" and instructing the jury that it must \"weigh one against the other.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 148. While he observed that \"there is a proper place for sympathy and passion,\" <i>ibid.,</i> the prosecutor emphasized that the jury could only consider \"the kind of sympathy the instruction tells you to consider [<i>i.e.,</i> sympathy that] naturally arises or properly arises <i>from the factors in aggravation and mitigation,</i>\" <i>id.,</i> at 149 (emphasis added). He repeated to the jury that its duty was to \"simpl[y] weig[h]\" certain factors that the judge \"will tell you that you may take into account,\" <i>id.,</i> at 150-151, and he went through those listed factors one by one, carefully discussing the evidence that supported each factor, <i>id.,</i> at 151-157.</p>\n<p>When the prosecutor turned to factor (k), he directly addressed the theory \"that the defendant's religious experience is within that catchall that relates to the defendant at the time he committed the crime, extenuates the gravity of the crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 154. The prosecutor expressed doubt that the jury could consider the evidence at all, stating \"I'm not sure it really fits in there. I'm not sure it really fits in any of them. But I think it appears to be a proper subject of consideration.\" <i>Ibid.</i> And again, after discussing the evidence supporting respondent's religious experience, the prosecutor questioned: \"[I]s a religious awakening a basis for determining penalty? That's really the issue, how much does that weigh, or does it weigh on one side or the other.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 155. Ultimately, the prosecutor concluded: \"I suppose you can say it would be appropriate becausein this fashion: The defendant may be of value to the community later .... And I think that value to the community is something that you have to weigh in. There's something to that.\" <i>Ibid.</i> But immediately thereafter, the prosecutor told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote>\"On the other hand, the fact that someone has religion as opposed to someone doesn't should be no grounds for either giving or withholding life .... So if he says he has religion, does he deserve the other penalty, life? I don't think that that should be an influencing factor at all in that respect. <i>I don't think the law contemplates that and I don't think it's right.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, the prosecutor described the circumstances of the crime and asserted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*485</span> that \"[a] dreadful crime requires a dreadful penalty ....\" <i>Id.,</i> at 160.</p>\n<p>Following the prosecutor's closing argument, the trial judge allowed respondent to address the jury directly. Respondent again stated that he could not use his childhood as a crutch to explain his mistakes, and he said that his Christianity, too, could not be used as a crutch. <i>Id.,</i> at 162. Respondent then asked to keep his life, explaining that he understood that he had to pay for the victim's death, but that he wanted the opportunity to try to improve himself in the future. <i>Id.,</i> at 163.</p>\n<p>Respondent's attorney, John Schick, then addressed the jury. He made no effort to persuade the jurors that the mitigating evidence somehow extenuated the severity of the crime. On the contrary, he said \"I'm not going to insult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here. That is not the reason I asked these people to come in.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166. Instead, he argued that respondent might be able to make a positive contribution in a prison environment. He spoke about the way that respondent improved after he met Beverly and Fred Haro and about the way that respondent's religion shaped him, observing that religion plays a \"very, very vital function ... in anybody's life.\" <i>Ibid.</i> But Schick took care to emphasize that religion \"does not excuse\" the murder; rather, the point of that mitigating evidence was to let the jury \"know something about the man.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 167, 166. He admitted that respondent \"cannot make it on the outside,\" <i>id.,</i> at 167, recognized that respondent needed to be punished, and asked that the jury impose life in prison, a punishment \"that has meaning, that has teeth in it ...,\" <i>id.,</i> at 169. Critically, Schick contended that life in prison was an appropriate sentence because respondent could, if given the chance, \"contribute something in whatever way he can.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 170.</p>\n<p>In sum, both counsel agreed that <i>none</i> of the mitigating evidence could detract from the gravity of the crime, and defense counsel even insisted that it would \"insult\" the jury to suggest that the mitigating evidence \"excuses in any way what happened.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>At a conference on jury instructions with the two counsel, the trial judge plainly indicated that he believed that factor (k) circumscribed the mitigating evidence the jury could consider. The judge lifted the principal jury instructions verbatim from 7 of the 11 traditional sentencing factors set forth in the statute, App. 184, but he refused defense counsel's request to give the jury a separate list of potential mitigating factors, <i>id.,</i> at 142-143. Among those requested were two that specifically instructed the jury to consider respondent's ability to perform constructive work in prison and to live in confinement without acts of violence. See Brief for Respondent 5, n. 1. Those instructions would have been entirely properindeed, probably mandatedunder our holding in <i>Skipper.</i> But the prosecutor, not having the benefit of <i>Skipper,</i> argued to the judge that \"none [of the proposed mitigating instructions] here ... relates to circumstances concerning the crime. I can't conceal the fact that I think that is the determinative factor in this case.\" App. 142. Agreeing, the judge refused to include the mitigating instructions, making the astonishing statement that the instructions already \"seem to be a little over-laden with the factors in mitigation rather than in aggravation.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Of particular importance, the judge modified defense counsel's request that the jury be told that the instructions did not contain an exhaustive list of mitigating factors. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*486</span> <i>Id.,</i> at 141. While he did give such an instruction, <i>ante,</i> at 477-478, he refused to include the following requested reference to nonstatutory factors: \"`You may also consider any other circumstances [relating to the case or the defendant, Mr. Belmontes,] as reasons for not imposing the death sentence.'\" Brief for Respondent 25-26; contra, App. 186. The judge thus expressly <i>declined</i> to invite the jury to weigh \"potentially infinite mitigators,\" contrary to the Court's assumption today, see <i>ante,</i> at 478. A more accurate summary of his rulings is that the jury could weigh nonstatutory circumstancesbut only if they extenuated the severity of respondent's offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The next morning, the trial judge gave the jurors their instructions. He opened with the unyielding admonition that \"[y]ou must accept and follow the rules of law as I state them to you,\" App. 175, and explained that he was required to read the instructions aloud even though they would have a written copy available during their deliberations, <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>After reading a set of boilerplate instructions, <i>id.,</i> at 176-183, the judge turned to the subject of \"determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant,\" <i>id.,</i> at 183. He told the jury to \"consider all of the evidence ... <i>except as you may be hereafter instructed,</i>\" <i>ibid.</i> (emphasis added), and then stated: \"You shall consider, take into account and be guided by the following factors, if applicable,\" <i>id.,</i> at 183-184. He then proceeded to repeat verbatim 7 of the 11 factors set forth in the statute. <i>Id.,</i> at 184. Except for the reference to the \"age of the defendant at the time of the crime,\" <i>ibid.,</i> every one of those factors related to the severity of the crime itself. See n. 1, <i>supra.</i> The last of them, the factor (k) instruction, focused the jury's attention on any circumstance that \"extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\" <i>Ibid.</i> No factor permitted the jury to consider \"any other `aspect of [the] defendant's character or record ... that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.'\" <i>Easley,</i> 34 Cal.3d, at 878, n. 10, 196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d, at 826, n. 10 (quoting <i>Lockett,</i> 438 U.S., at 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p>Emphasizing the importance of the listing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the judge next instructed the jury that it \"shall consider, take into account and be guided <i>by the applicable factors</i> of aggravating and mitigating circumstances <i>upon which you have been instructed.</i>\" App. 185 (emphasis added). In other words, in reaching its decision, the jury was to consider each of the \"applicable factors\"here, the seven factors the judge just finished readingand no others.</p>\n<p>As the Court points out, <i>ante,</i> at 478, the judge did tell the jury that \"the mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose ... a death sentence...,\" App. 186. But immediately afterwards, he instructed the jury to \"pay careful attention to each of <i>these factors.</i> Any one of them standing alone may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Since none of \"these factors\" (save for the age of the defendant) encompassed any mitigating circumstance unrelated to the severity of the crime, the most natural reading of the instruction is that any mitigating factor <i>that lessens the severity of the offense</i> may support a sentence other than death. On this view, any other mitigating circumstance is simply irrelevant to (in the prosecutor's words) the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*487</span> \"simple weighing\" the jury was tasked with performing. <i>Id.,</i> at 150.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Questions asked by at least six different jurors during almost two full days of deliberation gave the judge an ample opportunity to clarify that the testimony offered on behalf of respondent, if credited by the jury, provided a permissible basis for imposing a sentence other than death. Far from eliminating their obvious confusion, his responses cemented the impression that the jurors' lone duty was to weigh specified, limited statutory factors against each other.</p>\n<p>After a lunch break, the judge reconvened the jury to answer a question that does not appear in the record; in response, the judge merely reread instructions telling the jury that it \"must agree, if [it] can,\" and that it \"shall consider, take into account and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances <i>upon which you have been instructed.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 185, 188-189 (emphasis added). Because all of those factors were traditional sentencing factors, and because none of them permitted consideration of <i>Skipper</i>-type mitigating evidence, the judge's response was the functional equivalent of yet another admonition to disregard most of respondent's evidence.</p>\n<p>After a colloquy between the judge and four different jurors (Hailstone, Wilson, Norton, and Huckabay) about the likelihood of reaching a unanimous verdict,<sup>[3]</sup> other jurors asked the judge a series of questions reflecting a concern about whether it was proper to consider aggravating or mitigating circumstances other than those specifically listed in his instructions:</p>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HERN: The statement about the aggravation and mitigation of the circumstances, now, that was the listing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: That was the listing, yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HERN: Of those certain factors we were to decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: That is right. It is a balancing process. Mr. Meyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR MEYER: A specific question, would this be an either/or situation, not a one, if you cannot the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: No. It is not that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR MEYER: It is an either/or situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: Exactly. If you can make that either/or decision. If you cannot, then I will discharge you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUROR HAILSTONE: Could I ask a question? I don't know if it is permissible. Is it possible that he could have psychiatric treatment during this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> \"THE COURT: That is something you cannot consider in making your decision.\" App. 191.</blockquote>\n<p>The judge's responses strongly suggest that the \"listing\"the listed statutory factorswas all that the jury could properly consider when \"balanc[ing] the sheet.\" See n. 1, <i>supra.</i> But it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how evidence relating to future conduct even arguably \"extenuate[d] the gravity of the crime\"<sup>[4]</sup> under factor (k), and none of those listed factors gave the jury the chance to consider whether respondent might redeem himself in prison. Cf. <i>Brown v. Payton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142880\"><a href=\"/opinion/142880/brown-v-payton/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 157, 125 S.Ct. 1432, 161 L.Ed.2d 334 (2005) (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\"[I]t would be more than a stretch to say that the seriousness of the crime itself is affected by a defendant's subsequent experience\"). And rather than inviting an open-ended review of mitigating factors that would include consideration of the defendant's possible future behavior in prison, the judge's answers emphasized the constraints on the \"either/or\" decision the jurors had to make.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The arguments of counsel, the actual instructions to the jury, and this colloquy all support the conclusion that the jurors understood their task was to run through the listed statutory factors and weigh them against each other to determine whether respondent should be sentenced to death. Very little of respondent's evidence, however, even arguably \"extenuate[d] the gravity of the crime.\" In my judgment, it is for that reason much more likely than not that the jury believed that the law forbade it from giving that evidence any weight at all. The Court of Appeals therefore correctly set aside respondent's death sentence. See <i>Boyde v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112386\"><a href=\"/opinion/112386/boyde-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990) (plurality opinion) (requiring that a defendant show only that \"there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>Nothing in the Court's opinion in <i>Boyde</i> upsets my view that respondent's death sentence cannot stand. Over the dissent of four Justices, the Court in <i>Boyde</i> both adopted a new \"legal standard for reviewing jury instructions claimed to restrict impermissibly a jury's consideration of relevant evidence,\" <i>id.,</i> at 378, 110 S.Ct. 1190, and approved a blatantly atextual interpretation of the unadorned factor (k) instruction, <i>id.,</i> at 382, and n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Applying its new standard and its dubious reading of factor (k), the Court held that there was \"not a reasonable likelihood that Boyde's jurors interpreted the trial court's instructions to prevent consideration of mitigating evidence of background and character.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 381, 110 S.Ct. 1190.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> The Court rejected Boyde's argument that factor (k) made it impossible for the jury to consider testimony that Boyde had won a prize for dance choreography while in prison, which Boyde argued was <i>Skipper</i>-type evidence relating to whether \"he could lead a useful life behind bars,\" 494 U.S., at 382, n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190. But the Court did not hold or suggest that factor (k) allowed for the consideration of <i>Skipper</i>-type evidence. Instead, the Court found that the evidence of his dance choreography talents was presented as part of his \"overall strategy to portray himself <i>as less culpable</i> than other defendants due to his disadvantaged background and his character strengths,\" 494 U.S., at 382, n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (emphasis added), and therefore fell within the ambit of factor (k). Thus, although the <i>Boyde</i> opinion does not state so explicitly, it assumes that the factor (k) instruction would not permit the jury to consider <i>Skipper</i>-type \"evidence of postcrime good prison behavior to show that [a defendant] would not pose a danger to the prison community if sentenced to life imprisonment rather than death.\" 494 U.S., at 382, n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190; see also <i>Skipper,</i> 476 U.S., at 4, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (recognizing that inferences regarding a defendant's \"probable future conduct if sentenced to life in prison ... would not relate specifically to [the defendant's] culpability for the crime he committed\"); <i>Payton,</i> 544 U.S., at 164, 125 S.Ct. 1432 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\"<i>Boyde</i> did not purport to hold that factor (k) naturally called for consideration of postcrime changes of fundamental views\").</p>\n<p>Here, respondent contends that there is a reasonable likelihood that the judge's instructions prevented the jury from considering precrime, forward-looking mitigation evidence regarding the possibility that he would lead a constructive life in a prison setting. Not only does the Court's opinion in <i>Boyde</i> fail to support the improbable argument that respondent's mitigating evidence falls within factor (k)'s purview, but its reasoning is entirely consistent with the Court of Appeals' contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Court's recent decision in <i>Payton</i> has little bearing here. In <i>Payton,</i> we granted certiorari to decide whether the Ninth Circuit's decision affirming the District Court's grant of habeas relief \"was contrary to the limits on federal habeas review imposed by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\" 544 U.S., at 136, 125 S.Ct. 1432. In concluding that it was, the Court relied heavily on the deferential standard of habeas review established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214. See 544 U.S., at 141, 125 S.Ct. 1432. And Justice BREYER specifically stated that he only joined the five-Justice majority because \"this is a case in which Congress' instruction to defer to the reasonable conclusions of state-court judges makes a critical difference,\" <i>id.,</i> at 148, 125 S.Ct. 1432 (concurring opinion), explaining that, were he a California state judge, he \"would likely hold that Payton's penalty-phase proceedings violated the Eighth Amendment [because] there might well have been a reasonable likelihood that Payton's jury interpreted factor (k) in a way that prevented it from considering constitutionally relevant mitigating evidencenamely, evidence of his postcrime religious conversion,\" <i>ibid.</i> (citation, alteration, and internal quotation marks omitted). The fact that <i>Payton</i> was a case about deference under AEDPA, rather than about a proper understanding of the scope of factor (k), is cause enough to conclude that it does not mandate any specific outcome here.</p>\n<p>Indeed, given that respondent's trial occurred the same year and involved the same jury instructions as Payton's, compare 544 U.S., at 156, 125 S.Ct. 1432 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\"`[Y]ou shall <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial in this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed'\"), with App. 183 (same), and because AEDPA does not apply to respondent's case, there are persuasive reasons for concluding that Justice SOUTER's powerful reasoning in <i>Payton,</i> rather than the majority's deferential review of a California court's opinion, should guide our decision. In his dissenting opinion, Justice SOUTER pointed out that Payton's trial had occurred both before the California Supreme Court had directed trial judges to supplement the factor (k) instruction and before the legislature had amended it. See 544 U.S., at 158, 125 S.Ct. 1432. Without those changes, he correctly concluded, \"any claim that factor (k) called for consideration of a defendant's personal development in the wake of his crime was simply at odds with common attitudes and the English language.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 158-159, 125 S.Ct. 1432.</p>\n<p>Moreover, <i>Payton</i> did not deal with a record that discloses actual confusion among jurors, as this record does. See <i>supra,</i> at 486-488. Nor did it involve a defense attorney who, bolstering the prosecutor's claim that factor (k) did not allow the jury to consider respondent's religious conversion, refused to \"insult\" the jury \"by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here,\" App. 166. Therefore, even ignoring its significantly different procedural posture, <i>Payton,</i> like <i>Boyde,</i> falls far short of compelling the result that the Court reaches today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII</h2>\n<p>Instead of accepting that lay jurors would almost certainly give the words \"circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime\" their ordinary meaning, the Court insists that they would have disregarded their instructions and considered evidence that had nothing whatsoever to do with the crime. This conclusion seems to me to rest on an assumption that the jury had an uncanny ability to predict that future opinions would interpret factor (k) to mean something that neither the judge nor the lawyers thought it meant. Surely the more natural inference is that the jury followed its instructions. See <i>Greer v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111956\"><a href=\"/opinion/111956/greer-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span>, 766, n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987) (describing our \"presumption\" that juries follow instructions).</p>\n<p>The Court's highly technical parsing of factor (k) depends on linguistic distinctions which would only occur to trained lawyers. See, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 477 (calling attention to the \"dichotomy within factor (k) ... between a legal excuse and an extenuating circumstance\"). And even the lawyers are confused. The prosecutor in <i>Payton</i> believed that \"factor (k) d[oes] not permit consideration of postcrime rehabilitation evidence.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 474. While the majority now blithely characterizes this view as \"incorrec[t],\" <i>ibid.,</i> it is the natural reading of factor (k), and one that jurors would have been likely to accept. Similarly, present-day counsel for the State of California expressed confusion at oral argument as to whether it would have been constitutional for the trial judge to instruct the jury that it could not consider any mitigating evidence unless it extenuated the gravity of the crime, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9 (retreating from the statement that \"[i]t would appear not to be\" constitutional). The Court cannot seriously insist that a group of 12 laypersons had such command of constitutional law that, anticipating <i>Skipper,</i> they took into account evidence outside the ambit of their jury instructions.</p>\n<p>The Court also apparently believes that when the prosecutor in this case suggested <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> that factor (k) meant exactly what it said, <i>supra,</i> at 475-476, the jury would have taken that as merely a comment on respondent's credibility, <i>ante,</i> at 476. But this rests on a clear misreading of the record. Although the prosecutor did argue that respondent lacked sincere religious convictions, he <i>also</i> suggested quite powerfully that the law did not permit the jury to consider those convictions, however sincerely held. See App. 155 (\"I don't think the law contemplates that <i>and</i> I don't think it's right\" (emphasis added)). Nor is there any support for the Court's surprising and inherently contradictory view that while the prosecutor here \"commented that the law did not contemplate jury consideration of respondent's religious conversion,\" <i>ante,</i> at 477, \"<i>[n]othing the prosecutor said</i> would have convinced the jury that it was forbidden from even considering respondent's religious conversion,\" <i>ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Admittedly, as the Court points out, there is a distinction between limiting the jury's consideration to \"circumstance[s] <i>of the crime</i>\" that extenuate its severity, and limiting that consideration to \"<i>any other circumstance</i> that might excuse the crime,\" see <i>ante,</i> at 475 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is highly unlikely, however, that jurors would note that subtle distinction, and even more unlikely that they would consider it significant. Both interpretations of the phrase focus the jury's attention on the crime, and neither includes the evidence at issue in <i>Skipper,</i> which \"[a]lmost by definition ... neither excuses the defendant's crime nor reduces his responsibility for its commission.\" 476 U.S., at 12, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). Read however generously, the factor (k) limitation remains unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The Court makes a similarly unpersuasive argument based on the dubious premise that a juror would understand \"remorse\" to be a species of postcrime evidence that serves to lessen or excuse the crime itself. Even if that were true, it would not follow that jurors could somehow divine that respondent's evidence of a capacity to redeem himself would both \"extenuate his offense and render him less deserving of a death sentence.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 475.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VIII</h2>\n<p>Unless the jurors who imposed the death sentence somehow guessed at the breadth of the rule first announced in <i>Lockett,</i> that sentence was the product of an unconstitutional proceeding. Ironically, both Chief Justice Burger (who wrote the plurality opinion in <i>Lockett</i>) and Justice Powell (who joined it) understood the <i>Lockett</i> rule to extend only to evidence \"that lessens the defendant's culpability for the crime.\" <i>Skipper,</i> 476 U.S., at 12, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C.J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). Given that the authors of <i>Lockett</i> themselves disagreed as to its scope, I am not as sanguine as the Court that the lay members of the jury somehow knew, notwithstanding clear jury instructions, that the testimony presented at the sentencing phase of respondent's trial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> could be part of the \"simple weighing\" the jury was supposed to undertake.</p>\n<p>When the trial judge told the jurors to consider all the evidence \"except as you may be hereinafter instructed,\" App. 183, he directed them to limit their consideration to the traditional sentencing factors set forth in the statute. When the prosecutor told the jurors that \"I don't think the law contemplates\" that respondent's religion lessened the seriousness of respondent's offense, <i>id.,</i> at 155, he reinforced the impression that the jury should confine its deliberations to the listing. And once defense counsel <i>agreed</i> with the prosecutor, saying that \"I'm not going to insult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here,\" <i>id.,</i> at 166, surely at least some of the jurors would have doubted the propriety of speculating about respondent's future conduct in prison as a basis for imposing a sentence less than death.</p>\n<p>The Court today heaps speculation on speculation to reach the strange conclusion, out of step with our case law, that a properly instructed jury disregarded its instructions and considered evidence that fell outside the narrow confines of factor (k). Holding to the contrary, the Court insists, would reduce two days of sentencing testimony to \"a virtual charade,\" <i>ante,</i> at 474 (internal quotation marks omitted) but in so concluding the Court necessarily finds that the judge's instructions were themselves such a \"charade\" that the jury paid them no heed. I simply cannot believe that the jurors took it upon themselves to consider testimony they were all but told they were forbidden from considering; in my view, they must at the very least have been confused as to whether the evidence could appropriately be considered. That confusion has created a risk of error sufficient to warrant relief for a man who has spent more than half his life on death row. Cf. <i>Lackey v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1045</span></span>, 115 S.Ct. 1421, 131 L.Ed.2d 304 (1995) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari). The incremental value to California of carrying out a death sentence at this late date is far outweighed by the interest in maintaining confidence in the fairness of any proceeding that results in a State's decision to take the life of one of its citizens.

BELMONTES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 05–493.      Argued October 3, 2006—Decided November 13, 2006\nIn the penalty phase of respondent’s capital murder trial, he introduced\n  mitigating evidence to show, inter alia, that he would lead a con\n  structive life if incarcerated rather than executed, testifying that he\n  had done so during a previous incarceration, when he had embraced\n  Christianity. Two prison chaplains and his Christian sponsors from\n  that time testified on his behalf, and the parties’ closing arguments\n  discussed this mitigating evidence and how the jury should consider\n  it. The trial judge told the jury to consider “[a]ny other circumstance\n  which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a le\n  gal excuse for the crime,” an instruction known as “factor (k)” under\n  California’s then-applicable statutory scheme. Respondent was sen\n  tenced to death. He contended, on direct review and in federal ha\n  beas proceedings, that factor (k) and the trial court’s other instruc\n  tions barred the jury from considering his forward-looking mitigation\n  evidence in violation of his Eighth Amendment right to present all\n  mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings. The Federal\n  District Court denied relief, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. On re\n  consideration in light of Brown v. Payton, 544 U. S. 133, the Ninth\n  Circuit again invalidated respondent’s sentence.\nHeld: The factor (k) instruction is consistent with the constitutional\n right to present mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceed\n ings. Pp. 4–16.\n    (a) This Court has previously found that factor (k) does not pre\n clude consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence, such as\n mitigating evidence about a defendant’s precrime background and\n character, Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 377–378, 386, or post-\n crime rehabilitation, Brown v. Payton, supra, at 135–136, and found\n the proper inquiry to be “whether there is a reasonable likelihood\n2                         AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that\n    prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence,”\n    Boyde, supra, at 380. Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) That inquiry applies here. Like Payton, this case involves for\n    ward-looking evidence and comes to the Court on federal habeas pro\n    ceedings, but unlike Payton, it was filed before the effective date of\n    the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).\n    The Ninth Circuit distinguished Payton on this ground, but erred in\n    finding a “reasonable probability” that the jury did not consider evi\n    dence of respondent’s future potential. 414 F. 3d 1094, 1138. Pp. 6–\n    16.\n         (1) The Circuit adopted a narrow and unrealistic interpretation\n    of factor (k), ruling that “this instruction allows the jury to consider\n    evidence that bears upon the commission of the crime by the defen\n    dant and excuses or mitigates his culpability for the offense,” 414\n    F. 3d 1094, 1134. As Boyde and Payton explain, the jury is directed\n    “to consider any other circumstance that might excuse the crime.”\n    Boyde, supra, at 382. Just as precrime background and character\n    (Boyde) and postcrime rehabilitation (Payton) may “extenuat[e] the\n    gravity of the crime,” so may some likelihood of future good conduct\n    count as a circumstance tending to make a defendant less deserving\n    of the death penalty. The Ninth Circuit failed to heed the full import\n    of Payton’s holding, which is significant even where AEDPA is inap\n    plicable. Moreover, since respondent sought to extrapolate future\n    behavior from precrime conduct, his mitigation theory was more\n    analogous to the good-character evidence Boyde found to fall within\n    factor (k)’s purview. Pp. 6–8.\n         (2) This Court’s interpretation of factor (k) is the one most consis\n    tent with the evidence presented to the jury, the parties’ closing ar\n    guments, and the trial court’s other instructions. It is improbable\n    that the jury believed that the parties were engaged in an exercise in\n    futility when respondent presented extensive forward-looking evi\n    dence in open court. Both prosecution and defense arguments as\n    sumed the evidence was relevant. The prosecutor’s remarks that the\n    evidence was weak and his opinion about the weight it should be\n    given confirmed to the jury that it should analyze respondent’s future\n    potential. Respondent’s personal pleas were consistent with a trial in\n    which the jury would assess his future prospects in determining what\n    sentence to impose. This analysis is confirmed by defense counsel’s\n    closing arguments. The trial court’s other instructions make it quite\n    implausible that the jury would deem itself foreclosed from consider\n    ing respondent’s full case in mitigation. The judge told the jury to\n    consider all of the evidence, which included respondent’s forward-\n    looking mitigation case. The sharp contrast between the aggravation\n                     Cite as: 549 U.

In con\n  cluding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit cited juror queries as evidence of\n  confusion. Assuming that interpretation is correct, the court’s con\n  clusion that a juror likely ignored forward-looking evidence presup\n  poses what it purports to establish, namely, that forward-looking evi\n  dence could not fall within factor (k).

FERNANDO BELMONTES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [November 13, 2006] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Fernando Belmontes, the respondent here, was tried in\n1982 in the Superior Court of the State of California in\nand for the County of San Joaquin. A jury returned a\nverdict of murder in the first degree and then determined\nhe should be sentenced to death. The issue before us\nconcerns a jury instruction in the sentencing phase.\n   The trial court, following the statute then in effect,\ndirected the jury, with other instructions and in a context\nto be discussed in more detail, to consider certain specific\nfactors either as aggravating or mitigating. The trial\ncourt further instructed the jury to consider “[a]ny other\ncircumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime\neven though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.” App.\n184. Under the then-applicable statutory scheme this\ngeneral or catchall factor was codified at Cal. Penal Code\nAnn. §190.3 (k) (West 1988); and it is referred to as “factor\n(k).”\n   Belmontes contended, on direct review, in state collat\neral proceedings, and in the federal habeas proceedings\ngiving rise to this case, that factor (k) and the trial court’s\n2                   AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nother instructions barred the jury from considering his\nforward-looking mitigation evidence—specifically evidence\nthat he likely would lead a constructive life if incarcerated\ninstead of executed. The alleged limitation, in his view,\nprevented the jury from considering relevant mitigation\nevidence, in violation of his Eighth Amendment right to\npresent all mitigating evidence in capital sentencing\nproceedings. See, e.g., Penry v. Johnson, 532 U. S. 782, 797\n(2001); Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4–5, 8 (1986);\nEddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 112 (1982). The Cali\nfornia Supreme Court, affirming the judgment and sen\ntence, rejected this contention and other challenges.\nPeople v. Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d 744, 799–802, 819, 755 P. 2d\n310, 341–343, 355 (1988).\n   In February 1994, after exhausting state remedies,\nrespondent filed an amended federal habeas petition. The\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of\nCalifornia denied relief, App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a–141a,\n145a, but a divided panel of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part,\nBelmontes v. Woodford, 350 F. 3d 861, 908 (2003). Over\nthe dissent of eight judges, the Court of Appeals denied\nrehearing en banc. Belmontes v. Woodford, 359 F. 3d 1079\n(2004). This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judg\nment, and remanded for further consideration in light of\nBrown v. Payton, 544 U. S. 133 (2005). Brown v. Belmon\ntes, 544 U. S. 945 (2005). On remand, a divided panel\nagain invalidated respondent’s sentence; it distinguished\nPayton on the grounds that the Antiterrorism and Effec\ntive Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214,\nthough applicable in that case, does not apply here. Bel-\nmontes v. Brown, 414 F. 3d 1094, 1101–1102 (2005). Over\nyet another dissent, the Court of Appeals again denied\nrehearing en banc. Belmontes v. Stokes, 427 F. 3d 663\n(2005). We granted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and\nnow reverse.\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                 I\n  The evidence at trial showed that in March 1981, while\nburglarizing a home where two accomplices had attended\na party, respondent unexpectedly encountered 19-year-old\nSteacy McConnell. Respondent killed her by striking her\nhead 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar. Respon\ndent had armed himself with the dumbbell bar before\nentering the victim’s home. See Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at\n760–764, 755 P. 2d, at 315–317.\n  In the sentencing phase of his trial Belmontes intro\nduced mitigating evidence to show, inter alia, that he\nwould make positive contributions to society in a struc\ntured prison environment. Respondent testified that,\nduring a previous term under the California Youth Au\nthority (CYA), he had behaved in a constructive way,\nworking his way to the number two position on a fire crew\nin the CYA fire camp in which he was incarcerated. App.\n44–45, 53. About that time he had embraced Christianity\nand entered into a Christian sponsorship program. He\nadmitted that initially he participated in this program to\nspend time away from the camp. Later, after forming a\ngood relationship with the married couple who were his\nChristian sponsors, he pursued a more religious life and\nwas baptized. Although his religious commitment lapsed\nupon his release from the CYA, he testified that he would\nonce again turn to religion whenever he could rededicate\nhimself fully to it. Id., at 46–48, 53–55. Finally, he an\nswered in the affirmative when asked if he was “prepared\nto contribute in anyway [he] can to society if [he was] put\nin prison for the rest of [his] life.” Id., at 58.\n  Respondent’s former CYA chaplain testified at the\nsentencing hearing that respondent’s conversion appeared\ngenuine. The chaplain, describing respondent as “sal\nvageable,” expressed hope that respondent would contrib\nute to prison ministries if given a life sentence. Id., at 79–\n83. An assistant chaplain similarly testified that, based\n4                   AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\non past experience, respondent likely would be adept at\ncounseling other prisoners to avoid the mistakes he had\nmade when they leave prison. Id., at 95–96. And respon\ndent’s Christian sponsors testified he was like a son to\nthem and had been a positive influence on their own son.\nThey also indicated he had participated in various activi\nties at their church. Id., at 99–103, 110–114.\n   After respondent presented his mitigating evidence, the\nparties made closing arguments discussing respondent’s\nmitigating evidence and how the jury should consider it.\nRespondent was also allowed to provide his own state\nment. The trial judge included in his instructions the\ndisputed factor (k) language, an instruction that has since\nbeen amended, see Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 8.85(k)\n(2005).\n                                II\n   In two earlier cases this Court considered a constitu\ntional challenge to the factor (k) instruction. See Brown v.\nPayton, supra; Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990).\nIn Boyde, the Court rejected a claim that factor (k), with its\nfocus on circumstances “‘extenuat[ing] the gravity of the\ncrime,’ ” precluded consideration of mitigating evidence\nunrelated to the crime, such as evidence of the defendant’s\nbackground and character. Id., at 377–378, 386. The\n“proper inquiry,” the Court explained, “is whether there is a\nreasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the chal\nlenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration\nof constitutionally relevant evidence.” Id., at 380. Since the\ndefendant in Boyde “had an opportunity through factor (k)\nto argue that his background and character ‘extenuated’ or\n‘excused’ the seriousness of the crime,” the Court saw “no\nreason to believe that reasonable jurors would resist the\nview, ‘long held by society,’ that in an appropriate case such\nevidence would counsel imposition of a sentence less than\ndeath.” Id., at 382 (citing Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302,\n                   Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)              5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n319 (1989)). During the sentencing phase in Boyde, more\nover, the defense had presented extensive evidence regard\ning background and character, so construing factor (k) to\npreclude consideration of that evidence would have required\nthe jurors not only to believe that “the court’s instructions\ntransformed all of this ‘favorable testimony into a virtual\ncharade,’ ” 494 U. S., at 383 (quoting California v. Brown,\n479 U. S. 538, 542 (1987)), but also to disregard another\ninstruction requiring the jury to “ ‘consider all of the evidence\nwhich has been received during any part of the trial of this\ncase,’ ” 494 U. S., at 383.\n   In Payton, the Court again evaluated arguments that\nfactor (k) barred consideration of constitutionally relevant\nevidence—this time, evidence relating to postcrime reha\nbilitation, rather than precrime background and charac\nter. See 544 U. S., at 135–136. Payton did not come to\nthis Court, as had Boyde, on direct review, but rather by\nfederal habeas petition subject to AEDPA. Relief was\navailable only if “the state court’s adjudication of the claim\n‘resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.’ ” Payton, supra, at 141 (quoting 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1)). Although the prosecutor in Payton had\nargued to the jury—incorrectly—that factor (k) did not\npermit consideration of postcrime rehabilitation evidence,\nthis Court concluded that the California Supreme Court\nreasonably applied Boyde in finding no Eighth Amend\nment violation. 544 U. S., at 142, 146–147. Accepting the\nprosecutor’s reading would have required “the surprising\nconclusion that remorse could never serve to lessen or\nexcuse a crime.” Id., at 142. Furthermore, countering any\nmisimpression created by the prosecution’s argument, the\ndefense in Payton had presented extensive evidence and\nargument regarding a postcrime religious conversion and\nother good behavior. The trial court had instructed the\n6                   AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njury to consider all evidence admitted “ ‘during any part of\nthe trial in this case, except as you may be hereafter in\nstructed,’ ” and the prosecution itself “devoted substantial\nattention to discounting [the postcrime evidence’s] impor\ntance as compared to the aggravating factors.” Id., at\n145–146. Hence, the state court in Payton could reasona\nbly have concluded that, as in Boyde, there was no reason\nable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction to\npreclude consideration of the postcrime mitigation evi\ndence it had heard. 544 U. S., at 147.\n                              III\n   As the Court directed in Boyde, we inquire “whether\nthere is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the\nchallenged instruction in a way that prevents the considera\ntion of constitutionally relevant evidence.” 494 U. S., at\n380. Here, as in Payton, respondent argues that factor (k)\nprevented the jury from giving effect to his forward-\nlooking evidence. And, as in Payton, respondent’s case\ncomes to this Court in federal habeas proceedings collater\nally attacking the state court’s ruling. Unlike in Payton,\nhowever, the federal petition in this case was filed before\nAEDPA’s effective date. AEDPA and its deferential stan\ndards of review are thus inapplicable. See Woodford v.\nGarceau, 538 U. S. 202, 210 (2003). The Court of Appeals\ndistinguished Payton on this ground. See 414 F. 3d, at\n1101–1102. It was mistaken, however, to find a “reason\nable probability” that the jury did not consider respon\ndent’s future potential. Id., at 1138.\n                             A\n  The Court of Appeals erred by adopting a narrow and,\nwe conclude, an unrealistic interpretation of factor (k).\n“Most naturally read,” the Court of Appeals reasoned,\n“this instruction allows the jury to consider evidence that\nbears upon the commission of the crime by the defendant\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand excuses or mitigates his culpability for the offense.”\nId., at 1134. As both Boyde and Payton explain, however,\nthis interpretation is too confined. “The instruction did\nnot . . . limit the jury’s consideration to ‘any other circum\nstance of the crime which extenuates the gravity of the\ncrime.’ The jury was directed to consider any other cir\ncumstance that might excuse the crime.” Boyde, supra, at\n382; see also Payton, supra, at 141–142. And just as pre-\ncrime background and character (Boyde) and postcrime\nrehabilitation (Payton) may “extenuat[e] the gravity of the\ncrime,” so may some likelihood of future good conduct\ncount as a circumstance tending to make a defendant less\ndeserving of the death penalty. Cf. Skipper, 476 U. S., at\n4–5 (explaining that while inferences regarding future\nconduct do not “relate specifically to [a defendant’s] culpa\nbility for the crime he committed,” those inferences are\n“ ‘mitigating’ in the sense that they might serve ‘as a basis\nfor a sentence less than death’ ” (quoting Lockett v. Ohio,\n438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978) (plurality opinion))).\n   The Court of Appeals failed to heed the full import of\nPayton’s holding, a holding that has significance even\nwhere AEDPA is inapplicable. Payton indicated that\nreading factor (k) to preclude consideration of postcrime\nevidence would require “the surprising conclusion that\nremorse could never serve to lessen or excuse a crime.”\n544 U. S., at 142. So, too, would it be counterintuitive if a\ndefendant’s capacity to redeem himself through good\nworks could not extenuate his offense and render him less\ndeserving of a death sentence.\n   In any event, since respondent sought to extrapolate\nfuture behavior from precrime conduct, his mitigation\ntheory was more analogous to the good-character evidence\nexamined in Boyde and held to fall within factor (k)’s\npurview. See 494 U. S., at 381 (describing the evidence at\nissue as including evidence of the defendant’s “strength of\ncharacter”). Both types of evidence suggest the crime\n8                  AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstemmed more from adverse circumstances than from an\nirredeemable character. See 414 F. 3d, at 1141–1142\n(O’Scannlain, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart); cf. Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 369 (1993) (not\ning that the “forward-looking” future-dangerousness in\nquiry “is not independent of an assessment of personal\nculpability”).\n                              B\n  Our interpretation of factor (k) is the one most consis\ntent with the evidence presented to the jury, the parties’\nclosing arguments, and the other instructions provided by\nthe trial court. Each of these will be discussed in turn.\n  As the Court of Appeals recognized, future-conduct\nevidence was central to the mitigation case presented by\nthe defense. See 414 F. 3d, at 1134. Indeed, although the\ndefense also adduced evidence of a troubled upbringing,\nrespondent testified that he could not use his difficult life\n“as a crutch to say I am in a situation right now, I’m here\nnow because of that.” App. 40. Given this assertion, and\nconsidering the extensive forward-looking evidence pre\nsented at sentencing—evidence including testimony from\ntwo prison chaplains, respondent’s church sponsors, and\nrespondent himself—the jurors could have disregarded\nrespondent’s future potential only if they drew the\nunlikely inference that “the court’s instructions trans\nformed all of this ‘favorable testimony into a virtual cha\nrade,’ ” Boyde, supra, at 383 (quoting Brown, 479 U. S., at\n542). It is improbable the jurors believed that the parties\nwere engaging in an exercise in futility when respondent\npresented (and both counsel later discussed) his mitigat\ning evidence in open court.\n  Arguments by the prosecution and the defense assumed\nthe evidence was relevant. The prosecutor initially dis\ncussed the various factors that were to guide the jury. He\nreferred to factor (k) as “a catchall.” App. 153. He then\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscussed respondent’s religious experience in some detail.\nWith respect to whether this experience fit within factor\n(k), he indicated: “I’m not sure it really fits in there. I’m\nnot sure it really fits in any of them. But I think it ap\npears to be a proper subject of consideration.” Id., at 154.\nThese seemingly contradictory statements are explained\nby the prosecutor’s following comments.\n   The prosecutor suggested (quite understandably on the\nrecord) that respondent’s religious evidence was weak. He\nstated: “You know, first of all, it’s no secret that the evi\ndence upon which the defendant’s religious experience\nrests is somewhat shaky.” Ibid. He also opined that the\nexperience had to be taken “with a grain of salt.” Id., at\n155. The jury would have realized that, when the prosecu\ntor suggested respondent’s religious experience did not fit\nwithin factor (k), he was discussing the persuasiveness of\nthe evidence, not the jury’s ability to consider it. After all,\nhe thought religion was “a proper subject of considera\ntion.” Id., at 154.\n   The prosecutor then discussed how the jury should\nweigh respondent’s “religious awakening”:\n    “I suppose you can say it would be appropriate be\n    cause—in this fashion: The defendant may be of value\n    to the community later. You recall the people talking\n    about how he would have the opportunity to work\n    with other prisoners in prison. And I think that value\n    to the community is something that you have to weigh\n    in. There’s something to that.\n      “On the other hand, the fact that someone has relig\n    ion as opposed to someone doesn’t should be no\n    grounds for either giving or withholding life. I mean\n    let’s turn it around and look at the other side of the\n    coin. Suppose someone said he didn’t belong to a\n    church and didn’t talk to a minister. Would that man\n    deserve to die merely because of that? So if he says he\n10                  AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     has religion, does he deserve the other penalty, life? I\n     don’t think that that should be an influencing factor\n     at all in that respect. I don’t think the law contem\n     plates that and I don’t think it’s right.” Id., at 155.\n   These remarks confirmed to the jury that it should\nanalyze respondent’s future potential, his future “value to\nthe community.” Ibid. This is what respondent himself\nwanted it to do. And while the prosecutor commented that\nthe law did not contemplate jury consideration of respon\ndent’s religious conversion, respondent did not argue that\nthe jury should consider the mere fact that he had discov\nered religion. Rather, as manifested by his arguments on\nappeal, respondent wanted to use this religious evidence\nto demonstrate his future “value to the community,” not to\nillustrate his past religious awakening. Nothing the\nprosecutor said would have convinced the jury that it was\nforbidden from even considering respondent’s religious\nconversion, though surely the jury could discount it; and\nnothing the prosecutor said would have led the jury to\nthink it could not consider respondent’s future potential,\nespecially since he indicated that this is exactly what the\njury had “to weigh” in its deliberation. Ibid.\n   After the prosecutor concluded his arguments, the trial\njudge allowed respondent to speak on his own behalf.\nRespondent, while not showing any remorse, suggested\nthat life imprisonment offered “an opportunity to achieve\ngoals and try to better yourself.” Id., at 163. He also\nstated: “I myself would really like to have my life and try\nto improve myself.” Id., at 164. Respondent’s personal\npleas were consistent with a trial in which the jury would\nassess his future prospects in determining what sentence\nto impose.\n   Defense counsel’s closing arguments confirm this analy\nsis. To be sure, commenting on the mitigating evidence,\nhe initially indicated: “I’m not going to insult you by tell\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any\nway what happened here. That is not the reason I asked\nthese people to come in.” Id., at 166. Read in context\ndefense counsel’s remarks did not imply the jury should\nignore the mitigating evidence. Rather, conforming to the\ndichotomy within factor (k) itself, his remarks merely\ndistinguished between a legal excuse and an extenuating\ncircumstance. Cf. Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3(k) (“[a]ny\nother circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the\ncrime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime”).\n   That defense counsel did, in fact, want the jury to take\ninto account respondent’s future potential became mani\nfest near the end of his argument. He suggested that the\n“people who came in here [and] told you about [respon\ndent]” provided the jury with “a game plan” for what\nrespondent could do with his life. App. 170. He continued:\n“We’re just suggesting the tip of the iceberg because who\nknows in 20, 30, 40, 50 years what sorts of things he can\ndo, as he fits into the system, as he learns to set his goals,\nto contribute something in whatever way he can.” Ibid.\nThis would have left the jury believing it could and should\ncontemplate respondent’s potential.\n   Other instructions from the trial court make it quite\nimplausible that the jury would deem itself foreclosed\nfrom considering respondent’s full case in mitigation.\nBefore enumerating specific factors for consideration—\nfactors including the circumstances of the crime, the de\nfendant’s age, and “[t]he presence or absence of any prior\nfelony conviction,” id., at 184, as well as the factor (k)\ncatchall—the judge told the jury: “In determining which\npenalty is to be imposed on the defendant you shall con\nsider all of the evidence which has been received during\nany part of the trial of this case, except as you may be\nhereafter instructed.” Id., at 183. After listing the factors,\nhe indicated:\n12                  AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n       “After having heard all of the evidence and after\n     having heard and considered the arguments of coun\n     sel, you shall consider, take into account and be\n     guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and\n     mitigating circumstances upon which you have been\n     instructed.\n       “If you conclude that the aggravating circumstances\n     outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall im\n     pose a sentence of death. However, if you determine\n     that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the ag\n     gravating circumstances, you shall impose a sentence\n     of confinement in the state prison for life without the\n     possibility of parole.” Id., at 185.\n  The judge then gave a supplemental instruction regard\ning aggravating and mitigating factors:\n       “I have previously read to you the list of aggravat\n     ing circumstances which the law permits you to con\n     sider if you find that any of them is established by the\n     evidence. These are the only aggravating circum\n     stances that you may consider. You are not allowed to\n     take account of any other facts or circumstances as\n     the basis for deciding that the death penalty would be\n     an appropriate punishment in this case.\n       “However, the mitigating circumstances which I\n     have read for your consideration are given to you\n     merely as examples of some of the factors that you\n     may take into account as reasons for deciding not to\n     impose a death penalty or a death sentence upon Mr.\n     Belmontes. You should pay careful attention to each\n     of these factors. Any one of them standing alone may\n     support a decision that death is not the appropriate\n     punishment in this case.” Id., at 185–186.\n  Given the evidence and arguments presented to the\njury, these instructions eliminate any reasonable likeli\nhood that a juror would consider respondent’s future\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprospects to be beyond the bounds of proper consideration.\nThe judge told the jury to consider “all of the evidence,”\nand “all of the evidence” included respondent’s forward-\nlooking mitigation case. While the judge did end his broad\ncommand to appraise all the evidence with the qualifier\n“except as you may be hereafter instructed,” id., at 183, he\ndid not later instruct the jury that it should disregard\nrespondent’s future potential in prison. The jury could not\nfairly read the limitation in the instruction to apply to\nrespondent’s central mitigation theory. By contrast, in\nresponse to a juror’s question, the trial judge specifically\ninstructed the jury not to consider whether respondent\ncould receive psychiatric treatment while in prison.\n   The sharp contrast between the court’s instruction on\naggravation (that only enumerated factors could be con\nsidered) and its instruction on mitigation (that listed\nfactors were “merely . . . examples,” id., at 186) made it\nclear that the jury was to take a broad view of mitigating\nevidence. Coming back to back, the instructions conveyed\nthe message that the jury should weigh the finite aggrava\ntors against the potentially infinite mitigators. That the\ntrial judge told the jury to “pay careful attention” to the\nlisted mitigating factors, ibid., moreover, did not compel\nthe jury to give them sole consideration. For this to be the\ncase, the jury would have had to fail to take the judge at\nhis word. The judge did not advise the jury to pay exclu\nsive attention to the listed mitigating circumstances, and\nhe had told the jury that these circumstances were simply\nexamples.\n   It is implausible that the jury supposed that past deeds\npointing to a constructive future could not “extenuat[e] the\ngravity of the crime,” as required by factor (k), much less\nthat such evidence could not be considered at all. Boyde\nconcludes that in jury deliberations “commonsense under\nstanding of the instructions in the light of all that has\ntaken place at the trial [is] likely to prevail over technical\n14                  AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhairsplitting.” 494 U. S., at 381. Here, far from encourag\ning the jury to ignore the defense’s central evidence, the\ninstructions supported giving it due weight.\n  In concluding otherwise, the Court of Appeals cited\nqueries from some of the jurors as evidence of confusion.\nAlthough the jury’s initial question is not in the record, it\nappeared to ask the judge about the consequences of fail\ning to reach a unanimous verdict. Cf. 414 F. 3d, at 1135.\nIn response, the judge reread portions of the instructions\nand stated that “all 12 jurors must agree, if you can.” App.\n190. Before the judge sent the jury back for further delib\neration, the following exchange took place:\n        “JUROR HERN: The statement about the aggrava\n     tion and mitigation of the circumstances, now, that\n     was the listing?\n        “THE COURT: That was the listing, yes, ma’am.\n        “JUROR HERN: Of those certain factors we were to\n     decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?\n        “THE COURT: That is right. It is a balancing proc\n     ess.

S. ____ (2006)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nindicated she thought (incorrectly) that only listed miti\ngating factors were on the table—an error, in the Court of\nAppeals’ view, that should have prompted a clarifying\ninstruction confirming that all the mitigating evidence\nwas relevant. 414 F. 3d, at 1136. The Court of Appeals\nfurther supposed the response to Juror Hailstone’s ques\ntion compounded the problem, since psychiatric treatment\npresumably would be necessary only in aid of future reha\nbilitation. Id., at 1137.\n   The Court of Appeals’ analysis is flawed. To begin with,\nattributing to Juror Hern a dilemma over the scope of\nmitigation is only one way to interpret her questions, and,\nas the California Supreme Court observed on direct re\nview, it is not necessarily the correct one, see Belmontes,\n45 Cal. 3d, at 804, 755 P. 2d, at 344. It is at least as likely\nthat the juror was simply asking for clarification about\nCalifornia’s overall balancing process, which requires\njuries to consider and balance enumerated factors (such as\nage and criminal history) that are labeled neither as miti\ngating nor as aggravating. As Juror Hern surmised (but\nsought to clarify), the jury itself must determine the side\nof the balance on which each listed factor falls. See Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. §190.3 (providing that, “[i]n determining\nthe penalty, the trier of fact shall take into account” any\nrelevant listed factors); see generally Tuilaepa v. Califor\nnia, 512 U. S. 967, 978–979 (1994) (noting that the §190.3\nsentencing factors “do not instruct the sentencer how to\nweigh any of the facts it finds in deciding upon the ulti\nmate sentence”).\n   Even assuming the Court of Appeals correctly inter\npreted Juror Hern’s questions, the court’s conclusion that\nthis juror likely ignored forward-looking evidence presup\nposes what it purports to establish, namely, that forward-\nlooking evidence could not fall within factor (k). As dis\ncussed earlier, nothing barred the jury from viewing re\nspondent’s future prospects as “extenuat[ing] the gravity\n16                 AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof the crime,” so nothing barred it from considering such\nevidence under the rubric of the “listing.” As for Juror\nHailstone’s psychiatric-care question, this inquiry shows\nthat, if anything, the jurors were considering respondent’s\npotential. The trial court’s response, far from implying a\nbroad prohibition on forward-looking inferences, was\nreadily explicable by the absence of any evidence in the\nrecord regarding psychiatric care.\n  In view of our analysis and disposition in this case it is\nunnecessary to address an argument for reversing the\nCourt of Appeals based on the Court’s holding in Johnson\nv. Texas, 509 U. S. 350 (1993), a subject raised by Judge\nO’Scannlain in his separate opinion in the Court of Ap\npeals. See 414 F. 3d, at 1141–42 (opinion concurring in\npart and dissenting in part).\n                            IV\n  In this case, as in Boyde and as in Payton, the jury\nheard mitigating evidence, the trial court directed the jury\nto consider all the evidence presented, and the parties\naddressed the mitigating evidence in their closing argu\nments. This Court’s cases establish, as a general rule,\nthat a jury in such circumstances is not reasonably likely\nto believe itself barred from considering the defense’s\nevidence as a factor “extenuat[ing] the gravity of the\ncrime.” The factor (k) instruction is consistent with the\nconstitutional right to present mitigating evidence in\ncapital sentencing proceedings.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 549 U.

Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), the Court set\naside Ohio’s death penalty statute as unconstitutional\nbecause it unduly restricted the mitigating evidence that a\njury could consider in deciding whether to impose the\ndeath penalty. In his opinion announcing the judgment,\nChief Justice Burger wrote:\n      “There is no perfect procedure for deciding in which\n    cases governmental authority should be used to im\n    pose death. But a statute that prevents the sentencer\n    in all capital cases from giving independent mitigat\n    ing weight to aspects of the defendant’s character and\n    record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in\n    mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will\n    be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less\n    severe penalty. When the choice is between life and\n    death, that risk is unacceptable and incompatible\n    with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth\n    Amendments.” Id., at 605 (plurality opinion).\n  The respondent here, Fernando Belmontes, was sen\ntenced to death in 1982, a scant four years after Lockett.\nSee People v. Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d 744, 755 P. 2d 310\n(1988). Yet at the time of his sentencing, there remained\n2                      AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nsignificant residual confusion as to whether the Constitu\ntion obligated States to permit juries to consider evidence\nthat, while not extenuating the defendant’s culpability for\nthe crime, might nevertheless call for a sentence less than\ndeath. Cf. People v. Easley, 34 Cal. 3d 858, 875–880, 671\nP. 2d 813, 823–827 (1983) (noting arguments on both\nsides).\n   The California death penalty statute in effect in 1982\nquite plainly rested on the assumption that California\ncould preclude the consideration of such evidence. The\nstatute commanded that the jury “shall impose” a death\nsentence if aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigat\ning circumstances, and limited the jury’s inquiry to 11\ndiscrete categories of evidence. See Cal. Penal Code\n§190.3 (West 1988). Other than factors relating to the\ndefendant’s age and prior criminal record, every one of\nthose categories relate to the severity of the crime of which\nthe defendant was convicted.1 And while the eleventh\n——————\n    1 Thosecategories are: “(a) The circumstances of the crime of which\nthe defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the exis\ntence of any special circumstances found to be true . . . .\n  “(b) The presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant\nwhich involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the\nexpress or implied threat to use force or violence.\n  “(c) The presence or absence of any prior felony conviction.\n  “(d) Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant\nwas under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.\n  “(e) Whether or not the victim was a participant in the defendant’s\nhomicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act.\n  “(f) Whether or not the offense was committed under circumstances\nwhich the defendant reasonably believed to be a moral justification or\nextenuation for his conduct.\n  “(g) Whether or not defendant acted under extreme duress or under\nthe substantial domination of another person.\n  “(h) Whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the\ndefendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his\nconduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental\ndisease or defect, or the affects of intoxication.\n  “(i) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.\n                      Cite as: 549 U.

In People v. Easley, after discussing the possi\nble unconstitutionality of the penalty phase instructions,\nthe court inserted a critical footnote effectively amending\nfactor (k) and expanding the evidence that a California\njury could properly consider in deciding whether to impose\na death sentence:\n     “In order to avoid potential misunderstanding in the\n     future, trial courts—in instructing on [factor (k)]—\n     should inform the jury that it may consider as a miti\n     gating factor ‘any other circumstance which extenu\n     ates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a\n     legal excuse for the crime’ and any other ‘aspect of\n     [the] defendant’s character or record . . . that the de\n     fendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than\n     death.’ ” 34 Cal. 3d, at 878, n. 10, 671 P. 2d, at 826, n.\n\n——————\n  “(j) Whether or not the defendant was an accomplice to the offense\nand his participation in the commission of the offense was relatively\nminor.\n  “(k) Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the\ncrime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.” Cal. Penal\nCode Ann. §190.3 (West 1988).\n  The 1988 version of §190.3 also provided that “[a]fter having heard\nand received all of the evidence, . . . the trier of fact shall consider, take\ninto account and be guided by the aggravating and mitigating circum\nstances referred to in this section,” and “shall determine whether the\npenalty shall be death or confinement in state prison for a term of life\nwithout the possibility of parole.”\n4                      AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n       10 (emphasis added).2\n  Although Easley came too late to help respondent, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s evident concern that capital\njuries must be permitted to consider evidence beyond that\nwhich “extenuates the gravity of the crime” proved pre\nscient. In Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986)—\ndecided two years before the California Supreme Court\naffirmed respondent’s conviction and therefore fully appli\ncable here, see Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322–\n323 (1987)—we expressly rejected the argument, pre\nsented in Justice Powell’s separate opinion, that the\nStates retained the authority to determine what mitigat\ning evidence is relevant “as long as they do not foreclose\nconsideration of factors that may tend to reduce the de\nfendant’s culpability for his crime,” see Skipper, 476 U. S.,\nat 11 (opinion concurring in judgment). Apart from the\ntraditional sentencing factors such as “[e]vidence concern\ning the degree of the defendant’s participation in the\ncrime, or his age and emotional history,” Justice Powell\nwould have held that States could properly exclude evi\ndence during a capital sentencing proceeding. Id., at 13.\nThe majority, however, took a more expansive view.\nAlthough it recognized that the probative force of Skip\nper’s excluded evidence “would not relate specifically to\npetitioner’s culpability for the crime he committed, [there\nwas] no question but that such inferences would be ‘miti\ngating’ in the sense that they might serve ‘as a basis for a\nsentence less than death.’ ” Id., at 4–5 (quoting Lockett,\n——————\n    2 The\n        California Legislature also responded to the confusion by\namending factor (k) to include “any sympathetic or other aspect of the\ndefendant’s character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for\na sentence less than death, whether or not related to the offense for\nwhich he is on trial.” Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 8.85(k) (2005) (brack\nets omitted). That amendment confirms the view that the category of\nevidence that may provide the basis for a sentence other than death is\nmuch broader that the category described in factor (k).\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n438 U. S., at 604; emphasis added). After Skipper, then,\nthe law was clear: A capital jury must be allowed to con\nsider a broader category of mitigating evidence than nor\nmally relevant in noncapital proceedings.\n   Respondent was sentenced, however, before Easley\nrewrote factor (k) and before Skipper resolved the confu\nsion over whether States had the constitutional latitude to\nrestrict evidence that did not “tend to reduce the defen\ndant’s culpability for his crime,” 476 U. S., at 11 (Powell,\nJ., concurring in judgment). As the following review of the\nrecord will underscore, that confusion pervaded every\naspect of respondent’s sentencing hearing. It addled the\ntrial judge, the prosecutor, defense counsel, and—\ninevitably—the jurors themselves.\n                               I\n   At the sentencing hearing, after the prosecution put on\nits case—which consisted mainly of evidence of respon\ndent’s previous conduct, see Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at 795,\n755 P. 2d, at 338–339—respondent countered with testi\nmony from his grandfather and his mother. That testi\nmony focused almost entirely on respondent’s background:\nHis father drank to excess and savagely beat his wife; his\nparents were divorced when he was 9 or 10 years old; his\nmother remarried, but again divorced when respondent\nwas 14 or 15 years old; at this point respondent became\ndifficult to control, and, in 1979, he was sent to the Cali\nfornia Youth Authority (Youth Authority); after his re\nlease, respondent did not live with his mother, although\nhe kept in touch with her by telephone and was very close\nwith his 15-year-old sister. See generally App. 5–22.\n   Next, the jury heard testimony from Robert Martinez\nand his wife Darlene, both of whom testified that they\nwere close friends with respondent but admitted that they\nhad seen him only once after he was released from the\nYouth Authority. Id., at 26–27, 35. Robert further testi\n6                  AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfied that respondent was the best man at his wedding and\nthat, prior to his wedding, the two of them would spend a\nlot of time together, working on Martinez’s car, drinking\nbeer, and smoking marijuana. Id., at 25, 28. The focus of\nDarlene’s testimony was that she was a born-again Chris\ntian, and that, when respondent visited Darlene and her\nhusband after his release from the Youth Authority, he\ntold her that he was also a born-again Christian. Id., at\n35–36.\n   Respondent then testified on his own behalf. When\nasked about his childhood, respondent answered that he\n“can’t use it as a crutch to say I am in a situation right\nnow, I’m here now because of that.” Id., at 40. He went on\nto describe his relationships with his father and grandfa\nther and to relate his experience at the Youth Authority.\nId., at 41–45. Respondent testified that, while at the\nYouth Authority, he became involved in a Christian pro\ngram and developed a relationship with his sponsors in\nthat program, Beverly and Fred Haro. Id., at 46–48.\nUpon his release, however, respondent started having\nproblems and abandoned his religious commitment, some\nthing he had not yet regained fully at the time of the\nsentencing hearing. Id., at 53–54. Respondent then de\nscribed his life in prison and stated that, were he given a\nlife sentence, he would attempt to make a positive contri\nbution to society. Id., at 55–58. On cross-examination,\nmost of the prosecutor’s questions focused on the sincerity\nof respondent’s religious commitment. Id., at 58–65.\n   The following day, respondent presented testimony from\nReverend Dale Barrett and Don Miller, both ministers\nwho worked at the Youth Authority location where re\nspondent was held. Reverend Barrett described the Youth\nAuthority’s M–2 program through which respondent was\nmatched with the Haros. Id., at 74–76. He then testified\nabout respondent’s involvement with the church and the\nM–2 program, and how his interactions with respondent\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nled him to believe that he was “salvageable.” Id., at 76–\n82. Miller similarly testified about respondent’s participa\ntion in the program and his belief that respondent would\nbe adept at speaking with other prisoners about accepting\nreligion. Id., at 92, 95–96; see also id., at 96 (testifying\nthat respondent would “[d]efinitely . . . be used in the\nprison system for this sort of activity”).\n   Finally, the jury heard testimony from respondent’s\nsponsors in the M–2 program, Fred and Beverly Haro.\nThe Haros described meeting respondent and their experi\nences with him. See generally id., at 99–104; 110–112.\nThey also testified about how close they had grown to\nrespondent and about respondent’s embrace of religion.\nId., at 101–102; 112–113.\n   Taken as a whole, the sentencing testimony supports\nthree conclusions: first, excepting questions concerning the\nsincerity of respondent’s religious convictions, there was\nno significant dispute about the credibility of the wit\nnesses; second, little if any of the testimony extenuated\nthe severity of respondent’s crime; and third, the testi\nmony afforded the jury a principled basis for imposing a\nsentence other than death.\n                               II\n  The prosecutor began his closing argument at the pen\nalty phase by describing “th[e] listing of aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances” and instructing the jury that it\nmust “weigh one against the other.” App. 148. While he\nobserved that “there is a proper place for sympathy and\npassion,” ibid., the prosecutor emphasized that the jury\ncould only consider “the kind of sympathy the instruction\ntells you to consider [i.e., sympathy that] naturally arises\nor properly arises from the factors in aggravation and\nmitigation.” Id., at 149 (emphasis added). He repeated to\nthe jury that its duty was to “simpl[y] weig[h]” certain\nfactors that the judge “will tell you that you may take into\n8                  AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\naccount,” id., at 150–151, and he went through those listed\nfactors one by one, carefully discussing the evidence that\nsupported each factor, id., at 151–157.\n   When the prosecutor turned to factor (k), he directly\naddressed the theory “that the defendant’s religious ex\nperience is within that catchall that relates to the defen\ndant at the time he committed the crime, extenuates the\ngravity of the crime.” Id., at 154. The prosecutor ex\npressed doubt that the jury could consider the evidence at\nall, stating “I’m not sure it really fits in there. I’m not\nsure it really fits in any of them. But I think it appears to\nbe a proper subject of consideration.” Ibid. And again,\nafter discussing the evidence supporting respondent’s\nreligious experience, the prosecutor questioned: “[I]s a\nreligious awakening a basis for determining penalty?\nThat’s really the issue, how much does that weigh, or does\nit weigh on one side or the other.” Id., at 155. Ultimately,\nthe prosecutor concluded: “I suppose you can say it would\nbe appropriate because—in this fashion: The defendant\nmay be of value to the community later. . . . And I think\nthat value to the community is something that you have to\nweigh in. There’s something to that.” Ibid. But immedi\nately thereafter, the prosecutor told the jury:\n       “On the other hand, the fact that someone has relig\n    ion as opposed to someone doesn’t should be no\n    grounds for either giving or withholding life. . . . So if\n    he says he has religion, does he deserve the other\n    penalty, life? I don’t think that that should be an in\n    fluencing factor at all in that respect. I don’t think the\n    law contemplates that and I don’t think it’s right.”\n    Ibid. (emphasis added).\nIn conclusion, the prosecutor described the circumstances\nof the crime and asserted that “[a] dreadful crime requires\na dreadful penalty . . . .” Id., at 160.\n   Following the prosecutor’s closing argument, the trial\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\njudge allowed respondent to address the jury directly.\nRespondent again stated that he could not use his child\nhood as a crutch to explain his mistakes, and he said that\nhis Christianity, too, could not be used as a crutch. Id., at\n162. Respondent then asked to keep his life, explaining\nthat he understood that he had to pay for the victim’s\ndeath, but that he wanted the opportunity to try to im\nprove himself in the future. Id., at 163.\n  Respondent’s attorney, John Schick, then addressed the\njury. He made no effort to persuade the jurors that the\nmitigating evidence somehow extenuated the severity of\nthe crime. On the contrary, he said “I’m not going to\ninsult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence]\nexcuses in any way what happened here. That is not the\nreason I asked these people to come in.” Id., at 166. In\nstead, he argued that respondent might be able to make a\npositive contribution in a prison environment. He spoke\nabout the way that respondent improved after he met\nBeverly and Fred Haro and about the way that respon\ndent’s religion shaped him, observing that religion plays a\n“very, very vital function . . . in anybody’s life.” Ibid. But\nSchick took care to emphasize that religion “does not\nexcuse” the murder; rather, the point of that mitigating\nevidence was to let the jury “know something about the\nman.” Id., at 167, 166. He admitted that respondent\n“cannot make it on the outside,” id., at 167, recognized\nthat respondent needed to be punished, and asked that the\njury impose life in prison, a punishment “that has mean\ning, that has teeth in it . . . .” Id., at 169. Critically,\nSchick contended that life in prison was an appropriate\nsentence because respondent could, if given the chance,\n“contribute something in whatever way he can.” Id., at\n170.\n  In sum, both counsel agreed that none of the mitigating\nevidence could detract from the gravity of the crime, and\ndefense counsel even insisted that it would “insult” the\n10                 AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\njury to suggest that the mitigating evidence “excuses in\nany way what happened.” Id., at 166.\n                              III\n   At a conference on jury instructions with the two coun\nsel, the trial judge plainly indicated that he believed that\nfactor (k) circumscribed the mitigating evidence the jury\ncould consider. The judge lifted the principal jury instruc\ntions verbatim from 7 of the 11 traditional sentencing\nfactors set forth in the statute, App. 184, but he refused\ndefense counsel’s request to give the jury a separate list of\npotential mitigating factors, id., at 142. Among those\nrequested were two that specifically instructed the jury to\nconsider respondent’s ability to perform constructive work\nin prison and to live in confinement without acts of vio\nlence. See Brief for Respondent 5, n. 1. Those instructions\nwould have been entirely proper—indeed, probably man\ndated—under our holding in Skipper. But the prosecutor,\nnot having the benefit of Skipper, argued to the judge that\n“none [of the proposed mitigating instructions] here . . .\nrelates to circumstances concerning the crime. I can’t\nconceal the fact that I think that is the determinative\nfactor in this case.” App. 142. Agreeing, the judge refused\nto include the mitigating instructions, making the aston\nishing statement that the instructions already “seem to be\na little over-laden with the factors in mitigation rather\nthan in aggravation.” Ibid.\n   Of particular importance, the judge modified defense\ncounsel’s request that the jury be told that the instruc\ntions did not contain an exhaustive list of mitigating\nfactors. Id., at 141. While he did give such an instruction,\nante, at 12, he refused to include the following requested\nreference to nonstatutory factors: “ ‘You may also consider\nany other circumstances [relating to the case or the defen\ndant, Mr. Belmontes,] as reasons for not imposing the\ndeath sentence.’ ” Brief for Respondent 25–26; contra App.\n                  Cite as: 549 U.

The judge thus expressly declined to invite the jury\nto weigh “potentially infinite mitigators,” contrary to the\nCourt’s assumption today, see ante, at 13. A more accu\nrate summary of his rulings is that the jury could weigh\nnonstatutory circumstances—but only if they extenuated\nthe severity of respondent’s offense.\n                               IV\n    The next morning, the trial judge gave the jurors their\ninstructions. He opened with the unyielding admonition\nthat “[y]ou must accept and follow the rules of law as I\nstate them to you,” App. 175, and explained that he was\nrequired to read the instructions aloud even though they\nwould have a written copy available during their delibera\ntions, ibid.\n    After reading a set of boilerplate instructions, id., at\n176–183, the judge turned to the subject of “determining\nwhich penalty is to be imposed on the defendant,” id., at\n183. He told the jury to “consider all of the evidence . . .\nexcept as you may be hereafter instructed,” ibid. (emphasis\nadded), and then stated: “You shall consider, take into\naccount and be guided by the following factors, if applica\nble.” Id., at 183–184. He then proceeded to repeat verba\ntim 7 of the 11 factors set forth in the statute. Id., at 184.\nExcept for the reference to the “age of the defendant at the\ntime of the crime,” ibid., every one of those factors related\nto the severity of the crime itself. See n. 1, supra. The\nlast of them, the factor (k) instruction, focused the jury’s\nattention on any circumstance that “extenuates the grav\nity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the\ncrime.” Ibid. No factor permitted the jury to consider\n“any other ‘aspect of [the] defendant’s character or record\n. . . that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence\nless than death.’ ” Easley, 34 Cal. 3d, at 878, n. 10, 671\nP. 2d, at 826, n. 10 (citing Lockett, 438 U. S., at 604).\n    Emphasizing the importance of the listing of aggravat\n12                 AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ning and mitigating circumstances, the judge next in\nstructed the jury that it “shall consider, take into account\nand be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances upon which you have been in\nstructed.” App. 185 (emphasis added). In other words, in\nreaching its decision, the jury was to consider each of the\n“applicable factors”—here, the seven factors the judge just\nfinished reading—and no others.\n   As the Court points out, ante, at 13, the judge did tell\nthe jury that “the mitigating circumstances which I have\nread for your consideration are given to you merely as\nexamples of some of the factors that you may take into\naccount as reasons for deciding not to impose . . . a death\nsentence . . . .” App. 186. But immediately afterwards, he\ninstructed the jury to “pay careful attention to each of\nthese factors. Any one of them standing alone may support\na decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in\nthis case.” Ibid. (emphasis added). Since none of “these\nfactors” (save for the age of the defendant) encompassed\nany mitigating circumstance unrelated to the severity of\nthe crime, the most natural reading of the instruction is\nthat any mitigating factor that lessens the severity of the\noffense may support a sentence other than death. On this\nview, any other mitigating circumstance is simply irrele\nvant to (in the prosecutor’s words) the “simple weighing”\nthe jury was tasked with performing. Id., at 150.\n                            V\n  Questions asked by at least six different jurors during\nalmost two full days of deliberation gave the judge an\nample opportunity to clarify that the testimony offered on\nbehalf of respondent, if credited by the jury, provided a\npermissible basis for imposing a sentence other than\ndeath. Far from eliminating their obvious confusion, his\nresponses cemented the impression that the jurors’ lone\nduty was to weigh specified, limited statutory factors\n                    Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)                 13\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nagainst each other.\n   After a lunch break, the judge reconvened the jury to\nanswer a question that does not appear in the record; in\nresponse, the judge merely reread instructions telling the\njury that it “must agree, if [it] can” and that it “shall con\nsider, take into account and be guided by the applicable\nfactors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon\nwhich you have been instructed.” App. 185, 188–189 (em\nphasis added). Because all of those factors were tradi\ntional sentencing factors, and because none of them per\nmitted consideration of Skipper-type mitigating evidence,\nthe judge’s response was the functional equivalent of yet\nanother admonition to disregard most of respondent’s\nevidence.\n   After a colloquy between the judge and four different\njurors (Hailstone, Wilson, Norton, and Huckabay) about\nthe likelihood of reaching a unanimous verdict,3 other\njurors asked the judge a series of questions reflecting a\nconcern about whether it was proper to consider aggravat\ning or mitigating circumstances other than those specifi\n——————\n  3 “JUROR   HAILSTONE: If we can’t, Judge, what happens?\n  “THE COURT: I can’t tell you that.\n  “JUROR WILSON: That is what we wanted to know.\n  “THE COURT: Okay.

South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4 (1986) (plurality opinion),\n\nrecognized that a defendant’s potential good behavior in the future\nwould not relate to his “culpability for the crime he committed.” Even the\nconcurrence agreed: “Almost by definition,” it reasoned, a prisoner’s\ngood behavior “neither excuses the defendant’s crime nor reduces his\nresponsibility for its commission.” Id., at 12 (Powell, J., concurring in\njudgment).\n                    Cite as: 549 U.

Cf. Brown v. Payton, 544 U. S. 133, 157 (2005)\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting) (“[I]t would be more than a\nstretch to say that the seriousness of the crime itself is\naffected by a defendant’s subsequent experience”). And\nrather than inviting an open-ended review of mitigating\nfactors that would include consideration of the defendant’s\npossible future behavior in prison, the judge’s answers\nemphasized the constraints on the “either/or” decision the\njurors had to make.5\n   The arguments of counsel, the actual instructions to the\njury, and this colloquy all support the conclusion that the\njurors understood their task was to run through the listed\nstatutory factors and weigh them against each other to\ndetermine whether respondent should be sentenced to\ndeath. Very little of respondent’s evidence, however, even\narguably “extenuate[d] the gravity of the crime.” In my\njudgment, it is for that reason much more likely than not\nthat the jury believed that the law forbade it from giving\nthat evidence any weight at all. The Court of Appeals\ntherefore correctly set aside respondent’s death sentence.\nSee Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 380 (1990) (plural\nity opinion) (requiring that a defendant show only that\n“there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied\nthe challenged instruction in a way that prevents the\nconsideration of constitutionally relevant evidence”).\n\n\n\n——————\n  5 When Juror Hailstone asked the judge about a particular piece of\n\nforward-looking evidence—the possibility that respondent would get\npsychiatric treatment in prison—the judge told the jury that it could\nnot consider that evidence in making its decision. The judge’s answer,\nwhile legally correct, lent further support to the conclusion that re\nspondent’s future conduct in a structured prison environment was not\nrelevant because it did not fall within any of the listed factors.\n16                  AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                               VI\n   Nothing in the Court’s opinion in Boyde upsets my view\nthat respondent’s death sentence cannot stand. Over the\ndissent of four Justices, the Court in Boyde both adopted a\nnew “legal standard for reviewing jury instructions\nclaimed to restrict impermissibly a jury’s consideration of\nrelevant evidence,” 494 U. S., at 378, and approved a\nblatantly atextual interpretation of the unadorned factor\n(k) instruction, id., at 382, and n. 5. Applying its new\nstandard and its dubious reading of factor (k), the Court\nheld that there was “not a reasonable likelihood that\nBoyde’s jurors interpreted the trial court’s instructions to\nprevent consideration of mitigating evidence of back\nground and character.” Id., at 381.\n   The Court rejected Boyde’s argument that factor (k)\nmade it impossible for the jury to consider testimony that\nBoyde had won a prize for dance choreography while in\nprison, which Boyde argued was Skipper-type evidence\nrelating to whether “he could lead a useful life behind\nbars,” 494 U. S., at 382, n. 5. But the Court did not hold or\nsuggest that factor (k) allowed for the consideration of\nSkipper-type evidence. Instead, the Court found that the\nevidence of his dance choreography talents was presented\nas part of his “overall strategy to portray himself as less\nculpable than other defendants due to his disadvantaged\nbackground and his character strengths,” ibid. (emphasis\nadded), and therefore fell within the ambit of factor (k).\nThus, although the Boyde opinion does not state so explic\nitly, it assumes that the factor (k) instruction would not\npermit the jury to consider Skipper-type “evidence of\npostcrime good prison behavior to show that [a defendant]\nwould not pose a danger to the prison community if sen\ntenced to life imprisonment rather than death.” Ibid.; see\nalso Skipper, 476 U. S., at 4 (recognizing that inferences\nregarding a defendant’s “probable future conduct if sen\ntenced to life in prison . . . would not relate specifically to\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)           17\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n[the defendant’s] culpability for the crime he committed”);\nPayton, 544 U. S., at 164 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (“Boyde\ndid not purport to hold that factor (k) naturally called\nfor consideration of postcrime changes of fundamental\nviews”).\n   Here, respondent contends that there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the judge’s instructions prevented the jury\nfrom considering precrime, forward-looking mitigation\nevidence regarding the possibility that he would lead a\nconstructive life in a prison setting. Not only does the\nCourt’s opinion in Boyde fail to support the improbable\nargument that respondent’s mitigating evidence falls\nwithin factor (k)’s purview, but its reasoning is entirely\nconsistent with the Court of Appeals’ contrary conclusion.\n   Similarly, the Court’s recent decision in Payton has\nlittle bearing here. In Payton, we granted certiorari to\ndecide whether the Ninth Circuit’s decision affirming the\nDistrict Court’s grant of habeas relief “was contrary to the\nlimits on federal habeas review imposed by 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d).” 544 U. S., at 136. In concluding that it was,\nthe Court relied heavily on the deferential standard of\nhabeas review established by the Antiterrorism and Effec\ntive Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.\nSee 544 U. S., at 141. And JUSTICE BREYER specifically\nstated that he only joined the five-Justice majority be\ncause “this is a case in which Congress’ instruction to\ndefer to the reasonable conclusions of state-court judges\nmakes a critical difference,” id., at 148 (concurring opin\nion), explaining that, were he a California state judge, he\n“would likely hold that Payton’s penalty-phase proceed\nings violated the Eighth Amendment [because] there\nmight well have been a reasonable likelihood that Payton’s\njury interpreted factor (k) in a way that prevented it from\nconsidering constitutionally relevant mitigating evi\ndence—namely, evidence of his postcrime religious conver\nsion,” ibid. (citation, alteration, and internal quotation\n18                 AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nmarks omitted). The fact that Payton was a case about\ndeference under AEDPA, rather than about a proper\nunderstanding of the scope of factor (k), is cause enough to\nconclude that it does not mandate any specific outcome\nhere.\n   Indeed, given that respondent’s trial occurred the same\nyear and involved the same jury instructions as Payton’s,\ncompare 544 U. S., at 156 (“ ‘[Y]ou shall consider all of the\nevidence which has been received during any part of the\ntrial in this case, except as you may be hereafter in\nstructed’ ”) (SOUTER, J., dissenting), with App. 183 (same),\nand because AEDPA does not apply to respondent’s case,\nthere are persuasive reasons for concluding that JUSTICE\nSOUTER’s powerful reasoning in Payton, rather than the\nmajority’s deferential review of a California court’s opin\nion, should guide our decision. In his dissenting opinion,\nJUSTICE SOUTER pointed out that Payton’s trial had oc\ncurred both before the California Supreme Court had\ndirected trial judges to supplement the factor (k) instruc\ntion and before the legislature had amended it. See 544\nU. S., at 158. Without those changes, he correctly con\ncluded, “any claim that factor (k) called for consideration\nof a defendant’s personal development in the wake of his\ncrime was simply at odds with common attitudes and the\nEnglish language.” Id., at 158–159.\n   Moreover, Payton did not deal with a record that dis\ncloses actual confusion among jurors, as this record does.\nSee supra, at 12–15. Nor did it involve a defense attorney\nwho, bolstering the prosecutor’s claim that factor (k) did\nnot allow the jury to consider respondent’s religious con\nversion, refused to “insult” the jury “by telling you I think\n[the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what hap\npened here,” App. 166. Therefore, even ignoring its sig\nnificantly different procedural posture, Payton, like Boyde,\nfalls far short of compelling the result that the Court\nreaches today.\n                   Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2006)             19\n\n                      STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                               VII\n   Instead of accepting that lay jurors would almost cer\ntainly give the words “circumstance which extenuates the\ngravity of the crime” their ordinary meaning, the Court\ninsists that they would have disregarded their instructions\nand considered evidence that had nothing whatsoever to\ndo with the crime. This conclusion seems to me to rest on\nan assumption that the jury had an uncanny ability to\npredict that future opinions would interpret factor (k) to\nmean something that neither the judge nor the lawyers\nthought it meant. Surely the more natural inference is that\nthe jury followed its instructions. See Greer v. Miller, 483\nU. S. 756, 766, n. 8 (1987) (plurality opinion) (describing our\n“presumption” that juries follow instructions).\n   The Court’s highly technical parsing of factor (k) de\npends on linguistic distinctions which would only occur to\ntrained lawyers. See, e.g., ante, at 11 (calling attention to\nthe “dichotomy within factor (k) . . . between a legal excuse\nand an extenuating circumstance”). And even the lawyers\nare confused. The prosecutor in Payton believed that\n“factor (k) d[oes] not permit consideration of postcrime\nrehabilitation evidence.” Ante, at 5. While the majority\nnow blithely characterizes this view as “incorrec[t],” ibid.,\nit is the natural reading of factor (k), and one that jurors\nwould have been likely to accept. Similarly, present-day\ncounsel for the State of California expressed confusion at\noral argument as to whether it would have been constitu\ntional for the trial judge to instruct the jury that it could not\nconsider any mitigating evidence unless it extenuated the\ngravity of the crime, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 8–9 (retreating\nfrom the statement that “[i]t would appear not to be” consti\ntutional). The Court cannot seriously insist that a group of\n12 laypersons had such command of constitutional law that,\nanticipating Skipper, they took into account evidence out\nside the ambit of their jury instructions.\n   The Court also apparently believes that when the prose\n20                 AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncutor in this case suggested that factor (k) meant exactly\nwhat it said, supra, at 8, the jury would have taken that\nas merely a comment on respondent’s credibility, ante, at\n9. But this rests on a clear misreading of the record.\nAlthough the prosecutor did argue that respondent lacked\nsincere religious convictions, he also suggested quite\npowerfully that the law did not permit the jury to consider\nthose convictions, however sincerely held. See App. 155 (“I\ndon’t think the law contemplates that and I don’t think it’s\nright” (emphasis added)). Nor is there any support for the\nCourt’s surprising and inherently contradictory view that\nwhile the prosecutor here “commented that the law did not\ncontemplate jury consideration of respondent’s religious\nconversion,” ante, at 10, “[n]othing the prosecutor said\nwould have convinced the jury that it was forbidden from\neven considering respondent’s religious conversion,” ibid.\n(emphasis added).\n   Admittedly, as the Court points out, there is a distinc\ntion between limiting the jury’s consideration “to circum\nstances of the crime” that extenuate its severity, and\nlimiting that consideration to “any other circumstance that\nmight excuse the crime,” see ante, at 7. It is highly\nunlikely, however, that jurors would note that subtle\ndistinction, and even more unlikely that they would con\nsider it significant. Both interpretations of the phrase\nfocus the jury’s attention on the crime, and neither in\ncludes the evidence at issue in Skipper, which “[a]lmost by\ndefinition . . . neither excuses the defendant’s crime nor\nreduces his responsibility for its commission.” 476 U. S.,\nat 12 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). Read however\ngenerously, the factor (k) limitation remains unconstitu\ntional.\n   The Court makes a similarly unpersuasive argument\nbased on the dubious premise that a juror would under\nstand “remorse” to be a species of postcrime evidence that\nserves to lessen or excuse the crime itself. Even if that\n                    Cite as: 549 U.

Ironically, both Chief Justice\nBurger (who wrote the plurality opinion in Lockett) and\nJustice Powell (who joined it) understood the Lockett rule\nto extend only to evidence “that lessens the defendant’s\nculpability for the crime.” Skipper, 476 U. S., at 12 (Pow\nell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concur\nring in judgment). Given that the authors of Lockett\nthemselves disagreed as to its scope, I am not as sanguine\nas the Court that the lay members of the jury somehow\nknew, notwithstanding clear jury instructions, that the\ntestimony presented at the sentencing phase of respon\ndent’s trial could be part of the “simple weighing” the jury\nwas supposed to undertake.\n   When the trial judge told the jurors to consider all the\nevidence “except as you may be hereinafter instructed,”\nApp. 183, he directed them to limit their consideration to\nthe traditional sentencing factors set forth in the statute.\nWhen the prosecutor told the jurors that “I don’t think the\nlaw contemplates” that respondent’s religion lessened the\n——————\n  6 In response to the majority’s suggestion that this case may be in\n\nconsistent with Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350 (1993), ante, at 16, I\nnote only that Johnson addressed a very different question, namely,\nwhether a jury considering future dangerousness could give adequate\nweight to a capital defendant’s youth. Whatever connection may exist\nbetween a defendant’s youth and his future dangerousness, there is no\nconnection whatsoever between respondent’s evidence that he was\ncapable of redemption and a “circumstance which extenuates the\ngravity of the crime,” Cal. Penal Code §190.3(k) (West 1988).\n22                 AYERS v. BELMONTES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nseriousness of respondent’s offense, id., at 155, he rein\nforced the impression that the jury should confine its\ndeliberations to the listing. And once defense counsel\nagreed with the prosecutor, saying that “I’m not going to\ninsult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence]\nexcuses in any way what happened here,” id., at 166,\nsurely at least some of the jurors would have doubted the\npropriety of speculating about respondent’s future conduct\nin prison as a basis for imposing a sentence less than\ndeath.\n   The Court today heaps speculation on speculation to\nreach the strange conclusion, out of step with our case law,\nthat a properly instructed jury disregarded its instructions\nand considered evidence that fell outside the narrow con\nfines of factor (k). Holding to the contrary, the Court\ninsists, would reduce two days of sentencing testimony to\n“a virtual charade,” ante, at 5 (internal quotation marks\nomitted)—but in so concluding the Court necessarily finds\nthat the judge’s instructions were themselves such a “cha\nrade” that the jury paid them no heed. I simply cannot\nbelieve that the jurors took it upon themselves to consider\ntestimony they were all but told they were forbidden from\nconsidering; in my view, they must at the very least have\nbeen confused as to whether the evidence could appropri\nately be considered. That confusion has created a risk of\nerror sufficient to warrant relief for a man who has spent\nmore than half his life on death row. Cf. Lackey v. Texas,\n514 U. S. 1045 (1995) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial of\ncertiorari). The incremental value to California of carry\ning out a death sentence at this late date is far outweighed\nby the interest in maintaining confidence in the fairness of\nany proceeding that results in a State’s decision to take\nthe life of one of its citizens. See Gardner v. Florida, 430\nU.
