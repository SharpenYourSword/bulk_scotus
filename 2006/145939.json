Decided April 3, 2006 \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG, dissenting from the denial of\ncertiorari.\n   This case, here for the second time, raises a question “of\nprofound importance to the Nation,” Rumsfeld v. Padilla,\n542 U. S. 426, 455 (2004) (STEVENS, J., dissenting): Does\nthe President have authority to imprison indefinitely a\nUnited States citizen arrested on United States soil dis\ntant from a zone of combat, based on an Executive decla\nration that the citizen was, at the time of his arrest, an\n“enemy combatant”? It is a question the Court heard, and\nshould have decided, two years ago. Ibid. Nothing the\nGovernment has yet done purports to retract the assertion\nof Executive power Padilla protests.\n   Although the Government has recently lodged charges\nagainst Padilla in a civilian court, nothing prevents the\nExecutive from returning to the road it earlier constructed\nand defended. A party’s voluntary cessation does not\nmake a case less capable of repetition or less evasive of\nreview. See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 17 (1998) (the\ncapable-of-repetition exception to mootness applies where\n“(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be\nfully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there\n[is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining\nparty [will] be subject to the same action again” (emphasis\nadded)) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);\ncf.
