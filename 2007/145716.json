We decide whether this restriction, as applied to public-sector labor unions, violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The National Labor Relations Act leaves States free to regulate their labor relationships with their public employees. See 49 Stat. 450, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 152(2). The labor laws of many States authorize a union and a government employer to enter into what is commonly known as an agency-shop agreement. This arrangement entitles the union to levy a fee on employees who are not union members but who are nevertheless represented by the union in collective bargaining. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2377</span> <i>Assn.,</i> 500 U.S. 507, 511, 111 S.Ct. 1950, 114 L.Ed.2d 572 (1991). The primary purpose of such arrangements is to prevent nonmembers from free-riding on the union's efforts, sharing the employment benefits obtained by the union's collective bargaining without sharing the costs incurred. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Machinists v. Street,</i> 367 U.S. 740, 760-764, 81 S.Ct. 1784, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961). However, agency-shop arrangements in the public sector raise First Amendment concerns because they force individuals to contribute money to unions as a condition of government employment. Thus, in <i>Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed.,</i> 431 U.S. 209, 235-236, 97 S.Ct. 1782, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977), we held that public-sector unions are constitutionally prohibited from using the fees of objecting nonmembers for ideological purposes that are not germane to the union's collective-bargaining duties. And in <i>Teachers v. Hudson,</i> 475 U.S. 292, 302, 304-310, 106 S.Ct. 1066, 89 L.Ed.2d 232 (1986), we set forth various procedural requirements that public-sector unions collecting agency fees must observe in order to ensure that an objecting nonmember can prevent the use of his fees for impermissible purposes. Neither <i>Hudson</i> nor any of our other cases, however, has held that the First Amendment mandates that a public-sector union obtain affirmative consent before spending a nonmember's agency fees for purposes not chargeable under <i>Abood.</i></p>\n<p>The State of Washington has authorized public-sector unions to negotiate agency-shop agreements. Where such agreements are in effect, Washington law allows the union to charge nonmembers an agency fee equivalent to the full membership dues of the union and to have this fee collected by the employer through payroll deductions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Wash. Rev.Code §§ 41.56.122(1), 41.59.060(2), 41.59.100 (2006). However, § 42.17.760 (hereinafter § 760), which is a provision of the Fair Campaign Practices Act (a state initiative approved by the voters of Washington in 1992), restricts the union's ability to spend the agency fees that it collects. Section 760, as it stood when the decision under review was rendered, provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A labor organization may not use agency shop fees paid by an individual who is not a member of the organization to make contributions or expenditures to influence an election or to operate a political committee, unless affirmatively authorized by the individual.\"<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Respondent, the exclusive bargaining agent for approximately 70,000 public educational employees, collected agency fees from nonmembers that it represented in collective bargaining. Consistent with its responsibilities under <i>Abood</i> and <i>Hudson</i> (or so we assume for purposes of these cases), respondent sent a \"<i>Hudson</i> packet\" to all nonmembers twice a year, notifying them of their right to object to paying fees for nonchargeable expenditures, and giving them three options: (1) pay full agency fees by not objecting within 30 days; (2) object to paying for nonchargeable expenses <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2378</span> and receive a rebate as calculated by respondent; or (3) object to paying for nonchargeable expenses and receive a rebate as determined by an arbitrator. Respondent held in escrow any agency fees that were reasonably in dispute until the <i>Hudson</i> process was complete.</p>\n<p>In 2001, respondent found itself in Washington state courts defending, in two separate lawsuits, its expenditures of nonmembers' agency fees. The first lawsuit was brought by the State of Washington, petitioner in No. 05-1657, and the second was brought as a putative class action by several nonmembers of the union, petitioners in No. 05-1589. Both suits claimed that respondent's use of agency fees was in violation of § 760. Petitioners alleged that respondent had failed to obtain affirmative authorization from nonmembers before using their agency fees for the election-related purposes specified in § 760. In No. 05-1657, after a trial on the merits, the trial court found that respondent had violated § 760 and awarded the State both monetary and injunctive relief. In No. 05-1589, a different trial judge held that § 760 provided a private right of action, certified the class, and stayed further proceedings pending interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p>After intermediate appellate court proceedings, a divided Supreme Court of Washington held that, although a nonmember's failure to object after receiving respondent's \"<i>Hudson</i> packet\" did not satisfy § 760's affirmative-authorization requirement as a matter of state law, the statute's imposition of such a requirement violated the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution. See <i>State ex rel. Washington State Public Disclosure Comm'n v. Washington Ed. Assn.,</i> 156 Wash.2d 543, 553-571, 130 P.3d 352, 356-365 (2006) (en banc). The court reasoned that this Court's agency-fee jurisprudence established a balance between the First Amendment rights of unions and of nonmembers, and that § 760 triggered heightened First Amendment scrutiny because it deviated from that balance by imposing on respondent the burden of confirming that a nonmember does not object to the expenditure of his agency fees for electoral purposes. The court also held that § 760 interfered with respondent's expressive associational rights under <i>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,</i> 530 U.S. 640, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000). We granted certiorari. 548 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 35, 165 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The public-sector agency-shop arrangement authorizes a union to levy fees on government employees who do not wish to join the union. Regardless of one's views as to the desirability of agency-shop agreements, see <i>Abood,</i> 431 U.S., at 225, n. 20, 97 S.Ct. 1782, it is undeniably unusual for a government agency to give a private entity the power, in essence, to tax government employees. As applied to agency-shop agreements with public-sector unions like respondent, § 760 is simply a condition on the union's exercise of this extraordinary power, prohibiting expenditure of a nonmember's agency fees for election-related purposes unless the nonmember affirmatively consents. The notion that this modest limitation upon an extraordinary benefit-violates the First Amendment is, to say the least, counterintuitive. Respondent concedes that Washington could have gone much further, restricting public-sector agency fees to the portion of union dues devoted to collective bargaining. See Brief for Respondent 46-47. Indeed, it is uncontested that it would be constitutional for Washington to eliminate agency fees entirely. See <i>id.,</i> at 46 (citing <i>Lincoln Fed. Union v. Northwestern Iron &amp; Metal Co.,</i> 335 U.S. 525, 69 S.Ct. 251, 93 L.Ed. 212 (1949)). For the reasons that follow, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2379</span> we conclude that the far less restrictive limitation the voters of Washington placed on respondent's authorization to exact money from government employees is of no greater constitutional concern.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The principal reason the Supreme Court of Washington concluded that § 760 was unconstitutional was that it believed that our agency-fee cases, having balanced the constitutional rights of unions and of nonmembers, dictated that a nonmember must shoulder the burden of objecting before a union can be barred from spending his fees for purposes impermissible under <i>Abood.</i> See 156 Wash.2d, at 557-563, 130 P.3d, at 358-360. The court reached this conclusion primarily because our cases have repeatedly invoked the following proposition: \"`[D]issent is not to be presumedit must affirmatively be made known to the union by the dissenting employee.'\" <i>Hudson,</i> 475 U.S., at 306, n. 16, 106 S.Ct. 1066 (quoting <i>Street,</i> 367 U.S., at 774, 81 S.Ct. 1784); see also <i>Abood, supra,</i> at 238, 97 S.Ct. 1782. The court concluded that § 760 triggered heightened First Amendment scrutiny because it deviated from this perceived constitutional balance by requiring unions to obtain affirmative consent.</p>\n<p>This interpretation of our agency-fee cases extends them well beyond their proper ambit. Those cases were not balancing constitutional rights in the manner respondent suggests, for the simple reason that unions have no constitutional entitlement to the fees of nonmember-employees. See <i>Lincoln Fed. Union, supra,</i> at 529-531, 69 S.Ct. 251. We have never suggested that the First Amendment is implicated whenever governments place limitations on a union's entitlement to agency fees above and beyond what <i>Abood</i> and <i>Hudson</i> require. To the contrary, we have described <i>Hudson</i> as \"outlin[ing] a <i>minimum</i> set of procedures by which a [public-sector] union in an agency-shop relationship could meet its requirement under <i>Abood.</i>\" <i>Keller v. State Bar of Cal.,</i> 496 U.S. 1, 17, 110 S.Ct. 2228, 110 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990) (emphasis added). The mere fact that Washington required more than the <i>Hudson</i> minimum does not trigger First Amendment scrutiny. The constitutional floor for unions' collection and spending of agency fees is not also a constitutional ceiling for state-imposed restrictions.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Washington read far too much into our admonition that \"dissent is not to be presumed.\" We meant only that it would be improper for a court to enjoin the expenditure of the agency fees of all employees, including those who had not objected, when the statutory or constitutional limitations established in those cases could be satisfied by a narrower remedy. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Street, supra,</i> at 768-770, 772-775, 81 S.Ct. 1784 (discussing possible judicial remedies for violation of a federal statute that forbade unions from spending <i>objecting</i> employees' fees for political purposes); <i>Abood, supra,</i> at 235-236, 237-242, 97 S.Ct. 1782 (discussing possible judicial remedies for a state statute that unconstitutionally authorized a public-sector union to spend <i>objecting</i> nonmembers' agency fees for ideological purposes not germane to collective bargaining); <i>Hudson, supra,</i> at 302, 304-310, 106 S.Ct. 1066 (setting forth procedures necessary to prevent agency-shop arrangements from violating <i>Abood</i>). But, as the dissenting justices below correctly recognized, our repeated affirmation that <i>courts</i> have an obligation to interfere with a union's statutory entitlement no more than is necessary to vindicate the rights of nonmembers does not imply that legislatures (or voters) themselves cannot limit the scope of that entitlement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2380</span> B</h2>\n<p>Respondent defends the judgment below on a ground quite different from the mistaken rationale adopted by the Supreme Court of Washington. Its argument begins with the premise that § 760 is a limitation on how the union may spend \"its\" money, citing for that proposition the Washington Supreme Court's description of § 760 as encumbering funds that are lawfully within a union's possession. Brief for Respondent 21; 156 Wash.2d, at 568-569, 130 P.3d, at 363-364. Relying on that premise, respondent invokes <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978), <i>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce,</i> 494 U.S. 652, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990), and related campaign-finance cases. It argues that, under the rigorous First Amendment scrutiny required by those cases, § 760 is unconstitutional because it applies to ballot propositions and because it does not limit equivalent election-related expenditures by corporations.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Washington's description of § 760 notwithstanding, our campaign-finance cases are not on point. For purposes of the First Amendment, it is entirely immaterial that § 760 restricts a union's use of funds only after those funds are already within the union's lawful possession under Washington law. What matters is that public-sector agency fees are in the union's possession only because Washington and its union-contracting government agencies have compelled their employees to pay those fees. The cases upon which respondent relies deal with governmental restrictions on how a regulated entity may spend money that has come into its possession without the assistance of governmental coercion of its employees. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 767-768, 98 S.Ct. 1407; <i>Austin, supra,</i> at 654-656, 110 S.Ct. 1391. As applied to public-sector unions, § 760 is not fairly described as a restriction on how the union can spend \"its\" money; it is a condition placed upon the union's extraordinary <i>state</i> entitlement to acquire and spend <i>other people's</i> money.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The question that must be asked, therefore, is whether § 760 is a constitutional condition on the authorization that public-sector unions enjoy to charge government employees agency fees. Respondent essentially answers that the statute unconstitutionally draws distinctions based on the content of the union's speech, requiring affirmative consent only for election-related expenditures while permitting expenditures for the rest of the purposes not chargeable under <i>Abood</i> unless the nonmember objects. The contention that this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2381</span> amounts to unconstitutional content-based discrimination is off the mark.</p>\n<p>It is true enough that content-based regulations of speech are presumptively invalid. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>R.A.V. v. St. Paul,</i> 505 U.S. 377, 382, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (citing cases). We have recognized, however, that \"[t]he rationale of the general prohibition ... is that content discrimination `raises the specter that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 387, 112 S.Ct. 2538 (quoting <i>Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,</i> 502 U.S. 105, 116, 112 S.Ct. 501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991)). And we have identified numerous situations in which that risk is inconsequential, so that strict scrutiny is unwarranted. For example, speech that is obscene or defamatory can be constitutionally proscribed because the social interest in order and morality outweighs the negligible contribution of those categories of speech to the marketplace of ideas. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>R.A.V.,</i> 505 U.S., at 382-384, 112 S.Ct. 2538. Similarly, content discrimination among various instances of a class of proscribable speech does not pose a threat to the marketplace of ideas when the selected subclass is chosen for the very reason that the entire class can be proscribed. See <i>id.,</i> at 388, 112 S.Ct. 2538 (confirming that governments may choose to ban only the most prurient obscenity). Of particular relevance here, our cases recognize that the risk that content-based distinctions will impermissibly interfere with the marketplace of ideas is sometimes attenuated when the government is acting in a capacity other than as regulator. Accordingly, it is well established that the government can make content-based distinctions when it subsidizes speech. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash.,</i> 461 U.S. 540, 548-550, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983). And it is also black-letter law that, when the government permits speech on government property that is a nonpublic forum, it can exclude speakers on the basis of their subject matter, so long as the distinctions drawn are viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,</i> 473 U.S. 788, 799-800, 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985).</p>\n<p>The principle underlying our treatment of those situations is equally applicable to the narrow circumstances of these cases. We do not believe that the voters of Washington impermissibly distorted the marketplace of ideas when they placed a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral limitation on the State's general authorization allowing public-sector unions to acquire and spend the money of government employees. As the Supreme Court of Washington recognized, the voters of Washington sought to protect the integrity of the election process, see 156 Wash.2d, at 563, 130 P.3d, at 361, which the voters evidently thought was being impaired by the infusion of money extracted from nonmembers of unions without their consent. The restriction on the state-bestowed entitlement was thus limited to the state-created harm that the voters sought to remedy. The voters did not have to enact an across-the-board limitation on the use of nonmembers' agency fees by public-sector unions in order to vindicate their more narrow concern with the integrity of the election process. We said in <i>R.A.V.</i> that, when totally proscribable speech is at issue, content-based regulation is permissible so long as \"there is no realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.\" 505 U.S., at 390, 112 S.Ct. 2538. We think the same is true when, as here, an extraordinary and totally repealable authorization <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2382</span> to coerce payment from government employees is at issue. Even if it be thought necessary that the content limitation be reasonable and viewpoint neutral, cf. <i>Cornelius, supra,</i> at 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439, the statute satisfies that requirement. Quite obviously, no suppression of ideas is afoot, since the union remains as free as any other entity to participate in the electoral process with all available funds other than the state-coerced agency fees lacking affirmative permission. Cf. <i>Regan, supra,</i> at 549-550, 103 S.Ct. 1997 (First Amendment does not require the government to enhance a person's ability to speak). In sum, given the unique context of public-sector agency-shop arrangements, the content-based nature of § 760 does not violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>We emphasize an important limitation upon our holding: we uphold § 760 only as applied to public-sector unions such as respondent. Section 760 applies on its face to both public- and private-sector unions in Washington.<sup>[3]</sup> Since private-sector unions collect agency fees through contractually required action taken by private employers rather than by government agencies, Washington's regulation of those private arrangements presents a somewhat different constitutional question.<sup>[4]</sup> We need not answer that question today, however, because at no stage of this litigation has respondent made an overbreadth challenge. See generally <i>Schaumburg v. Citizens for Better Environment,</i> 444 U.S. 620, 633-634, 100 S.Ct. 826, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980) (applying overbreadth doctrine).<sup>[5]</sup> Instead, respondent has consistently argued simply that § 760 is unconstitutional as applied to itself. The only purpose for which it has noted the statute's applicability to private-sector unions is to establish that the statute was meant to be a general limitation on electoral speech, and not just a condition on state agencies' authorization of compulsory agency fees. See Brief for Respondent 24, 48. That limited contention, however, is both unconvincing and immaterial. The purpose of the voters of Washington was undoubtedly the general one of protecting the integrity of elections by limiting electoral spending in certain ways. But § 760, though applicable to all unions, served that purpose through very different means depending on the type of union involved: It <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2383</span> <i>conditioned</i> public-sector unions' authorization to coerce fees from government employees at the same time that it <i>regulated</i> private-sector unions' collective-bargaining agreements. The constitutionality of the means chosen with respect to private-sector unions has no bearing on whether § 760 is constitutional as applied to public-sector unions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We hold that it does not violate the First Amendment for a State to require that its public-sector unions receive affirmative authorization from a nonmember before spending that nonmember's agency fees for election-related purposes. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington and remand the cases for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice ALITO join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the Supreme Court of Washington's decision rested entirely on flawed interpretations of this Court's agency-fee cases and our decision in <i>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,</i> 530 U.S. 640, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000). I therefore concur in the Court's judgment, and I join Parts I and II-A and the second paragraph of n. 2 of the Court's opinion. However, I do not join Part II-B, which addresses numerous arguments that respondent Washington Education Association raised for the first time in its briefs before this Court. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>State ex rel. Washington State Public Disclosure Comm'n v. Washington Ed. Assn.,</i> 156 Wash.2d 543, 565, n. 6, 130 P.3d 352, 362, n. 6, (2006) (en banc) (noting that one of these arguments was neither raised nor addressed below). I would not address those arguments until the lower courts have been given the opportunity to address them. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith,</i> 525 U.S. 459, 469-470, 119 S.Ct. 924, 142 L.Ed.2d 929 (1999).</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Washington has since amended § 760 to codify a narrower interpretation of \"use\" of agency-shop fees than the interpretation adopted below by the state trial court that passed on that question. See Supp. Brief for Respondent 2-3. As respondent concedes, however, <i>id.,</i> at 3, these cases are not moot. Because petitioners sought money damages for respondent's alleged violation of the prior version of § 760, it still matters whether the Supreme Court of Washington was correct to hold that that version was inconsistent with the First Amendment. Our analysis of whether § 760's affirmative-authorization requirement violates the constitutional rights of respondent is not affected by the amendment, which merely causes that requirement to be applicable less frequently than the state trial court thought.</p>\n<p>[2]  Respondent might have had a point if, as it suggests at times, the statute burdened its ability to spend the dues of its own members. But § 760 restricts solely the \"use [of] agency shop fees paid by an individual who is not a member.\" The only reason respondent's use of its members' dues was burdened is that respondent chose to commingle those dues with nonmembers' agency fees. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 05-1657, pp. 99a, 105a-107a. Respondent's improvident accounting practices do not render § 760 unconstitutional. We note as well that, given current technology, it will not likely be burdensome for any nonmember who wishes to do so to provide affirmative authorization for use of his fees for electoral expenditures.\n</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, the Supreme Court of Washington's invocation of the union's expressive associational rights under <i>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,</i> 530 U.S. 640, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000), was quite misplaced, as respondent basically concedes by not relying upon the case. Section 760 does not compel respondent's acceptance of unwanted members or otherwise make union membership less attractive. See <i>Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.,</i> 547 U.S. 47, 68-69, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006).</p>\n<p>[3]  Under the National Labor Relations Act, it is generally not an unfair labor practice for private-sector employers to enter into agency-shop arrangements, see 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3), but States retain the power under the Act to ban the execution or application of such agreements, see § 164(b).</p>\n<p>[4]  We do not suggest that the answer must be different. We have previously construed the authorization of private-sector agency-shop arrangements in the National Labor Relations Act in a manner that is arguably content based. See <i>Communications Workers v. Beck,</i> 487 U.S. 735, 738, 762-763, 108 S.Ct. 2641, 101 L.Ed.2d 634 (1988) (§ 158(a)(3) authorizes expenditure of private-sector agency fees over a nonmember's objection only in furtherance of the union's obligations as exclusive bargaining representative); <i>Ellis v. Railway Clerks,</i> 466 U.S. 435, 450-451, 104 S.Ct. 1883, 80 L.Ed.2d 428 (1984) (expenditures on publications that report about a union's activities as exclusive bargaining representative can be charged to nonmembers over their objection).</p>\n<p>[5]  Nor is it clear that the \"strong medicine\" of the overbreadth doctrine is even available to challenge a statute such as § 760.

We decide whether this restriction, as applied to public-sector labor unions, violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The National Labor Relations Act leaves States free to regulate their labor relationships with their public employees. See 49 Stat. 450, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 152(2). The labor laws of many States authorize a union and a government employer to enter into what is commonly known as an agency-shop agreement. This arrangement entitles the union to levy a fee on employees who are not union members but who are nevertheless represented by the union in collective bargaining. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2377</span> <i>Assn.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112607\"><a href=\"/opinion/112607/lehnert-v-ferris-faculty-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 511, 111 S.Ct. 1950, 114 L.Ed.2d 572 (1991). The primary purpose of such arrangements is to prevent nonmembers from free-riding on the union's efforts, sharing the employment benefits obtained by the union's collective bargaining without sharing the costs incurred. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Machinists v. Street,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106288\"><a href=\"/opinion/106288/machinists-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span>, 760-764, 81 S.Ct. 1784, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961). However, agency-shop arrangements in the public sector raise First Amendment concerns because they force individuals to contribute money to unions as a condition of government employment. Thus, in <i>Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109661\"><a href=\"/opinion/109661/abood-v-detroit-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, 235-236, 97 S.Ct. 1782, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977), we held that public-sector unions are constitutionally prohibited from using the fees of objecting nonmembers for ideological purposes that are not germane to the union's collective-bargaining duties. And in <i>Teachers v. Hudson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111609\"><a href=\"/opinion/111609/teachers-v-hudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 302, 304-310, 106 S.Ct. 1066, 89 L.Ed.2d 232 (1986), we set forth various procedural requirements that public-sector unions collecting agency fees must observe in order to ensure that an objecting nonmember can prevent the use of his fees for impermissible purposes. Neither <i>Hudson</i> nor any of our other cases, however, has held that the First Amendment mandates that a public-sector union obtain affirmative consent before spending a nonmember's agency fees for purposes not chargeable under <i>Abood.</i></p>\n<p>The State of Washington has authorized public-sector unions to negotiate agency-shop agreements. Where such agreements are in effect, Washington law allows the union to charge nonmembers an agency fee equivalent to the full membership dues of the union and to have this fee collected by the employer through payroll deductions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Wash. Rev.Code §§ 41.56.122(1), 41.59.060(2), 41.59.100 (2006). However, § 42.17.760 (hereinafter § 760), which is a provision of the Fair Campaign Practices Act (a state initiative approved by the voters of Washington in 1992), restricts the union's ability to spend the agency fees that it collects. Section 760, as it stood when the decision under review was rendered, provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A labor organization may not use agency shop fees paid by an individual who is not a member of the organization to make contributions or expenditures to influence an election or to operate a political committee, unless affirmatively authorized by the individual.\"<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Respondent, the exclusive bargaining agent for approximately 70,000 public educational employees, collected agency fees from nonmembers that it represented in collective bargaining. Consistent with its responsibilities under <i>Abood</i> and <i>Hudson</i> (or so we assume for purposes of these cases), respondent sent a \"<i>Hudson</i> packet\" to all nonmembers twice a year, notifying them of their right to object to paying fees for nonchargeable expenditures, and giving them three options: (1) pay full agency fees by not objecting within 30 days; (2) object to paying for nonchargeable expenses <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2378</span> and receive a rebate as calculated by respondent; or (3) object to paying for nonchargeable expenses and receive a rebate as determined by an arbitrator. Respondent held in escrow any agency fees that were reasonably in dispute until the <i>Hudson</i> process was complete.</p>\n<p>In 2001, respondent found itself in Washington state courts defending, in two separate lawsuits, its expenditures of nonmembers' agency fees. The first lawsuit was brought by the State of Washington, petitioner in No. 05-1657, and the second was brought as a putative class action by several nonmembers of the union, petitioners in No. 05-1589. Both suits claimed that respondent's use of agency fees was in violation of § 760. Petitioners alleged that respondent had failed to obtain affirmative authorization from nonmembers before using their agency fees for the election-related purposes specified in § 760. In No. 05-1657, after a trial on the merits, the trial court found that respondent had violated § 760 and awarded the State both monetary and injunctive relief. In No. 05-1589, a different trial judge held that § 760 provided a private right of action, certified the class, and stayed further proceedings pending interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p>After intermediate appellate court proceedings, a divided Supreme Court of Washington held that, although a nonmember's failure to object after receiving respondent's \"<i>Hudson</i> packet\" did not satisfy § 760's affirmative-authorization requirement as a matter of state law, the statute's imposition of such a requirement violated the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution. See <i>State ex rel. Washington State Public Disclosure Comm'n v. Washington Ed. Assn.,</i> 156 Wash.2d 543, 553-571, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2622770\"><a href=\"/opinion/2622770/state-ex-rel-public-disclosure-comm-v-wea/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 356-365 (2006) (en banc). The court reasoned that this Court's agency-fee jurisprudence established a balance between the First Amendment rights of unions and of nonmembers, and that § 760 triggered heightened First Amendment scrutiny because it deviated from that balance by imposing on respondent the burden of confirming that a nonmember does not object to the expenditure of his agency fees for electoral purposes. The court also held that § 760 interfered with respondent's expressive associational rights under <i>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000). We granted certiorari. 548 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 35, 165 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The public-sector agency-shop arrangement authorizes a union to levy fees on government employees who do not wish to join the union. Regardless of one's views as to the desirability of agency-shop agreements, see <i>Abood,</i> 431 U.S., at 225, n. 20, 97 S.Ct. 1782, it is undeniably unusual for a government agency to give a private entity the power, in essence, to tax government employees. As applied to agency-shop agreements with public-sector unions like respondent, § 760 is simply a condition on the union's exercise of this extraordinary power, prohibiting expenditure of a nonmember's agency fees for election-related purposes unless the nonmember affirmatively consents. The notion that this modest limitation upon an extraordinary benefit-violates the First Amendment is, to say the least, counterintuitive. Respondent concedes that Washington could have gone much further, restricting public-sector agency fees to the portion of union dues devoted to collective bargaining. See Brief for Respondent 46-47. Indeed, it is uncontested that it would be constitutional for Washington to eliminate agency fees entirely. See <i>id.,</i> at 46 (citing <i>Lincoln Fed. Union v. Northwestern Iron &amp; Metal Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104610\"><a href=\"/opinion/104610/lincoln-union-v-northwestern-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 69 S.Ct. 251, 93 L.Ed. 212 (1949)). For the reasons that follow, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2379</span> we conclude that the far less restrictive limitation the voters of Washington placed on respondent's authorization to exact money from government employees is of no greater constitutional concern.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The principal reason the Supreme Court of Washington concluded that § 760 was unconstitutional was that it believed that our agency-fee cases, having balanced the constitutional rights of unions and of nonmembers, dictated that a nonmember must shoulder the burden of objecting before a union can be barred from spending his fees for purposes impermissible under <i>Abood.</i> See 156 Wash.2d, at 557-563, 130 P.3d, at 358-360. The court reached this conclusion primarily because our cases have repeatedly invoked the following proposition: \"`[D]issent is not to be presumedit must affirmatively be made known to the union by the dissenting employee.'\" <i>Hudson,</i> 475 U.S., at 306, n. 16, 106 S.Ct. 1066 (quoting <i>Street,</i> 367 U.S., at 774, 81 S.Ct. 1784); see also <i>Abood, supra,</i> at 238, 97 S.Ct. 1782. The court concluded that § 760 triggered heightened First Amendment scrutiny because it deviated from this perceived constitutional balance by requiring unions to obtain affirmative consent.</p>\n<p>This interpretation of our agency-fee cases extends them well beyond their proper ambit. Those cases were not balancing constitutional rights in the manner respondent suggests, for the simple reason that unions have no constitutional entitlement to the fees of nonmember-employees. See <i>Lincoln Fed. Union, supra,</i> at 529-531, 69 S.Ct. 251. We have never suggested that the First Amendment is implicated whenever governments place limitations on a union's entitlement to agency fees above and beyond what <i>Abood</i> and <i>Hudson</i> require. To the contrary, we have described <i>Hudson</i> as \"outlin[ing] a <i>minimum</i> set of procedures by which a [public-sector] union in an agency-shop relationship could meet its requirement under <i>Abood.</i>\" <i>Keller v. State Bar of Cal.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112443\"><a href=\"/opinion/112443/keller-v-state-bar-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17, 110 S.Ct. 2228, 110 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990) (emphasis added). The mere fact that Washington required more than the <i>Hudson</i> minimum does not trigger First Amendment scrutiny. The constitutional floor for unions' collection and spending of agency fees is not also a constitutional ceiling for state-imposed restrictions.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Washington read far too much into our admonition that \"dissent is not to be presumed.\" We meant only that it would be improper for a court to enjoin the expenditure of the agency fees of all employees, including those who had not objected, when the statutory or constitutional limitations established in those cases could be satisfied by a narrower remedy. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Street, supra,</i> at 768-770, 772-775, 81 S.Ct. 1784 (discussing possible judicial remedies for violation of a federal statute that forbade unions from spending <i>objecting</i> employees' fees for political purposes); <i>Abood, supra,</i> at 235-236, 237-242, 97 S.Ct. 1782 (discussing possible judicial remedies for a state statute that unconstitutionally authorized a public-sector union to spend <i>objecting</i> nonmembers' agency fees for ideological purposes not germane to collective bargaining); <i>Hudson, supra,</i> at 302, 304-310, 106 S.Ct. 1066 (setting forth procedures necessary to prevent agency-shop arrangements from violating <i>Abood</i>). But, as the dissenting justices below correctly recognized, our repeated affirmation that <i>courts</i> have an obligation to interfere with a union's statutory entitlement no more than is necessary to vindicate the rights of nonmembers does not imply that legislatures (or voters) themselves cannot limit the scope of that entitlement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2380</span> B</h2>\n<p>Respondent defends the judgment below on a ground quite different from the mistaken rationale adopted by the Supreme Court of Washington. Its argument begins with the premise that § 760 is a limitation on how the union may spend \"its\" money, citing for that proposition the Washington Supreme Court's description of § 760 as encumbering funds that are lawfully within a union's possession. Brief for Respondent 21; 156 Wash.2d, at 568-569, 130 P.3d, at 363-364. Relying on that premise, respondent invokes <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978), <i>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112398\"><a href=\"/opinion/112398/austin-v-michigan-chamber-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990), and related campaign-finance cases. It argues that, under the rigorous First Amendment scrutiny required by those cases, § 760 is unconstitutional because it applies to ballot propositions and because it does not limit equivalent election-related expenditures by corporations.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Washington's description of § 760 notwithstanding, our campaign-finance cases are not on point. For purposes of the First Amendment, it is entirely immaterial that § 760 restricts a union's use of funds only after those funds are already within the union's lawful possession under Washington law. What matters is that public-sector agency fees are in the union's possession only because Washington and its union-contracting government agencies have compelled their employees to pay those fees. The cases upon which respondent relies deal with governmental restrictions on how a regulated entity may spend money that has come into its possession without the assistance of governmental coercion of its employees. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 767-768, 98 S.Ct. 1407; <i>Austin, supra,</i> at 654-656, 110 S.Ct. 1391. As applied to public-sector unions, § 760 is not fairly described as a restriction on how the union can spend \"its\" money; it is a condition placed upon the union's extraordinary <i>state</i> entitlement to acquire and spend <i>other people's</i> money.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The question that must be asked, therefore, is whether § 760 is a constitutional condition on the authorization that public-sector unions enjoy to charge government employees agency fees. Respondent essentially answers that the statute unconstitutionally draws distinctions based on the content of the union's speech, requiring affirmative consent only for election-related expenditures while permitting expenditures for the rest of the purposes not chargeable under <i>Abood</i> unless the nonmember objects. The contention that this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2381</span> amounts to unconstitutional content-based discrimination is off the mark.</p>\n<p>It is true enough that content-based regulations of speech are presumptively invalid. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>R.A.V. v. St. Paul,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112774\"><a href=\"/opinion/112774/rav-v-st-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span>, 382, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (citing cases). We have recognized, however, that \"[t]he rationale of the general prohibition ... is that content discrimination `raises the specter that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 387, 112 S.Ct. 2538 (quoting <i>Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112664\"><a href=\"/opinion/112664/simon-schuster-inc-v-members-of-ny-state-crime-vic/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 116, 112 S.Ct. 501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991)). And we have identified numerous situations in which that risk is inconsequential, so that strict scrutiny is unwarranted. For example, speech that is obscene or defamatory can be constitutionally proscribed because the social interest in order and morality outweighs the negligible contribution of those categories of speech to the marketplace of ideas. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>R.A.V.,</i> 505 U.S., at 382-384, 112 S.Ct. 2538. Similarly, content discrimination among various instances of a class of proscribable speech does not pose a threat to the marketplace of ideas when the selected subclass is chosen for the very reason that the entire class can be proscribed. See <i>id.,</i> at 388, 112 S.Ct. 2538 (confirming that governments may choose to ban only the most prurient obscenity). Of particular relevance here, our cases recognize that the risk that content-based distinctions will impermissibly interfere with the marketplace of ideas is sometimes attenuated when the government is acting in a capacity other than as regulator. Accordingly, it is well established that the government can make content-based distinctions when it subsidizes speech. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110935\"><a href=\"/opinion/110935/regan-v-taxation-with-representation-of-wash/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 548-550, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983). And it is also black-letter law that, when the government permits speech on government property that is a nonpublic forum, it can exclude speakers on the basis of their subject matter, so long as the distinctions drawn are viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 799-800, 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985).</p>\n<p>The principle underlying our treatment of those situations is equally applicable to the narrow circumstances of these cases. We do not believe that the voters of Washington impermissibly distorted the marketplace of ideas when they placed a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral limitation on the State's general authorization allowing public-sector unions to acquire and spend the money of government employees. As the Supreme Court of Washington recognized, the voters of Washington sought to protect the integrity of the election process, see 156 Wash.2d, at 563, 130 P.3d, at 361, which the voters evidently thought was being impaired by the infusion of money extracted from nonmembers of unions without their consent. The restriction on the state-bestowed entitlement was thus limited to the state-created harm that the voters sought to remedy. The voters did not have to enact an across-the-board limitation on the use of nonmembers' agency fees by public-sector unions in order to vindicate their more narrow concern with the integrity of the election process. We said in <i>R.A.V.</i> that, when totally proscribable speech is at issue, content-based regulation is permissible so long as \"there is no realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.\" 505 U.S., at 390, 112 S.Ct. 2538. We think the same is true when, as here, an extraordinary and totally repealable authorization <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2382</span> to coerce payment from government employees is at issue. Even if it be thought necessary that the content limitation be reasonable and viewpoint neutral, cf. <i>Cornelius, supra,</i> at 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439, the statute satisfies that requirement. Quite obviously, no suppression of ideas is afoot, since the union remains as free as any other entity to participate in the electoral process with all available funds other than the state-coerced agency fees lacking affirmative permission. Cf. <i>Regan, supra,</i> at 549-550, 103 S.Ct. 1997 (First Amendment does not require the government to enhance a person's ability to speak). In sum, given the unique context of public-sector agency-shop arrangements, the content-based nature of § 760 does not violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>We emphasize an important limitation upon our holding: we uphold § 760 only as applied to public-sector unions such as respondent. Section 760 applies on its face to both public- and private-sector unions in Washington.<sup>[3]</sup> Since private-sector unions collect agency fees through contractually required action taken by private employers rather than by government agencies, Washington's regulation of those private arrangements presents a somewhat different constitutional question.<sup>[4]</sup> We need not answer that question today, however, because at no stage of this litigation has respondent made an overbreadth challenge. See generally <i>Schaumburg v. Citizens for Better Environment,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110188\"><a href=\"/opinion/110188/schaumburg-v-citizens-for-a-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span>, 633-634, 100 S.Ct. 826, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980) (applying overbreadth doctrine).<sup>[5]</sup> Instead, respondent has consistently argued simply that § 760 is unconstitutional as applied to itself. The only purpose for which it has noted the statute's applicability to private-sector unions is to establish that the statute was meant to be a general limitation on electoral speech, and not just a condition on state agencies' authorization of compulsory agency fees. See Brief for Respondent 24, 48. That limited contention, however, is both unconvincing and immaterial. The purpose of the voters of Washington was undoubtedly the general one of protecting the integrity of elections by limiting electoral spending in certain ways. But § 760, though applicable to all unions, served that purpose through very different means depending on the type of union involved: It <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2383</span> <i>conditioned</i> public-sector unions' authorization to coerce fees from government employees at the same time that it <i>regulated</i> private-sector unions' collective-bargaining agreements. The constitutionality of the means chosen with respect to private-sector unions has no bearing on whether § 760 is constitutional as applied to public-sector unions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We hold that it does not violate the First Amendment for a State to require that its public-sector unions receive affirmative authorization from a nonmember before spending that nonmember's agency fees for election-related purposes. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington and remand the cases for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice ALITO join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the Supreme Court of Washington's decision rested entirely on flawed interpretations of this Court's agency-fee cases and our decision in <i>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000). I therefore concur in the Court's judgment, and I join Parts I and II-A and the second paragraph of n. 2 of the Court's opinion. However, I do not join Part II-B, which addresses numerous arguments that respondent Washington Education Association raised for the first time in its briefs before this Court. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>State ex rel. Washington State Public Disclosure Comm'n v. Washington Ed. Assn.,</i> 156 Wash.2d 543, 565, n. 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2622770\"><a href=\"/opinion/2622770/state-ex-rel-public-disclosure-comm-v-wea/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 362, n. 6, (2006) (en banc) (noting that one of these arguments was neither raised nor addressed below). I would not address those arguments until the lower courts have been given the opportunity to address them. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.

See Supp. Brief for Respondent 2-3. As respondent concedes, however, <i>id.,</i> at 3, these cases are not moot. Because petitioners sought money damages for respondent's alleged violation of the prior version of § 760, it still matters whether the Supreme Court of Washington was correct to hold that that version was inconsistent with the First Amendment. Our analysis of whether § 760's affirmative-authorization requirement violates the constitutional rights of respondent is not affected by the amendment, which merely causes that requirement to be applicable less frequently than the state trial court thought.</p>\n<p>[2]  Respondent might have had a point if, as it suggests at times, the statute burdened its ability to spend the dues of its own members. But § 760 restricts solely the \"use [of] agency shop fees paid by an individual who is not a member.\" The only reason respondent's use of its members' dues was burdened is that respondent chose to commingle those dues with nonmembers' agency fees. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 05-1657, pp. 99a, 105a-107a. Respondent's improvident accounting practices do not render § 760 unconstitutional. We note as well that, given current technology, it will not likely be burdensome for any nonmember who wishes to do so to provide affirmative authorization for use of his fees for electoral expenditures.\n</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, the Supreme Court of Washington's invocation of the union's expressive associational rights under <i>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000), was quite misplaced, as respondent basically concedes by not relying upon the case. Section 760 does not compel respondent's acceptance of unwanted members or otherwise make union membership less attractive. See <i>Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145672\"><a href=\"/opinion/145672/rumsfeld-v-forum-for-academic-and-institutional-ri/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 68-69, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006).</p>\n<p>[3]  Under the National Labor Relations Act, it is generally not an unfair labor practice for private-sector employers to enter into agency-shop arrangements, see 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3), but States retain the power under the Act to ban the execution or application of such agreements, see § 164(b).</p>\n<p>[4]  We do not suggest that the answer must be different. We have previously construed the authorization of private-sector agency-shop arrangements in the National Labor Relations Act in a manner that is arguably content based.

It may be argued that the only other targets of the statute's narrow prohibition, private-sector unions, are sufficiently capable of defending their own interests in court that they will not be significantly \"chilled.\"</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 145716, "judges": "Scalia", "local_path": "pdf/2007/06/14/Davenport_v._Washington_Ed._Assn..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2006                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 10, 2007—Decided June 14, 2007*\nThe National Labor Relations Act permits States to regulate their labor\n  relationships with public employees. Many States authorize public-\n  sector unions to negotiate agency-shop agreements that entitle a un\n  ion to levy fees on employees who are not union members but whom\n  the union represents in collective bargaining. However, the First\n  Amendment prohibits public-sector unions from using objecting non\n  members’ fees for ideological purposes not germane to the union’s col\n  lective-bargaining duties, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209,\n  235–236, and such unions must therefore observe various procedural\n  requirements to ensure that an objecting nonmember can keep his\n  fees from being used for such purposes, Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S.\n  292, 304–310. Washington State allows public-sector unions to\n  charge nonmembers an agency fee equivalent to membership dues\n  and to have the employer collect that fee through payroll deductions.\n  An initiative approved by state voters (hereinafter §760) requires a\n  union to obtain the nonmembers’ affirmative authorization before us\n  ing their fees for election-related purposes. Respondent, a public-\n  sector union, sent a “Hudson packet” to all nonmembers twice a year\n  detailing their right to object to the use of fees for nonchargeable ex\n  penditures; respondent held any disputed fees in escrow until the\n  Hudson process was complete. In separate lawsuits, petitioners al\n  leged that respondent had failed to obtain the affirmative authoriza\n  tion required by §760 before spending nonmembers’ agency fees for\n  electoral purposes. In No. 05–1657, the trial court found a §760 vio\n\n——————\n  * Together with No. 05–1657, Washington v.

In No.\n    05–1589, another judge held that §760 provided a private right of ac\n    tion, certified a class of nonmembers, and stayed the proceedings\n    pending interlocutory appeal. The State Supreme Court held that al\n    though a nonmember’s failure to object after receiving the Hudson\n    packet did not satisfy §760’s affirmative-authorization requirement,\n    that requirement violated the First Amendment.\nHeld: It does not violate the First Amendment for a State to require its\n public-sector unions to receive affirmative authorization from a non\n member before spending that nonmember’s agency fees for election-\n related purposes. Pp. 5–13.\n    (a) It is undeniably unusual for a government agency to give a pri\n vate entity the power to tax government employees. The notion that\n §760’s modest limitation upon that extraordinary benefit violates the\n First Amendment is counterintuitive, because it is undisputed that\n Washington could have restricted public-sector agency fees to the\n portion of union dues devoted to collective bargaining, or even elimi\n nated them entirely. Washington’s far less restrictive limitation on\n respondent’s authorization to exact money from government employ\n ees is of no greater constitutional concern. P. 5.\n    (b) The State Supreme Court extended this Court’s agency-fee\n cases well beyond their proper ambit in concluding that those cases,\n having balanced the constitutional rights of unions and nonmembers,\n required a nonmember to shoulder the burden of objecting before a\n union can be barred from spending his fees for purposes impermissi\n ble under Abood. The agency-fee cases did not balance constitutional\n rights in such a manner because unions have no constitutional enti\n tlement to nonmember-employees’ fees. The Court has never sug\n gested that the First Amendment is implicated whenever govern\n ments limit a union’s entitlement to agency fees above and beyond\n what Abood and Hudson require. The constitutional floor for unions’\n collection and spending of agency fees is not also a constitutional ceil\n ing for state-imposed restrictions. Hudson’s admonition that “ ‘dis\n sent is not to be presumed,’ ” 475 U. S., at 306, n. 16, means only that\n it would be improper for a court to enjoin the expenditures of all\n nonmembers’ agency fees when a narrower remedy could satisfy\n statutory or constitutional limitations. Pp. 5–7.\n    (c) Contrary to respondent’s argument, §760 is not unconstitutional\n under this Court’s campaign-finance cases. For First Amendment\n purposes, it is immaterial that §760 restricts a union’s use of funds\n only after they are within the union’s possession. The fees are in the\n union’s possession only because Washington and its union-\n contracting government agencies have compelled their employees to\n pay those fees. The campaign-finance cases deal instead with gov\n                      Cite as: 551 U.

Pp. 7–8.\n     (d) While content-based speech regulations are presumptively inva\n  lid, see, e.g., R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382, strict scrutiny is\n  unwarranted when the risk that the government may drive ideas or\n  viewpoints from the marketplace is attenuated, such as when the\n  government acts in a capacity other than as regulator. Thus, the\n  government can make content-based distinctions when subsidizing\n  speech, see, e.g., Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461\n  U. S. 540, 548–550, and can exclude speakers based on reasonable,\n  viewpoint-neutral subject-matter grounds when permitting speech on\n  government property that is a nonpublic forum, see, e.g., Cornelius v.\n  NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 799–800, 806.\n  The principle underlying those cases is applicable here. Washington\n  voters did not impermissibly distort the marketplace of ideas when\n  they placed a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral limitation on the State’s\n  authorization. They were seeking to protect the integrity of the elec\n  tion process, and their restriction was thus limited to the state-\n  created harm that they sought to remedy. The First Amendment did\n  not compel them to limit public-sector unions’ extraordinary entitle\n  ment to nonmembers’ agency fees more broadly than necessary to\n  vindicate that concern.

We decide whether this restriction, as applied to\npublic-sector labor unions, violates the First Amendment.\n                              I\n  The National Labor Relations Act leaves States free to\nregulate their labor relationships with their public em\nployees. See 49 Stat. 450, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §152(2).\nThe labor laws of many States authorize a union and a\ngovernment employer to enter into what is commonly\nknown as an agency-shop agreement. This arrangement\nentitles the union to levy a fee on employees who are not\nunion members but who are nevertheless represented by\n2          DAVENPORT v. WASHINGTON ED. ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe union in collective bargaining. See, e.g., Lehnert v.\nFerris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 511 (1991). The pri\nmary purpose of such arrangements is to prevent non\nmembers from free-riding on the union’s efforts, sharing\nthe employment benefits obtained by the union’s collective\nbargaining without sharing the costs incurred. See, e.g.,\nMachinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 760–764 (1961). How\never, agency-shop arrangements in the public sector raise\nFirst Amendment concerns because they force individuals\nto contribute money to unions as a condition of govern\nment employment. Thus, in Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed.,\n431 U. S. 209, 235–236 (1977), we held that public-sector\nunions are constitutionally prohibited from using the fees\nof objecting nonmembers for ideological purposes that are\nnot germane to the union’s collective-bargaining duties.\nAnd in Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292, 302, 304–310\n(1986), we set forth various procedural requirements that\npublic-sector unions collecting agency fees must observe in\norder to ensure that an objecting nonmember can prevent\nthe use of his fees for impermissible purposes. Neither\nHudson nor any of our other cases, however, has held that\nthe First Amendment mandates that a public-sector union\nobtain affirmative consent before spending a nonmember’s\nagency fees for purposes not chargeable under Abood.\n   The State of Washington has authorized public-sector\nunions to negotiate agency-shop agreements. Where such\nagreements are in effect, Washington law allows the union\nto charge nonmembers an agency fee equivalent to the full\nmembership dues of the union and to have this fee col\nlected by the employer through payroll deductions. See,\ne.g., Wash. Rev. Code §§41.56.122(1), 41.59.060(2),\n41.59.100 (2006). However, §42.17.760 (hereinafter §760),\nwhich is a provision of the Fair Campaign Practices Act (a\nstate initiative approved by the voters of Washington in\n1992), restricts the union’s ability to spend the agency fees\nthat it collects. Section 760, as it stood when the decision\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nunder review was rendered, provided:\n     “A labor organization may not use agency shop fees\n     paid by an individual who is not a member of the or\n     ganization to make contributions or expenditures\n     to influence an election or to operate a political com\n     mittee, unless affirmatively authorized by the\n     individual.”1\n  Respondent, the exclusive bargaining agent for ap\nproximately 70,000 public educational employees, col\nlected agency fees from nonmembers that it represented in\ncollective bargaining. Consistent with its responsibilities\nunder Abood and Hudson (or so we assume for purposes of\nthese cases), respondent sent a “Hudson packet” to all\nnonmembers twice a year, notifying them of their right to\nobject to paying fees for nonchargeable expenditures, and\ngiving them three options: (1) pay full agency fees by not\nobjecting within 30 days; (2) object to paying for non\nchargeable expenses and receive a rebate as calculated by\nrespondent; or (3) object to paying for nonchargeable\nexpenses and receive a rebate as determined by an arbi\ntrator. Respondent held in escrow any agency fees that\nwere reasonably in dispute until the Hudson process was\ncomplete.\n  In 2001, respondent found itself in Washington state\n——————\n  1 Washington has since amended §760 to codify a narrower interpre\n\ntation of “use” of agency-shop fees than the interpretation adopted\nbelow by the state trial court that passed on that question. See Supp.\nBrief for Respondent 2–3. As respondent concedes, however, id., at 3,\nthese cases are not moot. Because petitioners sought money damages\nfor respondent’s alleged violation of the prior version of §760, it still\nmatters whether the Supreme Court of Washington was correct to hold\nthat that version was inconsistent with the First Amendment. Our\nanalysis of whether §760’s affirmative-authorization requirement\nviolates the constitutional rights of respondent is not affected by the\namendment, which merely causes that requirement to be applicable\nless frequently than the state trial court thought.\n4          DAVENPORT v. WASHINGTON ED. ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts defending, in two separate lawsuits, its expendi\ntures of nonmembers’ agency fees. The first lawsuit was\nbrought by the State of Washington, petitioner in No. 05–\n1657, and the second was brought as a putative class\naction by several nonmembers of the union, petitioners in\nNo. 05–1589. Both suits claimed that respondent’s use of\nagency fees was in violation of §760. Petitioners alleged\nthat respondent had failed to obtain affirmative authoriza\ntion from nonmembers before using their agency fees for\nthe election-related purposes specified in §760. In No. 05–\n1657, after a trial on the merits, the trial court found that\nrespondent had violated §760 and awarded the State both\nmonetary and injunctive relief. In No. 05–1589, a differ\nent trial judge held that §760 provided a private right of\naction, certified the class, and stayed further proceedings\npending interlocutory appeal.\n   After intermediate appellate court proceedings, a di\nvided Supreme Court of Washington held that, although a\nnonmember’s failure to object after receiving respondent’s\n“Hudson packet” did not satisfy §760’s affirmative-\nauthorization requirement as a matter of state law, the\nstatute’s imposition of such a requirement violated the\nFirst Amendment of the Federal Constitution. See State\nex rel. Washington State Public Disclosure Comm’n v.\nWashington Ed. Assn., 156 Wash. 2d 543, 553–571, 130\nP. 3d 352, 356–365 (2006) (en banc). The court reasoned\nthat this Court’s agency-fee jurisprudence established a\nbalance between the First Amendment rights of unions\nand of nonmembers, and that §760 triggered heightened\nFirst Amendment scrutiny because it deviated from that\nbalance by imposing on respondent the burden of confirm\ning that a nonmember does not object to the expenditure\nof his agency fees for electoral purposes. The court also\nheld that §760 interfered with respondent’s expressive\nassociational rights under Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,\n530 U. S. 640 (2000). We granted certiorari. 548 U. S. ___\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(2006).\n                               II\n  The public-sector agency-shop arrangement authorizes a\nunion to levy fees on government employees who do not\nwish to join the union. Regardless of one’s views as to the\ndesirability of agency-shop agreements, see Abood, 431\nU. S., at 225, n. 20, it is undeniably unusual for a govern\nment agency to give a private entity the power, in essence,\nto tax government employees. As applied to agency-shop\nagreements with public-sector unions like respondent,\n§760 is simply a condition on the union’s exercise of this\nextraordinary power, prohibiting expenditure of a non\nmember’s agency fees for election-related purposes unless\nthe nonmember affirmatively consents. The notion that\nthis modest limitation upon an extraordinary benefit\nviolates the First Amendment is, to say the least, counter-\nintuitive. Respondent concedes that Washington could\nhave gone much further, restricting public-sector agency\nfees to the portion of union dues devoted to collective\nbargaining. See Brief for Respondent 46–47. Indeed, it is\nuncontested that it would be constitutional for Washing\nton to eliminate agency fees entirely. See id., at 46 (citing\nLincoln Fed. Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Co., 335\nU. S. 525 (1949)). For the reasons that follow, we conclude\nthat the far less restrictive limitation the voters of Wash\nington placed on respondent’s authorization to exact\nmoney from government employees is of no greater consti\ntutional concern.\n                            A\n  The principal reason the Supreme Court of Washington\nconcluded that §760 was unconstitutional was that it\nbelieved that our agency-fee cases, having balanced the\nconstitutional rights of unions and of nonmembers, dic\ntated that a nonmember must shoulder the burden of\n6          DAVENPORT v. WASHINGTON ED. ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobjecting before a union can be barred from spending his\nfees for purposes impermissible under Abood. See 156\nWash. 2d, at 557–563, 130 P. 3d, at 358–360. The court\nreached this conclusion primarily because our cases have\nrepeatedly invoked the following proposition: “ ‘[D]issent is\nnot to be presumed—it must affirmatively be made known\nto the union by the dissenting employee.’ ” Hudson, 475\nU. S., at 306, n. 16 (quoting Street, 367 U. S., at 774); see\nalso Abood, supra, at 238. The court concluded that §760\ntriggered heightened First Amendment scrutiny because it\ndeviated from this perceived constitutional balance by\nrequiring unions to obtain affirmative consent.\n   This interpretation of our agency-fee cases extends them\nwell beyond their proper ambit. Those cases were not\nbalancing constitutional rights in the manner respondent\nsuggests, for the simple reason that unions have no consti\ntutional entitlement to the fees of nonmember-employees.\nSee Lincoln Fed. Union, supra, at 529–531. We have\nnever suggested that the First Amendment is implicated\nwhenever governments place limitations on a union’s\nentitlement to agency fees above and beyond what Abood\nand Hudson require. To the contrary, we have described\nHudson as “outlin[ing] a minimum set of procedures by\nwhich a [public-sector] union in an agency-shop relation\nship could meet its requirement under Abood.” Keller v.\nState Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 17 (1990) (emphasis added).\nThe mere fact that Washington required more than the\nHudson minimum does not trigger First Amendment\nscrutiny. The constitutional floor for unions’ collection\nand spending of agency fees is not also a constitutional\nceiling for state-imposed restrictions.\n   The Supreme Court of Washington read far too much\ninto our admonition that “dissent is not to be presumed.”\nWe meant only that it would be improper for a court to\nenjoin the expenditure of the agency fees of all employees,\nincluding those who had not objected, when the statutory\n                 Cite as: 551 U.

See, e.g., Street,\nsupra, at 768–770, 772–775 (discussing possible judicial\nremedies for violation of a federal statute that forbade\nunions from spending objecting employees’ fees for politi\ncal purposes); Abood, supra, at 235–236, 237–242 (discuss\ning possible judicial remedies for a state statute that\nunconstitutionally authorized a public-sector union to\nspend objecting nonmembers’ agency fees for ideological\npurposes not germane to collective bargaining); Hudson,\nsupra, at 302, 304–310 (setting forth procedures necessary\nto prevent agency-shop arrangements from violating\nAbood). But, as the dissenting justices below correctly\nrecognized, our repeated affirmation that courts have an\nobligation to interfere with a union’s statutory entitlement\nno more than is necessary to vindicate the rights of non\nmembers does not imply that legislatures (or voters) them\nselves cannot limit the scope of that entitlement.\n                             B\n   Respondent defends the judgment below on a ground\nquite different from the mistaken rationale adopted by the\nSupreme Court of Washington. Its argument begins with\nthe premise that §760 is a limitation on how the union\nmay spend “its” money, citing for that proposition the\nWashington Supreme Court’s description of §760 as en\ncumbering funds that are lawfully within a union’s pos\nsession. Brief for Respondent 21; 156 Wash. 2d, at 568–\n569, 130 P. 3d, at 363–364. Relying on that premise,\nrespondent invokes First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,\n435 U. S. 765 (1978), Austin v. Michigan Chamber of\nCommerce, 494 U. S. 652 (1990), and related campaign-\nfinance cases. It argues that, under the rigorous First\nAmendment scrutiny required by those cases, §760 is\nunconstitutional because it applies to ballot propositions\nand because it does not limit equivalent election-related\n8             DAVENPORT v. WASHINGTON ED. ASSN.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexpenditures by corporations.\n  The Supreme Court of Washington’s description of §760\nnotwithstanding, our campaign-finance cases are not on\npoint. For purposes of the First Amendment, it is entirely\nimmaterial that §760 restricts a union’s use of funds only\nafter those funds are already within the union’s lawful\npossession under Washington law. What matters is that\npublic-sector agency fees are in the union’s possession only\nbecause Washington and its union-contracting govern\nment agencies have compelled their employees to pay\nthose fees. The cases upon which respondent relies deal\nwith governmental restrictions on how a regulated entity\nmay spend money that has come into its possession with\nout the assistance of governmental coercion of its employ\nees. See, e.g., Bellotti, supra, at 767–768; Austin, supra, at\n654–656. As applied to public-sector unions, §760 is not\nfairly described as a restriction on how the union can\nspend “its” money; it is a condition placed upon the union’s\nextraordinary state entitlement to acquire and spend other\npeople’s money.2\n——————\n    2 Respondent  might have had a point if, as it suggests at times, the\nstatute burdened its ability to spend the dues of its own members. But\n§760 restricts solely the “use [of] agency shop fees paid by an individual\nwho is not a member.” The only reason respondent’s use of its mem\nbers’ dues was burdened is that respondent chose to commingle those\ndues with nonmembers’ agency fees. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n05–1657, pp. 99a, 105a–107a. Respondent’s improvident accounting\npractices do not render §760 unconstitutional. We note as well that,\ngiven current technology, it will not likely be burdensome for any\nnonmember who wishes to do so to provide affirmative authorization\nfor use of his fees for electoral expenditures.\n  For similar reasons, the Supreme Court of Washington’s invocation of\nthe union’s expressive associational rights under Boy Scouts of America\nv. Dale, 530 U. S. 640 (2000), was quite misplaced, as respondent\nbasically concedes by not relying upon the case. Section 760 does not\ncompel respondent’s acceptance of unwanted members or otherwise\nmake union membership less attractive. See Rumsfeld v. Forum for\nAcademic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 68–69 (2006).\n                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The question that must be asked, therefore, is whether\n§760 is a constitutional condition on the authorization that\npublic-sector unions enjoy to charge government employ\nees agency fees. Respondent essentially answers that the\nstatute unconstitutionally draws distinctions based on the\ncontent of the union’s speech, requiring affirmative con\nsent only for election-related expenditures while permit\nting expenditures for the rest of the purposes not charge\nable under Abood unless the nonmember objects. The\ncontention that this amounts to unconstitutional content-\nbased discrimination is off the mark.\n  It is true enough that content-based regulations of\nspeech are presumptively invalid. See, e.g., R. A. V. v. St.\nPaul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992) (citing cases). We have\nrecognized, however, that “[t]he rationale of the general\nprohibition . . . is that content discrimination ‘raises the\nspecter that the Government may effectively drive certain\nideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.’ ” Id., at 387\n(quoting Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State\nCrime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 116 (1991)). And we\nhave identified numerous situations in which that risk is\ninconsequential, so that strict scrutiny is unwarranted.\nFor example, speech that is obscene or defamatory can be\nconstitutionally proscribed because the social interest in\norder and morality outweighs the negligible contribution\nof those categories of speech to the marketplace of ideas.\nSee, e.g., R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 382–384. Similarly, con\ntent discrimination among various instances of a class of\nproscribable speech does not pose a threat to the market\nplace of ideas when the selected subclass is chosen for the\nvery reason that the entire class can be proscribed. See\nid., at 388 (confirming that governments may choose to\nban only the most prurient obscenity). Of particular rele\nvance here, our cases recognize that the risk that content-\nbased distinctions will impermissibly interfere with the\nmarketplace of ideas is sometimes attenuated when the\n10         DAVENPORT v. WASHINGTON ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngovernment is acting in a capacity other than as regulator.\nAccordingly, it is well established that the government can\nmake content-based distinctions when it subsidizes\nspeech. See, e.g., Regan v. Taxation With Representation\nof Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 548–550 (1983). And it is also\nblack-letter law that, when the government permits\nspeech on government property that is a nonpublic forum,\nit can exclude speakers on the basis of their subject mat\nter, so long as the distinctions drawn are viewpoint neu\ntral and reasonable in light of the purpose served by the\nforum. See, e.g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed.\nFund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 799–800, 806 (1985).\n   The principle underlying our treatment of those situa\ntions is equally applicable to the narrow circumstances of\nthese cases. We do not believe that the voters of Washing\nton impermissibly distorted the marketplace of ideas when\nthey placed a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral limitation on\nthe State’s general authorization allowing public-sector\nunions to acquire and spend the money of government\nemployees. As the Supreme Court of Washington recog\nnized, the voters of Washington sought to protect the\nintegrity of the election process, see 156 Wash. 2d, at 563,\n130 P. 3d, at 361, which the voters evidently thought was\nbeing impaired by the infusion of money extracted from\nnonmembers of unions without their consent. The restric\ntion on the state-bestowed entitlement was thus limited to\nthe state-created harm that the voters sought to remedy.\nThe voters did not have to enact an across-the-board\nlimitation on the use of nonmembers’ agency fees by pub\nlic-sector unions in order to vindicate their more narrow\nconcern with the integrity of the election process. We said\nin R. A. V. that, when totally proscribable speech is at\nissue, content-based regulation is permissible so long as\n“there is no realistic possibility that official suppression of\nideas is afoot.” 505 U. S., at 390. We think the same is\ntrue when, as here, an extraordinary and totally repeal\n                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nable authorization to coerce payment from government\nemployees is at issue. Even if it be thought necessary that\nthe content limitation be reasonable and viewpoint neu\ntral, cf. Cornelius, supra, at 806, the statute satisfies that\nrequirement. Quite obviously, no suppression of ideas is\nafoot, since the union remains as free as any other entity\nto participate in the electoral process with all available\nfunds other than the state-coerced agency fees lacking\naffirmative permission. Cf. Regan, supra, at 549–550\n(First Amendment does not require the government to\nenhance a person’s ability to speak). In sum, given the\nunique context of public-sector agency-shop arrangements,\nthe content-based nature of §760 does not violate the First\nAmendment.\n  We emphasize an important limitation upon our hold\ning: we uphold §760 only as applied to public-sector unions\nsuch as respondent. Section 760 applies on its face to both\npublic- and private-sector unions in Washington.3 Since\nprivate-sector unions collect agency fees through contrac\ntually required action taken by private employers rather\nthan by government agencies, Washington’s regulation of\nthose private arrangements presents a somewhat different\nconstitutional question.4 We need not answer that ques\n——————\n  3 Under   the National Labor Relations Act, it is generally not an un\nfair labor practice for private-sector employers to enter into agency-\nshop arrangements, see 29 U. S. C. §158(a)(3), but States retain the\npower under the Act to ban the execution or application of such agree\nments, see §164(b).\n   4 We do not suggest that the answer must be different. We have pre\n\nviously construed the authorization of private-sector agency-shop\narrangements in the National Labor Relations Act in a manner that is\narguably content based. See Communications Workers v. Beck, 487\nU. S. 735, 738, 762–763 (1988) (§158(a)(3) authorizes expenditure of\nprivate-sector agency fees over a nonmember’s objection only in fur\ntherance of the union’s obligations as exclusive bargaining representa\ntive); Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S. 435, 450–451 (1984) (expendi\ntures on publications that report about a union’s activities as exclusive\n12            DAVENPORT v. WASHINGTON ED. ASSN.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion today, however, because at no stage of this litigation\nhas respondent made an overbreadth challenge. See\ngenerally Schaumburg v. Citizens for Better Environment,\n444 U. S. 620, 633–634 (1980) (applying overbreadth\ndoctrine).5 Instead, respondent has consistently argued\nsimply that §760 is unconstitutional as applied to itself.\nThe only purpose for which it has noted the statute’s\napplicability to private-sector unions is to establish that\nthe statute was meant to be a general limitation on elec\ntoral speech, and not just a condition on state agencies’\nauthorization of compulsory agency fees. See Brief for\nRespondent 24, 48. That limited contention, however, is\nboth unconvincing and immaterial. The purpose of the\nvoters of Washington was undoubtedly the general one of\nprotecting the integrity of elections by limiting electoral\nspending in certain ways. But §760, though applicable to\nall unions, served that purpose through very different\nmeans depending on the type of union involved: It condi\ntioned public-sector unions’ authorization to coerce fees\nfrom government employees at the same time that it\nregulated private-sector unions’ collective-bargaining\nagreements. The constitutionality of the means chosen\nwith respect to private-sector unions has no bearing on\nwhether §760 is constitutional as applied to public-sector\nunions.\n\n——————\nbargaining representative can be charged to nonmembers over their\nobjection).\n   5 Nor is it clear that the “strong medicine” of the overbreadth doctrine\n\nis even available to challenge a statute such as §760. See Virginia v.\nHicks, 539 U. S. 113, 118–120 (2003) (recognizing that the doctrine’s\nbenefits—eliminating the chilling effect that overbroad laws have on\nnonparties—must be weighed against its costs—blocking perfectly\nconstitutional applications of a law). It may be argued that the only\nother targets of the statute’s narrow prohibition, private-sector unions,\nare sufficiently capable of defending their own interests in court that\nthey will not be significantly “chilled.”\n                 Cite as: 551 U.
