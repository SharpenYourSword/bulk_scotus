Appellee, Brad Hanson, was employed in the Senator's Ft. Snelling office prior to his discharge by the Senator, which he alleges occurred on July 3, 2002. Hanson brought this action for damages against appellant, the Senator's office (Office), invoking the District Court's jurisdiction under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (Act), 109 Stat. 3, as amended, 2 U.S.C. § 1301 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), and alleging violations of three other federal statutes.<sup>[1]</sup> The District Court denied appellant's motion to dismiss the complaint based on a claim of immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution.<sup>[2]</sup> The Court of Appeals affirmed, <i>Fields v. Office of Eddie Bernice Johnson, Employing Office, United States Congress,</i> 459 F.3d 1 (C.A.D.C. 2006), the Office invoked our appellate jurisdiction under § 412 of the Act, 2 U.S.C. § 1412, and we postponed consideration of jurisdiction pending hearing the case on the merits, 549 U.S. ___, ___ S.Ct. ___, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 75 USLW 3266 (2007). Because we do not have jurisdiction under § 412, we dismiss the appeal. Treating appellant's jurisdictional statement as a petition for a writ of certiorari, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p>Under § 412 of the Act, direct review in this Court is available \"from any interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of a court upon the constitutionality of any provision\" of the statute.<sup>[3]</sup> Neither the order of the District Court denying appellant's motion to dismiss nor the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming that order can fairly be characterized as a ruling \"upon the constitutionality\" of any provision of the Act. The District Court's minute order denying the motion to dismiss does not state any grounds for decision. App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a. Both parties agree that that order cannot, therefore, be characterized as a constitutional holding.<sup>[4]</sup> The Court of Appeals' opinion rejects appellant's argument that forcing Senator Dayton to defend against the allegations in this case would necessarily <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2021</span> contravene the Speech or Debate Clause, although it leaves open the possibility that the Speech or Debate Clause may limit the scope of the proceedings in some respects. Neither of those holdings qualifies as a ruling on the validity of the Act itself.</p>\n<p>The Office argues that the Court of Appeals' holding amounts to a ruling that the Act is constitutional \"as applied.\" According to the Office, an \"as applied\" constitutional holding of that sort satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of § 412. We find this reading difficult to reconcile with the statutory scheme. Section 413 of the Act provides that</p>\n<blockquote>\"[t]he authorization to bring judicial proceedings under [the Act] shall not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity for any other purpose, or of the privileges of any Senator or Member of the House of Representatives under [the Speech or Debate Clause] of the Constitution.\" 2 U.S.C. § 1413.</blockquote>\n<p>This provision demonstrates that Congress did not intend the Act to be interpreted to permit suits that would otherwise be prohibited under the Speech or Debate Clause. Consequently, a court's determination that jurisdiction attaches despite a claim of Speech or Debate Clause immunity is best read as a ruling on the scope of the Act, not its constitutionality. This reading is faithful, moreover, to our established practice of interpreting statutes to avoid constitutional difficulties.<sup>[5]</sup> See <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 381-382, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005).</p>\n<p>The provision for appellate review is best understood as responding to a congressional concern that if a provision of the statute is declared invalid there is an interest in prompt adjudication by this Court. To extend that review to instances in which the statute itself has not been called into question, giving litigants under the Act preference over litigants in other cases, does not accord with that rationale. This is also consistent with our cases holding that \"statutes authorizing appeals are to be strictly construed.\" <i>Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,</i> 460 U.S. 37, 43, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983); see also <i>Fornaris v.

Having abandoned its decision in <i>Browning v. Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives,</i> 789 F.2d 923 (1986), the D.C.

Argued April 24, 2007—Decided May 21, 2007 \n\nAfter his discharge from employment with former Senator Dayton, ap\n  pellee Hanson sued appellant, the Senator’s office (Office), invoking\n  the District Court’s jurisdiction under the Congressional Accountabil\n  ity Act of 1995 (Act). The court denied a motion to dismiss based on a\n  claim of immunity under the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause,\n  and the D. C. Circuit affirmed. The Office then sought to appeal un\n  der §412 of the Act, which authorizes review in this Court of “any . . .\n  judgment . . . upon the constitutionality of any provision” of the Act.\nHeld: This Court lacks jurisdiction under §412 because neither the\n dismissal denial nor the D. C. Circuit’s affirmance can fairly be char\n acterized as a ruling “upon the constitutionality” of any Act provision.\n The District Court’s order does not state any grounds for decision, so\n it cannot be characterized as a constitutional holding.

The Office’s argument that the appeals court’s holding amounts\n to a ruling that the Act is constitutional “as applied” cannot be recon\n ciled with §413’s declaration that the Act’s authorization to sue “shall\n not constitute a waiver of . . . the privileges of any Senator . . . under\n [the Clause.]” Nor do any special circumstances justify exercise of\n this Court’s discretionary certiorari jurisdiction, the D.

Both\nparties agree that that order cannot, therefore, be charac\nterized as a constitutional holding.4 The Court of Appeals’\n——————\n    3 Section\n            412 reads in full:\n  “Expedited review of certain appeals\n  “(a) In general\n  “An appeal may be taken directly to the Supreme Court of the United\nStates from any interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of a\ncourt upon the constitutionality of any provision of this chapter.\n  “(b) Jurisdiction\n  “The Supreme Court shall, if it has not previously ruled on the\nquestion, accept jurisdiction over the appeal referred to in subsection\n(a) of this section, advance the appeal on the docket, and expedite the\nappeal to the greatest extent possible.” 2 U. S. C. §1412.\n  4 Had the District Court’s order qualified as a ruling “upon the consti\n\ntutionality” of a provision of the Act, the Court of Appeals’ jurisdiction\nto hear the appeal would have been called into serious doubt. See 28\nU. S. C. §1291 (granting jurisdiction to the courts of appeals from final\ndecisions of federal district courts “except where a direct review may be\n                     Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nopinion rejects appellant’s argument that forcing Senator\nDayton to defend against the allegations in this case\nwould necessarily contravene the Speech or Debate\nClause, although it leaves open the possibility that the\nSpeech or Debate Clause may limit the scope of the pro\nceedings in some respects. Neither of those holdings\nqualifies as a ruling on the validity of the Act itself.\n   The Office argues that the Court of Appeals’ holding\namounts to a ruling that the Act is constitutional “as\napplied.” According to the Office, an “as applied” constitu\ntional holding of that sort satisfies the jurisdictional re\nquirements of §412. We find this reading difficult to rec\noncile with the statutory scheme. Section 413 of the Act\nprovides that\n     “[t]he authorization to bring judicial proceedings un\n     der [the Act] shall not constitute a waiver of sovereign\n     immunity for any other purpose, or of the privileges of\n     any Senator or Member of the House of Representa\n     tives under [the Speech or Debate Clause] of the Con\n     stitution.” 2 U. S. C. §1413.\nThis provision demonstrates that Congress did not intend\nthe Act to be interpreted to permit suits that would other\nwise be prohibited under the Speech or Debate Clause.\nConsequently, a court’s determination that jurisdiction\nattaches despite a claim of Speech or Debate Clause im\nmunity is best read as a ruling on the scope of the Act, not\nits constitutionality. This reading is faithful, moreover, to\nour established practice of interpreting statutes to avoid\nconstitutional difficulties.5 See Clark v. Martinez, 543\nU. S. 371, 381–382 (2005). \n\n—————— \n\nhad in the Supreme Court”). \n\n  5 Nor does this reading make a dead letter out of §412’s limitation of\n\nappellate review in this Court to constitutional rulings. The possibility\nremains that provisions of the Act could be challenged on constitutional\ngrounds unrelated to the Speech or Debate Clause.\n4        OFFICE OF SEN. MARK DAYTON v. HANSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The provision for appellate review is best understood as\nresponding to a congressional concern that if a provision of\nthe statute is declared invalid there is an interest in\nprompt adjudication by this Court. To extend that review\nto instances in which the statute itself has not been called\ninto question, giving litigants under the Act preference\nover litigants in other cases, does not accord with that\nrationale. This is also consistent with our cases holding\nthat “statutes authorizing appeals are to be strictly con\nstrued.” Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators’ Assn.,\n460 U. S. 37, 43 (1983); see also Fornaris v. Ridge Tool\nCo., 400 U. S. 41, 42, n. 1 (1970) (per curiam).\n   Nor are there special circumstances that justify the\nexercise of our discretionary certiorari jurisdiction to\nreview the Court of Appeals’ affirmance of the interlocu\ntory order entered by the District Court. Having aban\ndoned its decision in Browning v. Clerk, U. S. House of\nRepresentatives, 789 F. 2d 923 (1986), the D. C. Circuit is\nno longer in obvious conflict with any other Circuit on the\napplication of the Speech or Debate Clause to suits chal\nlenging the personnel decisions of Members of Congress.\nCompare 459 F. 3d 1 (case below), with Bastien v. Office of\nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, 390 F. 3d 1301 (CA10\n2004).\n   Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdic\ntion and certiorari is denied. We express no opinion on the\nmerits, nor do we decide whether this action became moot\nupon the expiration of Senator Dayton’s term in office.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145732/", "sha1": "f1aba207c2575c8ce6a2172ff1022bb206be85c8", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2006-043", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:06:58"}
