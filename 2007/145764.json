The question here is whether the term \"theft offense\" in this federal statute includes the crime of <i>\"aiding and abetting\"</i> a theft offense. We hold that it does. And we vacate a Ninth Circuit determination to the contrary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 <i>et seq.,</i> (2000 ed. and Supp.IV), lists a set of offenses, conviction for any one of which subjects certain aliens to removal from the United States, § 1227(a). In determining whether a conviction (say, a conviction for violating a state criminal law that forbids the taking of property without permission) falls within the scope of a listed offense (<i>e.g.,</i> \"theft offense\"), the lower courts uniformly have applied the approach this Court set forth in <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <i>E.g., </i><i>Soliman v. Gonzales,</i> 419 F.3d 276, 284 (C.A.4 2005); <i>Abimbola v. Ashcroft,</i> 378 F.3d 173, 176-177 (C.A.2 2004); <i>Huerta-Guevara v. Ashcroft,</i> 321 F.3d 883, 886-888 (C.A.9 2003); <i>Hernandez-Mancilla v. INS,</i> 246 F.3d 1002, 1008-1009 (C.A.7 2001).</p>\n<p><i>Taylor</i> concerned offenses listed in the federal Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). That Act mandates a lengthy prison sentence for offenders with previous convictions for, <i>e.g.,</i> a \"violent felony\"; and the Act sets forth certain specific crimes, <i>e.g.,</i> \"burglary,\" included in this category. The Court, in <i>Taylor,</i> considered whether a conviction for violating a state statute criminalizing certain burglary-like behavior fell within the listed federal term \"burglary.\" 495 U.S., at 589, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p>The Court held that Congress meant its listed term \"burglary\" to refer to a specific crime, <i>i.e.,</i> \"`burglary'\" in <i>\"the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\" Id.,</i> at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (emphasis added). The Court also held that a state conviction qualifies as a burglary conviction, \"regardless of the \"exact [state] definition or label\" as long as it has the \"basic elements\" of \"generic\" burglary, namely, \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The Court added that, when a sentencing court seeks to determine whether a particular prior conviction was for a generic burglary offense, it should normally look not to the facts of the particular prior case, but rather to the state statute defining the crime of conviction. <i>Id.,</i> at 599-600, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p>The Court further noted that a \"few States' burglary statutes\" \"define burglary more broadly\" to include both a (genetically defined) listed crime and also one or more nonlisted crimes. <i>Id.,</i> at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. For example, Massachusetts defines \"burglary\" as including not only breaking into \"`a building'\" but also breaking into a \"vehicle\" (which falls outside the generic definition of \"burglary,\" for a car is not a \"`building or structure' \"). See <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 16, 17, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); see also <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (discussing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*819</span> Missouri burglary statutes). In such cases the Court's \"categorical approach\" permits the sentencing court \"to go beyond the mere fact of conviction\" in order to determine whether the earlier \"jury was actually required to find all the elements of generic burglary.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; see also <i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> 461 F.3d 45, 54 (C.A.1 2006) (observing that some courts refer to this step of the <i>Taylor</i> inquiry as a \"modified categorical approach\"). \"For example,\" the sentencing court might examine \"the indictment or information and jury instructions\" in the earlier case. 495 U.S., at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In <i>Shepard,</i> we added that, in a nonjury case, the sentencing court might examine not only the \"charging document\" but also \"the terms of a plea agreement,\" the \"transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant,\" or \"some comparable judicial record\" of information about the \"factual basis for the plea.\" 544 U.S., at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The case before us concerns the application of the framework just set forth to Luis Duenas-Alvarez, the respondent here, a permanent resident alien of the United States. In 2002, Duenas-Alvarez was convicted of violating Cal. Veh.Code Ann. § 10851(a) (West 2000). That section states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Any person who drives or takes a vehicle not his or her own, without the consent of the owner thereof, and with intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or possession of the vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the vehicle, or <i>any person who is a party or an accessory to or an accomplice in</i> the driving or unauthorized taking or stealing, <i>is guilty</i> of a public offense.\" (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p>After Duenas-Alvarez was convicted, the Federal Government, claiming that the conviction was for a generic theft offense, began removal proceedings. A Federal Immigration Judge, agreeing with the Government that the California offense is \"a theft offense . . . for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year,\" found Duenas-Alvarez removable. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G) (footnote omitted); § 1227(a)(2)(A). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed. Duenas-Alvarez sought review of the BIA's decision in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p>While respondent's petition for court review was pending, the Ninth Circuit, in <i>Penuliar v. Ashcroft,</i> 395 F.3d 1037 (2005), held that the relevant California Vehicle Code provision, § 10851(a), sweeps more broadly than generic theft. See <i>id.,</i> at 1044-1045. In particular, the court said that generic theft has as an element the taking or control of others' property. But, the court added, the California statutory phrase \"`[who] is a party or an accessory. . . or an accomplice'\" would permit conviction \"for aiding and abetting a theft.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1044 (emphasis deleted). And the court believed that one might \"aid\" or \"abet\" a theft without taking or controlling property. <i>Id.,</i> at 1044-1045 (citing <i>Martinez-Perez v. Ashcroft,</i> 393 F.3d 1018 (C.A.9 2004), withdrawn and amended, 417 F.3d 1022 (2005)). Hence, in the Court of Appeals' view, the provision must cover some generically defined \"theft\" crimes and also some other crimes (aiding and abetting crimes) that, because they are not generically defined \"theft\" crimes, fall outside the scope of the term \"theft\" in the immigration statute. 395 F.3d, at 1044-1045.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit subsequently heard Duenas-Alvarez's petition for review and summarily remanded the case to the agency <span class=\"star-pagination\">*820</span> for further proceedings in light of <i>Penuliar.</i> 176 Fed.Appx. 820 (2006). We granted the Government's petition for certiorari in order to consider the legal validity of the Ninth Circuit's holding set forth in <i>Penuliar</i> and applied here, namely, the holding that \"aiding and abetting\" a theft is not itself a crime that falls within the generic definition of theft. We conclude that the Ninth Circuit erred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit, like other Circuits and the BIA, accepted as a generic definition of theft, the \"taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.\" <i>Penuliar v. Gonzales,</i> 435 F.3d 961, 969 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). See <i>Abimbola,</i> 378 F.3d, at 176 (analyzing the BIA's definition and citing cases from three other Circuits, including the Ninth Circuit, approving that definition). The question before us is whether one who aids or abets a theft falls, like a principal, within the scope of this generic definition. We conclude that he does.</p>\n<p>The common law divided participants in a felony into four basic categories: (1) <i>first-degree principals,</i> those who actually committed the crime in question; (2) <i>second-degree principals,</i> aiders and abettors present at the scene of the crime; (3) <i>accessories before the fact,</i> aiders and abettors who helped the principal before the basic criminal event took place; and (4) <i>accessories after the fact,</i> persons who helped the principal after the basic criminal event took place. See <i>Standefer v. United States,</i> 447 U.S. 10, 15, 100 S.Ct. 1999, 64 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980). In the course of the 20th century, however, American jurisdictions eliminated the distinction among the first three categories. <i>Id.,</i> at 16-19, 100 S.Ct. 1999; <i>Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States,</i> 336 U.S. 613, 618, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949).</p>\n<p>Indeed, every jurisdictionall States and the Federal Governmenthas \"expressly abrogated the distinction\" among principals and aiders and abettors who fall into the second and third categories. 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 13.1(e), p. 333 (2d ed.2003) (LaFave). The Solicitor General has presented us with a comprehensive account of the law of all States and federal jurisdictions as well. And we have verified that these jurisdictions treat similarly principals and aiders and abettors who fall into the second or third common-law category. See Appendix A, <i>infra.</i> Since criminal law now uniformly treats those who fall into the first three categories alike, \"the generic sense in which\" the term \"theft\" \"is now used in the criminal codes of most States,\" <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, covers such \"aiders and abettors\" as well as principals. And the criminal activities of these aiders and abettors of a generic theft must themselves fall within the scope of the term \"theft\" in the federal statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Duenas-Alvarez does not defend the Ninth Circuit's position. He agrees with the Government that generically speaking the law treats aiders and abettors during and before the crime the same way it treats principals; and that the immigration statute must then treat them similarly as well. Instead, Duenas-Alvarez argues that the California Vehicle Code provision in other ways reaches beyond generic theft to cover certain nongeneric crimes.</p>\n<p>Duenas-Alvarez points out that California defines \"aiding and abetting\" such that an aider and abettor is criminally responsible <span class=\"star-pagination\">*821</span> not only for the crime he intends, but also for any crime that \"naturally and probably\" results from his intended crime. <i>People v. Durham,</i> 70 Cal.2d 171, 181, 74 Cal.Rptr. 262, 449 P.2d 198, 204 (1969) (\"`aider and abettor . . . liable for the natural and reasonable or probable consequences of any act that he knowingly aided or encouraged'\" (quoting <i>People v. Villa,</i> 156 Cal.App.2d 128, 134, 318 P.2d 828 (1957); emphasis deleted)). This fact alone does not show that the statute covers a nongeneric theft crime, for relatively few jurisdictions (only 10 in Duenas-Alvarez's own view) have expressly rejected the \"natural and probable consequences\" doctrine. See Brief for Respondent 21-22; Appendix B, <i>infra.</i> Moreover, many States and the Federal Government apply some form or variation of that doctrine, or permit jury inferences of intent in circumstances similar to those in which California has applied the doctrine, as explained below. See Appendix C, <i>infra.</i> To succeed, Duenas-Alvarez must show something <i>special</i> about California's version of the doctrinefor example, that California in applying it criminalizes conduct that most other States would not consider \"theft.\"</p>\n<p>Duenas-Alvarez attempts to make just such a showing. In particular, he says that California's doctrine, unlike that of most other States, makes a defendant criminally liable for conduct that the defendant did not intend, not even as a known or almost certain byproduct of the defendant's intentional acts. See 1 La-Fave § 5.2(a), at 341 (person intends that which he knows \"is practically certain to follow from his conduct\"). At oral argument, Duenas-Alvarez's counsel suggested that California's doctrine, for example, might hold an individual who wrongly bought liquor for an underage drinker criminally responsible for that young drinker's later (unforeseen) reckless driving. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44. And Duenas-Alvarez refers to several California cases in order to prove his point. See Brief for Respondent 19.</p>\n<p>We have reviewed those cases, however, and we cannot agree that they show that California's law is somehow special. In the first case, <i>People v. Nguyen,</i> 21 Cal. App.4th 518, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 323 (1993), the Third Appellate District in California upheld the jury conviction of individuals who had aided several robberies at houses of prostitution, for aiding and abetting a sexual assault used by one of the individuals to convince a proprietor, by frightening her, to give up property. <i>Id.,</i> at 528, 533-534, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 329, 333. The court, in upholding the verdict, wrote that \"knowledge of another's criminal purpose is not sufficient for aiding and abetting; the defendant <i>must also share that purpose or intend to commit, encourage, or facilitate the commission of the crime.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 530, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 330 (emphasis added). The court added that \"[w]hile the defendants participated in the criminal endeavor the foreseeability of sexual assault went from possible or likely <i>to certain,</i> yet <i>defendants continued to lend their aid and assistance</i> to the endeavor.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 534, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 333 (emphasis added). The court said that the jury could find that the defendants'</p>\n<blockquote>\"continuing participation in the criminal endeavor aided the perpetrators by providing the control and security they needed to tarry long enough to commit the sexual offense, by helping to convince the victim that resistance would be useless, and by dissuading the victim's employee from any notion she may have formed of going to the victim's assistance.\"</blockquote>\n<p>And the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Under these circumstances it will not do for defendants to assert that they <span class=\"star-pagination\">*822</span> were concerned only with robbery and bear no responsibility for the sexual assault.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 533-534, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 333.</blockquote>\n<p><i>People v. Simpson,</i> 66 Cal.App.2d 319, 152 P.2d 339 (1944), affirmed a kidnaping and robbery conviction on an aiding and abetting theory. <i>Id.,</i> at 322, 152 P.2d 339. Although the defendant argued to the appeals court that she and her compatriots had not planned to kidnap the robbery victim, the record showed that she had brought the gun used to intimidate the victim while he was tied up and placed in a car, in which she and her corobbers rode with the victim to another location while they robbed him. <i>Id.,</i> at 322-323, 152 P.2d 339. As in <i>Nguyen,</i> the court, noting that kidnaping was the <i>means</i> by which the robbery was committed, found that the defendant had the requisite \"motive,\" or intent to commit the kidnaping. 66 Cal. App.2d, at 326, 152 P.2d 339.</p>\n<p><i>People v. Montes,</i> 74 Cal.App.4th 1050, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 482 (1999), affirmed an attempted murder conviction where a confederate of the defendant shot the victim after the defendant committed armed assault, simple assault, and breach of the peace. <i>Id.,</i> at 1055, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 485. The court found that the conduct for which the appellant was charged with assault and breach of the peace was a \"confrontation. . . punctuated by threats and weaponry\" \"in the context of an ongoing rivalry between . . . two gangs [that] acted violently toward each other.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The court reasoned that the escalating violence, resulting in someone being shot, was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's intended act of participating in the gang confrontation. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Although the court in <i>Montes</i> applied a more expansive concept of \"motive\" or \"intent\" than did the courts in <i>Nguyen</i> and <i>Simpson,</i> we cannot say that those concepts as used in any of these cases extend significantly beyond the concept as set forth in the cases of other States. See Appendix C, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>Moreover, in our view, to find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute's language. It requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime. To show that realistic probability, an offender, of course, may show that the statute was so applied in his own case. But he must at least point to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special (nongeneric) manner for which he argues.</p>\n<p>Because Duenas-Alvarez makes no such showing here, we cannot find that California's statute, through the California courts' application of a \"natural and probable consequences\" doctrine, creates a subspecies of the Vehicle Code section crime that falls outside the generic definition of \"theft.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Duenas-Alvarez makes two additional claims. First, he argues that § 10851 holds liable accessories after the fact; and to prove that an individual was an accessory after the fact does not require the Government to show that the individual committed a theft. Second, Duenas-Alvarez argues that § 10851 applies, not only to auto theft, but also to joyriding, which he argues involves so limited a deprivation of the use of a car that it falls outside the generic \"theft\" definition. See <i>Van Vechten v. American Eagle Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 239 N.Y. 303, 146 N.E. 432 (1925) (Cardozo, J.) (citing cases for proposition that a very temporary use is not theft).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*823</span> We shall not consider these claims. The question that we agreed to decide is whether \"`theft offense'\" in the federal statute \"includes aiding and abetting the commission of the offense.\" See Brief for Petitioner I. Context makes clear that \"aiding and abetting\" in this question referred to the use of that term in <i>Penuliar, i.e.,</i> to the second and third common-law categories (principal in the second degree, accessory before the fact), see <i>supra,</i> at 820, see also Brief for Petitioner 13, and not to \"accessory after the fact.\" Thus neither this claim nor the \"joyriding\" claim falls within the terms of the question presented. Regardless, the lower court did not consider the claims, and we decline to reach them in the first instance. See <i>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith,</i> 525 U.S. 459, 469-470, 119 S.Ct. 924, 142 L.Ed.2d 929 (1999); <i>Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc.,</i> 525 U.S. 249, 253-254, 119 S.Ct. 685, 142 L.Ed.2d 648 (1999) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>United States v. Bestfoods,</i> 524 U.S. 51, 72-73, 118 S.Ct. 1876, 141 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998).</p>\n<p>For these reasons we vacate the Ninth Circuit's judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIXES TO OPINION OF THE COURT</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Ala.Code §§ 13A-2-20, 13A-2-23 (2006); Alaska Stat. §§ 11.16.100, 11.16.110 (2004); Ariz.Rev.Stat.

I am not prepared to disagree with anything said in Part III-A, but I believe we would be well advised to withhold comment on issues of California law until after they have been addressed by the Court of Appeals in the first instance. Limiting our decision to the question we granted certiorari to answer, though not a rigid rule, is generally prudent. Doing so seems particularly wise whenever reaching beyond the question presented requires analysis of disputed issues of state law. Because circuit judges are generally more familiar with the law of the States within their respective jurisdictions than we are, we have often followed the sound practice of deferring to the courts of appeals on such matters even when we did not necessarily share their views. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Haring v. Prosise,</i> 462 U.S. 306, 314, 103 S.Ct. 2368, 76 L.Ed.2d 595 (1983); <i>Bishop v.

The question here is whether the term \"theft offense\" in this federal statute includes the crime of <i>\"aiding and abetting\"</i> a theft offense. We hold that it does. And we vacate a Ninth Circuit determination to the contrary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 <i>et seq.,</i> (2000 ed. and Supp.IV), lists a set of offenses, conviction for any one of which subjects certain aliens to removal from the United States, § 1227(a). In determining whether a conviction (say, a conviction for violating a state criminal law that forbids the taking of property without permission) falls within the scope of a listed offense (<i>e.g.,</i> \"theft offense\"), the lower courts uniformly have applied the approach this Court set forth in <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <i>E.g., </i><i>Soliman v.

That Act mandates a lengthy prison sentence for offenders with previous convictions for, <i>e.g.,</i> a \"violent felony\"; and the Act sets forth certain specific crimes, <i>e.g.,</i> \"burglary,\" included in this category. The Court, in <i>Taylor,</i> considered whether a conviction for violating a state statute criminalizing certain burglary-like behavior fell within the listed federal term \"burglary.\" 495 U.S., at 589, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p>The Court held that Congress meant its listed term \"burglary\" to refer to a specific crime, <i>i.e.,</i> \"`burglary'\" in <i>\"the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\" Id.,</i> at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (emphasis added). The Court also held that a state conviction qualifies as a burglary conviction, \"regardless of the \"exact [state] definition or label\" as long as it has the \"basic elements\" of \"generic\" burglary, namely, \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The Court added that, when a sentencing court seeks to determine whether a particular prior conviction was for a generic burglary offense, it should normally look not to the facts of the particular prior case, but rather to the state statute defining the crime of conviction. <i>Id.,</i> at 599-600, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p>The Court further noted that a \"few States' burglary statutes\" \"define burglary more broadly\" to include both a (genetically defined) listed crime and also one or more nonlisted crimes. <i>Id.,</i> at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. For example, Massachusetts defines \"burglary\" as including not only breaking into \"`a building'\" but also breaking into a \"vehicle\" (which falls outside the generic definition of \"burglary,\" for a car is not a \"`building or structure' \"). See <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16, 17, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); see also <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (discussing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*819</span> Missouri burglary statutes). In such cases the Court's \"categorical approach\" permits the sentencing court \"to go beyond the mere fact of conviction\" in order to determine whether the earlier \"jury was actually required to find all the elements of generic burglary.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; see also <i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202370\"><a href=\"/opinion/202370/conteh-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 54 (C.A.1 2006) (observing that some courts refer to this step of the <i>Taylor</i> inquiry as a \"modified categorical approach\"). \"For example,\" the sentencing court might examine \"the indictment or information and jury instructions\" in the earlier case. 495 U.S., at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In <i>Shepard,</i> we added that, in a nonjury case, the sentencing court might examine not only the \"charging document\" but also \"the terms of a plea agreement,\" the \"transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant,\" or \"some comparable judicial record\" of information about the \"factual basis for the plea.\" 544 U.S., at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The case before us concerns the application of the framework just set forth to Luis Duenas-Alvarez, the respondent here, a permanent resident alien of the United States. In 2002, Duenas-Alvarez was convicted of violating Cal. Veh.Code Ann. § 10851(a) (West 2000). That section states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Any person who drives or takes a vehicle not his or her own, without the consent of the owner thereof, and with intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or possession of the vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the vehicle, or <i>any person who is a party or an accessory to or an accomplice in</i> the driving or unauthorized taking or stealing, <i>is guilty</i> of a public offense.\" (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p>After Duenas-Alvarez was convicted, the Federal Government, claiming that the conviction was for a generic theft offense, began removal proceedings. A Federal Immigration Judge, agreeing with the Government that the California offense is \"a theft offense . . . for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year,\" found Duenas-Alvarez removable. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G) (footnote omitted); § 1227(a)(2)(A). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed. Duenas-Alvarez sought review of the BIA's decision in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p>While respondent's petition for court review was pending, the Ninth Circuit, in <i>Penuliar v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789015\"><a href=\"/opinion/789015/nopring-paulino-penuliar-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1037</span></a></span> (2005), held that the relevant California Vehicle Code provision, § 10851(a), sweeps more broadly than generic theft. See <i>id.,</i> at 1044-1045. In particular, the court said that generic theft has as an element the taking or control of others' property. But, the court added, the California statutory phrase \"`[who] is a party or an accessory. . . or an accomplice'\" would permit conviction \"for aiding and abetting a theft.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1044 (emphasis deleted). And the court believed that one might \"aid\" or \"abet\" a theft without taking or controlling property. <i>Id.,</i> at 1044-1045 (citing <i>Martinez-Perez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788799\"><a href=\"/opinion/788799/sergio-martinez-perez-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-gen/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (C.A.9 2004), withdrawn and amended, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791332\"><a href=\"/opinion/791332/sergio-martinez-perez-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span> (2005)). Hence, in the Court of Appeals' view, the provision must cover some generically defined \"theft\" crimes and also some other crimes (aiding and abetting crimes) that, because they are not generically defined \"theft\" crimes, fall outside the scope of the term \"theft\" in the immigration statute. 395 F.3d, at 1044-1045.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit subsequently heard Duenas-Alvarez's petition for review and summarily remanded the case to the agency <span class=\"star-pagination\">*820</span> for further proceedings in light of <i>Penuliar.</i> 176 Fed.Appx. 820 (2006). We granted the Government's petition for certiorari in order to consider the legal validity of the Ninth Circuit's holding set forth in <i>Penuliar</i> and applied here, namely, the holding that \"aiding and abetting\" a theft is not itself a crime that falls within the generic definition of theft. We conclude that the Ninth Circuit erred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit, like other Circuits and the BIA, accepted as a generic definition of theft, the \"taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.\" <i>Penuliar v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793100\"><a href=\"/opinion/793100/nopring-paulino-penuliar-v-alberto-r-gonzales-atto/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></a></span>, 969 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). See <i>Abimbola,</i> 378 F.3d, at 176 (analyzing the BIA's definition and citing cases from three other Circuits, including the Ninth Circuit, approving that definition). The question before us is whether one who aids or abets a theft falls, like a principal, within the scope of this generic definition. We conclude that he does.</p>\n<p>The common law divided participants in a felony into four basic categories: (1) <i>first-degree principals,</i> those who actually committed the crime in question; (2) <i>second-degree principals,</i> aiders and abettors present at the scene of the crime; (3) <i>accessories before the fact,</i> aiders and abettors who helped the principal before the basic criminal event took place; and (4) <i>accessories after the fact,</i> persons who helped the principal after the basic criminal event took place. See <i>Standefer v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110289\"><a href=\"/opinion/110289/standefer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 15, 100 S.Ct. 1999, 64 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980). In the course of the 20th century, however, American jurisdictions eliminated the distinction among the first three categories. <i>Id.,</i> at 16-19, 100 S.Ct. 1999; <i>Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104655\"><a href=\"/opinion/104655/nye-nissen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span>, 618, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949).</p>\n<p>Indeed, every jurisdictionall States and the Federal Governmenthas \"expressly abrogated the distinction\" among principals and aiders and abettors who fall into the second and third categories. 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 13.1(e), p. 333 (2d ed.2003) (LaFave). The Solicitor General has presented us with a comprehensive account of the law of all States and federal jurisdictions as well. And we have verified that these jurisdictions treat similarly principals and aiders and abettors who fall into the second or third common-law category. See Appendix A, <i>infra.</i> Since criminal law now uniformly treats those who fall into the first three categories alike, \"the generic sense in which\" the term \"theft\" \"is now used in the criminal codes of most States,\" <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, covers such \"aiders and abettors\" as well as principals. And the criminal activities of these aiders and abettors of a generic theft must themselves fall within the scope of the term \"theft\" in the federal statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Duenas-Alvarez does not defend the Ninth Circuit's position. He agrees with the Government that generically speaking the law treats aiders and abettors during and before the crime the same way it treats principals; and that the immigration statute must then treat them similarly as well. Instead, Duenas-Alvarez argues that the California Vehicle Code provision in other ways reaches beyond generic theft to cover certain nongeneric crimes.</p>\n<p>Duenas-Alvarez points out that California defines \"aiding and abetting\" such that an aider and abettor is criminally responsible <span class=\"star-pagination\">*821</span> not only for the crime he intends, but also for any crime that \"naturally and probably\" results from his intended crime. <i>People v. Durham,</i> 70 Cal.2d 171, 181, 74 Cal.Rptr. 262, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1345383\"><a href=\"/opinion/1345383/people-v-durham/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span>, 204 (1969) (\"`aider and abettor . . . liable for the natural and reasonable or probable consequences of any act that he knowingly aided or encouraged'\" (quoting <i>People v. Villa,</i> 156 Cal.App.2d 128, 134, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1221249\"><a href=\"/opinion/1221249/people-v-villa/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span> (1957); emphasis deleted)). This fact alone does not show that the statute covers a nongeneric theft crime, for relatively few jurisdictions (only 10 in Duenas-Alvarez's own view) have expressly rejected the \"natural and probable consequences\" doctrine. See Brief for Respondent 21-22; Appendix B, <i>infra.</i> Moreover, many States and the Federal Government apply some form or variation of that doctrine, or permit jury inferences of intent in circumstances similar to those in which California has applied the doctrine, as explained below. See Appendix C, <i>infra.</i> To succeed, Duenas-Alvarez must show something <i>special</i> about California's version of the doctrinefor example, that California in applying it criminalizes conduct that most other States would not consider \"theft.\"</p>\n<p>Duenas-Alvarez attempts to make just such a showing. In particular, he says that California's doctrine, unlike that of most other States, makes a defendant criminally liable for conduct that the defendant did not intend, not even as a known or almost certain byproduct of the defendant's intentional acts. See 1 La-Fave § 5.2(a), at 341 (person intends that which he knows \"is practically certain to follow from his conduct\"). At oral argument, Duenas-Alvarez's counsel suggested that California's doctrine, for example, might hold an individual who wrongly bought liquor for an underage drinker criminally responsible for that young drinker's later (unforeseen) reckless driving. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44. And Duenas-Alvarez refers to several California cases in order to prove his point. See Brief for Respondent 19.</p>\n<p>We have reviewed those cases, however, and we cannot agree that they show that California's law is somehow special. In the first case, <i>People v. Nguyen,</i> 21 Cal. App.4th 518, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 323 (1993), the Third Appellate District in California upheld the jury conviction of individuals who had aided several robberies at houses of prostitution, for aiding and abetting a sexual assault used by one of the individuals to convince a proprietor, by frightening her, to give up property. <i>Id.,</i> at 528, 533-534, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 329, 333. The court, in upholding the verdict, wrote that \"knowledge of another's criminal purpose is not sufficient for aiding and abetting; the defendant <i>must also share that purpose or intend to commit, encourage, or facilitate the commission of the crime.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 530, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 330 (emphasis added). The court added that \"[w]hile the defendants participated in the criminal endeavor the foreseeability of sexual assault went from possible or likely <i>to certain,</i> yet <i>defendants continued to lend their aid and assistance</i> to the endeavor.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 534, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 333 (emphasis added). The court said that the jury could find that the defendants'</p>\n<blockquote>\"continuing participation in the criminal endeavor aided the perpetrators by providing the control and security they needed to tarry long enough to commit the sexual offense, by helping to convince the victim that resistance would be useless, and by dissuading the victim's employee from any notion she may have formed of going to the victim's assistance.\"</blockquote>\n<p>And the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Under these circumstances it will not do for defendants to assert that they <span class=\"star-pagination\">*822</span> were concerned only with robbery and bear no responsibility for the sexual assault.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 533-534, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 333.</blockquote>\n<p><i>People v. Simpson,</i> 66 Cal.App.2d 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2197320\"><a href=\"/opinion/2197320/people-v-simpson/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span> (1944), affirmed a kidnaping and robbery conviction on an aiding and abetting theory. <i>Id.,</i> at 322, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2197320\"><a href=\"/opinion/2197320/people-v-simpson/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>. Although the defendant argued to the appeals court that she and her compatriots had not planned to kidnap the robbery victim, the record showed that she had brought the gun used to intimidate the victim while he was tied up and placed in a car, in which she and her corobbers rode with the victim to another location while they robbed him. <i>Id.,</i> at 322-323, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2197320\"><a href=\"/opinion/2197320/people-v-simpson/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>. As in <i>Nguyen,</i> the court, noting that kidnaping was the <i>means</i> by which the robbery was committed, found that the defendant had the requisite \"motive,\" or intent to commit the kidnaping. 66 Cal. App.2d, at 326, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2197320\"><a href=\"/opinion/2197320/people-v-simpson/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><i>People v. Montes,</i> 74 Cal.App.4th 1050, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 482 (1999), affirmed an attempted murder conviction where a confederate of the defendant shot the victim after the defendant committed armed assault, simple assault, and breach of the peace. <i>Id.,</i> at 1055, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 485. The court found that the conduct for which the appellant was charged with assault and breach of the peace was a \"confrontation. . . punctuated by threats and weaponry\" \"in the context of an ongoing rivalry between . . . two gangs [that] acted violently toward each other.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The court reasoned that the escalating violence, resulting in someone being shot, was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's intended act of participating in the gang confrontation. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Although the court in <i>Montes</i> applied a more expansive concept of \"motive\" or \"intent\" than did the courts in <i>Nguyen</i> and <i>Simpson,</i> we cannot say that those concepts as used in any of these cases extend significantly beyond the concept as set forth in the cases of other States. See Appendix C, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>Moreover, in our view, to find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute's language. It requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime. To show that realistic probability, an offender, of course, may show that the statute was so applied in his own case. But he must at least point to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special (nongeneric) manner for which he argues.</p>\n<p>Because Duenas-Alvarez makes no such showing here, we cannot find that California's statute, through the California courts' application of a \"natural and probable consequences\" doctrine, creates a subspecies of the Vehicle Code section crime that falls outside the generic definition of \"theft.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Duenas-Alvarez makes two additional claims. First, he argues that § 10851 holds liable accessories after the fact; and to prove that an individual was an accessory after the fact does not require the Government to show that the individual committed a theft. Second, Duenas-Alvarez argues that § 10851 applies, not only to auto theft, but also to joyriding, which he argues involves so limited a deprivation of the use of a car that it falls outside the generic \"theft\" definition. See <i>Van Vechten v. American Eagle Fire Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></span> (1925) (Cardozo, J.) (citing cases for proposition that a very temporary use is not theft).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*823</span> We shall not consider these claims. The question that we agreed to decide is whether \"`theft offense'\" in the federal statute \"includes aiding and abetting the commission of the offense.\" See Brief for Petitioner I. Context makes clear that \"aiding and abetting\" in this question referred to the use of that term in <i>Penuliar, i.e.,</i> to the second and third common-law categories (principal in the second degree, accessory before the fact), see <i>supra,</i> at 820, see also Brief for Petitioner 13, and not to \"accessory after the fact.\" Thus neither this claim nor the \"joyriding\" claim falls within the terms of the question presented. Regardless, the lower court did not consider the claims, and we decline to reach them in the first instance. See <i>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.

I am not prepared to disagree with anything said in Part III-A, but I believe we would be well advised to withhold comment on issues of California law until after they have been addressed by the Court of Appeals in the first instance. Limiting our decision to the question we granted certiorari to answer, though not a rigid rule, is generally prudent. Doing so seems particularly wise whenever reaching beyond the question presented requires analysis of disputed issues of state law. Because circuit judges are generally more familiar with the law of the States within their respective jurisdictions than we are, we have often followed the sound practice of deferring to the courts of appeals on such matters even when we did not necessarily share their views.

DUENAS\n\n                    ALVAREZ \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 05–1629.       Argued December 5, 2006—Decided January 17, 2007\nRespondent, a permanent resident alien, was convicted of violating Cal.\n  Veh. Code Ann. §10851(a), under which “[a]ny person who drives or\n  takes a vehicle not his or her own, without the consent of the owner\n  . . . , or any person who is a party or an accessory to or an accomplice\n  in the driving or unauthorized taking or stealing, is guilty of a public\n  offense.” (Emphasis added.) The Federal Government then sought to\n  remove respondent from the United States as an alien convicted of “a\n  theft offense . . . for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one\n  year,” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(G); §1227(a)(2)(A). The Government\n  claimed that the California conviction qualified as such a “theft of\n  fense” under the framework set forth in Taylor v. United States, 495\n  U. S. 575. In Taylor, the Court considered whether a prior conviction\n  for violating a state statute criminalizing certain burglary-like be\n  havior fell within the term “burglary” for sentence-enhancement pur\n  poses under 18 U. S. C. §924(e). This Court held that Congress\n  meant that term to refer to “burglary” in “the generic sense in which\n  the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States,” id., at\n  598; and that a sentencing court seeking to determine whether a par\n  ticular prior conviction was for generic burglary should normally look\n  to the state statute defining the crime of conviction, not to the facts of\n  the particular prior case, id., at 599–600; but that where state law\n  defines burglary broadly to include crimes falling outside generic\n  “burglary,” the sentencer should “go beyond the mere fact of convic\n  tion” and examine, e.g., the charging document and jury instructions\n  to determine whether the earlier “jury was actually required to find\n  all the elements of generic burglary,” id., at 602. The Federal Immi\n  gration Judge and the Bureau of Immigration Appeals (BIA) found\n2                   GONZALES v. DUENAS-ALVAREZ\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    respondent removable, but the Ninth Circuit, summarily remanded\n    in light of its earlier Penuliar decision holding that “aiding and abet\n    ting” a theft is not itself a crime under the generic definition of theft.\nHeld: The term “theft offense” in 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(G) includes the\n crime of “aiding and abetting” a theft offense. Pp. 5–11.\n    (a) One who aids or abets a theft, like a principal who actually par\n ticipates, commits a crime that falls within the scope of the generic\n theft definition accepted by the BIA and the Ninth and other Cir\n cuits: the “taking of property or an exercise of control over property\n without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of\n rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than\n total or permanent.” Penuliar v. Gonzales, 435 F. 3d 961, 969. Since,\n as the record shows, state and federal criminal law now uniformly\n treats principals and aiders and abettors alike, “the generic sense in\n which” the term “theft” “is now used in the criminal codes of most\n States,” Taylor, supra, at 598, covers such “aiders and abettors” as\n well as principals. And the criminal activities of these aiders and\n abettors of a generic theft thus fall within the scope of the term\n “theft” in the federal statute. Pp. 5–6.\n    (b) The Court rejects respondent’s argument that Cal. Veh. Code\n §10851, through the California courts’ application of a “natural and\n probable consequences” doctrine, creates a subspecies of the crime\n falling outside the generic “theft” definition. The fact that, under\n California law, an aider and abettor is criminally responsible not only\n for the crime he intends, but also for any crime that naturally and\n probably results from his intended crime, does not in itself show that\n the state statute covers a nongeneric theft crime. Relatively few ju\n risdictions have expressly rejected the “natural and probable conse\n quences” doctrine, and many States and the Federal Government ap\n ply some form or variation of that doctrine or permit jury inferences\n of intent in circumstances similar to those in which California has\n applied the doctrine. To succeed, respondent must show something\n special about California’s version of the doctrine. His attempt to\n show that, unlike most other States, California makes a defendant\n criminally liable for conduct he did not intend, not even as a known\n or almost certain byproduct of his intentional acts, fails because the\n California cases respondent cites do not show that California’s law is\n applied in such a way that is somehow broader in scope than other\n States’ laws. Moreover, to find that state law creates a crime outside\n the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires a\n realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State\n would apply its statute to conduct falling outside the generic defini\n tion. To make that showing, an offender must at least point to his\n own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the\n                      Cite as: 549 U.

Pp. 6–10.\n    (c) Respondent’s additional claims—that §10851 (1) holds liable ac\n  cessories after the fact, who need not be shown to have committed a\n  theft, and (2) applies to joyriding, which falls outside the generic\n  “theft” definition—are not considered here because they do not fall\n  within the terms of the question presented, the lower court did not\n  consider them, and this Court declines to reach them in the first in\n  stance.

LUIS ALEXANDER DUENAS- \n\n                   ALVAREZ \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 17, 2007] \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Immigration law provides for removal from the United\nStates of an alien convicted of “a theft offense (including\nreceipt of stolen property) . . . for which the term of im\nprisonment [is] at least one year.”              8 U. S. C.\n§1101(a)(43)(G) (emphasis added); §1227(a)(2)(A). The\nquestion here is whether the term “theft offense” in this\nfederal statute includes the crime of “aiding and abetting”\na theft offense. We hold that it does. And we vacate a\nNinth Circuit determination to the contrary.\n                               I\n  The Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 163, 8\nU. S. C. §1101 et seq., lists a set of offenses, conviction for\nany one of which subjects certain aliens to removal from\nthe United States, §1227(a). In determining whether a\nconviction (say, a conviction for violating a state criminal\nlaw that forbids the taking of property without permis\nsion) falls within the scope of a listed offense (e.g., “theft\noffense”), the lower courts uniformly have applied the\napproach this Court set forth in Taylor v. United States,\n2              GONZALES v. DUENAS-ALVAREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n495 U. S. 575 (1990). E.g., Soliman v. Gonzales, 419 F. 3d\n276, 284 (CA4 2005); Abimbola v. Ashcroft, 378 F. 3d 173,\n176–177 (CA2 2004); Huerta-Guevara v. Ashcroft, 321 F.\n3d 883, 886–888 (CA9 2003); Hernandez-Mancilla v. INS,\n246 F. 3d 1002, 1008–1009 (CA7 2001).\n   Taylor concerned offenses listed in the federal Armed\nCareer Criminal Act, 18 U. S. C. §924(e) (2000 ed. and\nSupp. IV). That Act mandates a lengthy prison sentence\nfor offenders with previous convictions for, e.g., a “violent\nfelony”; and the Act sets forth certain specific crimes, e.g.,\n“burglary,” included in this category. The Court, in Tay\nlor, considered whether a conviction for violating a state\nstatute criminalizing certain burglary-like behavior fell\nwithin the listed federal term “burglary.” 495 U. S., at\n589, 598.\n   The Court held that Congress meant its listed term\n“burglary” to refer to a specific crime, i.e., “ ‘burglary’ ” in\n“the generic sense in which the term is now used in the\ncriminal codes of most States.” Id., at 598 (emphasis\nadded). The Court also held that a state conviction quali\nfies as a burglary conviction, “regardless of” the “exact\n[state] definition or label” as long as it has the “basic\nelements” of “generic” burglary, namely “unlawful or\nunprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or\nstructure, with intent to commit a crime.” Id., at 599. The\nCourt added that, when a sentencing court seeks to de\ntermine whether a particular prior conviction was for a\ngeneric burglary offense, it should normally look not to the\nfacts of the particular prior case, but rather to the state\nstatute defining the crime of conviction. Id., at 599–600.\n   The Court further noted that a “few States’ burglary\nstatutes,” “define burglary more broadly” to include both a\n(generically defined) listed crime and also one or more\nnonlisted crimes. Id., at 599. For example, Massachusetts\ndefines “burglary” as including not only breaking into “ ‘a\nbuilding’ ” but also breaking into a “vehicle” (which falls\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\noutside the generic definition of “burglary,” for a car is not\na “ ‘building or structure’ ”). See Shepard v. United States,\n544 U. S. 13, 16, 17 (2005); see also Taylor, 495 U. S., at\n599 (discussing Missouri burglary statutes). In such cases\nthe Court’s “categorical approach” permits the sentencing\ncourt “to go beyond the mere fact of conviction” in order to\ndetermine whether the earlier “jury was actually required\nto find all the elements of generic burglary.” Id., at 602;\nsee also Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F. 3d 45, 54 (CA1 2006)\n(observing that some courts refer to this step of the Taylor\ninquiry as a “modified categorical approach”). “For exam\nple,” the sentencing court might examine “the indictment\nor information and jury instructions” in the earlier case.\n495 U. S., at 602. In Shepard, we added that, in a nonjury\ncase, the sentencing court might examine not only the\n“charging document” but also “the terms of a plea agree\nment,” the “transcript of colloquy between judge and\ndefendant,” or “some comparable judicial record” of infor\nmation about the “factual basis for the plea.” 544 U. S., at\n26.\n                          II\n  The case before us concerns the application of the\nframework just set forth to Luis Duenas-Alvarez, the\nrespondent here, a permanent resident alien of the United\nStates. In 2002, Duenas-Alvarez was convicted of violat\ning Cal. Veh. Code Ann. §10851(a) (West 2000). That\nsection states:\n    “Any person who drives or takes a vehicle not his or\n    her own, without the consent of the owner thereof,\n    and with intent either to permanently or temporarily\n    deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or pos\n    session of the vehicle, whether with or without intent\n    to steal the vehicle, or any person who is a party or an\n    accessory to or an accomplice in the driving or unau\n    thorized taking or stealing, is guilty of a public of\n4              GONZALES v. DUENAS-ALVAREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    fense.” (Emphasis added.)\nAfter Duenas-Alvarez was convicted, the Federal Govern\nment, claiming that the conviction was for a generic theft\noffense, began removal proceedings. A Federal Immigra\ntion Judge, agreeing with the Government that the Cali\nfornia offense is “a theft offense . . . for which the term of\nimprisonment [is] at least one year,” found Duenas-\nAlvarez removable. 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(G) (footnote\nomitted); §1227(a)(2)(A). The Bureau of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed. Duenas-Alvarez sought review of\nthe BIA’s decision in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit.\n   While respondent’s petition for court review was pend\ning, the Ninth Circuit, in Penuliar v. Ashcroft, 395 F. 3d\n1037 (2005), held that the relevant California Vehicle\nCode provision, §10851(a), sweeps more broadly than\ngeneric theft. See id., at 1044–1045. In particular, the\ncourt said that generic theft has as an element the taking\nor control of others’ property. But, the court added, the\nCalifornia statutory phrase “ ‘[who] is a party or an acces\nsory . . . or an accomplice’ ” would permit conviction “for\naiding and abetting a theft.” Id., at 1044 (emphasis de\nleted). And the court believed that one might “aid” or\n“abet” a theft without taking or controlling property. Id.,\nat 1044–1045 (citing Martinez-Perez v. Ashcroft, 393 F. 3d\n1018 (CA9 2004), withdrawn and amended, 417 F. 3d 1022\n(2005)). Hence, in the Court of Appeals’ view, the provi\nsion must cover some generically defined “theft” crimes\nand also some other crimes (aiding and abetting crimes)\nthat, because they are not generically defined “theft”\ncrimes, fall outside the scope of the term “theft” in the\nimmigration statute. 395 F. 3d, at 1044–1045.\n   The Ninth Circuit subsequently heard Duenas-Alvarez’s\npetition for review and summarily remanded the case to\nthe agency for further proceedings in light of Penuliar.\n                  Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n176 Fed. Appx. 820 (2006). We granted the Government’s\npetition for certiorari in order to consider the legal validity\nof the Ninth Circuit’s holding set forth in Penuliar and\napplied here, namely the holding that “aiding and abet\nting” a theft is not itself a crime that falls within the\ngeneric definition of theft. We conclude that the Ninth\nCircuit erred.\n                              III\n   The Ninth Circuit, like other Circuits and the BIA,\naccepted as a generic definition of theft, the “taking of\nproperty or an exercise of control over property without\nconsent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of\nrights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation\nis less than total or permanent.” Penuliar v. Gonzales, 435\nF. 3d 961, 969 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSee Abimbola, 378 F. 3d, at 176 (analyzing the BIA’s\ndefinition and citing cases from three other Circuits, in\ncluding the Ninth Circuit, approving that definition). The\nquestion before us is whether one who aids or abets a theft\nfalls, like a principal, within the scope of this generic\ndefinition. We conclude that he does.\n   The common law divided participants in a felony into\nfour basic categories: (1) first-degree principals, those who\nactually committed the crime in question; (2) second-\ndegree principals, aiders and abettors present at the scene\nof the crime; (3) accessories before the fact, aiders and\nabettors who helped the principal before the basic criminal\nevent took place; and (4) accessories after the fact, persons\nwho helped the principal after the basic criminal event\ntook place. See Standefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10,\n15 (1980). In the course of the 20th century, however,\nAmerican jurisdictions eliminated the distinction among\nthe first three categories. Id., at 16–19; Nye & Nissen v.\nUnited States, 336 U. S. 613, 618 (1949).\n   Indeed, every jurisdiction—all States and the Federal\n6              GONZALES v. DUENAS-ALVAREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nGovernment—has “expressly abrogated the distinction”\namong principals and aiders and abettors who fall into the\nsecond and third categories. 2 W. LaFave, Substantive\nCriminal Law §13.1(e), p. 333 (2d ed. 2003) (LaFave). The\nSolicitor General has presented us with a comprehensive\naccount of the law of all States and federal jurisdictions as\nwell. And we have verified that these jurisdictions treat\nsimilarly principals and aiders and abettors who fall into\nthe second or third common-law category. See Appendix\nA, infra. Since criminal law now uniformly treats those\nwho fall into the first three categories alike, “the generic\nsense in which” the term “theft” “is now used in the crimi\nnal codes of most States,” Taylor, 495 U. S., at 598, covers\nsuch “aiders and abettors” as well as principals. And the\ncriminal activities of these aiders and abettors of a generic\ntheft must themselves fall within the scope of the term\n“theft” in the federal statute.\n                              A\n   Duenas-Alvarez does not defend the Ninth Circuit’s\nposition. He agrees with the Government that generically\nspeaking the law treats aiders and abettors during and\nbefore the crime the same way it treats principals; and\nthat the immigration statute must then treat them simi\nlarly as well. Instead, Duenas-Alvarez argues that the\nCalifornia Vehicle Code provision in other ways reaches\nbeyond generic theft to cover certain nongeneric crimes.\n   Duenas-Alvarez points out that California defines “aid\ning and abetting” such that an aider and abettor is crimi\nnally responsible not only for the crime he intends, but\nalso for any crime that “naturally and probably” results\nfrom his intended crime. People v. Durham, 70 Cal. 2d\n171, 181, 449 P. 2d 198, 204 (1969) (“ ‘aider and abettor . . .\nliable for the natural and reasonable or probable conse\nquences of any act that he knowingly aided or encour\naged’ ” (quoting People v. Villa, 156 Cal. App. 2d 128, 134\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1957); emphasis deleted). This fact alone does not show\nthat the statute covers a nongeneric theft crime, for rela\ntively few jurisdictions (only 10 in Duenas-Alvarez’s own\nview) have expressly rejected the “natural and probable\nconsequences” doctrine. See Brief for Respondent 21–22;\nAppendix B, infra. Moreover, many States and the Fed\neral Government apply some form or variation of that\ndoctrine, or permit jury inferences of intent in circum\nstances similar to those in which California has applied\nthe doctrine, as explained below. See Appendix C, infra.\nTo succeed, Duenas-Alvarez must show something special\nabout California’s version of the doctrine—for example,\nthat California in applying it criminalizes conduct that\nmost other States would not consider “theft.”\n   Duenas-Alvarez attempts to make just such a showing.\nIn particular, he says that California’s doctrine, unlike\nthat of most other States, makes a defendant criminally\nliable for conduct that the defendant did not intend, not\neven as a known or almost certain byproduct of the defen\ndant’s intentional acts. See 1 LaFave §5.2(a), at 341 (per\nson intends that which he knows “is practically certain to\nfollow from his conduct”). At oral argument, Duenas-\nAlvarez’s counsel suggested that California’s doctrine, for\nexample, might hold an individual who wrongly bought\nliquor for an underage drinker criminally responsible for\nthat young drinker’s later (unforeseen) reckless driving.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 44. And Duenas-Alvarez refers to\nseveral California cases in order to prove his point. See\nBrief for Respondent 19.\n   We have reviewed those cases, however, and we cannot\nagree that they show that California’s law is somehow\nspecial. In the first case, People v. Nguyen, 21 Cal. App.\n4th 518, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d 323 (1993), the Third Appellate\nDistrict in California upheld the jury conviction of indi\nviduals who had aided several robberies at houses of\nprostitution, for aiding and abetting a sexual assault used\n8             GONZALES v. DUENAS-ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nby one of the individuals to convince a proprietor, by\nfrightening her, to give up property. Id., at 528, 533–534,\n26 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 329, 333. The court, in upholding the\nverdict, wrote that “knowledge of another’s criminal pur\npose is not sufficient for aiding and abetting; the defen\ndant must also share that purpose or intend to commit,\nencourage, or facilitate the commission of the crime.” Id.,\nat 530, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 330 (emphasis added). The\ncourt added that “[w]hile the defendants participated in\nthe criminal endeavor the foreseeability of sexual assault\nwent from possible or likely to certain, yet defendants\ncontinued to lend their aid and assistance to the en\ndeavor.” Id., at 534, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 333 (emphasis\nadded). The court said that the jury could find that the\ndefendants’\n    “continuing participation in the criminal endeavor\n    aided the perpetrators by providing the control and\n    security they needed to tarry long enough to commit\n    the sexual offense, by helping to convince the victim\n    that resistance would be useless, and by dissuading\n    the victim’s employee from any notion she may have\n    formed of going to the victim’s assistance.”\nAnd the court concluded that:\n    “Under these circumstances it will not do for defen\n    dants to assert that they were concerned only with\n    robbery and bear no responsibility for the sexual as\n    sault.” Id., at 533–534, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 333.\n  People v. Simpson, 66 Cal. App. 2d 319 (1944), affirmed\na kidnaping and robbery conviction on an aiding and\nabetting theory. Id., at 322. Although the defendant\nargued to the appeals court that she and her compatriots\nhad not planned to kidnap the robbery victim, the record\nshowed that she had brought the gun used to intimidate\nthe victim while he was tied up and placed in a car, in\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich she and her corobbers rode with the victim to an\nother location while they robbed him. Id., at 322–323. As\nin Nguyen, the Court, noting that kidnaping was the\nmeans by which the robbery was committed, found that\nthe defendant had the requisite “motive,” or intent to\ncommit the kidnaping. 66 Cal. App. 2d, at 326.\n  People v. Montes, 74 Cal. App. 4th 1050, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d\n482 (1999), affirmed an attempted murder conviction\nwhere a confederate of the defendant shot the victim after\nthe defendant committed armed assault, simple assault,\nand breach of the peace. Id., at 1055, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at\n485. The court found that the conduct for which the appel\nlant was charged with assault and breach of the peace was\na “confrontation . . . punctuated by threats and weaponry”\n“in the context of an ongoing rivalry between . . . two\ngangs [that] acted violently toward each other.” Ibid. The\ncourt reasoned that the escalating violence, resulting in\nsomeone being shot, was a foreseeable consequence of the\ndefendant’s intended act of participating in the gang\nconfrontation. Ibid.\n  Although the court in Montes applied a more expansive\nconcept of “motive” or “intent” than did the courts in\nNguyen and Simpson, we cannot say that those concepts\nas used in any of these cases extend significantly beyond\nthe concept as set forth in the cases of other States. See\nAppendix C, infra.\n  Moreover, in our view, to find that a state statute cre\nates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime\nin a federal statute requires more than the application of\nlegal imagination to a state statute’s language. It requires\na realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that\nthe State would apply its statute to conduct that falls\noutside the generic definition of a crime. To show that\nrealistic possibility, an offender, of course, may show that\nthe statute was so applied in his own case. But he must at\nleast point to his own case or other cases in which the\n10             GONZALES v. DUENAS-ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate courts in fact did apply the statute in the special\n(nongeneric) manner for which he argues.\n   Because Duenas-Alvarez makes no such showing here,\nwe cannot find that California’s statute, through the\nCalifornia courts’ application of a “natural and probable\nconsequences” doctrine, creates a subspecies of the Vehicle\nCode section crime that falls outside the generic definition\nof “theft.”\n                              B\n   Duenas-Alvarez makes two additional claims. First, he\nargues that §10851 holds liable accessories after the fact;\nand to prove that an individual was an accessory after the\nfact does not require the government to show that the\nindividual committed a theft. Second, Duenas-Alvarez\nargues that §10851 applies, not only to auto theft, but also\nto joyriding, which he argues involves so limited a depri\nvation of the use of a car that it falls outside the generic\n“theft” definition. See Van Vechten v. American Eagle Fire\nIns. Co., 239 N. Y. 303, 146 N. E. 432 (1925) (Cardozo, J.)\n(citing cases for proposition that a very temporary use is\nnot theft).\n   We shall not consider these claims. The question that\nwe agreed to decide is whether “ ‘theft offense’ ” in the\nfederal statute “includes aiding and abetting the commis\nsion of the offense.” See Brief for Petitioner I. Context\nmakes clear that “aiding and abetting” in this question\nreferred to the use of that term in Penuliar, i.e., to the\nsecond and third common-law categories (principal in the\nsecond degree, accessory before the fact), see supra, at 5,\nsee also Brief for Petitioner 13, and not to “accessory after\nthe fact.” Thus neither this claim nor the “joyriding” claim\nfalls within the terms of the question presented. Regard\nless, the lower court did not consider the claims, and we\ndecline to reach them in the first instance. See National\nCollegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 469–470\n                 Cite as: 549 U. S. ____ (2007)           11\n\n               Appendix A to opinion of the Court\n\n(1999); Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U.

GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL, \n\n    PETITIONER v. LUIS ALEXANDER DUENAS- \n\n                   ALVAREZ \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                       [January 17, 2007] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart.\n   While I join Parts I, II, and III–B of the Court’s opinion,\nas well as its judgment, I do not join Part III–A. I am not\nprepared to disagree with anything said in Part III–A, but\nI believe we would be well advised to withhold comment\non issues of California law until after they have been\naddressed by the Court of Appeals in the first instance.\nLimiting our decision to the question we granted certiorari\nto answer, though not a rigid rule, is generally prudent.\nDoing so seems particularly wise whenever reaching\nbeyond the question presented requires analysis of dis\nputed issues of state law. Because circuit judges are\ngenerally more familiar with the law of the States within\ntheir respective jurisdictions than we are, we have often\nfollowed the sound practice of deferring to the courts of\nappeals on such matters even when we did not necessarily\nshare their views. See, e.g., Haring v. Prosise, 462 U. S.\n306, 314 (1983); Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 345–346,\nand n. 10 (1976) (collecting cases); see also Elk Grove\nUnified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 16 (2004). I\nwould adhere to that settled practice in this case.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145764/", "sha1": "89b309d5430af3dbec7508d0dc43e0693f9e8b09", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2006-011", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:07:21"}
