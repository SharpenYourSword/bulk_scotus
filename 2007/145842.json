UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 06–571.      Argued October 9, 2007—Decided December 10, 2007\nAfter trading a controlled substance for a pistol, petitioner Watson was\n  indicted for, inter alia, violating 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A), which sets\n  a mandatory minimum sentence, depending on the facts, for a defen\n  dant who, “during and in relation to any . . . drug trafficking crime[,]\n  . . . uses . . . a firearm.” The statute does not define “uses,” but this\n  Court has spoken to it twice. In holding that “a criminal who trades\n  his firearm for drugs ‘uses’ it . . . within the meaning of §924(c)(1),”\n  Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 241, the Court rested primarily\n  on the “ordinary or natural meaning” of the verb in context, id., at\n  228, understanding its common range as going beyond employment\n  as a weapon to trading a weapon for drugs, id., at 230. Later, in\n  holding that merely possessing a firearm kept near the scene of drug\n  trafficking is not “use” under §924(c)(1), the Court, in Bailey v.\n  United States, 516 U. S. 137, again looked to “ordinary or natural”\n  meaning, id., at 145, deciding that “§924(c)(1) requires evidence suffi\n  cient to show an active employment of the firearm by the defendant, a\n  use that makes the firearm an operative factor in relation to the\n  predicate offense,” id., at 143. Watson pleaded guilty but reserved\n  the right to challenge the factual basis for a §924(c)(1)(A) conviction\n  and sentence. The Fifth Circuit affirmed on its precedent foreclosing\n  any argument that Watson had not “used” a firearm.\nHeld: A person does not “use” a firearm under 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)\n when he receives it in trade for drugs. Pp. 4–9.\n    (a) The Government’s position lacks authority in either precedent\n or regular English. Neither Smith, which addressed only the trader\n who swaps his gun for drugs, not the trading partner who ends up\n with the gun, nor Bailey, which ruled that a gun must be made use of\n actively to satisfy §924(c)(1)(A), decides this case. With no statutory\n2                      WATSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    definition, the meaning of “uses” has to turn on “everyday meaning”\n    revealed in phraseology that strikes the ear as “both reasonable and\n    normal.” Smith, supra, 228, 230. When Watson handed over the\n    drugs for the pistol, the officer “used” the pistol to get the drugs, but\n    regular speech would not say that Watson himself used the pistol in\n    the trade. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) The Government’s first effort to trump ordinary English is re\n    jected. Noting that §924(d)(1) authorizes seizure and forfeiture of\n    firearms “intended to be used in” certain crimes, the Government in\n    fers that since some of those offenses involve receipt of a firearm,\n    “use” necessarily includes receipt of a gun even in a barter transac\n    tion. The Government’s reliance on Smith for the proposition that\n    the term must be given the same meaning in both subsections over-\n    reads Smith. The common verb “use” is not at odds in the two sub\n    sections but speaks to different issues in different voices and at dif\n    ferent levels of specificity. Section 924(d)(1) indicates that a gun can\n    be “used” in a receipt crime, but does not say whether both parties to\n    a transfer use the gun, or only one, or which one; however,\n    §924(c)(1)(A) requires just such a specific identification. Pp. 5–7.\n       (c) Nor is the Government’s second effort to trump ordinary Eng\n    lish persuasive. It claims that failing to treat receipt in trade as\n    “use” would create unacceptable asymmetry with Smith; i.e., it would\n    be strange to penalize one side of a gun-for-drugs exchange but not\n    the other. The problem is not with Smith, however, but with the lim\n    ited malleability of the language it construed, and policy-driven\n    symmetry cannot turn “receipt-in-trade” into “use.” Whatever the\n    tension between the prior result and the outcome here, law depends\n    on respect for language and would be served better by statutory\n    amendment than by racking statutory language to cover a policy it\n    fails to reach.

[a]\ndrug trafficking crime” within the meaning of 18 U. S. C.\n§924(c)(1)(A).1 We hold that he does not.\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n  Section 924(c)(1)(A) sets a mandatory minimum sen\ntence, depending on the facts, for a defendant who, “during\nand in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking\ncrime[,] . . . uses or carries a firearm.”2 The statute leaves\nthe term “uses” undefined, though we have spoken to it\ntwice before.\n  Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223 (1993) raised the\nconverse of today’s question, and held that “a criminal who\n——————\n  1 Formerly  18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1) (1994 ed.).\n  2 Any  violation of §924(c)(1)(A), for example, demands a mandatory\nminimum sentence of 5 years. See 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(i). If the\nfirearm is brandished, the minimum goes up to 7 years, see\n§924(c)(1)(A)(ii); if the firearm is discharged, the minimum jumps to 10\nyears, see §924(c)(1)(A)(iii).\n2                  WATSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntrades his firearm for drugs ‘uses’ it during and in relation\nto a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of\n§924(c)(1).” Id., at 241. We rested primarily on the “ordi\nnary or natural meaning” of the verb in context, id., at\n228, and understood its common range as going beyond\nemployment as a weapon: “it is both reasonable and nor\nmal to say that petitioner ‘used’ his MAC–10 in his drug\ntrafficking offense by trading it for cocaine,” id., at 230.\n  Two years later, the issue in Bailey v. United States, 516\nU. S. 137 (1995) was whether possessing a firearm kept\nnear the scene of drug trafficking is “use” under §924(c)(1).\nWe looked again to “ordinary or natural” meaning, id., at\n145, and decided that mere possession does not amount to\n“use”: “§924(c)(1) requires evidence sufficient to show an\nactive employment of the firearm by the defendant, a use\nthat makes the firearm an operative factor in relation to\nthe predicate offense,” id., at 143.3\n                             B\n   This third case on the reach of §924(c)(1)(A) began to\ntake shape when petitioner, Michael A. Watson, told a\nGovernment informant that he wanted to acquire a gun.\nOn the matter of price, the informant quoted no dollar\nfigure but suggested that Watson could pay in narcotics.\nNext, Watson met with the informant and an undercover\nlaw enforcement agent posing as a firearms dealer, to\nwhom he gave 24 doses of oxycodone hydrocholoride\n(commonly, OxyContin) for a .50 caliber semiautomatic\npistol. When law enforcement officers arrested Watson,\nthey found the pistol in his car, and a later search of his\nhouse turned up a cache of prescription medicines, guns,\n——————\n  3 In 1998, Congress responded to Bailey by amending §924(c)(1). The\n\namendment broadened the provision to cover a defendant who “in\nfurtherance of any [crime of violence or drug trafficking] crime, pos\nsesses a firearm.” 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A). The amendment did not\ntouch the “use” prong of §924(c)(1).\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

Watson said he got the pistol “to protect\nhis other firearms and drugs.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a.\n  A federal grand jury indicted him for distributing a\nSchedule II controlled substance and for “using” the pistol\nduring and in relation to that crime, in violation of\n§924(c)(1)(A).4 Watson pleaded guilty across the board,\nreserving the right to challenge the factual basis for a\n§924(c)(1)(A) conviction and the added consecutive sen\ntence of 60 months for using the gun. The Court of Ap\npeals affirmed, 191 Fed. Appx. 326 (CA5 2006) (per cu\nriam), on Circuit precedent foreclosing any argument that\nWatson had not “used” a firearm, see id., at 327 (citing\nUnited States v. Ulloa, 94 F. 3d 949 (CA5 1996) and\nUnited States v. Zuniga, 18 F. 3d 1254 (CA5 1994)).\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the\nCircuits on whether a person “uses” a firearm within the\nmeaning of 18 U. S.

We now\n——————\n  4 The grand jury also indicted Watson as a felon in possession of a\nfirearm, in violation of §922(g)(1). This count referred to the five\nfirearms found in Watson’s house, but not the pistol he got for the\nnarcotics.\n   5 Compare United States v. Cotto, 456 F. 3d 25 (CA1 2006) (trading\n\ndrugs for a firearm constitutes “use” of the firearm under §924(c)(1)(A));\nUnited States v. Sumler, 294 F. 3d 579 (CA3 2002) (same); United\nStates v. Ramirez-Rangel, 103 F. 3d 1501 (CA9 1997) (same); United\nStates v. Ulloa, 94 F. 3d 949 (CA5 1996) (same); United States v.\nCannon, 88 F. 3d 1495 (CA8 1996) (same), with United States v.\nMontano, 398 F. 3d 1276 (CA11 2005) (per curiam) (defendant did not\n“use” a firearm within the meaning of §924(c)(1)(A) when he traded\ndrugs for a firearm); United States v. Stewart, 246 F. 3d 728 (CADC\n2001) (same); United States v. Warwick, 167 F. 3d 965 (CA6 1999)\n(same); United States v. Westmoreland, 122 F. 3d 431 (CA7 1997)\n(same). The Fourth Circuit has held that a defendant “used” a firearm\nwhere he gave cocaine base to a compatriot in exchange for assistance\nin obtaining a gun. See United States v. Harris, 39 F. 3d 1262 (1994).\nSubsequent unpublished opinions in that Circuit have relied on Harris\nfor the proposition that the receipt of a firearm in exchange for drugs\nconstitutes use of the firearm. See, e.g., United States v. Belcher, No.\n4                  WATSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nreverse.\n                              II\n                              A\n  The Government’s position that Watson “used” the\npistol under §924(c)(1)(A) by receiving it for narcotics lacks\nauthority in either precedent or regular English. To begin\nwith, neither Smith nor Bailey implicitly decides this case.\nWhile Smith held that firearms may be “used” in a barter\ntransaction, even with no violent employment, see 508\nU. S., at 241, the case addressed only the trader who\nswaps his gun for drugs, not the trading partner who ends\nup with the gun. Bailey, too, is unhelpful, with its rule\nthat a gun must be made use of actively to satisfy\n§924(c)(1)(A), as “an operative factor in relation to the\npredicate offense.” 516 U. S., at 143. The question here is\nwhether it makes sense to say that Watson employed the\ngun at all; Bailey does not answer it.\n  With no statutory definition or definitive clue, the\nmeaning of the verb “uses” has to turn on the language as\nwe normally speak it, see, e.g., Lopez v. Gonzales, 549\nU. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 5); Asgrow Seed Co. v.\nWinterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995); FDIC v. Meyer, 510\nU. S. 471, 476 (1994); there is no other source of a reason\nable inference about what Congress understood when\nwriting or what its words will bring to the mind of a care\nful reader. So, in Smith we looked for “everyday mean\ning,” 508 U. S., at 228, revealed in phraseology that\nstrikes the ear as “both reasonable and normal,” id., at\n230. See also Bailey, supra, at 145. This appeal to the\nordinary leaves the Government without much of a case.\n  The Government may say that a person “uses” a firearm\nsimply by receiving it in a barter transaction, but no one\nelse would.

Cf. United States\nv. Stewart, 246 F. 3d 728, 731 (CADC 2001) (“[W]hen a\nperson pays a cashier a dollar for a cup of coffee in the\ncourthouse cafeteria, the customer has not used the coffee.\nHe has only used the dollar bill”). So, when Watson\nhanded over the drugs for the pistol, the informant or the\nagent6 “used” the pistol to get the drugs, just as Smith\nheld, but regular speech would not say that Watson him\nself used the pistol in the trade. “A seller does not ‘use’ a\nbuyer’s consideration,” United States v. Westmoreland, 122\nF. 3d 431, 436 (CA7 1997), and the Government’s contrary\nposition recalls another case; Lopez, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7), rejected the Government’s interpretation of 18\nU. S. C. §924(c)(2) because “we do not normally speak or\nwrite the Government’s way.”7\n                             B\n  The Government would trump ordinary English with\ntwo arguments. First, it relies on Smith for the pertinence\nof a neighboring provision, 18 U. S. C. §924(d)(1), which\nauthorizes seizure and forfeiture of firearms “intended to\nbe used in” certain criminal offenses listed in §924(d)(3).\nSome of those offenses involve receipt of a firearm,8 from\n——————\n  6 The record does not say which.\n  7 Dictionaries  confirm the conclusion. “Use” is concededly “elastic,”\nSmith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 241 (1993) (SCALIA, J., dissent\ning), but none of its standard definitions stretch far enough to reach\nWatson’s conduct, see, e.g., Webster’s New International Dictionary of\nthe English Language 2806 (2d ed. 1939) (“to employ”); The Random\nHouse Dictionary of the English Language 2097 (2d ed. 1987) (to “apply\nto one’s own purposes”; “put into service; make use of”); Black’s Law\nDictionary 1541 (6th ed. 1990) (“[t]o avail oneself of; . . . to utilize”); see\nalso Smith, supra, at 228–229 (listing various dictionary definitions).\n  8 See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §922(j) (prohibiting, inter alia, the receipt of a\n\nstolen firearm in interstate commerce); §924(b) (prohibiting, inter alia,\n6                 WATSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich the Government infers that “use” under §924(d)\nnecessarily includes receipt of a gun even in a barter\ntransaction. Smith is cited for the proposition that the\nterm must be given the same meaning in both subsections,\nand the Government urges us to import “use” as “receipt\nin barter” into §924(c)(1)(A).\n   We agree with the Government that §924(d) calls for\nattention; the reference to intended use in a receipt crime\ncarries some suggestion that receipt can be “use” (more of\na hint, say, than speaking of intended “use” in a crime\ndefined as exchange). But the suggestion is a tepid one\nand falls short of supporting what is really an attempt to\ndraw a conclusion too specific from a premise too general.\n   The Smith majority rested principally on ordinary\nspeech in reasoning that §924(c)(1) extends beyond use as\na weapon and includes use as an item of barter, see 508\nU. S., at 228–230, and the Smith opinion looks to §924(d)\nonly for its light on that conclusion. It notes that the\n“intended to be used” clause of §924(d)(1) refers to offenses\nwhere “the firearm is not used as a weapon but instead as\nan item of barter or commerce,” id., at 234, with the impli\ncation that Congress intended “use” to reach commercial\ntransactions, not just gun violence, in §924(d) generally,\nsee id., at 234–235. It was this breadth of treatment that\nled the Smith majority to say that, “[u]nless we are to hold\nthat using a firearm has a different meaning in §924(c)(1)\nthan it does in §924(d)—and clearly we should not—we\nmust reject petitioner’s narrow interpretation.” Id., at 235\n(citation omitted); see also Bailey, supra, at 146 (“[U]sing a\nfirearm should not have a different meaning in §924(c)(1)\nthan it does in §924(d)” (internal quotation marks omit\nted)).\n   The Government overreads Smith. While the neighbor\n—————— \n\nthe receipt of a firearm in interstate commerce with the intent to\n\ncommit a felony). \n\n                    Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ning provision indicates that a firearm is “used” nonoffen\nsively, and supports the conclusion that a gun can be\n“used” in barter, beyond that point its illumination fails.\nThis is so because the utility of §924(d)(1) is limited by its\ngenerality and its passive voice; it tells us a gun can be\n“used” in a receipt crime, but not whether both parties to a\ntransfer use the gun, or only one, or which one. The\nnearby subsection (c)(1)(A), however, requires just such a\nspecific identification. It provides that a person who uses\na gun in the circumstances described commits a crime,\nwhose perpetrator must be clearly identifiable in advance.\n    The agnosticism on the part of §924(d)(1) about who\ndoes the using is entirely consistent with common speech’s\nunderstanding that the first possessor is the one who\n“uses” the gun in the trade, and there is thus no cause to\nadmonish us to adhere to the paradigm of a statute “as a\nsymmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme, . . . in which\nthe operative words have a consistent meaning through\nout,” Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995), or\nto invoke the “standard principle of statutory construction\n. . . that identical words and phrases within the same\nstatute should normally be given the same meaning,”\nPowerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U. S.\n___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7). Subsections (d)(1) and\n(c)(1)(A) as we read them are not at odds over the verb\n“use”; the point is merely that in the two subsections the\ncommon verb speaks to different issues in different voices\nand at different levels of specificity. The provisions do\ndistinct jobs, but we do not make them guilty of employing\nthe common verb inconsistently.9\n——————\n  9 For that matter, the Government’s argument that “use” must al\n\nways have an identical meaning in §§924(c)(1)(A) and 924(d)(1) would\nupend Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995). One of the rele\nvant predicate offenses referred to by §924(d)(1) is possession of “any\nstolen firearm . . . [in] interstate or foreign commerce.” 18 U. S.

At bottom, this\natextual policy critique says it would be strange to penal\nize one side of a gun-for-drugs exchange but not the other:\n“[t]he danger to society is created not only by the person\nwho brings the firearm to the drug transaction, but also by\nthe drug dealer who takes the weapon in exchange for his\ndrugs during the transaction,” Brief for United States 23.\n   The position assumes that Smith must be respected, and\nwe join the Government at least on this starting point. A\ndifference of opinion within the Court (as in Smith) does\nnot keep the door open for another try at statutory con\nstruction, where stare decisis has “special force [since] the\nlegislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free\nto alter what we have done.” Patterson v. McLean Credit\nUnion, 491 U. S. 164, 172–173 (1989). What is more, in 14\nyears Congress has taken no step to modify Smith’s hold\ning, and this long congressional acquiescence “has en\nhanced even the usual precedential force” we accord to our\ninterpretations of statutes, Shepard v. United States, 544\nU. S. 13, 23 (2005).\n   The problem, then, is not with the sturdiness of Smith\nbut with the limited malleability of the language Smith\nconstrued, and policy-driven symmetry cannot turn “re\nceipt-in-trade” into “use.” Whatever the tension between\nthe prior result and the outcome here, law depends on\nrespect for language and would be served better by statu\ntory amendment (if Congress sees asymmetry) than by\n\n——————\n“intended to be used” clause in §924(d)(1) is “use” for purposes of\n§924(c)(1)(A), it would follow that mere possession is use. But that\nwould squarely conflict with our considered and unanimous decision in\nBailey that “ ‘use’ must connote more than mere possession of a fire\narm.” 516 U.

It\nwas amended after Bailey and now prohibits not only\nusing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking\ncrime, but also possessing one “in furtherance of” such a\ncrime. 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A); see n. 3, supra. The\nGovernment is confident that “a drug dealer who takes a\nfirearm in exchange for his drugs generally will be subject\nto prosecution” under this new possession prong. Brief for\nUnited States 27; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 41 (Watson’s case\n“could have been charged as possession”); cf. United States\nv. Cox, 324 F. 3d 77, 83, n. 2 (CA2 2003) (“For defendants\ncharged under §924(c) after [the post-Bailey] amendment,\ntrading drugs for a gun will probably result in . . . posses\nsion [in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime]”). This\nview may or may not prevail, and we do not speak to it\ntoday, but it does leave the appeal to symmetry under-\nwhelming in a contest with the English language, on the\nGovernment’s very terms.\n                      *     *     *\n  Given ordinary meaning and the conventions of English,\nwe hold that a person does not “use” a firearm under\n§924(c)(1)(A) when he receives it in trade for drugs.

Distinguishing, as the\nCourt does, between trading a gun for drugs and trading\ndrugs for a gun, for purposes of the 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)\nenhancement, makes scant sense to me. I join the Court’s\njudgment, however, because I am persuaded that the\nCourt took a wrong turn in Smith v. United States, 508\nU. S. 223 (1993), when it held that trading a gun for drugs\nfits within §924(c)(1)’s compass as “us[e]” of a firearm\n“during and in relation to any . . . drug trafficking crime.”\nFor reasons well stated by JUSTICE SCALIA in his dissent\ning opinion in Smith, 508 U. S., at 241, I would read the\nword “use” in §924(c)(1) to mean use as a weapon, not use\nin a bartering transaction. Accordingly, I would overrule\nSmith, and thereby render our precedent both coherent\nand consistent with normal usage. Cf. Henslee v. Union\nPlanters Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 335 U. S. 595, 600 (1949)\n(Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (“Wisdom too often never\ncomes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it\ncomes late.”).\n</pre>", "id": 145842, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2007/12/10/Watson_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2007                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 9, 2007—Decided December 10, 2007\nAfter trading a controlled substance for a pistol, petitioner Watson was\n  indicted for, inter alia, violating 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A), which sets\n  a mandatory minimum sentence, depending on the facts, for a defen\n  dant who, “during and in relation to any . . . drug trafficking crime[,]\n  . . . uses . . . a firearm.” The statute does not define “uses,” but this\n  Court has spoken to it twice. In holding that “a criminal who trades\n  his firearm for drugs ‘uses’ it . . . within the meaning of §924(c)(1),”\n  Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 241, the Court rested primarily\n  on the “ordinary or natural meaning” of the verb in context, id., at\n  228, understanding its common range as going beyond employment\n  as a weapon to trading a weapon for drugs, id., at 230. Later, in\n  holding that merely possessing a firearm kept near the scene of drug\n  trafficking is not “use” under §924(c)(1), the Court, in Bailey v.\n  United States, 516 U. S. 137, again looked to “ordinary or natural”\n  meaning, id., at 145, deciding that “§924(c)(1) requires evidence suffi\n  cient to show an active employment of the firearm by the defendant, a\n  use that makes the firearm an operative factor in relation to the\n  predicate offense,” id., at 143. Watson pleaded guilty but reserved\n  the right to challenge the factual basis for a §924(c)(1)(A) conviction\n  and sentence. The Fifth Circuit affirmed on its precedent foreclosing\n  any argument that Watson had not “used” a firearm.\nHeld: A person does not “use” a firearm under 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)\n when he receives it in trade for drugs. Pp. 4–9.\n    (a) The Government’s position lacks authority in either precedent\n or regular English. Neither Smith, which addressed only the trader\n who swaps his gun for drugs, not the trading partner who ends up\n with the gun, nor Bailey, which ruled that a gun must be made use of\n actively to satisfy §924(c)(1)(A), decides this case. With no statutory\n2                      WATSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    definition, the meaning of “uses” has to turn on “everyday meaning”\n    revealed in phraseology that strikes the ear as “both reasonable and\n    normal.” Smith, supra, 228, 230. When Watson handed over the\n    drugs for the pistol, the officer “used” the pistol to get the drugs, but\n    regular speech would not say that Watson himself used the pistol in\n    the trade. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) The Government’s first effort to trump ordinary English is re\n    jected. Noting that §924(d)(1) authorizes seizure and forfeiture of\n    firearms “intended to be used in” certain crimes, the Government in\n    fers that since some of those offenses involve receipt of a firearm,\n    “use” necessarily includes receipt of a gun even in a barter transac\n    tion. The Government’s reliance on Smith for the proposition that\n    the term must be given the same meaning in both subsections over-\n    reads Smith. The common verb “use” is not at odds in the two sub\n    sections but speaks to different issues in different voices and at dif\n    ferent levels of specificity. Section 924(d)(1) indicates that a gun can\n    be “used” in a receipt crime, but does not say whether both parties to\n    a transfer use the gun, or only one, or which one; however,\n    §924(c)(1)(A) requires just such a specific identification. Pp. 5–7.\n       (c) Nor is the Government’s second effort to trump ordinary Eng\n    lish persuasive. It claims that failing to treat receipt in trade as\n    “use” would create unacceptable asymmetry with Smith; i.e., it would\n    be strange to penalize one side of a gun-for-drugs exchange but not\n    the other. The problem is not with Smith, however, but with the lim\n    ited malleability of the language it construed, and policy-driven\n    symmetry cannot turn “receipt-in-trade” into “use.” Whatever the\n    tension between the prior result and the outcome here, law depends\n    on respect for language and would be served better by statutory\n    amendment than by racking statutory language to cover a policy it\n    fails to reach.

[a]\ndrug trafficking crime” within the meaning of 18 U. S. C.\n§924(c)(1)(A).1 We hold that he does not.\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n  Section 924(c)(1)(A) sets a mandatory minimum sen\ntence, depending on the facts, for a defendant who, “during\nand in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking\ncrime[,] . . . uses or carries a firearm.”2 The statute leaves\nthe term “uses” undefined, though we have spoken to it\ntwice before.\n  Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223 (1993) raised the\nconverse of today’s question, and held that “a criminal who\n——————\n  1 Formerly  18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1) (1994 ed.).\n  2 Any  violation of §924(c)(1)(A), for example, demands a mandatory\nminimum sentence of 5 years. See 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(i). If the\nfirearm is brandished, the minimum goes up to 7 years, see\n§924(c)(1)(A)(ii); if the firearm is discharged, the minimum jumps to 10\nyears, see §924(c)(1)(A)(iii).\n2                  WATSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntrades his firearm for drugs ‘uses’ it during and in relation\nto a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of\n§924(c)(1).” Id., at 241. We rested primarily on the “ordi\nnary or natural meaning” of the verb in context, id., at\n228, and understood its common range as going beyond\nemployment as a weapon: “it is both reasonable and nor\nmal to say that petitioner ‘used’ his MAC–10 in his drug\ntrafficking offense by trading it for cocaine,” id., at 230.\n  Two years later, the issue in Bailey v. United States, 516\nU. S. 137 (1995) was whether possessing a firearm kept\nnear the scene of drug trafficking is “use” under §924(c)(1).\nWe looked again to “ordinary or natural” meaning, id., at\n145, and decided that mere possession does not amount to\n“use”: “§924(c)(1) requires evidence sufficient to show an\nactive employment of the firearm by the defendant, a use\nthat makes the firearm an operative factor in relation to\nthe predicate offense,” id., at 143.3\n                             B\n   This third case on the reach of §924(c)(1)(A) began to\ntake shape when petitioner, Michael A. Watson, told a\nGovernment informant that he wanted to acquire a gun.\nOn the matter of price, the informant quoted no dollar\nfigure but suggested that Watson could pay in narcotics.\nNext, Watson met with the informant and an undercover\nlaw enforcement agent posing as a firearms dealer, to\nwhom he gave 24 doses of oxycodone hydrocholoride\n(commonly, OxyContin) for a .50 caliber semiautomatic\npistol. When law enforcement officers arrested Watson,\nthey found the pistol in his car, and a later search of his\nhouse turned up a cache of prescription medicines, guns,\n——————\n  3 In 1998, Congress responded to Bailey by amending §924(c)(1). The\n\namendment broadened the provision to cover a defendant who “in\nfurtherance of any [crime of violence or drug trafficking] crime, pos\nsesses a firearm.” 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A). The amendment did not\ntouch the “use” prong of §924(c)(1).\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

Watson said he got the pistol “to protect\nhis other firearms and drugs.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a.\n  A federal grand jury indicted him for distributing a\nSchedule II controlled substance and for “using” the pistol\nduring and in relation to that crime, in violation of\n§924(c)(1)(A).4 Watson pleaded guilty across the board,\nreserving the right to challenge the factual basis for a\n§924(c)(1)(A) conviction and the added consecutive sen\ntence of 60 months for using the gun. The Court of Ap\npeals affirmed, 191 Fed. Appx. 326 (CA5 2006) (per cu\nriam), on Circuit precedent foreclosing any argument that\nWatson had not “used” a firearm, see id., at 327 (citing\nUnited States v. Ulloa, 94 F. 3d 949 (CA5 1996) and\nUnited States v. Zuniga, 18 F. 3d 1254 (CA5 1994)).\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the\nCircuits on whether a person “uses” a firearm within the\nmeaning of 18 U. S.

Cotto, 456 F. 3d 25 (CA1 2006) (trading\n\ndrugs for a firearm constitutes “use” of the firearm under §924(c)(1)(A));\nUnited States v. Sumler, 294 F. 3d 579 (CA3 2002) (same); United\nStates v. Ramirez-Rangel, 103 F. 3d 1501 (CA9 1997) (same); United\nStates v. Ulloa, 94 F. 3d 949 (CA5 1996) (same); United States v.\nCannon, 88 F. 3d 1495 (CA8 1996) (same), with United States v.\nMontano, 398 F. 3d 1276 (CA11 2005) (per curiam) (defendant did not\n“use” a firearm within the meaning of §924(c)(1)(A) when he traded\ndrugs for a firearm); United States v. Stewart, 246 F. 3d 728 (CADC\n2001) (same); United States v. Warwick, 167 F. 3d 965 (CA6 1999)\n(same); United States v. Westmoreland, 122 F. 3d 431 (CA7 1997)\n(same). The Fourth Circuit has held that a defendant “used” a firearm\nwhere he gave cocaine base to a compatriot in exchange for assistance\nin obtaining a gun. See United States v. Harris, 39 F. 3d 1262 (1994).\nSubsequent unpublished opinions in that Circuit have relied on Harris\nfor the proposition that the receipt of a firearm in exchange for drugs\nconstitutes use of the firearm. See, e.g., United States v. Belcher, No.\n4                  WATSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nreverse.\n                              II\n                              A\n  The Government’s position that Watson “used” the\npistol under §924(c)(1)(A) by receiving it for narcotics lacks\nauthority in either precedent or regular English. To begin\nwith, neither Smith nor Bailey implicitly decides this case.\nWhile Smith held that firearms may be “used” in a barter\ntransaction, even with no violent employment, see 508\nU. S., at 241, the case addressed only the trader who\nswaps his gun for drugs, not the trading partner who ends\nup with the gun. Bailey, too, is unhelpful, with its rule\nthat a gun must be made use of actively to satisfy\n§924(c)(1)(A), as “an operative factor in relation to the\npredicate offense.” 516 U. S., at 143. The question here is\nwhether it makes sense to say that Watson employed the\ngun at all; Bailey does not answer it.\n  With no statutory definition or definitive clue, the\nmeaning of the verb “uses” has to turn on the language as\nwe normally speak it, see, e.g., Lopez v. Gonzales, 549\nU. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 5); Asgrow Seed Co. v.\nWinterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995); FDIC v. Meyer, 510\nU. S. 471, 476 (1994); there is no other source of a reason\nable inference about what Congress understood when\nwriting or what its words will bring to the mind of a care\nful reader. So, in Smith we looked for “everyday mean\ning,” 508 U. S., at 228, revealed in phraseology that\nstrikes the ear as “both reasonable and normal,” id., at\n230. See also Bailey, supra, at 145. This appeal to the\nordinary leaves the Government without much of a case.\n  The Government may say that a person “uses” a firearm\nsimply by receiving it in a barter transaction, but no one\nelse would.

Cf. United States\nv. Stewart, 246 F. 3d 728, 731 (CADC 2001) (“[W]hen a\nperson pays a cashier a dollar for a cup of coffee in the\ncourthouse cafeteria, the customer has not used the coffee.\nHe has only used the dollar bill”). So, when Watson\nhanded over the drugs for the pistol, the informant or the\nagent6 “used” the pistol to get the drugs, just as Smith\nheld, but regular speech would not say that Watson him\nself used the pistol in the trade. “A seller does not ‘use’ a\nbuyer’s consideration,” United States v. Westmoreland, 122\nF. 3d 431, 436 (CA7 1997), and the Government’s contrary\nposition recalls another case; Lopez, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7), rejected the Government’s interpretation of 18\nU. S. C. §924(c)(2) because “we do not normally speak or\nwrite the Government’s way.”7\n                             B\n  The Government would trump ordinary English with\ntwo arguments. First, it relies on Smith for the pertinence\nof a neighboring provision, 18 U. S. C. §924(d)(1), which\nauthorizes seizure and forfeiture of firearms “intended to\nbe used in” certain criminal offenses listed in §924(d)(3).\nSome of those offenses involve receipt of a firearm,8 from\n——————\n  6 The record does not say which.\n  7 Dictionaries  confirm the conclusion. “Use” is concededly “elastic,”\nSmith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 241 (1993) (SCALIA, J., dissent\ning), but none of its standard definitions stretch far enough to reach\nWatson’s conduct, see, e.g., Webster’s New International Dictionary of\nthe English Language 2806 (2d ed. 1939) (“to employ”); The Random\nHouse Dictionary of the English Language 2097 (2d ed. 1987) (to “apply\nto one’s own purposes”; “put into service; make use of”); Black’s Law\nDictionary 1541 (6th ed. 1990) (“[t]o avail oneself of; . . . to utilize”); see\nalso Smith, supra, at 228–229 (listing various dictionary definitions).\n  8 See, e.g., 18 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich the Government infers that “use” under §924(d)\nnecessarily includes receipt of a gun even in a barter\ntransaction. Smith is cited for the proposition that the\nterm must be given the same meaning in both subsections,\nand the Government urges us to import “use” as “receipt\nin barter” into §924(c)(1)(A).\n   We agree with the Government that §924(d) calls for\nattention; the reference to intended use in a receipt crime\ncarries some suggestion that receipt can be “use” (more of\na hint, say, than speaking of intended “use” in a crime\ndefined as exchange). But the suggestion is a tepid one\nand falls short of supporting what is really an attempt to\ndraw a conclusion too specific from a premise too general.\n   The Smith majority rested principally on ordinary\nspeech in reasoning that §924(c)(1) extends beyond use as\na weapon and includes use as an item of barter, see 508\nU. S., at 228–230, and the Smith opinion looks to §924(d)\nonly for its light on that conclusion. It notes that the\n“intended to be used” clause of §924(d)(1) refers to offenses\nwhere “the firearm is not used as a weapon but instead as\nan item of barter or commerce,” id., at 234, with the impli\ncation that Congress intended “use” to reach commercial\ntransactions, not just gun violence, in §924(d) generally,\nsee id., at 234–235. It was this breadth of treatment that\nled the Smith majority to say that, “[u]nless we are to hold\nthat using a firearm has a different meaning in §924(c)(1)\nthan it does in §924(d)—and clearly we should not—we\nmust reject petitioner’s narrow interpretation.” Id., at 235\n(citation omitted); see also Bailey, supra, at 146 (“[U]sing a\nfirearm should not have a different meaning in §924(c)(1)\nthan it does in §924(d)” (internal quotation marks omit\nted)).\n   The Government overreads Smith. While the neighbor\n—————— \n\nthe receipt of a firearm in interstate commerce with the intent to\n\ncommit a felony). \n\n                    Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2007)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ning provision indicates that a firearm is “used” nonoffen\nsively, and supports the conclusion that a gun can be\n“used” in barter, beyond that point its illumination fails.\nThis is so because the utility of §924(d)(1) is limited by its\ngenerality and its passive voice; it tells us a gun can be\n“used” in a receipt crime, but not whether both parties to a\ntransfer use the gun, or only one, or which one. The\nnearby subsection (c)(1)(A), however, requires just such a\nspecific identification. It provides that a person who uses\na gun in the circumstances described commits a crime,\nwhose perpetrator must be clearly identifiable in advance.\n    The agnosticism on the part of §924(d)(1) about who\ndoes the using is entirely consistent with common speech’s\nunderstanding that the first possessor is the one who\n“uses” the gun in the trade, and there is thus no cause to\nadmonish us to adhere to the paradigm of a statute “as a\nsymmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme, . . . in which\nthe operative words have a consistent meaning through\nout,” Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995), or\nto invoke the “standard principle of statutory construction\n. . . that identical words and phrases within the same\nstatute should normally be given the same meaning,”\nPowerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U. S.\n___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7). Subsections (d)(1) and\n(c)(1)(A) as we read them are not at odds over the verb\n“use”; the point is merely that in the two subsections the\ncommon verb speaks to different issues in different voices\nand at different levels of specificity. The provisions do\ndistinct jobs, but we do not make them guilty of employing\nthe common verb inconsistently.9\n——————\n  9 For that matter, the Government’s argument that “use” must al\n\nways have an identical meaning in §§924(c)(1)(A) and 924(d)(1) would\nupend Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995). One of the rele\nvant predicate offenses referred to by §924(d)(1) is possession of “any\nstolen firearm . . . [in] interstate or foreign commerce.” 18 U. S. C.\n§922(j). If we were to hold that all criminal conduct covered by the\n8                  WATSON v. UNITED STATES \n\n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               C\n\n   The second effort to trump regular English is the claim\nthat failing to treat receipt in trade as “use” would create\nunacceptable asymmetry with Smith. At bottom, this\natextual policy critique says it would be strange to penal\nize one side of a gun-for-drugs exchange but not the other:\n“[t]he danger to society is created not only by the person\nwho brings the firearm to the drug transaction, but also by\nthe drug dealer who takes the weapon in exchange for his\ndrugs during the transaction,” Brief for United States 23.\n   The position assumes that Smith must be respected, and\nwe join the Government at least on this starting point. A\ndifference of opinion within the Court (as in Smith) does\nnot keep the door open for another try at statutory con\nstruction, where stare decisis has “special force [since] the\nlegislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free\nto alter what we have done.” Patterson v. McLean Credit\nUnion, 491 U. S. 164, 172–173 (1989). What is more, in 14\nyears Congress has taken no step to modify Smith’s hold\ning, and this long congressional acquiescence “has en\nhanced even the usual precedential force” we accord to our\ninterpretations of statutes, Shepard v. United States, 544\nU. S. 13, 23 (2005).\n   The problem, then, is not with the sturdiness of Smith\nbut with the limited malleability of the language Smith\nconstrued, and policy-driven symmetry cannot turn “re\nceipt-in-trade” into “use.” Whatever the tension between\nthe prior result and the outcome here, law depends on\nrespect for language and would be served better by statu\ntory amendment (if Congress sees asymmetry) than by\n\n——————\n“intended to be used” clause in §924(d)(1) is “use” for purposes of\n§924(c)(1)(A), it would follow that mere possession is use. But that\nwould squarely conflict with our considered and unanimous decision in\nBailey that “ ‘use’ must connote more than mere possession of a fire\narm.” 516 U.

It\nwas amended after Bailey and now prohibits not only\nusing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking\ncrime, but also possessing one “in furtherance of” such a\ncrime. 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A); see n. 3, supra. The\nGovernment is confident that “a drug dealer who takes a\nfirearm in exchange for his drugs generally will be subject\nto prosecution” under this new possession prong. Brief for\nUnited States 27; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 41 (Watson’s case\n“could have been charged as possession”); cf. United States\nv. Cox, 324 F. 3d 77, 83, n. 2 (CA2 2003) (“For defendants\ncharged under §924(c) after [the post-Bailey] amendment,\ntrading drugs for a gun will probably result in . . . posses\nsion [in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime]”). This\nview may or may not prevail, and we do not speak to it\ntoday, but it does leave the appeal to symmetry under-\nwhelming in a contest with the English language, on the\nGovernment’s very terms.\n                      *     *     *\n  Given ordinary meaning and the conventions of English,\nwe hold that a person does not “use” a firearm under\n§924(c)(1)(A) when he receives it in trade for drugs. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case\nis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 552 U.

Distinguishing, as the\nCourt does, between trading a gun for drugs and trading\ndrugs for a gun, for purposes of the 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)\nenhancement, makes scant sense to me. I join the Court’s\njudgment, however, because I am persuaded that the\nCourt took a wrong turn in Smith v. United States, 508\nU. S. 223 (1993), when it held that trading a gun for drugs\nfits within §924(c)(1)’s compass as “us[e]” of a firearm\n“during and in relation to any . . . drug trafficking crime.”\nFor reasons well stated by JUSTICE SCALIA in his dissent\ning opinion in Smith, 508 U. S., at 241, I would read the\nword “use” in §924(c)(1) to mean use as a weapon, not use\nin a bartering transaction. Accordingly, I would overrule\nSmith, and thereby render our precedent both coherent\nand consistent with normal usage. Cf. Henslee v. Union\nPlanters Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 335 U.
