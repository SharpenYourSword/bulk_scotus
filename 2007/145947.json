OMER\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 05–1101. Decided January 16, 2007\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\n  Statement of JUSTICE SCALIA respecting the denial of\nthe petition for writ of certiorari.\n  My dissent in United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U. S.\n___ (2007), warned that the Court’s opinion was “effecting\na revolution in our jurisprudence regarding the require\nments of an indictment,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 4), and\nthat it would provide a license for the Government to\navoid explicating the elements of a criminal offense when\never it feels the “common parlance” of the crime’s name\nevokes them, id., at ___ (slip op., at 1–2). I had not real\nized how quickly that license would be exercised. Barely\n24 hours after we released Resendiz-Ponce, the Solicitor\nGeneral filed a supplemental brief in this case, which\nraises the question (avoided in Resendiz-Ponce) whether\nthe omission of an element of the offense from a federal\nindictment can constitute harmless error. The supple\nmental brief urged us not to grant review in this case for\nthe following reason:\n    “In the wake of the Court’s decision in Resendiz-Ponce\n    . . . it appears that the indictment in this case was not\n    constitutionally deficient. As the Court has noted, it\n    is well settled that the term ‘fraud’ requires a misrep\n    resentation or concealment of material fact . . . just as\n    the term ‘attempt,’ ‘as used in the law for centuries,’\n    encompasses an overt-act requirement, see Resendiz-\n    Ponce, slip op., at 5. The indictment [for fraud] in this\n    case therefore need not have separately alleged that\n2                 UNITED STATES v. OMER\n\n                    Statement of SCALIA, J.\n\n    the scheme at issue (or any statement made in the\n    course of the scheme) was materially false or decep\n    tive.” Supp. Brief for United States 2.\n  That is not the reason I concur in the Court’s decision to\ndeny certiorari. It may, however, be a good reason—\ndepending upon how the crime of fraud fares in our\nnew some-crimes-are-self-defining jurisprudence. Another\nfrontier of law opened by this Court, full of opportunity\nand adventure for lawyers and judges.\n", "precedential_status": "Relating-to", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145947/", "sha1": "3b4f8b8d92f433d6e81d52791dd32b9f64cc544c", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:48"}
