Texas, 552 U. S. ___\n(2008), we concluded that neither the President nor the\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) has the authority to\nrequire Texas to determine whether its violation of the\nVienna Convention prejudiced petitioner. Although I\nagreed with the Court’s judgment, I wrote separately to\nmake clear my view that Texas retained the authority—\nand, indeed, the duty as a matter of international law—to\nremedy the potentially significant breach of the United\nStates’ treaty obligations identified in the President’s\nMemorandum to the Attorney General.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (STEVENS,\nJ., concurring in judgment). “On the other hand, the costs\nof refusing to respect the ICJ’s judgment are significant.\nThe entire Court and the President agree that breach will\njeopardize the United States’ ‘plainly compelling’ interests\nin ‘ensuring the reciprocal observance of the Vienna Con-\nvention, protecting relations with foreign governments,\nand demonstrating commitment to the role of interna-\ntional law.’ ” Ibid. Given these stakes, and given that\npetitioner has been under a death sentence for 14 years,\nwaiting a short time to guarantee that the views of the\nExecutive have been given respectful consideration is only\nprudent. Balancing the honor of the Nation against the\nmodest burden of a short delay to ensure that the breach\nis unavoidable convinces me that the application for a stay\nshould be granted.\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

S. T. 77, T. I. A. S.\nNo. 6820, does not permit execution of this defendant\nwithout a further hearing concerning whether Texas’\nviolation of the Vienna Convention’s obligation to notify\nthe defendant of his right to consult Mexico’s consul con-\nstituted harmless error. Case Concerning Avena and\nOther Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. 61-\n64 (Judgment of Mar. 31). The United States has agreed\n2                   MEDELLIN v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat the ICJ’s judgments will have “binding force . . .\nbetween the parties and in respect of [a] particular case.”\nUnited Nations Charter, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No.\n993 (1945). The President of the United States has con-\ncluded that domestic courts should enforce this particular\nICJ judgment. Memorandum to the Attorney General\n(Feb. 28, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. in Medellín v. Texas,\nNo. 06–984, p. 187a.\n  In Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. ___ (2008) (six to three\nvote), this Court, while recognizing that the United States\nwas bound by treaty to follow the ICJ’s determination as a\nmatter of international law, held that that determination\ndid not automatically bind the courts of the United States\nas a matter of domestic law in the absence of further\ncongressional legislation. Id., at ___. In reaching this\nconclusion the majority, as well as the dissent, recognized\nthat, without the further hearing that the ICJ found nec-\nessary, the execution would violate our international\ntreaty commitments. See id., at ___.\n  Petitioner, who is scheduled to be executed this evening,\nnow asks us to delay the execution in order to give Con-\ngress an opportunity to act to cure the legal defect that the\nCourt found in Medellín. In my view, several factors\ncounsel in favor of delay. First, since this Court handed\ndown Medellín, Mexico has returned to the ICJ requesting\nthis Nation’s compliance with its international obligations;\nand the ICJ has asked that the United States “take all\nmeasures necessary to ensure that [the Mexican nation-\nals] are not executed” unless and until they “receive re-\nview and reconsideration consistent” with the ICJ’s earlier\nAvena decision. See Request for Interpretation of the\nJudgment of 31 March 2004 in the Case Concerning Avena\nand Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2008 I. C. J.\nNo. 139, ¶80 (Order of July 16).\n  Second, legislation has been introduced in Congress\nseeking to provide the legislative approval necessary to\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntransform our international legal obligations into binding\ndomestic law. See Avena Case Implementation Act of\n2008, H. R. 6481, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (referred to\ncommittee, July 14, 2008).\n   Third, prior to Medellín, Congress may not have under-\nstood the legal need for further legislation of this kind.\nThat fact, along with the approaching election, means that\nmore than a few days or weeks are likely necessary for\nCongress to determine whether to enact the proposed\nlegislation.\n   Fourth, to permit this execution to proceed forthwith\nplaces the United States irremediably in violation of in-\nternational law and breaks our treaty promises.\n   Fifth, the President of the United States has empha-\nsized the importance of carrying out our treaty-based\nobligations in this case; this fact, along with the Presi-\ndent’s responsibility for foreign affairs, makes the Execu-\ntive’s views of the matter pertinent.\n   Sixth, different Members of this Court seem to have\nvery different views of what this case is about. In my\nview, the issue in this suit—what the majority describe as\nthe “beginning premise”—is not whether a confession was\nunlawfully obtained from petitioner. Cf. ante, at         .\nRather, the question before us is whether the United\nStates will carry out its international legal obligation to\nenforce the decision of the ICJ. That decision requires a\nfurther hearing to determine whether a conceded violation\nof the Vienna Convention (Texas’ failure to inform peti-\ntioner of his rights under the Vienna Convention) was or\nwas not harmless. Nor do I believe the majority is correct\ninsofar as it implies that Congress has had four years to\nconsider the matter. See ibid. (“Congress has not pro-\ngressed beyond the bare introduction of a bill in the four\nyears since the ICJ ruling and the four months since our\nruling in Medellín v. Texas”). To the contrary, until this\nCourt's decision in Medellín a few months ago, a member\n4                   MEDELLIN v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof Congress might reasonably have believed there was no\nneed for legislation because the relevant treaty provisions\nwere self-executing. It is not realistic to believe Congress\ncould act to provide the necessary legislative approval in\nonly a few weeks’ time.\n   In my view, we should seek the views of the Solicitor\nGeneral (which may well clarify these matters), and we\nshould grant a stay of sufficient length for careful consid-\neration of those views, along with the other briefs and\nmaterials filed in this suit. A sufficient number of Justices\nhaving voted to secure those views (four), it is particularly\ndisappointing that no Member of the majority has proved\nwilling to provide a courtesy vote for a stay so that we can\nconsider the Solicitor General’s view once received. As it\nis, the request will be mooted by petitioner’s execution,\nwhich execution, as I have said, will place this Nation in\nviolation of international law.\n   For the reasons set forth, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145775, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2008/08/05/Medell%C3%ADn_v._Texas.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 554 U.

Texas, 552 U. S. ___\n(2008), we concluded that neither the President nor the\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) has the authority to\nrequire Texas to determine whether its violation of the\nVienna Convention prejudiced petitioner. Although I\nagreed with the Court’s judgment, I wrote separately to\nmake clear my view that Texas retained the authority—\nand, indeed, the duty as a matter of international law—to\nremedy the potentially significant breach of the United\nStates’ treaty obligations identified in the President’s\nMemorandum to the Attorney General.

TEXAS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\npears that Texas has not taken action to address the\nserious national security and foreign policy implications of\nthis suit, I believe we should request the views of the\nSolicitor General, who argued on behalf of the Executive\nBranch in earlier proceedings in the suit, before allowing\nTexas to proceed with the execution.\n   As I explained in my separate opinion in March, the cost\nto Texas of complying with the ICJ judgment “would be\nminimal, particularly given the remote likelihood that the\nviolation of the Vienna Convention actually prejudiced”\nthis petitioner. 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (STEVENS,\nJ., concurring in judgment). “On the other hand, the costs\nof refusing to respect the ICJ’s judgment are significant.\nThe entire Court and the President agree that breach will\njeopardize the United States’ ‘plainly compelling’ interests\nin ‘ensuring the reciprocal observance of the Vienna Con-\nvention, protecting relations with foreign governments,\nand demonstrating commitment to the role of interna-\ntional law.’ ” Ibid. Given these stakes, and given that\npetitioner has been under a death sentence for 14 years,\nwaiting a short time to guarantee that the views of the\nExecutive have been given respectful consideration is only\nprudent. Balancing the honor of the Nation against the\nmodest burden of a short delay to ensure that the breach\nis unavoidable convinces me that the application for a stay\nshould be granted.\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

S. No.\n993 (1945). The President of the United States has con-\ncluded that domestic courts should enforce this particular\nICJ judgment. Memorandum to the Attorney General\n(Feb. 28, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. in Medellín v. Texas,\nNo. 06–984, p. 187a.\n  In Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. ___ (2008) (six to three\nvote), this Court, while recognizing that the United States\nwas bound by treaty to follow the ICJ’s determination as a\nmatter of international law, held that that determination\ndid not automatically bind the courts of the United States\nas a matter of domestic law in the absence of further\ncongressional legislation. Id., at ___. In reaching this\nconclusion the majority, as well as the dissent, recognized\nthat, without the further hearing that the ICJ found nec-\nessary, the execution would violate our international\ntreaty commitments. See id., at ___.\n  Petitioner, who is scheduled to be executed this evening,\nnow asks us to delay the execution in order to give Con-\ngress an opportunity to act to cure the legal defect that the\nCourt found in Medellín. In my view, several factors\ncounsel in favor of delay. First, since this Court handed\ndown Medellín, Mexico has returned to the ICJ requesting\nthis Nation’s compliance with its international obligations;\nand the ICJ has asked that the United States “take all\nmeasures necessary to ensure that [the Mexican nation-\nals] are not executed” unless and until they “receive re-\nview and reconsideration consistent” with the ICJ’s earlier\nAvena decision. See Request for Interpretation of the\nJudgment of 31 March 2004 in the Case Concerning Avena\nand Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2008 I. C. J.\nNo. 139, ¶80 (Order of July 16).\n  Second, legislation has been introduced in Congress\nseeking to provide the legislative approval necessary to\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntransform our international legal obligations into binding\ndomestic law. See Avena Case Implementation Act of\n2008, H. R. 6481, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (referred to\ncommittee, July 14, 2008).\n   Third, prior to Medellín, Congress may not have under-\nstood the legal need for further legislation of this kind.\nThat fact, along with the approaching election, means that\nmore than a few days or weeks are likely necessary for\nCongress to determine whether to enact the proposed\nlegislation.\n   Fourth, to permit this execution to proceed forthwith\nplaces the United States irremediably in violation of in-\nternational law and breaks our treaty promises.\n   Fifth, the President of the United States has empha-\nsized the importance of carrying out our treaty-based\nobligations in this case; this fact, along with the Presi-\ndent’s responsibility for foreign affairs, makes the Execu-\ntive’s views of the matter pertinent.\n   Sixth, different Members of this Court seem to have\nvery different views of what this case is about. In my\nview, the issue in this suit—what the majority describe as\nthe “beginning premise”—is not whether a confession was\nunlawfully obtained from petitioner. Cf. ante, at         .\nRather, the question before us is whether the United\nStates will carry out its international legal obligation to\nenforce the decision of the ICJ. That decision requires a\nfurther hearing to determine whether a conceded violation\nof the Vienna Convention (Texas’ failure to inform peti-\ntioner of his rights under the Vienna Convention) was or\nwas not harmless. Nor do I believe the majority is correct\ninsofar as it implies that Congress has had four years to\nconsider the matter. See ibid. (“Congress has not pro-\ngressed beyond the bare introduction of a bill in the four\nyears since the ICJ ruling and the four months since our\nruling in Medellín v. Texas”). To the contrary, until this\nCourt's decision in Medellín a few months ago, a member\n4                   MEDELLIN v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof Congress might reasonably have believed there was no\nneed for legislation because the relevant treaty provisions\nwere self-executing. It is not realistic to believe Congress\ncould act to provide the necessary legislative approval in\nonly a few weeks’ time.\n   In my view, we should seek the views of the Solicitor\nGeneral (which may well clarify these matters), and we\nshould grant a stay of sufficient length for careful consid-\neration of those views, along with the other briefs and\nmaterials filed in this suit. A sufficient number of Justices\nhaving voted to secure those views (four), it is particularly\ndisappointing that no Member of the majority has proved\nwilling to provide a courtesy vote for a stay so that we can\nconsider the Solicitor General’s view once received. As it\nis, the request will be mooted by petitioner’s execution,\nwhich execution, as I have said, will place this Nation in\nviolation of international law.\n   For the reasons set forth, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145775/", "sha1": "ee9ddce6713d3ef00326639d8ce933d2fb168c98", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2007-073", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:07:39"}
