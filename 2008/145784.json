Fisher, Stanford Law School, Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, Stanford, CA, for petitioner.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case concerns the role of courts in our adversarial system. The specific question presented: May a United States Court of Appeals, acting on its own initiative, order an increase in a defendant's sentence? Petitioner Michael J. Greenlaw was convicted of various offenses relating to drugs and firearms, and was sentenced to imprisonment for 442 months. He appealed urging, <i>inter alia,</i> that his sentence was unreasonably long. After rejecting all of Greenlaw's arguments, the Court of Appeals determined, without Government invitation, that the applicable law plainly required a prison sentence 15 years longer than the term the trial court had imposed. Accordingly, the appeals court instructed the trial court to increase Greenlaw's sentence to 622 months. We hold that, absent a Government appeal or cross-appeal, the sentence Greenlaw received should not have been increased. We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Greenlaw was a member of a gang that, for years, controlled the sale of crack cocaine in a southside Minneapolis neighborhood. See <i>United States v. Carter,</i> 481 F.3d 601, 604 (C.A.8 2007) (case below). To protect their drug stash and to prevent rival dealers from moving into their territory, gang members carried and concealed numerous weapons. See <i>id.,</i> at 605. For his part in the operation, Greenlaw was charged, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, with eight offenses; after trial, he was found guilty on seven of the charges. App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a-17a.</p>\n<p>Among Greenlaw's convictions were two for violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), which prohibits carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime: His first § 924(c) conviction was for carrying a firearm in connection with a crime committed in 1998; his second, for both carrying and discharging a firearm in connection with a crime committed in 1999. App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a. A first conviction for violating § 924(c) carries a mandatory minimum term of 5 years, if the firearm is simply carried. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i). If the firearm is also discharged, the mandatory minimum increases to 10 years. § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii). For \"a second or subsequent conviction,\" however, whether the weapon is only carried or discharged as well, the mandatory minimum jumps to 25 years. § 924(c)(1)(C)(i). Any sentence for violating § 924(c), moreover, must run consecutively to \"any other term of imprisonment,\" including any other conviction under § 924(c). § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the District Court made an error. Over the Government's objection, the court held that a § 924(c) conviction does not count as \"second or subsequent\" when it is \"charged in the same <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2563</span> indictment\" as the defendant's first § 924(c) conviction. App. 59, 61-62. The error was plain because this Court had held, in <i>Deal v. United States,</i> 508 U.S. 129, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), that when a defendant is charged in the same indictment with more than one offense qualifying for punishment under § 924(c), all convictions after the first rank as \"second or subsequent,\" see <i>id.,</i> at 132-137, 113 S.Ct. 1993.</p>\n<p>As determined by the District Court, Greenlaw's sentence included 262 months (without separately counting sentences that ran concurrently) for all his convictions other than the two under § 924(c). For the first § 924(c) offense, the court imposed a 5-year sentence in accord with § 924(c)(1)(A)(i). As to the second § 924(c) conviction, the District Court rejected the Government's request for the 25-year minimum prescribed in § 924(c)(1)(C) for \"second or subsequent\" offenses; instead, it imposed the 10-year term prescribed in § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) for first-time offenses.<sup>[1]</sup> The total sentence thus calculated came to 442 months.</p>\n<p>Greenlaw appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, urging, <i>inter alia,</i> that the appropriate total sentence for all his crimes was 15 years. See 481 F.3d, at 607. The Court of Appeals found no merit in any of Greenlaw's arguments. <i>Id.,</i> at 606-607. Although the Government did not appeal or cross-appeal, <i>id.,</i> at 608, it did note, on brief and at oral argument, the District Court's error: Greenlaw's sentence should have been 15 years longer than the 442 months imposed by the District Court, the Government observed, because his second § 924(c) conviction called for a 25-year (not a 10-year) mandatory minimum consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p>The Government made the observation that the sentence was 15 years too short only to counter Greenlaw's argument that it was unreasonably long. See App. 84-86; Recording of Oral Arg. in <i>United States v. Carter,</i> No. 05-3391, (CA8, Sept. 26, 2006), at 16:53-19:04, available at http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/oralargs/oaFrame.html (as visited June 13, 2008). Having refrained from seeking correction of the District Court's error by pursuing its own appeal, the Government simply urged that Greenlaw's sentence should be affirmed.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Government, while objecting at sentencing to the trial court's erroneous reading of § 924(c)(1)(C), had elected to seek no appellate court alteration of Greenlaw's sentence. 481 F.3d, at 608. Relying on the \"plain-error rule\" stated in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), however, the appeals court held that it had discretion to raise and correct the District Court's error on its own initiative. 481 F.3d, at 608-609. The Court of Appeals therefore vacated the sentence and instructed the District Court \"to impose the [statutorily mandated] consecutive minimum sentence of 25 years.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 611.</p>\n<p>Petitioning for rehearing and rehearing en banc, Greenlaw asked the Eighth Circuit to adopt the position advanced by the Seventh Circuit in <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> 411 F.3d 864 (2005). App. 95. \"By deciding not to take a cross-appeal,\" the Seventh Circuit stated, \"the United States has ensured that [the defendant's] sentence cannot be increased.\" 411 F.3d, at 867. The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing without an opinion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. On remand, as instructed by the Court of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2564</span> Appeals, the District Court increased Greenlaw's sentence by 15 years, yielding a total prison term of 622 months. App. 103-104, 109.</p>\n<p>Greenlaw petitioned for certiorari noting a division among the Circuits on this question: When a defendant unsuccessfully challenges his sentence as too high, may a court of appeals, on its own initiative, increase the sentence absent a cross-appeal by the Government? In response, the Government \"agree[d] with [Greenlaw] that the court of appeals erred in <i>sua sponte</i> remanding the case with directions to enhance petitioner's sentence.\" Brief in Opposition 12. We granted review and invited Jay T. Jorgensen to brief and argue this case, as <i>amicus curiae,</i> in support of the Court of Appeals' judgment. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 829, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008). Mr. Jorgensen accepted the appointment and has well fulfilled his assigned responsibility.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In our adversary system, in both civil and criminal cases, in the first instance and on appeal, we follow the principle of party presentation. That is, we rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties present. To the extent courts have approved departures from the party presentation principle in criminal cases, the justification has usually been to protect a <i>pro se</i> litigant's rights. See <i>Castro v. United States,</i> 540 U.S. 375, 381-383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).<sup>[2]</sup> But as a general rule, \"[o]ur adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 386, 124 S.Ct. 786 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).<sup>[3]</sup> As cogently explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Courts] do not, or should not, sally forth each day looking for wrongs to right. We wait for cases to come to us, and when they do we normally decide only questions presented by the parties. Counsel almost always know a great deal more about their cases than we do, and this must be particularly true of counsel for the United States, the richest, most powerful, and best represented litigant to appear before us.\" <i>United States v. Samuels,</i> 808 F.2d 1298, 1301 (C.A.8 1987) (R. Arnold, J., concurring in denial of reh'g en banc).</blockquote>\n<p>The cross-appeal rule, pivotal in this case, is both informed by, and illustrative of, the party presentation principle. Under that unwritten but longstanding rule, an appellate court may not alter a judgment to benefit a nonappealing party. This Court, from its earliest years, has recognized that it takes a cross-appeal to justify a remedy in favor of an appellee. See <i>McDonough v. Dannery,</i> 3 Dall. 188, 198, 1 L.Ed. 563 (1796). We have called the rule \"inveterate and certain.\" <i>Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co.,</i> 300 U.S. 185, 191, 57 S.Ct. 325, 81 L.Ed. 593 (1937).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2565</span> Courts of Appeals have disagreed, however, on the proper characterization of the cross-appeal rule: Is it \"jurisdictional,\" and therefore exceptionless, or a \"rule of practice,\" and thus potentially subject to judicially created exceptions? Compare, <i>e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Teamsters Local 559,</i> 102 F.3d 21, 28-29 (C.A.1 1996) (cross-appeal rule \"is mandatory and jurisdictional\"), with, <i>e.g., </i><i>American Roll-On Roll-Off Carrier, LLC v. P &amp; O Ports Baltimore, Inc.,</i> 479 F.3d 288, 295-296 (C.A.4 2007) (\"cross-appeal requirement [is] one of practice, [not] a strict jurisdictional requirement\"). Our own opinions contain statements supporting both characterizations. Compare, <i>e.g., </i><i>Morley Constr. Co.,</i> 300 U.S., at 187, 57 S.Ct. 325 (cross-appeal rule defines \"[t]he <i>power</i> of an appellate court to modify a decree\" (emphasis added)), with, <i>e.g., </i><i>Langnes v. Green,</i> 282 U.S. 531, 538, 51 S.Ct. 243, 75 L.Ed. 520 (1931) (cross-appeal requirement is \"a rule of practice which generally has been followed\").</p>\n<p>In <i>El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie,</i> 526 U.S. 473, 480, 119 S.Ct. 1430, 143 L.Ed.2d 635 (1999), we declined to decide \"the theoretical status\" of the cross-appeal rule. It sufficed to point out that the rule was \"firmly entrenched\" and served to advance \"institutional interests in fair notice and repose.\" <i>Ibid.</i> \"Indeed,\" we noted, \"in more than two centuries of repeatedly endorsing the cross-appeal requirement, not a single one of our holdings has ever recognized an exception to the rule.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Following the approach taken in <i>Neztsosie,</i> we again need not type the rule \"jurisdictional\" in order to decide this case.</p>\n<p>Congress has eased our decision by specifying the instances in which the Government may seek appellate review of a sentence, and then adding this clear instruction: Even when a United States Attorney files a notice of appeal with respect to a sentence qualifying for review, \"[t]he Government may not further prosecute [the] appeal without the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3742(b). Congress thus entrusted to named high-ranking officials within the Department of Justice responsibility for determining whether the Government, on behalf of the public, should seek a sentence higher than the one imposed. It would severely undermine Congress' instruction were appellate judges to \"sally forth\" on their own motion, cf. <i>supra,</i> at 2577, to take up errors adverse to the Government when the designated Department of Justice officials have not authorized an appeal from the sentence the trial court imposed.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>This Court has recognized that \"the Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case.\" <i>United States v. Nixon,</i> 418 U.S. 683, 693, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974). We need not decide whether comparable authority and discretion are lodged in the Executive Branch with respect to the pursuit of issues on appeal. We need only recognize that Congress, in § 3742(b), has accorded to the top <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2566</span> representatives of the United States in litigation the prerogative to seek or forgo appellate correction of sentencing errors, however plain they may be. That measure should garner the Judiciary's full respect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In ordering the District Court to add 15 years to Greenlaw's sentence, despite the absence of a cross-appeal by the Government, the Court of Appeals identified Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) as the source of its authority. See 481 F.3d, at 608-609, and n. 5. Rule 52(b) reads: \"A plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court's attention.\" Nothing in the text or history of Rule 52(b) suggests that the rulemakers, in codifying the plain-error doctrine, meant to override the cross-appeal requirement. See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52, 18 U.S.C.App., p. 1664 (describing Rule 52(b) as \"a restatement of existing law\").</p>\n<p>Nor do our opinions support a plain-error exception to the cross-appeal rule. This Court has indeed noticed, and ordered correction of, plain errors not raised by defendants, but we have done so only to benefit a defendant who had himself petitioned the Court for review on other grounds. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Silber v. United States,</i> 370 U.S. 717, 82 S.Ct. 1287, 8 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> In no case have we applied plain-error doctrine to the detriment of a petitioning party. Rather, in every case in which correction of a plain error would result in modification of a judgment to the advantage of a party who did not seek this Court's review, we have invoked the cross-appeal rule to bar the correction.</p>\n<p>In <i>Chittenden v. Brewster,</i> 2 Wall. 191, 17 L.Ed. 839 (1865), for example, the appellants asserted that an award entered in their favor was too small. A prior decision of this Court, however, made it plain that they were entitled to no award at all. See <i>id.,</i> at 195-196 (citing <i>Jones v. Green,</i> 1 Wall. 330, 17 L.Ed. 553 (1864)). But because the appellee had not filed a cross-appeal, the Court left the award undisturbed. See 2 Wall., at 196, 17 L.Ed. 839. <i>Strunk v. United States,</i> 412 U.S. 434, 93 S.Ct. 2260, 37 L.Ed.2d 56 (1973), decided over a century later, is similarly illustrative. There, the Court of Appeals had determined that the defendant was denied his right to a speedy trial, but held that the proper remedy was reduction of his sentence as compensation for the delay, not dismissal of the charges against him. As petitioner in this Court, the defendant sought review of the remedial order. See <i>id.,</i> at 435, 93 S.Ct. 2260. The Court suggested that there may have been no speedy trial violation, as \"it seem[ed] clear that [the defendant] was responsible for a large part of the ... delay.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 436, 93 S.Ct. 2260. But because the Government had not raised the issue by cross-petition, we considered the case on the premise that the defendant had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right, <i>id.,</i> at 437, 93 S.Ct. 2260, and ruled that dismissal of the indictment was the proper remedy, <i>id.,</i> at 439-440, 93 S.Ct. 2260.</p>\n<p>Even if there might be circumstances in which it would be proper for an appellate court to initiate plain-error review, sentencing errors that the Government refrained from pursuing would not fit the bill. Heightening the generally applicable party presentation principle, Congress has provided a dispositive direction regarding sentencing errors that aggrieve the Government. In § 3742(b), as earlier explained, see <i>supra,</i> at 2576-2577, Congress designated leading Department of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2567</span> Justice officers as the decisionmakers responsible for determining when Government pursuit of a sentencing appeal is in order. Those high officers, Congress recognized, are best equipped to determine where the Government's interest lies. Rule 52(b) does not invite appellate court interference with their assessment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p><i>Amicus</i> supporting the Eighth Circuit's judgment links the argument based on Rule 52(b) to a similar argument based on 28 U.S.C. § 2106. See Brief for <i>Amicus Curiae</i> by Invitation of the Court 40-43 (hereinafter Jorgensen Brief). Section 2106 states that federal appellate courts \"may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment ... lawfully brought before it for review.\" For substantially the same reasons that Rule 52(b) does not override the cross-appeal requirement, § 2106 does not do so either. Section 2106 is not limited to plain errors, much less to sentencing errors in criminal casesit applies to all cases, civil and criminal, and to all errors. Were the construction <i>amicus</i> offers correct, § 2106 would displace the cross-appeal rule cross-the-board. The authority described in § 2106, we have observed, \"must be exercised consistent with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as interpreted by this Court.\" <i>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc.,</i> 546 U.S. 394, 402-403, n. 4, 126 S.Ct. 980, 163 L.Ed.2d 974 (2006). No different conclusion is warranted with respect to the \"inveterate and certain\" cross-appeal rule. <i>Morley Constr. Co.,</i> 300 U.S., at 191, 57 S.Ct. 325.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In defending the Court of Appeals judgment, <i>amicus</i> places heavy weight on an argument pinned not to Rule 52(b) or 28 U.S.C. § 2106, but to the text of 18 U.S.C. § 3742, the Criminal Code provision governing appellate review of criminal sentences. As <i>amicus</i> reads § 3742, once either party appeals a sentence, the Court of Appeals must remand \"any illegal sentence regardless of whether the remand hurts or helps the appealing party.\" Jorgensen Brief 9. Congress so directed, <i>amicus</i> argues, by instructing that, upon review of the record, a court of appeals \"<i>shall determine</i> ... whether the sentence was imposed in violation of law,\" § 3742(e) (emphasis added), and \"<i>shall remand</i>\" if it so determines, § 3742(f)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). See Jorgensen Brief 10-11, and n. 3.</p>\n<p><i>Amicus</i> makes a further text-based observation. He notes that § 3742(f)(2)the provision covering sentences \"outside the applicable [G]uideline range\"calls for a remand only where a departure from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines harms the appellant. In contrast, <i>amicus</i> emphasizes, § 3742(f)(1)the provision controlling sentences imposed \"in violation of law\" and Guideline application errorscontains no such appellant-linked limitation. The inference <i>amicus</i> draws from this distinction is that Congress intended to override the cross-appeal rule for sentences controlled by § 3742(f)(1), <i>i.e.,</i> those imposed \"in violation of law\" (or incorrectly applying the Guidelines), but not for Guideline departure errors, the category covered by § 3742(f)(2). See <i>id.,</i> at 14-15.</p>\n<p>This novel construction of § 3742, presented for the first time in the brief <i>amicus</i> filed in this Court,<sup>[5]</sup> is clever and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2568</span> complex, but ultimately unpersuasive. Congress enacted § 3742 in 1984. See Sentencing Reform Act, § 213(a), 98 Stat. 2011. At that time, the cross-appeal requirement was a solidly grounded rule of appellate practice. See <i>supra,</i> at 2573-2574. The inference properly drawn, we think, is that Congress was aware of the cross-appeal rule, and framed § 3742 expecting that the new provision would operate in harmony with the \"inveterate and certain\" bar to enlarging judgments in favor of an appellee who filed no cross-appeal. Cf. <i>Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino,</i> 501 U.S. 104, 108, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 115 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991) (\"Congress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles.\").</p>\n<p>Congress indicated awareness of the cross-appeal rule in an earlier measure, the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (OCCA), Pub.L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, which provided for review of sentences of \"dangerous special offenders.\" See § 1001(a), <i>id.,</i> at 948-951. For that Act, Congress crafted an explicit exception to the cross-appeal rule. It ordered that an appeal of a sentence taken by the Government \"shall be deemed the taking of [an appeal] by the defendant.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 950. But the \"deeming\" ran in only one direction: \"[A] sentence may be made more severe\" OCCA provided, \"only on review... taken by the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 950-951.<sup>[6]</sup> When Congress repealed this provision and, in § 3742, broadly provided for appellate review of sentences, it did not similarly express in the new text any exception to the cross-appeal rule. In short, Congress formulated a precise exception to the cross-appeal rule when that was its intention. Notably, the exception Congress legislated did not expose a defendant to a higher sentence in response to his own appeal. Congress spoke plainly in the 1970 legislation, leaving nothing for a court to infer. We therefore see no reason to read the current statute in the inventive manner <i>amicus</i> proposes, inferring so much from so little.</p>\n<p><i>Amicus'</i> reading of § 3742, moreover, would yield some strange results. We note two, in particular. Under his construction, § 3742 would give with one hand what it takes away with the other: § 3742(b) entrusts to certain Government officials the decision whether to appeal an illegally low sentence, see <i>supra,</i> at 2574; but according to <i>amicus,</i> §§ 3742(e) and (f) would instruct appellate courts to correct an error of that order on their own initiative, thereby trumping the officials' decision. We resist attributing to Congress an intention to render a statute so internally inconsistent. Cf. <i>Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Board of Equalization of S. D.,</i> 480 U.S. 123, 133, 107 S.Ct. 1038, 94 L.Ed.2d 112 (1987) (\"The illogical results of applying [a proffered] interpretation ... argue strongly against the conclusion that Congress intended th[o]se results[.]\"). Further, the construction proposed by <i>amicus</i> would draw a puzzling distinction between incorrect applications of the Sentencing Guidelines, controlled by § 3742(f)(1), and erroneous departures from the Guidelines, covered by § 3742(f)(2). The latter would be subject to the cross-appeal rule, the former would not. We do not see why Congress would want to differentiate Guidelines decisions this way.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2569</span> D</h2>\n<p>In increasing Greenlaw's sentence by 15 years on its own initiative, the Eighth Circuit did not advert to the procedural rules setting deadlines for launching appeals and cross-appeals. Unyielding in character, these rules may be seen as auxiliary to the cross-appeal rule and the party presentation principle served by that rule. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) provides that \"[a]n appeal permitted by law... may be taken <i>only by filing a notice of appeal</i> ... within the [prescribed] time.\" (Emphasis added.) Complementing Rule 3(a)(1), Rule 4(b)(1)(B)(ii) instructs that, when the Government has the right to cross-appeal in a criminal case, its notice \"<i>must be filed</i> ... within 30 days after ... the filing of a notice of appeal by any defendant.\" (Emphasis added.) The filing time for a notice of appeal or cross-appeal, Rule 4(b)(4) states, may be extended \"for a period not to exceed 30 days.\" Rule 26(b) bars any extension beyond that time.</p>\n<p>The firm deadlines set by the Appellate Rules advance the interests of the parties and the legal system in fair notice and finality. Thus a defendant who appeals but faces no cross-appeal can proceed anticipating that the appellate court will not enlarge his sentence. And if the Government files a cross-appeal, the defendant will have fair warning, well in advance of briefing and argument, that pursuit of his appeal exposes him to the risk of a higher sentence. Given early warning, he can tailor his arguments to take account of that risk. Or he can seek the Government's agreement to voluntary dismissal of the competing appeals, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b), before positions become hardened during the hours invested in preparing the case for appellate court consideration.</p>\n<p>The strict time limits on notices of appeal and cross-appeal would be undermined, in both civil and criminal cases, if an appeals court could modify a judgment in favor of a party who filed no notice of appeal. In a criminal prosecution, moreover, the defendant would appeal at his peril, with nothing to alert him that, on his own appeal, his sentence would be increased until the appeals court so decreed. In this very case, Greenlaw might have made different strategic decisions had he known soon after filing his notice of appeal that he risked a 15-year increase in an already lengthy sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>We note that nothing we have said in this opinion requires courts to modify their current practice in so-called \"sentencing package cases.\" Those cases typically involve multicount indictments and a successful attack by a defendant on some but not all of the counts of conviction. The appeals court, in such instances, may vacate the entire sentence on all counts so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan to assure that it remains adequate to satisfy the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). In remanded cases, the Government relates, trial courts have imposed a sentence on the remaining counts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2570</span> longer than the sentence originally imposed on those particular counts, but yielding an aggregate sentence no longer than the aggregate sentence initially imposed. See Brief for United States 23, n. 11 (citing, <i>inter alia, </i><i>United States v. Pimienta-Redondo,</i> 874 F.2d 9 (C.A.1 1989) (en banc)). Thus the defendant ultimately may gain nothing from his limited success on appeal, but he will also lose nothing, as he will serve no more time than the trial court originally ordered.</p>\n<p>The practice the Government describes is not at odds with the cross-appeal rule, which stops appellate judges from adding years to a defendant's sentence on their own initiative. It simply ensures that the sentence \"`will suit not merely the offense but the individual defendant.'\" <i>Pimienta-Redondo,</i> 874 F.2d, at 14 (quoting <i>Wasman v. United States,</i> 468 U.S. 559, 564, 104 S.Ct. 3217, 82 L.Ed.2d 424 (1984)). And the assessment will be made by the sentencing judge exercising discretion, not by an appellate panel ruling on an issue of law no party tendered to the court.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>This is not a \"sentencing package\" case. Greenlaw was unsuccessful on all his appellate issues. There was no occasion for the Court of Appeals to vacate his sentence and no warrant, in the absence of a cross-appeal, to order the addition of 15 years to his sentence.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with Justice ALITO that the cross-appeal requirement is simply a rule <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2571</span> of practice for appellate courts, rather than a limitation on their power, and I therefore join Parts I-III of his opinion. Moreover, as a general matter, I would leave application of the rule to the courts of appeals, with our power to review their discretion \"seldom to be called into action.\" <i>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,</i> 340 U.S. 474, 490, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). But since this case is now before us, I would consider whether the Court of Appeals here acted properly. Primarily for the reasons stated by the majority in footnote 9 of its opinion, I believe that the court abused its discretion in <i>sua sponte</i> increasing petitioner's sentence. Our precedent precludes the creation of an exception to the cross-appeal requirement based solely on the obviousness of the lower court's error. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Chittenden v. Brewster,</i> 2 Wall. 191, 195-196, 17 L.Ed. 839 (1865). And I cannot see how the interests of justice are significantly disserved by permitting petitioner's release from prison at roughly age 62, after almost 37 years behind bars, as opposed to age 77.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, with whom Justice STEVENS joins, and with whom Justice BREYER joins as to Parts I, II, and III, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent because I view the cross-appeal requirement as a rule of appellate practice. It is akin to the rule that courts invoke when they decline to consider arguments that the parties have not raised. Both rules rest on premises about the efficient use of judicial resources and the proper role of the tribunal in an adversary system. Both are sound and should generally be followed. But just as the courts have made them, the courts may make exceptions to them, and I do not understand why a reviewing court should enjoy less discretion to correct an error <i>sua sponte</i> than it enjoys to raise and address an argument <i>sua sponte.</i> Absent congressional direction to the contrary, and subject to our limited oversight as a supervisory court, we should entrust the decision to initiate error correction to the sound discretion of the courts of appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Before laying out my view in more detail, I must first address the question whether federal courts have subject-matter jurisdiction to enlarge an appellee's judgment in the absence of a cross-appeal. Because the Court would not recognize any exceptions to the cross-appeal requirement when the defendant appeals his sentence, it does not decide that question. See <i>ante,</i> at 2565. I must confront it, though I do not regard it as a substantial question. The cross-appeal requirement seems to me a prime example of a \"`rule of practice,' subject to exceptions, not an unqualified limit on the power of appellate courts.\" <i>El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie,</i> 526 U.S. 473, 480, 119 S.Ct. 1430, 143 L.Ed.2d 635 (1999). While a court should generally enforce the cross-appeal requirement, a departure from it would not divest the court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>This Court has never addressed whether an appellate court's jurisdiction to enlarge a judgment in favor of an appellee is contingent on a duly filed cross-appeal. The majority's contention that \"[o]ur own opinions contain statements supporting\" the \"`jurisdictional'\" characterization of the requirement, <i>ante,</i> at 2564-2565, relies on a misreading of that precedent. The Court may have previously characterized the cross-appeal requirement as limiting \"`[t]he <i>power</i> of an appellate court to modify a decree,'\" <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co.,</i> 300 U.S. 185, 187, 57 S.Ct. 325, 81 L.Ed. 593 (1937)), but it does not follow that jurisdiction is conditioned on a properly filed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2572</span> cross-appeal. A court may lack the power to do something for reasons other than want of jurisdiction, and a rule can be inflexible without being jurisdictional. See <i>Eberhart v. United States,</i> 546 U.S. 12, 19, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>The jurisdiction of the courts of appeals is fixed by Congress. See <i>Bowles v. Russell,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2364-2365, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007); <i>Ankenbrandt v. Richards,</i> 504 U.S. 689, 698, 112 S.Ct. 2206, 119 L.Ed.2d 468 (1992) (\"`[T]he judicial power of the United States ... is (except in enumerated instances, applicable exclusively to this Court) dependent for its distribution and organization, and for the modes of its exercise, entirely upon the action of Congress'\" (quoting <i>Cary v. Curtis,</i> 3 How. 236, 245, 11 L.Ed. 576 (1845))). If Congress wants to withhold from the courts of appeals the power to decide questions that expand the rights of nonappealing parties, it may do so. See U.S. Const., Art. III, § 1 (authorizing Congress to establish the lower courts and, by corollary, to fix their jurisdiction); <i>Kontrick v. Ryan,</i> 540 U.S. 443, 452, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004) (\"Only Congress may determine a lower federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction\"). The jurisdictional question thus reduces to whether Congress intended to make a cross-appeal a condition precedent to the appellate court's jurisdiction to enlarge a judgment in favor of a nonappealing party.</p>\n<p>As always with such questions, the text of the relevant statute provides the best evidence of congressional intent. The relevant statute in this case is 18 U.S.C. § 3742 (2000 ed. and Supp. V). Section 3742(a) authorizes a criminal defendant to \"file a notice of appeal\" to review a sentence that was, among other possibilities, \"imposed in violation of law.\" <i>E.g.,</i> § 3742(a)(1). Section 3742(b) provides parallel authority for the Government to \"file a notice of appeal\" to review unlawful sentences. <i>E.g.,</i> § 3742(b)(1). The statute conditions the Government's authority to further prosecute its appeal on \"the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.\" § 3742(b).</p>\n<p>Nothing in this language remotely suggests that a court of appeals lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to increase a defendant's sentence in the absence of a cross-appeal by the Government. In fact, the statute does not even mention cross-appeals. It separately authorizes either party to \"file a notice of appeal,\" but it never suggests that the reviewing court's power is limited to correcting errors for the benefit of the appealing party. If anything, it suggests the opposite. Without qualifying the appellate court's power in any way, § 3742(e) instructs the court to determine, among other things, whether the sentence was \"imposed in violation of law.\" § 3742(e)(1). And while § 3742(f)(2) limits the action that a court of appeals can take depending on which party filed the appeal, compare § 3742(f)(2)(A) (sentences set aside as \"too high\" if defendant filed) with § 3742(f)(2)(B) (sentences set aside as \"too low\" if Government filed), no such limitation appears in § 3742(f)(1). That paragraph requires a court of appeals simply to set aside any sentence \"imposed in violation of law or imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Since a cross-appeal has no effect on the appellate court's subject-matter jurisdiction, the cross-appeal requirement is best characterized as a rule of practice. It is a rule created by the courts to serve interests that are important to the Judiciary. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2573</span> The Court identifies two of these interests: notice to litigants and finality. <i>Ante,</i> at 2565-2566; see also <i>Neztsosie, supra,</i> at 480, 119 S.Ct. 1430. One might add that the cross-appeal requirement also serves a third interest: the appellate court's interest in being adequately briefed on the issues that it decides. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 28.1(c) and Advisory Committee's Notes, 28 U.S.C.App., pp. 615-616. Although these are substantial interests in the abstract, I question how well an inflexible cross-appeal requirement serves them.</p>\n<p><i>Notice.</i> With respect to notice, the benefits of an unyielding cross-appeal requirement are insubstantial. When the Government files a notice of cross-appeal, the defendant is alerted to the possibility that his or her sentence may be increased as a result of the appellate decision. But if the cross-appeal rule is, as I would hold, a strong rule of practice that should be followed in all but exceptional instances, the Government's failure to file a notice of cross-appeal would mean in the vast majority of cases that the defendant thereafter ran little risk of an increased sentence. And the rare cases where that possibility arose would generally involve errors so plain that no conceivable response by the defendant could alter the result. It is not unreasonable to consider an appealing party to be on notice as to such serious errors of law in his favor. And while there may be rare cases in which the existence of such a legal error would come as a complete surprise to the defendant or in which argument from the parties would be of assistance to the court, the solution to such a problem is not to eliminate the courts of appeals' authority to correct egregious errors. Rather, the appropriate response is for the court of appeals to request supplemental briefing orif it deems that insufficientsimply to refuse to exercise its authority. Cf. <i>Irizarry v. United States,</i> 553 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2198, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2008 WL 2369164, *5-6 (2008). In short, the Court's holding does not increase the substance of the notice that a defendant receives; it merely accelerates that notice by at most a few weeks in a very small number of cases.</p>\n<p>The Court contends that \"[g]iven early warning, [the defendant] can tailor his arguments to take account of [the risk of a higher sentence] ... [o]r he can seek the Government's agreement to voluntary dismissal of the competing appeals.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2569 (citing Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b)). But the Court does not explain how a notice of cross-appeal, a boilerplate document, helps the defendant \"tailor his arguments.\" Whether the cross-appeal rule is ironclad, as the Court believes, or simply a strong rule of practice, a defendant who wishes to appeal his or her sentence is always free to seek the Government's commitment not to cross-appeal or to terminate a cross-appeal that the Government has already taken. Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b).</p>\n<p><i>Finality.</i> An inflexible cross-appeal rule also does little to further the interest of the parties and the Judiciary in the finality of decisions. An appellate court's decision to grant a nonappealing party additional relief does not interrupt a long, undisturbed slumber. The error's repose begins no earlier than the deadline for filing a cross-appeal, and it ends as soon as the reviewing court issues its opinionand often much sooner. Here, for example, the slumber was broken when the Government identified the error in its brief as appellee. See Brief for United States 5.</p>\n<p><i>Orderly Briefing.</i> I do not doubt that adversarial briefing improves the quality of appellate decisionmaking, but it hardly follows that appellate courts should be denied the authority to correct errors that seriously prejudice nonappealing parties. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2574</span> Under my interpretation of the cross-appeal rule, a court of appeals would not be obligated to address errors that are prejudicial to a nonappealing party; a court of appeals would merely have the authority to do so in appropriate cases. If a court of appeals noticed such an error and concluded that it was appropriate to address the issue, the court could, if it wished, order additional briefing. If, on the other hand, the court concluded that the issue was not adequately addressed by the briefs filed by the parties in the ordinary course and that additional briefing would interfere with the efficient administration of the court's work, the court would not be required to decide the issue. Therefore, I do not see how the courts of appeals' interest in orderly briefing is furthered by denying those courts the discretionary authority to address important issues that they find it appropriate to decide.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the inflexible cross-appeal rule that the Court adopts may disserve the interest in judicial efficiency in some cases. For example, correcting an error that prejudiced a nonappealing defendant on direct review might obviate the need for a collateral attack. Cf. <i>Granberry v. Greer,</i> 481 U.S. 129, 134, 107 S.Ct. 1671, 95 L.Ed.2d 119 (1987) (allowing the Court of Appeals to address the merits of an unexhausted habeas corpus petition if \"the interests of comity and federalism will be better served by addressing the merits forthwith [than] by requiring a series of additional state and district court proceedings before reviewing the merits of the petitioner's claim\"); <i>Munaf v. Geren,</i> 553 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2207, ___, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2008 WL 2369260, *12 (2008) (recognizing \"occasions ... when it is appropriate to proceed further and address the merits\" of a habeas corpus petition rather than reverse and remand on threshold matters). Because the reviewing court is in the best position to decide whether a departure from the cross-appeal rule would be efficient, rigid enforcement of that rule is more likely to waste judicial resources than to conserve them.</p>\n<p>In sum, the Court exaggerates the interests served by the cross-appeal requirement. At the same time, it overlooks an important interest that the rule disserves: the interest of the Judiciary and the public in correcting grossly prejudicial errors of law that undermine confidence in our legal system. We have repeatedly stressed the importance of that interest, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 736-737, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty.,</i> 464 U.S. 501, 507, 104 S.Ct. 819, 78 L.Ed.2d 629 (1984); <i>New York Central R. Co. v. Johnson,</i> 279 U.S. 310, 318, 49 S.Ct. 300, 73 L.Ed. 706 (1929), and it has justified departures from our traditional adversary framework in other contexts. The Court mentions one of those contexts, see <i>ante,</i> at 2564 (<i>pro se</i> litigation), but there are others that deserve mention.</p>\n<p>The most well-known is plain-error review. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) authorizes reviewing courts to correct \"[a] plain error that affects substantial rights ... even though it was not brought to the court's attention.\" Although I agree with the Court that this Rule does not independently justify the Eighth Circuit's decision, see <i>ante,</i> at 2565-2566, I believe that the Rule's underlying policy sheds some light on the issue before us. We have explained that courts may rely on Rule 52(b) to correct only those plain errors that \"`seriously affec[t] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" <i>Olano, supra,</i> at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quoting <i>United States v. Atkinson,</i> 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)). We have thus recognized that preservation of the \"fairness, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2575</span> integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\" may sometimes justify a departure from the traditional adversarial framework of issue presentation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the closest analogue to the cross-appeal requirement is the rule of appellate practice that restrains reviewing courts from addressing arguments that the parties have not made. Courts typically invoke this rule to avoid resolving a case based on an unaired argument, even if the argument could change the outcome. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Santiago v. Rumsfeld,</i> 425 F.3d 549, 552, n. 1 (C.A.9 2005); <i>United States v. Cervini,</i> 379 F.3d 987, 994, n. 5 (C.A.10 2004). But courts also recognize that the rule is not inflexible, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Santiago, supra,</i> at 552, n. 1, and sometimes they depart from it, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc.,</i> 508 U.S. 439, 448, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993) (\"After giving the parties ample opportunity to address the issue, the Court of Appeals acted without any impropriety in refusing to accept what in effect was a stipulation on a question of law\" (citing <i>Swift &amp; Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co.,</i> 243 U.S. 281, 289, 37 S.Ct. 287, 61 L.Ed. 722 (1917))); <i>United States v. Moyer,</i> 282 F.3d 1311, 1317-1318 (C.A.10 2002); <i>Dorris v. Absher,</i> 179 F.3d 420, 425-426 (C.A.6 1999).</p>\n<p>A reviewing court will generally address an argument <i>sua sponte</i> only to correct the most patent and serious errors. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 426 (concluding that the error, if overlooked, would result in \"a miscarriage of justice\"); <i>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. v. Federal Power Comm'n,</i> 510 F.2d 656, 662 (C.A.D.C.1974) (balancing \"considerations of judicial orderliness and efficiency against the need for the greatest possible accuracy in judicial decisionmaking\"). Because the prejudicial effect of the error and the impact of error correction on judicial resources are matters best determined by the reviewing court, the court's decision to go beyond the arguments made by the parties is committed to its sound discretion. See <i>United States Nat. Bank of Ore., supra,</i> at 448, 113 S.Ct. 2173 (reviewing an appellate court's decision to address an argument <i>sua sponte</i> for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p>This authority provides a good model for our decision in this case. The Court has not persuaded me that the interests at stake when a reviewing court awards a nonappealing party additional relief are qualitatively different from the interests at stake when a reviewing court raises an issue <i>sua sponte.</i> Authority on the latter point recognizes that the interest of the public and the Judiciary in correcting grossly prejudicial errors of law may sometimes outweigh other interests normally furthered by fidelity to our adversarial tradition. I would recognize the same possibility here. And just as reviewing courts enjoy discretion to decide for themselves when to raise and decide arguments <i>sua sponte,</i> I would grant them substantial latitude to decide when to enlarge an appellee's judgment in the absence of a cross-appeal.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The approach I advocate is not out of step with our precedent. The Court has never decided whether the cross-appeal requirement is \"subject to exceptions [or] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2576</span> an unqualified limit on the power of appellate courts.\" <i>Neztsosie,</i> 526 U.S., at 480, 119 S.Ct. 1430. That question was reserved in <i>Neztsosie, ibid.,</i> even as the Court recognized that lower courts had reached different conclusions, see <i>id.,</i> at 480, n. 2, 119 S.Ct. 1430. I would simply confirm what our precedent had assumed: that there are exceptional circumstances when it is appropriate for a reviewing court to correct an error for the benefit of a party that has not cross-appealed the decision below.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Court has already reached the very result that it claims to disavow today. We have long held that a sentencing court confronted with new circumstances may impose a stiffer sentence on remand than the defendant received prior to a successful appeal. See <i>Chaffin v. Stynchcombe,</i> 412 U.S. 17, 23, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973); <i>North Carolina v. Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. 711, 719-720, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), overruled on other grounds, <i>Alabama v. Smith,</i> 490 U.S. 794, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989). The Court makes no effort to explain the analytical difference between those cases and this one. If a sentencing court may rely on new circumstances to justify a longer sentence on remand, why cannot one of the new circumstances be the court's discovery (by dint of appellate review) that its first sentence was based on an error of law?<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Even today, the Court refuses to decide whether the cross-appeal requirement admits of exceptions in appropriate cases. While calling the rule \"`inveterate and certain,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 2564-2565 (quoting <i>Morley Constr. Co.,</i> 300 U.S., at 191, 57 S.Ct. 325), the Court allows that \"there might be circumstances in which it would be proper for an appellate court to initiate plain-error review,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2566-2567; see also <i>ante,</i> at 2564, n. 2. The Court's mandate is limited to a single class of cases sentencing appeals, and then only when the appeal is brought by the Government.</p>\n<p>The Court justifies the asymmetry in its decision by pointing to 18 U.S.C. § 3742(b), which provides that \"[t]he Government may not further prosecute [the] appeal without the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.\" According to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2577</span> the majority, \"[i]t would severely undermine Congress' instruction were appellate judges to `sally forth' on their own motion to take up errors adverse to the Government when the designated Department of Justice officials have not authorized an appeal from the sentence the trial court imposed.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2565 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The problem with this argument is that § 3742(b) does not apportion authority over sentencing appeals between the Executive and Judicial Branches. By its terms, § 3742(b) simply apportions that authority <i>within</i> an executive department. It provides that the \"[t]he Government\" may not \"prosecute\" the appeal without approval from one of the listed officials. It says nothing about the power of the courts to correct error in the absence of a Government appeal. Had Congress intended to restrict the power of the courts, the statute would not stop \"[t]he Government\" from \"prosecut[ing]\" unauthorized appeals; instead, it would stop \"the Court of Appeals\" from \"deciding\" them.</p>\n<p>The design that the Court imputes to the drafters of § 3742(b) is inconsistent with the text in another important respect. Suppose that the District Court imposes a sentence below the range set forth in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and the Government files an authorized appeal on the ground that the sentence is unreasonable. Suppose further that the reviewing court discovers, to the surprise of both parties, that the District Court made a further error by overlooking a mandatory minimum to which the defendant was subject. The mandatory minimum would raise the defendant's sentence beyond what even the Government had wanted. Under the majority's theory, see <i>ante,</i> at 2565, the reviewing court should not remand for imposition of the mandatory minimum, since the decision to seek the higher sentence belonged to the Government alone. But that conclusion is plainly at odds with the text of the statute, which imposes no limits on sentencing review once the named officials have signed off on the appeal.</p>\n<p>Section 3742(b)'s limited effect on sentencing review implies that the statute was not designed to prevent judicial encroachment on the prerogatives of the Executive. It is more likely that Congress wanted to withhold from the Executive the power to force the courts of appeals to entertain Government appeals that are not regarded as sufficiently important by the leadership of the Department of Justice. Allowing the courts of appeals, in their discretion, to remedy errors not raised in a cross-appeal in no way trenches on the authority of the Executive. Section 3742(b) may have also been designed to serve the Executive's institutional interests. Congress may have wanted to ensure that the Government maintained a consistent legal position across different sentencing appeals. Or perhaps Congress wanted to maximize the impact of the Government's sentencing appeals by giving high-level officials the authority to nix meritless or marginal ones. These institutional interests of the Executive do not undermine the Judiciary's authority to correct unlawful sentences in the absence of a Government appeal, and they do not justify the Court's decision today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>For the reasons given above, I would hold that the courts of appeals enjoy the discretion to correct error <i>sua sponte</i> for the benefit of nonappealing parties. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2578</span> Court errs in vacating the judgment of the Eighth Circuit, and I respectfully dissent.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The court added 10 years rather than 5 based on the jury's finding that the firearm Greenlaw carried in connection with the second § 924(c) offense had been discharged. See App. 44-45, 59-60.</p>\n<p>[2]  Because this case does not present the issue, we take no position on whether correction of an error prejudicial to a nonappealing criminal defendant might be justified as a measure to obviate the need for a collateral attack. See <i>post,</i> at 2573-2574.</p>\n<p>[3]  Cf. Kaplan, Civil ProcedureReflections on the Comparison of Systems, 9 Buffalo L.Rev. 409, 431-432 (1960) (U.S. system \"exploits the free-wheeling energies of counsel and places them in adversary confrontation before a detached judge\"; \"German system puts its trust in a judge of paternalistic bent acting in cooperation with counsel of somewhat muted adversary zeal\").</p>\n<p>[4]  The dissent reads § 3742(b) not as a restraint on <i>sua sponte</i> error correction by appellate courts, but simply as apportioning \"authority <i>within</i> an executive department.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2576-2577; see <i>post,</i> at 2577 (\"[P]erhaps Congress wanted to ... giv[e] high-level officials the authority to nix meritless or marginal [sentencing appeals].\"). A statute is hardly needed to establish the authority of the Attorney General and Solicitor General over local U.S. Attorneys on matters relating to the prosecution of criminal cases, including appeals of sentences. It seems unlikely, moreover, that Congress, having lodged discretion in top-ranking Department of Justice officers, meant that discretion to be shared with more than 200 appellate judges.</p>\n<p>[5]  An appellee or respondent may defend the judgment below on a ground not earlier aired. See <i>United States v. American Railway Express Co.,</i> 265 U.S. 425, 435, 44 S.Ct. 560, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1924) (\"[T]he appellee may, without taking a cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record[.]\").</p>\n<p>[6]  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970, § 409(h), 84 Stat. 1268-1269, contained matching instructions applicable to \"dangerous special drug offender[s].\" The prescriptions in both Acts were replaced by § 3742. See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, §§ 212(2), 213(a), 219, 98 Stat. 1987, 2011, 2027.</p>\n<p>[7]  In rejecting the interpretation of §§ 3742(e) and (f) proffered by <i>amicus,</i> we take no position on the extent to which the remedial opinion in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), excised those provisions. Compare <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2471, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (STEVENS, J., concurring) (<i>Booker</i> excised only the portions of § 3742(e) that required <i>de novo</i> review by courts of appeals), with 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2483 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (<i>Booker</i> excised <i>all</i> of §§ 3742(e) and (f)). See also <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 578, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion, whatever it held, cannot be followed).</p>\n<p>[8]  The dissent suggests that our reading of the cross-appeal rule is anomalous because it could bar a court of appeals from correcting an error that would increase a defendant's sentence, but after a \"successful\" appeal the district court itself could rely on that same error to increase the sentence. See <i>post,</i> at 2576-2577, and n. 2. The cross-appeal rule, we of course agree, does not confine the trial court. But default and forfeiture doctrines do. It would therefore be hard to imagine a case in which a district court, after a court of appeals vacated a criminal sentence, could properly increase the sentence based on an error the appeals court left uncorrected because of the cross-appeal rule. What of cases remanded post-<i>Booker</i> on defendants' appeals, the dissent asks? <i>Post,</i> at 2576, n. 2. In those cases, defendants invited and received precisely the relief they sought, and the Sixth Amendment required. Neither the cross-appeal rule nor default and forfeiture had any role to play.</p>\n<p>[9]  For all its spirited argument, the dissent recognizes the narrow gap between its core position and the Court's. The cross-appeal rule, rooted in the principle of party presentation, the dissent concedes, should hold sway in the \"vast majority of cases.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2573. Does this case qualify as the \"rare\" exception to the \"strong rule of practice\" the dissent advocates? See <i>ibid.</i> Greenlaw was sentenced to imprisonment for 442 months. The Government might have chosen to insist on 180 months more, but it elected not to do so. Was the error so \"grossly prejudicial,\" <i>post,</i> at 2574, 2575-2576, so harmful to our system of justice, see <i>post,</i> at 2574-2575, as to warrant <i>sua sponte</i> correction? By what standard is the Court of Appeals to make such an assessment? Without venturing to answer these questions, see <i>post,</i> at 2578, n. 3, the dissent would simply \"entrust the decision to initiate error correction to the sound discretion of the courts of appeals,\" <i>post,</i> at 2571. The \"strong rule\" thus may be broken whenever the particular three judges composing the appellate panel see the sentence as a \"wron[g] to right.\" See <i>supra,</i> at 2573 (internal quotation marks omitted). The better answer, consistent with our jurisprudence, as reinforced by Congress, entrusts \"the decision [whether] to initiate error correction\" in this matter to top counsel for the United States. See <i>supra,</i> at 2574.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Court argues that petitioner's original sentence was neither so fundamentally unfair nor so harmful to our system of justice as to warrant <i>sua sponte</i> correction by the Court of Appeals. <i>Ante,</i> at 2570, n. 9. But these considerations, which may well support a conclusion that the Court of Appeals should not have exercised its authority in this case, cf. n. 3, <i>infra,</i> surely do not justify the Court's broad rule that <i>sua sponte</i> error correction on behalf of the Government is inappropriate in all cases.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court finds it \"hard to imagine a case in which a district court, after a court of appeals vacated a criminal sentence, could properly increase the sentence based on an error the appeals court left uncorrected because of the cross-appeal rule.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2570, n. 8. Happily, we need not imagine such cases, since they come before our courts every day.\n</p>\n<p>For examples, we have no further to look than the sentencing cases remanded en masse following our recent decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <i>Booker</i>'s wake, it was common for newly convicted defendants to appeal their sentences, claiming that they received enhancements that they would not have received under the advisory guidelines. Many of those cases were remanded for resentencing, and some defendants wound up with even longer sentences on remand. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Singletary,</i> 458 F.3d 72, 77(CA2) (affirming a sentence lengthened by 12 months following a <i>Booker</i> remand), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1047, 127 S.Ct. 616, 166 L.Ed.2d 457 (2006); <i>United States v. Reinhart,</i> 442 F.3d 857, 860-861 (C.A.5 2006) (affirming a sentence lengthened from 210 months to 235 months following a <i>Booker</i> remand).</p>\n<p>These cases represent straightforward applications of the cross-appeal rule: The Government had not cross-appealed the sentence, so the reviewing court did not order the defendant's sentence lengthened. And yet the sentence <i>was</i> ultimately lengthened when the error was corrected on remand. The Court fails to explain the conceptual distinction between those cases and this one. If the Court permits sentencing courts to correct unappealed errors on remand, why does it not permit the courts of appeals to do the same on appeal?</p>\n<p>[3]  Neither the parties nor our <i>amicus</i> have addressed whether, under the assumption that the Court of Appeals enjoys discretion to initiate error correction for the benefit of a nonappealing party, the Eighth Circuit abused that discretion in this case. As framed by petitioner, the question presented asked only whether the cross-appeal requirement is subject to exceptions. Because the parties have not addressed the fact-bound subsidiary question, I would affirm without reaching it. See <i>United States v. International Business Machines Corp.,</i> 517 U.S. 843, 855, n. 3, 116 S.Ct. 1793, 135 L.Ed.2d 124 (1996).</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>128 S.Ct. 2559 (2008)</b></center>\n<center><h1>Michael GREENLAW, aka Mikey, Petitioner,<br>\nv.<br>\nUNITED STATES.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 07-330.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued April 15, 2008.</center>\n<center>Decided June 23, 2008.</center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2561</span> Deanne E.

Fisher, Stanford Law School, Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, Stanford, CA, for petitioner.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case concerns the role of courts in our adversarial system. The specific question presented: May a United States Court of Appeals, acting on its own initiative, order an increase in a defendant's sentence? Petitioner Michael J. Greenlaw was convicted of various offenses relating to drugs and firearms, and was sentenced to imprisonment for 442 months. He appealed urging, <i>inter alia,</i> that his sentence was unreasonably long. After rejecting all of Greenlaw's arguments, the Court of Appeals determined, without Government invitation, that the applicable law plainly required a prison sentence 15 years longer than the term the trial court had imposed. Accordingly, the appeals court instructed the trial court to increase Greenlaw's sentence to 622 months. We hold that, absent a Government appeal or cross-appeal, the sentence Greenlaw received should not have been increased. We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Greenlaw was a member of a gang that, for years, controlled the sale of crack cocaine in a southside Minneapolis neighborhood. See <i>United States v. Carter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797274\"><a href=\"/opinion/797274/united-states-v-laquan-dwayne-carter-also-known-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 604 (C.A.8 2007) (case below). To protect their drug stash and to prevent rival dealers from moving into their territory, gang members carried and concealed numerous weapons. See <i>id.,</i> at 605. For his part in the operation, Greenlaw was charged, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, with eight offenses; after trial, he was found guilty on seven of the charges. App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a-17a.</p>\n<p>Among Greenlaw's convictions were two for violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), which prohibits carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime: His first § 924(c) conviction was for carrying a firearm in connection with a crime committed in 1998; his second, for both carrying and discharging a firearm in connection with a crime committed in 1999. App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a. A first conviction for violating § 924(c) carries a mandatory minimum term of 5 years, if the firearm is simply carried. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i). If the firearm is also discharged, the mandatory minimum increases to 10 years. § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii). For \"a second or subsequent conviction,\" however, whether the weapon is only carried or discharged as well, the mandatory minimum jumps to 25 years. § 924(c)(1)(C)(i). Any sentence for violating § 924(c), moreover, must run consecutively to \"any other term of imprisonment,\" including any other conviction under § 924(c). § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the District Court made an error. Over the Government's objection, the court held that a § 924(c) conviction does not count as \"second or subsequent\" when it is \"charged in the same <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2563</span> indictment\" as the defendant's first § 924(c) conviction. App. 59, 61-62. The error was plain because this Court had held, in <i>Deal v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112860\"><a href=\"/opinion/112860/deal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), that when a defendant is charged in the same indictment with more than one offense qualifying for punishment under § 924(c), all convictions after the first rank as \"second or subsequent,\" see <i>id.,</i> at 132-137, 113 S.Ct. 1993.</p>\n<p>As determined by the District Court, Greenlaw's sentence included 262 months (without separately counting sentences that ran concurrently) for all his convictions other than the two under § 924(c). For the first § 924(c) offense, the court imposed a 5-year sentence in accord with § 924(c)(1)(A)(i). As to the second § 924(c) conviction, the District Court rejected the Government's request for the 25-year minimum prescribed in § 924(c)(1)(C) for \"second or subsequent\" offenses; instead, it imposed the 10-year term prescribed in § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) for first-time offenses.<sup>[1]</sup> The total sentence thus calculated came to 442 months.</p>\n<p>Greenlaw appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, urging, <i>inter alia,</i> that the appropriate total sentence for all his crimes was 15 years. See 481 F.3d, at 607. The Court of Appeals found no merit in any of Greenlaw's arguments. <i>Id.,</i> at 606-607. Although the Government did not appeal or cross-appeal, <i>id.,</i> at 608, it did note, on brief and at oral argument, the District Court's error: Greenlaw's sentence should have been 15 years longer than the 442 months imposed by the District Court, the Government observed, because his second § 924(c) conviction called for a 25-year (not a 10-year) mandatory minimum consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p>The Government made the observation that the sentence was 15 years too short only to counter Greenlaw's argument that it was unreasonably long. See App. 84-86; Recording of Oral Arg. in <i>United States v. Carter,</i> No. 05-3391, (CA8, Sept. 26, 2006), at 16:53-19:04, available at http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/oralargs/oaFrame.html (as visited June 13, 2008). Having refrained from seeking correction of the District Court's error by pursuing its own appeal, the Government simply urged that Greenlaw's sentence should be affirmed.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Government, while objecting at sentencing to the trial court's erroneous reading of § 924(c)(1)(C), had elected to seek no appellate court alteration of Greenlaw's sentence. 481 F.3d, at 608. Relying on the \"plain-error rule\" stated in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), however, the appeals court held that it had discretion to raise and correct the District Court's error on its own initiative. 481 F.3d, at 608-609. The Court of Appeals therefore vacated the sentence and instructed the District Court \"to impose the [statutorily mandated] consecutive minimum sentence of 25 years.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 611.</p>\n<p>Petitioning for rehearing and rehearing en banc, Greenlaw asked the Eighth Circuit to adopt the position advanced by the Seventh Circuit in <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790634\"><a href=\"/opinion/790634/united-states-v-lissett-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span> (2005). App. 95. \"By deciding not to take a cross-appeal,\" the Seventh Circuit stated, \"the United States has ensured that [the defendant's] sentence cannot be increased.\" 411 F.3d, at 867. The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing without an opinion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. On remand, as instructed by the Court of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2564</span> Appeals, the District Court increased Greenlaw's sentence by 15 years, yielding a total prison term of 622 months. App. 103-104, 109.</p>\n<p>Greenlaw petitioned for certiorari noting a division among the Circuits on this question: When a defendant unsuccessfully challenges his sentence as too high, may a court of appeals, on its own initiative, increase the sentence absent a cross-appeal by the Government? In response, the Government \"agree[d] with [Greenlaw] that the court of appeals erred in <i>sua sponte</i> remanding the case with directions to enhance petitioner's sentence.\" Brief in Opposition 12. We granted review and invited Jay T. Jorgensen to brief and argue this case, as <i>amicus curiae,</i> in support of the Court of Appeals' judgment. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 829, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008). Mr. Jorgensen accepted the appointment and has well fulfilled his assigned responsibility.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In our adversary system, in both civil and criminal cases, in the first instance and on appeal, we follow the principle of party presentation. That is, we rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties present. To the extent courts have approved departures from the party presentation principle in criminal cases, the justification has usually been to protect a <i>pro se</i> litigant's rights. See <i>Castro v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131151\"><a href=\"/opinion/131151/castro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 381-383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).<sup>[2]</sup> But as a general rule, \"[o]ur adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 386, 124 S.Ct. 786 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).<sup>[3]</sup> As cogently explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Courts] do not, or should not, sally forth each day looking for wrongs to right. We wait for cases to come to us, and when they do we normally decide only questions presented by the parties. Counsel almost always know a great deal more about their cases than we do, and this must be particularly true of counsel for the United States, the richest, most powerful, and best represented litigant to appear before us.\" <i>United States v. Samuels,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481384\"><a href=\"/opinion/481384/united-states-v-michael-keith-samuels/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1298</span></a></span>, 1301 (C.A.8 1987) (R. Arnold, J., concurring in denial of reh'g en banc).</blockquote>\n<p>The cross-appeal rule, pivotal in this case, is both informed by, and illustrative of, the party presentation principle. Under that unwritten but longstanding rule, an appellate court may not alter a judgment to benefit a nonappealing party. This Court, from its earliest years, has recognized that it takes a cross-appeal to justify a remedy in favor of an appellee. See <i>McDonough v. Dannery,</i> 3 Dall. 188, 198, 1 L.Ed. 563 (1796). We have called the rule \"inveterate and certain.\" <i>Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102766\"><a href=\"/opinion/102766/morley-co-v-md-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 191, 57 S.Ct. 325, 81 L.Ed. 593 (1937).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2565</span> Courts of Appeals have disagreed, however, on the proper characterization of the cross-appeal rule: Is it \"jurisdictional,\" and therefore exceptionless, or a \"rule of practice,\" and thus potentially subject to judicially created exceptions? Compare, <i>e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Teamsters Local 559,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"730981\"><a href=\"/opinion/730981/patricia-johnson-v-teamsters-local-559-patricia-jo/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 28-29 (C.A.1 1996) (cross-appeal rule \"is mandatory and jurisdictional\"), with, <i>e.g., </i><i>American Roll-On Roll-Off Carrier, LLC v. P &amp; O Ports Baltimore, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797060\"><a href=\"/opinion/797060/american-roll-on-roll-off-carrier-llc-american-aut/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 295-296 (C.A.4 2007) (\"cross-appeal requirement [is] one of practice, [not] a strict jurisdictional requirement\"). Our own opinions contain statements supporting both characterizations. Compare, <i>e.g., </i><i>Morley Constr. Co.,</i> 300 U.S., at 187, 57 S.Ct. 325 (cross-appeal rule defines \"[t]he <i>power</i> of an appellate court to modify a decree\" (emphasis added)), with, <i>e.g., </i><i>Langnes v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101669\"><a href=\"/opinion/101669/langnes-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 538, 51 S.Ct. 243, 75 L.Ed. 520 (1931) (cross-appeal requirement is \"a rule of practice which generally has been followed\").</p>\n<p>In <i>El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087692\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087692/el-paso-natural-gas-co-v-neztsosie/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 480, 119 S.Ct. 1430, 143 L.Ed.2d 635 (1999), we declined to decide \"the theoretical status\" of the cross-appeal rule. It sufficed to point out that the rule was \"firmly entrenched\" and served to advance \"institutional interests in fair notice and repose.\" <i>Ibid.</i> \"Indeed,\" we noted, \"in more than two centuries of repeatedly endorsing the cross-appeal requirement, not a single one of our holdings has ever recognized an exception to the rule.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Following the approach taken in <i>Neztsosie,</i> we again need not type the rule \"jurisdictional\" in order to decide this case.</p>\n<p>Congress has eased our decision by specifying the instances in which the Government may seek appellate review of a sentence, and then adding this clear instruction: Even when a United States Attorney files a notice of appeal with respect to a sentence qualifying for review, \"[t]he Government may not further prosecute [the] appeal without the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3742(b). Congress thus entrusted to named high-ranking officials within the Department of Justice responsibility for determining whether the Government, on behalf of the public, should seek a sentence higher than the one imposed. It would severely undermine Congress' instruction were appellate judges to \"sally forth\" on their own motion, cf. <i>supra,</i> at 2577, to take up errors adverse to the Government when the designated Department of Justice officials have not authorized an appeal from the sentence the trial court imposed.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>This Court has recognized that \"the Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case.\" <i>United States v. Nixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109101\"><a href=\"/opinion/109101/united-states-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span>, 693, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974). We need not decide whether comparable authority and discretion are lodged in the Executive Branch with respect to the pursuit of issues on appeal. We need only recognize that Congress, in § 3742(b), has accorded to the top <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2566</span> representatives of the United States in litigation the prerogative to seek or forgo appellate correction of sentencing errors, however plain they may be. That measure should garner the Judiciary's full respect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In ordering the District Court to add 15 years to Greenlaw's sentence, despite the absence of a cross-appeal by the Government, the Court of Appeals identified Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) as the source of its authority. See 481 F.3d, at 608-609, and n. 5. Rule 52(b) reads: \"A plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court's attention.\" Nothing in the text or history of Rule 52(b) suggests that the rulemakers, in codifying the plain-error doctrine, meant to override the cross-appeal requirement. See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52, 18 U.S.C.App., p. 1664 (describing Rule 52(b) as \"a restatement of existing law\").</p>\n<p>Nor do our opinions support a plain-error exception to the cross-appeal rule. This Court has indeed noticed, and ordered correction of, plain errors not raised by defendants, but we have done so only to benefit a defendant who had himself petitioned the Court for review on other grounds. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Silber v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106455\"><a href=\"/opinion/106455/silber-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 82 S.Ct. 1287, 8 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> In no case have we applied plain-error doctrine to the detriment of a petitioning party. Rather, in every case in which correction of a plain error would result in modification of a judgment to the advantage of a party who did not seek this Court's review, we have invoked the cross-appeal rule to bar the correction.</p>\n<p>In <i>Chittenden v. Brewster,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87639\"><a href=\"/opinion/87639/chittenden-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 17 L.Ed. 839 (1865), for example, the appellants asserted that an award entered in their favor was too small. A prior decision of this Court, however, made it plain that they were entitled to no award at all. See <i>id.,</i> at 195-196 (citing <i>Jones v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87582\"><a href=\"/opinion/87582/jones-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 17 L.Ed. 553 (1864)). But because the appellee had not filed a cross-appeal, the Court left the award undisturbed. See 2 Wall., at 196, 17 L.Ed. 839. <i>Strunk v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108809\"><a href=\"/opinion/108809/strunk-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 2260, 37 L.Ed.2d 56 (1973), decided over a century later, is similarly illustrative. There, the Court of Appeals had determined that the defendant was denied his right to a speedy trial, but held that the proper remedy was reduction of his sentence as compensation for the delay, not dismissal of the charges against him. As petitioner in this Court, the defendant sought review of the remedial order. See <i>id.,</i> at 435, 93 S.Ct. 2260. The Court suggested that there may have been no speedy trial violation, as \"it seem[ed] clear that [the defendant] was responsible for a large part of the ... delay.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 436, 93 S.Ct. 2260. But because the Government had not raised the issue by cross-petition, we considered the case on the premise that the defendant had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right, <i>id.,</i> at 437, 93 S.Ct. 2260, and ruled that dismissal of the indictment was the proper remedy, <i>id.,</i> at 439-440, 93 S.Ct. 2260.</p>\n<p>Even if there might be circumstances in which it would be proper for an appellate court to initiate plain-error review, sentencing errors that the Government refrained from pursuing would not fit the bill. Heightening the generally applicable party presentation principle, Congress has provided a dispositive direction regarding sentencing errors that aggrieve the Government. In § 3742(b), as earlier explained, see <i>supra,</i> at 2576-2577, Congress designated leading Department of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2567</span> Justice officers as the decisionmakers responsible for determining when Government pursuit of a sentencing appeal is in order. Those high officers, Congress recognized, are best equipped to determine where the Government's interest lies. Rule 52(b) does not invite appellate court interference with their assessment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p><i>Amicus</i> supporting the Eighth Circuit's judgment links the argument based on Rule 52(b) to a similar argument based on 28 U.S.C. § 2106. See Brief for <i>Amicus Curiae</i> by Invitation of the Court 40-43 (hereinafter Jorgensen Brief). Section 2106 states that federal appellate courts \"may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment ... lawfully brought before it for review.\" For substantially the same reasons that Rule 52(b) does not override the cross-appeal requirement, § 2106 does not do so either. Section 2106 is not limited to plain errors, much less to sentencing errors in criminal casesit applies to all cases, civil and criminal, and to all errors. Were the construction <i>amicus</i> offers correct, § 2106 would displace the cross-appeal rule cross-the-board. The authority described in § 2106, we have observed, \"must be exercised consistent with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as interpreted by this Court.\" <i>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145687\"><a href=\"/opinion/145687/unitherm-food-systems-inc-v-swift-eckrich-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span>, 402-403, n. 4, 126 S.Ct. 980, 163 L.Ed.2d 974 (2006). No different conclusion is warranted with respect to the \"inveterate and certain\" cross-appeal rule. <i>Morley Constr. Co.,</i> 300 U.S., at 191, 57 S.Ct. 325.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In defending the Court of Appeals judgment, <i>amicus</i> places heavy weight on an argument pinned not to Rule 52(b) or 28 U.S.C. § 2106, but to the text of 18 U.S.C. § 3742, the Criminal Code provision governing appellate review of criminal sentences. As <i>amicus</i> reads § 3742, once either party appeals a sentence, the Court of Appeals must remand \"any illegal sentence regardless of whether the remand hurts or helps the appealing party.\" Jorgensen Brief 9. Congress so directed, <i>amicus</i> argues, by instructing that, upon review of the record, a court of appeals \"<i>shall determine</i> ... whether the sentence was imposed in violation of law,\" § 3742(e) (emphasis added), and \"<i>shall remand</i>\" if it so determines, § 3742(f)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). See Jorgensen Brief 10-11, and n. 3.</p>\n<p><i>Amicus</i> makes a further text-based observation. He notes that § 3742(f)(2)the provision covering sentences \"outside the applicable [G]uideline range\"calls for a remand only where a departure from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines harms the appellant. In contrast, <i>amicus</i> emphasizes, § 3742(f)(1)the provision controlling sentences imposed \"in violation of law\" and Guideline application errorscontains no such appellant-linked limitation. The inference <i>amicus</i> draws from this distinction is that Congress intended to override the cross-appeal rule for sentences controlled by § 3742(f)(1), <i>i.e.,</i> those imposed \"in violation of law\" (or incorrectly applying the Guidelines), but not for Guideline departure errors, the category covered by § 3742(f)(2). See <i>id.,</i> at 14-15.</p>\n<p>This novel construction of § 3742, presented for the first time in the brief <i>amicus</i> filed in this Court,<sup>[5]</sup> is clever and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2568</span> complex, but ultimately unpersuasive. Congress enacted § 3742 in 1984. See Sentencing Reform Act, § 213(a), 98 Stat. 2011. At that time, the cross-appeal requirement was a solidly grounded rule of appellate practice. See <i>supra,</i> at 2573-2574. The inference properly drawn, we think, is that Congress was aware of the cross-appeal rule, and framed § 3742 expecting that the new provision would operate in harmony with the \"inveterate and certain\" bar to enlarging judgments in favor of an appellee who filed no cross-appeal. Cf. <i>Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112618\"><a href=\"/opinion/112618/astoria-fed-sav-loan-assn-v-solimino/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 108, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 115 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991) (\"Congress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles.\").</p>\n<p>Congress indicated awareness of the cross-appeal rule in an earlier measure, the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (OCCA), Pub.L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, which provided for review of sentences of \"dangerous special offenders.\" See § 1001(a), <i>id.,</i> at 948-951. For that Act, Congress crafted an explicit exception to the cross-appeal rule. It ordered that an appeal of a sentence taken by the Government \"shall be deemed the taking of [an appeal] by the defendant.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 950. But the \"deeming\" ran in only one direction: \"[A] sentence may be made more severe\" OCCA provided, \"only on review... taken by the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 950-951.<sup>[6]</sup> When Congress repealed this provision and, in § 3742, broadly provided for appellate review of sentences, it did not similarly express in the new text any exception to the cross-appeal rule. In short, Congress formulated a precise exception to the cross-appeal rule when that was its intention. Notably, the exception Congress legislated did not expose a defendant to a higher sentence in response to his own appeal. Congress spoke plainly in the 1970 legislation, leaving nothing for a court to infer. We therefore see no reason to read the current statute in the inventive manner <i>amicus</i> proposes, inferring so much from so little.</p>\n<p><i>Amicus'</i> reading of § 3742, moreover, would yield some strange results. We note two, in particular. Under his construction, § 3742 would give with one hand what it takes away with the other: § 3742(b) entrusts to certain Government officials the decision whether to appeal an illegally low sentence, see <i>supra,</i> at 2574; but according to <i>amicus,</i> §§ 3742(e) and (f) would instruct appellate courts to correct an error of that order on their own initiative, thereby trumping the officials' decision. We resist attributing to Congress an intention to render a statute so internally inconsistent. Cf. <i>Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Board of Equalization of S. D.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111825\"><a href=\"/opinion/111825/western-air-lines-inc-v-board-of-equalization-of-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 133, 107 S.Ct. 1038, 94 L.Ed.2d 112 (1987) (\"The illogical results of applying [a proffered] interpretation ... argue strongly against the conclusion that Congress intended th[o]se results[.]\"). Further, the construction proposed by <i>amicus</i> would draw a puzzling distinction between incorrect applications of the Sentencing Guidelines, controlled by § 3742(f)(1), and erroneous departures from the Guidelines, covered by § 3742(f)(2). The latter would be subject to the cross-appeal rule, the former would not. We do not see why Congress would want to differentiate Guidelines decisions this way.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2569</span> D</h2>\n<p>In increasing Greenlaw's sentence by 15 years on its own initiative, the Eighth Circuit did not advert to the procedural rules setting deadlines for launching appeals and cross-appeals. Unyielding in character, these rules may be seen as auxiliary to the cross-appeal rule and the party presentation principle served by that rule. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) provides that \"[a]n appeal permitted by law... may be taken <i>only by filing a notice of appeal</i> ... within the [prescribed] time.\" (Emphasis added.) Complementing Rule 3(a)(1), Rule 4(b)(1)(B)(ii) instructs that, when the Government has the right to cross-appeal in a criminal case, its notice \"<i>must be filed</i> ... within 30 days after ... the filing of a notice of appeal by any defendant.\" (Emphasis added.) The filing time for a notice of appeal or cross-appeal, Rule 4(b)(4) states, may be extended \"for a period not to exceed 30 days.\" Rule 26(b) bars any extension beyond that time.</p>\n<p>The firm deadlines set by the Appellate Rules advance the interests of the parties and the legal system in fair notice and finality. Thus a defendant who appeals but faces no cross-appeal can proceed anticipating that the appellate court will not enlarge his sentence. And if the Government files a cross-appeal, the defendant will have fair warning, well in advance of briefing and argument, that pursuit of his appeal exposes him to the risk of a higher sentence. Given early warning, he can tailor his arguments to take account of that risk. Or he can seek the Government's agreement to voluntary dismissal of the competing appeals, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b), before positions become hardened during the hours invested in preparing the case for appellate court consideration.</p>\n<p>The strict time limits on notices of appeal and cross-appeal would be undermined, in both civil and criminal cases, if an appeals court could modify a judgment in favor of a party who filed no notice of appeal. In a criminal prosecution, moreover, the defendant would appeal at his peril, with nothing to alert him that, on his own appeal, his sentence would be increased until the appeals court so decreed. In this very case, Greenlaw might have made different strategic decisions had he known soon after filing his notice of appeal that he risked a 15-year increase in an already lengthy sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>We note that nothing we have said in this opinion requires courts to modify their current practice in so-called \"sentencing package cases.\" Those cases typically involve multicount indictments and a successful attack by a defendant on some but not all of the counts of conviction. The appeals court, in such instances, may vacate the entire sentence on all counts so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan to assure that it remains adequate to satisfy the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). In remanded cases, the Government relates, trial courts have imposed a sentence on the remaining counts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2570</span> longer than the sentence originally imposed on those particular counts, but yielding an aggregate sentence no longer than the aggregate sentence initially imposed. See Brief for United States 23, n. 11 (citing, <i>inter alia, </i><i>United States v. Pimienta-Redondo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522862\"><a href=\"/opinion/522862/united-states-v-juan-pimienta-redondo-united-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span> (C.A.1 1989) (en banc)). Thus the defendant ultimately may gain nothing from his limited success on appeal, but he will also lose nothing, as he will serve no more time than the trial court originally ordered.</p>\n<p>The practice the Government describes is not at odds with the cross-appeal rule, which stops appellate judges from adding years to a defendant's sentence on their own initiative. It simply ensures that the sentence \"`will suit not merely the offense but the individual defendant.'\" <i>Pimienta-Redondo,</i> 874 F.2d, at 14 (quoting <i>Wasman v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111253\"><a href=\"/opinion/111253/wasman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span>, 564, 104 S.Ct. 3217, 82 L.Ed.2d 424 (1984)). And the assessment will be made by the sentencing judge exercising discretion, not by an appellate panel ruling on an issue of law no party tendered to the court.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>This is not a \"sentencing package\" case. Greenlaw was unsuccessful on all his appellate issues. There was no occasion for the Court of Appeals to vacate his sentence and no warrant, in the absence of a cross-appeal, to order the addition of 15 years to his sentence.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with Justice ALITO that the cross-appeal requirement is simply a rule <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2571</span> of practice for appellate courts, rather than a limitation on their power, and I therefore join Parts I-III of his opinion. Moreover, as a general matter, I would leave application of the rule to the courts of appeals, with our power to review their discretion \"seldom to be called into action.\" <i>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104856\"><a href=\"/opinion/104856/universal-camera-corp-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span>, 490, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). But since this case is now before us, I would consider whether the Court of Appeals here acted properly. Primarily for the reasons stated by the majority in footnote 9 of its opinion, I believe that the court abused its discretion in <i>sua sponte</i> increasing petitioner's sentence. Our precedent precludes the creation of an exception to the cross-appeal requirement based solely on the obviousness of the lower court's error. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Chittenden v. Brewster,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87639\"><a href=\"/opinion/87639/chittenden-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 195-196, 17 L.Ed. 839 (1865). And I cannot see how the interests of justice are significantly disserved by permitting petitioner's release from prison at roughly age 62, after almost 37 years behind bars, as opposed to age 77.</p>\n<p>Justice ALITO, with whom Justice STEVENS joins, and with whom Justice BREYER joins as to Parts I, II, and III, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent because I view the cross-appeal requirement as a rule of appellate practice. It is akin to the rule that courts invoke when they decline to consider arguments that the parties have not raised. Both rules rest on premises about the efficient use of judicial resources and the proper role of the tribunal in an adversary system. Both are sound and should generally be followed. But just as the courts have made them, the courts may make exceptions to them, and I do not understand why a reviewing court should enjoy less discretion to correct an error <i>sua sponte</i> than it enjoys to raise and address an argument <i>sua sponte.</i> Absent congressional direction to the contrary, and subject to our limited oversight as a supervisory court, we should entrust the decision to initiate error correction to the sound discretion of the courts of appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Before laying out my view in more detail, I must first address the question whether federal courts have subject-matter jurisdiction to enlarge an appellee's judgment in the absence of a cross-appeal. Because the Court would not recognize any exceptions to the cross-appeal requirement when the defendant appeals his sentence, it does not decide that question. See <i>ante,</i> at 2565. I must confront it, though I do not regard it as a substantial question. The cross-appeal requirement seems to me a prime example of a \"`rule of practice,' subject to exceptions, not an unqualified limit on the power of appellate courts.\" <i>El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087692\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087692/el-paso-natural-gas-co-v-neztsosie/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 480, 119 S.Ct. 1430, 143 L.Ed.2d 635 (1999). While a court should generally enforce the cross-appeal requirement, a departure from it would not divest the court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>This Court has never addressed whether an appellate court's jurisdiction to enlarge a judgment in favor of an appellee is contingent on a duly filed cross-appeal. The majority's contention that \"[o]ur own opinions contain statements supporting\" the \"`jurisdictional'\" characterization of the requirement, <i>ante,</i> at 2564-2565, relies on a misreading of that precedent. The Court may have previously characterized the cross-appeal requirement as limiting \"`[t]he <i>power</i> of an appellate court to modify a decree,'\" <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102766\"><a href=\"/opinion/102766/morley-co-v-md-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 187, 57 S.Ct. 325, 81 L.Ed. 593 (1937)), but it does not follow that jurisdiction is conditioned on a properly filed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2572</span> cross-appeal. A court may lack the power to do something for reasons other than want of jurisdiction, and a rule can be inflexible without being jurisdictional. See <i>Eberhart v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145119\"><a href=\"/opinion/145119/eberhart-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 19, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>The jurisdiction of the courts of appeals is fixed by Congress.

Curtis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86318\"><a href=\"/opinion/86318/cary-v-curtis/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 245, 11 L.Ed. 576 (1845))). If Congress wants to withhold from the courts of appeals the power to decide questions that expand the rights of nonappealing parties, it may do so. See U.S. Const., Art. III, § 1 (authorizing Congress to establish the lower courts and, by corollary, to fix their jurisdiction); <i>Kontrick v. Ryan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131156\"><a href=\"/opinion/131156/kontrick-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 452, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004) (\"Only Congress may determine a lower federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction\"). The jurisdictional question thus reduces to whether Congress intended to make a cross-appeal a condition precedent to the appellate court's jurisdiction to enlarge a judgment in favor of a nonappealing party.</p>\n<p>As always with such questions, the text of the relevant statute provides the best evidence of congressional intent. The relevant statute in this case is 18 U.S.C. § 3742 (2000 ed. and Supp. V). Section 3742(a) authorizes a criminal defendant to \"file a notice of appeal\" to review a sentence that was, among other possibilities, \"imposed in violation of law.\" <i>E.g.,</i> § 3742(a)(1). Section 3742(b) provides parallel authority for the Government to \"file a notice of appeal\" to review unlawful sentences. <i>E.g.,</i> § 3742(b)(1). The statute conditions the Government's authority to further prosecute its appeal on \"the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.\" § 3742(b).</p>\n<p>Nothing in this language remotely suggests that a court of appeals lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to increase a defendant's sentence in the absence of a cross-appeal by the Government. In fact, the statute does not even mention cross-appeals. It separately authorizes either party to \"file a notice of appeal,\" but it never suggests that the reviewing court's power is limited to correcting errors for the benefit of the appealing party. If anything, it suggests the opposite. Without qualifying the appellate court's power in any way, § 3742(e) instructs the court to determine, among other things, whether the sentence was \"imposed in violation of law.\" § 3742(e)(1). And while § 3742(f)(2) limits the action that a court of appeals can take depending on which party filed the appeal, compare § 3742(f)(2)(A) (sentences set aside as \"too high\" if defendant filed) with § 3742(f)(2)(B) (sentences set aside as \"too low\" if Government filed), no such limitation appears in § 3742(f)(1). That paragraph requires a court of appeals simply to set aside any sentence \"imposed in violation of law or imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Since a cross-appeal has no effect on the appellate court's subject-matter jurisdiction, the cross-appeal requirement is best characterized as a rule of practice. It is a rule created by the courts to serve interests that are important to the Judiciary. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2573</span> The Court identifies two of these interests: notice to litigants and finality. <i>Ante,</i> at 2565-2566; see also <i>Neztsosie, supra,</i> at 480, 119 S.Ct. 1430. One might add that the cross-appeal requirement also serves a third interest: the appellate court's interest in being adequately briefed on the issues that it decides. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 28.1(c) and Advisory Committee's Notes, 28 U.S.C.App., pp. 615-616. Although these are substantial interests in the abstract, I question how well an inflexible cross-appeal requirement serves them.</p>\n<p><i>Notice.</i> With respect to notice, the benefits of an unyielding cross-appeal requirement are insubstantial. When the Government files a notice of cross-appeal, the defendant is alerted to the possibility that his or her sentence may be increased as a result of the appellate decision. But if the cross-appeal rule is, as I would hold, a strong rule of practice that should be followed in all but exceptional instances, the Government's failure to file a notice of cross-appeal would mean in the vast majority of cases that the defendant thereafter ran little risk of an increased sentence. And the rare cases where that possibility arose would generally involve errors so plain that no conceivable response by the defendant could alter the result. It is not unreasonable to consider an appealing party to be on notice as to such serious errors of law in his favor. And while there may be rare cases in which the existence of such a legal error would come as a complete surprise to the defendant or in which argument from the parties would be of assistance to the court, the solution to such a problem is not to eliminate the courts of appeals' authority to correct egregious errors. Rather, the appropriate response is for the court of appeals to request supplemental briefing orif it deems that insufficientsimply to refuse to exercise its authority. Cf. <i>Irizarry v. United States,</i> 553 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2198, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145796\"><a href=\"/opinion/145796/irizarry-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2369164</span></a></span>, *5-6 (2008). In short, the Court's holding does not increase the substance of the notice that a defendant receives; it merely accelerates that notice by at most a few weeks in a very small number of cases.</p>\n<p>The Court contends that \"[g]iven early warning, [the defendant] can tailor his arguments to take account of [the risk of a higher sentence] ... [o]r he can seek the Government's agreement to voluntary dismissal of the competing appeals.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2569 (citing Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b)). But the Court does not explain how a notice of cross-appeal, a boilerplate document, helps the defendant \"tailor his arguments.\" Whether the cross-appeal rule is ironclad, as the Court believes, or simply a strong rule of practice, a defendant who wishes to appeal his or her sentence is always free to seek the Government's commitment not to cross-appeal or to terminate a cross-appeal that the Government has already taken. Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b).</p>\n<p><i>Finality.</i> An inflexible cross-appeal rule also does little to further the interest of the parties and the Judiciary in the finality of decisions. An appellate court's decision to grant a nonappealing party additional relief does not interrupt a long, undisturbed slumber. The error's repose begins no earlier than the deadline for filing a cross-appeal, and it ends as soon as the reviewing court issues its opinionand often much sooner. Here, for example, the slumber was broken when the Government identified the error in its brief as appellee. See Brief for United States 5.</p>\n<p><i>Orderly Briefing.</i> I do not doubt that adversarial briefing improves the quality of appellate decisionmaking, but it hardly follows that appellate courts should be denied the authority to correct errors that seriously prejudice nonappealing parties. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2574</span> Under my interpretation of the cross-appeal rule, a court of appeals would not be obligated to address errors that are prejudicial to a nonappealing party; a court of appeals would merely have the authority to do so in appropriate cases. If a court of appeals noticed such an error and concluded that it was appropriate to address the issue, the court could, if it wished, order additional briefing. If, on the other hand, the court concluded that the issue was not adequately addressed by the briefs filed by the parties in the ordinary course and that additional briefing would interfere with the efficient administration of the court's work, the court would not be required to decide the issue. Therefore, I do not see how the courts of appeals' interest in orderly briefing is furthered by denying those courts the discretionary authority to address important issues that they find it appropriate to decide.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the inflexible cross-appeal rule that the Court adopts may disserve the interest in judicial efficiency in some cases. For example, correcting an error that prejudiced a nonappealing defendant on direct review might obviate the need for a collateral attack. Cf. <i>Granberry v. Greer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111862\"><a href=\"/opinion/111862/granberry-v-greer/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 134, 107 S.Ct. 1671, 95 L.Ed.2d 119 (1987) (allowing the Court of Appeals to address the merits of an unexhausted habeas corpus petition if \"the interests of comity and federalism will be better served by addressing the merits forthwith [than] by requiring a series of additional state and district court proceedings before reviewing the merits of the petitioner's claim\"); <i>Munaf v. Geren,</i> 553 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2207, ___, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145797\"><a href=\"/opinion/145797/munaf-v-geren/\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2369260</span></a></span>, *12 (2008) (recognizing \"occasions ... when it is appropriate to proceed further and address the merits\" of a habeas corpus petition rather than reverse and remand on threshold matters). Because the reviewing court is in the best position to decide whether a departure from the cross-appeal rule would be efficient, rigid enforcement of that rule is more likely to waste judicial resources than to conserve them.</p>\n<p>In sum, the Court exaggerates the interests served by the cross-appeal requirement. At the same time, it overlooks an important interest that the rule disserves: the interest of the Judiciary and the public in correcting grossly prejudicial errors of law that undermine confidence in our legal system. We have repeatedly stressed the importance of that interest, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 736-737, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>Press-Enterprise Co. v.

The Court mentions one of those contexts, see <i>ante,</i> at 2564 (<i>pro se</i> litigation), but there are others that deserve mention.</p>\n<p>The most well-known is plain-error review. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) authorizes reviewing courts to correct \"[a] plain error that affects substantial rights ... even though it was not brought to the court's attention.\" Although I agree with the Court that this Rule does not independently justify the Eighth Circuit's decision, see <i>ante,</i> at 2565-2566, I believe that the Rule's underlying policy sheds some light on the issue before us. We have explained that courts may rely on Rule 52(b) to correct only those plain errors that \"`seriously affec[t] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" <i>Olano, supra,</i> at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quoting <i>United States v. Atkinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102591\"><a href=\"/opinion/102591/united-states-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)). We have thus recognized that preservation of the \"fairness, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2575</span> integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\" may sometimes justify a departure from the traditional adversarial framework of issue presentation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the closest analogue to the cross-appeal requirement is the rule of appellate practice that restrains reviewing courts from addressing arguments that the parties have not made. Courts typically invoke this rule to avoid resolving a case based on an unaired argument, even if the argument could change the outcome. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Santiago v. Rumsfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792124\"><a href=\"/opinion/792124/emiliano-santiago-v-donald-h-rumsfeld-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 552, n. 1 (C.A.9 2005); <i>United States v.

But courts also recognize that the rule is not inflexible, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Santiago, supra,</i> at 552, n. 1, and sometimes they depart from it, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins.

See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 426 (concluding that the error, if overlooked, would result in \"a miscarriage of justice\"); <i>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. v. Federal Power Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></span>, 662 (C.A.D.C.1974) (balancing \"considerations of judicial orderliness and efficiency against the need for the greatest possible accuracy in judicial decisionmaking\"). Because the prejudicial effect of the error and the impact of error correction on judicial resources are matters best determined by the reviewing court, the court's decision to go beyond the arguments made by the parties is committed to its sound discretion. See <i>United States Nat. Bank of Ore., supra,</i> at 448, 113 S.Ct. 2173 (reviewing an appellate court's decision to address an argument <i>sua sponte</i> for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p>This authority provides a good model for our decision in this case. The Court has not persuaded me that the interests at stake when a reviewing court awards a nonappealing party additional relief are qualitatively different from the interests at stake when a reviewing court raises an issue <i>sua sponte.</i> Authority on the latter point recognizes that the interest of the public and the Judiciary in correcting grossly prejudicial errors of law may sometimes outweigh other interests normally furthered by fidelity to our adversarial tradition. I would recognize the same possibility here. And just as reviewing courts enjoy discretion to decide for themselves when to raise and decide arguments <i>sua sponte,</i> I would grant them substantial latitude to decide when to enlarge an appellee's judgment in the absence of a cross-appeal.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The approach I advocate is not out of step with our precedent. The Court has never decided whether the cross-appeal requirement is \"subject to exceptions [or] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2576</span> an unqualified limit on the power of appellate courts.\" <i>Neztsosie,</i> 526 U.S., at 480, 119 S.Ct. 1430. That question was reserved in <i>Neztsosie, ibid.,</i> even as the Court recognized that lower courts had reached different conclusions, see <i>id.,</i> at 480, n. 2, 119 S.Ct. 1430. I would simply confirm what our precedent had assumed: that there are exceptional circumstances when it is appropriate for a reviewing court to correct an error for the benefit of a party that has not cross-appealed the decision below.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Court has already reached the very result that it claims to disavow today. We have long held that a sentencing court confronted with new circumstances may impose a stiffer sentence on remand than the defendant received prior to a successful appeal. See <i>Chaffin v. Stynchcombe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108793\"><a href=\"/opinion/108793/chaffin-v-stynchcombe/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 23, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973); <i>North Carolina v. Pearce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107978\"><a href=\"/opinion/107978/north-carolina-v-pearce/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span>, 719-720, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), overruled on other grounds, <i>Alabama v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112276\"><a href=\"/opinion/112276/alabama-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989). The Court makes no effort to explain the analytical difference between those cases and this one. If a sentencing court may rely on new circumstances to justify a longer sentence on remand, why cannot one of the new circumstances be the court's discovery (by dint of appellate review) that its first sentence was based on an error of law?<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Even today, the Court refuses to decide whether the cross-appeal requirement admits of exceptions in appropriate cases. While calling the rule \"`inveterate and certain,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 2564-2565 (quoting <i>Morley Constr. Co.,</i> 300 U.S., at 191, 57 S.Ct. 325), the Court allows that \"there might be circumstances in which it would be proper for an appellate court to initiate plain-error review,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2566-2567; see also <i>ante,</i> at 2564, n. 2. The Court's mandate is limited to a single class of cases sentencing appeals, and then only when the appeal is brought by the Government.</p>\n<p>The Court justifies the asymmetry in its decision by pointing to 18 U.S.C. § 3742(b), which provides that \"[t]he Government may not further prosecute [the] appeal without the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.\" According to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2577</span> the majority, \"[i]t would severely undermine Congress' instruction were appellate judges to `sally forth' on their own motion to take up errors adverse to the Government when the designated Department of Justice officials have not authorized an appeal from the sentence the trial court imposed.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2565 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The problem with this argument is that § 3742(b) does not apportion authority over sentencing appeals between the Executive and Judicial Branches. By its terms, § 3742(b) simply apportions that authority <i>within</i> an executive department. It provides that the \"[t]he Government\" may not \"prosecute\" the appeal without approval from one of the listed officials. It says nothing about the power of the courts to correct error in the absence of a Government appeal. Had Congress intended to restrict the power of the courts, the statute would not stop \"[t]he Government\" from \"prosecut[ing]\" unauthorized appeals; instead, it would stop \"the Court of Appeals\" from \"deciding\" them.</p>\n<p>The design that the Court imputes to the drafters of § 3742(b) is inconsistent with the text in another important respect. Suppose that the District Court imposes a sentence below the range set forth in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and the Government files an authorized appeal on the ground that the sentence is unreasonable. Suppose further that the reviewing court discovers, to the surprise of both parties, that the District Court made a further error by overlooking a mandatory minimum to which the defendant was subject. The mandatory minimum would raise the defendant's sentence beyond what even the Government had wanted. Under the majority's theory, see <i>ante,</i> at 2565, the reviewing court should not remand for imposition of the mandatory minimum, since the decision to seek the higher sentence belonged to the Government alone. But that conclusion is plainly at odds with the text of the statute, which imposes no limits on sentencing review once the named officials have signed off on the appeal.</p>\n<p>Section 3742(b)'s limited effect on sentencing review implies that the statute was not designed to prevent judicial encroachment on the prerogatives of the Executive. It is more likely that Congress wanted to withhold from the Executive the power to force the courts of appeals to entertain Government appeals that are not regarded as sufficiently important by the leadership of the Department of Justice. Allowing the courts of appeals, in their discretion, to remedy errors not raised in a cross-appeal in no way trenches on the authority of the Executive. Section 3742(b) may have also been designed to serve the Executive's institutional interests. Congress may have wanted to ensure that the Government maintained a consistent legal position across different sentencing appeals. Or perhaps Congress wanted to maximize the impact of the Government's sentencing appeals by giving high-level officials the authority to nix meritless or marginal ones. These institutional interests of the Executive do not undermine the Judiciary's authority to correct unlawful sentences in the absence of a Government appeal, and they do not justify the Court's decision today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>For the reasons given above, I would hold that the courts of appeals enjoy the discretion to correct error <i>sua sponte</i> for the benefit of nonappealing parties. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2578</span> Court errs in vacating the judgment of the Eighth Circuit, and I respectfully dissent.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The court added 10 years rather than 5 based on the jury's finding that the firearm Greenlaw carried in connection with the second § 924(c) offense had been discharged. See App. 44-45, 59-60.</p>\n<p>[2]  Because this case does not present the issue, we take no position on whether correction of an error prejudicial to a nonappealing criminal defendant might be justified as a measure to obviate the need for a collateral attack. See <i>post,</i> at 2573-2574.</p>\n<p>[3]  Cf. Kaplan, Civil ProcedureReflections on the Comparison of Systems, 9 Buffalo L.Rev. 409, 431-432 (1960) (U.S. system \"exploits the free-wheeling energies of counsel and places them in adversary confrontation before a detached judge\"; \"German system puts its trust in a judge of paternalistic bent acting in cooperation with counsel of somewhat muted adversary zeal\").</p>\n<p>[4]  The dissent reads § 3742(b) not as a restraint on <i>sua sponte</i> error correction by appellate courts, but simply as apportioning \"authority <i>within</i> an executive department.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2576-2577; see <i>post,</i> at 2577 (\"[P]erhaps Congress wanted to ... giv[e] high-level officials the authority to nix meritless or marginal [sentencing appeals].\"). A statute is hardly needed to establish the authority of the Attorney General and Solicitor General over local U.S. Attorneys on matters relating to the prosecution of criminal cases, including appeals of sentences. It seems unlikely, moreover, that Congress, having lodged discretion in top-ranking Department of Justice officers, meant that discretion to be shared with more than 200 appellate judges.</p>\n<p>[5]  An appellee or respondent may defend the judgment below on a ground not earlier aired. See <i>United States v. American Railway Express Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100457\"><a href=\"/opinion/100457/united-states-v-american-ry-exp-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span>, 435, 44 S.Ct. 560, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1924) (\"[T]he appellee may, without taking a cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record[.]\").</p>\n<p>[6]  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970, § 409(h), 84 Stat. 1268-1269, contained matching instructions applicable to \"dangerous special drug offender[s].\" The prescriptions in both Acts were replaced by § 3742. See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, §§ 212(2), 213(a), 219, 98 Stat. 1987, 2011, 2027.</p>\n<p>[7]  In rejecting the interpretation of §§ 3742(e) and (f) proffered by <i>amicus,</i> we take no position on the extent to which the remedial opinion in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), excised those provisions. Compare <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2471, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (STEVENS, J., concurring) (<i>Booker</i> excised only the portions of § 3742(e) that required <i>de novo</i> review by courts of appeals), with 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2483 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (<i>Booker</i> excised <i>all</i> of §§ 3742(e) and (f)). See also <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 578, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (the <i>Booker</i> remedial opinion, whatever it held, cannot be followed).</p>\n<p>[8]  The dissent suggests that our reading of the cross-appeal rule is anomalous because it could bar a court of appeals from correcting an error that would increase a defendant's sentence, but after a \"successful\" appeal the district court itself could rely on that same error to increase the sentence. See <i>post,</i> at 2576-2577, and n. 2. The cross-appeal rule, we of course agree, does not confine the trial court. But default and forfeiture doctrines do. It would therefore be hard to imagine a case in which a district court, after a court of appeals vacated a criminal sentence, could properly increase the sentence based on an error the appeals court left uncorrected because of the cross-appeal rule. What of cases remanded post-<i>Booker</i> on defendants' appeals, the dissent asks? <i>Post,</i> at 2576, n. 2. In those cases, defendants invited and received precisely the relief they sought, and the Sixth Amendment required. Neither the cross-appeal rule nor default and forfeiture had any role to play.</p>\n<p>[9]  For all its spirited argument, the dissent recognizes the narrow gap between its core position and the Court's. The cross-appeal rule, rooted in the principle of party presentation, the dissent concedes, should hold sway in the \"vast majority of cases.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2573. Does this case qualify as the \"rare\" exception to the \"strong rule of practice\" the dissent advocates? See <i>ibid.</i> Greenlaw was sentenced to imprisonment for 442 months. The Government might have chosen to insist on 180 months more, but it elected not to do so. Was the error so \"grossly prejudicial,\" <i>post,</i> at 2574, 2575-2576, so harmful to our system of justice, see <i>post,</i> at 2574-2575, as to warrant <i>sua sponte</i> correction? By what standard is the Court of Appeals to make such an assessment? Without venturing to answer these questions, see <i>post,</i> at 2578, n. 3, the dissent would simply \"entrust the decision to initiate error correction to the sound discretion of the courts of appeals,\" <i>post,</i> at 2571. The \"strong rule\" thus may be broken whenever the particular three judges composing the appellate panel see the sentence as a \"wron[g] to right.\" See <i>supra,</i> at 2573 (internal quotation marks omitted). The better answer, consistent with our jurisprudence, as reinforced by Congress, entrusts \"the decision [whether] to initiate error correction\" in this matter to top counsel for the United States. See <i>supra,</i> at 2574.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Court argues that petitioner's original sentence was neither so fundamentally unfair nor so harmful to our system of justice as to warrant <i>sua sponte</i> correction by the Court of Appeals. <i>Ante,</i> at 2570, n. 9. But these considerations, which may well support a conclusion that the Court of Appeals should not have exercised its authority in this case, cf. n. 3, <i>infra,</i> surely do not justify the Court's broad rule that <i>sua sponte</i> error correction on behalf of the Government is inappropriate in all cases.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court finds it \"hard to imagine a case in which a district court, after a court of appeals vacated a criminal sentence, could properly increase the sentence based on an error the appeals court left uncorrected because of the cross-appeal rule.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2570, n. 8. Happily, we need not imagine such cases, since they come before our courts every day.\n</p>\n<p>For examples, we have no further to look than the sentencing cases remanded en masse following our recent decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <i>Booker</i>'s wake, it was common for newly convicted defendants to appeal their sentences, claiming that they received enhancements that they would not have received under the advisory guidelines. Many of those cases were remanded for resentencing, and some defendants wound up with even longer sentences on remand. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Singletary,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795249\"><a href=\"/opinion/795249/united-states-v-quentin-singletary/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 77(CA2) (affirming a sentence lengthened by 12 months following a <i>Booker</i> remand), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1047</span></span>, 127 S.Ct. 616, 166 L.Ed.2d 457 (2006); <i>United States v.

And yet the sentence <i>was</i> ultimately lengthened when the error was corrected on remand. The Court fails to explain the conceptual distinction between those cases and this one. If the Court permits sentencing courts to correct unappealed errors on remand, why does it not permit the courts of appeals to do the same on appeal?</p>\n<p>[3]  Neither the parties nor our <i>amicus</i> have addressed whether, under the assumption that the Court of Appeals enjoys discretion to initiate error correction for the benefit of a nonappealing party, the Eighth Circuit abused that discretion in this case. As framed by petitioner, the question presented asked only whether the cross-appeal requirement is subject to exceptions. Because the parties have not addressed the fact-bound subsidiary question, I would affirm without reaching it. See <i>United States v.

Greenlaw\n  appealed urging, inter alia, that the appropriate sentence for all his\n  convictions was 15 years. The Government neither appealed nor\n  cross-appealed. The Eighth Circuit found no merit in any of\n  Greenlaw’s arguments, but went on to consider whether his sentence\n  was too low. The court acknowledged that the Government, while it\n  had objected to the trial court’s error at sentencing, had elected not to\n  seek alteration of Greenlaw’s sentence on appeal. Nonetheless, rely-\n  ing on the “plain-error rule” stated in Federal Rule of Criminal Pro-\n  cedure 52(b), the Court of Appeals ordered the District Court to\n  enlarge Greenlaw’s sentence by 15 years, yielding a total prison term\n  of 662 months.\nHeld: Absent a Government appeal or cross-appeal, the Eighth Circuit\n could not, on its own initiative, order an increase in Greenlaw’s sen-\n tence. Pp. 5–17.\n    (a) In both civil and criminal cases, in the first instance and on ap-\n peal, courts follow the principle of party presentation, i.e., the parties\n frame the issues for decision and the courts generally serve as neu-\n tral arbiters of matters the parties present. To the extent courts\n have approved departures from the party presentation principle in\n criminal cases, the justification has usually been to protect a pro se\n litigant’s rights. See Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, 381–383.\n2                    GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    The cross-appeal rule, pivotal in this case, is both informed by, and il-\n    lustrative of, the party presentation principle. Under that rule, it\n    takes a cross-appeal to justify a remedy in favor of an appellee. See\n    McDonough v. Dannery, 3 Dall. 188. This Court has called the rule\n    “inveterate and certain,” Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty\n    Co., 300 U. S. 185, 191, and has in no case ordered an exception to it,\n    El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U. S. 473, 480. No excep-\n    tion is warranted here. Congress has specified that when a United\n    States Attorney files a notice of appeal with respect to a criminal sen-\n    tence, “[t]he Government may not further prosecute [the] appeal\n    without the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor\n    General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor\n    General.” 18 U. S. C. §3742(b). This provision gives the top repre-\n    sentatives of the United States in litigation the prerogative to seek or\n    forgo appellate correction of sentencing errors, however plain they\n    may be. Pp. 5–8.\n       (b) The Eighth Circuit held that the plain-error rule, Fed. Rule\n    Crim. Proc. 52(b), authorized it to order the sentence enhancement\n    sua sponte. Nothing in the text or history of Rule 52(b), or in this\n    Court’s decisions, suggests that the plain-error rule was meant to\n    override the cross-appeal requirement. In every case in which correc-\n    tion of a plain error would result in modifying a judgment to the ad-\n    vantage of a party who did not seek this Court’s review, the Court\n    has invoked the cross-appeal rule to bar the correction. See, e.g.,\n    Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 191; Strunk v. United States, 412\n    U. S. 434. Even if it would be proper for an appeals court to initiate\n    plain-error review in some cases, sentencing errors that the Govern-\n    ment has refrained from pursuing would not fit the bill. In §3742(b),\n    Congress assigned to leading Department of Justice officers responsi-\n    bility for determining when Government pursuit of a sentencing ap-\n    peal is in order. Rule 52(b) does not invite appellate court interfer-\n    ence with the assessment of those officers. Pp. 8–10.\n       (c) Amicus curiae, invited by the Court to brief and argue the case\n    in support of the Court of Appeals’ judgment, links argument based\n    on Rule 52(b) to similar argument based on 28 U. S. C. §2106. For\n    substantially the same reasons that Rule 52(b) does not override the\n    cross-appeal rule, §2106 does not do so either. P. 10.\n       (d) Amicus also argues that 18 U. S. C. §3742, which governs appel-\n    late review of criminal sentences, overrides the cross-appeal rule for\n    sentences “imposed in violation of law,” §3742(e). Amicus’ construc-\n    tion of §3742 is novel and complex, but ultimately unpersuasive. At\n    the time §3742 was enacted, the cross-appeal rule was a solidly\n    grounded rule of appellate practice. Congress had crafted explicit ex-\n    ceptions to the cross-appeal rule in earlier statutes governing sen-\n                      Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  tencing appeals, i.e., the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and\n  the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. When Congress repealed\n  those exceptions and enacted §3742, it did not similarly express in\n  the text of §3742 any exception to the cross-appeal rule. This draft-\n  ing history suggests that Congress was aware of the cross-appeal rule\n  and framed §3742 expecting that the new provision would operate in\n  harmony with it. Pp. 10–13.\n    (e) In increasing Greenlaw’s sentence sua sponte, the Eighth Cir-\n  cuit did not advert to the procedural rules setting firm deadlines for\n  launching appeals and cross-appeals. See Fed. Rules App. Proc.\n  3(a)(1), 4(b)(1)(B)(ii), 4(b)(4), 26(b). The strict time limits on notices\n  of appeal and cross-appeal serve, as the cross-appeal rule does, the\n  interests of the parties and the legal system in fair warning and fi-\n  nality. The time limits would be undermined if an appeals court\n  could modify a judgment in favor of a party who filed no notice of ap-\n  peal. In a criminal prosecution, moreover, the defendant would ap-\n  peal at his peril, with nothing to alert him that, on his own appeal,\n  his sentence would be increased until the appeals court so decreed.\n  Pp. 13–15.\n    (f) Nothing in this opinion requires courts to modify their current\n  practice in “sentencing package cases” involving multicount indict-\n  ments and a successful attack on some but not all of the counts of\n  conviction. The appeals court, in such cases, may vacate the entire\n  sentence on all counts so that the trial court can reconfigure the sen-\n  tencing plan. On remand, trial courts have imposed a sentence on\n  the remaining counts longer than the sentence originally imposed on\n  those particular counts, but yielding an aggregate sentence no longer\n  than the aggregate sentence initially imposed. This practice is not at\n  odds with the cross-appeal rule, which stops appellate judges from\n  adding years to a defendant’s sentence on their own initiative. In\n  any event, this is not a “sentencing package” case. Greenlaw was un-\n  successful on all his appellate issues. The Eighth Circuit, therefore,\n  had no occasion to vacate his sentence and no warrant, in the absence\n  of a cross-appeal, to order the addition of 15 years to his sentence.\n  Pp. 15–16.\n481 F. 3d 601, vacated and remanded.\n\n   GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

The specific question presented: May a United\nStates Court of Appeals, acting on its own initiative, order\nan increase in a defendant’s sentence? Petitioner Michael\nJ. Greenlaw was convicted of various offenses relating to\ndrugs and firearms, and was sentenced to imprisonment\nfor 442 months. He appealed urging, inter alia, that his\nsentence was unreasonably long. After rejecting all of\nGreenlaw’s arguments, the Court of Appeals determined,\nwithout Government invitation, that the applicable law\nplainly required a prison sentence 15 years longer than\nthe term the trial court had imposed. Accordingly, the\nappeals court instructed the trial court to increase\nGreenlaw’s sentence to 622 months. We hold that, absent\na Government appeal or cross-appeal, the sentence\nGreenlaw received should not have been increased. We\ntherefore vacate the Court of Appeals’ judgment.\n                               I\n  Greenlaw was a member of a gang that, for years, con-\ntrolled the sale of crack cocaine in a southside Minneapolis\n2              GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nneighborhood. See United States v. Carter, 481 F. 3d 601,\n604 (CA8 2007) (case below). To protect their drug stash\nand to prevent rival dealers from moving into their terri-\ntory, gang members carried and concealed numerous\nweapons. See id., at 605. For his part in the operation,\nGreenlaw was charged, in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Minnesota, with eight offenses; after\ntrial, he was found guilty on seven of the charges. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 16a–17a.\n   Among Greenlaw’s convictions were two for violating 18\nU. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A), which prohibits carrying a firearm\nduring and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug\ntrafficking crime: His first §924(c) conviction was for\ncarrying a firearm in connection with a crime committed\nin 1998; his second, for both carrying and discharging a\nfirearm in connection with a crime committed in 1999.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 17a. A first conviction for violating\n§924(c) carries a mandatory minimum term of 5 years, if\nthe firearm is simply carried. §924(c)(1)(A)(i). If the\nfirearm is also discharged, the mandatory minimum in-\ncreases to 10 years. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii). For “a second or\nsubsequent conviction,” however, whether the weapon is\nonly carried or discharged as well, the mandatory mini-\nmum jumps to 25 years. §924(c)(1)(C)(i). Any sentence for\nviolating §924(c), moreover, must run consecutively to\n“any other term of imprisonment,” including any other\nconviction under §924(c). §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).\n   At sentencing, the District Court made an error. Over\nthe Government’s objection, the court held that a §924(c)\nconviction does not count as “second or subsequent” when\nit is “charged in the same indictment” as the defendant’s\nfirst §924(c) conviction. App. 59, 61–62. The error was\nplain because this Court had held, in Deal v. United\nStates, 508 U. S. 129 (1993), that when a defendant is\ncharged in the same indictment with more than one of-\nfense qualifying for punishment under §924(c), all convic-\n                    Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntions after the first rank as “second or subsequent,” see\nid., at 132–137.\n   As determined by the District Court, Greenlaw’s sen-\ntence included 262 months (without separately counting\nsentences that ran concurrently) for all his convictions\nother than the two under §924(c). For the first §924(c)\noffense, the court imposed a 5-year sentence in accord with\n§924(c)(1)(A)(i). As to the second §924(c) conviction, the\nDistrict Court rejected the Government’s request for the\n25-year minimum prescribed in §924(c)(1)(C) for “second\nor subsequent” offenses; instead, it imposed the 10-year\nterm prescribed in §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) for first-time offenses.1\nThe total sentence thus calculated came to 442 months.\n   Greenlaw appealed to the United States Court of Ap-\npeals for the Eighth Circuit, urging, inter alia, that the\nappropriate total sentence for all his crimes was 15 years.\nSee 481 F. 3d, at 607. The Court of Appeals found no\nmerit in any of Greenlaw’s arguments. Id., at 606–607.\nAlthough the Government did not appeal or cross-appeal,\nid., at 608, it did note, on brief and at oral argument, the\nDistrict Court’s error: Greenlaw’s sentence should have\nbeen 15 years longer than the 442 months imposed by the\nDistrict Court, the Government observed, because his\nsecond §924(c) conviction called for a 25-year (not a 10-\nyear) mandatory minimum consecutive sentence.\n   The Government made the observation that the sen-\ntence was 15 years too short only to counter Greenlaw’s\nargument that it was unreasonably long. See App. 84–86;\nRecording of Oral Arg. in United States v. Carter, No. 05–\n3391, (CA8, Sept. 26, 2006), at 16:53–19:04, available at\nhttp://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/oralargs/oaFrame.html          (as\nvisited June 13, 2008). Having refrained from seeking\n——————\n   1 The court added 10 years rather than 5 based on the jury’s finding\n\nthat the firearm Greenlaw carried in connection with the second §924(c)\noffense had been discharged. See App. 44–45, 59–60.\n4              GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncorrection of the District Court’s error by pursuing its own\nappeal, the Government simply urged that Greenlaw’s\nsentence should be affirmed.\n   The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Govern-\nment, while objecting at sentencing to the trial court’s\nerroneous reading of §924(c)(1)(C), had elected to seek no\nappellate court alteration of Greenlaw’s sentence. 481\nF. 3d, at 608. Relying on the “plain-error rule” stated in\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), however, the\nappeals court held that it had discretion to raise and\ncorrect the District Court’s error on its own initiative. 481\nF. 3d, at 608–609. The Court of Appeals therefore vacated\nthe sentence and instructed the District Court “to impose\nthe [statutorily mandated] consecutive minimum sentence\nof 25 years.” Id., at 611.\n   Petitioning for rehearing and rehearing en banc,\nGreenlaw asked the Eighth Circuit to adopt the position\nadvanced by the Seventh Circuit in United States v.\nRivera, 411 F. 3d 864 (2005). App. 95. “By deciding not to\ntake a cross-appeal,” the Seventh Circuit stated, “the\nUnited States has ensured that [the defendant’s] sentence\ncannot be increased.” 411 F. 3d, at 867. The Eighth Cir-\ncuit denied rehearing without an opinion. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 28a. On remand, as instructed by the Court of Ap-\npeals, the District Court increased Greenlaw’s sentence by\n15 years, yielding a total prison term of 622 months. App.\n103–104, 109.\n   Greenlaw petitioned for certiorari noting a division\namong the Circuits on this question: When a defendant\nunsuccessfully challenges his sentence as too high, may a\ncourt of appeals, on its own initiative, increase the sen-\ntence absent a cross-appeal by the Government? In re-\nsponse, the Government “agree[d] with [Greenlaw] that\nthe court of appeals erred in sua sponte remanding the\ncase with directions to enhance petitioner’s sentence.”\nBrief in Opposition 12.

Mr. Jorgensen accepted the appointment\nand has well fulfilled his assigned responsibility.\n                             II\n  In our adversary system, in both civil and criminal\ncases, in the first instance and on appeal, we follow the\nprinciple of party presentation. That is, we rely on the\nparties to frame the issues for decision and assign to\ncourts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties\npresent. To the extent courts have approved departures\nfrom the party presentation principle in criminal cases,\nthe justification has usually been to protect a pro se liti-\ngant’s rights. See Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375,\n381–383 (2003).2 But as a general rule, “[o]ur adversary\nsystem is designed around the premise that the parties\nknow what is best for them, and are responsible for ad-\nvancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.”\nId., at 386 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment).3 As cogently explained:\n     “[Courts] do not, or should not, sally forth each day\n     looking for wrongs to right. We wait for cases to come\n     to us, and when they do we normally decide only ques-\n     tions presented by the parties. Counsel almost always\n     know a great deal more about their cases than we do,\n     and this must be particularly true of counsel for the\n——————\n  2 Because this case does not present the issue, we take no position on\n\nwhether correction of an error prejudicial to a nonappealing criminal\ndefendant might be justified as a measure to obviate the need for a\ncollateral attack. See post, at 6–7.\n  3 Cf. Kaplan, Civil Procedure—Reflections on the Comparison of Sys-\n\ntems, 9 Buffalo L. Rev. 409, 431–432 (1960) (U. S. system “exploits the\nfree-wheeling energies of counsel and places them in adversary confron-\ntation before a detached judge”; “German system puts its trust in a\njudge of paternalistic bent acting in cooperation with counsel of some-\nwhat muted adversary zeal”).\n6              GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    United States, the richest, most powerful, and best\n    represented litigant to appear before us.” United\n    States v. Samuels, 808 F. 2d 1298, 1301 (CA8 1987)\n    (R. Arnold, J., concurring in denial of reh’g en banc).\n   The cross-appeal rule, pivotal in this case, is both in-\nformed by, and illustrative of, the party presentation\nprinciple. Under that unwritten but longstanding rule, an\nappellate court may not alter a judgment to benefit a\nnonappealing party. This Court, from its earliest years,\nhas recognized that it takes a cross-appeal to justify a\nremedy in favor of an appellee. See McDonough v.\nDannery, 3 Dall. 188, 198 (1796). We have called the rule\n“inveterate and certain.” Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland\nCasualty Co., 300 U. S. 185, 191 (1937).\n   Courts of Appeals have disagreed, however, on the\nproper characterization of the cross-appeal rule: Is it\n“jurisdictional,” and therefore exceptionless, or a “rule of\npractice,” and thus potentially subject to judicially created\nexceptions? Compare, e.g., Johnson v. Teamsters Local\n559, 102 F. 3d 21, 28–29 (CA1 1996) (cross-appeal rule “is\nmandatory and jurisdictional”), with, e.g., American Roll-\nOn Roll-Off Carrier, LLC v. P & O Ports Baltimore, Inc.,\n479 F. 3d 288, 295–296 (CA4 2007) (“cross-appeal re-\nquirement [is] one of practice, [not] a strict jurisdictional\nrequirement”). Our own opinions contain statements\nsupporting both characterizations. Compare, e.g., Morley\nConstr. Co., 300 U. S., at 187 (cross-appeal rule defines\n“[t]he power of an appellate court to modify a decree”\n(emphasis added)), with, e.g., Langnes v. Green, 282 U. S.\n531, 538 (1931) (cross-appeal requirement is “a rule of\npractice which generally has been followed”).\n   In El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U. S. 473,\n480 (1999), we declined to decide “the theoretical status” of\nthe cross-appeal rule. It sufficed to point out that the rule\nwas “firmly entrenched” and served to advance “institu-\n                      Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntional interests in fair notice and repose.” Ibid. “Indeed,”\nwe noted, “in more than two centuries of repeatedly en-\ndorsing the cross-appeal requirement, not a single one of\nour holdings has ever recognized an exception to the rule.”\nIbid. Following the approach taken in Neztsosie, we again\nneed not type the rule “jurisdictional” in order to decide\nthis case.\n   Congress has eased our decision by specifying the in-\nstances in which the Government may seek appellate\nreview of a sentence, and then adding this clear instruc-\ntion: Even when a United States Attorney files a notice of\nappeal with respect to a sentence qualifying for review,\n“[t]he Government may not further prosecute [the] appeal\nwithout the personal approval of the Attorney General,\nthe Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general desig-\nnated by the Solicitor General.” 18 U. S. C. §3742(b).\nCongress thus entrusted to named high-ranking officials\nwithin the Department of Justice responsibility for deter-\nmining whether the Government, on behalf of the public,\nshould seek a sentence higher than the one imposed. It\nwould severely undermine Congress’ instruction were\nappellate judges to “sally forth” on their own motion, cf.\nsupra, at 5, to take up errors adverse to the Government\nwhen the designated Department of Justice officials have\nnot authorized an appeal from the sentence the trial court\nimposed.4\n——————\n  4 The  dissent reads §3742(b) not as a restraint on sua sponte error\ncorrection by appellate courts, but simply as apportioning “authority\nwithin an executive department.”           Post, at 11; see post, at 13\n(“[P]erhaps Congress wanted to . . . giv[e] high-level officials the author-\nity to nix meritless or marginal [sentencing appeals].”). A statute is\nhardly needed to establish the authority of the Attorney General and\nSolicitor General over local U. S. Attorneys on matters relating to the\nprosecution of criminal cases, including appeals of sentences. It seems\nunlikely, moreover, that Congress, having lodged discretion in top-\nranking Department of Justice officers, meant that discretion to be\nshared with more than 200 appellate judges.\n8              GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   This Court has recognized that “the Executive Branch\nhas exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide\nwhether to prosecute a case.” United States v. Nixon, 418\nU. S. 683, 693 (1974). We need not decide whether compa-\nrable authority and discretion are lodged in the Executive\nBranch with respect to the pursuit of issues on appeal.\nWe need only recognize that Congress, in §3742(b), has\naccorded to the top representatives of the United States in\nlitigation the prerogative to seek or forgo appellate correc-\ntion of sentencing errors, however plain they may be.\nThat measure should garner the Judiciary’s full respect.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  In ordering the District Court to add 15 years to\nGreenlaw’s sentence, despite the absence of a cross-appeal\nby the Government, the Court of Appeals identified Fed-\neral Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) as the source of its\nauthority. See 481 F. 3d, at 608–609, and n. 5. Rule 52(b)\nreads: “A plain error that affects substantial rights may be\nconsidered even though it was not brought to the court’s\nattention.” Nothing in the text or history of Rule 52(b)\nsuggests that the rulemakers, in codifying the plain-error\ndoctrine, meant to override the cross-appeal requirement.\nSee Advisory Committee’s Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n52, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 1664 (describing Rule 52(b) as “a\nrestatement of existing law”).\n  Nor do our opinions support a plain-error exception to\nthe cross-appeal rule. This Court has indeed noticed, and\nordered correction of, plain errors not raised by defen-\ndants, but we have done so only to benefit a defendant\nwho had himself petitioned the Court for review on other\ngrounds. See, e.g., Silber v. United States, 370 U. S. 717\n(1962) (per curiam). In no case have we applied plain-\nerror doctrine to the detriment of a petitioning party.\nRather, in every case in which correction of a plain error\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould result in modification of a judgment to the advan-\ntage of a party who did not seek this Court’s review, we\nhave invoked the cross-appeal rule to bar the correction.\n  In Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 191 (1865), for exam-\nple, the appellants asserted that an award entered in their\nfavor was too small. A prior decision of this Court, how-\never, made it plain that they were entitled to no award at\nall. See id., at 195–196 (citing Jones v. Green, 1 Wall. 330\n(1864)). But because the appellee had not filed a cross-\nappeal, the Court left the award undisturbed. See 2 Wall.,\nat 196. Strunk v. United States, 412 U. S. 434 (1973),\ndecided over a century later, is similarly illustrative.\nThere, the Court of Appeals had determined that the\ndefendant was denied his right to a speedy trial, but held\nthat the proper remedy was reduction of his sentence as\ncompensation for the delay, not dismissal of the charges\nagainst him. As petitioner in this Court, the defendant\nsought review of the remedial order. See id., at 435. The\nCourt suggested that there may have been no speedy trial\nviolation, as “it seem[ed] clear that [the defendant] was\nresponsible for a large part of the . . . delay.” Id., at 436.\nBut because the Government had not raised the issue by\ncross-petition, we considered the case on the premise that\nthe defendant had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment\nright, id., at 437, and ruled that dismissal of the indict-\nment was the proper remedy, id., at 439–440.\n  Even if there might be circumstances in which it would\nbe proper for an appellate court to initiate plain-error\nreview, sentencing errors that the Government refrained\nfrom pursuing would not fit the bill. Heightening the\ngenerally applicable party presentation principle, Con-\ngress has provided a dispositive direction regarding sen-\ntencing errors that aggrieve the Government. In §3742(b),\nas earlier explained, see supra, at 7, Congress designated\nleading Department of Justice officers as the decisionmak-\ners responsible for determining when Government pursuit\n10             GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof a sentencing appeal is in order. Those high officers,\nCongress recognized, are best equipped to determine\nwhere the Government’s interest lies. Rule 52(b) does not\ninvite appellate court interference with their assessment.\n                              B\n  Amicus supporting the Eighth Circuit’s judgment links\nthe argument based on Rule 52(b) to a similar argument\nbased on 28 U. S. C. §2106. See Brief for Amicus Curiae\nby Invitation of the Court 40–43 (hereinafter Jorgensen\nBrief). Section 2106 states that federal appellate courts\n“may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any\njudgment . . . lawfully brought before it for review.” For\nsubstantially the same reasons that Rule 52(b) does not\noverride the cross-appeal requirement, §2106 does not do\nso either. Section 2106 is not limited to plain errors, much\nless to sentencing errors in criminal cases—it applies to all\ncases, civil and criminal, and to all errors. Were the con-\nstruction amicus offers correct, §2106 would displace the\ncross-appeal rule cross-the-board. The authority described\nin §2106, we have observed, “must be exercised consistent\nwith the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure as interpreted by this Court.” Unitherm Food Sys-\ntems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U. S. 394, 402–403,\nn. 4 (2006). No different conclusion is warranted with\nrespect to the “inveterate and certain” cross-appeal rule.\nMorley Constr. Co., 300 U. S., at 191.\n                            C\n  In defending the Court of Appeals judgment, amicus\nplaces heavy weight on an argument pinned not to\nRule 52(b) or 28 U. S. C. §2106, but to the text of 18\nU. S. C. §3742, the Criminal Code provision governing\nappellate review of criminal sentences. As amicus reads\n§3742, once either party appeals a sentence, the Court of\nAppeals must remand “any illegal sentence regardless of\n                    Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether the remand hurts or helps the appealing party.”\nJorgensen Brief 9. Congress so directed, amicus argues,\nby instructing that, upon review of the record, a court of\nappeals “shall determine . . . whether the sentence was\nimposed in violation of law,” §3742(e) (emphasis added),\nand “shall remand” if it so determines, §3742(f)(1) (2000\ned., Supp. V) (emphasis added). See Jorgensen Brief 10–\n11, and n. 3.\n   Amicus makes a further text-based observation. He\nnotes that §3742(f)(2)—the provision covering sentences\n“outside the applicable [G]uideline range”—calls for a\nremand only where a departure from the Federal Sentenc-\ning Guidelines harms the appellant. In contrast, amicus\nemphasizes, §3742(f)(1)—the provision controlling sen-\ntences imposed “in violation of law” and Guideline applica-\ntion errors—contains no such appellant-linked limitation.\nThe inference amicus draws from this distinction is that\nCongress intended to override the cross-appeal rule for\nsentences controlled by §3742(f)(1), i.e., those imposed “in\nviolation of law” (or incorrectly applying the Guidelines),\nbut not for Guideline departure errors, the category cov-\nered by §3742(f)(2). See id., at 14–15.\n   This novel construction of §3742, presented for the first\ntime in the brief amicus filed in this Court,5 is clever and\ncomplex, but ultimately unpersuasive. Congress enacted\n§3742 in 1984. See Sentencing Reform Act, §213(a), 98\nStat. 2011. At that time, the cross-appeal requirement\nwas a solidly grounded rule of appellate practice. See\nsupra, at 6. The inference properly drawn, we think, is\nthat Congress was aware of the cross-appeal rule, and\nframed §3742 expecting that the new provision would\n——————\n  5 An appellee or respondent may defend the judgment below on a\n\nground not earlier aired. See United States v. American Railway\nExpress Co., 265 U. S. 425, 435 (1924) (“[T]he appellee may, without\ntaking a cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing\nin the record[.]”).\n12                GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\noperate in harmony with the “inveterate and certain” bar\nto enlarging judgments in favor of an appellee who filed no\ncross-appeal. Cf. Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v.\nSolimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108 (1991) (“Congress is under-\nstood to legislate against a background of common-law\nadjudicatory principles.”).\n   Congress indicated awareness of the cross-appeal rule in\nan earlier measure, the Organized Crime Control Act of\n1970 (OCCA), Pub. L. 91–452, 84 Stat. 922, which pro-\nvided for review of sentences of “dangerous special offend-\ners.” See §1001(a), id., at 948–951. For that Act, Con-\ngress crafted an explicit exception to the cross-appeal rule.\nIt ordered that an appeal of a sentence taken by the Gov-\nernment “shall be deemed the taking of [an appeal] by the\ndefendant.” Id., at 950. But the “deeming” ran in only one\ndirection: “[A] sentence may be made more severe” OCCA\nprovided, “only on review . . . taken by the United States.”\nId., at 950–951.6 When Congress repealed this provision\nand, in §3742, broadly provided for appellate review of\nsentences, it did not similarly express in the new text any\nexception to the cross-appeal rule. In short, Congress\nformulated a precise exception to the cross-appeal rule\nwhen that was its intention. Notably, the exception Con-\ngress legislated did not expose a defendant to a higher\nsentence in response to his own appeal. Congress spoke\nplainly in the 1970 legislation, leaving nothing for a court\nto infer. We therefore see no reason to read the current\nstatute in the inventive manner amicus proposes, infer-\nring so much from so little.\n   Amicus’ reading of §3742, moreover, would yield some\nstrange results. We note two, in particular. Under his\n——————\n   6 The Controlled Substances Act of 1970, §409(h), 84 Stat. 1268–1269,\n\ncontained matching instructions applicable to “dangerous special drug\noffender[s].” The prescriptions in both Acts were replaced by §3742.\nSee Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, §§212(2), 213(a), 219, 98 Stat. 1987,\n2011, 2027.\n                      Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nconstruction, §3742 would give with one hand what it\ntakes away with the other: §3742(b) entrusts to certain\nGovernment officials the decision whether to appeal an\nillegally low sentence, see supra, at 7; but according to\namicus, §§3742(e) and (f) would instruct appellate courts\nto correct an error of that order on their own initiative,\nthereby trumping the officials’ decision. We resist attrib-\nuting to Congress an intention to render a statute so\ninternally inconsistent. Cf. Western Air Lines, Inc. v.\nBoard of Equalization of S. D., 480 U. S. 123, 133 (1987)\n(“The illogical results of applying [a proffered] interpreta-\ntion . . . argue strongly against the conclusion that Con-\ngress intended th[o]se results[.]”). Further, the construc-\ntion proposed by amicus would draw a puzzling distinction\nbetween incorrect applications of the Sentencing Guide-\nlines, controlled by §3742(f)(1), and erroneous departures\nfrom the Guidelines, covered by §3742(f)(2). The latter\nwould be subject to the cross-appeal rule, the former\nwould not. We do not see why Congress would want to\ndifferentiate Guidelines decisions this way.7\n                           D\n  In increasing Greenlaw’s sentence by 15 years on its\nown initiative, the Eighth Circuit did not advert to the\nprocedural rules setting deadlines for launching appeals\nand cross-appeals. Unyielding in character, these rules\n——————\n  7 In rejecting the interpretation of §§3742(e) and (f) proffered by\namicus, we take no position on the extent to which the remedial opinion\nin United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), excised those provi-\nsions. Compare Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op.,\nat 2) (STEVENS, J., concurring) (Booker excised only the portions of\n§3742(e) that required de novo review by courts of appeals), with 551\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concur-\nring in judgment) (Booker excised all of §§3742(e) and (f)). See also\nKimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 3)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (the Booker remedial opinion, whatever it held,\ncannot be followed).\n14              GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmay be seen as auxiliary to the cross-appeal rule and the\nparty presentation principle served by that rule. Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) provides that “[a]n\nappeal permitted by law . . . may be taken only by filing a\nnotice of appeal . . . within the [prescribed] time.” (Em-\nphasis added.)         Complementing Rule 3(a)(1), Rule\n4(b)(1)(B)(ii) instructs that, when the Government has the\nright to cross-appeal in a criminal case, its notice “must be\nfiled . . . within 30 days after . . . the filing of a notice of\nappeal by any defendant.” (Emphasis added.) The filing\ntime for a notice of appeal or cross-appeal, Rule 4(b)(4)\nstates, may be extended “for a period not to exceed 30\ndays.” Rule 26(b) bars any extension beyond that time.\n   The firm deadlines set by the Appellate Rules advance\nthe interests of the parties and the legal system in fair\nnotice and finality. Thus a defendant who appeals but\nfaces no cross-appeal can proceed anticipating that the\nappellate court will not enlarge his sentence. And if the\nGovernment files a cross-appeal, the defendant will have\nfair warning, well in advance of briefing and argument,\nthat pursuit of his appeal exposes him to the risk of a\nhigher sentence. Given early warning, he can tailor his\narguments to take account of that risk. Or he can seek the\nGovernment’s agreement to voluntary dismissal of the\ncompeting appeals, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b), before\npositions become hardened during the hours invested in\npreparing the case for appellate court consideration.\n   The strict time limits on notices of appeal and cross-\nappeal would be undermined, in both civil and criminal\ncases, if an appeals court could modify a judgment in favor\nof a party who filed no notice of appeal. In a criminal\nprosecution, moreover, the defendant would appeal at his\nperil, with nothing to alert him that, on his own appeal,\nhis sentence would be increased until the appeals court so\ndecreed. In this very case, Greenlaw might have made\ndifferent strategic decisions had he known soon after filing\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhis notice of appeal that he risked a 15-year increase in an\nalready lengthy sentence.\n                             E\n   We note that nothing we have said in this opinion re-\nquires courts to modify their current practice in so-called\n“sentencing package cases.” Those cases typically involve\nmulticount indictments and a successful attack by a de-\nfendant on some but not all of the counts of conviction.\nThe appeals court, in such instances, may vacate the\nentire sentence on all counts so that, on remand, the trial\ncourt can reconfigure the sentencing plan to assure that it\nremains adequate to satisfy the sentencing factors in 18\nU. S. C. §3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). In remanded\ncases, the Government relates, trial courts have imposed a\nsentence on the remaining counts longer than the sen-\ntence originally imposed on those particular counts, but\nyielding an aggregate sentence no longer than the aggre-\ngate sentence initially imposed. See Brief for United\nStates 23, n. 11 (citing, inter alia, United States v. Pi-\nmienta-Redondo, 874 F. 2d 9 (CA1 1989) (en banc)). Thus\nthe defendant ultimately may gain nothing from his lim-\nited success on appeal, but he will also lose nothing, as he\nwill serve no more time than the trial court originally\nordered.\n   The practice the Government describes is not at odds\nwith the cross-appeal rule, which stops appellate judges\nfrom adding years to a defendant’s sentence on their own\ninitiative. It simply ensures that the sentence “ ‘will suit\nnot merely the offense but the individual defendant.’ ”\nPimienta-Redondo, 874 F. 2d, at 14 (quoting Wasman v.\nUnited States, 468 U. S. 559, 564 (1984)). And the as-\nsessment will be made by the sentencing judge exercising\n16                 GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscretion, not by an appellate panel ruling on an issue of\nlaw no party tendered to the court.8\n  This is not a “sentencing package” case. Greenlaw was\nunsuccessful on all his appellate issues. There was no\noccasion for the Court of Appeals to vacate his sentence\nand no warrant, in the absence of a cross-appeal, to order\nthe addition of 15 years to his sentence.9\n——————\n  8 The dissent suggests that our reading of the cross-appeal rule is\n\nanomalous because it could bar a court of appeals from correcting an\nerror that would increase a defendant’s sentence, but after a “success-\nful” appeal the district court itself could rely on that same error to\nincrease the sentence. See post, at 10–11, and n. 2. The cross-appeal\nrule, we of course agree, does not confine the trial court. But default\nand forfeiture doctrines do. It would therefore be hard to imagine a\ncase in which a district court, after a court of appeals vacated a crimi-\nnal sentence, could properly increase the sentence based on an error the\nappeals court left uncorrected because of the cross-appeal rule. What of\ncases remanded post-Booker on defendants’ appeals, the dissent asks?\nPost, at 10–11, n. 2. In those cases, defendants invited and received\nprecisely the relief they sought, and the Sixth Amendment required.\nNeither the cross-appeal rule nor default and forfeiture had any role to\nplay.\n  9 For all its spirited argument, the dissent recognizes the narrow gap\n\nbetween its core position and the Court’s. The cross-appeal rule, rooted\nin the principle of party presentation, the dissent concedes, should hold\nsway in the “vast majority of cases.” Post, at 4. Does this case qualify\nas the “rare” exception to the “strong rule of practice” the dissent\nadvocates? See ibid. Greenlaw was sentenced to imprisonment for 442\nmonths. The Government might have chosen to insist on 180 months\nmore, but it elected not to do so. Was the error so “grossly prejudicial,”\npost, at 7, 9, so harmful to our system of justice, see post, at 7–8, as to\nwarrant sua sponte correction? By what standard is the Court of\nAppeals to make such an assessment? Without venturing to answer\nthese questions, see post, at 13, n. 3, the dissent would simply “entrust\nthe decision to initiate error correction to the sound discretion of the\ncourts of appeals,” post, at 1. The “strong rule” thus may be broken\nwhenever the particular three judges composing the appellate panel see\nthe sentence as a “wron[g] to right.” See supra, at 5 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The better answer, consistent with our jurisprudence,\nas reinforced by Congress, entrusts “the decision [whether] to initiate\nerror correction” in this matter to top counsel for the United States.\nSee supra, at 7.\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

Primarily for the reasons\nstated by the majority in footnote 9 of its opinion, I believe\nthat the court abused its discretion in sua sponte increas-\ning petitioner’s sentence. Our precedent precludes the\ncreation of an exception to the cross-appeal requirement\nbased solely on the obviousness of the lower court’s error.\nSee, e.g., Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 191, 195–196\n(1865).

It is akin to\nthe rule that courts invoke when they decline to consider\narguments that the parties have not raised. Both rules\nrest on premises about the efficient use of judicial re-\nsources and the proper role of the tribunal in an adversary\nsystem. Both are sound and should generally be followed.\nBut just as the courts have made them, the courts may\nmake exceptions to them, and I do not understand why a\nreviewing court should enjoy less discretion to correct an\nerror sua sponte than it enjoys to raise and address an\nargument sua sponte. Absent congressional direction to\nthe contrary, and subject to our limited oversight as a\nsupervisory court, we should entrust the decision to initi-\nate error correction to the sound discretion of the courts of\nappeals.\n                            I\n  Before laying out my view in more detail, I must first\naddress the question whether federal courts have subject-\nmatter jurisdiction to enlarge an appellee’s judgment in\nthe absence of a cross-appeal. Because the Court would\n2               GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nnot recognize any exceptions to the cross-appeal require-\nment when the defendant appeals his sentence, it does not\ndecide that question. See ante, at 7. I must confront it,\nthough I do not regard it as a substantial question. The\ncross-appeal requirement seems to me a prime example of\na “ ‘rule of practice,’ subject to exceptions, not an unquali-\nfied limit on the power of appellate courts.” El Paso Natu-\nral Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U. S. 473, 480 (1999). While\na court should generally enforce the cross-appeal require-\nment, a departure from it would not divest the court of\njurisdiction.\n   This Court has never addressed whether an appellate\ncourt’s jurisdiction to enlarge a judgment in favor of an\nappellee is contingent on a duly filed cross-appeal. The\nmajority’s contention that “[o]ur own opinions contain\nstatements supporting” the “ ‘jurisdictional’ ” characteriza-\ntion of the requirement, ante, at 6, relies on a misreading\nof that precedent. The Court may have previously charac-\nterized the cross-appeal requirement as limiting “ ‘[t]he\npower of an appellate court to modify a decree,’ ” ibid.\n(quoting Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 300\nU. S. 185, 187 (1937)), but it does not follow that jurisdic-\ntion is conditioned on a properly filed cross-appeal. A\ncourt may lack the power to do something for reasons\nother than want of jurisdiction, and a rule can be inflexi-\nble without being jurisdictional. See Eberhart v. United\nStates, 546 U. S. 12, 19 (2005) (per curiam).\n   The jurisdiction of the courts of appeals is fixed by\nCongress. See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007)\n(slip op., at 6); Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689,\n698 (1992) (“ ‘[T]he judicial power of the United States . . .\nis (except in enumerated instances, applicable exclusively\nto this Court) dependent for its distribution and organiza-\ntion, and for the modes of its exercise, entirely upon the\naction of Congress’ ” (quoting Cary v.

S. Const., Art. III, §1 (authorizing Congress to establish\nthe lower courts and, by corollary, to fix their jurisdiction);\nKontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 452 (2004) (“Only Con-\ngress may determine a lower federal court’s subject-matter\njurisdiction”). The jurisdictional question thus reduces to\nwhether Congress intended to make a cross-appeal a\ncondition precedent to the appellate court’s jurisdiction to\nenlarge a judgment in favor of a nonappealing party.\n   As always with such questions, the text of the relevant\nstatute provides the best evidence of congressional intent.\nThe relevant statute in this case is 18 U. S. C. §3742 (2000\ned. and Supp. V). Section 3742(a) authorizes a criminal\ndefendant to “file a notice of appeal” to review a sentence\nthat was, among other possibilities, “imposed in violation\nof law.” E.g., §3742(a)(1). Section 3742(b) provides paral-\nlel authority for the Government to “file a notice of appeal”\nto review unlawful sentences. E.g., §3742(b)(1). The\nstatute conditions the Government’s authority to further\nprosecute its appeal on “the personal approval of the\nAttorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solici-\ntor general designated by the Solicitor General.” §3742(b).\n   Nothing in this language remotely suggests that a court\nof appeals lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to increase a\ndefendant’s sentence in the absence of a cross-appeal by\nthe Government. In fact, the statute does not even men-\ntion cross-appeals. It separately authorizes either party to\n“file a notice of appeal,” but it never suggests that the\nreviewing court’s power is limited to correcting errors for\nthe benefit of the appealing party. If anything, it suggests\nthe opposite. Without qualifying the appellate court’s\npower in any way, §3742(e) instructs the court to deter-\nmine, among other things, whether the sentence was\n“imposed in violation of law.” §3742(e)(1). And while\n§3742(f)(2) limits the action that a court of appeals can\n4              GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntake depending on which party filed the appeal, compare\n§3742(f)(2)(A) (sentences set aside as “too high” if defen-\ndant filed) with §3742(f)(2)(B) (sentences set aside as “too\nlow” if Government filed), no such limitation appears in\n§3742(f)(1). That paragraph requires a court of appeals\nsimply to set aside any sentence “imposed in violation of\nlaw or imposed as a result of an incorrect application of\nthe sentencing guidelines.”\n                              II\n  Since a cross-appeal has no effect on the appellate\ncourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction, the cross-appeal re-\nquirement is best characterized as a rule of practice. It is\na rule created by the courts to serve interests that are\nimportant to the Judiciary. The Court identifies two of\nthese interests: notice to litigants and finality. Ante, at\n14; see also Neztsosie, supra, at 480. One might add that\nthe cross-appeal requirement also serves a third interest:\nthe appellate court’s interest in being adequately briefed\non the issues that it decides.        See Fed. Rule App.\nProc. 28.1(c) and Advisory Committee’s Notes, 28 U. S. C.\nApp., pp. 615–616. Although these are substantial inter-\nests in the abstract, I question how well an inflexible\ncross-appeal requirement serves them.\n  Notice. With respect to notice, the benefits of an un-\nyielding cross-appeal requirement are insubstantial.\nWhen the Government files a notice of cross-appeal, the\ndefendant is alerted to the possibility that his or her sen-\ntence may be increased as a result of the appellate deci-\nsion. But if the cross-appeal rule is, as I would hold, a\nstrong rule of practice that should be followed in all but\nexceptional instances, the Government’s failure to file a\nnotice of cross-appeal would mean in the vast majority of\ncases that the defendant thereafter ran little risk of an\nincreased sentence. And the rare cases where that possi-\nbility arose would generally involve errors so plain that no\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nconceivable response by the defendant could alter the\nresult. It is not unreasonable to consider an appealing\nparty to be on notice as to such serious errors of law in his\nfavor. And while there may be rare cases in which the\nexistence of such a legal error would come as a complete\nsurprise to the defendant or in which argument from the\nparties would be of assistance to the court, the solution to\nsuch a problem is not to eliminate the courts of appeals’\nauthority to correct egregious errors. Rather, the appro-\npriate response is for the court of appeals to request sup-\nplemental briefing or—if it deems that insufficient—\nsimply to refuse to exercise its authority. Cf. Irizarry v.\nUnited States, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 9). In\nshort, the Court’s holding does not increase the substance\nof the notice that a defendant receives; it merely acceler-\nates that notice by at most a few weeks in a very small\nnumber of cases.\n   The Court contends that “[g]iven early warning, [the\ndefendant] can tailor his arguments to take account of [the\nrisk of a higher sentence] . . . [o]r he can seek the Govern-\nment’s agreement to voluntary dismissal of the competing\nappeals.” Ante, at 14 (citing Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b)).\nBut the Court does not explain how a notice of cross-\nappeal, a boilerplate document, helps the defendant “tailor\nhis arguments.” Whether the cross-appeal rule is ironclad,\nas the Court believes, or simply a strong rule of practice, a\ndefendant who wishes to appeal his or her sentence is\nalways free to seek the Government’s commitment not to\ncross-appeal or to terminate a cross-appeal that the Gov-\nernment has already taken. Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b).\n   Finality. An inflexible cross-appeal rule also does little\nto further the interest of the parties and the Judiciary in\nthe finality of decisions. An appellate court’s decision to\ngrant a nonappealing party additional relief does not\ninterrupt a long, undisturbed slumber. The error’s repose\nbegins no earlier than the deadline for filing a cross-\n6              GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nappeal, and it ends as soon as the reviewing court issues\nits opinion—and often much sooner. Here, for example,\nthe slumber was broken when the Government identified\nthe error in its brief as appellee. See Brief for United\nStates 5.\n   Orderly Briefing. I do not doubt that adversarial brief-\ning improves the quality of appellate decisionmaking, but\nit hardly follows that appellate courts should be denied the\nauthority to correct errors that seriously prejudice nonap-\npealing parties. Under my interpretation of the cross-\nappeal rule, a court of appeals would not be obligated to\naddress errors that are prejudicial to a nonappealing\nparty; a court of appeals would merely have the authority\nto do so in appropriate cases. If a court of appeals noticed\nsuch an error and concluded that it was appropriate to\naddress the issue, the court could, if it wished, order addi-\ntional briefing. If, on the other hand, the court concluded\nthat the issue was not adequately addressed by the briefs\nfiled by the parties in the ordinary course and that addi-\ntional briefing would interfere with the efficient admini-\nstration of the court’s work, the court would not be re-\nquired to decide the issue. Therefore, I do not see how the\ncourts of appeals’ interest in orderly briefing is furthered\nby denying those courts the discretionary authority to\naddress important issues that they find it appropriate to\ndecide.\n   Indeed, the inflexible cross-appeal rule that the Court\nadopts may disserve the interest in judicial efficiency in\nsome cases. For example, correcting an error that preju-\ndiced a nonappealing defendant on direct review might\nobviate the need for a collateral attack. Cf. Granberry v.\nGreer, 481 U. S. 129, 134 (1987) (allowing the Court of\nAppeals to address the merits of an unexhausted habeas\ncorpus petition if “the interests of comity and federalism\nwill be better served by addressing the merits forthwith\n[than] by requiring a series of additional state and district\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ncourt proceedings before reviewing the merits of the peti-\ntioner’s claim”); Munaf v. Geren, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\n(slip op., at 13) (recognizing “occasions . . . when it is ap-\npropriate to proceed further and address the merits” of a\nhabeas corpus petition rather than reverse and remand on\nthreshold matters). Because the reviewing court is in the\nbest position to decide whether a departure from the cross-\nappeal rule would be efficient, rigid enforcement of that\nrule is more likely to waste judicial resources than to\nconserve them.\n   In sum, the Court exaggerates the interests served by\nthe cross-appeal requirement. At the same time, it over-\nlooks an important interest that the rule disserves: the\ninterest of the Judiciary and the public in correcting\ngrossly prejudicial errors of law that undermine confi-\ndence in our legal system. We have repeatedly stressed\nthe importance of that interest, see, e.g., United States v.\nOlano, 507 U. S. 725, 736–737 (1993); Press-Enterprise Co.\nv. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty., 464 U. S. 501,\n507 (1984); New York Central R. Co. v. Johnson, 279 U. S.\n310, 318 (1929), and it has justified departures from our\ntraditional adversary framework in other contexts. The\nCourt mentions one of those contexts, see ante, at 5 (pro se\nlitigation), but there are others that deserve mention.\n   The most well-known is plain-error review. Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) authorizes reviewing\ncourts to correct “[a] plain error that affects substantial\nrights . . . even though it was not brought to the court’s\nattention.” Although I agree with the Court that this Rule\ndoes not independently justify the Eighth Circuit’s deci-\nsion, see ante, at 8–9, I believe that the Rule’s underlying\npolicy sheds some light on the issue before us. We have\nexplained that courts may rely on Rule 52(b) to correct only\nthose plain errors that “ ‘seriously affec[t] the fairness,\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.’ ”\nOlano, supra, at 736 (quoting United States v. Atkinson,\n8              GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n297 U. S. 157, 160 (1936)). We have thus recognized that\npreservation of the “fairness, integrity or public reputation\nof judicial proceedings” may sometimes justify a departure\nfrom the traditional adversarial framework of issue\npresentation.\n   Perhaps the closest analogue to the cross-appeal re-\nquirement is the rule of appellate practice that restrains\nreviewing courts from addressing arguments that the\nparties have not made. Courts typically invoke this rule to\navoid resolving a case based on an unaired argument, even\nif the argument could change the outcome. See, e.g.,\nSantiago v. Rumsfeld, 425 F. 3d 549, 552, n. 1 (CA9 2005);\nUnited States v. Cervini, 379 F. 3d 987, 994, n. 5 (CA10\n2004). But courts also recognize that the rule is not in-\nflexible, see, e.g., Santiago, supra, at 552, n. 1, and some-\ntimes they depart from it, see, e.g., United States Nat.\nBank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc.,\n508 U. S. 439, 448 (1993) (“After giving the parties ample\nopportunity to address the issue, the Court of Appeals\nacted without any impropriety in refusing to accept what\nin effect was a stipulation on a question of law” (citing\nSwift & Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co., 243 U. S. 281, 289\n(1917))); United States v. Moyer, 282 F. 3d 1311, 1317–\n1318 (CA10 2002); Dorris v. Absher, 179 F. 3d 420, 425–\n426 (CA6 1999).\n   A reviewing court will generally address an argument\nsua sponte only to correct the most patent and serious\nerrors. See, e.g., id., at 426 (concluding that the error, if\noverlooked, would result in “a miscarriage of justice”);\nConsumers Union of U. S., Inc. v. Federal Power Comm’n,\n510 F. 2d 656, 662 (CADC 1974) (balancing “considera-\ntions of judicial orderliness and efficiency against the need\nfor the greatest possible accuracy in judicial decisionmak-\ning”). Because the prejudicial effect of the error and the\nimpact of error correction on judicial resources are matters\nbest determined by the reviewing court, the court’s deci-\n                     Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                    9\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsion to go beyond the arguments made by the parties is\ncommitted to its sound discretion. See United States Nat.\nBank of Ore., supra, at 448 (reviewing an appellate court’s\ndecision to address an argument sua sponte for abuse of\ndiscretion).\n   This authority provides a good model for our decision in\nthis case. The Court has not persuaded me that the inter-\nests at stake when a reviewing court awards a nonappeal-\ning party additional relief are qualitatively different from\nthe interests at stake when a reviewing court raises an\nissue sua sponte. Authority on the latter point recognizes\nthat the interest of the public and the Judiciary in correct-\ning grossly prejudicial errors of law may sometimes out-\nweigh other interests normally furthered by fidelity to our\nadversarial tradition. I would recognize the same possibil-\nity here. And just as reviewing courts enjoy discretion to\ndecide for themselves when to raise and decide arguments\nsua sponte, I would grant them substantial latitude to\ndecide when to enlarge an appellee’s judgment in the\nabsence of a cross-appeal.1\n                              III\n  The approach I advocate is not out of step with our\nprecedent. The Court has never decided whether the\ncross-appeal requirement is “subject to exceptions [or] an\nunqualified limit on the power of appellate courts.”\nNeztsosie, 526 U. S., at 480. That question was reserved\nin Neztsosie, ibid., even as the Court recognized that lower\ncourts had reached different conclusions, see id., at 480,\n——————\n  1 The  Court argues that petitioner’s original sentence was neither so\nfundamentally unfair nor so harmful to our system of justice as to\nwarrant sua sponte correction by the Court of Appeals. Ante, at 16,\nn. 9. But these considerations, which may well support a conclusion\nthat the Court of Appeals should not have exercised its authority in this\ncase, cf. n. 3, infra, surely do not justify the Court’s broad rule that\nsua sponte error correction on behalf of the Government is inappropri-\nate in all cases.\n10                GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nn. 2. I would simply confirm what our precedent had\nassumed: that there are exceptional circumstances when it\nis appropriate for a reviewing court to correct an error for\nthe benefit of a party that has not cross-appealed the\ndecision below.\n   Indeed, the Court has already reached the very result\nthat it claims to disavow today. We have long held that a\nsentencing court confronted with new circumstances may\nimpose a stiffer sentence on remand than the defendant\nreceived prior to a successful appeal. See Chaffin v.\nStynchcombe, 412 U. S. 17, 23 (1973); North Carolina v.\nPearce, 395 U. S. 711, 719–720 (1969), overruled on other\ngrounds, Alabama v. Smith, 490 U. S. 794 (1989). The\nCourt makes no effort to explain the analytical difference\nbetween those cases and this one. If a sentencing court\nmay rely on new circumstances to justify a longer sentence\non remand, why cannot one of the new circumstances be\nthe court’s discovery (by dint of appellate review) that its\nfirst sentence was based on an error of law?2\n——————\n  2 The Court finds it “hard to imagine a case in which a district court,\n\nafter a court of appeals vacated a criminal sentence, could properly\nincrease the sentence based on an error the appeals court left uncor-\nrected because of the cross-appeal rule.” Ante, at 16, n. 8. Happily, we\nneed not imagine such cases, since they come before our courts every\nday.\n  For examples, we have no further to look than the sentencing cases\nremanded en masse following our recent decision in United States v.\nBooker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005). In Booker’s wake, it was common for\nnewly convicted defendants to appeal their sentences, claiming that\nthey received enhancements that they would not have received under\nthe advisory guidelines. Many of those cases were remanded for\nresentencing, and some defendants wound up with even longer sen-\ntences on remand. See, e.g., United States v. Singletary, 458 F. 3d 72,\n77 (CA2) (affirming a sentence lengthened by 12 months following a\nBooker remand), cert. denied, 549 U. S. 1047 (2006); United States v.\nReinhart, 442 F. 3d 857, 860–861 (CA5 2006) (affirming a sentence\nlengthened from 210 months to 235 months following a Booker\nremand).\n                    Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                  11\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  Even today, the Court refuses to decide whether the\ncross-appeal requirement admits of exceptions in appro-\npriate cases. While calling the rule “ ‘inveterate and cer-\ntain,’ ” ante, at 6 (quoting Morley Constr. Co., 300 U. S., at\n191), the Court allows that “there might be circumstances\nin which it would be proper for an appellate court to initi-\nate plain-error review,” ante, at 9; see also ante, at 5, n. 2.\nThe Court’s mandate is limited to a single class of cases—\nsentencing appeals, and then only when the appeal is\nbrought by the Government.\n  The Court justifies the asymmetry in its decision by\npointing to 18 U. S. C. §3742(b), which provides that “[t]he\nGovernment may not further prosecute [the] appeal with-\nout the personal approval of the Attorney General, the\nSolicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated\nby the Solicitor General.” According to the majority, “[i]t\nwould severely undermine Congress’ instruction were\nappellate judges to ‘sally forth’ on their own motion to take\nup errors adverse to the Government when the designated\nDepartment of Justice officials have not authorized an\nappeal from the sentence the trial court imposed.” Ante,\nat 7 (citation omitted).\n  The problem with this argument is that §3742(b) does\nnot apportion authority over sentencing appeals between\nthe Executive and Judicial Branches. By its terms,\n§3742(b) simply apportions that authority within an ex-\necutive department. It provides that the “[t]he Govern-\nment” may not “prosecute” the appeal without approval\n——————\n   These cases represent straightforward applications of the cross-\nappeal rule: The Government had not cross-appealed the sentence, so\nthe reviewing court did not order the defendant’s sentence lengthened.\nAnd yet the sentence was ultimately lengthened when the error was\ncorrected on remand. The Court fails to explain the conceptual distinc-\ntion between those cases and this one. If the Court permits sentencing\ncourts to correct unappealed errors on remand, why does it not permit\nthe courts of appeals to do the same on appeal?\n12             GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfrom one of the listed officials. It says nothing about the\npower of the courts to correct error in the absence of a\nGovernment appeal. Had Congress intended to restrict\nthe power of the courts, the statute would not stop “[t]he\nGovernment” from “prosecut[ing]” unauthorized appeals;\ninstead, it would stop “the Court of Appeals” from “decid-\ning” them.\n   The design that the Court imputes to the drafters of\n§3742(b) is inconsistent with the text in another important\nrespect. Suppose that the District Court imposes a sen-\ntence below the range set forth in the Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines, and the Government files an authorized ap-\npeal on the ground that the sentence is unreasonable.\nSuppose further that the reviewing court discovers, to the\nsurprise of both parties, that the District Court made a\nfurther error by overlooking a mandatory minimum to\nwhich the defendant was subject. The mandatory mini-\nmum would raise the defendant’s sentence beyond what\neven the Government had wanted. Under the majority’s\ntheory, see ante, at 7, the reviewing court should not\nremand for imposition of the mandatory minimum, since\nthe decision to seek the higher sentence belonged to the\nGovernment alone. But that conclusion is plainly at odds\nwith the text of the statute, which imposes no limits on\nsentencing review once the named officials have signed off\non the appeal.\n   Section 3742(b)’s limited effect on sentencing review\nimplies that the statute was not designed to prevent judi-\ncial encroachment on the prerogatives of the Executive. It\nis more likely that Congress wanted to withhold from the\nExecutive the power to force the courts of appeals to enter-\ntain Government appeals that are not regarded as suffi-\nciently important by the leadership of the Department of\nJustice. Allowing the courts of appeals, in their discretion,\nto remedy errors not raised in a cross-appeal in no way\ntrenches on the authority of the Executive.

Congress may have\nwanted to ensure that the Government maintained a\nconsistent legal position across different sentencing ap-\npeals. Or perhaps Congress wanted to maximize the\nimpact of the Government’s sentencing appeals by giving\nhigh-level officials the authority to nix meritless or mar-\nginal ones. These institutional interests of the Executive\ndo not undermine the Judiciary’s authority to correct\nunlawful sentences in the absence of a Government ap-\npeal, and they do not justify the Court’s decision today.\n                             IV\n  For the reasons given above, I would hold that the\ncourts of appeals enjoy the discretion to correct error\nsua sponte for the benefit of nonappealing parties. The\nCourt errs in vacating the judgment of the Eighth Circuit,\nand I respectfully dissent.3\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  3 Neither the parties nor our amicus have addressed whether, under\n\nthe assumption that the Court of Appeals enjoys discretion to initiate\nerror correction for the benefit of a nonappealing party, the Eighth\nCircuit abused that discretion in this case. As framed by petitioner, the\nquestion presented asked only whether the cross-appeal requirement is\nsubject to exceptions. Because the parties have not addressed the fact-\nbound subsidiary question, I would affirm without reaching it. See\nUnited States v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U.
