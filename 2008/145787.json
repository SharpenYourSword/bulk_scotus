Stewart, Assistant to the Solicitor General, Washington, D.C., for Respondents.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth of Kentucky permits policemen, firemen, and other \"hazardous position\" workers to retire and to receive \"normal retirement\" benefits after either (1) working for 20 years; or (2) working for 5 years and attaining the age of 55. See Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. §§ 16.576, 16.577(2) (Lexis 2003), 61.592(4) (Lexis Supp.2003). It permits those who become seriously disabled but have not otherwise become eligible for retirement to retire immediately and receive \"disability retirement\" benefits. See § 16.582(2)(b) (Lexis 2003). And it treats some of those disabled individuals more generously than it treats some of those who became disabled only after becoming eligible for retirement on the basis of age. The question before us is whether Kentucky's system consequently discriminates against the latter workers \"because of . . . age.\" Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA or Act), § 4(a)(1), 81 Stat. 603, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Kentucky has put in place a special retirement plan (Plan) for state and county employees who occupy \"[h]azardous position[s],\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2365</span> <i>e.g.,</i> active duty law enforcement officers, firefighters, paramedics, and workers in correctional systems. See Ky. Rev.Stat. Ann. § 61.592(1)(a) (Lexis Supp. 2003). The Plan sets forth two routes through which such an employee can become eligible for what is called \"normal retirement\" benefits. The first makes an employee eligible for retirement after 20 years of service. The second makes an employee eligible after only 5 years of service provided that the employee has attained the age of 55. See §§ 16.576, 16.577(2), 61.592(4). An employee eligible under either route will receive a pension calculated in the same way: Kentucky multiplies years of service times 2.5% times final preretirement pay. See § 16.576(3).</p>\n<p>Kentucky's Plan has special provisions for hazardous position workers who become disabled but are not yet eligible for normal retirement. Where such an employee has worked for five years or became disabled in the line of duty, the employee can retire at once. See §§ 16.576(1), 16.582(2) (Lexis 2003). In calculating that employee's benefits Kentucky will add a certain number of (\"imputed\") years to the employee's actual years of service. The number of imputed years equals the number of years that the disabled employee would have had to continue working in order to become eligible for normal retirement benefits, <i>i.e.,</i> the years necessary to bring the employee up to 20 years of service or to at least 5 years of service when the employee would turn 55 (whichever number of years is lower). See § 16.582(5)(a) (Lexis 2003). Thus, if an employee with 17 years of service becomes disabled at age 48, the Plan adds 3 years and calculates the benefits as if the employee had completed 20 years of service. If an employee with 17 years of service becomes disabled at age 54, the Plan adds 1 year and calculates the benefits as if the employee had retired at age 55 with 18 years of service.</p>\n<p>The Plan also imposes a ceiling on imputed years equal to the number of years the employee has previously worked (<i>i.e.,</i> an employee who has worked eight years cannot receive more than eight additional imputed years), see § 16.582(5)(a); it provides for a certain minimum payment, see § 16.582(6) (Lexis 2003); and it contains various other details, none of which is challenged here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Charles Lickteig, a hazardous position worker in the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, became eligible for retirement at age 55, continued to work, became disabled, and then retired at age 61. The Plan calculated his annual pension on the basis of his actual years of service (18 years) times 2.5% times his final annual pay. Because Lickteig became disabled after he had already become eligible for normal retirement benefits, the Plan did not impute any additional years for purposes of the calculation.</p>\n<p>Lickteig complained of age discrimination to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC); and the EEOC then brought this age discrimination lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Kentucky's Plan administrator, and other state entities (to whom we shall refer collectively as \"Kentucky\"). The EEOC pointed out that, if Lickteig had become disabled before he reached the age of 55, the Plan, in calculating Lickteig's benefits would have imputed a number of additional years. And the EEOC argued that the Plan failed to impute years solely because Lickteig became disabled after he reached age 55.</p>\n<p>The District Court, making all appropriate evidence-related assumptions in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2366</span> EEOC's favor, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56, held that the EEOC could not establish age discrimination; and it granted summary judgment in the defendants' favor. A panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed that judgment. <i>EEOC v. Jefferson Cty. Sheriff's Dept.,</i> 424 F.3d 467 (2005). The Sixth Circuit then granted rehearing en banc, held that Kentucky's Plan <i>did</i> violate the ADEA, and reversed and remanded for further proceedings. 467 F.3d 571 (2006).</p>\n<p>Kentucky sought certiorari. In light of the potentially serious impact of the Circuit's decision upon pension benefits provided under plans in effect in many States, we granted the writ. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Ind.Code §§ 36-8-8-3.3(b) and (c) (West 2004); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§ 38.23 and 38.556(2)(d) (West 2005); N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. §§ 135-1 and 135-5 (Lexis 2007); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 7, §§ 5102 and 5704 (Purdon Supp.2007), Tenn.Code Ann. § 8-36-501(c)(3) (Supp.2007). See also Reply Brief for Petitioners 20-21 (predicting, <i>inter alia,</i> large increase in pension liabilities, potential reduction in benefits for all disabled persons, or both); Brief for National Association of State Retirement Administrators et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8-14 (same).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The ADEA forbids an employer to \"fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <i>because of such individual's</i> <i>age.</i>\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) (emphasis added). In <i>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,</i> 507 U.S. 604, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993), the Court explained that where, as here, a plaintiff claims age-related \"disparate treatment\" (<i>i.e., intentional</i> discrimination \"because of . . . age\") the plaintiff must prove that age \"<i>actually motivated</i> the employer's decision.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701 (emphasis added); see also <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 141, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). The Court noted that \"[t]he employer may have relied upon a formal, facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment\" because of age, or \"the employer may have been motivated by [age] on an ad hoc, informal basis.\" <i>Hazen Paper,</i> 507 U.S., at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701. But \"[w]hatever the employer's decisionmaking process,\" a plaintiff alleging disparate treatment cannot succeed unless the employee's age <i>\"actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.\" Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Cf. <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S. 228, 239-240, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005) (plurality opinion) (describing \"disparate-impact\" theory, not here at issue, which focuses upon unjustified discriminatory results).</p>\n<p>In <i>Hazen Paper</i> the Court considered a disparate treatment claim that an employer had unlawfully dismissed a 62-year-old employee with over 9½ years of service in order to avoid paying pension benefits that would have vested after 10 years. The Court held that, without more evidence of intent, the ADEA would not forbid dismissal of the claim. A dismissal based on pension status was not a dismissal \"because. . . of age.\" 507 U.S., at 611-612, 113 S.Ct. 1701. Of course, pension status depended upon years of service, and years of service typically go hand in hand with age. <i>Id.,</i> at 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701. But the two concepts were nonetheless \"analytically distinct.\" <i>Ibid.</i> An employer could easily \"take account of one while ignoring the other.\" <i>Ibid.</i> And the dismissal in question, if based purely upon pension status (related to years of service), would not embody the evils that led Congress to enact the ADEA in the first place: The dismissal was not based on a \"prohibited <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2367</span> stereotype\" of older workers, did not produce any \"attendant stigma\" to those workers, and was not \"the result of an inaccurate and denigrating generalization about age.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 612, 113 S.Ct. 1701.</p>\n<p>At the same time, <i>Hazen Paper</i> indicated that discrimination on the basis of pension status could <i>sometimes</i> be unlawful under the ADEA, in particular where pension status served as a \"proxy for age.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701. Suppose, for example, an employer \"target[ed] employees with a particular pension status on the assumption that these employees are likely to be older.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 612-613, 113 S.Ct. 1701. In such a case, <i>Hazen Paper</i> suggested, age, not pension status, would have \"actually motivated\" the employer's decision-making. <i>Hazen Paper</i> also left open \"the special case where an employee is about to vest in pension benefits as a result of his <i>age,</i> rather than years of service.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701. We here consider a variation on this \"special case\" theme.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Kentucky's Plan turns normal pension eligibility <i>either</i> upon the employee's having attained 20 years of service alone <i>or</i> upon the employees having attained 5 years of service and reached the age of 55. The ADEA permits an employer to condition pension eligibility upon age. See 29 U.S.C.A. § 623(<i>l</i>)(1)(A)(i) (Supp.2007). Thus we must decide whether a plan that (1) lawfully makes age in part a condition of pension eligibility, and (2) treats workers differently in light of their pension status, (3) <i>automatically</i> discriminates <i>because of</i> age. The Government argues \"yes.\" But, following <i>Hazen Paper</i>'s approach, we come to a different conclusion. In particular, the following circumstances, taken together, convince us that, in this particular instance, differences in treatment were not \"actually motivated\" by age.</p>\n<p><i>First,</i> as a matter of pure logic, age and pension status remain \"analytically distinct\" concepts. <i>Hazen Paper,</i> 507 U.S., at 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701. That is to say, one can easily conceive of decisions that are actually made \"because of\" pension status and not age, even where pension status is itself based on age. Suppose, for example that an employer pays all retired workers a pension, retirement eligibility turns on age, say 65, and a 70-year-old worker retires. Nothing in language or in logic prevents one from concluding that the employer has begun to pay the worker a pension, not because the worker is over 65, but simply because the worker has retired.</p>\n<p><i>Second,</i> several background circumstances eliminate the possibility that pension status, though analytically distinct from age, nonetheless serves as a \"proxy for age\" in Kentucky's Plan. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701. We consider not an individual employment decision, but a set of complex systemwide rules. These systemic rules involve, not wages, but pensions a benefit that the ADEA treats somewhat more flexibly and leniently in respect to age. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 29 U.S.C.A. § 623(<i>l</i>)(1)(A)(i) (Supp.2007) (explicitly allowing pension eligibility to turn on age); 29 U.S.C. § 623(<i>l</i>)(2)(A) (allowing employer to consider (age-related) pension benefits in determining level of severance pay); § 623(<i>l</i>)(3) (allowing employer to consider (age-related) pension benefits in determining level of long-term disability benefits). And the specific benefit at issue here is offered to all hazardous position workers on the same nondiscriminatory terms <i>ex ante.</i> That is to say, every such employee, when hired, is promised disability retirement benefits should he become disabled <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2368</span> prior to the time that he is eligible for normal retirement benefits.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Congress has otherwise approved of programs that calculate permanent disability benefits using a formula that expressly takes account of age. For example, the Social Security Administration now uses such a formula in calculating Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 42 U.S.C. § 415(b)(2)(B)(iii); 20 CFR § 404.211(e) (2007). And until (and in some cases after) 1984, federal employees received permanent disability benefits based on a formula that, in certain circumstances, did not just consider age, but effectively imputed years of service only to those disabled workers younger than 60. See 5 U.S.C. § 8339(g) (2006 ed.); see also Office of Personnel Management, Disability Retirement Under the Civil Service Retirement System, Retirement Facts 4, p. 3 (rev.Nov.1997), on line at http://www.opm.gov/forms/ pdfimage/RI83-4.pdf (as visited June 16, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\n<p><i>Third,</i> there is a clear non-age-related rationale for the disparity here at issue. The manner in which Kentucky calculates disability retirement benefits is in every important respect but one identical to the manner in which Kentucky calculates normal retirement benefits. The one significant difference consists of the fact that the Plan imputes additional years of service to disabled individuals. But the Plan imputes <i>only</i> those years needed to bring the disabled worker's years of service to 20 or to the number of years that the individual would have worked had he worked to age 55. The disability rules clearly track Kentucky's normal retirement rules.</p>\n<p>It is obvious, then, that the whole purpose of the disability rules is, as Kentucky claims, to treat a disabled worker as though he had become disabled after, rather than before, he had become eligible for normal retirement benefits. Age factors into the disability calculation only because the normal retirement rules themselves permissibly include age as a consideration. No one seeking to help disabled workers in the way that Kentucky's rules seek to help those workers would care whether Kentucky's normal system turned eligibility in part upon age or upon other, different criteria.</p>\n<p>That this is so is suggested by the fact that one can readily construct a plan that produces an identical disparity but is age neutral. Suppose that Kentucky's Plan made eligible for a pension (a) day-shift workers who have 20 years of service, and (b) night-shift workers who have 15 years of service. Suppose further that the Plan calculates the amount of the pension the same way in either case, which method of calculation depends solely upon years of service (say, giving the worker a pension equal to $1,000 for each year of service). If the Plan were then to provide workers who become disabled prior to pension eligibility the same pension the workers would have received had they worked until they became pension eligible, the plan would create a disparity between disabled day-shift and night-shift workers: A day-shift worker who becomes disabled <i>before</i> becoming pension eligible would, in many instances, end up receiving a bigger pension than a night-shift worker who becomes disabled <i>after</i> becoming pension eligible. For example, a day-shift worker who becomes disabled prior to becoming pension-eligible would receive an annual pension of $20,000, while a night-shift worker who becomes disabled after becoming pension-eligible, say, after 16 years of service, would receive an annual pension of $16,000.</p>\n<p>The disparity in this example is not \"actually motivated\" by bias against night-shift workers. Rather, such a disparity, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2369</span> like the disparity in the case before us, is simply an artifact of Plan rules that treat one set of workers more generously in respect to the <i>timing of their eligibility for normal retirement benefits</i> but which do not treat them more generously in respect to the <i>calculation of the amount</i> of their normal retirement benefits. The example helps to show that the Plan at issue in this case simply seeks to treat disabled employees as if they had worked until the point at which they would be eligible for a normal pension. The disparity turns upon pension eligibility and nothing more.</p>\n<p><i>Fourth,</i> although Kentucky's Plan placed an older worker at a disadvantage in this case, in other cases, it can work to the <i>advantage</i> of older workers. Consider, for example, two disabled workers, one of whom is aged 45 with 10 years of service, one of whom is aged 40 with 15 years of service. Under Kentucky's scheme, the older worker would actually get a bigger boost of imputed years than the younger worker (10 years would be imputed to the former, while only 5 years would be imputed to the latter). And that fact helps to confirm that the underlying motive is not an effort to discriminate \"because of . . . age.\"</p>\n<p><i>Fifth,</i> Kentucky's system does not rely on any of the sorts of stereotypical assumptions that the ADEA sought to eradicate. It does not rest on any stereotype about the work capacity of \"older\" workers <i>relative to</i> \"younger\" workers. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,</i> 540 U.S. 581, 590, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004) (noting that except on one point, all the findings and statements of objectives in the ADEA are \"either cast in terms of the effects of age as intensifying over time, or are couched in terms that refer to `older' workers, explicitly or implicitly <i>relative to</i> `younger' ones\" (emphasis added)). The Plan does assume that all disabled workers would have worked to the point at which they would have become eligible for a pension. It also assumes that no disabled worker would have continued working beyond the point at which he was both (1) disabled; and (2) pension eligible. But these \"assumptions\" do not involve age-related stereotypes, and they apply equally to <i>all</i> workers, regardless of age.</p>\n<p><i>Sixth,</i> the nature of the Plan's eligibility requirements means that, unless Kentucky were severely to cut the benefits given to disabled workers who are not yet pension eligible (which Kentucky claims it will do if its present Plan is unlawful), Kentucky would have to increase the benefits available to disabled, pension-eligible workers, while lacking any clear criteria for determining how many extra years to impute for those pension-eligible workers who already are 55 or older. The difficulty of finding a remedy that can both correct the disparity and achieve the Plan's legitimate objectiveproviding each disabled worker with a sufficient retirement benefit, namely, the normal retirement benefit that the worker would receive if he were pension eligible at the time of disabilityfurther suggests that this objective and not age \"actually motivated\" the Plan.</p>\n<p>The above factors all taken together convince us that the Plan does not, on its face, create treatment differences that are \"actually motivated\" by age. And, for present purposes, we accept the District Court's finding that the Government has pointed to no additional evidence that might permit a factfinder to reach a contrary conclusion. See App. 28-30.</p>\n<p>It bears emphasizing that our opinion in no way unsettles the rule that a statute or policy that facially discriminates based on age suffices to show disparate treatment under the ADEA. We are dealing today with the quite special case of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2370</span> differential treatment based on <i>pension status,</i> where pension statuswith the explicit blessing of the ADEAitself turns, in part, on age. Further, the rule we adopt today for dealing with this sort of case is clear: Where an employer adopts a pension plan that includes age as a factor, and that employer then treats employees differently based on pension status, a plaintiff, to state a disparate treatment claim under the ADEA, must adduce sufficient evidence to show that the differential treatment was \"actually motivated\" by <i>age,</i> not pension status. And our discussion of the factors that lead us to conclude that the Government has failed to make the requisite showing in this case provides an indication of what a plaintiff might show in other cases to meet his burden of proving that differential treatment based on pension status is in fact discrimination \"because of\" age.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The Government makes two additional arguments. First, it looks for support to an amendment that Congress made to the ADEA after this Court's decision in <i>Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts,</i> 492 U.S. 158, 109 S.Ct. 2854, 106 L.Ed.2d 134 (1989). In <i>Betts,</i> the employer denied a worker disability benefits on the ground that its bona fide benefit program provided disability benefits only to workers who became disabled prior to age 60, and the worker in that case became disabled at age 61. <i>Id.,</i> at 163, 109 S.Ct. 2854. The ADEA at that time exempted from its prohibitions employment decisions taken pursuant to the terms of \"`any bona fide employee benefit plan . . . which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of' the Act.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 161, 109 S.Ct. 2854 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(2) (1982 ed., Supp. V)). And the Court held that the employer's decision fell within that exception. 492 U.S., at 182, 109 S.Ct. 2854. Subsequently Congress amended the ADEA to make clear that it covered age-based discrimination in respect to all employee benefits. See Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, § 102, 104 Stat. 978, 29 U.S.C. § 630(<i>l</i>) (2000 ed.). Congress replaced the \"not a subterfuge\" exception with a provision stating that age-based disparities in the provision of benefits are lawful only when they are justified in respect to cost savings. <i>Id.,</i> at 978-979; 29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>We agree with the Government that the amendment broadened the field of employer actions subject to antidiscrimination rules and it narrowed the statutorily available justifications for age-related differences. But these facts cannot help the Government here. We do not dispute that ADEA prohibitions apply to the Plan at issue, and our basis for finding the Plan lawful does not rest upon amendment-related justifications. Rather, we find that the discrimination is not \"actually motivated\" by age. Thus <i>Hazen Paper,</i> not <i>Betts,</i> provides relevant precedent. And the amendment cited by the Government is beside the point.</p>\n<p>Second, the Government says that we must defer to a contrary EEOC interpretation contained in an EEOC regulation and compliance manual. The regulation, however, says only that providing \"the same level of benefits to older workers as to younger workers\" does <i>not</i> violate the Act. 29 CFR § 1625.10(a)(2) (2007). The Government's interpretation of this language is not entitled to deference because, on its face, the regulation \"does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.\" <i>Gonzales v. Oregon,</i> 546 U.S. 243, 257, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006) (denying deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulation in light of the \"near equivalence\" of the statute and regulation).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2371</span> The Compliance Manual provides more explicitly that benefits are not \"equal\" insofar as a plan \"reduces or eliminates benefits based on a criterion that is explicitly defined (in whole or in part) by age.\" 2 EEOC Compliance Manual § 3, p. 627:00041 (2001) (bold typeface deleted). And the Compliance Manual further provides that \"[b]asing disability retirement benefits on the number of years a disabled employee <i>would have worked</i> until normal retirement age by definition gives more constructive years of service to younger than to older employees\" and thus violates the Act. See <i>id.,</i> at 627:0010.</p>\n<p>These statements, while important, cannot lead us to a different conclusion. See <i>National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan,</i> 536 U.S. 101, 111, n. 6, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (noting that compliance manuals are \"`\"entitled to respect\" under our decision in <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)'\"); see also <i>Christensen v. Harris County,</i> 529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000). Following <i>Hazen Paper,</i> we interpret the Act as requiring a showing that the discrimination at issue \"actually motivated\" the employer's decision. Given the reasons set forth in Part III, <i>supra,</i> we conclude that evidence of that motivation was lacking here. And the EEOC's statement in the Compliance Manual that it automatically reaches a contrary conclusiona statement that the Manual itself makes little effort to justifylacks the necessary \"power to persuade\" us. <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, with whom Justice SCALIA, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court today ignores established rules for interpreting and enforcing one of the most important statutes Congress has enacted to protect the Nation's work force from age discrimination, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA or Act), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 621 <i>et seq.</i> That Act prohibits employment actions that \"discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age.\" § 623(a)(1). In recent years employers and employees alike have been advised by this Court, by most Courts of Appeals, and by the agency charged with enforcing the Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), that the most straightforward reading of the statute is the correct one: When an employer makes age a factor in an employee benefit plan in a formal, facial, deliberate, and explicit manner, to the detriment of older employees, this is a violation of the Act. Disparate treatment on the basis of age is prohibited unless some exemption or defense provided in the Act applies.</p>\n<p>The Court today undercuts this basic framework. In doing so it puts the Act and its enforcement on a wrong course. The decision of the en banc panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which the Court reverses, brought that Circuit's case law into line with that of its sister Circuits. See <i>EEOC v. Jefferson Cty. Sheriff's Dept.,</i> 467 F.3d 571, 573 (2006) (overturning <i>Lyon v. Ohio Ed. Assn. and Professional Staff Union,</i> 53 F.3d 135 (1995)); see also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Jankovitz v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.,</i> 421 F.3d 649, 653-655 (C.A.8 2005); <i>Abrahamson v. Board of Ed. of Wappingers Falls Central School Dist.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2372</span> 374 F.3d 66, 72-73 (C.A.2 2004); <i>Arnett v. California Public Employees Retirement System,</i> 179 F.3d 690, 695-697 (C.A.9 1999); <i>Auerbach v. Board of Ed. of Harborfields Central School Dist. of Greenlawn,</i> 136 F.3d 104, 109-114 (C.A.2 1998); <i>Huff v. UARCO, Inc.,</i> 122 F.3d 374, 387-388 (C.A.7 1997). By embracing the approach rejected by the en banc panel and all other Courts of Appeals that have addressed this issue, this Court creates unevenness in administration, unpredictability in litigation, and uncertainty as to employee rights once thought well settled. These consequences, and the Court's errors in interpreting the statute and our cases, require this respectful dissent.</p>\n<p>Even were the Court correct that Kentucky's facially discriminatory disability benefits plan can be justified by a proper motive, the employer's own submission to us reveals that the plan's discriminatory classification rests upon a stereotypical assumption that itself violates the Act and the Court's own analytical framework.</p>\n<p>As a threshold matter, all should concede that the paradigm offered to justify the statute is a powerful one: The young police officer or firefighter with a family is disabled in the heroic performance of his or her duty. Disability payments are increased to account for unworked years of service. What the Court overlooks, however, is that a 61-year-old officer or firefighter who is disabled in the same heroic action receives, in many instances, a lower payment and for one reason alone: By explicit command of Kentucky's disability plan age is an express disadvantage in calculating the disability payment.</p>\n<p>This is a straightforward act of discrimination on the basis of age. Though the Commonwealth is entitled by the law, in some instances, to defend an age-based differential as cost justified, 29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(2)(B)(ii), that has yet to be established here. What an employer cannot do, and what the Court ought not to do, is to pretend that this explicit discrimination based on age is somehow consistent with the broad statutory and regulatory prohibition against disparate treatment based on age.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The following appears to be common ground for both sides of the dispute: Kentucky operates dual retirement systems for employees in hazardous occupations. An employee is eligible for normal retirement if he or she has accumulated 20 years of service with the Commonwealth, or is over age 55 and has accumulated at least 5 years of service. If the employee can no longer work as a result of a disability, however, he or she is entitled to receive disability retirement. Employees who are eligible for normal retirement benefits are ineligible for disability retirement. See Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. §§ 16.576, 16.577(2) (Lexis 2003), 61.592(4) (Lexis Cum.Supp. 2003).</p>\n<p>The distinction between normal and disability retirement is not just a difference of nomenclature. Under the normal retirement system benefits are calculated by multiplying a percentage of the employee's pay at retirement by years of service. See § 16.576(3) (Lexis 2003). Under the disability system the years-of-service multiplier includes not only the employee's actual years of service but also the number of years it would have taken the employee to become eligible for normal retirement (subject to a cap equal to the number of actual years served). See § 16.582(5)(a). In other words employees in the normal retirement system are compensated based solely on their actual years of service; but employees in the disability retirement system get a bonus, which accounts for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2373</span> number of years the employee would have worked had he or she remained healthy until becoming eligible to receive normal retirement benefits.</p>\n<p>Whether intended or not, the result of these divergent benefits formulae is a system that, in some cases, compensates otherwise similarly situated individuals differently on the basis of age. Consider two covered workers, one 45 and one 55, both with five years of service with the Commonwealth and an annual salary of $60,000. If we assume both become disabled in the same accident, the 45-year-old will be entitled to receive $1,250 in monthly benefits; the 55-year-old will receive $625, just half as much. The benefit disparity results from the Commonwealth's decision, under the disability retirement formula, to credit the 45-year-old with 5 years of unworked service (thereby increasing the appliable years-service-multipler to 10 years), while the 55-year-old's benefits are based only on actual years of service (5 years). In that instance age is the only factor that accounts for the disparate treatment.</p>\n<p>True, age is not a factor that reduces benefits in every case. If a worker has accumulated 20 years of service with the Commonwealth before he or she becomes disabled, age plays no role in the benefits calculation. But there is no question that, in many cases, a disabled worker over the age of 55 who has accumulated fewer than 20 years of service receives a lower monthly stipend than otherwise similarly situated workers who are under 55. The Court concludes this result is something other than discrimination on the basis of age only by ignoring the statute and our past opinions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>It is difficult to find a clear rule of law in the list of policy arguments the Court makes to justify its holding. The difficulty is compounded by the Court's own analysis. The Court concedes that, in this case, Kentucky's plan \"placed an older worker at a disadvantage,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2369; yet it proceeds to hold that the Commonwealth's disparate treatment of its workers was not \"`actually motivated' by age,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2369. The Court's apparent rationale is that, even when it is evident that a benefits plan discriminates on its face on the basis of age, an ADEA plaintiff still must provide additional evidence that the employer acted with an \"underlying motive,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2368-2369, to treat older workers less favorably than younger workers.</p>\n<p>The Court finds no support in the text of the statute. In the wake of <i>Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts,</i> 492 U.S. 158, 109 S.Ct. 2854, 106 L.Ed.2d 134 (1989), where the Court held that bona fide employee benefit plans were exempt from the coverage of the ADEA, Congress amended the Act to provide that an employee benefit plan that discriminates on the basis of age is unlawful, except when the employer establishes entitlement to one of the affirmative defenses Congress has provided. See Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA), 104 Stat. 978, codified at 29 U.S.C. § 623(f). As a result of the OWBPA, an employer cannot operate an employee benefit plan in a manner that \"discriminate[s] against any individual . . . because of such individual's age,\" § 623(a), except when the plan is a \"voluntary early retirement incentive plan\" or when \"the actual amount of payment made or cost incurred on behalf of an older worker is no less than that made or incurred on behalf of a younger worker,\" §§ 623(f)(2)(B)(i)-(ii); see generally B. Lindemann &amp; D. Kadue, Age Discrimination in Employment Law 175 (2003). Under any common understanding of the statute's terms a disability plan that pays older <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2374</span> workers less than younger workers on the basis of age \"discriminate[s] . . . because of . . . age.\" That is how the agency that administers the statute, the EEOC, understands it. See 2 EEOC Compliance Manual § 3, p. 627:0004 (2001) (\"[B]enefits will not be equal where a plan reduces or eliminates benefits based on a criterion that is explicitly defined (in whole or in part) by age\"). And the employer here has not shown that any of the affirmative defenses or exemptions to the Act applies. That should be the end of the matter; the employer is liable unless it can make such a showing.</p>\n<p>The Court's holding stems, it asserts, from a statement in <i>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,</i> 507 U.S. 604, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993), that an employment practice discriminates only if it is \"`actually motivated'\" by the protected trait. <i>Ante,</i> at 2366 (quoting <i>Hazen Paper,</i> 507 U.S., at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701; emphasis deleted). If this phrase had been used without qualification, the Court's interpretation of it might have been justified. If one reads the relevant passage in full (with particular emphasis on the second sentence), however, <i>Hazen Paper</i> makes quite clear that no additional proof of motive is required in an ADEA case once the employment policy at issue is deemed discriminatory on its face. The Court said this:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In a disparate treatment case, liability depends on whether the protected trait (under the ADEA, age) actually motivated the employer's decision. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,</i> 460 U.S. 711[, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403] (1983); <i>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 252-256[, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207] (1981); <i>Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters,</i> 438 U.S. 567, 576-578[, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 57 L.Ed.2d 957] (1978). The employer may have relied upon a formal, facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of employees with that trait. <i>See, e.g.,</i> [<i>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.</i>] <i>Thurston,</i> [469 U.S. 111, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985)]; <i>Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart,</i> 435 U.S. 702, 704-718[, 98 S.Ct. 1370, 55 L.Ed.2d 657] (1978). Or the employer may have been motivated by the protected trait on an ad hoc, informal basis. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Anderson v. Bessemer City,</i> 470 U.S. 564[, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518] (1985); <i>Teamsters</i> [<i>v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 324, 334-343, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977)]. Whatever the employer's decisionmaking process, a disparate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee's protected trait actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In context the paragraph identifies a decision made in reliance on a \"facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of employees with [a protected] trait\" as a type of employment action that is \"actually motivated\" by that trait. By interpreting <i>Hazen Paper</i> to say that a formal, facial, explicit, mandated, age-based differential does not suffice to establish a disparate-treatment violation (subject to statutory defenses and exemptions), it misconstrues the precedent upon which its entire theory of this case is built. The Court was right in <i>Hazen Paper</i> and is wrong here.</p>\n<p>At a minimum the Court should not cite <i>Hazen Paper</i> to support what it now holds. Its conclusion that no disparate-treatment violation has been established here conflicts with the longstanding rule in ADEA cases. The ruleconfirmed by the quoted text in <i>Hazen Paper</i>is that once the plaintiff establishes that a policy discriminates on its face, no additional proof of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2375</span> less-than-benign motive for the challenged employment action is required. For if the plan discriminates on its face, it is obvious that decisions made pursuant to the plan are \"actually motivated\" by age. The EEOC (or the employee) must prevail unless the employer can justify its action under one of the enumerated statutory defenses or exemptions.</p>\n<p>Two cases cited in <i>Hazen Paper</i> as examples of \"formal, facially discriminatory polic[ies],\" stand for this proposition. See <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,</i> 469 U.S. 111, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985); <i>Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart,</i> 435 U.S. 702, 98 S.Ct. 1370, 55 L.Ed.2d 657 (1978).</p>\n<p>In <i>Thurston,</i> the Court considered whether Trans World Airlines' transfer policy for older pilots violated the ADEA. The policy allowed pilots to continue working for the airline past the mandatory retirement age of 60 if they transferred to the position of flight engineer. 469 U.S., at 115-116, 105 S.Ct. 613. But the 60-year-old pilot had to bid for the position. Under the bid procedures a pilot who became ineligible to remain at the controls on account of a disability (or even outright incompetence) had priority over a pilot forced out due to age. <i>Id.,</i> at 116-117, 105 S.Ct. 613. The Court held the burden-shifting framework of <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), which is used to determine whether there was a discriminatory motive at play, had no application because the policy was \"discriminatory on its face.\" 469 U.S., at 121, 105 S.Ct. 613.</p>\n<p><i>Manhart,</i> a Title VII case, involved a municipal employees' retirement plan that forced female employees to make larger contributions than their male counterparts. The Court noted that even if there were no evidence that the policy had a discriminatory \"effect,\" \"that evidence does not defeat the claim that the practice, on its face, discriminated against every individual woman employed by the Department.\" 435 U.S., at 716, 98 S.Ct. 1370.</p>\n<p>Just as the majority misunderstands <i>Hazen Paper</i>'s reference to employment practices that are \"actually motivated\" by age, so too does it overstate what the <i>Hazen Paper</i> Court meant when it observed that pension status and age are \"analytically distinct.\" 507 U.S., at 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701. The Court now reads this language as creating a virtual safe harbor for policies that discriminate on the basis of pension status, even when pension status is tied directly to age and then linked to another type of benefit program. The <i>Hazen Paper</i> Court did not allow, or support, this result. In <i>Hazen Paper</i> pension status and age were \"analytically distinct\" because the employee's eligibility to receive a pension formally had nothing to do with age; pension status was tied solely to years of service. The Court recognized that age and pension status were correlated (because older workers were more likely to be pension eligible); but the Court found the plan to be facially neutral with regard to age precisely because age and pension status were not expressly linked under the terms of the plan. See <i>id.,</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701 (noting that \"we do not consider the special case where an employee is about to vest in pension benefits as a result of his <i>age,</i> rather than years of service\"). In order to prove disparate-treatment liability the <i>Hazen Paper</i> Court held that the plaintiff needed to provide additional evidence that his termination in fact was motivated by age. <i>Id.,</i> at 613-614, 113 S.Ct. 1701.</p>\n<p>The saving feature that was controlling in <i>Hazen Paper</i> is absent here. This case is the opposite of <i>Hazen Paper.</i> Here the age distinction is active and present, not superseded and absent. Age is a determining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2376</span> factor of pension eligibility for all workers over the age of 55 who have over 5 (but less than 20) years of service; and pension status, in turn, is used to determine eligibility for disability benefits. For these employees, pension status and age are not \"analytically distinct\" in any meaningful sense; they merge into one category. When it treats these employees differently on the basis of pension eligibility, Kentucky facially discriminates on the basis of age. Were this not the case, there would be no facial age discrimination if an employer divided his employees into two teams based upon ageputting all workers over the age of 65 on \"Team A\" and all other workers on \"Team B\"and then paid Team B members twice the salary of their Team A counterparts, not on the basis of age (the employer would declare) but of team designation. Neither <i>Hazen Paper</i> nor the plain text of the ADEA can be read to permit this result.</p>\n<p>The closest the Court comes to reconciling its holding with the actual text of the statute is its citation to the Act's exemption allowing employers to condition pension eligibility on age. <i>Ante,</i> at 2367. Of course, the fact that it invokes an exemption is a concession by the Court that the Act otherwise would condemn the age-based classification Kentucky's disability plan makes. But the exemption provides no support for the Court's holding in any event. Its coverage is limited to \"employee pension benefit plan[s] [that] provid[e] for the attainment of a minimum age as a condition of eligibility for normal or early retirement benefits.\" See 29 U.S.C.A. § 623(<i>l</i>)(1)(A)(i) (Supp.2007). There is no farther reaching exemption for subsequent employment decisions based upon pension eligibility. And to the extent the Court finds such a loophole to be implicit in the text of the statute, a disability benefits program of the sort at issue here is not the only type of employment policy that fits through it. If the ADEA allows an employer to tie disability benefits to an age-based pension status designation, that same designation can be used to determine wages, hours, heath care benefits, reimbursements, job assignments, promotions, office space, transportation vouchers, parking privileges, and any other conceivable benefit or condition of employment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court recognizes some of the difficulties with its position and seeks to limit its holding, yet it does so in ways not permitted by statute or our previous employment discrimination cases.</p>\n<p>The Court notes that age is not the sole determining factor of pension eligibility but is instead just one factor embedded in a set of \"complex system-wide rules.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2367. There is no suggestion in our prior ADEA cases, however, and certainly none in our related Title VII jurisprudence, that discrimination based on a protected trait is permissible if the protected trait is one among many variables.</p>\n<p>This is quite evident when the protected trait is necessarily a controlling, outcome-determinative factor in calculating employee benefits. In <i>Manhart,</i> for instance, sex was not the only factor determining how much an employee was required to contribute to the pension plan on a monthly basis; the employee's salary, age, and length of service were also variables in the equation. 435 U.S., at 705, 98 S.Ct. 1370; Brief for Petitioners in <i>Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart</i><i>,</i> O.T.1977, No. 76-1810, p. 23. And even though the employer's decision to require higher contributions from female employees was based upon an actuarially sound premise that women have longer life expectancies than menthe Court held that the plan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2377</span> discriminated on its face. 435 U.S., at 711, 98 S.Ct. 1370.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we have said that the ADEA's substantive prohibitions, which were \"derived <i>in haec verba</i> from Title VII,\" <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> 434 U.S. 575, 584, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978), require the employer \"to ignore an employee's age (absent a statutory exemption or defense),\" <i>Hazen Paper,</i> 507 U.S., at 612, 113 S.Ct. 1701. This statement perhaps has been qualified by the Court's subsequent holding in <i>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,</i> 540 U.S. 581, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004), that the ADEA does not forbid employers from discriminating in favor of older workers to the detriment of younger workers. Reasonable minds may have disagreed about the merits of <i>Cline</i>'s holding. See <i>id.,</i> at 601, 124 S.Ct. 1236 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); see also <i>id.,</i> at 602, 124 S.Ct. 1236 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). But <i>Cline</i> does not dictate the path the Court chooses here. For it is one thing to interpret a statute designed to combat age discrimination in a way that benefits older workers to the detriment of younger workers; it is quite another to do what the Court does in this case, which is to interpret the ADEA to allow a discriminatory employment practice that disfavors older workers while favoring younger ones. The Court, moreover, achieved the result in <i>Cline</i> by reading the word \"age\" to mean \"old age\" <i>i.e.,</i> by reading \"discriminat[ion] . . . because of [an] individual's age,\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a), to mean discrimination because of an individual's advanced age. See <i>Cline, supra,</i> at 596, 124 S.Ct. 1236. Here the Court seems to adopt a new definition of the term \"discriminate\" by holding that there is no discrimination on the basis of a protected trait if the trait is one among several factors that bear upon how an employee is treated. There is no principled way to draw this distinction, and the Court does not attempt to do so. Cf. <i>Manhart, supra,</i> at 710, 98 S.Ct. 1370 (\"[T]here is no reason to believe that Congress intended a special definition of discrimination in the context of employee group insurance coverage\").</p>\n<p>The Court recites what it sees as \"several background circumstances [that] eliminate the possibility that pension status, though analytically distinct from age, nonetheless serves as a `proxy for age' in Kentucky's Plan.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2367. Among these is a \"clear non-age-related rationale,\" <i>ibid.,</i> \"to treat a disabled worker as though he had become disabled after, rather than before, he had become eligible for normal retirement benefits,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2368. There is a difference, however, between a laudable purpose and a rule of law.</p>\n<p>An otherwise discriminatory employment action cannot be rendered lawful because the employer's motives were benign. In <i>Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.,</i> 499 U.S. 187, 111 S.Ct. 1196, 113 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991), the employer had a policy barring all female employees, except those who were infertile, from performing jobs that exposed them to lead. The employer said its policy was designed not to reinforce negative gender stereotypes but to protect female employees' unborn children against the risk of birth defects. <i>Id.,</i> at 191, 111 S.Ct. 1196. The argument did not prevail. The plan discriminated on its face on the basis of sex, and the employer did not establish a bona fide occupational qualification defense. As a result, the Court held that the restriction violated Title VII. \"[T]he absence of a malevolent motive [did] not convert a facially discriminatory plan into a neutral policy with a discriminatory effect.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 199, 111 S.Ct. 1196.</p>\n<p>Still, even if our cases allowed the motive qualification the Court puts forth to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2378</span> justify a facial and operative distinction based upon age, the plan at issue here does not survive the Court's own test. We need look no further than the Commonwealth's own brief for evidence that its motives are contrary to the ADEA. In its brief the Commonwealth refers to the 61-year-old complainant in this case, Charles Lickteig, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"An employee in Mr. Lickteig's position has had an extra 21 years to devote to making money, providing for himself and his family, saving funds for retirement, and accruing years that will increase his retirement benefits. Thus, the 40-year-old employee is likely to need more of a boost.\" Brief for Petitioners 23.</blockquote>\n<p>The hypothetical younger worker seems entitled to a boost only if one accepts that the younger worker had more productive years of work left in him at the time of his injury than Lickteig did. As an actuarial matter, this assumption may be sound. It is an impermissible basis for differential treatment under the ADEA, however. As we said in <i>Hazen Paper,</i> the idea that \"productivity and competence decline with old age\" is the \"very essence of age discrimination.\" 507 U.S., at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701. By forbidding age discrimination against any \"individual,\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a), the ADEA forbids employers from using the blunt tool of age to assess an employee's future productivity. Cf. <i>Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell,</i> 472 U.S. 400, 409, 105 S.Ct. 2743, 86 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985) (noting the Labor Department's findings that \"the process of psychological and physiological degeneration caused by aging varies with each individual\"). Whether this is good public policy in all instances might be debatable. Until Congress sees fit to change the language of the statute, however, there is no principled basis for upholding Kentucky's disability benefits formula.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>As explained in this dissent, Kentucky's disability retirement plan violates the ADEA, an Act intended to promote the interests of older Americans. Yet it is no small irony that it does so, at least in part, because the Commonwealth's normal retirement plan treats older workers in a particularly generous fashion. Kentucky allows its employees to retire at the age of 55 if they have accumulated only five years of service. But for this provision, which links age and years of service in a way that benefits older workers, pension eligibility would be a function solely of tenure, not age. Accordingly, this case would be more like <i>Hazen Paper,</i> and the EEOC's case would be much weaker. Similarly, as the Court notes, <i>ante,</i> at 2369, Kentucky could avoid any problems by not imputing unworked years of service to any disabled workers, old and young alike. Neither change to the plan would result in more generous treatment for older workers. The only difference would be that, under the first example, older workers would lose the option of early retirement, and, under the second, younger workers would see their benefits cut. These are not the only possible remediesthe Commonwealth could impute unworked years of service to all employees forced into retirement on account of a disability regardless of age.</p>\n<p>The Court's desire to avoid construing the ADEA in a way that encourages the Commonwealth to eliminate its early retirement program or to reduce benefits to the policemen and firefighters who are covered under the disability plan is understandable.

See Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. §§ 16.576, 16.577(2) (Lexis 2003), 61.592(4) (Lexis Supp.2003). It permits those who become seriously disabled but have not otherwise become eligible for retirement to retire immediately and receive \"disability retirement\" benefits. See § 16.582(2)(b) (Lexis 2003). And it treats some of those disabled individuals more generously than it treats some of those who became disabled only after becoming eligible for retirement on the basis of age. The question before us is whether Kentucky's system consequently discriminates against the latter workers \"because of . . . age.\" Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA or Act), § 4(a)(1), 81 Stat. 603, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Kentucky has put in place a special retirement plan (Plan) for state and county employees who occupy \"[h]azardous position[s],\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2365</span> <i>e.g.,</i> active duty law enforcement officers, firefighters, paramedics, and workers in correctional systems. See Ky. Rev.Stat. Ann. § 61.592(1)(a) (Lexis Supp. 2003). The Plan sets forth two routes through which such an employee can become eligible for what is called \"normal retirement\" benefits. The first makes an employee eligible for retirement after 20 years of service. The second makes an employee eligible after only 5 years of service provided that the employee has attained the age of 55. See §§ 16.576, 16.577(2), 61.592(4). An employee eligible under either route will receive a pension calculated in the same way: Kentucky multiplies years of service times 2.5% times final preretirement pay. See § 16.576(3).</p>\n<p>Kentucky's Plan has special provisions for hazardous position workers who become disabled but are not yet eligible for normal retirement. Where such an employee has worked for five years or became disabled in the line of duty, the employee can retire at once. See §§ 16.576(1), 16.582(2) (Lexis 2003). In calculating that employee's benefits Kentucky will add a certain number of (\"imputed\") years to the employee's actual years of service. The number of imputed years equals the number of years that the disabled employee would have had to continue working in order to become eligible for normal retirement benefits, <i>i.e.,</i> the years necessary to bring the employee up to 20 years of service or to at least 5 years of service when the employee would turn 55 (whichever number of years is lower). See § 16.582(5)(a) (Lexis 2003). Thus, if an employee with 17 years of service becomes disabled at age 48, the Plan adds 3 years and calculates the benefits as if the employee had completed 20 years of service. If an employee with 17 years of service becomes disabled at age 54, the Plan adds 1 year and calculates the benefits as if the employee had retired at age 55 with 18 years of service.</p>\n<p>The Plan also imposes a ceiling on imputed years equal to the number of years the employee has previously worked (<i>i.e.,</i> an employee who has worked eight years cannot receive more than eight additional imputed years), see § 16.582(5)(a); it provides for a certain minimum payment, see § 16.582(6) (Lexis 2003); and it contains various other details, none of which is challenged here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Charles Lickteig, a hazardous position worker in the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, became eligible for retirement at age 55, continued to work, became disabled, and then retired at age 61. The Plan calculated his annual pension on the basis of his actual years of service (18 years) times 2.5% times his final annual pay. Because Lickteig became disabled after he had already become eligible for normal retirement benefits, the Plan did not impute any additional years for purposes of the calculation.</p>\n<p>Lickteig complained of age discrimination to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC); and the EEOC then brought this age discrimination lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Kentucky's Plan administrator, and other state entities (to whom we shall refer collectively as \"Kentucky\"). The EEOC pointed out that, if Lickteig had become disabled before he reached the age of 55, the Plan, in calculating Lickteig's benefits would have imputed a number of additional years. And the EEOC argued that the Plan failed to impute years solely because Lickteig became disabled after he reached age 55.</p>\n<p>The District Court, making all appropriate evidence-related assumptions in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2366</span> EEOC's favor, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56, held that the EEOC could not establish age discrimination; and it granted summary judgment in the defendants' favor. A panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed that judgment. <i>EEOC v. Jefferson Cty.

The Court noted that \"[t]he employer may have relied upon a formal, facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment\" because of age, or \"the employer may have been motivated by [age] on an ad hoc, informal basis.\" <i>Hazen Paper,</i> 507 U.S., at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701. But \"[w]hatever the employer's decisionmaking process,\" a plaintiff alleging disparate treatment cannot succeed unless the employee's age <i>\"actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.\" Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Cf. <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 239-240, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005) (plurality opinion) (describing \"disparate-impact\" theory, not here at issue, which focuses upon unjustified discriminatory results).</p>\n<p>In <i>Hazen Paper</i> the Court considered a disparate treatment claim that an employer had unlawfully dismissed a 62-year-old employee with over 9½ years of service in order to avoid paying pension benefits that would have vested after 10 years. The Court held that, without more evidence of intent, the ADEA would not forbid dismissal of the claim. A dismissal based on pension status was not a dismissal \"because. . . of age.\" 507 U.S., at 611-612, 113 S.Ct. 1701. Of course, pension status depended upon years of service, and years of service typically go hand in hand with age. <i>Id.,</i> at 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701. But the two concepts were nonetheless \"analytically distinct.\" <i>Ibid.</i> An employer could easily \"take account of one while ignoring the other.\" <i>Ibid.</i> And the dismissal in question, if based purely upon pension status (related to years of service), would not embody the evils that led Congress to enact the ADEA in the first place: The dismissal was not based on a \"prohibited <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2367</span> stereotype\" of older workers, did not produce any \"attendant stigma\" to those workers, and was not \"the result of an inaccurate and denigrating generalization about age.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 612, 113 S.Ct. 1701.</p>\n<p>At the same time, <i>Hazen Paper</i> indicated that discrimination on the basis of pension status could <i>sometimes</i> be unlawful under the ADEA, in particular where pension status served as a \"proxy for age.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701. Suppose, for example, an employer \"target[ed] employees with a particular pension status on the assumption that these employees are likely to be older.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 612-613, 113 S.Ct. 1701. In such a case, <i>Hazen Paper</i> suggested, age, not pension status, would have \"actually motivated\" the employer's decision-making. <i>Hazen Paper</i> also left open \"the special case where an employee is about to vest in pension benefits as a result of his <i>age,</i> rather than years of service.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701. We here consider a variation on this \"special case\" theme.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Kentucky's Plan turns normal pension eligibility <i>either</i> upon the employee's having attained 20 years of service alone <i>or</i> upon the employees having attained 5 years of service and reached the age of 55. The ADEA permits an employer to condition pension eligibility upon age. See 29 U.S.C.A. § 623(<i>l</i>)(1)(A)(i) (Supp.2007). Thus we must decide whether a plan that (1) lawfully makes age in part a condition of pension eligibility, and (2) treats workers differently in light of their pension status, (3) <i>automatically</i> discriminates <i>because of</i> age. The Government argues \"yes.\" But, following <i>Hazen Paper</i>'s approach, we come to a different conclusion. In particular, the following circumstances, taken together, convince us that, in this particular instance, differences in treatment were not \"actually motivated\" by age.</p>\n<p><i>First,</i> as a matter of pure logic, age and pension status remain \"analytically distinct\" concepts. <i>Hazen Paper,</i> 507 U.S., at 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701. That is to say, one can easily conceive of decisions that are actually made \"because of\" pension status and not age, even where pension status is itself based on age. Suppose, for example that an employer pays all retired workers a pension, retirement eligibility turns on age, say 65, and a 70-year-old worker retires. Nothing in language or in logic prevents one from concluding that the employer has begun to pay the worker a pension, not because the worker is over 65, but simply because the worker has retired.</p>\n<p><i>Second,</i> several background circumstances eliminate the possibility that pension status, though analytically distinct from age, nonetheless serves as a \"proxy for age\" in Kentucky's Plan. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701. We consider not an individual employment decision, but a set of complex systemwide rules. These systemic rules involve, not wages, but pensions a benefit that the ADEA treats somewhat more flexibly and leniently in respect to age. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 29 U.S.C.A. § 623(<i>l</i>)(1)(A)(i) (Supp.2007) (explicitly allowing pension eligibility to turn on age); 29 U.S.C. § 623(<i>l</i>)(2)(A) (allowing employer to consider (age-related) pension benefits in determining level of severance pay); § 623(<i>l</i>)(3) (allowing employer to consider (age-related) pension benefits in determining level of long-term disability benefits). And the specific benefit at issue here is offered to all hazardous position workers on the same nondiscriminatory terms <i>ex ante.</i> That is to say, every such employee, when hired, is promised disability retirement benefits should he become disabled <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2368</span> prior to the time that he is eligible for normal retirement benefits.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Congress has otherwise approved of programs that calculate permanent disability benefits using a formula that expressly takes account of age. For example, the Social Security Administration now uses such a formula in calculating Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 42 U.S.C. § 415(b)(2)(B)(iii); 20 CFR § 404.211(e) (2007). And until (and in some cases after) 1984, federal employees received permanent disability benefits based on a formula that, in certain circumstances, did not just consider age, but effectively imputed years of service only to those disabled workers younger than 60. See 5 U.S.C. § 8339(g) (2006 ed.); see also Office of Personnel Management, Disability Retirement Under the Civil Service Retirement System, Retirement Facts 4, p. 3 (rev.Nov.1997), on line at http://www.opm.gov/forms/ pdfimage/RI83-4.pdf (as visited June 16, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\n<p><i>Third,</i> there is a clear non-age-related rationale for the disparity here at issue. The manner in which Kentucky calculates disability retirement benefits is in every important respect but one identical to the manner in which Kentucky calculates normal retirement benefits. The one significant difference consists of the fact that the Plan imputes additional years of service to disabled individuals. But the Plan imputes <i>only</i> those years needed to bring the disabled worker's years of service to 20 or to the number of years that the individual would have worked had he worked to age 55. The disability rules clearly track Kentucky's normal retirement rules.</p>\n<p>It is obvious, then, that the whole purpose of the disability rules is, as Kentucky claims, to treat a disabled worker as though he had become disabled after, rather than before, he had become eligible for normal retirement benefits. Age factors into the disability calculation only because the normal retirement rules themselves permissibly include age as a consideration. No one seeking to help disabled workers in the way that Kentucky's rules seek to help those workers would care whether Kentucky's normal system turned eligibility in part upon age or upon other, different criteria.</p>\n<p>That this is so is suggested by the fact that one can readily construct a plan that produces an identical disparity but is age neutral. Suppose that Kentucky's Plan made eligible for a pension (a) day-shift workers who have 20 years of service, and (b) night-shift workers who have 15 years of service. Suppose further that the Plan calculates the amount of the pension the same way in either case, which method of calculation depends solely upon years of service (say, giving the worker a pension equal to $1,000 for each year of service). If the Plan were then to provide workers who become disabled prior to pension eligibility the same pension the workers would have received had they worked until they became pension eligible, the plan would create a disparity between disabled day-shift and night-shift workers: A day-shift worker who becomes disabled <i>before</i> becoming pension eligible would, in many instances, end up receiving a bigger pension than a night-shift worker who becomes disabled <i>after</i> becoming pension eligible. For example, a day-shift worker who becomes disabled prior to becoming pension-eligible would receive an annual pension of $20,000, while a night-shift worker who becomes disabled after becoming pension-eligible, say, after 16 years of service, would receive an annual pension of $16,000.</p>\n<p>The disparity in this example is not \"actually motivated\" by bias against night-shift workers. Rather, such a disparity, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2369</span> like the disparity in the case before us, is simply an artifact of Plan rules that treat one set of workers more generously in respect to the <i>timing of their eligibility for normal retirement benefits</i> but which do not treat them more generously in respect to the <i>calculation of the amount</i> of their normal retirement benefits. The example helps to show that the Plan at issue in this case simply seeks to treat disabled employees as if they had worked until the point at which they would be eligible for a normal pension. The disparity turns upon pension eligibility and nothing more.</p>\n<p><i>Fourth,</i> although Kentucky's Plan placed an older worker at a disadvantage in this case, in other cases, it can work to the <i>advantage</i> of older workers. Consider, for example, two disabled workers, one of whom is aged 45 with 10 years of service, one of whom is aged 40 with 15 years of service. Under Kentucky's scheme, the older worker would actually get a bigger boost of imputed years than the younger worker (10 years would be imputed to the former, while only 5 years would be imputed to the latter). And that fact helps to confirm that the underlying motive is not an effort to discriminate \"because of . . . age.\"</p>\n<p><i>Fifth,</i> Kentucky's system does not rely on any of the sorts of stereotypical assumptions that the ADEA sought to eradicate. It does not rest on any stereotype about the work capacity of \"older\" workers <i>relative to</i> \"younger\" workers. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131162\"><a href=\"/opinion/131162/general-dynamics-land-systems-inc-v-cline/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 590, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004) (noting that except on one point, all the findings and statements of objectives in the ADEA are \"either cast in terms of the effects of age as intensifying over time, or are couched in terms that refer to `older' workers, explicitly or implicitly <i>relative to</i> `younger' ones\" (emphasis added)). The Plan does assume that all disabled workers would have worked to the point at which they would have become eligible for a pension. It also assumes that no disabled worker would have continued working beyond the point at which he was both (1) disabled; and (2) pension eligible. But these \"assumptions\" do not involve age-related stereotypes, and they apply equally to <i>all</i> workers, regardless of age.</p>\n<p><i>Sixth,</i> the nature of the Plan's eligibility requirements means that, unless Kentucky were severely to cut the benefits given to disabled workers who are not yet pension eligible (which Kentucky claims it will do if its present Plan is unlawful), Kentucky would have to increase the benefits available to disabled, pension-eligible workers, while lacking any clear criteria for determining how many extra years to impute for those pension-eligible workers who already are 55 or older. The difficulty of finding a remedy that can both correct the disparity and achieve the Plan's legitimate objectiveproviding each disabled worker with a sufficient retirement benefit, namely, the normal retirement benefit that the worker would receive if he were pension eligible at the time of disabilityfurther suggests that this objective and not age \"actually motivated\" the Plan.</p>\n<p>The above factors all taken together convince us that the Plan does not, on its face, create treatment differences that are \"actually motivated\" by age. And, for present purposes, we accept the District Court's finding that the Government has pointed to no additional evidence that might permit a factfinder to reach a contrary conclusion. See App. 28-30.</p>\n<p>It bears emphasizing that our opinion in no way unsettles the rule that a statute or policy that facially discriminates based on age suffices to show disparate treatment under the ADEA. We are dealing today with the quite special case of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2370</span> differential treatment based on <i>pension status,</i> where pension statuswith the explicit blessing of the ADEAitself turns, in part, on age. Further, the rule we adopt today for dealing with this sort of case is clear: Where an employer adopts a pension plan that includes age as a factor, and that employer then treats employees differently based on pension status, a plaintiff, to state a disparate treatment claim under the ADEA, must adduce sufficient evidence to show that the differential treatment was \"actually motivated\" by <i>age,</i> not pension status. And our discussion of the factors that lead us to conclude that the Government has failed to make the requisite showing in this case provides an indication of what a plaintiff might show in other cases to meet his burden of proving that differential treatment based on pension status is in fact discrimination \"because of\" age.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The Government makes two additional arguments. First, it looks for support to an amendment that Congress made to the ADEA after this Court's decision in <i>Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112321\"><a href=\"/opinion/112321/public-employees-retirement-system-of-ohio-v-betts/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2854, 106 L.Ed.2d 134 (1989). In <i>Betts,</i> the employer denied a worker disability benefits on the ground that its bona fide benefit program provided disability benefits only to workers who became disabled prior to age 60, and the worker in that case became disabled at age 61. <i>Id.,</i> at 163, 109 S.Ct. 2854. The ADEA at that time exempted from its prohibitions employment decisions taken pursuant to the terms of \"`any bona fide employee benefit plan . . . which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of' the Act.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 161, 109 S.Ct. 2854 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(2) (1982 ed., Supp. V)). And the Court held that the employer's decision fell within that exception. 492 U.S., at 182, 109 S.Ct. 2854. Subsequently Congress amended the ADEA to make clear that it covered age-based discrimination in respect to all employee benefits. See Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, § 102, 104 Stat. 978, 29 U.S.C. § 630(<i>l</i>) (2000 ed.). Congress replaced the \"not a subterfuge\" exception with a provision stating that age-based disparities in the provision of benefits are lawful only when they are justified in respect to cost savings. <i>Id.,</i> at 978-979; 29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>We agree with the Government that the amendment broadened the field of employer actions subject to antidiscrimination rules and it narrowed the statutorily available justifications for age-related differences. But these facts cannot help the Government here. We do not dispute that ADEA prohibitions apply to the Plan at issue, and our basis for finding the Plan lawful does not rest upon amendment-related justifications. Rather, we find that the discrimination is not \"actually motivated\" by age. Thus <i>Hazen Paper,</i> not <i>Betts,</i> provides relevant precedent. And the amendment cited by the Government is beside the point.</p>\n<p>Second, the Government says that we must defer to a contrary EEOC interpretation contained in an EEOC regulation and compliance manual. The regulation, however, says only that providing \"the same level of benefits to older workers as to younger workers\" does <i>not</i> violate the Act. 29 CFR § 1625.10(a)(2) (2007). The Government's interpretation of this language is not entitled to deference because, on its face, the regulation \"does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.\" <i>Gonzales v. Oregon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145693\"><a href=\"/opinion/145693/gonzales-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span>, 257, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006) (denying deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulation in light of the \"near equivalence\" of the statute and regulation).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2371</span> The Compliance Manual provides more explicitly that benefits are not \"equal\" insofar as a plan \"reduces or eliminates benefits based on a criterion that is explicitly defined (in whole or in part) by age.\" 2 EEOC Compliance Manual § 3, p. 627:00041 (2001) (bold typeface deleted). And the Compliance Manual further provides that \"[b]asing disability retirement benefits on the number of years a disabled employee <i>would have worked</i> until normal retirement age by definition gives more constructive years of service to younger than to older employees\" and thus violates the Act. See <i>id.,</i> at 627:0010.</p>\n<p>These statements, while important, cannot lead us to a different conclusion. See <i>National Railroad Passenger Corporation v.

In recent years employers and employees alike have been advised by this Court, by most Courts of Appeals, and by the agency charged with enforcing the Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), that the most straightforward reading of the statute is the correct one: When an employer makes age a factor in an employee benefit plan in a formal, facial, deliberate, and explicit manner, to the detriment of older employees, this is a violation of the Act. Disparate treatment on the basis of age is prohibited unless some exemption or defense provided in the Act applies.</p>\n<p>The Court today undercuts this basic framework. In doing so it puts the Act and its enforcement on a wrong course. The decision of the en banc panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which the Court reverses, brought that Circuit's case law into line with that of its sister Circuits. See <i>EEOC v.

By embracing the approach rejected by the en banc panel and all other Courts of Appeals that have addressed this issue, this Court creates unevenness in administration, unpredictability in litigation, and uncertainty as to employee rights once thought well settled. These consequences, and the Court's errors in interpreting the statute and our cases, require this respectful dissent.</p>\n<p>Even were the Court correct that Kentucky's facially discriminatory disability benefits plan can be justified by a proper motive, the employer's own submission to us reveals that the plan's discriminatory classification rests upon a stereotypical assumption that itself violates the Act and the Court's own analytical framework.</p>\n<p>As a threshold matter, all should concede that the paradigm offered to justify the statute is a powerful one: The young police officer or firefighter with a family is disabled in the heroic performance of his or her duty. Disability payments are increased to account for unworked years of service. What the Court overlooks, however, is that a 61-year-old officer or firefighter who is disabled in the same heroic action receives, in many instances, a lower payment and for one reason alone: By explicit command of Kentucky's disability plan age is an express disadvantage in calculating the disability payment.</p>\n<p>This is a straightforward act of discrimination on the basis of age. Though the Commonwealth is entitled by the law, in some instances, to defend an age-based differential as cost justified, 29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(2)(B)(ii), that has yet to be established here. What an employer cannot do, and what the Court ought not to do, is to pretend that this explicit discrimination based on age is somehow consistent with the broad statutory and regulatory prohibition against disparate treatment based on age.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The following appears to be common ground for both sides of the dispute: Kentucky operates dual retirement systems for employees in hazardous occupations. An employee is eligible for normal retirement if he or she has accumulated 20 years of service with the Commonwealth, or is over age 55 and has accumulated at least 5 years of service. If the employee can no longer work as a result of a disability, however, he or she is entitled to receive disability retirement. Employees who are eligible for normal retirement benefits are ineligible for disability retirement. See Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. §§ 16.576, 16.577(2) (Lexis 2003), 61.592(4) (Lexis Cum.Supp. 2003).</p>\n<p>The distinction between normal and disability retirement is not just a difference of nomenclature. Under the normal retirement system benefits are calculated by multiplying a percentage of the employee's pay at retirement by years of service. See § 16.576(3) (Lexis 2003). Under the disability system the years-of-service multiplier includes not only the employee's actual years of service but also the number of years it would have taken the employee to become eligible for normal retirement (subject to a cap equal to the number of actual years served). See § 16.582(5)(a). In other words employees in the normal retirement system are compensated based solely on their actual years of service; but employees in the disability retirement system get a bonus, which accounts for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2373</span> number of years the employee would have worked had he or she remained healthy until becoming eligible to receive normal retirement benefits.</p>\n<p>Whether intended or not, the result of these divergent benefits formulae is a system that, in some cases, compensates otherwise similarly situated individuals differently on the basis of age. Consider two covered workers, one 45 and one 55, both with five years of service with the Commonwealth and an annual salary of $60,000. If we assume both become disabled in the same accident, the 45-year-old will be entitled to receive $1,250 in monthly benefits; the 55-year-old will receive $625, just half as much. The benefit disparity results from the Commonwealth's decision, under the disability retirement formula, to credit the 45-year-old with 5 years of unworked service (thereby increasing the appliable years-service-multipler to 10 years), while the 55-year-old's benefits are based only on actual years of service (5 years). In that instance age is the only factor that accounts for the disparate treatment.</p>\n<p>True, age is not a factor that reduces benefits in every case. If a worker has accumulated 20 years of service with the Commonwealth before he or she becomes disabled, age plays no role in the benefits calculation. But there is no question that, in many cases, a disabled worker over the age of 55 who has accumulated fewer than 20 years of service receives a lower monthly stipend than otherwise similarly situated workers who are under 55. The Court concludes this result is something other than discrimination on the basis of age only by ignoring the statute and our past opinions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>It is difficult to find a clear rule of law in the list of policy arguments the Court makes to justify its holding. The difficulty is compounded by the Court's own analysis. The Court concedes that, in this case, Kentucky's plan \"placed an older worker at a disadvantage,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2369; yet it proceeds to hold that the Commonwealth's disparate treatment of its workers was not \"`actually motivated' by age,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2369. The Court's apparent rationale is that, even when it is evident that a benefits plan discriminates on its face on the basis of age, an ADEA plaintiff still must provide additional evidence that the employer acted with an \"underlying motive,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2368-2369, to treat older workers less favorably than younger workers.</p>\n<p>The Court finds no support in the text of the statute. In the wake of <i>Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112321\"><a href=\"/opinion/112321/public-employees-retirement-system-of-ohio-v-betts/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2854, 106 L.Ed.2d 134 (1989), where the Court held that bona fide employee benefit plans were exempt from the coverage of the ADEA, Congress amended the Act to provide that an employee benefit plan that discriminates on the basis of age is unlawful, except when the employer establishes entitlement to one of the affirmative defenses Congress has provided. See Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA), 104 Stat. 978, codified at 29 U.S.C. § 623(f). As a result of the OWBPA, an employer cannot operate an employee benefit plan in a manner that \"discriminate[s] against any individual . . . because of such individual's age,\" § 623(a), except when the plan is a \"voluntary early retirement incentive plan\" or when \"the actual amount of payment made or cost incurred on behalf of an older worker is no less than that made or incurred on behalf of a younger worker,\" §§ 623(f)(2)(B)(i)-(ii); see generally B. Lindemann &amp; D. Kadue, Age Discrimination in Employment Law 175 (2003). Under any common understanding of the statute's terms a disability plan that pays older <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2374</span> workers less than younger workers on the basis of age \"discriminate[s] . . . because of . . . age.\" That is how the agency that administers the statute, the EEOC, understands it. See 2 EEOC Compliance Manual § 3, p. 627:0004 (2001) (\"[B]enefits will not be equal where a plan reduces or eliminates benefits based on a criterion that is explicitly defined (in whole or in part) by age\"). And the employer here has not shown that any of the affirmative defenses or exemptions to the Act applies. That should be the end of the matter; the employer is liable unless it can make such a showing.</p>\n<p>The Court's holding stems, it asserts, from a statement in <i>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112844\"><a href=\"/opinion/112844/hazen-paper-co-v-biggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993), that an employment practice discriminates only if it is \"`actually motivated'\" by the protected trait. <i>Ante,</i> at 2366 (quoting <i>Hazen Paper,</i> 507 U.S., at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701; emphasis deleted). If this phrase had been used without qualification, the Court's interpretation of it might have been justified. If one reads the relevant passage in full (with particular emphasis on the second sentence), however, <i>Hazen Paper</i> makes quite clear that no additional proof of motive is required in an ADEA case once the employment policy at issue is deemed discriminatory on its face. The Court said this:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In a disparate treatment case, liability depends on whether the protected trait (under the ADEA, age) actually motivated the employer's decision. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,</i> 460 U.S. 711[, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403] (1983); <i>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v.

The employer may have relied upon a formal, facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of employees with that trait. <i>See, e.g.,</i> [<i>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.</i>] <i>Thurston,</i> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111290\"><a href=\"/opinion/111290/trans-world-airlines-inc-v-thurston/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985)]; <i>Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v.

Or the employer may have been motivated by the protected trait on an ad hoc, informal basis. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Anderson v. Bessemer City,</i> 470 U.S. 564[, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518] (1985); <i>Teamsters</i> [<i>v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, 334-343, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977)]. Whatever the employer's decisionmaking process, a disparate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee's protected trait actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In context the paragraph identifies a decision made in reliance on a \"facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of employees with [a protected] trait\" as a type of employment action that is \"actually motivated\" by that trait. By interpreting <i>Hazen Paper</i> to say that a formal, facial, explicit, mandated, age-based differential does not suffice to establish a disparate-treatment violation (subject to statutory defenses and exemptions), it misconstrues the precedent upon which its entire theory of this case is built. The Court was right in <i>Hazen Paper</i> and is wrong here.</p>\n<p>At a minimum the Court should not cite <i>Hazen Paper</i> to support what it now holds. Its conclusion that no disparate-treatment violation has been established here conflicts with the longstanding rule in ADEA cases. The ruleconfirmed by the quoted text in <i>Hazen Paper</i>is that once the plaintiff establishes that a policy discriminates on its face, no additional proof of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2375</span> less-than-benign motive for the challenged employment action is required. For if the plan discriminates on its face, it is obvious that decisions made pursuant to the plan are \"actually motivated\" by age. The EEOC (or the employee) must prevail unless the employer can justify its action under one of the enumerated statutory defenses or exemptions.</p>\n<p>Two cases cited in <i>Hazen Paper</i> as examples of \"formal, facially discriminatory polic[ies],\" stand for this proposition. See <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111290\"><a href=\"/opinion/111290/trans-world-airlines-inc-v-thurston/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985); <i>Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v.

The policy allowed pilots to continue working for the airline past the mandatory retirement age of 60 if they transferred to the position of flight engineer. 469 U.S., at 115-116, 105 S.Ct. 613. But the 60-year-old pilot had to bid for the position. Under the bid procedures a pilot who became ineligible to remain at the controls on account of a disability (or even outright incompetence) had priority over a pilot forced out due to age. <i>Id.,</i> at 116-117, 105 S.Ct. 613. The Court held the burden-shifting framework of <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), which is used to determine whether there was a discriminatory motive at play, had no application because the policy was \"discriminatory on its face.\" 469 U.S., at 121, 105 S.Ct. 613.</p>\n<p><i>Manhart,</i> a Title VII case, involved a municipal employees' retirement plan that forced female employees to make larger contributions than their male counterparts. The Court noted that even if there were no evidence that the policy had a discriminatory \"effect,\" \"that evidence does not defeat the claim that the practice, on its face, discriminated against every individual woman employed by the Department.\" 435 U.S., at 716, 98 S.Ct. 1370.</p>\n<p>Just as the majority misunderstands <i>Hazen Paper</i>'s reference to employment practices that are \"actually motivated\" by age, so too does it overstate what the <i>Hazen Paper</i> Court meant when it observed that pension status and age are \"analytically distinct.\" 507 U.S., at 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701. The Court now reads this language as creating a virtual safe harbor for policies that discriminate on the basis of pension status, even when pension status is tied directly to age and then linked to another type of benefit program. The <i>Hazen Paper</i> Court did not allow, or support, this result. In <i>Hazen Paper</i> pension status and age were \"analytically distinct\" because the employee's eligibility to receive a pension formally had nothing to do with age; pension status was tied solely to years of service. The Court recognized that age and pension status were correlated (because older workers were more likely to be pension eligible); but the Court found the plan to be facially neutral with regard to age precisely because age and pension status were not expressly linked under the terms of the plan. See <i>id.,</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701 (noting that \"we do not consider the special case where an employee is about to vest in pension benefits as a result of his <i>age,</i> rather than years of service\"). In order to prove disparate-treatment liability the <i>Hazen Paper</i> Court held that the plaintiff needed to provide additional evidence that his termination in fact was motivated by age. <i>Id.,</i> at 613-614, 113 S.Ct. 1701.</p>\n<p>The saving feature that was controlling in <i>Hazen Paper</i> is absent here. This case is the opposite of <i>Hazen Paper.</i> Here the age distinction is active and present, not superseded and absent. Age is a determining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2376</span> factor of pension eligibility for all workers over the age of 55 who have over 5 (but less than 20) years of service; and pension status, in turn, is used to determine eligibility for disability benefits. For these employees, pension status and age are not \"analytically distinct\" in any meaningful sense; they merge into one category. When it treats these employees differently on the basis of pension eligibility, Kentucky facially discriminates on the basis of age. Were this not the case, there would be no facial age discrimination if an employer divided his employees into two teams based upon ageputting all workers over the age of 65 on \"Team A\" and all other workers on \"Team B\"and then paid Team B members twice the salary of their Team A counterparts, not on the basis of age (the employer would declare) but of team designation. Neither <i>Hazen Paper</i> nor the plain text of the ADEA can be read to permit this result.</p>\n<p>The closest the Court comes to reconciling its holding with the actual text of the statute is its citation to the Act's exemption allowing employers to condition pension eligibility on age. <i>Ante,</i> at 2367. Of course, the fact that it invokes an exemption is a concession by the Court that the Act otherwise would condemn the age-based classification Kentucky's disability plan makes. But the exemption provides no support for the Court's holding in any event. Its coverage is limited to \"employee pension benefit plan[s] [that] provid[e] for the attainment of a minimum age as a condition of eligibility for normal or early retirement benefits.\" See 29 U.S.C.A. § 623(<i>l</i>)(1)(A)(i) (Supp.2007). There is no farther reaching exemption for subsequent employment decisions based upon pension eligibility. And to the extent the Court finds such a loophole to be implicit in the text of the statute, a disability benefits program of the sort at issue here is not the only type of employment policy that fits through it. If the ADEA allows an employer to tie disability benefits to an age-based pension status designation, that same designation can be used to determine wages, hours, heath care benefits, reimbursements, job assignments, promotions, office space, transportation vouchers, parking privileges, and any other conceivable benefit or condition of employment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court recognizes some of the difficulties with its position and seeks to limit its holding, yet it does so in ways not permitted by statute or our previous employment discrimination cases.</p>\n<p>The Court notes that age is not the sole determining factor of pension eligibility but is instead just one factor embedded in a set of \"complex system-wide rules.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2367. There is no suggestion in our prior ADEA cases, however, and certainly none in our related Title VII jurisprudence, that discrimination based on a protected trait is permissible if the protected trait is one among many variables.</p>\n<p>This is quite evident when the protected trait is necessarily a controlling, outcome-determinative factor in calculating employee benefits. In <i>Manhart,</i> for instance, sex was not the only factor determining how much an employee was required to contribute to the pension plan on a monthly basis; the employee's salary, age, and length of service were also variables in the equation. 435 U.S., at 705, 98 S.Ct. 1370; Brief for Petitioners in <i>Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart</i><i>,</i> O.T.1977, No. 76-1810, p. 23. And even though the employer's decision to require higher contributions from female employees was based upon an actuarially sound premise that women have longer life expectancies than menthe Court held that the plan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2377</span> discriminated on its face. 435 U.S., at 711, 98 S.Ct. 1370.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we have said that the ADEA's substantive prohibitions, which were \"derived <i>in haec verba</i> from Title VII,\" <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109777\"><a href=\"/opinion/109777/lorillard-v-pons/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 584, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978), require the employer \"to ignore an employee's age (absent a statutory exemption or defense),\" <i>Hazen Paper,</i> 507 U.S., at 612, 113 S.Ct. 1701. This statement perhaps has been qualified by the Court's subsequent holding in <i>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131162\"><a href=\"/opinion/131162/general-dynamics-land-systems-inc-v-cline/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004), that the ADEA does not forbid employers from discriminating in favor of older workers to the detriment of younger workers. Reasonable minds may have disagreed about the merits of <i>Cline</i>'s holding. See <i>id.,</i> at 601, 124 S.Ct. 1236 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); see also <i>id.,</i> at 602, 124 S.Ct. 1236 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). But <i>Cline</i> does not dictate the path the Court chooses here. For it is one thing to interpret a statute designed to combat age discrimination in a way that benefits older workers to the detriment of younger workers; it is quite another to do what the Court does in this case, which is to interpret the ADEA to allow a discriminatory employment practice that disfavors older workers while favoring younger ones. The Court, moreover, achieved the result in <i>Cline</i> by reading the word \"age\" to mean \"old age\" <i>i.e.,</i> by reading \"discriminat[ion] . . . because of [an] individual's age,\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a), to mean discrimination because of an individual's advanced age. See <i>Cline, supra,</i> at 596, 124 S.Ct. 1236. Here the Court seems to adopt a new definition of the term \"discriminate\" by holding that there is no discrimination on the basis of a protected trait if the trait is one among several factors that bear upon how an employee is treated. There is no principled way to draw this distinction, and the Court does not attempt to do so. Cf. <i>Manhart, supra,</i> at 710, 98 S.Ct. 1370 (\"[T]here is no reason to believe that Congress intended a special definition of discrimination in the context of employee group insurance coverage\").</p>\n<p>The Court recites what it sees as \"several background circumstances [that] eliminate the possibility that pension status, though analytically distinct from age, nonetheless serves as a `proxy for age' in Kentucky's Plan.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2367. Among these is a \"clear non-age-related rationale,\" <i>ibid.,</i> \"to treat a disabled worker as though he had become disabled after, rather than before, he had become eligible for normal retirement benefits,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2368. There is a difference, however, between a laudable purpose and a rule of law.</p>\n<p>An otherwise discriminatory employment action cannot be rendered lawful because the employer's motives were benign. In <i>Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112563\"><a href=\"/opinion/112563/automobile-workers-v-johnson-controls-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. 1196, 113 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991), the employer had a policy barring all female employees, except those who were infertile, from performing jobs that exposed them to lead. The employer said its policy was designed not to reinforce negative gender stereotypes but to protect female employees' unborn children against the risk of birth defects. <i>Id.,</i> at 191, 111 S.Ct. 1196. The argument did not prevail. The plan discriminated on its face on the basis of sex, and the employer did not establish a bona fide occupational qualification defense. As a result, the Court held that the restriction violated Title VII. \"[T]he absence of a malevolent motive [did] not convert a facially discriminatory plan into a neutral policy with a discriminatory effect.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 199, 111 S.Ct. 1196.</p>\n<p>Still, even if our cases allowed the motive qualification the Court puts forth to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2378</span> justify a facial and operative distinction based upon age, the plan at issue here does not survive the Court's own test. We need look no further than the Commonwealth's own brief for evidence that its motives are contrary to the ADEA. In its brief the Commonwealth refers to the 61-year-old complainant in this case, Charles Lickteig, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"An employee in Mr. Lickteig's position has had an extra 21 years to devote to making money, providing for himself and his family, saving funds for retirement, and accruing years that will increase his retirement benefits. Thus, the 40-year-old employee is likely to need more of a boost.\" Brief for Petitioners 23.</blockquote>\n<p>The hypothetical younger worker seems entitled to a boost only if one accepts that the younger worker had more productive years of work left in him at the time of his injury than Lickteig did. As an actuarial matter, this assumption may be sound. It is an impermissible basis for differential treatment under the ADEA, however. As we said in <i>Hazen Paper,</i> the idea that \"productivity and competence decline with old age\" is the \"very essence of age discrimination.\" 507 U.S., at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701. By forbidding age discrimination against any \"individual,\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a), the ADEA forbids employers from using the blunt tool of age to assess an employee's future productivity. Cf. <i>Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111474\"><a href=\"/opinion/111474/western-air-lines-inc-v-criswell/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 409, 105 S.Ct. 2743, 86 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985) (noting the Labor Department's findings that \"the process of psychological and physiological degeneration caused by aging varies with each individual\"). Whether this is good public policy in all instances might be debatable. Until Congress sees fit to change the language of the statute, however, there is no principled basis for upholding Kentucky's disability benefits formula.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>As explained in this dissent, Kentucky's disability retirement plan violates the ADEA, an Act intended to promote the interests of older Americans. Yet it is no small irony that it does so, at least in part, because the Commonwealth's normal retirement plan treats older workers in a particularly generous fashion. Kentucky allows its employees to retire at the age of 55 if they have accumulated only five years of service. But for this provision, which links age and years of service in a way that benefits older workers, pension eligibility would be a function solely of tenure, not age. Accordingly, this case would be more like <i>Hazen Paper,</i> and the EEOC's case would be much weaker. Similarly, as the Court notes, <i>ante,</i> at 2369, Kentucky could avoid any problems by not imputing unworked years of service to any disabled workers, old and young alike. Neither change to the plan would result in more generous treatment for older workers. The only difference would be that, under the first example, older workers would lose the option of early retirement, and, under the second, younger workers would see their benefits cut. These are not the only possible remediesthe Commonwealth could impute unworked years of service to all employees forced into retirement on account of a disability regardless of age.</p>\n<p>The Court's desire to avoid construing the ADEA in a way that encourages the Commonwealth to eliminate its early retirement program or to reduce benefits to the policemen and firefighters who are covered under the disability plan is understandable. But, under our precedents, \"`[a] benefit that is part and parcel of the employment relationship may not be doled out in a discriminatory fashion, even if the employer would be free . . . not to provide the benefit at all.'\" <i>Thurston,</i> 469 U.S., at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2379</span> 121, 105 S.Ct. 613 (quoting <i>Hishon v.

If Kentucky's facially discriminatory plan is good public policy, the answer is not for this Court to ignore its precedents and the plain text of the statute.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, in my view, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed and the case remanded for a determination whether the State can assert a cost-justification defense.</p>\n</div>", "id": 145787, "judges": "Breyer", "local_path": "pdf/2008/06/19/Kentucky_Retirement_Systems_v._EEOC.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2007                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 9, 2008—Decided June 19, 2008\nKentucky permits “hazardous position” workers, e.g., policemen, to re-\n ceive normal retirement benefits after working either 20 years or 5\n years and attaining age 55 and pays “disability retirement” benefits\n to workers meeting specified requirements. Kentucky’s “Plan” calcu-\n lates normal retirement benefits based on actual years of service.\n The Plan calculates disability benefits by adding to an employee’s ac-\n tual years of service the number of years that the employee would\n have had to continue working in order to become eligible for normal\n retirement benefits, adding no more than the number of years the\n employee had previously worked. Charles Lickteig, who continued\n working after becoming eligible for retirement at age 55, became dis-\n abled and retired at age 61. He filed an age discrimination complaint\n with respondent (EEOC) after the Plan based his pension on his ac-\n tual years of service without imputing any additional years. The\n EEOC filed suit against Kentucky and others (collectively Kentucky),\n arguing that the Plan failed to impute years solely because Lickteig\n became disabled after age 55. The District Court granted Kentucky\n summary judgment, holding that the EEOC could not establish age\n discrimination, but the Sixth Circuit ultimately reversed on the\n ground that the Plan violated the Age Discrimination in Employment\n Act of 1967 (ADEA).\nHeld: Kentucky’s system does not discriminate against workers who\n become disabled after becoming eligible for retirement based on age.\n Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) The ADEA forbids an employer to “discriminate against any in-\n dividual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privi-\n leges of employment, because of such individual’s age.” 29 U. S. C.\n2            KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    §623(a)(1) (emphasis added). A plaintiff claiming age-related “dispa-\n    rate treatment” (i.e., intentional discrimination) must prove that age\n    “actually motivated the employer’s decision.” Hazen Paper Co. v.\n    Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610 (emphasis added). In Hazen Paper, the\n    Court found that, without evidence of intent, a dismissal based on\n    pension status was not a dismissal “because . . . of age,” id., at 611–\n    612, noting that, though pension status depended upon years of ser-\n    vice, and years of service typically go hand in hand with age, the two\n    concepts are “analytically distinct,” id., at 611. And the dismissal at\n    issue there, if based purely on pension status, would not embody the\n    evils prompting the ADEA: It was not based on a “prohibited stereo-\n    type” of older workers, did not produce any “attendant stigma” to\n    those workers, and was not “the result of an inaccurate and denigrat-\n    ing generalization about age.” Id., at 612. However, the Court noted\n    that discrimination based on pension status could violate the ADEA\n    if pension status was a “proxy for age.” Id., at 613. Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) Applying Hazen Paper, the circumstances here, taken together,\n    show that the differences in treatment in this particular instance\n    were not “actually motivated” by age. (1) Age and pension status re-\n    main “analytically distinct” concepts. (2) Here, several background\n    circumstances eliminate the possibility that pension status serves as\n    a “proxy for age.” Rather than an individual employment decision, at\n    issue here are complex systemwide rules involving not wages, but\n    pensions—a benefit the ADEA treats somewhat more flexibly and le-\n    niently in respect to age. Further, Congress has otherwise approved\n    programs, such as Social Security Disability Insurance, that calculate\n    disability benefits using a formula that expressly takes account of\n    age. (3) The disparity here has a clear non-age-related rationale.\n    The Plan’s disability rules track Kentucky’s “normal retirement”\n    rules by imputing only those additional years of service needed to\n    bring the disabled worker’s total to 20 or to the number of years that\n    the individual would have worked had he worked to age 55. Thus,\n    the disability rules’ purpose is to treat a disabled worker as though\n    he had become disabled after, rather than before, he had become eli-\n    gible for “normal retirement” benefits. Age factors into the disability\n    calculation only because the normal retirement rules themselves\n    permissibly consider age. The Plan simply seeks to treat disabled\n    employees as if they had worked until the point at which they would\n    be eligible for a normal pension. Thus, the disparity turns upon pen-\n    sion eligibility and nothing more. (4) Although the Plan placed an\n    older worker at a disadvantage here, in other cases, the rules can\n    work to the advantage of older workers, who may get a bigger boost\n    of imputed years than younger workers. (5) Kentucky’s system does\n    not rely on the sorts of stereotypical assumptions, e.g., the work ca-\n                     Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  pacity of “older” workers relative to “younger” workers, that the\n  ADEA sought to eradicate. The Plan’s “assumptions” that no dis-\n  abled worker would have continued to work beyond the point at\n  which he was both disabled and pension eligible do not involve age-\n  related stereotypes, but apply equally to all workers regardless of\n  age. (6) The nature of the Plan’s eligibility requirements means that,\n  unless Kentucky were severely to cut the benefits to disabled workers\n  who are not yet pension eligible, it would have to increase the bene-\n  fits available to disabled, pension-eligible workers, while lacking any\n  clear criteria for determining how many extra years to impute for\n  those already 55 or older. The difficulty of finding a remedy that can\n  both correct the disparity and achieve the Plan’s legitimate objec-\n  tive—providing each disabled worker with a sufficient retirement\n  benefit—further suggests that this objective, not age, “actually moti-\n  vated” the Plan.\n     The Court’s opinion in no way unsettles the rule that a statute or\n  policy that facially discriminates based on age suffices to show dispa-\n  rate treatment under the ADEA. The Court is dealing with the quite\n  special case of differential treatment based on pension status, where\n  pension status—with the explicit blessing of the ADEA—itself turns,\n  in part, on age. Further, the rule for dealing with this sort of case is\n  clear: Where an employer adopts a pension plan that includes age as\n  a factor, and that employer then treats employees differently based\n  on pension status, a plaintiff, to state a claim under the ADEA, must\n  adduce sufficient evidence to show that the differential treatment\n  was “actually motivated” by age, not pension status. Pp. 6–11.\n     (c) The Federal Government’s additional arguments are rejected.\n  Since Hazen Paper provides the relevant precedent here, an ADEA\n  amendment made in light of Public Employees Retirement System of\n  Ohio v. Betts, 492 U. S. 158, is beside the point. And a contrary in-\n  terpretation contained in an EEOC regulation and its compliance\n  manual does not lead to a different conclusion.

See Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§16.576,\n16.577(2) (Lexis 2003), 61.592(4) (Lexis Supp. 2003). It\npermits those who become seriously disabled but have not\notherwise become eligible for retirement to retire immedi-\nately and receive “disability retirement” benefits. See\n§16.582(2)(b) (Lexis 2003). And it treats some of those\ndisabled individuals more generously than it treats some\nof those who became disabled only after becoming eligible\nfor retirement on the basis of age. The question before us\nis whether Kentucky’s system consequently discriminates\nagainst the latter workers “because of . . . age.” Age Dis-\ncrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA or Act),\n§4(a)(1), 81 Stat. 603, 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1). We conclude\nthat it does not.\n2        KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n                               A\n   Kentucky has put in place a special retirement plan\n(Plan) for state and county employees who occupy “[h]az-\nardous position[s],” e.g., active duty law enforcement\nofficers, firefighters, paramedics, and workers in correc-\ntional systems. See Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §61.592(1)(a)\n(Lexis Supp. 2003). The Plan sets forth two routes\nthrough which such an employee can become eligible for\nwhat is called “normal retirement” benefits. The first\nmakes an employee eligible for retirement after 20 years\nof service. The second makes an employee eligible after\nonly 5 years of service provided that the employee has\nattained the age of 55. See §§16.576, 16.577(2), 61.592(4).\nAn employee eligible under either route will receive a\npension calculated in the same way: Kentucky multiplies\nyears of service times 2.5% times final preretirement pay.\nSee §16.576(3).\n   Kentucky’s Plan has special provisions for hazardous\nposition workers who become disabled but are not yet\neligible for normal retirement. Where such an employee\nhas worked for five years or became disabled in the line of\nduty, the employee can retire at once. See §§16.576(1),\n16.582(2) (Lexis 2003). In calculating that employee’s\nbenefits Kentucky will add a certain number of (“im-\nputed”) years to the employee’s actual years of service.\nThe number of imputed years equals the number of years\nthat the disabled employee would have had to continue\nworking in order to become eligible for normal retirement\nbenefits, i.e., the years necessary to bring the employee up\nto 20 years of service or to at least 5 years of service when\nthe employee would turn 55 (whichever number of years is\nlower). See §16.582(5)(a) (Lexis 2003). Thus, if an em-\nployee with 17 years of service becomes disabled at age 48,\nthe Plan adds 3 years and calculates the benefits as if the\nemployee had completed 20 years of service. If an em-\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nployee with 17 years of service becomes disabled at age 54,\nthe Plan adds 1 year and calculates the benefits as if the\nemployee had retired at age 55 with 18 years of service.\n  The Plan also imposes a ceiling on imputed years equal\nto the number of years the employee has previously\nworked (i.e., an employee who has worked eight years\ncannot receive more than eight additional imputed years),\nsee §16.582(5)(a); it provides for a certain minimum pay-\nment, see §16.582(6) (Lexis 2003); and it contains various\nother details, none of which is challenged here.\n                              B\n  Charles Lickteig, a hazardous position worker in the\nJefferson County Sheriff’s Department, became eligible for\nretirement at age 55, continued to work, became disabled,\nand then retired at age 61. The Plan calculated his an-\nnual pension on the basis of his actual years of service\n(18 years) times 2.5% times his final annual pay. Be-\ncause Lickteig became disabled after he had already\nbecome eligible for normal retirement benefits, the Plan\ndid not impute any additional years for purposes of the\ncalculation.\n  Lickteig complained of age discrimination to the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC); and the\nEEOC then brought this age discrimination lawsuit\nagainst the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Kentucky’s Plan\nadministrator, and other state entities (to whom we shall\nrefer collectively as “Kentucky”). The EEOC pointed out\nthat, if Lickteig had become disabled before he reached the\nage of 55, the Plan, in calculating Lickteig’s benefits would\nhave imputed a number of additional years. And the\nEEOC argued that the Plan failed to impute years solely\nbecause Lickteig became disabled after he reached age 55.\n  The District Court, making all appropriate evidence-\nrelated assumptions in the EEOC’s favor, see Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 56, held that the EEOC could not establish age\n4        KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscrimination; and it granted summary judgment in the\ndefendants’ favor. A panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed\nthat judgment. EEOC v. Jefferson Cty. Sheriff’s Dept., 424\nF. 3d 467 (2005). The Sixth Circuit then granted rehear-\ning en banc, held that Kentucky’s Plan did violate the\nADEA, and reversed and remanded for further proceed-\nings. 467 F. 3d 571 (2006).\n   Kentucky sought certiorari. In light of the potentially\nserious impact of the Circuit’s decision upon pension\nbenefits provided under plans in effect in many States, we\ngranted the writ. See, e.g., Ind. Code §§36–8–8–3.3(b) and\n(c) (West 2004); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§38.23 and\n38.556(2)(d) (West 2005); N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§135–1\nand 135–5 (Lexis 2007); Pa. Stat.

See also Reply Brief for Petitioners\n20–21 (predicting, inter alia, large increase in pension\nliabilities, potential reduction in benefits for all disabled\npersons, or both); Brief for National Association of State\nRetirement Administrators et al. as Amici Curiae 8–14\n(same).\n                             II\n  The ADEA forbids an employer to “fail or refuse to hire\nor to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of\nsuch individual’s age.” 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1) (emphasis\nadded). In Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604\n(1993), the Court explained that where, as here, a plaintiff\nclaims age-related “disparate treatment” (i.e., intentional\ndiscrimination “because of . . . age”) the plaintiff must\nprove that age “actually motivated the employer’s deci-\nsion.” Id., at 610 (emphasis added); see also Reeves v.\nSanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S. 133, 141\n(2000). The Court noted that “[t]he employer may have\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelied upon a formal, facially discriminatory policy requir-\ning adverse treatment” because of age, or “the employer\nmay have been motivated by [age] on an ad hoc, informal\nbasis.” Hazen Paper, 507 U. S., at 610. But “[w]hatever\nthe employer’s decisionmaking process,” a plaintiff alleg-\ning disparate treatment cannot succeed unless the em-\nployee’s age “actually played a role in that process and had\na determinative influence on the outcome.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). Cf. Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, 239–\n240 (2005) (plurality opinion) (describing “disparate-\nimpact” theory, not here at issue, which focuses upon\nunjustified discriminatory results).\n  In Hazen Paper the Court considered a disparate treat-\nment claim that an employer had unlawfully dismissed a\n62-year-old employee with over 91⁄2 years of service in\norder to avoid paying pension benefits that would have\nvested after 10 years. The Court held that, without more\nevidence of intent, the ADEA would not forbid dismissal of\nthe claim. A dismissal based on pension status was not a\ndismissal “because . . . of age.” 507 U. S., at 611–612. Of\ncourse, pension status depended upon years of service, and\nyears of service typically go hand in hand with age. Id., at\n611. But the two concepts were nonetheless “analytically\ndistinct.” Ibid. An employer could easily “take account of\none while ignoring the other.” Ibid. And the dismissal in\nquestion, if based purely upon pension status (related to\nyears of service), would not embody the evils that led\nCongress to enact the ADEA in the first place: The dis-\nmissal was not based on a “prohibited stereotype” of older\nworkers, did not produce any “attendant stigma” to those\nworkers, and was not “the result of an inaccurate and\ndenigrating generalization about age.” Id., at 612.\n  At the same time, Hazen Paper indicated that discrimi-\nnation on the basis of pension status could sometimes be\nunlawful under the ADEA, in particular where pension\nstatus served as a “proxy for age.” Id., at 613. Suppose,\n6        KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor example, an employer “target[ed] employees with a\nparticular pension status on the assumption that these\nemployees are likely to be older.” Id., at 612–613. In such\na case, Hazen Paper suggested, age, not pension status,\nwould have “actually motivated” the employer’s decision-\nmaking. Hazen Paper also left open “the special case\nwhere an employee is about to vest in pension benefits as\na result of his age, rather than years of service.” Id., at\n613. We here consider a variation on this “special case”\ntheme.\n                              III\n   Kentucky’s Plan turns normal pension eligibility either\nupon the employee’s having attained 20 years of service\nalone or upon the employees having attained 5 years of\nservice and reached the age of 55. The ADEA permits an\nemployer to condition pension eligibility upon age. See 29\nU. S. C. A. §623(l)(1)(A)(i) (Supp. 2007). Thus we must\ndecide whether a plan that (1) lawfully makes age in part\na condition of pension eligibility, and (2) treats workers\ndifferently in light of their pension status, (3) automati-\ncally discriminates because of age. The Government ar-\ngues “yes.” But, following Hazen Paper’s approach, we\ncome to a different conclusion. In particular, the following\ncircumstances, taken together, convince us that, in this\nparticular instance, differences in treatment were not\n“actually motivated” by age.\n   First, as a matter of pure logic, age and pension status\nremain “analytically distinct” concepts. Hazen Paper, 507\nU. S., at 611. That is to say, one can easily conceive of\ndecisions that are actually made “because of” pension\nstatus and not age, even where pension status is itself\nbased on age. Suppose, for example that an employer pays\nall retired workers a pension, retirement eligibility turns\non age, say 65, and a 70-year-old worker retires. Nothing\nin language or in logic prevents one from concluding that\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe employer has begun to pay the worker a pension, not\nbecause the worker is over 65, but simply because the\nworker has retired.\n  Second, several background circumstances eliminate the\npossibility that pension status, though analytically dis-\ntinct from age, nonetheless serves as a “proxy for age” in\nKentucky’s Plan. Cf. id., at 613. We consider not an\nindividual employment decision, but a set of complex\nsystemwide rules. These systemic rules involve, not\nwages, but pensions—a benefit that the ADEA treats\nsomewhat more flexibly and leniently in respect to age.\nSee, e.g., 29 U. S. C. A. §623(l)(1)(A)(i) (Supp. 2007) (ex-\nplicitly allowing pension eligibility to turn on age); 29\nU. S. C. §623(l)(2)(A) (allowing employer to consider (age-\nrelated) pension benefits in determining level of severance\npay); §623(l)(3) (allowing employer to consider (age-\nrelated) pension benefits in determining level of long-term\ndisability benefits). And the specific benefit at issue here\nis offered to all hazardous position workers on the same\nnondiscriminatory terms ex ante. That is to say, every\nsuch employee, when hired, is promised disability retire-\nment benefits should he become disabled prior to the time\nthat he is eligible for normal retirement benefits.\n  Furthermore, Congress has otherwise approved of pro-\ngrams that calculate permanent disability benefits using\na formula that expressly takes account of age. For exam-\nple, the Social Security Administration now uses such a\nformula in calculating Social Security Disability Insurance\nbenefits. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §415(b)(2)(B)(iii); 20 CFR\n§404.211(e) (2007). And until (and in some cases after)\n1984, federal employees received permanent disability\nbenefits based on a formula that, in certain circumstances,\ndid not just consider age, but effectively imputed years of\nservice only to those disabled workers younger than 60.\nSee 5 U. S. C. §8339(g) (2006 ed.); see also Office of Per-\nsonnel Management, Disability Retirement Under the\n8        KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCivil Service Retirement System, Retirement Facts 4, p. 3\n(rev. Nov. 1997), on line at http://www.opm.gov/forms/\npdfimage/RI83-4.pdf (as visited June 16, 2008, and avail-\nable in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n   Third, there is a clear non-age-related rationale for the\ndisparity here at issue. The manner in which Kentucky\ncalculates disability retirement benefits is in every impor-\ntant respect but one identical to the manner in which\nKentucky calculates normal retirement benefits. The one\nsignificant difference consists of the fact that the Plan\nimputes additional years of service to disabled individuals.\nBut the Plan imputes only those years needed to bring the\ndisabled worker’s years of service to 20 or to the number of\nyears that the individual would have worked had he\nworked to age 55. The disability rules clearly track Ken-\ntucky’s normal retirement rules.\n   It is obvious, then, that the whole purpose of the disabil-\nity rules is, as Kentucky claims, to treat a disabled worker\nas though he had become disabled after, rather than be-\nfore, he had become eligible for normal retirement bene-\nfits. Age factors into the disability calculation only be-\ncause the normal retirement rules themselves permissibly\ninclude age as a consideration. No one seeking to help\ndisabled workers in the way that Kentucky’s rules seek to\nhelp those workers would care whether Kentucky’s normal\nsystem turned eligibility in part upon age or upon other,\ndifferent criteria.\n   That this is so is suggested by the fact that one can\nreadily construct a plan that produces an identical dispar-\nity but is age neutral. Suppose that Kentucky’s Plan\nmade eligible for a pension (a) day-shift workers who have\n20 years of service, and (b) night-shift workers who have\n15 years of service. Suppose further that the Plan calcu-\nlates the amount of the pension the same way in either\ncase, which method of calculation depends solely upon\nyears of service (say, giving the worker a pension equal to\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n$1,000 for each year of service). If the Plan were then to\nprovide workers who become disabled prior to pension\neligibility the same pension the workers would have re-\nceived had they worked until they became pension eligible,\nthe plan would create a disparity between disabled day-\nshift and night-shift workers: A day-shift worker who\nbecomes disabled before becoming pension eligible would,\nin many instances, end up receiving a bigger pension than\na night-shift worker who becomes disabled after becoming\npension eligible. For example, a day-shift worker who\nbecomes disabled prior to becoming pension-eligible would\nreceive an annual pension of $20,000, while a night-shift\nworker who becomes disabled after becoming pension-\neligible, say, after 16 years of service, would receive an\nannual pension of $16,000.\n   The disparity in this example is not “actually motivated”\nby bias against night-shift workers. Rather, such a dis-\nparity, like the disparity in the case before us, is simply an\nartifact of Plan rules that treat one set of workers more\ngenerously in respect to the timing of their eligibility for\nnormal retirement benefits but which do not treat them\nmore generously in respect to the calculation of the\namount of their normal retirement benefits. The example\nhelps to show that the Plan at issue in this case simply\nseeks to treat disabled employees as if they had worked\nuntil the point at which they would be eligible for a nor-\nmal pension. The disparity turns upon pension eligibility\nand nothing more.\n   Fourth, although Kentucky’s Plan placed an older\nworker at a disadvantage in this case, in other cases, it\ncan work to the advantage of older workers. Consider, for\nexample, two disabled workers, one of whom is aged 45\nwith 10 years of service, one of whom is aged 40 with 15\nyears of service. Under Kentucky’s scheme, the older\nworker would actually get a bigger boost of imputed years\nthan the younger worker (10 years would be imputed to\n10       KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe former, while only 5 years would be imputed to the\nlatter). And that fact helps to confirm that the underlying\nmotive is not an effort to discriminate “because of . . . age.”\n   Fifth, Kentucky’s system does not rely on any of the\nsorts of stereotypical assumptions that the ADEA sought\nto eradicate. It does not rest on any stereotype about the\nwork capacity of “older” workers relative to “younger”\nworkers. See, e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc.\nv. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 590 (2004) (noting that except on\none point, all the findings and statements of objectives in\nthe ADEA are “either cast in terms of the effects of age as\nintensifying over time, or are couched in terms that refer\nto ‘older’ workers, explicitly or implicitly relative to\n‘younger’ ones” (emphasis added)). The Plan does assume\nthat all disabled workers would have worked to the point\nat which they would have become eligible for a pension. It\nalso assumes that no disabled worker would have contin-\nued working beyond the point at which he was both (1)\ndisabled; and (2) pension eligible. But these “assump-\ntions” do not involve age-related stereotypes, and they\napply equally to all workers, regardless of age.\n   Sixth, the nature of the Plan’s eligibility requirements\nmeans that, unless Kentucky were severely to cut the\nbenefits given to disabled workers who are not yet pension\neligible (which Kentucky claims it will do if its present\nPlan is unlawful), Kentucky would have to increase the\nbenefits available to disabled, pension-eligible workers,\nwhile lacking any clear criteria for determining how many\nextra years to impute for those pension-eligible workers\nwho already are 55 or older. The difficulty of finding a\nremedy that can both correct the disparity and achieve the\nPlan’s legitimate objective—providing each disabled\nworker with a sufficient retirement benefit, namely, the\nnormal retirement benefit that the worker would receive if\nhe were pension eligible at the time of disability—further\nsuggests that this objective and not age “actually moti-\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nvated” the Plan.\n   The above factors all taken together convince us that\nthe Plan does not, on its face, create treatment differences\nthat are “actually motivated” by age. And, for present\npurposes, we accept the District Court’s finding that the\nGovernment has pointed to no additional evidence that\nmight permit a factfinder to reach a contrary conclusion.\nSee App. 28–30.\n   It bears emphasizing that our opinion in no way unset-\ntles the rule that a statute or policy that facially discrimi-\nnates based on age suffices to show disparate treatment\nunder the ADEA. We are dealing today with the quite\nspecial case of differential treatment based on pension\nstatus, where pension status—with the explicit blessing of\nthe ADEA—itself turns, in part, on age. Further, the rule\nwe adopt today for dealing with this sort of case is clear:\nWhere an employer adopts a pension plan that includes\nage as a factor, and that employer then treats employees\ndifferently based on pension status, a plaintiff, to state a\ndisparate treatment claim under the ADEA, must come\nforward with sufficient evidence to show that the differen-\ntial treatment was “actually motivated” by age, not pen-\nsion status. And our discussion of the factors that lead us\nto conclude that the Government has failed to make the\nrequisite showing in this case provides an indication of\nwhat a plaintiff might show in other cases to meet his\nburden of proving that differential treatment based on\npension status is in fact discrimination “because of” age.\n                              IV\n  The Government makes two additional arguments.\nFirst, it looks for support to an amendment that Congress\nmade to the ADEA after this Court’s decision in Public\nEmployees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts, 492 U. S.\n158 (1989). In Betts, the employer denied a worker dis-\nability benefits on the ground that its bona fide benefit\n12       KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprogram provided disability benefits only to workers who\nbecame disabled prior to age 60, and the worker in that\ncase became disabled at age 61. Id., at 163. The ADEA at\nthat time exempted from its prohibitions employment\ndecisions taken pursuant to the terms of “ ‘any bona fide\nemployee benefit plan . . . which is not a subterfuge to\nevade the purposes of’ the Act.” Id., at 161 (quoting 29\nU. S. C. §623(f)(2) (1982 ed., Supp. V)). And the Court\nheld that the employer’s decision fell within that excep-\ntion. 492 U. S., at 182. Subsequently Congress amended\nthe ADEA to make clear that it covered age-based dis-\ncrimination in respect to all employee benefits. See Older\nWorkers Benefit Protection Act, §102, 104 Stat. 978, 29\nU. S. C. §630(l) (2000 ed.). Congress replaced the “not a\nsubterfuge” exception with a provision stating that age-\nbased disparities in the provision of benefits are lawful\nonly when they are justified in respect to cost savings. Id.,\nat 978–979; 29 U. S. C. §623(f)(2)(B)(i).\n   We agree with the Government that the amendment\nbroadened the field of employer actions subject to antidis-\ncrimination rules and it narrowed the statutorily available\njustifications for age-related differences. But these facts\ncannot help the Government here. We do not dispute that\nADEA prohibitions apply to the Plan at issue, and our\nbasis for finding the Plan lawful does not rest upon\namendment-related justifications. Rather, we find that\nthe discrimination is not “actually motivated” by age.\nThus Hazen Paper, not Betts, provides relevant precedent.\nAnd the amendment cited by the Government is beside the\npoint.\n   Second, the Government says that we must defer to a\ncontrary EEOC interpretation contained in an EEOC\nregulation and compliance manual. The regulation, how-\never, says only that providing “the same level of benefits to\nolder workers as to younger workers” does not violate the\nAct. 29 CFR §1625.10(a)(2) (2007). The Government’s\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation of this language is not entitled to deference\nbecause, on its face, the regulation “does little more than\nrestate the terms of the statute itself.” Gonzales v. Ore-\ngon, 546 U. S. 243, 257 (2006) (denying deference to an\nagency interpretation of its own regulation in light of the\n“near equivalence” of the statute and regulation).\n   The Compliance Manual provides more explicitly that\nbenefits are not “equal” insofar as a plan “reduces or\neliminates benefits based on a criterion that is explicitly\ndefined (in whole or in part) by age.” 2 EEOC Compliance\nManual §3, p. 627:00041 (2001) (bold typeface deleted).\nAnd the Compliance Manual further provides that\n“[b]asing disability retirement benefits on the number of\nyears a disabled employee would have worked until nor-\nmal retirement age by definition gives more constructive\nyears of service to younger than to older employees” and\nthus violates the Act. See id., at 627:0010.\n   These statements, while important, cannot lead us to a\ndifferent conclusion. See National Railroad Passenger\nCorporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 111, n. 6 (2002)\n(noting that compliance manuals are “ ‘ “entitled to re-\nspect” under our decision in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323\nU. S. 134, 140 (1944)’ ”); see also Christensen v. Harris\nCounty, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000). Following Hazen Pa-\nper, we interpret the Act as requiring a showing that the\ndiscrimination at issue “actually motivated” the em-\nployer’s decision. Given the reasons set forth in Part III,\nsupra, we conclude that evidence of that motivation was\nlacking here. And the EEOC’s statement in the Compli-\nance Manual that it automatically reaches a contrary\nconclusion—a statement that the Manual itself makes\nlittle effort to justify—lacks the necessary “power to per-\nsuade” us.

S. C. §621 et seq. That Act prohibits\nemployment actions that “discriminate against any indi-\nvidual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions,\nor privileges of employment, because of such individual’s\nage.” §623(a)(1). In recent years employers and employ-\nees alike have been advised by this Court, by most Courts\nof Appeals, and by the agency charged with enforcing the\nAct, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC), that the most straightforward reading of the\nstatute is the correct one: When an employer makes age a\nfactor in an employee benefit plan in a formal, facial,\ndeliberate, and explicit manner, to the detriment of older\nemployees, this is a violation of the Act. Disparate treat-\nment on the basis of age is prohibited unless some exemp-\ntion or defense provided in the Act applies.\n   The Court today undercuts this basic framework. In\ndoing so it puts the Act and its enforcement on a wrong\n2        KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncourse. The decision of the en banc panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit, which the Court reverses,\nbrought that Circuit’s case law into line with that of its\nsister Circuits. See EEOC v. Jefferson Cty. Sheriff’s Dept.,\n467 F. 3d 571, 573 (2006) (overturning Lyon v. Ohio Ed.\nAssn. and Professional Staff Union, 53 F. 3d 135 (1995));\nsee also, e.g., Jankovitz v. Des Moines Independent Com-\nmunity School Dist., 421 F. 3d 649, 653–655 (CA8 2005);\nAbrahamson v. Board of Ed. of Wappingers Falls Century\nSchool Dist., 374 F. 3d 66, 72–73 (CA2 2004); Arnett v.\nCalifornia Public Employees Retirement System, 179 F. 3d\n690, 695–697 (CA9 1999); Auerbach v.

By embracing the approach\nrejected by the en banc panel and all other Courts of Ap-\npeals that have addressed this issue, this Court creates\nunevenness in administration, unpredictability in litiga-\ntion, and uncertainty as to employee rights once thought\nwell settled. These consequences, and the Court’s errors\nin interpreting the statute and our cases, require this\nrespectful dissent.\n   Even were the Court correct that Kentucky’s facially\ndiscriminatory disability benefits plan can be justified by a\nproper motive, the employer’s own submission to us re-\nveals that the plan’s discriminatory classification rests\nupon a stereotypical assumption that itself violates the\nAct and the Court’s own analytical framework.\n   As a threshold matter, all should concede that the para-\ndigm offered to justify the statute is a powerful one: The\nyoung police officer or firefighter with a family is disabled\nin the heroic performance of his or her duty. Disability\npayments are increased to account for unworked years of\nservice. What the Court overlooks, however, is that a 61-\nyear-old officer or firefighter who is disabled in the same\nheroic action receives, in many instances, a lower payment\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nand for one reason alone: By explicit command of Ken-\ntucky’s disability plan age is an express disadvantage in\ncalculating the disability payment.\n  This is a straightforward act of discrimination on the\nbasis of age. Though the Commonwealth is entitled by the\nlaw, in some instances, to defend an age-based differential\nas cost justified, 29 U. S. C. §623(f)(2)(B)(ii), that has yet\nto be established here. What an employer cannot do, and\nwhat the Court ought not to do, is to pretend that this\nexplicit discrimination based on age is somehow consistent\nwith the broad statutory and regulatory prohibition\nagainst disparate treatment based on age.\n                             I\n   The following appears to be common ground for both\nsides of the dispute: Kentucky operates dual retirement\nsystems for employees in hazardous occupations. An\nemployee is eligible for normal retirement if he or she has\naccumulated 20 years of service with the Commonwealth,\nor is over age 55 and has accumulated at least 5 years of\nservice. If the employee can no longer work as a result of\na disability, however, he or she is entitled to receive dis-\nability retirement. Employees who are eligible for normal\nretirement benefits are ineligible for disability retirement.\nSee Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§16.576, 16.577(2) (Lexis 2003),\n61.592(4) (Lexis Cum. Supp. 2003).\n   The distinction between normal and disability retire-\nment is not just a difference of nomenclature. Under the\nnormal retirement system benefits are calculated by mul-\ntiplying a percentage of the employee’s pay at retirement\nby years of service. See §16.576(3) (Lexis 2003). Under\nthe disability system the years-of-service multiplier in-\ncludes not only the employee’s actual years of service but\nalso the number of years it would have taken the employee\nto become eligible for normal retirement (subject to a cap\nequal to the number of actual years served).             See\n4        KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n§16.582(5)(a). In other words employees in the normal\nretirement system are compensated based solely on their\nactual years of service; but employees in the disability\nretirement system get a bonus, which accounts for the\nnumber of years the employee would have worked had he\nor she remained healthy until becoming eligible to receive\nnormal retirement benefits.\n   Whether intended or not, the result of these divergent\nbenefits formulae is a system that, in some cases, compen-\nsates otherwise similarly situated individuals differently\non the basis of age. Consider two covered workers, one 45\nand one 55, both with five years of service with the Com-\nmonwealth and an annual salary of $60,000. If we assume\nboth become disabled in the same accident, the 45-year-old\nwill be entitled to receive $1,250 in monthly benefits; the\n55-year-old will receive $625, just half as much. The\nbenefit disparity results from the Commonwealth’s deci-\nsion, under the disability retirement formula, to credit the\n45-year-old with 5 years of unworked service (thereby\nincreasing the appliable years-service-multipler to 10\nyears), while the 55-year-old’s benefits are based only on\nactual years of service (5 years). In that instance age is\nthe only factor that accounts for the disparate treatment.\n   True, age is not a factor that reduces benefits in every\ncase. If a worker has accumulated 20 years of service with\nthe Commonwealth before he or she becomes disabled, age\nplays no role in the benefits calculation. But there is no\nquestion that, in many cases, a disabled worker over the\nage of 55 who has accumulated fewer than 20 years of\nservice receives a lower monthly stipend than otherwise\nsimilarly situated workers who are under 55. The Court\nconcludes this result is something other than discrimina-\ntion on the basis of age only by ignoring the statute and\nour past opinions.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n                               II\n   It is difficult to find a clear rule of law in the list of\npolicy arguments the Court makes to justify its holding.\nThe difficulty is compounded by the Court’s own analysis.\nThe Court concedes that, in this case, Kentucky’s plan\n“placed an older worker at a disadvantage,” ante, at 9; yet\nit proceeds to hold that the Commonwealth’s disparate\ntreatment of its workers was not “ ‘actually motivated’ by\nage, ” ante, at 10. The Court’s apparent rationale is that,\neven when it is evident that a benefits plan discriminates\non its face on the basis of age, an ADEA plaintiff still must\nprovide additional evidence that the employer acted with\nan “underlying motive,” ante, at 9, to treat older workers\nless favorably than younger workers.\n   The Court finds no support in the text of the statute. In\nthe wake of Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio\nv. Betts, 492 U. S. 158 (1989), where the Court held that\nbona fide employee benefit plans were exempt from the\ncoverage of the ADEA, Congress amended the Act to pro-\nvide that an employee benefit plan that discriminates on\nthe basis of age is unlawful, except when the employer\nestablishes entitlement to one of the affirmative defenses\nCongress has provided.

As a result of the OWBPA, an employer cannot\noperate an employee benefit plan in a manner that “dis-\ncriminate[s] against any individual . . . because of such\nindividual’s age,” §623(a), except when the plan is a “vol-\nuntary early retirement incentive plan” or when “the\nactual amount of payment made or cost incurred on behalf\nof an older worker is no less than that made or incurred on\nbehalf of a younger worker,” §§623(f)(2)(B)(i)–(ii); see\ngenerally B. Lindemann & D. Kadue, Age Discrimination\nin Employment Law 175 (2003). Under any common\nunderstanding of the statute’s terms a disability plan that\npays older workers less than younger workers on the basis\n6        KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nof age “discriminate[s] . . . because of . . . age.” That is how\nthe agency that administers the statute, the EEOC, un-\nderstands it.      See 2 EEOC Compliance Manual §3,\np. 627:0004 (2001) (“[B]enefits will not be equal where a\nplan reduces or eliminates benefits based on a criterion\nthat is explicitly defined (in whole or in part) by age”).\nAnd the employer here has not shown that any of the\naffirmative defenses or exemptions to the Act applies.\nThat should be the end of the matter; the employer is\nliable unless it can make such a showing.\n   The Court’s holding stems, it asserts, from a statement\nin Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604 (1993), that\nan employment practice discriminates only if it is “ ‘actu-\nally motivated’ ” by the protected trait. Ante, at 4 (quoting\nHazen Paper, 507 U. S., at 610; emphasis deleted). If this\nphrase had been used without qualification, the Court’s\ninterpretation of it might have been justified. If one reads\nthe relevant passage in full (with particular emphasis on\nthe second sentence), however, Hazen Paper makes quite\nclear that no additional proof of motive is required in an\nADEA case once the employment policy at issue is deemed\ndiscriminatory on its face. The Court said this:\n    “In a disparate treatment case, liability depends on\n    whether the protected trait (under the ADEA, age) ac-\n    tually motivated the employer’s decision. See, e.g.,\n    United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aik-\n    ens, 460 U. S. 711 (1983); Texas Dept. of Community\n    Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 252–256 (1981);\n    Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U. S. 567, 576–\n    578 (1978). The employer may have relied upon a for-\n    mal, facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse\n    treatment of employees with that trait. See, e.g.,\n    [Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.] Thurston, [469 U. S.\n    111 (1985)]; Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v.\n    Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 704–718 (1978). Or the em-\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n    ployer may have been motivated by the protected trait\n    on an ad hoc, informal basis. See, e.g., Anderson v.\n    Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564 (1985); Teamsters [v.\n    United States, 431 U. S. 324, 334–343 (1977)]. What-\n    ever the employer’s decisionmaking process, a dispa-\n    rate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the em-\n    ployee’s protected trait actually played a role in that\n    process and had a determinative influence on the out-\n    come.” Ibid.\nIn context the paragraph identifies a decision made in\nreliance on a “facially discriminatory policy requiring\nadverse treatment of employees with [a protected] trait” as\na type of employment action that is “actually motivated”\nby that trait. By interpreting Hazen Paper to say that a\nformal, facial, explicit, mandated, age-based differential\ndoes not suffice to establish a disparate-treatment viola-\ntion (subject to statutory defenses and exemptions), it\nmisconstrues the precedent upon which its entire theory of\nthis case is built. The Court was right in Hazen Paper and\nis wrong here.\n   At a minimum the Court should not cite Hazen Paper to\nsupport what it now holds. Its conclusion that no dispa-\nrate-treatment violation has been established here con-\nflicts with the longstanding rule in ADEA cases. The\nrule—confirmed by the quoted text in Hazen Paper—is\nthat once the plaintiff establishes that a policy discrimi-\nnates on its face, no additional proof of a less-than-benign\nmotive for the challenged employment action is required.\nFor if the plan discriminates on its face, it is obvious that\ndecisions made pursuant to the plan are “actually moti-\nvated” by age. The EEOC (or the employee) must prevail\nunless the employer can justify its action under one of the\nenumerated statutory defenses or exemptions.\n   Two cases cited in Hazen Paper as examples of “formal,\nfacially discriminatory polic[ies],” stand for this proposi-\n8        KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntion. See Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S.\n111 (1985); Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Man-\nhart, 435 U. S. 702 (1978).\n   In Thurston, the Court considered whether Trans World\nAirlines’ transfer policy for older pilots violated the ADEA.\nThe policy allowed pilots to continue working for the air-\nline past the mandatory retirement age of 60 if they trans-\nferred to the position of flight engineer. 469 U. S., at 115–\n116. But the 60-year-old pilot had to bid for the position.\nUnder the bid procedures a pilot who became ineligible to\nremain at the controls on account of a disability (or even\noutright incompetence) had priority over a pilot forced out\ndue to age. Id., at 116–117. The Court held the burden-\nshifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n411 U. S. 792 (1973), which is used to determine whether\nthere was a discriminatory motive at play, had no applica-\ntion because the policy was “discriminatory on its face.”\n469 U. S., at 121.\n   Manhart, a Title VII case, involved a municipal employ-\nees’ retirement plan that forced female employees to make\nlarger contributions than their male counterparts. The\nCourt noted that even if there were no evidence that the\npolicy had a discriminatory “effect,” “that evidence does\nnot defeat the claim that the practice, on its face, dis-\ncriminated against every individual woman employed by\nthe Department.” 435 U. S., at 716.\n   Just as the majority misunderstands Hazen Paper’s\nreference to employment practices that are “actually\nmotivated” by age, so too does it overstate what the Hazen\nPaper Court meant when it observed that pension status\nand age are “analytically distinct.” 507 U. S., at 611. The\nCourt now reads this language as creating a virtual safe\nharbor for policies that discriminate on the basis of pen-\nsion status, even when pension status is tied directly to\nage and then linked to another type of benefit program.\nThe Hazen Paper Court did not allow, or support, this\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             9\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nresult. In Hazen Paper pension status and age were “ana-\nlytically distinct” because the employee’s eligibility to\nreceive a pension formally had nothing to do with age;\npension status was tied solely to years of service. The\nCourt recognized that age and pension status were corre-\nlated (because older workers were more likely to be pen-\nsion eligible); but the Court found the plan to be facially\nneutral with regard to age precisely because age and\npension status were not expressly linked under the terms\nof the plan. See id., at 613 (noting that “we do not con-\nsider the special case where an employee is about to vest\nin pension benefits as a result of his age, rather than years\nof service”). In order to prove disparate-treatment liability\nthe Hazen Paper Court held that the plaintiff needed to\nprovide additional evidence that his termination in fact\nwas motivated by age. Id., at 613–614.\n   The saving feature that was controlling in Hazen Paper\nis absent here. This case is the opposite of Hazen Paper.\nHere the age distinction is active and present, not super-\nseded and absent. Age is a determining factor of pension\neligibility for all workers over the age of 55 who have over\n5 (but less than 20) years of service; and pension status, in\nturn, is used to determine eligibility for disability benefits.\nFor these employees, pension status and age are not “ana-\nlytically distinct” in any meaningful sense; they merge\ninto one category. When it treats these employees differ-\nently on the basis of pension eligibility, Kentucky facially\ndiscriminates on the basis of age. Were this not the case,\nthere would be no facial age discrimination if an employer\ndivided his employees into two teams based upon age—\nputting all workers over the age of 65 on “Team A” and all\nother workers on “Team B”—and then paid Team B mem-\nbers twice the salary of their Team A counterparts, not on\nthe basis of age (the employer would declare) but of team\ndesignation. Neither Hazen Paper nor the plain text of the\nADEA can be read to permit this result.\n10       KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   The closest the Court comes to reconciling its holding\nwith the actual text of the statute is its citation to the\nAct’s exemption allowing employers to condition pension\neligibility on age. Ante, at 7. Of course, the fact that it\ninvokes an exemption is a concession by the Court that the\nAct otherwise would condemn the age-based classification\nKentucky’s disability plan makes. But the exemption\nprovides no support for the Court’s holding in any event.\nIts coverage is limited to “employee pension benefit plan[s]\n[that] provid[e] for the attainment of a minimum age as a\ncondition of eligibility for normal or early retirement\nbenefits.” See 29 U. S. C. A. §623(l)(1)(A)(i) (Supp. 2007).\nThere is no farther reaching exemption for subsequent\nemployment decisions based upon pension eligibility. And\nto the extent the Court finds such a loophole to be implicit\nin the text of the statute, a disability benefits program of\nthe sort at issue here is not the only type of employment\npolicy that fits through it. If the ADEA allows an em-\nployer to tie disability benefits to an age-based pension\nstatus designation, that same designation can be used to\ndetermine wages, hours, heath care benefits, reimburse-\nments, job assignments, promotions, office space, trans-\nportation vouchers, parking privileges, and any other\nconceivable benefit or condition of employment.\n                             III\n  The Court recognizes some of the difficulties with its\nposition and seeks to limit its holding, yet it does so in\nways not permitted by statute or our previous employment\ndiscrimination cases.\n  The Court notes that age is not the sole determining\nfactor of pension eligibility but is instead just one factor\nembedded in a set of “complex system-wide rules.” Ante,\nat 7. There is no suggestion in our prior ADEA cases,\nhowever, and certainly none in our related Title VII juris-\nprudence, that discrimination based on a protected trait is\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)          11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\npermissible if the protected trait is one among many\nvariables.\n  This is quite evident when the protected trait is neces-\nsarily a controlling, outcome-determinative factor in calcu-\nlating employee benefits. In Manhart, for instance, sex\nwas not the only factor determining how much an em-\nployee was required to contribute to the pension plan on a\nmonthly basis; the employee’s salary, age, and length of\nservice were also variables in the equation. 435 U. S., at\n705; Brief for Petitioners in Los Angeles Dept. of Water\nand Power v. Manhart, O. T. 1977, No. 76–1810, p. 23.\nAnd even though the employer’s decision to require higher\ncontributions from female employees was based upon an\nactuarially sound premise—that women have longer life\nexpectancies than men—the Court held that the plan\ndiscriminated on its face. 435 U. S., at 711.\n  Similarly, we have said that the ADEA’s substantive\nprohibitions, which were “derived in haec verba from Title\nVII,” Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 584 (1978), require\nthe employer “to ignore an employee’s age (absent a statu-\ntory exemption or defense),” Hazen Paper, 507 U. S., at\n612. This statement perhaps has been qualified by the\nCourt’s subsequent holding in General Dynamics Land\nSystems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581 (2004), that the\nADEA does not forbid employers from discriminating in\nfavor of older workers to the detriment of younger work-\ners. Reasonable minds may have disagreed about the\nmerits of Cline’s holding. See id., at 601 (SCALIA, J., dis-\nsenting); see also id., at 602 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). But\nCline does not dictate the path the Court chooses here.\nFor it is one thing to interpret a statute designed to com-\nbat age discrimination in a way that benefits older work-\ners to the detriment of younger workers; it is quite another\nto do what the Court does in this case, which is to inter-\npret the ADEA to allow a discriminatory employment\npractice that disfavors older workers while favoring\n12       KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nyounger ones. The Court, moreover, achieved the result in\nCline by reading the word “age” to mean “old age”—i.e., by\nreading “discriminat[ion] . . . because of [an] individual’s\nage,” 29 U. S. C. §623(a), to mean discrimination because\nof an individual’s advanced age. See Cline, supra, at 596.\nHere the Court seems to adopt a new definition of the\nterm “discriminate” by holding that there is no discrimina-\ntion on the basis of a protected trait if the trait is one\namong several factors that bear upon how an employee is\ntreated. There is no principled way to draw this distinc-\ntion, and the Court does not attempt to do so. Cf. Man-\nhart, supra, at 710 (“[T]here is no reason to believe that\nCongress intended a special definition of discrimination in\nthe context of employee group insurance coverage”).\n   The Court recites what it sees as “several background\ncircumstances [that] eliminate the possibility that pension\nstatus, though analytically distinct from age, nonetheless\nserves as a ‘proxy for age’ in Kentucky’s Plan.” Ante, at 7.\nAmong these is a “clear non-age-related rationale,” ibid.,\n“to treat a disabled worker as though he had become\ndisabled after, rather than before, he had become eligible\nfor normal retirement benefits,” ante, at 8. There is a\ndifference, however, between a laudable purpose and a\nrule of law.\n   An otherwise discriminatory employment action cannot\nbe rendered lawful because the employer’s motives were\nbenign. In Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.,\n499 U. S. 187 (1991), the employer had a policy barring all\nfemale employees, except those who were infertile, from\nperforming jobs that exposed them to lead. The employer\nsaid its policy was designed not to reinforce negative\ngender stereotypes but to protect female employees’ un-\nborn children against the risk of birth defects. Id., at 191.\nThe argument did not prevail. The plan discriminated on\nits face on the basis of sex, and the employer did not estab-\nlish a bona fide occupational qualification defense. As a\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)          13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nresult, the Court held that the restriction violated Title\nVII. “[T]he absence of a malevolent motive [did] not con-\nvert a facially discriminatory plan into a neutral policy\nwith a discriminatory effect.” Id., at 199.\n  Still, even if our cases allowed the motive qualification\nthe Court puts forth to justify a facial and operative dis-\ntinction based upon age, the plan at issue here does not\nsurvive the Court’s own test. We need look no further\nthan the Commonwealth’s own brief for evidence that its\nmotives are contrary to the ADEA. In its brief the Com-\nmonwealth refers to the 61-year-old complainant in this\ncase, Charles Lickteig, as follows:\n    “An employee in Mr. Lickteig’s position has had an ex-\n    tra 21 years to devote to making money, providing for\n    himself and his family, saving funds for retirement,\n    and accruing years that will increase his retirement\n    benefits. Thus, the 40-year-old employee is likely to\n    need more of a boost.” Brief for Petitioners 23.\nThe hypothetical younger worker seems entitled to a boost\nonly if one accepts that the younger worker had more\nproductive years of work left in him at the time of his\ninjury than Lickteig did. As an actuarial matter, this\nassumption may be sound. It is an impermissible basis for\ndifferential treatment under the ADEA, however. As we\nsaid in Hazen Paper, the idea that “productivity and com-\npetence decline with old age” is the “very essence of age\ndiscrimination.” 507 U. S., at 610. By forbidding age\ndiscrimination against any “individual,” 29 U. S. C.\n§623(a), the ADEA forbids employers from using the blunt\ntool of age to assess an employee’s future productivity. Cf.\nWestern Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell, 472 U. S. 400, 409\n(1985) (noting the Labor Department’s findings that “the\nprocess of psychological and physiological degeneration\ncaused by aging varies with each individual”). Whether\nthis is good public policy in all instances might be debat-\n14       KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS v. EEOC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nable. Until Congress sees fit to change the language of the\nstatute, however, there is no principled basis for upholding\nKentucky’s disability benefits formula.\n                         *     *    *\n   As explained in this dissent, Kentucky’s disability re-\ntirement plan violates the ADEA, an Act intended to\npromote the interests of older Americans. Yet it is no\nsmall irony that it does so, at least in part, because the\nCommonwealth’s normal retirement plan treats older\nworkers in a particularly generous fashion. Kentucky\nallows its employees to retire at the age of 55 if they have\naccumulated only five years of service. But for this provi-\nsion, which links age and years of service in a way that\nbenefits older workers, pension eligibility would be a\nfunction solely of tenure, not age. Accordingly, this case\nwould be more like Hazen Paper, and the EEOC’s case\nwould be much weaker. Similarly, as the Court notes,\nante, at 10, Kentucky could avoid any problems by not\nimputing unworked years of service to any disabled work-\ners, old and young alike. Neither change to the plan\nwould result in more generous treatment for older work-\ners. The only difference would be that, under the first\nexample, older workers would lose the option of early\nretirement, and, under the second, younger workers would\nsee their benefits cut. These are not the only possible\nremedies—the Commonwealth could impute unworked\nyears of service to all employees forced into retirement on\naccount of a disability regardless of age.\n   The Court’s desire to avoid construing the ADEA in a\nway that encourages the Commonwealth to eliminate its\nearly retirement program or to reduce benefits to the\npolicemen and firefighters who are covered under the\ndisability plan is understandable. But, under our prece-\ndents, “ ‘[a] benefit that is part and parcel of the employ-\nment relationship may not be doled out in a discrimina-\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

S., at 121\n(quoting Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U. S. 69, 75\n(1984)). If Kentucky’s facially discriminatory plan is good\npublic policy, the answer is not for this Court to ignore its\nprecedents and the plain text of the statute.\n  For these reasons, in my view, the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals should be affirmed and the case re-\nmanded for a determination whether the State can assert\na cost-justification defense.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145787/", "sha1": "c94e72388ce5e4ae39de0d6c79e1fbfe51d11622", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2007-061", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:07:45"}
