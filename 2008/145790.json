Argued March 19, 2008—Decided June 19, 2008\nOrganizations whose members do business with California sued to en-\n  join enforcement of “Assembly Bill 1889” (AB 1889), which, among\n  other things, prohibits employers that receive state grants or more\n  than $10,000 in state program funds per year from using the funds\n  “to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.” Cal. Govt. Code Ann.\n  §§16645.2(a), 16645.7(a). The District Court granted the plaintiffs\n  partial summary judgment, holding that the National Labor Rela-\n  tions Act (NLRA) pre-empts §§16645.2 and 16645.7 because they\n  regulate employer speech about union organizing under circum-\n  stances in which Congress intended free debate. The Ninth Circuit\n  reversed, concluding that Congress did not intend to preclude States\n  from imposing such restrictions on the use of their own funds.\nHeld: Sections 16645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-empted by the NLRA.\n Pp. 4–16.\n    (a) The NLRA contains no express pre-emption provision, but this\n Court has held pre-emption necessary to implement federal labor pol-\n icy where, inter alia, Congress intended particular conduct to “be un-\n regulated because left ‘to be controlled by the free play of economic\n forces.’ ” Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm’n, 427\n U. S. 132, 140.

The section both responded to prior\n    NLRB rulings that employers’ attempts to persuade employees not to\n    organize amounted to coercion prohibited as an unfair labor practice\n    by the previous version of §8 and manifested a “congressional intent\n    to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management.”\n    Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62. Congress’ express\n    protection of free debate forcefully buttresses the pre-emption analy-\n    sis in this case. California’s policy judgment that partisan employer\n    speech necessarily interferes with an employee’s choice about union\n    representation is the same policy judgment that Congress renounced\n    when it amended the NLRA to preclude regulation of noncoercive\n    speech as an unfair labor practice. To the extent §§16645.2 and\n    16645.7 actually further AB 1889’s express goal, they are unequivo-\n    cally pre-empted. Pp. 5–8.\n       (c) The Ninth Circuit’s reasons for concluding that Machinists did\n    not pre-empt §§16645.2 and 16645.7—(1) that AB 1889’s spending re-\n    strictions apply only to the use of state funds, not to their receipt; (2)\n    that Congress did not leave the zone of activity free from all regula-\n    tion, in that the NLRB still regulates employer speech on the eve of\n    union elections; and (3) that California modeled AB 1889 on federal\n    statutes, e.g., the Workforce Investment Act—are not persuasive.\n    Pp. 8–16.\n463 F. 3d 1076, reversed and remanded.\n\n  STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

EDMUND G.\n      BROWN, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL OF\n              CALIFORNIA, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                [June 19, 2008]\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A California statute known as “Assembly Bill 1889” (AB\n1889) prohibits several classes of employers that receive\nstate funds from using the funds “to assist, promote, or\ndeter union organizing.”       See Cal. Govt. Code Ann.\n§§16645–16649 (West Supp. 2008). The question pre-\nsented to us is whether two of its provisions—§16645.2,\napplicable to grant recipients, and §16645.7, applicable to\nprivate employers receiving more than $10,000 in program\nfunds in any year—are pre-empted by federal law mandat-\ning that certain zones of labor activity be unregulated.\n                             I\n  As set forth in the preamble, the State of California\nenacted AB 1889 for the following purpose:\n    “It is the policy of the state not to interfere with an\n    employee’s choice about whether to join or to be repre-\n    sented by a labor union. For this reason, the state\n    should not subsidize efforts by an employer to assist,\n    promote, or deter union organizing. It is the intent of\n    the Legislature in enacting this act to prohibit an em-\n2       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n    ployer from using state funds and facilities for the\n    purpose of influencing employees to support or oppose\n    unionization and to prohibit an employer from seeking\n    to influence employees to support or oppose unioniza-\n    tion while those employees are performing work on a\n    state contract.” 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, §1.\n   AB 1889 forbids certain employers that receive state\nfunds—whether by reimbursement, grant, contract, use of\nstate property, or pursuant to a state program—from\nusing such funds to “assist, promote, or deter union orga-\nnizing.” See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §§16645.1 to 16645.7.\nThis prohibition encompasses “any attempt by an em-\nployer to influence the decision of its employees” regarding\n“[w]hether to support or oppose a labor organization” and\n“[w]hether to become a member of any labor organization.”\n§16645(a). The statute specifies that the spending restric-\ntion applies to “any expense, including legal and consult-\ning fees and salaries of supervisors and employees, in-\ncurred for . . . an activity to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.” §16646(a).\n   Despite the neutral statement of policy quoted above,\nAB 1889 expressly exempts “activit[ies] performed” or\n“expense[s] incurred” in connection with certain undertak-\nings that promote unionization, including “[a]llowing a\nlabor organization or its representatives access to the\nemployer’s facilities or property,” and “[n]egotiating, enter-\ning into, or carrying out a voluntary recognition agree-\nment with a labor organization.” §§16647(b), (d).\n   To ensure compliance with the grant and program re-\nstrictions at issue in this case, AB 1889 establishes a\nformidable enforcement scheme. Covered employers must\ncertify that no state funds will be used for prohibited\nexpenditures; the employer must also maintain and pro-\nvide upon request “records sufficient to show that no state\nfunds were used for those expenditures.” §§16645.2(c),\n                   Cite as: 554 U.

If an employer commingles state and other\nfunds, the statute presumes that any expenditures to\nassist, promote, or deter union organizing derive in part\nfrom state funds on a pro rata basis. §16646(b). Violators\nare liable to the State for the amount of funds used for\nprohibited purposes plus a civil penalty equal to twice the\namount of those funds. §§16645.2(d), 16645.7(d). Sus-\npected violators may be sued by the state attorney general\nor any private taxpayer, and prevailing plaintiffs are\n“entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.”\n§16645.8(d).\n                               II\n  In April 2002, several organizations whose members do\nbusiness with the State of California (collectively, Cham-\nber of Commerce), brought this action against the Califor-\nnia Department of Health Services and appropriate state\nofficials (collectively, the State) to enjoin enforcement of\nAB 1889. Two labor unions (collectively, AFL–CIO) inter-\nvened to defend the statute’s validity.\n  The District Court granted partial summary judgment\nin favor of the Chamber of Commerce,1 holding that the\nNational Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, as\namended, 29 U. S. C. §151 et seq. pre-empts Cal. Govt.\nCode Ann. §16645.2 (concerning grants) and §16645.7\n(concerning program funds) because those provisions\n“regulat[e] employer speech about union organizing under\nspecified circumstances, even though Congress intended\nfree debate.” Chamber of Commerce v.

BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nreversed. See Chamber of Commerce v. Lockyer, 463 F. 3d\n1076, 1082 (2006). While the en banc majority agreed that\nCalifornia enacted §§16645.2 and 16645.7 in its capacity\nas a regulator, and not as a mere proprietor or market\nparticipant, see id., at 1082–1085, it concluded that Con-\ngress did not intend to preclude States from imposing such\nrestrictions on the use of their own funds, see id., at 1085–\n1096. We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), and\nnow reverse.\n   Although the NLRA itself contains no express pre-\nemption provision, we have held that Congress implicitly\nmandated two types of pre-emption as necessary to im-\nplement federal labor policy. The first, known as Garmon\npre-emption, see San Diego Building Trades Council v.\nGarmon, 359 U. S. 236 (1959), “is intended to preclude\nstate interference with the National Labor Relations\nBoard’s interpretation and active enforcement of the ‘inte-\ngrated scheme of regulation’ established by the NLRA.”\nGolden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 475 U. S. 608,\n613 (1986) (Golden State I). To this end, Garmon pre-\nemption forbids States to “regulate activity that the NLRA\nprotects, prohibits, or arguably protects or prohibits.”\nWisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282,\n286 (1986).      The second, known as Machinists pre-\nemption, forbids both the National Labor Relations Board\n(NLRB) and States to regulate conduct that Congress\nintended “be unregulated because left ‘to be controlled by\nthe free play of economic forces.’ ” Machinists v. Wisconsin\nEmployment Relations Comm’n, 427 U. S. 132, 140 (1976)\n(quoting NLRB v. Nash-Finch Co., 404 U. S. 138, 144\n(1971)). Machinists pre-emption is based on the premise\nthat “ ‘Congress struck a balance of protection, prohibition,\nand laissez-faire in respect to union organization, collec-\ntive bargaining, and labor disputes.’ ” 427 U. S., at 140,\nn. 4 (quoting Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85\nHarv. L. Rev. 1337, 1352 (1972)).\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Today we hold that §§16645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-\nempted under Machinists because they regulate within “a\nzone protected and reserved for market freedom.” Build-\ning & Constr. Trades Council v. Associated Builders &\nContractors of Mass./R. I., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 227 (1993)\n(Boston Harbor). We do not reach the question whether\nthe provisions would also be pre-empted under Garmon.\n                              III\n   As enacted in 1935, the NLRA, which was commonly\nknown as the Wagner Act, did not include any provision\nthat specifically addressed the intersection between em-\nployee organizational rights and employer speech rights.\nSee 49 Stat. 449. Rather, it was left to the NLRB, subject\nto review in federal court, to reconcile these interests in its\nconstruction of §§7 and 8. Section 7, now codified at 29\nU. S. C. §157, provided that workers have the right to\norganize, to bargain collectively, and to engage in con-\ncerted activity for their mutual aid and protection. Sec-\ntion 8(1), now codified at 29 U. S. C. §158(a)(1), made it an\n“unfair labor practice” for employers to “interfere with,\nrestrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights\nguaranteed by section 7.”\n   Among the frequently litigated issues under the Wagner\nAct were charges that an employer’s attempts to persuade\nemployees not to join a union—or to join one favored by\nthe employer rather than a rival—amounted to a form of\ncoercion prohibited by §8. The NLRB took the position\nthat §8 demanded complete employer neutrality during\norganizing campaigns, reasoning that any partisan em-\nployer speech about unions would interfere with the §7\nrights of employees. See 1 J. Higgins, The Developing\nLabor Law 94 (5th ed. 2006). In 1941, this Court curtailed\nthe NLRB’s aggressive interpretation, clarifying that\nnothing in the NLRA prohibits an employer “from express-\ning its view on labor policies or problems” unless the em-\n6      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nployer’s speech “in connection with other circumstances\n[amounts] to coercion within the meaning of the Act.”\nNLRB v. Virginia Elec. & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477\n(1941). We subsequently characterized Virginia Electric\nas recognizing the First Amendment right of employers to\nengage in noncoercive speech about unionization. Thomas\nv. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 537–538 (1945). Notwithstand-\ning these decisions, the NLRB continued to regulate em-\nployer speech too restrictively in the eyes of Congress.\n  Concerned that the Wagner Act had pushed the labor\nrelations balance too far in favor of unions, Congress\npassed the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Taft-\nHartley Act). 61 Stat. 136. The Taft-Hartley Act amended\n§§7 and 8 in several key respects. First, it emphasized\nthat employees “have the right to refrain from any or all”\n§7 activities. 29 U. S. C. §157. Second, it added §8(b),\nwhich prohibits unfair labor practices by unions. 29\nU. S. C. §158(b). Third, it added §8(c), which protects\nspeech by both unions and employers from regulation\nby the NLRB. 29 U. S. C. §158(c). Specifically, §8(c)\nprovides:\n    “The expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or\n    the dissemination thereof, whether in written,\n    printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or\n    be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of\n    the provisions of this subchapter, if such expression\n    contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of\n    benefit.”\n   From one vantage, §8(c) “merely implements the First\nAmendment,” NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575,\n617 (1969), in that it responded to particular constitu-\ntional rulings of the NLRB. See S. Rep. No. 105, 80th\nCong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, pp. 23–24 (1947). But its enact-\nment also manifested a “congressional intent to encourage\nfree debate on issues dividing labor and management.”\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nLinn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62 (1966). It is\nindicative of how important Congress deemed such “free\ndebate” that Congress amended the NLRA rather than\nleaving to the courts the task of correcting the NLRB’s\ndecisions on a case-by-case basis. We have characterized\nthis policy judgment, which suffuses the NLRA as a whole,\nas “favoring uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate in\nlabor disputes,” stressing that “freewheeling use of the\nwritten and spoken word . . . has been expressly fostered\nby Congress and approved by the NLRB.” Letter Carriers\nv. Austin, 418 U. S. 264, 272–273 (1974).\n   Congress’ express protection of free debate forcefully\nbuttresses the pre-emption analysis in this case. Under\nMachinists, congressional intent to shield a zone of activ-\nity from regulation is usually found only “implicit[ly] in\nthe structure of the Act,” Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S.\n107, 117, n. 11 (1994), drawing on the notion that “ ‘[w]hat\nCongress left unregulated is as important as the regula-\ntions that it imposed,’ ” Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los\nAngeles, 493 U. S. 103, 110 (1989) (Golden State II) (quot-\ning New York Telephone Co. v. New York State Dept. of\nLabor, 440 U. S. 519, 552 (1979) (Powell, J., dissenting)).\nIn the case of noncoercive speech, however, the protection\nis both implicit and explicit. Sections 8(a) and 8(b) dem-\nonstrate that when Congress has sought to put limits on\nadvocacy for or against union organization, it has ex-\npressly set forth the mechanisms for doing so. Moreover,\nthe amendment to §7 calls attention to the right of em-\nployees to refuse to join unions, which implies an underly-\ning right to receive information opposing unionization.\nFinally, the addition of §8(c) expressly precludes regula-\ntion of speech about unionization “so long as the communi-\ncations do not contain a ‘threat of reprisal or force or\npromise of benefit.’ ” Gissel Packing, 395 U. S., at 618.\n   The explicit direction from Congress to leave noncoer-\ncive speech unregulated makes this case easier, in at least\n8       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\none respect, than previous NLRA cases because it does not\nrequire us “to decipher the presumed intent of Congress in\nthe face of that body’s steadfast silence.” Sears, Roebuck\n& Co. v. Carpenters, 436 U. S. 180, 188, n. 12 (1978).\nCalifornia’s policy judgment that partisan employer\nspeech necessarily “interfere[s] with an employee’s choice\nabout whether to join or to be represented by a labor\nunion,” 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, §1, is the same policy\njudgment that the NLRB advanced under the Wagner Act,\nand that Congress renounced in the Taft-Hartley Act. To\nthe extent §§16645.2 and 16645.7 actually further the\nexpress goal of AB 1889, the provisions are unequivocally\npre-empted.\n                             IV\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that Machinists did not\npre-empt §§16645.2 and 16645.7 for three reasons: (1) the\nspending restrictions apply only to the use of state funds,\n(2) Congress did not leave the zone of activity free from all\nregulation, and (3) California modeled AB 1889 on federal\nstatutes. We find none of these arguments persuasive.\nUse of State Funds\n   In NLRA pre-emption cases, “ ‘judicial concern has\nnecessarily focused on the nature of the activities which\nthe States have sought to regulate, rather than on the\nmethod of regulation adopted.’ ” Golden State I, 475 U. S.,\nat 614, n. 5 (quoting Garmon, 359 U. S., at 243; brackets\nomitted); see also Livadas, 512 U. S., at 119 (“Pre-emption\nanalysis . . . turns on the actual content of [the State’s]\npolicy and its real effect on federal rights”). California\nplainly could not directly regulate noncoercive speech\nabout unionization by means of an express prohibition. It\nis equally clear that California may not indirectly regulate\nsuch conduct by imposing spending restrictions on the use\nof state funds.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    In Gould, we held that Wisconsin’s policy of refusing to\npurchase goods and services from three-time NLRA viola-\ntors was pre-empted under Garmon because it imposed a\n“supplemental sanction” that conflicted with the NLRA’s\n“ ‘integrated scheme of regulation.’ ” 475 U. S., at 288–289.\nWisconsin protested that its debarment statute was “an\nexercise of the State’s spending power rather than its\nregulatory power,” but we dismissed this as “a distinction\nwithout a difference.” Id., at 287. “[T]he point of the\nstatute [was] to deter labor law violations,” and “for all\npractical purposes” the spending restriction was “tanta-\nmount to regulation.” Id., at 287–289. Wisconsin’s choice\n“to use its spending power rather than its police power\nd[id] not significantly lessen the inherent potential for\nconflict” between the state and federal schemes; hence the\nstatute was pre-empted. Id., at 289.\n    We distinguished Gould in Boston Harbor, holding that\nthe NLRA did not preclude a state agency supervising a\nconstruction project from requiring that contractors abide\nby a labor agreement. We explained that when a State\nacts as a “market participant with no interest in setting\npolicy,” as opposed to a “regulator,” it does not offend the\npre-emption principles of the NLRA. 507 U. S., at 229. In\nfinding that the state agency had acted as a market par-\nticipant, we stressed that the challenged action “was\nspecifically tailored to one particular job,” and aimed “to\nensure an efficient project that would be completed as\nquickly and effectively as possible at the lowest cost.” Id.,\nat 232.\n    It is beyond dispute that California enacted AB 1889 in\nits capacity as a regulator rather than a market partici-\npant. AB 1889 is neither “specifically tailored to one\nparticular job” nor a “legitimate response to state pro-\ncurement constraints or to local economic needs.” Gould,\n475 U. S., at 291. As the statute’s preamble candidly\nacknowledges, the legislative purpose is not the efficient\n10      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nprocurement of goods and services, but the furtherance of\na labor policy. See 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, §1. Although\na State has a legitimate proprietary interest in ensuring\nthat state funds are spent in accordance with the purposes\nfor which they are appropriated, this is not the objective of\nAB 1889. In contrast to a neutral affirmative requirement\nthat funds be spent solely for the purposes of the relevant\ngrant or program, AB 1889 imposes a targeted negative\nrestriction on employer speech about unionization. Fur-\nthermore, the statute does not even apply this constraint\nuniformly. Instead of forbidding the use of state funds for\nall employer advocacy regarding unionization, AB 1889\npermits use of state funds for select employer advocacy\nactivities that promote unions. Specifically, the statute\nexempts expenses incurred in connection with, inter alia,\ngiving unions access to the workplace, and voluntarily\nrecognizing unions without a secret ballot election.\n§§16647(b), (d).\n  The Court of Appeals held that although California did\nnot act as a market participant in enacting AB 1889, the\nNLRA did not pre-empt the statute. It purported to dis-\ntinguish Gould on the theory that AB 1889 does not make\nemployer neutrality a condition for receiving funds, but\ninstead restricts only the use of funds. According to the\nCourt of Appeals, this distinction matters because when a\nState imposes a “use” restriction instead of a “receipt”\nrestriction, “an employer has and retains the freedom to\nspend its own funds however it wishes.” 463 F. 3d, at\n1088.\n  California’s reliance on a “use” restriction rather than a\n“receipt” restriction is, at least in this case, no more conse-\nquential than Wisconsin’s reliance on its spending power\nrather than its police power in Gould. As explained below,\nAB 1889 couples its “use” restriction with compliance costs\nand litigation risks that are calculated to make union-\nrelated advocacy prohibitively expensive for employers\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat receive state funds. By making it exceedingly diffi-\ncult for employers to demonstrate that they have not used\nstate funds and by imposing punitive sanctions for non-\ncompliance, AB 1889 effectively reaches beyond “the use of\nfunds over which California maintains a sovereign inter-\nest.” Brief for State Respondents 19.\n   Turning first to the compliance burdens, AB 1889 re-\nquires recipients to “maintain records sufficient to show\nthat no state funds were used” for prohibited expendi-\ntures, §§16645.2(c), 16645.7(c), and conclusively presumes\nthat any expenditure to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing made from “commingled” funds constitutes a\nviolation of the statute, §16646(b). Maintaining “suffi-\ncient” records and ensuring segregation of funds is no\nsmall feat, given that AB 1889 expansively defines its\nprohibition to encompass “any expense” incurred in “any\nattempt” by an employer to “influence the decision of its\nemployees.” §§16645(a), 16646(a). Prohibited expendi-\ntures include not only discrete expenses such as legal and\nconsulting fees, but also an allocation of overhead, includ-\ning “salaries of supervisors and employees,” for any time\nand resources spent on union-related advocacy. See\n§16646(a). The statute affords no clearly defined safe\nharbor, save for expenses incurred in connection with\nactivities that either favor unions or are required by fed-\neral or state law. See §16647.\n   The statute also imposes deterrent litigation risks.\nSignificantly, AB 1889 authorizes not only the California\nAttorney General but also any private taxpayer—\nincluding, of course, a union in a dispute with an em-\nployer—to bring a civil action against suspected violators\nfor “injunctive relief, damages, civil penalties, and other\nappropriate equitable relief.” §16645.8. Violators are\nliable to the State for three times the amount of state\nfunds deemed spent on union organizing. §§16645.2(d),\n16645.7(d), 16645.8(a). Prevailing plaintiffs, and certain\n12      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nprevailing taxpayer intervenors, are entitled to recover\nattorney’s fees and costs, §16645.8(d), which may well\ndwarf the treble damages award. Consequently, a trivial\nviolation of the statute could give rise to substantial liabil-\nity. Finally, even if an employer were confident that it\nhad satisfied the recordkeeping and segregation require-\nments, it would still bear the costs of defending itself\nagainst unions in court, as well as the risk of a mistaken\nadverse finding by the factfinder.\n    In light of these burdens, California’s reliance on a “use”\nrestriction rather than a “receipt” restriction “does not\nsignificantly lessen the inherent potential for conflict”\nbetween AB 1889 and the NLRA. Gould, 475 U. S., at\n289. AB 1889’s enforcement mechanisms put considerable\npressure on an employer either to forgo his “free speech\nright to communicate his views to his employees,” Gissel\nPacking, 395 U. S., at 617, or else to refuse the receipt of\nany state funds. In so doing, the statute impermissibly\n“predicat[es] benefits on refraining from conduct protected\nby federal labor law,” Livadas, 512 U. S., at 116, and chills\none side of “the robust debate which has been protected\nunder the NLRA,” Letter Carriers, 418 U. S., at 275.\n    Resisting this conclusion, the State and the AFL–CIO\ncontend that AB 1889 imposes less onerous recordkeeping\nrestrictions on governmental subsidies than do federal\nrestrictions that have been found not to violate the First\nAmendment. See Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991);\nRegan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S.\n540 (1983). The question, however, is not whether AB\n1889 violates the First Amendment, but whether it\n“ ‘stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu-\ntion of the full purposes and objectives’ ” of the NLRA.\nLivadas, 512 U. S., at 120 (quoting Brown v. Hotel Em-\nployees, 468 U. S. 491, 501 (1984)). Constitutional stan-\ndards, while sometimes analogous, are not tailored to\naddress the object of labor pre-emption analysis: giving\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

S., at 120 (distinguish-\ning standards applicable to the Equal Protection and Due\nProcess Clauses); Gould, 475 U. S., at 290 (Commerce\nClause); Linn, 383 U. S., at 67 (First Amendment). Al-\nthough a State may “choos[e] to fund a program dedicated\nto advance certain permissible goals,” Rust, 400 U. S., at\n194, it is not “permissible” for a State to use its spending\npower to advance an interest that—even if legitimate “in\nthe absence of the NLRA,” Gould, 475 U. S., at 290—\nfrustrates the comprehensive federal scheme established\nby that Act.\nNLRB Regulation\n   We have characterized Machinists pre-emption as\n“creat[ing] a zone free from all regulations, whether state\nor federal.” Boston Harbor, 507 U. S., at 226. Stressing\nthat the NLRB has regulated employer speech that takes\nplace on the eve of union elections, the Court of Appeals\ndeemed Machinists inapplicable because “employer speech\nin the context of organizing” is not a zone of activity that\nCongress left free from “all regulation.” See 463 F. 3d, at\n1089 (citing Peoria Plastic Co., 117 N. L. R. B. 545, 547–\n548 (1957) (barring employer interviews with employees in\ntheir homes immediately before an election); Peerless\nPlywood Co., 107 N. L. R. B. 427, 429 (1953) (barring\nemployers and unions alike from making election speeches\non company time to massed assemblies of employees\nwithin the 24-hour period before an election)).\n   The NLRB has policed a narrow zone of speech to en-\nsure free and fair elections under the aegis of §9 of the\nNLRA, 29 U. S. C. §159. Whatever the NLRB’s regulatory\nauthority within special settings such as imminent elec-\ntions, however, Congress has clearly denied it the author-\nity to regulate the broader category of noncoercive speech\nencompassed by AB 1889. It is equally obvious that the\n14       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                        v. BROWN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nNLRA deprives California of this authority, since “ ‘[t]he\nStates have no more authority than the Board to upset the\nbalance that Congress has struck between labor and man-\nagement.’ ” Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts,\n471 U. S. 724, 751 (1985).\nFederal Statutes\n  Finally, the Court of Appeals reasoned that Congress\ncould not have intended to pre-empt AB 1889 because\nCongress itself has imposed similar restrictions. See 463\nF. 3d, at 1090–1091. Specifically, three federal statutes\ninclude provisions that forbid the use of particular grant\nand program funds “to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.”2 We are not persuaded that these few iso-\nlated restrictions, plucked from the multitude of federal\nspending programs, were either intended to alter or did in\nfact alter the “ ‘wider contours of federal labor policy.’ ”\nMetropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 753.\n  A federal statute will contract the pre-emptive scope of\nthe NLRA if it demonstrates that “Congress has decided to\ntolerate a substantial measure of diversity” in the particu-\nlar regulatory sphere. New York Telephone, 440 U. S., at\n546 (plurality opinion). In New York Telephone, an em-\nployer challenged a state unemployment system that\nprovided benefits to employees absent from work during\nlengthy strikes. The employer argued that the state sys-\ntem conflicted with the federal labor policy “of allowing the\nfree play of economic forces to operate during the bargain-\n——————\n   2 See 29 U. S. C. §2931(b)(7) (“Each recipient of funds under [the\n\nWorkforce Investment Act] shall provide to the Secretary assurances\nthat none of such funds will be used to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing”); 42 U. S. C. §9839(e) (“Funds appropriated to carry out [the\nHead Start Programs Act] shall not be used to assist, promote, or deter\nunion organizing”); §12634(b)(1) (“Assistance provided under [the\nNational Community Service Act] shall not be used by program par-\nticipants and program staff to . . . assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing”).\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

We upheld the statute on the\nbasis that the legislative histories of the NLRA and Social\nSecurity Act, which were enacted within six weeks of each\nother, confirmed that “Congress intended that the States\nbe free to authorize, or to prohibit, such payments.” Id., at\n544; see also id., at 547 (Brennan, J., concurring in result);\nid., at 549 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment). In-\ndeed, the tension between the Social Security Act and the\nNLRA suggested that the case could “be viewed as pre-\nsenting a potential conflict between two federal statutes\n. . . rather than between federal and state regulatory\nstatutes.” Id., at 539–540, n. 32.\n    The three federal statutes relied on by the Court of\nAppeals neither conflict with the NLRA nor otherwise\nestablish that Congress “decided to tolerate a substantial\nmeasure of diversity” in the regulation of employer speech.\nUnlike the States, Congress has the authority to create\ntailored exceptions to otherwise applicable federal policies,\nand (also unlike the States) it can do so in a manner that\npreserves national uniformity without opening the door to\na 50-state patchwork of inconsistent labor policies. Con-\nsequently, the mere fact that Congress has imposed tar-\ngeted federal restrictions on union-related advocacy in\ncertain limited contexts does not invite the States to over-\nride federal labor policy in other settings.\n    Had Congress enacted a federal version of AB 1889 that\napplied analogous spending restrictions to all federal\ngrants or expenditures, the pre-emption question would be\ncloser. Cf. Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 755 (citing\nfederal minimum labor standards as evidence that Con-\ngress did not intend to pre-empt state minimum labor\nstandards). But none of the cited statutes is Government-\nwide in scope, none contains comparable remedial provi-\nsions, and none contains express pro-union exemptions.\n16      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v.

Stats. ch. 872, §1.\nThe operative sections of the law prohibit several classes\nof employers who receive state funds from using those\nfunds to “assist, promote, or deter union organizing.” Cal.\nGovt. Code Ann. §§16645–16649 (West Supp. 2008). And\nvarious compliance provisions then require maintenance\nof “records sufficient to show that no state funds were\nused” for prohibited expenditures, deter the use of com-\nmingled funds for prohibited expenditures, and impose\nserious penalties upon violators. §§16645.2(c), 16645.7(b)–\n(c).\n   The Court finds that the National Labor Relations Act\n(NLRA) pre-empts these provisions. It does so, for it\nbelieves the provisions “regulate” activity that Congress\nhas intended to “be unregulated because left to be con-\ntrolled by the free play of economic forces.” Machinists v.\nWisconsin Employment Relations Comm’n, 427 U. S. 132,\n140 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted and empha-\nsis added). The Chamber of Commerce adds that the\n2       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nNLRA pre-empts these provisions because they “regulate\nactivity that the NLRA protects, prohibits, or arguably\nprotects or prohibits.” Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v.\nGould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 286 (1986) (summarizing the\npre-emption principle set forth in San Diego Building\nTrades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 (1959); emphasis\nadded). Thus the question before us is whether Califor-\nnia’s spending limitations amount to regulation that the\nNLRA pre-empts. In my view, they do not.\n                              I\n   The operative sections of the California statute provide\nthat employers who wish to “assist, promote or deter union\norganizing,” cannot use state money when they do so. The\nmajority finds these provisions pre-empted because in its\nview the sections regulate employer speech in a manner\nthat weakens, or undercuts, a congressional policy, embod-\nied in NLRA §8(c), “ ‘to encourage free debate on issues\ndividing labor and management.’ ” Ante, at 6–7 (citing\nLinn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62 (1966)).\n   Although I agree the congressional policy favors “free\ndebate,” I do not believe the operative provisions of the\nCalifornia statute amount to impermissible regulation\nthat interferes with that policy as Congress intended it.\nFirst, the only relevant Supreme Court case that found a\nState’s labor-related spending limitations to be pre-\nempted differs radically from the case before us. In that\ncase, Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S.\n282, the Court considered a Wisconsin statute that prohib-\nited the State from doing business with firms that repeat-\nedly violated the NLRA. The Court said that the statute’s\n“manifest purpose and inevitable effect” was “to enforce”\nthe NLRA’s requirements, which “role Congress reserved\nexclusively for the [National Labor Relations Board].” Id.,\nat 291. In a word, the Wisconsin statute sought “to compel\nconformity with the NLRA.” Building & Constr. Trades\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCouncil v. Associated Builders & Contractors of Mass./R.\nI., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 228 (1993) (emphasis added).\n   California’s statute differs from the Wisconsin statute\nbecause it does not seek to compel labor-related activity.\nNor does it seek to forbid labor-related activity. It permits\nall employers who receive state funds to “assist, promote,\nor deter union organizing.” It simply says to those em-\nployers, do not do so on our dime. I concede that a federal\nlaw that forces States to pay for labor-related speech from\npublic funds would encourage more of that speech. But no\none can claim that the NLRA is such a law. And without\nsuch a law, a State’s refusal to pay for labor-related speech\ndoes not impermissibly discourage that activity. To refuse\nto pay for an activity (as here) is not the same as to compel\nothers to engage in that activity (as in Gould).\n   Second, California’s operative language does not weaken\nor undercut Congress’ policy of “encourag[ing] free debate\non issues dividing labor and management.” Linn, supra, at\n62. For one thing, employers remain free to spend their\nown money to “assist, promote, or deter” unionization.\nMore importantly, I cannot conclude that California’s\nstatute would weaken or undercut any such congressional\npolicy because Congress itself has enacted three statutes\nthat, using identical language, do precisely the same\nthing. Congress has forbidden recipients of Head Start\nfunds from using the funds to “assist, promote, or deter\nunion organizing.” 42 U. S. C. §9839(e). It has forbidden\nrecipients of Workforce Investment Act of 1998 funds from\nusing the funds to “assist, promote, or deter union organiz-\ning.” 29 U. S. C. §2931(b)(7). And it has forbidden recipi-\nents of National Community Service Act of 1990 funds\nfrom using the funds to “assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.” 42 U. S. C. §12634(b)(1). Could Congress\nhave thought that the NLRA would prevent the States\nfrom enacting the very same kinds of laws that Congress\nitself has enacted? Far more likely, Congress thought that\n4       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndirecting government funds away from labor-related activ-\nity was consistent, not inconsistent, with, the policy of\n“encourag[ing] free debate” embedded in its labor statutes.\n   Finally, the law normally gives legislatures broad au-\nthority to decide how to spend the People’s money. A\nlegislature, after all, generally has the right not to fund\nactivities that it would prefer not to fund—even where the\nactivities are otherwise protected. See, e.g., Regan v.\nTaxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549\n(1983) (“We have held in several contexts that a legisla-\nture’s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamen-\ntal right does not infringe the right”). This Court has\nmade the same point in the context of labor law. See Lyng\nv. Automobile Workers, 485 U. S. 360, 368 (1988) (holding\nthat the Federal Government’s refusal to provide food\nstamp benefits to striking workers was justified because\n“[s]trikers and their union would be much better off if food\nstamps were available,” but the “strikers’ right of associa-\ntion does not require the Government to furnish funds to\nmaximize the exercise of that right”).\n   As far as I can tell, States that do wish to pay for em-\nployer speech are generally free to do so. They might\nmake clear, for example, through grant-related rules and\nregulations that a grant recipient can use the funds to pay\nsalaries and overhead, which salaries and overhead might\ninclude expenditures related to management’s role in\nlabor organizing contests. If so, why should States that do\nnot wish to pay be deprived of a similar freedom? Why\nshould they be conscripted into paying?\n   I can find nothing in the majority’s arguments that\nconvincingly answers these questions. The majority says\nthat California must be acting as an impermissible regula-\ntor because it is not acting as a “market participant” (a\nrole we all agree would permit it broad leeway to act like\nprivate firms in respect to labor matters). Ante, at 9. But\nthe regulator/market-participant distinction suggests a\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfalse dichotomy. The converse of “market participant” is\nnot necessarily “regulator.” A State may appropriate\nfunds without either participating in or regulating the\nlabor market. And the NLRA pre-empts a State’s actions,\nwhen taken as an “appropriator,” only if those actions\namount to impermissible regulation. I have explained\nwhy I believe that California’s actions do not amount to\nimpermissible regulation here.\n  The majority also complains that the statute “imposes a\ntargeted negative restriction,” one applicable only to labor.\nAnte, at 10. I do not find this a fatal objection, because the\ncongressional statutes just discussed (which I believe are\nconsistent with the NLRA) do exactly the same. In any\nevent, if, say, a State can tell employers not to use state\nfunds to pay for a large category of expenses (say, over-\nhead), why can it not tell employers the same about a\nsmaller category of expenses (say, only those overhead\nexpenses related to taking sides in a labor contest). And\nwhere would the line then be drawn? Would the statute\npass master if California had said, do not use our money\nto pay for interior decorating, catered lunches, or labor\nrelations?\n  The majority further objects to the fact that the statute\ndoes not “apply” the constraint “uniformly,” because it\npermits use of state funds for “select employer advocacy\nactivities that promote unions.” Ante, at 10. That last\nphrase presumably refers to an exception in the California\nstatute that permits employers to spend state funds to\nnegotiate a voluntary recognition of a union. But this\nexception underscores California’s basic purpose—\nmaintaining a position of spending neutrality on contested\nlabor matters. Where labor and management agree on\nunionization, there is no conflict.\n                             II\n  I turn now to the statute’s compliance provisions. They\n6       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrequire grant recipients to maintain “records sufficient to\nshow that no state funds were used” for prohibited expen-\nditures; they deter the use of commingled funds for prohib-\nited expenditures; and they impose serious penalties upon\nviolators. Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §§16645.2(c), 16645.7(b)–\n(c). The majority seems to rest its conclusions in part\nupon its belief that these requirements are too strict, that,\nunder the guise of neutral enforcement, they discourage\nthe use of nonstate money to engage in free debate on\nlabor/management issues. Ante, at 10–11.\n   I agree with the majority that, should the compliance\nprovisions, as a practical matter, unreasonably discourage\nexpenditure of nonstate funds, the NLRA may well pre-\nempt California’s statute. But I cannot say on the basis of\nthe record before us that the statute will have that effect.\n   The language of the statute is clear. The statute re-\nquires recipients of state money to “maintain records\nsufficient to show that no state funds were used” for pro-\nhibited expenditures. §§16645.2, 16645.7(c). And the\nclass of prohibited expenditures is quite broad: It covers\n“any expense” incurred in “any attempt” by an employer to\n“influence the decision of its employees,” including “legal\nand consulting fees and salaries of supervisors and em-\nployees” incurred during research for or the preparation,\nplanning, coordination, or execution of activities to “assist,\npromote, or deter” union organizing. §16646(a) (emphasis\nadded). And where an employer mingles state funds and\nnon-state funds, (say, to pay a particular employee who\nspends part of her time dealing with unionization matters)\nthe employer must determine “on a pro rata basis,” the\nportion of the labor-related expenditure paid for by state\nfunds, and maintain sufficient supporting documentation.\n§16646(b). Any violation of these provisions is then sub-\nject to strict penalties, including treble damages and\nattorney’s fees and costs. §16645.8.\n   What is less clear is the degree to which these provi-\n                  Cite as: 554 U.

In the Dis-\ntrict Court, the Chamber of Commerce moved for sum-\nmary judgment arguing that the statute, by placing re-\nstrictions on state funds, was pre-empted by Machinists\nand Garmon and also arguing that the compliance provi-\nsions are so burdensome that they would chill even private\nexpenditures. California opposed the motion. And Cali-\nfornia submitted expert evidence designed to show that its\n“accounting and recordkeeping requirements . . . are simi-\nlar to requirements imposed in other contexts,” are “sig-\nnificantly less burdensome than the detailed requirements\nfor federal grant recipients,” and allow “flexibility in estab-\nlishing proper accounting procedures and controls.” App.\n282–283.\n   The District Court granted the Chamber of Commerce’s\nmotion for summary judgment in part, finding that the\noperative sections of the statute were pre-empted for the\nreasons I have discussed in Part I, namely, that the opera-\ntive provisions interfered with the NLRA’s policy of en-\ncouraging “free debate.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567042\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567042/chamber-of-commerce-of-us-v-lockyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Argued March 19, 2008—Decided June 19, 2008\nOrganizations whose members do business with California sued to en-\n  join enforcement of “Assembly Bill 1889” (AB 1889), which, among\n  other things, prohibits employers that receive state grants or more\n  than $10,000 in state program funds per year from using the funds\n  “to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.” Cal. Govt. Code Ann.\n  §§16645.2(a), 16645.7(a). The District Court granted the plaintiffs\n  partial summary judgment, holding that the National Labor Rela-\n  tions Act (NLRA) pre-empts §§16645.2 and 16645.7 because they\n  regulate employer speech about union organizing under circum-\n  stances in which Congress intended free debate. The Ninth Circuit\n  reversed, concluding that Congress did not intend to preclude States\n  from imposing such restrictions on the use of their own funds.\nHeld: Sections 16645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-empted by the NLRA.\n Pp. 4–16.\n    (a) The NLRA contains no express pre-emption provision, but this\n Court has held pre-emption necessary to implement federal labor pol-\n icy where, inter alia, Congress intended particular conduct to “be un-\n regulated because left ‘to be controlled by the free play of economic\n forces.’ ” Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm’n, 427\n U. S. 132, 140.

The section both responded to prior\n    NLRB rulings that employers’ attempts to persuade employees not to\n    organize amounted to coercion prohibited as an unfair labor practice\n    by the previous version of §8 and manifested a “congressional intent\n    to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management.”\n    Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62. Congress’ express\n    protection of free debate forcefully buttresses the pre-emption analy-\n    sis in this case. California’s policy judgment that partisan employer\n    speech necessarily interferes with an employee’s choice about union\n    representation is the same policy judgment that Congress renounced\n    when it amended the NLRA to preclude regulation of noncoercive\n    speech as an unfair labor practice.

Govt. Code Ann.\n§§16645–16649 (West Supp. 2008). The question pre-\nsented to us is whether two of its provisions—§16645.2,\napplicable to grant recipients, and §16645.7, applicable to\nprivate employers receiving more than $10,000 in program\nfunds in any year—are pre-empted by federal law mandat-\ning that certain zones of labor activity be unregulated.\n                             I\n  As set forth in the preamble, the State of California\nenacted AB 1889 for the following purpose:\n    “It is the policy of the state not to interfere with an\n    employee’s choice about whether to join or to be repre-\n    sented by a labor union. For this reason, the state\n    should not subsidize efforts by an employer to assist,\n    promote, or deter union organizing. It is the intent of\n    the Legislature in enacting this act to prohibit an em-\n2       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n    ployer from using state funds and facilities for the\n    purpose of influencing employees to support or oppose\n    unionization and to prohibit an employer from seeking\n    to influence employees to support or oppose unioniza-\n    tion while those employees are performing work on a\n    state contract.” 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, §1.\n   AB 1889 forbids certain employers that receive state\nfunds—whether by reimbursement, grant, contract, use of\nstate property, or pursuant to a state program—from\nusing such funds to “assist, promote, or deter union orga-\nnizing.” See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §§16645.1 to 16645.7.\nThis prohibition encompasses “any attempt by an em-\nployer to influence the decision of its employees” regarding\n“[w]hether to support or oppose a labor organization” and\n“[w]hether to become a member of any labor organization.”\n§16645(a). The statute specifies that the spending restric-\ntion applies to “any expense, including legal and consult-\ning fees and salaries of supervisors and employees, in-\ncurred for . . . an activity to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.” §16646(a).\n   Despite the neutral statement of policy quoted above,\nAB 1889 expressly exempts “activit[ies] performed” or\n“expense[s] incurred” in connection with certain undertak-\nings that promote unionization, including “[a]llowing a\nlabor organization or its representatives access to the\nemployer’s facilities or property,” and “[n]egotiating, enter-\ning into, or carrying out a voluntary recognition agree-\nment with a labor organization.” §§16647(b), (d).\n   To ensure compliance with the grant and program re-\nstrictions at issue in this case, AB 1889 establishes a\nformidable enforcement scheme. Covered employers must\ncertify that no state funds will be used for prohibited\nexpenditures; the employer must also maintain and pro-\nvide upon request “records sufficient to show that no state\nfunds were used for those expenditures.” §§16645.2(c),\n                   Cite as: 554 U.

If an employer commingles state and other\nfunds, the statute presumes that any expenditures to\nassist, promote, or deter union organizing derive in part\nfrom state funds on a pro rata basis. §16646(b). Violators\nare liable to the State for the amount of funds used for\nprohibited purposes plus a civil penalty equal to twice the\namount of those funds. §§16645.2(d), 16645.7(d). Sus-\npected violators may be sued by the state attorney general\nor any private taxpayer, and prevailing plaintiffs are\n“entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.”\n§16645.8(d).\n                               II\n  In April 2002, several organizations whose members do\nbusiness with the State of California (collectively, Cham-\nber of Commerce), brought this action against the Califor-\nnia Department of Health Services and appropriate state\nofficials (collectively, the State) to enjoin enforcement of\nAB 1889. Two labor unions (collectively, AFL–CIO) inter-\nvened to defend the statute’s validity.\n  The District Court granted partial summary judgment\nin favor of the Chamber of Commerce,1 holding that the\nNational Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, as\namended, 29 U. S. C. §151 et seq. pre-empts Cal. Govt.\nCode Ann. §16645.2 (concerning grants) and §16645.7\n(concerning program funds) because those provisions\n“regulat[e] employer speech about union organizing under\nspecified circumstances, even though Congress intended\nfree debate.” Chamber of Commerce v. Lockyer, 225\nF. Supp. 2d 1199, 1205 (CD Cal. 2002). The Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, after twice affirming the\nDistrict Court’s judgment, granted rehearing en banc and\n——————\n  1 The District Court held that the Chamber of Commerce lacked\nstanding to challenge several provisions of AB 1889 concerning state\ncontractors and public employers. See Chamber of Commerce v.\nLockyer, 225 F. Supp. 2d 1199, 1202–1203 (CD Cal. 2002).\n4       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nreversed. See Chamber of Commerce v. Lockyer, 463 F. 3d\n1076, 1082 (2006). While the en banc majority agreed that\nCalifornia enacted §§16645.2 and 16645.7 in its capacity\nas a regulator, and not as a mere proprietor or market\nparticipant, see id., at 1082–1085, it concluded that Con-\ngress did not intend to preclude States from imposing such\nrestrictions on the use of their own funds, see id., at 1085–\n1096. We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), and\nnow reverse.\n   Although the NLRA itself contains no express pre-\nemption provision, we have held that Congress implicitly\nmandated two types of pre-emption as necessary to im-\nplement federal labor policy. The first, known as Garmon\npre-emption, see San Diego Building Trades Council v.\nGarmon, 359 U. S. 236 (1959), “is intended to preclude\nstate interference with the National Labor Relations\nBoard’s interpretation and active enforcement of the ‘inte-\ngrated scheme of regulation’ established by the NLRA.”\nGolden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 475 U. S. 608,\n613 (1986) (Golden State I). To this end, Garmon pre-\nemption forbids States to “regulate activity that the NLRA\nprotects, prohibits, or arguably protects or prohibits.”\nWisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282,\n286 (1986).      The second, known as Machinists pre-\nemption, forbids both the National Labor Relations Board\n(NLRB) and States to regulate conduct that Congress\nintended “be unregulated because left ‘to be controlled by\nthe free play of economic forces.’ ” Machinists v. Wisconsin\nEmployment Relations Comm’n, 427 U. S. 132, 140 (1976)\n(quoting NLRB v. Nash-Finch Co., 404 U. S. 138, 144\n(1971)). Machinists pre-emption is based on the premise\nthat “ ‘Congress struck a balance of protection, prohibition,\nand laissez-faire in respect to union organization, collec-\ntive bargaining, and labor disputes.’ ” 427 U. S., at 140,\nn. 4 (quoting Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85\nHarv. L. Rev. 1337, 1352 (1972)).\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Today we hold that §§16645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-\nempted under Machinists because they regulate within “a\nzone protected and reserved for market freedom.” Build-\ning & Constr. Trades Council v. Associated Builders &\nContractors of Mass./R. I., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 227 (1993)\n(Boston Harbor). We do not reach the question whether\nthe provisions would also be pre-empted under Garmon.\n                              III\n   As enacted in 1935, the NLRA, which was commonly\nknown as the Wagner Act, did not include any provision\nthat specifically addressed the intersection between em-\nployee organizational rights and employer speech rights.\nSee 49 Stat. 449. Rather, it was left to the NLRB, subject\nto review in federal court, to reconcile these interests in its\nconstruction of §§7 and 8. Section 7, now codified at 29\nU. S. C. §157, provided that workers have the right to\norganize, to bargain collectively, and to engage in con-\ncerted activity for their mutual aid and protection. Sec-\ntion 8(1), now codified at 29 U. S. C. §158(a)(1), made it an\n“unfair labor practice” for employers to “interfere with,\nrestrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights\nguaranteed by section 7.”\n   Among the frequently litigated issues under the Wagner\nAct were charges that an employer’s attempts to persuade\nemployees not to join a union—or to join one favored by\nthe employer rather than a rival—amounted to a form of\ncoercion prohibited by §8. The NLRB took the position\nthat §8 demanded complete employer neutrality during\norganizing campaigns, reasoning that any partisan em-\nployer speech about unions would interfere with the §7\nrights of employees. See 1 J. Higgins, The Developing\nLabor Law 94 (5th ed. 2006). In 1941, this Court curtailed\nthe NLRB’s aggressive interpretation, clarifying that\nnothing in the NLRA prohibits an employer “from express-\ning its view on labor policies or problems” unless the em-\n6      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nployer’s speech “in connection with other circumstances\n[amounts] to coercion within the meaning of the Act.”\nNLRB v. Virginia Elec. & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477\n(1941). We subsequently characterized Virginia Electric\nas recognizing the First Amendment right of employers to\nengage in noncoercive speech about unionization. Thomas\nv. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 537–538 (1945). Notwithstand-\ning these decisions, the NLRB continued to regulate em-\nployer speech too restrictively in the eyes of Congress.\n  Concerned that the Wagner Act had pushed the labor\nrelations balance too far in favor of unions, Congress\npassed the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Taft-\nHartley Act). 61 Stat. 136. The Taft-Hartley Act amended\n§§7 and 8 in several key respects. First, it emphasized\nthat employees “have the right to refrain from any or all”\n§7 activities. 29 U. S. C. §157. Second, it added §8(b),\nwhich prohibits unfair labor practices by unions. 29\nU. S. C. §158(b). Third, it added §8(c), which protects\nspeech by both unions and employers from regulation\nby the NLRB. 29 U. S. C. §158(c). Specifically, §8(c)\nprovides:\n    “The expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or\n    the dissemination thereof, whether in written,\n    printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or\n    be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of\n    the provisions of this subchapter, if such expression\n    contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of\n    benefit.”\n   From one vantage, §8(c) “merely implements the First\nAmendment,” NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575,\n617 (1969), in that it responded to particular constitu-\ntional rulings of the NLRB. See S. Rep. No. 105, 80th\nCong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, pp. 23–24 (1947). But its enact-\nment also manifested a “congressional intent to encourage\nfree debate on issues dividing labor and management.”\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nLinn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62 (1966). It is\nindicative of how important Congress deemed such “free\ndebate” that Congress amended the NLRA rather than\nleaving to the courts the task of correcting the NLRB’s\ndecisions on a case-by-case basis. We have characterized\nthis policy judgment, which suffuses the NLRA as a whole,\nas “favoring uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate in\nlabor disputes,” stressing that “freewheeling use of the\nwritten and spoken word . . . has been expressly fostered\nby Congress and approved by the NLRB.” Letter Carriers\nv. Austin, 418 U. S. 264, 272–273 (1974).\n   Congress’ express protection of free debate forcefully\nbuttresses the pre-emption analysis in this case. Under\nMachinists, congressional intent to shield a zone of activ-\nity from regulation is usually found only “implicit[ly] in\nthe structure of the Act,” Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S.\n107, 117, n. 11 (1994), drawing on the notion that “ ‘[w]hat\nCongress left unregulated is as important as the regula-\ntions that it imposed,’ ” Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los\nAngeles, 493 U. S. 103, 110 (1989) (Golden State II) (quot-\ning New York Telephone Co. v. New York State Dept. of\nLabor, 440 U. S. 519, 552 (1979) (Powell, J., dissenting)).\nIn the case of noncoercive speech, however, the protection\nis both implicit and explicit. Sections 8(a) and 8(b) dem-\nonstrate that when Congress has sought to put limits on\nadvocacy for or against union organization, it has ex-\npressly set forth the mechanisms for doing so. Moreover,\nthe amendment to §7 calls attention to the right of em-\nployees to refuse to join unions, which implies an underly-\ning right to receive information opposing unionization.\nFinally, the addition of §8(c) expressly precludes regula-\ntion of speech about unionization “so long as the communi-\ncations do not contain a ‘threat of reprisal or force or\npromise of benefit.’ ” Gissel Packing, 395 U. S., at 618.\n   The explicit direction from Congress to leave noncoer-\ncive speech unregulated makes this case easier, in at least\n8       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\none respect, than previous NLRA cases because it does not\nrequire us “to decipher the presumed intent of Congress in\nthe face of that body’s steadfast silence.” Sears, Roebuck\n& Co. v. Carpenters, 436 U. S. 180, 188, n. 12 (1978).\nCalifornia’s policy judgment that partisan employer\nspeech necessarily “interfere[s] with an employee’s choice\nabout whether to join or to be represented by a labor\nunion,” 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, §1, is the same policy\njudgment that the NLRB advanced under the Wagner Act,\nand that Congress renounced in the Taft-Hartley Act. To\nthe extent §§16645.2 and 16645.7 actually further the\nexpress goal of AB 1889, the provisions are unequivocally\npre-empted.\n                             IV\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that Machinists did not\npre-empt §§16645.2 and 16645.7 for three reasons: (1) the\nspending restrictions apply only to the use of state funds,\n(2) Congress did not leave the zone of activity free from all\nregulation, and (3) California modeled AB 1889 on federal\nstatutes. We find none of these arguments persuasive.\nUse of State Funds\n   In NLRA pre-emption cases, “ ‘judicial concern has\nnecessarily focused on the nature of the activities which\nthe States have sought to regulate, rather than on the\nmethod of regulation adopted.’ ” Golden State I, 475 U. S.,\nat 614, n. 5 (quoting Garmon, 359 U. S., at 243; brackets\nomitted); see also Livadas, 512 U. S., at 119 (“Pre-emption\nanalysis . . . turns on the actual content of [the State’s]\npolicy and its real effect on federal rights”). California\nplainly could not directly regulate noncoercive speech\nabout unionization by means of an express prohibition. It\nis equally clear that California may not indirectly regulate\nsuch conduct by imposing spending restrictions on the use\nof state funds.\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    In Gould, we held that Wisconsin’s policy of refusing to\npurchase goods and services from three-time NLRA viola-\ntors was pre-empted under Garmon because it imposed a\n“supplemental sanction” that conflicted with the NLRA’s\n“ ‘integrated scheme of regulation.’ ” 475 U. S., at 288–289.\nWisconsin protested that its debarment statute was “an\nexercise of the State’s spending power rather than its\nregulatory power,” but we dismissed this as “a distinction\nwithout a difference.” Id., at 287. “[T]he point of the\nstatute [was] to deter labor law violations,” and “for all\npractical purposes” the spending restriction was “tanta-\nmount to regulation.” Id., at 287–289. Wisconsin’s choice\n“to use its spending power rather than its police power\nd[id] not significantly lessen the inherent potential for\nconflict” between the state and federal schemes; hence the\nstatute was pre-empted. Id., at 289.\n    We distinguished Gould in Boston Harbor, holding that\nthe NLRA did not preclude a state agency supervising a\nconstruction project from requiring that contractors abide\nby a labor agreement. We explained that when a State\nacts as a “market participant with no interest in setting\npolicy,” as opposed to a “regulator,” it does not offend the\npre-emption principles of the NLRA. 507 U. S., at 229. In\nfinding that the state agency had acted as a market par-\nticipant, we stressed that the challenged action “was\nspecifically tailored to one particular job,” and aimed “to\nensure an efficient project that would be completed as\nquickly and effectively as possible at the lowest cost.” Id.,\nat 232.\n    It is beyond dispute that California enacted AB 1889 in\nits capacity as a regulator rather than a market partici-\npant. AB 1889 is neither “specifically tailored to one\nparticular job” nor a “legitimate response to state pro-\ncurement constraints or to local economic needs.” Gould,\n475 U. S., at 291.

BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nprocurement of goods and services, but the furtherance of\na labor policy. See 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, §1. Although\na State has a legitimate proprietary interest in ensuring\nthat state funds are spent in accordance with the purposes\nfor which they are appropriated, this is not the objective of\nAB 1889. In contrast to a neutral affirmative requirement\nthat funds be spent solely for the purposes of the relevant\ngrant or program, AB 1889 imposes a targeted negative\nrestriction on employer speech about unionization. Fur-\nthermore, the statute does not even apply this constraint\nuniformly. Instead of forbidding the use of state funds for\nall employer advocacy regarding unionization, AB 1889\npermits use of state funds for select employer advocacy\nactivities that promote unions. Specifically, the statute\nexempts expenses incurred in connection with, inter alia,\ngiving unions access to the workplace, and voluntarily\nrecognizing unions without a secret ballot election.\n§§16647(b), (d).\n  The Court of Appeals held that although California did\nnot act as a market participant in enacting AB 1889, the\nNLRA did not pre-empt the statute. It purported to dis-\ntinguish Gould on the theory that AB 1889 does not make\nemployer neutrality a condition for receiving funds, but\ninstead restricts only the use of funds. According to the\nCourt of Appeals, this distinction matters because when a\nState imposes a “use” restriction instead of a “receipt”\nrestriction, “an employer has and retains the freedom to\nspend its own funds however it wishes.” 463 F. 3d, at\n1088.\n  California’s reliance on a “use” restriction rather than a\n“receipt” restriction is, at least in this case, no more conse-\nquential than Wisconsin’s reliance on its spending power\nrather than its police power in Gould. As explained below,\nAB 1889 couples its “use” restriction with compliance costs\nand litigation risks that are calculated to make union-\nrelated advocacy prohibitively expensive for employers\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat receive state funds. By making it exceedingly diffi-\ncult for employers to demonstrate that they have not used\nstate funds and by imposing punitive sanctions for non-\ncompliance, AB 1889 effectively reaches beyond “the use of\nfunds over which California maintains a sovereign inter-\nest.” Brief for State Respondents 19.\n   Turning first to the compliance burdens, AB 1889 re-\nquires recipients to “maintain records sufficient to show\nthat no state funds were used” for prohibited expendi-\ntures, §§16645.2(c), 16645.7(c), and conclusively presumes\nthat any expenditure to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing made from “commingled” funds constitutes a\nviolation of the statute, §16646(b). Maintaining “suffi-\ncient” records and ensuring segregation of funds is no\nsmall feat, given that AB 1889 expansively defines its\nprohibition to encompass “any expense” incurred in “any\nattempt” by an employer to “influence the decision of its\nemployees.” §§16645(a), 16646(a). Prohibited expendi-\ntures include not only discrete expenses such as legal and\nconsulting fees, but also an allocation of overhead, includ-\ning “salaries of supervisors and employees,” for any time\nand resources spent on union-related advocacy. See\n§16646(a). The statute affords no clearly defined safe\nharbor, save for expenses incurred in connection with\nactivities that either favor unions or are required by fed-\neral or state law. See §16647.\n   The statute also imposes deterrent litigation risks.\nSignificantly, AB 1889 authorizes not only the California\nAttorney General but also any private taxpayer—\nincluding, of course, a union in a dispute with an em-\nployer—to bring a civil action against suspected violators\nfor “injunctive relief, damages, civil penalties, and other\nappropriate equitable relief.” §16645.8. Violators are\nliable to the State for three times the amount of state\nfunds deemed spent on union organizing. §§16645.2(d),\n16645.7(d), 16645.8(a). Prevailing plaintiffs, and certain\n12      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                       v. BROWN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nprevailing taxpayer intervenors, are entitled to recover\nattorney’s fees and costs, §16645.8(d), which may well\ndwarf the treble damages award. Consequently, a trivial\nviolation of the statute could give rise to substantial liabil-\nity. Finally, even if an employer were confident that it\nhad satisfied the recordkeeping and segregation require-\nments, it would still bear the costs of defending itself\nagainst unions in court, as well as the risk of a mistaken\nadverse finding by the factfinder.\n    In light of these burdens, California’s reliance on a “use”\nrestriction rather than a “receipt” restriction “does not\nsignificantly lessen the inherent potential for conflict”\nbetween AB 1889 and the NLRA. Gould, 475 U. S., at\n289. AB 1889’s enforcement mechanisms put considerable\npressure on an employer either to forgo his “free speech\nright to communicate his views to his employees,” Gissel\nPacking, 395 U. S., at 617, or else to refuse the receipt of\nany state funds. In so doing, the statute impermissibly\n“predicat[es] benefits on refraining from conduct protected\nby federal labor law,” Livadas, 512 U. S., at 116, and chills\none side of “the robust debate which has been protected\nunder the NLRA,” Letter Carriers, 418 U. S., at 275.\n    Resisting this conclusion, the State and the AFL–CIO\ncontend that AB 1889 imposes less onerous recordkeeping\nrestrictions on governmental subsidies than do federal\nrestrictions that have been found not to violate the First\nAmendment. See Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991);\nRegan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S.\n540 (1983). The question, however, is not whether AB\n1889 violates the First Amendment, but whether it\n“ ‘stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu-\ntion of the full purposes and objectives’ ” of the NLRA.\nLivadas, 512 U. S., at 120 (quoting Brown v. Hotel Em-\nployees, 468 U. S. 491, 501 (1984)).

S., at 120 (distinguish-\ning standards applicable to the Equal Protection and Due\nProcess Clauses); Gould, 475 U. S., at 290 (Commerce\nClause); Linn, 383 U. S., at 67 (First Amendment). Al-\nthough a State may “choos[e] to fund a program dedicated\nto advance certain permissible goals,” Rust, 400 U. S., at\n194, it is not “permissible” for a State to use its spending\npower to advance an interest that—even if legitimate “in\nthe absence of the NLRA,” Gould, 475 U. S., at 290—\nfrustrates the comprehensive federal scheme established\nby that Act.\nNLRB Regulation\n   We have characterized Machinists pre-emption as\n“creat[ing] a zone free from all regulations, whether state\nor federal.” Boston Harbor, 507 U. S., at 226. Stressing\nthat the NLRB has regulated employer speech that takes\nplace on the eve of union elections, the Court of Appeals\ndeemed Machinists inapplicable because “employer speech\nin the context of organizing” is not a zone of activity that\nCongress left free from “all regulation.” See 463 F. 3d, at\n1089 (citing Peoria Plastic Co., 117 N. L. R. B. 545, 547–\n548 (1957) (barring employer interviews with employees in\ntheir homes immediately before an election); Peerless\nPlywood Co., 107 N. L. R. B. 427, 429 (1953) (barring\nemployers and unions alike from making election speeches\non company time to massed assemblies of employees\nwithin the 24-hour period before an election)).\n   The NLRB has policed a narrow zone of speech to en-\nsure free and fair elections under the aegis of §9 of the\nNLRA, 29 U. S. C. §159. Whatever the NLRB’s regulatory\nauthority within special settings such as imminent elec-\ntions, however, Congress has clearly denied it the author-\nity to regulate the broader category of noncoercive speech\nencompassed by AB 1889. It is equally obvious that the\n14       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                        v. BROWN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nNLRA deprives California of this authority, since “ ‘[t]he\nStates have no more authority than the Board to upset the\nbalance that Congress has struck between labor and man-\nagement.’ ” Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts,\n471 U. S. 724, 751 (1985).\nFederal Statutes\n  Finally, the Court of Appeals reasoned that Congress\ncould not have intended to pre-empt AB 1889 because\nCongress itself has imposed similar restrictions. See 463\nF. 3d, at 1090–1091. Specifically, three federal statutes\ninclude provisions that forbid the use of particular grant\nand program funds “to assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.”2 We are not persuaded that these few iso-\nlated restrictions, plucked from the multitude of federal\nspending programs, were either intended to alter or did in\nfact alter the “ ‘wider contours of federal labor policy.’ ”\nMetropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 753.\n  A federal statute will contract the pre-emptive scope of\nthe NLRA if it demonstrates that “Congress has decided to\ntolerate a substantial measure of diversity” in the particu-\nlar regulatory sphere. New York Telephone, 440 U. S., at\n546 (plurality opinion). In New York Telephone, an em-\nployer challenged a state unemployment system that\nprovided benefits to employees absent from work during\nlengthy strikes. The employer argued that the state sys-\ntem conflicted with the federal labor policy “of allowing the\nfree play of economic forces to operate during the bargain-\n——————\n   2 See 29 U. S.

We upheld the statute on the\nbasis that the legislative histories of the NLRA and Social\nSecurity Act, which were enacted within six weeks of each\nother, confirmed that “Congress intended that the States\nbe free to authorize, or to prohibit, such payments.” Id., at\n544; see also id., at 547 (Brennan, J., concurring in result);\nid., at 549 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment). In-\ndeed, the tension between the Social Security Act and the\nNLRA suggested that the case could “be viewed as pre-\nsenting a potential conflict between two federal statutes\n. . . rather than between federal and state regulatory\nstatutes.” Id., at 539–540, n. 32.\n    The three federal statutes relied on by the Court of\nAppeals neither conflict with the NLRA nor otherwise\nestablish that Congress “decided to tolerate a substantial\nmeasure of diversity” in the regulation of employer speech.\nUnlike the States, Congress has the authority to create\ntailored exceptions to otherwise applicable federal policies,\nand (also unlike the States) it can do so in a manner that\npreserves national uniformity without opening the door to\na 50-state patchwork of inconsistent labor policies. Con-\nsequently, the mere fact that Congress has imposed tar-\ngeted federal restrictions on union-related advocacy in\ncertain limited contexts does not invite the States to over-\nride federal labor policy in other settings.\n    Had Congress enacted a federal version of AB 1889 that\napplied analogous spending restrictions to all federal\ngrants or expenditures, the pre-emption question would be\ncloser. Cf. Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 755 (citing\nfederal minimum labor standards as evidence that Con-\ngress did not intend to pre-empt state minimum labor\nstandards).

Stats. ch. 872, §1.\nThe operative sections of the law prohibit several classes\nof employers who receive state funds from using those\nfunds to “assist, promote, or deter union organizing.” Cal.\nGovt. Code Ann. §§16645–16649 (West Supp. 2008). And\nvarious compliance provisions then require maintenance\nof “records sufficient to show that no state funds were\nused” for prohibited expenditures, deter the use of com-\nmingled funds for prohibited expenditures, and impose\nserious penalties upon violators. §§16645.2(c), 16645.7(b)–\n(c).\n   The Court finds that the National Labor Relations Act\n(NLRA) pre-empts these provisions. It does so, for it\nbelieves the provisions “regulate” activity that Congress\nhas intended to “be unregulated because left to be con-\ntrolled by the free play of economic forces.” Machinists v.\nWisconsin Employment Relations Comm’n, 427 U. S. 132,\n140 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted and empha-\nsis added). The Chamber of Commerce adds that the\n2       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nNLRA pre-empts these provisions because they “regulate\nactivity that the NLRA protects, prohibits, or arguably\nprotects or prohibits.” Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v.\nGould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 286 (1986) (summarizing the\npre-emption principle set forth in San Diego Building\nTrades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 (1959); emphasis\nadded). Thus the question before us is whether Califor-\nnia’s spending limitations amount to regulation that the\nNLRA pre-empts. In my view, they do not.\n                              I\n   The operative sections of the California statute provide\nthat employers who wish to “assist, promote or deter union\norganizing,” cannot use state money when they do so. The\nmajority finds these provisions pre-empted because in its\nview the sections regulate employer speech in a manner\nthat weakens, or undercuts, a congressional policy, embod-\nied in NLRA §8(c), “ ‘to encourage free debate on issues\ndividing labor and management.’ ” Ante, at 6–7 (citing\nLinn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62 (1966)).\n   Although I agree the congressional policy favors “free\ndebate,” I do not believe the operative provisions of the\nCalifornia statute amount to impermissible regulation\nthat interferes with that policy as Congress intended it.\nFirst, the only relevant Supreme Court case that found a\nState’s labor-related spending limitations to be pre-\nempted differs radically from the case before us. In that\ncase, Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S.\n282, the Court considered a Wisconsin statute that prohib-\nited the State from doing business with firms that repeat-\nedly violated the NLRA. The Court said that the statute’s\n“manifest purpose and inevitable effect” was “to enforce”\nthe NLRA’s requirements, which “role Congress reserved\nexclusively for the [National Labor Relations Board].” Id.,\nat 291. In a word, the Wisconsin statute sought “to compel\nconformity with the NLRA.” Building & Constr. Trades\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCouncil v. Associated Builders & Contractors of Mass./R.\nI., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 228 (1993) (emphasis added).\n   California’s statute differs from the Wisconsin statute\nbecause it does not seek to compel labor-related activity.\nNor does it seek to forbid labor-related activity. It permits\nall employers who receive state funds to “assist, promote,\nor deter union organizing.” It simply says to those em-\nployers, do not do so on our dime. I concede that a federal\nlaw that forces States to pay for labor-related speech from\npublic funds would encourage more of that speech. But no\none can claim that the NLRA is such a law. And without\nsuch a law, a State’s refusal to pay for labor-related speech\ndoes not impermissibly discourage that activity. To refuse\nto pay for an activity (as here) is not the same as to compel\nothers to engage in that activity (as in Gould).\n   Second, California’s operative language does not weaken\nor undercut Congress’ policy of “encourag[ing] free debate\non issues dividing labor and management.” Linn, supra, at\n62. For one thing, employers remain free to spend their\nown money to “assist, promote, or deter” unionization.\nMore importantly, I cannot conclude that California’s\nstatute would weaken or undercut any such congressional\npolicy because Congress itself has enacted three statutes\nthat, using identical language, do precisely the same\nthing. Congress has forbidden recipients of Head Start\nfunds from using the funds to “assist, promote, or deter\nunion organizing.” 42 U. S. C. §9839(e). It has forbidden\nrecipients of Workforce Investment Act of 1998 funds from\nusing the funds to “assist, promote, or deter union organiz-\ning.” 29 U. S. C. §2931(b)(7). And it has forbidden recipi-\nents of National Community Service Act of 1990 funds\nfrom using the funds to “assist, promote, or deter union\norganizing.” 42 U. S. C. §12634(b)(1). Could Congress\nhave thought that the NLRA would prevent the States\nfrom enacting the very same kinds of laws that Congress\nitself has enacted? Far more likely, Congress thought that\n4       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndirecting government funds away from labor-related activ-\nity was consistent, not inconsistent, with, the policy of\n“encourag[ing] free debate” embedded in its labor statutes.\n   Finally, the law normally gives legislatures broad au-\nthority to decide how to spend the People’s money. A\nlegislature, after all, generally has the right not to fund\nactivities that it would prefer not to fund—even where the\nactivities are otherwise protected. See, e.g., Regan v.\nTaxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549\n(1983) (“We have held in several contexts that a legisla-\nture’s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamen-\ntal right does not infringe the right”). This Court has\nmade the same point in the context of labor law. See Lyng\nv. Automobile Workers, 485 U. S. 360, 368 (1988) (holding\nthat the Federal Government’s refusal to provide food\nstamp benefits to striking workers was justified because\n“[s]trikers and their union would be much better off if food\nstamps were available,” but the “strikers’ right of associa-\ntion does not require the Government to furnish funds to\nmaximize the exercise of that right”).\n   As far as I can tell, States that do wish to pay for em-\nployer speech are generally free to do so. They might\nmake clear, for example, through grant-related rules and\nregulations that a grant recipient can use the funds to pay\nsalaries and overhead, which salaries and overhead might\ninclude expenditures related to management’s role in\nlabor organizing contests. If so, why should States that do\nnot wish to pay be deprived of a similar freedom? Why\nshould they be conscripted into paying?\n   I can find nothing in the majority’s arguments that\nconvincingly answers these questions. The majority says\nthat California must be acting as an impermissible regula-\ntor because it is not acting as a “market participant” (a\nrole we all agree would permit it broad leeway to act like\nprivate firms in respect to labor matters). Ante, at 9. But\nthe regulator/market-participant distinction suggests a\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfalse dichotomy. The converse of “market participant” is\nnot necessarily “regulator.” A State may appropriate\nfunds without either participating in or regulating the\nlabor market. And the NLRA pre-empts a State’s actions,\nwhen taken as an “appropriator,” only if those actions\namount to impermissible regulation. I have explained\nwhy I believe that California’s actions do not amount to\nimpermissible regulation here.\n  The majority also complains that the statute “imposes a\ntargeted negative restriction,” one applicable only to labor.\nAnte, at 10. I do not find this a fatal objection, because the\ncongressional statutes just discussed (which I believe are\nconsistent with the NLRA) do exactly the same. In any\nevent, if, say, a State can tell employers not to use state\nfunds to pay for a large category of expenses (say, over-\nhead), why can it not tell employers the same about a\nsmaller category of expenses (say, only those overhead\nexpenses related to taking sides in a labor contest). And\nwhere would the line then be drawn? Would the statute\npass master if California had said, do not use our money\nto pay for interior decorating, catered lunches, or labor\nrelations?\n  The majority further objects to the fact that the statute\ndoes not “apply” the constraint “uniformly,” because it\npermits use of state funds for “select employer advocacy\nactivities that promote unions.” Ante, at 10. That last\nphrase presumably refers to an exception in the California\nstatute that permits employers to spend state funds to\nnegotiate a voluntary recognition of a union. But this\nexception underscores California’s basic purpose—\nmaintaining a position of spending neutrality on contested\nlabor matters. Where labor and management agree on\nunionization, there is no conflict.\n                             II\n  I turn now to the statute’s compliance provisions. They\n6       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES\n                      v. BROWN\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrequire grant recipients to maintain “records sufficient to\nshow that no state funds were used” for prohibited expen-\nditures; they deter the use of commingled funds for prohib-\nited expenditures; and they impose serious penalties upon\nviolators. Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §§16645.2(c), 16645.7(b)–\n(c). The majority seems to rest its conclusions in part\nupon its belief that these requirements are too strict, that,\nunder the guise of neutral enforcement, they discourage\nthe use of nonstate money to engage in free debate on\nlabor/management issues. Ante, at 10–11.\n   I agree with the majority that, should the compliance\nprovisions, as a practical matter, unreasonably discourage\nexpenditure of nonstate funds, the NLRA may well pre-\nempt California’s statute. But I cannot say on the basis of\nthe record before us that the statute will have that effect.\n   The language of the statute is clear. The statute re-\nquires recipients of state money to “maintain records\nsufficient to show that no state funds were used” for pro-\nhibited expenditures. §§16645.2, 16645.7(c). And the\nclass of prohibited expenditures is quite broad: It covers\n“any expense” incurred in “any attempt” by an employer to\n“influence the decision of its employees,” including “legal\nand consulting fees and salaries of supervisors and em-\nployees” incurred during research for or the preparation,\nplanning, coordination, or execution of activities to “assist,\npromote, or deter” union organizing. §16646(a) (emphasis\nadded). And where an employer mingles state funds and\nnon-state funds, (say, to pay a particular employee who\nspends part of her time dealing with unionization matters)\nthe employer must determine “on a pro rata basis,” the\nportion of the labor-related expenditure paid for by state\nfunds, and maintain sufficient supporting documentation.\n§16646(b). Any violation of these provisions is then sub-\nject to strict penalties, including treble damages and\nattorney’s fees and costs. §16645.8.\n   What is less clear is the degree to which these provi-\n                  Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)             7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsions actually will deter a recipient of state funds from\nusing non-state funds to engage in unionization matters.\nAnd no lower court has ruled on this matter. In the Dis-\ntrict Court, the Chamber of Commerce moved for sum-\nmary judgment arguing that the statute, by placing re-\nstrictions on state funds, was pre-empted by Machinists\nand Garmon and also arguing that the compliance provi-\nsions are so burdensome that they would chill even private\nexpenditures. California opposed the motion. And Cali-\nfornia submitted expert evidence designed to show that its\n“accounting and recordkeeping requirements . . . are simi-\nlar to requirements imposed in other contexts,” are “sig-\nnificantly less burdensome than the detailed requirements\nfor federal grant recipients,” and allow “flexibility in estab-\nlishing proper accounting procedures and controls.” App.\n282–283.\n   The District Court granted the Chamber of Commerce’s\nmotion for summary judgment in part, finding that the\noperative sections of the statute were pre-empted for the\nreasons I have discussed in Part I, namely, that the opera-\ntive provisions interfered with the NLRA’s policy of en-\ncouraging “free debate.” 225 F. Supp. 2d 1199, 1204 (CD\nCal. 2002). But in doing so, it did not address the Cham-\nber of Commerce’s argument that the California statute’s\ncompliance provisions affected non-state-funded speech to\nthe point that the NLRA pre-empted the statute. Neither\ndid the Court of Appeals address the question whether the\ncompliance provisions themselves constitute sufficient\ngrounds for finding the statute pre-empted.\n   I do not believe that we can, and I would not, decide this\nquestion until the lower courts have had an opportunity to\nconsider and rule upon the compliance-related questions.\nAccordingly, I would vote to vacate the judgment of the\nNinth Circuit and remand for further proceedings on this\nissue.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145790/", "sha1": "4ff18379b5960cd7eafaec3b1f0ad53010077e3d", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2007-058", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:07:46"}
