Rao, Attorney, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for United States.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Rule 32(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, promulgated in response to our decision in <i>Burns v. United States,</i> 501 U.S. 129, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991), states that \"[b]efore the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.\" The question presented by this case is whether that Rule applies to every sentence that is a variance from the recommended Federal Sentencing Guidelines range even though not considered a \"departure\" as that term was used when Rule 32(h) was promulgated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, Richard Irizarry, pleaded guilty to one count of making a threatening interstate communication, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 875(c). Petitioner made the following admissions in the factual resume accompanying his plea: (1) On November 5, 2003, he sent an e-mail threatening to kill his ex-wife and her new husband; (2) he had sent \"dozens\" of similar e-mails in violation of a restraining order; (3) he intended the e-mails to \"convey true threats to kill or injure multiple persons\"; and (4) at all times he acted knowingly and willfully. App. 273-275.</p>\n<p>The presentence report (PSR), in addition to describing the threatening e-mails, reported that petitioner had asked another inmate to kill his ex-wife's new husband. Brief for United States 6. The PSR advised against an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility and recommended a Guidelines sentencing range of 41-to-51 months of imprisonment, based on enhancements for violating court protective orders, making multiple threats, and intending to carry out those threats. Brief for Petitioner 9. As possible grounds for a departure, the probation officer stated that petitioner's criminal history category might not adequately reflect his \"`past criminal conduct or the likelihood that [petitioner] will commit other crimes.'\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Government made no objection to the PSR, but advised the court that it intended to call petitioner's ex-wife as a witness at the sentencing hearing. App. 293. Petitioner objected to the PSR's application of the enhancement based on his intention to carry out the threats and its rejection of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <i>Id.,</i> at 295-296.</p>\n<p>Four witnesses testified at the sentencing hearing. <i>Id.,</i> at 299. Petitioner's ex-wife described incidents of domestic violence, the basis for the restraining order against petitioner, and the threats petitioner made against her and her family and friends. <i>Id.,</i> at 307, 309, 314. She emphasized at some length her genuine concern that petitioner fully intended to carry out his threats. <i>Id.,</i> at 320. A special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was called to describe documents recovered from petitioner's vehicle when he was arrested; those documents indicated he intended to track down his ex-wife and their children. <i>Id.,</i> at 326-328. Petitioner's cellmate next testified that petitioner \"was obsessed with the idea of getting rid of\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2201</span> his ex-wife's husband. <i>Id.,</i> at 336. Finally, petitioner testified at some length, stating that he accepted responsibility for the e-mails, but that he did not really intend to carry out his threats. <i>Id.,</i> at 361. Petitioner also denied speaking to his cellmate about killing his ex-wife's husband. <i>Id.,</i> at 356-357.</p>\n<p>After hearing from counsel, the trial judge delivered a thoughtful oral decision, which included findings resolving certain disputed issues of fact. She found that petitioner had deliberately terrorized his ex-wife, that he intended to carry out one or more of his threats, \"that he still intends to terrorize Ms. Smith by whatever means he can and that he does not accept responsibility for what he has done.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 372. After giving both petitioner and counsel an opportunity to make further comment, the judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I've considered all of the evidence presented today, I've considered everything that's in the presentence report, and I've considered the statutory purpose of sentencing and the sentencing guideline range. I find the guideline range is not appropriate in this case. I find Mr. Irizarry's conduct most disturbing. I am sincerely convinced that he will continue, as his ex-wife testified, in this conduct regardless of what this court does and regardless of what kind of supervision he's under. And based upon that, I find that the maximum time that he can be incapacitated is what is best for society, and therefore the guideline range, I think, is not high enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The guideline range goes up to 51 months, which is only nine months shorter than the statutory maximum. But I think in Mr. Irizarry's case the statutory maximum is what's appropriate, and that's what I'm going to sentence him.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 374-375.</blockquote>\n<p>The court imposed a sentence of 60 months of imprisonment to be followed by a 3-year term of supervised release. <i>Id.,</i> at 375.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel then raised the objection that presents the issue before us today. He stated, \"We didn't have notice of [the court's] intent to upwardly depart. What the law is on that now with,\" to which the Court responded, \"I think the law on that is out the window .... You had notice that the guidelines were only advisory and the court could sentence anywhere within the statutory range.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 377.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed petitioner's sentence, reasoning that Rule 32(h) did not apply because \"the above-guidelines sentence imposed by the district court in this case was a variance, not a guidelines departure.\" 458 F.3d 1208, 1211 (2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> The Court of Appeals declined to extend the rule to variances. \"After [<i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005),] parties are inherently on notice that the sentencing guidelines range is advisory.... Given <i>Booker,</i> parties cannot claim unfair surprise or inability to present informed comment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1212.</p>\n<p>Because the Courts of Appeals are divided with respect to the applicability of Rule 32(h) to Guidelines variances,<sup>[1]</sup> we granted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2202</span> certiorari. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 828, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008). We now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>At the time of our decision in <i>Burns,</i> the Guidelines were mandatory; the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, § 211 <i>et seq.,</i> 98 Stat. 1987, prohibited district courts from disregarding \"the mechanical dictates of the Guidelines\" except in narrowly defined circumstances. 501 U.S., at 133, 111 S.Ct. 2182. Confronted with the constitutional problems that might otherwise arise, we held that the provision of Rule 32 that allowed parties an opportunity to comment on the appropriate sentencenow Rule 32(i)(1)(C)would be \"render[ed] meaningless\" unless the defendant were given notice of any contemplated departure. <i>Id.,</i> at 135-136, 111 S.Ct. 2182. Justice SOUTER disagreed with our conclusion with respect to the text of Rule 32 and conducted a due process analysis. <i>Id.,</i> at 147, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>Any expectation subject to due process protection at the time we decided <i>Burns</i> that a criminal defendant would receive a sentence within the presumptively applicable guideline range did not survive our decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which invalidated the mandatory features of the Guidelines. Now faced with advisory Guidelines, neither the Government nor the defendant may place the same degree of reliance on the type of \"expectancy\" that gave rise to a special need for notice in <i>Burns.</i> Indeed, a sentence outside the Guidelines carries no presumption of unreasonableness. <i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97 (2007); see also <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p>It is, therefore, no longer the case that \"were we to read Rule 32 to dispense with notice [of a contemplated non-Guidelines sentence], we would then have to confront the serious question whether [such] notice in this setting is mandated by the Due Process Clause.\" <i>Burns,</i> 501 U.S., at 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182. The due process concerns that motivated the Court to require notice in a world of mandatory Guidelines no longer provide a basis for this Court to extend the rule set forth in <i>Burns</i> either through an interpretation of Rule 32(h) itself or through Rule 32(i)(1)(C). And contrary to what the dissent argues, <i>post,</i> at 2204-2205 (opinion of BREYER, J.), the rule does not apply to § 3553 variances by its terms. \"Departure\" is a term of art under the Guidelines and refers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed under the framework set out in the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>The notice requirement set out in <i>Burns</i> applied to a narrow category of cases. The only relevant departures were those authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) (1988 ed.), which required \"an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\" That determination could only be made based on \"the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission.\" <i>Ibid.</i> And the notice requirement only applied to the subcategory of those departures that were based on \"a ground not identified as a ground for ... departure either in the presentence report or in a pre-hearing submission.\" <i>Burns,</i> 501 U.S., at 138-139, 111 S.Ct. 2182; see also Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(h). Although the Guidelines, as the \"starting point and the initial benchmark,\" continue to play a role in the sentencing determination, see <i>Gall,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2203</span> 552 U.S., at ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, there is no longer a limit comparable to the one at issue in <i>Burns</i> on the variances from Guidelines ranges that a District Court may find justified under the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V).</p>\n<p>Rule 32(i)(1)(C) requires the district court to allow the parties to comment on \"matters relating to an appropriate sentence,\" and given the scope of the issues that may be considered at a sentencing hearing, a judge will normally be well-advised to withhold her final judgment until after the parties have had a full opportunity to present their evidence and their arguments. Sentencing is \"a fluid and dynamic process and the court itself may not know until the end whether a variance will be adopted, let alone on what grounds.\" <i>United States v. Vega-Santiago,</i> 519 F.3d 1, 4 (C.A.1 2008) (en banc). Adding a special notice requirement whenever a judge is contemplating a variance may create unnecessary delay; a judge who concludes during the sentencing hearing that a variance is appropriate may be forced to continue the hearing even where the content of the Rule 32(h) notice would not affect the parties' presentation of argument and evidence. In the case before us today, even if we assume that the judge had contemplated a variance before the sentencing hearing began, the record does not indicate that a statement announcing that possibility would have changed the parties' presentations in any material way; nor do we think it would in most cases. The Government admits as much in arguing that the error here was harmless. Brief for United States 37-38.</p>\n<p>Sound practice dictates that judges in all cases should make sure that the information provided to the parties in advance of the hearing, and in the hearing itself, has given them an adequate opportunity to confront and debate the relevant issues. We recognize that there will be some cases in which the factual basis for a particular sentence will come as a surprise to a defendant or the Government. The more appropriate response to such a problem is not to extend the reach of Rule 32(h)'s notice requirement categorically, but rather for a district judge to consider granting a continuance when a party has a legitimate basis for claiming that the surprise was prejudicial. As Judge Boudin has noted,</p>\n<blockquote>\"In the normal case a competent lawyer... will anticipate most of what might occur at the sentencing hearingbased on the trial, the pre-sentence report, the exchanges of the parties concerning the report, and the preparation of mitigation evidence. Garden variety considerations of culpability, criminal history, likelihood of re-offense, seriousness of the crime, nature of the conduct and so forth should not generally come as a surprise to trial lawyers who have prepared for sentencing.\" <i>Vega-Santiago,</i> 519 F.3d, at 5.</blockquote>\n<p>The fact that Rule 32(h) remains in effect today does not justify extending its protections to variances; the justification for our decision in <i>Burns</i> no longer exists and such an extension is apt to complicate rather than to simplify sentencing procedures. We have confidence in the ability of district judges and counselespecially in light of Rule 32's other procedural protections<sup>[2]</sup>to make sure that all relevant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2204</span> matters relating to a sentencing decision have been considered before the final sentencing determination is made.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, concurring.</p>\n<p>Earlier this Term, I explained that because \"there is no principled way to apply the <i>Booker</i> remedy,\" it is \"best to apply the statute as written, including 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b), which makes the [Federal Sentencing] Guidelines mandatory.\" <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 578, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (dissenting opinion) (referencing <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 258-265, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)); see also <i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 603 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (applying the Guidelines as mandatory). Consistent with that view, I would hold that the District Court committed statutory error when it imposed a sentence at \"variance\" with the Guidelines in a manner not authorized by the text of the Guidelines, which permit sentences outside the Guidelines, or \"departures,\" only when certain aggravating or mitigating circumstances are present. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 1B1.1 (Nov.2007). But the issue whether such post-<i>Booker</i> \"variances\" are permissible is not currently before us.</p>\n<p>Rather, we are presented with the narrow question whether Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) requires a judge to give notice before he imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines on a ground not identified in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the Government. I agree with the Court that neither Rule 32(h) nor <i>Burns v. United States,</i> 501 U.S. 129, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991), compels a judge to provide notice before imposing a sentence at \"variance\" with the post-<i>Booker</i> advisory Guidelines, <i>ante,</i> at 2203. Each addresses only \"departures\" under the mandatory Guidelines and does not contemplate the drastic changes to federal sentencing wrought by the <i>Booker</i> remedy. For this reason, I join the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom Justice KENNEDY, Justice SOUTER, and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The question before us is whether this Rule applies when a sentencing judge decides, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), to impose a sentence that is a \"variance\" <i>from</i> the advisory Guidelines, but is not a \"departure\" <i>within</i> the Guidelines. The Court says that the Rule does not apply. I disagree.</p>\n<p>The Court creates a legal distinction without much of a difference. The Rule speaks specifically of \"departure[s],\" but I see no reason why that term should not be read to encompass what the Court calls § 3553(a) \"variances.\" The Guidelines define \"departure\" to mean \"imposition of a sentence outside the applicable guideline range or of a sentence that is otherwise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2205</span> different from the guideline sentence.\" United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG), § 1B1.1, comment., n. 1(E) (Nov.2007). So-called variances fall comfortably within this definition. Variances are also consistent with the ordinary meaning of the term \"departure.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> Webster's Third New International Dictionary 604 (1993) (defining \"departure\" to mean a \"deviation or divergence esp. from a rule\" (def. 5a)). And conceptually speaking, the substantive difference between a \"variance\" and a \"departure\" is nonexistent, as this Court's opinions themselves make clear. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-95 (2007) (using the term \"departure\" to describe any non-Guideline sentence); <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464 (2007) (stating that courts \"may depart (either pursuant to the Guidelines or, since <i>Booker,</i> by imposing a non-Guidelines sentence)\").</p>\n<p>Of course, when Rule 32(h) was written, its drafters had <i>only</i> Guidelines-authorized departures in mind: Rule 32(h) was written after the Guidelines took effect but before this Court decided <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Yet the language of a statute or a rule, read in light of its purpose, often applies to circumstances that its authors did not then foresee. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 79-80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998).</p>\n<p>And here, the purpose behind Rule 32(h) requires that the Rule be construed to apply to variances. That Rule was added to \"reflect\" our decision in <i>Burns v. United States,</i> 501 U.S. 129, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991). See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32, 18 U.S.C.App., p. 1141 (2000 ed., Supp. II). (2002 Amendments). In <i>Burns,</i> the Court focused upon \"the extraordinary case in which the district court, on its own initiative and contrary to the expectations both the defendant and the Government, decides that the factual and legal predicates for a departure are satisfied.\" 501 U.S., at 135, 111 S.Ct. 2182. The Court held that \"before a district court can depart upward on a ground not identified as a ground for upward departure either in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the Government ... the district court [must] give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a ruling.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>Our holding in <i>Burns</i> was motivated, in part, by a desire to avoid due process concerns. See 501 U.S., at 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (\"[W]ere we to read Rule 32 to dispense with notice, we would then have to confront the serious question whether notice in this setting is mandated by the Due Process Clause\"). That is perhaps why the majority today suggests that \"[a]ny expectation subject to due process protection at the time we decided <i>Burns</i>\" failed to survive <i>Booker. Ante,</i> at ____. But the due process concern was not the only reason for our holding in <i>Burns,</i> nor was it even the primary one. Rather, the Court principally based its decision upon Rule 32's requirement that parties be given \"`an opportunity to comment upon ... matters relating to the appropriate sentence.'\" 501 U.S., at 135, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (citing then-Rule 32(a)(1)). \"Obviously,\" the Court said, whether a <i>sua sponte</i> departure was warranted was a \"matter relating to the appropriate sentence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). To deprive the parties of notice of such a departure would thus \"rende[r] meaningless\" their right to comment on \"matters relating to the appropriate sentence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 136, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (internal quotation marks omitted). Notice, the Court added, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2206</span> was \"essential to assuring procedural fairness.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>The Court's decision in <i>Burns</i> also relied on what the Court described as Rule 32's overall purpose of \"provid[ing] for focused, adversarial development of the factual and legal issues\" related to sentencing. <i>Id.,</i> at 134, 111 S.Ct. 2182. This could be gleaned, <i>inter alia,</i> from the requirement that parties be given an opportunity to file responses or objections to the presentence report and from the requirement that parties be given an opportunity to speak at the sentencing proceeding. <i>Ibid.</i> Construing Rule 32 not to require notice of <i>sua sponte</i> departures, the Court reasoned, would be \"inconsistent with Rule 32's purpose of promoting focused, adversarial resolution\" of sentencing issues. <i>Id.,</i> at 137, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>The primary grounds for the Court's decision in <i>Burns</i> apply with equal force to the variances we consider here. Today, Rule 32(i)(1)(C) provides a virtually identical requirement that the district court \"allow the parties' attorneys to comment on the probation officer's determinations <i>and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) To deprive the parties of notice of previously unidentified grounds for a variance would <i>today</i> \"rende[r] meaningless\" the parties' right to comment on \"matters relating to [an] appropriate sentence.\" <i>Burns,</i> 501 U.S., at 136, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (internal quotation marks omitted). To deprive the parties of notice would <i>today</i> subvert Rule 32's purpose of \"promoting focused, adversarial resolution\" of sentencing issues. In a word, it is not fair. <i>Id.,</i> at 137, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>Seeking to overcome the fact that text, purpose, and precedent are not on its side, the majority makes two practical arguments in its defense. First, it says that notice is unnecessary because \"there is no longer a limit comparable to the one at issue in <i>Burns</i>\" as to the number of reasons why a district court might <i>sua sponte</i> impose a sentence outside the applicable range. <i>Ante,</i> at ____. Is that so? Courts, while now free to impose sentences that vary from a Guideline-specified range, have <i>always</i> been free to depart from such a range. See USSG ch. 1, pt. A, § 4(b) (Nov.1987), reprinted in § 1A1.1 comment., editorial note (Nov.2007) (suggesting broad departure authority). Indeed, even <i>Burns</i> recognized that \"the Guidelines place essentially no limit on the number of potential factors that may warrant a departure.\" 501 U.S., at 136-137, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (citing USSG ch. 1, pt. A, § 4(b) (1990)). Regardless, if <i>Booker</i> expanded the number of grounds on which a district court may impose a non-Guideline sentence, that would seem to be an additional argument <i>in favor of,</i> not <i>against,</i> giving the parties notice of the district court's intention to impose a non-Guideline sentence for some previously unidentified reason. Notice, after all, would promote \"focused, adversarial\" litigation at sentencing. <i>Burns, supra,</i> at 134, 137, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>Second, the majority fears that a notice requirement would unnecessarily \"delay\" and \"complicate\" sentencing. <i>Ante,</i> at 2203, 2204. But this concern seems exaggerated. Rule 32(h) applies only where the court seeks to depart on a ground <i>not</i> previously identified by the presentence report or the parties' presentencing submissions. And the Solicitor General, after consulting with federal prosecutors, tells us that \"in the vast majority of cases in which a district court imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines range, the grounds for the variance have previously been identified by the [presentence report] or the parties.\" Brief for United States 32.</p>\n<p>In the remaining cases, notice does not necessarily mean delay. The parties may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2207</span> well be prepared to address the point and a meaningful continuance of sentencing would likely be in order only where a party would adduce additional evidence or brief an unconsidered legal issue. Further, to the extent that district judges find a notice requirement to complicate sentencing, those judges could make use of Rule 32(d)(2)(F), which enables them to require that presentence reports address the sentence that would be appropriate in light of the § 3553(a) factors (including, presumably, whether there exist grounds for imposing a non-Guidelines sentence). If a presentence report includes a section on whether a variance would be appropriate under § 3553(a), that would likely eliminate the possibility that the district court would wind up imposing a non-Guidelines sentence for some reason <i>not previously identified.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, if notice <i>still</i> produced some burdens and delay, fairness justifies notice regardless. Indeed, the Government and the defendant herethe parties most directly affected by sentencingboth urge the Court to find a notice requirement. Clearly they recognize, as did the Court in <i>Burns,</i> that notice is \"essential to assuring procedural fairness\" at sentencing. 501 U.S., at 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>I believe that Rule 32(h) provides this procedural safeguard.

United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991), states that \"[b]efore the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.\" The question presented by this case is whether that Rule applies to every sentence that is a variance from the recommended Federal Sentencing Guidelines range even though not considered a \"departure\" as that term was used when Rule 32(h) was promulgated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, Richard Irizarry, pleaded guilty to one count of making a threatening interstate communication, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 875(c). Petitioner made the following admissions in the factual resume accompanying his plea: (1) On November 5, 2003, he sent an e-mail threatening to kill his ex-wife and her new husband; (2) he had sent \"dozens\" of similar e-mails in violation of a restraining order; (3) he intended the e-mails to \"convey true threats to kill or injure multiple persons\"; and (4) at all times he acted knowingly and willfully. App. 273-275.</p>\n<p>The presentence report (PSR), in addition to describing the threatening e-mails, reported that petitioner had asked another inmate to kill his ex-wife's new husband. Brief for United States 6. The PSR advised against an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility and recommended a Guidelines sentencing range of 41-to-51 months of imprisonment, based on enhancements for violating court protective orders, making multiple threats, and intending to carry out those threats. Brief for Petitioner 9. As possible grounds for a departure, the probation officer stated that petitioner's criminal history category might not adequately reflect his \"`past criminal conduct or the likelihood that [petitioner] will commit other crimes.'\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Government made no objection to the PSR, but advised the court that it intended to call petitioner's ex-wife as a witness at the sentencing hearing. App. 293. Petitioner objected to the PSR's application of the enhancement based on his intention to carry out the threats and its rejection of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <i>Id.,</i> at 295-296.</p>\n<p>Four witnesses testified at the sentencing hearing. <i>Id.,</i> at 299. Petitioner's ex-wife described incidents of domestic violence, the basis for the restraining order against petitioner, and the threats petitioner made against her and her family and friends. <i>Id.,</i> at 307, 309, 314. She emphasized at some length her genuine concern that petitioner fully intended to carry out his threats. <i>Id.,</i> at 320. A special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was called to describe documents recovered from petitioner's vehicle when he was arrested; those documents indicated he intended to track down his ex-wife and their children. <i>Id.,</i> at 326-328. Petitioner's cellmate next testified that petitioner \"was obsessed with the idea of getting rid of\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2201</span> his ex-wife's husband. <i>Id.,</i> at 336. Finally, petitioner testified at some length, stating that he accepted responsibility for the e-mails, but that he did not really intend to carry out his threats. <i>Id.,</i> at 361. Petitioner also denied speaking to his cellmate about killing his ex-wife's husband. <i>Id.,</i> at 356-357.</p>\n<p>After hearing from counsel, the trial judge delivered a thoughtful oral decision, which included findings resolving certain disputed issues of fact. She found that petitioner had deliberately terrorized his ex-wife, that he intended to carry out one or more of his threats, \"that he still intends to terrorize Ms. Smith by whatever means he can and that he does not accept responsibility for what he has done.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 372. After giving both petitioner and counsel an opportunity to make further comment, the judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I've considered all of the evidence presented today, I've considered everything that's in the presentence report, and I've considered the statutory purpose of sentencing and the sentencing guideline range. I find the guideline range is not appropriate in this case. I find Mr. Irizarry's conduct most disturbing. I am sincerely convinced that he will continue, as his ex-wife testified, in this conduct regardless of what this court does and regardless of what kind of supervision he's under. And based upon that, I find that the maximum time that he can be incapacitated is what is best for society, and therefore the guideline range, I think, is not high enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The guideline range goes up to 51 months, which is only nine months shorter than the statutory maximum. But I think in Mr. Irizarry's case the statutory maximum is what's appropriate, and that's what I'm going to sentence him.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 374-375.</blockquote>\n<p>The court imposed a sentence of 60 months of imprisonment to be followed by a 3-year term of supervised release. <i>Id.,</i> at 375.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel then raised the objection that presents the issue before us today. He stated, \"We didn't have notice of [the court's] intent to upwardly depart. What the law is on that now with,\" to which the Court responded, \"I think the law on that is out the window .... You had notice that the guidelines were only advisory and the court could sentence anywhere within the statutory range.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 377.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed petitioner's sentence, reasoning that Rule 32(h) did not apply because \"the above-guidelines sentence imposed by the district court in this case was a variance, not a guidelines departure.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77452\"><a href=\"/opinion/77452/usa-v-richard-irizzary/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1208</span></a></span>, 1211 (2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> The Court of Appeals declined to extend the rule to variances. \"After [<i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005),] parties are inherently on notice that the sentencing guidelines range is advisory.... Given <i>Booker,</i> parties cannot claim unfair surprise or inability to present informed comment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1212.</p>\n<p>Because the Courts of Appeals are divided with respect to the applicability of Rule 32(h) to Guidelines variances,<sup>[1]</sup> we granted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2202</span> certiorari. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 828, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008). We now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>At the time of our decision in <i>Burns,</i> the Guidelines were mandatory; the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, § 211 <i>et seq.,</i> 98 Stat. 1987, prohibited district courts from disregarding \"the mechanical dictates of the Guidelines\" except in narrowly defined circumstances. 501 U.S., at 133, 111 S.Ct. 2182. Confronted with the constitutional problems that might otherwise arise, we held that the provision of Rule 32 that allowed parties an opportunity to comment on the appropriate sentencenow Rule 32(i)(1)(C)would be \"render[ed] meaningless\" unless the defendant were given notice of any contemplated departure. <i>Id.,</i> at 135-136, 111 S.Ct. 2182. Justice SOUTER disagreed with our conclusion with respect to the text of Rule 32 and conducted a due process analysis. <i>Id.,</i> at 147, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>Any expectation subject to due process protection at the time we decided <i>Burns</i> that a criminal defendant would receive a sentence within the presumptively applicable guideline range did not survive our decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which invalidated the mandatory features of the Guidelines. Now faced with advisory Guidelines, neither the Government nor the defendant may place the same degree of reliance on the type of \"expectancy\" that gave rise to a special need for notice in <i>Burns.</i> Indeed, a sentence outside the Guidelines carries no presumption of unreasonableness. <i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97 (2007); see also <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p>It is, therefore, no longer the case that \"were we to read Rule 32 to dispense with notice [of a contemplated non-Guidelines sentence], we would then have to confront the serious question whether [such] notice in this setting is mandated by the Due Process Clause.\" <i>Burns,</i> 501 U.S., at 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182. The due process concerns that motivated the Court to require notice in a world of mandatory Guidelines no longer provide a basis for this Court to extend the rule set forth in <i>Burns</i> either through an interpretation of Rule 32(h) itself or through Rule 32(i)(1)(C). And contrary to what the dissent argues, <i>post,</i> at 2204-2205 (opinion of BREYER, J.), the rule does not apply to § 3553 variances by its terms. \"Departure\" is a term of art under the Guidelines and refers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed under the framework set out in the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>The notice requirement set out in <i>Burns</i> applied to a narrow category of cases. The only relevant departures were those authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) (1988 ed.), which required \"an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\" That determination could only be made based on \"the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission.\" <i>Ibid.</i> And the notice requirement only applied to the subcategory of those departures that were based on \"a ground not identified as a ground for ... departure either in the presentence report or in a pre-hearing submission.\" <i>Burns,</i> 501 U.S., at 138-139, 111 S.Ct. 2182; see also Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(h). Although the Guidelines, as the \"starting point and the initial benchmark,\" continue to play a role in the sentencing determination, see <i>Gall,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2203</span> 552 U.S., at ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, there is no longer a limit comparable to the one at issue in <i>Burns</i> on the variances from Guidelines ranges that a District Court may find justified under the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V).</p>\n<p>Rule 32(i)(1)(C) requires the district court to allow the parties to comment on \"matters relating to an appropriate sentence,\" and given the scope of the issues that may be considered at a sentencing hearing, a judge will normally be well-advised to withhold her final judgment until after the parties have had a full opportunity to present their evidence and their arguments. Sentencing is \"a fluid and dynamic process and the court itself may not know until the end whether a variance will be adopted, let alone on what grounds.\" <i>United States v. Vega-Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203171\"><a href=\"/opinion/203171/united-states-v-vega-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (C.A.1 2008) (en banc). Adding a special notice requirement whenever a judge is contemplating a variance may create unnecessary delay; a judge who concludes during the sentencing hearing that a variance is appropriate may be forced to continue the hearing even where the content of the Rule 32(h) notice would not affect the parties' presentation of argument and evidence. In the case before us today, even if we assume that the judge had contemplated a variance before the sentencing hearing began, the record does not indicate that a statement announcing that possibility would have changed the parties' presentations in any material way; nor do we think it would in most cases. The Government admits as much in arguing that the error here was harmless. Brief for United States 37-38.</p>\n<p>Sound practice dictates that judges in all cases should make sure that the information provided to the parties in advance of the hearing, and in the hearing itself, has given them an adequate opportunity to confront and debate the relevant issues. We recognize that there will be some cases in which the factual basis for a particular sentence will come as a surprise to a defendant or the Government. The more appropriate response to such a problem is not to extend the reach of Rule 32(h)'s notice requirement categorically, but rather for a district judge to consider granting a continuance when a party has a legitimate basis for claiming that the surprise was prejudicial. As Judge Boudin has noted,</p>\n<blockquote>\"In the normal case a competent lawyer... will anticipate most of what might occur at the sentencing hearingbased on the trial, the pre-sentence report, the exchanges of the parties concerning the report, and the preparation of mitigation evidence. Garden variety considerations of culpability, criminal history, likelihood of re-offense, seriousness of the crime, nature of the conduct and so forth should not generally come as a surprise to trial lawyers who have prepared for sentencing.\" <i>Vega-Santiago,</i> 519 F.3d, at 5.</blockquote>\n<p>The fact that Rule 32(h) remains in effect today does not justify extending its protections to variances; the justification for our decision in <i>Burns</i> no longer exists and such an extension is apt to complicate rather than to simplify sentencing procedures. We have confidence in the ability of district judges and counselespecially in light of Rule 32's other procedural protections<sup>[2]</sup>to make sure that all relevant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2204</span> matters relating to a sentencing decision have been considered before the final sentencing determination is made.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, concurring.</p>\n<p>Earlier this Term, I explained that because \"there is no principled way to apply the <i>Booker</i> remedy,\" it is \"best to apply the statute as written, including 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b), which makes the [Federal Sentencing] Guidelines mandatory.\" <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 578, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (dissenting opinion) (referencing <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 258-265, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)); see also <i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 603 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (applying the Guidelines as mandatory). Consistent with that view, I would hold that the District Court committed statutory error when it imposed a sentence at \"variance\" with the Guidelines in a manner not authorized by the text of the Guidelines, which permit sentences outside the Guidelines, or \"departures,\" only when certain aggravating or mitigating circumstances are present. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 1B1.1 (Nov.2007). But the issue whether such post-<i>Booker</i> \"variances\" are permissible is not currently before us.</p>\n<p>Rather, we are presented with the narrow question whether Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) requires a judge to give notice before he imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines on a ground not identified in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the Government. I agree with the Court that neither Rule 32(h) nor <i>Burns v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991), compels a judge to provide notice before imposing a sentence at \"variance\" with the post-<i>Booker</i> advisory Guidelines, <i>ante,</i> at 2203. Each addresses only \"departures\" under the mandatory Guidelines and does not contemplate the drastic changes to federal sentencing wrought by the <i>Booker</i> remedy. For this reason, I join the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom Justice KENNEDY, Justice SOUTER, and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The question before us is whether this Rule applies when a sentencing judge decides, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), to impose a sentence that is a \"variance\" <i>from</i> the advisory Guidelines, but is not a \"departure\" <i>within</i> the Guidelines. The Court says that the Rule does not apply. I disagree.</p>\n<p>The Court creates a legal distinction without much of a difference. The Rule speaks specifically of \"departure[s],\" but I see no reason why that term should not be read to encompass what the Court calls § 3553(a) \"variances.\" The Guidelines define \"departure\" to mean \"imposition of a sentence outside the applicable guideline range or of a sentence that is otherwise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2205</span> different from the guideline sentence.\" United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG), § 1B1.1, comment., n. 1(E) (Nov.2007). So-called variances fall comfortably within this definition. Variances are also consistent with the ordinary meaning of the term \"departure.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> Webster's Third New International Dictionary 604 (1993) (defining \"departure\" to mean a \"deviation or divergence esp. from a rule\" (def. 5a)). And conceptually speaking, the substantive difference between a \"variance\" and a \"departure\" is nonexistent, as this Court's opinions themselves make clear. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-95 (2007) (using the term \"departure\" to describe any non-Guideline sentence); <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464 (2007) (stating that courts \"may depart (either pursuant to the Guidelines or, since <i>Booker,</i> by imposing a non-Guidelines sentence)\").</p>\n<p>Of course, when Rule 32(h) was written, its drafters had <i>only</i> Guidelines-authorized departures in mind: Rule 32(h) was written after the Guidelines took effect but before this Court decided <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Yet the language of a statute or a rule, read in light of its purpose, often applies to circumstances that its authors did not then foresee. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118181\"><a href=\"/opinion/118181/oncale-v-sundowner-offshore-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 79-80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998).</p>\n<p>And here, the purpose behind Rule 32(h) requires that the Rule be construed to apply to variances. That Rule was added to \"reflect\" our decision in <i>Burns v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991). See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32, 18 U.S.C.App., p. 1141 (2000 ed., Supp. II). (2002 Amendments). In <i>Burns,</i> the Court focused upon \"the extraordinary case in which the district court, on its own initiative and contrary to the expectations both the defendant and the Government, decides that the factual and legal predicates for a departure are satisfied.\" 501 U.S., at 135, 111 S.Ct. 2182. The Court held that \"before a district court can depart upward on a ground not identified as a ground for upward departure either in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the Government ... the district court [must] give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a ruling.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>Our holding in <i>Burns</i> was motivated, in part, by a desire to avoid due process concerns. See 501 U.S., at 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (\"[W]ere we to read Rule 32 to dispense with notice, we would then have to confront the serious question whether notice in this setting is mandated by the Due Process Clause\"). That is perhaps why the majority today suggests that \"[a]ny expectation subject to due process protection at the time we decided <i>Burns</i>\" failed to survive <i>Booker. Ante,</i> at ____. But the due process concern was not the only reason for our holding in <i>Burns,</i> nor was it even the primary one. Rather, the Court principally based its decision upon Rule 32's requirement that parties be given \"`an opportunity to comment upon ... matters relating to the appropriate sentence.'\" 501 U.S., at 135, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (citing then-Rule 32(a)(1)). \"Obviously,\" the Court said, whether a <i>sua sponte</i> departure was warranted was a \"matter relating to the appropriate sentence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). To deprive the parties of notice of such a departure would thus \"rende[r] meaningless\" their right to comment on \"matters relating to the appropriate sentence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 136, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (internal quotation marks omitted). Notice, the Court added, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2206</span> was \"essential to assuring procedural fairness.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>The Court's decision in <i>Burns</i> also relied on what the Court described as Rule 32's overall purpose of \"provid[ing] for focused, adversarial development of the factual and legal issues\" related to sentencing. <i>Id.,</i> at 134, 111 S.Ct. 2182. This could be gleaned, <i>inter alia,</i> from the requirement that parties be given an opportunity to file responses or objections to the presentence report and from the requirement that parties be given an opportunity to speak at the sentencing proceeding. <i>Ibid.</i> Construing Rule 32 not to require notice of <i>sua sponte</i> departures, the Court reasoned, would be \"inconsistent with Rule 32's purpose of promoting focused, adversarial resolution\" of sentencing issues. <i>Id.,</i> at 137, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>The primary grounds for the Court's decision in <i>Burns</i> apply with equal force to the variances we consider here. Today, Rule 32(i)(1)(C) provides a virtually identical requirement that the district court \"allow the parties' attorneys to comment on the probation officer's determinations <i>and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) To deprive the parties of notice of previously unidentified grounds for a variance would <i>today</i> \"rende[r] meaningless\" the parties' right to comment on \"matters relating to [an] appropriate sentence.\" <i>Burns,</i> 501 U.S., at 136, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (internal quotation marks omitted). To deprive the parties of notice would <i>today</i> subvert Rule 32's purpose of \"promoting focused, adversarial resolution\" of sentencing issues. In a word, it is not fair. <i>Id.,</i> at 137, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>Seeking to overcome the fact that text, purpose, and precedent are not on its side, the majority makes two practical arguments in its defense. First, it says that notice is unnecessary because \"there is no longer a limit comparable to the one at issue in <i>Burns</i>\" as to the number of reasons why a district court might <i>sua sponte</i> impose a sentence outside the applicable range. <i>Ante,</i> at ____. Is that so? Courts, while now free to impose sentences that vary from a Guideline-specified range, have <i>always</i> been free to depart from such a range. See USSG ch. 1, pt. A, § 4(b) (Nov.1987), reprinted in § 1A1.1 comment., editorial note (Nov.2007) (suggesting broad departure authority). Indeed, even <i>Burns</i> recognized that \"the Guidelines place essentially no limit on the number of potential factors that may warrant a departure.\" 501 U.S., at 136-137, 111 S.Ct. 2182 (citing USSG ch. 1, pt. A, § 4(b) (1990)). Regardless, if <i>Booker</i> expanded the number of grounds on which a district court may impose a non-Guideline sentence, that would seem to be an additional argument <i>in favor of,</i> not <i>against,</i> giving the parties notice of the district court's intention to impose a non-Guideline sentence for some previously unidentified reason. Notice, after all, would promote \"focused, adversarial\" litigation at sentencing. <i>Burns, supra,</i> at 134, 137, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>Second, the majority fears that a notice requirement would unnecessarily \"delay\" and \"complicate\" sentencing. <i>Ante,</i> at 2203, 2204. But this concern seems exaggerated. Rule 32(h) applies only where the court seeks to depart on a ground <i>not</i> previously identified by the presentence report or the parties' presentencing submissions. And the Solicitor General, after consulting with federal prosecutors, tells us that \"in the vast majority of cases in which a district court imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines range, the grounds for the variance have previously been identified by the [presentence report] or the parties.\" Brief for United States 32.</p>\n<p>In the remaining cases, notice does not necessarily mean delay. The parties may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2207</span> well be prepared to address the point and a meaningful continuance of sentencing would likely be in order only where a party would adduce additional evidence or brief an unconsidered legal issue. Further, to the extent that district judges find a notice requirement to complicate sentencing, those judges could make use of Rule 32(d)(2)(F), which enables them to require that presentence reports address the sentence that would be appropriate in light of the § 3553(a) factors (including, presumably, whether there exist grounds for imposing a non-Guidelines sentence). If a presentence report includes a section on whether a variance would be appropriate under § 3553(a), that would likely eliminate the possibility that the district court would wind up imposing a non-Guidelines sentence for some reason <i>not previously identified.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, if notice <i>still</i> produced some burdens and delay, fairness justifies notice regardless. Indeed, the Government and the defendant herethe parties most directly affected by sentencingboth urge the Court to find a notice requirement. Clearly they recognize, as did the Court in <i>Burns,</i> that notice is \"essential to assuring procedural fairness\" at sentencing. 501 U.S., at 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p>I believe that Rule 32(h) provides this procedural safeguard. And I would vacate and remand to the Court of Appeals so that it could determine whether the petitioner received the required notice and, if not, act accordingly.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Compare <i>United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 06–7517. Argued April 15, 2008—Decided June 12, 2008\nPetitioner pleaded guilty to making a threatening interstate communi-\n  cation to his ex-wife, in violation of federal law. Although the presen-\n  tence report recommended a Federal Sentencing Guidelines range of\n  41-to-51 months in prison, the court imposed the statutory maximum\n  sentence—60 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release—\n  rejecting petitioner’s objection that he was entitled to notice that the\n  court was contemplating an upward departure. The Eleventh Circuit\n  affirmed, reasoning that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h),\n  which states that “[b]efore the court may depart from the applicable\n  sentencing range on a ground not identified . . . either in the presen-\n  tence report or in a party’s pre-hearing submission, the court must\n  give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a de-\n  parture,” did not apply because the sentence was a variance, not a\n  Guidelines departure.\nHeld: Rule 32(h) does not apply to a variance from a recommended\n Guidelines range. At the time that Burns v. United States, 501 U. S.\n 129, was decided, prompting Rule 32(h)’s promulgation, the Guide-\n lines were mandatory; the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 prohibited\n district courts from disregarding most of the Guidelines’ “mechanical\n dictates,” id., at 133. Confronted with the constitutional problems\n that might otherwise arise, the Burns Court held that the Rule 32\n provision allowing parties to comment on the appropriate sentence—\n now Rule 32(i)(1)(C)—would be “render[ed] meaningless” unless the\n defendant were given notice of a contemplated departure. Id. at 135–\n 136. Any constitutionally protected expectation that a defendant will\n receive a sentence within the presumptively applicable Guidelines\n range did not, however, survive United States v. Booker, 543 U. S.\n 220, which invalidated the Guidelines’ mandatory features. Faced\n2                     IRIZARRY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    with advisory Guidelines, neither the Government nor the defendant\n    may place the same degree of reliance on the type of “expectancy”\n    that gave rise to a special need for notice in Burns. Indeed, a sen-\n    tence outside the Guidelines carries no presumption of unreason-\n    ableness. Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___. Thus, the due\n    process concerns motivating the Court to require notice in a manda-\n    tory Guidelines world no longer provide a basis for extending the\n    Burns rule either through an interpretation of Rule 32(h) itself or\n    through Rule 32(i)(C)(1). Nor does the rule apply to 18 U. S. C. §3553\n    variances by its terms. Although the Guidelines, as the “starting\n    point and the initial benchmark,” continue to play a role in the sen-\n    tencing determination, see Gall, 552 U. S., at ___, there is no longer a\n    limit comparable to the one in Burns on variances from Guidelines\n    ranges that a district court may find justified. This Court is confi-\n    dent that district judges and counsel have the ability—especially in\n    light of Rule 32’s other procedural protections—to make sure that all\n    relevant matters relating to a sentencing decision have been consid-\n    ered before a final determination is made.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 12, 2008] \n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Rule 32(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\npromulgated in response to our decision in Burns v.\nUnited States, 501 U. S. 129 (1991), states that “[b]efore\nthe court may depart from the applicable sentencing range\non a ground not identified for departure either in the\npresentence report or in a party’s prehearing submission,\nthe court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is\ncontemplating such a departure.” The question presented\nby this case is whether that Rule applies to every sentence\nthat is a variance from the recommended Federal Sen-\ntencing Guidelines range even though not considered a\n“departure” as that term was used when Rule 32(h) was\npromulgated.\n                             I\n  Petitioner, Richard Irizarry, pleaded guilty to one count\nof making a threatening interstate communication, in\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. §875(c). Petitioner made the fol-\nlowing admissions in the factual resume accompanying his\nplea: (1) On November 5, 2003, he sent an e-mail threaten-\ning to kill his ex-wife and her new husband; (2) he had\nsent “dozens” of similar e-mails in violation of a restrain-\n2               IRIZARRY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning order; (3) he intended the e-mails to “convey true\nthreats to kill or injure multiple persons”; and (4) at all\ntimes he acted knowingly and willfully. App. 273–275.\n   The presentence report (PSR), in addition to describing\nthe threatening e-mails, reported that petitioner had\nasked another inmate to kill his ex-wife’s new husband.\nBrief for United States 6. The PSR advised against an\nadjustment for acceptance of responsibility and recom-\nmended a Guidelines sentencing range of 41-to-51 months\nof imprisonment, based on enhancements for violating\ncourt protective orders, making multiple threats, and\nintending to carry out those threats. Brief for Petitioner 9.\nAs possible grounds for a departure, the probation officer\nstated that petitioner’s criminal history category might\nnot adequately reflect his “ ‘past criminal conduct or the\nlikelihood that [petitioner] will commit other crimes.’ ”\nIbid.\n   The Government made no objection to the PSR, but\nadvised the court that it intended to call petitioner’s ex-\nwife as a witness at the sentencing hearing. App. 293.\nPetitioner objected to the PSR’s application of the en-\nhancement based on his intention to carry out the threats\nand its rejection of an adjustment for acceptance of re-\nsponsibility. Id., at 295–296.\n   Four witnesses testified at the sentencing hearing. Id.,\nat 299. Petitioner’s ex-wife described incidents of domestic\nviolence, the basis for the restraining order against peti-\ntioner, and the threats petitioner made against her and\nher family and friends. Id., at 307, 309, 314. She empha-\nsized at some length her genuine concern that petitioner\nfully intended to carry out his threats. Id., at 320. A\nspecial agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was\ncalled to describe documents recovered from petitioner’s\nvehicle when he was arrested; those documents indicated\nhe intended to track down his ex-wife and their children.\nId., at 326–328. Petitioner’s cellmate next testified that\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioner “was obsessed with the idea of getting rid of” his\nex-wife’s husband. Id., at 336. Finally, petitioner testified\nat some length, stating that he accepted responsibility for\nthe e-mails, but that he did not really intend to carry out\nhis threats. Id., at 361. Petitioner also denied speaking to\nhis cellmate about killing his ex-wife’s husband. Id., at\n356–357.\n  After hearing from counsel, the trial judge delivered a\nthoughtful oral decision, which included findings resolving\ncertain disputed issues of fact. She found that petitioner\nhad deliberately terrorized his ex-wife, that he intended to\ncarry out one or more of his threats, “that he still intends\nto terrorize Ms. Smith by whatever means he can and that\nhe does not accept responsibility for what he has done.”\nId., at 372. After giving both petitioner and counsel\nan opportunity to make further comment, the judge\nconcluded:\n    “I’ve considered all of the evidence presented today,\n    I’ve considered everything that’s in the presentence\n    report, and I’ve considered the statutory purpose of\n    sentencing and the sentencing guideline range. I find\n    the guideline range is not appropriate in this case. I\n    find Mr. Irizarry’s conduct most disturbing. I am sin-\n    cerely convinced that he will continue, as his ex-wife\n    testified, in this conduct regardless of what this court\n    does and regardless of what kind of supervision he’s\n    under. And based upon that, I find that the maxi-\n    mum time that he can be incapacitated is what is best\n    for society, and therefore the guideline range, I think,\n    is not high enough.\n       “The guideline range goes up to 51 months, which is\n    only nine months shorter than the statutory maxi-\n    mum. But I think in Mr. Irizarry’s case the statutory\n    maximum is what’s appropriate, and that’s what I’m\n    going to sentence him.” Id., at 374–375.\n4                  IRIZARRY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nThe court imposed a sentence of 60 months of imprison-\nment to be followed by a 3-year term of supervised release.\nId., at 375.\n   Defense counsel then raised the objection that presents\nthe issue before us today. He stated, “We didn’t have\nnotice of [the court’s] intent to upwardly depart. What the\nlaw is on that now with—,” to which the Court responded,\n“I think the law on that is out the window. . . . You had\nnotice that the guidelines were only advisory and the court\ncould sentence anywhere within the statutory range.” Id.,\nat 377.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed\npetitioner’s sentence, reasoning that Rule 32(h) did not\napply because “the above-guidelines sentence imposed by\nthe district court in this case was a variance, not a guide-\nlines departure.” 458 F. 3d 1208, 1211 (2006) (per cu-\nriam). The Court of Appeals declined to extend the rule to\nvariances. “After [United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220\n(2005),] parties are inherently on notice that the sentenc-\ning guidelines range is advisory. . . . Given Booker, parties\ncannot claim unfair surprise or inability to present in-\nformed comment.” Id., at 1212.\n   Because the Courts of Appeals are divided with respect\nto the applicability of Rule 32(h) to Guidelines variances,1\nwe granted certiorari. 552 U.

S., at 133.\nConfronted with the constitutional problems that might\notherwise arise, we held that the provision of Rule 32 that\nallowed parties an opportunity to comment on the appro-\npriate sentence—now Rule 32(i)(1)(C)—would be “ren-\nder[ed] meaningless” unless the defendant were given\nnotice of any contemplated departure. Id., at 135–136.\nJUSTICE SOUTER disagreed with our conclusion with re-\nspect to the text of Rule 32 and conducted a due process\nanalysis. Id., at 147 (dissenting opinion).\n   Any expectation subject to due process protection at the\ntime we decided Burns that a criminal defendant would\nreceive a sentence within the presumptively applicable\nguideline range did not survive our decision in United\nStates v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), which invalidated\nthe mandatory features of the Guidelines. Now faced with\nadvisory Guidelines, neither the Government nor the\ndefendant may place the same degree of reliance on the\ntype of “expectancy” that gave rise to a special need for\nnotice in Burns. Indeed, a sentence outside the Guidelines\ncarries no presumption of unreasonableness. Gall v.\nUnited States, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 12); see\nalso Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. ___ (2007).\n   It is, therefore, no longer the case that “were we to read\nRule 32 to dispense with notice [of a contemplated non-\nGuidelines sentence], we would then have to confront the\nserious question whether [such] notice in this setting is\nmandated by the Due Process Clause.” Burns, 501 U. S.,\nat 138. The due process concerns that motivated the\nCourt to require notice in a world of mandatory Guidelines\nno longer provide a basis for this Court to extend the rule\n6                IRIZARRY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nset forth in Burns either through an interpretation of Rule\n32(h) itself or through Rule 32(i)(1)(C). And contrary to\nwhat the dissent argues, post, at 1–2 (opinion of BREYER,\nJ.), the rule does not apply to §3553 variances by its terms.\n“Departure” is a term of art under the Guidelines and\nrefers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed under the\nframework set out in the Guidelines.\n  The notice requirement set out in Burns applied to a\nnarrow category of cases. The only relevant departures\nwere those authorized by 18 U. S. C. §3553(b) (1988 ed.),\nwhich required “an aggravating or mitigating circum-\nstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into\nconsideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulat-\ning the guidelines that should result in a sentence differ-\nent from that described.” That determination could only\nbe made based on “the sentencing guidelines, policy\nstatements, and official commentary of the Sentencing\nCommission.” Ibid. And the notice requirement only\napplied to the subcategory of those departures that were\nbased on “a ground not identified as a ground for . . . de-\nparture either in the presentence report or in a pre-\nhearing submission.” Burns, 501 U. S., at 138–139; see\nalso Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(h). Although the Guidelines,\nas the “starting point and the initial benchmark,” continue\nto play a role in the sentencing determination, see Gall,\n552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11), there is no longer a limit\ncomparable to the one at issue in Burns on the variances\nfrom Guidelines ranges that a District Court may find\njustified under the sentencing factors set forth in 18\nU. S. C. §3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V).\n  Rule 32(i)(1)(C) requires the district court to allow the\nparties to comment on “matters relating to an appropriate\nsentence,” and given the scope of the issues that may be\nconsidered at a sentencing hearing, a judge will normally\nbe well-advised to withhold her final judgment until after\nthe parties have had a full opportunity to present their\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nevidence and their arguments. Sentencing is “a fluid and\ndynamic process and the court itself may not know until\nthe end whether a variance will be adopted, let alone on\nwhat grounds.” United States v. Vega-Santiago, 519 F. 3d\n1, 4 (CA1 2008) (en banc). Adding a special notice re-\nquirement whenever a judge is contemplating a variance\nmay create unnecessary delay; a judge who concludes\nduring the sentencing hearing that a variance is appropri-\nate may be forced to continue the hearing even where the\ncontent of the Rule 32(h) notice would not affect the par-\nties’ presentation of argument and evidence. In the case\nbefore us today, even if we assume that the judge had\ncontemplated a variance before the sentencing hearing\nbegan, the record does not indicate that a statement an-\nnouncing that possibility would have changed the parties’\npresentations in any material way; nor do we think it\nwould in most cases. The Government admits as much in\narguing that the error here was harmless. Brief for\nUnited States 37–38.\n   Sound practice dictates that judges in all cases should\nmake sure that the information provided to the parties in\nadvance of the hearing, and in the hearing itself, has given\nthem an adequate opportunity to confront and debate the\nrelevant issues. We recognize that there will be some\ncases in which the factual basis for a particular sentence\nwill come as a surprise to a defendant or the Government.\nThe more appropriate response to such a problem is not to\nextend the reach of Rule 32(h)’s notice requirement cate-\ngorically, but rather for a district judge to consider grant-\ning a continuance when a party has a legitimate basis for\nclaiming that the surprise was prejudicial. As Judge\nBoudin has noted,\n    “In the normal case a competent lawyer . . . will an-\n    ticipate most of what might occur at the sentencing\n    hearing—based on the trial, the pre-sentence report,\n8                   IRIZARRY v.

We have confidence in the ability\nof district judges and counsel—especially in light of Rule\n32’s other procedural protections2—to make sure that all\nrelevant matters relating to a sentencing decision have\nbeen considered before the final sentencing determination\nis made.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   2 Rule 32 requires that a defendant be given a copy of his PSR at least\n\n35 days before sentencing, Fed.

S. C.\n§3553(b), which makes the [Federal Sentencing] Guide-\nlines mandatory.” Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.\n___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 3) (dissenting opinion) (refer-\nencing United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 258–265\n(2005)); see also Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007)\n(slip op., at 1) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (applying the\nGuidelines as mandatory). Consistent with that view, I\nwould hold that the District Court committed statutory\nerror when it imposed a sentence at “variance” with the\nGuidelines in a manner not authorized by the text of the\nGuidelines, which permit sentences outside the Guide-\nlines, or “departures,” only when certain aggravating or\nmitigating circumstances are present. See United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §1B1.1 (Nov.\n2007). But the issue whether such post-Booker “variances”\nare permissible is not currently before us.\n   Rather, we are presented with the narrow question\nwhether Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) re-\nquires a judge to give notice before he imposes a sentence\noutside the Guidelines on a ground not identified in the\npresentence report or in a prehearing submission by the\nGovernment. I agree with the Court that neither Rule\n2               IRIZARRY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\n32(h) nor Burns v. United States, 501 U.

Each addresses only “departures” under\nthe mandatory Guidelines and does not contemplate the\ndrastic changes to federal sentencing wrought by the\nBooker remedy. For this reason, I join the Court’s opinion.\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 12, 2008] \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY,\nJUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.\n  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) says:\n    “Before the court may depart from the applicable sen-\n    tencing range on a ground not identified for depar-\n    ture either in the presentence report or in a party’s\n    prehearing submission, the court must give the par-\n    ties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a\n    departure.”\nThe question before us is whether this Rule applies when\na sentencing judge decides, pursuant to 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), to impose a sentence that\nis a “variance” from the advisory Guidelines, but is not a\n“departure” within the Guidelines. The Court says that\nthe Rule does not apply. I disagree.\n   The Court creates a legal distinction without much of a\ndifference. The Rule speaks specifically of “departure[s],”\nbut I see no reason why that term should not be read to\nencompass what the Court calls §3553(a) “variances.” The\nGuidelines define “departure” to mean “imposition of a\nsentence outside the applicable guideline range or of a\nsentence that is otherwise different from the guideline\nsentence.” United States Sentencing Commission, Guide-\nlines Manual (USSG), §1B1.1, comment., n. 1(E) (Nov.\n2007). So-called variances fall comfortably within this\n2                IRIZARRY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndefinition. Variances are also consistent with the ordinary\nmeaning of the term “departure.” See, e.g., Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 604 (1993) (defining\n“departure” to mean a “deviation or divergence esp. from a\nrule” (def. 5a)). And conceptually speaking, the substan-\ntive difference between a “variance” and a “departure” is\nnonexistent, as this Court’s opinions themselves make\nclear. See, e.g., Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___–\n___ (2007) (slip op., at 7―8) (using the term “departure” to\ndescribe any non-Guideline sentence); Rita v. United\nStates, 551 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2007) (slip op., at 10) (stat-\ning that courts “may depart (either pursuant to the Guide-\nlines or, since Booker, by imposing a non-Guidelines\nsentence)”).\n   Of course, when Rule 32(h) was written, its drafters had\nonly Guidelines-authorized departures in mind: Rule 32(h)\nwas written after the Guidelines took effect but before this\nCourt decided United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220\n(2005). Yet the language of a statute or a rule, read in\nlight of its purpose, often applies to circumstances that its\nauthors did not then foresee. See, e.g., Oncale v. Sun-\ndowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80 (1998).\n   And here, the purpose behind Rule 32(h) requires that\nthe Rule be construed to apply to variances. That Rule\nwas added to “reflect” our decision in Burns v. United\nStates, 501 U. S. 129 (1991). See Advisory Committee’s\nNotes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32, 18 U. S. C. App.,\np. 1141 (2000 ed., Supp. II). (2002 Amendments). In\nBurns, the Court focused upon “the extraordinary case in\nwhich the district court, on its own initiative and contrary\nto the expectations both the defendant and the Govern-\nment, decides that the factual and legal predicates for a\ndeparture are satisfied.” 501 U. S., at 135. The Court\nheld that “before a district court can depart upward on a\nground not identified as a ground for upward departure\neither in the presentence report or in a prehearing sub-\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

See 501 U. S., at 138\n(“[W]ere we to read Rule 32 to dispense with notice, we\nwould then have to confront the serious question whether\nnotice in this setting is mandated by the Due Process\nClause”). That is perhaps why the majority today sug-\ngests that “[a]ny expectation subject to due process protec-\ntion at the time we decided Burns” failed to survive\nBooker. Ante, at 5. But the due process concern was not\nthe only reason for our holding in Burns, nor was it even\nthe primary one. Rather, the Court principally based its\ndecision upon Rule 32’s requirement that parties be given\n“ ‘an opportunity to comment upon . . . matters relating to\nthe appropriate sentence.’ ” 501 U. S., at 135 (citing then-\nRule 32(a)(1)). “Obviously,” the Court said, whether a\nsua sponte departure was warranted was a “matter relat-\ning to the appropriate sentence.” Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). To deprive the parties of notice of such a\ndeparture would thus “rende[r] meaningless” their right to\ncomment on “matters relating to the appropriate sen-\ntence.” Id., at 136 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nNotice, the Court added, was “essential to assuring proce-\ndural fairness.” Id., at 138.\n    The Court’s decision in Burns also relied on what the\nCourt described as Rule 32’s overall purpose of\n“provid[ing] for focused, adversarial development of the\nfactual and legal issues” related to sentencing. Id., at 134.\nThis could be gleaned, inter alia, from the requirement\nthat parties be given an opportunity to file responses or\nobjections to the presentence report and from the re-\nquirement that parties be given an opportunity to speak at\nthe sentencing proceeding. Ibid. Construing Rule 32 not\nto require notice of sua sponte departures, the Court rea-\n4               IRIZARRY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsoned, would be “inconsistent with Rule 32’s purpose of\npromoting focused, adversarial resolution” of sentencing\nissues. Id., at 137.\n  The primary grounds for the Court’s decision in Burns\napply with equal force to the variances we consider here.\nToday, Rule 32(i)(1)(C) provides a virtually identical re-\nquirement that the district court “allow the parties’ attor-\nneys to comment on the probation officer’s determinations\nand other matters relating to an appropriate sentence.”\n(Emphasis added.) To deprive the parties of notice of\npreviously unidentified grounds for a variance would\ntoday “rende[r] meaningless” the parties’ right to comment\non “matters relating to [an] appropriate sentence.” Burns,\n501 U. S., at 136 (internal quotation marks omitted). To\ndeprive the parties of notice would today subvert Rule 32’s\npurpose of “promoting focused, adversarial resolution” of\nsentencing issues. In a word, it is not fair. Id., at 137.\n  Seeking to overcome the fact that text, purpose, and\nprecedent are not on its side, the majority makes two\npractical arguments in its defense. First, it says that\nnotice is unnecessary because “there is no longer a limit\ncomparable to the one at issue in Burns” as to the number\nof reasons why a district court might sua sponte impose a\nsentence outside the applicable range. Ante, at 6. Is that\nso? Courts, while now free to impose sentences that vary\nfrom a Guideline-specified range, have always been free to\ndepart from such a range. See USSG ch. 1, pt. A, §4(b)\n(Nov. 1987), reprinted in §1A1.1 comment., editorial note\n(Nov. 2007) (suggesting broad departure authority). In-\ndeed, even Burns recognized that “the Guidelines place\nessentially no limit on the number of potential factors that\nmay warrant a departure.” 501 U. S., 136–137 (citing\nUSSG ch. 1, pt. A, §4(b) (1990)). Regardless, if Booker\nexpanded the number of grounds on which a district court\nmay impose a non-Guideline sentence, that would seem to\nbe an additional argument in favor of, not against, giving\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe parties notice of the district court’s intention to impose\na non-Guideline sentence for some previously unidentified\nreason. Notice, after all, would promote “focused, adver-\nsarial” litigation at sentencing. Burns, supra, at 134, 137.\n   Second, the majority fears that a notice requirement\nwould unnecessarily “delay” and “complicate” sentencing.\nAnte, at 7, 8. But this concern seems exaggerated. Rule\n32(h) applies only where the court seeks to depart on a\nground not previously identified by the presentence report\nor the parties’ presentencing submissions. And the Solici-\ntor General, after consulting with federal prosecutors, tells\nus that “in the vast majority of cases in which a district\ncourt imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines range, the\ngrounds for the variance have previously been identified\nby the [presentence report] or the parties.” Brief for\nUnited States 32.\n   In the remaining cases, notice does not necessarily mean\ndelay. The parties may well be prepared to address the\npoint and a meaningful continuance of sentencing would\nlikely be in order only where a party would adduce addi-\ntional evidence or brief an unconsidered legal issue. Fur-\nther, to the extent that district judges find a notice re-\nquirement to complicate sentencing, those judges could\nmake use of Rule 32(d)(2)(F), which enables them to re-\nquire that presentence reports address the sentence that\nwould be appropriate in light of the §3553(a) factors (in-\ncluding, presumably, whether there exist grounds for\nimposing a non-Guidelines sentence). If a presentence\nreport includes a section on whether a variance would be\nappropriate under §3553(a), that would likely eliminate\nthe possibility that the district court would wind up impos-\ning a non-Guidelines sentence for some reason not previ-\nously identified.\n   Finally, if notice still produced some burdens and delay,\nfairness justifies notice regardless. Indeed, the Govern-\nment and the defendant here—the parties most directly\n6               IRIZARRY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\naffected by sentencing—both urge the Court to find a\nnotice requirement. Clearly they recognize, as did the\nCourt in Burns, that notice is “essential to assuring proce-\ndural fairness” at sentencing. 501 U. S., at 138.\n  I believe that Rule 32(h) provides this procedural safe-\nguard. And I would vacate and remand to the Court of\nAppeals so that it could determine whether the petitioner\nreceived the required notice and, if not, act accordingly.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145796/", "sha1": "0c26f26574e7e6054440daad6e4c0af6b1e78dbf", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2007-052", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:00"}
