The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit limited recovery to the attorney's cost. 472 F.3d 1370 (2006). We reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Richlin Security Service Co. (Richlin) is a small California proprietorship. In the early 1990's, it was engaged by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to provide guard services for detainees at Los Angeles International Airport. Through mutual mistake, the parties' two contracts misclassified Richlin's employees under the Service Contract Act of 1965, 41 U.S.C. § 351 <i>et seq.</i> The Department of Labor discovered the misclassification and ordered Richlin to pay its employees back wages. Richlin responded by filing a claim against the Government with the Department of Transportation's Board of Contract Appeals (Board). The claim sought reformation of the two contracts in order to force the Government to make additional payments necessary to cover Richlin's liability under the Service Contract Act. Richlin prevailed after extensive litigation, and the Board entered an award in its favor.</p>\n<p>Richlin then filed an application with the Board for reimbursement of its attorney's fees, expenses, and costs pursuant to EAJA. Under EAJA, \"[a]n agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award, to a prevailing party other than the United States, fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\" 5 U.S.C. § 504(a)(1). In addition to its other fees and expenses, Richlin sought $45,141.10 for 523.8 hours of paralegal work on its contract claim and $6,760 for 68.2 hours of paralegal work on the EAJA application itself.</p>\n<p>The Board granted Richlin's application in part. <i>Richlin Security Service Co. v. Department of Justice,</i> Nos. WRO-06-90, WRO-03-91, 2005 WL 1635099 (June 30, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a. It found that Richlin met § 504(b)(1)(B)'s eligibility requirements, see <i>id.,</i> at 30a, and that the Government's position had not been \"substantially <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2011</span> justified\" within the meaning of § 504(a)(1), <i>id.,</i> at 32a. It concluded, however, that Richlin was not entitled to recover its paralegal fees at the rates (ranging from $50 per hour to $95 per hour) at which Richlin was billed by its law firm.<sup>[1]</sup> See <i>id.,</i> at 39a. The Board held that EAJA limited recovery of paralegal fees to \"the cost to the firm rather than ... the billed rate.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Richlin had not submitted any evidence regarding the cost of the paralegal services to its law firm, see <i>ibid.,</i> but the Board found that \"$35 per hour is a reasonable cost to the firm[,] having taken judicial notice of paralegal salaries in the Washington D.C. area as reflected on the internet.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 42a-43a.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Federal Circuit affirmed. 472 F.3d 1370. The court construed the term \"fees,\" for which EAJA authorizes recovery at \"prevailing market rates,\" § 504(b)(1)(A), as embracing only the fees of attorneys, experts, and agents.<sup>[2]</sup> See <i>id.,</i> at 1374. The court declined to follow the contrary decision of the Eleventh Circuit in <i>Jean v. Nelson,</i> 863 F.2d 759 (1988), aff'd <i>sub nom. </i><i>Commissioner v. Jean,</i> 496 U.S. 154, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990). It also distinguished this Court's decisions in <i>Missouri v. Jenkins,</i> 491 U.S. 274, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989), and <i>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey,</i> 499 U.S. 83, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991), reasoning that those cases involved a different fee-shifting statute with different \"`goals and objectives.'\" 472 F.3d, at 1375-1377, 1379 (discussing the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988). The court instead found support for its interpretation in EAJA's legislative history, see 472 F.3d, at 1381 (citing S.Rep. No. 98-586 (1984) (hereinafter S. Rep.)), and in considerations of public policy, see 472 F.3d, at 1380-1381.</p>\n<p>Judge Plager dissented. He believed that the authorities distinguished by the majority (particularly this Court's decisions in <i>Jenkins</i> and <i>Casey</i>) were indistinguishable. He also identified \"sound policy reasons for ... adopting the Supreme Court's take of the case, even if we thought we had a choice.\" 472 F.3d, at 1383.</p>\n<p>Richlin petitioned for rehearing, pointing out that the approach taken by the Eleventh Circuit in <i>Jean</i> had been followed by several other Circuits. See 482 F.3d 1358, 1359 (C.A.Fed.2007) (citing <i>Role Models Am., Inc. v. Brownlee,</i> 353 F.3d 962, 974 (C.A.D.C.2004); <i>Hyatt v. Barnhart,</i> 315 F.3d 239, 255 (C.A.4 2002); and <i>Miller v. Alamo,</i> 983 F.2d 856, 862 (C.A.8 1993)). The panel denied rehearing over Judge Plager's dissent, and the full court denied rehearing en banc. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari. 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 613, 169 L.Ed.2d 392 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>EAJA permits an eligible prevailing party to recover \"fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with\" a proceeding before an administrative agency. 5 U.S.C. § 504(a)(1). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2012</span> EAJA defines \"fees and other expenses\" as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`[F]ees and other expenses' includes the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project which is found by the agency to be necessary for the preparation of the party's case, and reasonable attorney or agent fees (The amount of fees awarded under this section shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that (i) no expert witness shall be compensated at a rate in excess of the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the agency involved, and (ii) attorney or agent fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the agency determines by regulation that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.)\" § 504(b)(1)(A).<sup>[3]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>In this case, Richlin \"incurred\" \"fees\" for paralegal services in connection with its contract action before the Board. Since § 504(b)(1)(A) awards fees at \"prevailing market rates,\" a straightforward reading of the statute leads to the conclusion that Richlin was entitled to recover fees for the paralegal services it purchased at the market rate for such services.</p>\n<p>The Government resists this reading by distinguishing \"fees\" from \"other expenses.\" The Government concedes that \"fees\" are reimbursable at \"prevailing market rates,\" but it insists that \"other expenses\" (including expenses for \"any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project\") are reimbursable only at their \"reasonable cost.\" And in the Government's view, outlays for paralegal services are better characterized as \"other expenses\" than as \"fees.\" The Government observes that the second sentence of § 504(b)(1)(A), which explains how to calculate awards for \"fees,\" refers to attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, without mentioning paralegals. From this omission, the Government infers that Congress intended to treat expenditures for paralegal services not as \"fees\" but as \"other expenses,\" recoverable at \"reasonable cost.\"</p>\n<p>We find the Government's fractured interpretation of the statute unpersuasive. Contrary to the Government's contention, § 504(b)(1)(A) does not clearly distinguish between the rates at which \"fees\" and \"other expenses\" are reimbursed. Although the statute does refer to the \"reasonable cost\" of \"any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project,\" Congress may reasonably have believed that market rates would not exist for work product of that kind. At one point, Congress even appears to use the terms \"expenses\" and \"fees\" interchangeably: The first clause of § 504(b)(1)(A) refers to the \"reasonable expenses of expert witnesses,\" while the parenthetical characterizes expert compensation as \"fees.\" There is no indication that Congress, in using the term \"expenses\" in one place and \"fees\" in the other, was referring to two different components of expert remuneration.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2013</span> Even if the dichotomy that the Government draws between \"fees\" and \"other expenses\" were supported by the statutory text, it would hardly follow that amounts billed for paralegal services should be classified as \"expenses\" rather than as \"fees.\" The Government concludes that the omission of paralegal fees from § 504(b)(1)(A)'s parenthetical (which generally authorizes reimbursement at \"prevailing market rates\") implies that the recovery of paralegal fees is limited to cost. But one could just as easily conclude that the omission of paralegal fees from the litany of \"any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project\" (all of which are recoverable at \"reasonable cost\") implies that paralegal fees are recoverable at market rates. Surely paralegals are more analogous to attorneys, experts, and agents than to studies, analyses, reports, tests, and projects. Even the Government's brief, which incants the term \"paralegal expenses,\" <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondent 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, slips up once and refers to them as \"fees,\" see <i>id.,</i> at 35 (\"As the court of appeals explained, treating paralegal fees as attorney fees could `distort the normal allocation of work and result in a less efficient performance of legal services' under the EAJA...\").</p>\n<p>But even if we agreed that EAJA limited a prevailing party's recovery for paralegal fees to \"reasonable cost,\" it certainly would not follow that the cost should be measured from the perspective of the party's attorney.<sup>[4]</sup> To the contrary, it would be anomalous to measure cost from the perspective of the attorney rather than the client. We do not understand the Government to contend, for example, that the \"reasonable cost\" of an \"engineering report\" or \"analysis\" should be calculated from the perspective of the firm that employs the engineer or analyst. Such an interpretation would be tough to square with the statutory language. Section 504(a)(1) provides that an agency shall award to a prevailing party \"fees and other expenses <i>incurred by that party.</i>\" See also § 504(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added). That language leaves no doubt that Congress intended the \"reasonable cost\" of the specified items in § 504(b)(1)(A) to be calculated from the perspective of the litigant. That being the case, we find it hard to believe that Congress, without even mentioning paralegals, intended to make an exception of them by calculating their cost from the perspective of their employer rather than the litigant. It seems more plausible that Congress intended all \"fees and other expenses\" to be recoverable at the litigant's \"reasonable cost,\" subject to the proviso that \"reasonable cost\" would be deemed to be \"prevailing market rates\" when such rates could be determined.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2014</span> B</h2>\n<p>To the extent that some ambiguity subsists in the statutory text, we need not look far to resolve it, for we have already addressed a similar question with respect to another fee-shifting statute. In <i>Missouri v. Jenkins,</i> 491 U.S. 274, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989), we considered whether litigants could recover paralegal fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Section 1988 provides that \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" We concluded that the term \"attorney's fee\" in § 1988 \"cannot have been meant to compensate only work performed personally by members of the bar.\" 491 U.S., at 285, 109 S.Ct. 2463. Although separate billing for paralegals had become \"increasingly widespread,\" <i>id.,</i> at 286, 109 S.Ct. 2463 (internal quotation marks omitted), attorney's fees had traditionally subsumed both the attorney's personal labor and the labor of paralegals and other individuals who contributed to the attorney's work product, see <i>id.,</i> at 285, 109 S.Ct. 2463. We were so confident that Congress had given the term \"attorney's fees\" this traditional gloss that we declared it \"self-evident\" that the term embraced the fees of paralegals as well as attorneys. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We think <i>Jenkins</i> substantially answers the question before us. EAJA, like § 1988, entitles certain parties to recover \"reasonable attorney ... fees.\" 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A). EAJA, like § 1988, makes no mention of the paralegals, \"secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an attorney bills her client.\" <i>Jenkins, supra,</i> at 285, 109 S.Ct. 2463. And we think EAJA, like § 1988, must be interpreted as using the term \"attorney ... fees\" to reach fees for paralegal services as well as compensation for the attorney's personal labor. The Government does not contend that the meaning of the term \"attorney's fees\" changed so much between § 1988's enactment in 1976 and EAJA's enactment in 1980 that the term's meaning in one statute must be different from its meaning in the other. Under the reasoning of <i>Jenkins,</i> we take it as \"self-evident\" that when Congress instructed agencies to award \"attorney ... fees\" to certain parties prevailing against the Government, that term was intended to embrace paralegal fees as well. Since § 504 generally provides for recovery of attorney's fees at \"prevailing market rates,\" it follows that fees for paralegal services must be recoverable at prevailing market rates as well.</p>\n<p>The Government contends that our decision in <i>Jenkins</i> was driven by considerations arising from the different context in which the term \"attorney's fee\" was used in § 1988. At the time <i>Jenkins</i> was decided, § 1988 provided for the recovery of attorney's fees without reference to any other recoverable \"expenses.\" The Government insists that <i>Jenkins</i> found paralegal fees recoverable under the guise of \"attorney's fee[s]\" because otherwise paralegal fees would not be recoverable at all. Since EAJA expressly permits recovery (albeit at \"cost\") for items other than attorney, agent, and expert witness fees, the Government sees no reason to give EAJA the broad construction that <i>Jenkins</i> gave § 1988.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2015</span> The Government's rationale for distinguishing <i>Jenkins</i> finds no support either in our opinion there or in our subsequent decisions. Our opinion in <i>Jenkins</i> expressed no apprehension at the possibility that a contrary decision would leave the claimant emptyhanded. This omission is unsurprising, since our decision in <i>Jenkins</i> did not rest on the conviction that recovery at market rates was better than nothing. Our decision rested instead on the propositiona proposition we took as \"self-evident\"that the term \"attorney's fee\" had historically included fees for paralegal services.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Government's interpretation of <i>Jenkins</i> was rejected by this Court just two years after <i>Jenkins</i> was handed down. In <i>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey,</i> 499 U.S. 83, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68, the petitioner sought to recover expert witness fees from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pursuant to § 1988. The petitioner looked to <i>Jenkins</i> for the proposition that the \"broad remedial purposes\" of § 1988 allowed the recovery of fees not expressly authorized by statute. The Court rejected that interpretation of <i>Jenkins:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"The issue [in <i>Jenkins</i>] was not, as [petitioner] contends, whether we would permit our perception of the `policy' of the statute to overcome its `plain language.' It was not remotely plain in <i>Jenkins</i> that the phrase `attorney's fee' did not include charges for law clerk and paralegal services. Such services, like the services of `secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product,' had traditionally been included in calculation of the lawyers' hourly rates. Only recently had there arisen `the increasingly widespread custom of separately billing for [such] services.' By contrast, there has never been, to our knowledge, a practice of including the cost of expert services within attorneys' hourly rates. There was also no record in <i>Jenkins</i>as there is a lengthy record hereof statutory usage that recognizes a distinction between the charges at issue and attorney's fees.\" <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 99, 111 S.Ct. 1138 (quoting 491 U.S., at 285-286, 109 S.Ct. 2463) (some internal quotation marks and citations omitted).<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Our analysis of <i>Jenkins</i> in <i>Casey</i> refutes the Government's claim that <i>Jenkins</i> had to stretch the law to fit hard facts. As <i>Casey</i> shows, our decision in <i>Jenkins</i> turned not on extratextual policy goals but on the traditional meaning of the term \"attorney's fees.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Government parries this textual and doctrinal analysis with legislative history and public policy. We are not persuaded by either. The legislative history cited by the Government does not address the question presented, and policy considerations actually counsel in favor of Richlin's interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Government contends first that a 1984 Senate Report accompanying the bill that reenacted EAJA<sup>[7]</sup> unequivocally expressed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2016</span> congressional intent that paralegal fees should be recovered only <i>\"`at cost.'\"</i> Brief for Respondent 29 (quoting S. Rep., at 15; emphasis in original). It next contends that the Report tacitly endorsed the same result by approving model rules of the Administrative Conference of the United States and a pre-EAJA Sixth Circuit decision, both of which had adopted schemes of reimbursement at attorney cost. See Brief for Respondent 29. We are not persuaded. In our view, the legislative history does not even address the question presented, much less answer it in the Government's favor.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The Senate Report accompanying the 1984 bill remarked that \"[e]xamples of the type of expenses that should ordinarily be compensable [under EAJA] include paralegal time (billed at cost).\" S. Rep., at 15. The Government concludes from this stray remark that Congress intended to limit recovery of paralegal fees to attorney cost. But as we observed earlier, the word \"cost\" could just as easily (and more sensibly) refer to the client's cost rather than the attorney's cost. Under the former interpretation, the Senate Report simply indicates that a prevailing party who satisfies EAJA's other requirements should generally be able to \"bil[l]\" the Government for any reasonable amount the party paid for paralegal services. Since the litigant's out-of-pocket cost for paralegal services would normally be equal to the \"prevailing market rat[e]\" for such services, 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A), the Senate Report could easily support Richlin's interpretation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even if the Government's interpretation of the word \"cost\" is correct, that interpretation would not be inconsistent with our decision today. \"Nothing in [EAJA] requires that the work of paralegals invariably be billed separately. If it is the practice in the relevant market not to do so, or to bill the work of paralegals only at cost, that is all that [EAJA] requires.\" <i>Jenkins, supra,</i> at 288, 109 S.Ct. 2463 (construing 42 U.S.C. § 1988). We thus recognize the possibility, as we did in <i>Jenkins,</i> that the attorney's cost for paralegal services will supply the relevant metric for calculating the client's recovery. Whether that metric is appropriate depends on market practice. The Senate Report, even under the Government's contestable interpretation, is not inconsistent with that conclusion. On the contrary, the Report implies that courts should look to market practice in setting EAJA awards. See S. Rep., at 15 (\"The Act should not be read ... to permit reimbursement for items <i>ordinarily</i> included in office overhead, nor for any other expenses not reasonable in amount, necessary for the conduct of the litigation, <i>and customarily chargeable to clients</i>\" (emphasis added)). Beyond that vague guidance, the Report <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2017</span> does not address the critical question in this case: whether EAJA limits recovery of paralegal fees to attorney cost <i>regardless of market practice.</i> As such, the Report does not persuade us of the soundness of the Government's interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p>The Government's reliance on the Sixth Circuit's decision in <i>Northcross v. Board of Ed. of the Memphis City Schools,</i> 611 F.2d 624 (1979), founders for the same reason. The Government contends that <i>Northcross</i> approved of reimbursement at attorney cost under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and that the 1984 Senate Report, by endorsing <i>Northcross,</i> tacitly approved of the same result for EAJA. See Brief for Respondent 30 (citing <i>Northcross, supra,</i> at 639). The problem again is that <i>Northcross</i> did not decide whether a litigant's recovery for paralegal services would be limited to his attorney's cost even in a market where litigants were customarily billed at \"prevailing market rates.\" Although the Sixth Circuit seems to have been aware that paralegal services could be billed to clients at market rates, some language in its opinion suggests that the court assumed that attorneys billed their clients only for the out-of-pocket cost of paralegal services.<sup>[9]</sup> Since <i>Northcross</i> does not clearly address the question presented, its endorsement in the Senate Report means little.</p>\n<p>Finally, the model rules cited in the Senate Report may actually support Richlin's position. The implementing release for the rules describes the Administrative Conference's approach to paralegal costs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Commenters also took varying positions on whether paralegal costs should be chargeable as expenses. We do not believe the rules should discourage the use of paralegals, which can be an important cost-saving measure. On the other hand, lawyers' practices with respect to charging for paralegal time, as with respect to other expenses such as duplicating, telephone charges and the like, vary according to locality, field of practice, and individual custom. We have decided not to designate specific items as compensable expenses. Instead, we will adopt a suggestion of the Treasury Department and revise the model rule to provide that expenses may be charged as a separate item if they are ordinarily so charged to the attorney's clients.\" Administrative Conference of the U.S., Equal Access to Justice Act: Agency Implementation, 46 Fed. Reg. 32905 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p>To the extent that this passage addresses the question presented at all, it seems to take the same approach that the Court took in <i>Jenkins</i> and that we adopt today: it allows the recovery of paralegal fees according to \"the practice in the relevant market.\" 491 U.S., at 288, 109 S.Ct. 2463. But we think the fairest interpretation of the implementing release is that it does not address how awards for paralegal fees should be calculated. Instead, it addresses the anterior question whether courts may award paralegal fees under EAJA at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2018</span> all. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 46 Fed.Reg. 32905 (responding to comments urging that the model rules \"identify particular expenses of attorneys and witnesses that are compensable\"). Like the other legislative authorities cited by the Government, the model rules fail to persuade us of the soundness of the Government's interpretation because they fail to clearly address the question presented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>We find the Government's policy rationale for recovery at attorney cost likewise unpersuasive. The Government argues that market-based recovery would distort litigant incentives because EAJA would cap paralegal and attorney's fees at the same rate. See 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A) (\"[A]ttorney or agent fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the agency determines by regulation that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee\"). The Government observes that paralegal rates are lower than rates for attorneys operating in the same market. If EAJA reimbursed both attorney time and paralegal time at market rates, then the cap would clip more off the top of the attorney's rates than the paralegal's rates. According to the Government, a market-based scheme would encourage litigants to shift an inefficient amount of attorney work to paralegals, since paralegal fees could be recovered at a greater percentage of their full market value.</p>\n<p>The problem with this argument, as Richlin points out, is that it proves too much. The same reasoning would imply that agent fees should not be recoverable at market rates.<sup>[10]</sup> If market-based recovery of paralegal time resulted in excessive reliance on paralegals, then market-based recovery of agent time should result in excessive reliance on agents. The same reasoning would also imply that fees for junior attorneys (who generally bill at lower rates than senior attorneys) should not be recoverable at market rates. Cf. <i>Jenkins, supra,</i> at 287, 109 S.Ct. 2463 (\"If the fees are consistent with market rates and practices, the `windfall' argument has no more force with regard to paralegals than it does for associates\"). Yet despite the possibility that market-based recovery of attorney and agent fees would distort litigant incentives, § 504 unambiguously authorizes awards of \"reasonable attorney or agent fees ... [at] prevailing market rates.\" 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A). The Government offers no persuasive reason why Congress would have treated paralegal fees any differently. The Government's policy rationale thus founders on the text of the statute, which shows that Congress was untroubled by the very distortion the Government seeks to prevent.</p>\n<p>We also question the practical feasibility of the Government's interpretation of the statute. The Board in this case relied on the Internet for data on paralegal salaries in the District of Columbia, but the Government fails to explain why a law firm's cost should be limited to salary. The benefits and perks with which a firm compensates its staff come out of the bottom line no less than salary. The Government has offered no solution to this accounting problem, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2019</span> and we do not believe that solutions are readily to be found. Market practice provides by far the more transparent basis for calculating a prevailing party's recovery under EAJA. It strains credulity that Congress would have abandoned this predictable, workable framework for the uncertain and complex accounting requirements that a cost-based rule would inflict on litigants, their attorneys, administrative agencies, and the courts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Confronted with the flaws in its interpretation of the statute, the Government seeks shelter in a canon of construction. According to the Government, any right to recover paralegal fees under EAJA must be read narrowly in light of the statutory canon requiring strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p>The sovereign immunity canon is just thata canon of construction. It is a tool for interpreting the law, and we have never held that it displaces the other traditional tools of statutory construction. Indeed, the cases on which the Government relies all used other tools of construction in tandem with the sovereign immunity canon. See <i>Ardestani v. INS,</i> 502 U.S. 129, 137, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991) (relying on the canon as \"reinforce[ment]\" for the independent \"conclusion that any ambiguities in the legislative history are insufficient to undercut the ordinary understanding of the statutory language\"); <i>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club,</i> 463 U.S. 680, 682, 685-686, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983) (relying on the canon in tandem with \"historic principles of fee-shifting in this and other countries\" to define the scope of a fee-shifting statute); <i>Department of Energy v. Ohio,</i> 503 U.S. 607, 626-627, 112 S.Ct. 1627, 118 L.Ed.2d 255 (1992) (resorting to the canon only after a close reading of the statutory provision had left the Court \"with an unanswered question and an unresolved tension between closely related statutory provisions\"); see also <i>Smith v. United States,</i> 507 U.S. 197, 201-203, 113 S.Ct. 1178, 122 L.Ed.2d 548 (1993) (invoking the sovereign immunity canon only after observing that the claimant's argument was \"undermine[d]\" by the \"commonsense meaning\" of the statutory language). In this case, traditional tools of statutory construction and considerations of stare decisis compel the conclusion that paralegal fees are recoverable as attorney's fees at their \"prevailing market rates.\" 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A). There is no need for us to resort to the sovereign immunity canon because there is no ambiguity left for us to construe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we hold that a prevailing party that satisfies EAJA's other requirements may recover its paralegal fees from the Government at prevailing market rates. The Board's contrary decision was error, and the Federal Circuit erred in affirming that decision. The judgment of the Federal Circuit is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Justice SCALIA joins this opinion except as to Part III-A, and Justice THOMAS joins this opinion except as to Parts II-B and III.</p>\n<p>[1]  Richlin was actually billed for paralegal services at rates as high as $135 per hour, but it amended its application to cap the fees at $95 per hour. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a; Brief for Petitioner 9; Brief for Respondent 4, n. 2.</p>\n<p>[2]  Some agencies allow nonattorney representatives, known as \"agents,\" to assist parties with the presentation of their cases. See n. 10, <i>infra.</i> Richlin has never claimed that a paralegal may qualify as an \"agent\" within the meaning of § 504(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>[3]  Virtually identical fee-shifting provisions apply to actions by or against the Government in federal court. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2412(a)(1), (d)(2)(A). The question presented addresses both §§ 504 and 2412, but the Federal Circuit's decision resolved only petitioner's § 504 application, and the Government avers (without challenge from Richlin) that § 2412 \"is not at issue in this case.\" Brief for Respondent 2, n. 1. We assume without deciding that the reasoning of our opinion would extend equally to §§ 504 and 2412. We confine our discussion to § 504.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Government contends that the question presented does not fairly include the question whether the cost of paralegal services should be calculated from the perspective of the litigant rather than the litigant's attorney. We disagree. The question presented in Richlin's petition for certiorari was whether \"a prevailing party [may] be awarded attorney fees for paralegal services at the market rate for such services, ... [or at] cost only.\" Pet. for Cert. i. A decision limiting reimbursement to \"cost only\" would simply beg the question of how that cost should be measured. Since the question presented cannot genuinely be answered without addressing the subsidiary question, we have no difficulty concluding that the latter question is \"fairly included\" within the former. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a).</p>\n<p>[5]  It is worth recalling that the Board calculated Richlin's award based on an Internet survey of paralegal salaries in the District of Columbia. Presumably the salaries the Board identified represented the market rate for paralegal compensation. The limited award that the Government wants affirmed was thus based, ironically enough, on the \"prevailing market rates\" for paralegal services. The fact that paralegal salaries respond to market forces no less than the fees that clients pay suggests to us that this case has more to do with determining whose expenditures get reimbursed (the attorney's or the client's) than with determining how expenditures are calculated (at cost or at market). Since EAJA authorizes the recovery of fees and other expenses \"incurred by [the] party,\" § 504(a)(1), rather than the party's attorney, the answer to the former question is plain.</p>\n<p>[6]  Following our decision in <i>Casey,</i> Congress amended § 1988 to allow parties to recover \"expert fees as part of the attorney's fees.\" Civil Rights Act of 1991, § 113(a), 105 Stat. 1079 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1988(c)).</p>\n<p>[7]  The version of EAJA first enacted in 1980 had a sunset provision effective October 1, 1984. See §§ 203(c), 204(c), 94 Stat. 2327, 2329. Congress revived EAJA without the sunset provision (but with certain other amendments) in 1985. See Act of Aug. 5, 1985, §§ 1-2, 6, 99 Stat. 183-186; see also n. 8, <i>infra;</i> see generally <i>Scarborough v. Principi,</i> 541 U.S. 401, 406-407, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004) (summarizing EAJA's legislative history).</p>\n<p>[8]  Richlin makes a threshold challenge to the legitimacy of the 1984 Senate Report as legislative history, observing that the bill it accompanied was vetoed by the President before being enacted by a subsequent Congress. See Brief for Petitioner 27 (\"To the extent that legislative history serves as legitimate evidence of congressional intent, it does so only because it is presumed to have been ratified by Congress and the President when the relevant legislation was enacted\" (citing Siegel, The Use of Legislative History in a System of Separated Powers, 53 Vand. L.Rev. 1457, 1522 (2000); and <i>Sullivan v. Finkelstein,</i> 496 U.S. 617, 631-632, 110 S.Ct. 2658, 110 L.Ed.2d 563 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part))). But see <i>Melkonyan v. Sullivan,</i> 501 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 2157, 115 L.Ed.2d 78 (1991) (relying on the same Report to interpret EAJA's 1985 amendments). Because the legislative history is a wash in this case, we need not decide precisely how much weight it deserves in our analysis.</p>\n<p>[9]  Compare <i>Northcross,</i> 611 F.2d, at 638 (\"[A] scale of fees as is used by most law firms is appropriate to use in making fee awards pursuant to Section 1988.

In the early 1990's, it was engaged by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to provide guard services for detainees at Los Angeles International Airport. Through mutual mistake, the parties' two contracts misclassified Richlin's employees under the Service Contract Act of 1965, 41 U.S.C. § 351 <i>et seq.</i> The Department of Labor discovered the misclassification and ordered Richlin to pay its employees back wages. Richlin responded by filing a claim against the Government with the Department of Transportation's Board of Contract Appeals (Board). The claim sought reformation of the two contracts in order to force the Government to make additional payments necessary to cover Richlin's liability under the Service Contract Act. Richlin prevailed after extensive litigation, and the Board entered an award in its favor.</p>\n<p>Richlin then filed an application with the Board for reimbursement of its attorney's fees, expenses, and costs pursuant to EAJA. Under EAJA, \"[a]n agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award, to a prevailing party other than the United States, fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\" 5 U.S.C. § 504(a)(1). In addition to its other fees and expenses, Richlin sought $45,141.10 for 523.8 hours of paralegal work on its contract claim and $6,760 for 68.2 hours of paralegal work on the EAJA application itself.</p>\n<p>The Board granted Richlin's application in part. <i>Richlin Security Service Co. v.

It concluded, however, that Richlin was not entitled to recover its paralegal fees at the rates (ranging from $50 per hour to $95 per hour) at which Richlin was billed by its law firm.<sup>[1]</sup> See <i>id.,</i> at 39a. The Board held that EAJA limited recovery of paralegal fees to \"the cost to the firm rather than ... the billed rate.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Richlin had not submitted any evidence regarding the cost of the paralegal services to its law firm, see <i>ibid.,</i> but the Board found that \"$35 per hour is a reasonable cost to the firm[,] having taken judicial notice of paralegal salaries in the Washington D.C. area as reflected on the internet.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 42a-43a.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Federal Circuit affirmed. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"210903\"><a href=\"/opinion/210903/richlin-security-service-v-secretary-of-homeland-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1370</span></a></span>.

Since § 504(b)(1)(A) awards fees at \"prevailing market rates,\" a straightforward reading of the statute leads to the conclusion that Richlin was entitled to recover fees for the paralegal services it purchased at the market rate for such services.</p>\n<p>The Government resists this reading by distinguishing \"fees\" from \"other expenses.\" The Government concedes that \"fees\" are reimbursable at \"prevailing market rates,\" but it insists that \"other expenses\" (including expenses for \"any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project\") are reimbursable only at their \"reasonable cost.\" And in the Government's view, outlays for paralegal services are better characterized as \"other expenses\" than as \"fees.\" The Government observes that the second sentence of § 504(b)(1)(A), which explains how to calculate awards for \"fees,\" refers to attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, without mentioning paralegals. From this omission, the Government infers that Congress intended to treat expenditures for paralegal services not as \"fees\" but as \"other expenses,\" recoverable at \"reasonable cost.\"</p>\n<p>We find the Government's fractured interpretation of the statute unpersuasive. Contrary to the Government's contention, § 504(b)(1)(A) does not clearly distinguish between the rates at which \"fees\" and \"other expenses\" are reimbursed. Although the statute does refer to the \"reasonable cost\" of \"any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project,\" Congress may reasonably have believed that market rates would not exist for work product of that kind. At one point, Congress even appears to use the terms \"expenses\" and \"fees\" interchangeably: The first clause of § 504(b)(1)(A) refers to the \"reasonable expenses of expert witnesses,\" while the parenthetical characterizes expert compensation as \"fees.\" There is no indication that Congress, in using the term \"expenses\" in one place and \"fees\" in the other, was referring to two different components of expert remuneration.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2013</span> Even if the dichotomy that the Government draws between \"fees\" and \"other expenses\" were supported by the statutory text, it would hardly follow that amounts billed for paralegal services should be classified as \"expenses\" rather than as \"fees.\" The Government concludes that the omission of paralegal fees from § 504(b)(1)(A)'s parenthetical (which generally authorizes reimbursement at \"prevailing market rates\") implies that the recovery of paralegal fees is limited to cost. But one could just as easily conclude that the omission of paralegal fees from the litany of \"any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project\" (all of which are recoverable at \"reasonable cost\") implies that paralegal fees are recoverable at market rates. Surely paralegals are more analogous to attorneys, experts, and agents than to studies, analyses, reports, tests, and projects. Even the Government's brief, which incants the term \"paralegal expenses,\" <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondent 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, slips up once and refers to them as \"fees,\" see <i>id.,</i> at 35 (\"As the court of appeals explained, treating paralegal fees as attorney fees could `distort the normal allocation of work and result in a less efficient performance of legal services' under the EAJA...\").</p>\n<p>But even if we agreed that EAJA limited a prevailing party's recovery for paralegal fees to \"reasonable cost,\" it certainly would not follow that the cost should be measured from the perspective of the party's attorney.<sup>[4]</sup> To the contrary, it would be anomalous to measure cost from the perspective of the attorney rather than the client. We do not understand the Government to contend, for example, that the \"reasonable cost\" of an \"engineering report\" or \"analysis\" should be calculated from the perspective of the firm that employs the engineer or analyst. Such an interpretation would be tough to square with the statutory language. Section 504(a)(1) provides that an agency shall award to a prevailing party \"fees and other expenses <i>incurred by that party.</i>\" See also § 504(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added). That language leaves no doubt that Congress intended the \"reasonable cost\" of the specified items in § 504(b)(1)(A) to be calculated from the perspective of the litigant. That being the case, we find it hard to believe that Congress, without even mentioning paralegals, intended to make an exception of them by calculating their cost from the perspective of their employer rather than the litigant. It seems more plausible that Congress intended all \"fees and other expenses\" to be recoverable at the litigant's \"reasonable cost,\" subject to the proviso that \"reasonable cost\" would be deemed to be \"prevailing market rates\" when such rates could be determined.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2014</span> B</h2>\n<p>To the extent that some ambiguity subsists in the statutory text, we need not look far to resolve it, for we have already addressed a similar question with respect to another fee-shifting statute. In <i>Missouri v. Jenkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112299\"><a href=\"/opinion/112299/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989), we considered whether litigants could recover paralegal fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Section 1988 provides that \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" We concluded that the term \"attorney's fee\" in § 1988 \"cannot have been meant to compensate only work performed personally by members of the bar.\" 491 U.S., at 285, 109 S.Ct. 2463. Although separate billing for paralegals had become \"increasingly widespread,\" <i>id.,</i> at 286, 109 S.Ct. 2463 (internal quotation marks omitted), attorney's fees had traditionally subsumed both the attorney's personal labor and the labor of paralegals and other individuals who contributed to the attorney's work product, see <i>id.,</i> at 285, 109 S.Ct. 2463. We were so confident that Congress had given the term \"attorney's fees\" this traditional gloss that we declared it \"self-evident\" that the term embraced the fees of paralegals as well as attorneys. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We think <i>Jenkins</i> substantially answers the question before us. EAJA, like § 1988, entitles certain parties to recover \"reasonable attorney ... fees.\" 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A). EAJA, like § 1988, makes no mention of the paralegals, \"secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an attorney bills her client.\" <i>Jenkins, supra,</i> at 285, 109 S.Ct. 2463. And we think EAJA, like § 1988, must be interpreted as using the term \"attorney ... fees\" to reach fees for paralegal services as well as compensation for the attorney's personal labor. The Government does not contend that the meaning of the term \"attorney's fees\" changed so much between § 1988's enactment in 1976 and EAJA's enactment in 1980 that the term's meaning in one statute must be different from its meaning in the other. Under the reasoning of <i>Jenkins,</i> we take it as \"self-evident\" that when Congress instructed agencies to award \"attorney ... fees\" to certain parties prevailing against the Government, that term was intended to embrace paralegal fees as well. Since § 504 generally provides for recovery of attorney's fees at \"prevailing market rates,\" it follows that fees for paralegal services must be recoverable at prevailing market rates as well.</p>\n<p>The Government contends that our decision in <i>Jenkins</i> was driven by considerations arising from the different context in which the term \"attorney's fee\" was used in § 1988. At the time <i>Jenkins</i> was decided, § 1988 provided for the recovery of attorney's fees without reference to any other recoverable \"expenses.\" The Government insists that <i>Jenkins</i> found paralegal fees recoverable under the guise of \"attorney's fee[s]\" because otherwise paralegal fees would not be recoverable at all. Since EAJA expressly permits recovery (albeit at \"cost\") for items other than attorney, agent, and expert witness fees, the Government sees no reason to give EAJA the broad construction that <i>Jenkins</i> gave § 1988.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2015</span> The Government's rationale for distinguishing <i>Jenkins</i> finds no support either in our opinion there or in our subsequent decisions. Our opinion in <i>Jenkins</i> expressed no apprehension at the possibility that a contrary decision would leave the claimant emptyhanded. This omission is unsurprising, since our decision in <i>Jenkins</i> did not rest on the conviction that recovery at market rates was better than nothing. Our decision rested instead on the propositiona proposition we took as \"self-evident\"that the term \"attorney's fee\" had historically included fees for paralegal services.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Government's interpretation of <i>Jenkins</i> was rejected by this Court just two years after <i>Jenkins</i> was handed down. In <i>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112559\"><a href=\"/opinion/112559/west-virginia-univ-hospitals-inc-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68, the petitioner sought to recover expert witness fees from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pursuant to § 1988. The petitioner looked to <i>Jenkins</i> for the proposition that the \"broad remedial purposes\" of § 1988 allowed the recovery of fees not expressly authorized by statute. The Court rejected that interpretation of <i>Jenkins:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"The issue [in <i>Jenkins</i>] was not, as [petitioner] contends, whether we would permit our perception of the `policy' of the statute to overcome its `plain language.' It was not remotely plain in <i>Jenkins</i> that the phrase `attorney's fee' did not include charges for law clerk and paralegal services. Such services, like the services of `secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product,' had traditionally been included in calculation of the lawyers' hourly rates. Only recently had there arisen `the increasingly widespread custom of separately billing for [such] services.' By contrast, there has never been, to our knowledge, a practice of including the cost of expert services within attorneys' hourly rates. There was also no record in <i>Jenkins</i>as there is a lengthy record hereof statutory usage that recognizes a distinction between the charges at issue and attorney's fees.\" <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 99, 111 S.Ct. 1138 (quoting 491 U.S., at 285-286, 109 S.Ct. 2463) (some internal quotation marks and citations omitted).<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Our analysis of <i>Jenkins</i> in <i>Casey</i> refutes the Government's claim that <i>Jenkins</i> had to stretch the law to fit hard facts. As <i>Casey</i> shows, our decision in <i>Jenkins</i> turned not on extratextual policy goals but on the traditional meaning of the term \"attorney's fees.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Government parries this textual and doctrinal analysis with legislative history and public policy. We are not persuaded by either. The legislative history cited by the Government does not address the question presented, and policy considerations actually counsel in favor of Richlin's interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Government contends first that a 1984 Senate Report accompanying the bill that reenacted EAJA<sup>[7]</sup> unequivocally expressed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2016</span> congressional intent that paralegal fees should be recovered only <i>\"`at cost.'\"</i> Brief for Respondent 29 (quoting S. Rep., at 15; emphasis in original). It next contends that the Report tacitly endorsed the same result by approving model rules of the Administrative Conference of the United States and a pre-EAJA Sixth Circuit decision, both of which had adopted schemes of reimbursement at attorney cost. See Brief for Respondent 29. We are not persuaded. In our view, the legislative history does not even address the question presented, much less answer it in the Government's favor.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The Senate Report accompanying the 1984 bill remarked that \"[e]xamples of the type of expenses that should ordinarily be compensable [under EAJA] include paralegal time (billed at cost).\" S. Rep., at 15. The Government concludes from this stray remark that Congress intended to limit recovery of paralegal fees to attorney cost. But as we observed earlier, the word \"cost\" could just as easily (and more sensibly) refer to the client's cost rather than the attorney's cost. Under the former interpretation, the Senate Report simply indicates that a prevailing party who satisfies EAJA's other requirements should generally be able to \"bil[l]\" the Government for any reasonable amount the party paid for paralegal services. Since the litigant's out-of-pocket cost for paralegal services would normally be equal to the \"prevailing market rat[e]\" for such services, 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A), the Senate Report could easily support Richlin's interpretation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even if the Government's interpretation of the word \"cost\" is correct, that interpretation would not be inconsistent with our decision today. \"Nothing in [EAJA] requires that the work of paralegals invariably be billed separately. If it is the practice in the relevant market not to do so, or to bill the work of paralegals only at cost, that is all that [EAJA] requires.\" <i>Jenkins, supra,</i> at 288, 109 S.Ct. 2463 (construing 42 U.S.C. § 1988). We thus recognize the possibility, as we did in <i>Jenkins,</i> that the attorney's cost for paralegal services will supply the relevant metric for calculating the client's recovery. Whether that metric is appropriate depends on market practice. The Senate Report, even under the Government's contestable interpretation, is not inconsistent with that conclusion. On the contrary, the Report implies that courts should look to market practice in setting EAJA awards. See S. Rep., at 15 (\"The Act should not be read ... to permit reimbursement for items <i>ordinarily</i> included in office overhead, nor for any other expenses not reasonable in amount, necessary for the conduct of the litigation, <i>and customarily chargeable to clients</i>\" (emphasis added)). Beyond that vague guidance, the Report <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2017</span> does not address the critical question in this case: whether EAJA limits recovery of paralegal fees to attorney cost <i>regardless of market practice.</i> As such, the Report does not persuade us of the soundness of the Government's interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p>The Government's reliance on the Sixth Circuit's decision in <i>Northcross v. Board of Ed. of the Memphis City Schools,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></span> (1979), founders for the same reason. The Government contends that <i>Northcross</i> approved of reimbursement at attorney cost under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and that the 1984 Senate Report, by endorsing <i>Northcross,</i> tacitly approved of the same result for EAJA. See Brief for Respondent 30 (citing <i>Northcross, supra,</i> at 639). The problem again is that <i>Northcross</i> did not decide whether a litigant's recovery for paralegal services would be limited to his attorney's cost even in a market where litigants were customarily billed at \"prevailing market rates.\" Although the Sixth Circuit seems to have been aware that paralegal services could be billed to clients at market rates, some language in its opinion suggests that the court assumed that attorneys billed their clients only for the out-of-pocket cost of paralegal services.<sup>[9]</sup> Since <i>Northcross</i> does not clearly address the question presented, its endorsement in the Senate Report means little.</p>\n<p>Finally, the model rules cited in the Senate Report may actually support Richlin's position. The implementing release for the rules describes the Administrative Conference's approach to paralegal costs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Commenters also took varying positions on whether paralegal costs should be chargeable as expenses. We do not believe the rules should discourage the use of paralegals, which can be an important cost-saving measure. On the other hand, lawyers' practices with respect to charging for paralegal time, as with respect to other expenses such as duplicating, telephone charges and the like, vary according to locality, field of practice, and individual custom. We have decided not to designate specific items as compensable expenses. Instead, we will adopt a suggestion of the Treasury Department and revise the model rule to provide that expenses may be charged as a separate item if they are ordinarily so charged to the attorney's clients.\" Administrative Conference of the U.S., Equal Access to Justice Act: Agency Implementation, 46 Fed. Reg. 32905 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p>To the extent that this passage addresses the question presented at all, it seems to take the same approach that the Court took in <i>Jenkins</i> and that we adopt today: it allows the recovery of paralegal fees according to \"the practice in the relevant market.\" 491 U.S., at 288, 109 S.Ct. 2463. But we think the fairest interpretation of the implementing release is that it does not address how awards for paralegal fees should be calculated. Instead, it addresses the anterior question whether courts may award paralegal fees under EAJA at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2018</span> all. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 46 Fed.Reg. 32905 (responding to comments urging that the model rules \"identify particular expenses of attorneys and witnesses that are compensable\"). Like the other legislative authorities cited by the Government, the model rules fail to persuade us of the soundness of the Government's interpretation because they fail to clearly address the question presented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>We find the Government's policy rationale for recovery at attorney cost likewise unpersuasive. The Government argues that market-based recovery would distort litigant incentives because EAJA would cap paralegal and attorney's fees at the same rate. See 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A) (\"[A]ttorney or agent fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the agency determines by regulation that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee\"). The Government observes that paralegal rates are lower than rates for attorneys operating in the same market. If EAJA reimbursed both attorney time and paralegal time at market rates, then the cap would clip more off the top of the attorney's rates than the paralegal's rates. According to the Government, a market-based scheme would encourage litigants to shift an inefficient amount of attorney work to paralegals, since paralegal fees could be recovered at a greater percentage of their full market value.</p>\n<p>The problem with this argument, as Richlin points out, is that it proves too much. The same reasoning would imply that agent fees should not be recoverable at market rates.<sup>[10]</sup> If market-based recovery of paralegal time resulted in excessive reliance on paralegals, then market-based recovery of agent time should result in excessive reliance on agents. The same reasoning would also imply that fees for junior attorneys (who generally bill at lower rates than senior attorneys) should not be recoverable at market rates. Cf. <i>Jenkins, supra,</i> at 287, 109 S.Ct. 2463 (\"If the fees are consistent with market rates and practices, the `windfall' argument has no more force with regard to paralegals than it does for associates\"). Yet despite the possibility that market-based recovery of attorney and agent fees would distort litigant incentives, § 504 unambiguously authorizes awards of \"reasonable attorney or agent fees ... [at] prevailing market rates.\" 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A). The Government offers no persuasive reason why Congress would have treated paralegal fees any differently. The Government's policy rationale thus founders on the text of the statute, which shows that Congress was untroubled by the very distortion the Government seeks to prevent.</p>\n<p>We also question the practical feasibility of the Government's interpretation of the statute. The Board in this case relied on the Internet for data on paralegal salaries in the District of Columbia, but the Government fails to explain why a law firm's cost should be limited to salary. The benefits and perks with which a firm compensates its staff come out of the bottom line no less than salary. The Government has offered no solution to this accounting problem, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2019</span> and we do not believe that solutions are readily to be found. Market practice provides by far the more transparent basis for calculating a prevailing party's recovery under EAJA. It strains credulity that Congress would have abandoned this predictable, workable framework for the uncertain and complex accounting requirements that a cost-based rule would inflict on litigants, their attorneys, administrative agencies, and the courts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Confronted with the flaws in its interpretation of the statute, the Government seeks shelter in a canon of construction. According to the Government, any right to recover paralegal fees under EAJA must be read narrowly in light of the statutory canon requiring strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p>The sovereign immunity canon is just thata canon of construction. It is a tool for interpreting the law, and we have never held that it displaces the other traditional tools of statutory construction. Indeed, the cases on which the Government relies all used other tools of construction in tandem with the sovereign immunity canon. See <i>Ardestani v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112665\"><a href=\"/opinion/112665/ardestani-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 137, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991) (relying on the canon as \"reinforce[ment]\" for the independent \"conclusion that any ambiguities in the legislative history are insufficient to undercut the ordinary understanding of the statutory language\"); <i>Ruckelshaus v.

Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112724\"><a href=\"/opinion/112724/department-of-energy-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 626-627, 112 S.Ct. 1627, 118 L.Ed.2d 255 (1992) (resorting to the canon only after a close reading of the statutory provision had left the Court \"with an unanswered question and an unresolved tension between closely related statutory provisions\"); see also <i>Smith v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112827\"><a href=\"/opinion/112827/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 201-203, 113 S.Ct. 1178, 122 L.Ed.2d 548 (1993) (invoking the sovereign immunity canon only after observing that the claimant's argument was \"undermine[d]\" by the \"commonsense meaning\" of the statutory language). In this case, traditional tools of statutory construction and considerations of stare decisis compel the conclusion that paralegal fees are recoverable as attorney's fees at their \"prevailing market rates.\" 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A). There is no need for us to resort to the sovereign immunity canon because there is no ambiguity left for us to construe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we hold that a prevailing party that satisfies EAJA's other requirements may recover its paralegal fees from the Government at prevailing market rates. The Board's contrary decision was error, and the Federal Circuit erred in affirming that decision. The judgment of the Federal Circuit is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Justice SCALIA joins this opinion except as to Part III-A, and Justice THOMAS joins this opinion except as to Parts II-B and III.</p>\n<p>[1]  Richlin was actually billed for paralegal services at rates as high as $135 per hour, but it amended its application to cap the fees at $95 per hour. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a; Brief for Petitioner 9; Brief for Respondent 4, n. 2.</p>\n<p>[2]  Some agencies allow nonattorney representatives, known as \"agents,\" to assist parties with the presentation of their cases. See n. 10, <i>infra.</i> Richlin has never claimed that a paralegal may qualify as an \"agent\" within the meaning of § 504(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>[3]  Virtually identical fee-shifting provisions apply to actions by or against the Government in federal court. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2412(a)(1), (d)(2)(A). The question presented addresses both §§ 504 and 2412, but the Federal Circuit's decision resolved only petitioner's § 504 application, and the Government avers (without challenge from Richlin) that § 2412 \"is not at issue in this case.\" Brief for Respondent 2, n. 1. We assume without deciding that the reasoning of our opinion would extend equally to §§ 504 and 2412. We confine our discussion to § 504.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Government contends that the question presented does not fairly include the question whether the cost of paralegal services should be calculated from the perspective of the litigant rather than the litigant's attorney. We disagree. The question presented in Richlin's petition for certiorari was whether \"a prevailing party [may] be awarded attorney fees for paralegal services at the market rate for such services, ... [or at] cost only.\" Pet. for Cert. i. A decision limiting reimbursement to \"cost only\" would simply beg the question of how that cost should be measured. Since the question presented cannot genuinely be answered without addressing the subsidiary question, we have no difficulty concluding that the latter question is \"fairly included\" within the former. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a).</p>\n<p>[5]  It is worth recalling that the Board calculated Richlin's award based on an Internet survey of paralegal salaries in the District of Columbia. Presumably the salaries the Board identified represented the market rate for paralegal compensation. The limited award that the Government wants affirmed was thus based, ironically enough, on the \"prevailing market rates\" for paralegal services. The fact that paralegal salaries respond to market forces no less than the fees that clients pay suggests to us that this case has more to do with determining whose expenditures get reimbursed (the attorney's or the client's) than with determining how expenditures are calculated (at cost or at market). Since EAJA authorizes the recovery of fees and other expenses \"incurred by [the] party,\" § 504(a)(1), rather than the party's attorney, the answer to the former question is plain.</p>\n<p>[6]  Following our decision in <i>Casey,</i> Congress amended § 1988 to allow parties to recover \"expert fees as part of the attorney's fees.\" Civil Rights Act of 1991, § 113(a), 105 Stat. 1079 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1988(c)).</p>\n<p>[7]  The version of EAJA first enacted in 1980 had a sunset provision effective October 1, 1984. See §§ 203(c), 204(c), 94 Stat. 2327, 2329. Congress revived EAJA without the sunset provision (but with certain other amendments) in 1985. See Act of Aug. 5, 1985, §§ 1-2, 6, 99 Stat. 183-186; see also n. 8, <i>infra;</i> see generally <i>Scarborough v.

See Brief for Petitioner 27 (\"To the extent that legislative history serves as legitimate evidence of congressional intent, it does so only because it is presumed to have been ratified by Congress and the President when the relevant legislation was enacted\" (citing Siegel, The Use of Legislative History in a System of Separated Powers, 53 Vand.

Argued March 19, 2008—Decided June 2, 2008\nAfter prevailing against the Government on a claim originating in the\n  Department of Transportation’s Board of Contract Appeals, peti-\n  tioner (Richlin) filed an application with the Board for reimburse-\n  ment of attorney’s fees, expenses, and costs, pursuant to the Equal\n  Access to Justice Act (EAJA). The Board concluded, inter alia, that\n  Richlin was not entitled to recover paralegal fees at the rates at\n  which it was billed by its law firm, holding that EAJA limited such\n  recovery to the attorney’s cost, which was lower than the billed rate.\n  In affirming, the Federal Circuit concluded that the term “fees,” for\n  which EAJA authorizes recovery at “prevailing market rates,” em-\n  braces only the fees of attorneys, experts, and agents.\nHeld: A prevailing party that satisfies EAJA’s other requirements may\n recover its paralegal fees from the Government at prevailing market\n rates. Pp. 4–18.\n    (a) EAJA permits a prevailing party to recover “fees and other ex-\n penses incurred by that party in connection with” administrative pro-\n ceedings, 5 U. S. C. §504(a)(1), including “the reasonable expenses of\n expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engi-\n neering report, test, or project . . . , and reasonable attorney or agent\n fees,” and bases the amount of such fees on “prevailing market rates,”\n §504(b)(1)(A). Because Richlin “incurred” “fees” for paralegal services\n in connection with its action before the Board, a straightforward\n reading of the statute demonstrates that Richlin was entitled to re-\n cover fees for the paralegal services it purchased at the market rate\n for such services. The Government’s contrary reading—that expendi-\n tures for paralegal services are “other expenses” recoverable only at\n “reasonable cost”—is unpersuasive. Section 504(b)(1)(A) does not\n2          RICHLIN SECURITY SERVICE CO. v. CHERTOFF\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    clearly distinguish between the rates at which “fees” and “other ex-\n    penses” are reimbursed. Even if the statutory text supported the\n    Government’s dichotomy, it would hardly follow that amounts billed\n    for paralegal services should be classified as “expenses” rather than\n    as “fees.” Paralegals are surely more analogous to attorneys, experts,\n    and agents than to studies, analyses, reports, tests, and projects.\n    Even if the Court agreed that EAJA limited paralegal fees to “rea-\n    sonable cost,” it would not follow that the cost should be measured\n    from the perspective of the party’s attorney rather than the client.\n    By providing that an agency shall award a prevailing party “fees and\n    other expenses . . . incurred by that party” (emphasis added),\n    §504(a)(1) leaves no doubt that Congress intended the “reasonable\n    cost” of §504(b)(1)(A)’s items to be calculated from the litigant’s per-\n    spective. It is unlikely that Congress, without even mentioning para-\n    legals, intended to make an exception of them by calculating their\n    cost from their employer’s perspective. It seems more plausible that\n    Congress intended all “fees and other expenses” to be recoverable at\n    the litigant’s “reasonable cost,” subject to the proviso that “reasonable\n    cost” would be deemed to be “prevailing market rates” when such\n    rates could be determined. Pp. 4–8.\n       (b) To the extent that some ambiguity subsists in the statutory\n    text, this Court need look no further to resolve it than Missouri v.\n    Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, where the Court addressed a similar question\n    with respect to the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976—\n    which provides that a court “may allow the prevailing party . . . a\n    reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs,” 42 U. S. C. §1988—\n    finding it “self-evident” that “attorney’s fee” embraced the fees of\n    paralegals as well as attorneys, 491 U. S., at 285. EAJA, like §1988,\n    entitles certain parties to recover “reasonable attorney . . . fees,”\n    §504(b)(1)(A), and makes no mention of the paralegals, “secretaries,\n    messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes\n    to the work product for which an attorney bills her client,” 491 U. S.,\n    at 285. Thus, EAJA, like §1988, must be interpreted as using the\n    term “attorney . . . fees” to reach fees for paralegal services as well as\n    compensation for the attorney’s personal labor, making “self-evident”\n    that Congress intended that term to embrace paralegal fees. Since\n    §504 generally provides for recovery of attorney’s fees at “prevailing\n    market rates,” it follows that paralegal fees must also be recoverable\n    at those rates. The Government’s contention that Jenkins found\n    paralegal fees recoverable as “attorney’s fee[s]” because §1988 au-\n    thorized no other recoverable “expenses” finds no support in Jenkins\n    itself, which turned not on extratextual policy goals, but on the “self-\n    evident” proposition that “attorney’s fee[s]” had historically included\n    paralegal fees.

The Department of Labor discovered\nthe misclassification and ordered Richlin to pay its em-\nployees back wages. Richlin responded by filing a claim\nagainst the Government with the Department of Trans-\nportation’s Board of Contract Appeals (Board). The claim\nsought reformation of the two contracts in order to force\nthe Government to make additional payments necessary\nto cover Richlin’s liability under the Service Contract Act.\nRichlin prevailed after extensive litigation, and the Board\nentered an award in its favor.\n   Richlin then filed an application with the Board for\nreimbursement of its attorney’s fees, expenses, and costs\npursuant to EAJA. Under EAJA, “[a]n agency that con-\nducts an adversary adjudication shall award, to a prevail-\ning party other than the United States, fees and other\nexpenses incurred by that party in connection with that\nproceeding, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency\nfinds that the position of the agency was substantially\njustified or that special circumstances make an award\nunjust.” 5 U. S. C. §504(a)(1). In addition to its other fees\nand expenses, Richlin sought $45,141.10 for 523.8 hours of\nparalegal work on its contract claim and $6,760 for\n68.2 hours of paralegal work on the EAJA application\nitself.\n   The Board granted Richlin’s application in part.

It found that Richlin met\n§504(b)(1)(B)’s eligibility requirements, see id., at 30a, and\nthat the Government’s position had not been “substan-\ntially justified” within the meaning of §504(a)(1), id., at\n32a. It concluded, however, that Richlin was not entitled\nto recover its paralegal fees at the rates (ranging from\n$50 per hour to $95 per hour) at which Richlin was billed\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

The Board held that\nEAJA limited recovery of paralegal fees to “the cost to the\nfirm rather than . . . the billed rate.” Ibid. Richlin had not\nsubmitted any evidence regarding the cost of the paralegal\nservices to its law firm, see ibid., but the Board found that\n“$35 per hour is a reasonable cost to the firm[,] having\ntaken judicial notice of paralegal salaries in the Washing-\nton D. C. area as reflected on the internet.” Id., at 42a–\n43a.\n    A divided panel of the Federal Circuit affirmed. 472\nF. 3d 1370. The court construed the term “fees,” for which\nEAJA authorizes recovery at “prevailing market rates,”\n§504(b)(1)(A), as embracing only the fees of attorneys,\nexperts, and agents.2 See id., at 1374. The court declined\nto follow the contrary decision of the Eleventh Circuit in\nJean v. Nelson, 863 F. 2d 759 (1988), aff’d sub nom. Com-\nmissioner v. Jean, 496 U. S. 154 (1990). It also distin-\nguished this Court’s decisions in Missouri v. Jenkins, 491\nU. S. 274 (1989), and West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v.\nCasey, 499 U. S. 83 (1991), reasoning that those cases\ninvolved a different fee-shifting statute with different\n“ ‘goals and objectives.’ ” 472 F. 3d, at 1375–1377, 1379\n(discussing the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of\n1976, 42 U. S. C. §1988). The court instead found support\nfor its interpretation in EAJA’s legislative history, see 472\nF. 3d, at 1381 (citing S. Rep. No. 98–586 (1984) (hereinaf-\nter S.

From this omission, the\nGovernment infers that Congress intended to treat expen-\nditures for paralegal services not as “fees” but as “other\nexpenses,” recoverable at “reasonable cost.”\n   We find the Government’s fractured interpretation of\n——————\n  3 Virtuallyidentical fee-shifting provisions apply to actions by or\nagainst the Government in federal court. See 28 U. S. C. §§2412(a)(1),\n(d)(2)(A). The question presented addresses both §§504 and 2412, but\nthe Federal Circuit’s decision resolved only petitioner’s §504 applica-\ntion, and the Government avers (without challenge from Richlin) that\n§2412 “is not at issue in this case.” Brief for Respondent 2, n. 1. We\nassume without deciding that the reasoning of our opinion would\nextend equally to §§504 and 2412. We confine our discussion to §504.\n6       RICHLIN SECURITY SERVICE CO. v. CHERTOFF\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statute unpersuasive. Contrary to the Government’s\ncontention, §504(b)(1)(A) does not clearly distinguish\nbetween the rates at which “fees” and “other expenses” are\nreimbursed. Although the statute does refer to the “rea-\nsonable cost” of “any study, analysis, engineering report,\ntest, or project,” Congress may reasonably have believed\nthat market rates would not exist for work product of that\nkind. At one point, Congress even appears to use the\nterms “expenses” and “fees” interchangeably: The first\nclause of §504(b)(1)(A) refers to the “reasonable expenses\nof expert witnesses,” while the parenthetical characterizes\nexpert compensation as “fees.” There is no indication that\nCongress, in using the term “expenses” in one place and\n“fees” in the other, was referring to two different compo-\nnents of expert remuneration.\n   Even if the dichotomy that the Government draws\nbetween “fees” and “other expenses” were supported by the\nstatutory text, it would hardly follow that amounts billed\nfor paralegal services should be classified as “expenses”\nrather than as “fees.” The Government concludes that the\nomission of paralegal fees from §504(b)(1)(A)’s parentheti-\ncal (which generally authorizes reimbursement at “pre-\nvailing market rates”) implies that the recovery of parale-\ngal fees is limited to cost. But one could just as easily\nconclude that the omission of paralegal fees from the\nlitany of “any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or\nproject” (all of which are recoverable at “reasonable cost”)\nimplies that paralegal fees are recoverable at market\nrates. Surely paralegals are more analogous to attorneys,\nexperts, and agents than to studies, analyses, reports,\ntests, and projects. Even the Government’s brief, which\nincants the term “paralegal expenses,” e.g., Brief for Re-\nspondent 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, slips up once and refers\nto them as “fees,” see id., at 35 (“As the court of appeals\nexplained, treating paralegal fees as attorney fees could\n‘distort the normal allocation of work and result in a less\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

We do\nnot understand the Government to contend, for example,\nthat the “reasonable cost” of an “engineering report” or\n“analysis” should be calculated from the perspective of the\nfirm that employs the engineer or analyst. Such an inter-\npretation would be tough to square with the statutory\nlanguage. Section 504(a)(1) provides that an agency shall\naward to a prevailing party “fees and other expenses\nincurred by that party.” See also §504(b)(1)(A) (emphasis\nadded). That language leaves no doubt that Congress\nintended the “reasonable cost” of the specified items in\n§504(b)(1)(A) to be calculated from the perspective of the\nlitigant. That being the case, we find it hard to believe\nthat Congress, without even mentioning paralegals, in-\ntended to make an exception of them by calculating their\ncost from the perspective of their employer rather than the\nlitigant. It seems more plausible that Congress intended\nall “fees and other expenses” to be recoverable at the\n——————\n   4 The Government contends that the question presented does not\n\nfairly include the question whether the cost of paralegal services should\nbe calculated from the perspective of the litigant rather than the\nlitigant’s attorney. We disagree. The question presented in Richlin’s\npetition for certiorari was whether “a prevailing party [may] be\nawarded attorney fees for paralegal services at the market rate for such\nservices, . . . [or at] cost only.” Pet. for Cert. i. A decision limiting\nreimbursement to “cost only” would simply beg the question of how that\ncost should be measured. Since the question presented cannot genu-\ninely be answered without addressing the subsidiary question, we have\nno difficulty concluding that the latter question is “fairly included”\nwithin the former. See this Court’s Rule 14.1(a).\n8        RICHLIN SECURITY SERVICE CO. v. CHERTOFF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlitigant’s “reasonable cost,” subject to the proviso that\n“reasonable cost” would be deemed to be “prevailing\nmarket rates” when such rates could be determined.5\n                               B\n  To the extent that some ambiguity subsists in the statu-\ntory text, we need not look far to resolve it, for we have\nalready addressed a similar question with respect to an-\nother fee-shifting statute. In Missouri v. Jenkins, 491\nU. S. 274 (1989), we considered whether litigants could\nrecover paralegal fees under the Civil Rights Attorney’s\nFees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U. S. C. §1988. Section 1988\nprovides that “the court, in its discretion, may allow the\nprevailing party, other than the United States, a reason-\nable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.” We concluded that\nthe term “attorney’s fee” in §1988 “cannot have been\nmeant to compensate only work performed personally by\nmembers of the bar.” 491 U. S., at 285. Although sepa-\nrate billing for paralegals had become “increasingly wide-\nspread,” id., at 286 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nattorney’s fees had traditionally subsumed both the attor-\nney’s personal labor and the labor of paralegals and other\nindividuals who contributed to the attorney’s work prod-\nuct, see id., at 285. We were so confident that Congress\n\n——————\n  5 It is worth recalling that the Board calculated Richlin’s award based\n\non an Internet survey of paralegal salaries in the District of Columbia.\nPresumably the salaries the Board identified represented the market\nrate for paralegal compensation. The limited award that the Govern-\nment wants affirmed was thus based, ironically enough, on the “pre-\nvailing market rates” for paralegal services. The fact that paralegal\nsalaries respond to market forces no less than the fees that clients pay\nsuggests to us that this case has more to do with determining whose\nexpenditures get reimbursed (the attorney’s or the client’s) than with\ndetermining how expenditures are calculated (at cost or at market).\nSince EAJA authorizes the recovery of fees and other expenses “in-\ncurred by [the] party,” §504(a)(1), rather than the party’s attorney, the\nanswer to the former question is plain.\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhad given the term “attorney’s fees” this traditional gloss\nthat we declared it “self-evident” that the term embraced\nthe fees of paralegals as well as attorneys. Ibid.\n  We think Jenkins substantially answers the question\nbefore us. EAJA, like §1988, entitles certain parties to\nrecover “reasonable attorney . . . fees.”          5 U. S. C.\n§504(b)(1)(A). EAJA, like §1988, makes no mention of the\nparalegals, “secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors,\nand others whose labor contributes to the work product for\nwhich an attorney bills her client.” Jenkins, supra, at 285.\nAnd we think EAJA, like §1988, must be interpreted as\nusing the term “attorney . . . fees” to reach fees for parale-\ngal services as well as compensation for the attorney’s\npersonal labor. The Government does not contend that\nthe meaning of the term “attorney’s fees” changed so much\nbetween §1988’s enactment in 1976 and EAJA’s enact-\nment in 1980 that the term’s meaning in one statute must\nbe different from its meaning in the other. Under the\nreasoning of Jenkins, we take it as “self-evident” that\nwhen Congress instructed agencies to award “attorney . . .\nfees” to certain parties prevailing against the Government,\nthat term was intended to embrace paralegal fees as well.\nSince §504 generally provides for recovery of attorney’s\nfees at “prevailing market rates,” it follows that fees for\nparalegal services must be recoverable at prevailing mar-\nket rates as well.\n  The Government contends that our decision in Jenkins\nwas driven by considerations arising from the different\ncontext in which the term “attorney’s fee” was used in\n§1988. At the time Jenkins was decided, §1988 provided\nfor the recovery of attorney’s fees without reference to any\nother recoverable “expenses.” The Government insists\nthat Jenkins found paralegal fees recoverable under the\nguise of “attorney’s fee[s]” because otherwise paralegal\nfees would not be recoverable at all. Since EAJA expressly\npermits recovery (albeit at “cost”) for items other than\n10      RICHLIN SECURITY SERVICE CO. v. CHERTOFF\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nattorney, agent, and expert witness fees, the Government\nsees no reason to give EAJA the broad construction that\nJenkins gave §1988.\n   The Government’s rationale for distinguishing Jenkins\nfinds no support either in our opinion there or in our\nsubsequent decisions. Our opinion in Jenkins expressed\nno apprehension at the possibility that a contrary decision\nwould leave the claimant emptyhanded. This omission is\nunsurprising, since our decision in Jenkins did not rest on\nthe conviction that recovery at market rates was better\nthan nothing. Our decision rested instead on the proposi-\ntion—a proposition we took as “self-evident”—that the\nterm “attorney’s fee” had historically included fees for\nparalegal services.\n   Indeed, the Government’s interpretation of Jenkins was\nrejected by this Court just two years after Jenkins was\nhanded down. In West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v.\nCasey, 499 U. S. 83, the petitioner sought to recover expert\nwitness fees from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\npursuant to §1988. The petitioner looked to Jenkins for\nthe proposition that the “broad remedial purposes” of\n§1988 allowed the recovery of fees not expressly author-\nized by statute. The Court rejected that interpretation of\nJenkins:\n     “The issue [in Jenkins] was not, as [petitioner] con-\n     tends, whether we would permit our perception of the\n     ‘policy’ of the statute to overcome its ‘plain language.’\n     It was not remotely plain in Jenkins that the phrase\n     ‘attorney’s fee’ did not include charges for law clerk\n     and paralegal services. Such services, like the ser-\n     vices of ‘secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors,\n     and others whose labor contributes to the work prod-\n     uct,’ had traditionally been included in calculation of\n     the lawyers’ hourly rates. Only recently had there\n     arisen ‘the increasingly widespread custom of sepa-\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     rately billing for [such] services.’ By contrast, there\n     has never been, to our knowledge, a practice of includ-\n     ing the cost of expert services within attorneys’ hourly\n     rates. There was also no record in Jenkins—as there\n     is a lengthy record here—of statutory usage that rec-\n     ognizes a distinction between the charges at issue and\n     attorney’s fees.” Casey, supra, at 99 (quoting 491\n     U.

We are\nnot persuaded by either. The legislative history cited by\nthe Government does not address the question presented,\nand policy considerations actually counsel in favor of\nRichlin’s interpretation.\n                           A\n  The Government contends first that a 1984 Senate\nReport accompanying the bill that reenacted EAJA7 un-\nequivocally expressed congressional intent that paralegal\n——————\n   6 Following our decision in Casey, Congress amended §1988 to allow\n\nparties to recover “expert fees as part of the attorney’s fees.” Civil\nRights Act of 1991, §113(a), 105 Stat. 1079 (codified at 42 U. S. C.\n§1988(c)).\n   7 The version of EAJA first enacted in 1980 had a sunset provision\n\neffective October 1, 1984. See §§203(c), 204(c), 94 Stat. 2327, 2329.\nCongress revived EAJA without the sunset provision (but with certain\nother amendments) in 1985. See Act of Aug. 5, 1985, §§1–2, 6, 99 Stat.\n183–186; see also n. 8, infra; see generally Scarborough v. Principi, 541\nU.

CHERTOFF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfees should be recovered only “ ‘at cost.’ ” Brief for Respon-\ndent 29 (quoting S. Rep., at 15; emphasis in original). It\nnext contends that the Report tacitly endorsed the same\nresult by approving model rules of the Administrative\nConference of the United States and a pre-EAJA Sixth\nCircuit decision, both of which had adopted schemes of\nreimbursement at attorney cost. See Brief for Respondent\n29. We are not persuaded. In our view, the legislative\nhistory does not even address the question presented,\nmuch less answer it in the Government’s favor.8\n  The Senate Report accompanying the 1984 bill re-\nmarked that “[e]xamples of the type of expenses that\nshould ordinarily be compensable [under EAJA] include\nparalegal time (billed at cost).” S. Rep., at 15. The Gov-\nernment concludes from this stray remark that Congress\nintended to limit recovery of paralegal fees to attorney\ncost. But as we observed earlier, the word “cost” could just\nas easily (and more sensibly) refer to the client’s cost\nrather than the attorney’s cost. Under the former inter-\npretation, the Senate Report simply indicates that a pre-\nvailing party who satisfies EAJA’s other requirements\nshould generally be able to “bil[l]” the Government for any\nreasonable amount the party paid for paralegal services.\n——————\n  8 Richlinmakes a threshold challenge to the legitimacy of the 1984\nSenate Report as legislative history, observing that the bill it accompa-\nnied was vetoed by the President before being enacted by a subsequent\nCongress. See Brief for Petitioner 27 (“To the extent that legislative\nhistory serves as legitimate evidence of congressional intent, it does so\nonly because it is presumed to have been ratified by Congress and the\nPresident when the relevant legislation was enacted” (citing Siegel, The\nUse of Legislative History in a System of Separated Powers, 53 Vand.\nL. Rev. 1457, 1522 (2000); and Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617,\n631–632 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part))). But see Melkonyan v.\nSullivan, 501 U. S. 89, 96 (1991) (relying on the same Report to inter-\npret EAJA’s 1985 amendments). Because the legislative history is a\nwash in this case, we need not decide precisely how much weight it\ndeserves in our analysis.\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSince the litigant’s out-of-pocket cost for paralegal services\nwould normally be equal to the “prevailing market rat[e]”\nfor such services, 5 U. S. C. §504(b)(1)(A), the Senate\nReport could easily support Richlin’s interpretation.\n   Moreover, even if the Government’s interpretation of\nthe word “cost” is correct, that interpretation would not be\ninconsistent with our decision today. “Nothing in [EAJA]\nrequires that the work of paralegals invariably be billed\nseparately. If it is the practice in the relevant market not\nto do so, or to bill the work of paralegals only at cost, that\nis all that [EAJA] requires.” Jenkins, supra, at 288 (con-\nstruing 42 U. S. C. §1988). We thus recognize the possi-\nbility, as we did in Jenkins, that the attorney’s cost for\nparalegal services will supply the relevant metric for\ncalculating the client’s recovery. Whether that metric is\nappropriate depends on market practice. The Senate\nReport, even under the Government’s contestable inter-\npretation, is not inconsistent with that conclusion. On\nthe contrary, the Report implies that courts should look to\nmarket practice in setting EAJA awards. See S. Rep., at\n15 (“The Act should not be read . . . to permit reimburse-\nment for items ordinarily included in office overhead, nor\nfor any other expenses not reasonable in amount, neces-\nsary for the conduct of the litigation, and customarily\nchargeable to clients” (emphasis added)). Beyond that\nvague guidance, the Report does not address the critical\nquestion in this case: whether EAJA limits recovery of\nparalegal fees to attorney cost regardless of market prac-\ntice. As such, the Report does not persuade us of the\nsoundness of the Government’s interpretation of the\nstatute.\n   The Government’s reliance on the Sixth Circuit’s deci-\nsion in Northcross v. Board of Ed. of the Memphis City\nSchools, 611 F. 2d 624 (1979), founders for the same rea-\nson. The Government contends that Northcross approved\nof reimbursement at attorney cost under 42 U. S. C. §1988\n14       RICHLIN SECURITY SERVICE CO. v. CHERTOFF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand that the 1984 Senate Report, by endorsing Northcross,\ntacitly approved of the same result for EAJA. See Brief for\nRespondent 30 (citing Northcross, supra, at 639). The\nproblem again is that Northcross did not decide whether a\nlitigant’s recovery for paralegal services would be limited\nto his attorney’s cost even in a market where litigants\nwere customarily billed at “prevailing market rates.”\nAlthough the Sixth Circuit seems to have been aware that\nparalegal services could be billed to clients at market\nrates, some language in its opinion suggests that the court\nassumed that attorneys billed their clients only for the\nout-of-pocket cost of paralegal services.9 Since Northcross\ndoes not clearly address the question presented, its en-\ndorsement in the Senate Report means little.\n   Finally, the model rules cited in the Senate Report may\nactually support Richlin’s position. The implementing\nrelease for the rules describes the Administrative Confer-\nence’s approach to paralegal costs as follows:\n     “Commenters also took varying positions on whether\n     paralegal costs should be chargeable as expenses. We\n     do not believe the rules should discourage the use of\n     paralegals, which can be an important cost-saving\n     measure. On the other hand, lawyers’ practices with\n     respect to charging for paralegal time, as with respect\n     to other expenses such as duplicating, telephone\n——————\n  9 Compare Northcross, 611 F. 2d, at 638 (“[A] scale of fees as is used\n\nby most law firms is appropriate to use in making fee awards pursuant\nto Section 1988. The use of broad categories, differentiating between\nparalegal services, in-office services by experienced attorneys and trial\nservice, would result in a fair and equitable fee”) with id., at 639 (“The\nauthority granted in section 1988 to award a reasonable attorney’s fee\nincluded the authority to award those reasonable out-of-pocket ex-\npenses incurred by the attorney which are normally charged to a fee-\npaying client, in the course of providing legal services.

S., Equal Access\n    to Justice Act: Agency Implementation, 46 Fed. Reg.\n    32905 (1981).\nTo the extent that this passage addresses the question\npresented at all, it seems to take the same approach that\nthe Court took in Jenkins and that we adopt today: it\nallows the recovery of paralegal fees according to “the\npractice in the relevant market.” 491 U. S., at 288. But\nwe think the fairest interpretation of the implementing\nrelease is that it does not address how awards for parale-\ngal fees should be calculated. Instead, it addresses the\nanterior question whether courts may award paralegal\nfees under EAJA at all. See, e.g., 46 Fed. Reg. 32905\n(responding to comments urging that the model rules\n“identify particular expenses of attorneys and witnesses\nthat are compensable”). Like the other legislative authori-\nties cited by the Government, the model rules fail to per-\nsuade us of the soundness of the Government’s interpreta-\ntion because they fail to clearly address the question\npresented.\n                             B\n   We find the Government’s policy rationale for recovery\nat attorney cost likewise unpersuasive. The Government\nargues that market-based recovery would distort litigant\nincentives because EAJA would cap paralegal and attor-\nney’s fees at the same rate. See 5 U. S. C. §504(b)(1)(A)\n(“[A]ttorney or agent fees shall not be awarded in excess of\n$125 per hour unless the agency determines by regulation\n16           RICHLIN SECURITY SERVICE CO. v. CHERTOFF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat an increase in the cost of living or a special factor,\nsuch as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or\nagents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher\nfee”). The Government observes that paralegal rates are\nlower than rates for attorneys operating in the same mar-\nket. If EAJA reimbursed both attorney time and paralegal\ntime at market rates, then the cap would clip more off the\ntop of the attorney’s rates than the paralegal’s rates.\nAccording to the Government, a market-based scheme\nwould encourage litigants to shift an inefficient amount of\nattorney work to paralegals, since paralegal fees could be\nrecovered at a greater percentage of their full market\nvalue.\n  The problem with this argument, as Richlin points out,\nis that it proves too much. The same reasoning would\nimply that agent fees should not be recoverable at market\nrates.10 If market-based recovery of paralegal time re-\nsulted in excessive reliance on paralegals, then market-\nbased recovery of agent time should result in excessive\nreliance on agents. The same reasoning would also imply\nthat fees for junior attorneys (who generally bill at lower\nrates than senior attorneys) should not be recoverable at\nmarket rates. Cf. Jenkins, supra, at 287 (“If the fees are\nconsistent with market rates and practices, the ‘windfall’\nargument has no more force with regard to paralegals\nthan it does for associates”). Yet despite the possibility\nthat market-based recovery of attorney and agent fees\nwould distort litigant incentives, §504 unambiguously\n——————\n  10 “ ‘An “agent fee” may be awarded for the services of a non-attorney\nwhere an agency permits such agents to represent parties who come\nbefore it.’ ” Brief for Respondent at 11, n. 4 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 96–\n1418, p. 14 (1980)); see also n. 2, supra. Since federal courts generally\ndo not permit nonattorneys to practice before them, the portion of\nEAJA governing awards for parties to federal litigation makes no\nprovision for agent fees. Compare 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)(2)(A) with 5\nU. S. C. §504(b)(1)(A).\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nauthorizes awards of “reasonable attorney or agent fees\n. . . [at] prevailing market rates.” 5 U. S. C. §504(b)(1)(A).\nThe Government offers no persuasive reason why Con-\ngress would have treated paralegal fees any differently.\nThe Government’s policy rationale thus founders on the\ntext of the statute, which shows that Congress was un-\ntroubled by the very distortion the Government seeks to\nprevent.\n    We also question the practical feasibility of the Govern-\nment’s interpretation of the statute. The Board in this\ncase relied on the Internet for data on paralegal salaries in\nthe District of Columbia, but the Government fails to\nexplain why a law firm’s cost should be limited to salary.\nThe benefits and perks with which a firm compensates its\nstaff come out of the bottom line no less than salary. The\nGovernment has offered no solution to this accounting\nproblem, and we do not believe that solutions are readily\nto be found. Market practice provides by far the more\ntransparent basis for calculating a prevailing party’s\nrecovery under EAJA. It strains credulity that Congress\nwould have abandoned this predictable, workable frame-\nwork for the uncertain and complex accounting require-\nments that a cost-based rule would inflict on litigants,\ntheir attorneys, administrative agencies, and the courts.\n                              IV\n   Confronted with the flaws in its interpretation of the\nstatute, the Government seeks shelter in a canon of con-\nstruction. According to the Government, any right to\nrecover paralegal fees under EAJA must be read narrowly\nin light of the statutory canon requiring strict construction\nof waivers of sovereign immunity. We disagree.\n   The sovereign immunity canon is just that—a canon of\nconstruction. It is a tool for interpreting the law, and we\nhave never held that it displaces the other traditional tools\nof statutory construction. Indeed, the cases on which the\n18      RICHLIN SECURITY SERVICE CO. v. CHERTOFF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGovernment relies all used other tools of construction in\ntandem with the sovereign immunity canon. See Arde-\nstani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 137 (1991) (relying on the\ncanon as “reinforce[ment]” for the independent “conclusion\nthat any ambiguities in the legislative history are insuffi-\ncient to undercut the ordinary understanding of the statu-\ntory language”); Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S.\n680, 682, 685–686 (1983) (relying on the canon in tandem\nwith “historic principles of fee-shifting in this and other\ncountries” to define the scope of a fee-shifting statute);\nDepartment of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U. S. 607, 626–627\n(1992) (resorting to the canon only after a close reading of\nthe statutory provision had left the Court “with an unan-\nswered question and an unresolved tension between\nclosely related statutory provisions”); see also Smith v.\nUnited States, 507 U. S. 197, 201–203 (1993) (invoking the\nsovereign immunity canon only after observing that the\nclaimant’s argument was “undermine[d]” by the “common-\nsense meaning” of the statutory language). In this case,\ntraditional tools of statutory construction and considera-\ntions of stare decisis compel the conclusion that paralegal\nfees are recoverable as attorney’s fees at their “prevailing\nmarket rates.” 5 U. S. C. §504(b)(1)(A). There is no need\nfor us to resort to the sovereign immunity canon because\nthere is no ambiguity left for us to construe.\n                            V\n  For these reasons, we hold that a prevailing party that\nsatisfies EAJA’s other requirements may recover its para-\nlegal fees from the Government at prevailing market\nrates. The Board’s contrary decision was error, and the\nFederal Circuit erred in affirming that decision. The\njudgment of the Federal Circuit is reversed, and this case\nis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145802/", "sha1": "26f81c24567ca0b19acb1872b1c6df39f2f13732", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2007-046", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:02"}
