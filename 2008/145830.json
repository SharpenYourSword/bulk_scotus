Schleimer, Counsel of Record, Kenneth D. Freundlich, Schleimer &amp; Freundlich, LLP, Beverly Hills, CA, for Petitioner.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>As this Court recognized in <i>Southland Corp. v. Keating,</i> 465 U.S. 1, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984), the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U.S.C. ยง 1 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), establishes a national policy favoring arbitration when the parties contract for that mode of dispute resolution. The Act, which rests on Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause, supplies not simply a procedural framework applicable in federal courts; it also calls for the application, in state as well as federal courts, of federal substantive law regarding arbitration. 465 U.S., at 16, 104 S.Ct. 852. More recently, in <i>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna,</i> 546 U.S. 440, 126 S.Ct. 1204, 163 L.Ed.2d 1038 (2006), the Court clarified that, when parties agree to arbitrate all disputes arising under their contract, questions concerning the validity of the entire contract are to be resolved by the arbitrator in the first instance, not by a federal or state court.</p>\n<p>The instant petition presents the following question: Does the FAA override not only state statutes that refer certain state-law controversies initially to a judicial forum, but also state statutes that refer certain disputes initially to an administrative agency? We hold today that, when parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative, are superseded by the FAA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>This case concerns a contract between respondent Alex E. Ferrer, a former Florida trial court judge who currently appears as \"Judge Alex\" on a Fox television network <span class=\"star-pagination\">*982</span> program, and petitioner Arnold M. Preston, a California attorney who renders services to persons in the entertainment industry. Seeking fees allegedly due under the contract, Preston invoked the parties' agreement to arbitrate \"any dispute... relating to the terms of [the contract] or the breach, validity, or legality thereof... in accordance with the rules [of the American Arbitration Association].\" App. 18.</p>\n<p>Preston's demand for arbitration, made in June 2005, was countered a month later by Ferrer's petition to the California Labor Commissioner charging that the contract was invalid and unenforceable under the California Talent Agencies Act (TAA), Cal. Lab.Code Ann. ยง 1700 <i>et seq.</i> (West 2003 and Supp.2008). Ferrer asserted that Preston acted as a talent agent without the license required by the TAA, and that Preston's unlicensed status rendered the entire contract void.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The Labor Commissioner's hearing officer, in November 2005, determined that Ferrer had stated a \"colorable basis for exercise of the Labor Commissioner's jurisdiction.\" App. 33. The officer denied Ferrer's motion to stay the arbitration, however, on the ground that the Labor Commissioner lacked authority to order such relief. Ferrer then filed suit in the Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking a declaration that the controversy between the parties \"arising from the [c]ontract, including in particular the issue of the validity of the [c]ontract, is not subject to arbitration.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 29. As interim relief, Ferrer sought an injunction restraining Preston from proceeding before the arbitrator. Preston responded by moving to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p>In December 2005, the Superior Court denied Preston's motion to compel arbitration and enjoined Preston from proceeding before the arbitrator \"unless and until the Labor Commissioner determines that ... she is without jurisdiction over the disputes between Preston and Ferrer.\" No. BC342454 (Dec. 7, 2005), App. C to Pet. for Cert. 18a, 26a-27a. During the pendency of Preston's appeal from the Superior Court's decision, this Court reaffirmed, in <i>Buckeye,</i> that challenges to the validity of a contract providing for arbitration ordinarily \"should ... be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.\" 546 U.S., at 446, 126 S.Ct. 1204.</p>\n<p>In a 2-to-1 decision issued in November 2006, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court's judgment. The appeals court held that the relevant provision of the TAA, Cal. Lab.Code Ann. ยง 1700.44(a) (West 2003), vests \"exclusive original jurisdiction\" over the dispute in the Labor Commissioner. 145 Cal.App.4th 440, 447, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d 628, 634. <i>Buckeye</i> is \"inapposite,\" the court said, because that case \"did not involve an administrative agency with exclusive jurisdiction over a disputed issue.\" 145 Cal.App.4th, at 447, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d, at 634. The dissenting judge, in contrast, viewed <i>Buckeye</i> as controlling; she reasoned that the FAA called for immediate recognition and enforcement of the parties' agreement to arbitrate and afforded no basis for distinguishing prior resort to a state administrative agency from prior resort to a state court. 145 Cal.App.4th, at 450-451, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d, at 636-637 (Vogel, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The California Supreme Court denied Preston's petition for review. No. S149190 (Feb. 14, 2007), 2007 Cal. LEXIS 1539, App. A to Pet. for Cert. 1a. We granted certiorari to determine whether the FAA overrides a state law vesting initial adjudicatory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*983</span> authority in an administrative agency. 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 31, 168 L.Ed.2d 807 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>An easily stated question underlies this controversy. Ferrer claims that Preston was a talent agent who operated without a license in violation of the TAA. Accordingly, he urges, the contract between the parties, purportedly for \"personal management,\" is void and Preston is entitled to no compensation for any services he rendered. Preston, on the other hand, maintains that he acted as a personal manager, not as a talent agent, hence his contract with Ferrer is not governed by the TAA and is both lawful and fully binding on the parties.</p>\n<p>Because the contract between Ferrer and Preston provides that \"any dispute... relating to the ... validity, or legality\" of the agreement \"shall be submitted to arbitration,\" App. 18, Preston urges that Ferrer must litigate \"his TAA defense in the arbitral forum,\" Reply Brief 31. Ferrer insists, however, that the \"personal manager\" or \"talent agent\" inquiry falls, under California law, within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner, and that the FAA does not displace the Commissioner's primary jurisdiction. Brief for Respondent 14, 30, 40-44.</p>\n<p>The dispositive issue, then, contrary to Ferrer's suggestion, is not whether the FAA preempts the TAA wholesale. See <i>id.,</i> at 44-48. The FAA plainly has no such destructive aim or effect. Instead, the question is simply who decides whether Preston acted as personal manager or as talent agent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Section 2 of the FAA states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A written provision in any ... contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\" 9 U.S.C. ยง 2.</blockquote>\n<p>Section 2 \"declare[s] a national policy favoring arbitration\" of claims that parties contract to settle in that manner. <i>Southland Corp.,</i> 465 U.S., at 10, 104 S.Ct. 852. That national policy, we held in <i>Southland,</i> \"appli[es] in state as well as federal courts\" and \"foreclose[s] state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 16, 104 S.Ct. 852. The FAA's displacement of conflicting state law is \"now well-established,\" <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,</i> 513 U.S. 265, 272, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995), and has been repeatedly reaffirmed, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Buckeye,</i> 546 U.S., at 445-446, 126 S.Ct. 1204; <i>Doctor's Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto,</i> 517 U.S. 681, 684-685, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902 (1996); <i>Perry v. Thomas,</i> 482 U.S. 483, 489, 107 S.Ct. 2520, 96 L.Ed.2d 426 (1987).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>A recurring question under ยง 2 is who should decide whether \"grounds ... exist at law or in equity\" to invalidate an arbitration agreement. In <i>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,</i> 388 U.S. 395, 403-404, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*984</span> (1967), we held that attacks on the validity of an entire contract, as distinct from attacks aimed at the arbitration clause, are within the arbitrator's ken.</p>\n<p>The litigation in <i>Prima Paint</i> originated in federal court, but the same rule, we held in <i>Buckeye,</i> applies in state court. 546 U.S., at 447-448, 126 S.Ct. 1204. The plaintiffs in <i>Buckeye</i> alleged that the contracts they signed, which contained arbitration clauses, were illegal under state law and void <i>ab initio. Id.,</i> at 443, 126 S.Ct. 1204. Relying on <i>Southland,</i> we held that the plaintiffs' challenge was within the province of the arbitrator to decide. See 546 U.S., at 446, 126 S.Ct. 1204.</p>\n<p><i>Buckeye</i> largely, if not entirely, resolves the dispute before us. The contract between Preston and Ferrer clearly \"evidenc[ed] a transaction involving commerce,\" 9 U.S.C. ยง 2, and Ferrer has never disputed that the written arbitration provision in the contract falls within the purview of ยง 2. Moreover, Ferrer sought invalidation of the contract as a whole. In the proceedings below, he made no discrete challenge to the validity of the arbitration clause. See 145 Cal.App.4th, at 449, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d, at 635 (Vogel, J., dissenting).<sup>[3]</sup> Ferrer thus urged the Labor Commissioner and California courts to override the contract's arbitration clause on a ground that <i>Buckeye</i> requires the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Ferrer attempts to distinguish <i>Buckeye</i> by arguing that the TAA merely requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before the parties proceed to arbitration. We reject that argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The TAA regulates talent agents and talent agency agreements. \"Talent agency\" is defined, with exceptions not relevant here, as \"a person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment or engagements for an artist or artists.\" Cal. Lab.Code Ann. ยง 1700.4(a) (West 2003). The definition \"does not cover other services for which artists often contract, such as personal and career management (i.e., advice, direction, coordination, and oversight with respect to an artist's career or personal or financial affairs).\" <i>Styne v. Stevens,</i> 26 Cal.4th 42, 51, 109 Cal.Rptr.2d 14, 26 P.3d 343, 349 (2001) (emphasis deleted). The TAA requires talent agents to procure a license from the Labor Commissioner. ยง 1700.5. \"In furtherance of the [TAA's] protective aims, an unlicensed person's contract with an artist to provide the services of a talent agency is illegal and void.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 51, 109 Cal.Rptr.2d 14, 26 P.3d, at 349.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*985</span> Section 1700.44(a) of the TAA states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In cases of controversy arising under this chapter, the parties involved shall refer the matters in dispute to the Labor Commissioner, who shall hear and determine the same, subject to an appeal within 10 days after determination, to the superior court where the same shall be heard de novo.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Absent a notice of appeal filed within ten days, the Labor Commissioner's determination becomes final and binding on the parties. <i>REO Broadcasting Consultants v. Martin,</i> 69 Cal.App.4th 489, 495, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 639, 642-643 (1999).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The TAA permits arbitration in lieu of proceeding before the Labor Commissioner if an arbitration provision \"in a contract between a talent agency and [an artist]\" both \"provides for reasonable notice to the Labor Commissioner of the time and place of all arbitration hearings\" and gives the Commissioner \"the right to attend all arbitration hearings.\" ยง 1700.45. This prescription demonstrates that there is no inherent conflict between the TAA and arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. But ยง 1700.45 was of no utility to Preston. He has consistently maintained that he is <i>not</i> a talent agent as that term is defined in ยง 1700.4(a), but is, instead, a personal manager not subject to the TAA's regulatory regime. 145 Cal.App.4th, at 444, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d, at 631. To invoke ยง 1700.45, Preston would have been required to concede a point fatal to his claim for compensationย<i>i.e.,</i> that he is a talent agent, albeit an unlicensed oneยand to have drafted his contract in compliance with a statute that he maintains is inapplicable.</p>\n<p>Procedural prescriptions of the TAA thus conflict with the FAA's dispute resolution regime in two basic respects: First, the TAA, in ยง 1700.44(a), grants the Labor Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide an issue that the parties agreed to arbitrate, see <i>Buckeye,</i> 546 U.S., at 446, 126 S.Ct. 1204; second, the TAA, in ยง 1700.45, imposes prerequisites to enforcement of an arbitration agreement that are not applicable to contracts generally, see <i>Doctor's Associates, Inc.,</i> 517 U.S., at 687, 116 S.Ct. 1652.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Ferrer contends that the TAA is nevertheless compatible with the FAA because ยง 1700.44(a) merely postpones arbitration until after the Labor Commissioner has exercised her primary jurisdiction. Brief for Respondent 14, 40. The party that loses before the Labor Commissioner may file for <i>de novo</i> review in Superior Court. See ยง 1700.44(a). At that point, Ferrer asserts, either party could move to compel arbitration under Cal.Civ.Proc.Code Ann. ยง 1281.2 (West 2007), and thereby obtain an arbitrator's determination prior to judicial review. See Brief for Respondent 13.</p>\n<p>That is not the position Ferrer took in the California courts. In his complaint, he urged the Superior Court to declare that \"the [c]ontract, including in particular the issue of the validity of the [c]ontract, <i>is not subject to arbitration,</i>\" and he sought an injunction stopping arbitration \"unless and until, <i>if ever,</i> the Labor Commissioner determines that he/she has no jurisdiction over the parties' dispute.\" App. 29 (emphasis added). Ferrer also told the Superior Court: \"[I]f ... the Commissioner rules that the [c]ontract is void, Preston may appeal that ruling and have a hearing de novo <i>before this Court.</i>\" Appellant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*986</span> App. in No. B188997 (Cal.App.), p. 157, n. 1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Nor does Ferrer's current argumentย that ยง 1700.44(a) merely postpones arbitrationยwithstand examination. Section 1700.44(a) provides for <i>de novo</i> review in Superior Court, not elsewhere.<sup>[6]</sup> Arbitration, if it ever occurred following the Labor Commissioner's decision, would likely be long delayed, in contravention of Congress' intent \"to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.\" <i>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> 460 U.S. 1, 22, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). If Ferrer prevailed in the California courts, moreover, he would no doubt argue that judicial findings of fact and conclusions of law, made after a full and fair <i>de novo</i> hearing in court, are binding on the parties and preclude the arbitrator from making any contrary rulings.</p>\n<p>A prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve \"streamlined proceedings and expeditious results.\" <i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,</i> 473 U.S. 614, 633, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). See also <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.,</i> 513 U.S., at 278; <i>Southland Corp.,</i> 465 U.S., at 7, 104 S.Ct. 852. That objective would be frustrated even if Preston could compel arbitration in lieu of <i>de novo</i> Superior Court review. Requiring initial reference of the parties' dispute to the Labor Commissioner would, at the least, hinder speedy resolution of the controversy.</p>\n<p>Ferrer asks us to overlook the apparent conflict between the arbitration clause and ยง 1700.44(a) because proceedings before the Labor Commissioner are administrative rather than judicial. Brief for Respondent 40-48. Allowing parties to proceed directly to arbitration, Ferrer contends, would undermine the Labor Commissioner's ability to stay informed of potentially illegal activity, <i>id.,</i> at 43, and would deprive artists protected by the TAA of the Labor Commissioner's expertise, <i>id.,</i> at 41-43.</p>\n<p>In <i>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,</i> 500 U.S. 20, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991), we considered and rejected a similar argument, namely, that arbitration of age discrimination claims would undermine the role of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in enforcing federal law. The \"mere involvement of an administrative agency in the enforcement of a statute,\" we held, does not limit private parties' obligation to comply with their arbitration agreements. <i>Id.,</i> at 28-29, 111 S.Ct. 1647.</p>\n<p>Ferrer points to our holding in <i>EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc.,</i> 534 U.S. 279, 293-294, 122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755 (2002), that an arbitration agreement signed by an employee who becomes a discrimination complainant does not bar the EEOC from filing an enforcement suit in its own name. He further emphasizes our observation in <i>Gilmer</i> that individuals who agreed to arbitrate their discrimination claims would \"still be free to file a charge with the EEOC.\" 500 U.S., at 28, 111 S.Ct. 1647. Consistent with these decisions, Ferrer argues, the arbitration clause in his contract <span class=\"star-pagination\">*987</span> with Preston leaves undisturbed the Labor Commissioner's independent authority to enforce the TAA. See Brief for Respondent 44-48. And so it may.<sup>[7]</sup> But in proceedings under ยง 1700.44(a), the Labor Commissioner functions not as an advocate advancing a cause before a tribunal authorized to find the facts and apply the law; instead, the Commissioner serves as impartial arbiter. That role is just what the FAA-governed agreement between Ferrer and Preston reserves for the arbitrator. In contrast, in <i>Waffle House</i> and in the <i>Gilmer</i> aside Ferrer quotes, the Court addressed the role of an agency, not as adjudicator but as prosecutor, pursuing an enforcement action in its own name or reviewing a discrimination charge to determine whether to initiate judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p>Finally, it bears repeating that Preston's petition presents precisely and only a question concerning the forum in which the parties' dispute will be heard. See <i>supra,</i> at 983. \"By agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral ... forum.\" <i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.,</i> 473 U.S., at 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346. So here, Ferrer relinquishes no substantive rights the TAA or other California law may accord him. But under the contract he signed, he cannot escape resolution of those rights in an arbitral forum.</p>\n<p>In sum, we disapprove the distinction between judicial and administrative proceedings drawn by Ferrer and adopted by the appeals court. When parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, the FAA supersedes state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Ferrer's final attempt to distinguish <i>Buckeye</i> relies on <i>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,</i> 489 U.S. 468, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989). <i>Volt</i> involved a California statute dealing with cases in which \"[a] party to [an] arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action ... [involving] a third party [not bound by the arbitration agreement], arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions.\" Cal.Civ.Proc. Code Ann. ยง 1281.2(c) (West 2007). To avoid the \"possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact,\" the statute gives the Superior Court authority, <i>inter alia,</i> to stay the court proceeding \"pending the outcome of the arbitration\" or to stay the arbitration \"pending the outcome of the court action.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Volt Information Sciences and Stanford University were parties to a construction contract containing an arbitration clause. When a dispute arose and Volt demanded arbitration, Stanford sued Volt and two other companies involved in the construction project. Those other companies were not parties to the arbitration agreement; Stanford sought indemnification from them in the event that Volt prevailed against Stanford. At Stanford's request, the Superior Court stayed the arbitration. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the stay order. Volt and Stanford incorporated ยง 1281.2(c) into their agreement, the appeals court held. They did so by stipulating that the contractยotherwise silent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*988</span> on the priority of suits drawing in parties not subject to arbitrationยwould be governed by California law. <i>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ. v. Volt Information Sciences, Inc.,</i> 240 Cal. Rptr. 558, 561 (1987) (officially depublished). Relying on the Court of Appeal's interpretation of the contract, we held that the FAA did not bar a stay of arbitration pending the resolution of Stanford's Superior Court suit against Volt and the two companies not bound by the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>Preston and Ferrer's contract also contains a choice-of-law clause, which states that the \"agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California.\" App. 17. A separate saving clause provides: \"If there is any conflict between this agreement and any present or future law,\" the law prevails over the contract \"to the extent necessary to bring [the contract] within the requirements of said law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18. Those contractual terms, according to Ferrer, call for the application of California procedural law, including ยง 1700.44(a)'s grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Labor Commissioner.</p>\n<p>Ferrer's reliance on <i>Volt</i> is misplaced for two discrete reasons. First, arbitration was stayed in <i>Volt</i> to accommodate litigation involving third parties who were strangers to the arbitration agreement. Nothing in the arbitration agreement addressed the order of proceedings when pending litigation with third parties presented the prospect of inconsistent rulings. We thought it proper, in those circumstances, to recognize state law as the gap filler.</p>\n<p>Here, in contrast, the arbitration clause speaks to the matter in controversy; it states that \"any dispute ... relating to... the breach, validity, or legality\" of the contract should be arbitrated in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules. App. 18. Both parties are bound by the arbitration agreement; the question of Preston's status as a talent agent relates to the validity or legality of the contract; there is no risk that related litigation will yield conflicting rulings on common issues; and there is no other procedural void for the choice-of-law clause to fill.</p>\n<p>Second, we are guided by our more recent decision in <i>Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,</i> 514 U.S. 52, 115 S.Ct. 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 76 (1995). Although the contract in <i>Volt</i> provided for \"arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association,\" 489 U.S., at 470, n. 1, 109 S.Ct. 1248 (internal quotation marks omitted), Volt never argued that incorporation of those rules trumped the choice-of-law clause contained in the contract, see Brief for Appellant, and Reply Brief, in <i>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of</i><i> Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,</i> O.T.1987, No. 87-1318. Therefore, neither our decision in <i>Volt</i> nor the decision of the California appeals court in that case addressed the import of the contract's incorporation by reference of privately promulgated arbitration rules.</p>\n<p>In <i>Mastrobuono,</i> we reached that open question while interpreting a contract with both a New York choice-of-law clause and a clause providing for arbitration in accordance with the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). 514 U.S., at 58-59, 115 S.Ct. 1212.<sup>[8]</sup> The \"best <span class=\"star-pagination\">*989</span> way to harmonize\" the two clauses, we held, was to read the choice-of-law clause \"to encompass substantive principles that New York courts would apply, but not to include [New York's] special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 63-64, 115 S.Ct. 1212.</p>\n<p>Preston and Ferrer's contract, as noted, provides for arbitration in accordance with the AAA rules. App. 18. One of those rules states that \"[t]he arbitrator shall have the power to determine the existence or validity of a contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part.\" AAA, Commercial Arbitration Rules ยถ R-7(b) (2007), online at http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id= 22440 (as visited Feb. 15, 2008, and in Clerk of Court's case file). The incorporation of the AAA rules, and in particular Rule 7(b), weighs against inferring from the choice-of-law clause an understanding shared by Ferrer and Preston that their disputes would be heard, in the first instance, by the Labor Commissioner. Following the guide <i>Mastrobuono</i> provides, the \"best way to harmonize\" the parties' adoption of the AAA rules and their selection of California law is to read the latter to encompass prescriptions governing the substantive rights and obligations of the parties, but not the State's \"special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.\" 514 U.S., at 63-64, 115 S.Ct. 1212.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the California Court of Appeal is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As I have stated on many previous occasions, I believe that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. ยง 1 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), does not apply to proceedings in state courts. See <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,</i> 513 U.S. 265, 285-297, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see also <i>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna,</i> 546 U.S. 440, 449, 126 S.Ct. 1204, 163 L.Ed.2d 1038 (2006) (same); <i>Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle,</i> 539 U.S. 444, 460, 123 S.Ct. 2402, 156 L.Ed.2d 414 (2003) (same); <i>Doctor's Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto,</i> 517 U.S. 681, 689, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902 (1996) (same). Thus, in state-court proceedings, the FAA cannot displace a state law that delays arbitration until administrative proceedings are completed. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The TAA uses the term \"talent agency\" to describe both corporations and individual talent agents. We use the terms \"talent agent\" and \"talent agency\" interchangeably.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although Ferrer urges us to overrule <i>Southland,</i> he relies on the same arguments we considered and rejected in <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,</i> 513 U.S. 265, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995).

Adhering to precedent, we do not take up Ferrer's invitation to overrule <i>Southland.</i></p>\n<p>[3]  Ferrer's petition to the Labor Commissioner sought a declaration that the contract \"is void under the [TAA].\" App. 23. His complaint in Superior Court seeking to enjoin arbitration asserted: \"[T]he [c]ontract is void by reason of [Preston's] attempt to procure employment for [Ferrer] in violation of the [TAA],\" and \"the [c]ontract's arbitration clause does not vest authority in an arbitrator to determine whether the contract is void.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 27. His brief in the appeals court stated: \"Ferrer does not contend that the arbitration clause in the [c]ontract was procured by fraud. Ferrer contends that Preston unlawfully acted as an unlicensed talent agent and hence cannot enforce the [c]ontract.\" Brief for Respondent in No. B188997, p. 18.</p>\n<p>[4]  Courts \"may void the entire contract\" where talent agency services regulated by the TAA are \"inseparable from [unregulated] managerial services.\" <i>Marathon Entertainment, Inc. v. Blasi,</i> 174 P.3d 741, 744 (2008). If the contractual terms are severable, however, \"an isolated instance\" of unlicensed conduct \"does not automatically bar recovery for services that could lawfully be provided without a license.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  To appeal the Labor Commissioner's decision, an aggrieved party must post a bond of at least $1,000 and up to twice the amount of any judgment approved by the Commissioner. ยง 1700.44(a).</p>\n<p>[6]  From Superior Court an appeal lies in the Court of Appeal. Cal. Civ. Proc. Ann. ยง 904.1(a) (West 2007); Cal. Rule of Court 8.100(a) (Appellate Rules) (West 2007 rev. ed.). Thereafter, the losing party may seek review in the California Supreme Court, Rule 8.500(a)(1) (Appellate Rules), perhaps followed by a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1257. Ferrer has not identified a single case holding that California law permits interruption of this chain of appeals to allow the arbitrator to review the Labor Commissioner's decision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.</p>\n<p>[7]  Enforcement of the parties' arbitration agreement in this case does not displace any independent authority the Labor Commissioner may have to investigate and rectify violations of the TAA. See Brief for Respondent 47 (\"[T]he Commissioner has independent investigatory authority and may receive information concerning alleged violations of the TAA from any source.\" (citation omitted)). See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14.</p>\n<p>[8]  The question in <i>Mastrobuono</i> was whether the arbitrator could award punitive damages. See <i>Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,</i> 514 U.S. 52, 53-54, 115 S.Ct. 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 76 (1995). New York law prohibited arbitrators, but not courts, from awarding such damages. <i>Id.,</i> at 55, 115 S.Ct. 1212. The NASD rules, in contrast, authorized \"damages and other relief,\" which, according to a NASD arbitration manual, included punitive damages. <i>Id.,</i> at 61, 115 S.Ct. 1212 (internal quotation marks omitted). Relying on <i>Volt,</i> respondents argued that the choice-of-law clause incorporated into the parties' arbitration agreement New York's ban on arbitral awards of punitive damages. Opposing that argument, petitioners successfully urged that the agreement to arbitrate in accordance with the NASD rules controlled.</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>128 S.Ct. 978 (2008)</b></center>\n<center><h1>Arnold M.

The Act, which rests on Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause, supplies not simply a procedural framework applicable in federal courts; it also calls for the application, in state as well as federal courts, of federal substantive law regarding arbitration. 465 U.S., at 16, 104 S.Ct. 852. More recently, in <i>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.

We hold today that, when parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative, are superseded by the FAA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>This case concerns a contract between respondent Alex E. Ferrer, a former Florida trial court judge who currently appears as \"Judge Alex\" on a Fox television network <span class=\"star-pagination\">*982</span> program, and petitioner Arnold M. Preston, a California attorney who renders services to persons in the entertainment industry. Seeking fees allegedly due under the contract, Preston invoked the parties' agreement to arbitrate \"any dispute... relating to the terms of [the contract] or the breach, validity, or legality thereof... in accordance with the rules [of the American Arbitration Association].\" App. 18.</p>\n<p>Preston's demand for arbitration, made in June 2005, was countered a month later by Ferrer's petition to the California Labor Commissioner charging that the contract was invalid and unenforceable under the California Talent Agencies Act (TAA), Cal. Lab.Code Ann. ยง 1700 <i>et seq.</i> (West 2003 and Supp.2008). Ferrer asserted that Preston acted as a talent agent without the license required by the TAA, and that Preston's unlicensed status rendered the entire contract void.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The Labor Commissioner's hearing officer, in November 2005, determined that Ferrer had stated a \"colorable basis for exercise of the Labor Commissioner's jurisdiction.\" App. 33. The officer denied Ferrer's motion to stay the arbitration, however, on the ground that the Labor Commissioner lacked authority to order such relief. Ferrer then filed suit in the Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking a declaration that the controversy between the parties \"arising from the [c]ontract, including in particular the issue of the validity of the [c]ontract, is not subject to arbitration.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 29. As interim relief, Ferrer sought an injunction restraining Preston from proceeding before the arbitrator. Preston responded by moving to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p>In December 2005, the Superior Court denied Preston's motion to compel arbitration and enjoined Preston from proceeding before the arbitrator \"unless and until the Labor Commissioner determines that ... she is without jurisdiction over the disputes between Preston and Ferrer.\" No. BC342454 (Dec. 7, 2005), App. C to Pet. for Cert. 18a, 26a-27a. During the pendency of Preston's appeal from the Superior Court's decision, this Court reaffirmed, in <i>Buckeye,</i> that challenges to the validity of a contract providing for arbitration ordinarily \"should ... be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.\" 546 U.S., at 446, 126 S.Ct. 1204.</p>\n<p>In a 2-to-1 decision issued in November 2006, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court's judgment. The appeals court held that the relevant provision of the TAA, Cal. Lab.Code Ann. ยง 1700.44(a) (West 2003), vests \"exclusive original jurisdiction\" over the dispute in the Labor Commissioner. 145 Cal.App.4th 440, 447, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d 628, 634. <i>Buckeye</i> is \"inapposite,\" the court said, because that case \"did not involve an administrative agency with exclusive jurisdiction over a disputed issue.\" 145 Cal.App.4th, at 447, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d, at 634. The dissenting judge, in contrast, viewed <i>Buckeye</i> as controlling; she reasoned that the FAA called for immediate recognition and enforcement of the parties' agreement to arbitrate and afforded no basis for distinguishing prior resort to a state administrative agency from prior resort to a state court. 145 Cal.App.4th, at 450-451, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d, at 636-637 (Vogel, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The California Supreme Court denied Preston's petition for review. No. S149190 (Feb. 14, 2007), 2007 Cal. LEXIS 1539, App. A to Pet. for Cert. 1a. We granted certiorari to determine whether the FAA overrides a state law vesting initial adjudicatory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*983</span> authority in an administrative agency. 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 31, 168 L.Ed.2d 807 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>An easily stated question underlies this controversy. Ferrer claims that Preston was a talent agent who operated without a license in violation of the TAA. Accordingly, he urges, the contract between the parties, purportedly for \"personal management,\" is void and Preston is entitled to no compensation for any services he rendered. Preston, on the other hand, maintains that he acted as a personal manager, not as a talent agent, hence his contract with Ferrer is not governed by the TAA and is both lawful and fully binding on the parties.</p>\n<p>Because the contract between Ferrer and Preston provides that \"any dispute... relating to the ... validity, or legality\" of the agreement \"shall be submitted to arbitration,\" App. 18, Preston urges that Ferrer must litigate \"his TAA defense in the arbitral forum,\" Reply Brief 31. Ferrer insists, however, that the \"personal manager\" or \"talent agent\" inquiry falls, under California law, within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner, and that the FAA does not displace the Commissioner's primary jurisdiction. Brief for Respondent 14, 30, 40-44.</p>\n<p>The dispositive issue, then, contrary to Ferrer's suggestion, is not whether the FAA preempts the TAA wholesale. See <i>id.,</i> at 44-48. The FAA plainly has no such destructive aim or effect. Instead, the question is simply who decides whether Preston acted as personal manager or as talent agent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Section 2 of the FAA states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A written provision in any ... contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\" 9 U.S.C. ยง 2.</blockquote>\n<p>Section 2 \"declare[s] a national policy favoring arbitration\" of claims that parties contract to settle in that manner. <i>Southland Corp.,</i> 465 U.S., at 10, 104 S.Ct. 852. That national policy, we held in <i>Southland,</i> \"appli[es] in state as well as federal courts\" and \"foreclose[s] state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 16, 104 S.Ct. 852.

The plaintiffs in <i>Buckeye</i> alleged that the contracts they signed, which contained arbitration clauses, were illegal under state law and void <i>ab initio. Id.,</i> at 443, 126 S.Ct. 1204. Relying on <i>Southland,</i> we held that the plaintiffs' challenge was within the province of the arbitrator to decide. See 546 U.S., at 446, 126 S.Ct. 1204.</p>\n<p><i>Buckeye</i> largely, if not entirely, resolves the dispute before us. The contract between Preston and Ferrer clearly \"evidenc[ed] a transaction involving commerce,\" 9 U.S.C. ยง 2, and Ferrer has never disputed that the written arbitration provision in the contract falls within the purview of ยง 2. Moreover, Ferrer sought invalidation of the contract as a whole. In the proceedings below, he made no discrete challenge to the validity of the arbitration clause. See 145 Cal.App.4th, at 449, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d, at 635 (Vogel, J., dissenting).<sup>[3]</sup> Ferrer thus urged the Labor Commissioner and California courts to override the contract's arbitration clause on a ground that <i>Buckeye</i> requires the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Ferrer attempts to distinguish <i>Buckeye</i> by arguing that the TAA merely requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before the parties proceed to arbitration. We reject that argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The TAA regulates talent agents and talent agency agreements. \"Talent agency\" is defined, with exceptions not relevant here, as \"a person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment or engagements for an artist or artists.\" Cal. Lab.Code Ann. ยง 1700.4(a) (West 2003). The definition \"does not cover other services for which artists often contract, such as personal and career management (i.e., advice, direction, coordination, and oversight with respect to an artist's career or personal or financial affairs).\" <i>Styne v. Stevens,</i> 26 Cal.4th 42, 51, 109 Cal.Rptr.2d 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621124\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621124/styne-v-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 349 (2001) (emphasis deleted). The TAA requires talent agents to procure a license from the Labor Commissioner. ยง 1700.5. \"In furtherance of the [TAA's] protective aims, an unlicensed person's contract with an artist to provide the services of a talent agency is illegal and void.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 51, 109 Cal.Rptr.2d 14, 26 P.3d, at 349.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*985</span> Section 1700.44(a) of the TAA states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In cases of controversy arising under this chapter, the parties involved shall refer the matters in dispute to the Labor Commissioner, who shall hear and determine the same, subject to an appeal within 10 days after determination, to the superior court where the same shall be heard de novo.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Absent a notice of appeal filed within ten days, the Labor Commissioner's determination becomes final and binding on the parties. <i>REO Broadcasting Consultants v. Martin,</i> 69 Cal.App.4th 489, 495, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 639, 642-643 (1999).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The TAA permits arbitration in lieu of proceeding before the Labor Commissioner if an arbitration provision \"in a contract between a talent agency and [an artist]\" both \"provides for reasonable notice to the Labor Commissioner of the time and place of all arbitration hearings\" and gives the Commissioner \"the right to attend all arbitration hearings.\" ยง 1700.45. This prescription demonstrates that there is no inherent conflict between the TAA and arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. But ยง 1700.45 was of no utility to Preston. He has consistently maintained that he is <i>not</i> a talent agent as that term is defined in ยง 1700.4(a), but is, instead, a personal manager not subject to the TAA's regulatory regime. 145 Cal.App.4th, at 444, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d, at 631. To invoke ยง 1700.45, Preston would have been required to concede a point fatal to his claim for compensationย<i>i.e.,</i> that he is a talent agent, albeit an unlicensed oneยand to have drafted his contract in compliance with a statute that he maintains is inapplicable.</p>\n<p>Procedural prescriptions of the TAA thus conflict with the FAA's dispute resolution regime in two basic respects: First, the TAA, in ยง 1700.44(a), grants the Labor Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide an issue that the parties agreed to arbitrate, see <i>Buckeye,</i> 546 U.S., at 446, 126 S.Ct. 1204; second, the TAA, in ยง 1700.45, imposes prerequisites to enforcement of an arbitration agreement that are not applicable to contracts generally, see <i>Doctor's Associates, Inc.,</i> 517 U.S., at 687, 116 S.Ct. 1652.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Ferrer contends that the TAA is nevertheless compatible with the FAA because ยง 1700.44(a) merely postpones arbitration until after the Labor Commissioner has exercised her primary jurisdiction. Brief for Respondent 14, 40. The party that loses before the Labor Commissioner may file for <i>de novo</i> review in Superior Court. See ยง 1700.44(a). At that point, Ferrer asserts, either party could move to compel arbitration under Cal.Civ.Proc.Code Ann. ยง 1281.2 (West 2007), and thereby obtain an arbitrator's determination prior to judicial review. See Brief for Respondent 13.</p>\n<p>That is not the position Ferrer took in the California courts. In his complaint, he urged the Superior Court to declare that \"the [c]ontract, including in particular the issue of the validity of the [c]ontract, <i>is not subject to arbitration,</i>\" and he sought an injunction stopping arbitration \"unless and until, <i>if ever,</i> the Labor Commissioner determines that he/she has no jurisdiction over the parties' dispute.\" App. 29 (emphasis added). Ferrer also told the Superior Court: \"[I]f ... the Commissioner rules that the [c]ontract is void, Preston may appeal that ruling and have a hearing de novo <i>before this Court.</i>\" Appellant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*986</span> App. in No. B188997 (Cal.App.), p. 157, n. 1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Nor does Ferrer's current argumentย that ยง 1700.44(a) merely postpones arbitrationยwithstand examination. Section 1700.44(a) provides for <i>de novo</i> review in Superior Court, not elsewhere.<sup>[6]</sup> Arbitration, if it ever occurred following the Labor Commissioner's decision, would likely be long delayed, in contravention of Congress' intent \"to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.\" <i>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 22, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). If Ferrer prevailed in the California courts, moreover, he would no doubt argue that judicial findings of fact and conclusions of law, made after a full and fair <i>de novo</i> hearing in court, are binding on the parties and preclude the arbitrator from making any contrary rulings.</p>\n<p>A prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve \"streamlined proceedings and expeditious results.\" <i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111513\"><a href=\"/opinion/111513/mitsubishi-motors-corp-v-soler-chrysler-plymouth-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span>, 633, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). See also <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.,</i> 513 U.S., at 278; <i>Southland Corp.,</i> 465 U.S., at 7, 104 S.Ct. 852. That objective would be frustrated even if Preston could compel arbitration in lieu of <i>de novo</i> Superior Court review. Requiring initial reference of the parties' dispute to the Labor Commissioner would, at the least, hinder speedy resolution of the controversy.</p>\n<p>Ferrer asks us to overlook the apparent conflict between the arbitration clause and ยง 1700.44(a) because proceedings before the Labor Commissioner are administrative rather than judicial. Brief for Respondent 40-48. Allowing parties to proceed directly to arbitration, Ferrer contends, would undermine the Labor Commissioner's ability to stay informed of potentially illegal activity, <i>id.,</i> at 43, and would deprive artists protected by the TAA of the Labor Commissioner's expertise, <i>id.,</i> at 41-43.</p>\n<p>In <i>Gilmer v.

The \"mere involvement of an administrative agency in the enforcement of a statute,\" we held, does not limit private parties' obligation to comply with their arbitration agreements. <i>Id.,</i> at 28-29, 111 S.Ct. 1647.</p>\n<p>Ferrer points to our holding in <i>EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118475\"><a href=\"/opinion/118475/eeoc-v-waffle-house-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, 293-294, 122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755 (2002), that an arbitration agreement signed by an employee who becomes a discrimination complainant does not bar the EEOC from filing an enforcement suit in its own name. He further emphasizes our observation in <i>Gilmer</i> that individuals who agreed to arbitrate their discrimination claims would \"still be free to file a charge with the EEOC.\" 500 U.S., at 28, 111 S.Ct. 1647. Consistent with these decisions, Ferrer argues, the arbitration clause in his contract <span class=\"star-pagination\">*987</span> with Preston leaves undisturbed the Labor Commissioner's independent authority to enforce the TAA. See Brief for Respondent 44-48. And so it may.<sup>[7]</sup> But in proceedings under ยง 1700.44(a), the Labor Commissioner functions not as an advocate advancing a cause before a tribunal authorized to find the facts and apply the law; instead, the Commissioner serves as impartial arbiter. That role is just what the FAA-governed agreement between Ferrer and Preston reserves for the arbitrator. In contrast, in <i>Waffle House</i> and in the <i>Gilmer</i> aside Ferrer quotes, the Court addressed the role of an agency, not as adjudicator but as prosecutor, pursuing an enforcement action in its own name or reviewing a discrimination charge to determine whether to initiate judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p>Finally, it bears repeating that Preston's petition presents precisely and only a question concerning the forum in which the parties' dispute will be heard. See <i>supra,</i> at 983. \"By agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral ... forum.\" <i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.,</i> 473 U.S., at 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346. So here, Ferrer relinquishes no substantive rights the TAA or other California law may accord him. But under the contract he signed, he cannot escape resolution of those rights in an arbitral forum.</p>\n<p>In sum, we disapprove the distinction between judicial and administrative proceedings drawn by Ferrer and adopted by the appeals court. When parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, the FAA supersedes state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Ferrer's final attempt to distinguish <i>Buckeye</i> relies on <i>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112212\"><a href=\"/opinion/112212/volt-info-sciences-inc-v-bd-of-trustees-of-leland-/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989). <i>Volt</i> involved a California statute dealing with cases in which \"[a] party to [an] arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action ... [involving] a third party [not bound by the arbitration agreement], arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions.\" Cal.Civ.Proc. Code Ann. ยง 1281.2(c) (West 2007). To avoid the \"possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact,\" the statute gives the Superior Court authority, <i>inter alia,</i> to stay the court proceeding \"pending the outcome of the arbitration\" or to stay the arbitration \"pending the outcome of the court action.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Volt Information Sciences and Stanford University were parties to a construction contract containing an arbitration clause. When a dispute arose and Volt demanded arbitration, Stanford sued Volt and two other companies involved in the construction project. Those other companies were not parties to the arbitration agreement; Stanford sought indemnification from them in the event that Volt prevailed against Stanford. At Stanford's request, the Superior Court stayed the arbitration. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the stay order. Volt and Stanford incorporated ยง 1281.2(c) into their agreement, the appeals court held. They did so by stipulating that the contractยotherwise silent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*988</span> on the priority of suits drawing in parties not subject to arbitrationยwould be governed by California law. <i>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ. v. Volt Information Sciences, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></span>, 561 (1987) (officially depublished). Relying on the Court of Appeal's interpretation of the contract, we held that the FAA did not bar a stay of arbitration pending the resolution of Stanford's Superior Court suit against Volt and the two companies not bound by the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>Preston and Ferrer's contract also contains a choice-of-law clause, which states that the \"agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California.\" App. 17. A separate saving clause provides: \"If there is any conflict between this agreement and any present or future law,\" the law prevails over the contract \"to the extent necessary to bring [the contract] within the requirements of said law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18. Those contractual terms, according to Ferrer, call for the application of California procedural law, including ยง 1700.44(a)'s grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Labor Commissioner.</p>\n<p>Ferrer's reliance on <i>Volt</i> is misplaced for two discrete reasons. First, arbitration was stayed in <i>Volt</i> to accommodate litigation involving third parties who were strangers to the arbitration agreement. Nothing in the arbitration agreement addressed the order of proceedings when pending litigation with third parties presented the prospect of inconsistent rulings. We thought it proper, in those circumstances, to recognize state law as the gap filler.</p>\n<p>Here, in contrast, the arbitration clause speaks to the matter in controversy; it states that \"any dispute ... relating to... the breach, validity, or legality\" of the contract should be arbitrated in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules. App. 18. Both parties are bound by the arbitration agreement; the question of Preston's status as a talent agent relates to the validity or legality of the contract; there is no risk that related litigation will yield conflicting rulings on common issues; and there is no other procedural void for the choice-of-law clause to fill.</p>\n<p>Second, we are guided by our more recent decision in <i>Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117907\"><a href=\"/opinion/117907/mastrobuono-v-shearson-lehman-hutton-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 115 S.Ct. 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 76 (1995). Although the contract in <i>Volt</i> provided for \"arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association,\" 489 U.S., at 470, n. 1, 109 S.Ct. 1248 (internal quotation marks omitted), Volt never argued that incorporation of those rules trumped the choice-of-law clause contained in the contract, see Brief for Appellant, and Reply Brief, in <i>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of</i><i> Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,</i> O.T.1987, No. 87-1318. Therefore, neither our decision in <i>Volt</i> nor the decision of the California appeals court in that case addressed the import of the contract's incorporation by reference of privately promulgated arbitration rules.</p>\n<p>In <i>Mastrobuono,</i> we reached that open question while interpreting a contract with both a New York choice-of-law clause and a clause providing for arbitration in accordance with the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). 514 U.S., at 58-59, 115 S.Ct. 1212.<sup>[8]</sup> The \"best <span class=\"star-pagination\">*989</span> way to harmonize\" the two clauses, we held, was to read the choice-of-law clause \"to encompass substantive principles that New York courts would apply, but not to include [New York's] special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 63-64, 115 S.Ct. 1212.</p>\n<p>Preston and Ferrer's contract, as noted, provides for arbitration in accordance with the AAA rules. App. 18. One of those rules states that \"[t]he arbitrator shall have the power to determine the existence or validity of a contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part.\" AAA, Commercial Arbitration Rules ยถ R-7(b) (2007), online at http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id= 22440 (as visited Feb. 15, 2008, and in Clerk of Court's case file). The incorporation of the AAA rules, and in particular Rule 7(b), weighs against inferring from the choice-of-law clause an understanding shared by Ferrer and Preston that their disputes would be heard, in the first instance, by the Labor Commissioner. Following the guide <i>Mastrobuono</i> provides, the \"best way to harmonize\" the parties' adoption of the AAA rules and their selection of California law is to read the latter to encompass prescriptions governing the substantive rights and obligations of the parties, but not the State's \"special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.\" 514 U.S., at 63-64, 115 S.Ct. 1212.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the California Court of Appeal is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As I have stated on many previous occasions, I believe that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. ยง 1 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), does not apply to proceedings in state courts.

See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14.</p>\n<p>[8]  The question in <i>Mastrobuono</i> was whether the arbitrator could award punitive damages. See <i>Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117907\"><a href=\"/opinion/117907/mastrobuono-v-shearson-lehman-hutton-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 53-54, 115 S.Ct. 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 76 (1995). New York law prohibited arbitrators, but not courts, from awarding such damages. <i>Id.,</i> at 55, 115 S.Ct. 1212. The NASD rules, in contrast, authorized \"damages and other relief,\" which, according to a NASD arbitration manual, included punitive damages. <i>Id.,</i> at 61, 115 S.Ct. 1212 (internal quotation marks omitted). Relying on <i>Volt,</i> respondents argued that the choice-of-law clause incorporated into the parties' arbitration agreement New York's ban on arbitral awards of punitive damages.

FERRER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA, SEC\n               OND APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n No. 06โ1463. Argued January 14, 2008โDecided February 20, 2008\nA contract between respondent Ferrer, who appears on television as\n  โJudge Alex,โ and petitioner Preston, an entertainment industry at\n  torney, requires arbitration of โany dispute . . . relating to the [con\n  tractโs] terms . . . or the breach, validity, or legality thereof . . . in ac\n  cordance with [American Arbitration Association (AAA)] rules.โ\n  Preston invoked this provision to gain fees allegedly due under the\n  contract. Ferrer thereupon petitioned the California Labor Commis\n  sioner (Labor Commissioner) for a determination that the contract\n  was invalid and unenforceable under Californiaโs Talent Agencies Act\n  (TAA) because Preston had acted as a talent agent without the re\n  quired license. After the Labor Commissionerโs hearing officer de\n  nied Ferrerโs motion to stay the arbitration, Ferrer filed suit in state\n  court seeking to enjoin arbitration, and Preston moved to compel ar\n  bitration. The court denied Prestonโs motion and enjoined him from\n  proceeding before the arbitrator unless and until the Labor Commis\n  sioner determined she lacked jurisdiction over the dispute. While\n  Prestonโs appeal was pending, this Court held, in Buckeye Check\n  Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 446, that challenges to the\n  validity of a contract requiring arbitration of disputes ordinarily\n  โshould . . . be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.โ Affirming\n  the judgment below, the California Court of Appeal held that the\n  TAA vested the Labor Commissioner with exclusive original jurisdic\n  tion over the dispute, and that Buckeye was inapposite because it did\n  not involve an administrative agency with exclusive jurisdiction over\n  a disputed issue.\nHeld: When parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a con\n tract, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. ยง1 et seq., super\n sedes state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum,\n2                         PRESTON v. FERRER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    whether judicial or administrative. Pp. 4โ16.\n      (a) The issue is not whether the FAA preempts the TAA wholesale.\n    Instead, the question is simply who decidesโthe arbitrator or the\n    Labor Commissionerโwhether Preston acted as an unlicensed talent\n    agent in violation of the TAA, as Ferrer claims, or as a personal man\n    ager not governed by the TAA, as Preston contends. P. 4.\n      (b) FAA ยง2 โdeclare[s] a national policy favoring arbitrationโ when\n    the parties contract for that mode of dispute resolution. Southland\n    Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 10. That national policy โappli[es] in\n    state as well as federal courtsโ and โforeclose[s] state legislative at\n    tempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.โ Id.,\n    at 16. The FAAโs displacement of conflicting state law has been re\n    peatedly reaffirmed. See, e.g., Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 445โ446; Allied-\n    Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 272.          A recurring\n    question under ยง2 is who should decide whether โgrounds . . . exist at\n    law or in equityโ to invalidate an arbitration agreement. In Prima\n    Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403โ404,\n    which originated in federal court, this Court held that attacks on an\n    entire contractโs validity, as distinct from attacks on the arbitration\n    clause alone, are within the arbitratorโs ken. Buckeye held that the\n    same rule applies in state court. See 546 U. S., at 446.\n      Buckeye largely, if not entirely, resolves the present dispute. The\n    contract at issue clearly โevidenc[ed] a transaction involving com\n    merceโ under ยง2, and Ferrer has never disputed that the contractโs\n    written arbitration provision falls within ยง2โs purview. Ferrer sought\n    invalidation of the contract as a whole. He made no discrete chal\n    lenge to the validity of the arbitration clause, and thus sought to\n    override that clause on a ground Buckeye requires the arbitrator to\n    decide in the first instance. Pp. 5โ6.\n      (c) Ferrer attempts to distinguish Buckeye, urging that the TAA\n    merely requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before the\n    parties proceed to arbitration. This argument is unconvincing.\n    Pp. 6โ12.\n         (1) Procedural prescriptions of the TAA conflict with the FAAโs\n    dispute resolution regime in two basic respects: (1) One TAA provi\n    sion grants the Labor Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide\n    an issue that the parties agreed to arbitrate, see Buckeye, 546 U. S.,\n    at 446; (2) another imposes prerequisites to enforcement of an arbi\n    tration agreement that are not applicable to contracts generally, see\n    Doctorโs Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687. Pp. 7โ8.\n         (2) Ferrer contends that the TAA is compatible with the FAA be\n    cause the TAA provision vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Labor\n    Commissioner merely postpones arbitration. That position is con\n    trary to the one Ferrer took in the California courts and does not\n                    Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nwithstand examination. Arbitration, if it ever occurred following the\nLabor Commissionerโs decision, would likely be long delayed, in con\ntravention of Congressโ intent โto move the parties to an arbitrable\ndispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as pos\nsible.โ Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,\n460 U. S. 1, 22. Pp. 8โ10.\n      (3) Ferrer contends that the conflict between the arbitration\nclause and the TAA should be overlooked because Labor Commis\nsioner proceedings are administrative rather than judicial. The\nCourt rejected a similar argument in Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson\nLane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28โ29. Pp. 10โ12.\n   (d) Ferrerโs reliance on Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of\nTrustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, is misplaced\nfor two reasons. First, arbitration was stayed in Volt to accommodate\nlitigation involving third parties who were strangers to the arbitra\ntion agreement. Because the contract at issue in Volt did not address\nthe order of proceedings and included a choice-of-law clause adopting\nCalifornia law, the Volt Court recognized as the gap filler a California\nstatute authorizing the state court to stay either third-party court\nproceedings or arbitration proceedings to avoid the possibility of con\nflicting rulings on a common issue. Here, in contrast, the arbitration\nclause speaks to the matter in controversy; both parties are bound by\nthe arbitration agreement; the question of Prestonโs status as a tal\nent agent relates to the validity or legality of the contract; there is no\nrisk that related litigation will yield conflicting rulings on common\nissues; and there is no other procedural void for the choice-of-law\nclause to fill. Second, the Court is guided by its decision in Mastro\nbuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52. Although the\nVolt contract provided for arbitration in accordance with AAA rules,\n489 U. S., at 470, n. 1, Volt never argued that incorporation of those\nrules by reference trumped the contractโs choice-of-law clause, so this\nCourt never addressed the import of such incorporation. In Mastro\nbuono, the Court reached that open question, declaring that the โbest\nway to harmonizeโ a New York choice-of-law clause and a clause pro\nviding for arbitration in accordance with privately promulgated arbi\ntration rules was to read the choice-of-law clause โto encompass sub\nstantive principles that New York courts would apply, but not to\ninclude [New Yorkโs] special rules limiting [arbitratorsโ] authority.โ\n514 U. S., at 63โ64. Similarly here, the โbest way to harmonizeโ the\nFerrer-Preston contractโs adoption of the AAA rules and its selection\nof California law is to read the latter to encompass prescriptions gov\nerning the partiesโ substantive rights and obligations, but not the\nStateโs โspecial rules limiting [arbitratorsโ] authority.โ Ibid.

ALEX E. \n\n                  FERRER \n\n   ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF\n\n       CALIFORNIA, SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n                              [February 20, 2008]\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   As this Court recognized in Southland Corp. v. Keating,\n465 U. S. 1 (1984), the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or\nAct), 9 U. S. C. ยง1 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V), estabยญ\nlishes a national policy favoring arbitration when the\nparties contract for that mode of dispute resolution. The\nAct, which rests on Congressโ authority under the Comยญ\nmerce Clause, supplies not simply a procedural framework\napplicable in federal courts; it also calls for the applicaยญ\ntion, in state as well as federal courts, of federal substanยญ\ntive law regarding arbitration. 465 U. S., at 16. More\nrecently, in Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546\nU. S. 440 (2006), the Court clarified that, when parties\nagree to arbitrate all disputes arising under their contract,\nquestions concerning the validity of the entire contract are\nto be resolved by the arbitrator in the first instance, not by\na federal or state court.\n   The instant petition presents the following question:\nDoes the FAA override not only state statutes that refer\ncertain state-law controversies initially to a judicial forum,\nbut also state statutes that refer certain disputes initially\n2                       PRESTON v. FERRER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto an administrative agency? We hold today that, when\nparties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a\ncontract, state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in anยญ\nother forum, whether judicial or administrative, are suยญ\nperseded by the FAA.\n                              I\n  This case concerns a contract between respondent Alex\nE. Ferrer, a former Florida trial court judge who currently\nappears as โJudge Alexโ on a Fox television network proยญ\ngram, and petitioner Arnold M. Preston, a California\nattorney who renders services to persons in the enterยญ\ntainment industry. Seeking fees allegedly due under the\ncontract, Preston invoked the partiesโ agreement to arbiยญ\ntrate โany dispute . . . relating to the terms of [the conยญ\ntract] or the breach, validity, or legality thereof . . . in\naccordance with the rules [of the American Arbitration\nAssociation].โ App. 18.\n  Prestonโs demand for arbitration, made in June 2005,\nwas countered a month later by Ferrerโs petition to the\nCalifornia Labor Commissioner charging that the contract\nwas invalid and unenforceable under the California Talent\nAgencies Act (TAA), Cal. Lab. Code Ann. ยง1700 et seq.\n(West 2003 and Supp. 2008). Ferrer asserted that Preston\nacted as a talent agent without the license required by the\nTAA, and that Prestonโs unlicensed status rendered the\nentire contract void.1\n  The Labor Commissionerโs hearing officer, in November\n2005, determined that Ferrer had stated a โcolorable basis\nfor exercise of the Labor Commissionerโs jurisdiction.โ\nApp. 33. The officer denied Ferrerโs motion to stay the\narbitration, however, on the ground that the Labor Comยญ\nmissioner lacked authority to order such relief. Ferrer\nโโโโโโ\n  1 The TAA uses the term โtalent agencyโ to describe both corporations\n\nand individual talent agents.

S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthen filed suit in the Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking\na declaration that the controversy between the parties\nโarising from the [c]ontract, including in particular the\nissue of the validity of the [c]ontract, is not subject to\narbitration.โ Id., at 29. As interim relief, Ferrer sought\nan injunction restraining Preston from proceeding before\nthe arbitrator. Preston responded by moving to compel\narbitration.\n  In December 2005, the Superior Court denied Prestonโs\nmotion to compel arbitration and enjoined Preston from\nproceeding before the arbitrator โunless and until the\nLabor Commissioner determines that . . . she is without\njurisdiction over the disputes between Preston and Ferยญ\nrer.โ No. BC342454 (Dec. 7, 2005), App. C to Pet. for Cert.\n18a, 26aโ27a. During the pendency of Prestonโs appeal\nfrom the Superior Courtโs decision, this Court reaffirmed,\nin Buckeye, that challenges to the validity of a contract\nproviding for arbitration ordinarily โshould . . . be considยญ\nered by an arbitrator, not a court.โ 546 U. S., at 446.\n  In a 2-to-1 decision issued in November 2006, the Caliยญ\nfornia Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Courtโs\njudgment. The appeals court held that the relevant proviยญ\nsion of the TAA, Cal. Lab. Code Ann. ยง1700.44(a) (West\n2003), vests โexclusive original jurisdictionโ over the disยญ\npute in the Labor Commissioner. 145 Cal. App. 4th 440,\n447, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 628, 634. Buckeye is โinapposite,โ\nthe court said, because that case โdid not involve an adยญ\nministrative agency with exclusive jurisdiction over a\ndisputed issue.โ 145 Cal. App. 4th, at 447, 51 Cal. Rptr.\n3d, at 634. The dissenting judge, in contrast, viewed\nBuckeye as controlling; she reasoned that the FAA called\nfor immediate recognition and enforcement of the partiesโ\nagreement to arbitrate and afforded no basis for distinยญ\nguishing prior resort to a state administrative agency from\nprior resort to a state court. 145 Cal. App. 4th, at 450โ\n451, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 636โ637 (Vogel, J., dissenting).\n4                    PRESTON v. FERRER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The California Supreme Court denied Prestonโs petition\nfor review. No. S149190 (Feb. 14, 2007), 2007 Cal. LEXIS\n1539, App. A to Pet. for Cert. 1a. We granted certiorari to\ndetermine whether the FAA overrides a state law vesting\ninitial adjudicatory authority in an administrative agency.\n551 U. S. ___ (2007).\n                              II\n   An easily stated question underlies this controversy.\nFerrer claims that Preston was a talent agent who operยญ\nated without a license in violation of the TAA. Accordยญ\ningly, he urges, the contract between the parties, purportยญ\nedly for โpersonal management,โ is void and Preston is\nentitled to no compensation for any services he rendered.\nPreston, on the other hand, maintains that he acted as a\npersonal manager, not as a talent agent, hence his conยญ\ntract with Ferrer is not governed by the TAA and is both\nlawful and fully binding on the parties.\n   Because the contract between Ferrer and Preston proยญ\nvides that โany dispute . . . relating to the . . . validity, or\nlegalityโ of the agreement โshall be submitted to arbitraยญ\ntion,โ App. 18, Preston urges that Ferrer must litigate โhis\nTAA defense in the arbitral forum,โ Reply Brief 31. Ferrer\ninsists, however, that the โpersonal managerโ or โtalent\nagentโ inquiry falls, under California law, within the\nexclusive original jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner,\nand that the FAA does not displace the Commissionerโs\nprimary jurisdiction. Brief for Respondent 14, 30, 40โ44.\n   The dispositive issue, then, contrary to Ferrerโs suggesยญ\ntion, is not whether the FAA preempts the TAA wholesale.\nSee id., at 44โ48. The FAA plainly has no such destrucยญ\ntive aim or effect. Instead, the question is simply who\ndecides whether Preston acted as personal manager or as\ntalent agent.\n                   Cite as: 552 U.

That national policy,\nwe held in Southland, โappli[es] in state as well as federal\ncourtsโ and โforeclose[s] state legislative attempts to\nundercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.โ\nId., at 16. The FAAโs displacement of conflicting state law\nis โnow well-established,โ Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v.\nDobson, 513 U. S. 265, 272 (1995), and has been repeatยญ\nedly reaffirmed, see, e.g., Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 445โ446;\nDoctorโs Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 684โ\n685 (1996); Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 489 (1987).2\n  A recurring question under ยง2 is who should decide\nwhether โgrounds . . . exist at law or in equityโ to invaliยญ\ndate an arbitration agreement. In Prima Paint Corp. v.\nFlood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403โ404 (1967),\nwe held that attacks on the validity of an entire contract,\nas distinct from attacks aimed at the arbitration clause,\nare within the arbitratorโs ken.\nโโโโโโ\n  2 Although Ferrer urges us to overrule Southland, he relies on the\n\nsame arguments we considered and rejected in Allied-Bruce Terminix\nCos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265 (1995). Compare Brief for Respondent\n55โ59, with Brief for Attorney General of Alabama et al. as Amici\nCuriae in Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, O. T. 1993, No. 93โ\n1001, pp. 11โ19. Adhering to precedent, we do not take up Ferrerโs\ninvitation to overrule Southland.\n6                       PRESTON v. FERRER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The litigation in Prima Paint originated in federal court,\nbut the same rule, we held in Buckeye, applies in state\ncourt. 546 U. S., at 447โ448. The plaintiffs in Buckeye\nalleged that the contracts they signed, which contained\narbitration clauses, were illegal under state law and void\nab initio. Id., at 443. Relying on Southland, we held that\nthe plaintiffsโ challenge was within the province of the\narbitrator to decide. See 546 U. S., at 446.\n  Buckeye largely, if not entirely, resolves the dispute\nbefore us. The contract between Preston and Ferrer\nclearly โevidenc[ed] a transaction involving commerce,โ 9\nU. S. C. ยง2, and Ferrer has never disputed that the written\narbitration provision in the contract falls within the purยญ\nview of ยง2. Moreover, Ferrer sought invalidation of the\ncontract as a whole. In the proceedings below, he made no\ndiscrete challenge to the validity of the arbitration clause.\nSee 145 Cal. App. 4th, at 449, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 635\n(Vogel, J., dissenting).3 Ferrer thus urged the Labor\nCommissioner and California courts to override the conยญ\ntractโs arbitration clause on a ground that Buckeye reยญ\nquires the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.\n                           IV\n  Ferrer attempts to distinguish Buckeye by arguing that\nthe TAA merely requires exhaustion of administrative\nremedies before the parties proceed to arbitration. We\nโโโโโโ\n    3 Ferrerโs\n             petition to the Labor Commissioner sought a declaration\nthat the contract โis void under the [TAA].โ App. 23. His complaint in\nSuperior Court seeking to enjoin arbitration asserted: โ[T]he [c]ontract\nis void by reason of [Prestonโs] attempt to procure employment for\n[Ferrer] in violation of the [TAA],โ and โthe [c]ontractโs arbitration\nclause does not vest authority in an arbitrator to determine whether\nthe contract is void.โ Id., at 27. His brief in the appeals court stated:\nโFerrer does not contend that the arbitration clause in the [c]ontract\nwas procured by fraud. Ferrer contends that Preston unlawfully acted\nas an unlicensed talent agent and hence cannot enforce the [c]ontract.โ\nBrief for Respondent in No. B188997, p. 18.\n                    Cite as: 552 U.

Lab. Code Ann. ยง1700.4(a) (West\n2003). The definition โdoes not cover other services for\nwhich artists often contract, such as personal and career\nmanagement (i.e., advice, direction, coordination, and\noversight with respect to an artistโs career or personal or\nfinancial affairs).โ Styne v. Stevens, 26 Cal. 4th 42, 51, 26\nP. 3d 343, 349 (2001) (emphasis deleted). The TAA reยญ\nquires talent agents to procure a license from the Labor\nCommissioner. ยง1700.5. โIn furtherance of the [TAAโs]\nprotective aims, an unlicensed personโs contract with an\nartist to provide the services of a talent agency is illegal\nand void.โ Id., at 51, 26 P. 3d, at 349.4\n   Section 1700.44(a) of the TAA states:\n     โIn cases of controversy arising under this chapter,\n     the parties involved shall refer the matters in dispute\n     to the Labor Commissioner, who shall hear and deยญ\n     termine the same, subject to an appeal within 10 days\n     after determination, to the superior court where the\n     same shall be heard de novo.โ\nAbsent a notice of appeal filed within ten days, the Labor\nCommissionerโs determination becomes final and binding\nโโโโโโ\n  4 Courts โmay void the entire contractโ where talent agency services\n\nregulated by the TAA are โinseparable from [unregulated] managerial\nservices.โ Marathon Entertainment, Inc. v. Blasi, No. S145428, 2008\nWL 216532, *13 (Cal., Jan. 28, 2008). If the contractual terms are\nseverable, however, โan isolated instanceโ of unlicensed conduct โdoes\nnot automatically bar recovery for services that could lawfully be\nprovided without a license.โ Ibid.\n8                      PRESTON v. FERRER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\non the parties. REO Broadcasting Consultants v. Martin,\n69 Cal. App. 4th 489, 495, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 639, 642โ643\n(1999).5\n   The TAA permits arbitration in lieu of proceeding before\nthe Labor Commissioner if an arbitration provision โin a\ncontract between a talent agency and [an artist]โ both\nโprovides for reasonable notice to the Labor Commissioner\nof the time and place of all arbitration hearingsโ and gives\nthe Commissioner โthe right to attend all arbitration\nhearings.โ ยง1700.45. This prescription demonstrates that\nthere is no inherent conflict between the TAA and arbitraยญ\ntion as a dispute resolution mechanism. But ยง1700.45 was\nof no utility to Preston. He has consistently maintained\nthat he is not a talent agent as that term is defined in\nยง1700.4(a), but is, instead, a personal manager not subject\nto the TAAโs regulatory regime. 145 Cal. App. 4th, at 444,\n51 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 631. To invoke ยง1700.45, Preston\nwould have been required to concede a point fatal to\nhis claim for compensationโi.e., that he is a talent\nagent, albeit an unlicensed oneโand to have drafted his\ncontract in compliance with a statute that he maintains is\ninapplicable.\n   Procedural prescriptions of the TAA thus conflict with\nthe FAAโs dispute resolution regime in two basic respects:\nFirst, the TAA, in ยง1700.44(a), grants the Labor Commisยญ\nsioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide an issue that the\nparties agreed to arbitrate, see Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 446;\nsecond, the TAA, in ยง1700.45, imposes prerequisites to\nenforcement of an arbitration agreement that are not\napplicable to contracts generally, see Doctorโs Associates,\nInc., 517 U. S., at 687.\n\n\nโโโโโโ\n  5 To appeal the Labor Commissionerโs decision, an aggrieved party\n\nmust post a bond of at least $1,000 and up to twice the amount of any\njudgment approved by the Commissioner. ยง1700.44(a).\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

Brief for Respondent 14,\n40. The party that loses before the Labor Commissioner\nmay file for de novo review in Superior Court. See\nยง1700.44(a). At that point, Ferrer asserts, either party\ncould move to compel arbitration under Cal. Civ. Proc.\nCode Ann. ยง1281.2 (West 2007), and thereby obtain an\narbitratorโs determination prior to judicial review. See\nBrief for Respondent 13.\n   That is not the position Ferrer took in the California\ncourts. In his complaint, he urged the Superior Court to\ndeclare that โthe [c]ontract, including in particular the\nissue of the validity of the [c]ontract, is not subject to\narbitration,โ and he sought an injunction stopping arbitraยญ\ntion โunless and until, if ever, the Labor Commissioner\ndetermines that he/she has no jurisdiction over the parยญ\ntiesโ dispute.โ App. 29 (emphasis added). Ferrer also told\nthe Superior Court: โ[I]f . . . the Commissioner rules that\nthe [c]ontract is void, Preston may appeal that ruling and\nhave a hearing de novo before this Court.โ Appellantโs\nApp. in No. B188997 (Cal. App.), p. 157, n. 1 (emphasis\nadded).\n   Nor does Ferrerโs current argumentโthat ยง1700.44(a)\nmerely postpones arbitrationโwithstand examination.\nSection 1700.44(a) provides for de novo review in Superior\nCourt, not elsewhere.6 Arbitration, if it ever occurred\nโโโโโโ\n  6 From Superior Court an appeal lies in the Court of Appeal. Cal.\n\nCiv. Proc. Ann. ยง904.1(a) (West 2007); Cal. Rule of Court 8.100(a)\n(Appellate Rules) (West 2007 rev. ed.). Thereafter, the losing party\nmay seek review in the California Supreme Court, Rule 8.500(a)(1)\n(Appellate Rules), perhaps followed by a petition for a writ of certiorari\nin this Court, 28 U. S. C. ยง1257. Ferrer has not identified a single case\nholding that California law permits interruption of this chain of apยญ\n10                   PRESTON v. FERRER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfollowing the Labor Commissionerโs decision, would likely\nbe long delayed, in contravention of Congressโ intent โto\nmove the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and\ninto arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.โ Moses\nH. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460\nU. S. 1, 22 (1983). If Ferrer prevailed in the California\ncourts, moreover, he would no doubt argue that judicial\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, made after a full\nand fair de novo hearing in court, are binding on the parยญ\nties and preclude the arbitrator from making any contrary\nrulings.\n   A prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to\nachieve โstreamlined proceedings and expeditious results.โ\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,\n473 U. S. 614, 633 (1985). See also Allied-Bruce Terminix\nCos., 513 U. S., at 278; Southland Corp., 465 U. S., at 7.\nThat objective would be frustrated even if Preston could\ncompel arbitration in lieu of de novo Superior Court reยญ\nview. Requiring initial reference of the partiesโ dispute to\nthe Labor Commissioner would, at the least, hinder\nspeedy resolution of the controversy.\n   Ferrer asks us to overlook the apparent conflict between\nthe arbitration clause and ยง1700.44(a) because proceedยญ\nings before the Labor Commissioner are administrative\nrather than judicial. Brief for Respondent 40โ48. Allowยญ\ning parties to proceed directly to arbitration, Ferrer conยญ\ntends, would undermine the Labor Commissionerโs ability\nto stay informed of potentially illegal activity, id., at 43,\nand would deprive artists protected by the TAA of the\nLabor Commissionerโs expertise, id., at 41โ43.\n   In Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S.\n20 (1991), we considered and rejected a similar argument,\nnamely, that arbitration of age discrimination claims\nโโโโโโ \n\npeals to allow the arbitrator to review the Labor Commissionerโs\n\ndecision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35. \n\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwould undermine the role of the Equal Employment Opยญ\nportunity Commission (EEOC) in enforcing federal law.\nThe โmere involvement of an administrative agency in the\nenforcement of a statute,โ we held, does not limit private\npartiesโ obligation to comply with their arbitration agreeยญ\nments. Id., at 28โ29.\n   Ferrer points to our holding in EEOC v. Waffle House,\nInc., 534 U. S. 279, 293โ294 (2002), that an arbitration\nagreement signed by an employee who becomes a disยญ\ncrimination complainant does not bar the EEOC from\nfiling an enforcement suit in its own name. He further\nemphasizes our observation in Gilmer that individuals\nwho agreed to arbitrate their discrimination claims would\nโstill be free to file a charge with the EEOC.โ 500 U. S.,\nat 28. Consistent with these decisions, Ferrer argues, the\narbitration clause in his contract with Preston leaves\nundisturbed the Labor Commissionerโs independent auยญ\nthority to enforce the TAA. See Brief for Respondent 44โ\n48. And so it may.7 But in proceedings under ยง1700.44(a),\nthe Labor Commissioner functions not as an advocate\nadvancing a cause before a tribunal authorized to find the\nfacts and apply the law; instead, the Commissioner serves\nas impartial arbiter. That role is just what the FAA-\ngoverned agreement between Ferrer and Preston reserves\nfor the arbitrator. In contrast, in Waffle House and in the\nGilmer aside Ferrer quotes, the Court addressed the role\nof an agency, not as adjudicator but as prosecutor, pursuยญ\ning an enforcement action in its own name or reviewing a\ndiscrimination charge to determine whether to initiate\nโโโโโโ\n  7 Enforcement of the partiesโ arbitration agreement in this case does\n\nnot displace any independent authority the Labor Commissioner may\nhave to investigate and rectify violations of the TAA. See Brief for\nRespondent 47 (โ[T]he Commissioner has independent investigatory\nauthority and may receive information concerning alleged violations of\nthe TAA from any source.โ (citation omitted)). See also Tr. of Oral Arg.\n13โ14.\n12                  PRESTON v. FERRER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudicial proceedings.\n  Finally, it bears repeating that Prestonโs petition preยญ\nsents precisely and only a question concerning the forum\nin which the partiesโ dispute will be heard. See supra,\nat 4. โBy agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party\ndoes not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statยญ\nute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral . . .\nforum.โ Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U. S., at 628. So\nhere, Ferrer relinquishes no substantive rights the TAA or\nother California law may accord him. But under the\ncontract he signed, he cannot escape resolution of those\nrights in an arbitral forum.\n  In sum, we disapprove the distinction between judicial\nand administrative proceedings drawn by Ferrer and\nadopted by the appeals court. When parties agree to\narbitrate all questions arising under a contract, the FAA\nsupersedes state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in\nanother forum, whether judicial or administrative.\n                                V\n  Ferrerโs final attempt to distinguish Buckeye relies on\nVolt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of\nLeland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468 (1989). Volt\ninvolved a California statute dealing with cases in which\nโ[a] party to [an] arbitration agreement is also a party to a\npending court action . . . [involving] a third party [not\nbound by the arbitration agreement], arising out of the\nsame transaction or series of related transactions.โ Cal.\nCiv. Proc. Code Ann. ยง1281.2(c) (West 2007). To avoid the\nโpossibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law\nor fact,โ the statute gives the Superior Court authority,\ninter alia, to stay the court proceeding โpending the outยญ\ncome of the arbitrationโ or to stay the arbitration โpending\nthe outcome of the court action.โ Ibid.\n  Volt Information Sciences and Stanford University were\nparties to a construction contract containing an arbitraยญ\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion clause. When a dispute arose and Volt demanded\narbitration, Stanford sued Volt and two other companies\ninvolved in the construction project. Those other compaยญ\nnies were not parties to the arbitration agreement; Stanยญ\nford sought indemnification from them in the event that\nVolt prevailed against Stanford. At Stanfordโs request,\nthe Superior Court stayed the arbitration. The California\nCourt of Appeal affirmed the stay order. Volt and Stanยญ\nford incorporated ยง1281.2(c) into their agreement, the\nappeals court held. They did so by stipulating that the\ncontractโotherwise silent on the priority of suits drawing\nin parties not subject to arbitrationโwould be governed\nby California law. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford\nJunior Univ. v. Volt Information Sciences, Inc., 240 Cal.\nRptr. 558, 561 (1987) (officially depublished). Relying on\nthe Court of Appealโs interpretation of the contract, we\nheld that the FAA did not bar a stay of arbitration pendยญ\ning the resolution of Stanfordโs Superior Court suit\nagainst Volt and the two companies not bound by the\narbitration agreement.\n   Preston and Ferrerโs contract also contains a choice-ofยญ\nlaw clause, which states that the โagreement shall be\ngoverned by the laws of the state of California.โ App. 17.\nA separate saving clause provides: โIf there is any conflict\nbetween this agreement and any present or future law,โ\nthe law prevails over the contract โto the extent necessary\nto bring [the contract] within the requirements of said\nlaw.โ Id., at 18. Those contractual terms, according to\nFerrer, call for the application of California procedural\nlaw, including ยง1700.44(a)โs grant of exclusive jurisdiction\nto the Labor Commissioner.\n   Ferrerโs reliance on Volt is misplaced for two discrete\nreasons. First, arbitration was stayed in Volt to accomยญ\nmodate litigation involving third parties who were strangยญ\ners to the arbitration agreement. Nothing in the arbitraยญ\ntion agreement addressed the order of proceedings when\n14                  PRESTON v. FERRER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npending litigation with third parties presented the prosยญ\npect of inconsistent rulings. We thought it proper, in\nthose circumstances, to recognize state law as the gap\nfiller.\n   Here, in contrast, the arbitration clause speaks to the\nmatter in controversy; it states that โany dispute . . .\nrelating to . . . the breach, validity, or legalityโ of the\ncontract should be arbitrated in accordance with the\nAmerican Arbitration Association (AAA) rules. App. 18.\nBoth parties are bound by the arbitration agreement; the\nquestion of Prestonโs status as a talent agent relates to the\nvalidity or legality of the contract; there is no risk that\nrelated litigation will yield conflicting rulings on common\nissues; and there is no other procedural void for the choice-\nof-law clause to fill.\n   Second, we are guided by our more recent decision in\nMastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S.\n52 (1995). Although the contract in Volt provided for\nโarbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry\nArbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Associaยญ\ntion,โ 489 U. S., at 470, n. 1 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), Volt never argued that incorporation of those\nrules trumped the choice-of-law clause contained in the\ncontract, see Brief for Appellant, and Reply Brief, in Volt\nInformation Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland\nStanford Junior Univ., O. T. 1987, No. 87โ1318. Thereยญ\nfore, neither our decision in Volt nor the decision of the\nCalifornia appeals court in that case addressed the import\nof the contractโs incorporation by reference of privately\npromulgated arbitration rules.\n   In Mastrobuono, we reached that open question while\ninterpreting a contract with both a New York choice-of-law\nclause and a clause providing for arbitration in accordance\nwith the rules of the National Association of Securities\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nDealers (NASD). 514 U. S., at 58โ59.8 The โbest way to\nharmonizeโ the two clauses, we held, was to read the\nchoice-of-law clause โto encompass substantive principles\nthat New York courts would apply, but not to include\n[New Yorkโs] special rules limiting the authority of arbiยญ\ntrators.โ Id., at 63โ64.\n   Preston and Ferrerโs contract, as noted, provides for arbiยญ\ntration in accordance with the AAA rules. App. 18. One\nof those rules states that โ[t]he arbitrator shall have\nthe power to determine the existence or validity of a\ncontract of which an arbitration clause forms a part.โ AAA,\nCommercial Arbitration Rules ยถRโ7(b) (2007), online at\nhttp://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22440 (as visited Feb. 15,\n2008, and in Clerk of Courtโs case file). The incorporation\nof the AAA rules, and in particular Rule 7(b), weighs\nagainst inferring from the choice-of-law clause an underยญ\nstanding shared by Ferrer and Preston that their disputes\nwould be heard, in the first instance, by the Labor Comยญ\nmissioner. Following the guide Mastrobuono provides, the\nโbest way to harmonizeโ the partiesโ adoption of the AAA\nrules and their selection of California law is to read the\nlatter to encompass prescriptions governing the substanยญ\ntive rights and obligations of the parties, but not the\nStateโs โspecial rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.โ\n514 U. S., at 63โ64.\nโโโโโโ\n   8 The question in Mastrobuono was whether the arbitrator could\n\naward punitive damages. See Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman\nHutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 53โ54 (1995). New York law prohibited\narbitrators, but not courts, from awarding such damages. Id., at 55.\nThe NASD rules, in contrast, authorized โdamages and other relief,โ\nwhich, according to a NASD arbitration manual, included punitive\ndamages. Id., at 61 (internal quotation marks omitted). Relying on\nVolt, respondents argued that the choice-of-law clause incorporated into\nthe partiesโ arbitration agreement New Yorkโs ban on arbitral awards\nof punitive damages. Opposing that argument, petitioners successfully\nurged that the agreement to arbitrate in accordance with the NASD\nrules controlled.\n16                 PRESTON v.

Accordingly, I would affirm\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145830/", "sha1": "3550ad00162e0e0446af9c9c9ce3a69bd5b67e0d", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2007-018", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:18"}
