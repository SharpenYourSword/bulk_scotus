See Strom\nberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931); Yates v. United\nStates, 354 U. S. 298 (1957). In this case the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit held that such an error is\n“structural error,” requiring that the conviction be set\naside on collateral review without regard to whether the\nflaw in the instructions prejudiced the defendant. The\nparties now agree that the Court of Appeals was wrong to\ncategorize this type of error as “structural.” They further\nagree that a reviewing court finding such error should ask\nwhether the flaw in the instructions “had substantial and\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s\nverdict.” Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 623 (1993)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We agree as well and\nso hold.\n   Respondent Michael Pulido was convicted by a Califor\nnia jury of felony murder. On direct appeal, Pulido sought\nto vacate his conviction on the ground that the jury in\n2                  HEDGPETH v. PULIDO\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nstructions were erroneous: They permitted the jury to find\nhim guilty of felony murder if he formed the intent to aid\nand abet the underlying felony before the murder, but\nthey also permitted the jury to find him guilty if he formed\nthat intent only after the murder. The California Su\npreme Court agreed with Pulido that the latter theory was\ninvalid under California law, but upheld the conviction on\nthe ground that Pulido was not prejudiced by the error.\nPeople v. Pulido, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1224920\"><a href=\"/opinion/1224920/people-v-pulido/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 727, 936 P. 2d 1235,\n1243–1244 (1997). Pulido sought federal habeas relief,\nwhich the District Court granted after concluding that\ninstructing the jury on the invalid theory had a “ ‘substan\ntial and injurious effect or influence in determining the\njury’s verdict.’ ” Pulido v. Lamarque, No. C 99–4933 CW\n(RR) (ND Cal., Mar. 24, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a–\n66a (quoting Brecht, supra, at 637).\n   The State appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\nPulido v. Chrones, 487 F. 3d 669 (2007) (per curiam). On\nappeal, Pulido argued the District Court’s Brecht analysis\nwas correct, but in the alternative sought to avoid the\nharmless-error inquiry altogether. In support of that\nalternative argument, he maintained that when a jury\nreturns a general verdict after being instructed on both a\nvalid and an invalid theory, the conviction must be auto\nmatically set aside, without asking whether the invalid\ninstruction was harmless. The Court of Appeals recog\nnized that the Brecht “substantial and injurious effect”\nstandard governs harmless-error analysis on federal ha\nbeas, 487 F. 3d, at 673, n. 3 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), but agreed with Pulido that instructing a jury on\nmultiple theories of guilt, one of which is legally improper,\nwas “structural” error exempting the instructions as a\nwhole from harmless-error review, id., at 675–676. Such\nerror instead required setting aside the conviction on\nhabeas unless the reviewing court could determine with\n“absolute certainty” that the defendant was convicted\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nunder a proper theory. Id., at 676 (citing Lara v. Ryan,\n455 F. 3d 1080, 1086 (CA9 2006)). Because the instruc\ntions “le[ft] open the possibility” that the jury convicted\nPulido on the impermissible ground, the court concluded\nthat the verdict must be reversed. 487 F. 3d, at 676. We\ngranted certiorari. 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n    The Ninth Circuit precedent on which the Court of\nAppeals relied, see Lara v. Ryan, supra, based its struc\ntural-error analysis upon a line of our cases beginning\nwith Stromberg. Stromberg addressed the validity of a\ngeneral verdict that rested on an instruction that the\npetitioner could be found guilty for displaying a red flag as\n“ ‘a sign, symbol, or emblem of opposition to organized\ngovernment, or [a]s an invitation or stimulus to anarchis\ntic action, or [a]s [a]n aid to propaganda that is of a sedi\ntious character.’ ” 283 U. S., at 363. After holding that the\nfirst clause of the instruction proscribed constitutionally\nprotected conduct, we concluded that the petitioner’s\nconviction must be reversed because “it [wa]s impossible to\nsay under which clause of the [instruction] the conviction\nwas obtained.” Id., at 368. In Yates v. United States,\nsupra, we extended this reasoning to a conviction resting\non multiple theories of guilt when one of those theories is\nnot unconstitutional, but is otherwise legally flawed.\n   Both Stromberg and Yates were decided before we con\ncluded in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), that\nconstitutional errors can be harmless. Accordingly, nei\nther Stromberg nor Yates had reason to address whether\nthe instructional errors they identified could be reviewed\nfor harmlessness, or instead required automatic reversal.\nIn a series of post-Chapman cases, however, we concluded\nthat various forms of instructional error are not structural\nbut instead trial errors subject to harmless-error review.\nSee, e.g., Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1 (1999) (omis\nsion of an element of an offense); California v. Roy, 519\nU. S. 2 (1996) (per curiam) (erroneous aider and abettor\n4                  HEDGPETH v. PULIDO\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ninstruction); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987) (mis\nstatement of an element of an offense); Rose v. Clark, 478\nU. S. 570 (1986) (erroneous burden-shifting as to an ele\nment of an offense).\n  Although these cases did not arise in the context of a\njury instructed on multiple theories of guilt, one of which\nis improper, nothing in them suggests that a different\nharmless-error analysis should govern in that particular\ncontext. To the contrary, we emphasized in Rose that\n“while there are some errors to which [harmless-error\nanalysis] does not apply, they are the exception and not\nthe rule.” Id., at 578. And Neder makes clear that harm\nless-error analysis applies to instructional errors so long\nas the error at issue does not categorically “ ‘vitiat[e] all\nthe jury’s findings.’ ” 527 U. S., at 11 (quoting Sullivan v.\nLouisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 281 (1993) (erroneous reason\nable-doubt instructions constitute structural error)). An\ninstructional error arising in the context of multiple theo\nries of guilt no more vitiates all the jury’s findings than\ndoes omission or misstatement of an element of the offense\nwhen only one theory is submitted.\n  In fact, drawing a distinction between alternative\ntheory error and the instructional errors in Neder, Roy,\nPope, and Rose would be “patently illogical,” given that\nsuch a distinction “ ‘reduces to the strange claim that,\nbecause the jury . . . received both a “good” charge and a\n“bad” charge on the issue, the error was somehow more\npernicious than . . . where the only charge on the critical\nissue was a mistaken one.’ ” 487 F. 3d, at 677–678\n(O’Scannlain, J., concurring specially) (quoting Quigley v.\nVose, 834 F. 2d 14, 16 (CA1 1987) (per curiam)); see also\nBecht v. United States, 403 F. 3d 541, 548 (CA8 2005)\n(same), cert. denied, 546 U. S. 1177 (2006).\n  Pulido now agrees with the State that the Court of\nAppeals erred by treating the instructional error in this\ncase as structural, and that the required prejudice analy\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                    5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nsis should be governed by Brecht’s “substantial and injuri\nous effect” standard. See Brief for Respondent 17 (“[t]he\nNinth Circuit was mistaken in its ‘structural defect’ no\nmenclature”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 27 (“We acknowledge that\nthis is a trial error and is subject to the Brecht prejudice\nstandard”). So do we.\n   Pulido nonetheless maintains we should affirm because\nthe Court of Appeals effectively engaged in the Brecht\nanalysis, despite its clear description of the error as\n“structural.” But despite full briefing on the applicability\nof Brecht, the Court of Appeals mentioned Brecht only\nbriefly in a footnote, see 487 F. 3d, at 673, n. 3, and then\nwent on to agree with Pulido’s alternative assertion that\n“the instructional error was structural and therefore not\nsubject to harmless error review,” id., at 675–676. The\ncourt also stated that the conviction had to be overturned\nunless the court was “absolutely certain” that the jury\nrelied on a valid ground. Id., at 676. Such a determina\ntion would appear to be a finding that no violation had\noccurred at all, rather than that any error was harmless.\nIn any event, an “absolute certainty” standard is plainly\ninconsistent with Brecht. Accordingly, we express no view\non whether Pulido is entitled to habeas relief, but rather\nremand to the Court of Appeals for application of Brecht in\nthe first instance.*\n   The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n——————\n  * The dissent maintains the Court of Appeals “undertook a searching\nreview of the parties’ evidence and the jury instructions to determine\nthe error’s effect on the jury.” Post, at 6 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But\nthe Court of Appeals reached its conclusion based solely on the exis\ntence of a typographical error in the special circumstances instructions,\nwithout addressing any of the State’s arguments that the typographical\nerror was harmless in light of the record as a whole. There was no need\nfor that court to address those arguments, of course, because of its\nmistaken conclusion that the instructional error was structural. Under\nsuch circumstances, remand is the appropriate course.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

United States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946),\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993), and O’Neal v.\nMcAninch, 513 U. S. 432 (1995). The Court of Appeals’\ndecision therefore did not warrant this Court’s review and\ndoes not now merit a remand to require that court to\nrepeat its analysis. In my opinion, the interest in expedit\ning the conclusion of this protracted litigation outweighs\nthe interest in correcting a misnomer.\n  Respondent Michael Pulido was charged with felony\nmurder for robbing a gas station and killing the attendant.\nAt trial, the State argued that Pulido acted alone. Pulido\nmaintained that his uncle was the principal actor and that\nhe had no knowledge of his uncle’s plan when the two\narrived at the gas station. While he was waiting in the\ncar, Pulido claimed, he heard a shot and ran into the store.\nAt that point, his uncle insisted that Pulido help him pry\nopen the stolen cash register and dispose of it, and Pulido\n2                  HEDGPETH v. PULIDO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nreluctantly complied. The jury convicted Pulido of felony\nmurder, but it was unable to reach a verdict on the\ncharges that Pulido personally used a firearm and inten\ntionally inflicted great bodily harm.\n   As a matter of California law, felony-murder liability\nextends to all persons jointly engaged in the commission of\na felony at the time of a killing when one of the joint ac\ntors kills in furtherance of the common design. People v.\nPulido, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1224920\"><a href=\"/opinion/1224920/people-v-pulido/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716, 936 P. 2d 1235, 1236 (1997).\nBut a person is not guilty of felony murder if he is only a\n“late-joining” aider and abettor—i.e., if he did not himself\ncommit the murder and his participation in the underlying\nfelony did not begin until after the victim was killed. Ibid.\nIn this case, the trial court’s instructions erroneously\npermitted the jury to find Pulido guilty on such a theory,\nas they did not require the jury to find either that Pulido\ncommitted the murder or that he aided and abetted the\nunderlying robbery before the murder was committed.\nBecause the instructions allowed the jury to convict Pulido\nof felony murder for conduct that does not amount to that\noffense, their inclusion was constitutional error.\n   On direct appeal, the California Supreme Court agreed\nwith Pulido that the late-joiner theory was an invalid\ntheory of felony-murder liability. Ibid. It nevertheless\nheld that any error in the trial court’s instructions was\nharmless. According to the court, the jury found that\nPulido had been engaged in the robbery at the time of the\nkilling because the robbery-murder special-circumstance\ninstruction stated that “the murder was committed while\nthe defendant was engaged” in the “commission of or at\ntempted commission of [a] robbery.” Id., at 727, 936 P. 2d,\nat 1243 (citing Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2(a)(17) (West\n1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Based on that\nportion of the instruction, the court concluded that the\nspecial-circumstance verdict “demonstrates that the jury\ndid not accept the theory that [Pulido] joined the robbery\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

A typographical error in\nthat instruction in fact permitted the jury to find the\nspecial circumstance of robbery-murder true if it found\neither that the murder was committed while the defendant\nwas engaged in the commission of a robbery or that it “was\ncommitted in order to carry out or advance the commission\nof the crime of robbery or to facilitate the escape therefrom\nor to avoid detection”—a finding entirely consistent with\nthe late-joiner theory. App. 14. Thus, as the State con\ncedes, the erroneous instructions made it “reasonably\nlikely” that the jury convicted Pulido on the impermissible\ntheory. Brief for Petitioner 18.\n   After exhausting his state postconviction remedies,1\nPulido sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District\nCourt. The District Court recognized the erroneous dis\njunctive in the special-circumstance instruction that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court had overlooked, and it held that\nthe state court’s conclusion that Pulido was not prejudiced\nby erroneous instructions was “an objectively unreason\nable application of clearly established federal law.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 64a.\n   The District Court then considered the effect of that\nerror on the jury. Correctly relying on Brecht, the District\nCourt began its analysis by noting that a federal habeas\npetitioner “is not entitled to habeas relief unless the State\ncourt’s error resulted in actual prejudice, that is, the error\nhad a ‘substantial and injurious effect or influence in\n——————\n  1 The California Supreme Court summarily denied Pulido’s state\n\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus. See Pulido v. Chrones, 487 F. 3d\n669, 672 (CA9 2007) (per curiam).\n4                   HEDGPETH v. PULIDO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ndetermining the jury’s verdict.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a\n(quoting Brecht, 507 U. S., at 637). If an error had a sub\nstantial influence, or if “the record is so evenly balanced\nthat a conscientious judge is in ‘grave doubt’ ” as to\nwhether it had such an effect, the conviction must be\nreversed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. (quoting O’Neal, 513\nU. S., at 438).\n   To determine whether the error was harmless under\nthis standard, the District Court scrutinized the record,\nincluding the arguments of both parties, the evidence\nsupporting their respective theories of the case, the jury\ninstructions, the jury’s questions to the trial court, and the\nvarious parts of the jury’s verdict. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n65a–66a. Throughout this inquiry, the District Court\nproperly avoided substituting its judgment for the jury’s.\nAs we cautioned in Kotteakos, in undertaking harmless\nerror analysis “it is not the [reviewing] court’s function to\ndetermine guilt or innocence. Nor is it to speculate upon\nprobable reconviction and decide according to how the\nspeculation comes out.” 328 U. S., at 763 (citations omit\nted). Thus, “[t]he inquiry cannot be merely whether there\nwas enough to support the result” in the absence of the\nerror. Id., at 765. Rather, the proper question is “whether\nthe error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is\nleft in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.” Ibid.;\naccord, O’Neal, 513 U. S., at 437.\n   That was precisely the question addressed by the Dis\ntrict Court when it sought to ascertain what the jury\nactually found. The court concluded that, while it is “pos\nsible” that the jury found that Pulido aided and abetted\nthe robbery before the victim was killed, the court had “no\nway of determining whether this was the case.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 66a. Because that uncertainty left the court\nwith “ ‘grave doubt as to the likely effect of [the] error on\nthe jury’s verdict,’ ” it faithfully applied the standard\nmandated by Kotteakos and O’Neal and found that the\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nerror was not harmless. App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. (quot\ning O’Neal, 513 U. S., at 435).\n   On appeal, Pulido contended that the judgment of the\nDistrict Court should be affirmed whether the instruc\ntional error was viewed as structural error or as trial\nerror. Brief of Appellee and Cross-Appellant in Nos. 05–\n15916, 05–16308 (CA9), pp. 53–64 (hereinafter Appellee’s\nBrief). He argued that the error was not harmless under\nBrecht and O’Neal because the substantial evidence that\nsupported the invalid theory made it likely that the jury\nconvicted him on that basis. Appellee’s Brief 55–64. In\nparticular, Pulido noted that the “injurious effect” of this\ntype of error “is greatest when the instruction compro\nmises the defense by appearing to extend liability even to\nthe factual scenario suggested by the defense evidence,” as\nwas true in this case. Id., at 57 (internal quotation marks\nomitted and emphasis deleted). At oral argument, the\nparties’ contentions similarly focused on the Brecht stan\ndard and the result that harmless-error analysis required.\n   Less than two months after oral argument, and before\nthe Court of Appeals issued its decision in this case, a\ndifferent panel of the Ninth Circuit decided Lara v. Ryan,\n455 F. 3d 1080 (2006). Lara was convicted of attempted\nmurder by a jury that had been instructed that it could\nfind him guilty under either an express malice theory or\nan implied malice theory, the second of which is legally\ninvalid. Id., at 1082. The Ninth Circuit described the\nerroneous instruction as a “structural error,” but it held\nthat such an error does not necessitate reversal when a\nreviewing court can “determine with absolute certainty”\nthat the defendant was not convicted under the erroneous\ntheory. Id., at 1086. Because the jury “made a specific\nfinding that Lara attempted to murder willfully, deliber\nately, and with premeditation,” the court concluded that it\nnecessarily relied on the valid instruction and that rever\nsal was therefore not required. Id., at 1086–1087.\n6                      HEDGPETH v. PULIDO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  In those limited instances in which this Court has found\nan error “structural,” we have done so because the error\ndefies analysis by harmless-error standards. See Arizona\nv. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 309 (1991); see also United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 150 (2006) (quot\ning Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 282 (1993);\nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 659, and n. 25\n(1984)). Indeed, it is because the consequences “ ‘are nec\nessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate’ ” that auto\nmatic reversal is required when such errors occur. Gon\nzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S., at 150 (quoting Sullivan, 508 U. S.,\nat 282). That the court in Lara could be “ ‘absolutely\ncertain’ that the jury relied upon the legally correct the\nory,” 455 F. 3d, at 1085, shows both that the error was\nsusceptible of harmless-error analysis and that the court\nin fact found the error harmless despite repeatedly refer\nring to it as “structural.”\n  Citing Lara, the Court of Appeals’ per curiam opinion\nlabeled the erroneous instruction in this case a structural\nerror.2 As in Lara, the court then undertook a searching\nreview of the parties’ evidence and the jury instructions to\ndetermine the error’s effect on the jury. Noting, among\nother things, that “[t]he typographical error in the con\ntemporaneity instruction relied upon by the California\nSupreme Court introduces doubt into any inference to be\ndrawn from the jury’s finding as to the special circum\nstance,” the court concluded that “the jury instructions\nleave open the possibility that the jury convicted Pulido on\na legally impermissible theory.” Pulido v. Chrones, 487\n——————\n  2 The Court of Appeals’ opinion asserts that Pulido argued that the\n\nerror was structural under Lara v. Ryan, 455 F. 3d 1080 (CA9 2006).\nBut due to the timing of the Lara decision, the parties did not raise\narguments relying on that precedent until their postargument supple\nmental briefing. As discussed above, the parties’ arguments had\ninitially focused on the proper application of Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507\nU. S. 619 (1993).\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

That possibility of reliance on\nthe erroneous instruction is the “substantial and injurious\neffect” to which Brecht refers. Thus, although the Court of\nAppeals called the error in this case by the wrong name, it\nperformed substantially the same analysis and reached\nthe same conclusion as the District Court did when it\napplied the standard prescribed by Brecht.3\n   Judge Thomas concurred separately both to defend the\nLara decision and to demonstrate that harmless-error\nanalysis also supports the panel’s result. 487 F. 3d, at\n678–683. Unlike the District Court, Judge Thomas ap\nplied the harmless-error standard announced in Chapman\nv. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), instead of looking to\nBrecht. 487 F. 3d, at 678. But his analysis similarly\nestablishes that at least some jurors very likely relied on\nthe impermissible late-joiner theory. Id., at 679–683.\n   The record before us clearly supports that conclusion.\nIndeed, even petitioner admits that the ambiguity in the\nrobbery and murder instructions and the trial court’s\nconfusing answers to the jury’s questions “combined to\nmake it reasonably likely that the jury applied the in\nstructions in an unconstitutional way.” Brief for Peti\ntioner 18. That reasonable likelihood is sufficient to sup\nport the conclusion that the error was not harmless under\nBrecht.\n   Because the District Court’s analysis was correct and\nthe Court of Appeals’ result was substantially the same, I\nthink this Court’s decision to remand for the purpose of\nobtaining a third analysis of the harmless-error issue is a\nmisuse of scarce judicial resources. I would therefore\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n——————\n   3 The Court of Appeals in fact cited Brecht and recited the proper\n\nstandard in a footnote before turning its attention to Lara: “If there is a\nconstitutional error, we consider whether the error was harmless; that\nis, whether the error had a ‘ “substantial and injurious effect or influ\nence in determining the jury’s verdict.” ’ ” 487 F. 3d, at 673, n. 3.\n</pre>", "id": 145926, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2008/12/02/Hedgpeth_v._Pulido.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)            Cite as: 555 U.

See Strom\nberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931); Yates v. United\nStates, 354 U. S. 298 (1957). In this case the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit held that such an error is\n“structural error,” requiring that the conviction be set\naside on collateral review without regard to whether the\nflaw in the instructions prejudiced the defendant. The\nparties now agree that the Court of Appeals was wrong to\ncategorize this type of error as “structural.” They further\nagree that a reviewing court finding such error should ask\nwhether the flaw in the instructions “had substantial and\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s\nverdict.” Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 623 (1993)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We agree as well and\nso hold.\n   Respondent Michael Pulido was convicted by a Califor\nnia jury of felony murder. On direct appeal, Pulido sought\nto vacate his conviction on the ground that the jury in\n2                  HEDGPETH v. PULIDO\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nstructions were erroneous: They permitted the jury to find\nhim guilty of felony murder if he formed the intent to aid\nand abet the underlying felony before the murder, but\nthey also permitted the jury to find him guilty if he formed\nthat intent only after the murder. The California Su\npreme Court agreed with Pulido that the latter theory was\ninvalid under California law, but upheld the conviction on\nthe ground that Pulido was not prejudiced by the error.\nPeople v. Pulido, 15 Cal. 4th 713, 727, 936 P. 2d 1235,\n1243–1244 (1997). Pulido sought federal habeas relief,\nwhich the District Court granted after concluding that\ninstructing the jury on the invalid theory had a “ ‘substan\ntial and injurious effect or influence in determining the\njury’s verdict.’ ” Pulido v. Lamarque, No. C 99–4933 CW\n(RR) (ND Cal., Mar. 24, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a–\n66a (quoting Brecht, supra, at 637).\n   The State appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\nPulido v. Chrones, 487 F. 3d 669 (2007) (per curiam). On\nappeal, Pulido argued the District Court’s Brecht analysis\nwas correct, but in the alternative sought to avoid the\nharmless-error inquiry altogether. In support of that\nalternative argument, he maintained that when a jury\nreturns a general verdict after being instructed on both a\nvalid and an invalid theory, the conviction must be auto\nmatically set aside, without asking whether the invalid\ninstruction was harmless. The Court of Appeals recog\nnized that the Brecht “substantial and injurious effect”\nstandard governs harmless-error analysis on federal ha\nbeas, 487 F. 3d, at 673, n. 3 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), but agreed with Pulido that instructing a jury on\nmultiple theories of guilt, one of which is legally improper,\nwas “structural” error exempting the instructions as a\nwhole from harmless-error review, id., at 675–676. Such\nerror instead required setting aside the conviction on\nhabeas unless the reviewing court could determine with\n“absolute certainty” that the defendant was convicted\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

Because the instruc\ntions “le[ft] open the possibility” that the jury convicted\nPulido on the impermissible ground, the court concluded\nthat the verdict must be reversed. 487 F. 3d, at 676. We\ngranted certiorari. 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n    The Ninth Circuit precedent on which the Court of\nAppeals relied, see Lara v. Ryan, supra, based its struc\ntural-error analysis upon a line of our cases beginning\nwith Stromberg. Stromberg addressed the validity of a\ngeneral verdict that rested on an instruction that the\npetitioner could be found guilty for displaying a red flag as\n“ ‘a sign, symbol, or emblem of opposition to organized\ngovernment, or [a]s an invitation or stimulus to anarchis\ntic action, or [a]s [a]n aid to propaganda that is of a sedi\ntious character.’ ” 283 U. S., at 363. After holding that the\nfirst clause of the instruction proscribed constitutionally\nprotected conduct, we concluded that the petitioner’s\nconviction must be reversed because “it [wa]s impossible to\nsay under which clause of the [instruction] the conviction\nwas obtained.” Id., at 368. In Yates v. United States,\nsupra, we extended this reasoning to a conviction resting\non multiple theories of guilt when one of those theories is\nnot unconstitutional, but is otherwise legally flawed.\n   Both Stromberg and Yates were decided before we con\ncluded in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), that\nconstitutional errors can be harmless. Accordingly, nei\nther Stromberg nor Yates had reason to address whether\nthe instructional errors they identified could be reviewed\nfor harmlessness, or instead required automatic reversal.\nIn a series of post-Chapman cases, however, we concluded\nthat various forms of instructional error are not structural\nbut instead trial errors subject to harmless-error review.\nSee, e.g., Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1 (1999) (omis\nsion of an element of an offense); California v. Roy, 519\nU. S. 2 (1996) (per curiam) (erroneous aider and abettor\n4                  HEDGPETH v. PULIDO\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ninstruction); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987) (mis\nstatement of an element of an offense); Rose v. Clark, 478\nU. S. 570 (1986) (erroneous burden-shifting as to an ele\nment of an offense).\n  Although these cases did not arise in the context of a\njury instructed on multiple theories of guilt, one of which\nis improper, nothing in them suggests that a different\nharmless-error analysis should govern in that particular\ncontext. To the contrary, we emphasized in Rose that\n“while there are some errors to which [harmless-error\nanalysis] does not apply, they are the exception and not\nthe rule.” Id., at 578. And Neder makes clear that harm\nless-error analysis applies to instructional errors so long\nas the error at issue does not categorically “ ‘vitiat[e] all\nthe jury’s findings.’ ” 527 U. S., at 11 (quoting Sullivan v.\nLouisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 281 (1993) (erroneous reason\nable-doubt instructions constitute structural error)). An\ninstructional error arising in the context of multiple theo\nries of guilt no more vitiates all the jury’s findings than\ndoes omission or misstatement of an element of the offense\nwhen only one theory is submitted.\n  In fact, drawing a distinction between alternative\ntheory error and the instructional errors in Neder, Roy,\nPope, and Rose would be “patently illogical,” given that\nsuch a distinction “ ‘reduces to the strange claim that,\nbecause the jury . . . received both a “good” charge and a\n“bad” charge on the issue, the error was somehow more\npernicious than . . . where the only charge on the critical\nissue was a mistaken one.’ ” 487 F. 3d, at 677–678\n(O’Scannlain, J., concurring specially) (quoting Quigley v.\nVose, 834 F. 2d 14, 16 (CA1 1987) (per curiam)); see also\nBecht v. United States, 403 F. 3d 541, 548 (CA8 2005)\n(same), cert. denied, 546 U. S. 1177 (2006).\n  Pulido now agrees with the State that the Court of\nAppeals erred by treating the instructional error in this\ncase as structural, and that the required prejudice analy\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                    5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nsis should be governed by Brecht’s “substantial and injuri\nous effect” standard. See Brief for Respondent 17 (“[t]he\nNinth Circuit was mistaken in its ‘structural defect’ no\nmenclature”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 27 (“We acknowledge that\nthis is a trial error and is subject to the Brecht prejudice\nstandard”). So do we.\n   Pulido nonetheless maintains we should affirm because\nthe Court of Appeals effectively engaged in the Brecht\nanalysis, despite its clear description of the error as\n“structural.” But despite full briefing on the applicability\nof Brecht, the Court of Appeals mentioned Brecht only\nbriefly in a footnote, see 487 F. 3d, at 673, n. 3, and then\nwent on to agree with Pulido’s alternative assertion that\n“the instructional error was structural and therefore not\nsubject to harmless error review,” id., at 675–676. The\ncourt also stated that the conviction had to be overturned\nunless the court was “absolutely certain” that the jury\nrelied on a valid ground. Id., at 676. Such a determina\ntion would appear to be a finding that no violation had\noccurred at all, rather than that any error was harmless.\nIn any event, an “absolute certainty” standard is plainly\ninconsistent with Brecht. Accordingly, we express no view\non whether Pulido is entitled to habeas relief, but rather\nremand to the Court of Appeals for application of Brecht in\nthe first instance.*\n   The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n——————\n  * The dissent maintains the Court of Appeals “undertook a searching\nreview of the parties’ evidence and the jury instructions to determine\nthe error’s effect on the jury.” Post, at 6 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But\nthe Court of Appeals reached its conclusion based solely on the exis\ntence of a typographical error in the special circumstances instructions,\nwithout addressing any of the State’s arguments that the typographical\nerror was harmless in light of the record as a whole. There was no need\nfor that court to address those arguments, of course, because of its\nmistaken conclusion that the instructional error was structural. Under\nsuch circumstances, remand is the appropriate course.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

United States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946),\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993), and O’Neal v.\nMcAninch, 513 U. S. 432 (1995). The Court of Appeals’\ndecision therefore did not warrant this Court’s review and\ndoes not now merit a remand to require that court to\nrepeat its analysis. In my opinion, the interest in expedit\ning the conclusion of this protracted litigation outweighs\nthe interest in correcting a misnomer.\n  Respondent Michael Pulido was charged with felony\nmurder for robbing a gas station and killing the attendant.\nAt trial, the State argued that Pulido acted alone. Pulido\nmaintained that his uncle was the principal actor and that\nhe had no knowledge of his uncle’s plan when the two\narrived at the gas station. While he was waiting in the\ncar, Pulido claimed, he heard a shot and ran into the store.\nAt that point, his uncle insisted that Pulido help him pry\nopen the stolen cash register and dispose of it, and Pulido\n2                  HEDGPETH v. PULIDO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nreluctantly complied. The jury convicted Pulido of felony\nmurder, but it was unable to reach a verdict on the\ncharges that Pulido personally used a firearm and inten\ntionally inflicted great bodily harm.\n   As a matter of California law, felony-murder liability\nextends to all persons jointly engaged in the commission of\na felony at the time of a killing when one of the joint ac\ntors kills in furtherance of the common design. People v.\nPulido, 15 Cal. 4th 713, 716, 936 P. 2d 1235, 1236 (1997).\nBut a person is not guilty of felony murder if he is only a\n“late-joining” aider and abettor—i.e., if he did not himself\ncommit the murder and his participation in the underlying\nfelony did not begin until after the victim was killed. Ibid.\nIn this case, the trial court’s instructions erroneously\npermitted the jury to find Pulido guilty on such a theory,\nas they did not require the jury to find either that Pulido\ncommitted the murder or that he aided and abetted the\nunderlying robbery before the murder was committed.\nBecause the instructions allowed the jury to convict Pulido\nof felony murder for conduct that does not amount to that\noffense, their inclusion was constitutional error.\n   On direct appeal, the California Supreme Court agreed\nwith Pulido that the late-joiner theory was an invalid\ntheory of felony-murder liability. Ibid. It nevertheless\nheld that any error in the trial court’s instructions was\nharmless. According to the court, the jury found that\nPulido had been engaged in the robbery at the time of the\nkilling because the robbery-murder special-circumstance\ninstruction stated that “the murder was committed while\nthe defendant was engaged” in the “commission of or at\ntempted commission of [a] robbery.” Id., at 727, 936 P. 2d,\nat 1243 (citing Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2(a)(17) (West\n1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Based on that\nportion of the instruction, the court concluded that the\nspecial-circumstance verdict “demonstrates that the jury\ndid not accept the theory that [Pulido] joined the robbery\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                  3\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nonly after [the victim] was killed,” and it therefore held\nthat Pulido was not prejudiced by the error. 15 Cal. 4th,\nat 727, 936 P. 2d, at 1244.\n   In reaching that conclusion, however, the California\nSupreme Court failed to take into account the entire spe\ncial-circumstance instruction. A typographical error in\nthat instruction in fact permitted the jury to find the\nspecial circumstance of robbery-murder true if it found\neither that the murder was committed while the defendant\nwas engaged in the commission of a robbery or that it “was\ncommitted in order to carry out or advance the commission\nof the crime of robbery or to facilitate the escape therefrom\nor to avoid detection”—a finding entirely consistent with\nthe late-joiner theory. App. 14. Thus, as the State con\ncedes, the erroneous instructions made it “reasonably\nlikely” that the jury convicted Pulido on the impermissible\ntheory. Brief for Petitioner 18.\n   After exhausting his state postconviction remedies,1\nPulido sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District\nCourt. The District Court recognized the erroneous dis\njunctive in the special-circumstance instruction that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court had overlooked, and it held that\nthe state court’s conclusion that Pulido was not prejudiced\nby erroneous instructions was “an objectively unreason\nable application of clearly established federal law.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 64a.\n   The District Court then considered the effect of that\nerror on the jury. Correctly relying on Brecht, the District\nCourt began its analysis by noting that a federal habeas\npetitioner “is not entitled to habeas relief unless the State\ncourt’s error resulted in actual prejudice, that is, the error\nhad a ‘substantial and injurious effect or influence in\n——————\n  1 The California Supreme Court summarily denied Pulido’s state\n\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus. See Pulido v. Chrones, 487 F. 3d\n669, 672 (CA9 2007) (per curiam).\n4                   HEDGPETH v. PULIDO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ndetermining the jury’s verdict.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a\n(quoting Brecht, 507 U. S., at 637). If an error had a sub\nstantial influence, or if “the record is so evenly balanced\nthat a conscientious judge is in ‘grave doubt’ ” as to\nwhether it had such an effect, the conviction must be\nreversed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. (quoting O’Neal, 513\nU. S., at 438).\n   To determine whether the error was harmless under\nthis standard, the District Court scrutinized the record,\nincluding the arguments of both parties, the evidence\nsupporting their respective theories of the case, the jury\ninstructions, the jury’s questions to the trial court, and the\nvarious parts of the jury’s verdict. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n65a–66a. Throughout this inquiry, the District Court\nproperly avoided substituting its judgment for the jury’s.\nAs we cautioned in Kotteakos, in undertaking harmless\nerror analysis “it is not the [reviewing] court’s function to\ndetermine guilt or innocence. Nor is it to speculate upon\nprobable reconviction and decide according to how the\nspeculation comes out.” 328 U. S., at 763 (citations omit\nted). Thus, “[t]he inquiry cannot be merely whether there\nwas enough to support the result” in the absence of the\nerror. Id., at 765. Rather, the proper question is “whether\nthe error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is\nleft in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.” Ibid.;\naccord, O’Neal, 513 U. S., at 437.\n   That was precisely the question addressed by the Dis\ntrict Court when it sought to ascertain what the jury\nactually found. The court concluded that, while it is “pos\nsible” that the jury found that Pulido aided and abetted\nthe robbery before the victim was killed, the court had “no\nway of determining whether this was the case.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 66a. Because that uncertainty left the court\nwith “ ‘grave doubt as to the likely effect of [the] error on\nthe jury’s verdict,’ ” it faithfully applied the standard\nmandated by Kotteakos and O’Neal and found that the\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nerror was not harmless. App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. (quot\ning O’Neal, 513 U. S., at 435).\n   On appeal, Pulido contended that the judgment of the\nDistrict Court should be affirmed whether the instruc\ntional error was viewed as structural error or as trial\nerror. Brief of Appellee and Cross-Appellant in Nos. 05–\n15916, 05–16308 (CA9), pp. 53–64 (hereinafter Appellee’s\nBrief). He argued that the error was not harmless under\nBrecht and O’Neal because the substantial evidence that\nsupported the invalid theory made it likely that the jury\nconvicted him on that basis. Appellee’s Brief 55–64. In\nparticular, Pulido noted that the “injurious effect” of this\ntype of error “is greatest when the instruction compro\nmises the defense by appearing to extend liability even to\nthe factual scenario suggested by the defense evidence,” as\nwas true in this case. Id., at 57 (internal quotation marks\nomitted and emphasis deleted). At oral argument, the\nparties’ contentions similarly focused on the Brecht stan\ndard and the result that harmless-error analysis required.\n   Less than two months after oral argument, and before\nthe Court of Appeals issued its decision in this case, a\ndifferent panel of the Ninth Circuit decided Lara v. Ryan,\n455 F. 3d 1080 (2006). Lara was convicted of attempted\nmurder by a jury that had been instructed that it could\nfind him guilty under either an express malice theory or\nan implied malice theory, the second of which is legally\ninvalid. Id., at 1082. The Ninth Circuit described the\nerroneous instruction as a “structural error,” but it held\nthat such an error does not necessitate reversal when a\nreviewing court can “determine with absolute certainty”\nthat the defendant was not convicted under the erroneous\ntheory. Id., at 1086. Because the jury “made a specific\nfinding that Lara attempted to murder willfully, deliber\nately, and with premeditation,” the court concluded that it\nnecessarily relied on the valid instruction and that rever\nsal was therefore not required. Id., at 1086–1087.\n6                      HEDGPETH v. PULIDO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  In those limited instances in which this Court has found\nan error “structural,” we have done so because the error\ndefies analysis by harmless-error standards. See Arizona\nv. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 309 (1991); see also United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 150 (2006) (quot\ning Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 282 (1993);\nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 659, and n. 25\n(1984)). Indeed, it is because the consequences “ ‘are nec\nessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate’ ” that auto\nmatic reversal is required when such errors occur. Gon\nzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S., at 150 (quoting Sullivan, 508 U. S.,\nat 282). That the court in Lara could be “ ‘absolutely\ncertain’ that the jury relied upon the legally correct the\nory,” 455 F. 3d, at 1085, shows both that the error was\nsusceptible of harmless-error analysis and that the court\nin fact found the error harmless despite repeatedly refer\nring to it as “structural.”\n  Citing Lara, the Court of Appeals’ per curiam opinion\nlabeled the erroneous instruction in this case a structural\nerror.2 As in Lara, the court then undertook a searching\nreview of the parties’ evidence and the jury instructions to\ndetermine the error’s effect on the jury. Noting, among\nother things, that “[t]he typographical error in the con\ntemporaneity instruction relied upon by the California\nSupreme Court introduces doubt into any inference to be\ndrawn from the jury’s finding as to the special circum\nstance,” the court concluded that “the jury instructions\nleave open the possibility that the jury convicted Pulido on\na legally impermissible theory.” Pulido v. Chrones, 487\n——————\n  2 The Court of Appeals’ opinion asserts that Pulido argued that the\n\nerror was structural under Lara v. Ryan, 455 F. 3d 1080 (CA9 2006).\nBut due to the timing of the Lara decision, the parties did not raise\narguments relying on that precedent until their postargument supple\nmental briefing. As discussed above, the parties’ arguments had\ninitially focused on the proper application of Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507\nU. S. 619 (1993).\n                      Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                     7\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nF. 3d 669, 676 (CA9 2007). That possibility of reliance on\nthe erroneous instruction is the “substantial and injurious\neffect” to which Brecht refers. Thus, although the Court of\nAppeals called the error in this case by the wrong name, it\nperformed substantially the same analysis and reached\nthe same conclusion as the District Court did when it\napplied the standard prescribed by Brecht.3\n   Judge Thomas concurred separately both to defend the\nLara decision and to demonstrate that harmless-error\nanalysis also supports the panel’s result. 487 F. 3d, at\n678–683. Unlike the District Court, Judge Thomas ap\nplied the harmless-error standard announced in Chapman\nv. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), instead of looking to\nBrecht. 487 F. 3d, at 678. But his analysis similarly\nestablishes that at least some jurors very likely relied on\nthe impermissible late-joiner theory. Id., at 679–683.\n   The record before us clearly supports that conclusion.\nIndeed, even petitioner admits that the ambiguity in the\nrobbery and murder instructions and the trial court’s\nconfusing answers to the jury’s questions “combined to\nmake it reasonably likely that the jury applied the in\nstructions in an unconstitutional way.” Brief for Peti\ntioner 18. That reasonable likelihood is sufficient to sup\nport the conclusion that the error was not harmless under\nBrecht.\n   Because the District Court’s analysis was correct and\nthe Court of Appeals’ result was substantially the same, I\nthink this Court’s decision to remand for the purpose of\nobtaining a third analysis of the harmless-error issue is a\nmisuse of scarce judicial resources. I would therefore\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n——————\n   3 The Court of Appeals in fact cited Brecht and recited the proper\n\nstandard in a footnote before turning its attention to Lara: “If there is a\nconstitutional error, we consider whether the error was harmless; that\nis, whether the error had a ‘ “substantial and injurious effect or influ\nence in determining the jury’s verdict.” ’ ” 487 F. 3d, at 673, n. 3.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145926/", "sha1": "50ba429db23a70fb3c7faccf3aaa0837f9de01bb", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-005", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:36"}
