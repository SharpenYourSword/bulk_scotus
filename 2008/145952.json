UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 07–818.   Decided June 23, 2008 \n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The\njudgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for\nfurther consideration in light of the position asserted by\nthe Solicitor General in his brief for the United States\nfiled May 12, 2008.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and\nJUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.\n   Petitioner pleaded guilty to federal narcotics offenses\nand waived appellate and collateral-review rights. De-\nspite that waiver, he demanded (the Court of Appeals\nassumed) that his attorney file a notice of appeal; his\nattorney refused. Petitioner sought habeas relief, claiming\nthat this failure was ineffective assistance of counsel. See\n495 F. 3d 544, 545 (CA7 2007). The District Court denied\nrelief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that\npetitioner had waived his right to raise even the ineffec-\ntive-assistance claim on collateral review. See id., at 546,\n548–549. Petitioner has filed a petition for a writ of cer-\ntiorari, asking us to consider the ineffective-assistance\nclaim. The Government argues in response that the ques-\ntion is not presented because the Court of Appeals’ opinion\nrests on petitioner’s collateral-review waiver. I agree with\nthat response, and so would deny the petition for writ of\ncertiorari.\n   Yet the Government urges us to GVR—to grant the\npetition, vacate the judgment, and remand the case to the\nCourt of Appeals—because it believes that the Court of\nAppeals misconstrued the scope of petitioner’s collateral-\n2                 NUNEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nreview waiver. A majority of the Court agrees to that\ncourse. I do not. In my view we have no power to set\naside (vacate) another court’s judgment unless we find it\nto be in error. See Mariscal v. United States, 449 U. S.\n405, 407 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Even so, I\nhave reluctantly acquiesced in our dubious yet well-\nentrenched habit of entering a GVR order without an\nindependent examination of the merits when the Govern-\nment, as respondent, confesses error in the judgment\nbelow. See Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 182–183\n(1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But because “we have no\npower to vacate a judgment that has not been shown to be\n(or been conceded to be) in error,” Price v. United States,\n537 U. S. 1152, 1153 (2003), I continue to resist GVR\ndisposition when the Government, without conceding that\na judgment is in error, merely suggests that the lower\ncourt’s basis for the judgment is wrong, see Lawrence,\nsupra, at 183, and n. 3; cf. Alvarado v. United States, 497\nU. S. 543, 545 (1990) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). That\ndescribes this case. The Government’s brief is entirely\nagnostic on the correctness of the Court of Appeals’ judg-\nment—i.e., its affirmance of the District Court’s denial of\nhabeas relief. Presumably, the Government believes the\njudgment is correct; it asked the Court of Appeals to af-\nfirm the District Court’s judgment the first time around,\nand presumably will do the same on remand.\n   To make matters worse, the Government’s suggestion\nthat the Court of Appeals erred in construing the scope of\npetitioner’s waiver is not even convincing. The collateral-\nreview waiver in petitioner’s plea agreement is inartfully\nworded; it is perhaps susceptible of the Government’s\nreading, but in my view the Court of Appeals’ reading is\nbetter. In any event, during his plea colloquy petitioner\norally agreed to a collateral-review waiver precisely in line\nwith the Court of Appeals’ position. Compare Brief for\nUnited States 3–4 (plea colloquy), with id., at 16–17 (plea\n                 Cite as: 554 U.

It is bad enough to upend the judgment of a\nlower court because the Solicitor General, while not saying\nthe judgment was wrong, opines that the expressed basis\nfor it was wrong; it is absurd to do this when the Solicitor\nGeneral’s gratuitous opinion is dubious on its face.\n  Finally, we should be especially reluctant to GVR on the\nSolicitor General’s say-so when, if that say-so is correct,\nthe likely consequence will be to create a conflict among\nthe Courts of Appeals. Before resting its judgment on\npetitioner’s collateral-review waiver, the Court of Appeals\nexpressed its unfavorable view of petitioner’s ineffective-\nassistance claim, recognizing, however, that its view con-\ntradicted the view of at least six other Courts of Appeals.\nSee 495 F. 3d, at 546–548. If, on remand, the Court of\nAppeals agrees with the Solicitor General that petitioner’s\ncollateral-review waiver does not preclude his claim, the\ncourt in all likelihood will enter the same judgment by\nrejecting petitioner’s ineffective-assistance claim, thereby\ncreating (absent reversal en banc) a split with those other\ncourts. I had thought that the main purpose of our certio-\nrari jurisdiction was to eliminate circuit splits, not to\ncreate them.\n  For all these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the\nCourt’s order.\n</pre>", "id": 145952, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2008/06/23/Nunez_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 554 U.
