On that same date, this Court granted\ncertiorari in Baze v. Rees, 551 U. S. ___ (2007), to consider\nthe constitutionality of Kentucky’s lethal injection proto-\ncol. As Emmett’s October 17th execution date approached\n(without a final decision having been rendered by the\nFourth Circuit), Emmett filed an application for a stay of\nexecution in this Court. We granted his application and\nentered a stay “pending final disposition of the appeal by\n2                  EMMETT v. JOHNSON\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\nor further order of this Court.” 552 U.

The Fourth Circuit has not rendered a final\ndisposition on the appeal, but it has acted swiftly in the\nmonth since we issued our decision in Baze; it requested\nadditional briefing on the impact of Baze the day after\nthat opinion issued, received those briefs on May 2, and\nheard oral argument on Wednesday, May 14. I therefore\nbelieve we should leave our stay in place until the Fourth\nCircuit has an adequate opportunity to render a decision\non the merits of Emmett’s claim. The parties’ filings with\nthis Court highlight the existence of factual disputes\nconcerning Virginia’s lethal injection protocol, including\nwhether it is substantially similar to the Kentucky proto-\ncol we declined to strike down in Baze. Because the\nFourth Circuit has the trial record before it, and also has\nthe benefit of extensive briefing and argument, it is in a\nsignificantly better position than we are to make these\nfactual judgments when it rules on the merits of Emmett’s\nappeal.\n  Although the parties are of course free to request a stay\nfrom the Fourth Circuit—a request that the court may\nwell grant in order to complete its consideration of Em-\nmett’s appeal without the pressure of a looming execution\ndate—I would not require the parties to shoulder the\nadditional burden of filing superfluous papers when sim-\nply leaving our stay in place until final disposition by the\nCourt of Appeals would also give the Fourth Circuit an\nopportunity to consider these important issues in the\nregular course.
