Two of the\nvictims’ daughters and two of their grandchildren testified\nabout the effects of the murders on themselves and their\nfamilies. During one daughter’s testimony the prosecution\nplayed a video containing 118 photographs of the victims\nat various stages of their lives, including their childhood\nand early years of marriage. The photographs showed the\ncouple raising their children, serving in the military,\nhunting, fishing, vacationing, bowling, celebrating holi\ndays and family events, and attending recognition dinners\nfor Gladys’s community service. “The last three photo\ngraphs in the montage showed, in order, Gladys’ grave\nmarker with the inscription readable, Elmer’s grave\nmarker with the inscription readable, and both grave\nmarkers from a distance, each accompanied by a vase of\nflowers.” Id., at 363, 181 P. 3d, at 134.\n   In both cases the California Supreme Court upheld the\nadmissibility of the videos. The court explained that the\nvideo admitted during Kelly’s sentencing “expressed no\noutrage” and contained no “clarion call for vengeance,” but\n“just implied sadness.” 42 Cal. 4th, at 797, 171 P. 3d, at\n558.

No member of the court suggested that the evidence\nshed any light on the character of the offense, the charac\nter of the offender, or the defendant’s moral culpability.\n\n                                   I\n   Victim impact evidence made its first appearance in this\nCourt’s jurisprudence in 1987. Booth v. Maryland, 482\nU. S. 496 (1987).2 In earlier landmark cases, such as\nWilliams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949), and Lockett v.\nOhio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), evidence probative of the cul\npability and character of the offender and the circum\nstances of the offense had marked the outer limits of the\nkind of evidence admissible in capital sentencing. Consis\ntent with that precedent, in our first encounter with vic\ntim impact evidence, the Court announced a rule that\ncategorically “prohibit[ed] a capital jury from considering\nvictim impact evidence” that “described the personal\ncharacteristics of the victims and the emotional impact of\nthe crimes on the family.” Booth, 482 U. S., at 501–502. It\nwas the unique character of the death penalty that justi\nfied Booth’s per se rule: The opinion relied on the fact that\ndeath is a “punishment different from all other sanctions,”\n\n——————\n  2 Victim impact evidence is a category unmentioned by Wigmore’s\n\ntreatise or other classic works on the law of evidence. Its inclusion in\nboth capital and noncapital cases is a phenomenon of recent origin,\narising out of the victims’ rights movement of the late 1970’s. See\nCarrington & Nicholson, The Victims’ Movement: An Idea Whose Time\nHas Come, 11 Pepperdine L. Rev. 1, 8 (Symposium 1984) (describing\nearly victories of the victims’ rights movement, including passage of the\nOmnibus Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 1248,\nwhich mandated the inclusion of victim impact statements in federal\npresentence reports); MacDonald, Towards a Bicentennial Revolution\nin Criminal Justice: The Return of the Victim, 13 Am. Crim. L. Rev.\n649, 670 (1975—1976) (describing early “innovative” attempts to\nintegrate victims into the sentencing process).\n4                  KELLY v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                   Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\nid., at 509, n. 12, and on our earlier admonition that any\ndecision to impose the death sentence must “ ‘be, and\nappear to be, based on reason rather than caprice or emo\ntion,’ ” id., at 508 (quoting Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S.\n349, 358 (1977) (opinion of STEVENS, J.)).\n   Throughout the late 1970’s and for much of the follow\ning decade, the fact that “death is a different kind of pun\nishment from any other that may be imposed in this coun\ntry,” id., at 357, had justified placing limits on its\npermissible applications, see, e.g., Godfrey v. Georgia, 446\nU. S. 420, 433 (1980) (plurality opinion), and requiring\nspecial procedural protections for the defendant, see\nLockett, 438 U. S., at 604 (plurality opinion). Our decision\nin Booth flowed naturally from the same principle.\n   Beginning in the late 1980’s, however, changes in the\nCourt’s capital jurisprudence began to weaken the proce\ndural and substantive safeguards on which we had earlier\ninsisted. In Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137 (1987), rather\nthan adhere to the rule announced in Enmund v. Florida,\n458 U. S. 782 (1982), which prohibited death sentences for\ndefendants who neither killed nor intended to kill a vic\ntim, a majority of the Court held that felony murder could\nqualify as a capital offense. Soon thereafter, the Court\nrejected a challenge to a death sentence based on evidence\nthat a victim’s race enhanced the likelihood that a Georgia\njury would impose the death penalty. McCleskey v. Kemp,\n481 U. S. 279 (1987). As Justice Blackmun presciently\nobserved, the fact that “death is different” was fast becom\ning a justification for applying “a lesser standard of scru\ntiny” in capital cases. See id., at 347, 348 (dissenting\nopinion).\n   Confirming that observation, the Court’s 1991 opinion in\nPayne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, overruled Booth in\nshort order, giving prosecutors a powerful new weapon in\ncapital cases. At issue in Payne was the admission of\npenalty phase testimony by the mother of a deceased\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                   Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\nvictim. The woman testified about the effect of the crime\non her surviving grandson, who had witnessed the murder\nof his mother and baby sister and had himself nearly been\nkilled by the same attack. Her testimony powerfully\nconveyed her grandson’s suffering, but “she[d] no light on\nthe defendant’s guilt or moral culpability.” Id., at 856\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). By its very poignancy, the\ntestimony “encourage[d] jurors to decide in favor of death\nrather than life on the basis of their emotions rather than\ntheir reason.” Ibid. Yet, despite the inherent danger\nposed by such testimony, the Court rejected Booth’s per se\nrule barring the admissibility of victim impact evidence in\ncapital proceedings. Declaring such evidence to be “simply\nanother form or method of informing the sentencing au\nthority about the specific harm caused by the crime in\nquestion,” 501 U. S., at 825, the Court held that prosecu\ntors should be permitted to present evidence “offering a\nquick glimpse of the life which [the] defendant chose to\nextinguish” and “demonstrating the loss to the victim’s\nfamily and to society . . . result[ing] from the defendant’s\nhomicide,” id., at 822 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Given Payne’s sharp retreat from prior precedent, it is\nsurprising that neither the opinion of the Court nor any of\nthe concurring opinions made a serious attempt to define\nor otherwise constrain the category of admissible victim\nimpact evidence. Instead, the Court merely gestured\ntoward a standard, noting that, “[i]n the event that evi\ndence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it\nrenders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mecha\nnism for relief.” Id., at 825. That statement represents\nthe beginning and end of the guidance we have given to\nlower courts considering the admissibility of victim impact\nevidence in the first instance.\n6                      KELLY v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                       Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\n                                  II\n  In the years since Payne was decided, this Court has left\nstate and federal courts unguided in their efforts to police\nthe hazy boundaries between permissible victim impact\nevidence and its impermissible, “unduly prejudicial”\nforms. Following Payne’s model, lower courts throughout\nthe country have largely failed to place clear limits on the\nscope, quantity, or kind of victim impact evidence capital\njuries are permitted to consider. See generally, Logan,\nThrough the Past Darkly: A Survey of the Uses and\nAbuses of Victim Impact Evidence in Capital Trials, 41\nAriz. L. Rev. 143 (1999). Not only have courts allowed\ncapital sentencing juries to hear brief oral or written\ntestimony from close family members regarding victims\nand the direct impact of their deaths; they have also al\nlowed testimony from friends, neighbors, and co-workers\nin the form of poems, photographs, hand-crafted items,\nand—as occurred in these cases—multimedia video pres\nentations. See Blume, Ten Years of Payne: Victim Impact\nEvidence in Capital Cases, 88 Cornell L. Rev. 257, 271–\n272 (2003) (collecting cases).\n  Victim impact evidence is powerful in any form.3 But in\neach of these cases, the evidence was especially prejudi\ncial. Although the video shown to each jury was emotion\n——————\n  3 As one Federal District Judge put it, “I cannot help but wonder if\n\nPayne . . . would have been decided in the same way if the Supreme\nCourt Justices in the majority had ever sat as trial judges in a federal\ndeath penalty case and had observed first hand, rather than through\nreview of a cold record, the unsurpassed emotional power of victim\nimpact testimony on a jury. It has now been over four months since I\nheard this testimony [in a codefendant’s case] and the juror’s sobbing\nduring the victim impact testimony still rings in my ears. This is true\neven though the federal prosecutors in [the case] used admirable\nrestraint in terms of the scope, amount, and length of victim impact\ntestimony.” United States v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2453631\"><a href=\"/opinion/2453631/united-states-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                   Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\nally evocative, it was not probative of the culpability or\ncharacter of the offender or the circumstances of the of\nfense. Nor was the evidence particularly probative of the\nimpact of the crimes on the victims’ family members: The\npictures and video footage shown to the juries portrayed\nevents that occurred long before the respective crimes\nwere committed and that bore no direct relation to the\neffect of crime on the victims’ family members.\n   Equally troubling is the form in which the evidence was\npresented. As these cases demonstrate, when victim\nimpact evidence is enhanced with music, photographs, or\nvideo footage, the risk of unfair prejudice quickly becomes\noverwhelming. While the video tributes at issue in these\ncases contained moving portrayals of the lives of the vic\ntims, their primary, if not sole, effect was to rouse jurors’\nsympathy for the victims and increase jurors’ antipathy\nfor the capital defendants. The videos added nothing\nrelevant to the jury’s deliberations and invited a verdict\nbased on sentiment, rather than reasoned judgment.\n   I remain convinced that the views expressed in my\ndissent in Payne are sound, and that the per se rule an\nnounced in Booth is both wiser and more faithful to the\nrule of law than the untethered jurisprudence that has\nemerged over the past two decades. Yet even under the\nrule announced in Payne, the prosecution’s ability to admit\nsuch powerful and prejudicial evidence is not boundless.\n   These videos are a far cry from the written victim im\npact evidence at issue in Booth and the brief oral testi\nmony condoned in Payne. In their form, length, and scope,\nthey vastly exceed the “quick glimpse” the Court’s major\nity contemplated when it overruled Booth in 1991. At the\nvery least, the petitions now before us invite the Court to\napply the standard announced in Payne, and to provide\nthe lower courts with long-overdue guidance on the scope\nof admissible victim impact evidence.

S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                   Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\nvictim. The woman testified about the effect of the crime\non her surviving grandson, who had witnessed the murder\nof his mother and baby sister and had himself nearly been\nkilled by the same attack. Her testimony powerfully\nconveyed her grandson’s suffering, but “she[d] no light on\nthe defendant’s guilt or moral culpability.” Id., at 856\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). By its very poignancy, the\ntestimony “encourage[d] jurors to decide in favor of death\nrather than life on the basis of their emotions rather than\ntheir reason.” Ibid. Yet, despite the inherent danger\nposed by such testimony, the Court rejected Booth’s per se\nrule barring the admissibility of victim impact evidence in\ncapital proceedings. Declaring such evidence to be “simply\nanother form or method of informing the sentencing au\nthority about the specific harm caused by the crime in\nquestion,” 501 U. S., at 825, the Court held that prosecu\ntors should be permitted to present evidence “offering a\nquick glimpse of the life which [the] defendant chose to\nextinguish” and “demonstrating the loss to the victim’s\nfamily and to society . . . result[ing] from the defendant’s\nhomicide,” id., at 822 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Given Payne’s sharp retreat from prior precedent, it is\nsurprising that neither the opinion of the Court nor any of\nthe concurring opinions made a serious attempt to define\nor otherwise constrain the category of admissible victim\nimpact evidence. Instead, the Court merely gestured\ntoward a standard, noting that, “[i]n the event that evi\ndence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it\nrenders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mecha\nnism for relief.” Id., at 825. That statement represents\nthe beginning and end of the guidance we have given to\nlower courts considering the admissibility of victim impact\nevidence in the first instance.\n6                      KELLY v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                       Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\n                                  II\n  In the years since Payne was decided, this Court has left\nstate and federal courts unguided in their efforts to police\nthe hazy boundaries between permissible victim impact\nevidence and its impermissible, “unduly prejudicial”\nforms. Following Payne’s model, lower courts throughout\nthe country have largely failed to place clear limits on the\nscope, quantity, or kind of victim impact evidence capital\njuries are permitted to consider. See generally, Logan,\nThrough the Past Darkly: A Survey of the Uses and\nAbuses of Victim Impact Evidence in Capital Trials, 41\nAriz. L. Rev. 143 (1999). Not only have courts allowed\ncapital sentencing juries to hear brief oral or written\ntestimony from close family members regarding victims\nand the direct impact of their deaths; they have also al\nlowed testimony from friends, neighbors, and co-workers\nin the form of poems, photographs, hand-crafted items,\nand—as occurred in these cases—multimedia video pres\nentations. See Blume, Ten Years of Payne: Victim Impact\nEvidence in Capital Cases, 88 Cornell L. Rev. 257, 271–\n272 (2003) (collecting cases).\n  Victim impact evidence is powerful in any form.3 But in\neach of these cases, the evidence was especially prejudi\ncial. Although the video shown to each jury was emotion\n——————\n  3 As one Federal District Judge put it, “I cannot help but wonder if\n\nPayne . . . would have been decided in the same way if the Supreme\nCourt Justices in the majority had ever sat as trial judges in a federal\ndeath penalty case and had observed first hand, rather than through\nreview of a cold record, the unsurpassed emotional power of victim\nimpact testimony on a jury. It has now been over four months since I\nheard this testimony [in a codefendant’s case] and the juror’s sobbing\nduring the victim impact testimony still rings in my ears. This is true\neven though the federal prosecutors in [the case] used admirable\nrestraint in terms of the scope, amount, and length of victim impact\ntestimony.” United States v. Johnson, 362 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1107 (ND\nIowa 2005).\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                   Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\nally evocative, it was not probative of the culpability or\ncharacter of the offender or the circumstances of the of\nfense. Nor was the evidence particularly probative of the\nimpact of the crimes on the victims’ family members: The\npictures and video footage shown to the juries portrayed\nevents that occurred long before the respective crimes\nwere committed and that bore no direct relation to the\neffect of crime on the victims’ family members.\n   Equally troubling is the form in which the evidence was\npresented. As these cases demonstrate, when victim\nimpact evidence is enhanced with music, photographs, or\nvideo footage, the risk of unfair prejudice quickly becomes\noverwhelming. While the video tributes at issue in these\ncases contained moving portrayals of the lives of the vic\ntims, their primary, if not sole, effect was to rouse jurors’\nsympathy for the victims and increase jurors’ antipathy\nfor the capital defendants. The videos added nothing\nrelevant to the jury’s deliberations and invited a verdict\nbased on sentiment, rather than reasoned judgment.\n   I remain convinced that the views expressed in my\ndissent in Payne are sound, and that the per se rule an\nnounced in Booth is both wiser and more faithful to the\nrule of law than the untethered jurisprudence that has\nemerged over the past two decades. Yet even under the\nrule announced in Payne, the prosecution’s ability to admit\nsuch powerful and prejudicial evidence is not boundless.\n   These videos are a far cry from the written victim im\npact evidence at issue in Booth and the brief oral testi\nmony condoned in Payne. In their form, length, and scope,\nthey vastly exceed the “quick glimpse” the Court’s major\nity contemplated when it overruled Booth in 1991. At the\nvery least, the petitions now before us invite the Court to\napply the standard announced in Payne, and to provide\nthe lower courts with long-overdue guidance on the scope\nof admissible victim impact evidence.
