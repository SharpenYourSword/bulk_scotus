Argued March 2, 2009—Decided June 25, 2009\nAtlantic Sounding Co. allegedly refused to pay maintenance and cure to\n  respondent Townsend for injuries he suffered while working on its\n  tugboat, and then filed this declaratory relief action regarding its ob\n  ligations. Townsend filed suit under the Jones Act and general mari\n  time law, alleging, inter alia, arbitrary and willful failure to provide\n  maintenance and cure. He filed similar counterclaims in the declara\n  tory judgment action, seeking punitive damages for the maintenance\n  and cure claim. The District Court denied petitioners’ motion to dis\n  miss the punitive damages claim, but certified the question for inter\n  locutory appeal. Following its precedent, the Eleventh Circuit held\n  that punitive damages may be awarded for the willful withholding of\n  maintenance and cure.\nHeld: Because punitive damages have long been an accepted remedy\n under general maritime law, and because neither Miles v. Apex Ma\n rine Corp., 498 U. S. 19, nor the Jones Act altered this understand\n ing, punitive damages for the willful and wanton disregard of the\n maintenance and cure obligation remain available as a matter of\n general maritime law. Pp. 2–19.\n    (a) Settled legal principles establish three points central to this\n case. Pp. 2–9.\n      (i) Punitive damages have long been an available remedy at\n common law for wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct. English law\n during the colonial era accorded juries the authority to award such\n damages when warranted. And American courts have likewise per\n mitted such damages since at least 1784. This Court has also found\n punitive damages authorized as a matter of common-law doctrine.\n See, e.g., Day v. Woodworth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86749\"><a href=\"/opinion/86749/day-v-woodworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

See Lake Shore & Michi\n    gan Southern R. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U. S. 101, 108. One of this\n    Court’s first cases so indicating involved an action for marine tres\n    pass.

And lower federal\n    courts have found punitive damages available in maritime actions for\n    particularly egregious tortious acts. Pp. 5–6.\n         (iii) Nothing in maritime law undermines this general rule’s ap\n    plicability in the maintenance and cure context. The maintenance\n    and cure obligation dates back centuries as an aspect of general\n    maritime law, and the failure of a seaman’s employers to provide\n    adequate medical care was the basis for awarding punitive damages\n    in cases decided in the 1800’s. This Court has since registered its\n    agreement with such decisions and has subsequently found that in\n    addition to wages, “maintenance” includes food and lodging at the\n    ship’s expense, and “cure” refers to medical treatment, Lewis v. Lewis\n    & Clark Marine, Inc., 531 U. S. 438, 441. Moreover, an owner’s fail\n    ure to provide proper medical care for seamen has provided lower\n    courts the impetus to award damages that appear to contain at least\n    some punitive element. Pp. 7–8.\n         (iv) Under these settled legal principles, respondent is entitled to\n    pursue punitive damages unless Congress has enacted legislation\n    that departs from the common-law understanding. P. 9.\n       (b) The plain language of the Jones Act does not provide a basis for\n    overturning the common-law rule. Congress enacted the Jones Act to\n    overrule The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, where the Court prohibited a\n    seaman or his family from recovering for injuries or death suffered\n    due to his employers’ negligence. To that end, the Act created a\n    statutory negligence cause of action, but it did not eliminate pre\n    existing remedies available to seamen for the separate common-law\n    cause of action based on maintenance and cure. The Act bestows the\n    right to “elect” to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby indicating a choice\n    of actions for seamen—not an exclusive remedy. Because the then\n    accepted remedies arose from general maritime law, it necessarily\n    follows that Congress envisioned their continued availability. See\n    Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354. Had the Jones Act been\n    the only remaining remedy available, there would have been no elec\n    tion to make. And, the only statutory restrictions on general mari\n    time maintenance and cure claims were enacted long after the Jones\n    Act’s passage and limit availability for only two discrete\n    classes: foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production facili\n    ties and sailing school students and instructors. This indicates that\n    “Congress knows how to” restrict the traditional maintenance and\n    cure remedy “when it wants to.” Omni Capital Int’l, Ltd. v. Rudolf\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                             Syllabus\n\nWolff & Co., 484 U. S. 97, 106. This Court has consistently observed\nthat the Jones Act preserves common-law causes of action such as\nmaintenance and cure, see. e.g., The Arizona v. Anelich, 298 U. S.\n110, and its case law supports the view that punitive damages\nawards, in particular, continue to remain available in maintenance\nand cure actions, see Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U. S. 527. Pp. 9–13.\n     (i) Contrary to petitioners’ argument, Miles does not limit recov\nery to the remedies available under the Jones Act. Miles does not\naddress either maintenance and cure actions in general or the avail\nability of punitive damages for such actions. Instead, it grappled\nwith the entirely different question whether general maritime law\nshould provide a cause of action for wrongful death based on unsea\nworthiness. The Court found that the Jones Act and the Death on\nthe High Seas Act (DOHSA), along with state statutes, supported\nrecognition of a general maritime rule for wrongful death of a sea\nman. However, since Congress had chosen to limit the damages\navailable in the Jones Act and DOHSA, excluding damages for loss of\nsociety or lost future earnings, 498 U. S., at 21, 31–32, its judgment\nmust control the availability of remedies for wrongful-death actions\nbrought under general maritime law, id., at 32–36. Miles’ reasoning\ndoes not apply here. Unlike Miles’ situation, both the general mari\ntime cause of action here (maintenance and cure) and the remedy\n(punitive damages) were well established before the Jones Act’s pas\nsage. And unlike Miles’ facts, the Jones Act does not address the\ngeneral maritime cause of action here or its remedy. It is thus possi\nble to adhere to the traditional understanding of maritime actions\nand remedies without abridging or violating the Jones Act; unlike\nwrongful-death actions, this traditional understanding is not a mat\nter to which “Congress has spoken directly.” See id., at 31. More\nover, petitioners’ contrary view was directly rejected in Norfolk Ship\nbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. Garris, 532 U. S. 811, 820. If Miles\npresented no barrier to the Garris Court’s endorsement of a previ\nously unrecognized maritime cause of action for negligent wrongful\ndeath, there is no legitimate basis for a contrary conclusion here.\nLike negligence, the duty of maintenance and cure and the general\navailability of punitive damages have been recognized “for more than\na century,” 532 U. S., at 820. And because respondent does not ask\nthis Court to alter statutory text or “expand” the maritime tort law’s\ngeneral principles, Miles does not require eliminating the general\nmaritime remedy of punitive damages for the willful or wanton fail\nure to comply with the duty to pay maintenance and cure. The fact\nthat seamen commonly seek to recover under the Jones Act for main\ntenance and cure claims, does not mean that the Jones Act provides\nthe only remedy. See Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S.\n4             ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n    367, 374–375.

Apex Marine Corp.,\n498 U. S. 19 (1990), seamen may recover only those dam\nages available under the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. §30104.\nWe disagree. Historically, punitive damages have been\navailable and awarded in general maritime actions,\nincluding some in maintenance and cure.         We find\nthat nothing in Miles or the Jones Act eliminates that\navailability.\n                             I\n  Respondent Edgar L. Townsend was a crew member of\nthe Motor Tug Thomas.

See 496 F. 3d 1282, 1283 (CA11 2007).\n“A claim for maintenance and cure concerns the vessel\nowner’s obligation to provide food, lodging, and medical\nservices to a seaman injured while serving the ship.”\nLewis v. Lewis & Clark Marine, Inc., 531 U. S. 438, 441\n(2001).\n  Petitioners thereafter filed an action for declaratory\nrelief regarding their obligations with respect to mainte\nnance and cure. Respondent filed his own suit under the\nJones Act and general maritime law, alleging negligence,\nunseaworthiness, arbitrary and willful failure to pay\nmaintenance and cure, and wrongful termination. In\naddition, respondent filed similar counterclaims in the\ndeclaratory judgment action, seeking punitive damages for\nthe denial of maintenance and cure. The District Court\nconsolidated the cases. See 496 F. 3d, at 1283–1284.\n  Petitioners moved to dismiss respondent’s punitive\ndamages claim. The District Court denied the motion,\nholding that it was bound by the determination in Hines v.\nJ. A. LaPorte, Inc., 820 F. 2d 1187, 1189 (CA11 1987) (per\ncuriam), that punitive damages were available in an\naction for maintenance and cure. The court, however,\nagreed to certify the question for interlocutory appeal. See\n496 F. 3d, at 1284. The United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that\nHines controlled and held that respondent could pursue\nhis punitive damages claim for the willful withholding of\nmaintenance and cure. 496 F. 3d, at 1285–1286. The\ndecision conflicted with those of other Courts of Appeals,\nsee, e.g., Guevara v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 59 F. 3d\n1496 (CA5 1995) (en banc); Glynn v.

See, e.g., Lord Townsend v. Hughes, 2 Mod. 150, 86\nEng. Rep. 994 (C. P. 1676) (“[I]n civil actions the plaintiff\nis to recover by way of compensation for the damages he\nhath sustained, and the jury are the proper judges\nthereof” (emphasis in original)); 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of\nDamages §349, p. 688 (9th ed. 1912) (hereinafter Sedg\nwick) (“Until comparatively recent times juries were as\narbitrary judges of the amount of damages as of the\nfacts”). The common-law view “was that ‘in cases where\nthe amount of damages was uncertain[,] their assessment\nwas a matter so peculiarly within the province of the jury\nthat the Court should not alter it.’ ” Feltner v. Columbia\nPictures Television, Inc., 523 U. S. 340, 353 (1998) (quoting\nDimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 480 (1935); alteration in\noriginal).\n   The jury’s broad discretion to set damages included the\nauthority to award punitive damages when the circum\nstances of the case warranted. Just before the ratification\nof the Constitution, Lord Chief Justice Pratt explained\nthat “a jury ha[s] it in [its] power to give damages for more\nthan the injury received. Damages are designed not only\nas a satisfaction to the injured person, but likewise as a\npunishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceed\ning for the future, and as a proof of the detestation of the\njury to the action itself.” Wilkes v. Wood, Lofft 1, 18–19,\n98 Eng. Rep. 489, 498–499 (C. P. 1763); see also Pacific\nMut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 25 (1991) (SCALIA,\n4          ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v.

P. 1763) (declining to grant a new trial because the\njury “ha[s] done right in giving exemplary damages”).\n    American courts have likewise permitted punitive dam\nages awards in appropriate cases since at least 1784. See,\ne.g., Genay v. Norris, 1 S. C. L. 6, 7 (C. P. and Gen. Sess.\n1784) (approving award of “very exemplary damages”\nbecause spiking wine represented a “very wanton out\nrage”); Coryell v. Colbaugh, 1 N. J. L. 77 (1791) (conclud\ning that a breach of promise of marriage was “of the most\natrocious and dishonourable nature” and supported “dam\nages for example’s sake, to prevent such offences in future”\n(emphasis in original)). Although some States elected not\nto allow juries to make such awards, the vast majority\npermitted them. See 1 Sedgwick §§352, 354, at 694, 700.\nBy the middle of the 19th century, “punitive damages were\nundoubtedly an established part of the American common\nlaw of torts [and] no particular procedures were deemed\nnecessary to circumscribe a jury’s discretion regarding the\naward of such damages, or their amount.” Haslip, supra,\nat 26–27 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\n    This Court has also found the award of punitive dam\nages to be authorized as a matter of common-law doctrine.\nIn Day v.

In the course of deciding whether to uphold\nthe jury’s award, Justice Story, writing for the Court,\nrecognized that punitive damages are an available mari\ntime remedy under the proper circumstances. Although\nthe Court found that the particular facts of the case did\nnot warrant such an award against the named defendants,\nit explained that “if this were a suit against the original\nwrong-doers, it might be proper to . . . visit upon them in\nthe shape of exemplary damages, the proper punishment\nwhich belongs to such lawless misconduct.” Id., at 558;\nsee also Barry, supra, at 563 (“In The Amiable Nancy,\nwhich was the case of a marine tort, Mr. Justice Story\nspoke of exemplary damages as ‘the proper punish\nment which belongs to . . . lawless misconduct’ ” (citation\nomitted)).\n   The lower federal courts followed suit, finding that\npunitive damages were available in maritime actions for\ntortious acts of a particularly egregious nature.

Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty §6–13,\np. 312 (2d ed. 1975) (hereinafter Gilmore & Black) (ex\nplaining that a seaman denied maintenance and cure “has\na free option to claim damages (including punitive dam\nages) under a general maritime law count”); Robertson 163\n(concluding that breach of maintenance and cure is one of\nthe particular torts for which general maritime law would\nmost likely permit the awarding of punitive damages\n“assuming . . . the requisite level of blameworthiness”).\nIndeed, the legal obligation to provide maintenance and\ncure dates back centuries as an aspect of general maritime\nlaw, and the failure of a seaman’s employers to provide\nhim with adequate medical care was the basis for award\ning punitive damages in cases decided as early as the\n1800’s.\n   The right to receive maintenance and cure was first\nrecognized in this country in two lower court decisions\nauthored by Justice Story. See Harden v. Gordon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

According to\nJustice Story, this common-law obligation to seamen was\njustified on humanitarian and economic grounds: “If some\nprovision be not made for [seamen] in sickness at the\nexpense of the ship, they must often in foreign ports suffer\nthe accumulated evils of disease, and poverty, and some\ntimes perish from the want of suitable nourishment. . . .\n[T]he merchant himself derives an ultimate benefit [be\ncause i]t encourages seamen to engage in perilous voyages\nwith more promptitude, and at lower wages.” Harden,\nsupra, at 483; see also Reed, supra, at 429 (“The seaman is\nto be cured at the expense of the ship, of the sickness or\ninjury sustained in the ship’s service”).\n   This Court has since registered its agreement with these\n8           ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ndecisions. “Upon a full review . . . of English and Ameri\ncan authorities,” the Court concluded that “the vessel and\nher owners are liable, in case a seaman falls sick, or is\nwounded, in the service of the ship, to the extent of his\nmaintenance and cure, and to his wages, at least so long\nas the voyage is continued.” The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158,\n175 (1903). Decisions following The Osceola have ex\nplained that in addition to wages, “maintenance” includes\nfood and lodging at the expense of their ship, and “cure”\nrefers to medical treatment. Lewis, 531 U. S., at 441; see\nalso Gilmore & Black §6–12, at 267–268 (describing\n“maintenance and cure” as including medical expenses, a\nliving allowance, and unearned wages).\n   In addition, the failure of a vessel owner to provide\nproper medical care for seamen has provided the impetus\nfor damages awards that appear to contain at least some\npunitive element. For example, in The City of Carlisle, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (DC Ore. 1889), the court added $1,000 to its dam\nages award to compensate an apprentice seaman for “gross\nneglect and cruel maltreatment of the [seaman] since his\ninjury.” Id., at 809, 817. The court reviewed the indigni\nties to which the apprentice had been subjected as he\nrecovered without any serious medical attention, see id.,\nat 810–812, and explained that “if owners do not wish to\nbe mulct in damages for such misconduct, they should be\ncareful to select men worthy to command their vessels and\nfit to be trusted with the safety and welfare of their crews,\nand particularly apprentice boys.” Id., at 817; see also The\nTroop, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">769</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 770–771, 773 (DC Wash. 1902) (ex\nplaining that $4,000 was a reasonable award because the\ncaptain’s “failure to observe the dictates of humanity” and\nobtain prompt medical care for an injured seaman consti\ntuted a “monstrous wrong”).3\n——————\n  3 Although these cases do not refer to “punitive” or “exemplary” dam\n\nages, scholars have characterized the awards authorized by these\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

First, punitive\ndamages have long been available at common law. Sec\nond, the common-law tradition of punitive damages ex\ntends to maritime claims.4 And third, there is no evidence\nthat claims for maintenance and cure were excluded from\nthis general admiralty rule. Instead, the pre-Jones Act\nevidence indicates that punitive damages remain available\nfor such claims under the appropriate factual circum\nstances. As a result, respondent is entitled to pursue\npunitive damages unless Congress has enacted legislation\ndeparting from this common-law understanding. As ex\nplained below, it has not.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  The only statute that could serve as a basis for overturn\ning the common-law rule in this case is the Jones Act.\nCongress enacted the Jones Act primarily to overrule The\nOsceola, supra, in which this Court prohibited a seaman or\nhis family from recovering for injuries or death suffered\n——————\ndecisions as such. See Robertson 103–105; Edelman, Guevara v.\nMaritime Overseas Corp.: Opposing the Decision, 20 Tulane Mar. L. J.\n349, 351, and n. 22 (1996).\n  4 The dissent correctly notes that the handful of early cases involving\n\nmaintenance and cure, by themselves, do not definitively resolve the\nquestion of punitive damages availability in such cases. See post, at 6–\n8 (opinion of ALITO, J.). However, it neglects to acknowledge that the\ngeneral common-law rule made punitive damages available in maritime\nactions. See supra, at 5–6. Nor does the dissent explain why mainte\nnance and cure actions should be excepted from this general rule. It is\nbecause of this rule, and the fact that these early cases support—rather\nthan refute—its application to maintenance and cure actions, see\nsupra, at 7–8, that the pre-Jones Act evidence supports the conclusion\nthat punitive damages were available at common law where the denial\nof maintenance and cure involved wanton, willful, or outrageous\nconduct.\n10         ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndue to his employers’ negligence. To this end, the statute\nprovides in relevant part:\n     “A seaman injured in the course of employment or, if\n     the seaman dies from the injury, the personal repre\n     sentative of the seaman may elect to bring a civil ac\n     tion at law, with the right of trial by jury, against the\n     employer. Laws of the United States regulating re\n     covery for personal injury to, or death of, a railway\n     employee apply to an action under this section.” 46\n     U. S. C. §30104(a) (incorporating the Federal Employ\n     ers’ Liability Act, 45 U. S. C. §§51–60).\n   The Jones Act thus created a statutory cause of action\nfor negligence, but it did not eliminate pre-existing reme\ndies available to seamen for the separate common-law\ncause of action based on a seaman’s right to maintenance\nand cure. Section 30104 bestows upon the injured seaman\nthe right to “elect” to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby\nindicating a choice of actions for seamen—not an exclusive\nremedy. See Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary\nof the English Language 798 (1913) (defining “elect” as\n“[t]o make choice of”); 1 Bouvier’s Law Dictionary 979 (8th\ned. 1914) (defining “election” as “[c]hoice; selection”).\nBecause the then-accepted remedies for injured seamen\narose from general maritime law, see The Osceola, supra,\nat 175, it necessarily follows that Congress was envision\ning the continued availability of those common-law causes\nof action. See Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354\n(1995) (“Congress enacted the Jones Act in 1920 to remove\nthe bar to suit for negligence articulated in The Osceola,\nthereby completing the trilogy of heightened legal protec\ntions [including maintenance and cure] that seamen re\nceive because of their exposure to the perils of the sea”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); Stewart v. Dutra\nConstr. Co., 543 U. S. 481, 487 (2005) (describing the\nJones Act as “remov[ing] this bar to negligence suits by\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nseamen”). If the Jones Act had been the only remaining\nremedy available to injured seamen, there would have\nbeen no election to make.\n   In addition, the only statutory restrictions expressly\naddressing general maritime claims for maintenance and\ncure were enacted long after the passage of the Jones Act.\nThey limit its availability for two discrete classes of peo\nple: foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production\nfacilities, see §503(a)(2), 96 Stat. 1955, codified at 46\nU. S. C. §30105(b), and sailing school students and in\nstructors, §204, 96 Stat. 1589, codified at 46 U. S. C.\n§50504(b).     These provisions indicate that “Congress\nknows how to” restrict the traditional remedy of mainte\nnance and cure “when it wants to.” Omni Capital Int’l,\nLtd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U. S. 97, 106 (1987). Thus,\nnothing in the statutory scheme for maritime recovery\nrestricts the availability of punitive damages for mainte\nnance and cure for those, like respondent, who are not\nprecluded from asserting the general maritime claim.\n   Further supporting this interpretation of the Jones Act,\nthis Court has consistently recognized that the Act “was\nremedial, for the benefit and protection of seamen who are\npeculiarly the wards of admiralty. Its purpose was to\nenlarge that protection, not to narrow it.” The Arizona v.\nAnelich, 298 U. S. 110, 123 (1936); see also American\nExport Lines, Inc. v. Alvez, 446 U. S. 274, 282 (1980) (plu\nrality opinion) (declining to “read the Jones Act as sweep\ning aside general maritime law remedies”); O’Donnell v.\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 318 U. S. 36, 43 (1943)\n(“It follows that the Jones Act, in extending a right of\nrecovery to the seaman injured while in the service of his\nvessel by negligence, has done no more than supplement\nthe remedy of maintenance and cure . . .”); Pacific S. S. Co.\nv. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 134, 138–139 (1928) (holding\nthat the Jones Act “was not intended to restrict in any way\nthe long-established right of a seaman to maintenance,\n12           ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncure and wages”).\n  Not only have our decisions repeatedly observed that\nthe Jones Act preserves common-law causes of action such\nas maintenance and cure, but our case law also supports\nthe view that punitive damages awards, in particular,\nremain available in maintenance and cure actions after\nthe Act’s passage. In Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U. S. 527\n(1962), for example, the Court permitted the recovery of\nattorney’s fees for the “callous” and “willful and persis\ntent” refusal to pay maintenance and cure. Id., at 529–\n531. In fact, even the Vaughan dissenters, who believed\nthat such fees were generally unavailable, agreed that a\nseaman “would be entitled to exemplary damages in ac\ncord with traditional concepts of the law of damages”\nwhere a “shipowner’s refusal to pay maintenance stemmed\nfrom a wanton and intentional disregard of the legal\nrights of the seaman.” Id., at 540 (opinion of Stewart, J.);\nsee also Fiske, 3 F. Cas., at 957 (Story, J.) (arguing that\ncounsel fees are awardable in “[c]ourts of admiralty . . . not\ntechnically as costs, but upon the same principles, as they\nare often allowed damages in cases of torts, by courts of\ncommon law, as a recompense for injuries sustained, as\nexemplary damages, or as a remuneration for expences\nincurred, or losses sustained, by the misconduct of the\nother party”).5\n  Nothing in the text of the Jones Act or this Court’s\ndecisions issued in the wake of its enactment undermines\n——————\n  5 In the wake of Vaughan, a number of lower courts expressly held\n\nthat punitive damages can be recovered for the denial of maintenance\nand cure. See, e.g., Hines v. J. A. Laporte, Inc., 820 F. 2d 1187, 1189\n(CA11 1987) (per curiam) (upholding punitive damages award of $5,000\nfor an “arbitrary and bad faith breach of the duty to furnish mainte\nnance and cure”); Robinson v. Pocahontas, Inc., 477 F. 2d 1048, 1049–\n1052 (CA1 1973) (affirming punitive damages award of $10,000 which\nwas based, in part, on the defendant’s initial withholding of mainte\nnance and cure on the pretext that the seaman had been fired for\ncause).\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe continued existence of the common-law cause of action\nproviding recovery for the delayed or improper provision of\nmaintenance and cure. Petitioners do not deny the avail\nability of punitive damages in general maritime law, or\nidentify any cases establishing that such damages were\nhistorically unavailable for breach of the duty of mainte\nnance and cure. The plain language of the Jones Act,\nthen, does not provide the punitive damages bar that\npetitioners seek.\n                               B\n   Petitioners nonetheless argue that the availability of\npunitive damages in this case is controlled by the Jones\nAct because of this Court’s decision in Miles, 498 U. S. 19;\nsee also post, at 5–6 (opinion of ALITO, J.). In Miles, peti\ntioners argue, the Court limited recovery in maritime\ncases involving death or personal injury to the remedies\navailable under the Jones Act and the Death on the High\nSeas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. §§30301–30306.6 Petition\ners’ reading of Miles is far too broad.\n   Miles does not address either maintenance and cure\nactions in general or the availability of punitive damages\nfor such actions. The decision instead grapples with the\nentirely different question whether general maritime law\nshould provide a cause of action for wrongful death based\non unseaworthiness. By providing a remedy for wrongful\ndeath suffered on the high seas or in territorial waters, the\nJones Act and DOHSA displaced a general maritime rule\nthat denied any recovery for wrongful death. See Miles,\n498 U. S., at 23–34. This Court, therefore, was called\nupon in Miles to decide whether these new statutes sup\nported an expansion of the relief available under pre\n——————\n  6 DOHSA    applies only to individuals killed (not merely injured) by\nconduct on the high seas. See 46 U. S. C. §30302. Because this case\ninvolves injuries to a seaman, and not death on the high seas, DOHSA\nis not relevant.\n14        ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexisting general maritime law to harmonize it with a\ncause of action created by statute.\n   The Court in Miles first concluded that the “unanimous\nlegislative judgment behind the Jones Act, DOHSA, and\nthe many state statutes” authorizing maritime wrongful\ndeath actions, supported the recognition of a general\nmaritime action for wrongful death of a seaman. Id., at 24\n(discussing Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U. S.\n375 (1970), which overruled The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199\n(1886)). Congress had chosen to limit, however, the dam\nages available for wrongful-death actions under the Jones\nAct and DOHSA, such that damages were not statutorily\navailable for loss of society or lost future earnings. See\nMiles, 498 U. S., at 21, 31–32. The Court thus concluded\nthat Congress’ judgment must control the availability of\nremedies for wrongful-death actions brought under gen\neral maritime law, id., at 32–36.\n   The reasoning of Miles remains sound. As the Court in\nthat case explained, “[w]e no longer live in an era when\nseamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the\ncourts as a source of substantive legal protection from\ninjury and death; Congress and the States have legislated\nextensively in these areas.” Id., at 27. Furthermore, it\nwas only because of congressional action that a general\nfederal cause of action for wrongful death on the high seas\nand in territorial waters even existed; until then, there\nwas no general common-law doctrine providing for such an\naction. As a result, to determine the remedies available\nunder the common-law wrongful-death action, “an admi\nralty court should look primarily to these legislative en\nactments for policy guidance.” Ibid. It would have been\nillegitimate to create common-law remedies that exceeded\nthose remedies statutorily available under the Jones Act\nand DOHSA. See id., at 36 (“We will not create, under our\nadmiralty powers, a remedy . . . that goes well beyond the\nlimits of Congress’ ordered system of recovery for seamen’s\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninjury and death”).\n   But application of that principle here does not lead to\nthe outcome suggested by petitioners or the dissent. See\npost, at 2–3. Unlike the situation presented in Miles, both\nthe general maritime cause of action (maintenance and\ncure) and the remedy (punitive damages) were well estab\nlished before the passage of the Jones Act. See supra, at\n3–8. Also unlike the facts presented by Miles, the Jones\nAct does not address maintenance and cure or its remedy.7\nIt is therefore possible to adhere to the traditional under\nstanding of maritime actions and remedies without\nabridging or violating the Jones Act; unlike wrongful\ndeath actions, this traditional understanding is not a\nmatter to which “Congress has spoken directly.” See\nMiles, supra, at 31 (citing Mobil Oil Corp. v.\nHigginbotham, 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978)). Indeed, the\nMiles Court itself acknowledged that “[t]he Jones Act\nevinces no general hostility to recovery under maritime\nlaw,” 498 U. S., at 29, and noted that statutory remedy\nlimitations “would not necessarily deter us, if recovery . . .\nwere more consistent with the general principles of mari\ntime tort law.” Id., at 35. The availability of punitive\ndamages for maintenance and cure actions is entirely\nfaithful to these “general principles of maritime tort law,”\nand no statute casts doubt on their availability under\ngeneral maritime law.\n   Moreover, petitioners’ contention that Miles precludes\nany action or remedy for personal injury beyond that made\navailable under the Jones Act was directly rejected by this\nCourt in Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. Garris,\n532 U. S. 811, 818 (2001). That case involved the death of\n——————\n  7 Respondent’s claim is not affected by the statutory amendments to\n\nthe Jones Act that limit maintenance and cure recovery in cases involv\ning foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production facilities, see\n46 U. S. C. §30105, or sailing school students and instructors, §50504.\nSee supra, at 11.\n16        ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na harbor worker. Ibid. There, the Court recognized a\nmaritime cause of action for wrongful death attributable\nto negligence although neither the Jones Act (which ap\nplies only to seamen) nor DOHSA (which does not cover\nterritorial waters) provided such a remedy. Id., at 817–\n818. The Court acknowledged that “it will be the better\ncourse, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what\nthose statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further\ndevelopment to Congress.” Id., at 820. But the Court\nconcluded that the cause of action at issue there was “new\nonly in the most technical sense” because “[t]he general\nmaritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for\nmore than a century, and it has been clear since Moragne\nthat breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they\ncause death, as when they cause injury.” Ibid. The Court\nthus found that “Congress’s occupation of this field is not\nyet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is\nalready logically compelled by our precedents.” Ibid.\n   Because Miles presented no barrier to this endorsement\nof a previously unrecognized maritime cause of action for\nnegligent wrongful death, we see no legitimate basis for a\ncontrary conclusion in the present case. Like negligence,\n“[t]he general maritime law has recognized . . . for more\nthan a century” the duty of maintenance and cure and the\ngeneral availability of punitive damages. See Garris,\nsupra, at 820; see also supra, at 3–8. And because respon\ndent does not ask this Court to alter statutory text or\n“expand” the general principles of maritime tort law, Miles\ndoes not require us to eliminate the general maritime\nremedy of punitive damages for the willful or wanton\nfailure to comply with the duty to pay maintenance and\ncure. “We assume that Congress is aware of existing law\nwhen it passes legislation,” Miles, supra, at 32, and the\navailable history suggests that punitive damages were an\nestablished part of the maritime law in 1920, see supra, at\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n5–8.8\n   It remains true, of course, that “[a]dmiralty is not cre\nated in a vacuum; legislation has always served as an\nimportant source of both common law and admiralty\nprinciples.” Miles, supra, at 24. And it also is true that\nthe negligent denial of maintenance and cure may also be\nthe subject of a Jones Act claim. See Cortes v. Baltimore\nInsular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367 (1932).9 But the fact that\nseamen commonly seek to recover under the Jones Act for\nthe wrongful withholding of maintenance and cure does\nnot mean that the Jones Act provides the only remedy for\nmaintenance and cure claims. Indeed, contrary to peti\ntioners’ view that the Jones Act replaced in their entirety\nthe remedies available at common law for maintenance\nand cure, the Cortes decision explicitly acknowledged a\nseaman’s right to choose among overlapping statutory and\ncommon-law remedies for injuries sustained by the denial\nof maintenance and cure. See 287 U. S., at 374–375 (A\nseaman’s “cause of action for personal injury created by\nthe statute may have overlapped his cause of action for\nbreach of the maritime duty of maintenance and cure . . . .\nIn such circumstances it was his privilege, in so far as the\ncauses of action covered the same ground, to sue indiffer\n——————\n  8 In light of the Court’s decision in Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock\nCorp. v. Garris, 532 U. S. 811, 818 (2001), our reading of Miles cannot,\nas the dissent contends, represent an “abrup[t]” change of course. See\npost, at 1.\n  9 For those maintenance and cure claims that do not involve personal\n\ninjury (and thus cannot be asserted under the Jones Act), the dissent\nargues that punitive damages should be barred because such claims are\nbased in contract, not tort. See post, at 8. But the right of maintenance\nand cure “was firmly established in the maritime law long before\nrecognition of the distinction between tort and contract.” O’Donnell v.\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 318 U. S. 36, 42 (1943). Although the\nright has been described as incident to contract, it cannot be modified\nor waived. See Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U.

TOWNSEND\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nently on any one of them”).10\n   As this Court has repeatedly explained, “remedies for\nnegligence, unseaworthiness, and maintenance and cure\nhave different origins and may on occasion call for applica\ntion of slightly different principles and procedures.” Fitz\ngerald v.

S., at 138, 139 (emphasizing that\na seaman’s action for maintenance and cure is “independ\nent” and “cumulative” from other claims such as negli\ngence and that the maintenance and cure right is “in no\nsense inconsistent with, or an alternative of, the right to\nrecover compensatory damages [under the Jones Act]”).\nSee also Gilmore & Black §6–23, at 342 (“It is unques\ntioned law that both the Jones Act and the unseaworthi\nness remedies are additional to maintenance and cure: the\nseaman may have maintenance and cure and also one of\nthe other two”). The laudable quest for uniformity in\nadmiralty does not require the narrowing of available\ndamages to the lowest common denominator approved by\nCongress for distinct causes of action.11 Although “ Con\n——————\n  10 The  fact that, in some cases, a violation of the duty of maintenance\nand cure may also give rise to a Jones Act claim, see post, at 3 (opinion\nof ALITO, J.), is significant only in that it requires admiralty courts to\nensure against double recovery. See Fitzgerald v. United States Lines\nCo., 374 U. S. 16, 18–19 (1963) (authorizing a jury trial when a mainte\nnance and cure claim is joined with a Jones Act claim because,\n“[r]equiring a seaman to split up his lawsuit, submitting part of it to a\njury and part to a judge . . . can easily result in too much or too little\nrecovery”). Thus, a court may take steps to ensure that any award of\ndamages for lost wages in a Jones Act negligence claim is offset by the\namount of lost wages awarded as part of a recovery of maintenance and\ncure. See, e.g., Petition of Oskar Tiedemann & Co., 367 F. 2d 498, 505,\nn. 6 (CA3 1966); Crooks v.

Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19 (1990), this\nCourt provided a workable framework for analyzing the\nrelief available on claims under general maritime law.\nToday, the Court abruptly changes course. I would apply\nthe analytical framework adopted in Miles, and I therefore\nrespectfully dissent.\n                             I\n   In order to understand our decision in Miles, it is neces\nsary to appreciate the nature of the authority that the\nMiles Court was exercising. The Constitution, by extend\ning the judicial power of the United States to admiralty\nand maritime cases, impliedly empowered this Court to\ncontinue the development of maritime law “in the manner\nof a common law court.” Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 16); see also Romero v.\nInternational Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 360–\n361 (1959). In Miles, this Court explained how that au\nthority should be exercised in an era in which statutory\nlaw has become dominant.\n2          ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Miles presented two questions regarding the scope of\nrelief permitted under general maritime law, the first of\nwhich was whether damages for loss of society may be\nrecovered on a general maritime law wrongful-death\nclaim. In order to answer this question, the Court looked\nto the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U. S. C. §30301\net seq., and the Jones Act 46 U. S. C. §30101 et seq., both of\nwhich created new statutory wrongful-death claims.\nBecause the relief available on these statutory claims does\nnot include damages for loss of society, the Court con\ncluded that it should not permit such damages on a wrong\nful-death claim brought under general maritime law. The\nCourt explained:\n    “We no longer live in an era when seamen and their\n    loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a\n    source of substantive legal protection from injury and\n    death; Congress and the States have legislated exten\n    sively in these areas. In this era, an admiralty court\n    should look primarily to these legislative enactments\n    for policy guidance.” 498 U. S., at 27 (emphasis\n    added).\n  The Court took a similar approach in answering the\nsecond question in Miles—whether damages for loss of\nfuture income should be available in a general maritime\nlaw survival action. The Court noted that “[t]here are\nindeed strong policy arguments for allowing such recov\nery” and that “admiralty courts have always shown a\nspecial solicitude for the welfare of seamen and their\nfamilies.” Id., at 35–36. But because the Jones Act sur\nvival provision “limits recovery to losses suffered during\nthe decedent’s lifetime,” the Court held that a similar\nlimitation should apply under general maritime law. Id.,\nat 36.\n  Miles thus instructs that, in exercising our authority to\ndevelop general maritime law, we should be guided pri\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmarily by the policy choices reflected in statutes creating\nclosely related claims. Endorsing what has been termed a\nprinciple of uniformity, Miles teaches that if a form of\nrelief is not available on a statutory claim, we should be\nreluctant to permit such relief on a similar claim brought\nunder general maritime law.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   The type of maintenance and cure claim that is most\nlikely to include a request for punitive damages is a claim\nthat a seaman suffered personal injury as a result of the\nwillful refusal to provide maintenance and cure. Such a\nclaim may be brought under general maritime law. See\nCortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367, 374\n(1932) (recognizing that a seaman may sue under general\nmaritime law to recover for personal injury resulting from\nthe denial of maintenance and cure). And a similar claim\nmay also be maintained under the Jones Act. See, e.g.,\nGuevara v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 59 F. 3d 1496, 1499–\n1500 (CA5 1995) (en banc); G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of\nAdmiralty §6–13, p. 311 (2d ed. 1975). To be sure, a sea\nman asserting a Jones Act claim must show that his em\nployer was negligent, ibid., while a seaman proceeding\nunder general maritime law may recover compensatory\ndamages without establishing fault, id., at 310. But be\ncause the prevailing rule in American courts does not\npermit punitive damages without a showing of fault, see\nExxon Shipping, supra, at 16, n. 2, it appears that any\npersonal injury maintenance and cure claim in which\npunitive damages might be awarded could be brought\nequally under either general maritime law or the Jones\nAct. The Miles uniformity therefore weighs strongly in\nfavor of a rule that applies uniformly under general mari\ntime law and the Jones Act. I therefore turn to the ques\ntion whether punitive damages may be awarded under the\n4            ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nJones Act.\n                              B\n  Enacted in 1920, the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. §§30104–\n30105(b), makes applicable to seamen the substantive\nrecovery provisions of the Federal Employers Liability Act\n(FELA), 45 U. S. C. §51 et seq., which became law in 1908.\nFELA, in turn, “recites only that employers shall be liable\nin ‘damages’ for the injury or death of one protected under\nthe Act.” Miles, supra, at 32 (citing 45 U. S. C. §51).\n  Prior to the enactment of the Jones Act, however, this\nCourt had decided several cases that explored the dam\nages allowed under FELA. In Michigan Central R. Co. v.\nVreeland, 227 U. S. 59 (1913), the Court dealt primarily\nwith the damages that may be recovered under FELA’s\nwrongful-death provision, but the Court also discussed the\ndamages available in the case of injury. The Court noted\nthat if the worker in that case had not died from his inju\nries, “he might have recovered such damages as would\nhave compensated him for his expense, loss of time, suffer\ning and diminished earning power.” Id., at 65. Two years\nlater, in St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237 U. S. 648\n(1915), the Court reiterated that an injured worker may\nrecover only compensatory damages. Addressing the\ndamages available to a party bringing a survival claim,\nthe Court explained that the party may recover only those\ndamages that had accrued to the worker at the time of his\ndeath and was thus limited to “such damages as will be\nreasonably compensatory for the loss and suffering of the\ninjured person while he lived.” Id., at 658. See also ibid.\n(damages “confined to the [the worker’s] personal loss and\nsuffering before he died”); Miller v. American President\nLines, Ltd., 989 F. 2d 1450, 1457 (CA6), cert. denied, 510\nU. S. 915 (1993) (“It has been the unanimous judgment of\nthe courts since before the enactment of the Jones Act that\npunitive damages are not recoverable under [FELA]).”\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  When Congress incorporated FELA unaltered into the\nJones Act, Congress must have intended to incorporate\nFELA’s limitation on damages as well. Miles, 498 U. S., at\n32. “We assume that Congress is aware of existing law\nwhen it passes legislation.” Ibid. (citing Cannon v. Uni\nversity of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696–697 (1979)). It is\ntherefore reasonable to assume that only compensatory\ndamages may be recovered under the Jones Act. See\nPacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 136–.139\n(1928) (under the Jones Act, a seaman may “recover com\npensatory damages for injuries caused by the negligence”).\nAnd under Miles’ reasoning—at least in the absence of\nsome exceptionally strong countervailing considerations—\nthe rule should be the same when a seaman sues under\ngeneral maritime law for personal injury resulting from\nthe denial of maintenance and cure.\n                           III\n  In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court reasons\nthat: punitive damages were available on maintenance\nand cure claims prior to the enactment of the Jones Act\nand that the Jones Act was not intended to trim the relief\navailable on such general maritime law claims. This\nreasoning is flawed.\n                             A\n  First, the Court proceeds as if the question here were\nwhether the Jones Act was meant to preclude general\nmaritime law claims and remedies. See ante, at 9–10\n(Jones Act does not “overtur[n]” or “eliminate pre-existing\nremedies available to seamen”); ante, at 11 (Jones Act\n“preserves common-law causes of action”); ante, at 15\n(Miles does not “preclud[e]” all claims and remedies be\nyond that made available under the Jones Act). Miles\nexplicitly rejected that argument. See 498 U. S., at 29.\nBut just because the Jones Act was not meant to preclude\n6          ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ngeneral maritime claims or remedies, it does not follow\nthat the Jones Act was meant to stop the development of\ngeneral maritime law by the courts. The Jones Act is\nsignificant because it created a statutory claim that is\nindistinguishable for present purposes from a general\nmaritime law maintenance and cure claim based on per\nsonal injury and because this statutory claim does not\npermit the recovery of punitive damages. “Congress, in\nthe exercise of its legislative powers, is free to say ‘this\nmuch and no more,’ ” and “an admiralty court should look\nprimarily to these legislative enactments for policy guid\nance.” Miles, supra, at 24, 27. This policy embodied in the\nJones Act thus constitutes a powerful argument in favor of\nthe development of a similar rule under general maritime\nlaw.\n                              B\n  That brings me to the Court’s claim that the availability\nof punitive damages was established before the Jones Act\nwas passed. If punitive damages were a widely recognized\nand regularly employed feature of maintenance and cure\nclaims during the pre-Jones Act era, I would not rule out\nthe possibility that this history might be sufficient to\noutweigh the Miles uniformity principle. But a search for\ncases in which punitive damages were awarded for the\nwillful denial of maintenance of cure—in an era when\nseamen were often treated with shocking callousness—\nyields very little. Although American courts have enter\ntained maintenance and cure suits since the early 19th\ncentury, the Court points to only two reported cases—The\nCity of Carlisle, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (DC Ore. 1889), and The Troop,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">769</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (DC Wash. 1902)—that, as the Court carefully\nputs it, “appear to contain at least some punitive element.”\nAnte, at 8.\n  The Court’s choice of words is well advised, for it is not\neven clear that punitive damages were recovered in these\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntwo obscure cases. In The City of Carlisle, a 16-year-old\napprentice suffered a fractured skull. The captain refused\nto put ashore. Given little care, the apprentice spent the\nnext six or seven weeks in his bunk, wracked with pain,\nand was then compelled to work 12 hours a day for the\nremaining three months of the voyage. Upon landing, the\ncaptain made no arrangements for care and did not pay for\nthe apprentice’s brain surgery. The apprentice received\nan award of $1,000; that may include some “punitive\nelement,” but it seems likely that much if not all of that\nsum represented compensation for the apprentice’s\nmonths of agony and the lingering effects of his injury.\n   The Court’s second case, The Troop, supra, involved\nsimilarly brutal treatment. The seaman fell from a mast\nand fractured an arm and a leg while his ship was six\nmiles from its port of departure. Refusing to return to\nport, the captain subjected the seaman to maltreatment\nfor the remainder of the 36-day voyage. As a result, he\nwas required to undergo painful surgery, and his injuries\npermanently prevented him from returning to work as a\nmariner. He received an undifferentiated award of $4,000,\nand while the court was sharply critical of the captain’s\nconduct, it is far from clear that the award did not consist\nentirely of compensatory damages for medical expenses,\nlost future income, and pain and suffering.\n   In addition to the two cases cited by the Court, respon\ndent and an amicus claim that punitive damages were\nawarded in a few additional cases. See Brief for Respon\ndent 13; Brief for Amicus Curiae American Assn. of Jus\ntice as Amicus Curiae 10–11. Of these cases, The Mar\ngharita, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (CA5 1905), is perhaps the most\nsupportive. There, the court explained that its award of\n$1,500 would not only “compensate the seaman for his\nunnecessary and unmerited suffering” but would “empha\nsize the importance of humane and correct judgment\nunder the circumstances on the part of the master.” Id., at\n8          ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n827. While the court’s reference to the message that the\naward embodied suggests that the award was in part\npunitive, it is also possible that the reference simply rep\nresented a restatement of one of the traditional rationales\nfor maintenance and cure, i.e., that it served the economic\ninterests of shipowners and the general interests of the\ncountry by making service as a seaman more attractive.\nSee Harden v. Gordon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (No. 6,047) (CC\nMe. 1823).\n   The remaining cases contain harsh criticism of the\nseamen’s treatment but do not identify any portion of the\naward as punitive. See The Rolph, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (ND Cal.\n1923), aff’d, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (CA9 1924) (undifferentiated award\nof $10,000 for a seaman rendered blind in both eyes);\nTomlinson v.

Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 (No. 14,087) (DC\nCal. 1872).\n   In sum, the search for maintenance and cure cases in\nwhich punitive damages were awarded yields strikingly\nslim results. The cases found are insufficient in number,\nclarity, and prominence to justify departure from the Miles\nuniformity principle.\n                               IV\n    There is one remaining question in this case, namely,\nwhether punitive damages are permitted when a seaman\nasserts a general maritime law maintenance and cure\nclaim that is not based on personal injury. In Cortes, 287\nU. S., at 371, the Court explained that the duty to furnish\nmaintenance and cure “is one annexed to the employment.\n. . . Contractual it is in the sense that it has its source in a\nrelation which is contractual in origin, but, given the\nrelation, no agreement is competent to abrogate the inci\ndent.” The duty is thus essentially quasicontractual, and\ntherefore, in those instances in which the seaman does not\nsuffer personal injury, recovery should be governed by the\nlaw of quasi-contract.

Argued March 2, 2009—Decided June 25, 2009\nAtlantic Sounding Co. allegedly refused to pay maintenance and cure to\n  respondent Townsend for injuries he suffered while working on its\n  tugboat, and then filed this declaratory relief action regarding its ob\n  ligations. Townsend filed suit under the Jones Act and general mari\n  time law, alleging, inter alia, arbitrary and willful failure to provide\n  maintenance and cure. He filed similar counterclaims in the declara\n  tory judgment action, seeking punitive damages for the maintenance\n  and cure claim. The District Court denied petitioners’ motion to dis\n  miss the punitive damages claim, but certified the question for inter\n  locutory appeal. Following its precedent, the Eleventh Circuit held\n  that punitive damages may be awarded for the willful withholding of\n  maintenance and cure.\nHeld: Because punitive damages have long been an accepted remedy\n under general maritime law, and because neither Miles v. Apex Ma\n rine Corp., 498 U. S. 19, nor the Jones Act altered this understand\n ing, punitive damages for the willful and wanton disregard of the\n maintenance and cure obligation remain available as a matter of\n general maritime law. Pp. 2–19.\n    (a) Settled legal principles establish three points central to this\n case. Pp. 2–9.\n      (i) Punitive damages have long been an available remedy at\n common law for wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct. English law\n during the colonial era accorded juries the authority to award such\n damages when warranted. And American courts have likewise per\n mitted such damages since at least 1784. This Court has also found\n punitive damages authorized as a matter of common-law doctrine.\n See, e.g., Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363. Pp. 3–5.\n2              ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n         (ii) The common-law punitive damages tradition extends to\n    claims arising under federal maritime law. See Lake Shore & Michi\n    gan Southern R. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U. S. 101, 108. One of this\n    Court’s first cases so indicating involved an action for marine tres\n    pass. See The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat. 546. And lower federal\n    courts have found punitive damages available in maritime actions for\n    particularly egregious tortious acts. Pp. 5–6.\n         (iii) Nothing in maritime law undermines this general rule’s ap\n    plicability in the maintenance and cure context. The maintenance\n    and cure obligation dates back centuries as an aspect of general\n    maritime law, and the failure of a seaman’s employers to provide\n    adequate medical care was the basis for awarding punitive damages\n    in cases decided in the 1800’s. This Court has since registered its\n    agreement with such decisions and has subsequently found that in\n    addition to wages, “maintenance” includes food and lodging at the\n    ship’s expense, and “cure” refers to medical treatment, Lewis v. Lewis\n    & Clark Marine, Inc., 531 U. S. 438, 441. Moreover, an owner’s fail\n    ure to provide proper medical care for seamen has provided lower\n    courts the impetus to award damages that appear to contain at least\n    some punitive element. Pp. 7–8.\n         (iv) Under these settled legal principles, respondent is entitled to\n    pursue punitive damages unless Congress has enacted legislation\n    that departs from the common-law understanding. P. 9.\n       (b) The plain language of the Jones Act does not provide a basis for\n    overturning the common-law rule. Congress enacted the Jones Act to\n    overrule The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, where the Court prohibited a\n    seaman or his family from recovering for injuries or death suffered\n    due to his employers’ negligence. To that end, the Act created a\n    statutory negligence cause of action, but it did not eliminate pre\n    existing remedies available to seamen for the separate common-law\n    cause of action based on maintenance and cure. The Act bestows the\n    right to “elect” to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby indicating a choice\n    of actions for seamen—not an exclusive remedy. Because the then\n    accepted remedies arose from general maritime law, it necessarily\n    follows that Congress envisioned their continued availability. See\n    Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354. Had the Jones Act been\n    the only remaining remedy available, there would have been no elec\n    tion to make. And, the only statutory restrictions on general mari\n    time maintenance and cure claims were enacted long after the Jones\n    Act’s passage and limit availability for only two discrete\n    classes: foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production facili\n    ties and sailing school students and instructors. This indicates that\n    “Congress knows how to” restrict the traditional maintenance and\n    cure remedy “when it wants to.” Omni Capital Int’l, Ltd. v. Rudolf\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                             Syllabus\n\nWolff & Co., 484 U. S. 97, 106. This Court has consistently observed\nthat the Jones Act preserves common-law causes of action such as\nmaintenance and cure, see. e.g., The Arizona v. Anelich, 298 U. S.\n110, and its case law supports the view that punitive damages\nawards, in particular, continue to remain available in maintenance\nand cure actions, see Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U. S. 527. Pp. 9–13.\n     (i) Contrary to petitioners’ argument, Miles does not limit recov\nery to the remedies available under the Jones Act. Miles does not\naddress either maintenance and cure actions in general or the avail\nability of punitive damages for such actions. Instead, it grappled\nwith the entirely different question whether general maritime law\nshould provide a cause of action for wrongful death based on unsea\nworthiness. The Court found that the Jones Act and the Death on\nthe High Seas Act (DOHSA), along with state statutes, supported\nrecognition of a general maritime rule for wrongful death of a sea\nman. However, since Congress had chosen to limit the damages\navailable in the Jones Act and DOHSA, excluding damages for loss of\nsociety or lost future earnings, 498 U. S., at 21, 31–32, its judgment\nmust control the availability of remedies for wrongful-death actions\nbrought under general maritime law, id., at 32–36. Miles’ reasoning\ndoes not apply here. Unlike Miles’ situation, both the general mari\ntime cause of action here (maintenance and cure) and the remedy\n(punitive damages) were well established before the Jones Act’s pas\nsage. And unlike Miles’ facts, the Jones Act does not address the\ngeneral maritime cause of action here or its remedy. It is thus possi\nble to adhere to the traditional understanding of maritime actions\nand remedies without abridging or violating the Jones Act; unlike\nwrongful-death actions, this traditional understanding is not a mat\nter to which “Congress has spoken directly.” See id., at 31. More\nover, petitioners’ contrary view was directly rejected in Norfolk Ship\nbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. Garris, 532 U. S. 811, 820. If Miles\npresented no barrier to the Garris Court’s endorsement of a previ\nously unrecognized maritime cause of action for negligent wrongful\ndeath, there is no legitimate basis for a contrary conclusion here.\nLike negligence, the duty of maintenance and cure and the general\navailability of punitive damages have been recognized “for more than\na century,” 532 U. S., at 820. And because respondent does not ask\nthis Court to alter statutory text or “expand” the maritime tort law’s\ngeneral principles, Miles does not require eliminating the general\nmaritime remedy of punitive damages for the willful or wanton fail\nure to comply with the duty to pay maintenance and cure. The fact\nthat seamen commonly seek to recover under the Jones Act for main\ntenance and cure claims, does not mean that the Jones Act provides\nthe only remedy. See Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S.\n4             ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n    367, 374–375.

Apex Marine Corp.,\n498 U. S. 19 (1990), seamen may recover only those dam\nages available under the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. §30104.\nWe disagree. Historically, punitive damages have been\navailable and awarded in general maritime actions,\nincluding some in maintenance and cure.         We find\nthat nothing in Miles or the Jones Act eliminates that\navailability.\n                             I\n  Respondent Edgar L. Townsend was a crew member of\nthe Motor Tug Thomas. After falling on the steel deck of\nthe tugboat and injuring his arm and shoulder, respondent\nclaimed that petitioner Atlantic Sounding,1 the owner of\nthe tugboat, advised him that it would not provide main\n——————\n 1 Atlantic Sounding Co., Inc., is a wholly owned subsidiary of Weeks\n\nMarine, Inc., the other petitioner in this case.\n2           ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v.

See 496 F. 3d 1282, 1283 (CA11 2007).\n“A claim for maintenance and cure concerns the vessel\nowner’s obligation to provide food, lodging, and medical\nservices to a seaman injured while serving the ship.”\nLewis v. Lewis & Clark Marine, Inc., 531 U. S. 438, 441\n(2001).\n  Petitioners thereafter filed an action for declaratory\nrelief regarding their obligations with respect to mainte\nnance and cure. Respondent filed his own suit under the\nJones Act and general maritime law, alleging negligence,\nunseaworthiness, arbitrary and willful failure to pay\nmaintenance and cure, and wrongful termination. In\naddition, respondent filed similar counterclaims in the\ndeclaratory judgment action, seeking punitive damages for\nthe denial of maintenance and cure. The District Court\nconsolidated the cases. See 496 F. 3d, at 1283–1284.\n  Petitioners moved to dismiss respondent’s punitive\ndamages claim. The District Court denied the motion,\nholding that it was bound by the determination in Hines v.\nJ. A. LaPorte, Inc., 820 F. 2d 1187, 1189 (CA11 1987) (per\ncuriam), that punitive damages were available in an\naction for maintenance and cure. The court, however,\nagreed to certify the question for interlocutory appeal. See\n496 F. 3d, at 1284. The United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that\nHines controlled and held that respondent could pursue\nhis punitive damages claim for the willful withholding of\nmaintenance and cure. 496 F. 3d, at 1285–1286. The\ndecision conflicted with those of other Courts of Appeals,\nsee, e.g., Guevara v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 59 F. 3d\n1496 (CA5 1995) (en banc); Glynn v.

See, e.g., Lord Townsend v. Hughes, 2 Mod. 150, 86\nEng. Rep. 994 (C. P. 1676) (“[I]n civil actions the plaintiff\nis to recover by way of compensation for the damages he\nhath sustained, and the jury are the proper judges\nthereof” (emphasis in original)); 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of\nDamages §349, p. 688 (9th ed. 1912) (hereinafter Sedg\nwick) (“Until comparatively recent times juries were as\narbitrary judges of the amount of damages as of the\nfacts”). The common-law view “was that ‘in cases where\nthe amount of damages was uncertain[,] their assessment\nwas a matter so peculiarly within the province of the jury\nthat the Court should not alter it.’ ” Feltner v. Columbia\nPictures Television, Inc., 523 U. S. 340, 353 (1998) (quoting\nDimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 480 (1935); alteration in\noriginal).\n   The jury’s broad discretion to set damages included the\nauthority to award punitive damages when the circum\nstances of the case warranted. Just before the ratification\nof the Constitution, Lord Chief Justice Pratt explained\nthat “a jury ha[s] it in [its] power to give damages for more\nthan the injury received. Damages are designed not only\nas a satisfaction to the injured person, but likewise as a\npunishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceed\ning for the future, and as a proof of the detestation of the\njury to the action itself.” Wilkes v. Wood, Lofft 1, 18–19,\n98 Eng. Rep. 489, 498–499 (C. P. 1763); see also Pacific\nMut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 25 (1991) (SCALIA,\n4          ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nJ., concurring in judgment) (“[P]unitive or ‘exemplary’\ndamages have long been a part of Anglo-American law”);\nHuckle v. Money, 2 Wils. 205, 207, 95 Eng. Rep. 768, 769\n(C. P. 1763) (declining to grant a new trial because the\njury “ha[s] done right in giving exemplary damages”).\n    American courts have likewise permitted punitive dam\nages awards in appropriate cases since at least 1784. See,\ne.g., Genay v. Norris, 1 S. C. L. 6, 7 (C. P. and Gen. Sess.\n1784) (approving award of “very exemplary damages”\nbecause spiking wine represented a “very wanton out\nrage”); Coryell v. Colbaugh, 1 N. J. L. 77 (1791) (conclud\ning that a breach of promise of marriage was “of the most\natrocious and dishonourable nature” and supported “dam\nages for example’s sake, to prevent such offences in future”\n(emphasis in original)). Although some States elected not\nto allow juries to make such awards, the vast majority\npermitted them. See 1 Sedgwick §§352, 354, at 694, 700.\nBy the middle of the 19th century, “punitive damages were\nundoubtedly an established part of the American common\nlaw of torts [and] no particular procedures were deemed\nnecessary to circumscribe a jury’s discretion regarding the\naward of such damages, or their amount.” Haslip, supra,\nat 26–27 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\n    This Court has also found the award of punitive dam\nages to be authorized as a matter of common-law doctrine.\nIn Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363 (1852), for example, the\nCourt recognized the “well-established principle of the\ncommon law, that in actions of trespass and all actions on\nthe case for torts, a jury may inflict what are called exem\nplary, punitive, or vindictive damages upon a defendant\n. . . .” Id., at 371; see also Philadelphia, W., & B. R. Co. v.\nQuigley, 21 How. 202, 214 (1859) (“Whenever the injury\ncomplained of has been inflicted maliciously or wantonly,\nand with circumstances of contumely or indignity, the jury\nare not limited to the ascertainment of a simple compensa\ntion for the wrong committed against the aggrieved per\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

S. 550, 562 (1886)\n(“[A]ccording to the settled law of this court, [a plaintiff]\nmight show himself, by proof of the circumstances, to be\nentitled to exemplary damages calculated to vindicate his\nright and protect it against future similar invasions”).\n                              B\n   The general rule that punitive damages were available\nat common law extended to claims arising under federal\nmaritime law. See Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R.\nCo. v. Prentice, 147 U. S. 101, 108 (1893) (“[C]ourts of\nadmiralty . . . proceed, in cases of tort, upon the same\nprinciples as courts of common law, in allowing exemplary\ndamages . . .”). One of this Court’s first cases indicating\nthat punitive damages were available involved an action\nfor marine trespass. See The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat.\n546 (1818). In the course of deciding whether to uphold\nthe jury’s award, Justice Story, writing for the Court,\nrecognized that punitive damages are an available mari\ntime remedy under the proper circumstances. Although\nthe Court found that the particular facts of the case did\nnot warrant such an award against the named defendants,\nit explained that “if this were a suit against the original\nwrong-doers, it might be proper to . . . visit upon them in\nthe shape of exemplary damages, the proper punishment\nwhich belongs to such lawless misconduct.” Id., at 558;\nsee also Barry, supra, at 563 (“In The Amiable Nancy,\nwhich was the case of a marine tort, Mr. Justice Story\nspoke of exemplary damages as ‘the proper punish\nment which belongs to . . . lawless misconduct’ ” (citation\nomitted)).\n   The lower federal courts followed suit, finding that\npunitive damages were available in maritime actions for\ntortious acts of a particularly egregious nature. See, e.g.,\nMcGuire v. The Golden Gate, 16 F. Cas. 141, 143 (No.\n8,815) (CC ND Cal. 1856) (“In an action against the perpe\n6                ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntrator of the wrong, the aggrieved party would be entitled\nto recover not only actual damages but exemplary,—such\nas would vindicate his wrongs, and teach the tort feasor\nthe necessity of reform”); Ralston v. The State Rights, 20\nF. Cas. 201, 210 (No. 11,540) (DC ED Pa. 1836) (“[I]t is not\nlegally correct . . . to say that a court cannot give exem\nplary damages, in a case like the present, against the\nowners of a vessel”); Boston Mfg. Co. v. Fiske, 3 F. Cas.\n957 (No. 1,681) (CC Mass. 1820) (Story, J.) (“In cases of\nmarine torts, or illegal captures, it is far from being un\ncommon in the admiralty to allow costs and expences, and\nto mulct the offending parties, even in exemplary dam\nages, where the nature of the case requires it”). In short,\nprior to enactment of the Jones Act in 1920, “maritime\njurisprudence was replete with judicial statements ap\nproving punitive damages, especially on behalf of passen\ngers and seamen.” Robertson, Punitive Damages in\nAmerican Maritime Law, 28 J. Mar. L. & Comm. 73, 115\n(1997) (hereinafter Robertson); see also 2 Sedgwick §599b,\nat 1156 (“Exemplary damages are awarded in Admiralty,\nas in other jurisdictions”); 2 J. Sutherland, Law of Dam\nages §392, p. 1272 (4th ed. 1916) (“As a rule a court of\nequity will not award [punitive] damages, but courts of\nadmiralty will . . .” (footnote omitted)).2\n\n\n——————\n    2 Althoughpunitive damages awards were rarely upheld on judicial\nreview, but see Roza v. Smith, 65 F. 592, 596–597 (DC ND Cal. 1895);\nGallagher v. The Yankee, 9 F. Cas. 1091, 1093 (No. 5,196) (DC ND Cal.\n1859), that fact does not draw into question the basic understanding\nthat punitive damages were considered an available maritime remedy.\nIndeed, in several cases in which a judgment awarding punitive dam\nage awards was overturned on appeal, the reversal was based on\nunrelated grounds. See, e.g., The Margharita, 140 F. 820, 824 (CA5\n1905); Pacific Packing & Nav. Co. v. Fielding, 136 F. 577, 580 (CA9\n1905); Latchtimacker v.

Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty §6–13,\np. 312 (2d ed. 1975) (hereinafter Gilmore & Black) (ex\nplaining that a seaman denied maintenance and cure “has\na free option to claim damages (including punitive dam\nages) under a general maritime law count”); Robertson 163\n(concluding that breach of maintenance and cure is one of\nthe particular torts for which general maritime law would\nmost likely permit the awarding of punitive damages\n“assuming . . . the requisite level of blameworthiness”).\nIndeed, the legal obligation to provide maintenance and\ncure dates back centuries as an aspect of general maritime\nlaw, and the failure of a seaman’s employers to provide\nhim with adequate medical care was the basis for award\ning punitive damages in cases decided as early as the\n1800’s.\n   The right to receive maintenance and cure was first\nrecognized in this country in two lower court decisions\nauthored by Justice Story. See Harden v. Gordon, 11\nF. Cas. 480 (No. 6,047) (CC Me. 1823); Reed v. Canfield, 20\nF. Cas. 426 (No. 11,641) (CC Mass. 1832). According to\nJustice Story, this common-law obligation to seamen was\njustified on humanitarian and economic grounds: “If some\nprovision be not made for [seamen] in sickness at the\nexpense of the ship, they must often in foreign ports suffer\nthe accumulated evils of disease, and poverty, and some\ntimes perish from the want of suitable nourishment. . . .\n[T]he merchant himself derives an ultimate benefit [be\ncause i]t encourages seamen to engage in perilous voyages\nwith more promptitude, and at lower wages.” Harden,\nsupra, at 483; see also Reed, supra, at 429 (“The seaman is\nto be cured at the expense of the ship, of the sickness or\ninjury sustained in the ship’s service”).\n   This Court has since registered its agreement with these\n8           ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ndecisions. “Upon a full review . . . of English and Ameri\ncan authorities,” the Court concluded that “the vessel and\nher owners are liable, in case a seaman falls sick, or is\nwounded, in the service of the ship, to the extent of his\nmaintenance and cure, and to his wages, at least so long\nas the voyage is continued.” The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158,\n175 (1903). Decisions following The Osceola have ex\nplained that in addition to wages, “maintenance” includes\nfood and lodging at the expense of their ship, and “cure”\nrefers to medical treatment. Lewis, 531 U. S., at 441; see\nalso Gilmore & Black §6–12, at 267–268 (describing\n“maintenance and cure” as including medical expenses, a\nliving allowance, and unearned wages).\n   In addition, the failure of a vessel owner to provide\nproper medical care for seamen has provided the impetus\nfor damages awards that appear to contain at least some\npunitive element. For example, in The City of Carlisle, 39\nF. 807 (DC Ore. 1889), the court added $1,000 to its dam\nages award to compensate an apprentice seaman for “gross\nneglect and cruel maltreatment of the [seaman] since his\ninjury.” Id., at 809, 817. The court reviewed the indigni\nties to which the apprentice had been subjected as he\nrecovered without any serious medical attention, see id.,\nat 810–812, and explained that “if owners do not wish to\nbe mulct in damages for such misconduct, they should be\ncareful to select men worthy to command their vessels and\nfit to be trusted with the safety and welfare of their crews,\nand particularly apprentice boys.” Id., at 817; see also The\nTroop, 118 F. 769, 770–771, 773 (DC Wash. 1902) (ex\nplaining that $4,000 was a reasonable award because the\ncaptain’s “failure to observe the dictates of humanity” and\nobtain prompt medical care for an injured seaman consti\ntuted a “monstrous wrong”).3\n——————\n  3 Although these cases do not refer to “punitive” or “exemplary” dam\n\nages, scholars have characterized the awards authorized by these\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

First, punitive\ndamages have long been available at common law. Sec\nond, the common-law tradition of punitive damages ex\ntends to maritime claims.4 And third, there is no evidence\nthat claims for maintenance and cure were excluded from\nthis general admiralty rule. Instead, the pre-Jones Act\nevidence indicates that punitive damages remain available\nfor such claims under the appropriate factual circum\nstances. As a result, respondent is entitled to pursue\npunitive damages unless Congress has enacted legislation\ndeparting from this common-law understanding. As ex\nplained below, it has not.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  The only statute that could serve as a basis for overturn\ning the common-law rule in this case is the Jones Act.\nCongress enacted the Jones Act primarily to overrule The\nOsceola, supra, in which this Court prohibited a seaman or\nhis family from recovering for injuries or death suffered\n——————\ndecisions as such. See Robertson 103–105; Edelman, Guevara v.\nMaritime Overseas Corp.: Opposing the Decision, 20 Tulane Mar. L. J.\n349, 351, and n. 22 (1996).\n  4 The dissent correctly notes that the handful of early cases involving\n\nmaintenance and cure, by themselves, do not definitively resolve the\nquestion of punitive damages availability in such cases. See post, at 6–\n8 (opinion of ALITO, J.). However, it neglects to acknowledge that the\ngeneral common-law rule made punitive damages available in maritime\nactions. See supra, at 5–6. Nor does the dissent explain why mainte\nnance and cure actions should be excepted from this general rule. It is\nbecause of this rule, and the fact that these early cases support—rather\nthan refute—its application to maintenance and cure actions, see\nsupra, at 7–8, that the pre-Jones Act evidence supports the conclusion\nthat punitive damages were available at common law where the denial\nof maintenance and cure involved wanton, willful, or outrageous\nconduct.\n10         ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v.

To this end, the statute\nprovides in relevant part:\n     “A seaman injured in the course of employment or, if\n     the seaman dies from the injury, the personal repre\n     sentative of the seaman may elect to bring a civil ac\n     tion at law, with the right of trial by jury, against the\n     employer. Laws of the United States regulating re\n     covery for personal injury to, or death of, a railway\n     employee apply to an action under this section.” 46\n     U. S. C. §30104(a) (incorporating the Federal Employ\n     ers’ Liability Act, 45 U. S. C. §§51–60).\n   The Jones Act thus created a statutory cause of action\nfor negligence, but it did not eliminate pre-existing reme\ndies available to seamen for the separate common-law\ncause of action based on a seaman’s right to maintenance\nand cure. Section 30104 bestows upon the injured seaman\nthe right to “elect” to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby\nindicating a choice of actions for seamen—not an exclusive\nremedy. See Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary\nof the English Language 798 (1913) (defining “elect” as\n“[t]o make choice of”); 1 Bouvier’s Law Dictionary 979 (8th\ned. 1914) (defining “election” as “[c]hoice; selection”).\nBecause the then-accepted remedies for injured seamen\narose from general maritime law, see The Osceola, supra,\nat 175, it necessarily follows that Congress was envision\ning the continued availability of those common-law causes\nof action. See Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354\n(1995) (“Congress enacted the Jones Act in 1920 to remove\nthe bar to suit for negligence articulated in The Osceola,\nthereby completing the trilogy of heightened legal protec\ntions [including maintenance and cure] that seamen re\nceive because of their exposure to the perils of the sea”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); Stewart v. Dutra\nConstr. Co., 543 U. S. 481, 487 (2005) (describing the\nJones Act as “remov[ing] this bar to negligence suits by\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nseamen”). If the Jones Act had been the only remaining\nremedy available to injured seamen, there would have\nbeen no election to make.\n   In addition, the only statutory restrictions expressly\naddressing general maritime claims for maintenance and\ncure were enacted long after the passage of the Jones Act.\nThey limit its availability for two discrete classes of peo\nple: foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production\nfacilities, see §503(a)(2), 96 Stat. 1955, codified at 46\nU. S. C. §30105(b), and sailing school students and in\nstructors, §204, 96 Stat. 1589, codified at 46 U. S. C.\n§50504(b).     These provisions indicate that “Congress\nknows how to” restrict the traditional remedy of mainte\nnance and cure “when it wants to.” Omni Capital Int’l,\nLtd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U. S. 97, 106 (1987). Thus,\nnothing in the statutory scheme for maritime recovery\nrestricts the availability of punitive damages for mainte\nnance and cure for those, like respondent, who are not\nprecluded from asserting the general maritime claim.\n   Further supporting this interpretation of the Jones Act,\nthis Court has consistently recognized that the Act “was\nremedial, for the benefit and protection of seamen who are\npeculiarly the wards of admiralty. Its purpose was to\nenlarge that protection, not to narrow it.” The Arizona v.\nAnelich, 298 U. S. 110, 123 (1936); see also American\nExport Lines, Inc. v. Alvez, 446 U. S. 274, 282 (1980) (plu\nrality opinion) (declining to “read the Jones Act as sweep\ning aside general maritime law remedies”); O’Donnell v.\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 318 U. S. 36, 43 (1943)\n(“It follows that the Jones Act, in extending a right of\nrecovery to the seaman injured while in the service of his\nvessel by negligence, has done no more than supplement\nthe remedy of maintenance and cure . . .”); Pacific S. S. Co.\nv. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 134, 138–139 (1928) (holding\nthat the Jones Act “was not intended to restrict in any way\nthe long-established right of a seaman to maintenance,\n12           ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncure and wages”).\n  Not only have our decisions repeatedly observed that\nthe Jones Act preserves common-law causes of action such\nas maintenance and cure, but our case law also supports\nthe view that punitive damages awards, in particular,\nremain available in maintenance and cure actions after\nthe Act’s passage. In Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U. S. 527\n(1962), for example, the Court permitted the recovery of\nattorney’s fees for the “callous” and “willful and persis\ntent” refusal to pay maintenance and cure. Id., at 529–\n531. In fact, even the Vaughan dissenters, who believed\nthat such fees were generally unavailable, agreed that a\nseaman “would be entitled to exemplary damages in ac\ncord with traditional concepts of the law of damages”\nwhere a “shipowner’s refusal to pay maintenance stemmed\nfrom a wanton and intentional disregard of the legal\nrights of the seaman.” Id., at 540 (opinion of Stewart, J.);\nsee also Fiske, 3 F. Cas., at 957 (Story, J.) (arguing that\ncounsel fees are awardable in “[c]ourts of admiralty . . . not\ntechnically as costs, but upon the same principles, as they\nare often allowed damages in cases of torts, by courts of\ncommon law, as a recompense for injuries sustained, as\nexemplary damages, or as a remuneration for expences\nincurred, or losses sustained, by the misconduct of the\nother party”).5\n  Nothing in the text of the Jones Act or this Court’s\ndecisions issued in the wake of its enactment undermines\n——————\n  5 In the wake of Vaughan, a number of lower courts expressly held\n\nthat punitive damages can be recovered for the denial of maintenance\nand cure. See, e.g., Hines v. J. A. Laporte, Inc., 820 F. 2d 1187, 1189\n(CA11 1987) (per curiam) (upholding punitive damages award of $5,000\nfor an “arbitrary and bad faith breach of the duty to furnish mainte\nnance and cure”); Robinson v. Pocahontas, Inc., 477 F. 2d 1048, 1049–\n1052 (CA1 1973) (affirming punitive damages award of $10,000 which\nwas based, in part, on the defendant’s initial withholding of mainte\nnance and cure on the pretext that the seaman had been fired for\ncause).\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe continued existence of the common-law cause of action\nproviding recovery for the delayed or improper provision of\nmaintenance and cure. Petitioners do not deny the avail\nability of punitive damages in general maritime law, or\nidentify any cases establishing that such damages were\nhistorically unavailable for breach of the duty of mainte\nnance and cure. The plain language of the Jones Act,\nthen, does not provide the punitive damages bar that\npetitioners seek.\n                               B\n   Petitioners nonetheless argue that the availability of\npunitive damages in this case is controlled by the Jones\nAct because of this Court’s decision in Miles, 498 U. S. 19;\nsee also post, at 5–6 (opinion of ALITO, J.). In Miles, peti\ntioners argue, the Court limited recovery in maritime\ncases involving death or personal injury to the remedies\navailable under the Jones Act and the Death on the High\nSeas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. §§30301–30306.6 Petition\ners’ reading of Miles is far too broad.\n   Miles does not address either maintenance and cure\nactions in general or the availability of punitive damages\nfor such actions. The decision instead grapples with the\nentirely different question whether general maritime law\nshould provide a cause of action for wrongful death based\non unseaworthiness. By providing a remedy for wrongful\ndeath suffered on the high seas or in territorial waters, the\nJones Act and DOHSA displaced a general maritime rule\nthat denied any recovery for wrongful death. See Miles,\n498 U. S., at 23–34. This Court, therefore, was called\nupon in Miles to decide whether these new statutes sup\nported an expansion of the relief available under pre\n——————\n  6 DOHSA    applies only to individuals killed (not merely injured) by\nconduct on the high seas. See 46 U. S. C. §30302. Because this case\ninvolves injuries to a seaman, and not death on the high seas, DOHSA\nis not relevant.\n14        ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexisting general maritime law to harmonize it with a\ncause of action created by statute.\n   The Court in Miles first concluded that the “unanimous\nlegislative judgment behind the Jones Act, DOHSA, and\nthe many state statutes” authorizing maritime wrongful\ndeath actions, supported the recognition of a general\nmaritime action for wrongful death of a seaman. Id., at 24\n(discussing Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U. S.\n375 (1970), which overruled The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199\n(1886)). Congress had chosen to limit, however, the dam\nages available for wrongful-death actions under the Jones\nAct and DOHSA, such that damages were not statutorily\navailable for loss of society or lost future earnings. See\nMiles, 498 U. S., at 21, 31–32. The Court thus concluded\nthat Congress’ judgment must control the availability of\nremedies for wrongful-death actions brought under gen\neral maritime law, id., at 32–36.\n   The reasoning of Miles remains sound. As the Court in\nthat case explained, “[w]e no longer live in an era when\nseamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the\ncourts as a source of substantive legal protection from\ninjury and death; Congress and the States have legislated\nextensively in these areas.” Id., at 27. Furthermore, it\nwas only because of congressional action that a general\nfederal cause of action for wrongful death on the high seas\nand in territorial waters even existed; until then, there\nwas no general common-law doctrine providing for such an\naction. As a result, to determine the remedies available\nunder the common-law wrongful-death action, “an admi\nralty court should look primarily to these legislative en\nactments for policy guidance.” Ibid. It would have been\nillegitimate to create common-law remedies that exceeded\nthose remedies statutorily available under the Jones Act\nand DOHSA. See id., at 36 (“We will not create, under our\nadmiralty powers, a remedy . . . that goes well beyond the\nlimits of Congress’ ordered system of recovery for seamen’s\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninjury and death”).\n   But application of that principle here does not lead to\nthe outcome suggested by petitioners or the dissent. See\npost, at 2–3. Unlike the situation presented in Miles, both\nthe general maritime cause of action (maintenance and\ncure) and the remedy (punitive damages) were well estab\nlished before the passage of the Jones Act. See supra, at\n3–8. Also unlike the facts presented by Miles, the Jones\nAct does not address maintenance and cure or its remedy.7\nIt is therefore possible to adhere to the traditional under\nstanding of maritime actions and remedies without\nabridging or violating the Jones Act; unlike wrongful\ndeath actions, this traditional understanding is not a\nmatter to which “Congress has spoken directly.” See\nMiles, supra, at 31 (citing Mobil Oil Corp. v.\nHigginbotham, 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978)). Indeed, the\nMiles Court itself acknowledged that “[t]he Jones Act\nevinces no general hostility to recovery under maritime\nlaw,” 498 U. S., at 29, and noted that statutory remedy\nlimitations “would not necessarily deter us, if recovery . . .\nwere more consistent with the general principles of mari\ntime tort law.” Id., at 35. The availability of punitive\ndamages for maintenance and cure actions is entirely\nfaithful to these “general principles of maritime tort law,”\nand no statute casts doubt on their availability under\ngeneral maritime law.\n   Moreover, petitioners’ contention that Miles precludes\nany action or remedy for personal injury beyond that made\navailable under the Jones Act was directly rejected by this\nCourt in Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. Garris,\n532 U. S. 811, 818 (2001). That case involved the death of\n——————\n  7 Respondent’s claim is not affected by the statutory amendments to\n\nthe Jones Act that limit maintenance and cure recovery in cases involv\ning foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production facilities, see\n46 U. S. C. §30105, or sailing school students and instructors, §50504.\nSee supra, at 11.\n16        ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na harbor worker. Ibid. There, the Court recognized a\nmaritime cause of action for wrongful death attributable\nto negligence although neither the Jones Act (which ap\nplies only to seamen) nor DOHSA (which does not cover\nterritorial waters) provided such a remedy. Id., at 817–\n818. The Court acknowledged that “it will be the better\ncourse, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what\nthose statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further\ndevelopment to Congress.” Id., at 820. But the Court\nconcluded that the cause of action at issue there was “new\nonly in the most technical sense” because “[t]he general\nmaritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for\nmore than a century, and it has been clear since Moragne\nthat breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they\ncause death, as when they cause injury.” Ibid. The Court\nthus found that “Congress’s occupation of this field is not\nyet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is\nalready logically compelled by our precedents.” Ibid.\n   Because Miles presented no barrier to this endorsement\nof a previously unrecognized maritime cause of action for\nnegligent wrongful death, we see no legitimate basis for a\ncontrary conclusion in the present case. Like negligence,\n“[t]he general maritime law has recognized . . . for more\nthan a century” the duty of maintenance and cure and the\ngeneral availability of punitive damages. See Garris,\nsupra, at 820; see also supra, at 3–8. And because respon\ndent does not ask this Court to alter statutory text or\n“expand” the general principles of maritime tort law, Miles\ndoes not require us to eliminate the general maritime\nremedy of punitive damages for the willful or wanton\nfailure to comply with the duty to pay maintenance and\ncure. “We assume that Congress is aware of existing law\nwhen it passes legislation,” Miles, supra, at 32, and the\navailable history suggests that punitive damages were an\nestablished part of the maritime law in 1920, see supra, at\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n5–8.8\n   It remains true, of course, that “[a]dmiralty is not cre\nated in a vacuum; legislation has always served as an\nimportant source of both common law and admiralty\nprinciples.” Miles, supra, at 24. And it also is true that\nthe negligent denial of maintenance and cure may also be\nthe subject of a Jones Act claim. See Cortes v. Baltimore\nInsular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367 (1932).9 But the fact that\nseamen commonly seek to recover under the Jones Act for\nthe wrongful withholding of maintenance and cure does\nnot mean that the Jones Act provides the only remedy for\nmaintenance and cure claims. Indeed, contrary to peti\ntioners’ view that the Jones Act replaced in their entirety\nthe remedies available at common law for maintenance\nand cure, the Cortes decision explicitly acknowledged a\nseaman’s right to choose among overlapping statutory and\ncommon-law remedies for injuries sustained by the denial\nof maintenance and cure. See 287 U. S., at 374–375 (A\nseaman’s “cause of action for personal injury created by\nthe statute may have overlapped his cause of action for\nbreach of the maritime duty of maintenance and cure . . . .\nIn such circumstances it was his privilege, in so far as the\ncauses of action covered the same ground, to sue indiffer\n——————\n  8 In light of the Court’s decision in Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock\nCorp. v. Garris, 532 U. S. 811, 818 (2001), our reading of Miles cannot,\nas the dissent contends, represent an “abrup[t]” change of course. See\npost, at 1.\n  9 For those maintenance and cure claims that do not involve personal\n\ninjury (and thus cannot be asserted under the Jones Act), the dissent\nargues that punitive damages should be barred because such claims are\nbased in contract, not tort. See post, at 8. But the right of maintenance\nand cure “was firmly established in the maritime law long before\nrecognition of the distinction between tort and contract.” O’Donnell v.\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 318 U. S. 36, 42 (1943). Although the\nright has been described as incident to contract, it cannot be modified\nor waived. See Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367,\n372 (1932).\n18           ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nently on any one of them”).10\n   As this Court has repeatedly explained, “remedies for\nnegligence, unseaworthiness, and maintenance and cure\nhave different origins and may on occasion call for applica\ntion of slightly different principles and procedures.” Fitz\ngerald v. United States Lines Co., 374 U. S. 16, 18 (1963);\nsee also Peterson, 278 U. S., at 138, 139 (emphasizing that\na seaman’s action for maintenance and cure is “independ\nent” and “cumulative” from other claims such as negli\ngence and that the maintenance and cure right is “in no\nsense inconsistent with, or an alternative of, the right to\nrecover compensatory damages [under the Jones Act]”).\nSee also Gilmore & Black §6–23, at 342 (“It is unques\ntioned law that both the Jones Act and the unseaworthi\nness remedies are additional to maintenance and cure: the\nseaman may have maintenance and cure and also one of\nthe other two”). The laudable quest for uniformity in\nadmiralty does not require the narrowing of available\ndamages to the lowest common denominator approved by\nCongress for distinct causes of action.11 Although “ Con\n——————\n  10 The  fact that, in some cases, a violation of the duty of maintenance\nand cure may also give rise to a Jones Act claim, see post, at 3 (opinion\nof ALITO, J.), is significant only in that it requires admiralty courts to\nensure against double recovery. See Fitzgerald v. United States Lines\nCo., 374 U. S. 16, 18–19 (1963) (authorizing a jury trial when a mainte\nnance and cure claim is joined with a Jones Act claim because,\n“[r]equiring a seaman to split up his lawsuit, submitting part of it to a\njury and part to a judge . . . can easily result in too much or too little\nrecovery”). Thus, a court may take steps to ensure that any award of\ndamages for lost wages in a Jones Act negligence claim is offset by the\namount of lost wages awarded as part of a recovery of maintenance and\ncure. See, e.g., Petition of Oskar Tiedemann & Co., 367 F. 2d 498, 505,\nn. 6 (CA3 1966); Crooks v. United States, 459 F. 2d 631, 633 (CA9\n1972).\n   11 Although this Court has recognized that it may change maritime\n\nlaw in its operation as an admiralty court, see Edmonds v.

We do not decide these issues.\n   12 Because we hold that Miles does not render the Jones Act’s dam\n\nages provision determinative of respondent’s remedies, we do not\naddress the dissent’s argument that the Jones Act, by incorporating the\nprovisions of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, see 46 U.

The Constitution, by extend\ning the judicial power of the United States to admiralty\nand maritime cases, impliedly empowered this Court to\ncontinue the development of maritime law “in the manner\nof a common law court.” Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 16); see also Romero v.\nInternational Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 360–\n361 (1959). In Miles, this Court explained how that au\nthority should be exercised in an era in which statutory\nlaw has become dominant.\n2          ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Miles presented two questions regarding the scope of\nrelief permitted under general maritime law, the first of\nwhich was whether damages for loss of society may be\nrecovered on a general maritime law wrongful-death\nclaim. In order to answer this question, the Court looked\nto the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U. S. C. §30301\net seq., and the Jones Act 46 U. S. C. §30101 et seq., both of\nwhich created new statutory wrongful-death claims.\nBecause the relief available on these statutory claims does\nnot include damages for loss of society, the Court con\ncluded that it should not permit such damages on a wrong\nful-death claim brought under general maritime law. The\nCourt explained:\n    “We no longer live in an era when seamen and their\n    loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a\n    source of substantive legal protection from injury and\n    death; Congress and the States have legislated exten\n    sively in these areas. In this era, an admiralty court\n    should look primarily to these legislative enactments\n    for policy guidance.” 498 U. S., at 27 (emphasis\n    added).\n  The Court took a similar approach in answering the\nsecond question in Miles—whether damages for loss of\nfuture income should be available in a general maritime\nlaw survival action. The Court noted that “[t]here are\nindeed strong policy arguments for allowing such recov\nery” and that “admiralty courts have always shown a\nspecial solicitude for the welfare of seamen and their\nfamilies.” Id., at 35–36. But because the Jones Act sur\nvival provision “limits recovery to losses suffered during\nthe decedent’s lifetime,” the Court held that a similar\nlimitation should apply under general maritime law. Id.,\nat 36.\n  Miles thus instructs that, in exercising our authority to\ndevelop general maritime law, we should be guided pri\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Endorsing what has been termed a\nprinciple of uniformity, Miles teaches that if a form of\nrelief is not available on a statutory claim, we should be\nreluctant to permit such relief on a similar claim brought\nunder general maritime law.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   The type of maintenance and cure claim that is most\nlikely to include a request for punitive damages is a claim\nthat a seaman suffered personal injury as a result of the\nwillful refusal to provide maintenance and cure. Such a\nclaim may be brought under general maritime law. See\nCortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367, 374\n(1932) (recognizing that a seaman may sue under general\nmaritime law to recover for personal injury resulting from\nthe denial of maintenance and cure). And a similar claim\nmay also be maintained under the Jones Act. See, e.g.,\nGuevara v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 59 F. 3d 1496, 1499–\n1500 (CA5 1995) (en banc); G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of\nAdmiralty §6–13, p. 311 (2d ed. 1975). To be sure, a sea\nman asserting a Jones Act claim must show that his em\nployer was negligent, ibid., while a seaman proceeding\nunder general maritime law may recover compensatory\ndamages without establishing fault, id., at 310. But be\ncause the prevailing rule in American courts does not\npermit punitive damages without a showing of fault, see\nExxon Shipping, supra, at 16, n. 2, it appears that any\npersonal injury maintenance and cure claim in which\npunitive damages might be awarded could be brought\nequally under either general maritime law or the Jones\nAct. The Miles uniformity therefore weighs strongly in\nfavor of a rule that applies uniformly under general mari\ntime law and the Jones Act. I therefore turn to the ques\ntion whether punitive damages may be awarded under the\n4            ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nJones Act.\n                              B\n  Enacted in 1920, the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. §§30104–\n30105(b), makes applicable to seamen the substantive\nrecovery provisions of the Federal Employers Liability Act\n(FELA), 45 U. S. C. §51 et seq., which became law in 1908.\nFELA, in turn, “recites only that employers shall be liable\nin ‘damages’ for the injury or death of one protected under\nthe Act.” Miles, supra, at 32 (citing 45 U. S. C. §51).\n  Prior to the enactment of the Jones Act, however, this\nCourt had decided several cases that explored the dam\nages allowed under FELA. In Michigan Central R. Co. v.\nVreeland, 227 U. S. 59 (1913), the Court dealt primarily\nwith the damages that may be recovered under FELA’s\nwrongful-death provision, but the Court also discussed the\ndamages available in the case of injury. The Court noted\nthat if the worker in that case had not died from his inju\nries, “he might have recovered such damages as would\nhave compensated him for his expense, loss of time, suffer\ning and diminished earning power.” Id., at 65. Two years\nlater, in St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237 U. S. 648\n(1915), the Court reiterated that an injured worker may\nrecover only compensatory damages. Addressing the\ndamages available to a party bringing a survival claim,\nthe Court explained that the party may recover only those\ndamages that had accrued to the worker at the time of his\ndeath and was thus limited to “such damages as will be\nreasonably compensatory for the loss and suffering of the\ninjured person while he lived.” Id., at 658. See also ibid.\n(damages “confined to the [the worker’s] personal loss and\nsuffering before he died”); Miller v. American President\nLines, Ltd., 989 F. 2d 1450, 1457 (CA6), cert. denied, 510\nU. S. 915 (1993) (“It has been the unanimous judgment of\nthe courts since before the enactment of the Jones Act that\npunitive damages are not recoverable under [FELA]).”\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  When Congress incorporated FELA unaltered into the\nJones Act, Congress must have intended to incorporate\nFELA’s limitation on damages as well. Miles, 498 U. S., at\n32. “We assume that Congress is aware of existing law\nwhen it passes legislation.” Ibid. (citing Cannon v. Uni\nversity of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696–697 (1979)). It is\ntherefore reasonable to assume that only compensatory\ndamages may be recovered under the Jones Act. See\nPacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 136–.139\n(1928) (under the Jones Act, a seaman may “recover com\npensatory damages for injuries caused by the negligence”).\nAnd under Miles’ reasoning—at least in the absence of\nsome exceptionally strong countervailing considerations—\nthe rule should be the same when a seaman sues under\ngeneral maritime law for personal injury resulting from\nthe denial of maintenance and cure.\n                           III\n  In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court reasons\nthat: punitive damages were available on maintenance\nand cure claims prior to the enactment of the Jones Act\nand that the Jones Act was not intended to trim the relief\navailable on such general maritime law claims. This\nreasoning is flawed.\n                             A\n  First, the Court proceeds as if the question here were\nwhether the Jones Act was meant to preclude general\nmaritime law claims and remedies. See ante, at 9–10\n(Jones Act does not “overtur[n]” or “eliminate pre-existing\nremedies available to seamen”); ante, at 11 (Jones Act\n“preserves common-law causes of action”); ante, at 15\n(Miles does not “preclud[e]” all claims and remedies be\nyond that made available under the Jones Act). Miles\nexplicitly rejected that argument. See 498 U. S., at 29.\nBut just because the Jones Act was not meant to preclude\n6          ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ngeneral maritime claims or remedies, it does not follow\nthat the Jones Act was meant to stop the development of\ngeneral maritime law by the courts. The Jones Act is\nsignificant because it created a statutory claim that is\nindistinguishable for present purposes from a general\nmaritime law maintenance and cure claim based on per\nsonal injury and because this statutory claim does not\npermit the recovery of punitive damages. “Congress, in\nthe exercise of its legislative powers, is free to say ‘this\nmuch and no more,’ ” and “an admiralty court should look\nprimarily to these legislative enactments for policy guid\nance.” Miles, supra, at 24, 27. This policy embodied in the\nJones Act thus constitutes a powerful argument in favor of\nthe development of a similar rule under general maritime\nlaw.\n                              B\n  That brings me to the Court’s claim that the availability\nof punitive damages was established before the Jones Act\nwas passed. If punitive damages were a widely recognized\nand regularly employed feature of maintenance and cure\nclaims during the pre-Jones Act era, I would not rule out\nthe possibility that this history might be sufficient to\noutweigh the Miles uniformity principle. But a search for\ncases in which punitive damages were awarded for the\nwillful denial of maintenance of cure—in an era when\nseamen were often treated with shocking callousness—\nyields very little. Although American courts have enter\ntained maintenance and cure suits since the early 19th\ncentury, the Court points to only two reported cases—The\nCity of Carlisle, 39 F. 807 (DC Ore. 1889), and The Troop,\n118 F. 769 (DC Wash. 1902)—that, as the Court carefully\nputs it, “appear to contain at least some punitive element.”\nAnte, at 8.\n  The Court’s choice of words is well advised, for it is not\neven clear that punitive damages were recovered in these\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntwo obscure cases. In The City of Carlisle, a 16-year-old\napprentice suffered a fractured skull. The captain refused\nto put ashore. Given little care, the apprentice spent the\nnext six or seven weeks in his bunk, wracked with pain,\nand was then compelled to work 12 hours a day for the\nremaining three months of the voyage. Upon landing, the\ncaptain made no arrangements for care and did not pay for\nthe apprentice’s brain surgery. The apprentice received\nan award of $1,000; that may include some “punitive\nelement,” but it seems likely that much if not all of that\nsum represented compensation for the apprentice’s\nmonths of agony and the lingering effects of his injury.\n   The Court’s second case, The Troop, supra, involved\nsimilarly brutal treatment. The seaman fell from a mast\nand fractured an arm and a leg while his ship was six\nmiles from its port of departure. Refusing to return to\nport, the captain subjected the seaman to maltreatment\nfor the remainder of the 36-day voyage. As a result, he\nwas required to undergo painful surgery, and his injuries\npermanently prevented him from returning to work as a\nmariner. He received an undifferentiated award of $4,000,\nand while the court was sharply critical of the captain’s\nconduct, it is far from clear that the award did not consist\nentirely of compensatory damages for medical expenses,\nlost future income, and pain and suffering.\n   In addition to the two cases cited by the Court, respon\ndent and an amicus claim that punitive damages were\nawarded in a few additional cases. See Brief for Respon\ndent 13; Brief for Amicus Curiae American Assn. of Jus\ntice as Amicus Curiae 10–11. Of these cases, The Mar\ngharita, 140 F. 820 (CA5 1905), is perhaps the most\nsupportive. There, the court explained that its award of\n$1,500 would not only “compensate the seaman for his\nunnecessary and unmerited suffering” but would “empha\nsize the importance of humane and correct judgment\nunder the circumstances on the part of the master.” Id., at\n8          ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO. v. TOWNSEND\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n827. While the court’s reference to the message that the\naward embodied suggests that the award was in part\npunitive, it is also possible that the reference simply rep\nresented a restatement of one of the traditional rationales\nfor maintenance and cure, i.e., that it served the economic\ninterests of shipowners and the general interests of the\ncountry by making service as a seaman more attractive.\nSee Harden v. Gordon, 11 F. Cas. 480, 485 (No. 6,047) (CC\nMe. 1823).\n   The remaining cases contain harsh criticism of the\nseamen’s treatment but do not identify any portion of the\naward as punitive. See The Rolph, 293 F. 269 (ND Cal.\n1923), aff’d, 299 F. 52 (CA9 1924) (undifferentiated award\nof $10,000 for a seaman rendered blind in both eyes);\nTomlinson v. Hewett, 24 F. Cas. 29, 32 (No. 14,087) (DC\nCal. 1872).\n   In sum, the search for maintenance and cure cases in\nwhich punitive damages were awarded yields strikingly\nslim results. The cases found are insufficient in number,\nclarity, and prominence to justify departure from the Miles\nuniformity principle.\n                               IV\n    There is one remaining question in this case, namely,\nwhether punitive damages are permitted when a seaman\nasserts a general maritime law maintenance and cure\nclaim that is not based on personal injury. In Cortes, 287\nU. S., at 371, the Court explained that the duty to furnish\nmaintenance and cure “is one annexed to the employment.\n. . . Contractual it is in the sense that it has its source in a\nrelation which is contractual in origin, but, given the\nrelation, no agreement is competent to abrogate the inci\ndent.” The duty is thus essentially quasicontractual, and\ntherefore, in those instances in which the seaman does not\nsuffer personal injury, recovery should be governed by the\nlaw of quasi-contract. See Restatement (Second) of Con\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Dobbs, Law of Remedies §4.2(3), pp 580\n(2d ed. 1993). Thus, an award of punitive damages is not\nappropriate.
